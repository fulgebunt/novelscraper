It turns out that you are here too\u2026\u2013 EpigraphLin Che got up from the bed in a daze.Her mind was so cloudy that she did not quite feel like herself. The luxurious sheets touching her palm were not the usual ones that she had washed until they aged; the light above her head was also not the half-damaged, energy-saving lamp that she was accustomed to waking up to. Her body ached badly as if it had just been torn apart by something. When she lifted her wrist, the purplish-green marks on it were clear and obvious to the eye.That was not a dream, right\u2026She covered her mouth to stop herself from making any noise and lifted the blanket. When she saw that her body was completely naked, she almost let out a scream.Lin Che\u2019s astute eyes rolled along the bottom of her eyelids twice. She decisively removed the blanket and got out of bed. After gathering her messy clothes, she carelessly put them on and prepared to leave without looking back.Suddenly, someone grabbed the back of her neck\u2026\u201cAh\u2026 let go of me. Let go\u2026\u201d Lin Che struggled with her arms and legs.The man\u2019s large hand was pulling her neck and he yanked her back to the bed with seemingly no effort.Despite being utterly confused by the way she was handled, Lin Che could not help but be dazzled by the man when she looked up at him. Her infatuated eyes fixed on his incomparably beautiful face, unable to look away.What a handsome man\u2026His brooding eyes seemed to carry an aura of innate arrogance. His face was as cold as ice and his straight nose rested high on his clear, pale face. His white, jade-like skin made Lin Che who thought she had fairly good skin envious.She knew that she had seen her fair share of men, but in front of this specimen, those labeled as male gods were immediately eclipsed by him.Was this the same man who had tormented her yesterday until she was half-dead in the span of half a night?\u201cWho sent you here? How dare you drug me? After doing something like that, you think you can still leave here unharmed?\u201d He looked at this blanked-out woman, anger flashing deep in his eyes.This strange woman had skin as fair as snow, a pleasantly-small face, and a pair of big, expressive eyes. Her eyelashes fluttered like a deer in headlights, but she glared at him unyieldingly.Gu Jingze\u2019s gaze fixed on Lin Che as her eyes started to move quickly along with her head.She was but a D-list celebrity. After going through many difficulties, she had found out today that A-list celebrity Gu Jingyu was here. Thus, she specifically bought some \u201ccondiments\u201d that could make one lose consciousness and put them in his water, thinking that she could take advantage of him\u2026However, she had drugged the wrong person.The person before her, though dizzyingly handsome, was evidently not the top celebrity Gu Jingyu.He pulled roughly on her arm again, sending her to the ground. Embarrassingly, she even rolled over once before finding her bearings.\u201cYou\u2026 What are you doing? Do you think I\u2019d still be lying here if I drugged you? You must be mistaken. The person who is suffering the most right now is me.\u201d Her butt hurt due to the fall, notwithstanding her hurt arm. Worst of all, the pain in her nether regions could not be ignored. Incensed with anger, she shouted directly, \u201cThe person I wanted to drug was someone else. It had nothing to do with you. You think you\u2019re worth drugging? Yours truly does not lay her hands on just anyone. Return me my drug money!\u201dDrugged the wrong person?Gu Jingze\u2019s face tensed and his brow furrowed which formed three vertical wrinkles. His jet-black pupils were like those of a crouching beast\u2019s, ones that were staring at this woman in messy clothes. Half of her snow-white shoulder was exposed and the purplish-green bruises on it were all the more prominent like plum blossoms blooming on her tender, white skin.The images of the previous night flashed through his mind a second time. His lower abdomen suddenly heated up again and he felt the obvious arousal surging through his body.He shifted his gaze away from her.This damned woman\u2026 How dare she drug him? And with such a potent drug.His momentary loss of focus finally gave Lin Che an opportunity. In her desperation, she jumped off the bed and pushed the man away.Not daring to look back, she quickly ran out.Upon hearing him hiss, she shouted, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Go look at yourself!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze was just about to turn around and grab her when he felt a wave of discomfort. His lower area was once again standing tall and proud.\u201cDamn it,\u201d he cursed loudly. He clenched his fist in an attempt to curb that damned desire.A series of sounds traveled in from outside.Qin Hao looked back as he was so astonished that his mouth could not close.What was that earlier situation? Why did a woman in disheveled clothes\u2014of all things\u2014run out of Sir\u2019s room?\u201cS-Sir, Second Young Master called to ask if the room was satisfactory, but you fell asleep immediately after you came back yesterday night, so the subordinates did not disturb you. The assistant has informed the President of your schedule; he is waiting for you in the Presidential Residence. Also\u2026 the lady I saw earlier\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Gu Jingze lifted his sharp eyes, his pupils flashing. Qin Hao immediately swallowed all the doubts that he should not have been having.In the bathroom, Gu Jingze continuously scrubbed his body until his skin became sore. Only then did he look into the mirror and swear loudly, \u201c****.\u201d\u201cSir, Madam is here,\u201d Qin Hao reminded him softly from outside, nervousness lacing his voice.Gu Jingze froze. His mother coming over at the moment could not be good news.When he opened the bathroom door, the glamorous lady standing outside was looking at the messy bed in shock.The scattered sheets that were not arranged indicated to anyone of exactly what had happened the night before.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes darkened. He grabbed the bathrobe and draped it over his honey-colored shoulders. \u201cI know what you want to ask, but Mother, I\u2019m very busy today.\u201dHow could Mu Wanqing not ask? She could hardly hide the excitement on her face. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, \u201cJingze, I already know. You slept with a girl.\u201dGu Jingze pushed the door open and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, \u201cCan you keep your hands off of this matter?\u201d\u201cHow can I not care? Jingze, you must marry this girl; you must be responsible for what you did to her.\u201dHe knew she would say so\u2026\u201cMother, I will not marry her. I\u2019m not crazy. She\u2019s just a stranger. I don\u2019t even know her name.\u201d\u201cHer name is Lin Che. She\u2019s 23 years old. She\u2019s the illegitimate daughter of the Lin Group\u2019s Lin family and has two elder sisters and one younger brother. Her mother died when she was young and her father does not seem to care about her. She lives in the Lin residence, but she doesn\u2019t get any financial support from the Lin family\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMother!\u201d Gu Jingze stood rooted to the ground. Upon remembering the woman, he became even more frustrated.\u201cAre you still thinking about that Mo Huiling? I\u2019m telling you. It\u2019s impossible between you and her. You\u2019ve been with her for so many years, but you still couldn\u2019t even touch her. You two are not destined to be together!\u201d Mu Wanqing said rudely.\u201cMother, enough!\u201d Gu Jingze cut her off.However, Mu Wanqing was too agitated. \u201cJingze, you know that you can\u2019t satisfy a woman at all because of your illness! The family has almost finished making preparations for artificial insemination so that you can have a child. However, you touched a woman today. It must mean that she\u2019s the one most suited for you!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It has nothing to do with my illness getting better!\u201d Gu Jingze said, his eyes darkening.Mu Wanqing looked at him and said, \u201cYou think I\u2019ve never tried that on you? It never worked. Each time, we could only call for the doctor to handle it time and time again. But you touched her. Furthermore, your subordinates said that you were very satisfied with her and did it more than once the entire night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze pressed his clenched fist on the tempered-glass table and said, \u201cMaybe the drug this time was different. In any case, I won\u2019t marry this crazy woman who doesn\u2019t have an ounce of morality. Mother, you should give up on this idea.\u201d\u2014\u2014As Lin Che walked on the streets and looked at the mess all over her body, she cursed silently in frustration.That damned drug-seller.She had felt that something was wrong with him when she bought the drug. All she had said was that she needed a drug to make someone fall asleep, but she had never said that she wanted such a drug. Now, look at what the man did to her after consuming it. She could still feel the pain throughout her body when she recalled what had happened.The excruciating pain in her nether regions brought to mind the events of the previous night. That darned man had tormented her many times to the point that she fainted and could not remember anything else.The only thing she remembered from before\u2026\u201cLin Che, look at yourself. You still want to be a celebrity? It\u2019s better to listen properly to your stepmother. I\u2019ll find you a good family to marry into. An illegitimate child is just an illegitimate child. You will always be second-rate.\u201d\u201cLin Che, Stepmother is doing this for your own good. Your eldest sister, Lin Li, is now a top celebrity; your second sister is also a top producer. After so many years, you\u2019re still just a D-list celebrity. You have no prospects.\u201d\u201cLittle Che, the company has already allocated the role to someone else this time. We think that your image does not suit the role.\u201dShe smiled bitterly\u2026 if they had not pushed her into a corner, she would not have come up with such a sinister plot. All she wanted was to continue living, but now \u2026Lin Che rushed to the company; regardless of what had happened, she did not forget that she had an audition today.Upon seeing her arrive, Yu Minmin\u2019s face darkened as she glared at Lin Che and said, \u201cSo you still came. I thought you didn\u2019t care about this audition!\u201d\u201cSorry Sister Yu, I came late.\u201dLin Che quickly covered up the mess on her clothes.With one look, Yu Minmin saw the marks on her neck. She lowered her head and inspected Lin Che\u2019s clothes. Pulling on Lin Che\u2019s collar, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re meeting the director soon. I don\u2019t care about your personal life. However, if you still want this role, you better freshen up so you don\u2019t look like a prostitute!\u201dLin Che looked down at herself. Only then did she discover the marks that left little to the imagination. They were too obvious and too embarrassing.That stupid man. He was a total beast!Lin Che immediately bowed and apologized. Pulling on her clothes, she ran to the bathroom, thinking to herself,It was all that man\u2019s fault. He had basically put an end to her life or whatever future she had!All of a sudden, her phone started ringing.Lin Che picked up the phone in exasperation.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cLin Che, where were you last night?\u201d Lin Youcai sounded angry through the phone.Lin Youcai seldom called her unless something was up. For many years, he was dispensable as a father, but Lin Che could not treat him as a completely non-existent person. After all, she still needed to live in the Lin household.Lin Che thought about what had happened last night. Feeling guilty, she said, \u201cI-I had something on last night.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what you were busy with. Your sister, Lin Li, wants to discuss her engagement with the family today. How dare you stay out all night?\u201d Lin Youcai reprimanded fiercely.Yes, Lin Li was getting engaged, but that was none of her business.Lin Che listened calmly to her father\u2019s angry tirade without a sliver of sadness in her heart. After so many years, she had already become accustomed to his scoldings.\u201cI don\u2019t care what you have going on. You must come back now. If I discover that you\u2019re not back, I\u2019ll dig out her ashes from the Lin family grave and throw it into the sea so you\u2019ll never see any part of your mother for the rest of your life.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, Lin Youcai hung up the phone.The Lin Household.Han Caiying watched as Lin Youcai put down the phone. She eagerly asked, \u201cIs she coming back?\u201dLin Youcai replied, \u201cShe\u2019s coming back.\u201dHan Caiying stretched out a hand to caress Lin Youcai\u2019s chest in an attempt to appease him. \u201cOld Master, you must have a talk with her so that she agrees to this marriage proposal. I was really shocked when the Cheng family suddenly proposed marriage. Lin Yu is an outstanding girl; she\u2019s beautiful and sensible, so how could I let her marry that retard? I even heard that he\u2019s incontinent. They just want Lin Yu to marry into their family so that they would have a maid. As for Lin Che, she\u2019s an illegitimate child anyway. Who should go if not her?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Lin Youcai said, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to let Lin Yu suffer either. But Lin Che is also my daughter\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat, so you mean that you\u2019d make Lin Yu clean up someone else\u2019s feces and urine instead of Lin Che? If that\u2019s the case, Lin Youcai, you really don\u2019t have a conscience. Back when you had this daughter with another woman, I let her stay in the Lin household and brought her up. Now that she\u2019s grown up, you wouldn\u2019t even let her help me out a little. Given her standard, letting her marry into the Cheng family to enjoy their wealth is an honor for her.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Seeing as Han Caiying had begun bringing up the past and was nagging incessantly, Lin Youcai quickly stopped her and said, \u201cI\u2019ll make her go. She\u2019ll go.\u201dLin Youcai had indeed hesitated, but upon ruminating, there was no one else to choose besides Lin Che.They could not afford to offend the Cheng family. Although their son was a retard, they were, at least, rolling in money. Marrying Lin Che into their family could be considered quite a fair treatment towards her.Then, the housekeeper called from outside, \u201cOld Master, Madam, Third Miss is back.\u201dThe housekeeper said to Lin Che, \u201cOld Master and Madam are waiting for you inside. First Miss is discussing her engagement today, so your brother-in-law is here too.\u201dLin Che looked at the housekeeper in astonishment, \u201cQin Qing is here?\u201dThe housekeeper said, \u201cYes, he went in right before you.\u201dPleasantly surprised, Lin Che ran into the house only to stop a moment later.Inside, Qin Qing and Lin Li were standing together in the hallway.They were leaning close together, their lips almost touching. It was a bad time to disturb them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che stood there rooted, forgetting to even move away.When she finally attempted to turn around, she felt a slap on her face which nearly sent her to the ground. As her cheek burned, Han Caiying grabbed her and pulled her into a room.After shutting the door, Han Caiying turned around to glare at Lin Che. She pointed accusingly at Lin Che and said, \u201cYou shameless whore. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see what you were up to. That is your brother-in-law. How shameless can you be to dare attempt at seducing him?\u201dLin Che stood rooted to the ground. Holding her burning cheek, Lin Che smirked at Han Caiying and said, \u201cStepmother, if I really wanted to seduce him, I wouldn\u2019t be just standing there and watching.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shouldn\u2019t You Repay Us?Atlas Studios\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Han Caiying\u2019s lungs were about to explode with anger. As Lin Che was about to leave, Han Caiying yanked her by the shoulder and sent her directly to the ground. \u201cHave you not looked at yourself? We\u2019ve been looking after you for so long with a Bodhisattva\u2019s heart. How dare you talk back to me when we saved you from dying on the streets with your crazy mother? So what if I hit you?\u201dHowever, the obvious marks on Lin Che\u2019s neck appeared before her as clear as day. It was offensive to the eye.As if she had made some grand discovery, Han Caiying said as if she was crazy, \u201cWell, well, Lin Che. I knew you had bad intentions towards our Lin family. You\u2019re just like your mother, only knowing how to go around seducing people. Go somewhere else if you want to seduce someone. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself in our house. Qin Qing is the successor of the Qin family. Do you think that a whore like you is good enough for him? He won\u2019t even spare you a glance.\u201dHan Caiying\u2019s slap did not make Lin Che sad at all. However, this simple sentence was enough to cut through Lin Che\u2019s heart.Despite so, Lin Che started laughing. She snorted as she pulled up her clothes to cover her shoulders and patted her clothes nonchalantly as she said, \u201cIf you think I\u2019m not good enough for him, so much so that he won\u2019t even look at me, why are you so anxious?\u201dHan Caiying heard some noise coming from outside; Qin Qing was chatting with Lin Li. Their conversation and laughter made her nervous. Afraid of being discovered, Han Caiying lowered her voice and moved closer to Lin Che. She said threateningly, \u201cDon\u2019t play any tricks.\u201d After thinking for a bit, she spoke again. \u201cPeople from the Cheng family are coming later with their second son, Cheng Tianyu. Don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t care about you. I\u2019ll let you meet him later. The Cheng family has a good reputation and background in our country. If you marry into their family, you will enjoy endless fortunes.\u201dLin Che\u2019s gaze wavered.Of course, she knew who the second son of the Cheng family was.\u201cStepmother, you want me to marry a retard?\u201d And she even claimed that it was out of concern for her? Lin Che let out a shout of protest.\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cMarry him yourself if you want to. I\u2019m not a puppet that you can manipulate!\u201d Lin Che quickly yanked open the door.Seeing this, Han Caiying held her back with all her strength.Lin Che tossed all concerns aside at that moment. She turned around and pushed Han Caiying aside.Sprawled out on the ground, Han Caiying said angrily, \u201cLin Che, if you dare to leave, I will make sure your father throws out your mother\u2019s ashes.\u201dLin Che ran out in desperation.Meanwhile\u2026Gu Jingze was soon called back to the Gu family mansion.Naturally, the incident had been quickly reported to his grandfather, Gu Xiande, who was also the head of the family.Gu Jingze remained unwavering in his stance. He looked at Gu Xiande before him and said, \u201cGrandfather, Mother does not understand the situation at all. That woman and I did not sleep together of our own accord. It was just an accident.\u201d\u201cJingze, why must you be so stubborn? Think about it. Would it really be unbearable for you to marry her? You have already touched her. Don\u2019t you miss that feeling even a little bit?\u201d\u201cNot at all!\u201d Gu Jingze replied.\u201cJingze, I\u2019m extremely disappointed in you.\u201d The calm and old Gu Xiande looked coldly at Gu Jingze with his imposing aura.Gu Jingze glared at Mu Wanqing who was behind him.However, Mu Wanqing bore a self-righteous expression.\u201cOur Gu family will definitely take responsibility for what we\u2019ve done. Furthermore, she\u2019s not just crucial for you to have a normal married life. She\u2019s also the key to curing your illness. You should be more rational. In any case, you slept with the girl. You can\u2019t just take advantage of her and then forget about everything,\u201d Gu Xiande said.Gu Jingze looked at his aged grandfather and said, \u201cBut I do not know her at all. Grandfather, how can I agree to marrying a total stranger?\u201d\u201cWhat if I tell you that if you don\u2019t get married, I will make your little lover\u2026 what\u2019s her name? Mo Huiling, right. I will make her lose her career, so that she feels like it\u2019s better to be dead than alive?\u201d Gu Xiande\u2019s eyes were strikingly similar to Gu Jingze\u2019s. When he made a threat, his gaze was calm, but his eyes projected a hidden current of cold ruthlessness.Gu Jingze said, \u201cYou know that I won\u2019t let you get away with it.\u201dGu Xiande said, \u201cI know that your wings have hardened and I can no longer control you. All three of you have become rebellious, one by one. One became a president, another became a celebrity, and you. You have always been mature, but rebellious. But even if I can\u2019t do anything to you, I definitely have my ways of tormenting a little girl. You can try me.\u201dDisgust flashed in Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes but they darkened into a slight glint.*Lin Che only ran a few steps before she saw several cars driving over noisily.People from the Lin family\u2026Lin Che wanted to leave, but it was apparent that the Lin family took this very seriously. Nearly all of them had been mobilized and they soon surrounded Lin Che.\u201cLass, I\u2019m doing this for your own good. Still, you dare run away. Go and bring her back for me.\u201dLin Che stared at Han Caiying, resisting the urge to rush up and slap her.However, she was ultimately alone and could not prevail over these people who had strength in numbers.With her hands tied behind her back, Lin Che was brought back to the Lin household.The makeup artist came to freshen Lin Che up while Han Caiying stared at her murderously. She reprimanded her arrogantly, \u201cTo think that someone like you is attempting to escape me? In a while, you better be dressed up to meet Cheng Tianyu.\u201dLin Che clenched her teeth and struggled a little, but it was all futile.As Han Caiying looked at Lin Che after she had been freshened up, she thought to herself,This lass looks very beautiful when she\u2019s dressed up; her delicate face is enough to keep her on any man\u2019s mind.She thought to herself,She has to be married into the Cheng family as soon as possible. Otherwise, she would always be around Qin Qing. If Qin Qing really falls in love with her, then Lin Li\u2019s position would be compromised.Someone outside announced Cheng Tianyu\u2019s arrival.Under Han Caiying\u2019s command, Lin Che was immediately released from her binds and pushed to the front. Through the door, she could hear the Cheng family\u2019s spirited voices.\u201cWe all know that the Third Miss is just an illegitimate daughter. She\u2019s not really worthy of our Tianyu, but she does look quite good in photographs. After marrying into our family, as long as she helps continue the Cheng family\u2019s bloodline, she will benefit greatly in the future.\u201dGive birth?Lin Che sneered and thought.Was she being treated as a tool for procreation?Lin Che saw a man standing there with a small stature of 1.6 meters. He was convulsing, shaking his head constantly as he looked around. Like a sloppy child, he was chewing on his fingers.Han Caiying smiled and said, \u201cYou see, Lin Che. This is your future husband. Your golden days are coming soon.\u201dOf course, Lin Che could hear the arrogance and mockery in Han Caiying\u2019s words.Then, Cheng Tianyu suddenly went into a fit of madness. Wailing loudly, he launched himself at the people to the side.The people inside were plunged into great confusion and chaos; people from the Cheng family and the Lin family surrounded the retard completely.Han Caiying was shocked. The way that the retard looked as he barged about was so disgusting to her that she almost vomited.In her heart, she was relieved. Fortunately, it was now Lin Che who had to marry him, not Lin Yu. Otherwise, she would have really died from anger.She then turned around and discovered that there was no one beside her\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLin Che, where did Lin Che go? Go after her! Give her a good beating when you catch her!\u201d The look in Han Caiying\u2019s eyes changed as her face scrunched up.Lin Che did not know how she had escaped. She only knew that when she was finally alone, her lungs were about to explode from running.But right at that moment, she saw a car parked casually to the side.Lin Che\u2019s head stopped moving. Behind the car window, Gu Jingze\u2019s disdainful face appeared before her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a pity that his personality did not match up to his good looks.However, he did not look at her; instead, he looked coolly to the side and said, \u201cHow much money do I have to give you in order for you to marry me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHad she misheard him?He said directly, \u201cSince we can\u2019t undo what we did, I have to fulfill my responsibility by marrying you.\u201d\u201cHehe. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.\u201d Lin Che thought that he was joking.As if he knew what she was thinking, he turned his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not joking. I need to marry you. If you agree, we can sign the marriage document now. I advise you to seize this rare opportunity.\u201dLin Che was at a loss for words, only to start start laughing. This man spoke as if marrying him was a splendid thing. However, he wasn\u2019t his younger brother Gu Jingyu. If she could marry Gu Jingyu, she definitely would not need to work so hard to get her name out there.Lin Che said, \u201cWhat benefits will I get out of marrying you?\u201dGu Jingze felt disgusted when he looked into her eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re my wife, I\u2019ll pay for all of your expenses. I can also provide you with accommodations. If you have a boyfriend or someone you like, I\u2019ll give you the money you deserve when we divorce so that no man will be able to look down on you. Furthermore, I can get rid of any obstacle in your way. Trust me, this marriage will only do you good. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201dAfter hearing the first part of his speech, Lin Che felt that this joke was getting out of hand. However, she felt a little tempted when she heard the last condition he offered.Indeed, she would not have to return to the Lin household or marry the retard from the Cheng family if she married him.But could he really help her?\u201cSo do you mean we\u2019ll eventually get a divorce?\u201d Lin Che asked.She was considering divorce now? But she was right. Since it was a marriage of convenience, it was not wrong to consider the future benefits at the outset.Gu Jingze nodded. \u201cYes. When I decide to divorce you, you must cooperate with me. I will find a reasonable excuse and I will make sure not to hurt our reputation. But I must remind you that we will sign a prenuptial agreement. You can\u2019t covet any other benefits.\u201d\u201cHey, you\u2019re really rude. I don\u2019t want any other benefits from you,\u201d Lin Che said, having reached the limit of her patience.Gu Jingze opened the door of his Porsche. \u201cWe don\u2019t need manners in this marriage. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ll be growing old together.\u201d\u201cBut are you absolutely sure that we\u2019re really getting married? You know that I just met you. We don\u2019t understand each other at all.\u201d Lin Che was still doubtful.Gu Jingze stared at her and said, \u201cWhat else do we need to know? I understand every nook and cranny of your body.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Che blushed furiously upon recalling that night. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my fault alone. I\u2019ve already explained it to you!\u201dAfter all, she was still a girl.She glared angrily at Gu Jingze, but his face remained passive, making her even angrier.Gu Jingze looked back and said, \u201cFine, I won\u2019t bring this up again. Also, I know that marriage is a serious step to take. As my wife, I promise to respect you and to make our lives as comfortable as possible. I\u2019m not trying to scam you into marriage; since I\u2019ve decided to do it, I will treat it seriously.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s passive face bore a graceful posture and calmness. His extraordinary aura was very pleasing.It was perhaps this that made Lin Che feel that marrying him was not a bad thing at all.Silently, she nodded her head.Gu Jingze let out a breath of relief. He quietly gestured to the driver to start the engine.Marriage was an extremely fast process; for a marriage without love, everything was as simple as signing a contract.Outside, a driver alighted from a black Porsche. He walked up to Lin Che and respectfully took her bag. With his head bowed, he said enthusiastically, \u201cMadam, please make your way into the car.\u201dLin Che nodded. She was still unaccustomed to being called \u2018Madam\u2019. On her other side, the man who had been expressionless from the start walked past her to stand beside the car.Without a doubt, her husband was so handsome that he could incur the indignation of all gods and men. That face with its tall nose, and deep, calm eyes could infatuate anyone. Under his lush hair, his face was pale and clear but devoid of femininity. His lean figure carried an irresistible allure with it.Gu Jingze turned around. As he looked at Lin Che, he said monotonously, \u201cI\u2019ve already informed my family that there won\u2019t be a wedding.\u201d\u201cThat would be best. It\u2019s supposed to be a secret marriage. I don\u2019t want things to blow up either,\u201d Lin Che said.Upon hearing this, Gu Jingze scoffed. \u201cAfter all, the method you used was improper. If someone were to find out, you would only be more embarrassed.\u201d\u201cHey, Gu Jingze! I said that it was just an accident!\u201d Lin Che\u2019s calm face darkened. Whenever the incident came up, she felt guilty that her carelessness had caused it to happen. Furthermore, both of them had been at fault; she was not the only one to be blamed.Gu Jingze drew in a breath. He knew that he had gone overboard, having already promised not to bring it up again.\u201cSorry.\u201d He looked at Lin Che\u2019s blushing face and continued, \u201cI apologize. We signed the agreement and I\u2019m not supposed to mention it again. I was just being impulsive. But you have to know that I\u2019m not marrying you out of my free will. I have someone I love.\u201dLin Che sensed the sincerity in his voice. She lifted her head to give his face a sideward glance.She honestly felt sorry for him. He was forced to marry a total stranger all because of her mistake.The thought calmed her down. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I can understand. We just got married and we still have to live together in the future. Adjusting to each other is unavoidable.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll get used to it as soon as possible. I hope that you\u2019ll do as the contract terms say.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m a professional actress. I\u2019ll take our contract seriously; I\u2019ll act like I\u2019m in love with you in front of the Gu family and play my role well. I also hope that you can follow the contract. This is a fake marriage. Let\u2019s not have any physical contact,\u201d Lin Che said.\u201cOf course. However, you should know that we must live together to dispel my family\u2019s suspicions.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSure. I said that I would cooperate as long as you don\u2019t interfere with my life.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve never been interested in uncultured, ill-mannered, and shabby women like you,\u201d Gu Jingze said while his eyes swept over her face.\u201cHa, that\u2019s just nice. Neither am I interested in men who are wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing with no skills in bed, ones who only know how to use brute force,\u201d Lin Che said adamantly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s handsome face clouded over. His eyes burned with anger as he glared at Lin Che. It was inappropriate of her to casually ridicule his behavior in bedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And anyway, you criticized me first.\u201d Lin Che\u2019s crescent eyes glared at him.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m sorry. It was my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have said it,\u201d Gu Jingze said while pulling at his clothes.Lin Che nodded. \u201cI accept your apology. I won\u2019t touch you again anyway, so I won\u2019t mention your skills anymore.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened even more.Resisting the urge to throw another tantrum, he said, \u201cWhile we\u2019re living together, we may have to share a bedroom like a typical married couple so that word doesn\u2019t get out. If my family hears about it, we\u2019ll be in trouble. I\u2019ll respect your freedom. You can make friends and you can have your privacy. I won\u2019t ask about it as long as it doesn\u2019t compromise my reputation.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have my professional ethics. Since I\u2019m married to you, I won\u2019t casually get involved in scandals with other men. We\u2019ll be divorcing soon anyway; I can tolerate this for at least these few years.\u201d\u201cOkay. It\u2019s a deal.\u201d\u201cDeal.\u201dOf course, although they were married, in reality, they were no different from two strangers who had gotten a marriage certificate.As if he had completed some mission, Gu Jingze did not look at his new bride again. Instead, he turned his head and gestured to the people following behind him outside.Lin Che followed Gu Jingze through the downtown area and into a compound.There was a three-story villa in the courtyard. The person inside smiled at Lin Che as she came out of the car. His hands were folded and his head was bowed as he said respectfully, \u201cMadam, you can call me Butler Hu.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Dazed, Lin Che looked inside. The courtyard was wide and spacious with a long and straight road leading in. A lush-green field stretched into the distance. This place was so big that she could not see where it ended.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che. \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying here with me from now on.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019ll be staying here too?\u201d\u201cOf course. Are you prepared to live separately already when we just got married?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just confirming,\u201d Lin Che raised her head and spoke.Looking at her, Gu Jingze said, \u201cMy parents don\u2019t usually come over. You can command the servants as you wish. If you don\u2019t like the interior design, feel free to tell Butler Hu. You can change whatever you want as long as you don\u2019t touch my bedroom and study room.\u201dHow rude that would be. Lin Che blurted, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not dissatisfied with anything. It would be too troublesome to renovate.\u201dGu Jingze stopped in his tracks and looked at her with a distant gaze. The way he casually leaned against a corner of the table was very elegant.Maybe people with good looks looked good doing anything.Gu Jingze\u2019s hand rested on the table. His slender fingers held his wallet. Their bone structure was distinct and beautiful and those hands were definitely suited to play the piano.\u201cButler Hu will take you around the house,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you get used to your surroundings soon.\u201dButler Hu swiftly took her on a tour around the house.There was an alarmingly large number of rooms. The maids\u2019 quarters were outside, the kitchen was in the back, the living room was in the front, and the bedroom was upstairs. She felt that she would definitely lose her way if she went around alone.Although the Lin family was a fairly respectable family, the Lin residence was obviously drastically different from this place.She turned around to look at Butler Hu. \u201cThis is Gu Jingze\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cYes, Madam. From now on, it is also your house.\u201dLin Che looked around. \u201cGu Jingze seems to be pretty wealthy.\u201d\u201cYes, Madam.\u201d Butler Hu looked at her with slight suspicion.Then, Butler Hu smiled and said, \u201cAlthough Sir seems difficult to get along with, he is a good person. You\u2019ll get used to it eventually. Please just relax.\u201dLin Che pushed open the walnut-colored double doors to the bedroom.Immediately, she was faced with Gu Jingze\u2019s half-naked body as he stood beside the bathroom door.His lean, honey-colored body appeared more attractive after his recent shower. His muscles were symmetrically balanced on his chest and arms, giving him the perfect V-shaped body. The lines below his hip were also prominent.Lin Che took a long time to react.He wasn\u2019t wearing clothes!The white towel wrapped loosely around his lower body looked like it was about to fall. Lin Che shouted in surprise and ran out of the room, the door closing with a thud.Inside, Gu Jingze frowned unhappily. For a moment, he regretted agreeing to his family\u2019s demands so easily. He liked elegant women, ones who were poised and dignified with proper etiquette and manners. Just like Mo Huiling. But now, he was married to someone who he wasn\u2019t very compatible with. And it was all because of a ridiculous reason.However, this woman was now indeed his lawful wife.Lin Che stood against the door with her hand on her chest. She could feel her heart still beating furiously.The scene from earlier reappeared in her mind.This man was really too attractive; his body was so perfect that she almost had a nosebleed.However, Lin Che understood clearly that it was just an accident. Although he was her husband, this was just a contract.The door opened. Gu Jingze had put on a set of casual clothes that took away some of the sternness he emanated earlier. However, he still looked cold enough to freeze someone.He glanced at Lin Che and said, \u201cDo you still want to come in?\u201dLin Che froze for a moment before blurting, \u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019ll come in.\u201dHe had already established that they would live together after marriage; it was just that she had not gotten used to it.Under Gu Jingze\u2019s unchangingly aloof gaze, Lin Che ran into the bedroom and closed the door.She knew that her earlier reaction had been too intense. Feeling slightly helpless, she said to him, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I\u2019m still not comfortable with the fact that I\u2019m married and that I live with you now. That\u2019s why I reacted in that way.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s gaze rested on her white and glowing face. Compared to other women, her skin was so white it almost seemed translucent. It seemed to be as soft and smooth as a baby\u2019s skin. He paused before shifting his gaze.Looking of to the side, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what bad habits you used to have, but I hope that the first thing you learn here is to knock before you enter.\u201dLin Che said indignantly, \u201cAre you blaming me for coming in without knocking? How was I supposed to know that you were naked? I think you should be the one to adjust. Now that there\u2019s someone living with you, you shouldn\u2019t just walk around naked.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s shot a dark look at the unreasonable woman.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che just could not help it. She initially wanted to get along with him properly, but this man had an uncanny ability to incite a quarrel with his unkind words.She was just not used to dealing with him.Gu Jingze decided to stop conversing with this woman. He picked up his blanket and walked towards the couch.Seeing this, Lin Che called out, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: Marriage LifeAtlas Studios\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d He threw his blanket down. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch. You sleep on the bed.\u201dHe considered himself a gentleman; it was only right to decline.Lin Che could fall asleep anywhere. But for someone like Gu Jingze who lived in such a huge house, he wasn\u2019t a person who could adjust to inconvenience.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch. For real. I\u2019m used to doing that at home. At your height, it would be uncomfortable to sleep on the couch,\u201d she said. She stood at his side and was prepared to pull his elbow.But before she could touch him, he blocked her with his elbow.Lin Che fell directly to the ground and looked up at Gu Jingze who had completely written off her good intentions. She offered him the bed because she wanted to get along with him, but a mere touch displeased him.Her anger began to rise slowly. Lin Che stood up and yelled, \u201cGu Jingze, are you crazy? Forget that I came to sleep on the couch out of kindness. What do you mean by this?\u201dGu Jingze raised his impeccable eyebrows, lowered his head, and patted the part of his elbow that she had touched. He looked calmly at the frazzled woman beside him and said coolly, \u201cLet me get one thing straight. You caused all of this to happen. You\u2019re saying that you were being kind. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little late now?\u201d\u201cEven\u2026 even if I drugged you, I didn\u2019t make you push me down. You\u2026 you could have rubbed me off by yourself, but you pushed me down instead. I should be the one to complain.\u201d As she said this, she felt even more sheepish, but she refused to give in verbally.It was his fault for being such a jerk.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d It had not registered to Gu Jingze what \u201crubbed me off\u201d meant, but when he understood it, he found it unacceptable that a woman could be this uncouth. Another layer of ice seemed to freeze over his face and he pointed his slender finger towards the door. \u201cGet out!\u201dLin Che froze, having no clue as to what she was thinking when she impulsively argued with him like this.The more he looked down on her, the angrier she became. Glaring at him, she jumped onto his back. \u201cOh no! There\u2019s a rat. It\u2019s so scary! Rats are my greatest fear.\u201dSince he disliked her, she resolved to irritate him even more by sticking to him.Gu Jingze tensed up. When her soft, fragrant body latched onto him like a sloth, his body jolted and he instinctively tried to shake her off.\u201cLet go!\u201d He stretched his arm backward to push her off, but the two soft lumps pressing against his back started a flame inside his body. His body froze.Although Lin Che was quite tall at 168cm, in comparison to Gu Jingze who was at least 190cm, she was much smaller. Her body was different from a man\u2019s: it was as soft as silk and as pliant as water. She clung to his body like a thin snake, making him realize that even though she was very tall, she was very slender. Her pale fingers held onto his arm and were comforting, even though they were cold to the touch.However, during this time, the lumps pressing against his back felt more and more prominent, and his body began to heat up uncontrollably.Damn it. The effect of the drug should have worn off a long time ago\u2026However, his body was obviously reacting.\u201cI won\u2019t let go. There\u2019s a rat. I\u2019m afraid of rats\u2026\u201d She held onto him for dear life and refused to let go.However, she suddenly felt his arm stretch out to grab her waist. He pulled her off his back and threw her down. Using the momentum, she held onto him and they both fell to the ground.When Gu Jingze regained his bearings, right before him was her soft, pink lips. He could also see a sliver of pearly white teeth. It was like a passionate invitation that left his throat dry.Surprised, Gu Jingze subconsciously pushed away the delicate body that had fallen on top of him.Lin Che felt a stabbing pain, particularly in the softest part of her chest where his arm had jabbed her. It hurt so much that she was tearing up\u2026Gu Jingze had just begun to relax when he saw Lin Che sitting on the floor with her hands on her chest while tears flowed down her porcelain cheeks. Strangely, his heart lurched in his chest as he looked at her trembling shoulders.Somewhat frustrated, he regained his rationality and started reprimanding himself. He had indeed gone overboard; she was merely a girl in her early 20s, but she had been forced to accept this marriage without love.After all, it was both their fault. She was not the only one to blame.Her tears left him at a complete loss. He did not know how to comfort others and could only stand there. \u201cSorry, I apologize. This time, it wasn\u2019t your fault. I was too emotional. To be honest, I\u2019m just like you. I haven\u2019t gotten used to having a woman beside me. I didn\u2019t push you because I dislike you, actually\u2026 I have an illness that doesn\u2019t allow me to touch women.\u201dHis explanation was unexpected; she raised her teary eyes in surprise and confusion.He thought to himself,Since they had to live together, he should tell her about his illness.Letting out a breath, he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine with men, but all women make me feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s not simply that I can\u2019t touch them. I will even develop rashes, vomit repeatedly, and my blood will flow backward. That is why I avoided you.\u201dLin Che could not understand. \u201cSuch an illness exists? Is it a psychiatric condition?\u201dGu Jingze sat there with his back straight as a ramrod as always; he looked completely healthy.His eyes were as still as water in a well. He was used to this. After all, he had seen countless doctors for 30 years. He only had to keep it a secret from outsiders.\u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d He massaged his temples with his slightly bent fingers. He looked a little fatigued. \u201cYou must keep this a secret from outsiders. I\u2019m telling you only because we\u2019ll be living together. I hope you know that my family wanted us to get married because they think you can curb my illness since I touched you.\u201dSo this was the truth. It was a pity that they were mistaken; in actual fact, Lin Che could not heal his illness. She knew that what had happened between them was because of some things she had done\u2026Lin Che nodded her head in embarrassment. \u201cOf course, of course. It\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re ill. Sorry, I touched you because I didn\u2019t know about it. I promise I won\u2019t touch you again.\u201dHe looked at Lin Che doubtfully. She put up three fingers, her fingertips soft and lovely. Her gaze was fixed on him as she smiled at him resolutely.Gu Jingze looked away from her and said quietly, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go to bed then.\u201dLin Che nodded her head vigorously. She massaged her injured chest and stood up, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Gu Jingze laid down on the couch.Putting aside her guilt, Lin Che didn\u2019t dare to touch him again. She found a blanket and dived under it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter turning off the lights, the room was plunged into darkness.Their breathing mixed into the air and circulated slowly.The couch was not comfortable so he kept adjusting and re-adjusting his body. He could clearly hear someone tossing and turning on the bed. His brow furrowed in unhappiness. He could tell that she was sleeping soundly, but her sleeping posture was truly unsightly.He really could not get used to having a woman\u2014especially one who he had slept with\u2014share the same room with him. As such, he got up and walked out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Madam Gu, You Do Not Need to be FrugalAtlas StudiosThe next day, Lin Che opened her eyes to unfamiliar surroundings. It took her a few minutes to remember that she was now married.But where was her husband?She jumped off the bed. Everything on the couch had been returned to its original place, but the person on it was nowhere to be found.Lin Che left the room and went to the dining room. The maid bowed to her from the side. \u201cMadam, I\u2019ll lead you to the dining room.\u201dThe moment she arrived, she saw Gu Jingze bathed in sunlight. She walked over with light footsteps.His emotionless expression immediately lowered the temperature throughout the dining room by a few degrees.His well-defined body appeared even more upright in a suit. Without clothes, his body was muscular, only to appear leaner with clothes on. His face, which could make any woman heave a sigh, and his mysterious, dignified gaze made Lin Che\u2019s brow rise slightly after just a simple glance.\u201cHi. Good morning,\u201d she walked over to greet him.However, Gu Jingze simply raised his eyebrows and looked her once over. The casual clothes she was wearing had been prepared by the maids. They flattered and accentuated her figure. Gu Jingze lowered his head in silence. With his bony fingers, he reached for the white ceramic coffee cup on the table. He did not raise his head again.How cold and distant\u2026Lin Che pouted and sat down.Throughout the meal, they did not interact at all. When they left, the maid looked at Lin Che\u2019s unhappy face and said anxiously, \u201cMadam, Sir is not a bad person. Sometimes he\u2019s just grumpy in the morning, especially if he didn\u2019t get a good night\u2019s rest.\u201dLin Che asked, \u201cHe didn\u2019t sleep well last night?\u201dThe maid replied, \u201cYes. Sir woke up in the middle of the night and went to the study room to sleep, so he didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201dLin Che opened her mouth slightly in surprise and was at a loss for words.She came to a realization after thinking about it.He had been forced to marry her because of the accident. Understandably, he probably felt uncomfortable, especially when he loved another woman. It was unlikely he felt happy sleeping with her in the same room.Sighing, she thought to herself.Gu Jingze is also pitiable; he\u2019s an unusually privileged person, but he\u2019s afflicted with such a strange illness.Putting it this way, it was because she had carelessly mistaken him for someone else that he lost the woman he loved and had to marry her instead. She suddenly felt as if she had separated a pair of lovebirds and began to blame herself.\u2026Lin Che packed up in preparation to go to the company. On her way out, she saw a group of people walking out noisily. When she looked more closely, she saw Gu Jingze leading them. His tall and lean figure made her think of a crane standing among chickens. His neatly tailored pants wrapped around his long legs which made large strides that were especially smooth and elegant. His gait diminished some of the aloofness in his eyes while his stern figure carried a slight indifference. An aura of calm authority could be naturally felt. He unhurriedly stepped through the double doors and seemed like he was about to leave.Lin Che chased after him in a hurry.\u201cWait for me. Wait for me.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s austere expression changed upon hearing her chatter. His eyebrows knitted together.He turned his head to see Lin Che wearing a flattering dress cinched at the waist. She was running towards him like a madman. His brow furrowed even more.However, her flailing black hair accentuated her white skin so that it seemed like snow. It made her appear cleaner and tidier. He drew in a long breath, turned his gaze away, and continued walking out.\u201cTake me along, Gu Jingze. I\u2019m going to the company.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get someone to send you there,\u201d he said curtly while looking straight ahead.\u201cOh\u2026 Okay. You can just bring me to the bus stop. There\u2019s no need to waste a car on me.\u201dGu Jingze frowned. \u201cThe Gu family is not so poor that their Madam has to save money on transport by taking the public bus.\u201dHis gaze rested on her face and after some contemplation, he said, \u201cGet in.\u201dHearing this, Lin Che quickly stumbled after Gu Jingze, eager to save two dollars.Gu Jingze\u2019s car was huge. It was not the car that they had taken yesterday. Inside, the seats were made of leather and had a fresh smell to them. Gu Jingze looked down at the marks that her shoes had left and frowned, \u201cWhy are your shoes so dirty?\u201dLin Che looked down and saw an unsightly footprint. She laughed in embarrassment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have shoes.\u201dSeeing Gu Jingze\u2019s impeccable eyebrows twist again, she curled her lips and said, \u201cWhat are you dissatisfied about? It\u2019s not like I wanted it to happen; these are my only pair of shoes.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. She was dressed messily and her slender, long legs could be vaguely seen.He inspected her clothes\u2014it was the same set of clothing that she had worn yesterday and she looked ridiculously shabby.He said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to buy some clothes first.\u201dHearing this, Lin Che blurted out, \u201cMy clothes are fine. It\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t bring them over. When there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll go back, get my things, and bring them over.\u201dBut Gu Jingze had already instructed the driver, \u201cFind a place where we can buy clothes for the Madam.\u201dThe driver immediately took a U-turn.Lin Che was embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary. It will be too troublesome for you.\u201dGu Jingze swept his eyes over her clothes. He did not know where she had bought the dress; it had been washed so many times that it was obviously old. She had probably worn it numerous times.\u201cYour clothes are too dirty. I feel uncomfortable just looking at them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFine then. Since it makes him comfortable, he can buy whatever he wants.To think that she had thought he was being nice.\u201cThis is called being frugal. What do you know?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re used to treating shabbiness as thriftiness, but that\u2019s not a habit of mine.\u201d His eyes were, as usual, indifferent.Lin Che said, \u201cYes, of course. It\u2019s good to be rich. You can change your clothes every day. I don\u2019t have many, so I wear each piece of clothing for a long time. How many times do you think I\u2019ve worn this piece? It cost several hundred yuan. Of course, I won\u2019t throw it away until I\u2019ve worn it out.\u201dGu Jingze looked at Lin Che. \u201cThe Lin family shouldn\u2019t be that poor.\u201dLin Che smiled while looking at him. \u201cSo you investigated me pretty thoroughly.\u201d\u201cNaturally. You think I would casually marry a woman without investigating her?\u201dLin Che fiddled with her sleeves. \u201cBut didn\u2019t you just find out that I\u2019m an illegitimate daughter of the Lin family? My father never treated me as a part of the Lin family. As a child, I lived with the nanny. It was only when he saw that I had grown up and had value that he gave me a room. When I was younger, my clothes were always hand-me-downs from Lin Li and Lin Yu. Even if the clothes had been washed repeatedly or even torn, they were still nice clothes. I would always ask the nanny to mend them for me and continue wearing them.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyebrows twitched. As he looked at her, his gaze began to settle.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon, the two of them arrived at a branded fashion store.The moment they stepped in, Gu Jingze swept his gaze across the store and said to the salesperson following them, \u201cGive me all the clothes in her size.\u201dSeeing how decisive Gu Jingze was, the salesperson\u2019s eyes began to light up. He quickly led Lin Che further inside.Lin Che was a little dumbstruck. This was the first time she was experiencing how the rich went shoppingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It wrapped around her body and instantly brightened up her appearance tremendously.Inside, Lin Che tried each piece one by one. The salesperson enthusiastically assisted her with a great attitude.To the side, Gu Jingze sat elegantly on a chair, drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Although Lin Che had politely declined, it was apparent that she had never seen such a scene once they arrived. She went around the store, looking at everything with a constant wide-eyed surprise.It really seemed as if she had never worn nice clothes.However, when he raised his head, Lin Che stood before him in a jade-green gown. It accentuated her bright and fair skin and rendered it almost translucent. She looked like a stream after a rain: refreshing and pleasing. Her long and slender legs were also exposed. On the whole, she appeared sensual and beautiful with a hint of cuteness.The salesperson smiled as she complimented, \u201cThis piece is perfect for you, Madam. You look beautiful in it.\u201dLin Che felt embarrassed at the praise.Gu Jingze looked on. It was undeniable that she looked good in the dress.Although she usually looked sloppy and uncultured, she currently appeared graceful and was full of feminine charm.He could not help but steal two more glances. When he saw Lin Che turn her head, he quickly directed his gaze elsewhere.Gu Jingze was very satisfied. He gestured for someone to foot the bill and said to the salesperson, \u201cWrap up everything in the store that suits her and send it to the Gu villa.\u201dLin Che was shocked. She looked at Gu Jingze with light beaming from her eyes.He was too rich.Naturally, the salesperson was extremely happy. She politely walked them out the door and watched with envy as Lin Che jogged up to the luxurious Porsche outside and got into the car.Soon, they arrived at the company. She thanked him before getting out of the car quickly.Yu Minmin brought Lin Che to the grand hall of a seven-star hotel where auditions were taking place. While walking, she said sternly, \u201cThere\u2019s a role for you to try out today. If you run off halfway like you did the last time, don\u2019t ever come to the company again. You really think you\u2019re Lin Li? If you want to pick and choose your roles, then be like her. Even if she\u2019s not insanely famous, at least she\u2019s a big celebrity. Otherwise, you better take your auditions seriously and stop coming up with silly ideas.\u201dLin Che thought to herself,Lin Li had the full financial support of the Lin family so of course, she is famous.On the other hand, her stepmother had gone to great lengths to stunt her development. Also, Lin Li interfered whenever she got a role. Yet, she could not give up because of them. To do so would be the same as retreating before the fight had begun.\u201cAudition for the role properly today.\u201d Sister Yu continued, \u201cThe investor this time is very rich. He\u2019s from the Gu family, a well-known and mysterious family. No one knows how rich or powerful they are. Even if you fail the audition, you\u2019ll definitely make rapid advances in your career if he takes a liking to you.\u201dLin Che was no longer listening; her attention had completely shifted to Lin Li and Qin Qing who were walking toward her.Lin Li was slim and graceful whilst Qin Qing was tall and handsome. When the two of them walked side by side, all eyes turned towards them.\u201cWow, Lin Li.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s probably her fianc\u00e9 beside her. I heard that they\u2019re getting engaged soon. Her fiance\u2019s family is very rich and he\u2019s a second-generation heir.\u201d\u201cHer fianc\u00e9 is really handsome. They\u2019re a perfect match.\u201d\u201cLin Li is really lucky.\u201dBefore Lin Che could turn around and leave, she heard Qin Qing call out, \u201cLin Che? Why are you here?\u201dLin Che froze and looked back reluctantly. She saw Lin Li glare at her distastefully as they walked towards her.Lin Che smiled faintly at Qin Qing, \u201cI came for an audition.\u201dQin Qing stared at her clothes. He seemed to be thinking that she was different from her usual careless and loud self.She looked much more refreshing and even gave off a feminine charisma.\u201cWhere did you go? Your family has been looking for you.\u201d Qin Qing was still unaware of the circumstances. He only knew that the Lin family was in chaos. Han Caiying was always cursing Lin Che, calling her an ungrateful wretch and a total ingrate.Lin Che laughed bitterly and looked at Lin Li\u2019s smug expression, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be staying with a friend in the future. I won\u2019t be going back to the Lin residence.\u201dLin Li complained to Qin Qing, \u201cAh Qing, you have no idea how anxious the family is. She\u2019s too insensible. My mother stayed awake all night out of worry, but she\u2026\u201dLin Che snorted. Her stepmother was probably unable to sleep out of anger at having failed to sell her off.Lin Che did not want to watch her act any longer. She said coldly, \u201cI still have an audition. Qin Qing, you guys go ahead.\u201dStaring longingly at Qin Qing, she clenched her fist tightly.Suddenly, sounds of exclamation arose from behind them.They looked back in astonishment, only to see a neat row of the best bodyguards clear a path to reveal Gu Jingze behind them. He was dressed in all black like a knight of the dark night, mysterious and aloof.Lin Che was stupefied. Seeing him here, she felt like she was dreaming.Lin Li\u2019s sparkling eyes were already glued to him. She watched the tall and handsome man walk past her without so much as a side-glance. With his arrogant expression and cold brow, he looked like a lofty emperor who did not permit anyone to get close to him.\u201cAh, Qin Qing, who\u2019s that? He looks really familiar,\u201d she asked Qin Qing, unable to hide her curiosity.On the other hand, Lin Che wanted to bury herself in the ground because she saw Gu Jingze shooting a look at her.Lin Li\u2019s exclamation instantly jolted her out of her daze. She saw Lin Li lower her head and say, \u201cIs he looking at me\u2026\u201dLin Che could not bear to stay there any longer. Whilst the place was in chaos, she ran out.After some time, she suddenly heard Lin Li\u2019s voice from behind her.\u201cLin Che, it would be best you go home.\u201dLin Che turned her head and said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m never going back.\u201dLin Li sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know about your motives towards Qin Qing. You\u2019re not good enough for him. He\u2019s about to get engaged to me soon and become your brother-in-law. If you\u2019re human, stop trying to flirt with him. Look at your status; you\u2019re an illegitimate daughter. Yet you still dare to have delusional thoughts about a rich young master like Qin Qing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che\u2019s heart writhed, as Lin Li looked at her smugly. \u201cAt first, you still had a chance to squeeze into the upper ranks of society by becoming the young madam of the Cheng family. It\u2019s a pity that you weren\u2019t tactful. What? You thought that you could have a chance with Qin Qing?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re done, can I leave now?\u201d If it was anyone else, she would have been fine. But she could not tolerate it when Qin Qing was mentioned.Lin Che took large strides towards the exit but was pulled back roughly by Lin Li.\u201cWhat kind of attitude are you showing me?!\u201d Lin Li sneered and said, \u201cIf you turn around now and lick the dirt off my shoes, I might let you have this role. Otherwise, as long as I\u2019m around, don\u2019t ever think of getting involved in any major productions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A slight shyness immediately showed on her beautiful face as she said gently to Lin Che, \u201cAnyway, you must come home soon. Lin Che, I\u2019m ultimately your older sister and I hope you\u2019ll live well.\u201dLin Che stared in confusion at her change in attitude and turned around.She did not know when Gu Jingze\u2019s distant and silent figure had appeared behind her.At once, Lin Li looked towards this man with starry-eyed infatuation.Looking towards his perfectly-sculpted face, she squeezed her breasts together as hard as she could. Fortunately, she had just gone for some breast treatment and was looking her best at this time.She had initially thought that Qin Qing was already perfect; he was immensely rich and handsome. However, in front of this man, he would definitely be ashamed of his inferiority.It was obvious from his extraordinary aura that he was not just any ordinary man.Lin Li was about to lose her mind from staring at that face that could make any woman shy.However, Gu Jingze merely glanced at Lin Li calmly before fixing his gaze on Lin Che\u2019s frightened face.She was as white as a ghost, a far cry from her warm and soft complexion this morning. Her long eyelashes were trembling slightly and her lower lids were tinged with a greenish-blue color. She looked like a puppy that had just been abandoned.\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che with an expressionless face.Lin Che shivered. She raised her head with difficulty and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cCome with me.\u201d He did not spare Lin Li a further glance. Instead, he walked straight ahead with long strides.Lin Che froze momentarily. She looked at Lin Li\u2019s contorted face beside her. From behind him, Gu Jingze\u2019s assistant looked pointedly at her, indicating for her to follow after him. Without much of a choice, Lin Che hurried after him.She left behind a pale-faced Lin Li who stood there and shouted in surprise, \u201cLin Che knows him?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Lin Che is nothing. She can\u2019t even be considered a D-list celebrity.\u201d\u201cBut who exactly is this man? He has a noble air about him.\u201dLin Li was a connoisseur. She knew that the hand-made Italian suit that the man was wearing was not something that just anyone could buy. That designer brand was extremely expensive; Qin Qing had wanted to buy it but failed to reserve a suit for the engagement party.Lin Li could not help but feel a little jealous. She glared at Lin Che\u2019s retreating back with hatred.Lin Che followed Gu Jingze towards the exit.\u201cThanks for your help earlier,\u201d she said to Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze did not move his head but glanced at her sideways, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a role that I wanted to audition for, so I came to meet the director with the hope that I could get a chance to audition.\u201dGu Jingze replied her with an \u201coh\u201d and inspected her azure-green outfit. She looked stunning and eye-catching.\u201cOkay. Look for me here after you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201dLin Che nodded. \u201cOkay, but why are you here?\u201d\u201cThis hotel is owned by the Gu family,\u201d he said monotonously.So that\u2019s why, Lin Che thought in surprise.A hotel this big\u2026Lin Che said goodbye and left to handle her matters.Watching her leave, Gu Jingze turned to his side and asked his assistant Qin Hao, \u201cShe\u2019s here for an audition?\u201dLooking in the direction that the Madam left, Qin Hao said respectfully, \u201cYes. Madam is auditioning for a role in a fantasy drama that the Gu family is investing in to promote our hotels. Filming will begin soon and Third Young Master is the male lead.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyes shifted to the door in the direction that Lin Che had left. He lowered his head and said to Qin Hao, \u201cGo out and make some arrangements\u2026\u201d*After Lin Che went in, she went to a great deal of effort before finding the director and producer. She then proceeded to walk over to them shamelessly.\u201cDirector Jiang, hello.\u201dThe director\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m Lin Che, an actress under Dynamic Pictures, I\u2026\u201dThe director immediately understood what she was here for and replied quickly, \u201cOh. if this is about the audition, look for the assistant. I\u2019m not in charge over such matters.\u201dOf course, Lin Che knew that every one of Director Jiang\u2019s works was insanely famous. Naturally, it was even more difficult to get close to him personally.But in this line of work, sometimes it was about being thick-skinned.\u201cI know that, Director Jiang. I\u2019m not here to ask for the role. I just wanted to see you and tell you that ever since I graduated from the drama academy, I\u2019ve looked up to you. I know that the dramas you\u2019ve directed have all been critically acclaimed and popular. Their impeccable quality has left people dumbfounded. Everyone knows that once Director Jiang helms a project, it will definitely be a blockbuster production with numerous awards, so I came to see you especially\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Director Jiang interrupted her expressionlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. There is no use flattering me. I\u2019ve seen countless actresses like you. If I say no, I mean no.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dLin Che still wanted to walk closer, but the director had turned around and gone inside without sparing her a glance.Lin Che could only chase after them, but she did not catch up to the director. Instead, a producer came out. Upon seeing Lin Che, he walked over to her with a friendly smile.\u201cHey, you must be Lin Che.\u201dLin Che was surprised. She quickly flashed her signature smile and said, \u201cProducer Chen, you know me?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve watched your shows. Although you didn\u2019t get many scenes, your acting is remarkable. Why? Do you want a role?\u201dLin Che blushed and said sheepishly, \u201cI\u2019m just hoping for a chance to audition.\u201dThe producer assessed her and his gaze began to soften, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll speak to the director. You can come for an audition a few days from now.\u201dLin Che looked at him with a pleasant surprise. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d He smiled and looked at her meaningfully. \u201cWork hard.\u201dThereafter, Lin Che returned to the luxurious lounge to look for Gu Jingze.He was seated inside where he was reading the documents in his hands. He looked up to see a hint of a smile at the ends of her eyebrows. When she smiled, her eyes crinkled up attractively.\u201cWhy do you seem to be in a good mood?\u201d he asked.Lin Che blurted out, \u201cYes, yes. A famous director agreed to let me try out for a role in one of his projects. I knew it; as long as I make a move, I will definitely succeed. Indeed, my name has already spread in the entertainment circle. The producer even knew my name! My golden days are about to come. Of course, I\u2019m happy. Hahahahaha.\u201dShe smiled and hooked her arm around Gu Jingze\u2019s, swinging it happily.Gu Jingze lowered his head and looked at her errant hand in a speechless manner.Her pale and white fingers were randomly stroking across his arm in an inviting manner.Lin Che was still swaying, but when she met his gaze, she suddenly felt that something was wrong and quickly let go.\u201cSorry, sorry. I was momentarily dizzy with success and didn\u2019t notice. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze glared at her. But he did not feel like his illness was about to flare up. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201dLin Che jogged after him.A swarm of tall and burly bodyguards gathered to clear a path for him. They opened the door for him with their imposing appearances as if he was an emperor on a private visit. Their auras were extraordinary.Looking at him, Lin Che felt that he was truly different from the rest. \u201cGu Jingze, are you some big shot?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked at his perfect side profile and admired the attractive angle of his jaw. From the side, he looked like a flawless sculpture. The more she looked, the more she began to fall into a daze.Gu Jingze stole a glance and happened to see her legs spreading wide open, slightly exposing her white safety pants. Its outline was obvious to the eye.His brows furrowed. \u201cCan you sit more properly like a woman?\u201dLin Che stiffened. She lowered her head and looked at her dress before quickly closing her legs.Seriously. How could she have forgotten that she was wearing a dress?Lifting her head, her eyes met Gu Jingze\u2019s disapproving ones. She said in a nonplussed manner, \u201cAs if you\u2019ve never seen it before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened. \u201cCan you bear some semblance of a woman?\u201d\u201cWill you not divorce me if I bear some semblance of a woman?\u201d She retorted fiercely, rendering Gu Jingze speechless.This was the first time a woman dared to yell at him; he was momentarily unable to adapt.\u201cMiss Lin, I just hope that our marriage will be more comfortable for the both of us. Shouldn\u2019t you take some responsibility for this too? After all, this entire incident arose because of you.\u201d\u201cHa, you\u2019re speaking as if I forced you to pull my clothes off that night. The only thing I did was make you hard. I didn\u2019t make you strip the clothes off me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s face appeared even more serene. \u201cBut I remember that you enjoyed it greatly. You also hugged me and wouldn\u2019t let go until the end. I even remember that you loved biting your fingers when you got aroused. Your face also got so red that it looked like blood could drip out of it.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face immediately reddened. Under his unwavering gaze, the heat in her face made her feel like she was burning.\u201cI-I-I-I don\u2019t remember at all. It must be your imagination. I clearly recall it being very painful. Because it was your first time, you knew nothing and you weren\u2019t gentle at all.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d All of a sudden, his face came close and appeared right before her. As he looked at her reddened face, he felt that she was tender like this, her feminine charm radiating off her gently. There was a hint of mischief in his deep and dark eyes.Lin Che quickly leaned back as she watched his gaze that was so deep it was like an abyss.The narrowed distance caused the air in the entire car to suddenly heat up. It was as if something suspicious was fermenting. The warmth of his body spread towards her and made her her bones resonate at the appearance of a true man\u2026\u201cSee, just like this.\u201d He smiled as he looked at the color of her face. \u201cDo you want me to take a picture and show you?\u201dLin Che slapped his hand away and sat back in her seat. They each looked out the window like nothing happened.However, the heat in the car was still palpable and continued to increase slowly in intensity.Lin Che\u2019s face was burning to the extent that she did not dare turn to look at the man beside her.How could she forget? That was her first time, but she had given it away so carelessly and had been tormented so terribly.With her hand on her face, she thought despondently,Was her face really that red?Then, the chauffeur broke the awkward air between the two people.\u201cSir, Madam, we have arrived.\u201dLin Che opened the car door in a hurry.However, her arm was suddenly pulled back by the man behind her.She looked back and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dGu Jingze said, amused, \u201cWhy are you running away? Could it be that you\u2019re shy?\u201d\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d Lin Che pushed his hand away and walked quickly into the house.\u201c\u2026\u201d As he looked at her retreating figure, Gu Jingze shook his head.Gu Jingze got out from the car slowly and leisurely. He was in a pleasant mood as he watched Lin Che flee for her life.Lin Che had merely walked a few steps when she saw an unfamiliar woman standing by the door. She was an elegant beauty and instantly brought to mind the four words \u201cwell-bred young lady\u201d.Lin Che froze.Behind her, Gu Jingze stopped in his tracks and looked at the woman. He called out in a slightly hoarse voice, \u201cHuiling\u2026\u201dMo Huiling was his girlfriend.Once she saw the woman, Lin Che seemed to understand what type of woman Gu Jingze truly liked.With her long hair swaying in the wind, her bright and beautiful face made her look exactly like a well-bred young lady from afar. She was clothed in a white, suited jacket. Underneath that was a grey dress. She looked bright, intelligent, graceful, and generous. It was obvious with one look that she was a \u201cfair and wealthy beauty\u201d through and through.Lin Che halted momentarily, uncertain of what she should do. She could only look at them in a daze, aware that she definitely looked very silly herself.With Gu Jingze standing beside her, they looked like a perfect match.She was obviously a stylish and fashionable woman. Naturally, she was not as clueless as Lin Che.If Gu Jingze stood together with her, they would definitely be the golden couple in everyone\u2019s eyes. They would be the subject of everyone\u2019s envy.When she turned around and saw Lin Che, her delicate chin raised slightly and she looked at Lin Che with an arrogant expression. After staring at Lin Che for some time, she then turned her gaze to rest on Gu Jingze.Upon seeing the loaded situation, Lin Che could only glance at Gu Jingze briefly and say sensibly, \u201cOh, my clothes haven\u2019t been washed. I\u2019ll go wash them now.\u201dShe then ran into the house hurriedly.Gu Jingze\u2019s brow furrowed as he watched her run away flustered. He turned his head to look at Mo Huiling.Mo Huiling snorted. She pointed at Lin Che as she said, \u201cWhat kind of woman did you bring home?!\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cDid you read the email that I sent you? I can\u2019t help that things have already progressed to this stage. I know that you\u2019ll be angry and sad, but all of this has become a reality. I didn\u2019t have a choice; this was a marriage that I had to accept.\u201cBecause my family thinks that she can make my illness better, they wanted me to marry her. I could only agree to it. I know that it might be very difficult for you to accept it now since I just informed you, but this is the reality. If you leave me because of this, I will accept it. Hate me, scold me, ask me for compensation\u2026 I will accept all of it. I betrayed our promise, so I\u2019ll accept anything you want me to do.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s shoulders were trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hit you. How could I bear to?

Before the marriage, I didn\u2019t even know her name. My family forced me to marry her; I really had no choice. When there\u2019s an opportunity in the future, I\u2019ll divorce her.\u201dAt this, Mo Huiling lifted her head and looked at him, her eyes glistening with tears. \u201cReally?\u201dGu Jingze nodded. \u201cBoth of us agreed upon this from the start.\u201dGu Jingze and Mo Huiling were childhood sweethearts. It was only because he suddenly fell ill and could no longer touch women that they could not be together.

She said carefully, \u201cMadam, Sir and Miss Mo are childhood friends so they are very close. However, their relationship is unstained; nothing has happened between the two of them.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lin Che knew that the maid had misunderstood. She waved her hands frantically and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. Of course, their relationship should be good\u2026 but have they known each other for a very long time?\u201dThe maid said, \u201cYes. They knew each other from the moment they were born.\u201dFor such a long time, Lin Che thought.\u201cThen, their relationship must be great,\u201d Lin Che said.The maid said, \u201cYes, Miss Mo has a bad temper, but Sir always gives in to her. It has been like this since they were young. But I think that this is no different from a relationship between siblings. Madam, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t get angry. After all, you know that Sir\u2026\u201dHas a strange illness and can\u2019t touch women at all.Naturally, Lin Che knew.Deep down, she truly felt that Gu Jingze was in an unfortunate circumstance.The woman he loved was right beside him, but he could not touch her. She did not know how he had endured it for all these years.Lin Che was not angry. She was just a little curious.She said to the maid, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019m not angry and just wanted to ask. I can understand Gu Jingze; I won\u2019t get angry.\u201dUpon seeing Lin Che like this, the maid\u2019s impression of her became even more favorable. She smiled and said, \u201cMadam, you\u2019re the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve met and you even have a good personality. You and Sir get along so well; you\u2019ll definitely live happily in the future.\u201dLin Che was not angry. From the beginning, they had agreed that this was a marriage by contract and Gu Jingze had been honest and straightforward with her. Thus, there was no reason to be angry.Lin Che said, \u201cBut if the relationship between Gu Jingze and Miss Mo is so good, why can\u2019t they get the approval from their families?\u201dThe maid said, \u201cMiss Mo is the Third Young Miss of the Mo family, but Old Master never liked her because he doesn\u2019t approve of the Mo family\u2019s conduct. Nevertheless, he was never strongly opposed to it. However, Sir suddenly fell ill. The family had always hoped that he would find someone to bear him children, but Sir was too stubborn and refused to leave Miss Mo. Miss Mo also kept making a fuss and did not want Sir to marry any other woman. That\u2019s why the situation stagnated.\u201dWhen the maid saw Lin Che listening intently, she smiled and said, \u201cEverything is fine now. Sir and Madam are a great match. Madam is so beautiful and Sir is so handsome. The Little Master who you will give birth to in the future will definitely be the best-looking man.\u201dLin Che almost spat out blood.Of course, she did not want to have children with Gu Jingze. In any case, it was impossible. The last time, he had only touched her because she had drugged him. She was definitely not the antidote to heal his illness.Lin Che found it strange.Why did they not find more women to try curing his illness?But after thinking about it, she understood. Perhaps it was because Gu Jingze was deeply in love with Mo Huiling so he did not want to touch any other woman. But now, because of her\u2026Lin Che ate while she ruminated. Then, Gu Jingze walked into the house.He saw Lin Che wolfing down the food as she sat on the couch with her legs raised in a terribly uncouth fashion.Gu Jingze frowned and said, \u201cCan you be more hygienic?\u201dLin Che raised her head. \u201cI\u2019ve washed my hands. How is that not hygienic?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her eating with her bare hands that had crumbs all over them. His frown deepened.Lin Che lifted her head and said, \u201cYes, not everyone is as well-bred as Miss Mo. You\u2019re right. I have no manners even when I\u2019m eating. My mother passed away when I was in my teens. My father never treated me as his daughter and my stepmother wanted to sell me off for money, so no one taught me any manners or etiquette. However, not everyone has time to bother with manners and etiquette like you people. To me, living is already respecting myself. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t know about all these things and I\u2019ll never be Miss Mo.\u201dLooking at Gu Jingze, she said, \u201cOkay. If you\u2019re uncomfortable watching me eat, I\u2019ll try not to eat in front of you. Then again, you probably won\u2019t be home often.\u201dSince he had Miss Mo, he probably prefered to spend more time with her instead of staying at home with Lin Che all the time.Gu Jingze snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Huiling is indeed a well-bred young lady. At least she doesn\u2019t eat with her bare hands like you do.\u201dAs he said this, his gaze rested on her greasy hands.Lin Che looked down. She did feel a little embarrassed, but she was also used to this and did not mind it.Lin Che quickly licked her fingers one by one; the tip of her tongue was extremely flexible.It was torturous to live with this kind of man. It was no wonder people said that it was important to marry within your own class. She and Gu Jingze were the perfect negative example.She lifted her head and looked at Gu Jingze only to discover that his gaze had heated up. He was staring fixedly at her face, his eyes red. He looked as if he was about to tear her into pieces.What had she done to anger him again?Lin Che blurted, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. I won\u2019t eat in front of you again.\u201dShe had no choice either; habits could not be changed so quickly.Of course, his Miss Mo was definitely elegant and gracious, but she was not her.She smiled sheepishly, but Gu Jingze simply walked away gloomily without a word.\u201cHey, I\u2026\u201d She looked at him in confusion.\u201cDon\u2019t casually stick your tongue out to lick your fingers.\u201d He suddenly looked back at her, his eyes staring at her fingers. \u201cEspecially in front of the opposite sex.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Che quickly looked down at her own fingers and wiggled them. She was confused and did not know what he meant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze shook his head speechlessly and thought that the woman\u2026 was truly dumb.Soon afterward, Lin Che ran into the bedroom after washing up.Gu Jingze was seated on the couch with his legs crossed, one ankle over his other knee. His freshly scented self looked elegant and composed. With the light beaming down on him, the angles of his body appeared even sharper. He had a casual disposition, but he looked good no matter how he sat.She stopped in her tracks to look at him before quietly walking further in. However, he suddenly called after her, \u201cMiss Lin.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You don\u2019t have to keep calling me Miss Lin. It\u2019s quite uncomfortable.\u201dGu Jingze paused and finally nodded. \u201cOkay, Lin Che.\u201dHe looked at her meaningfully. \u201cWhat happened today won\u2019t happen again in the future\u2026 she really doesn\u2019t come here often. It\u2019s probably because she hasn\u2019t fully adjusted her emotions.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine. In any case, it\u2019s understandable for her to be angry. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate it either. I would definitely come over to investigate my enemy, so I completely understand. Just focus on your relationship with her.\u201dGu Jingze raised his eyebrows. As he watched her clarify herself in a flustered manner, his gaze deepened before he lowered his head again.The next day.Lin Che followed Yu Minmin to the venue for her audition.Yu Minmin said coolly to her, \u201cThis television series is a mythological drama based on a novel, so it has a hefty background. The male lead is Gu Jingyu and the female lead is Mu Feiran. The role you\u2019re trying out for is a supporting role as a ghost hunter. It\u2019s one of the important roles, so it\u2019ll definitely be good for you to get the role.\u201dLin Che nodded her head in understanding. Although she felt that such an important role would not usually be given to her, she seldom got opportunities to audition for such roles. Naturally, she looked forward to the audition.\u201cI\u2019m grateful to the company for giving me this opportunity,\u201d she said.Yu Minmin gave her a meaningful look. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say that. You fought hard for it yourself. To be honest, I didn\u2019t have high hopes for you, but since you\u2019re already here, I hope you\u2019ll do well.\u201dLin Che nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll work hard, Sister Yu.\u201dLin Che was already accustomed to these types of auditions. She had specially put on a short blue dress and primped herself. Looking fresh and clean, she stood and waited at the venue.\u201cNext, Lin Che.\u201dThe director and staff heard the name from inside and started looking through her portfolio. As an unknown actress, she was definitely refreshing. However, such an important role was not typically given to new actresses. It appeared as though she was just another actress that some investor had squeezed into the lineup.The director thought this to himself despondently as he casually took a cigarette.However, when he raised his head, he instantly saw a girl who looked honest and sincere. She lowered her head and bowed respectfully. When she looked up, there was a slight blush to her face. Her eyes were like lakes that rippled slightly and when the light shone on her white ceramic-like face, her fluttering eyelashes left faint shadows on her lower lids. Her lips were like the petals of cherry blossoms. They could make one drool with desire and create disturbances within hearts.In this industry where plastic surgery had become a custom, it was truly rare to see a young actress who was naturally beautiful in appearance.He quickly looked down and flipped through her portfolio.Lin Che, 23, female. She was a true-blue rookie actress. Some of the roles she had taken up did not even have names.However, her ethereal appearance as she stood there was truly unforgettable.The entire room quietened. It was as if one could have heard a pin drop in the silence. Everyone\u2019s attention was on the ethereal-looking girl on stage. Decked out in blue, she made one feel as if they had fallen deep into a lake where they kept drifting without any chance of escape.Lin Li was also here for an audition. When she pulled open the curtain and saw Lin Che in the front, her brow furrowed. Looking at everyone\u2019s reactions, she could not help but think bitterly that Lin Che looked flashy today.Since when had this lass grown to look so exquisite?Lin Che drew in a long breath and recited a passage that she was holding in her hands. When she finished, she felt that she had not done particularly well and was a little unconfident. She looked up to meet everyone\u2019s gaze and felt even more embarrassed. In her heart, she thought apprehensively that she had messed up again this time. But then again, she had not expected anything from this. During the few years after graduating from the drama academy, she had gone for countless auditions like these. She had gotten used to failure a long time ago.\u201cDirector, I\u2019ve finished my performance.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The director was looking through her portfolio and seemed to not see her.Lin Che walked out quietly.Unexpectedly, Yu Minmin walked over to her before she left. She sounded pleasantly surprised yet shocked at the same time as if she could not believe it, \u201cLin Che, you\u2019ve been chosen for the role of the ghost hunter, Chen Yihan. Go back and prepare for it. The company will make the contractual arrangement on your behalf.\u201dLin Che thought that she had heard wrong and did not respond for a long time.She had been chosen? It was too shocking.She initially didn\u2019t have a lot of hope, but she now felt as if she had won the lottery.\u201cThank you Sister Minmin. I\u2019ll definitely go back and prepare well.\u201dYu Minmin looked at her meaningfully again before smiling. \u201cOkay, go back and prepare.\u201dShe really had not expected to be chosen this time. The role was a critical one and there were many candidates trying for the role while she was just a rookie.Lin Che was in a fantastic mood when she went home; however, the moment she stepped into the house, she immediately saw a woman inside seated on the couch that Gu Jingze usually sat on.Mo Huiling\u2019s actually here.Lin Che thought to herself. Although she was in a fake marriage with Gu Jingze, it was still felt awkward meeting Mo Huiling.She hoped that he would choose some other place for their dates in the future. This was too awkward.However, since Mo Huiling was seated there, she still smiled and greeted her. \u201cHi, you\u2019re here. I\u2019ll go in first. You guys go ahead.\u201dMo Huiling stood up and snorted. She looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cWhy are you running away and avoiding me? We\u2019ll have to meet sooner or later.\u201dWhat?Lin Che was dumbfounded. But very quickly, she detected a slight chill in Mo Huiling\u2019s gaze. It was obvious.Mo Huiling looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cAlthough Jingze told me yesterday that he was merely forced into this marriage by his family, I don\u2019t know what method you used to gain the Gu family\u2019s approval. However, I still want to make things clear to you. I\u2019ve been together with Jingze from a young age. We\u2019re childhood sweethearts and have always been in a loving relationship. Your little tricks won\u2019t be able to separate us. I hope you\u2019ll understand your position. I know that Jingze is nice, but he has reputation and status. It\u2019d be best for you to understand that he\u2019s out of your reach!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euInstantly, Lin Che\u2019s favorable impression of her vanished without a trace.As she looked at the elegant and gracious woman before her, Lin Che laughed sarcastically and said, \u201cSince Miss Mo has already said that you trust him completely, then there\u2019s no need for you to tell me any of this. You can rest assured, Miss Mo. I didn\u2019t want to marry him either. It was a complete accident. I won\u2019t interfere with your relationship. As you said, you trust one another. Please continue trusting him.\u201dUpon seeing Lin Che\u2019s nonchalance, Mo Huiling\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYes, I trust him but I can\u2019t neglect the fact that he\u2019s so outstanding. So many women have been interested in him. You are not the first or the last. Miss Lin, I am warning you to be careful. Jingze loves me and only me. He won\u2019t be moved by any other woman. If I find out that you\u2019ve done something to him, I won\u2019t spare you.\u201dLin Che snorted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dressed in luxurious clothes from head to toe, she shone brightly. Combined with her haughty expression, she appeared even more superior. \u201cHuh, don\u2019t think that you can truly have Jingze just because you married him. I\u2019ll tell him directly that I don\u2019t like him being with you. I\u2019ll tell him to leave this place and live with me. Even if you\u2019re married, you won\u2019t ever see him again. All of your ulterior motives will be useless!\u201dHow did you become his wife when I am the one he loves?Although Mo Huiling had a haughty expression on her face, Lin Che could tell that she felt angry and helpless.Although this woman was distasteful, she was, in fact, a pitiful woman.Perhaps it was a shortcoming of these wealthy families that marriage was not by choice.They were all victims; she indeed pitied Mo Huiling.But if she was so sad, why did she have to hide it? Why couldn\u2019t they fight it out once? As for Mo Huiling, she came to Lin Che instead of kicking up a fuss with Gu Jingze.Lin Che thought to herself,She did not know that things were so complicated. Otherwise, she would not have agreed easily. Who knew that he still had a girlfriend who loved him so deeply?Lin Che said directly, \u201cIf he ends up living with you, I\u2019ll be happy for the both of you too. You can tell him to do that.\u201dMo Huiling truly hated Lin Che. The more she looked at her, the more she disliked her, especially since a person of such lowly status like her was surprisingly Gu Jingze\u2019s wife.Lin Che was quite beautiful; her skin was white and soft, and she was young. While she looked honest, people like these were the most scheming.Mo Huiling had to admit that her face was a bit too attractive. She could not be at ease by letting Gu Jingze continue living with Lin Che.Mo Huiling glared at her fiercely before lifting her head and leaving.When Gu Jingze returned home that night, the house was extremely quiet. Gu Jingze asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Madam?\u201dThe maid immediately replied, \u201cMadam is in the bedroom.\u201dGu Jingze walked towards the bedroom.He did not expect to see the sight of Lin Che\u2019s completely naked back greeting him when he pushed the doors open\u2026She was changing\u2026When the door opened, Lin Che got shocked and she almost jumped up in surprise.\u201cAh\u2026 Gu Jingze!\u201d She yelled. It would have been alright if she had only shouted, but the problem was that she turned around in surprise\u2026Now, it was not just her back that he had seen completely.Two soft lumps of flesh seemed to flash before his eyes, causing him pause.Lin Che frantically covered her chest and as she looked at the man in front of her, she said weakly, \u201cGu Jingze, do you know how to knock!?\u201dGu Jingze stared at her snowy white skin and her narrow shoulders; they looked pale and tender\u2026His heart thumped and he shifted his gaze slightly.Drawing in a breath, he said, \u201cThis seems to be my bedroom.\u201dLin Che froze. On second thought, this was indeed his house\u2026But that was not right.Lin Che said, \u201cHey, although it\u2019s your house, have you forgotten that we\u2019re married? After marriage, at least half of the house belongs to me. Until we get a divorce, I have a right to live in this house. In other words, this is also my bedroom.\u201dGu Jingze turned his head coolly. \u201cIt seems that you haven\u2019t forgotten that we\u2019re married. So it\u2019s alright even if you don\u2019t cover up like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che lowered her head, curious about the chill wafting across her body. She had forgotten to put on her clothes\u2026She frantically pulled on her clothes and draped them on quickly as she turned around.However, Gu Jingze had already walked further in as if nothing had happened. He opened the wardrobe, took out a folder, and left quietly.Lin Che stood there, watching him leave before taking a deep breath. She blinked a few times and thought to herself,This Gu Jingze\u2026 Mo Huiling mentioned that she would not permit him to live here, but here he is again.As Lin Che walked out, she adjusted her clothes uncomfortably.Gu Jingze was looking down at his documents. As if he had not seen her, he kept his head down.Lin Che walked over to him. She was unsure about how to approach him. After all, this person had many shortcomings. He might criticize her again if she said a word.When she was just about to leave, the person who had been looking down at his documents the entire time finally said something.\u201cWhat do you have to say?\u201dShocked, Lin Che patted her chest as she looked at Gu Jingze. She thought to herself,Why is this person always doing things all of a sudden and putting her at a loss about what to do?\u201cSo you knew I was here. Since you didn\u2019t look at me at all, I thought you didn\u2019t hear me, so I wanted to leave without disturbing you,\u201d Lin Che explained as she walked over to him.Gu Jingze raised his head to look at her. With his chin resting on one hand and his eyes hazy under the light, he was so charming that he could make anyone\u2019s heart skip a beat.\u201cI can smell your scent,\u201d he explained.Lin Che froze.Her face heated up slightly; did he not know that his words sounded a little intimate?Gu Jingze looked at the flushed red color on her white cheeks. Perplexed, he said, \u201cWhy is your face so red? Why? Are you sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYou\u2019re the one who is sick. No, you were sick to begin with. You forgot your medicine again.Lin Che denied, \u201cMy face isn\u2019t red at all.\u201dLin Che felt like she had been completely exposed and even taken advantage of.Lin Che thought to herself,She was really no match for him.Although she considered herself a professional actress, she seemed to behave less professionally than he did from the beginning. He had clearly separated business from personal matters.She believe that perhaps it was because he had someone he loved that he was able to separate his feelings.Compared to her, Gu Jingze was truly professional. The fact that he had no reaction to her naked body showed that he did not treat her as a woman at all. He was completely devoted to Mo Huiling.She could not lose to him, Lin Che thought.Gu Jingze watched the tiny changes in her expression. He raised his head again and asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me. Do you have something to say to me?\u201dHow did he know that Lin Che had something to say before she even spoke?Lin Che walked over to him and said, \u201cNothing much. I just wanted to know why you\u2019re home again.\u201dGu Jingze furrowed his brow in confusion. \u201cCan\u2019t I come home?\u201dLin Che looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s honest expression. She thought to herself perplexedly,Has Mo Huiling not tell him that she did not want him to live here?When she saw Gu Jingze wearing a doubtful expression again, Lin Che waved her hands frantically.She could not get between him and Mo Huiling. Since Mo Huiling had not said anything, she decided it was best Mo Huiling told him herself. Lin Che refused to get herself involved in their affairs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe shrugged her shoulders and said, \u201cI mean\u2026 I think you don\u2019t need to stay here all the time. After all, so many people live separately after marriage. Furthermore, you\u2019re so busy. Staying here all the time isn\u2019t good for you.\u201dGu Jingze squinted his eyes at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI just think that Miss Mo definitely feels upset about you constantly being with me. It\u2019s better if you don\u2019t live here.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyebrows twitched. He looked at her and said, \u201cI thought we agreed previously that this is my house.

She had no right to chase him out.\u201cAlright. If you put it like that, I can be the one to move out,\u201d Lin Che said sincerely.Gu Jingze\u2019s complexion seemed to dim slightly. He stopped staring at her and fiddled with the documents in his hands. \u201cIf you do that, my family will definitely get suspicious. They\u2019ll wonder if there are problems with our relationship and they may even suspect that we\u2019re in a fake marriage. If we don\u2019t live together, they\u2019ll definitely intervene and make sure we live together. Wouldn\u2019t that be more troublesome?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHis reasoning makes sense, Lin Che thought. Naturally, she had not thought as much as he did, but if she really tried to think of other ways, she believed she was able to think of a good excuse.\u201cIt\u2019s all because I\u2019m afraid that your girlfriend will be angry. If you\u2019re with me all the time, she\u2019ll definitely brood over the matter. Imagine how much that will affect your relationship.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Gu Jingze stood up abruptly. There was something dark in his expression, one that intimidated Lin Che momentarily, leaving her momentarily speechless.With the documents in his hand, he walked out. As he brushed past Lin Che, he said, \u201cJust play your role as Mrs. Gu. What happens between me and other women is none of your business.\u201dAfter Gu Jingze left with his things, Lin Che muttered to herself despondently, \u201cFine. It\u2019s all my fault for being so nosy. The goodness of a person is of no consequence to the ungrateful; since you can\u2019t understand my good will, I\u2019ll keep my hands off your matters from now on.\u201dSoon after, Gu Jingze returned to the guest room. He put down his folder before holding onto the table in an attempt to calm himself down.However, images of the earlier scene replayed in his mind and made him feel\u2026 irritated.As he breathed in deeply, he heard his phone ringing. The screen indicated that it was Mo Huiling.\u201cHuiling, you\u2019re looking for me?\u201d\u201cYes, Jingze. Can you come over to my house for a bit? I\u2019m alone and bored. I have something to talk to you about too.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cWhy? You have something to say to me?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve wanted to say it for a long time. Come over. I want to tell you in person.\u201dMo Huiling sounded like she had something special to say. Gu Jingze could not guess what it was.After being with Mo Huiling for so many years, he knew that she was a little petty. She was ultimately the young lady of a rich family and had been pampered from a young age. Although she was accomplished, had good manners, and was highly educated, she had a bit of a temper. He thought that it was normal and had always given in to her. So no matter how unyieldingly or casually she spoke to him, he was able to accept it.Gu Jingze arrived at her house in no time.Mo Huiling lived alone. Her apartment had an air of feminine elegance that always made him feel comfortable.When Gu Jingze entered, he saw Mo Huiling seated in the living room. She was clearly awashed in melancholy as she sat there, looking a little withered and lonely.Gu Jingze sighed before walking toward her.\u201cHuiling, why did you call me here?\u201dMo Huiling raised her head to look at Gu Jingze before mumbling softly, \u201cJingze\u2026 I know that you had no say in the marriage and that it wasn\u2019t your own decision, but I still feel a little upset.\u201dNaturally, Gu Jingze felt sympathetic, his heart softening when he saw her expression.When Mo Huiling looked at Gu Jingze, the lines of worry on her face made her look extremely miserable and helpless. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t feel upset and that I also shouldn\u2019t trouble you. But when I think about how you have another woman with you all the time, I just can\u2019t bear it\u2026\u201dGu Jingze looked at her and sighed, \u201cI understand. It\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m sorry for all of this, Huiling. I know that you\u2019re upset, but\u2026 I really had no choice but to accede to my family\u2019s demands. My grandfather plays his cards well; I can\u2019t make a single misstep.\u201dWorried that Mo Huiling would feel pressured, Gu Jingze did not tell her that his family was using her as a threat.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Mo Huiling raised her head, her eyes glistening. \u201cI understand you and I\u2019m willing to be by your side. I just hope that you can move out. Don\u2019t live with that woman. You have so many other properties. There\u2019s definitely somewhere you can live in. Let\u2019s live there together. I know that even so, we can\u2019t sleep on the same bed, but I just want to be by your side. I don\u2019t like that you\u2019re living with her.\u201dGu Jingze froze, never expecting Mo Huiling to make such a request.It was a reasonable request and he understood her. Knowing that he was living with Lin Che was worrying in itself. He had not told Mo Huiling that he had slept with Lin Che because he thought that it would never happen again. That incident was an accident and he did not want to worry Mo Huiling even more. But alas, Mo Huiling was already worried.No other woman would find his sudden marriage acceptable. Even if they had grown up together and trusted one another, he now had a wife.Mo Huiling was a well-bred young lady who came from the atypical Mo family. They had instilled in her good etiquette and manners. Even if she did not marry him, she was definitely going to marry a man suitable for her and no one was going to treat her unfairly. However, she had already sacrificed her dignity for him.But\u2026Gu Jingze said calmly, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201dWhen Mo Huiling heard this, disappointment instantly showed on her face.That was all?Gu Jingze said, \u201cHuiling, I understand how you feel and I know that you feel uncomfortable. That\u2019s why I said that if you\u2019re unhappy, you can leave and find happiness elsewhere. But I have my own concerns. I\u2019ll think about it. But for now, I can\u2019t make a hasty decision.\u201dBut subconsciously, Gu Jingze did not like living together with any woman. After all, he was still ill. He felt uncomfortable even if it was Mo Huiling. As for Lin Che, he had no choice. He was trying hard to get used to her. But even if he had a choice, he had no intention to live with Mo Huiling.When Mo Huiling heard his last line, she reluctantly broke into a smile, \u201cYou must keep your promise!\u201dAs Gu Jingze left in the back of his car, he looked out the window with a grim expression.Mo Huiling was the only girl who he had a close relationship with. It was specifically because they had been together for so many years that she tolerated the many symptoms of his illness. They could not hold hands, kiss, or do anything that lovers could do because the moment he touched her, he broke out in a rash. However, she continued to stay with him; he was greatly touched by this.During the many years they had been together, he was happy. Without a doubt, he wanted to marry her.However, he had suddenly slept with another woman\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Gu Jingze walked into the house, there was an aroma wafting through the air.It was nearly dawn, so the maids should have left long ago and returned to their chambers.If that was so, then it could only be\u2026When he made a turn into the kitchen, he saw Lin Che seated at the bar counter. One of her legs was resting on another chair, as she leaned herself against her knee. Her long and slender legs were pale and soft, and her skin was smooth and flawless. She was wearing only a pair of pants and a white tank top. In front of her was a hot bowl from which the aroma was emanating. Evidently, she was eating supper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He closed his eyes, exasperated. \u201cLin Che\u2026\u201dImmediately, Lin Che turned her head in surprise. When she saw Gu Jingze, she almost fell off her chair.\u201cGu Jingze, why don\u2019t you make a sound when you walk?\u201d she yelled. She patted her chest and said, \u201cI thought there was a ghost.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cYou were cooking?\u201dHe did not expect her to be able to cook. And it smelled pretty good too.Lin Che looked at her bowl of noodles. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, yes. This great chef was cooking the most delicious food on earth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSo she was eating instant noodles.And he even thought that it smelled good.Was it time for him to think about getting far away from this uncultured woman?Gu Jingze said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t know how to cook anything?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cI\u2026 I boil water pretty well. I\u2019ve never overcooked it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingze did not know how exactly this woman had grown up without learning how to do anything.Lin Che said, \u201cYou probably haven\u2019t eaten considering how you\u2019re home so late. Want some?\u201dLin Che pushed her bowl forward. Gu Jingze looked at what was in the bowl. It looked quite good. There were vegetables, meat, and eggs. Together with the soup, it looked good enough to sell and was very appetizing.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d As he said this, he licked his lips subconsciously.Gu Jingze stood there unmoving. When he felt Lin Che smile, he breathed in deeply and prepared to scold her.\u201cEating so late isn\u2019t good for the stomach,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if done once in a while. I don\u2019t usually eat this late, but I\u2019m in a good mood today so I\u2019m eating this to reward myself.\u201dShe picked up some noodles and moved them closer until they were right in front of him. With a persuasive expression, she smiled in anticipation as she moved her chopsticks closer to his lips.The aroma excited his taste buds and started a riot in his stomach. He looked at her in exasperation. \u201cOkay, okay, okay. I\u2019ll eat it. Get away from me,\u201d he said as a compromise.She quickly stuffed the noodles into his mouth.He chewed a few times, finding it actually quite tasty.\u201cToo salty,\u201d he remarked after swallowing.Although he said this, he ate bite after bite. Slowly and elegantly, he finished the entire bowl.She stared at him, dumbfounded. Gu Jingze merely raised his head and looked at her coolly. \u201cWhy?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cHave you never eaten instant noodles before? Why did you eat it as if you were eating a delicacy? I think all that\u2019s left for you to finish is the soup.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che\u2019s expression and asked in a confused manner, \u201cSo what?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that to have never eaten instant noodles before\u2026 your standard is really low. Instant noodles are one of life\u2019s most delicious enjoyments and you almost missed it. Luckily, you have me. Otherwise, you would have definitely regretted it to death.\u201dGu Jingze watched Lin Che speak with an exaggerated expression. He looked at her calmly and said, \u201cThis is junk food.\u201d\u201cDelicious junk food!\u201d Lin Che corrected him.Gu Jingze shook his head and looked at Lin Che silently.Lin Che patted her stomach and said, \u201cNow that I\u2019ve eaten my fill and in a good mood, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re in a really good mood.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cOf course. I\u2019m going to play the role of the third female lead soon. Even though it\u2019s the third female lead\u2026 the role appears through the entire series and it\u2019s a very popular series. In the future, I\u2019m going to be famous and successful. How can I not be in a good mood?\u201dAs Lin Che said this, she stood there happily and looked proud. Gleefully, she placed her hands on his shoulders.Gu Jingze frowned. He turned his head to the side and looked at her hand.However, she seemed to not be aware of herself and continued to show off. \u201cI never thought that I, Lin Che, would get my big break one day. It\u2019s a pity that Lin Li is the second female lead. I don\u2019t know if I have any scenes with her. I hope I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll puke when I see her.\u201dGu Jingze swept his eyes across her face, but his gaze still landed on her errant hand in the end.He let out a dry cough, raised his head, and looked at Lin Che somberly.As if she suddenly remembered something, Lin Che looked down.\u201cOh no. Sorry, sorry. I forgot.\u201d She frantically patted Gu Jingze\u2019s clothes as if she was smoothing out the wrinkles.Thereafter, she looked at Gu Jingze who did not seem too uncomfortable. Chewing on her fingertips, she said sheepishly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a loud and crass person. That\u2019s why I said that I might make you feel uncomfortable if we lived together.\u201dAs if he had thought of something, he looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cSo you still hope that I\u2019ll move out?\u201dLin Che looked at Gu Jingze as she said seriously, \u201cYes. We agreed that we would establish a mutually beneficial relationship during our marriage. So you can rest assured. Even if you live together with Miss Mo, I\u2019ll help you cover it up. You\u2019re probably busy most of the time too. I\u2019ll use that as an excuse if your family members suddenly come over. I can say that you went out, perhaps for a business trip or for a meeting; I have so many excuses. As long as you come back sometimes, it\u2019ll be fine. Anyway, if you want to leave with Miss Mo, just go. Don\u2019t worry about your family finding out. I\u2019ll definitely help you smooth it over.\u201dGu Jingze looked at Lin Che. His gaze was deep, secretive, and contemplative yet indifferent.Under his gaze, Lin Che felt her heart heating up.She felt that his gaze was too profound as if he could read a person\u2019s thoughts.His gaze was a bit too sensuous.Suddenly, Gu Jingze said, \u201cI won\u2019t move out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe continued, \u201cMoving out will be way too much trouble. And then there\u2019s still a huge problem. I don\u2019t trust your acting skills. With your stupidity, you definitely won\u2019t be able to cover up for me properly. If I move out and leave you here alone to deal with it, it\u2019s the same as leaving my problem in your hands. I\u2019m not used to letting people decide my life, especially to people of questionable intelligence like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che said angrily, \u201cIf you have something to say, say it properly. Don\u2019t insult me for no reason. What\u2019s wrong with my intelligence?\u201d But it was understandable for him to not trust her. After all, this concerned the safety of the woman he loved, so he definitely felt a lot of stress and could not easily trust others, especially her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che could not help but think that the conflict between the two of them was like something from a novel. She was the evil second female lead in the novel, the one who ruined the relationship between the two leads and became a hindrance.With a calm expression, Gu Jingze walked towards the door. \u201cThe conclusion is that you don\u2019t have to waste your time trying to chase me out. For now, we\u2019re definitely going to live our married life together. It\u2019d be best for you to get used to it and think about how to play the role of Mrs. Gu properly. Stop entertaining nonsensical thoughts!\u201dLin Che never expected him to think this badly of her. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for your own good. I just don\u2019t want to see lovers get separated.\u201dGu Jingze could not help but stop in his tracks. He sneered, \u201cHow thoughtful of you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We agreed on it and I\u2019m a person who\u2019s considerate towards other people.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened. Not wanting to look at Lin Che any longer, he headed upstairs directly.The next day, Lin Che did not see Gu Jingze when she woke up in the morning. Perplexed, she asked, \u201cWhere is Gu Jingze?\u201dThe maid replied, \u201cSir did not sleep well last night, so he left early in the morning.\u201dLin Che thought to herself,This person is obviously uncomfortable living with her, but he still insists on doing so.Sure enough, the power of love was noble. In order to protect Miss Mo from harm, he could really tolerate anything.Thinking of it that way, she began to pity Gu Jingze.But during the next few days, Gu Jingze did not come back at all. Lin Che thought to herself,Was it because Mo Huiling had said something that affected him, which prevented his return?If that was the case, it was probably good for the both of them\u2026After all, they were still not used to each other after such a long time. Living together indeed made both of them uncomfortable.But why did she feel slightly uneasy?When she pictured him with a woman like Mo Huiling, she just felt gloomy.It was definitely because Mo Huiling was too unpleasant. She did not want to see Mo Huiling get what she wanted.Filming for the television series was going to begin soon. Lin Che was to play the role of an upright yet evil Chen Yihan. The first filming site was in B City\u2019s filming studio, so on the day filming began, they gathered there. The sign on the door had the name of the series, \u201cSwords of Love\u201d, written on it. The novel had been insanely popular when it was released, so there was a lot of hype over the series even before filming had begun.Anticipation was further heightened because the male lead was Gu Jingyu.The opening party was to be held there and Lin Che was there to attend it.However, Lin Che did not know why she had suddenly become famous. Everyone in the production team seemed to know that the role of Chen Yihan had been given to a rookie actress and that she was this rookie actress.Everyone on set was a senior to her, so Lin Che could only walk around with a glass of wine and propose a toast to everyone. After some time, she felt her head begin to heat up.Then, she heard someone say that Mu Feiran had arrived.She was the female lead of the series and the most popular young actress in the mainland. When she entered, most of the attention shifted to her. She was followed by a few assistants and managers, commanding attention wherever she went.As Lin Che watched her, she really felt that Mu Feiran was quite beautiful. It was the first time she was so close to such a huge celebrity. Lin Che marveled at how she was indeed a huge celebrity. She had so many fans outside supporting her and wherever she went, there was a line of people waiting upon her.Without a doubt, she was the center of attention.But then, she saw Lin Li walk out in a pastel yellow dress. With the wind blowing at her, the dress fluttered slightly and made Lin Li look refreshing and pleasant.Immediately, some people went up to her to initiate a conversation. After all, Lin Li was quite popular. Although she was not as famous as Mu Feiran, she had just started to gain recognition and her future was bright.However, she did not command as much attention as Mu Feiran.A while later, she heard someone announce Gu Jingyu\u2019s arrival.From the moment he debuted, Gu Jingyu was insanely popular. Now, he was the newest male god that everyone knew about. When he stepped out of the celebrity van, the fans surrounding it started making a racket immediately. Their voices were piercing and deafening. The other celebrities in the van could not help but be envious.A top celebrity was a top celebrity. The moment he came out, a hoard of people rushed after him.Beside Lin Che, Yu Minmin quickly said to her, \u201cYou and Gu Jingyu have quite a few scenes together. Remember to try to get close to him. Go over to him later and greet him. Otherwise, your scenes together may be awkward.\u201dWith her mouth half-open, Lin Che looked at Gu Jingyu from a distance. He was tall and slender, his lips red and teeth white. He looked a little like Gu Jingze.Naturally, she now knew that the two of them were, after all, biological brothers.But no matter what, Gu Jingze was her husband by name. She felt a little weird meeting his younger brother like this.Before she could finish that thought, Yu Minmin pushed her forward and said, \u201cGo quickly.\u201dLin Che\u2019s eyes immediately met Gu Jingyu\u2019s familiar eyes.\u201cAh\u2026 Senior Jingyu, hello.\u201d She could only summon up the courage to greet him.The director hurriedly introduced her to him, saying that the role of Chen Yihan was to be played by Lin Che.Gu Jingyu looked at this rookie actress with slight interest, noticing that although the expression on her clean and natural face was a little blank, her gaze was bright and clear. She looked very eye-catching thanks to her extraordinary pale skin.In this industry replete with beautiful women who were starting to look more and more alike, she gave off a very different vibe.He smiled as he said, \u201cHey, am I scary?\u201d\u201cHuh? No, no way.\u201d\u201cThen why do you seem afraid to look at me?\u201d He smiled sweetly as he stared at her round and astute eyes.Of course, Lin Che felt uncomfortable, especially when she thought about how her initial intention was to drug him. In the end\u2026Laughing dryly, she said, \u201cNo way. I\u2019m just a little uncomfortable\u2026 Oh, Senior Jingyu, please go ahead. I\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026 why are you running away?\u201d Perplexed, Gu Jingyu looked at the director beside him. \u201cHey, do I look very scary?\u201dThe director silently scolded this insensible lass. \u201cOf course not. So many people idolize you.\u201dLin Che stood there trying to avoid Lin Li, not wanting to bump into her. It was good that although they were filming the same series, they did not have any scenes together. Lin Che was happy about this. She just wanted to film this series quietly and properly, without letting Lin Li affect her mood at all.When she managed to sneak out, Lin Che found a place to sit. Soon after, she heard a voice above her head.\u201cHey, no one is sitting here, right?\u201dLin Che raised her head to look; Gu Jingyu was here.With her mind blank, she said, \u201cNope.\u201dGu Jingyu sat down and crossed his legs. He exuded a slight feeling of unrestrained wildness. Although his face had the same cold lines as Gu Jingze\u2019s, it was different from Gu Jingze\u2019s stoniness and elegance. He looked much more uninhibited. In comparison, Gu Jingze was colder while he was more passionate.Lin Che lifted her glass and drank a mouthful of water. She caught sight of Lin Li looking at her and turned back to him.Gu Jingyu looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re playing the role of Chen Yihan?\u201dLin Che nodded, looking respectful and mannerly. It was only right to behave this way towards a senior.\u201cSo we will have scenes together.\u201d\u201cYes. I read the script,\u201d Lin Che said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze gazed at her with a slight interest. \u201cSince we have scenes together, shouldn\u2019t we first get closer?\u201dLin Che lifted her head slowly. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have any love scenes.\u201dGu Jingyu was momentarily speechless. He assessed Lin Che and said, \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve already read the entire script?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Senior, if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand, I\u2019ll ask the producer to help you out. It won\u2019t be good if I distort the meaning of the scenes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNoticing that Gu Jingyu was continuing to look at her without a response, she asked again, \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201dAfter all, it was also Lin Che\u2019s first time playing such an important role. She herself was worried about some parts that she did not understand. Thus, she was even more careful when dealing with a \u201cSenior\u201d.Gu Jingyu chuckled upon seeing her worried expression. He shook his head and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026 thank you for being so thoughtful, but there\u2019s no need to trouble the producer. I\u2019ll get someone to come to my place and help me.\u201dLin Che replied with an \u201coh\u201d before sitting down again.Sensing that Gu Jingyu\u2019s eyes were still on her, Lin Che lifted her head and asked carefully, \u201cIs there anything else you need, Senior?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Gu Jingyu laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve met a rookie as diligent as you.\u201dWhen Lin Che heard this, she looked at him gratefully, \u201cThank you for the compliment. I\u2019m just learning from you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingyu remarked, \u201cYou must have received the role through your acting skills. I think you\u2019ll do well.\u201dYes, if not for her acting skills, it would probably be very difficult for her to establish herself in this industry with her lack of intelligence and maturity. The fact that she could not even tell that he was intentionally giving her a chance to get closer to him made it such that describing her as intelligent an overstatement.Upon hearing this, Lin Che was incredibly touched. \u201cReally? Thank you for your encouragement, Senior. I\u2019ll definitely work hard.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was definitely her acting skills that got her the role.Beside them, the director looked in surprise at Lin Che and Gu Jingyu sitting together. Perplexed, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Jingyu today? He usually doesn\u2019t like talking to anyone.\u201dThe manager said lowly, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. He already reserved a room inside, but he suddenly ran over there to sit. Hey, is the person speaking to him a new actress? I haven\u2019t seen her before.\u201d\u201cYes, we made an exception and gave her the role. Her image is not bad; she really suits this role.\u201dDuring the opening party, many pairs of eyes looked over at them. The big shot, Gu Jingyu, was known for being cold and indifferent to people. However, he was unexpectedly chatting with another actress in the series today.And this person was a rookie.Everyone looked curiously at this rookie.\u201cThat rookie is not bad.\u201d\u201cI heard they made an exception for her.\u201d\u201cShe looks really good; she leaves an impression.\u201dWhen Lin Li heard this, she shot an icy look at the people behind her. They immediately stopped talking.Everyone in the industry knew that Lin Li had a bad temper. They were afraid that she would cause trouble now.Although they were dissatisfied with Lin Li, her powerful background meant that no one could touch her.So even when Lin Li sat in the center, no one bothered to give her attention.Lin Li looked over angrily and thought to herself.What is up with this little b****? Was she acquainted with a top celebrity like Gu Jingyu?It was impossible. How could someone like Lin Che have any interaction with Gu Jingyu? Something must have happened to force the two of them to sit together.However, the usually indifferent Gu Jingyu sat there looking like he was having a great conversation with her. It made Lin Li jealous. She felt even more uncomfortable when she saw that everyone was paying attention to that little b**** because of Gu Jingyu.This Lin Che is doing it on purpose. She must have actively grouped up with Gu Jingyu. This little b**** definitely has some tricks up her sleeve.The opening party continued.As Lin Che walked past the corridor leading to the washroom, she caught sight of Lin Li.\u201cLin Che.\u201d She looked Lin Che up and down, thinking she looked different now as if there was something more to her; she seemed to be more mature or charming. Whatever the case, she no longer felt like a child, but more like a woman.She sneered and said, \u201cI advise you to leave this production team.\u201dLin Che looked at her coldly. \u201cWhy must I leave? If you feel uncomfortable, you can leave.\u201dLin Li snorted. \u201cKeep being stubborn, Lin Che. Do you know what Qin Qing likes most about me? Do you know why he will never be interested in you? He likes my feminine charm the most. He won\u2019t fall in love with you because you should go look in the mirror. If you don\u2019t have money to get plastic surgery, I can lend you some. But you\u2019re in the wrong for resorting to tricks to seducing everyone when you don\u2019t have a beautiful face.\u201dLin Che furrowed her brow as she glared at her. \u201cWhat do you mean Lin Li?!\u201dLin Li sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend. The whole team clearly saw you seducing Gu Jingyu just now. Do you still want to make excuses? Huh, look at yourself. How dare someone like you try to seduce Gu Jingyu? Do you know who he is? Do you think Gu Jingyu would be interested in someone like you?\u201d\u201cYou better tell me clearly. Lin Li, don\u2019t put the blame on others just because you\u2019re not capable enough.\u201d After hearing Lin Li\u2019s words, Lin Che could not help but raise her voice.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d At this moment, a voice called out from behind them. Lin Che turned her head only to see that Qin Qing was here.Her heart thumped. The moment she saw Qin Qing, her unyielding attitude crumbled completely. She could not help but feel bitter. As she looked at Qin Qing, her expression softened.However, Lin Li immediately went into Qin Qing\u2019s arms.\u201cI was just warning her not to be too casual in this industry. The whole production team saw her seducing Gu Jingyu just now. Her reputation would be affected. However, she not only refused to listen to me, but she even shouted at me, I\u2026 I only wanted to give her advice because she\u2019s my younger sister.\u201dQin Qing looked at Lin Che in surprise. \u201cGu Jingyu?\u201dLin Che felt a little disappointed. Although Qin Qing did not seem to believe it completely, he still continued to placate Lin Li whose shoulders were trembling. \u201cLin Che\u2026 Gu Jingyu is the third young master of the Gu family. He\u2019s not just a celebrity. He\u2019s also the third successor to the Gu family, something you were probably unaware of. You should really stay away from anyone from the Gu family.\u201d*Lin Che looked at Qin Qing speechlessly.Lin Li looked on from the side, enjoying Lin Che\u2019s pained expression.

I still have something on, so you guys go ahead.\u201d Without looking back, Lin Che walked out to Qin Qing\u2019s appallment.After comforting Lin Li a little, he quickly chased after Lin Che.When Qin Qing grabbed Lin Che\u2019s arm, she was already outside. The dark, night sky made her face appear even paler. As he looked at her white and clean face, Qin Qing seemed to discover for the first time that her face looked as white and soft as a peeled egg; it was almost translucent.Looking straight into her eyes, he said, \u201cI\u2019m serious, Lin Che. No matter what, the family in this country that no one can afford to offend is precisely the Gu family. Gu Jingyu is the third young master of the Gu family. Otherwise, with his status, how could he command the respect of so many people?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Perhaps it was because she had drunk too much wine, but she had become much more impulsive. \u201cWhat if I\u2019ve already offended them?\u201dQin Qing paled as he said, sighing, \u201cIt may be alright to offend Gu Jingyu. But his eldest brother is our current president, Gu Jingming. Also, his second brother is the mysterious business tycoon, Gu Jingze. These people are typically involved in dealings unimaginable to us. So in this country, it\u2019s better to stay away from the Gu family. Do you understand?\u201dLin Che felt her mind turn abuzz in chaos.\u201cHow could I be acquainted with them? It\u2019s fine. Just let me go. You should go back and look after Lin Li. There\u2019s no need to bother about me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dAs Qin Qing looked at her, she pushed his hand away with her slender one. The softness of her palm made him space out momentarily.At that moment, Lin Li had already caught up to them from behind.Lin Che glanced at Lin Li one last time before laughing grimly. In a drunken stupor, she walked out, leaving worry on Qin Qing\u2019s face as he watched her leave.However, Lin Li held him back and asked, \u201cWas what you said just now true? Gu Jingyu has such a powerful background?\u201dQin Qing continued to look in the direction Lin Che had left. \u201cYes. But it seems Lin Che has really grown up. She\u2019s no longer the little girl she was.\u201dUpon hearing this, Lin Li\u2019s delicate eyebrows knitted together. She did not want to hear him talking about Lin Che. In addition, she felt gloomy when she thought about how Lin Che had just been sitting with the usually cold Gu Jingyu.Now, she was burning with envy having learnt that Gu Jingyu was not merely a top celebrity but one with such a powerful background.How did Lin Che manage to catch Gu Jingyu\u2019s eye?When Lin Che stepped out of the tunnel, she bumped into someone.She lifted her head only to see Butler Hu. She could not help but smile.\u201cButler Hu, why are you here?\u201d\u201cMadam, you\u2019re drunk. I came to take you home.\u201dHearing someone call her \u201cMadam\u201d, she thought that it was even funnier.Could she even be considered a Madam?She was brought home in a daze.When Gu Jingze heard the noise outside, he walked out the door in large strides.However, a soft and pliant body immediately fell on him the moment he reached the door.When Gu Jingze regained his bearings, he felt the tender flesh on her chest press against his own, causing his heart to quiver. But immediately after, he saw the two patches of red across her face. Her eyelashes fluttered lightly and her lips were like delicate, juicy flower petals. Her ear was rubbing against his neck, tickling him.He froze as he fixed his eyes on her.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe reeking smell of alcohol assaulted his olfactory senses as though the woman had just gotten out of a tank of alcohol.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d She looked at him. Gu Jingze was frowning deeply and his shimmering eyes were deep and unfathomable. \u201cHubby, I\u2019m home.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze had no choice but to keep holding her up, for if he let her go, she would have definitely fallen straight to the ground. This only made the people around them feel apprehensive; they were afraid that Gu Jingze would harm the Madam in his fit of anger.\u201cWhy did you drink so much?\u201d he asked unhappily before shooting a look at the people around them. They immediately retreated out of the room quietly and left the house for the two of them.\u201cOh, we had our opening party today, Hubby.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened when he felt her hand stroking him carelessly.\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201dLin Che pushed her luck and put both her arms on him, naturally winding them around his neck. \u201cHubby, what else can I call you? You and I got our marriage license, so of course, you\u2019re my hubby, right?\u201d\u201cCall me by my name,\u201d he said slowly.\u201cZe~\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze stretched an arm across her body and lifted her up in his arms, carrying her into the bedroom.During the journey to the bedroom, Lin Che did not stay still by rubbing her face all over his chest. She was just like a kitten and that made Gu Jingze feel even more frustrated.It was only after tossing her into bed that he felt the burning heat in his body subside a little.He had also just returned home and didn\u2019t have time to change his clothes. Discomforted by his tie, he reached up to loosen it slightly before looking at the disheveled woman on his bed.The sight of her lying there made her look a little pitiful actually. Thus, he looked down and loosened her clothes a little to make her feel more comfortable.To his surprise, she grabbed his tie and yanked it, causing him to fall onto her soft body immediately after.With both hands beside her head, he looked at her up-close face really closely.Her cheeks were very exquisite. It was as if a hint of rouge had been applied to them, making her look like a ripe apple. With her mouth turned up, she stuck her tongue out slightly to lick her lips. The action caused a stir in his nether regions.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d After muttering to himself, he felt something wrong near his chest.When he looked down, her chest was right below his. Her half-open collar exposed an obvious large patch of soft, white-skinned cleavage.Lin Che looked very thin, but the places that were supposed to be fleshy were indeed fleshy\u2026It was Gu Jingze\u2019s first time looking at a woman\u2019s body at such a close distance and in such an awkward position\u2026His gaze deepened and with a turn of his body, he detached himself from her. Facing upwards, he laid on the other side of the bed while breathing deeply.He thought to himself,His body seemed to have gotten a lot better after changing his medicine recently. His illness did not flare up despite the fact that he had made contact with Lin Che.He turned his head; the woman beside him was staying still, for now.Lin Che\u2019s skin was indeed much fairer than any other girl\u2019s skin despite not working hard at maintaining her fairness. Her natural paleness only complemented her good looks.She did not look unpleasant.Even with the flush of alcohol on her initially fresh face, it only added to her charm. She was like a freshly-bloomed flower with a bright, enticing color.Then, Lin Che began to fidget again.\u201cWhat the hell? Why hasn\u2019t someone not switched on the air conditioner?\u201d She stretched her hand out to tug at her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m going to die from the heat.\u201dHearing her crass words, Gu Jingze wanted to leave her alone to die there.However, when he turned his head, he saw her clumsily tugging at her clothes in random directions, but it was a futile attempt to take them off. He pondered for a bit before walking back to her.\u201cStop yanking. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Despite saying so, he really had no idea where to put his hands. At his age, he still had not waited upon any woman.But in the end, he managed to pull her clothes up and started off by pulling down the zipper at the back.Her flesh was immediately exposed; it was as if spring had arrived.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che felt much more comfortable and she quickly shrugged off her clothes as hard as she could.Her lace underwear appeared immediately.\u201cYou\u2026 Lin Che!\u201dDid she have any regard for herself at all?

His gaze subconsciously traveled to her flat abdomen.Shifting his gaze, he said through gritted teeth, \u201cLin Che, sober up a bit.\u201dLin Che lowered her head to look at Gu Jingze. \u201cHubby\u2026 you\u2019re so fierce to me.\u201dGu Jingze resisted his temper. \u201cI can be even fiercer.\u201d\u201cHubby\u2026 do you really hate me?\u201d She looked at him, her pearly white teeth biting down on her bottom lip and causing it to turn slightly red.Strangely, Gu Jingze\u2019s heart skipped a beat. As he looked at her, he had initially wanted to ignore her, but he still cajoled her patiently. \u201cAlright, I don\u2019t hate you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d He lifted Lin Che up in his arms.Using her arms and legs, Lin Che immediately leaned on his body.Gu Jingze discovered that uncharacteristically, he neither broke out in a rash nor did he feel uncomfortable.He looked down at her head which was resting on his shoulder obediently. She seemed to have fallen asleep and her lashes were fluttering at an angle. At 168 centimeters tall, she could not really be considered petite. She was indeed taller than most girls. But right now, as she leaned against him, she appeared very small. It easily roused him to protect her.After putting her down, her arm hooked around his neck yet again.Her small face, completely flushed red from the alcohol, was very close to his. Her scent hit him in the face.A slight numbing sensation tingled throughout his body.\u201cHubby, I still want a hug.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cDo you know who you\u2019re speaking to?\u201d\u201cMy hubby,\u201d she said in a daze.For a moment, Gu Jingze was actually speechless.\u201cBe good and don\u2019t make a fuss.\u201d He wanted to push her away, but after stretching his arm out, he ended up just stroking her soft hair.\u201cGive me a hug,\u201d she continued to mutter.With no other choice, he laid down and pulled her into his arms, allowing her small head to rest in the crevice of his neck.This only served to freeze him up as his body stiffened instantly.Just inches beneath his eyes, he heard Lin Che sighing and letting out sounds of pleasure.\u201cNot bad\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s body softened.Finally, Gu Jingze laid her down, only to hear her from behind him shouting with her eyes still closed, \u201cI still want a hug!\u201dGu Jingze frowned and massaged his forehead.This woman\u2026 why was she so clingy?And that was when a sudden thud came from the woman on the bed.Gu Jingze quickly turned his head and saw that Lin Che had already fallen onto the floor.Although the floor was thickly carpeted, it was obvious to the eye that Lin Che had fallen quite hard.Holding on to her forehead, she got up and stared blankly ahead.When she saw Gu Jingze, she frowned and asked in a confused tone, \u201cWhat happened Gu Jingze? Why am I here?\u201dShe was finally not calling him hubby?\u201cYou\u2019re drunk. If you\u2019re awake, then get up. Wash up before you sleep.\u201dLin Che replied with an \u201coh\u201d as if she had also thought of something. She crawled up from the ground in a bid to get back onto the bed.However, her body was limp and soft. After crawling up twice, she still did not manage to get on the bed.As he watched her acting clumsily, Gu Jingze felt as though he had exhausted a year\u2019s worth of patience before successfully convincing himself to walk over. Without any hesitation, he lifted Lin Che up in his arms.Lin Che stiffened and her face gradually turned red.Gu Jingze did not look at her, but he felt both of Lin Che\u2019s hands gripping the lapels of his jacket. Her long lashes fluttered slightly.He looked too handsome while carrying her. Unable to look at him calmly, she felt like she was about to suffocate. She could only grasp onto him as if she was deeply afraid that she would accidentally let out a sigh.While tugging on his lapels, Lin Che raised her chin and slowly inched closer towards his face.Gu Jingze lowered his head. As he looked into her clear eyes, the flames inside him almost burned his rationality completely away.His eyes paused as they stared at her bright red lips. Her lips were plump and full as if they were specially designed for kissing.The corner of his mouth twitched when a thought came to his head. However, he felt his body go rigid to the point where he could not move. It was as if his field of vision was confined only to her lips as he slowly inched downwards.But at this exact moment\u2026\u201cBleurgh\u2026\u201dGu Jingze only felt a surge of heat on his chest as if something was flowing upwards\u2026She had vomited on his body\u2026Gu Jingze could no longer tolerate it. Immediately, he pulled her up and dragged her to the bathroom. He threw her into the bathtub, picked up the shower spray, and directed it at her head.\u201cSo damn dirty\u2026 Can\u2019t you be at least a bit feminine? What woman behaves like you? After drinking so much alcohol, you come home in a drunken frenzy and you even dare to barf on me\u2026\u201dThe water sprayed into Lin Che\u2019s eyes and caused her to feel uncomfortable. She was almost about to cry as she struggled to get out. However, Gu Jingze simply jumped into the water himself, pushed her down, and forcefully washed her.As for Lin Che, she felt extremely refreshed from soaking in the water. She found a comfortable position and laid down directly.She slept quietly, her head resting in the crook of his arm. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was upturned. Under the warm water, her face was red as if she had put on some of the best quality rouge. The mist condensed slowly into pearls on her long lashes\u2026Gu Jingze gulped and with great difficulty, shifted his gaze away from her face.He wanted to throw his hands in the air and leave her be; this troublemaker really worried him too much.However, when he turned his head to look at her under the water looking like a well-cooked lobster, he thought twice. Eventually, he walked over and carried her out in one swift motion\u2026*Lin Che woke up the next day feeling intense pain all over her body. While holding her head up with her hand, she got off the bed and looked down\u2026Why was she naked?Her head was throbbing painfully, but she failed to immediately recall what had happened.What ridiculous things had she exactly done last night\u2026In a drunken fit, she held on to Gu Jingze persistently and had even\u2026 even vomited all over him\u2026The memory jolted her awake, causing Lin Che to quickly grab her clothes and put them on before running out in a hurry only to see the maid carrying a bowl of hangover soup.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMadam, you\u2019re awake.

As she looked at him, she fiddled with her hands as she said sheepishly, \u201cLast night\u2026\u201d\u201cTo be precise, you should say this morning because it was already dawn when you came back.\u201d Holding a white, ceramic coffee mug between his fingers, he brought it to his lips and took a sip.\u201c\u2026\u201d Fine. Lin Che said lowly, \u201cS-sorry. I was drunk. I\u2026 I forgot what I did.\u201d Lin Che was intending to play ignorance.Gu Jingze raised his deep eyes and looked at her. \u201cYou did nothing.\u201d\u201cIs that so,\u201d Lin Che blurted.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cOr were you hoping that you did something?\u201d\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s best if I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Lin Che looked down in guilt.Gu Jingze narrowed his eyes and stared at her. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve forgotten everything?\u201dLin Che said quickly, \u201cYes, yes. I remember nothing.\u201dGu Jingze came closer to her and stared at her face with his dark gaze. \u201cYou kissed me last night.\u201dShocked, Lin Che said frantically, \u201cNo way. That didn\u2019t happen at all. I remember clearly that I vomited before I even kissed you.\u201dIt was only after she finished speaking that she realized her words. She quickly reached her hand up to cover her own mouth.Gu Jingze raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt looks like you didn\u2019t really forget everything.\u201dGreatly embarrassed, Lin Che truly wanted to slap herself a few times.With her face flushed completely red, she lowered her head and said, \u201cSorry, I know that I\u2019m a married woman now, but I still behaved in that way\u2026 It\u2019s my fault. I was drunk last night, so I wasn\u2019t fully conscious. I won\u2019t do that next time.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a next time?\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s brow twitched.\u201cNo more, no more. There won\u2019t be a second time, at least not during our marriage,\u201d Lin Che said frantically.Gu Jingze glared at her before getting up leisurely. Without a second glance at her, he walked out directly.Lin Che sat there with her hands clasped together, her face full of regret.She had actually called Gu Jingze \u201cHubby\u201d, hugged him, and asked for kisses.She would rather die.She could not blame him for being furious. She had made a deal with him to mutually stay out of each other\u2019s affairs but last night, she had instead done something so crazy in her drunken stupor. She had even dared to call him Hubby even though they were just married under a contract.He was used to being superior. To hear someone call him Hubby must have made him fall apart inside.Besides, even if he wanted to hear someone call him Hubby, he would only want to hear Mo Huiling doing so. There was no way he would want to hear her call him that.In her immense frustration, Lin Che swatted her head.When the maid saw this, she walked over quickly. \u201cMadam, what happened to you?\u201dLin Che said gloomily, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just have a bit of a headache.\u201dThe maid said softly, \u201cMadam, Sir probably didn\u2019t sleep well last night, so he\u2019s not in a good mood. Also, his complexion is very poor. Don\u2019t worry, Madam.\u201dLin Che raised her head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sleep well last night? Did he suffer because of me?\u201dThe maid said, \u201cNo, Sir took a cold shower that lasted half the night, so he didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201dWhat?Dumbfounded, Lin Che said, \u201cYour Sir has so many weird habits. Why take a cold shower for no reason?\u201dThe maid did not know either. She could only guess as she said, \u201cI saw Doctor Chen come over just now. It\u2019s probably because Sir recently changed his medical treatment plan to a new one.\u201dLin Che shook her head and thought to herself that Gu Jingze\u2019s illness was really troublesome.At the same time inside Gu Jingze\u2019s study room.Gu Jingze looked at his doctor. \u201cI feel like my body went through some new changes recently.\u201dIt was not Chen Yucheng\u2019s first or second day helping Gu Jingze with his treatment. He had been doing this for over ten years since Gu Jingze\u2019s illness began. So when he heard him saying this now, he asked monotonously, \u201cWhat changes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that recently when I touch Lin Che, I don\u2019t really feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t break out in rashes either. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s because I had intimate relations with her, so I\u2019m not that repulsed.\u201dChen Yucheng shrugged and said, \u201cI think that\u2019s entirely possible.\u201dGu Jingze frowned. \u201cI want a concrete answer, not a possibility.\u201dChen Yucheng could only grudgingly say, \u201cSir, your illness is in itself very strange. You\u2019re probably the only case in the whole world. Thus, I only have you as a case study to examine. How can I give you a concrete answer?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s gaze dimmed and his expression darkened.Chen Yucheng sighed and said, \u201cBut, Sir. You only can\u2019t touch women. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t get aroused. All your bodily functions operate like a typical person\u2019s, so it\u2019s normal for you to have feelings toward a woman.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dGu Jingze looked at him. \u201cI already have Huiling and what happened between me and Lin Che was just an accident.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 you can just try to have intimate relations again to check if your body might feel differently.\u201d\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t an experiment.\u201d Gu Jingze stood up, took his clothes, and walked out.Lin Che was not a guinea pig either.*At a Western restaurant.Gu Jingze elegantly held a knife and fork in each hand as he sliced the exquisite beef on his plate.To the side, a violinist was playing melodious music, giving the entire, high-class restaurant a tranquil feel with ample ambiance.Mo Huiling smiled as she said, \u201cThe food here is really quite good.\u201dGu Jingze nodded. \u201cIt is.\u201dMo Huiling saw that there was something wrong with Gu Jingze\u2019s expression. Confused, she asked, \u201cJingze, why are you in such low spirits today?\u201dGu Jingze looked up slightly. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s face crumpled a little. With some resentment in her gaze, she looked at him with her head down. \u201cAbout what I said before, my suggestion for you to move out and live with me. Have you decided?\u201dThe hand holding his fork paused. \u201cI\u2019m still considering it.\u201dIn a fit of anger, Mo Huiling put down her fork and knife immediately, \u201cJingze, are you even seriously considering it?\u201dUpon being forcefully questioned, Gu Jingze felt a little impatient. But he thought to himself,He could understand; it was normal for Mo Huiling to have such worries.\u201cI am considering it seriously. However, I don\u2019t want to take the risk of being discovered by my family. You know that I am a cautious person in my dealings. I would much rather prefer thorough plans that are absolutely safe as opposed to being worried every day about whether or not I will be discovered.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 is it really because you\u2019re afraid of being discovered or is it because you just don\u2019t want to be separated from your wife?!\u201d Mo Huiling said, almost running out of patience.Gu Jingze froze as Mo Huiling stood up immediately. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be separated from her, then I\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll back out and let the two of you be together. Wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201dAs she said this, Mo Huiling took her bag and walked out without looking back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze put down his fork and knife, but he sat there without chasing after her.Of course, he wanted to tell Mo Huiling that there was nothing going on between him and Lin Che. However, it was not necessarily true that he and Lin Che had no relationship.At the very least, they had the most intimate of relationships; something he could not deny.Very soon after, he returned home, but before he even entered, he seemed to hear Lin Che inside speaking to someone over the phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her tone of voice brought with it a hint of consolation as she said, \u201cLin Che, Stepmother is also doing this for your own good. There is nothing bad about the Cheng family. Although the idiot is dumb, at least his family background is good. If you marry him, you will good days ahead.

In the future, Lin Yu is going to be a proper Young Madam. How can she marry into that kind of family?Lin Che said coldly, \u201cStepmother, I\u2019m not interested in being some Young Madam. I\u2019ve already asked someone to retrieve my belongings at home. I will never return to the Lin residence again.\u201dHearing Lin Che be so resolute, Han Caiying\u2019s voice instantly sharpened as she said, \u201cLin Che, do you really want to cut ties with the family? Fine! First, return me all the money I spent on you since you were young. I put so much effort into bringing you up and now that your wings have hardened, you want to leave?\u201dDumbfounded, Lin Che said, \u201cFine, putting aside the fact that I waited on all of you like a housekeeper\u2014something I should have received a lot of money for\u2014you have given me a place to live after all.

Which part of you can even compare to Lin Li\u2019s pinky finger? Yet you still hope that Qin Qing will take a fancy to you? If you really don\u2019t have such thoughts, then immediately back out from the cast.\u201dLin Che scowled and said, \u201cNow get this clear. That is my job. I won\u2019t listen to you and back out just because you asked me to.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLin Che said, \u201cAlso, if you\u2019re really so scared that I might snatch Qin Qing from her, then make your daughter look more attractive. What are you threatening me for?!\u201dWhen Lin Che finished speaking, she slammed the phone down.She lifted her head only to coincidentally see Gu Jingze behind her.His jet-black irises were like deep waters of the sea, alluring and mysterious.With awkwardness showing plainly on her face, she looked at him and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make any sound when you walk?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s basic etiquette to walk quietly. Surely, not everyone should be like you, making unnecessary noises and fussing around?\u201d Gu Jingze walked in with his long legs, his posture elegant.Lin Che said in a dismayed tone, \u201cYes, yes, yes. You\u2019re the most well-mannered person and I\u2019m the most uncultured. Luckily, we\u2019ll be getting a divorce sooner or later. Otherwise, I would really go mad if I had to be educated and be looked down upon for the rest of my life.\u201dWith his hands clasped behind his back, Gu Jingze said, \u201cIndeed it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the most well-mannered and you\u2019re the most uncultured. It\u2019s completely true,\u201d Gu Jingze said.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Che shot a glare at him as she huffed. She then walked forward, imitating the small steps of a lady.Upon seeing this, Gu Jingze\u2019s urge to laugh almost broke his facade.Lin Che turned back and said, \u201cDo you like such a gait? Did I imitate it well?\u201d\u201cSo dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cWith your stupidity, it\u2019s no wonder you ended up drugging the wrong person.\u201d\u201cHey, didn\u2019t we agree not to bring up that matter again?\u201d Lin Che said, her face swelling with anger.Gu Jingze looked at her and wanted to say something, but could not help but ask, \u201cIs that Qin Qing the man you like?\u201dThe smile on Lin Che\u2019s face instantly stiffened greatly. A hint of deep grief flashed in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel awkward at all talking to your wife about the person she likes?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che was speechless. \u201cFine, anyway\u2026 yes, actually. It\u2019s alright for me to tell you since you don\u2019t know him anyway. Not everyone is so lucky to have the person they are attracted to like them back as well. He and I can probably be considered childhood sweethearts but unfortunately, the person he has always liked is Lin Li.\u201dWhen she lifted her head, Lin Che\u2019s eyes met Gu Jingze\u2019s profound ones. At that moment, she felt as if that sensual gaze could almost penetrate her body.\u201cIf you want, I can help you get him.\u201d\u201cGet him?\u201d Lin Che looked at him in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. If you want, I can make him like you and be together with you.\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s rich voice was laced with haughty arrogance.\u201cHa, how can you make him like me?\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze said, \u201cFor instance, I can make him unable to get engaged to your sister. I can impose pressure on him and force him to be with you.\u201d\u201cHa, then forget it.\u201d She said quickly, \u201cWhy not make him marry Lin Li quickly so that people won\u2019t all think that I\u2019m trying to snatch him away? I feel so awkward in that situation.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible either. But are you sure you want that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already married now. Is it really good for you to be talking to a married woman about this?\u201d Looking at his poker face, she hurriedly interrupted him.Gu Jingze said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve said it before. I made this marriage happen, so I can definitely give you any compensation you ask for. Apart from money, I can count this as part of the compensation too.\u201d\u201cForget it. Right now, I just feel that I\u2019ve heard enough of his name. Actually, love is just one part of life. My bigger wish is to act and improve myself, career-wise. In this way, better people will be able to see me. Then, I\u2019ll be able to meet much better men. As for Qin Qing, he\u2019ll just be a small interlude at most by then. Throughout life, who hasn\u2019t met a person he or she loved but could not have, right?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t met such a person,\u201d Gu Jingze said coolly.\u201c\u2026\u201dFine, Lin Che thought as she looked at him speechlessly. But she also knew that he was speaking the truth.Lin Che said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll go take a shower first.\u201d\u201cAlright. But if you change your mind, you can tell me anytime.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Che thought to herself that no matter what, he was still trying to help her.Gu Jingze said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m your husband. It\u2019s only right for me to consider your interests.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIncluding helping your wife find her next husband? Gu Jingze, you\u2019re really too nice,\u201d Lin Che smiled instinctively and said.When Gu Jingze saw her radiant smile, his gaze paused for a bit before it shifted away. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll fulfill every promise I make to you.\u201d When they just married, he had already said that he would compensate her and he was definitely going to.Lin Che\u2019s heart thumped. As he stood there completely upright, saying things like \u201cI\u2019ll fulfill every promise I\u2019ve made to you\u201d, she felt that he gave off a deadly sensual feeling.She turned her head away and blinked before smiling faintly. No matter how good he was, he belonged to someone else anyway. She was going to divorce him sooner or later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How Did You Survive Until Now?Translator:\u00a0AtlasStudios\u00a0|\u00a0Editor:\u00a0AtlasStudios\u00a0/Atlas StudiosLin Che entered the bathroom and took off her clothes, preparing to shower.The bathroom here was bigger than the living room of her house. Just the hydromassage tub alone seemed big enough to swim in.However, she seldom used the tub since she always felt a little unaccustomed to it.She saw that today, the maid had already filled the tub with water that was still hot with steam rising from it. After thinking about it, she removed her clothes and stepped into the tub carefully.When she immersed herself in the water, sure enough, she felt much more relaxed.Then, she recalled her stepmother\u2019s words and then Gu Jingze\u2019s.Qin Qing was about to marry Lin Li.She first met Qin Qing in school. He was the captain of the drum corps and she was a drummer. Because of an injury, he brought her back to the Lin residence. With his then thin and weak body, he carried her body that was slightly plump due to baby fat on his back all the way home. When they reached the Lin residence, he was bathed in sweat. The sight tugged at her heartstrings and at the time, she felt that he was the person who treated her the best in this world.At that time, they were still primary school students.He also began receiving frequent playtime invitations from the Lin family after they discovered that he was actually the second young master of the Qin family.Unexpectedly, this was how he met Lin Li.She washed herself in the bath until her entire body was languid to the point of falling asleep. When she stood up, she only felt a sudden dizziness before she fell down into the tub.A splash of water resounded.Gu Jingze heard the noise from outside and quickly ran over.He pulled open the door only to see Lin Che trying hard to crawl out of the tub. Her face was flushed red and was clouded by the fog. She looked extremely unwell.Shocked, Gu Jingze ignored everything else and rushed forward immediately to pull her out.As if she had grasped onto a straw that could save her life, Lin Che wound both her arms around his neck.Her drenched body pressed tightly against his chest and got his clothes considerably wet.In large strides, Gu Jingze carried Lin Che out with a few steps.He placed her on the bed and patted her face. \u201cWhat happened to you? Lin Che? Wake up.\u201dLin Che gasped for air. Only then did her clouded and dizzy mind begin to gradually recover.Standing before her was Gu Jingze with his brows deeply furrowed and his gaze full of worry. Her heart thumped for no reason when she saw that.\u201cI\u2019m alright. I just feel a little dizzy.\u201d She held her hand to her cheek.\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d Gu Jingze asked in a confused tone.\u201cIt\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve never really taken a bath before. I felt like doing it today but in the end, I was laying there for too long. I had felt a little dizzy while in the water, but I didn\u2019t expect that sense of vertigo when I got up\u2026\u201dSo that was what had happened.\u00a0Gu Jingze\u2019s worries largely dissipated. It was only when he straightened his body slightly that he noticed\u2026Lin Che was naked.The smooth expanse of her skin was tinged pink due to the warm water bath. Under the circumstances, the lines of her curvaceous body appeared before his eyes even more clearly. Her chest area\u2014in particular\u2014was glistening with water, making it impossible to ignore.Gu Jingze\u2019s heart pounded. He felt a surge of heat pass through his brain and in an instant, his lower abdomen followed and began to swell.Forcing himself to look away from her body, he picked up the blanket and covered her with it.Lin Che also realized that something was wrong with her. Her face was presently so red that it seemed like it was about to bleed. She clutched the blanket with a deadly grip and her heart was drumming in her chest.\u201cHave you never had a bath?\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you can faint from taking a short bath.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cOf course. You think everyone is like you and born with a silver spoon in their mouths? When I was in the Lin residence, I stayed in the housekeeper\u2019s room the whole time. Of course, there was no place for me to take a bath.\u201dGu Jingze looked deep into her eyes. \u201cHow do you feel now?\u201dLin Che glared at him. \u201cTurn around\u2026 I\u2019ll be putting on clothes.\u201dGu Jingze was compelled to turn around. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen what I should see.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Che\u2019s face heated up with anger and her small face began to swell up.Only after she put on her clothes at lightning speed did she feel a slight sense of security.Gu Jingze turned his head back to look at her. Her small face was still dark red and her lips had been soaked until they were even poutier. When she wiped her drenched hair with a towel, several beads of water flowed downwards along her hair and fell onto her white neck.His throat bobbed. Following this, he felt his body temperature increasing slowly.At that moment, his cell phone suddenly started ringing.He lifted his phone and saw Huiling\u2019s name displayed on the screen.After letting out a dry cough, he shifted his gaze away from her and picked up the call.\u201cHuiling, what\u2019s up?\u201d he asked.When Lin Che heard \u2018Huiling\u2019, she also turned her head to look at Gu Jingze, who heard Mo Huiling say over the phone, \u201cJingze, I went back and thought about it. I spoke too impulsively today. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cNo, I can understand. I\u2019m not angry.\u201dMo Huiling said carefully, \u201cI got angry only because I love you too much. We\u2019ve been together for so many years. You understand me best. I lack a sense of security; I get worried knowing that you are together with her. I know that you\u2019ve always been used to doing things without leaving any middle ground or loopholes for the other person. You were just thinking about the benefits for the both of us. I was too insensible.\u201dWhen he heard Mo Huiling say this, Gu Jingze said, \u201cYou weren\u2019t, Huiling. From the beginning, I\u2019ve been the one who hasn\u2019t been doing enough. It\u2019s because I still haven\u2019t done enough. That\u2019s also why you don\u2019t feel a sense of security.\u201d\u201cRegardless, no matter what decision you make, I will still support you. You know that I will always be on your side.\u201d\u201cThank you, Huiling,\u201d he said.By this time, Lin Che had already cleaned her hair with the towel and was about to get the blow-dryer. When she moved her leg, she felt a bit of pain and thought to herself that she must have hurt it due to the earlier fall. She let out a sound of pain and stopped in her tracks.Noticing her small movements, Gu Jingze walked over with a frown.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I may have hurt it earlier. I\u2019ll just get some ointment to rub on it,\u201d Lin Che said as she stood up and held on to the table for support.Gu Jingze gazed at her deeply for a long time. When he saw that she still wanted to move, he walked a few steps closer to her and said, \u201cStop, don\u2019t move carelessly.\u201dAs he said this, he stretched his arm across her waist without hesitation and lifted her in his arms.\u201cAiyo\u2026\u201dBoth her legs left the ground in an instant. As she looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s gallant face from this angle, the lines of his face were well-defined and his jawline was shockingly attractive. Combined with his deep and profound eyes, his entire figure was ridiculously perfect.Lin Che said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cStay still and don\u2019t move. How stupid,\u201d he said while looking down to glare at her.Lin Che\u2019s heart pounded, but knowing that he was helping her, she stayed completely still. She did not dare move a single inch. All she did was raise her head to look at him when he placed her on the single-seater couch.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe large bruise on her ankle was extremely obvious.Gu Jingze said, \u201cIt\u2019s so strange. How did you manage to survive for so many years until now if you can get hurt to this extent from simply taking a bath?\u201dLin Che said defiantly, \u201cI\u2019m used to living in hard times. I just can\u2019t enjoy the life of a Young Madam, alright?\u201dGu Jingze looked up and glared at her again, \u201cThen start getting used to it now since you\u2019ll have to be a Young Madam for a few more years.\u201dLin Che\u2019s heart heated up again. When she thought about living together with him for a few more years\u2026 she just felt that it was a little unbelievable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s Only Right That I Should Look After YouAtlas StudiosGu Jingze pressed the bell on the side while saying to her, \u201cIf you need anything, don\u2019t move. Just press this and a maid will come.\u201dIt was his first time explaining these things to her personally. For the past few days, she had remained oblivious that such things even existed.She looked at the button at the head of the bed and said in awe, \u201cBeing rich is just great. You can lie on the bed for a whole day without moving and you still wouldn\u2019t die of hunger.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re also a rich person.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not at all,\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze said, \u201cWith a husband as wealthy as me, of course, you\u2019re a rich person.\u201dWhen Lin Che heard this, she felt a tingling warmth in her chest. But then again, she remembered that it would only be for a few years, so she pondered a bit before saying, \u201cForget it. If I really get too accustomed to it, then I won\u2019t be able to get used to living a hard life after we divorce.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her in frustration. \u201cYou think too much.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dGu Jingze thought for a bit, looked at her, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll give you a large sum of money even after we divorce. I won\u2019t let you live a rough life again.\u201dUpon hearing this, Lin Che could not help but smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens then.\u201dFor some unknown reason, Gu Jingze was irked by her words.Then, the maid came in.Gu Jingze requested the maid to bring him some ointment. Soon, the ointment was brought over.Just as Lin Che was expressing her thoughts about how life was so convenient for rich people, Gu Jingze had already crouched down and pulled up her leg with one hand.Shocked, Lin Che struggled immediately and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Gu Jingze frowned. He raised his head and glared fiercely at this disobedient woman.Gu Jingze said, \u201cSince you already fell, just stay still.\u201dLin Che could only freeze where she was. She looked on as he took the ointment seriously with his long and slender hands and held her ankle. With his head slightly slanted, he slathered ointment on her ankle. She could not help but feel warmth growing in her chest.A serious man was definitely more handsome.She felt that in his half-crouched position, he simply looked extremely sexy and attractive.She unwittingly smiled and said, \u201cI can do it myself too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not used to being taken care of by other people either?\u201d He raised his head.Lin Che said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m already used to looking after myself.\u201dGu Jingze gazed at her with his deep eyes. \u201cI\u2019m your husband. It\u2019s clearly stated in the agreement. Apart from the fact that we shouldn\u2019t interfere with each other\u2019s love lives, we must live like a typical couple in all other aspects of marriage life.\u201dLin Che smiled as she looked at him. She suddenly felt that there was in fact nothing bad about marrying him. Although his heart belonged to someone else, their days together could still be considered comfortable and memorable.Gu Jingze carefully rubbed the ointment on her. Although she was tall, she was not heavy at all. When he was carrying her earlier, he felt that she was really light and almost weightless. When he looked again at her slim and long legs, he felt even more strongly that she was really thin.Her small feet were dainty and cute, and each toe was very round and full.As his fingers brushed lightly over them, it was as if his heart had also been brushed lightly until it became numb.When Lin Che saw that his movements had slowed, she looked down and asked, \u201cWhat happened? Is there a problem?\u201dGu Jingze raised his head. \u201cOh\u2026 no. It\u2019s fine now.\u201dAfter shifting his gaze away from her toes, he stood up and walked out carrying the first-aid box.Lin Che lowered her head and took a look at her wound. Gu Jingze really did things carefully. Even the ointment was applied beautifully. When Lin Che saw this, she was truly fascinated.Fortunately, there was only a slight bruise on the wound. The next day, she was back to leaping and frisking about.Soon her television drama began filming. That day, Lin Che went to the filming site very early.When she was done putting on her costume, the cast had already arrived one after another.Naturally, Gu Jingyu came very late. The moment he entered, a large and noisy crowd of people followed behind him.A small assistant at the side rested her head on her hands as she said in a lovestruck tone, \u201cGu Jingyu looks more handsome in person than on television.\u201d\u201cYes, his face is much smaller in person and his gaze is more alluring.\u201dLin Che lifted her head and took a look. She thought he was very handsome; the Gu family\u2019s genes were definitely good.It was soon Lin Che\u2019s turn to go in front and do a dry run first so she frantically lifted her dress and ran over. Wearing an ancient costume was a little troublesome especially when this was a drama with a high budget\u2014the tailored costumes were extremely detailed and elaborate. It was very difficult to even walk with the clothes weighing heavily on their bodies.As Lin Che ran over noisily, she stepped on something in a moment of carelessness.\u201cAiya, you stepped on our Feiran\u2019s dress.\u201d Lin Che only realized when she heard someone call out. When she turned around, she saw Mu Feiran lifting her dress. She looked at Lin Che and smiled, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dLin Che apologized profusely and said, \u201cSorry, sorry, Sister Feiran.\u201dMu Feiran looked at Lin Che. \u201cYou\u2019re the rookie acting as Chen Yihan?\u201dLin Che replied immediately, \u201cYes, Sister Feiran.\u201dMu Feiran had a good temper. She patted Lin Che\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cYou\u2019re really not bad. I look favorably upon you. I\u2019m cheering you on.\u201dHaving received encouragement, Lin Che looked at Mu Feiran with extreme happiness. \u201cThank you, Sister Feiran.\u201dVery soon after, Mu Feiran left, accompanied by her assistant and staff.The people behind her looked at Lin Che with lingering fear. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you a little more careful? Luckily, Mu Feiran is known to be very mature and she has a good temper.\u201dLin Che\u2019s impression of her was very good as well. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, she has a really good temper.\u201d\u201cNo wonder she\u2019s so famous. In this industry, you don\u2019t just need a nice face. It\u2019s also about social skills.\u201dLin Che finished filming her scenes very quickly. Because filming had just started, the cuts she had filmed were in bits and pieces. When she was done, she got herself a chair and found a place to sit and rest.She was a small actress, unlike others who had assistants and managers looking after them. On the other hand, sitting alone was very comfortable. She looked very serious as she read the script and thought about the subsequent plot.Having just finished filming, Gu Jingyu turned back to see Lin Che sitting alone. With her head lowered as she read the script, he thought she looked extremely amusing. He gestured for them to stop and told his assistant, \u201cI\u2019m not going to the resting room. Is there space there? Shift the chair over there for me and I\u2019ll sit there.\u201dThe assistant froze before saying hesitantly to Gu Jingyu, \u201cJingyu, that\u2019s the resting area for small actors.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a small actor too. Do what I tell you to do. Don\u2019t spout unnecessary nonsense,\u201d Gu Jingyu said while already starting to walk over.\u201cHey, Lin Che?\u201d He lowered his head and called her.Lin Che raised her head. When she saw that it was the Gu Jingyu, she was shocked and quickly stood up. \u201cSenior Jingyu\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHey, don\u2019t move, don\u2019t move. Sit down. We have scenes together later. I came to rehearse the lines with you.\u201d\u201cOh, okay, Senior Jingyu. But do we have scenes together later?\u201d She recalled that their scenes were to be filmed tomorrow.Gu Jingyu smiled and nodded. \u201cMm, I\u2019m free today, so we\u2019re filming one more scene today.\u201dLin Che did not doubt him. She looked at Gu Jingyu and picked up her script.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Gu Jingyu raised his head now and then to look at her but realized that she did not even spare him a glance and really treated him as if he was invisible.Gu Jingze rested his chin on one hand and began to scrutinize Lin Che in detail.When Lin Che realized that he had stopped, she lifted her head and asked in a perplexed tone, \u201cSenior Jingyu, why are you looking at me?\u201dGu Jingyu asked, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m ugly?\u201dDumbfounded, Lin Che said, \u201cNo way.\u201dGu Jingyu said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you ever look at me?\u201dLin Che pointed to her own script. \u201cBut I have to look at the script\u2026\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s true you don\u2019t like me. Did I make a bad impression on you?\u201d Gu Jingyu thought to himself,Was he not as attractive as the script?Taken aback, Lin Che said, \u201cHow can it be? I\u2019ve always liked you very much, Senior Jingyu. You\u2019re the role model of the industry. I respect you a lot! My respect towards you is literally like a surging river that flows endlessly.\u201dGu Jingyu said, \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then you should start following me and loitering behind me from tomorrow. Serve me tea, get me water, make me porridge, and cook my meals.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cHuh?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you should do?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cBut if I do all of these things, won\u2019t your assistant have to step down?\u201d\u201cHaha, so you\u2019re doing this out of consideration for other people?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Otherwise, I really would have started following you around. I\u2019m serious, Senior Jingyu.\u201dGu Jingyu said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll grudgingly believe you.\u201dLin Che hurriedly flashed a patronizing smile.Gu Jingyu said, \u201cEnough, you look even uglier than if you were to cry.\u201dLin Che ended up wearing a poker face. She found chatting with him in such a casual manner actually rather comfortable.Gu Jingyu was a little different from what the rumors said. He did not seem that difficult to get along with, so she had know why entertainment reports all stated that he did not like talking, did not like contacting people, and was very difficult to get along with in person.From interacting with him, he was actually quite amicable.Gu Jingyu only stood up when it was his turn to film again.He specifically told the director that he was free today, so they could film tomorrow\u2019s scenes with Lin Che today as well.His scenes with Lin Che had no elements of romance; they were more like camaraderie among brothers. Having rehearsed for quite some time, they were already familiar with their lines and completed filming basically in one take.The director hurriedly complimented Gu Jingyu by saying, \u201cJingyu\u2019s acting is simply great. He finished filming in one take with no hesitation.\u201dGu Jingyu was long used to hearing compliments like these. Nonchalantly, he received the water that his assistant gave to him and took a mouthful of it before saying, \u201cNo way. I think Lin Che\u2019s acting is very good. There is a lot of chemistry when I work with her. She\u2019s not bad.\u201d His pair of almond eyes curved as he looked at Lin Che.Beside them, the director froze.Then, he quickly said to Lin Che, \u201cYes, yes. It was precisely this quality of hers that we took a fancy to. Although she\u2019s a rookie, her acting is really not bad. She has potential.\u201dUpon hearing this, Lin Che looked at Gu Jingyu gratefully. A little encouragement from someone in her early days as an actress really made her happy for a long time.\u201cThank you, Senior Jingyu. Thank you, Director,\u201d she quickly said.Gu Jingyu looked at Lin Che, \u201cWhy are you calling me Senior Jingyu? Just call me Jingyu.\u201dLin Che smiled as she looked at Gu Jingyu. She felt even more strongly that he was a really good person.On the other hand, the director was behind them reflecting on what had just happened. He looked at her meaningfully and thought that this little lady was extremely lucky. How could it be that the usually unapproachable Gu Jingyu was so thoughtful towards her after knowing her for such a short time?When he initially chose her, it was only because he thought that her image was very suitable. She was refreshing to look at and difficult to forget. But he did not expect Gu Jingyu to treat her so specially.The moment the filming ended, Gu Jingze called out of the blue and asked Lin Che where she was.Bewildered, Lin Che asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cI\u2019m coming to pick you up.\u201dLin Che paused before quickly giving him the address. She did not expect Gu Jingze to some to send her home.Very soon after, Gu Jingze arrived.Today, he was driving a less flashy black Bentley that looked like it was meant for business.However, the license plate was still showy. The plate number was 12321.What kind of bad taste was this?Lin Che got into the car and asked, \u201cWhat made you think of picking me up?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. She had just finished her scenes, so she still had makeup on. She looked like a water lotus that was extremely exquisite and beautiful.Looking away, he said, \u201cOh, the Gu family wants me to bring you back, so I came to pick you up.\u201dLin Che thought,That explains it.But he did not have to explain it so clearly though.Lin Che sat down comfortably and said, \u201cWhy do they want me to go back so suddenly? Is it really alright if I go back?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to meet them sooner or later. What are you worried about?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWhat if they don\u2019t like me?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her, \u201cThey will.\u201dThey would like anyone as long as it was not Mo Huiling, Gu Jingze thought.The Gu family mansion was larger than Gu Jingze\u2019s place. It looked like a compound of connecting courtyards and it inevitably made her feel immensely stressed.Seemingly picking up on her anxiety, Gu Jingze said to her, \u201cMy family members won\u2019t eat you up. Just relax.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time meeting my in-laws. Of course, I\u2019ll be nervous.\u201dGu Jingze smiled. \u201cSo you have your nervous moments too. That\u2019s rare.\u201dLin Che glared at him. \u201cOf course. I said that I\u2019m very professional. Since I agreed to be your wife, I will definitely fulfill my duties. As for these duties, they also include making your family members like me.\u201dThen, she saw the large metal gates inside opening and the butler coming out to welcome them.\u201cSecond Young Master, Young Madam.\u201d The butler respectfully led them in. As she looked at the strict security inside, she suddenly felt much more stressed.After entering the house, the interior design was modern and the marble floors were glowing. Before they had taken even a few steps, an extremely elegant lady walked towards them.\u201cYou\u2019re Lin Che? We\u2019ve finally met. Jingze has hidden you away too strictly the past few days. Otherwise, I would have gone over and met you from the start,\u201d she said as she grabbed Lin Che\u2019s hand passionately.Gu Jingze made introductions from the side, \u201cThis is my mother.\u201dWhen Lin Che heard this, she quickly smiled and said, \u201cMother.\u201dUpon hearing this, a smile immediately bloomed on Mu Wanqing\u2019s face. \u201cGood, good. Good daughter-in-law. You called me Mother. I must give you a red packet too.\u201dAs she said this, the maid came up to her from the side and handed over a red packet that had been prepared earlier.Lin Che was shocked and felt a little embarrassed. Gu Jingze merely stood there and quietly nodded to her.She could only take it as she thought to herself,This is probably a formality in their family.Thus, she smiled and replied, \u201cThank you, Mother.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, come, let me introduce you to everyone.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMu Wanqing pulled Lin Che away and introduced her to an old man with a head of white hair who looked dignified at first glance. She told Lin Che to address him \u2018Grandfather\u2019.Lin Che followed suit and called him Grandfather. She also heard Gu Jingze respectfully call him Grandfather from the side.Soon after, her hands were stuffed with another stack of red packets.Gu Xiande looked at Lin Che. Although it was their first time meeting, his gaze fixed on her eyes in satisfaction before he nodded and said, \u201cNice lady, live well with Jingze.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jingze is really not thoughtful. Her clothes are too tight, so how uncomfortable would she be if she wore this at home?\u201dQuickly, the maid respectfully led Lin Che to change her clothes.As Gu Jingze watched her leave, he heard Gu Xiande saying from inside, \u201cThis lady is not bad.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIs it because it\u2019s not Huiling that you think she\u2019s not bad?\u201dGu Xiande looked at Gu Jingze. \u201cOne look at her and you can tell she\u2019s neat and natural. She\u2019s a good woman. Compared to that Huiling of yours, one is heaven and the other is dirt.\u201dMu Wanqing also smiled and said, \u201cYes, I liked this lass from the moment I saw her. Your grandfather has never complimented anyone. If he says she\u2019s good, she must be very good.\u201dMu Wanqing\u2019s words were indeed true. Gu Xiande was critical towards people. He would not easily give out compliments.It was really rare that Lin Che could make Gu Xiande open his mouth and give her a compliment.Gu Jingze did not expect that Lin Che would so easily gain the affection of his family members. Mu Wanqing simply said, \u201cSince you\u2019re here anyway, just stay for the night.\u201dLin Che was shocked. She quickly looked towards Gu Jingze, but did not expect him to say without any hesitation, \u201cOkay.\u201dAt that moment, Lin Che only felt a string of question marks whizzing across her mind.It was only after Gu Jingze brought Lin Che into his room and Lin Che saw the two doors close that she lifted her head and asked Gu Jingze, \u201cWhy do we have to stay here?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIs there anything inappropriate about staying here?\u201d\u201cOf course! I\u2019m so unused to staying here.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. \u201cWhat else can we do? If we tell them that we want to return home, won\u2019t it draw a bit of attention to what we\u2019re trying so hard to hide?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWe can\u2026 we can say that we\u2019re blissful newly-weds and we make too much noise at night, so we\u2019re worried about disturbing them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cThe room is completely soundproof. There is no such problem.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che was totally speechless. As she looked at him, she thought to herself,That was exactly what she meant.In any case, it would have been better to find any random excuse but instead, he had replied so solemnly.Lin Che could only glance at him before turning her head to sweep her eyes across the room. Its size could not compare to that of the Gu residence. It was a suite with a bedroom inside. There was a simple study room outside, a big executive chair, and no couch\u2026Lin Che held her forehead gloomily and thought about how they were to sleep for the night.However, Gu Jingze had already removed his jacket. He looked at the bed and said to her, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the floor tonight. You sleep on the bed.\u201dUpon hearing this, Lin Che\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She did not expect him to actively suggest sleeping on the floor. It made her a little touched. But she was also embarrassed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I sleep on the floor? Anyway, I only need to lay on more blankets.\u201dAs she said this, she walked to the wardrobe and opened it. She discovered rows of his various clothes hanging inside. She decided that they were very beautiful and looked extremely expensive. However, there was not a single blanket.Good lord, his family must have done this on purpose.Refusing to believe it, Lin Che said, \u201cI probably can\u2019t sleep on the floor. There\u2019s only one bed, so why don\u2019t we ask someone to send in another set\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you trying to tell them clearly that we sleep on separate beds?\u201d\u201cThen what do we do now\u2026\u201dUpon seeing her eagerness to keep her distance from him, Gu Jingze could not help but feel slightly irritated.He removed his jacket and threw it directly onto the bed. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you do, but I\u2019m going to sleep anyway.\u201dLin Che glanced at him. This person had just said earlier that he would sleep on the floor, but now that he knew that there were no blankets, he was about to fight for the bed.\u201cNo. I want to sleep on the bed too. You were the one who insisted on staying here so think of a way to resolve this.\u201d She did not believe that he could not solve these problems.As she said this, she jumped onto the bed directly, burrowed into the blankets, and rolled back and forth once across the bed. Then, she lifted her chin towards him with a look full of defiance. \u201cRight now, the bed is completely covered with my smell, the bacteria on my body, and everything else. Do you still want to sleep here?\u201dWhile saying this, she even licked her hand and rubbed it all over the blankets as she refused to be outdone.Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened. \u201cLin Che, what are you doing?!\u201dLin Che lifted her head. \u201cWhat? You haven\u2019t seen how dogs claim their territory? They just piss on it to prove that it\u2019s theirs. I\u2019m doing the exact same thing right now. Now, this bed is mine.\u201dGu Jingze pointed to the blanket. \u201cI\u2019m referring to what you were doing just now!\u201d\u201cWiping off my drool. Why? Do you want some?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dJust the thought of how she had wiped her drool on the blanket made Gu Jingze feel uncomfortable. He shot a pointed look at her, turned around, pulled open the door, and walked out.Lin Che immediately started laughing out loud in the room. \u201cYou admitted defeat so easily, Gu Jingze. You\u2019re not good enough.\u201dFeeling proud, she rolled around on the bed. However, she suddenly saw the door opening again and Gu Jingze walked in without hesitation. His gaze fixed on her aggressively and made her feel slightly guilty for a moment. She stepped backward.\u201cHey, Gu Jingze. What are you doing? I was just kidding earlier\u2026\u201d she said quickly.But she watched as Gu Jingze jumped onto the bed directly, pulled Lin Che over, and easily carried her over his shoulder.Gu Jingze\u2019s body was extremely strong. He was obviously tall and well-built. When he really took action, his movements were clean and efficient.On his shoulder, Lin Che was struggling recklessly. \u201cGu Jingze, what are you doing? Let go of me!\u201dShe punched him with her small fists, but they were of no use.The door opened and Lin Che was immediately thrown out of the bedroom and into the small study room outside.As she watched the door close in front of her eyes, Lin Che banged on the door angrily. \u201cGu Jingze, are you a man or not? You\u2019re fighting with a woman over a bed.\u201d\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t tell which part of you is like a woman,\u201d Gu Jingze said bluntly.Even angrier, Lin Che felt as if her lungs were about to catch on fire. \u201cYes, I don\u2019t behave like a woman. Your Huiling is the most feminine person there is.\u201dGu Jingze said candidly, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dLin Che\u2019s felt stifled when she heard this. \u201cThen, why don\u2019t you go look for her? You can\u2019t do that so you\u2019re just going to bully me instead?\u201dHearing her say this, Gu Jingze felt very annoyed. He simply said, \u201cYou think that if I could, I would still be here now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201dOutside, Lin Che looked at her surroundings. There was only a large executive chair that was impossible for her to sleep on. On the other hand, the high-quality carpet was extremely comfortable. She sat down on it and tested it out. It was very soft too. However, she could not just sleep here like this.\u201cGu Jingze, you really have the heart to make me sleep here? It\u2019s so cold here.\u201dInside the room, Gu Jingze\u2019s heart softened as well when he heard Lin Che\u2019s tone softening.However, when he looked at the bed that she had messed up completely, he was filled with anger again. He walked over and lifted the blanket. Indeed her scent still lingered on the blanket, but it was slightly refreshing, enough to make his heart flutter.\u201cHow can there be a husband who treats his own wife like this? Gu Jingze, are you really that cruel?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze pulled away the blanket and recalled that she had even spread her drool on it.Subconsciously, he felt even more uncomfortable. He said in her direction, \u201cYou\u2019re tall and strong. Nothing will happen to you, even if you sleep outside for one night.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Che truly and completely gave up hope. As she laid there, she thought to herself in disappointment,Gu Jingze, just you wait.Just because he had Mo Huiling in his heart, he was so cruel to other women.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Venting your anger out on me for no reason\u2026 are you even a man?! You don\u2019t have the guts to defy your family. Also, you don\u2019t have the guts to reveal to Mo Huiling that you married me only because of her. You\u2026 you\u2019re just a cowardly man,\u201d Lin Che scolded him angrily before hearing the door click. It was completely locked\u2026Gu Jingze did not make a single sound the entire time.Lin Che laid there waiting for a long time, but Gu Jingze did not react at all. She hugged her arms as she lay down and could not help but wonder if she had gone too far out of line when speaking to Gu Jingze earlier.To be honest, it was understandable for him to be angry. Because of one mistake that she had made, it changed his initial plans for life. Of course, he was angry.If it was not for her, his family may not have pressured him so and may also not have used Mo Huiling to threaten him immediately into a marriage. What happened with Lin Che gave his family hope, which was why the situation thus became so urgent.However, Lin Che was in a very unfortunate situation too. She had merely wanted to cook up a scandal but instead, she had inexplicably given up her first time.Thinking about it, she still felt gloomy.Lin Che ultimately fell asleep after letting her thoughts run wild, having toiled throughout the day.Alone in the room, Gu Jingze heard the din outside gradually turn silent. However, he lay on his arms, unable to fall asleep.He only opened the door to the bedroom when he wanted to go to the bathroom.Lin Che was curled up into a ball at the entrance and she looked very uncomfortable.Gu Jingze walked over and looked at her silently. After some time, he lowered his head and reached his arms out to lift her up.Lin Che was indeed very light as he carried her in his arms. He still felt as if she was weightless. Her sleeping face was scrunched up and had a tinge of roundness unlike her sharp chin when she was standing. When he looked at her now, she looked more like a baby sleeping sweetly. From time to time, she would stick out her tongue slightly to lick her cherry-red lips.He carried her to the bed and looked at her silently before shaking his head and going into the bathroom.When he came out, she was still in deep sleep.He lifted the blanket and burrowed under it, thinking to himself that both of them could put up with this arrangement since it was for just one night.Who knew that during the night, Lin Che did not keep her limbs to herself while sleeping.Just when Gu Jingze finally felt sleepy after his bout with insomnia, a hand suddenly hit his body.He gritted his teeth as he looked down at her slender hand. He pushed her hand aside and flipped his body over, unwilling to bother with her.Finally after turning drowsy once more, he again felt a leg rest itself over his thigh.Just like that, he alternated between sleep and awakeness for some time. After God knows how long, he gradually fell asleep due to fatigue after seemingly getting used to her attacks.When she woke up in the morning, Lin Che realized with surprise that she was actually on the bed.However, she could not remember how she had gotten there.Could it be that Gu Jingze suddenly discovered his conscience last night and carried her onto the bed?But at this time, Gu Jingze was nowhere to be found in the room.Lin Che quickly ran out, only to see that the entire family was seated and eating breakfast in the dining room.Gu Jingze ate his breakfast blankly, not sparing Lin Che even a glance.Mu Wanqing smiled and called out to Lin Che, \u201cCome and sit down.\u201dLin Che could only glare at Gu Jingze sneakily. This guy\u2026 was he not intentionally humiliating her? He did not wake her up even after he woke up, making her become the last person to reach the dining room.Lin Che sat down and said sheepishly, \u201cSorry, I woke up late.\u201dAll smiles, Mu Wanqing said, \u201cNo worries. You must have been tired yesterday night. Jingze didn\u2019t wake you up because he adores you.\u201dIt would be a wonder if he really did adore her.She looked at Gu Jingze who was just holding his spoon elegantly. He looked like a dignified Persian cat that was eating, his every movement so meticulous that it made him good-looking.However, he did not look at her at all.Mu Wanqing\u2019s words were ambiguous and made Lin Che feel even more embarrassed.She had been tired last night because she had quarreled with Gu Jingze for almost half the night. In the end, not only did she fail to win, but she was also really exhausted both mentally and physically.When Lin Che recalled this, she could not help but glare at Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze caught her gaze this time, turned to her, and rolled his eyes.Mu Wanqing saw their interaction and immediately started smiling.It looked like the two of them interacted quite a lot.When she initially made the two of them marry, she was still worried that their relationship would suffer due to Gu Jingze\u2019s overly aloof personality. But now, it looked like they actually got along pretty well.This child, Gu Jingze, was different from his two brothers. He did not like talking and did not like dealing with people either. He was arrogant and overbearing. When she made him interact with a girl, she usually saw no reaction from him at all. It was really surprising that he could interact with Lin Che in such a manner..Mu Wanqing said, \u201cLin Che, you\u2019re really too skinny. Eat more.\u201dAs she said this, she hurriedly piled food on Lin Che\u2019s plate.Lin Che said frantically, \u201cNo need, there\u2019s no need. I can help myself, Mother.\u201d\u201cNo way. You\u2019re really too skinny.\u201d Mu Wanqing continued, \u201cNow that you\u2019re part of the family, we must make you plumper.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cDoes being slim not look good?\u201dMu Wanqing said, \u201cBeing slightly plumper looks good too. Why? Who dislikes it? Does Jingze dare to give you the cold shoulder for being plump?\u201dGu Jingze looked at Lin Che.She was indeed a little too skinny. When she placed her arms on the table, the expanse of skin was white and clear, and her arms looked like they would break if someone tried to bend it.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me to dislike,\u201d he said.Mu Wanqing said, \u201cSee, I told you Jingze wouldn\u2019t dislike it.\u201dLin Che looked at Gu Jingze. Of course, he did not dislike it. They were in a fake marriage anyway. It would be fine as long as his Huiling did not get fat.So Lin Che curled her lip and said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t listen to him. Men are all the same. Although they say that they\u2019ll like you whether or not you\u2019re fat, they still like slim women in their hearts.\u201dAfter hearing this, Mu Wanqing paused before laughing out loud.There were waves of laughter at the dining table. As Mu Wanqing looked at Lin Che, she truly started liking her more and more. Her words were amusing and her personality was refreshing. She was not pretentious at all.After eating, Mu Wanqing even gave them a heap of food to take away before reluctantly walking them out of the house.Lin Che walked away from the Gu residence with Gu Jingze. In the car, Lin Che tugged at Gu Jingze and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your mother to be such a nice person. Before this, you talked about her as if she was very difficult. You scared me to death.\u201dAs Gu Jingze looked at her face brimming with happiness, he gazed at her deeply.He was very surprised too. It seemed like everything proceeded smoothly when she came to the Gu residence. He could tell that everyone, whether it was his grandfather or his mother, all liked her very much.However, he still could not help but say, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not Mo Huiling, my mother likes everyone else.\u201dAs expected, Lin Che turned her head to glare at him. She pursed her lips and thought to herself that this man was really a jerk.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che suddenly remembered that she still had many red packets yet to be opened. She decided to take them out and started opening them.When she opened them and took a look, she saw that the thick red packets did not hold money. They held title deeds.Shocked, she flipped open the deeds and was then truly astounded. The red packet that his family had given her was actually a piece of land behind a mountain in B city. The red packet that Grandfather had given also did not contain money. It was the ownership of an apartment in the central business district.Lin Che yelled out in surprise. \u201cGood lord, is this a red packet?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cYour family is really too generous!\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze said, \u201cAs the Gu family\u2019s Young Madam, you deserve it.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cSo these are all given to me?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cOf course they are.\u201dLin Che looked at the title and property deeds before raising her head. \u201cThey are too valuable. How can I accept them?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cJust take them. They\u2019re supposed to be given to the Young Madam of the Gu family and you are, in fact, the Young Madam. Thus, you don\u2019t have to feel uncomfortable.\u201dLin Che thought that his words made complete sense. While smiling, she looked at the two red packets repeatedly. \u201cIt looks like there are some benefits to tolerating your bad temper.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. \u201cYou money-grubber.\u201dLin Che was in a good mood. She turned her head and said, \u201cOtherwise, what else is the point of marriage? It\u2019s either for love or for money. Obviously, marrying you out of love doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s only money that would make sense.\u201dGu Jingze shook his head speechlessly. He looked at her smiling until her eyes became slits. Her cheeks also became slightly rounder. They were white but tinged with a little red and she actually looked a little cute.His gaze fixed upon her for some time before he turned his head. However, right at this moment, he saw that his phone was ringing. It was a call from Mo Huiling.However, Gu Jingze subconsciously glanced at Lin Che beside him first. Seeing as she was still scrutinizing the title deed in detail, he picked up the phone.However, his voice was slightly softer than usual.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cJingze, you promised to celebrate my birthday with me tonight. I called to confirm which restaurant we should go to. What do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday. You decide,\u201d he said.\u201cAlright. Then I\u2019ll make a reservation at the Western restaurant we usually go to.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cJingze, are you feeling unwell? Why is your voice so soft?\u201d Mo Huiling asked, confused.Once again, Gu Jingze cast a sideways glance at the person beside him. When he saw that she had raised her eyes and looked over, he subconsciously felt a little guilty. However, he said into the phone, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m in the car. We\u2019ll discuss it again when I get home. Let me know after you make the reservation.\u201d\u201cOh, alright.\u201d Mo Huiling hung up the phone.Gu Jingze put his phone away and looked at Lin Che. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dNaturally, Lin Che had heard that he was having a conversation with Mo Huiling. Pretending to be calm, she shrugged her shoulders and said, \u201cNothing. Only the two of us are in the car. Who else can I look at besides you?\u201dAs she said this, she lowered her head again and started touching the title deeds while looking like an extremely engrossed money-grubber.Gu Jingze drew in a deep breath before turning his head away.Lin Che thought to herself,Forget it. It was a fake marriage from the outset anyway. It\u2019s none of my business that he\u2019s dating someone else.The money in her hands was still the most reliable.Very soon after, they arrived home.However, the car had just turned around a corner when another car suddenly knocked into it abruptly.Within a mere moment, the car was dented on one side and smoke immediately started rising from the front.Several cars that had been stealthily following behind quickly rushed over. When the car door was opened, everyone saw Gu Jingze and Lin Che hugging together tightly\u2026When that accident occurred, Lin Che did not realize what was happening. It was only when she was laying on his stiff and hard body that her head felt a little clearer.However, the inside of the car was in a complete mess. Gu Jingze\u2019s expression was somber and as cold as ice. His eyes seemed to be unfocused before they finally focused on Lin Che\u2019s face.She quickly said, \u201cHow are you feeling? Gu Jingze, are you alright?\u201dThe car had knocked on his side of the car and it scared her to death.However, Gu Jingze just stared at her pale face. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and lifted her arm in one swift motion.On her thigh, there was an obvious slash and it was impossible to discern what was blood and what was flesh.Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened immediately.\u201cAll of you, move aside. Madam is injured.\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s voice was unexpectedly a little dull and hoarse. Without waiting for the people outside to react, he had already pulled Lin Che\u2019s arms towards him and carried her out from below.In the split second that the accident had happened earlier, it was Lin Che who had flung caution to the winds and threw herself onto him.If not for her, he would have been the one injured this very moment.Lin Che only felt a surge of pain on her body after he lifted her up in his arms. Thereafter, the pain began to intensify.The people outside were shocked. When they saw Gu Jingze carrying Lin Che as he walked out hurriedly, they quickly followed behind him noisily.At the hospital.Lin Che had lost an excessive amount of blood, causing her to feel weak and feeble. She looked at Gu Jingze beside her and felt his hand holding hers. She did not know why, but with the heat of his palm consoling her with its warmth, she seemed to feel that it was not all that painful anymore.However, when she looked down, she saw that his white shirt had been drenched in blood.She could not help but laugh. She looked at his cold face and said, \u201cGu Jingze, I\u2019m not dying now right?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s heart froze. He subconsciously scrunched up his face as well. His chilly gaze rested on Lin Che in a castigating manner, but he did not dare to be too fierce. \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting? You\u2019re not going to die.\u201d\u201cBut I lost a lot of blood,\u201d I said.\u201cThe doctor is treating you. You lost a lot of blood only because a major artery in your thigh was slashed.\u201cAh, a major artery\u2026 it sounds scary. Tell me. If I die, will you be able to free yourself immediately and fly away with your Miss Mo?\u201dGu Jingze face darkened. There were turbulent waves in his jet-black irises and his brow furrowed. \u201cShut up, I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d When he heard the name \u2018Mo Huiling\u2019, he actually felt slightly impatient. The feeling of not wanting to mention her silently surged in his heart.If she had not called, he would not have been constantly distracted and he would have realized the abnormalities outside.Lin Che said, \u201cReally? But it really hurts.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her small face all scrunched up. She was as pale as a sheet of paper and her small and weak lips were shriveled together. Her appearance made his heart seize up.He raised his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that? Madam said that she\u2019s in pain. Get the doctor to treat her quickly!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQin Hao had been following him by his side. When he saw an expression of extreme gloominess overcast Gu Jingze\u2019s face, he quickly turned around to urge the other people to increase their pace.Gu Jingze\u2019s gaze stayed on Lin Che\u2019s face. When he saw her turning her head away seemingly to hide her pain, his eyes darkened. He used his large hand to turn her face towards him. As he pinched her delicate chin, his gaze was black. \u201cLook at me. Don\u2019t overthink.\u201d\u201cMkay\u2026\u201d she hummed, but she still could not bear the pain.Gu Jingze\u2019s gaze landed on her lips, which had dried and shriveled from the excessive loss of blood. Her lips were slightly parted, her breathing was heavy, and her brows had converged. He pinched her chin and turned his body to move closer to her before directly blocking her lips, which had been continuously opening and closing\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With one forceful suck, all of her blood seemed to begin flowing backward and a feeling of numbness immediately spread across her entire body.Lin Che\u2019s eyes widened. As she looked at his perfect face in such close proximity, a fragrance embraced her. It was tinged with the heat of ambiguity and it caused her to suddenly forget her pain.Her fingers clutched his strong hand as the heat still in his palm traveled into her hand in threads.She did not feel an ounce of pain again until the doctor stitched her wound up.Until Gu Jingze slowly released her lips.Her scent was as sweet as he remembered.After he released her lips, the remnants of desire lingered between his teeth.It might have been the earlier spike in adrenaline that had allowed Lin Che, who had lost an excessive amount of blood, to stay awake all this while. However, when the doctor stood up and said that he was done treating her, she laid down and fainted immediately like a broken string that was released.When Lin Che woke up, she realized that there was an expanse of blue around her. There were various types of apparatus in operation.She froze and struggled to get up only to pull her wound below that left her feeling a stabbing pain. However, she sensed that someone was still holding her hand.It was only then that she saw Gu Jingze laying by the bedside, fast asleep.Her slight movement caused him to open his eyes instantly. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dHe looked at her with slight anxiousness. \u201cIs there anything wrong with you?\u201dHe looked a little tired. Lin Che could not help but wonder if he had stayed here accompanying her for the entire night.Lin Che quickly said, \u201cNo, no. I just pulled on my wound slightly.\u201dUpon hearing this, Gu Jingze rushed to stand up and lifted the blanket to check her wound.It was still tightly bandaged and probably would not lead to any complications.He let out a sigh of relief and frowned at her. He said, \u201cBe a little more careful. Don\u2019t move around for no reason.\u201dIn the last night, she mumbled from time to time and her groaning made him feel uneasy.He could only hold her hand like this and stay beside her throughout the night. It was only when dawn approached that he succumbed to his tiredness by laying down and falling asleep.Qin Hao could not bear to see him like this and wanted him to sleep in the adjacent hospital room. But each time he moved, Lin Che would grunt a few times.Thus, he lifted his hand and gestured for Qin Hao to leave. He stayed here looking after her the entire night.Fortunately, the doctor said that although a major artery had ruptured, the bleeding had stopped and she was going to heal with timely treatment.However, a large amount of blood flowed from the major artery, so even though the bleeding stopped, there was still an excessive amount of blood loss, which caused her to feel very weak.The doctor also said that it was highly dangerous for the major artery there to bleed. If not for the timely treatment, she would have likely died within a short amount of time.Lin Che felt that she seemed to be in much better spirits as she looked around the luxurious VIP ward. If not for the excessive number of apparatus, it really looked nothing like a ward. She knew that she was probably alright now. At the same time that she heaved a sigh of relief, she suddenly remembered. \u201cOh no, what about my title deed and my property deed?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her, dumbfounded. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dLin Che was shocked. \u201cNo way!\u201dShe had tossed it aside somewhere in her moment of anxiety. How could it be that no one kept it for her?Lin Che said, \u201cHow could this happen? It\u2019s such an important thing.\u201dGu Jingze gazed at her deeply. \u201cFine. If it was really so important, then why didn\u2019t you hug your title and property deeds tightly and huddle into a corner? You even tossed them aside and jumped on me.\u201dHe felt slightly apologetic towards her. He did not expect her to actually react that way.Lin Che blinked. \u201cI forgot what happened. Maybe I did it in a moment of impulse.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. \u201cDon\u2019t do it again next time. It was too dangerous.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cOf course. After being taught a lesson this time, I know what to do next time. It\u2019s just because this was my first time and I didn\u2019t have experience, so I didn\u2019t know where to hide.\u201dGu Jingze shook his head.Lin Che said, \u201cOh right. My property deed and title deed can be recreated?\u201d\u201cOf course. If your name was on them, then they\u2019re yours.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Lin Che seemed to be relieved.Gu Jingze said, \u201cOkay, money-grubber. Since this problem has been solved, it\u2019s time for you to eat something.\u201dThe doctor said that she could eat when she woke up, so he had already asked someone at home to make something for her in advance.Now that she was awake, he called for someone to bring it over. However, she still wanted to move, so Gu Jingze pressed her down. \u201cI\u2019ll feed you. Just stay still.\u201dLin Che looked at him with surprise.Gu Jingze had already set down a small table. He picked up the spoon and carefully scooped out a spoonful of porridge. Bringing it to his mouth, he blew on it before bringing it towards Lin Che.Lin Che watched his series of movements. They were smooth from beginning to end and it looked extremely good. She could not help but smile.She opened her mouth and ate it in one bite, but subconsciously bit on the spoon.Gu Jingze furrowed his brow. Looking at her lips, they were slightly redder than they were yesterday with a slight moistness brought out by the rice porridge. His throat bobbed and his brow turned a little more severe.\u201cOh\u2026 sorry,\u201d she said vaguely after swallowing the porridge in her mouth without sensing anything different about Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze said, \u201cCan you eat a little more carefully?\u201dAlthough his tone was impatient, he still reached out his fingers to wipe off the porridge trickling down from the corner of her mouth.His fingers touched her soft and tender lips. A slight feeling of numbness seemed to spread from his fingertips.Right at this moment, his cell phone that he had placed at the side suddenly started ringing.In response, Gu Jingze put down the bowl and looked at his cell phone.It was a call from Mo Huiling.Gu Jingze glanced at Lin Che before picking up his phone and walking out to answer it.Lin Che blanked out. Watching the door close, she thought to herself,There\u2019s no need to think to know who is calling.When Gu Jingze answered the call, he heard Mo Huiling\u2019s worried voice.\u201cJingze, why didn\u2019t you come yesterday night? You didn\u2019t answer any of my calls either.\u201dHis phone had rung once during the night but at the time, Lin Che was still in a coma. Worried that it would disturb her rest, Gu Jingze immediately instructed Qin Hao to take the phone out of the ward.Upon hearing the indignance in Mo Huiling\u2019s voice, Gu Jingze said, \u201cSomething cropped up last night, so I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what cropped up, Gu Jingze. If it happened on any other day, it would have been fine. However, yesterday was my birthday. How could you make me wait for you for so long alone?\u201d Mo Huiling started to cry again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze knew that Mo Huiling was very prone to crying. However, when he heard her cry at this moment, he could not help but think that Lin Che was actually not such a crybaby. Even though she had been in so much pain yesterday to the point where her teeth were chattering and she thought that she was about to die, she did not even shed a single tear.Gu Jingze said, \u201cThings were really quite urgent yesterday, so I didn\u2019t go over. I\u2019m sorry, Huiling. The next time we meet, I\u2019ll talk to you about this properly again.\u201d\u201cThen will you come to see me tonight?\u201d Mo Huiling\u2019s voice weakened.Gu Jingze pondered for a while. \u201cI\u2019m afraid today won\u2019t work.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he saw that the doctor had arrived, he followed him into Lin Che\u2019s ward.The doctor had already examined Lin Che\u2019s injury. The wound on her thigh was recovering well and she was going to be able to walk again very soon.Gu Jingze watched from the side. Within the time that he went out to answer a call, she had already completely cleaned out the food. Not only that, she had even started a discussion with the doctor about how the room looked so good.She was truly heartless and ungrateful.Gu Jingze looked at the scar on her thigh and said to the doctor, \u201cCan the scar on her thigh be removed?\u201dThe doctor rushed to speak to Gu Jingze, respectfully and cautiously, \u201cThat depends on the individual\u2019s body constitution. Seeing as Madam doesn\u2019t usually have any scars, she doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind to have scars. It\u2019s possible that she will recover, but\u2026 with a scar this deep, it\u2019s likely to leave a bit of a scar.\u201dWhile stitching up the wound, he had especially used a method of stitching that would not leave a scar. But now, the wound still looked jagged.Gu Jingze did not want any scars to be left on her body. As he looked at her wound, he frowned deeply. \u201cI hope there won\u2019t be a single scar on my wife\u2019s body. Get your best doctor to come up with a solution.\u201dWhen the doctor heard this, his face paled and he quickly nodded repeatedly.When Lin Che saw the doctor leave, she lifted her head to say to Gu Jingze, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019ll definitely leave a slight scar. But it\u2019s alright. If I\u2019m filming I can just cover it up with foundation.\u201dBut Gu Jingze gazed at her deeply and said, \u201cNo. If this hospital can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll look for the best doctor on earth to give you the necessary treatment. I will definitely not leave you with a single scar.\u201dAs Lin Che looked at his somber expression, she felt a slight warmth in her heart. She smiled at him and said, \u201cWhy? Will you dislike me for the scars on my body? Seriously, a wife who shares her husband\u2019s hardships must never be cast aside. Did you hear that? No matter how ugly I get, you cannot cast me aside.\u201dGu Jingze was speechless for some time. He looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cRelax. I won\u2019t cast you aside. I just don\u2019t want to see scars on your body.\u201dHe did not want to see her get hurt especially because of him.As he looked at Lin Che dressed in a striped hospital gown, he recalled her white, soft and flawless skin. He immediately felt uneasy realizing that it could become marred by such a large scar all because of him.Lin Che moved slightly as she said, looking at him, \u201cOr is it because you feel guilty when you look at it?\u201dGu Jingze glared at her. \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201dHowever, he indeed felt a little guilty.Lin Che said, \u201cIf you really feel guilty, then treat me a little better from now on. It\u2019s good enough if you don\u2019t throw me out for no reason.\u201dGu Jingze froze. He recalled the day when he left her at the entrance.His anger had been triggered only because of her overly foul mouth.From the moment he was born, there had never been a single woman like her who was audacious enough to speak to him like this.But right now, as he gazed deeply at Lin Che, he merely said softly, \u201cOkay.\u201dLin Che raised her head in surprise. As she looked at Gu Jingze, she went into a momentary trance.What did he just say?Gu Jingze shifted his gaze, lowered his head, and properly arranged the medicine that the doctor had given. He then started to pour water for her to take the medicine.On the first day, Lin Che\u2019s wound was still hurting slightly but because the hospital had already used the best medicine on her, she did not feel that terrible.That night, when it was about time, Lin Che felt a little dazed and was about to fall asleep. She looked at Gu Jingze through her narrowed eyes and asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do tonight?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019ll just sit here.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back and sleep?\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll sit here and watch over you.\u201d When Gu Jingze thought of leaving her here alone, he just felt that she would be too lonely.After all, she was not like other people who were surrounded by their family members. She only had him as her husband.Lin Che said, \u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary\u2026 maybe you can go outside and find a place to sleep.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cNo, there are so many apparatus here at night and you also need someone to watch over you. I\u2019ll just stay here.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 then\u2026\u201d Lin Che was a bit touched. She looked at Gu Jingze and then looked again at her own bed. The bed in the VIP ward was much bigger than the usual bed.She pondered for a bit and decisively patted her own bed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come up and sleep here? The bed is big enough too.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s gaze flashed stealthily as he looked at the place that she had patted.However, a slight feeling of secret delight flitted by in his heart.As a matter of fact, he did not feel repulsed at all.Seeing as he neither rejected her suggestion nor agreed to it, Lin Che said again, \u201cWhy? Are you afraid that I\u2019ll jump you? In that case, I\u2019ll put the pillow in the middle. The bed is so big. It\u2019s completely possible for us to sleep separately.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s brow furrowed slightly. \u201cAlright, alright. Then, we\u2019ll do just that. Let\u2019s rest early.\u201dWhen she saw that he had really agreed, Lin Che quickly shifted to the side to give him space.Gu Jingze tidied up for a bit before getting onto the bed.They slept on opposite sides with a pillow between them.However, Lin Che had overestimated herself. Although she lay there like this, she kept feeling like she could sense the breathing of the man beside her despite the fact that he seemed to have fallen asleep long ago and was staying completely still.Fortunately, the effect of the medication caused her to finally fall into a deep sleep quickly.Gu Jingze sensed that the person beside him was no longer tossing and turning and her breathing had gradually quieted down. He knew that she was probably already asleep.Heaving a sigh, he flipped to his other side and tried to fall asleep too.However, just when he was about to fall asleep, a leg suddenly landed harshly on his body.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes darkened.This Lin Che, was her thigh not hurting anymore?Her injury did not improve her bad sleeping posture.To not touch her wound, he grabbed her slender thigh and carefully pushed it aside.But then, a soft arm landed on him again.Gu Jingze thought that unless a knife was put between them, nothing else placed there would be able to obstruct this hyperactive woman.He carefully held her arm, turned his head, and gently placed it back.But then, he came face to face with her quiet, asleep face.Her red lips were bright and moist. Right now, it seemed like this hardy woman was already vastly different from the woman who was about to die yesterday. She had rapidly regained her vitality.Then, she arched forward.Gu Jingze paused. He sensed that her lips were already brushing his face.If he moved a little, he would be able to touch her soft, red lips.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moistness of her lips sent a slight shiver through his body and a jolt of electricity seemed to pass through him. Staring at her mouth, he suddenly felt his mouth go dry.However, she once again began to move randomly. Her small lips directly brushed against his lips. A wave of dry heat made Gu Jingze furrow his brow deeply.\u201cLin Che, you\u2019re playing with fire!\u201d In a threatening tone, he spat out a warning through pursed lips, \u201cI dare you to try moving again!\u201dHowever, Lin Che obviously did not hear his hoarse voice at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had a perfect shape and were moist and soft like the wet and red flesh of fruit. However, they also seemed to carry a hint of seduction.He turned his head and gently moved closer.However, just as he inched closer, her pair of big eyes that had been tranquil suddenly opened.His aloof face froze there and then as he looked at Lin Che\u2019s glazed eyes.At that moment, she felt that the distance before her eyes was a little ambiguous. In turn, she rubbed her eyes in a daze.The effect of the medication had also robbed her of her rationality.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d As she looked at his sensual and perky lips before her eyes, she felt her heart itch.\u201cSleep properly.\u201d He let out a dry cough and stretched his hand out to cover her eyes.Soon after, her breathing evened out again.On the other hand, Gu Jingze turned his head away and did not glance at the woman beside him again.But when he closed his eyes once again, he could still feel her arm attacking his chest.He frowned but he seemed to have gradually gotten used to her occasional attacks. He soon went straight to sleep.On the second day, Gu Jingze was already long gone when Lin Che woke up.It was only when she was done washing up that Gu Jingze brought breakfast over.Lin Che\u2019s thigh no longer hurt and accordingly, her mood also took a turn for the better. She looked at Gu Jingze and said, \u201cJust like I told you, it\u2019s definitely possible to sleep like we did last night. Look at how much sharper you look.\u201dGu Jingze merely glanced at her silently. He did not talk about how he had found her sprawled across his body when he woke up in the morning and how she had drooled on his neck.Just the thought of that made him feel an itch on his neck.Very soon after, the doctor came to change Lin Che\u2019s bandages again. Looking at her wound, it seemed to have gotten much better. However, the scar was still hideous and Gu Jingze continued wearing an unpleasant expression.\u201cDoctor, when will my wife\u2019s thigh recover completely?\u201dThe doctor heard Gu Jingze\u2019s low voice as he asked this and quickly said, \u201cThis will need\u2026\u201dBefore he could respond, Gu Jingze\u2019s cell phone started ringing.Gu Jingze took a look. It was Mo Huiling.Still waiting to hear the doctor\u2019s response, he rejected the call.Sensing the situation, the doctor continued, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201dBut right at that moment, his cell phone started ringing again.Gu Jingze looked at his cell phone a little impatiently. Mo Huiling\u2019s name kept flashing on the screen. At the side, Lin Che lifted her head and said, \u201cGu Jingze, pick up the call first and we\u2019ll discuss it later.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face tensed. He glanced at Lin Che before reluctantly turning away and walking out while holding his phone.He picked up the phone, his impatience showing slightly in his voice. \u201cHuiling, is something the matter?\u201dMo Huiling pouted playfully through the phone and said, \u201cWhy did you reject my call earlier?\u201dGu Jingze was still mulling over the doctor\u2019s words and said into the phone, \u201cI was busy just now. Why?\u201dMo Huiling said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to celebrate my birthday and after that, you didn\u2019t care about me either. Jingze, what exactly is up with you?\u201dGu Jingze recalled the day of her birthday. Because of the car accident that happened that day, he did not meet her and thereafter, he was busy attending to Lin Che\u2019s injury.\u201cI\u2019ve just gotten busier recently.\u201d Because the accident had not been made publicly known, Gu Jingze did not tell Mo Huiling either.\u201cNow that I\u2019m ill, won\u2019t you come and visit me too?\u201d Mo Huiling whined.\u201cYou\u2019re ill?\u201d Gu Jingze asked.Mo Huiling choked back a sob and said, \u201cI want you to come and keep me company. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re busy with. Jingze, if you don\u2019t come to see me, I definitely won\u2019t get better. Right now, I feel like I\u2019m about to die soon.\u201dWas it actually that severe? To the point that she was about to die?After Gu Jingze returned to the ward, he said to Lin Che, \u201cSomething happened to Huiling. I have to go over and take a look.\u201dLin Che spaced out. She looked at him and nodded her head. \u201cOh, go ahead. There are so many people watching over me here. Nothing will happen anyway.\u201dGu Jingze nodded and glanced at her meaningfully before walking over to her. He reached his hand out to tuck her into the blanket and positioned her exposed leg properly.\u201cI\u2019ll call someone to look after you. You move too much when you sleep. Make sure not to touch your wound,\u201d he said.Lin Che said in surprise, \u201cWhen did I move in my sleep?\u201dWhat happened last night came to Gu Jingze\u2019s mind. He snorted to her and said, \u201cYou say you didn\u2019t move when you nearly flew to heaven. In any case, be a little more careful. Don\u2019t be so restless. If it starts to bleed again, your leg will be good for nothing.\u201d\u201cOkay, stop nagging. Quick, go look for Miss Mo. Doesn\u2019t she have some urgent matter?\u201dAfter thinking, Gu Jingze agreed with what she had said. He nodded his head and went out.He reached Mo Huiling\u2019s house after driving for only half an hour.Mo Huiling\u2019s room was like a princess\u2019s room. She lay swaddled in her blanket as she listened to the noises outside.When she vaguely heard the sound of a car, she quickly looked at her clothes.Gu Jingze walked in very soon after only to see Mo Huiling lying on the bed with half of her body exposed. Although she said she was ill, there was actually still make-up on her face while she laid in bed. Under the blanket, her silk night clothing covered her only slightly. She cast soft glances at him\u2014ones that were as soft as silk\u2014making her look extremely enchanting.Gu Jingze blanked out. He looked at her as she lay there and softly hummed. She said, \u201cJingze if you didn\u2019t come quickly, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to see me anymore.\u201dGu Jingze walked over hurriedly. \u201cHow did you fall ill when you were completely fine?\u201dWith the knowledge that he was coming, Mo Huiling had especially gotten someone to tidy up the room. She sprayed on a fresh-smelling perfume and also personally selected a sexy nightgown. Her freshly-bathed body carried some tenderness and loveliness with it. She looked at him gently and said grudgingly, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I only know that on the day you didn\u2019t come, I cried the whole night. After that, I couldn\u2019t eat anything too. I called numerous doctors to come over, but all of them didn\u2019t know what was wrong. I thought I was dying.\u201dHow was she about to die?Lin Che was the one who almost died.Gu Jingze could not help but think of Lin Che. As he looked at Mo Huiling, he was slightly angry. \u201cHuiling, I didn\u2019t go to your birthday party that day because something cropped up suddenly on my end. I really could not leave. Furthermore, it was a matter of life and death. I had no time to spare on other matters which includes this very instance of you suddenly calling for me to come. I really shouldn\u2019t have come at all. It\u2019s only because you said you\u2019re ill.\u201dHow was she really ill?He felt that Mo Huiling was truly too thoughtless this time.Mo Huiling took a glance; Gu Jingze was actually really angry.In the past, he could never even bear to say a single heavy-handed word to her.She did not feel that this had anything to do with Lin Che either. Her eyes darted around as she figured that the matter he had to deal with must have been a very serious matter, which was why he was this angry.She burst out crying immediately. With tears running down her face, she quickly said to him, \u201cJingze, I had no idea if something had happened to you. I was just too worried about you. I love you too much. That\u2019s why I was also very upset. You could have told me if something was up. However, you aren\u2019t even aware that I cried the entire night that day. I kept calling your number, but none of my calls got through.\u201dHe watched as Mo Huiling started crying sadly. Her words were indeed moving and Gu Jingze\u2019s heart softened. He lowered his voice and said to her, \u201cAlright, sorry Huiling. I spoke too severely because I was too anxious. It was I who didn\u2019t handle things properly that day and made you worry.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Huiling was still crying relentlessly.Gu Jingze could only pat her shoulder. \u201cAlright, Huiling. I truly apologize.\u201dUpon hearing his sincere apology, Mo Huiling thought to herself,As expected, he still could not bear for her to cry.She bit her bottom lip and said wretchedly, \u201cAs long as you know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was why he never had the desire to touch her when he saw her. But right at this moment, he still felt uncomfortable all over as if he was about to break out in a rash soon.His brow furrowed as he looked towards her. \u201cDid you do something to the room? Why do I feel a little uncomfortable?\u201dMo Huiling paused before saying, \u201cI\u2026 I sprayed a bit of perfume here.\u201dGu Jingze sighed and looked at her. \u201cHuiling, you could\u2019ve told me directly that you wanted me to come and see you. But how can you say that you\u2019ve fallen ill?\u201dGu Jingze asked in a calm voice because he had known from the moment he entered that she was feigning illness.Mo Huiling was shocked, never expecting him to see through her plans. Currently, she was still biting her lip as she said, \u201cI just thought that you didn\u2019t want to come and see me, so I\u2026\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head only to see that he had indeed broken out in a rash.When Mo Huiling saw that Gu Jingze was looking around the room with a slight expression of dislike showing on his face, she quickly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go out and sit instead.\u201dLuckily, she had chosen a very beautiful nightgown. She got up and adjusted herself gracefully. Gu Jingze looked down her body, finding her dressing overly skimpy, but he made no comment and kept the thought to himself. He smiled at her and walked out.Gu Jingze knew that Mo Huiling looked very sexy dressed like this. However, perhaps because he knew that he would break out in a rash upon touching her, he still felt no attraction at all despite her being so beautiful.Seeing as Gu Jingze did not even look at her, Mo Huiling felt slightly disappointed for a moment. However, she got used to it gradually and thought to herself that this was just the way he was anyway. Ever since he fell ill, he could not get aroused from women.He had no interest in her and he would have no interest in Lin Che either.She said to Gu Jingze, \u201cEat something with me before you go back.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cOkay, I didn\u2019t eat anything before coming over either.\u201dUpon hearing that Gu Jingze was so anxious when he heard she was ill, Mo Huiling smiled happily. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get someone to make some steak. You must compensate me at home here with my candlelight dinner.\u201dHowever, the maid came over and said, \u201cMiss, the power at home has been cut. There\u2019s no way to cook anything.\u201dMo Huiling yelled angrily, \u201cHow can this be? Make a call and ask about this. Settle this for me immediately!\u201dThe maid said in a troubled tone, \u201cMiss, this half of the city has no power. They said that it got cut while maintenance works were being conducted on the circuit. They\u2019re still rushing to fix it.\u201dMo Huiling was insufferably angry. How could such an unfortunate thing happen? It was so rare for Gu Jingze to come. They could have eaten dinner together, drank some wine, and if he felt too tired, he could have stayed overnight.When Mo Huiling thought of how he had a wife living in that house with him, she simply felt uncomfortable letting him go home now.Gu Jingze said, \u201cForget it, Huiling. Don\u2019t trouble them.\u201d He had indeed not eaten and was hungry. After thinking for some time, he said to the maid without further ado, \u201cIf there\u2019s a solid-fuel stove, just buy some cup noodles for us to eat.\u201dUpon hearing this, the maid stared with widened eyes for quite some time. Mo Huiling did the same. Surprised, she said, \u201cYou want to eat cup noodles?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cYes, Huiling. If you eat cup noodles once in a while, it still tastes pretty good.\u201d Thereafter, he said firmly to the maid, \u201cJust go buy some cup noodles for us.\u201dNot daring to neglect his instructions, the maid hurried out.Mo Huiling looked at Gu Jingze with hesitation. \u201cWhy did you suddenly think of eating this?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIt\u2019s really quite nice. Try eating it and you\u2019ll know.\u201dOf course, Mo Huiling did not want to eat it. How could people of their status casually eat that kind of junk food?However, it was difficult for her to reject since Gu Jingze had suggested it.Soon, she saw the maid return with cup noodles. The maid brought it to the kitchen to prepare it and shortly, its aroma wafted out. It was very pungent and even masked the scent of the expensive perfume on her body. It made her feel even more repulsed.Frowning, she looked on as the cup noodles were served. Although it was garnished and presented properly, looking at it still made her feel disgusted.Looking at it, Gu Jingze thought that it looked very similar to what Lin Che had made the other day. In an instant, it worked up his appetite.He sat down and slowly began eating.Upon seeing him actually eat it with such relish, Mo Huiling was shocked. When she herself looked at it, she still found it difficult to swallow.With their status, it was not right for them to eat cup noodles. It could not compare to pasta.After finishing half the bowl, Gu Jingze noticed that Mo Huiling had managed to eat only two mouthfuls. He raised his head and said, \u201cWhy? Is it not good?\u201dMo Huiling could not hide the condescending look on her face. \u201cJingze, this is junk food. You shouldn\u2019t eat it either. It\u2019s not good for your body. And it\u2019s so dirty too.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s appetite immediately vanished because of her words. He looked at Mo Huiling. Even though he knew that she was referring to the cup noodles, he just felt as if she was calling Lin Che dirty.Unknowingly, he had associated cup noodles with Lin Che.He felt slightly unhappy but did not show it.He knew that he could not force Mo Huiling to like what she did not like. However, he was a little disappointed. He did not expect her to dislike it. So he simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t eat it if you don\u2019t like it. I know that this isn\u2019t too healthy.\u201dHe could understand; after all, Mo Huiling was like him. From a young age, both of them had received a distinguished and refined education. It was a given that they would not be used to things like cup noodles.Seeing that Mo Huiling was fine, he stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m full. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dLin Che was still in the hospital. It was fine for him to leave temporarily in the day but at night, she simply moved too much in her sleep. He could not be at ease letting someone else watch over her. In the event that she tore open her wound, the scar would only become larger.That would be too ugly for a girl.Furthermore, her skin was so beautiful. It was softer and whiter than snow. He could not bear for it to have a single blemish.\u201cAre you that busy?\u201d Mo Huiling felt slightly reluctant to part with him as she looked longingly at Gu Jingze.As Gu Jingze looked at her pitiful expression, he felt a tinge of hesitation. But when he thought of Lin Che, he steeled his heart on his decision to return.\u201cHuiling, I\u2019ll keep you company again when I\u2019m no longer busy.\u201dSeeing that he was so certain, Mo Huiling could only purse her lips and walk him out. She also knew that it was likely impossible to change his mind once he had decided on something.After Gu Jingze left, Mo Huiling turned back to look at the two bowls of noodles. She said fiercely to the maid, \u201cWho bought these cup noodles? Throw all of them out. Buying such dirty things and bringing them home\u2026 it smells horrible. Clean up the room thoroughly. I don\u2019t want to smell even a hint of this odor.\u201dWith nothing to do in the hospital, Lin Che surfed through the television channels and watched the entertainment news. She saw Gu Jingyu\u2019s interview during which he said that filming for the drama was still ongoing. Because of her injury, she had taken a few days off. Unexpectedly, the production team had immediately allowed her time off and did not trouble her at all.She saw that filming for the series was still proceeding like wildfire. She felt very anxious as well and wanted to quickly go back to participate in the filming. After all, this was a crucial opportunity for her, so she had no intention to easily give it up.As Lin Che pondered over the matter, Gu Jingze returned and saw her watching the television. Walking in, he asked, \u201cHave you eaten dinner?\u201dLin Che replied with an \u201coh\u201d. Seeing as he looked refreshed, she figured that he must have returned from visiting Mo Huiling. However, she did not point this out. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten. I\u2019ve taken my medicine too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe doctor said that I can be discharged tomorrow and rest at home,\u201d she said.Gu Jingze frowned, \u201cReally? I think you should still stay under their care for a few days.\u201dThe doctor had said so too, but Lin Che wanted to get back to filming quickly.She could only be Madam Gu for a few years. Sooner or later they would divorce, so she had to be able to hold her own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You Do So Many Unnecessary ThingsAtlas StudiosLin Che said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. This is just a small injury.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYou almost died. It isn\u2019t a small injury.\u201dLin Che said nonchalantly, \u201cI almost died because I hurt a major artery. The danger of dying was just momentary. Now that the artery has been repaired, everything else is fine. There aren\u2019t any major organs in the thigh anyway.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyes focused on her but after a long while, he finally said in a displeased tone, \u201cDo whatever you want. Your body is yours anyway.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, Gu Jingze turned and left.Lin Che blinked a few times, believing that nothing was amiss. She laid down and continued watching television.The next day, Lin Che was discharged and allowed to return home.She sat in a wheelchair which she found interesting since it was her first time sitting in such a contraption. Gu Jingze was supposed to carry her into the car. But when Lin Che saw that he was about to carry her, she said frantically, \u201cHey, don\u2019t move, don\u2019t move. Let me take a photo.\u201dWhile saying this, she raised her arm and adjusted her position. She took a photo of her wheelchair which automatically included her hospital gown.In front of her, Gu Jingze frowned. \u201cWhy are you taking a picture?\u201dLin Che raised her head, shook it, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Since I got hospitalized, I must pretend to be pitiful and elicit some sympathy.\u201dGu Jingze found it strange.What sympathy was there to elicit from such a thing?Lin Che repeated the process a few times. However, she felt that something was not right. After thinking for a bit, she asked the butler in front to move aside.\u201cYour car is such a good prop. Why don\u2019t I use it?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s pupils flashed dimly. Perplexed, he watched as she changed her position. She took a photo of her wheelchair with the Porsche as the background. While using the photo application in her handphone, she said, \u201cIf I take the photo like this, it wouldn\u2019t seem too intentional but it won\u2019t prevent other people from seeing it either. Hey, Gu Jingze. You probably don\u2019t understand. It looks like I\u2019m trying to get sympathy, but I\u2019m actually showing off to everyone that I have a Porsche. Do you understand?\u201dGu Jingze stood there speechlessly while looking at this vain woman.She added another filter to her photo again, making the photo look extremely high-quality as if it had been printed on photographic film. Thereafter, she posted it on Weibo, feeling pleased.He noticed that what she had written on Weibo was this: \u201cFinally discharged. These few days in the hospital have really been insufferable. I\u2019m grateful for the help of the medical staff.\u201dIt was accompanied below by the photo of her lower body sitting in the wheelchair and the very obvious Porsche behind her.Gu Jingze shook his head.She really had nothing better to do\u2026\u201cWhy did you post this?\u201d he asked.Lin Che raised her head. \u201cTo show off to the people on Weibo. Oh right, I\u2019ll share it on WeChat Moments too.\u201dOnly after sharing it with her friends did she let Gu Jingze carry her into the car.She continued looking at her Weibo and her WeChat Moments when the car engine started.Very soon after, she saw comments popping up on her Moments post.\u201cWhy are you sitting in a wheelchair? Did you get hurt during filming?\u201d\u201cYou poor thing, rest well.\u201dLin Che said to Gu Jingze, \u201cThese people are all fools. How could they miss my car? Look at this person instead. He noticed it.\u201dIndeed, there was a comment below stating, \u201cAiyo, have you found a sugar daddy? Isn\u2019t that a Porsche?\u201dLin Che laughed out loud, feeling extremely proud. \u201cYou see that?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face turned black.Lin Che said, \u201cAiya, do you think that after seeing me suddenly show off like this, they\u2019ll really think that I\u2019m a kept woman?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened even more.He was not an old man.Pinching her chin, Lin Che mulled over this for a long time before saying, \u201cBut doesn\u2019t that mean my family can see it too since Lin Li is on my friends list?\u201dSure enough, it did not take long for Lin Li to leave a comment.\u201cIs that a Porsche? Lin Che, what exactly are you up to?\u201dLin Che snorted and ignored her. Proudly, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she can tell that this Porsche cost tens of millions. Compared to her cheap BMW, one is heaven and the other is dirt.\u201dLin Che scanned her Weibo again, but not many people left comments there.Gu Jingze said, \u201cYou find doing something like this interesting?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cOf course. In the past, yours truly could only watch others posture. But today, I can finally do the same.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cWhat is there to posture? From what I know, the Lin family shouldn\u2019t be too poor. You should have seen a lot of this.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cBut those things are not mine. My father is incredibly stingy to me. In the past, he always sent Lin Li and the rest to school in a big Benz. But I went to school with the housekeeper\u2019s scooter.\u201dGu Jingze frowned and looked on as she scanned her Weibo indifferently.\u201cA lot of people look at this?\u201d he asked.Lin Che shook her head. \u201cNo. I may have been verified and I may be an actress, but I\u2019m not famous. I only have 2,000 fans following me, hehe. But one day, I will definitely make it so that I have one million, two million, even tens of millions of fans. I want to get tens of thousands of comments when I post on Weibo just like Mu Feiran.\u201dLooking at her speak so grandiosely, Gu Jingze shook his head. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll congratulate you beforehand on your success.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll definitely succeed!\u201d Saying this, she raised her fists resolutely.Upon seeing this, Gu Jingze could not help but smile. He shook his head and looked ahead.After returning home, Lin Che felt much more comfortable. Back at the hospital, all she saw was the apparatus in her ward and in actuality, it dampened her mood. Especially when she thought about how much it cost per day for her to stay in the VIP ward, she felt even more uncomfortable.Seeing that she indeed looked fine, Gu Jingze focused on his work the next day.When Lin Che saw that Gu Jingze had left, she insisted on going to the filming site.Butler Hu wanted to stop her, but Lin Che said hurriedly, \u201cNo way. How many days has it been? If I continue to be absent, the production team won\u2019t want me anymore.\u201dWithout a choice, Butler Hu could only secretly give instructions to watch over her more carefully.Lin Che arrived at the filming site and she even sat in her wheelchair all the way there.The film site was bustling and the production staff was not troubled at all by her absence. But when they saw her returning in a wheelchair all of a sudden, someone walked over to her and asked in a concerned tone, \u201cWhat happened? I saw your Weibo post. You even got hospitalized?\u201dBut Lin Che said simply, \u201cThere was a car accident. Luckily, only my leg got hurt and nothing else was affected.\u201dEveryone offered a few words of consolation and told her to focus on getting rest.\u201cYou\u2019re sitting in a wheelchair. You shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cNo way. Like this, I can still film some scenes of my upper body or of me sitting down. If I can film some scenes, I\u2019ll film them. Otherwise, the production team may not be able to keep to schedule.\u201dHearing this, the assistant director smiled and said, \u201cAlright. You\u2019re really professional. In that case, I\u2019ll have a word with the director and let you participate in the filming.\u201dLin Che thanked him. The moment she finished, she heard a low voice from behind her. \u201cYou have a Weibo account? How come we never mutually followed each other?\u201dIt was Gu Jingyu. She did not know when he had come up behind her.Shocked, Lin Che looked at Gu Jingyu and said, \u201cI followed you. It\u2019s just that you didn\u2019t follow me.\u201dHe had so many fans. How could he have noticed her?Gu Jingyu asked for her handle, \u201cI\u2019ll follow you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che looked at him in surprise. \u201cReally?\u201dGu Jingyu was a person who seldom followed anyone. There were only about twenty-something people in the list of those he followed.Lin Che quickly gave him her handle.He searched for it and followed her without hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She immediately felt a rush of joy.When she clicked into Gu Jingyu\u2019s Weibo page, she saw that his fan count was at twenty million. Even if he randomly posted a punctuation mark, he would get tens of thousands of comments. Indeed, he was an S-list celebrity\u2026And when she returned to her own Weibo page, she saw a notification. In an instant, thousands of people had followed her Weibo page. With one look she knew that those were the people who had trickled over after seeing that Gu Jingyu had suddenly followed her.After following her, they even left comments on her Weibo page saying things like, \u201cAre you an actress currently working with our Jingyu? Please help look after our Jingyu more. Our Jingyu has a weak stomach. You must watch him eat.\u201dAt last, Lin Che understood what a top idol was\u2026Lin Che said, \u201cWow. I benefited so much from associating with him. In such a short time, I nearly hit ten thousand fans.\u201dGu Jingyu patted his chest firmly. \u201cYea. Now, you know the advantages of hanging out with me. In the future, pay more attention to me.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. I\u2019ve always paid a lot of attention to you.\u201dGu Jingyu looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Do you know what I ate this morning? What time did I go to the washroom in the afternoon? What car did I drive here?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Lin Che really could not answer. \u201cHow can I possibly know these? You\u2019re putting me in a difficult position on purpose!\u201dGu Jingyu lifted his head to point at the production staff not far away from them. \u201cPick any person randomly and ask them now. All of them know. Hmph.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face filled with awkwardness. That was really too perverse.Gu Jingyu reached out a hand and caressed her head. \u201cFrom now on, pay more attention, you hear me? I\u2019ll let you off once today on account of your injury.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Big Celebrity Gu\u2026\u201d Lin Che thought that men from the Gu family were all similarly difficult to deal with.Very soon after, Lin Che finished filming the scenes that she could film. By that time, it was already deep into the night.When Lin Che bade everyone goodbye and left, she saw Lin Li leave at that moment too. Lin Li had taken notice of Lin Che and even looked like she was about to approach her. But before she could do that, she saw Gu Jingye already walking right beside Lin Che\u2019s wheelchair.Lin Li froze as she watched Gu Jingye strike up a conversation with Lin Che. Her face became overcast immediately as she turned around and walked away angrily.As Lin Che looked at Gu Jingyu who was following her again, she did not notice that everyone was looking at them strangely the moment Gu Jingyu came over.Gu Jingyu lowered his head and looked at her wheelchair. \u201cYou\u2019re going back?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take you back.\u201d\u201cAh, no need\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s on the way. Let\u2019s go.\u201dAs he said this, Gu Jingze did not wait for Lin Che\u2019s reply at all. He simply lifted his head and instructed someone to get the car.It was only when they were seated in the car that he asked Lin Che, \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che looked at him speechlessly. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know where my house is, but you said it was on the way?\u201dGu Jingze froze.This Lin Che, there were times when she was not that stupid.\u201cWhich is why I said when you pay attention to someone, it will still be on the way even if she lives at the ends of the earth. This is what I call paying attention to someone. Do you understand?\u201d As he said this, he patted her head again. \u201cQuick, tell me. Where do you live?\u201dLeft with no choice, Lin Che could only tell him her address.When Gu Jingyu heard it, he said in a confused tone, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to live in such an exclusive area. Cars are not allowed to drive in there.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cJust drop me off at the entrance. I\u2019ll get someone to push me in.\u201dGu Jingyu said, \u201cAlright, I know someone who lives there, so it\u2019s not convenient for me to go in. You can go in by yourself.\u201dThe car arrived at the entrance very quickly. He personally pushed her out of the car and escorted her to the entrance before leaving.Lin Che\u2019s embarrassment showed slightly as she waved to him before going in hurriedly.Gu Jingze had still not returned home.The family doctor had already changed her medicine and said that her wound was recovering swiftly because she was young. Just when Lin Che, who was seated on a couch, was feeling pleased with what he said, she heard her cell phone ring.Yu Minmin was calling.Lin Che quickly accepted the call and said, \u201cSister Yu, what\u2019s up?\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cHey, Lin Che, are you dating Gu Jingyu?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Che literally felt like she had heard some fantasy story. \u201cHow\u2019s that possible? No way.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cSome breaking news was just reported that stated that you and Gu Jingyu were discovered to be dating. What exactly is happening?\u201dLin Che could not immediately think of a reply either.After putting down the phone, she quickly looked at the news on her phone. Sure enough, she discovered that she had gone on the news.There were pictures of the two of them chatting together and of him sending her home. According to the reporter, Lin Che was a rookie on the team and Gu Jingyu had always treated her very well. This was correct, but everything else after was complete nonsense.The report said that she and Gu Jingyu mutually followed each other on Weibo and it looked like they interacted very frequently as Gu Jingyu never followed anyone casually. Among the actors of the entire production team, he followed no one but her. He didn\u2019t even follow Mu Feiran who was playing his love interest.Furthermore, on many occasions, the reporter took pictures of the two of them chatting on the set and even of Gu Jingyu sending Lin Che home.Upon seeing the report state these things with definite certainty, she was stunned.These reporters were too good at making up a story from pictures. With merely these few photos, they were capable of thinking up so many stories to write in their reports.Although she also understood that writing a report about Gu Jingyu would bring in money, this was too irresponsible of them.Lin Che hurriedly went to the company. The moment she wheeled her wheelchair in, she saw Yu Minmin coming out from inside.\u201cThis time, you\u2019re going to become famous. Earlier, many reporters came to ask about you.\u201dLin Che gave a sullen face. \u201cIs that so? I only saw people scolding me cruelly on Weibo.\u201dMany fans had come to her Weibo page crying and yelling. In one night, her Weibo fan count had indeed increased by a fair amount, but they were all haters.Below a recent post that she had made on Weibo, tens of thousands of people left comments scolding her. They all claimed that she was using Gu Jingyu to create hype.But what made Lin Che gloomy was the fact that from the beginning, she had been the passive party.Yu Minmin looked at Lin Che and observed her for some time before asking, \u201cIf you\u2019re really dating Gu Jingyu, you can tell us too. The company doesn\u2019t prohibit you from dating either.\u201dLin Che quickly started begging. \u201cSister Yu, just let me off. I\u2019m really not dating him. We are indeed on fairly good terms, but we only talk about the drama. He did send me home, but only because he saw that my leg was not in a good condition tonight. We followed each other mutually on Weibo earlier today only because he coincidentally saw me posting on Weibo. He felt like he was being rude by not following, so he followed me.\u201dAfter hearing this, Yu Minmin felt that there was really nothing unbelievable about her words.But after pondering for a bit, she looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cThen\u2026 is this Gu Jingyu wooing you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Che was stunned. \u201cSister Yu, please don\u2019t joke around with me. That\u2019s impossible.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYu Minmin\u2019s eyes darted around. She said to Lin Che, \u201cYou do know that Gu Jingyu is very seldom on good terms with people in the same production team, much less with a woman, right?\u201d\u201cReally? But I think he\u2019s quite a nice person and he\u2019s very decent. When we talk, it\u2019s really always about the drama. Occasionally, we\u2019ll chat about other things, but I have absolutely no ulterior motives towards him.\u201dShe did not want to say that she was already a married woman. How could she have ulterior motives towards anyone?Especially when Gu Jingyu was her brother-in-law.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In any case, the situation has already turned out this way. The company will think of a way to help you deal with it, but you must be more careful too. Go out less for the time being.\u201dLin Che sighed and said, \u201cI was doing fine but something like this had to happen\u2026\u201dYu Minmin smiled and said, \u201cA scandal with Gu Jingyu\u2026 other people want it so badly but can\u2019t get it. Right now, you\u2019re already someone who can make the headlines. You\u2019ve gotten famous before your works have. How great is that?\u201d\u201cSister Yu, you say that because you haven\u2019t seen how those people are cursing me.\u201d She pulled out the comments on her page. After seeing her selfies, those people did not mince their words. They said that she was very ugly and completely hideous. They said that with one look, they could tell that she had excessive plastic surgery and that she was not good enough for their Gu Jingyu.She was so furious that she could literally die from anger.Sister Yu said, \u201cThis might be sensationalism created by the production team of your television series. After filming for the series starts, wave after wave of promotions will begin first in order to create momentum in the future. It might be something they intentionally created. It\u2019s quite possible this is one of them.\u201dLin Che was flabbergasted as she said in exasperation, \u201cIn that case, they should have told me in advance.\u201dSister Yu said, \u201cOf course they wouldn\u2019t tell you. And even if you go and ask them, they won\u2019t admit it either. The relationship between the production team and our company is inherently a mutually beneficial one. Why would they discuss any moral implications with you? What if they told you, but you refused to cooperate? Then, what would they do? Alright, we\u2019ll leave it at that for now. Go back and have some rest first. It should be fine as long as you don\u2019t walk around outside.\u201dAfter hearing this, Lin Che could only agree. She was mentally prepared to return home, go with the flow, and await the company\u2019s arrangements.After she returned home, Lin Che was so tired that she did not want to move further after falling into bed. Because she had not gone to work for so many days, she lost her edge completely when she started getting busy like this.When Gu Jingze came home, he saw Lin Che sprawled out on the bed when he entered the room.\u201cLin Che, why did you run off to shoot the series? You haven\u2019t fully recovered, no?\u201dUpon returning home, Gu Jingze received Butler Hu\u2019s report which included the Madam\u2019s insistence on leaving to film. He had no choice but to send some people to follow her secretly just in case. However, they were merely servants and could not stop her.Afterwhich, Gu Jingze went directly to the room to look for her, only to see her lying on the bed and sprawled out on her back. One side of her underwear was exposed. It was pink with a floral border made from lace.Gu Jingze\u2019s throat bobbed. He looked at her while frowning, \u201cHey, can you be a little more careful when you lie down?\u201dLin Che said indolently, \u201cWhy must I be more careful? If I have to care about my image even in my own home, life would be so tiring.\u201dGu Jingze glanced around the room. He picked up the blanket from one side and placed it on her body directly, covering up her exposed skin.Lin Che wriggled her waist. \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s so hot.\u201dGu Jingze turned his head away. \u201cEven if you want to seduce me, you should at least change into an underwear that can do the job.\u201dLin Che blanked out. She lowered her head to take a look. She was wearing a homely pair of casual shorts that were on the loose side. Underneath it was her underwear, which was presently exposed.With a slight blush on her face, she quickly pulled her pants up. She lifted her head and said, \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t seen it before anyway.\u201dGu Jingze smiled. He came slightly closer and looked at Lin Che\u2019s clean, small face. Her white skin was tinged with red. \u201cSo you mean that since I\u2019ve seen it, I can see it whenever I want to in the future?\u201d\u201cOf course that\u2019s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d Lin Che stuttered and hurriedly took a step back.Gu Jingze smiled even wider. Seeing her this way, he could not help but take another glance at her again. He only went out when he saw the butler standing at the door as if he had something to tell him.Outside, Qin Hao was currently waiting at the entrance of the study room.Gu Jingze walked over in a few steps. \u201cIs something up?\u201dQin Hao wore a troubled expression. He walked over with hesitation, cautiously looking at Gu Jingze\u2019s habitually calm face. \u201cSir, Madam has been involved in a scandal outside.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s gaze wavered. He looked at Qin Hao. \u201cWhat scandal?\u201dAs he said this, he had already taken the newspaper article to read.The article reported Gu Jingyu\u2019s suspected romance that wrote about a deeply touching story about the love between him and Lin Che, a new actress in the same cast as him.Gu Jingze did not usually pay attention to any entertainment news, so it was only now that he was seeing this.However, the report was about Gu Jingyu and his wife\u2026Qin Hao said, \u201cThird Young Master and Madam are together filming a fantasy television series that the Gu family is investing in. That\u2019s probably how they got to know each other.\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head and said, \u201cPut down the article. You can go.\u201dQin Hao hurriedly retreated and left.After Lin Che had taken a rest, she nestled on the couch in the living room while watching television.She switched the channel and coincidentally saw the news on her and Gu Jingyu.According to the news, Gu Jingyu was receiving tremendous attention this time for filming this fantasy television series. But to everyone\u2019s surprise, there were no sparks between him and the lead actress Mu Feiran. Instead, there were rumors involving him and a new actress.However, the reporters had yet to receive an official response from Gu Jingyu\u2019s company, so they were still unclear on the validity of the rumors for the time being.Lin Che rubbed her forehead.What did they mean? Was it degrading to be involved in a scandal with her?Angrily, she switched channels immediately. But then, she heard a low and somber voice from behind her.\u201cWhy did you change the channel after seeing me approach?\u201dGu Jingze was standing upright behind her. He looked at Lin Che and walked over in a few steps.Lin Che said frantically, \u201cAh\u2026 you saw this?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face turned gloomy as he gazed at Lin Che meaningfully and sat down in a casual posture. He spread open the newspaper and swept his eyes across it. \u201cYes, do you have anything to say?\u201dLin Che rushed to explain. \u201cI didn\u2019t do this on purpose. I don\u2019t know which reporter fabricated this nonsense. You know it\u2019s impossible if you just think. In reality, I\u2019ve only known Gu Jingyu for a short time. We\u2019re both quite unfamiliar with one another.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rumor?\u201dHis gaze was unfathomable but as Lin Che looked at him, she still nodded quickly. Secretly, she felt that Gu Jingze was definitely unhappy. Everything else aside, her being involved in a scandal with Gu Jingyu\u2026 it would be strange if he was glad.\u201cSorry, Gu Jingze. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I know that we\u2019re already married. Even though it\u2019s a contractual marriage, we agreed that we\u2019ll be responsible towards one another. It\u2019s difficult to make sure that your family won\u2019t overthink it if they see this. I\u2019m afraid you have to give them some explanation that this is just some sensationalism created by the production team. It has nothing to do with us\u2026 we don\u2019t even know how word got out\u2026\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression seemed to deepen.His inscrutable eyes restrained any expression from showing and made them look even more smoldering.The moment she saw this, Lin Che rushed to say, \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll go explain. I stirred up this trouble, so I\u2019ll be responsible for explaining to your family. I won\u2019t cause you any inconvenience. I didn\u2019t do it intentionally either. Next time, I will definitely be more careful. I\u2019ll try my best not to cause you any trouble. My company is already handling this matter and I believe Gu Jingyu\u2019s side doesn\u2019t like scandals either, so they will definitely deal with this matter properly to the best of their abilities. You don\u2019t have to worry. Soon, no one will bring up this matter again.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHm, I\u2019m not angry. Isn\u2019t this just how the entertainment industry is?\u201d Gu Jingze stood up leisurely from the chair.However, he looked at her meaningfully with a piercing gaze like an icicle that stabbed her cruelly. Thereafter, he walked up the stairs in quick steps without looking back once.Didn\u2019t he say that he wasn\u2019t angry\u2026Lin Che sat there feeling like she had just been ruffled by the wind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he was done, she was supposed to rest further. But when she entered the room, she saw no trace of Gu Jingze.She quickly held back a maid and asked, \u201cYour Sir is busy?\u201dThe maid said, \u201cMadam, Sir has been in the study room all along. He didn\u2019t come out at all.\u201dLin Che pondered for a bit before wheeling herself to the study room.\u201cGu Jingze?\u201d She knocked on the door and said, \u201cGu Jingze, what\u2019s up with you? Are you angry?\u201dHowever, there was no movement inside.Lin Che said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that it won\u2019t happen again in the future? Also, it really wasn\u2019t something I initiated. I\u2019m also very confused as to how things became like this. What else do you want me to do\u2026\u201dRight at this moment, the door opened swiftly.Gu Jingze looked at her with a steely expression. \u201cWho told you that I was angry?\u201d\u201cUh, this\u2026\u201dBut with a swish, the door was shut again.Lin Che was once again shut off outside the door. Flabbergasted, she said, \u201cAnd still, he said he wasn\u2019t angry\u2026\u201dHe really said one thing but meant another.Left with no choice, she pushed her wheelchair outside only to see someone walking in from the outside.It was a man who looked to be in his thirties, dressed in a blue suit from head to toe.She had never met him, so her bewilderment showed on her face.When the man saw her, he immediately smiled and walked over to her. \u201cMadam Gu, we finally meet. Nice to meet you.\u201dLin Che blanked out. She pointed at herself and said, \u201cYou know me?\u201dHis eyes crinkled as he smiled. He looked very reliable and very approachable.\u201cMadam Gu, I\u2019m Mr. Gu\u2019s doctor. My name is Chen Yucheng. You can call me Doctor Chen. You must have heard about me from Mr. Gu.\u201d\u201cHe never mentioned\u2026\u201d Lin Che said.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yucheng continued to smile with his eyes crinkled. He said, \u201cAlright, hehe. Mr. Gu is just that kind of person. He\u2019s firm in his speech but soft in his heart. In his heart, I actually carry some weight too.\u201dLin Che did not realize this at all.She looked at Chen Yucheng with a slight pity and said consolingly, \u201cYes, Gu Jingze has a personality that\u2019s weirder than normal. But it\u2019s fine after you get used to it.\u201dChen Yucheng was still smiling with his eyes crinkled. He looked to be a very pleasant and sunny person.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of you very early on. It\u2019s a true honor to be able to meet Madam Gu today. Eh, that\u2019s right. What happened to Mr. Gu? Why are you outside?\u201dAt a loss for words, Lin Che said, \u201cHe\u2019s not\u2026 he seems to be angry.\u201d\u201cOh? So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. What happened exactly? Can you tell me first?\u201dLin Che was still somewhat hesitant.As if he had sensed her hesitation, Chen Yucheng said, \u201cRelax, Madam Gu. I\u2019m aware of everything concerning Mr. Gu. As you know, he has been ill for many years. I\u2019ve been continuously following up on and studying his symptoms. So if anything happens, Mr. Gu will usually tell me everything, no matter how important or trivial the matter.\u201dSince he knew about Gu Jingze\u2019s illness, he was likely a person that Gu Jingze was close to and trusted.Thus, Lin Che told him about the matter.When he was done listening, Chen Yucheng wanted to burst out in laughter. He raised his eyes and seemed to have thought of something.Lin Che said as she was vexed, \u201cWhat do you think? What should I do now? I\u2019m wondering if he is so angry because he regrets marrying me? If it were Miss Mo, there definitely wouldn\u2019t be so many troubling matters. If Miss Mo was together with him, it would definitely be great. It would be very peaceful and there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble springing out of nowhere. In comparison, he must be missing Miss Mo more right now. So when he looks at me, he must be wondering why he married a troublemaker like me.\u201dChen Yucheng burst out laughing and said, \u201cThis is what you told him?\u201dLin Che looked at Chen Yucheng. \u201cWhat should I have said otherwise?\u201dChen Yucheng shook his head speechlessly. \u201cI think it\u2019s normal for him to be angry.\u201dLin Che said gloomily. \u201cIf he\u2019s angry, how do you usually calm down?\u201dChen Yucheng said, \u201cWith regard to this, the only people who usually make him angry are his employees. As far as I\u2019m aware, he should be mollified as long as he fires them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFire her?Wouldn\u2019t that mean a divorce?\u201cBut I reckon we shouldn\u2019t be able to get a divorce for the time being.\u201d Lin Che continued, \u201cHowever, this matter does indeed cause him excessive inconvenience. He has to explain to his family members and furthermore, the other party in the scandal is his brother. But I can\u2019t think of any other way either. I said that I would explain to them instead that it definitely wouldn\u2019t affect him and that I also wouldn\u2019t let the Gu family discover that our marriage was contractual. What else can I do about all other matters?\u201dChen Yucheng looked at her helplessly. \u201cYou said this to him earlier?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I was also this sincere when I told him earlier.\u201dChen Yucheng looked at her with the expression of someone shouldering an arduous task. \u201cI think that he was already being pretty good to you by not strangling you to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHow could it be that serious?Chen Yucheng said, \u201cMadam Gu, you can continue staying here and thinking of alternative methods. I\u2019ll go over and take a look at how your husband is doing.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Che watched blankly as he went in.After God knows how long, Lin Che had already woken up from a nap, but Gu Jingze had still not returned for sleep.Slightly worried, Lin Che got up and wriggled herself into the wheelchair. She came before the study room once again.She knocked on the door and said, \u201cGu Jingze, are you inside?\u201dGu Jingze made no sound.Lin Che thought gloomily for a bit. She raised her leg and looked at it. An idea came to her mind. \u201cGu Jingze\u2026 my\u2026 my leg hurts. Where\u2019s the doctor?\u201dIn a moment, the door opened noisily.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes were narrowed and his brow was slightly hidden. His eyes were as cold as ice which made him look very sinister.But when he looked at Lin Che, he assessed her for a bit before asking, \u201cYour leg hurts?\u201dWhen Lin Che saw him, she quickly held onto her thigh. \u201cYes, it suddenly hurts badly. I don\u2019t know what to do either.\u201dGu Jingze swiftly squatted down. He looked at her. She was dressed in shorts with bandages covering the wound on her thigh. It looked like there was nothing wrong.He instantly reached out a hand and pressed her thigh. \u201cDoes it hurt here?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, it hurts so badly.\u201dGu Jingze raised his head. He seemed to sense that something was wrong. He narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cIt really hurts?\u201d\u201cOf course, could it be that you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d Lin Che quickly put her acting skills to use. She furrowed her brow and bit her lip. \u201cOh no, it really hurts to death.\u201dOf course, Gu Jingze could tell that she was exaggerating and acting.But as he looked at the expanse of the wound, he actually felt that at any rate, it was better to go to the hospital for a checkup. If it was really hurting\u2026In his heart, he was not willing to let himself take that risk.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThus, he immediately stood up and said, \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll make some arrangements. We\u2019ll go to the hospital.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Upon hearing this, Lin Che knew that she had put on too much of an act. Just when she wanted to stop him, Gu Jingze had already gone in and picked up his cell phone. He quickly dialed a number and gave some instructions that Lin Che could not hear. Thereafter, he came out and said directly, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go out and wait.\u201dHe pushed Lin Che towards the exit in her wheelchair and very quickly, they arrived outside. Lin Che felt a strong wind blowing and looking up, she saw a helicopter actually landing from the sky. Brandishing its humongous propeller, it landed slowly in this huge courtyard.Seeing that she felt cold, Gu Jingze reached out his hand to remove his clothes and placed it over her body. Then, he carried her up from the wheelchair in one swift motion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was only when she got seated in the helicopter that she jolted from her daze.Lin Che was stunned. As she looked at the massive machine, she could not help but ask, \u201cWhy\u2026 why are we going to the hospital like this?\u201dGu Jingze said from beside her, \u201cIt\u2019s too far. This is faster.\u201dLin Che looked at him. \u201cActually, my injury isn\u2019t in need of such urgent attention.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her with a perfectly calm expression. \u201cBut you must know that I have other things to do tomorrow morning. If we drive there, it will take one hour and coming back will take one hour. By the time we reach home, it will probably be dawn.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cThe helicopter will be there in about ten minutes so be prepared.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Lin Che looked at Gu Jingze. She thought to herself,This was precisely the way the rich dealt with things.She had to get used to it\u2026As expected, they landed on the top floor of the hospital about ten minutes later.Gu Jingze refused to let her move and carried her down first.He carried her all the way in before putting her down.While the doctor was examining her, Lin Che felt slightly guilty. The doctor said, \u201cWhat kind of pain are you feeling?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 hurting faintly.\u201d She thickened her skin, not daring to look at Gu Jingze who was standing to the side. She didn\u2019t want to meet his eyes.The doctor took a look and said, \u201cMadam Gu, your wound isn\u2019t inflamed and there aren\u2019t any other symptoms either, so the pain may be psychological. Don\u2019t be too stressed. Think of other things. Perhaps, you won\u2019t feel the pain anymore.\u201dThe doctor had no choice either; he could only provide such a diagnosis.Lin Che nodded her head vigorously. \u201cSo that\u2019s why it hurts.\u201dAs Gu Jingze was watching from the side, Lin Che quickly flashed a pandering smile. Gu Jingze\u2019s deep, dark eyes moved meaningfully before he glared at her.But he still said to the doctor, \u201cTo be on the safe side, we\u2019ll still stay here for one night.\u201dLin Che could only agree.The room was still the same kind of intensive care room as before. Gu Jingze had made arrangements at the entrance and just as he had expected, if they had taken the helicopter here and went through the entire ordeal, it would already be early dawn.Lin Che sat there guiltily. She looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s thin lips pressed tightly into a line. The lines of his jaw also followed suit, clenching tightly. He looked as cold as ice and very difficult to approach.Against her will, her heart drummed faster in her chest.When she saw him turn around to look at her coldly, she quickly flashed a toady smile. \u201cIt has been hard on you. Go to sleep quickly.\u201dGu Jingze glared at her before sitting down.Lin Che said hurriedly, \u201cGu Jingze, come over here. I want to talk to you.\u201dGu Jingze snorted and sat there unmoving.Lin Che steeled her mind and came down the bed directly.But when she went down and her heels hit the ground, her thigh was pulled and she began to hurt as well.She hissed as she held onto her thigh and nearly fell.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes darkened. Tossing everything else aside, he quickly walked over in a few steps. He stretched his arms out under her armpits and carried her directly.\u201cLin Che, why did you move recklessly for no reason?!\u201d Gu Jingze was furious. He had been so shocked by her earlier actions that his heart had almost jumped out of his chest.Lin Che was really hurting. Her brows were furrowed and when the light shone on her, her small face scrunched up slightly.Gu Jingze held her up and stabilized her. When he turned his head, his lips brushed against her earlobe.Her soft and tender earlobe even had some fine hairs on it. The fine hairs reflected the light shining on them and looked very cute.This instantly messed up his thought process and in turn, he frowned and wanted to let go of the wretched woman.But just as he was about to let her go, Lin Che pulled his arm with both hands. \u201cGu Jingze, stop being mad,\u201d she said softly and gently. She looked at him with a clear gaze, her expression particularly arousing his protectiveness.But Gu Jingze\u2019s gaze continued to rest on her ear thoughtfully. As he looked at her rounded, smooth and small ear, he had the crazy urge to suck it for some strange reason.Had his illness already started developing in the perverse direction?Why did his whole body heat up from looking at her small ear?He felt her hand still resting on his arm. The places that she had touched heated up even more, causing him to feel so agitated that he wanted to shrug her off.\u201cLet go of me, Lin Che.\u201d His expression began to darken even more. Seeing this, Lin Che became more anxious.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Gu Jingze\u2026 Hubby, don\u2019t be angry, don\u2019t be angry. When a married couple fights, shouldn\u2019t they eventually reconcile? Don\u2019t be angry anymore.\u201d Lin Che had really put all of her skills to use as she wanted to soften this difficult man.However, Gu Jingze\u2019s expression did not improve. The initial gloominess on his face was now tinged with some red instead. It looked as if he was extremely angry and it scared Lin Che so much that her voice became slightly weaker. \u201cHubby\u2026 Hubby, don\u2019t be angry. On account of me being so pitiful that I can\u2019t get down from the bed\u2026\u201dShe hugged one of his arms with both her hands. Like a little child, she pouted with her eyes and looked miserable as she shook his arm from side to side.As Gu Jingze listened to her increasingly gentle voice, he looked down at the arm that she was shaking. If he were to backhandedly grab her hands and push her directly onto the bed at this moment, she would actually fall underneath him.He violently resisted this impulsion that arose in his chest. But this damn woman\u2026 Couldn\u2019t she stay still for a while and not sway around? Her swaying made his eyes all dizzy.\u201cLin Che, I said let go of me! Do you not understand?\u201dFeeling somber, Gu Jingze yelled angrily.Lin Che took a look at him.Was he really angry now?Immediately, she loosened both her hands but she lost her balance and instantly fell backward.Seeing this, Gu Jingze stretched his hand out and wrapped it around her waist.However, he was pulled down by her momentum. Facing the direction in which she was falling, he fell down together with Lin Che.Lin Che\u2019s eyes widened. She felt his soft, thin lips, smash heavily on her mouth.That handsome face enlarged before her eyes, his face flushed slightly red.Lin Che felt a pain on her chest.She looked down only to see his chest pressing on hers.Instantly, her face turned completely red too.This time, Gu Jingze could clearly feel her breasts on his chest.However, he looked at Lin Che and immediately rolled to the side and quickly detached himself from her body. His movements were as fast as lightning.Lin Che\u2019s heart was still thumping without rest because of the sudden close proximity he was in earlier.Seriously, it was unbelievable. She almost had the urge to kiss him earlier.Was she crazy?Her mouth was on the verge of moving closer to his.Was it because she had spent a long time together with him that it was difficult for her to resist the temptation of his beauty?Indeed, Gu Jingze was very handsome and very sensual. Even the way he fell down earlier was absurdly beautiful. The perky shape of his lips was extremely seductive, but\u2026 his heart belonged to someone else.Lin Che was absolutely not the kind of person to forcibly take away the person someone else liked.Furthermore, Gu Jingze\u2019s earlier expression was obviously one of disgust.She suddenly covered her mouth with her hand and remembered that he was allergic to women.No wonder he kept wanting to push her away just now.Lin Che hurriedly raised her head. \u201cOh no, Gu Jingze. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose earlier. I momentarily forgot that you have an illness. That\u2019s why I pulled you and refused to let go.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression darkened, his handsome face lifting slightly. \u201cThe occasional touch is nothing.\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHm, just\u2026\u201d He looked at her chest. Unable to resist, he glanced at it again.At once, she very astutely discovered his gaze, captured it, and followed it, lowering her head together with him.Gu Jingze turned his slightly red face away and avoided her gaze to hide his expression. He said coolly, \u201cThe shape of your breasts is not bad. They\u2019re quite perky, so they probably aren\u2019t artificial,\u201d he intentionally said this in an indifferent tone.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why do I need to do surgery when they\u2019re shaped like peaches? They are not too hard or too soft, and they are of an adequate size! Furthermore, it\u2019s so obvious if you\u2019ve done surgery nowadays. If you lie down, you\u2019ll immediately be exposed. I\u2019m telling you. They say that after lying down, artificial breasts won\u2019t become flat because they were made arched!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze involuntarily looked at her breasts again.He forcibly shifted his gaze and said, \u201cYou sure know a lot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a given.\u201d Lin Che continued, \u201cI have a very extensive scope of knowledge.\u201dSaying this, Lin Che touched her leg unnaturally. Gu Jingze remembered that her leg had been hurting earlier and was worried about whether she had touched it. He rushed to say, \u201cAlright. Stop moving around and let me take a look at your leg.\u201dShe sat on the bed while he squatted down halfway. He pushed her pants aside and looked at her wound. Afraid that it would hurt, he cautiously touched it. \u201cHow is it?\u201dLin Che felt pretty alright and did not really feel anything. \u201cIt should be fine. It\u2019s just that when my foot lands on the ground, it pulls on the wound, so it hurts.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cThen you should stay still.\u201dLin Che thought,Wasn\u2019t she just anxious earlier?Wasn\u2019t it his fault for suddenly ignoring her?Gu Jingze raised his head to look at her, but his gaze was still fixed directly on her chest. He did not realize this in the past, but only now did he suddenly feel that her breasts indeed looked very appealing after looking at it from this direction. They were entirely symmetrical mounts and they looked round, full, and cute. They were neither big nor small and looked like they were just the right size to hold in each hand.He thought about what she had said about them being in the shape of peaches\u2026It seemed like they really were as she had described.A little curious, he wanted to touch them in the flesh and see if they really were as soft as she had claimed.His spot below his abdomen turned stiff and he suddenly felt that his body had actually become aroused again.He stood up calmly, tightened his face, and turned his head away, wondering what exactly was happening to him.Realizing that his expression had darkened once again, Lin Che thought that his illness was flaring up again.She looked at him with a slight worry and asked anxiously, \u201cWhy? Gu Jingze, is there something wrong? Do you need me to call the doctor? If I\u2019d known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have asked you to touch me.\u201dThis stupid woman.She thought that he was continuously evading her because of his illness?However, his allergic reaction was secondary right now. His primary illness was something else.It was something a little unexpected and it made him very irritable at the moment.He felt that he really needed to properly question Chen Yucheng now and whether his original illness had mutated so that there were other complications. Otherwise, why would he be feeling this way?Not in the mood to bother with this stupid woman, he turned his head and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m fine already. Go to sleep.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThen, can you still share a bed with me tonight? Or do you want to go out and sleep?\u201dWhen he looked at the bed, he felt a little reluctant to leave. It was only after some hesitation that he said, \u201cIt\u2019s already so late. Where else can I go to sleep? I\u2019ll just put up with it for a few hours.\u201dLin Che replied with a.\u201doh\u201d and made some space for him.It did not matter to her anyway. As long as he did not feel uncomfortable sharing the same bed as her, it was fine.Now, she had to consider the feelings of the patient.Even though it seemed that she was the one who had come to the hospital.Lin Che lay down and placed the pillow in the middle again. As Gu Jingze looked at it, he wondered to himself whether the pillow actually served a purpose when it was there. However, he still did not reveal his thoughts.He realized that he actually felt a hint of slight anticipation.If she fell asleep and started moving around again, would she suddenly sprawl out on his body?Then, he would be able to feel for once what exactly her allegedly peach-shaped breasts felt like\u2026The two of them lay down on the bed together without switching off the light. She lay there playing with her cellphone. When it started ringing, she saw that someone had sent her a friend request on WeChat.When she opened it, she saw to her surprise that it was Gu Jingyu.She could not help but be slightly dumbstruck. Still, she hurriedly accepted the request.Once she accepted it, he immediately sent her a message and asked her, \u201cSo you haven\u2019t gone to sleep?\u201dLin Che quickly asked, \u201cBig Celebrity Gu, why did you add me?\u201dLin Che thought,Perhaps it was to talk about the scandal.So she asked hurriedly.\u201dIs this about the scandal? Are you guys going to settle it?\u201dShe remembered that Gu Jingyu very seldom had these kinds of rumors. Some people said that Gu Jingyu was himself very averse to scandals, so once there were seeds of a rumor, he would begin to suppress them.Gu Jingyu immediately replied, \u201cWhy do I have to deal with the rumors?\u201dLin Che was a little flustered. \u201cOf course you do. Did you not see how overboard they went in fabricating a story?\u201d\u201cI saw it.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you deal with it?\u201d\u201cDealing with it is useless. Just ignore it. It\u2019ll be fine after a few days.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d This was slightly different from Gu Jingyu\u2019s usual way of doing things.\u201cBut they\u2019re very ridiculous and they exaggerated it so much. It\u2019s not too good to let all these rumors go around,\u201d Lin Che said quickly.But Gu Jingyu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t even care. Why do you care?\u201dFrustrated, Lin Che really wanted to scold someone.Of course he did not care because he was not the person being scolded.But she, on the other hand, had been scolded brutally. It shocked her to the extent that she did not dare open her Weibo page. The moment she opened it, there was a tidal wave of curses, each harsher than the one preceding it.\u201cNo way. Big Celebrity Gu Jingyu, you must save me. If you don\u2019t step out and settle it, this situation will definitely continue to worsen,\u201d Lin Che quickly said.Still, Gu Jingyu continued to reply monotonously. \u201cHow will it worsen? I think it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d\u201cNonsense. I\u2019ve been scolded so harshly.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll stop after scolding for a few days.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Gradually, Lin Che had unknowingly become extremely casual when speaking to him.\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t I post on Weibo tomorrow and say don\u2019t curse at her anymore. If there\u2019s anything you would like to say, direct it at me instead.\u201dWhen Lin Che saw his response, she nearly fainted.\u201cThen they\u2019ll curse at me even more harshly.\u201d\u201cThen what do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cJust say that we\u2019re merely friends from the same cast and that we\u2019ve known each other for a few days. Say that they\u2019re just fabricating a story from the pictures and that everything they\u2019ve said is a lie.\u201d This was the truth anyway.Unexpectedly, Gu Jingyu said instead, \u201cBut what if we really get together in the future and these reports come out? Wouldn\u2019t we be slapping our own faces?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHello, who would really want to be together with you?\u201cOf course we won\u2019t be together. Don\u2019t worry. You definitely won\u2019t be slapping yourself on the face,\u201d Lin Che said quickly.Gu Jingyu immediately sent her a crying emoticon. \u201cIt hurts me when you do this.\u201d\u201cIf it hurts you, it hurts you. In any case, you must settle this properly for me!\u201d\u201cSeriously, how do you know if you\u2019ll regret being this heartless to me today in the future? Who knows whether or not you\u2019ll suddenly fall for me in the future and desperately want to marry me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGet lost. That\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cWhy is it impossible? Anything is possible.\u201dLin Che looked at his response wordlessly. She knew that he was doing this intentionally to tease her. He would not handle the matter properly.So she straightforwardly sent him this: \u201cGo and die. Don\u2019t disturb my sleep.\u201d Thereafter, she just ignored him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She did not know how she could even step out of the house tomorrow.She took one last look at her Weibo. To her surprise, her fan count had swelled by tens of thousands in a short time.However, she did not need to think to know that these were probably all haters. Lin Che could only sigh and put her phone down.Gu Jingze frowned from the side. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sleep, don\u2019t play with your phone anymore.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cI just took a glance. I\u2019ll sleep soon.\u201dShe lay on her side, facing Gu Jingze. His eyes were already shut. Even lying down, Gu Jingze\u2019s body was completely straight. Every time Lin Che looked at him, she always felt as if he would not move at all in the night.Lin Che looked at his face which was fully illuminated under the weak shining light. Only half of his body was covered by the blanket, so his strongly-built body was perfectly divided into two sides, one bright and one dark. The bright side was gleaming with a bronze-colored sensuality and firmness, but the dark side elicited even more wild thoughts than the bright side. It seemed to be bathed in a layer of dim, rosy light. Its extravagance gave rise to a splendid temptation.When he closed his eyes, his eyelashes appeared even longer in a way that evoked more tender affections. His perfectly shaped lips were slightly perked up and his jawline flawlessly outlined his handsome face in its entirety, holding it out tautly. Below that gorgeous face, the Adam\u2019s Apple on his throat moved slightly. Further below, his collarbones were in a position where they could be seen clearly. Even as he lay like this, their shape could be clearly discerned.Even further below\u2026Lin Che turned her head away quickly. This was seriously fatal.She felt like she had become somewhat entranced by his beauty.Looking at him like this, he was really fatally sensual.Furthermore, she suddenly remembered that this was her husband.Although they were only married in name, he was indeed her husband at the very least. The law recognized this.However, it was a pity that he had another woman in his heart.She sighed before flipping her body around and lying down properly. With her nerves jangled, she did not really sleep well. She was half asleep the entire night but at the very least, she did not move again.Even Gu Jingze was amazed.He had initially believed that she would end up tossing and turning, attacking every single spot of his body, but after waiting for quite some time, she did not move an inch to his surprise.He had remained awake for quite some time because he had been prepared to be harassed by her, but she did not actually do it.Gu Jingze had no idea how he fell asleep, but he realized that he actually felt a slight sense of disappointment when he finally fell asleep.The next day, the two of them returned home in a car. Gu Jingze said, \u201cMy family initially wanted to invite you home for a meal.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Lin Che looked at him in surprise.With an unhurried expression, Gu Jingze said, \u201cBut I\u2019ve already rejected them.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d She had been scared out of her wits.\u201dYes, if I go back now, I\u2019ll definitely be asked about the scandal. I wouldn\u2019t know what to say either, so it\u2019s better not to go back.\u201dGu Jingze tilted his head and looked at her, his expression as dark as ink.He took a glance at her before he pursed his lips and turned back.After getting out of the car, Gu Jingze headed inside in large strides.Lin Che could only get into her wheelchair on her own.When the maid came to push her, Lin Che raised her head and said, \u201cYour Sir is so troublesome.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The maid smiled dryly, not knowing what she should say.After Lin Che finished tidying up, she rushed to the company.When she saw Yu Minmin, she said frantically.\u201dHow are things, Sister Yu? Have they been settled?\u201dThe moment Yu Minmin saw Lin Che, she walked over and said, \u201cYes you don\u2019t need to be so anxious anymore. I saw that the news is being clamped down. For the time being, news of you and Gu Jingyu are prohibited from being published again. Yesterday\u2019s reports were all taken down too.\u201dLin Che said in surprise, \u201cNo way.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cIt looks like Gu Jingyu\u2019s side took action. Anyway, our company doesn\u2019t have that much power nor does it have such powerful connections. It couldn\u2019t have locked down the news, so it was likely Gu Jingyu\u2019s side that did it.\u201dLin Che said in a confused tone, \u201cBut yesterday, Gu Jingyu even said not to deal with it.\u201dImmediately, Yu Minmin looked at Lin Che in astonishment. \u201cWhen did he say that?\u201dLin Che replied.\u201dYesterday night, on WeChat.\u201d\u201cAiya, you and Gu Jingyu even contact each other privately,\u201d Yu Minmin said, looking at Lin Che with slight interest.Lin Che rushed to say, \u201cOf course not. He just added my WeChat. It was probably about handling the scandal.\u201dYu Minmin looked at her as if she was carefully concealing something. She smiled and said, \u201cYou really underestimate Gu Jingyu. He doesn\u2019t have to deal with these things personally. He can just hand it over to his staff.\u201d\u201cUh, is that so?\u201d Of course, Lin Che was not like Yu Minmin who had a thorough understanding of these major celebrities in the entertainment industry.Yu Minmin said, \u201cGu Jingyu is originally very difficult to get along with. Many people think that he is difficult to approach. Furthermore, he absolutely will not have any contact with rookies.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 why is it so different from the Gu Jingyu that I know?\u201d Lin Che said, \u201cI think he\u2019s quite nice and he has a very amusing way of speaking. He\u2019s just a little sarcastic.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Minmin said, \u201cIs that so? Then\u2026 enjoy it yourself.\u201dWhen she was done speaking, she patted Lin Che\u2019s arm heavily.Lin Che shrugged her shoulders wordlessly. She thought to herself that it was probably because they had not been closely acquainted with him that they had misunderstandings about him.After all, Yu Minmin had definitely never been in contact with Gu Jingyu before. She had only asked around and heard about him. The more these rumors spread around, the more exaggerated they always became.In any case, Lin Che felt that this was probably the doing of Gu Jingyu\u2019s team.After all, his team would sooner or later be unable to put up with it.So after thinking for a bit, Lin Che sent him a WeChat message and said, \u201cI see you\u2019ve dealt with it. I\u2019m very sorry about this scandal and thank you for being willing to settle it.\u201dSurprisingly, this fellow Gu Jingyu seemed to be available all the time. His reply had already come up. Lin Che saw that he had replied, \u201cWhat did I settle?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWasn\u2019t it your team that settled the scandal?\u201d\u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t. Oh no, what a pity. I still wanted to see it for a couple more days. Now, it\u2019s gone?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che really wanted to vomit blood.\u201cGo and die. Thank God it has been retracted.\u201d\u201cSo heartless.\u201dWhen she was done texting Gu Jingyu, Lin Che snorted and put down her phone.But she thought that it was odd.What exactly was going on?On the other hand, on Gu Jingze\u2019s side\u2026Qin Hao lowered his head and said to Gu Jingze who was sitting in his executive chair, \u201cSir, we\u2019ve settled the matter already. The reports have all been deleted. Also, in the short term, there won\u2019t be any more reports released regarding Third Young Master.\u201dGu Jingze responded tersely in agreement.Qin Hao said, \u201cIn that case, do we need to give a notice to Third Young Master?\u201dTo date, Third Young Master still did not know Lin Che\u2019s identity, which was why such a blunder had occurred.Gu Jingze pondered for a while. \u201cForget it. If he knows, it\u2019s uncertain whether he\u2019ll stir up trouble. Perhaps things will be more peaceful if he doesn\u2019t know.\u201dGu Jingyu was the most rebellious of the three brothers, and it was common for him to do whatever made others unhappy.Qin Hao said, \u201cThen if there\u2019s anything else, Sir, I\u2019ll await your instructions again.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cBlock out news on Gu Jingyu for two months so that he\u2019ll be more well-behaved.\u201dBut even with this, Gu Jingze still felt uncomfortable letting him off without some punishment.Hearing this, Qin Hao could only say, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was only when Qin Hao left that Gu Jingze lowered his head to look at the article.Shown in the article was a picture of Gu Jingyu and Lin Che in the same frame talking and laughing together. It was really repulsive to the eye.Looking at it agitated him.He simply tossed the article behind him. Frowning, he thought,What bad judgment do these people have.

However, the after-effects remained. Lin Che\u2019s Weibo page was still being flooded with visitors. Contrary to expectations, her fan count had been steadily increasing so at least she had not been scolded for nothing. She also had some fame as an actress for the first time, which counted as her having some presence for the first time.Right at this moment, Lin Che\u2019s stepmother suddenly gave her a call and said to her, \u201cYour elder sister\u2019s engagement party with Qin Qing is this weekend. You can set aside some time to come, right?\u201dLin Che\u2019s heart stopped.Were they going to be formally engaged?Lin Che\u2019s hand, which held her phone, trembled slightly. Still, she forced herself to put up a pretense of calmness. She said to Han Caiying through the phone, \u201cWhy do I need to go? Stepmother, are you inviting me right now?\u201dOf course, she did not want to go. She did not want to return home to see the distasteful faces of her family members, nor did she want to\u2026 see Qin Qing ultimately marrying someone else.Han Caiying snorted and said, \u201cWhy? You dare not to come? Could it be that you still harbor some feelings for Qin Qing? If that\u2019s the case, all the more you should come. Come and take a look so that it\u2019s easier for you to give up completely.\u201d\u201cStepmother, I can\u2019t do anything about it either if you insist on putting it that way.\u201d\u201cAiyo, is it just my words or is it actually what you\u2019re thinking inside? I see that you\u2019ve really been working hard these few days to compete with Lin Li. You even went to cotton up to Gu Jingyu so that you could be in the headlines. What a pity that Gu Jingyu could not be bothered with you at all. It took him barely two days to push down the news. Lin Li\u2019s wedding this time will definitely be in the headlines. It\u2019ll easily give you some opportunity to show your face. Won\u2019t you come and freeload for the front page?\u201dAs Lin Che listened to Han Caiying\u2019s words, she thought to herself that she had a really rich imagination.Although she did not know if it was Gu Jingyu who had pushed down the news, she could confirm that Gu Jingyu was definitely not as Han Caiying had described.Finally, Han Caiying said, \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s up to you whether or not you want to come. If you really feel that you don\u2019t want to see Qin Qing marry Lin Li, then don\u2019t come.\u201dLin Che listened as she hung up the phone. She sat there and unknowingly fell into a trance for a long time.She sat there until Gu Jingze came in and saw Lin Che staring blankly ahead. He walked over to her and said, \u201cWhat happened? Are you hurt anywhere?\u201dLin Che looked at Gu Jingze. \u201cTo be honest, I kind of sympathize with Miss Mo.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s gaze was turbulent as he looked at Lin Che. He did not know why she had suddenly brought up Mo Huiling.\u201cWhat happened to her? \u201dLin Che sat there hugging a pillow. \u201cShe will definitely be very sad to see me together with you. Watching someone she loves getting together with someone else, but not being able to do anything while still having to pretend to be magnanimous and indifferent is very heartbreaking. In actuality, maybe it saddens and haunts her at night, so much so that she cries alone under the blankets. But still, you\u2019re by another woman\u2019s side.\u201dAs Lin Che said this, she lowered her eyes to hide them. Her long lashes were like half-open sandalwood fans that gently covered her clear eyes. Her porcelain-white face was overcast with bitterness and her distress was like a murmuring stream that gently flooded that pair of usually clear and bright eyes.She smiled but although her brow curved, it made one feel tender and protective towards her.She seemed to be talking about Mo Huiling, but she herself began to get weighed down with sorrow.As Gu Jingze looked at her eyes, he felt slightly bitter for some reason. He kept feeling like she was not talking about Mo Huiling but about herself.Gu Jingze could not help but frown and say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be concerned about matters between me and Huiling.\u201dLin Che snorted and looked at Gu Jingze. \u201cIndeed, all men are bad, hmph.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201dGu Jingze glared at her before standing up and walking out.She really was a heartless woman.However, his brow still wrinkled up. He knew that something was off with her and he wanted to know what exactly had happened to her.In the study room, he looked at Qin Hao. \u201cHow\u2019s your search coming along?\u201dQin Hao said, \u201cSir, although I don\u2019t know if this is what you\u2019re looking for, it seems that the Lin family\u2019s eldest daughter Lin Li and the Qin family\u2019s Young Master Qin Qing are getting engaged this weekend.\u201dQin Qing?Was it the man who she had always liked?Gu Jingze\u2019s brow furrowed deeply. The gloomy expression on his face was intensely secretive.Sure enough, she was not talking about Mo Huiling and him earlier, but about that man\u2026Could it be that she was still upset over that man?Gu Jingze did not know why he felt even more uncomfortable.Every day, she was on the bed and always slept earlier than him.Yet she still had the nerve to say that she tossed and turned at night while crying under the blanket?He did not know why he started to feel more and more agitated. He gestured at Qin Hao to leave.Qin Hao said, \u201cSir, then\u2026 \u201d\u201cGet out.\u201dShocked, Qin Hao floundered and left frantically.Although Lin Che did not want to go, her anger did not dissipate from thinking about it. It became more pronounced when she thought about how Han Caiying had intentionally provoked her. While she understood that she had done so on purpose, Lin Che still could not help but fall for it.Thus, Lin Che decided to attend the ceremony to have a look.She attempted to borrow a formal dress through the company and when Yu Minmin heard that she needed it to go to Lin Li\u2019s wedding, she immediately and generously offered to help get her a good piece.Because Lin Li was, after all, a celebrity, her wedding with Qin Qing was a hot topic for a sizable number of people. It was likely that quite a few media outlets would be there on that day. They could take advantage of the situation and seize the opportunity for exposure. Of course, Yu Minmin was very happy.On the day of the engagement, the skies were boundlessly clear.However, Lin Che\u2019s mood was instead so downcrest that it seemed to have hit rock bottom.She went to the engagement venue in a car and when she alighted, she saw a few large words dazzling brightly at the resplendent and luxurious entrance of the hotel. The words were: May Lin Li and Qin Qing live a long and happy life together.A long and happy life together\u2026Swallowing her bitterness, she told herself not to look at him again and not to think about him again. After today, he was no longer going to be the youth she dreamed of in her younger years, but someone else\u2019s fianc\u00e9.After getting out of the car, she sat on her wheelchair. Even though walking did not hurt so much now, she did not want to hobble around either since she had come to attend the engagement. In comparison, it was better to sit on a wheelchair like this.She wheeled herself into the hotel in a blue formal dress, but before she even entered, her silhouette was discovered by a reporter at the hotel entrance.\u201cLook! That\u2019s Lin Che, right?\u201dLin Che was still zoning out when she saw several cameras starting to direct themselves at her. The reporters swarmed towards her, but were blocked by hotel security. However, they still asked Lin Che excitedly, \u201cDid you come to attend your elder sister\u2019s engagement? You and Lin Li are biological sisters, right?\u201dLin Che could only smile good-naturedly.The reporters vigorously took photos of her smiling face before continuing to ask again, \u201cThis time, you have scenes with Lin Li in the new television series. How does it feel for you two sisters to act together?\u201d\u201cDid Lin Li invite anyone from the production team here?\u201d\u201cDid Gu Jingyu receive an invitation. Will he come as well?\u201d\u201cLin Che, do you contact Gu Jingyu in private?\u201dIt was Lin Che\u2019s first time being surrounded like this. She did not think that because of the scandal this time, she would actually be recognized by the reporters in an instant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHan Caiying was inside but with one look, she saw Lin Che outside presently being blocked by reporters so that she could not come in.Looking at the fervent excitement, Han Caiying\u2019s countenance darkened immediately.What was this Lin Che anyway? How could she even have reporters going up to surround her and make her look so majestic?Did she come to purposely steal the show?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She did not expect to meet reporters here.She wore a blue formal dress that was slightly off-shoulder in a sling style. Natural yet generous, it made her look very fresh and elegant. Her hair was tied up high and it revealed her neck with beautiful slender lines.Han Caiying fumed with anger. She was certain that Lin Che was doing this on purpose.She still dared to say that she had no interest in Qin Qing?At last, security withheld the reporters and Lin Che was able to finally go in.She saw Han Caiying wearing a festive dress immediately. It was as if she just had to wear every valuable thing she possessed in order to show off her wealth.Glaring at Lin Che, she remarked, \u201cHey. You said it was inconvenient for you to walk. Didn\u2019t I tell you that you didn\u2019t have to come?\u201dLin Che snorted, \u201cOh did you? But how can I not come to my sister\u2019s engagement?\u201dHan Caiying replied, \u201cLook at you, you pitiful thing. The moment you arrived, you immediately snatched the attention of the reporters. Of course, with you in a wheelchair, it\u2019s not hard to notice.\u201dWas Han Caiying implying that Lin Che deliberately sat in a wheelchair to attract attention?Lin Che was too lazy to explain. She laughed as she sat in her wheelchair, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect reporters to be here, Stepmother. You guys made the ceremony to be such a huge thing that it attracted the reporters. Thanks to Sister\u2019s engagement, I have the opportunity to get my own headline. Isn\u2019t that what you said? That I would have my own headline?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Han Caiying had indeed told Lin Che that, but it was sarcasm. Little did she know that the reporters not only knew Lin Che, but they had a keen interest in her.Naturally, Han Caiying had underestimated Gu Jingyu\u2019s influential power. Any gossip about him certainly lasted long.\u201cVery well, you\u2019re right. Since your sister is so famous, it\u2019s only right of her to look after you,\u201d she could only say this while glaring at Lin Che, thinking that no matter what, the star of today was Lin Li.After a while, she arranged for Lin Che to be in a corner where no one would notice her or allow her to grab the spotlight.At that moment, Qin Qing walked out from a distance.In an all-white ensemble, Qin Qing looked extremely neat today.He was today\u2019s male lead, so naturally, he was like Prince Charming. As soon as he appeared, everyone\u2019s eyes were drawn to him.Being a scion of the Qin family, he grew up with a golden spoon in his mouth. He was destined to be a winner in life ever since he was born. Today, he was getting engaged with the beautiful, sexy, and famous Lin Li. It invoked envy among many.Lin Che saw Qin Qing from afar and thought about how good he really looked.She couldn\u2019t stop looking at him and felt him glance over too. She quickly recovered with a bitter heart.One last glance, one last glance\u2026It was a pity that he had to be with Lin Li. If it was someone else, giving her blessings would have been much easier, but she was reluctant because it was Lin Li. How could she give her heartfelt congratulations?When Qin Qing saw Lin Che, his eyes lit up and he felt slightly embarrassed.She was in a wheelchair but she still looked so dazzling.She seemed to look even lovelier than the last time he saw her, even though it was not long ago. It was as if she was a butterfly still metamorphosing in her chrysalis, becoming more beautiful by the day. One day, she was finally going to break out of her shell.Then, he heard someone say from the side, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Lin Che?\u201d\u201cLin Che? Who is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the rumored girlfriend of Gu Jingyu.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s her. Was she not just being sensational?\u201d\u201cYes, the news has died down, but she looks way better in real life than on TV.\u201dQin Qing squinted his eyes to look and thought that she indeed looked better in real life.However, his heart still felt uneasy when he thought about the rumors between her and Gu Jingyu. He thought that those rumors should have disappeared quickly and never expected it to still be making waves.At that moment, the engagement banquet was about to start soon. Qin Qing was about to find Lin Che when Lin Li approached from a distance.Lin Li wore a white gown that made her look like a pure angel. Qin Qing smiled and went to her.The engagement banquet was starting soon.The gorgeous engagement banquet was a display of the power of the Qin family and the Lin family.The joining of the two families was definitely not a small matter. With so many reporters around, they had no space for flaws.Lin Che who was made to sit at a corner looked ahead at Qin Qing and Lin Li. The couple was standing in the front and were accepting well wishes from the guests.Qin Qing looked at Lin Li adoringly and could not help but feel moved. Holding Lin Li\u2019s hand, he said, \u201cI will treat you well forever.\u201dLin Li was moved to tears. The warm and endearing engagement was like a perfect fairy tale.Meanwhile, Lin Che was merely an inconspicuous supporting role in this story.Although she sat there with a bitter heart, she had already accepted it.During the engagement, Qin Qing only had eyes for Lin Li. When all was over and Lin Li went for an interview, Qin Qing suddenly remembered that he had not met Lin Che.After searching the area, he finally found her in a corner. Qin Qing walked towards Lin Che and smiled at her. He looked at her dress and thought that she was becoming more and more feminine.\u201cLin Che, why are you hiding so far away?\u201d he asked.Lin Che looked at Qin Qing and laughed, silently thinking that she had not chosen this spot. Her stepmother was the one who had made her sit there. Then again, even in the Lin family, she was insignificant. It was no surprise that her stepmother would put her there.Qin Qing looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cI wanted to ask what was going on about that rumor between you and Gu Jingyu?\u201dLin Che replied quietly, \u201cWhy would you pay attention to that too?\u201dQin Qing said with a smile, \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t want to, I was getting bombarded by the news every day.\u201dLin Che laughed embarrassingly. \u201cThose are merely rumors.\u201dQin Qing replied, \u201cI do hope so. However, you better stay far away from that man. I have told you that he is not that simple.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cI barely know him. He\u2019s just a friend and it\u2019s nothing like what was said in the article.\u201dQin Qing listened and nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. I\u2019m just afraid that it would not be good if a silly girl like you got cheated.\u201dLin Che could only smile bitterly.Yes, she was silly.Just then, Lin Youcai seemed to see Lin Che and Qin Qing chatting happily together from afar.His brows furrowed.This Lin Che is becoming more brazen these days. What would people think if they see her talking with her brother-in-law in such a manner?Lin Youcai unabashedly walked over to them. Smiling at Qin Qing, he said politely, \u201cLet me have a word with Lin Che.\u201dIt was a God-given right for a father to speak with his daughter, so naturally, Qin Qing immediately stood up. \u201cOh sure, Uncle. You two enjoy your chat.\u201dOnce Qin Qing left, Lin Youcai\u2019s face darkened, \u201cLin Che, what is going on with you? How did you end up having rumors with Gu Jingyu?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingyu again.Lin Che laughed coldly and replied to her father, \u201cThey were just rumors. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dLin Youcai\u2019s face was immediately stiffened by her attitude, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You tell me what\u2019s wrong. I gave you the chance to marry, but you turned it down and offended the Cheng family, leaving us to clean up your mess. Do you know how much the Cheng family has?\u201cYou ran away and provoked people. I know you want to be famous, but Gu Jingyu is not someone to be trifled with. Seriously. Just for fame, you\u2019re willing to do anything. One day, you will pay for it and only then will you regret it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I had no part to play in this rumor.\u201d\u201cIf you are really honest, you can still make up for it by going to the Chengs\u2019 and apologizing to them now. They still have not found someone for the marriage.\u201d Han Caiying would rather die than let Lin Li marry and Lin Youcai could only look at the Chengs give their fortune away to someone else. The thought of it made his heart anxious.Lin Che was in disbelief. She looked at her father mockingly and was unable to fathom how he could still be thinking of that matter now.\u201cFather, don\u2019t think about this anymore. Don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t want to. Actually, I already have a boyfriend so I will not marry anyone else.\u201d Lin Che did not mention that she was already married. She only revealed that she had a boyfriend.Lin Youcai was shocked. He looked at Lin Che suspiciously, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dLin Che laughed, \u201cWhy would I lie about something like that?\u201d\u201cGu Jingyu?\u201d\u201cOf course not. That is only a rumor.\u201dLin Youcai\u2019s eyes turned with disappointment. It was impossible. With her, how could she captivate the eyes of someone like Gu Jingyu?Lin Youcai snorted, \u201cYou better not bring home a poor gigolo from your circle. I will tell you now. I will never agree to it. You better not get cheated too. I don\u2019t see how the Chengs are bad. If you enter their family, you become a Lady everywhere you go and live a blissful life with endless money to spend. You\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you want their money so much, why don\u2019t you send Stepmother to marry then? I am your daughter, but you want to sell me. You\u2026\u201dLin Che was devastated. She never understood why she was ever born into this family.Lin Youcai\u2019s face sank. Han Caiying had just overheard Lin Che\u2019s last words.\u201cLin Che, what kind of attitude is this? I let you into my home to attend the engagement and treat you like family. How dare you say such things to me and your father?\u201dLin Che sneered, \u201cOnly you know best why you let me return. Anyway, I already have a man. I don\u2019t believe the Chengs will still be willing. You both better dismiss this idea of yours.\u201dHan Caiying\u2019s face turned red, \u201cYou shameless girl! I just knew it. You were out there fooling around and you dare say you already have a man? You\u2019re still proudly showing off how loose you are? You\u2026\u201dLin Che already knew that no matter what she did, she was always wrong in their eyes.If she just came back like that, they would say she had no respect for this house.If she tidied herself up before coming back, they would say that she was showing off.Lin Che turned and walked away immediately.However, a quiet voice suddenly sounded, \u201cAre you forcing Lin Che to marry someone else?\u201dThis voice\u2026It was deep, hoarse, but had an air of compassion.Lin Che turned her head to see Gu Jingze behind, dressed in a black suit as he walked over.Gu Jingze\u2019s tall stature brought about a king-like aura. His eyes were unwavering and it seemed like nobody could look deeper in.While still in her wheelchair, Lin Che felt his hand pushing behind without much resistance.Lin Che did not expect him to be here.Nobody expected him to be here.Lin Che did not even tell him that she would be coming here.After all, they were only married because of a contract. She did not want to bother him with her personal matters.Looking up, her eyes met his deep, dark eyes that seemed to be staring into hers. He then raised his eyes and looked at Lin Youcai and Han Caiying with obvious contempt.Han Caiying glared at Gu Jingze and asked rudely, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201dGu Jingze nonchalantly glanced over Han Caiying. His voice was cold and although he restrained it, his voice was still undeniably sharp, \u201cIs this your stepmother?\u201d He completely ignored Han Caiying and lowered his head to ask Lin Che.Lin Che looked at Han Caiying and said, \u201cHm.\u201dHan Caiying indignantly pointed her finger at Gu Jingze, \u201cHa! You must be Lin Che\u2019s gigolo, aren\u2019t you?Who allowed you to be here?\u201dGu Jingze held onto the wheelchair and looked at Han Caiying. Without batting an eyelid, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s an engagement. Of course, the family must attend. Since you invited Lin Che, I have to come along, am I not right?\u201dLin Che figured Han Caiying must not have realized who Gu Jingze is.Lin Che would never have imagined that such a perfect person existed. First, he was the cream of the crop. He would never have been within her reach and neither would she have tried. Second, although reporters try to take pictures of him secretly, they were not successful. He was always surrounded by too many people protecting him and never giving them a chance to leak out photos.Such an elusive person. People could only hear of him but they never saw him.Han Caiying took one good look at Gu Jingze. He was indeed not bad looking. Maybe he was also a celebrity?Han Caiying snorted and said, \u201cWho do you think you are to claim to be family? If you want to marry and take away our Lin Che, you should at least get our approval which we have not given you. We will definitely not.\u201dGu Jingze replied bluntly, his voice lacking warmth, \u201cI do not need approval from anybody for who I want to marry.\u201d\u201cHa, you\u2019re too arrogant. She is part of the Lin family and she is our daughter, not some cheap thing you can take away any time. Tell me first. What is it that you do? How much do you earn in a month? Do you have a house?\u201cAre you local? Do you have a car?\u201cHow much dowry have you prepared for us? Let me tell you that our minimum dowry is one million yuan. If you can\u2019t meet that, don\u2019t think about marrying her. For all these years she\u2019s been eating here, living here, and using the privileged title of Miss Lin\u2026 So much extravagance. It will certainly not be for free.\u201dGu Jingze repeated, \u201cOne million yuan?\u201dHan Caiying asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Can\u2019t afford it? If you can\u2019t afford it, then get lost.\u201dAt this moment, Lin Youcai was tugging onto Han Caiying from behind. Looking at Gu Jingze with excitement in his eyes as if he wanted to appease the man, he said, \u201cAre you really our Lin Che\u2019s boyfriend?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze looked at Lin Che who was biting her lip and looking at him sheepishly.Her eyes shone like lakes reflecting the starlight, softly moving.Gu Jingze replied, \u201cYes.\u201dLin Youcai laughed, \u201cThis Lin Che didn\u2019t tell us she had a boyfriend all along.

She looked up at Lin Youcai who had suddenly seemed to change.What was he trying to do? Why did his attitude completely turn?Gu Jingze continued looking at Lin Youcai condescendingly, \u201cWe only just got together, so I\u2019m not in a hurry to visit her home with her.\u201d\u201cOh, but we welcome you anytime! The sooner the better,\u201d Lin Youcai laughed loudly. \u201cLin Che has always been the cause of our worries. She is still young and immature. In the future, she will understand that all we have done is for her own good. Now, she is under your care.\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head and held her hand delicately.Lin Che lifted her head to follow his gaze.Gu Jingze said plainly, \u201cLin Che is the purest, loveliest and most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever met. Being with her makes me very happy. Taking care of her is my duty.\u201dLin Che\u2019s heart skipped a little.Looking up at Gu Jingze, she had never thought that he would help her this way.She was extremely touched. No one had ever treated her so nicely.Lin Youcai\u2019s eyes flashed at Gu Jingze, gradually becoming humbled.Han Caiying was not happy to see her husband humbling himself to a gigolo like that. It was unimaginable.Gu Jingze began to push Lin Che, \u201cLin Che\u2019s leg was injured because of the car accident. It has not healed yet and she needs plenty of rest. If there\u2019s nothing else, I will bring her back to rest.\u201dLin Youcai immediately replied, \u201cOf course, of course. Please go ahead. Right this way.\u201dGu Jingze glanced scornfully at Han Caiying one last time. As he was pushing Lin Che away, Han Caiying gritted her teeth.What kind of attitude was that? How dare he behave so proudly in front of her?From afar, Qin Qing watched as Lin Che left with a handsome but cold-looking man. His heart shook a little.Who was that guy?Qin Qing looked on as that man pushed Lin Che, appearing very considerate.With curiosity on his face, Qin Qing walked towards them while overhearing Han Caiying angrily lashing out at Lin Youcai, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Why were you all over that gigolo, grovelling at his feet?\u201dHan Caiying was such a disgrace.Lin Xiangtian glared at Han Caiying, \u201cThat was no ordinary man.\u201dHan Caiying retorted, \u201cYeah, he looks decent, but Qin Qing is also good-looking and even richer than him.\u201d \u201dLin Youcai snorted, \u201cSee, you didn\u2019t even notice that he had a ring on his finger. That ring is not something you see on just anybody.\u201d\u201cHa, it\u2019s just a ring. Why would a man be donning jewelry anyway?\u201d Han Caiying said indignantly.Lin Youcai replied, \u201cYou know nothing. I\u2019ve seen that ring on someone before. He was wearing it openly on television.\u201d\u201cWho? Which celebrity?\u201d Han Caiying thought.Since it appeared on television, it had to be a celebrity.Lin Youcai\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cThe President.\u201dHan Caiying\u2019s jaw dropped as she blurted out, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Are you crazy? You must have seen the wrong thing.\u201dJust then, Qin Qing walked over from behind. Hearing them mention the President\u2019s ring, he asked seriously, \u201cUncle, Auntie. What are you talking about? The President indeed wears a ring. Because he\u2019s a family man, he wears a ring as his family\u2019s symbol and he wears it everywhere he goes. Just now\u2026 Just now, that man.\u201dWas part of the Gu family?Until today, there was only one person in the Gu family whose photos have never been taken before and that was the elusive Gu Jingze.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that man pushing Lin Che was Gu Jingze?\u201dThat one sentence threw everybody into silence.\u201cI\u2019m ninety percent sure,\u201d Lin Youcai was even more certain now after hearing the same speculation from Qin Qing.Han Caiying was unconvinced, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You both are thinking too much. Just look at how slutty Lin Che is. How could she ever hook such a big fish? You think too highly of her.\u201dOf course, Han Caiying refused to believe it. It was impossible.A beauty like Lin Li being able to marry Qin Qing was already the envy of many.Why would a slut like Lin Che be able to meet such a rich and capable man?She would rather die than to believe that it was true.Qin Qing also felt confused, \u201cSo\u2026 how did they know each other?\u201dHan Caiying said directly, \u201cHmph. Even if that was him, he must only be toying with Lin Che. She has become daring now, hooking up with Gu Jingyu and now with another man. Is she so motivated after seeing Lin Li that she\u2019s willing to sacrifice herself for money? And you still want to encourage her, Youcai? When she decides to stop fooling around, she\u2019s not only going to offend others. She will implicate us as well.\u201dWith her shoulders squared, she looked as if she was going to explode like a firecracker.As Qin Qing listened to Han Caiying\u2019s words, he looked gravely at the direction in which the man and Lin Che left.People at the side were looking strangely at Lin Che and Gu Jingze.Curious discussions filled the air.\u201cWho is the man going with Lin Che?\u201d\u201cIndeed, I\u2019ve never heard of him, but he is so handsome.\u201d\u201cThose eyes are so enchanting, I think he\u2019s even more handsome than today\u2019s groom.\u201dLin Li heard the discussion, but only turned around when she heard how someone was more handsome than the groom.Lin Che was with that man?Lin Li\u2019s heart hardened.This Lin Che\u2026 she definitely came with an agenda today. She was here to steal the spotlight.Gu Jingze continued pushing Lin Che until they came to a spot where there were few people. Only then did Lin Che let out a sigh of relief. Looking up at Gu Jingze, she asked, \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cThere\u2019s a happy occasion in your family. As your husband, I have to come take a look, don\u2019t I?\u201dLooking behind, he could still see Qin Qing\u2019s silhouette.In his heart, he could not understand why Lin Che would like someone like that. He was only a pretty boy.Did Lin Che like this type of man?While thinking, Gu Jingze\u2019s face tensed up even more.Lin Che replied, \u201cIt is only my sister\u2019s engagement.\u201d\u201cAnd the engagement of the man you like.\u201d Gu Jingze said in contempt.Lin Che replied without hesitation, \u201cHey, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cQin Qing, wasn\u2019t that his name?\u201d Gu Jingze looked at her.Lin Che\u2019s face darkened slightly. She reluctantly admitted, \u201cThat was in the past!\u201d\u201cIn any case, as your husband, I should be with you at an event like this.\u201dLin Che said quietly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m your husband,\u201d Gu Jingze pushed her towards the banquet area.Lin Che reminded him, \u201cOnly on paper.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cFor every day we\u2019re not divorced, you are still the woman betrothed to me as my wife. Legally and morally. You are my wife, so I should be here.\u201dLin Che lifted her head up. With his words, she felt warmth slowly trickling into her heart and she felt so full.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No, I have to leave now. I was surrounded by them just now,\u201d Lin Che had little experience with reporters. She still did not know how to handle them. She did not know what to say and was afraid of saying the wrong things that might affect her career.Gu Jingze looked and said, \u201cWe can hide inside. Let\u2019s go.\u201dAs he said this, he glanced over at his men to go over and take a look.Under the discrete protection of his guards, the two of them went deeper in.Lin Che was relieved that no reporters followed them, \u201cLuckily, we lost them. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do otherwise.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her silently and thought that if the hotel not been under the Gu family\u2019s name and surrounded by his people, she could never have escaped. It was not that the reporters did not follow her. They were stopped.Soon, they found a room in the hotel to rest.Gu Jingze said, \u201cI\u2019ve asked for the staff to bring some food. You should have some.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, Gu Jingze. You\u2019re too good,\u201d she raised her head towards Gu Jingze, her face filled with gratitude.Gu Jingze knew that she was putting on an act, but he was secretly satisfied.\u201cSince you know how good I am, then treat me better,\u201d he replied and pushed a plate in front of her.Sitting in a wheelchair was inconvenient. When Gu Jingze pushed the plate in front of her, she looked at him with greater happiness.She did not hate this man all the time.Lin Che ate a few pieces of food while Gu Jingze\u2019s phone rang. He went over to pick it up.On the other end of the line, the security guard said, \u201cSir, Lin Youcai wanted to look for you just now. We stopped him.\u201dExpressionless, Gu Jingze glanced over to Lin Che, \u201cHm.\u201dWhen he put down the phone, he saw Lin Che fidgeting around and seemingly tugging at her clothes. Gu Jingze asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dLin Che struggled to untie the ribbon at the back. Defeated, she grumbled, \u201cI think my back is all tangled up.\u201dGu Jingze shook his head and went over to her, \u201cOkay, seeing as you are dumb and clumsy, let me give you a hand.\u201dLin Che gave in, \u201cAlright, you\u2019re the smart one.\u201dHe said, \u201cLook at how silly you are.\u201dHe took a closer look to find that the ribbon was stuck in the wheelchair. No wonder it was hard for her.He picked out the ribbon and said, \u201cNobody asked you to wear a dress so difficult to wear.\u201dLin Che felt his hands moving around, occasionally touching her back and making it hard to control herself.Pretending not to feel anything, she snorted, \u201cIt\u2019s an engagement. I can\u2019t not wear something formal. Also, I am your wife now. Surely, I have to give you face. See this dress? My company let me borrow it. It\u2019s branded.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face blackened, \u201cIf you have no clothes, I could have bought them for you. Why borrow from your company?\u201d\u201cThat would be troublesome.\u201d\u201cIs it troublesome? Or is it because you didn\u2019t want to tell me you were going to the engagement party of the guy you like?\u201d Gu Jingze said as his grip tightened. The more he thought about how determined she was to attend the party, the more uncomfortable he felt.Lin Che felt a pain in her back. She turned angrily to him and said, \u201cHey, if you don\u2019t want to help me, don\u2019t. You\u2019re hurting me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize,\u201d He too was confused by his own thoughts. He kept his head down and continued undoing the ribbon with more care.Lin Che said hesitantly, \u201cHey, why is your head down? Is your illness acting up again?\u201dShe remembered him telling her that if he got too close to women, he would develop several allergic reactions including vomiting and rashes.Gu Jingze said, \u201cHow could it be?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of touching you and getting sick.\u201d\u201cI would never embarrass myself in front of you,\u201d Gu Jingze continued, \u201cSpeaking of embarrassment, I have seen a lot of it on your side.\u201dLin Che glared at Gu Jingze, \u201cThe pleasure is all mine!\u201dShe had been drugged, disgraced, and made drunk by him.He really had seen everything.Lin Che thought that Mo Huiling was definitely nothing like that.No wonder he loved Mo Huiling and not her. Women should keep their distance from men. After all, women need to upkeep their image. Otherwise, which man would ever love them?Especially Gu Jingze. Given his status, he must have come across plenty of elegant ladies.Gu Jingze looked seriously at her zipper. It was so entangled that it was going to be hard to unzip.As he worked on the zipper intensely, he could not help but notice with his head bent down that he was facing her fair and tender neck. The fabric below moved around while light shone softly at the front.He remembered her telling him that her chest was shaped like two peaches.Looking at it, indeed it was.Although the blue fabric was covering most of it, the top half of her chest was still obviously showing and slightly moving.From that angle, he could see a large part of her bare back. Her skin was soft and smooth. It seemed to be poreless except for a layer of extremely fine hair on the surface like a baby\u2019s skin..His throat felt unexpectedly hot. He shifted his eyes away but could not help feeling bothered.However, he seemed to grow more anxious as his hands fumbled more.He was frustrated that he just could not detangle it.Forcefully, he shouted, \u201cSHIT! It won\u2019t budge!\u201dWith one forceful pull, the dress let out a rip sound.It was torn.Lin Che could not believe what just happened. She held her dress and silently lifted her head at Gu Jingze. She was annoyed and shouted. She felt the air-conditioner blowing at her bare skin. It made her uncomfortable, \u201cWhat have you done, Gu Jingze? How is this helping?\u201dGu Jingze was also vexed. His ears turned red as he did not know what to do.A large part of the dress fell off, revealing parts of her body. However, it made her look even more attractive. Her body seemed to shine through the light, showing her fine baby-like hair. Nobody could resist her.His heart jolted as if something manipulated it.She turned her head to him, eyes staring like daggers into Gu Jingze\u2019s, \u201cThe dress is ruined. Do you have any idea how much it cost?\u201dGu Jingze replied angrily, \u201cI will pay you back.\u201d\u201cHmph, you\u2019d better!\u201dGu Jingze glared at her and picked up his phone.\u201cGet me a ladies\u2019 formal gown, one with my wife\u2019s measurements,\u201d Gu Jingze said as he looked at Lin Che who was staring at him begrudgingly with her big eyes and holding onto her clothes. Her chest was already big, but with her hands held against it, it looked even bigger.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze\u2019s eyes seemed to be lost as he looked at her. She frowned and turned away.This idiot.Lin Che had no other choice but to wheel herself into the bathroom.She found a bathrobe and put it on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could not stop looking at her.Lin Che said, \u201cI had no choice but to wear this. Seriously, this is all your fault! Did you do it on purpose? To think that my dress could be ruined like that!\u201dGu Jingze could only stare at her in her bathrobe with the sash resting loosely around her waist.If he had not known this woman\u2019s intelligence, she would not have been capable of acting so naturally seductive. He felt that she was being deliberate.If she was only wearing a bathrobe, that would mean that underneath was only some lingerie\u2026Gu Jingze\u2019s body grew hot. Staring at her in her robes, he did not want to look away. He kept thinking about her skin and her loose outfit. Reaching in would be so easy.Gu Jingze shook his thoughts away as he heard the sound of the door outside.Lin Che said, \u201cThe clothes are here already? Go bring them in quickly.\u201dGu Jingze nodded and looked at Lin Che before going to open the door.The room was a suite with a bedroom inside and a living room outside.Gu Jingze closed the bedroom door and sighed heavily before walking towards the main door.However, to his surprise, it was a man with jet-black hair and pale face.Qin Qing.Qin Qing saw Gu Jingze and his eyes jumped to look inside the room. When he could not see Lin Che, he turned his eyes back to Gu Jingze. Lin Che\u2019s relationship with him was fishy. Hesitantly, he asked, \u201cIs\u2026 Lin Che here?\u201dAlthough the person in front of him made Qin Qing feel slightly jealous, he could not help but look down at the ring on his finger. At a closer look, his eyes lit up.That indeed looked like the Gu family\u2019s ring.Somehow, he just did not want to lower his guard in front of this man.Thus, the intensity in his eyes increased as he said, \u201cI am Lin Che\u2019s friend.\u201dGu Jingze stood there half a head taller than Qin Qing. His pair of dark eyes were unfathomable and endless like the night sky, deep and unobtrusive.His eyes swept over Qin Qing. Gu Jingze could not understand what made Lin Che so drawn to him. What kind of taste in men did she have? Did she really like this type of pretty boy? Somehow, one was Gu Jingyu and now the other one was Qin Qing. They were both just pretty boys.Gu Jingze\u2019s voice was cold and proud. Although he was being a gentleman, he had a high aura that was not to be messed with, \u201cLin Che is inside, but she\u2019s busy.\u201d\u201cBusy?\u201d Qin Qing asked suspiciously, \u201cTell her it\u2019s me. She will see me.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s slender fingers touched his nose, his eyes surrendering, \u201cShe\u2019s not exactly busy. She\u2019s just not wearing clothes right now so I can\u2019t open the door for you.\u201dQin Qing was shocked.Seeing Qin Qing\u2019s expression, he continued, \u201cIt was all my fault. I was careless\u2026 I ruined her dress and I\u2019ve asked my men to bring her some clothes. So for now, it\u2019s really not convenient for her to come out.\u201dEven though those words were concealed, Qin Qing understood.Revealing a hint of awkwardness, Qin Qing never thought that this man in front of him and Lin Che would have\u2026 that kind of relationship.Qin Qing replied, \u201cYou may not be aware, but Lin Che and I go way back. We\u2019ve known each other for many years.\u201d He could not help but feel hostile towards Gu Jingze.\u201cOh, Lin Che told me,\u201d Gu Jingze said softly. \u201cShe has mentioned it to me.\u201d\u201cI know you may be powerful and can do anything you want, but Lin Che is a simple girl. I don\u2019t want her to get hurt. So if you aren\u2019t serious about her, I will definitely not take this lying down.\u201dLike what Han Caiying said earlier, even if Gu Jingze had a relationship with her, he would simply toss her aside once he got sick of her.It made Qin Qing upset.In his heart, it was not that Gu Jingze was not an equal match to him or that Gu Jingze was playing with Lin Che. Instead, he wondered if Gu Jingze had cheated her into being with him?Gu Jingze never thought that he would one day be threatened by Qin Qing.Looking at Qin Qing, he said, \u201cIf you are warning me as a friend, I\u2019ll have you rest assured that my relationship with her is completely legitimate. We have mutual feelings and trust. There are no secrets between us and there is a commitment between us that will not be violated.\u201dWhat he said was true, but that was not all there was.Gu Jingze\u2019s expression changed to something more threatening. As he looked at Qin Qing, he said, \u201cHowever, if you are warning me as a man, I\u2019ll remind you that Lin Che is now my woman.\u201dHis sharp expression was like a sword that made Qin Qing feel a great threat at once.In Qin Qing\u2019s heart, his dislike for Gu Jingze grew even more. Then, a service staff arrived with two pieces of clothing, \u201cSir, your clothes are here.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression softened as he said to the staff, \u201cJust bring them in.\u201dThe logo on those clothes did not go unnoticed by Qin Qing.A high-end brand. Each piece of clothing cost at least tens of thousands.Gu Jingze looked distantly at Qin Qing, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going back in.\u201dWithout giving Qin Qing time to reply, he closed the door immediately.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201dQin Qing looked at the closed door in anger. He was not happy to get the cold shoulder after coming all the way here.He had an even more unreasonable distaste for Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze took the clothes in.Lin Che was still waiting inside. When she saw Gu Jingze finally return, she asked, \u201cWere you talking to someone at the door?\u201dThe hotel room was soundproof and she dared not step out. She could only hear a murmur of voices, but she didn\u2019t know what was going on.Gu Jingze nodded, \u201cYeah, there was a mad dog but I had it taken away.\u201dHe was not someone who would be mean to strangers. He did not know Qin Qing at all.However, he felt resentful upon thinking how curt and direct his words were.Lin Che laughed and said in amazement, \u201cA dog in a hotel? How did that ever happen?\u201d\u201cIt was a mad dog. Mad dogs like to run around poking their nose in everything.\u201dHe then handed the clothes to her, \u201cGo put them on. They are your size.\u201dLin Che looked down at the clothes. They were beautiful and looked very exquisite.\u201cWow, aren\u2019t these expensive?\u201d she said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dLin Che smiled at Gu Jingze, \u201cThese are beautiful. They look grand. Thanks, Gu Jingze. Who knew that being your wife could make me as grand as you too? Not bad.\u201dHe only thought how cute she was trying to look charming.For the first time, her simple compliments made Gu Jingze feel bashful and happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She said, \u201cI\u2019m not drooling.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her silently, \u201cCan\u2019t you be a little more ladylike?\u201dLin Che lifted her head, \u201cIn what way am I not ladylike?\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cSuch a money-grubber.\u201dLin Che snorted. It did not matter to her. She patted her dress greedily. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I can be pretentious in front of others but I don\u2019t have to put on a front with you. If I acted a little more proper, shy, pitiful, or classy, would that make you fall in love with me?\u201d she said as she looked at Gu Jingze with indignance.Gu Jingze glared at her quietly.Perhaps it was because there was no need to pretend, so there was no cause for hatred.Lin Che walked into the bathroom, eager to put the dress on. She came out donning a loose, yellow dress. Fresh and refined, she looked so bright like sunlight.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes lit up as he saw how different she looked.Lin Che twirled slowly, making her skirt bloom like a flower. She looked like the sun.Lin Che asked, \u201cHow do I look?\u201dGu Jingze hesitated slightly, \u201cYou look decent.\u201dUpon hearing that, Lin Che said, \u201cExpensive clothes are really different.\u201dShe happily sat back in her wheelchair.Gu Jingze thought to himself, how ignorant. He was complimenting her but she did not realize it?She was such an endearing fool.Soon, Gu Jingze wheeled her out and they left the hotel.Lin Che said, \u201cThis hotel is nice. It must be expensive, right?\u201dWithout looking at her, Gu Jingze replied, \u201cIt belongs to the Gu family. There\u2019s no need to pay.\u201dLin Che immediately reacted and turned her head back to look at the grandeur of the hall. It must have been at least a few stars.\u201cFive-star?\u201d\u201cSeven,\u201d Lin Che corrected herself. \u201cAny hotel under the Gu family is seven stars.\u201dLin Che regretted not staying longer.\u201cDamn! You should have told me earlier. I have never stayed in such a grand hotel. I could have at least stayed one night. It\u2019s free anyway.\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cIf you want, we can turn back right now.\u201d \u201dIt was just a remark, but she looked up at Gu Jingze and said, \u201cIf we turn back, are we going back together?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not used to staying in hotels. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s impossible. Weren\u2019t you staying in a hotel when I first met you?\u201d How else had she been able to drug him that time?Gu Jingze looked at her indifferently.Yes. It was precisely because of someone that he no longer felt hotels were safe no matter how secure they were.\u201cHm. Since then, I don\u2019t stay in hotels anymore,\u201d he said as his eyes swept across her.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che laughed dryly.So it was because of her.Lin Che laughed awkwardly and quickly changed the topic, \u201cWell, since you\u2019ve already stayed in a hotel with me, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. We have a legitimate relationship now. Staying at home and staying in a hotel are different experiences.\u201d She shifted her body to lean against his.Gu Jingze tilted his head, \u201cWhy stay in the hotel when we have our own home?\u201dLin Che raised her head and rolled her eyes, \u201cOld couples need a little excitement in their lives. Don\u2019t you think hotels are filled with energy and mystique?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her pursed lips, her eyes full of life and her suggestive tone. His heart wavered.His gaze fell uncontrollably onto her chest.The small slit revealed the soft curves of her chest.She had no idea how tantalizing it was.He frowned and pushed Lin Che, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWell, then the car will do too. It\u2019s actually even more exciting. The constricted space, people walking about outside, the risk of someone discovering what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze felt like cracking her head open to see what kind of rubbish filled it.However, as her eyes narrowed excitedly, his mouth felt dry.The chauffeur in front saw the way they looked at each other. It was as if they were about to catch fire. He silently wondered what exactly this couple was doing.Were they really planning to do something here?He was still there and he was a living person\u2026However, no matter what they were going to do, he was a chauffeur. He had been trained vigorously and he was not going to utter a word.Although, he really did not want to see anything\u2026Fortunately, Gu Jingze only reached out to push Lin Che again, awkwardly mentioning the opening in her clothes.Lin Che smiled and said, \u201cHey, Gu Jingze, why is your face so red?\u201dGu Jingze shot a glance at her to stop her from talking.Lin Che laughed loudly and said, \u201cWoah. Are you being shy, Gu Jingze? Who knew you\u2019d have such a pure side?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never done anything like that with Miss Mo?\u201d she tugged at his arm.Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened, \u201cYou think everyone is so shameless like you?\u201dLin Che shut her mouth. Very well, this Miss Mo was the best.His expression sank upon thinking of Mo Huiling.Lin Che noticed and tugged him, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t be angry. I was only joking.\u201dWhile leaning against him, she sighed and said, \u201cI know very well how you and Miss Mo love each other, yet you\u2019re unable to be together. She\u2019s right there but you can\u2019t hold her in your arms. Oh, what a forbidden love\u2026 Now that I think about it, I do empathize with Miss Mo. She must be missing you every day.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression sank even more.Lin Che seemed to be unaware of what she was saying, \u201cYou too, you could have spent time with Miss Mo instead of coming to find me since you\u2019re so free. You could have been enjoying a candle-lit dinner with her right now.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her, \u201cHow thoughtful of you.\u201dMaybe she deserved a \u2018Best Wife\u2019 award?\u201cBut of course. What are we to each other? Since we\u2019re living together, I have a duty to share your burden. It\u2019s alright. You can tell me anything you\u2019re upset about. I will help you ease your worries and make you feel better so I don\u2019t have to look at an unhappy face every day. This way, I will also be happy. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. If I wanted a counselor, I would have looked for a professional.\u201d\u201cAh, but professionals would cost money. Since I\u2019ve already used so much of your money, you might as well make your money\u2019s worth. Don\u2019t worry. You can totally treat me as a doctor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che continued, \u201cI\u2019m serious. Oh right, that Doctor Chen. How much does it cost to invite him home?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che thought that the doctor was rather skilled. He must have been earning tens of thousands a month, judging by Gu Jingze\u2019s wealth.Gu Jingze replied, \u201c30 million yuan annual salary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che said, \u201cMy dear, you can hire me, really. I\u2019m not as expensive. I\u2019ll come whenever and wherever. I will keep your secrets safe. I\u2019m responsible and we\u2019re husband and wife.

You can\u2019t be that violent. Who makes you want to do that?\u201dHis gaze engulfed her whole body.No matter how dumb Lin Che was, she quickly understood.It was her\u2026She knew that her existence had prevented him and Mo Huiling from being together, but there was no need to harbor such evil thoughts about her.\u201cGu Jingze, why are you in such a hurry to kill me when there\u2019s no point? Think about it. If you kill me, it\u2019ll be irreversible and you\u2019ll become a criminal. If we live peacefully now, I\u2019ll get to go my own way and you\u2019ll go yours in a few years. Then, you can be with your Miss Mo happily ever after. Isn\u2019t that better? There\u2019s no need to go through all that trouble, right?\u201dGu Jingze took a deep breath and looked in front of him to let the chauffeur know to pick up the pace.If he continued talking with Lin Che in this confined space any longer, her stupidity might drive him mad.Upon reaching home, Gu Jingze hurriedly got out of the car. He watched as Lin Che struggled to get out while the chauffeur hastily took out her wheelchair. He shook his head and forced himself to calm down as he walked back to helped her into the wheelchair.Later that night, Lin Che sat in her room looking at her phone and reading the news that was already reporting on Lin Li\u2019s engagement party.From the report, the party looked amazing and enviable.Lin Che read the comments below with many saying how beautiful Lin Li looked and how handsome her husband was.She sighed and turned off the comments. Lying down, she checked her Weibo.It was always filled with discussion, so Lin Che turned off the topic. However, she came across the latest Weibo thread which was unusually long and active.She opened it to see\u2026The thread began with a message saying, \u201cAlthough I do not think you deserve our Gu Jingyu, he likes you.

Please don\u2019t hurt him.\u201dAs Lin Che read on, she felt that something was not right.

You\u2019re together with Gu Jingyu?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s together with who?\u201d Lin Che had no clue what had happened.\u201cGu Jingyu just posted on Weibo.

I was afraid to disappoint my fans, my company, and all my friends and family who have supported me. There was never a moment when I was living for myself. But now, I wish to live for myself. As such, I hope you all will support us\u2026\u201dLin Che immediately started reading the comments that followed.Some people who joined in the hot topic said, \u201cPoor Jingyu. Let\u2019s all support him.\u201d\u201cSeeing Jingyu suffer like this breaks my heart. Regardless of your decision, I will always trust and support you.\u201d\u201cCelebrities are human too. They need privacy. We only take note of your work and as long as you\u2019re good, it doesn\u2019t matter who you choose to be with. We will always support you.\u201dLin Che felt like she was going crazy.The tabloids and Weibo publicized the news and it said: \u201cGu Jingyu\u2019s message hints at a declaration of his relationship with fellow actress Lin Che.\u201dLin Li\u2019s engagement that was all over the tabloids was now pushed to the bottom with this major news.Lin Che\u2019s forehead wrinkled up. She felt absolutely helpless.Lin Che wanted to brush off the comments after receiving hateful ones. Although most of the fans were much more courteous to her because of Gu Jingyu, there were still many who expressed their anticipation for her to get dumped.She was not even with him. How could she get dumped?The next day, Lin Che quickly rushed over to her company.Yu Minmin looked at her and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything now. The company is handling everything. You better not say anything carelessly or you might make matters more complicated.\u201dLin Che said quietly, \u201cI have nothing to say. I don\u2019t even know what I can say. There is nothing going on at all. Is Gu Jingyu trying to drag me down?\u201dYu Minmin was worried that she might want to admit the same thing in order to grab the spotlight and make matters worse.The newbies who were starting to get famous always had this kind of issue. They wanted the fastest way up. As soon as there was a chance to be in the news, they would do anything just to gain some fame and, in the process, complicate things.However, Lin Che had no such intentions. She seemed totally dumbfounded. Yu Minmin believed that she really did not think that way.With this, there was no cause for concern. Yu Minmin smiled comfortingly at her, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. See? Isn\u2019t everyone supporting you and Gu Jingyu?\u201d\u201cThe key point is the fact that there is nothing between us. What nonsense are they supporting?\u201dYu Minmin thought how pure this lady was. She had no motives whatsoever.She had a little more admiration for Lin Che. Patting her shoulder, she said, \u201cGu Jingyu might just be doing you a favor. Anything to do with Gu Jingyu will surely blow up. Just look at what happened to Lin Li\u2019s engagement. It made one headline but in the end, all that money went down the drain. I think she\u2019s the one who\u2019s vomiting blood right now.\u201dLin Che sighed. She had no experience in dealing with scandals. Best to leave it to the company.The other smaller celebrities were spiteful as they watched Yu Minmin personally walk Lin Che out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho knew she\u2019d become this famous?\u201d\u201cYeah, it seems like she\u2019s gained importance in the company.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly does Gu Jingyu see in her?\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s better to live,\u201d everyone was discussing maliciously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That makes you Mrs. Gu.\u201d\u201cBastard! There\u2019s nothing going on. Watch your mouth. There are reporters everywhere.\u201dReporters were everywhere. If they caught a word, she dared not imagine what would be in the headlines the next day. The entire crew had already acknowledged their relationship.No matter what she said, it would be of no use.Director Fu proceeded to give her a chair, \u201cCome, come. Mrs. Gu cannot sit on such a small chair. That is for last-minute actors. We should have a proper seat for you. Come, lie over here. This is all yours.\u201dLin Che felt like punching him, \u201cAre you trying to sabotage me?\u201dThere was a clear hierarchy in the crew. Small actresses like Lin Che dared to not invite attention. Big, comfortable lounge chairs like that were reserved for the big stars. Lin Che was content with finding a space for her own foldable chair as usual.Director Fu laughed loudly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the director\u2019s orders. Nobody will dare to object. Anyway, Lin Che, it\u2019s time for you to start getting used to it. You\u2019re already almost beating Sister Fei Ran in the headlines. You\u2019re no longer an unknown minor actress.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d as he said, Director Fu forced her onto the chair.Lin Che\u2019s mouth twitched as she sat there. It was indeed much more comfortable than her own foldable chair.Waiting for a scene was tiring. However, being able to lie there in comfort made a whole lot of difference.The actress at a similar level as Lin Che witnessed everything and was unhappy. She looked in Lin Che\u2019s direction with jealousy burning in her eyes.Too bad it was Lin Che that Gu Jingyu fell for.At the start, she thought that Lin Che deliberately caused all this. Now that Gu Jingyu admitted on his own accord, there was nothing anybody could say.They could only say that Lin Che was one lucky girl.Just then, Gu Jingyu entered late.He immediately saw Lin Che lying there using her phone and walked over to her, not caring about his agent\u2019s objections.Everybody\u2019s eyes followed this newly formed yin-yang concoction.Lin Che heard some noise and looked up to see Gu Jingyu smiling devilishly at her. The nerve of him to walk over like that. She wanted to punch him.\u201cHey, you\u2019re early,\u201d he greeted her with a smile.Lin Che got up and said, \u201cGu Jingyu, you\u2026 what\u2019s the meaning of your Weibo post?\u201dGu Jingyu raised his hands innocently and said, \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say? Didn\u2019t you say in your latest post, something about loneliness, something about lack of freedom, something\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that. Well\u2026 it\u2019s just a normal Weibo post. Just an expression of my feelings to gain some sympathy,\u201d Gu Jingyu said nonchalantly and sat down.Lin Che jumped up and raised her voice at Gu Jingyu, \u201cYou, you, you. Is that the normal you? Didn\u2019t you see the news?\u201d\u201cI did,\u201d he raised his head and glanced up at Lin Che who seemed like she was going to burst with anger. He thought it was cute.Just as she thought, he really did do this on purpose!Gu Jingyu said helplessly, \u201cYou know how reporters love imagining things. I can\u2019t help it. Look, I didn\u2019t even mention your name and yet they drew a connection to you. I never said anything about a girlfriend and yet they thought of that too. What can I do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che looked at Gu Jingyu\u2019s nonchalant face. She wanted to rip his mouth out.Yes, he did not mention her name and he didn\u2019t directly mention a relationship, but\u2026 that Weibo post was so obvious. He would be lying if he said it was not intentional.\u201cIn any case, you need to delete that Weibo post!\u201d Lin Che demanded.Gu Jingyu smiled and leaned against her chair, \u201cAlright, then I will say that Lin Che does not want us to be mistaken so I will be deleting that post.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d\u201cIs that not it?\u201d\u201cY-Y-You\u2026\u201d Lin Che was speechless. She was so mad at Gu Jingyu but she just could not win against him.Who said Gu Jingyu was cool? He was clearly a pesky little person.At the same time\u2026Gu Jingze was still unaware of the news between his wife and someone else.Mo Huiling called Gu Jingze up in the morning.She wanted to see him.Gu Jingze arrived at Mo Huiling\u2019s door. Mo Huiling looked at him sadly with melancholy in her eyes.Gu Jingze asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dMo Huiling said, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard from you for two days?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cI accompanied Lin Che back to her home for an engagement party.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Mo Huiling fumed, \u201cYou\u2019ve been ignoring me because of her?\u201dGu Jingze could hear the hatred that Mo Huiling had towards Lin Che in her voice.His brows furrowed. He said in a displeased tone, \u201cHuiling, this is not her fault. I had to marry and because of me, she was forced into this marriage as well.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s heart hurt as she looked at Gu Jingze.She knew that she was being impatient and had said some unpleasant things.She puckered her lips, tugged at his sleeves, and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t like her at all.\u201dGu Jingze knew it was natural for her to have such feelings. He said, \u201cI know that but I just want to say that this is all my fault. Don\u2019t blame her.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s lips tightened as she looked at him, \u201cI don\u2019t like it even more when you keep speaking up for her.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cJingze, I\u2019m just so lonely. When I\u2019m alone, I think of how you and she are together, officially married and living the life we\u2019ve always wanted. Living together peacefully and happily. Do you know how I feel? I can\u2019t help but imagine things.\u201dGu Jingze felt pain in his heart.Mo Huiling continued, \u201cFrom the moment you were sick, we stuck together but your family never approved of us. It\u2019s a lot of pressure on me, you know?\u201dGu Jingze knew that she went through a lot for him.Mo Huiling\u2019s tears rolled down her cheeks as she said, \u201cCan you accompany me to the villa for a walk?\u201dGu Jingze sighed, \u201cAlright.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe two of them drove to the villa by the river.This was Gu Jingze\u2019s villa. The wonderful scenery and wooden villa made a heartwarming sight.Mo Huiling arrived feeling a lot better. She took off her coat as she watched Gu Jingze gather wood outside for the fireplace. Breathing in the scent of the wood, coupled with a movie, this was pure bliss.Mo Huiling looked at Gu Jingze who was on one knee preparing the wood with deep concentration, the muscles on his arms flexing sexily. She could not stop staring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, they grew up playing together. They were all too familiar with each other.It was just that Mo Huiling\u2019s chest seemed to be unusually high as she lay there, resembling a hill.It looked big, but unnatural.He had not noticed before, but he suddenly thought of Lin Che\u2019s words.\u201cFake chests are easy to tell. It will remain standing high even when one lies down.\u201dWhen did Mo Huiling do her chest?He could not recall her mentioning it.Actually, Gu Jingze was not against women having cosmetic surgery. As long as she liked it, he did not care.The pursuit of beauty was human nature.However, he never heard Mo Huiling talk about it.He grew curious and asked Mo Huiling, \u201cHuiling, when did you have cosmetic surgery?\u201dMo Huiling immediately raised her chest, unnaturally looking at it as she touched her chin.She did have a few places done\u2026Cosmetic surgery was now so normal, but she definitely did not want Gu Jingze to know.She secretly went for it. After each time, she took the opportunity to go overseas for awhile and returned after recovering.A man like Gu Jingze who was too busy with work never noticed such things. Naturally, he never asked questions like that until now\u2026\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t. Why did you suddenly ask?\u201dGu Jingze glanced at her and felt like he could not look anymore, \u201cNothing. Just asking.\u201dShe looked down at her chest and thought that it should look natural. Of course, she went to the most expensive place with the best resources and best doctor. Those C-cups were not cheap.Not expecting Gu Jingze to be able to tell, she smiled and said, \u201cMy body is all natural. I have not done anything to it. You must think that it\u2019s too perfect. That\u2019s why you thought I had surgery, right?\u201dGu Jingze smiled as he didn\u2019t know what to say, \u201cYes, your body is nice.\u201dMo Huiling replied, \u201cBut of course. I usually pay attention to my body. I do lots of yoga and maintain it well. Everybody thinks my skin is flawless. My body is perfect thanks to my mother who was a beauty. I look like her, so I\u2019m beautiful as well. Don\u2019t you agree that I\u2019m beautiful?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her face and smiled, \u201cYes, you are beautiful.\u201dHowever, he looked at her face and thought that it was strange. If she looked like her mother, she should have single eyelids. Her eyes would not be so big and her double eyelids would not be so defined. More importantly, her chin was too sharp. Her mother was a famous round-faced beauty.But Gu Jingze kept his thoughts to himself. Looking at Mo Huiling, her skin was indeed good, but\u2026Lin Che\u2019s skin was much fairer and softer.Somehow, the image of Lin Che\u2019s porcelain skin appeared in his head.She really was fairer than most other women.Perhaps, because she was too white so her face did not look especially outstanding. However, looking at her was like looking at a porcelain doll. She looked delicate.\u201cJingze, I\u2019m talking to you. What are you thinking about?\u201d Mo Huiling shouted and sat up unhappily.Gu Jingze got up and said, \u201cNothing. I was thinking that you didn\u2019t have to put in so much effort. I like you not because you\u2019re thin, but because regardless of how you look, you will always be beautiful.\u201dHe still remembered how when they were young, she stumbled over to him in her little princess dress and said to him, Brother Jingze, nobody wants to play with you. I will play with you.From that moment, he told himself that he had to treat her well.It was just that looking at Mo Huiling now, he could not help but feel that Lin Che was right. She must have done something to her chest.However, Mo Huiling not only refused to admit it. She even lied to him.Gu Jingze understood that everyone had their own beauty ideals. Perhaps she did not tell him so that she could believe her body was all natural and a God\u2019s gift, but Gu Jingze would not have minded any of it.He was only concerned with the fact that Mo Huiling would actually lie to him.However, he did not expose her.He believed that she had her own reasons.He smiled and said nothing else. He finished setting up the fireplace but because of the weather, it did not burn much. They could only enjoy the feeling of it.The two of them sat on the sofa. Gu Jingze turned on the television and took the remote. Just as he wanted to switch to a movie, he saw the news play out on screen.\u201cAfter Gu Jingyu hinted at a relationship, there were no further comments from the crew. The management has also made it harder to pry. Gu Jingyu has never been rumored with another female actress, so everyone is anticipating this relationship with optimism.\u201dThe screen flashed an image of Gu Jingyu and Lin Che together.Mo Huiling immediately recognized Gu Jingyu.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is Jingyu fooling around with Lin Che?\u201dThose words make Gu Jingze\u2019s face turn completely black.Mo Huiling saw his face and thought that he was angry. She put more weight in her tone, \u201cThis Lin Che is too unscrupulous. How can she get together with your brother? How shameless.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cThis has nothing to do with Lin Che.\u201dMo Huiling listened and said quietly, \u201cIt takes two hands to clap. How could it have nothing to do with her?\u201d\u201cI believe Lin Che is not like this,\u201d he said adamantly.Mo Huiling snorted, \u201cYou believe her? That is so na\u00efve of you. I have seen too many uncultured girls like her. They would do anything for money. What\u2019s more is that she\u2019s in the entertainment industry.\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Gu Jingze got up from his seat.Mo Huiling was taken aback.Immediately, she followed Gu Jingze and got up angrily, holding back her tears as she shouted, \u201cYou yelled at me, Gu Jingze? You yelled at me for this woman?\u201dGu Jingyu paused and looked at Mo Huiling, \u201cIt\u2019s not because of her. Jingyu is also in the entertainment industry and he\u2019s also not that kind of person. There must be a reason behind this whole matter.\u201dGu Jingze got up and decided not to stay any longer. He took his coat and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to settle this matter.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going now\u2026\u201d Mo Huiling said unhappily, \u201cYou said you would keep me company.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze replied, \u201cHuiling, this news will cause a lot of trouble if people see it. It\u2019s best I hurry and take care of it.\u201dMo Huiling gritted her teeth. He was right. She stomped her foot on the ground, \u201cI don\u2019t care. You must make it up to me. I hardly get to be with you and now, you\u2019re leaving.\u201dGu Jingze sighed. He was in no mood to entertain her. He smiled patronizingly and said, \u201cOkay, I definitely will make it up to you.\u201dMo Huiling forced a smile but deep down, all she wanted to do was crush that annoying Lin Che to death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was ridiculous.Gu Jingze\u2019s face blackened.His brows creased like crinkled clothes, skin rolled into hills and hills.Gu Jingze saw that there were many comments below Gu Jingyu\u2019s Weibo post.\u201cI think they look quite good together after awhile. If they\u2019re together, so be it.\u201d\u201cThis Lin Che looks rather pleasant to the eyes. At least she looks different from the usual famous people. Not bad.\u201d\u201cAs long as Jingyu decided, we approve. Congratulations on being together. Last long.\u201dGu Jingze turned off his phone and looked up, his face as dark as a stormy sky. It gave off a vibe so scary that no one dared to look directly at him.\u201cSir\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you guys stopped all news about Third Young Master!\u201dQin Hao felt cold sweat on his back, \u201cSir, we did. It\u2019s just that this is the first time that Third Young Master has announced a relationship, so some tabloids continued.\u201d\u201cRelationship?\u201d Gu Jingze stared coldly.Qin Hao knew that he said the wrong thing and immediately said, \u201cOf course, the reporters don\u2019t know that Third Young Master was only joking.\u201dGu Jingze raised his hand to silence him.He pressed his brows and then walked in.Lin Che did not know what was going on.She had just got back from the set, mentally and physically drained. She cooked some instant noodles to comfort her broken soul.She was just done when she heard the door.Gu Jingze was home.Lin Che was holding a huge bowl of noodles, looking very happy with herself. She wore a small yellow apron with lace at the sides. It looked cute and it reflected the warm smile on her petite, delicate face.\u201cGu Jingze, you\u2019re back,\u201d she smiled as she put down her noodles that were almost burning her fingers. She pressed her fingers to her earlobes to cool down.Gu Jingze glanced over to the bowl of noodles and said, \u201cI\u2019m hungry too.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lin Che saw his expression and said, \u201cShall I cook you a bowl too?\u201d\u201cYes, okay,\u201d he said as he casually put down the coat in his hand and sat down.Lin Che pouted. How unceremonious.She returned to the kitchen and picked up the vegetable knife. She sliced some vegetables, ham, and cracked an egg.Gu Jingze looked at her and thought that there were some heartwarming moments with her.In a regular household, the husband usually waited at the table while his wife cooked in the kitchen.An aroma filled the air. Lin Che brought both bowls to the dining table. Gu Jingze looked at them and asked, \u201cWhy does your bowl have more noodles and vegetables than mine?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not that much more.\u201dWithout a warning, Gu Jingze reached over for her bowl and took it, \u201cI\u2019m eating yours.\u201d\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Lin Che wanted to stop him but he had already started eating his noodles.Lin Che could only look down at her fingers, \u201cI ate a bite of those noodles.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze looked up at her seriously.Lin Che felt uncomfortable with his stare. She quickly waved her hands and said, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s not like I made you eat it. You were picky.\u201dGu Jingze reached for her bowl and took a huge mouthful.\u201cHey, Gu Jingze, you\u2026\u201d\u201cAll things should be fair between husband and wife, right?\u201d Gu Jingze justified his reasoning.Lin Che said depressingly, \u201cI\u2019m not mean like you! It\u2019s not like I did it on purpose!\u201dGu Jingze lifted his head and snorted.Lin Che\u2019s eyes moved. She smiled widely and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just exchanging saliva. You eat min and I eat yours. There\u2019s no big deal, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened.How could a sentence like that be so warming?Lin Che continued, \u201cIn fact, exchanging saliva actually has health benefits.

This is too troublesome.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Che looked at him, puzzled.His dark eyes moved to her plump lips that were glistening in the light.Lin Che felt it. She suddenly understood what he meant.Her face turned red. She covered it with her hands. She was speechless.Gu Jingze looked at her standing angrily over there, unable to take back her words. He grinned happily.However, his eyes could not stop looking at her lips.Feeling her stare at him, he forced himself to look away.Lin Che snorted and sat down. Gu Jingze said as he ate, \u201cLin Che, have you nothing to say to me?\u201dSeeing how she was still in the mood to cook noodles, his heart began to burn up.Lin Che replied, \u201cLike what?\u201dGu Jingze pulled his face, \u201cLike maybe something about tabloids and rumors.\u201dLin Che reacted, \u201cAh, about that. It\u2019s just a rumor\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do either. Do you want to tell Jingyu about us? So that\u2026\u201d\u201cJingyu has issues with the family.

To announce her marriage with Gu Jingze at this time. The news out there was already overwhelming. How would she be able to continue acting?Gu Jingze looked at her face ridden with disdain. Although he wanted to resist, he could not help but start to feel sad.\u201cDo you not want people to know about us so badly?\u201d he asked.Lin Che replied, \u201cOf course. We\u2019ll be divorced sooner or later. Then, it\u2019ll be my second marriage. Also, I still want to act. The company does not know that I\u2019m married. My contracted stated that I cannot marry for three years. I\u2019m already violating it.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her deeply and then lowered his head, picking at his noodles.Gu Jingze said, \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t want to expose our relationship, you shouldn\u2019t overdo the rumors with Gu Jingyu, right?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 this I guarantee you. I really know nothing about. This\u2026\u201d she also had no idea why Gu Jingyu was crazy enough to post a Weibo message like that.She felt that Gu Jingyu was a rebellious child. With no rumors and under the tight management of the company, he decided to create some rumors himself.\u201cIt was all Gu Jingyu\u2019s doing. It has nothing to do with me, \u201d she could only say so much.Gu Jingze replied, \u201cI know he is rebellious, but he is never unreasonable. If you tell him outright that you don\u2019t like it, he will respect your opinion.\u201d\u201cI did, but he refused to delete his Weibo post,\u201d Lin Che had literally begged him to delete it. Gu Jingyu only continued to poke fun at her and not take her request seriously.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze said, \u201cYou have to reject him directly.

Maybe it was so unbearable for him that he was going to get really angry.She took out her phone and looked at it, still not quite willing to hand it over to him.Gu Jingze did not say anything and grabbed her phone.\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Lin Che asked seriously. She was unhappy that he took her phone just like that.Lin Che quickly snatched it back and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have his number. We\u2019ve only been messaging through WeChat.\u201dShe took her phone, opened the WeChat app, and said, \u201cI can text him myself.\u201dAs she said this, she thought about what to type, \u201cGu Jingyu, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right of you to dupe your audience. Your Weibo post is too misleading. Your fans think that you\u2019re in love but that\u2019s not true at all. I think it\u2019s best that you tell the truth.\u201dGu Jingze frowned while she typed. One moment, she paused, and the next moment, she was all serious. Deleting, typing, and hesitating. He impatiently grabbed her phone to look.\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d she said as he raised his brows at her message.\u201cThis is a rejection? You\u2019re having a discussion with him,\u201d Gu Jingze glanced at her.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lin Che did not want to come out too strong. If she offended Gu Jingyu, she would not know what the future held for her.Gu Jingze snorted and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to help you write.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201dLin Che knew that he would not do it nicely, so she quickly took her phone.Gu Jingze stood up tall and raised the phone up high with his arms.The petite Lin Che jumped up and down, trying to reach for it.Gu Jingze stood there calmly and quickly typed, \u201cGu Jingyu, I\u2019m actually already married. I love my husband very much. Your actions make me feel like I have let him down. So, please don\u2019t post such things that will easily mislead people and cause rumors. It is for the good of both of us.\u201dLin Che saw him write a long paragraph, but it was too blurry so she couldn\u2019t make the words out.Lin Che grew anxious and said, \u201cGu Jingze, give it back. I want to do it myself. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201dGu Jingze did not listen and continued typing furiously.As soon as Gu Jingze pressed \u2018send\u2019, a reply came from Gu Jingyu.It read, \u201cAre you seriously lying about being married just to avoid me?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s lips curled up, \u201cDo you want me to show you the certificate? I\u2019m really married and it really disgusts me that you would get me involved.\u201d\u201cDisgusted? In what way am I not being good that it makes you hate me? I thought you told me before that I was your highly-respected senior?\u201dShe had actually told Gu Jingyu that?Gu Jingze could not help but sigh as he replied, \u201cThose words were just to compliment you. I thought you would understand. Since you decided to drag me into this mess, don\u2019t tell me you actually like me?\u201d\u201cNow that you mention it, I do quite like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze almost wanted to puke.This Gu Jingyu was really asking for a death wish.Gu Jingze directly replied, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t like your type. I like my husband\u2019s type, a man who makes me feel secure. From the moment I saw him, it was love at first sight. I had to marry him. I have no interest in anyone else and especially not your gigolo type.\u201dHe had just sent the message when Lin Che climbed up the table behind him. Her arms wrapped around his neck as she climbed onto his back and tried to snatch her phone back.\u201cGu Jingze, give me my phone back!\u201d she shouted and grabbed his hand.Gu Jingze was not finished. He wanted to see what Gu Jingyu\u2019s reply would be but he felt that Lin Che had become so anxious. She bit his arm.Pain filled Gu Jingze\u2026This damned idiot woman actually bit him!He shouted and released the phone in his hand. It fell on the floor with a loud thud.Lin Che exclaimed, \u201cGu Jingze, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dGu Jingze felt that she was going to fall. Remembering that her leg was just recovering, he quickly grabbed onto both of them from behind.She had just stopped using the wheelchair but she had to walk slowly. Had she already forgotten the pain?He carried her on his back and refused to let her move, \u201cYou better be careful. What\u2019s going to happen if you fell?\u201dLin Che was too busy looking around for her phone to listen to him.She did not realize that her gold and silver necklace was grinding on his back. He felt her tender bosom press against his body.So obvious\u2026\u201cGu Jingze\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move! Calm down!\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s body grew hot. He felt himself tightening up.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to! Gu Jingze, you had no right to snatch my phone and drop it\u2026 You must pay for it!\u201d she demanded. Even though she had her arms around his neck, he could not help but feel his body tremble. Only then did they realize\u2026She was leaning against him, his hands firmly supporting her butt and his shoulders tense. Her chest was pressed against his back and her face brushed against his cheek. She was right beside his ear and she could smell the clear, masculine cologne from his neck.She immediately let go and coughed awkwardly.She did not mean to do that\u2026Gu Jingze finally let her go as well. She stood on the ground, too awkward to look at him in the eye.Gu Jingze felt better. His heart, which was initially racing, finally calmed down. He looked at the woman in front of him. He really felt like strangling her.Natually, Lin Che felt embarrassed. She could still feel the warmth of his body.It was so hot and so different from women.It was lingering.She suddenly remembered her phone that fell on the ground. She hurriedly picked it up and inspected it.The screen had fallen apart.She looked up, depressed and screaming, \u201cGu Jingze, you\u2019ll pay for this.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her indifferently and snorted while glancing at the screen.She checked her WeChat to find a reply from Gu Jingyu.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know I was such an annoyance to you. I won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201dThe next line read, \u201cAnd, I\u2019m not a gigolo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che was close to tears.She scrolled up to read all the texts that Gu Jingze had sent. She turned to him and yelled, \u201cGu Jingze, I\u2019m not shameless like you. I did not fall in love at first sight with you!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy else did you drug me then? Was it not to get in bed with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che did not know what to say\u2026Lin Che only thought about how she must have offended Gu Jingyu. What was she going to do about the next filming set or the promotions for the show? Not to mention, Gu Jingyu\u2019s influential power was tremendous. If he wanted to take revenge, how was Lin Che going to live in the future?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She turned around to see his face all sinisterly dark and icy as he inched closer towards her.Lin Che panicked.Right. It was his blood brother she was talking about. He should not be trifled with either.Lin Che hastily said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I didn\u2019t really want to drug him. I only heard from others that the drug would make people fall asleep. I was only planning to take a few pictures and leave. Who knew I\u2019d get duped too and you\u2019d become so beastly after eating that\u2026\u201dBeastly?Gu Jingze\u2019s face lightened.Even though he was mad that she would rather drug Gu Jingyu, her words somehow inexplicably eased some of his anger.Smiling slightly, he said, \u201cVery beastly?\u201dLin Che was stunned again. Her mouth was agape, revealing a set of perfect white teeth, \u201cWell\u2026.\u201dFeeling a strong sense of masculinity slowly approaching, it seemed for a moment that it had already tightly enveloped her. She felt like Gu Jingze was unconsciously getting closer and closer.She could even feel his breath grazing her cheek.His slender fingers held up her chin as he looked down at her and smirked.Lin Che said, \u201cYes, you were very beastly, were you not? Of course, that\u2019s a compliment\u2026 For all we know, it might have been because of the drug, but\u2026\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression darkened.This stupid woman\u2026She really did not know how to talk.Lin Che asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t be mad over something like this, right? Or is something else the matter? Is your illness acting up?\u201dShe noticed that his eyes looked strange, burning so hot that it was as if he could burn down people with his stare.As if he was possessed, Gu Jingze\u2019s dark pupils moved down to her. He lowered his head to look at her slightly moving lips. Her tongue looked delicate and lovable. Her lips were red and radiant against her beautiful, bright skin.Lin Che looked at him who seemed to be getting lost in his thoughts. She felt like she was being sucked in by him. Her feet were planted firmly on the ground and she did not want to move. The more she thought about getting away, the more she could not.His rough fingertips gently brushed across her lips. Looking into her bright and clear eyes, he said, \u201cLet me tell you. You can\u2019t go around complimenting a man that he\u2019s beastly.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis will easily cause him to misunderstand. Do you get it?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dHe tapped her lips lightly.Lin Che could only feel her lips get numb. Quickly pushing Gu Jingze away, she turned around and snorted before running inside.Closing the door behind her, she tried to calm herself down.Thinking of how seductive Gu Jingze was, her heart almost wanted to jump out.Did he not know that a man\u2019s seduction could be so deadly?Especially if it was such a sexy man like him.Lin Che thought,she was just a normal girl who had a recent experience. She had needs too. What was she supposed to do with him openly seducing her like that?It took a long time for Lin Che to return back to normal.The next day.Lin Che\u2019s scene was being filmed intensively. They were rushing to do a good job so it could be aired in time. It was definitely going to improve ratings.Thus, the filming was intense those few days.Lin Che saw Gu Jingyu enter from afar. She thought about what happened the previous day and felt too guilty to raise her head.However, Gu Jingyu had already spotted her and was smiling at her as if nothing happened.Lin Che\u2019s heart was pounding as she sat there and gulped down water when she heard a voice from above, \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on with you? You don\u2019t even want to see me anymore?\u201dLin Che almost spit out the water in her mouth. She raised her head to look at Gu Jingyu, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 There\u2019s nothing wrong with me.\u201dGu Jingyu saw guilt written all over her face. Looking deeply at her, he sat down and replied, \u201cHey, are you really married? You don\u2019t look like it at all. You\u2019re way too young.\u201dLin Che thought of what happened the night before and the rubbish texts that damned Gu Jingze sent. She hated him so much, but she could only say guiltily, \u201cSorry, I was too agitated yesterday and it made me say all those nasty stuff that I didn\u2019t mean to say. I feel bad about it. I\u2019m really married and I don\u2019t think age matters when it comes to marriage. I think it\u2019s more about when you meet the right person.\u201dGu Jingyu hesitated. Looking at Lin Che, he sighed and nodded, \u201cAlright. If it is that way, I won\u2019t make things hard for you. I wish you the best, but am I really a gigolo?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che shook her head immediately, \u201cNo, no. Of course you\u2019re not.\u201dGu Jingyu frowned and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s because I\u2019m not your type. That\u2019s why you pretended not to see me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 It\u2019s really because\u2026 I\u2019m married, so I don\u2019t take notice of other guys. I only feel respect and admiration for you and nothing else. You\u2019re like\u2026 You\u2019re like my dad. You\u2019re someone I truly look up to. Really,\u201d Lin Che did not want to tarnish his impression of her, so she begged him not to get upset over this matter. She tried her best to appease him.Seeing how exaggerated and fake she was, it was almost laughable. Yet, it was not detestable. Gu Jingyu could only shake his head silently.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your dad!\u201d Gu Jingyu said, \u201cRelax, I will delete that Weibo. I will also not bring this up again so you don\u2019t need to avoid me because of this. However, I\u2019m really curious about your husband. Just how great is he to make you fall in love with him? He must be very mature and stable for you to want to marry him at such a young age.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che thought, he should go ask his own Second Brother how he could say such shameless things.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCome to think about it, Gu Jingyu was really much more mature and stable than Gu Jingze.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing really great. You\u2019ll be able to see him sooner or later.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Gu Jingyu patted her shoulder as he smiled at her.After that, Gu Jingyu soon deleted his Weibo post. The company followed with a statement declaring that that was not a confession, but an expression of his feelings and personal thoughts. Gu Jingyu and Lin Che were just good friends who wished the public not to sabotage their friendship.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some people wanted to watch Lin Che make a fool out of herself because Gu Jingyu had still denied any romance between them. However, others felt that although he had said they were not dating, he also said that Lin Che was his friend. In the past, if anyone took advantage of Gu Jingyu to create hype and cook up a scandal, he would definitely show no mercy and smack them in the face. But this time, Gu Jingyu was very mild and had no intention of smacking her in the face at all.Before she had finished filming her scenes, Lin Che returned home. She saw Gu Jingze sitting there with his back as straight as a ramrod while he looked at his computer.Gu Jingze seemed to be a man who could always hold himself straight at all times.However, it was also because of this that he appeared extremely rigid and his stature was fatally appealing.When Lin Che entered, she stopped in her tracks. She looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s pair of slender fingers. They looked very suited to dance on the piano and travel over the piano keys. They looked as graceful as a distinguished ballet.She could not help but fall into a slight daze as she continued to look. There was a saying that men were the most handsome when they were serious; this was even more so when it came to Gu Jingze who was already ridiculously handsome.It was only when Gu Jingze raised his head and saw Lin Che standing at the door that he abruptly called out, \u201cAre you dumb, Lin Che?\u201dShe stood at the entrance thinking about God knows what, even laughing out loud in her daze.Gu Jingze thought,\u00a0He had really never met someone more dazed than her.But when he saw the webpage he was viewing on his computer display news that Gu Jingyu had already denied the romance, the corners of his mouth uncontrollably raised a little. As he looked at Lin Che, she was also much more pleasing to the eye.Thus, he smiled and waved his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t stand there blankly. Come in,\u201d he said after closing the webpage.Lin Che smiled in embarrassment. She did not think that she would actually look at a man to the point where she fell into a daze. Her ears were heating up and she did not really dare to look at Gu Jingze\u2019s profound and sensual eyes. She quickly said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m feeling a little unwell. I\u2019ll go in first and rest.\u201d\u201cUnwell?\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s brow furrowed in an instant. The smile that was initially on his face also followed suit and hardened.Seeing Lin Che walk further inside, he also hurried after her. \u201cWhat happened Lin Che? Do you feel unwell anywhere?\u201dUpon seeing Gu Jingze walk towards her, Lin Che panicked for a moment. She said randomly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m probably just very tired.\u201dGu Jingze followed her all the way into the bedroom. He looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cIs it because your leg injury hasn\u2019t healed?\u201dAlthough quite some time had passed, she had been working a little too hard at her job recently. She went out to film every day and worked deep into the night, only returning very late. While the wound was not big, it was at an important area.\u201cTake off your pants. Let me take a look and see if there\u2019s something wrong with your wound.\u201d Without giving her the opportunity to speak, Gu Jingze squatted down and started trying to remove Lin Che\u2019s pants.Apart from the times when she participated in events or wore her costume, when Lin Che usually went out, she always liked to wear a simple pair of jeans and sneakers. Right now, her jeans clung to her body so it was impossible to tell what exactly was wrong with her leg.Gu Jingze was not thinking about anything else either; he was just momentarily anxious when he asked her to remove her pants.But in an instant, a red flush spread over Lin Che\u2019s face and all the way down her neck.Remove what pants\u2026 a big man like him\u2026On the other hand, seeing as Lin Che did not move for a long time, without further ado, Gu Jingze anxiously began to help her remove her pants.\u201cQuickly remove your pants so I can take a look.\u201d As he said this, his large hands started grabbing upwards. He reined in the band of her jeans and started pulling it down.Lin Che instantly got anxious.She held his hand down in one swift motion. With her face red, she yelled, \u201cGu Jingze, are you crazy? I\u2026 I\u2019m fine. Why do I need to take off my pants?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cHow can I not take a look. If you feel unwell, just tell me. The major artery there is not a joke.\u201dHowever, when he raised his head, he came face-to-face with Lin Che\u2019s thoroughly flushed small face.At this moment, her narrow and small face looked like a completely ripened tomato as if it would explode with one pinch.It was only then that Gu Jingze realized that the hand that was held down was currently clutching her pants.His expression twitched and some embarrassment also showed on his face.\u201cThen just remove it. I want to look at the wound. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to do something else. What are you getting anxious for,\u201d he said while concealing the embarrassment on his face.Lin Che\u2019s breath stopped up her throat. She looked at him and said, \u201cEven then, I can\u2019t remove my pants either\u2026 I\u2019m not wearing anything underneath!\u201d\u201cHey, I\u2019m your husband anyway. It\u2019s no big deal for me to look either. Didn\u2019t you say so yourself before? It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t seen it before!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d\u201cBut what did you say? You\u2019re not wearing anything underneath?\u201d Upon hearing this, Gu Jingze thought that something was off. His brow furrowed in an instant.\u00a0Didn\u2019t that mean that, underneath was\u2026 was\u2026Lin Che\u2019s face turned red yet again. \u201cNo, I\u2019m saying\u2026 I\u2019m only wearing a pair of underwear!\u201dGu Jingze looked at her pants and said in a frustrated tone, \u201cIn that case, the areas that have to be covered are all covered. There is nothing that I shouldn\u2019t see. Do you think I want to look at your leg?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to look, then forget it. I didn\u2019t say that I would let you look either. Furthermore, it\u2019s not because of my leg injury. I\u2019m just tired. Can you go out and let me rest for a bit? I don\u2019t want you to sleep here tonight. You\u2019ll cause too much of a disturbance and I won\u2019t be able to sleep well.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t snore though and I\u2019m so much more well-behaved in my sleep than you are. How would I disturb you?\u201dYour presence is a disturbance\u2026\u201cIn short\u2026 can I sleep alone today? If we sometimes sleep in separate rooms, I reckon your family won\u2019t say anything either. It\u2019s not like every married couple sticks together every day.\u201dAlthough Gu Jingze found it weird, seeing as Lin Che was this anxious, he thought that it possible that she was really not too used to living together with him. Perhaps in these few days, she had been fed up for some reason and only had an outburst today because she was really tired.Thus, he thought deeply for a while before saying, \u201cIn that case, alright. I\u2019ll go out and sleep first today. You have a good rest.\u201dSeeing Gu Jingze say this, she only heaved a sigh of relief when he really went to take a blanket and walked out.Seriously.Lin Che slumped onto the bed. But she thought to herself,\u00a0This Gu Jingze was truly an evildoer, an evildoer!Lin Che thought,\u00a0Perhaps it was because she had really gotten to that age where she could no longer control her messy hormones.\u00a0It was why when she faced Gu Jingze, she drooled at the thought of him, her face turned red, and her heart palpitated, all for no reason.Luckily, in the few days after that, she was busy keeping up with the schedule, her feet barely touching the ground. She spent more time staying with the production team than at home. Thus, she did not have time to care about her problem with Gu Jingze.Filming for the television series finally ended.Gu Jingyu generously said that he would treat everyone to a night of fun together at the hotel. They would not return until they were drunk and if they collapsed, they could just stay overnight at the hotel. In short, they could go completely crazy for once.Thus, Lin Che asked Yu Minmin to go together as she wanted to bring Sister Yu along with her to have some fun.Yu Minmin immediately thought,\u00a0If she went, she would even be able to butter up to the director and the others,\u00a0so she happily agreed right away.On the way there, as Yu Minmin was driving, she said to Lin Che, \u201cIf we get famous in the future, we\u2019ll change our car to a celebrity van too.\u201dLin Che was still a small actress right now. Putting aside talk of a celebrity van, Lin Che did not even have a car.Lin Che was also very grateful to Yu Minmin; she drove Lin Che personally to and fro everywhere, regardless of what it was for.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYu Minmin said, \u201cThe place where Gu Jingyu is entertaining guests this time seems to be a clubhouse owned by the Gu family. I wonder if we\u2019ll meet Gu Jingze or someone like that.\u201d\u201cPtui\u2026 \u201d Lin Che spat out instantly.Yu Minmin said, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWhat do you want to meet Gu Jingze for?\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s to butter up to him a bit.

She felt that Yu Minmin was not pretentious and did not try to defend herself either, which was why she felt that Yu Minmin was not unlikeable.Although Yu Minmin did not treat her extremely well in the past, she did not actually treat her very badly either. It was just that Lin Che was not popular. Naturally, she did not have so many opportunities. Right now, Lin Che could be considered one of the talents who she was focusing on cultivating, so the relationship between the two had begun to improve greatly.Very soon after, they arrived at the clubhouse that Gu Jingyu had spoken about.From the outside, they could see that this was not a typical clubhouse; instead, it looked like a resort clubhouse that was fully equipped with amenities. Underground, there was an entertainment venue and above the ground, there was a hotel. They could eat, sing, play games and go to the bar all at one go.Observing from the outside, it was a high-rise building that took up a large ground area and made one instantly feel luxurious and classy.People from the production team had all arrived in groups of two or three. They were mutually congratulated each other and celebrated the completion of filming for the television series.Lin Che brought Yu Minmin along with her to sit at a place where it was not too crowded. They chatted leisurely and casually before sensing the enthusiastic sounds that presently exploded from around them when Gu Jingyu came.Lin Che also quickly lifted her hands to applaud. However, she saw Gu Jingyu greeting the crowd before directly coming towards her.Lin Che\u2019s confusion showed on her face. She looked at Gu Jingyu and felt slightly strange.However, Gu Jingyu sat directly beside Lin Che, his face completely calm.Lin Che said, \u201cWhy did you sit here?\u201dThere are special seats over there for lead actors and important people in the production team. Why did he run over here?Gu Jingyu looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet here. I like the quiet. Why?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlright, as long as you\u2019re happy.It was still Yu Minmin\u2019s first time sitting together with a top celebrity like this. She could not help but show her slight jitters; after all, although there were so many celebrities these days, there were only a few of these A-listers.Gu Jingyu saw her and tilted his head to smile too. Yu Minmin\u2019s face showed a flattered expression and she quickly smiled at him as well.After glancing at her, Gu Jingyu continued to start up a conversation with Lin Che. Lin Che could not reject it even if she wanted to.Initially, she felt like it was nothing, but when she saw the astonished looks that everyone was sending their way, Lin Che felt a little too embarrassed. She anxiously wanted to get away.When Lin Li came in, with one look, she unexpectedly saw Gu Jingyu sitting together with Lin Che.It was difficult for her to not see it too because everyone was looking over there and enthusiastically discussing it. It was too pertinent.She thought of her own well-organized engagement ceremony. Initially, she could have occupied the headlines for several days and be the subject of everyone\u2019s envy. However, a single Weibo post from Gu Jingyu allowed Lin Che to take advantage of it for a few days. Lin Li just felt her heart seize up in anxiety.Recently, Lin Che had really become arrogant! No matter where she went, she never forgot to attract attention.When Mu Feiran came in, everyone again proceeded to congratulate her together.Lin Che looked at Mu Feiran enviously and said, \u201cIt\u2019d be great if I could project an aura as strong as Sister Feiran\u2019s one day.\u201dBehind Mu Feiran was the crowd of assistants and other staff who came with her. When she came in, she made her presence felt everywhere.Gu Jingyu also followed suit and took a glance. He smiled and said, \u201cOne day, you\u2019ll be able to too.\u201dLin Che looked at Gu Jingyu. \u201cYou have such a glib tongue. Forget it. That\u2019ll take a long time.\u201d\u201cBelieve in yourself. Every path is made from walking step by step. Back in the day, when Feiran was so poor that she couldn\u2019t even buy a meal, she didn\u2019t think that she would make it till today either.\u201d\u201cReally? Sister Feiran even had a time like that?\u201d\u201cOf course. Otherwise, is everyone a celebrity the moment they\u2019re born?\u201dOf course! There were people who were born with gold spoons in their mouths. Lin Che glanced at Gu Jingyu. He and Gu Jingze were both such favored sons of God. They were the subjects of envy from birth.Gu Jingyu immediately sensed Lin Che\u2019s thoughts. He smiled and said, \u201cYou think that you\u2019d be happy if getting food was not a problem when you were young? Everyone has worries of their own; members of the Gu family do too. At the same time that we enjoy these benefits, we also have much more responsibilities weighing on our shoulders. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t be bothered to go back to the Gu residence. Look at me. I\u2019m so wild and free now, right?\u201dHowever, Lin Che could not help but think of Gu Jingze.Did Gu Jingze have worries too?It was true. Thinking about it, she knew that it was first from the fact that he had to accept a marriage that he did not desire.Thinking about it, she felt even more sympathetic towards Gu Jingze. He was completely fine but had fallen sick with this illness, making his perfect and great life a regretful one just because of Lin Che.\u201cHey, I\u2019m speaking to you. Who\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d Seeing that her mind had actually begun to wander, Gu Jingyu could not help but pinch her nose.\u201cAiyo, no way. I\u2019m not thinking about anyone at all,\u201d Lin Che muttered guiltily to herself.At the closing party, everyone enjoyed themselves very much and had a crazy time too. Following the completion of filming, there was going to be a break for some time while production on the television series began in full swing. When broadcasting was about to begin, everyone was going to gather again to promote and generate publicity for the series and begin attending promotional events.Everyone drank a substantial amount of alcohol. Naturally, Lin Che did not skimp on the alcohol either. After returning from her short trip to the washroom, she realized that she could no longer find anyone else.Even Yu Minmin had vanished without a trace.Lin Che could only drink alone there for some time. However, she heard someone say from behind her, \u201cMr. President actually came.\u201d\u201cAnyway, in the first place, this is the Gu family\u2019s clubhouse. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Mr. President coming to his own family\u2019s clubhouse.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t this place belong to Gu Jingze?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re biological brothers. Why make the distinction with your own family? You didn\u2019t see the spectacle earlier. It\u2019s likely that he\u2019s staying overnight upstairs, so they enforced even more security and prohibited anyone from entering.\u201dAt this moment, Gu Jingyu returned. Lin Che quickly pulled Gu Jingyu aside and asked, \u201cEarlier, they said that the President has arrived. Is he the eldest brother in your family?\u201dGu Jingyu nodded his head nonchalantly. \u201cYes. Is there anything wrong with him coming?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026 your family is really\u2026 each and every brother is a giant among men.\u201d\u201cSo you like it? If you like it, you can join the Gu family too. When that happens, I guarantee that you\u2019ll feel a completely different flavor,\u201d Gu Jingyu said while grinning.Even more afraid of being found out, Lin Che lowered her head. She thought to herself in embarrassment,Right now she was one-half of a Gu family member\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingming had been the President for three years. His track record had been consistently good and he enjoyed popular support. So naturally, there was always a large crowd of supporters following him wherever he went.Lin Che saw someone running out to see the President. She unknowingly shook her head and remembered something. She asked frantically, \u201cWhy is Sister Yu missing?\u201d\u201cSister Yu? That manager of yours? I don\u2019t know. She seemed to be drunk when I saw her earlier. She staggered out unsteadily and didn\u2019t return again at all.\u201d Gu Jingyu arched his eyebrows and said, \u201cOh, if she went upstairs and bumped into the President, then your fun will end for sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che thought gloomily that they would not be that unlucky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is he good or bad?\u201dGu Jingming turned out to be his brother. Lin Che thought he should know.Gu Jingyu pondered for a while. He smiled and said, \u201cWell, if you think about it, if he managed to take the position of the president, how simple can he be? That guy\u2019s heart is as cold as his appearance. He\u2019s a big bad wolf who will do anything for power!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Che was shocked to the bone. The President seemed rather nice on television.Gu Jingyu looked at her and laughed loudly. This Lin Che could be so silly sometimes.\u201cOkay, I was pulling your leg. He\u2019s actually pretty normal. He\u2019s just more of a loner. Hm, he\u2019s a little weird, a little difficult to handle, a little hard to get along with, a little\u2026\u201d\u201cAll of you in the Gu family are the same kind\u2026\u201dWas he not like Gu Jingze?\u201cHey, what do you mean by all of us? Am I hard to get along with?\u201d\u201cOh, no no\u2026\u201d Lin Che almost slipped her tongue as she laughed dryly.Lin Che tried to call Yu Minmin again but no one picked up. When she called again, the phone had been turned off.Lin Che\u2019s heart panicked a little. However, she had no other choice. She wanted to get up and take a look but realized that the entrance had been locked shut. She could only think about what to do as she went back. Yu Minmin was an adult anyway. She would not get lost.When she got home, she quickly looked for Gu Jingze. Although she had been avoiding him recently, she had no choice but to get his help this time.\u201cGu Jingze, how is your relationship with Mr. President?\u201d Lin Che asked urgently the moment she entered.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che, \u201cWe are brothers. What do you think?\u201dLin Che continued hastily, \u201cMy manager has gone missing since lunch. I can\u2019t find her anywhere. I would like to ask for your help to search around and maybe ask Mr. President if she had entered there. The security is tight up there so I couldn\u2019t go. I\u2019m afraid that she might have been mistaken for a bad person and his security guards might have apprehended her.\u201dSo that was the issue.Gu Jingze had been busy with work recently. However, looking at Lin Che made him remember that he had not seen her for a few days.Whenever he was home, she was either still out or staying overnight at the set. The next day, she would leave as early as possible. Now that he thought about it, she seemed to be even busier than himself.Gu Jingze asked, \u201cHave you been very busy lately?\u201dLin Che was taken aback. Looking at his faint expression and discerning gaze, he seemed suspicious. She dared not to tell him that she was deliberately avoiding him.Lin Che rubbed her ear, \u201cOh, yes. I have been busy filming and preparing for the promotion. Why?\u201dGu Jingze put his hands on the table as he hoisted himself up and looked at Lin Che, \u201cAre you asking for my help?\u201dLin Che nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf I help you, how are you going to thank me?\u201dLin Che snorted and said, \u201cHow would I know? You are rich. You can get anything and everything you want. There\u2019s nothing I can give you.\u201dGu Jingze smiled and gestured for her to come over.Lin Che bowed her head and went over in a few quick steps.Gu Jingze asked, \u201cDo you know how to massage?\u201d\u201cHuh? No.\u201dGu Jingze frowned, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to do anything. What kind of wife are you?\u201d\u201cMust I know how to perform so many tasks to be a wife\u2026\u201d Lin Che said quietly.Gu Jingze replied, \u201cOf course. What\u2019s the point of having a wife?\u201d\u201cTo spend your money. You earn too much. If I don\u2019t use your money, how will you be able to finish spending it all?\u201d Lin Che answered shamelessly.Gu Jingze looked at her, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come up with such a warped answer. Come, massage my shoulder for a bit. Ask me nicely and I might just consider your request.\u201dLin Che looked at his proud expression and said hatefully, \u201cWhat a wicked capitalist you are. Making use of a poor citizen like me.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cOf course! It\u2019s justified. I have to call up Gu Jingming who is the president. You think any normal person would be able to do that?\u201dHe made it sound like it was such a big deal. Was he not just his brother?Lin Che snorted in contempt, but seeing Gu Jingze tilt his head expectingly and waiting for her service, she could only force herself to walk behind him.Her hands began to press his shoulders.His shoulders were broad. Tracing the fabric, she found his muscles and used her strength to press them.Unknowingly, he took off his shirt to reveal his fully ripped body. His triangular figure could really make a person\u2019s nose bleed.Her heart grew hot. Looking at the back of his head, her mind began to wander.She wondered what shampoo he used. His thick, black hair was so clean and smelled so good.Honestly, an elegant man looked good at any angle.The back of his head looked so good.Gu Jingze said, \u201cGo on, why did you stop?\u201dLin Che snapped out of it. To think she actually got entranced by the back of his head.She continued pressing and said, \u201cYour shoulders are so tense. Are you usually so busy with work?\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cOf course. As a husband, I have to carry the household on my shoulders. Wouldn\u2019t they be tense?\u201dLin Che burst with laughter.Upon hearing her laugh, Gu Jingze laughed too.Her small hands had no strength at all. When she pressed, he could feel her trying her best, but he did not feel relaxed at all. In fact, he felt his shoulders tense up even more.Because her hands were too weak, it made him not want to be pressed.However, he did not want her to let go. Feeling the gentle squeeze, he smiled and said, \u201cOkay, since you were so sincere, hand me the phone.\u201dSeeing Gu Jingze finally give in, Lin Che hurriedly handed the phone to him.Gu Jingze made the call, but it did not get through.Gu Jingze said, \u201cSomeone is busy.\u201dLin Che\u2019s petite face fell.Seeing her worried expression, he did not want to agitate her, \u201cLet me try contacting his secretary.\u201d\u201cAh, really? You\u2019re too nice, Gu Jingze,\u201d Lin Che\u2019s face immediately blossomed.Gu Jingze smiled at her, picked up his phone, and tried again.This time, it went through.\u201cI couldn\u2019t get through to Mr. President. Is he busy?\u201dOn the other end of the line, someone said quietly, \u201cSecond Young Master, Mr. President is already asleep.\u201d\u201cAsleep?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cOh, okay then. Can you help me check if you guys had apprehended a drunk woman today?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, we have not.\u201d\u201cAlright, send my regards to Mr. President.\u201d\u201cYes, Second Young Master. I will let him know first thing tomorrow. Is there anything else I can do for you, Sir?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat will be all.\u201dHe put down the phone and turned to Lin Che who was full of anticipation. He told her, \u201cThey did not catch anybody. You can relax. Your manager must have gone home herself.\u201dLin Che heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cThat scared me to death. I thought I would be finished if I offended the president.\u201dGu Jingze laughed, \u201cSince when were you such a scaredy cat? You dared to insult me, yet you\u2019re scared of the president?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I was fine by myself but my freedom got stolen and I suddenly became somebody\u2019s contract wife. I still have to face you daily and tolerate your weird temper!\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face sank.She still felt wronged.Suddenly, he got up and took a step forward. He hovered over Lin Che\u2019s petite face and looked at her chin. He reached out to hold it and said, \u201cCome again?\u201dHis icy breath mixed with his cologne as he got close. Lin Che was scared. Feeling the warmth of his hand, she looked at his face which became unreadable. Looking at him stiffly, his lips were right in front of her. If she made any movement, she might just touch them.Lin Che quickly pulled his hand away, \u201cGet off me. You\u2019re too close. It\u2019s getting hot.\u201dHer face was hot to the touch. She could not stand it any longer. She stomped on his foot and squirmed her way out from his side. Without turning back, she ran out.\u201cOuch\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze winced in pain.This damned Lin Che\u2026 she really used all her energy.Gu Jingze frowned at her back, \u201cWell done, Lin Che. As soon as you\u2019ve made use of me, you\u2019re turning your back on me?\u201dLin Che pretended not to hear. She ran into her room and slammed the door shut.She took deep breaths and patted her own chest.That stupid gangster was provoking her again.She had not calmed down when she could hear Gu Jingze\u2019s voice right outside.He still had work to do but after all that ruckus with her, he could not calm down either. He followed her to the bedroom.Lin Che refused to let that gangster in. Leaning against the door, she locked it and said, \u201cYou can sleep in the other room.\u201dHearing what she said, Gu Jingze replied sadly, \u201cWhy do I have to sleep in the other room?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t done that before. Anyway, I\u2019m dead tired and I don\u2019t want you to disturb me.\u201dShe was already getting used to it.He replied, \u201cThis is my bedroom. I can sleep in here if I want to sleep in here. Open the door.\u201d\u201cNo. I just offended you. Who knows what you\u2019ll do to me,\u201d Lin Che was finding excuses to not let him in.Gu Jingze huffed, \u201cYou\u2019re offending me even more now.\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re already offended, a little more won\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cFine, Lin Che. In that case, aren\u2019t you afraid of me taking revenge? Your show will never be played and the company will kill you off quietly\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Che panicked, \u201cGu Jingze, you\u2019re not that unreasonable. We promised not to meddle in each other\u2019s affairs after getting married.\u201d\u201cI have done more unreasonable things than this. Don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m a capitalist,\u201d Gu Jingze snorted.Lin Che mulled over it and then slowly opened the door a little bit.Little did she expect Gu Jingze to instantly push open the door with his huge palm. Lin Che stumbled a few steps back, shocked. Gu Jingze looked and quickly stretched out his arm to grab her waist, pulling her back to her feet as she almost fell.Lin Che let out a sound and she realized that her face was pressed to his face. She felt her face rapidly burning up as she looked at his characteristically thin lips. Her throat was hoarse and she could not utter a word.She panicked and quickly pushed Gu Jingze away. Gu Jingze frowned as he immediately grabbed her wrist.He stared into her eyes as she tried with all her might not to look back at him. He got more upset as he pulled Lin Che up, \u201cLin Che, what are you doing? I feel like you\u2019ve been trying to avoid me recently.\u201dLin Che was stunned.He had realized?\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not avoiding you,\u201d she struggled to get loose from his grip.Gu Jingze\u2019s grip was tight, \u201cNot avoiding me? Then why aren\u2019t you looking at me or even chasing me out?\u201dLin Che turned around, \u201cNo way. You\u2019re just being paranoid.\u201dGu Jingze pulled Lin Che towards him, his slender fingers pinching her cheek and forcing her to look at him.\u201cThen look me in the eye and tell me you\u2019re not avoiding me.\u201dLin Che raised her head and stared into his deep-set eyes. Her lips moved but nothing came out.The truth was that she had been avoiding him because each time she saw him, she felt her body grow hot.She quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m really not avoiding you. Let me go.\u201d She forcefully pried his hand open.Gu Jingze became more vexed. Looking at Lin Che turn away, he followed close behind and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you, Lin Che?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s going on with me? There\u2019s nothing going on. I\u2019ve just been busy lately.\u201d\u201cThen why did you shut me out?\u201d Gu Jingze naturally did not believe her.\u201cBecause I\u2026 don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing the same room with you. Besides, our marriage is a fraud. If anyone were to ask, we\u2019ll just say that our honeymoon period is over and we\u2019re both busy. So sometimes, we sleep separately. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d\u201cLin Che\u2026\u201d a bad feeling suddenly came over Gu Jingze, \u201cAre you avoiding me because you have fallen for someone else?\u201dIt just did not make any sense to Gu Jingze.Lin Che froze.She did not even think of something that far-fetched.Since he already brought it up, Lin Che played along, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I like someone else, but I\u2019m going to have a boyfriend sooner or later. I might as well be abstinent now so I don\u2019t waste a good part of my youth.\u201dShe thought,It was indeed time she got a boyfriend. Growing up, she had never liked nor got close to any guy other than Qin Qing.So looking at Gu Jingze then, she felt all tingly.She must have been so overwhelmed by hormones that she became so boy-crazy.Gu Jingze\u2019s brows knotted and light flashed in his eyes as he looked at Lin Che\u2019s moving lips. He suddenly felt an impulse.Swiftly, he took a step over.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne hand held her shoulder while the other braced the back of her head. He went for it and bit her red lip.His tongue swept over her lip and almost subconsciously slipped into her mouth.Lin Che was stunned. She felt his cool, slippery tongue invade her own mouth.

Gu Jingze\u2019s strong body leaned against her and one of his hands had already sneaked in from underneath.The instant their skin touched, Lin Che felt the extreme heat of his hand.Her body began to tremble like a sieve. She felt his calloused fingertips sweep across her skin, leaving her with ripples of shudders in its wake.More than half the length of her clothes had been lifted up. His palm traveled upwards and followed the contours of her body. But then, they heard a phone ringing.Gu Jingze detached his lips from hers. With his breathing fast and irregular, his eyes darted away as he listened to the sound.He silently cursed at this infuriating sound.The taste of her body still remained on his lips. He licked his lips slightly and somewhat wistfully. He did not feel an ounce of disgust. Instead, it made him feel a sense of great longing.Lin Che\u2019s eyes were misty. Her cheeks were flushed with two patches of red that looked just right.He let go of her. His hand was still hot and when he took it out, there was a thin sheen of sweat on his palm. After glancing at Lin Che, he then turned his head around and grabbed his phone swiftly.It was a call from Gu Jingming\u2019s General Secretary.Gu Jingze accepted the call.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, we were just notified that a woman did indeed barge in. Does Second Young Master know this person?\u201d\u201cYes, her name is Yu Minmin.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely her. Second Young Master, don\u2019t worry.

He\u2019ll have the chance to meet her.\u201d He smiled faintly and raised his head to look at Lin Che who was standing at the side with her clothes still completely disheveled.He put down his phone, looked at Lin Che, and said, \u201cYour manager is fine now.\u201dLin Che looked at him.Any trace of everything that had happened earlier could not be seen on his face at all. It was as if nothing had happened; he was still speaking to her as he looked at her with a crystal-clear gaze.However, she could still recall the very obvious ripples of emotion that he had left on her body earlier.Her anger was uncontrollable and she seriously wanted to toss all concerns aside and kill him.With a stomp of her foot, she yelled at Gu Jingze, \u201cGet out! Stinking rogue.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBefore Gu Jingze had even registered this, Lin Che was already walking towards him in large strides. She rained punches down on his body one after another; although it did not hurt, it was still irritating.Gu Jingze could only retreat continuously while looking at her going berserk. Even though he could easily hold down her thin and weak body, he did not do so.He allowed himself to be pushed outside like this.Gu Jingze said, \u201cLin Che, what\u2019re you doing?\u201d He grabbed her wrist and looked at her boiling-hot cheeks.Lin Che glared at him in indignant resentment. \u201cRogue, get out!\u201d\u201cRogue?\u201d His brow immediately furrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, so everything I did is completely legal, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che was actually a little speechless.Gu Jingze frowned and said, \u201cSo, how are you going to look for a boyfriend now? Lie and say that you\u2019re not married?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Lin Che was merely contemplating it. She had not put it into action at all yet. But how could she say this now?Gu Jingze stared at her with dark, hooded eyes. He said seriously, \u201cI won\u2019t permit you to find a boyfriend now.\u201dLin Che\u2019s heart jolted.What did he mean by this?Gu Jingze looked at her. His dark and gloomy expression brought a deep glimmer. \u201cSo you\u2019d best give up on this thought.\u201dLin Che still wanted to say something, but Gu Jingze suddenly came closer again. \u201cIf you must give it a try, I advise you not to try provoking me again.\u201dThe lines of his cold, hard jaw were pulled taut. When he came closer to her, a sense of dominance arose spontaneously, instantly causing Lin Che to be on edge and her heart to vigorously thump in her chest.With her eyes darting everywhere, Lin Che quickly pushed him out with all her strength.\u201cDon\u2019t think you can come in again and behave like a hoodlum, hmph.\u201dSaying this, she shut the door with a thud.Just like that, Gu Jingze was shut outside. He looked at the tightly-closed bedroom door and drew in a deep breath.He was being shut outside the bedroom by his own wife?\u201cLin Che\u2026 just you wait,\u201dGu Jingze growled lowly at the door.When he saw a maid pass by at the side, he put on a poker face and walked towards the guest bedroom, mentally preparing to just put up with it for one night.Lin Che lay on the bed, still feeling an unbearable heat in her face. She tossed and turned but could not sleep.Meanwhile, in the other room, although Gu Jingze had slept on the couch for so long and only now after great difficulty did he get to sleep on the bed, he felt a slight discomfort all over his body.Because Lin Che stayed in the bedroom, there was always a light fragrance lingering vaguely in the bedroom air. It seemed to be the scent exuding from her body, but it was also like the scent of any other girl.On the other hand, there was only the clean and fresh smell of the disinfected blankets in here. Although it did not smell bad, it still made him feel uncomfortable.When he raised his head and instinctively wanted to go and take a look at the woman with an extraordinarily terrible sleeping posture, he could only see the wall. He vaguely felt a little unaccustomed to the environment. He lay there for God knows how long before finally falling asleep.The next day.Following the completion of filming for the television series, Lin Che had to go to the company for a meeting to confirm her future plans.Lin Che arrived at the company bright and early. She saw Yu Minmin with a dispirited expression on her face and hurriedly walked over to ask, \u201cSister Yu, what did you do yesterday? You suddenly disappeared halfway.\u201dA tinge of embarrassment flashed across Yu Minmin\u2019s face. She lifted her head and said, \u201cI drank a bit too much.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cI got some people to go over and ask around. They said that you barged into Mr. President\u2019s restricted area. Was everything fine?\u201dYu Minmin gathered up her own hair as she said, \u201cWhen I went there, Mr. President had obviously not arrived. I don\u2019t how it became a restricted area afterward. Luckily, nothing much happened and they later sent me back home.\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s really great. It looks like Mr. President is quite a good person,\u201d Lin Che said.Yu Minmin shrugged her shoulders noncommittally. However, she looked more or less a little tired out.Lin Che said, \u201cComing up next are probably the publicity events.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cYes, they\u2019re rushing to broadcast the television series during the summer holidays. Although filming was completed, the real hectic period will arrive after this. You must be prepared. The company may also arrange for you to get some experience and develop speaking skills for when you accept interviews. If you happen to go for promotions together with Gu Jingyu, the reporters will definitely catch you and Gu Jingyu and ask you all sorts of questions when the time comes. You can\u2019t speak recklessly and say the wrong thing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che said, \u201cDo I have to be interviewed too?\u201dShe thought,She was still just a small actress and had never properly been interviewed before.Yu Minmin said, \u201cOf course you have to. You\u2019re one of the main characters. Although you\u2019re not the lead character, you have quite a number of scenes too. Furthermore, news of you and Gu Jingyu now will always be in the headlines.\u201dLin Che thought awkwardly,She had simply been pulled up into the headlines despite having no works.It made her confused as to whether she should be glad or plaintive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the event, Lin Che saw from afar that Lin Li had come along as well. She walked towards them in large strides. A row of assistants and staff followed behind her, giving her an imposing aura.Lin Che currently sat in the shared dressing room. When she momentarily saw Lin Li, she could not help but ask, \u201cShe\u2019s not doing her make-up? Why did she leave?\u201dThe make-up artist looked at Lin Li who had walked past, and smiled. She said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to the private dressing room. She has a specialized personal make-up artist to do her make-up. Why would she need us?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Che finally understood. She was a celebrity; of course, she was different from them, the new and unknown artists.Behind her, the other unknown actors with her said in a dissatisfied tone, \u201cShe\u2019s not that famous either. But why are her treatment and imposing aura comparable to Mu Feiran\u2019s?\u201dThe make-up artist contoured Lin Che\u2019s face while saying, \u201cAfter all, Lin Li is different. Her family background is obvious and she\u2019s also the Qin family\u2019s future Young Madam. She doesn\u2019t lack money, so of course, she has an impressive air about her.\u201dLin Che thought that it was very funny. She and Lin Li were undoubtedly both members of the Lin family, but everyone did not know.The Lin family had continuously avoided divulging Lin Che\u2019s status as an illegitimate daughter. Lin Che was also really dispensable in the Lin family and was even a detested character. Thus, she too could understand why everyone did not know her family background.Luckily, Lin Che did not care at all either.It was to the point where it would be even more torturous to her if she and Lin Li were to participate in promotions with the label of sisters tacked on them.Lin Che felt at ease as she did her make-up and simultaneously surfed on her Weibo account.The first batch of promotional pictures for the television series had already been released. Everyone\u2019s character posters had been beautifully taken and uploaded on various news portals and Weibo pages for advertisement.Lin Che saw the comments below. Some people were indeed unbiased; they looked at Lin Che\u2019s character poster and felt that she was very beautiful. But there were people who were bound to be malicious; they wrote directly at the bottom, \u201cShe looks horribly ugly.\u201d Or they said things like, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t fit the character\u2019s image at all,\u201d \u201cThat nose is obviously fake,\u201d \u201cAt which hospital did she extend her eye corners? Why does it look exactly the same as that person? It\u2019s probably from the same doctor.\u201dSeeing these comments, Lin Che\u2019s blood began to boil. With her phone in her hand, she said gloomily, \u201cHow can they say that I had plastic surgery? I\u2019m obviously all-natural.\u201dShe raised her head to ask the make-up artist, \u201cDo I look like I had plastic surgery? Yours truly does want to get plastic surgery, but first I need to have money too. Yours truly received a role for the first time. How can I have money to get surgery?\u201dThe make-up artist burst out laughing immediately, thinking that this Lin Che was really amusing.Yu Minmin sat at the side eating something and waiting for her to do her make-up. \u201cAlright, which rookie debuts without first being scolded. Furthermore, plastic surgery is so easy to get nowadays. But I really can\u2019t see people thinking that nose of yours is fake. It\u2019s so flat that if you really spent money to do surgery on it, then the hospital\u2019s expertise was a little too poor.\u201dLin Che turned her head and whined, \u201cIt\u2019s not that flat either\u2026 \u201dYu Minmin could not be bothered with her and said to the make-up artist, \u201cContour her nose a little more. It\u2019s too flat. It\u2019s so ugly.\u201dJust when everyone was having a good time, Gu Jingyu was too drawn to the dressing room by the joyful laughter here.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d Gu Jingyu asked someone.\u201cIt\u2019s Lin Che.\u201d The manager replied and said, \u201cShe chatters everywhere she goes. She\u2019s really good at it too; she can build good relations with anyone. She\u2019s simple-minded, but her personality is really not bad. It\u2019s easy for everyone to like chatting with her and she doesn\u2019t act arrogant at all either.\u201dGu Jingyu smiled and looked towards her direction. He glanced at Lin Che meaningfully before also walking over in a few steps.\u201cHey, what\u2019re you so happy chatting about?\u201d Gu Jingyu said.A few make-up artists and small actors all spaced out slightly when Gu Jingyu came. However, they saw that Gu Jingyu seemed to be in a good mood. He sat down directly and they also consequently became more at ease.Gu Jingyu looked at Lin Che. \u201cI heard you laughing from so far away. Your voice is really loud.\u201dAfter gradually getting familiar with Gu Jingyu, Lin Che really did not feel that he was as difficult to get along with as everyone said. Instead, he wasn\u2019t very pretentious, so she began to become more casual when chatting with him as well. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the noise? If you dislike it, then go to the private dressing room over there. Why would such a famous person run over here to gather together with us?\u201d\u201cHey, how can you not even welcome me? Didn\u2019t you see everyone else ushering me in with drums and gongs.\u201dThe remaining people all looked at the two of them chatting together like this and could not help but be slightly stunned.Who said that Gu Jingyu did not like chatting with the other actors in the cast? Obviously, he was quite amiable.But even the people who knew this were indeed surprised. They knew that Gu Jingyu\u2019s relationship with Lin Che was really not bad. Otherwise, they would not have this much fun chatting.The moment Lin Li came out, she saw the two of them in the middle, surrounded by others. She did not know what they were chatting about that made the entire shared dressing room appear to be in an extremely merry mood, filled with joyful laughter and cheerful chatter.Lin Li snorted disdainfully. \u201cThis Lin Che is so flirtatious.\u201dBeside her, a small assistant said, \u201cNot everyone has a natural advantage like Sister Lin Li. She doesn\u2019t have money or power, or even a strong family background, much less a wealthy and handsome fianc\u00e9 like Third Young Master. Of course, she can only depend on her ability to seduce men in order to climb up the social ladder.\u201dHearing the assistant say this, Lin Li felt much more refreshed.\u201cPrecisely. I can\u2019t even be bothered to build good relations with these strange people.\u201dWere they even worthy of her?But seeing Gu Jingyu have such a good relationship with her, Lin Li did indeed feel unbearably jealous.Very soon, they were starting to make arrangements for the interview at the front.But unexpectedly, when Gu Jingyu went for his interview, he pulled Lin Che along with him too.Lin Che was initially a little reluctant, but the reporters were also extremely happy and immediately coaxed the two of them to accept the interview together.Lin Che stood beside Gu Jingyu. Looking at the numerous reporters surrounding them with microphones lined up in a row, one after another in front of her, she felt immensely complex.During the few months preceding this, she had never thought that she would one day stand in the limelight and be interviewed.But in the mere span of a few months, her world had already undergone an earth-shattering change.However, the reporters below were aggressive. One of them looked at Lin Che and came up immediately to ask, \u201cLin Che, how do you feel about being put together as a couple with Gu Jingyu in the past?\u201dLin Che did not expect the reporter to be so straightforward. In that moment, she was unable to respond.However, beside her, Gu Jingyu instantly snatched the microphone and said, \u201cShe definitely feels that it was great. After all, it\u2019s really an honor to be involved in rumors with a handsome guy like me.\u201dLin Che raised her head gratefully. Gu Jingyu flashed a comforting smile at her as if he was saying that she could rely on him for everything.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe reporter said, \u201cLin Che, did you two meet privately again?\u201dGu Jingyu snatched the microphone again and said, \u201cHow can we meet? Thanks to all of you, we can\u2019t even meet at friendly gatherings. I made a friend after such great difficulty. You guys should stop adding to my troubles.\u201dIn an instant, everyone started roaring with laughter upon being chided by Gu Jingyu.Lin Che truly felt that Gu Jingyu was doing a very good job. Each time the reporters said something, he was always able to change the subject. He made the interview interesting and at the same time, he did not answer too many of the gossipy questions that he did not want to answer as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This Gu Jingyu was actually protecting Lin Che.The reporter turned to Lin Che, \u201cLin Che just began filming and she has already gotten to know such a good senior. Isn\u2019t she lucky?\u201dGu Jingyu could not possibly divert this topic as well.Lin Che smiled and hastily said, \u201cYes. Senior Gu Jingyu has been very nice to me. He shared with me a lot of his acting experiences.\u201dGu Jingyu asked, \u201cHow are you going to repay me, then?\u201d\u201cHuh? Repay?\u201d Lin Che did not expect him to divert the topic yet again, \u201cHow can I repay you?\u201dGu Jingyu replied, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you treat me to a good meal?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe reporter at the side was going crazy, \u201cYou two are going to eat together?\u201d\u201cShe should treat me to a meal obviously.\u201dThe reporter moved closer to them. Lin Che secretly wanted to crush Gu Jingyu but on the surface, she could only force herself to say, \u201cYes, of course. It\u2019ll be my treat.\u201dGu Jingyu laughed, \u201cForget it. Your salary is too low. If you treat me, you\u2019re going to end up eating grass. I\u2019m just joking with you, silly girl. You don\u2019t have to agree to everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che\u2019s face dropped. The reporter laughed along.The interview finally ended. Lin Che got down as Gu Jingyu patted her shoulder, and smiled as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re still such a newbie. Keep working hard!\u201dLin Che thought to herself silently,If it was not for your meddling, I might have done even better.However, Yu Minmin soon joined them. She smiled and said to Lin Che, \u201cNot a bad performance. Gu Jingyu really took care of you today, talking so much with you and even joking with you.\u201dLin Che asked, \u201cWas he not supposed to make jokes with me?\u201d\u201cOf course he\u2019s allowed to. However, Gu Jingyu has never been so lighthearted around a fellow actress. He\u2019s usually much better with men and he would completely ignore women. That\u2019s why people suspected that he was gay.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe very next day after the interview, Lin Che did not expect to find herself in the headlines with Gu Jingyu yet again.This time with Gu Jingyu\u2019s protection, the news had all praise for her.On the other side, Lin Li read the report about herself and became furious.There was a huge picture of Gu Jingyu and Lin Che while the picture of her covered only a small corner.She even went all out to wear an expensive, branded skirt so that she could be as dazzling as possible. However, Lin Che\u2019s name was so big now and the report only casually included a line mentioning that Lin Li was also starring in the show.That was it?Lin Li was hopping mad. From the table, she forcefully threw the newspaper onto the floor.Beside her, Han Caiying also did not expect things to turn out like that. She said, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? To think that Lin Che had this much power.\u201d Seeing how her daughter was compromised in the article, Han Caiying was also angry, \u201cLin Che must be deliberately outcasting you.\u201dLin Li\u2019s face was blood red with anger, \u201cLin Che\u2026 Just you wait. Hmph!\u201dMeanwhile, at the Gu residence, Lin Che suddenly sneezed.One of the maids hurriedly went over to her, \u201cMadam, what happened? Is the air-conditioning too cold?\u201d\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d Lin Che smiled as she got up with the newspaper in her hand. Gu Jingze had just returned home. Looking at him gleefully, she said, \u201cI\u2019m in the headlines for the show\u2019s promotions!\u201dGu Jingze saw her grinning widely. He walked over to her and took the newspaper only to see the picture of her and Gu Jingyu together.Lin Che continued, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when I get to be in the headlines.\u201dGu Jingze clenched the newspaper and quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is your first time.\u201dLin Che knew Gu Jingze was referring to the rumors previously, \u201cThat\u2019s completely different. That was a rumor. This time, it\u2019s because of my work. I\u2019m in the headlines now as an actress. Of course, it\u2019s different.\u201dGu Jingze lifted his head, \u201cIt looks like Jingyu took great care of you.\u201dUpon hearing Gu Jingze, Lin Che nodded profusely, \u201cYes, yes. Gu Jingyu took rather good care of me. Sister Yu told me that he\u2019s usually not this helpful. Who knew that he could actually be nice? Also, he was so skilled and experienced in handling interviews. No questions phased him. I never knew that he was not only good at acting, but also good at handling reporters. No wonder he\u2019s so famous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s face soon turned green.Lin Che did not notice and continued dancing around in excitement, admiration all over her face.Gu Jingze got up and threw the newspaper onto the table.\u201cHey, why did you throw my newspaper?\u201d Lin Che looked up unhappily.Gu Jingze stopped in his tracks and told the maid, \u201cFrom tomorrow, cancel the subscription of pointless entertainment news like this.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Che stood up, \u201cGu Jingze, why not?\u201dGu Jingze replied without turning, \u201cI don\u2019t like you being flirtatious.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face turned black, \u201cYou\u2026 Gu Jingze, you\u2019re biased. Acting is not flirtatious; it\u2019s an art! You know nothing about it!\u201dGu Jingze huffed and turned around. His dark pupils were prominent in his cold eyes. He said coolly, \u201cArt is also a form of selling your ****.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Che turned green, \u201cCapitalist, money grubber, short-tempered, uneducated, uncultured swine! Your whole body stinks of copper!\u201dThe corners of Gu Jingze\u2019s lips curled up. He laughed coldly and shot her down, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re eating and using my stinky copper.\u201dLin Che stood stunned as Gu Jingze called in Qin Hao with a wave of his hand.Gu Jingze said plainly, \u201cCollect all the entertainment news. Those disgusting rubbish papers mislead the youth. Keeping them around will only cause trouble. Once you\u2019re done, replace them with economic news!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d Qin Hao looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s stiff expression and then squinted at Lin Che before quietly retreating.Lin Che\u2019s fingers were shaking as she pointed at Gu Jingze, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re too overbearing!\u201dGu Jingze scoffed coldly. With big strides, he went in.Looking at Gu Jingze\u2019s cold back, Lin Che sat down angrily. Her nostrils flared as she looked at the newspaper that had been tossed on the floor.That damned Gu Jingze.He actually called her flirtatious and accused her of misleading the youth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euActors were indeed often misunderstood, especially by capitalists like him who believed that they were not doing anything meaningful.Yes, actors may be overhyped and she had been insulted by many people before.However, she did not expect Gu Jingze to think that way too.This guy was really rotten to the core!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was not going to let Gu Jingze in.She waited for a while but there was no sound.Quietly, she opened the door and heard Gu Jingze who appeared to be on the phone.\u201cHuiling, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dUpon hearing Mo Huiling\u2019s name, Lin Che grew curious and continued eavesdropping.Gu Jingze was holding his phone and listening to Mo Huiling whine.\u201cJingze, I quarreled with my family. I have nowhere to go now. Can you let me stay at your place for a few days?\u201dGu Jingze thought deeply, \u201cWhy did you quarrel with your family?\u201d\u201cIt was because of\u2026 Forget it. Anyway, I have no place to go now. My mother and father even confiscated my credit cards.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll arrange a place for you and go over to find you.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dGu Jingze stood there as he made some arrangements. He flexed his wrists and called Qin Hao, \u201cPrepare the villa at the bay. Huiling needs a place to stay. I\u2019m going over to her now.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d Qin Hao saw Gu Jingze\u2019s serious expression and dared not say another word.As he retreated, he caught a glimpse of Lin Che and could not help but sympathize with her. Gu Jingze\u2019s temper was really something that not everybody could handle.Lin Che watched Gu Jingze walk away. She lingered at the door and silently cursed at him. That damned, half-hearted Gu Jingze. He dared to meet another woman when he already had a wife.When she was done, her heart felt uncomfortable.Actually, Mo Huiling was his real love. Was it not assumed that the one not receiving love, was going to be the third party?She was the actual third party.Gu Jingze really left home and did not return that night.Lin Che vaguely heard Gu Jingze mention something about the villa at the bay and imagined him cuddling with Mo Huiling there.Meanwhile, at the villa at the bay.Mo Huiling put down her luggage and happily looked at Gu Jingze, \u201cThank you so much, Jingze. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I really wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dGu Jingze let the maid take in Mo Huiling\u2019s belongings while the two of them sat on the sofa.\u201cHuiling, what exactly happened at home?\u201dMo Huiling bit her lower lip, \u201cI\u2026 It\u2019s nothing big.\u201d She stared at the floor and looked pitiful, \u201cThey weren\u2019t approving of us being together all along. Now that they know you\u2019re married, they are trying to get me a boyfriend. I objected and we ended up arguing.\u201dGu Jingze gazed deeply at her as he crouched down beside her, \u201cHuiling\u2026\u201dShe had suffered because of him.Mo Huiling raised her head, \u201cI am not getting a boyfriend. I want to wait for you, Jingze. There\u2019s no happiness in marrying someone I don\u2019t love. I won\u2019t allow myself to suffer for the rest of my life\u2026\u201dShe was talking about herself but at the same time, she was reminding him that he was not with someone he loved and facing her daily.Gu Jingze frowned with unhappiness.However, looking at Mo Huiling, he decided to control his anger.Today, he was not in a good mood. He felt irritated and his heart burned.Even Mo Huiling could tell. From the beginning, Gu Jingze\u2019s expression had been as cold as ice and his eyes were like daggers. His mouth had curled downwards unhappily.However, Mo Huiling still felt rather happy.Perhaps he was not happy because of how her family treated her.She had always known he was a strong-willed person. She thought that he must have felt jealous.Mo Huiling slumped against him and looked at him, \u201cJingze, what am I supposed to do? My family will continue trying to force me. I don\u2019t even want to go back home anymore these days. Who knows what kind of guy they\u2019ll try to set me up with.\u201dGu Jingze turned to her and said plainly, \u201cYou can stay here as long as you want.\u201dMo Huiling tugged at him and said, \u201cAre you going to stay with me\u2026\u201dGu Jingze sighed and said without hesitation, \u201cHuiling, that won\u2019t be right. I\u2019m a married man.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s face fell, \u201cBut I\u2019m scared to be alone here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already delegated five maids here. There\u2019s a chef in the kitchen and my security guards. Everything is secured. I won\u2019t let anything happen here.

I don\u2019t feel safe.\u201dHowever, Gu Jingze sat there and didn\u2019t say a word.Mo Huiling grew frustrated and looked at him, \u201cOr you\u2019re thinking of going back to your pretty little wife. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to stay here?\u201dPretty little wife?Gu Jingze\u2019s brows knitted again and his eyes flickered. He looked at Mo Huiling, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll stay here.\u201dIt was not like he had not stayed outside his home before, but he had never stayed in the same room with her. Because of his illness, he could not have physical contact with her.Mo Huiling was exhilarated. She quickly called for supper to be prepared. Her beautiful face brightened up.Seeing how happy Mo Huiling was, Gu Jingze decided to go ahead and stay. He owed Mo Huiling too much. Thus, a small matter like this making Mo Huiling happy also alleviated some of his guilt.Later, they ate their supper and returned to their respective rooms. Gu Jingze was completely uninterested. Mo Huiling wanted to ask him over and see if she could make him stay in her room. However, he never gave her the opportunity to ask and retreated to his own room.Mo Huiling could only stomp her foot and go to her own room.Gu Jingze really did not return home the whole night.Lin Che went out to have her breakfast. There was only one plate of food on the table in the huge hall. She felt moody.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven though there was just one less person, and there were so many servants walking around obliviously, the house suddenly felt empty to her like something was missing.Soon enough, the company called and excitedly told her about an advertising job.

Lin Che walked while saying, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time as an endorsement model. I didn\u2019t think that I would ever take an advertisement job.\u201dYu Minmin smiled and looked at her. \u201cNow, you\u2019re someone with a piece of work. Also, now is your time to rise. Stop thinking that you\u2019re just a background actor. You\u2019re already an artist with some reputation, you understand?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cHehe, I\u2019m still just a little unaccustomed to it. I feel like everything happened so quickly. A few months ago, I had nothing at all.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cThis profession is precisely like that. You can get famous very quickly as long as you can seize the opportunity. However, you must be careful too. This is precisely the period when it\u2019s easiest to be suppressed. If something crops up time and you haven\u2019t begun to get famous, the company won\u2019t waste so much money on saving you. You still don\u2019t have social connections of your own, unlike artists who are already stable and can still gradually recover from mishaps. If anything happens during this period, there really won\u2019t be any way for you to stand up again, understand?\u201dYu Minmin spoke much more to Lin Che because she had slowly begun to feel that Lin Che was not that bad.She also hoped that Lin Che could last a long time and become more and more popular.Hearing this, Lin Che nodded her head solemnly. \u201cI understand.\u201dFollowing this, the process of signing the endorsement contract was very smooth. It was only when Lin Che walked out that she coincidentally saw Senmira, a currently famous film star. Outside, a line of people glared at Lin Che and Yu Minmin when they saw them coming out as if they were burning with rage.Senmira had also just gotten popular in the past two years and her company was vigorously promoting her. However, the two of them had never crossed paths at all, so Lin Che was a little confused. Yu Minmin pulled her along to leave this place.Yu Minmin said, \u201cIgnore her. This advertisement was initially hers actually, but the endorsement company changed it to you at the last minute. That\u2019s why she\u2019s in a fit of anger.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThat means that I robbed her of her advertisement?\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cUh, that\u2019s technically the case\u2026 but in this profession, there\u2019s no such thing as stealing roles. You can say that only true capability speaks. The endorsement company took a fancy to your potential to grow; that\u2019s why they chose an artist who\u2019s rising.\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201dThat night, Lin Che followed Yu Minmin to dine together with the advertisers. It was necessary to acknowledge their approval of her.In the car, Lin Che called Yu Minmin and asked her where they were to meet.Yu Minmin said, \u201cYou go in first. It\u2019s Room 302. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201dYu Minmin was still in the midst of a traffic jam and was presently anxious. She put down the phone and looked in front again. Images of Gu Jingming on a state visit were playing on a large screen. She could not help but stare blankly.Gu Jingming stood upright, dressed in a suit. On the screen, he appeared very good-natured, but his expression concealed a sternness. Yu Minmin recalled the popular opinion of many towards Gu Jingming; they said that he was an iron-handed president who was adept in dealing with both external and internal political relations of the nation, so he was rooted deeply in the hearts of the people.She spaced out momentarily but when she regained her senses, she collided head-on with the car in front of hers\u2026 she had caused a rear-ended collision\u2026\u201cDamn it,\u201d Yu Minmin cursed angrily before quickly getting out of the car.Outside the meeting place, Lin Che made numerous calls to Yu Minmin, but she did not answer.Left with no choice, Lin Che could only enter the private room, the number that Yu Minmin had told her, on her own.However, when she opened the door to the room, she immediately saw the people inside staggering from side to side. They were either lying down or standing crookedly, and all of them looked very strange. However, it was obvious that they were not the people Lin Che was to meet tonight\u2026Lin Che was instantly dumbfounded. She turned around and was about to leave but someone inside gripped her wrist forcefully\u2026Outside, in the corridor that no one saw, Senmira was holding her phone with a bit of a sly smile at the corners of her lips. She said into the phone, \u201cI\u2019ve arrived, Lin Li. Thanks for telling me that she\u2019s here. Tonight\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely make it so that she can\u2019t leave.\u201dBefore Lin Che managed to react, she heard the police barging in already.\u201cAll of you, freeze. Put down the drugs that are in your hands and stand against the wall, one by one.\u201dDrugs?Lin Che began to look around carefully. When she looked at the strange objects all over the room and those bizarre people, she finally understood. A chill slowly began to spread from the bottom of her heart.If an artist got involved with drugs, what did he or she face?It was not like there were no examples before her\u2026Gu Jingze was presently in his office. Mo Huiling\u2019s sudden call inevitably interrupted his work once again.He felt a little resentful. Over the past few days, Mo Huiling had been chasing after him relentlessly. She had already been a huge disturbance to his work.Mo Huiling said, \u201cJingze, you\u2019re still not coming over to sleep tonight?\u201dAfter the first day that he stayed there, he felt slightly unwell, so on the second day, he made an excuse that he was busy with work and did not go over again.But then, Mo Huiling began to call relentlessly to ask him about his work matters, making it slightly difficult for him to fend her off.\u201cI\u2019m still a bit busy. Huiling, if you feel bored, I can get Qin Hao to send a car over to pick you up. You can go shopping; I\u2019ve already instructed someone to leave the card for your use. Otherwise, you can go overseas to shop around. You can take the Gu family\u2019s airplane that\u2019s always available at home and fly over.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t want that. Jingze, what happened? Have you gotten sick of me? Did I cling onto you too tightly? Are you trying to chase me away?\u201dGu Jingze massaged his brow. \u201cNo, you\u2019re thinking too much.\u201dQin Hao was still waiting at the side with his hands hanging by his sides. Gu Jingze waved at him and gestured for him to wait for a moment. He said to Mo Huiling over the phone, \u201cI\u2019m going out of town on an official business for a few days. Be obedient, Huiling. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s spirits were slightly dampened. Hearing him say this, she could only say, \u201cAlright then. I\u2019m hanging up. Love you, Jingze.\u201dMo Huiling could not press him too much either. She was deeply afraid that Gu Jingze would be disgusted with her at this important time now. However, she could not be too far away from him either. Otherwise, Gu Jingze would definitely get together with that little bitch. This worried Mo Huiling immensely too.She could only put down the phone and think viciously about what she should do to own him completely\u2026Gu Jingze was really going overseas.From the side, Qin Hao saw Gu Jingze put down the phone and say, \u201cSir, the airplane at the private airport has already been prepared. They are currently arranging the time for takeoff with the National Flight Division. The plane can probably take off in about half an hour. Would you like to go to the airport now?\u201d\u201cAlright. Make some preparations and we\u2019ll head to the airport.\u201dGu Jingze stood up and left.Qin Hao recalled Lin Che\u2019s matter. He thought that Gu Jingze had ignored Lin Che for quite a few days.\u201cSir, do we need to inform Madam?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dLin Che?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA few days had passed, but she had not called even once.She was really doing her job and fulfilling her responsibilities as a contractual wife.Meanwhile\u2026At the Special Police Department, Lin Che was being interrogated at the Special Department because she was an artist.\u201cJust confess, Lin Che. You\u2019re definitely no artist here and now. You\u2019re a criminal. This trick won\u2019t work on us.\u201d The investigating officer looked at Lin Che scornfully. He hated these artists the most; although they acted and looked high and mighty, they were all lowly rascals.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She stated countless times that those drug deals had nothing to do with her at all.Lin Che said, \u201cCan I call my manager?\u201dThe police officer snorted. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen can I call my family?\u201d\u201cNo to that too. I\u2019ll let you make a call only after you confess.\u201dLin Che said indignantly, \u201cWhat gives you that right?\u201dThe police officer said, \u201cThis is a special case. You brought it upon yourself since you\u2019re a celebrity.\u201dFrom outside, a few police officers were watching the situation inside.\u201cThis person probably just started to get popular. I\u2019ve never seen her before.\u201d\u201cYes. She\u2019s just a small celebrity without any background or backing. Otherwise, why would she be in this terrible situation?\u201d\u201cServes her right. Why would she get involved in some drug deal? Even if you have no background or backing, you can\u2019t demean yourself like this.\u201d\u201cShe probably had no other way to get popular.\u201d\u201cBut she\u2019s really quite beautiful. Eh, is it alright to lock her up like this?\u201d\u201cRelax. How can a small celebrity like her overturn the heavens? Even if she gets whatever she wants outside, once she\u2019s here, she\u2019s just another criminal. She has to obey us.\u201dAfter an unknowingly long time, the police officer saw that he really could not elicit any information from her. Thus, he said that she could go out to make a call.Lin Che picked up her phone and called Yu Minmin first. But unexpectedly, Yu Minmin still did not pick up.Left with no choice, she thought it over and flipped through her phonebook. When she saw Gu Jingze\u2019s number, she pondered for a bit before proceeding to call him.\u201cBeep, beep, beep. The number you have just called is temporarily unavailable.\u201d Even he had switched off his phone too\u2026Lin Che was at her wit\u2019s end. The police officer behind her hastened her impatiently. \u201cQuickly make your calls. Are you going to call or not? If no one is picking up, then go back.\u201dLin Che had no choice. As she flipped through her phonebook, she decided to just stop calling altogether. \u201cForget it. I have no one else I want to contact.\u201dEven if she was going to die, she still did not want to contact the Lin family. Aside from these people, she did not have anyone else to call.Inside, Lin Che sat inside feeling slightly hopeless. She just felt that her entire body was unwell. She had not slept for a night and felt completely dizzy and groggy. The room was humid and gave her the chills. She could not help but lean against the side to take a rest. However, she felt that the chair and the wall were all ice-cold.And on the other side.Qin Hao stood at a side and said to Gu Jingze, \u201cSir, the airplane has already commenced landing. Right now, we\u2019re in H Nation. There will be a team to receive us soon, so it\u2019s time for you to change your clothes.\u201dGu Jingze nodded before heading to the changing room to change his clothes. He had flown for five hours and worked the entire time on the plane. But once something cropped up, he could still perk up immediately as if he had slept that entire time.The airplane landed in no time. He turned on his cellphone but instantly picked up a call from Mo Huiling.\u201cJingze, hehe. I have a surprise for you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gu Jingze asked in a confused tone.\u201cI\u2019m in H Nation.\u201dGu Jingze was momentarily stunned. He had not quite expected this.He drew in a deep breath and could only say to her, \u201cAlright, wait outside for me. H Nation\u2019s ****** team is here to receive me. I\u2019ll be busy for some time before I can go look for you.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Mo Huiling pursed her lips and her voice sank. She was obviously a little unhappy.Gu Jingze put down his phone, only to see a notification on the screen, indicating that he had missed another call the night before.It was a call from Lin Che.His entire body jolted and he immediately called her back with his phone.At his side, Qin Hao was slightly anxious. While looking outside, he said to Gu Jingze, \u201cSir\u2026\u201dGu Jingze stretched out a hand and stopped Qin Hao from speaking.The call got through in no time. However, the person on the other end was not Lin Che. Instead, it was an unfamiliar male voice.\u201cWho is this? This is the police station.\u201d The person on the other end was very impatient.\u201cWhere\u2019s Lin Che?\u201d He asked, frowning.\u201cLin Che? She\u2019s locked up. What\u2019s your relationship with her?\u201dLocked up? A dim light flashed in Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes.He put down the phone and suddenly said to Qin Hao, \u201cCancel today\u2019s schedule for the time being. Coordinate with the airline company and tell them we\u2019re going back now.\u201dQin Hao flinched. But when he looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s solemn expression, he could only swallow his words that were going to contradict him.*\u201cLin Che, someone came to bail you out.\u201d At this moment, she unexpectedly heard a police officer\u2019s voice traveling from outside.Lin Che did not think that there would be another turn of events. But when she walked out, she immediately saw that the person standing at the entrance\u2026 was Qin Qing.Lin Che\u2019s heart warmed instantly and she looked at him in pleasant surprise.\u201cQin Qing, why are you here?\u201dAs Qin Qing looked at Lin Che\u2019s pale face, his heart immediately ached.She looked like she was doing poorly; she looked haggard and restless, and her lips were as white as snow.\u201cThe police called the Lin family and said that you\u2019d been locked up. I was worried about you, so I came over to take a look.\u201d Qin Qing held her up. Seeing that she was very weak, he simply slung her arm over his shoulder and carefully supported her as they walked out.\u201cThank you, Qin Qing.\u201d Lin Che thought,It was likely that the police really saw no other way, so they called her nominal family, the Lin family. In the end, the Lin family did not want to bother with her at all, so the person who came instead was Qin Qing.Qin Qing said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. You look really unwell. I\u2019ll take you home first. Where do you live?\u201dLin Che could not say that she was living in the Gu mansion. Furthermore, in her current state, she did not want to go back either. She shook her head and said, \u201cJust send me to a hotel.\u201dQin Qing said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my house instead. The hotel is too chaotic; there are reporters everywhere outside.Lin Che\u2019s eyes paused\u2026She had known Qin Qing since they were young, so she had gone to the Qin residence quite often. At this moment, she put down her pretense and nodded, intentionally neglecting his statement that there were reporters everywhere outside. She was in no mood to bother with those reporters.However, when they arrived at the parking lot, both Lin Li and Han Caiying immediately rushed over from the opposite side.\u201cLin Che, what are you doing?!\u201d When Lin Li saw Lin Che physically held up by Qin Qing, she turned completely green in the face.Han Caiying looked at Lin Che venomously as well. Sure enough, this little lass was still thinking of Qin Qing until now. She even dared to call Qin Qing; she was really asking for death.Lin Li walked over in a few steps and pushed Lin Che aside.Lin Che had already been tormented for one night and was thoroughly exhausted. Upon being pushed by Lin Li, she fell to the ground immediately.Shocked, Qin Qing raised his head and yelled recklessly at Lin Li, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHe quickly bent down to pick Lin Che up. \u201cLin Che, are you alright?\u201dLin Che shook her head. She lifted her head and sneered as she looked at Lin Li.Seeing that Qin Qing was so worried for Lin Che, Lin Li pointed at Lin Che even more angrily. \u201cLin Che, what exactly are you trying to do? Don\u2019t you already have some powerful man sponsoring you? What happened now? You\u2019ve been tossed aside, so you eagerly came to look for Qin Qing? How can you be so despicable and shameless?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLin Li, that\u2019s enough. What nonsense are you spouting?\u201d Qin Qing sternly interrupted Lin Li\u2019s tirade.Lin Li looked at Qin Qing in a craze. \u201cQin Qing, you\u2019re still defending her? I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e! But you\u2019re protecting her like this now! I\u2019m not just spouting nonsense! I\u2019m about to go crazy because I\u2019m angry at you! That\u2019s why I\u2019m spouting nonsense!\u201dBehind her, Han Caiying hurriedly pulled her daughter towards her. She was worried that she would be unable to control herself due to her anger and offend Qin Qing.She glared at Lin Che maliciously and said, \u201cLin Che, this is where you were wrong. You can do anything, but you had to get involved with drugs. You\u2019re really too much; everyone can understand that you want to get famous, but how can you do such an ugly thing to get famous? What you\u2019ve done is illegal and as a person, you shouldn\u2019t stoop that low. No matter what, you\u2019re still a member of the Lin family. Now that you\u2019ve done this, the Lin family will also consequently lose face. You\u2019re really thoughtless.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Nobody knows that I belong to the Lin family. Even if I cause a scene, it\u2019s only on me. You can think whatever you want but as I\u2019ve said, I didn\u2019t do anything. If there\u2019s nothing else, please step aside. I need to leave.\u201dQin Qing unhappily raised his head, looking at the mother and daughter before pulling Lin Che over.Only then did he realize how skinny Lin Che was. It was as if her arm could break any time.He helped her up as she struggled to stand. Suddenly, she felt her body go cold and her legs were trembling.Han Caiying watched the way Qin Qing treated Lin Che and her expression changed. She stopped Lin Li as she did not want Qin Qing to be unhappy with her. But as a mother, she had to do something.She got up and snatched Qin Qing\u2019s hand away, looking at Lin Che, \u201cLin Che, what\u2019s the meaning of this? You think you\u2019re a little star now so you can climb all over Qin Qing? You\u2019re too much. The Third Younger Master of the Qin family is not within your reach.\u201dShe turned to Qin Qing, \u201cQin Qing, she is completely devious. She had always harbored bad intentions towards you from the beginning. You not only didn\u2019t see through her; you even helped her! Oh, how you have let down our Lin Li!\u201dQin Qing gritted his teeth and looked at Han Caiying. He was glad Lin Li was different from her mother.Qin Qing held Lin Che and walked forward. He did not want to listen to Han Caiying anymore. As they stumbled together, Lin Che was still in a daze and her legs were weak.Seeing how Qin Qing ignored her, Han Caiying angrily walked in front of them and stopped them. She pulled back Lin Che and with a loud smack, slapped Lin Che\u2019s face.Just then\u2026A few cars had suddenly stopped outside at the entrance.Inside, not knowing how the police chief got the news, everyone went out of the station.Lin Li and Han Caiying stood frozen, staring strangely at the neat row of black cars.A black Bentley was parked right in the middle.The door opened. A pair of high-quality handmade leather shoes nimbly touched the ground.A long, slender silhouette followed. Gu Jingze was wearing a grey top and dark blue pants, standing upright on the stoned path. A pair of black eyes, dark and mysterious, adorned his perfect face. He brought about an air of charm as he stepped out of his car. His gaze fell on Qin Qing\u2019s hand which was holding tightly onto Lin Che. Unhappiness swept across his ashen face, sinister and ready to devour anything in his way. Although subtle, it was enough to send chills down anyone\u2019s spine.Men behind him formed a row at his sides. Two huge security guards with earpieces flanked him. Qin Hao meekly followed behind. This scene left Lin Li and Han Caiying in a daze.The police officers rushed over to greet him with a smile, not quite daring to go near him. They said softly, \u201cMr. Gu, we did not expect you to be here. We did not prepare a proper welcome for you.\u201dGu Jingze only had eyes for Lin Che, whose face had gone white. With long strides, he walked over.Seeing the tall Gu Jingze approach, Qin Qing tightened his grip on Lin Che.Qin Qing was subconsciously nervous, but he refused to let go of Lin Che and firmly stood his ground.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes were cold and a strong sense of oppression came over them.Lin Che raised her head, refusing to appear weak in front of Gu Jingze. However, that made her all the more pitiful.Gu Jingze grabbed Lin Che\u2019s arm and his eyes fell on Qin Qing\u2019s hand.Qin Qing clenched his teeth and did not want to budge. But when he felt the pressure, he slowly released his grip.In one effortless movement, Gu Jingze lifted her into his arms.Lin Che felt compromised. She could breathe in his scent. However, she felt a sense of security when he swept her up in his arms.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes were like those of a predator, sweeping across Qin Qing. His tall body towered over the latter.\u201cGu Jingze, I\u2026\u201d Lin Che\u2019s slender arm hung around his neck as she was about to speak. However, Gu Jingze stopped her coldly, \u201cShut up.\u201dLin Che froze. She bit her lip as she looked at him and swallowed her words.Gu Jingze was obviously in a bad mood as he glared at her hatefully.If she had no strength, she should just patiently rest and not try to spew nonsense.The police felt the chilly atmosphere as they watched Gu Jingze carry Lin Che coldly. They looked around and tried to figure out who captured this woman here. It was going to be difficult to not offend Gu Jingze, so the Gu family had suddenly called up and prepared for them to let the culprits go.The police officer who had just been interrogated was shaken and dared not go over. The contempt he had earlier had been replaced with fear.Lin Li and Han Caiying stood there together and stared.Lin Li thought angrily,That damned Lin Che. How could she get that kind of man to protect her like that?Watching the tall, mighty, and charming Gu Jingze carry Lin Che who was like a little lamb, he looked very handsome. It was enough to make every woman envy her.Every woman wished to be carried by a charming man like that. It was so sexy.Lin Li was secretly cursing,This Lin Che. How did she get so lucky?Qin Qing who was watching felt uneasiness in his heart. He wanted to follow but a guard in black stopped him, swiftly blocking his path and separating him from the couple. He could not go closer.Qin Qing grew hatred towards himself as he felt like Gu Jingze and he were like Heaven and Earth. He could not even get close to Gu Jingze physically.Seeing them leave, the high and mighty officers immediately bowed their heads and followed behind. Han Caiying huffed, \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this? Coming here to show off in front of us?\u201dLin Li glared and sulked, \u201cThis Gu Jingze is some guy.\u201dHowever, it was undeniable. The difference was obvious between the powerful and the weak.Qin Qing took a deep breath, \u201cThere is indeed no match for the Gu family in this country. One is at the top in politics and another is a giant in business.\u201dLin Li heard and her face turned red like a tomato.

It must have certainly made her weak until now.Gu Jingze carried her back home and put her down on the bed. His eyes grew darker as he looked at her chapped lips and slight frown.Damned woman\u2026 always getting herself into trouble.He reached his hand out and brushed her forehead lightly.Feeling slightly better, her frown dissipated.Just as Gu Jingze was about to walk away, he felt her hand faintly grabbing his finger. He looked deeply at her pale face and decided to stay. Her teeth chattered, indicating that she was cold. He placed the back of his hand on her forehead. It was boiling hot. He thought for a while before lifting the blanket and laying beside her.He remembered how he had a high fever when he was a child. His whole body was hot and cold, and his hands and feet were like ice. His mother would do the same, holding his limbs until they warmed up and his fever subsided.He hugged her tightly and held her close in his embrace.He reached out for the bell at the bedside and called for a maid.\u201cCall for Chen Yucheng.\u201dDoctor Chen soon arrived.The maid said, \u201cMadam must have fallen sick.\u201dChen Yucheng muttered, \u201cSince when did he let me see other patients?\u201dHe was an internationally-renowned doctor. He was later found by the Gu family. During his research, he was only allowed to be Gu Jingze\u2019s personal doctor. For many years, if there was no research needed, he did not see anyone else.Chen Yucheng opened the door to see Gu Jingze lying on his bed. In his arms, a girl was silently curled up just like a kitten.\u201cSorry, sorry. I didn\u2019t know you guys were\u2026\u201d Chen Yucheng hastily closed the door.Inside, Gu Jingze\u2019s face was dark.\u201cCome in,\u201d he called at the door.Chen Yucheng thought about it,That was not it. They appeared to be fully clothed.Thus, when he heard Gu Jingze call for him, he opened the door again.Gu Jingze looked carefully at the girl in his arms and said, \u201cFor some reason, she got a fever.\u201dAfter just one night at the police station, she fainted upon returning home. He did not know what happened to her.Chen Yucheng saw how serious Gu Jingze was and quickly went over to take a look.After checking, Chen Yucheng said helplessly, \u201cMr. Gu. Your wife has the common cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze asked, \u201cJust a cold?\u201d\u201cIndeed. A fever, a blocked air passage, and an inflamed throat. These are obvious symptoms of the common cold.\u201dGu Jingze relaxed a little and replied, \u201cYou may go.\u201dChen Yucheng was speechless. He was urgently called over. But after he found that it was just a cold, he was being chased out?\u201cSir, there are many general practitioners around. Maybe you can call them next time.\u201dGu Jingze was silent. His gaze was still fixated on Lin Che and he said plainly, \u201cYes. I feel like I haven\u2019t had a problem for many years now. Yet there\u2019s no results from the research. I\u2019m much better these days but that doesn\u2019t seem to be because of you. I\u2019ll just get a general practitioner next time. You don\u2019t have to come anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yucheng quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019m just joking. General practitioners are not as knowledgeable. The missus falling sick is a serious matter. You were right to call me over.\u201dGu Jingze raised his head to glance at him before signaling him to leave.Chen Yucheng immediately left.Although Gu Jingze heard that it was just the cold, he could not relax. He continued hugging her closely and keeping her hands and feet warm.Lin Che could only feel her cold body as if she was still at the police station, suffering helplessly.She felt herself getting pulled up. Someone was silently grasping her hand and helping her up.Suddenly, she recalled that she seemed to have been standing beside Qin Qing. She opened her mouth with all her might, trying to speak. However, she could only let out faintly, \u201cQin Qing\u2026\u201dGu Jingze was stunned at first. He moved closer to her lips and listened carefully.She groggily repeated the name. It was indeed Qin Qing\u2026Gu Jingze immediately let go of her, standing up and staring at the woman in his bed.\u201cQin\u2026\u201d she said again softly. Gu Jingze lifted the blanket.\u201cLin Che, wake up. Get a hold of yourself. Who am I?\u201d he forcefully pulled Lin Che out of the bed, his black eyes glistening with anger.Lin Che opened her eyes, still in a daze. Upon seeing a face filled with rage, she slowly woke up.It was Gu Jingze.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d she was surprised to know that he came.She could not get through to his phone. How did he know what happened to her?Gu Jingze rolled his eyes and smiled coldly, \u201cWhy? Are you upset to see me instead of your darling Qin Qing?\u201dLin Che was shocked. Noticing the hatred burning in his eyes, she remembered how he said she was misleading the youths and was a fake.He was still holding her shoulders. He looked cold and his face was distant.She pushed his hands away.\u201cLet go of me. What are you doing?\u201dShe had dared to push him?Gu Jingze was pushed aside but he grabbed her wrist, \u201cWhy? You feel disgusted that it\u2019s me who is touching you and not Qin Qing? That\u2019s too bad. Qin Qing is already someone else\u2019s fianc\u00e9. You have a crush on him but he doesn\u2019t even know. Lin Che, just give up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Che was exasperated upon listening to his sharp words.With more strength, she tried to pry away his hand, \u201cLet me go, Gu Jingze. Let me go now. I\u2019m just a fake. Don\u2019t dirty your hand by touching me.\u201dGu Jingze was enraged. Looking at her struggle, his eyes glistened. With both hands, he grabbed hold of her shoulders and pushed her down.Both of them landed on the soft bed, his body pressing on top of her and engulfing her with his masculinity.Lin Che screamed, \u201cGu Jingze, go away. You\u2019re a\u2026 fool, a bastard. Let go of me!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe could spend all day trying to find a good word that could really insult him.Although she was weak, she struggled with all she had. She was clearly powerless against him but she still tried to push him away like a cotton ball hitting uselessly at his chest. He did not even flinch.Gu Jingze was swayed by her.Lin Che realized how amazing his strength was. No matter what she did, he was as sturdy as a rock and refused to budge. Annoyed, she lifted her knee and aimed directly downwards\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He swiftly grabbed ahold of her knee with one hand.Lin Che\u2019s mind turned blank. She lifted her head and fixed her eyes on his jet-black ones.Gu Jingze did not think that she would actually still dare to make such a move. He immediately broke into a sneer. \u201cWow, Lin Che. Are you trying to murder your husband?\u201dLin Che\u2019s face turned completely red. The thought of touching him there had not occurred to her, but it was only because she did not have a choice so\u2026His hand was clutching her round knee. His large hand chafed roughly against her soft and tender skin. With her face flushed red, she yelled at him, \u201cGu Jingze, what are you trying to do?!\u201dGu Jingze looked at her pressed down under his body. The area below his eyes turned red instantly; a lustful surge of blood was slowly rising. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?\u201dOf course, Lin Che did not believe that he would do anything to her; obviously, he had a woman that he liked. Also, didn\u2019t he say that he was allergic to women?She pulled her leg a few times in different ways. \u201cIf you continue to hold onto me, you better watch out. I won\u2019t be so easy on you.\u201dGu Jingze broke into a smile. He gazed at her chest, which was heaving up and down vigorously out of anger. \u201cI indeed want to see how you\u2019ll not go easy on me.\u201dLin Che yelled, \u201cGu Jingze, is this enjoyable for you?!\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cWhy? If doing this with me isn\u2019t enjoyable, then who do you enjoy doing this with? Qin Qing?\u201dLin Che was so angered by him that even her liver was hurting. \u201cYes! With Qin Qing, it\u2019s enjoyable!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze hand unknowingly clenched tighter. Lin Che just felt a sudden pain in her elbow and she looked at Gu Jingze with a sour sting in her nose.\u201cLet go of me, Gu Jingze. No one bullies people like this.\u201d\u201cBully? I see you still don\u2019t know what bullying is.\u201d As Gu Jingze said this, he pressed her down heavily under his body. His hand smoothed along her clothing before lifting it and sneaking in.Her chest was sensitive and hurt instantly. When his hand held it, her entire body turned tense and stiff. It was as if a jolt of electricity had passed through it. She almost let out a slight whine.She quickly pinned down his restless hand and glared at him furiously. \u201cYou\u2026 Gu Jingze\u2026 you\u2019re behaving like a hooligan!\u201dGu Jingze only felt that in his hand, it was excellent to the touch. For a moment, he actually felt reluctant to release it.Glaring at the woman under him, he gritted his teeth in anger. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t go around stirring up trouble again!\u201dAfter saying this, his hand squeezed hard again.Unable to bear it, Lin Che let out a sound.Hearing this, Gu Jingze\u2019s heart clenched immediately as well. His sensual eyes were fixed tightly on her face, which was glistening with a thin layer of sweat. Her clothes were once again pushed up high, exposing her navel to the light. Her abdomen did not have an ounce of excess flesh and looked extremely inviting.Lin Che bit her lip. She narrowed her eyes at the man in front of her who stood high above the masses like a king.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll definitely stir up trouble. In that case, go look for a woman who won\u2019t make trouble for you!\u201dMo Huiling would not make trouble for him, so he should go look for her instead.He did not dare to look for Mo Huiling or bear to bully Mo Huiling; he only knew to bully her.Lin Che knew that she was not good enough and was always making trouble. However, she did not want this to happen either.She just didn\u2019t have enough good luck, so she always encountered these troublesome matters.Including this man before her eyes, he was also, along with the others, one of her problems. Currently, she felt even more strongly that he was virtually her greatest problem.The man\u2019s hand squeezed once again and Lin Che nearly cried out in alarm.Lin Che who had never had any experience with men, only felt shy and bashful. But at the bottom of her heart, there was also a small, vague sliver of comfortable anticipation. It was only because he was really too sensual like this that it made her heat up to the point of complete agitation.\u201cSay that again!\u201d The man\u2019s voice started becoming lower and huskier. His voice sounded like it was naturally gifted with charm and resonated in her ears.Lin Che was already feeling stifled as she was tightly pinned down by him. Currently, she was so angered by him that she felt even more agitated. She yelled directly, \u201cIf you want to kill me or cut off my flesh, do as you wish. Since you dislike that I keep making trouble, then go look for another woman!\u201d\u201cWhat? I went to look for you but you\u2019re still giving me the cold shoulder? If I didn\u2019t go, would you and Qin Qing be cooing at each other right now?\u201d\u201cOf course! I\u2026 It wasn\u2019t easy for me to get a chance to look delicate and pitiful in front of Qin Qing for once. But it was completely ruined by you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re asking for death!\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s face turned completely red as he glared at this damn woman.\u201cWhy, what else can you do to me?!\u201d Lin Che shrieked.Gu Jingze exerted a force with his hand and her clothes were suddenly ripped open.Lin Che only felt an instant chill on her body\u2026In the next moment, his body encased hers. He held her hateful lips between his teeth and bit down on them forcefully as if he was punishing her\u2026\u201cOo\u2026\u201d Lin Che let out a stifled groan.Lin Che felt that Gu Jingze was simply an oppressive tyrant.It hurt so much that her tears began to fall, spattering drop by drop beside her ears.She felt more aggrieved than any other emotion.Physically and mentally, it was all too difficult for her to bear and she felt so vulnerable.She was still inflicted with the severe flu, so her body was ridiculously weak.She did not even have an ounce of energy to resist a man who was bullying her.The shivers on his tongue gave him an incomparable feeling.Gu Jingze ravished her lips hazily and greedily sucked in all of her breath.He only felt his body shudder uncontrollably. But in the next moment, when he was just about to completely lose control, his hand came into contact with her tears.Immediately, he released this woman. He lowered his head and looked at Lin Che.Her tear-stained cheeks looked especially delicate, making him feel bad from the bottom of his heart as if needles were pricking at it.Immediately, Gu Jingze\u2019s heart completely softened. He saw that she was crying, but he felt slightly at a loss.He had never been able to deal with a woman\u2019s tears. He quickly tugged at Lin Che\u2019s arm and said, \u201cAlright, stop crying. Are you hurt somewhere?\u201dHe hugged Lin Che and sat up with his arms wrapped around her. He brought her up to sit on his legs and lowered his head. At a slight loss as to what to do, he picked up his handkerchief to wipe off the tears on her face.Lin Che muttered angrily, \u201cYou only know to bully me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s heart clenched. He bitterly felt the scorching heat from his body; it was difficult to tolerate, but impossible to relieve.Who exactly was bullying who?\u201cFine, fine, it was my fault.\u201d\u201cMy clothes are torn.\u201d She lowered her head and covered her own chest.He looked at it and felt his body heat up again. He lowered his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ll compensate you for it.\u201d\u201cOne isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you a hundred pieces.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d As Lin Che said this, she felt even more sleepy; it was as if she had just taken medication and the effects were manifesting now.She yawned before leaning against his shoulder, her mind feeling cloudy and groggy.Gu Jingze embraced her and let her sleep leaning against him. He touched her hands and feet; they were no longer ice-cold. It seemed that her fever was subsiding.\u201cGo to sleep. You\u2019ll be fine when you wake up.\u201d He frowned and felt like he was coaxing a little child.\u201cYou can\u2019t bully me again,\u201d Lin Che was still mumbling even though she was about to fall asleep.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes\u2026\u201d If he bullied her again a few more times, he reckoned that he would first die by her hands.It was only when he sensed that she seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep that he slowly placed her down.He covered her with the blanket and gnashed his teeth together as he looked at this woman who was like a baby in a fitful slumber.Truly, she was an angel when she was asleep and a devil when she was awake; it made him grind his teeth with hatred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes were swirling; they resembled a rippling stream.His sensual, thin lips curled slightly at a perfect angle.He scooped up Lin Che\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into his embrace as if he was looking at the love of his life.His voice was so sensual and perfect as well as he spoke gently to her, \u201cLin Che, I love you\u2026\u201dLin Che was so shocked that her heart was pounding. In the next moment, she saw Gu Jingze\u2019s lips pressing downwards.Lin Che hastily moved upwards and closer to him.However, at this moment\u2026Her phone suddenly started ringing.Lin Che was rudely awakened. She suddenly sat up and only then did she sense that she was actually dreaming earlier.F***, why would she have such a dream\u2026Lin Che quickly smoothed her hair. She heard her phone still ringing for all it was worth before she grabbed it and picked it up.Yu Minmin was calling.\u201cWhat happened to you? Why are you suddenly on the news for being involved with drugs?\u201dLin Che had yet to see the news so of course, she did not know what the outside world was saying. She just held her slightly-hurting head and said to her, \u201cI was framed!\u201dYu Minmin was immersed in her thoughts for some time before saying, \u201cForget it. We\u2019ll discuss this again when you come to the company.\u201d\u201cAlright. But Sister Yu, I couldn\u2019t contact you yesterday? Where did you go?\u201dYu Minmin turned silent again. Finally, for the lack of a better way to put it, she could only say, \u201cI was in a car accident yesterday.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che said, \u201cHow could you be so unlucky? Should we go up the mountain to pray?\u201d\u201cI think we should too. Anyway, we\u2019ll discuss this again when you come to the company.\u201dLin Che quickly got up. Although she still felt a little dizzy, she continued to swiftly wash up and put her clothes on.The moment she opened the bedroom door, she coincidentally saw Gu Jingze coming in from outside.Immediately, Gu Jingze saw Lin Che and his brow furrowed deeply.The events of the previous night came to his mind immediately. He tilted his face slightly and said, \u201cWhy did you get out of bed?\u201dIn a hurry, Lin Che said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the company.\u201d\u201cThe company?\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened. \u201cWhy are you going to the company so early?\u201d\u201cSomething cropped up. I have to go deal with it,\u201d Lin Che said.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to go.\u201d Gu Jingze held Lin Che back when she was about to run out.Lin Che turned her head in suspicion. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to go.\u201d He swept his eyes over her face that was still flushed red from her illness. \u201cJust stay at home obediently today.\u201dStay at home obediently?Again, Lin Che recalled what he had said yesterday about why she was always stirring up trouble.He definitely felt that she would stir up trouble if she went out.Lin Che said, \u201cNo way. I have to go to the company and settle this matter. If I don\u2019t deal with this matter properly, then my career will be over.\u201d\u201cYour life career could just be about being Mrs. Gu.\u201d Gu Jingze looked at this stubborn woman with a cold expression.Lin Che said, \u201cCome on. Once we divorce, I\u2019ll be your scorned ex-wife. It\u2019s still better for me to have my own career. I\u2019m going out first.\u201d\u201cLin Che! I said that you\u2019re not allowed to go!\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s tone became more severe and a dim light flashed in his eyes.Lin Che turned her head back. \u201cI already know. This time I\u2019m not going to stir up trouble. I won\u2019t make trouble for you. I\u2019m going to deal with some matters, so you don\u2019t have to worry about something happening to me again.\u201dGu Jingze lowered his eyes. Even after she lowered her head and wore her shoes properly, the wrinkles in his brow were still present.\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she looked back and said to him again, slightly fearfully.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d Gu Jingze turned back and hastened into the bedroom.Lin Che\u2019s lips twitched. She saw that he seemed angry but after some thought, she did not go after him.She recalled everything that happened last night. Although a portion of her memories was blurry because she was sleepy and groggy, she could still remember how he had explored her lips and how his hands had recklessly touched her body\u2026Instantly, her lips heated up slightly. She frantically shook her head to shake off that feeling of anticipation and walked out in a hurry.At the company.Yu Minmin held her forehead and said, \u201cIt looks like this incident is likely Senmira\u2019s doing. Your endorsement deal was canceled and she signed a new contract with that company again.\u201dLin Che looked at the news. She only saw now that there was no explicit mention of her. The news only said that there was speculation that there was a celebrity who had recently been involved with drugs who had already been put behind bars. It was a female celebrity whose name started with the letter \u2018L\u2019. She had just begun to get famous through a television series. If the incident this time was real, then there was going to be a problem as to whether the television series could even be broadcasted according to the schedule.The netizens were strikingly intelligent; they immediately figured out that the person mentioned in the news was Lin Che.Yu Minmin was slightly fatigued as well. She looked extremely agitated. \u201cThe company will try to arrange for you to appear at a suitable location so that you can let everyone know that you aren\u2019t being locked up. But you must first confirm that the police station won\u2019t say anything. You didn\u2019t get involved with drugs, right?\u201dYu Minmin still looked at Lin Che somewhat doubtfully.\u201cOf course not,\u201d Lin Che said.Yu Minmin nodded. Since she said so, Yu Minmin believed her; she too felt that Lin Che was definitely not that kind of person.\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go over to the endorsement company to explain the situation first.\u201dLin Che and Yu Minmin soon arrived at the endorsement company.However, it was a small world where enemies were bound to meet. As they got out, they saw Senmira walking out in sky-high stilettos.\u201cAiyo, Lin Che. Why, I heard that you were put in prison. You came out so soon.\u201dUpon seeing her, Lin Che felt that she could not let her pride take a hit.\u201cYes. With a fool like you still out in the world, I felt that I couldn\u2019t just carelessly go to prison.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Lin Che, you\u2019re still so arrogant, huh. Sure enough, you entered this industry too late still. Rookie, learn properly from your senior. What yours truly has done is called a strategy.\u201d\u201cHuh, indeed. A person without actual ability just likes to do anything possible,\u201d Lin Che said.From the side, Yu Minmin smiled and looked at Senmira. \u201cMira, I\u2019ve been in this industry for a long time too. Let me give you a word of advice. Use your underhanded methods less so you avoid destroying yourself.\u201dSenmira snorted. \u201cWho do you think you are? How dare you talk to me like this? I did it. Now, what are you going to do about it? Hmph, just take this small and hopeless celebrity of yours with you and live on an empty stomach. You dare come up against me when you haven\u2019t even looked at yourself?\u201dWhen she finished speaking, she forcefully brushed past Yu Minmin\u2019s shoulder and walked past them.Lin Che bit her lip furiously and said to Yu Minmin, \u201cI can\u2019t tolerate seeing her be so arrogant.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cSooner or later, she\u2019ll dig herself into a grave.\u201dThe two of them entered the company. The company staff said gloomily, \u201cDon\u2019t come here anymore. We can\u2019t do anything about this. The company will absolutely not use an artist whose reputation has been tainted like this.\u201dAs they said this, they were going to chase them out. They had seen too many artists pester them like this.\u201cGo out, go out. Hurry up and leave.\u201dHowever, right at that moment, someone suddenly came in from outside and softly told the person-in-charge something.That person\u2019s expression changed instantly. The gaze with which he looked at Lin Che also changed immediately.He stood up and said, \u201cMiss Lin, I apologize for my earlier conduct. We just received notice that the police have already clarified that this was a false alarm and you were not involved with drugs. We spoke a little impulsively earlier and we\u2019re really sorry.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe executive rubbed his forehead, cold sweat forming on his back.

It was reserved but proper.A few of them turned back in surprise to see Qin Hao standing there.Behind him were a few of Gu Jingze\u2019s bodyguards with an air of power. The people around them gazed in awe.Senmira stood still and forgot to put her hand down as she stared at them.Yu Minmin also stood there staring in surprise at the people who just arrived.Lin Che saw Qin Hao and immediately asked, \u201cAssistant Qin, what brings you here?\u201dQin Hao was extremely courteous and polite to Lin Che, \u201cSir asked me to come over.\u201dLin Che acknowledged him and looked around her. She thought it was strange how they looked so afraid of just one assistant.Senmira withheld her anger and glared hard at Lin Che. Who would have thought that she would know a person like that?Furthermore, to see Qin Hao treat her with so much respect, what gold throne did Lin Che sit on?Was it really Gu Jingze?That was impossible\u2026Senmira turned around and quickly said, \u201cMr. Qin, hello. I\u2019m Senmira.\u201dQin Hao glanced at Senmira. Although she was a huge star and a household name, Qin Hao was indifferent towards her.Qin Hao looked at Lin Che and indirectly told Senmira off in an airy tone, \u201cMiss Lin, Sir said that if anyone made you unhappy, he would settle it for you. Whether it\u2019s burying the person in snow, expelling him from the country, or sending him to Cambodia, he will find a way to make that person vanish without a trace from this country.\u201dSenmira shivered and watched Qin Hao\u2019s dark expression.Qin Hao\u2019s eyes glanced coolly over to her before returning to Lin Che with a lot of respect.Lin Che could not be bothered about her as she asked Qin Hao, \u201cDid Sir come too? Where is he?\u201dQin Hao replied, \u201cSir is waiting for you out in front.\u201dLin Che nodded. She glared at Senmira before turning to head out.Qin Hao let the bodyguards follow after Lin Che.

She quickly took out her phone and called Lin Li.After Lin Li heard what happened, she almost threw her phone in anger.She hung up and said to Han Caiying, \u201cThis Lin Che is being too arrogant.\u201dHan Caiying asked in disbelief, \u201cIs she really with Gu Jingze?\u201dLin Li huffed, \u201cEven if she is, Gu Jingze is just toying with her. Lin Che is nothing.\u201d\u201cYes exactly. She\u2019s not as pretty or elegant as you. I don\u2019t believe that Gu Jingze would rather fall for her and not you.\u201dHowever, Lin Li grew more furious the more she thought about it.She was jealous that Lin Che had such a good man protecting her.Thinking about Gu Jingze\u2019s elegance and looks that day, she was so jealous. He was such an unrivaled man.How did Lin Che get so lucky?!\u2014\u2014Yu Minmin followed the bodyguards with curiosity on her face.They wore jet black suits and an earpiece on one side. Yu Minmin thought that she even caught a glimpse of weapons hanging at their waists.They formed a line around the two of them as they went out. They were greeted by a row of black cars with Gu Jingze\u2019s in the middle.Lin Che recognized Gu Jingze\u2019s car and headed straight to it.The car door opened and Gu Jingze stepped out.Yu Minmin\u2019s eyes lit up, but she recalled that this was Gu Jingming\u2019s brother. Her face flushed with awkwardness.But how did Lin Che know Gu Jingze\u2026Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che and frowned.Lin Che felt a little embarassed, \u201cAbout the advertisement and the police station, did you help me?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cI only greeted them.\u201dGu Jingze continued, \u201cCome. I\u2019ll send you home.\u201dLin Che nodded and pulled Yu Minmin away, \u201cSister Yu, I\u2019ll make a move first. Call me if anything happens.\u201dYu Minmin took a sneak peek at Gu Jingze and asked Lin Che, \u201cYou and Gu Jingze\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2026\u201d Lin Che was awkward. She did not know what to say about their relationship.Yu Minmin understood that some things were better left unsaid. She was just surprised and just looked at Lin Che. She was really lucky to know Gu Jingze, one of the biggest giants in the country. She smiled and said, \u201cAlright, go ahead. I\u2019m off too.\u201dLin Che smiled gratefully at Yu Minmin before turning back to Gu Jingze\u2019s dark blue Porsche.Gu Jingze looked at Yu Minmin. Feeling flattered, she bowed her head and smiled at him.She never thought that she would get to be so close to someone so high and powerful.Gu Jingze, still looking at her, smiled back plainly.Yu Minmin bowed and hastily backed away when she saw him get into the car.Upon his command, the row of bodyguards swiftly got into their cars and drove off while protectively surrounding the dark blue Porsche in the middle.In the car, Lin Che looked at him shyly, \u201cThanks for helping me.\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. You are my wife and it\u2019s my duty to help you.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cAbout the drugs, I have never done it. Really.\u201dGu Jingze turned to her and said, \u201cI trust you.\u201dLin Che paused. She was touched by his unquestioning trust.Gu Jingze continued, \u201cAlthough you\u2019re uncultured, ill-mannered, lack knowledge, and lazy, I believe you wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThanks for the praise.Lin Che wanted to tell him to not trust her.Gu Jingze said, \u201cFurthermore, it was also my fault that you had to spend a day at the police station.\u201d\u201cThat was not your fault.\u201d\u201cAs your husband, it\u2019s my responsibility to help you. However, I was overseas and had no idea something had happened to you. I lost track of time and for that, I apologize.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d Lin Che dismissed him with a wave of her hand.\u201cNo, you are my wife,\u201d he emphasized.Lin Che\u2019s heart fluttered. He looked at her with dead seriousness, filling her heart with emotions.He said she was his wife\u2026She quickly turned away, not wanting see his enchanting face.Soon, they arrived home.They walked in one after another. Gu Jingze instructed the maid, \u201cGive Madam some medication.\u201dLin Che turned back. Gu Jingze said, \u201cYou still have a cold. Take some medicine before going to bed.\u201dIn the bedroom, Lin Che sat down on the bed. The maid brought the medicine in. Gu Jingze took the medicine and signalled for the maid to leave. He said to Lin Che, \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. I don\u2019t need to take any medicine.\u201dGu Jingze frowned, \u201cOpen your mouth. Be a good girl.\u201dHis voice was low and pleasant like a cello. Lin Che\u2019s heart palpitated and she thought how rare a perfect man like him was.He was so hypnotizing, sexy, wealthy, and even responsible.He was so nice to her.It was only because he felt responsible to be nice to his contract wife that he helped her so much. But still, she felt touched.It suddenly occurred to her that if they divorced one day, she would never be able to find such a perfect man again.Lin Che\u2019s heart felt a slight tang.Gu Jingze asked,\u201d What are you daydreaming about? Don\u2019t act dumb. Open your mouth and take your medicine.\u201dLin Che blushed and turned away, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine. Anyway, medicine is not good for the body. I didn\u2019t even take medicine when I had a high fever of forty degrees Celsius when I was a kid. And I got well on my own.\u201d\u201cForty degrees\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze stared at Lin Che. She had some kind of luck to still be alive until today. \u201cI finally understand why you\u2019re so intellectually challenged. It must be that childhood fever.\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201d Lin Che raised her head in objection and said, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely why my body is so strong! I lost so much blood but still survived.\u201d\u201cYour method is not scientifically proven. Who skips medicine when they have a high fever?\u201d Gu Jingze insisted.Lin Che said, \u201cNot everyone is born with a golden spoon in their mouth like you. We don\u2019t all have a personal doctor at our call. I lived with a nanny when I was little. She was always busy and no one really bothered about me. But it didn\u2019t matter because I rarely got sick. My body is strong. I only remember getting a forty degree fever that one time. I woke up in the middle of the night but my nanny wasn\u2019t around. I ran out to look for medicine but I hadn\u2019t learned many words back then. So I mistook a bunch of yellow tablets as cold medicine and swallowed them all. I almost scared my nanny to death and she rushed me to a nearby clinic. It turned out that nothing happened to me and my fever had already subsided. The doctor said that kids who usually take medicine would have been in grave danger. I was lucky to have such a strong immune system.\u201dUpon hearing how nonchalant she was, his face sank and his thin lips formed a straight line. He had unknowingly moved closer to Lin Che. She raised her head and met his dark pupils. She leaned back but Gu Jingze said threateningly, \u201cTake your medicine. Don\u2019t force me to take extreme measures.\u201dLin Che watched him inch closer to her, his lips and throat moving. She felt her body get warmer so she turned around, ready to escape, \u201cI\u2019m really okay. I don\u2019t need medicine.\u201dAt that moment, Gu Jingze put the pills in his own mouth. His long arm reached over to her and his hand held Lin Che\u2019s chin. He pressed his lips against hers.A cool tongue, accompanied with the bitter taste of medicine, invaded Lin Che\u2019s mouth.Lin Che screamed and then she felt his lips completely block her breath.The pills slid down her throat as she stopped breathing momentarily.What was worse was that even after the medicine had gone down, his tongue was still exploring her mouth, not wanting to leave.After what seemed like eternity, he finally released her lips. Lin Che coughed fiercely. Gu Jingze noticed her ears had turned red and the corners of his mouth curled into a smile. As she raised her head, he handed her a cool cup of water, \u201cDrink some water to help yourself.\u201dLin Che speechlessly glared at him.Gu Jingze moved closer to her, full of amusement, \u201cWhy? Do you need me to make you drink water the hard way too?\u201dLin Che burst. She huffed, \u201cBastard!\u201dShe snatched the cup of water and quickly took a huge gulp.Gu Jingze nodded in satisfaction, \u201cGood girl. Don\u2019t try to challenge me next time.\u201dLin Che thought,This person was pure evil.However, he just wanted her to take the medicine for her own good. She felt a little warm in her heart.When she was young, nobody had cared so much about her besides her nanny.Gu Jingze glanced at her, \u201cI hope you get well soon; I don\u2019t want you passing it to me.\u201dSeriously\u2026\u201cRelax. My body is really strong. I\u2019ll recover quickly. Also, what you just did will make passing it to you even easier.\u201d\u201cStrong? You got sick out of the blue,\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s gaze was fixed on her lips, \u201cSaliva can kill germs and bacteria; you won\u2019t pass it through that. Just take care of yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was true. Since he was treated like a king in the Gu family, he had so many people tend to him. He did not need her concern.Even if he caught a mere cold, he would have a team of doctors all ready to treat him.They were a part of two different worlds. Lin Che suddenly realized how different they were and how distant she was from him.Lin Che said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I get into an accident every time.\u201dBut then again, a lot of things had happened to her recently. If she was not getting hurt, she was falling sick.She thought,Mo Huiling probably did not experience all those things like she did.She started to blame herself. No wonder Gu Jingze liked Mo Huiling. She was good and obedient; she never got into any trouble.Lin Che thought,Perhaps people were right when they didn\u2019t approve of her being with Gu Jingze.A woman like Mo Huiling was better suited for him.At least her life was comfortable and decent. She did not have many problems in her life.On the other hand, a small bug like Lin Che had a life full of problems that she could not avoid it even if she wanted to.Gu Jingze said, \u201cAlright. Go to sleep quickly.\u201d\u201cBut I haven\u2019t washed up,\u201d Lin Che replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze said, \u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019re still sick. Nobody is complaining anyway.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and sleep,\u201d he commanded and tucked her in with the blanket.Lin Che thought,Nobody was as bossy as him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Lin Che stood up to go to the bathroom, she saw Gu Jingze lying there. Unfortunately, the couch was indeed a little too short for his 1.9-meter height. He had to put his legs up to fit on the couch. Lin Che felt slightly uncomfortable as she looked at him. She lowered her head and gazed at him. Fast asleep, Gu Jingze\u2019s thin lips were tightly pursed. His brow was relaxed and lacked the usual sternness, making him look a lot more gentle. His exquisite skin, which was flawlessly smooth such that no pores were visible, really made women envious.She looked at him like that for a while before holding her chin as she instinctively went a little closer to him.This man was actually her husband.Thinking about it she still felt that it was miraculous.Furthermore, her husband was seriously handsome.No celebrity or artist she had met looked more perfect than him.Of course, the reason that Gu Jingyu could be so famous was also because their Gu family genes were fantastic.There was also Mr. President; he was reputed to be the most charismatic President they ever had in many years. It was clear that the Gu family genes were really great.Lin Che realized that although the two of them had been married for a very long time, this was still her first time observing him in such detail.It turned out that his eyelashes were very long when she looked at them like this.It turned out that the corners of his eyes were lifted very high when she looked at them like this.It turned out that his lips were so full, so\u2026\u201cWhat are you looking at so sneakily?\u201d At this moment, she suddenly heard Gu Jingze\u2019s muffled voice.All at once, Lin Che almost fell to the ground on her butt.When she lifted her head, she saw him looking at her with a face full of mischief. His playful expression made Lin Che feel completely ashamed.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m looking at you. Why? You\u2019re my husband. I can\u2019t even look at you?\u201d Lin Che said, feigning composure. She glared at Gu Jingze indignantly.The sentence \u201cyou\u2019re my husband\u201d, made his eyes stir.His smile thickened and he came slightly closer to her.His face enlarged abruptly and gave Lin Che the sudden urge to move backwards.However, Gu Jingze swiftly took her chin between his fingers and prevented her from moving.Lin Che shouted, \u201cWhy did you come so close?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re my wife. Why can\u2019t I come a little closer?\u201dThe sentence \u201cyou\u2019re my wife\u201d, made Lin Che\u2019s cheeks begin to heat up immediately.Gu Jingze seemed to be looking at her lips teasingly. \u201cTell me. What were you doing so close to me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I saw something on your face\u2026 \u201d Lin Che avoided the look he shot directly at her.\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? There\u2019s nothing on my face.\u201d\u201cOf course there is. There\u2019s so much eye crust.\u201d Lin Che was making things up.\u201cHehe, you think everyone is as sloppy as you,\u201d Gu Jingze snorted.Lin Che glared at him fiercely.He was looking down at her again.But it was really strange; this man seemed to be capable of always being elegant. Even lying on an inadequate couch like this, his sleeping posture could be so nice to look at. It was as if he had not moved once throughout the night and his face perpetually looked very clean.\u201cAre you telling me or not? What exactly were you looking at?\u201d He looked at Lin Che persistently.\u201cI really\u2026 \u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d Gu Jingze approached her abruptly.Shocked, Lin Che only felt that he was about to crash into her nose but then, he stopped moving at the perfect time.Just like that, from the right distance, he used his breath to stir up her feelings and make her cheeks itch.\u201cYou, you, you, you\u2026 \u201d\u201cWrong answer.\u201d The instant his voice broke off, his lips immediately and palpably fell onto hers, brushing her lips slightly like a dragonfly skimming across the water.Lin Che was surprised. \u201cYou, you, you, you really kissed me.\u201dLooking at her panicked expression that was as if she had seen a ghost, Gu Jingze almost broke out in laughter immediately.\u201cI never joke around,\u201d Gu Jingze said sternly.Lin Che was so scared that she quickly pushed Gu Jingze away.Looking at her scramble to escape, Gu Jingze broke out in laughter for real this time.As she listened to his mocking laughter, Lin Che really felt that she had disgraced herself completely.She went straight into the bathroom and closed the door, her heart about to jump out of her chest.This could not do. She had to go further away from him.Otherwise, what was she going to do about this man, who now loved playing as a hooligan for no reason?At night, Lin Che did not get a good sleep at all.But on the second day, Lin Che very quickly received a piece of good news.The discussions about her on the news had already disappeared. The police had indeed issued an apology swiftly, indicating that that was just an accident and that everyone had maligned an innocent person.Also, Lin Che\u2019s advertisement deal was also very quickly set in stone.When Lin Che arrived at the company, Yu Minmin was presently waiting for her inside. Her face could not help but twitch upon seeing Lin Che before she let her in while saying, \u201cAccording to the rumors, that Senmira has already been banned.\u201d\u201cHuh? Is that so?\u201d Lin Che said in a confused tone, \u201cWho said that?\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cEveryone in the industry knows. Senmira offended someone, so her management company already terminated her contract. Right now, there\u2019s not one management company that dares to sign her on again either. While she\u2019s allowed to take on work on her own, the key problem is that no company dares to work with her too. I reckon she\u2019ll gradually disappear after this.\u201dLin Che blinked. She felt that it was really easy for a person to vanish from this profession.Yu Minmin said, \u201cI can tell that Gu Jingze is doting on you quite a bit.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face turned slightly red in an instant as she looked at Yu Minmin in embarrassment.But thinking about it, she felt instead that that wasn\u2019t the case.Gu Jingze was just too responsible; he felt like he owed her because even after their marriage, he still met Mo Huiling occasionally.However, she did not feel that the marriage this time between the two of them was all because she had stirred up trouble, nor did she feel that it was his problem.Their marriage was a result of both their mistakes; they could not blame each other.Lin Che sighed once before saying, \u201cSister Yu, you don\u2019t understand. This isn\u2019t about whether he dotes on me or not\u2026 but he is in actual fact a very good person.\u201dYu Minmin broke into a smile. \u201cIf people find out that you called Gu Jingze a very good person, that will really frighten them to death, alright.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Lin Che blinked her eyes in slight confusion.Yu Minmin said, \u201cEveryone knows that Gu Jingze is a tycoon who strikes terror in people\u2019s hearts. He\u2019s indeed very difficult to approach. Furthermore, you think someone who can play so well on the market can still be so simple-minded?\u201dLin Che blanked out. When they were just starting out, she did in fact feel similarly that Gu Jingze was very aloof, very demanding, and very detestable.But afterward, she got familiar with him and consequently was no longer so bothered by him.Now, she did not feel that Gu Jingze was terribly scary.Yu Minmin said, \u201cAlright. We have to get going very soon. The production team snagged a good advertisement opportunity. I\u2019m sure you know the show \u2018National Winner\u2019.\u201d\u201cOf course I know it. Isn\u2019t that a flagship program? Everyone knows it; the viewer ratings are so high and people of all ages love to watch it. I, for one, grew up watching this show,\u201d Lin Che said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou guys are going to participate in this show this week. As one of the major characters, you have to go participate too. Take note and prepare for it.\u201dHearing this, Lin Che said excitedly, \u201cI can go participate too?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dLin Che immediately felt an extreme happiness. She did not expect that she would one day actually be able to participate in a program with such high viewer ratings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Lin Che did not know that she herself would also have the chance to make an appearance. After all, discussion between the crew and the production team of the programs was still needed to decide who would be chosen when the time came.Lin Che had been preparing for this program with a lot of excitement.But when she left, she saw that Gu Jingze had actually come to pick her up.He was driving the car right outside the company. Lin Che hurriedly said to Yu Minmin, \u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave first, Sister Yu.\u201dYu Minmin nodded her head. \u201cQuick, go ahead.\u201dShe glanced at the Gu family\u2019s modest Porsche. Her eyes twitched. Contrary to what she had expected, it turned out that Lin Che was actually involved with Gu Jingze.Previously, she could not tell what exactly was appealing about this small lass Lin Che.But after interacting with her for a long time, she indeed felt that although Lin Che was very loud, she was in fact very interesting and very genuine as well.Lin Che climbed into the car and looked at Gu Jingze. \u201cWhy did you come to pick me up?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it normal for a husband to pick up his wife?\u201d He looked at her and asked instead.Instantly, Lin Che\u2019s heart raced.However, Gu Jingze curled the corners of his lips. \u201cThe Gu family wants us to make a trip back, so I came to pick you up.\u201dShe just knew it\u2026Lin Che felt ashamed about the silly touched expression she had shown earlier. She seriously wanted to slap herself twice.Very soon, Gu Jingze and Lin Che arrived together at the Gu residence.Security at the entrance was still highly strict. But because she was here with Gu Jingze, they merely gave a signal before Gu Jingze drove straight through the stately bronze gates.When they arrived inside, Lin Che did not go in together with Gu Jingze. She went in and immediately looked for Mu Wanqing.\u201cMother, I\u2019m here,\u201d She said, smiling as she entered.Gu Jingze followed suit thereafter.The moment she saw Lin Che, Mu Wanqing was very happy. She tugged at her and said, \u201cWhy did you lose weight?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it good to be a little slimmer?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s not good.\u201d Mu Wanqing lifted her head. \u201cJingze, why didn\u2019t you take good care of Lin Che?\u201dStartled, Gu Jingze said, \u201cIt\u2019s her own fault for being stupid. She\u2019s always stirring up trouble for herself; she either falls ill or meets with a mishap. What can I do?\u201dMu Wanqing said, \u201cNonsense. You only know how to make excuses. By the way, your brother is back. He\u2019s inside.\u201dMu Wanqing said to Lin Che, \u201cYou two didn\u2019t conduct a wedding ceremony either, so you haven\u2019t met the brothers. Go together with Jingze.\u201dLin Che did not want to be together with Gu Jingze at all.Throwing a glare at Gu Jingze, she said affectionately to Mu Wanqing, \u201cI still want to accompany Mother for a while.\u201d\u201cWhy would you accompany this old woman? Look. Jingze is glaring at me. It\u2019s better for you newlywed lovebirds to spend more time together. Go ahead.\u201dLin Che could only look at Gu Jingze and follow him reluctantly as he walked forwards.Shortly after, Mu Wanqing caught up with them as well. She followed behind them to go meet Gu Jingming together.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che and lowered his head to say, \u201cWhy are you so unwilling to be around me?\u201dLin Che turned her head around quickly. \u201cHow am I unwilling?\u201dGu Jingze swiftly pulled Lin Che\u2019s hand. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you looking at me?\u201dWith her hand in his grasp, Lin Che\u2019s body stiffened completely. She looked down at her own hand and frantically tried to shrug him off. \u201cHow am I not looking at you?\u201d\u201cI realized that you really\u2026 have been continuously avoiding me. Why? What did I do that you\u2019re dissatisfied with to the extent that you must avoid me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m definitely not avoiding you, alright?\u201d Left with no choice, Lin Che looked at his eyes, which were watching her intently. However, she could not tell him that whenever she saw him, her mind ran wild with lewd thoughts. Thus, she could only shrug him off forcefully and walk forward swiftly.\u201cHey, you\u2026\u201d Behind her, Gu Jingze\u2019s brow began to furrow severely.As Mu Wanqing watched the two of them from the back, she could not help but smile slightly.It looked like the two of them were getting along pretty well.They did not have that feeling of mutual respect between husband and wife. Instead, they flirted, acted unreasonably, and argued; these were precisely signs of improvement in their relationship.Lin Che followed Gu Jingze inside.Lin Che said, \u201cEh, I thought there would be many people following Mr. President here.\u201dRight now, Gu Jingze\u2019s face was tight. He glared at her and said in a neutral tone, \u201cHe\u2019s in his own home. Why would he need people following him?\u201d\u201cThose bodyguards from the National Security Bureau or something.\u201d Lin Che had seen them on television before; apparently, those people were all very fearsome.Gu Jingze said, \u201cThey\u2019re not even as skillful as the Gu family\u2019s own security service. So once they enter the Gu residence, there\u2019s basically no need for them.\u201d\u201cHuh? The Gu family\u2019s security service is that formidable?\u201dGu Jingze looked at Lin Che as if he was looking at an idiot. \u201cDon\u2019t you usually watch the news?\u201d\u201cOf course I do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s likely that no one dares to publish official reports of news about the Gu family. However, there should be quite a few unofficial reports. You\u2019ll know once you do a search on the Internet.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 I usually only read entertainment news.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Dumbfounded, Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che. \u201cYou really have nothing better to do.\u201d\u201cWhy? This is called loving the job I take up. As an artist, of course I pay closer attention to entertainment news, hmph.\u201dGu Jingze lifted the corners of his lips for no reason as he looked at her seething expression.Lin Che questioned further, \u201cWhat news is it exactly? Can\u2019t you just tell me?\u201dGu Jingze let out a sigh. \u201cThe Gu family\u2019s entire security service was trained professionally abroad before returning. The bodyguards from the National Security Bureau cannot compare to the security service here at all. Every single one of the guards here are top-notch snipers, wrestlers, trackers, and anti-tracking personnel. Without having the best skills, there\u2019s no way they can stand here.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s so awesome. Isn\u2019t it very expensive then?\u201d Lin Che was greatly interested in this topic.Gu Jingze said nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that extreme either. These few close-proximity ones have a monthly salary of only three million.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che felt that she could no longer look at these burly chaps the same way again.So they were all wealthy people.Lin Che could not help but turn her head to take a look before again catching up with Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze looked at her money hungry manner and said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. With me as your husband, you\u2019re already the wealthiest person in the world.\u201d\u201cCheh, you narcissist.\u201d She glared at Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze could not help but smile.They arrived inside soon after.It was rare for Gu Jingming to be dressed in homewear. He sat inside looking at something and appeared to be very busy. Even here, he was spending some time to settle work matters.\u201cBig Brother, why were you so free to come home today?\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s tone was very casual.On the other hand, Lin Che was slightly nervous; she did not think that she would one day be able to stand in front of the President.Furthermore, he was even her elder brother-in-law.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingming saw Lin Che immediately and smiled before walking up to her. \u201cThis is Sister-In-Law? This is the first time we met. Forgive me for being a little busy all the time. Also, Jingze has shielded you too well, rarely bringing you home.\u201dIt was probably because he could not be bothered to bring her home since they were not true lovers anyway.While thinking this, Lin Che quickly smiled and shook hands with Gu Jingming.She felt that Gu Jingming did not quite look the same as he did on television. On television, he did not really look like the other two brothers from the Gu family. But in close proximity, she could clearly see the similarities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From behind, Mu Wanqing smiled while saying, \u201cQuick. Have a seat. What\u2019re you all looking at?\u201dLin Che quickly walked to Mu Wanqing\u2019s side. \u201cMother, I want to sit together with you.\u201dMu Wanqing still wanted to say something but she thought that it would be more convenient for Gu Jingming and Gu Jingze to speak alone. Thus, she stopped herself from speaking again. She looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cYou cling to me so much. Be careful. Jingze will get angry.\u201dLin Che hugged Mu Wanqing\u2019s arm affectionately. \u201cHe\u2019s welcome to get angry if he wants. I like Mother the most; I don\u2019t like him.\u201dMu Wanqing simply liked to cling onto her own daughter like this. She had always thought that it would be good to have a daughter like this. Now, with Lin Che being so clingy, it seemed to fulfill Mu Wanqing\u2019s wish. She could not help but be even happier. With Lin Che on her arm, she let her cling as much as she wanted to.On the other hand, Gu Jingze\u2019s gaze rested meaningfully on Lin Che as he looked at her.He only turned his head back again when he heard Gu Jingming call him.\u201cThe popular vote in the general election this time should still be in our favor.\u201d Gu Jingze began to discuss serious matters with Gu Jingming.Gu Jingming said, \u201cThe voting trend in C Nation isn\u2019t obvious right now. There are still two cities with unclear voting trends.\u201d\u201cH City and S City?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cH City has a larger grassroots population. If Big Brother is willing to quickly marry a Madam President from the civilian class, you will presumably garner quite a number of votes in exchange. I will build a series of manufacturing factories in S City again to take in the employees there. That will only leave us to deal with H City. Coincidentally, Big Brother is still short of a wife\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingming\u2019s expression stiffened. He looked opposite him towards Mu Wanqing.Sure enough, after Mu Wanqing heard this, she got immediately thrilled. \u201cYes, yes, your younger brother is right. Jingming, you\u2019re already so old too. It\u2019s time for you to consider settling down and having a family. A man can only give off a feeling of stability and maturity after he\u2019s married. This will be better for your career as well. Furthermore, you\u2019re already so old\u2026\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d Gu Jingming put down his teacup and glared at Gu Jingze. \u201cHis matter has been resolved so now, you guys are starting to open fire on me together?\u201dMu Wanqing said, \u201cIt\u2019s because I think what Jingze said makes sense. In fact, girls from commoner families are good too. They\u2019re genuine, unpretentious, and don\u2019t have so many bad intentions either. Jingming, if you\u2019re alright with it, I\u2019ll help you choose a few; maybe those who are teachers or doctors\u2026 they\u2019re not all bad.\u201dLin Che did not expect Mr. President to also be put in a difficult position of being pressured to marry. She could not help but begin to watch the fun from here.Gu Jingming\u2019s gaze changed a little. He looked outside and was slightly lost for words.Mu Wanqing recalled something again. She looked at Gu Jingze and Lin Che. \u201cYou two, don\u2019t just look on either. Although you\u2019re married now, Jingze is at the age to have a child as well. I won\u2019t force you because I know that both of you are furthering your careers. However, you must start thinking about that too, you hear me?\u201dLin Che froze at once, feeling slightly alarmed. She happened to glance at Gu Jingze\u2019s expression opposite her. The two of them looked at each other in dismay. Worried that Gu Jingze was angry, Lin Che said frantically, \u201cMother, we still want to enjoy our lives as a romantic couple. For the time being\u2026 we don\u2019t want children.\u201dMu Wanqing thought for a bit before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s true too. You\u2019ve only been married for a short time, so you\u2019re definitely unwilling.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s brow furrowed. He looked on as Lin Che showed a panicked expression when she heard about children.If he had a child with Lin Che\u2026He involuntarily thought that if he and Lin Che actually had a child, he or she would definitely be beautiful.Lin Che\u2019s skin was so white that it seemed like it was soaked in milk. And he was not too bad-looking either. If their relationship came to that point, their child would not have any flaws.But perhaps the child\u2019s intelligence would depend on luck. If he or she inherited that stupid brain of Lin Che\u2019s, then his or her future would be worrisome.Seeing that Gu Jingze had indeed furrowed his brow tightly, Lin Che quickly said, \u201cYes, yes. And once we have a child, Mother won\u2019t like me anymore. You\u2019ll only like the child then. I still want Mother to dote on me for a while more.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 that\u2019s true too. You\u2019re still too young. We\u2019ll see when you grow older.\u201dMu Wanqing patted her shoulder dotingly.Lin Che only heaved a sigh of relief at this. She smiled and looked at Gu Jingze opposite her. His expression was still gloomy.Gu Jingze raised his eyes and calmly picked up his cup to drink water. He looked like he didn\u2019t want to be bothered with her.Lin Che thought,He\u2019s so petty. Didn\u2019t I already say that we would not have a child?Even with this, he was still angry.However, she then felt that something under the table was silently inching closer to her.When those toes tickled her delicate thigh, Lin Che blanked out completely. Instantly, her body stiffened.With fiery eyes, she glared at Gu Jingze opposite her who was still maintaining a poker face. She cursed him in her head.What exactly was he doing?However, his leg was still moving upwards.Her dress was lifted up. Thereafter, she felt his skin traveling upwards even more slowly on her thigh. He was heading straight for her sensitive area.Lin Che tilted her body immediately.Mu Wanqing asked in surprise, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dLin Che\u2019s face turned red instantly. \u201cNothing. There was just a mosquito.\u201dWhen Mu Wanqing heard this, she raised her hand and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are there mosquitoes in the room?\u201dThe maids rushed in to tackle the problem.As Lin Che looked on, she glared venomously at Gu Jingze opposite her.However, Gu Jingze was still acting like nothing had happened. His head lowered as he drank his tea, his movements elegant and composed.Lin Che thought gloomily,He was literally a beast in a human form.Lin Che had just restrained her thoughts and sat down calmly. But this time, she again felt his long arm stretch directly under the table. His fingertips rested lightly on her leg. The coarse touch made her entire body jolt.This damn jerk!How could he play hoodlum at this time!Opposite her, the corners of Gu Jingze\u2019s lips lifted upwards. As he touched the softness in his hand, his eyes began to perk up as well as if he was extremely pleased.His scorching body heat vaguely passed to her through his palm.She could still palpably feel that he was slowly beginning to caress her. The heat generated by the friction made her entire body even more tense.Little by little, a pleasant numbness spread throughout her whole body. His caresses seemed to have a magical force.She really wanted to slap his hand away fiercely, but there were still other people at the table.Lin Che could only sit there and fidget uneasily. She glared at the man opposite her with an expression that seemed like she wanted to devour him.However, that man was acting like nothing was happening at all. He was still raising his eyelids and looking so comfortable.Lin Che seriously could not tolerate him. With this level of acting, he was definitely even more professional than her, a professional actress.Finally exhausted of all her patience, Lin Che directly \u2013Mu Wanqing looked at Lin Che in confusion. \u201cAre there still mosquitoes?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che nodded her head vigorously. She glared unyieldingly at the person opposite her. \u201cHn, a big mosquito.\u201dMu Wanqing paused before following her line of vision and looking opposite as well.Gu Jingze raised his head with perfect composure. He looked at Lin Che with a very innocent gaze.Mu Wanqing broke into a smile. She swept her eyes over the two people and thought that the two of them really looked more well-matched the more she looked at them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at them for a short while and smiled knowingly.Mu Wanqing immediately thought about Gu Jingming\u2019s marriage again.\u201cJingming, look at how blissful your younger brother is now. You should hurry up and make arrangements to find one too.\u201d\u201cMother, don\u2019t trouble yourself so much with my affairs. Anyway, you want a grandchild, so you should urge Jingze to try harder. That is more practical.\u201dWhy did he drag her and Gu Jingze into this again?Lin Che quickly straightened her back in an awkward manner.Mu Wanqing hummed. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You\u2019re older than both of them but you still haven\u2019t found a girlfriend. What is this?\u201dLin Che knew that from the moment the President took up the office, many people would speculate about his marriage. However, Gu Jingming simply never worried about it.He had been in office for almost three years. Everyone began to wonder why Mr. President was still not married.Initially, no one brought this up in the open anymore. But coincidentally, another general election was being held again. Whether or not he could take up an additional term still depended on how the last months of this year would turn out.Thus, Gu Jingming\u2019s marriage was once again brought up as a topic for discussion.Thereafter, Mu Wanqing said directly, \u201cThe room you\u2019ll be using tonight has already been tidied up. Alright. I won\u2019t disturb you two any longer. Go back and rest. Don\u2019t don\u2019t chat too long with Jingming, Jingze. Lin Che will be very bored if she\u2019s left alone in the room.\u201dLin Che immediately looked at Gu Jingze opposite her.They were staying here again\u2026Knowing that the two brothers had not met for a long time and probably had a lot to talk about, Lin Che tactfully left this place first.As he watched Lin Che leave, Gu Jingming smiled and said to Gu Jingze, \u201cSister-In-Law seems not that bad.\u201dGu Jingze sighed. \u201cStill, we were forced into this.\u201dGu Jingming broke into a smile. He gazed at Gu Jingze. \u201cFrom what I see right now, not everything is because it was forced. You mean that you\u2019re also forced to treat her well?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cSince I married her, she\u2019s my wife. I should treat her a little better. She\u2019s only 23 years old. This kind of marriage life is slightly too unfair for her, especially if I don\u2019t treat her well.\u201dGu Jingming looked away in deep thought and did not speak.However, Gu Jingming suddenly thought of something and asked, \u201cThat day, you called to ask me about a person; I forgot her name. Who accidentally crashed into the convoy of the Glass Palace?\u201dThe President\u2019s residence was called the Glazed Tile Palace, so the convoy was also accordingly called the Glazed Tile Palace Convoy. They were the strictest security guards by the President\u2019s side.Gu Jingze recalled the events of that day. \u201cThat\u2019s right. She was Lin Che\u2019s manager. Did she cause you any alarm that day?\u201dGu Jingming\u2019s eyes paused before turning slightly colder. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d\u201cYu Minmin, I think,\u201d Gu Jingze said.Gu Jingming nodded his head, his attitude still cryptic.The two of them talked about important matters for a short while before returning to their respective rooms.Gu Jingming watched Gu Jingze leave and said to his General Secretary beside him, \u201cGo and investigate Yu Minmin. Ensure that she didn\u2019t leave any trace of what happened that day.\u201dThe General Secretary naturally understood him. He nodded before taking his leave.Lin Che had paced up and down the room for a long time. It was only when she heard the door move that she jumped directly down from the bed.When she saw Gu Jingze enter, Lin Che shouted at Gu Jingze with a red face, \u201cGu Jingze, what were you doing just now?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face was completely neutral. \u201cWhat did I do just now?\u201dLooking at him feign innocence, Lin Che yelled even more angrily, \u201cYou were touching me secretly under the table!\u201dGu Jingze sat down and raised his head to look at Lin Che. \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cYou, you, you. You were taking liberties with me!\u201dGu Jingze shrugged and said, \u201cI did that to make our married life appear more realistic.\u201dLin Che was completely dumbstruck. \u201cIn that case, your performance just now was natural enough.\u201dGu Jingze smiled and said, \u201cYou were very natural too.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. My acting skills are bad. I wasn\u2019t as natural as you were.\u201dGu Jingze raised his eyebrows. He smiled and said, \u201cSo what you mean is that your earlier expressions were your genuine reactions? Then\u2026 when your face got red, it was a natural response?\u201dAt his remark, Lin Che\u2019s face began to redden even more. \u201cWhose face was red?!\u201d\u201cDo you want me to get a mirror for you to look into?\u201d Gu Jingze said as he stood up and inched closer to her.Lin Che hurriedly took a few steps backward. \u201cNo need!\u201dLin Che really had to hand it to him. In that type of situation, he could actually still play his role so well. Even now, he acted so colorfully and rendered her unable to distinguish between what was real and what was not.She looked at Gu Jingze\u2019s pressing gaze as he smiled faintly. It was so deep that it seemed like he was about to look into her soul. She quickly went into the bathroom as an excuse. She was going to shower, change her clothes, sleep early, and leave this place quickly.In short, visiting the Gu residence less often in the future was still more ideal.Even now, she seemed to still be able to feel his lingering touch at the base of her thigh. A shock of electricity streaked across and caused her to shake her head frantically to forget that feeling of intense passion.The next day.Lin Che followed the company to participate in the filming of \u2018National Winner\u2019, a popular variety program with extremely high viewer ratings.The company regarded this as a highly important matter and Yu Minmin borrowed a very expensive piece of clothing on Lin Che\u2019s behalf.As she looked at the clothes and high-heeled shoes in the bag, Yu Minmin smiled and said, \u201cThese are really not bad. However, the Gu family should have piles and piles of clothing that are more expensive than these.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cReally? But I don\u2019t really know how to look at brands, so I don\u2019t know which ones are expensive. Can Sister Yu come over next time and help me look?\u201d\u201cMe? Forget it. Does the Gu residence simply allow anyone to go in?\u201d\u201cUh? Can\u2019t you just go in whenever you want?\u201d Lin Che was slightly astonished.Yu Minmin could not be bothered to explain to her. \u201cOf course, you can casually go in. That\u2019s not the case for the rest of us. Alright, go get ready and do your make-up.\u201dVery soon after, Lin Che arrived at the television broadcast station.This program had an exclusive dressing room. Lin Che was very excited all the way and looked around everywhere.After some time, Lin Li arrived too.Upon seeing that Lin Che had actually come to participate in the program, she snorted and walked past Lin Che.\u201cNow, this program has also downgraded. Any cat or dog can come and participate too.\u201d Lin Li\u2019s fairly loud voice traveled from behind her.Yu Minmin glanced at Lin Che and said to Lin Che as if she was merely making small talk, \u201cI heard that Senmira just had all her schedules canceled. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or false. Someone saw her moonlighting at a small town. She even goes for events that pay ten thousand each. It seems like she really needs money.\u201dBehind them, Lin Li\u2019s expression changed immediately when she heard this.When she thought of Gu Jingze, her heart was indeed fearful. She snorted and raised her head haughtily. In her high heels, she walked out and said, \u201cThe air here is really bad. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll look for a private dressing room to do my make-up.\u201dLin Li left noisily with her assistant in tow.Lin Che said, \u201cWherever she goes, she kicks up a fuss, seriously.\u201dYu Minmin smiled. However, she saw that her phone was ringing. When she looked at the number, her heart jolted. Before leaving, she said to Lin Che that she was going out to answer a call.Yu Minmin only answered the call when she went outside.\u201cHello, how are you?\u201d\u201cMiss Yu, there are some things that I want to discuss with you a bit in person. If it\u2019s convenient for you, I can go look for you.\u201dYu Minmin drew in a deep breath. \u201cI already told you. That day was just an accident. I didn\u2019t have any ulterior plans.\u201d\u201cCan we meet in person to talk?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright\u2026 if you\u2019re worried that I recorded your voice secretly, then let\u2019s just meet and talk.\u201dInside.Lin Li sneaked glances at Lin Che inside. She was so angry that her face was completely green.She pulled her assistant beside her, over to her and said, \u201cLook for Lin Che\u2019s clothes later. Do you see that bag of hers? The clothes she\u2019ll be wearing tonight are definitely inside. Later, just go in\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She heard the uproar coming from outside but could not find Yu Minmin anywhere. She could only ask the make-up artist what had happened. The make-up artist said, \u201cThe situation must be like this because Gu Jingyu arrived.\u201dJust as she was done speaking, sure enough, she saw Gu Jingyu directly push open the door to the dressing room and walk inside.It was the first time the make-up artist had ever seen Gu Jingyu coming to the common dressing room. When she saw Gu Jingyu, she beamed with happiness.And Gu Jingyu came directly to Lin Che\u2019s side. He sat down, smiled, and said, \u201cHey, I see you\u2019ve lost weight. Is it because you couldn\u2019t see me everyday after filming ended so you became more and more emaciated from missing me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che looked at him speechlessly.Beside them, the make-up artists were listening to their conversation. They did not expect Gu Jingyu to actually be such a jokester. He was vastly different from the image they had of him prior to this. Furthermore, he was the kind of person who usually brought his personal stylist everywhere with him. He was not someone whom average make-up artists like them could come into contact with. All of them were very happy to be able to see Gu Jingyu so closely this time.After some time, the director sent someone to tell them to hurry up because the recording was about to begin.Lin Che rushed to do the finishing touches on her make-up. Then, she put on the clothes that she had brought here herself.She was dressed in a short off-shoulder dress which had floral patterns embroidered on it. It was matched with stilettos below and made it extremely comfortable to look at. It was very suitable for participating in a variety program like this one.Gu Jingyu patted her shoulder. \u201cDo your best.\u201dLin Che was still a little nervous. She drew in a deep breath before walking inside.In no time, the program began along with some music.Because Gu Jingyu was here, the production team did not dare to take it too far. There were very few game segments and they mainly did an interview with Gu Jingyu as the focal point.From the side, Lin Che saw Lin Li walk out as well.She glanced at Lin Che and snorted. With a haughty expression, she lifted her head.Then, all of the main production members came on stage. Lin Che stood on the tall stage as she looked at the fans and audience who filled the venue. They were cheering enthusiastically below. The huge lights were shining on Lin Che and they made her face heat up.Just when Lin Che was about to move forward, Lin Li pushed her quickly to the side.Lin Che blanked out. She still had very little experience on stage and momentarily did not really know how to best squeeze herself back in.Right at this moment, she felt Gu Jingyu grab her firmly and pull her directly to stand beside him.The seasoned and experienced host there naturally noticed this incident immediately. He broke into a smile as he looked at the team of people lining up properly. His gaze swept over Lin Che and Gu Jingyu.\u201cEarlier we noticed that when Jingyu realized that Lin Che had no place to stand, he immediately pulled her over to to the space beside him.\u201dInstantly the host made Gu Jingyu and Lin Che the topic of conversation.From behind, Lin Li looked at Lin Che who was standing next to Gu Jingyu. Her face was completely stiff.Lin Che\u2019s face showed her slight embarrassment at being talked about like this. Then, Gu Jingyu said with poise, \u201cIt\u2019s Lin Che\u2019s first time on stage. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience. As her senior, I must give her a hand.\u201dThe host said immediately, \u201cAiyo, Jingyu is so thoughtful. Lin Che, how about it? How does it feel to be cared for by Jingyu?\u201dLin Che smiled and said, \u201cIt feels\u2026 I think that after the filming, I thought that I might be beaten to death by his fans. Is the security for your program good? Will you be responsible for sending me back later?\u201dUpon hearing this, everyone proceeded to laugh.Lin Che seemed to gradually get a feel for this. Because the conversation revolved around Gu Jingyu, there were consequently more topics of conversation involving her. For the most part of the interview, she actually had opportunities all the time.On the other hand, Lin Li only had a few. She was mentioned only during the introduction and again interviewed for a while regarding her recent engagement. Apart from that, she did not appear in many frames.Lin Li\u2019s complexion darkened out of anger. She glared at Lin Che who was laughing and joking in the front. When Lin Che was being interviewed, she spoke in a very lively and easygoing manner. It made people feel at ease. Seeing that the reactions to her interview were so good, Lin Li all the more could not help but think to herself,This was only because she had Gu Jingyu\u2019s help, hmph.Lin Li thought viciously,But you won\u2019t be able to enjoy it for too long.As she thought this, she glanced maliciously at Lin Che\u2019s stilettos.Now, the host instructed all of the main members of the production team to pick up the sweets in the basket altogether and distribute them to the audience down below.The audience immediately went into an uproar. They kept asking for sweets especially when they looked in Gu Jingyu\u2019s direction.Lin Che had just grabbed a handful of sweets. When she threw them down, she already felt that something was wrong with her shoes. Frowning, she wanted to look down at it but again, she did not have time to do so. When she grabbed a fistful of sweets again, she only heard her shoe heel move all of a sudden.Lin Che\u2019s feet slipped under her and she nearly fell immediately.Someone behind her cried out in alarm.Fortunately, Gu Jingyu quickly held Lin Che up from beside her.The heel of Lin Che\u2019s shoe had broken.Behind, the host froze. \u201cOh no, your shoe is spoilt. Change into another pair.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face turned completely red. She sensed that the camera was still filming her. In a moment of anxiousness, she lifted her head, smiled, and said, \u201cCould it be that I\u2019ve already gotten this heavy? My high heels can\u2019t even bear my weight.\u201dEveryone laughed out loud upon hearing this. Lin Che made up her mind at that moment and directly removed her shoes. She broke off the heel of the offending high-heeled shoe and smoothly removed her other shoe as well. With a forceful knock against the stairs, the heel of that shoe similarly broke off neatly. She tossed the heels aside swiftly and put on her shoes under everyone\u2019s astonished gazes. \u201cAll done.\u201dThe host stared with his mouth agape. However, his response was still very quick. \u201cLin Che, you\u2019re too tough.\u201dBeside her, Gu Jingyu also chimed in. \u201cYes. No one in the production team sees her as a woman.\u201dLin Che raised her head, looked at the camera lens, and broke into a smile.The entire series of impressive actions earlier was directly stored in the camera.Below, the director smiled and nodded as he looked on. He did not forget to give a short reminder to his assistant. \u201cLeave this part in. This scene looks good and it has effect too. We can use it as the preview.\u201dThe people below the stage could not help but look at Lin Che as well. Contrary to expectation, this lass was fairly decisive.Lin Li snorted at the back. She felt much more refreshed as she watched Lin Che embarrassing herself in the front.It was just that she did not expect Lin Che to actually stay calm in the crisis and directly smooth over the embarrassment. It was really a pity that she did not take a bad fall.Lin Che returned to the filming. She looked back and coincidentally saw Lin Li\u2019s proud gaze. She immediately started thinking.Until the end of the program, everything proceeded smoothly.Gu Jingyu got off the stage and looked at Lin Che. \u201cIs your leg alright?\u201dLin Che raised her head and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you for today.\u201d She was really grateful to Gu Jingyu for helping her out so much all the time.Gu Jingyu said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of only saying it? Next time, treat me to a meal.\u201dLin Che agreed easily. \u201cAlright, definitely.\u201dThereafter, she saw Lin Li walk past her from the side with her head held high. The smile on Lin Che\u2019s face froze as she watched Lin Li pass by.By this time, Yu Minmin had already returned.\u201cWhat exactly happened just now?\u201d Yu Minmin had also been shocked upon seeing such a scary scene from below.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che picked up her high heels. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. These shoes are probably very expensive.\u201dYu Minmin held up the shoes to examine them for a bit. She said, \u201cThis was obviously ruined by someone. There are cut marks over here.\u201dLin Che narrowed her eyes, snorted, and said, \u201cI know who did this.\u201dLin Li. Who else could it be but her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As they were walking, Yu Minmin said, \u201cLuckily, your performance this time was not bad. You shouldn\u2019t have any problems.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThis Lin Li really seizes every chance to do evil.\u201dYu Minmin smiled as she looked at her. \u201cAren\u2019t you sisters?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. The Lin family doesn\u2019t even remember that they still have me as a daughter. You\u2019ve been with me for such a long time so you should know this too.\u201dYu Minmin smiled and looked at Lin Che. \u201d I really don\u2019t quite understand the ways of you rich people. Our family members are just civilians. It\u2019s good enough if I send money into my mother\u2019s account every month for daily necessities and provide for my brother\u2019s education.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWhat civilians? I\u2019m a civilian too.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cAlright. Both of us are part of a generation that doesn\u2019t have any backing and must depend on our own hard work. Still, you should be in a much better situation now. Look. Gu Jingze treats you very well and your career is on the rise.\u201dLin Che, \u201cOh, please. Still, it\u2019s only my career that\u2019s reliable. As for men\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy, I think Gu Jingze is very reliable too.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cHe just has a greater sense of responsibility towards me right now.\u201d\u201cResponsibility?\u201d Yu Minmin asked in a perplexed tone.Lin Che said, \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a very complicated matter. Forget it. I\u2019ll take it one step at a time. In any case, I have to work hard at my career.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s still your career that\u2019s the most reliable.\u201d\u201cYou can only hold money in your hand!\u201dYu Minmin smiled and looked at her extremely silly manner.Lin Che did not expect that the next day, a video of her on the show would immediately be posted on the Internet by a netizen at the scene.In the video, she knocked the heel of her shoe off cleanly before properly putting on the ruined shoes again and continuing the program as if nothing had happened.Everyone felt that in doing this, Lin Che was very professional. Furthermore, her actions were extremely charming.It made one involuntarily think about how tough this girl was. She was beautiful but did not have an ounce of pretentiousness or affectation, and was very easygoing.The fan count on Lin Che\u2019s Weibo page continued to surge.There were already thousands of comments on her latest Weibo post.At home, Lin Che surfed her Weibo for the most part of the day. She kept looking at those comments and felt her ego swell to a large extent.News of that day was published very soon. The headline was that Lin Che and Gu Jingyu had participated in the program together and had continuous sparks of chemistry throughout the filming. Gu Jingyu dashingly protected Lin Che and Lin Che worried about being attacked by his fans.Compared to all the female actresses who went on that day, Lin Che was really the one with the most exposure and the largest piece of news among them. The company was very satisfied and said that the director had personally praised Lin Che and said that she had a lot of potential in the future.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che resting on the couch with a silly smile. He walked over and said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dLin Che said proudly, \u201cI suddenly feel that I have the potential to become famous. Look! The number of fans I have now has already hit a few million.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Gu Jingze swept his eyes over it and smiled. He felt that she was really easily satisfied.\u201cJingyu\u2019s fan count has probably hit tens of millions.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che raised her head. \u201cGu Jingyu is a super A-list celebrity, alright? I\u2019m just a rookie.\u201dLin Che returned to the room and prepared to sleep. But then, she realized that the wardrobe in the room seemed to have just been organized.She opened the wardrobe, took out her pajamas, and went to the bathroom for a shower. It was only after she showered did she realize that this piece of clothing was a little strange.She only noticed when she looked in the mirror that the pajama was nearly half-translucent\u2026Lin Che yelled glumly towards the outside, \u201cGu Jingze, who bought these pajamas? Why are they so weird?!\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cHow is it weird?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cAnyway it\u2019s just\u2026 very weird\u2026\u201dGu Jingze frowned. He opened the wardrobe and took a look before shouting back, \u201cI think they\u2019re new clothes sent over by Mother from home.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che said gloomily, \u201cYour Mother\u2019s taste is too wicked. Why did she send over such sensual clothes\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps she really wants to have grandchildren sooner\u2026\u201d He smiled and said.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che looked dejectedly at herself in the mirror. \u201cHelp me get another pair of pajamas!\u201dGu Jingze looked at the various pajamas. Every piece really had its highlight. It made him a little curious involuntarily. He did not know how exactly these pajamas, which were full of temptation, would look on Lin Che\u2019s body.After looking all of them over, he still did not find a normal pair of pajamas. It looked like his mother had made up her mind this time to properly bring the two of them together. This was the reason why she had sent over such piles of clothing.Gu Jingze said, \u201cThere\u2019s no wearable clothing.\u201d\u201cThen what should I do\u2026\u201d Lin Che thought for a bit before saying, \u201cLend me your clothes first so I can wear them.\u201d\u201cMine?\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cJust put up with it and wear it. What part of your body have I not seen before?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. Don\u2019t worry. After I wear it I won\u2019t return it to you. You have so many clothes that you haven\u2019t worn before. It\u2019s no trouble for you to lend me a piece anyway.\u201dAfter a short while, Gu Jingze knocked on the door from outside. Lin Che carefully opened a sliver of the door. Inside, the mist from her earlier shower traveled outwards languidly and was accompanied by the fragrance of her body wash. Gu Jingze looked at her face, which was covered in two red patches after her shower. Her face triggered his sense of protectiveness like a baby\u2019s face would and he could not help but feel his body jolt.Lin Che did not notice his strange behavior. She tugged the clothes and closed the door in a hurry.In no time, she changed her clothes and walked out. Lin Che was smugly dressed in his roomy clothes and said cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019m still the smart one.\u201dUpon hearing the sound, Gu Jingze turned his head. Immediately he saw a white mass drift by. Lin Che was wearing his pajamas. It was huge and bloated as well, making her body appear even more delicate and small. The sleeves were too long so they were rolled up. The white expanse of her arms swayed back and forth like the roots of a lotus. The collar was too wide, so the dazzling white of her collarbones underneath and her uncovered chest could vaguely be seen.Instantly, Gu Jingze turned his head away. His Adam\u2019s apple was faintly moving back and forth.Naturally, a woman wearing a man\u2019s pajama made one feel that the relationship was very ambiguous.It very easily made one think many strange thoughts.Gu Jingze turned his head. \u201cLin Che, change back into your own clothes.\u201dLin Che turned her head in astonishment. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get someone to buy you clothes.\u201d He stood up as he said this. He did not look at her enrapturing body as he opened the door.Lin Che curled her lip. \u201cBut I won\u2019t ruin it by wearing it. Alright, alright. Since you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll just return the clothes to you.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cBut if you get someone to change the clothes, wouldn\u2019t Mother find it weird and suspect our marital relationship?\u201dAfter all, if they were husband and wife, wearing clothes that were translucent should not be a big deal either.Gu Jingze glanced at Lin Che and walked over. He said lowly, \u201cI have a way to dispel their suspicions.\u201dLin Che looked at him in confusion. The corner of Gu Jingze\u2019s lips lifted at once. He directly picked up that translucent piece of clothing belonging to Lin Che. The moment he exerted force with his two hands, the thin fabric easily ripped apart.Lin Che\u2019s face turned completely green.Gu Jingze opened the door and said, \u201cWhat clothing is this? With one tear, it\u2019s ruined. Help change Madam\u2019s clothes to sturdier ones.\u201dHe placed the completely torn pair of pajamas aside. A few maids could not help but stare speechlessly at one another as they looked at it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWas the clothing unable to bear the excessive excitement?Behind them, Lin Che\u2019s face was completely red.This damned Gu Jingze\u2026The maids quickly retrieved a normal pair of pajamas. They swept their eyes over them with completely teasing gazes. It was as if they were saying, you two were really a little too passionate\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She would probably look very good in these clothes.Gu Jingze picked up the clothes and looked at them slightly wistfully. However, he heard the door open noisily in an instant before Lin Che came out from inside.After changing her clothes, Lin Che finally heaved a sigh of relief.The pajamas she was wearing was a long linen gown. It did not show off her figure at all and she looked like a water bucket.Lin Che thought that it was terrific.Gu Jingze threw down the pajamas and lifted his head. He narrowed his eyes and looked at the clothes on Lin Che\u2019s body.These maids\u2026 what clothes did they get for her?Lin Che returned to the bed comfortably. After sitting down with her legs crossed, she carelessly picked up a nail clipper and began trimming her toenails.Gu Jingze looked at her with his face completely dumbfounded.Lin Che\u2019s soft and white legs were crossed. In the middle of her legs, a sliver of her white underwear could distinctly be seen. From such a small sliver, he could see her triangle-shaped underwear, which was laced with a thin floral border. It had cut into her flesh slightly and left some marks. Her legs were intertwined and Gu Jingze could not help but walk a few steps closer to her. He felt gloomy as he looked at her indecent actions, but he could not help but shift his gaze towards her. How he wished she could move again. That way, more of the soft flesh underneath would definitely be exposed.After she was done with her toenails, Lin Che grabbed her feet and blew on them. When her feet were lifted up, her flesh inside was even more greatly exposed.Gu Jingze felt a surge of arousal in his lower abdomen and finally could not bear it any longer.\u201cLin Che, can you sit even slightly like a woman?!\u201dLin Che lifted her head. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d\u201cWhat did you do? Do you want to know?\u201d Gu Jingze lifted his eyebrows.Before Lin Che could even react, Gu Jingze had already walked up to her.He lowered his head and placed an arm on both sides of her. He encased her thin and small body in his embrace and seemed inches away from pushing her down.Lin Che\u2019s eyes flashed as she looked at the man who approached her all of a sudden. He was right in front of her and his gaze was deep and secretive.His gaze landed on her frontal chest. It was as if his large hand had caressed it all over. Feeling uneasy, Lin Che wanted to put some distance between them.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Lin Che\u2019s gaze was flashing.\u201cYou started seducing me first.\u201d Gu Jingze\u2019s breath was like the scent of orchids.\u201cYou\u2026 I totally did not!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ever wear clothes like these when you\u2019re beside a man.\u201d With a warning gaze, he swept his eyes all over her body. His voice was low and husky like the beautiful sound of a cello.\u201cWhy\u2026 why\u2026 \u201d\u201cBecause\u2026 it\u2019s too easy to remove.\u201d His eyes followed the wide hem of the gown as if he could look through this piece of clothing and into her body.Lin Che froze.In the next moment, his long arms directly held her in his embrace.Lin Che was completely shocked and she toppled onto the soft blanket on the bed. She quickly grabbed his hand and struggled. \u201cGu Jingze, you\u2019re behaving like a hoodlum!\u201d\u201cShh, don\u2019t move.\u201d His long arms reached over and directly wrapped around her body.His magnetic voice was like a magical sound resonating in her ears. It had a unique kind of magic. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll really behave like a hoodlum.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Just when Lin Che was about to move, she really and palpably felt something of some sort behind her. It was so obviously sticking up against her body.She froze. When she widened her eyes and figured out what that thing was, her heart jolted and she did not dare to move recklessly.Gu Jingze just carried her in his arms like this. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all. Sleep.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dGu Jingze frowned. \u201cI\u2019m telling you to sleep. Do you not understand?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d\u201cOr do you want to exercise for a bit before sleeping?\u201d He was almost biting on her ear as he muttered this. His voice implied an exercise of a different kind.Lin Che\u2019s body was awfully stiff and rigid. She only felt that all of her blood seemed to be flowing backward. Her brain also followed suit and became dizzy.\u201cNo need, no need. Sleep\u2026\u201d She said hurriedly.She lay in his embrace for a long time. She only heaved a sigh of relief when she seemed to feel the thing sticking up behind her body finally softened slowly by a large degree.Gu Jingze felt the woman in his arms become more and more relaxed. Gradually, her shallow breaths began to even out as their sounds traveled over to him.He also slowly relaxed his body. However, some part of his body was obviously not as sensible as its counterparts.He sighed audibly. As he looked at the woman sleeping soundly in his arms, he carefully changed the position of his arms.He lowered his head and could still smell the faint scent of her hair.He shut his eyes hard.She was seriously a dumb woman\u2026The next day.When Lin Che woke up, she realized that Gu Jingze was already gone.Lin Che ran out. From the entrance of the dining room, she saw Gu Jingze eating.Gu Jingze\u2019s complexion did not look good. He looked as if he had not slept well.Lin Che walked over to him guiltily. She recalled that she had fallen slept in his embrace the night before. However, she had already forgotten what happened after that. She asked Gu Jingze, \u201cWhy? Was my sleeping posture last night not too good? To be honest, I tend to toss and turn in my sleep\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He merely moved his arm uneasily.His arm was a little stiff from having been used by her as a pillow.This was the result of not moving it at all for a night.The maids quickly served some breakfast to Lin Che. Lin Che raised her head and thanked them politely.After eating breakfast, Lin Che wanted to go to work. Gu Jingze said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you along with me. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLin Che stood up hurriedly. \u201cReally? I\u2019ll go change my clothes.\u201dAs he looked at Lin Che run inside, Gu Jingze shook his head wordlessly.She was always behaving in a crazy manner.The maid smiled and tidied up the dishes. She said, \u201cSir, do we really have to change all of the clothes that Ma\u2019am sent over for Madam?\u201dGu Jingze recalled those strangely-shaped pajamas. \u201cThrow them all away.\u201d\u201cAlright. But it\u2019s a bit of a pity. They\u2019re all in Madam\u2019s size.\u201dThe maid said, \u201cThe rest of the pajamas have already been put up.\u201dGu Jingze nodded. The maid heard the noises that Lin Che was making inside. They figured that she was looking for clothes again.Gu Jingze said gloomily, \u201cShe\u2019s seriously clumsy.\u201dThe maid smiled and said, \u201cPeople are bound to have some shortcomings. Madam is such a good person. Thus, it doesn\u2019t really matter that she\u2019s clumsy.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a good person?\u201d Gu Jingze raised his eyebrows.The maid said, \u201cYes. Madam does not put on airs at all. She treats us servants like her own family members. No matter what we do, Madam always says good, good, good. Often, she even gives us clothes that she hasn\u2019t worn. When she comes back with supper, she never forgets to bring some for us. Madam is truly an excellent person.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn no time, Lin Che walked out. Gu Jingze looked silently at her figure. He narrowed his eyes and looked at her deeper and deeper.Lin Che walked out and said in a surprised tone, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dGu Jingze stood up, casually picked up his clothes, and put them on. \u201cNothing. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLin Che still had to participate in promotional activities today, so she was dressed in plain clothes.

After all, she was not known to everyone like Gu Jingyu was. Thus, the people outside still did not recognize her. As a result, even if she went out shopping, no one noticed her as well. She was still just like an ordinary person.But it was clear that the television series was already receiving attention from the broadcast of its first episode.Its viewership ratings stood firmly in first place and its related news fully occupied the list of hot topics.And the few main leads inside began to be roped into various methods to generate hype.Naturally, the response from Gu Jingyu\u2019s fans was huge. Every day, his fans followed him around noisily as he attended his promotional activities and made everyone envious.Mu Feiran liked to keep a low profile. She did not really like to attend promotional activities and only went to several important places. One could tell that she had the style of a greatly successful person.And a small actress like Lin Che could only move to wherever she was needed. She followed suit and attended the promotional activities to the point where her legs nearly broke.However, she also reaped many benefits. Gradually, she started being able to respond to the reporters\u2019 questions. She began to learn from Gu Jingyu and was able to beat about the bush.Gu Jingyu took very good care of her the entire time and as a result, her reputation began to rise as well.Furthermore, what was even more delightful was that Lin Che\u2019s tough-girl role in the television series was extremely well-received. In no time, there were already people claiming to be Lin Che\u2019s fans and even a fan club was established.Lin Che knew that this was just a temporary effect. Whether or not this phenomenon could continue still depended on how her future developed.However, even if this was the case, she was already very satisfied.On the day that they went to the Gu residence to have a meal, the television series was coincidentally broadcasted on the television.Gu Jingze immediately saw Lin Che in the television series. She was holding a whip in her hand and appeared unrestrained and handsome. She looked extremely dashing.Contrary to what Gu Jingze had expected, Lin Che had such a side to her. He could not help but take another look at the television series, even though he never watched any.Lin Che was usually such a dazed person. He could not tell that she, in fact, had quite the flair for acting.After the two of them ate at the Gu residence, they prepared to return to their own home.While they were waiting at the entrance for the driver to pick them up, Lin Che suddenly said, \u201cActually, this place is pretty close to the house. Why do we have to insist on waiting for the driver to come? Let\u2019s just walk back. We ate so much for dinner; it\u2019ll be nice for our digestion.\u201dBehind them, just when Qin Hao wanted to come up to them and say something to stop them, he saw Gu Jingze stretching out a hand calmly. He gestured at Qin Hao to swallow what he was about to say.Gu Jingze looked at the sky and secretly gave a cue to the bodyguards behind him with his eyes. Thereafter, he nodded at Lin Che. \u201cAlright. We\u2019ll do as you said.\u201dWhen they arrived outside, the bodyguards spread themselves out slightly. Gu Jingze turned his head and took a glance. Only after ascertaining that everything was fine did he relax and walk outward along the street with Lin Che.This was a well-known area for the wealthy in B City. The back of the area was filled with villas attached with gardens and various manor. Not many people lived there.However, Lin Che felt that there were even fewer people than usual today.She did not notice that there were many bodyguards following behind her. She walked on the path feeling at ease in her heart.The streetlights beside the road shone down on a narrow stone-tiled path. It appeared very peaceful and secluded. Looking into the distance, there was a great feel to it.With one look, Lin Che saw someone selling handmade soaps at the side. She was attracted by those little trinkets and immediately shouted before hurriedly walking over. \u201cGu Jingze, look. This small rabbit was made so realistically. I want to buy it.\u201dWhen the shop owner saw the people following behind them, he just felt that their aura was extraordinary. They just did not look like ordinary people. Upon seeing the bodyguards dressed in black who were silently following behind them, a chill ran down his back.Thus, he was very fearful and respectful to the few important people who had suddenly come to his small shop. He said cautiously to Lin Che, \u201cThese are all handmade. They can simply be made on the spot and absolutely have the most natural fragrances.\u201dUpon hearing this, Gu Jingze said to Lin Che, \u201cIf you like it, you can try making one yourself.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cReally? Can I make one on my own?\u201dThe shop owner quickly said, \u201cOf course you can. Here, we provide molds for customers to try on their own.\u201dImmediately, Lin Che got very happy and smiled until she was grinning from ear to ear.As Gu Jingze saw this, the corners of his lips also began to lift up slightly.Lin Che was really a person who was very easy to satisfy. Such a small trinket could even make her smile so happily.The two of them entered the shop. The bodyguards outside naturally gathered together and quietly waited outside.As Lin Che looked at Gu Jingze, she broke into a mischievous smile. \u201cExcuse me. I want to make a handmade soap that is in his shape. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201dThe shop owner said, \u201cThat\u2026 it\u2019s not impossible either.\u201dGu Jingze presently stood beside her. Upon hearing this, he looked down and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little inappropriate?\u201d\u201cHow was it inappropriate?\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze snickered. A corner of his lips lifted gently. \u201cHandmade soaps are used when you\u2019re showering? So you mean that you hope to use a soap made in my liking to rub all over your body when you\u2019re showering?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che\u2019s face turned completely red. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that at all!\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head again slightly. As he looked at her small neck, he quietly sucked in a breath. He intentionally pressed himself close to her hair and gently said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I look forward to it greatly. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do it anymore. I want to make a small rabbit too, hmph.\u201dThe shop owner finally heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.From the side, he helped Lin Che as she made the soap. However, Lin Che\u2019s ability was obviously not strong. The soap she made looked very strange.Gu Jingze said, \u201cLook at how clumsy you are.\u201dHe could not tolerate that dumb manner of hers, so he also personally began to help her make it.\u201cHow should I do this?\u201d\u201cStupid. Move your hand over a bit. Does this look like a rabbit?\u201d\u201cLin Che, how can you be this stupid?\u201dLin Che looked at him speechlessly. \u201cAnyone would get anxious with you rushing them like this.\u201dThe two of them bickered noisily. At any rate, they ultimately managed to make a bar of handmade soap.The shop owner smiled and said, \u201cI can engrave your name on the soap to commemorate this.\u201dGu Jingze nodded and said, \u201cIn that case, just engrave it.\u201dLin Che\u2019s heart jolted immediately. As she looked at her own name and Gu Jingze\u2019s name carved together at the side, the smile on her face deepened slightly.After a lot of difficulties, the two of them had finally finished making it. The shop owner packaged the soap into a beautiful bag for them. Gu Jingze casually picked up the bag and continued walking out with Lin Che.Lin Che said with a huge sense of accomplishment, \u201cI\u2019m really talented. I made it look so beautiful.\u201d\u201cIt was clearly made entirely by me\u2026\u201d\u201cNonsense. I laid down the foundations. You only made it by standing on the shoulders of a giant.\u201d\u201cAlright, as long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d\u201cHey, there\u2019s ice-cream. I want to eat that.\u201dGu Jingze glanced over at it. It was ice cream that was made on the spot. Only little children were eating the ice cream.\u201cIt\u2019s unhygienic; don\u2019t eat it.\u201d\u201cNo, no. Even if it\u2019s dirty, I won\u2019t get ill from eating it. Hubby\u2026 buy one for me.\u201dUpon hearing her call him \u201cHubby\u201d, Gu Jingze felt his body begin to get tingly.Frustrated, he glared at Lin Che and said reluctantly, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh yeah.\u201dThe two of them reached the bottom of the stairs very soon. However, just when they had taken the last step down, they suddenly heard a familiar voice from behind.\u201cJingze, why are you here?\u201dTo think that they would meet Mo Huiling here\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One was tall and lanky and the other was slender. The two of them actually looked very intimate as they stood closely beside one another.And Gu Jingze was even carrying a small gift bag in his hand. The shop\u2019s name was drawn on the gift bag; it was called \u201cCarving Time\u201d.Mo Huiling walked over in a few hurried steps. She pulled Gu Jingze\u2019s arm all of a sudden and quietly inserted herself between the two of them. \u201cJingze.\u201d She lifted her head and smiled at Gu Jingze. Then, she stretched out her hand as she wanted to take the item in his hand. \u201cWhat are you holding? Let me take a look.\u201dGu Jingze subconsciously evaded her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dUpon being evaded, Mo Huiling\u2019s face froze. She looked at Gu Jingze and pursed her lips. \u201cDidn\u2019t you bring someone along? Why do you still need to carry this? I\u2019ll help you carry it.\u201dGu Jingze could not help but glance at Lin Che at the side.She stood there looking at the two of them. Her face seemed to be fairly calm.Gu Jingze said, \u201cNo need; it\u2019s nothing heavy.\u201dIt was difficult for Mo Huiling to say anything again. She could only tilt her head and secretly glare at Lin Che.Lin Che did not know what she had done wrong to make Mo Huiling detest her so much in such a short time. But thinking about it, it would have been even more strange for Mo Huiling to like her.Mo Huiling looked at the two of them. \u201cWhy are the two of you here?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cOh, we just came from eating dinner at the Gu residence.\u201dOnce again, Mo Huiling reproachfully turned her head and secretly glanced at Lin Che. \u201cWhy did you walk back?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cWe just walked back since we had nothing else to do. Why are you here?\u201dMo Huiling raised her head. She looked at Gu Jingze with a face full of cuteness. She completely did not care that Lin Che was still beside her watching. \u201cI just wanted to buy something to eat. I didn\u2019t expect to see you two. Jingze, there just happens to be a cafe over there. The ambiance is really there actually. Accompany me there so that we can sit inside, alright?\u201dHer eyes paused. She turned her head back and said to Lin Che, \u201cLin Che, it\u2019s rare for us to bump into each other here. Let\u2019s go over together and sit inside for a bit.\u201dLin Che looked at Gu Jingze. She did not really want to intrude upon their quality time together. However, just when she was about to say \u201cNo, I\u2019ll go home first\u201d, she felt Mo Huiling suddenly hook her arm through hers as if pretending to be close to her. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go there together and sit for a while.\u201dLin Che was simply pulled along. She turned her head back speechlessly and looked at Gu Jingze. However, Gu Jingze\u2019s expression was aloof as usual. She could not tell what exactly he was thinking.Lin Che could only follow them into the cafe.After sitting down, Mo Huiling automatically sat beside Gu Jingze. She looked at Lin Che across from her, smiled, and said, \u201cWhat does Miss Lin want to drink?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201dTo be honest, she did not really like drinking coffee. She could not tell the difference between the flavors of the different types of coffee.Mo Huiling took charge and called a waiter over. She said directly, \u201cThree Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffees.\u201dMo Huiling smiled and said, \u201cJingze only likes drinking Blue Mountain Coffee. The Blue Mountain Coffee from this shop is pretty authentic. Right, Jingze?\u201dGu Jingze could tell that Mo Huiling was intentionally leaning close to him. He could not help but be slightly unhappy.Gu Jingze said, \u201cAnything is fine.\u201dMo Huiling lifted her head to look at Gu Jingze with a face full of tenderness. \u201cJingze, you\u2019ve even lost weight. Have you been getting tired recently? You have to care more about getting rest. Don\u2019t be so concerned about your job. Your health is the most important.\u201dGu Jingze felt Mo Huiling\u2019s hand rest on his arm. He instinctively felt slightly uncomfortable and evaded her touch by moving backward. He smoothly pushed away her hand.Mo Huiling sensed that he was actually evading her. She became even angrier and moved forward so that she would be nearly leaning against his body.Gu Jingze\u2019s brow began to furrow deeply. Even though he understood that Mo Huiling had a childish temper and was intentionally putting on a show for Lin Che because she was jealous, he still felt unhappy.She had gone slightly overboard by doing this.Again, Mo Huiling seemed to suddenly remember that there was someone else besides them. She let out a dry cough and smiled at Lin Che in embarrassment.Lin Che pulled up the corners of her mouth and looked at her nonchalantly. Although she felt uncomfortable in her heart, she still looked calm on the surface as if she was unconcerned.Otherwise, what else could she do? Mo Huiling and Gu Jingze were originally a couple anyway. Lin Che did not even need Mo Huiling\u2019s intentional reminders right now to know this.Mo Huiling smiled at Lin Che and asked her as if she was very concerned, \u201cRecently, I seemed to have seen a lot of news about you. I still have to congratulate you. That television series seems to be doing very well.\u201dLin Che smiled as well. \u201cThank you.\u201dMo Huiling said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that I don\u2019t understand the workings of artists like you. But I think that this is probably considered successful as an artist?\u201dAs she said this, she pressed her lips to the cup and drank a mouthful of coffee. She looked as if she considered herself superior and her eyes had a hint of unconcealed condescension.Lin Che could not be bothered to put on a pretense in front of her. She raised her head haughtily and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s only just the beginning. I\u2019m still very far away from achieving success. But ultimately, I\u2019m still young, so I have a long road ahead of me.\u201dMo Huiling had grown up together with Gu Jingze since they were young. Her age was also very similar to Gu Jingze\u2019s. Naturally, she was also much older than Lin Che.No matter how well she took care of herself, the difference in age between her and Lin Che could still be seen.When Mo Huiling heard Lin Che say this, her expression changed immediately.But because Gu Jingyu was still beside her, it was difficult for her to say anything. She could only suppress her anger. She smiled at Lin Che and said, \u201cIs that so? Then I\u2019ll congratulate you on your success in advance. But I didn\u2019t expect you to even know Jingyu. It looks like your relationship with him is really not bad.\u201dLin Che said neutrally, \u201cYes, we\u2019re friends too.\u201d\u201cJingyu is really a good person.\u201d Mo Huiling intentionally said, \u201cHe\u2019s very nice to people and really knows how to look after them. You two even looked like quite a good match on television.\u201dAt this moment, Gu Jingze stood up immediately and said unhappily, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Huiling. It\u2019s time for us to go home too.\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s mood dampened instantly. She stood up with a swishing sound as well and looked at Gu Jingze angrily. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Jingze?\u201dRight at that moment, Gu Jingze\u2019s phone started ringing.Gu Jingze glanced meaningfully at Mo Huiling. He saw that the number was Gu Jingming\u2019s. Afraid that something had cropped up, he went out first to answer the call.After Mo Huiling saw Gu Jingze leave, she turned back and looked at Lin Che. She said, \u201cLin Che, what exactly are you doing?\u201dLin Che sneered. She looked at Mo Huiling\u2019s features change immediately after Gu Jingze left. Her acting skills were really good.Lin Che said, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Huiling snorted and said, \u201cYou made Gu Jingze carry things for you and even made him accompany you to walk on the streets at night. Do you know how dangerous it is for Jingze to do such a thing?\u201d\u201cDangerous?\u201d\u201cOf course! Do you think that Jingze is like you, a small artiste who has nothing at all? His life is worth more than a hundred of yours! If something happens to him, do you know what the consequences will be? I just knew it. Living together with a commoner like you will sooner or later be disastrous for him. Lin Che, if you want to die, it\u2019s up to you but don\u2019t pull Jingze along with you!\u201dLin Che sneered as she looked at Mo Huiling. \u201cMiss Mo, in your eyes, is Gu Jingze just some vulnerable item that faces perpetual danger and can\u2019t go anywhere at all?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I did come out to walk the streets with him and to walk home together. That\u2019s because in my eyes, he\u2019s not a man who\u2019s in danger. He\u2019s a man who has the right to enjoy life and has the right to be an ordinary person. He\u2019s my husband and the two of us share the same bed. Given our status and relationship, there\u2019s no issue as to whether we can or cannot do something. He helped me carry things and accompanied me on a stroll because we\u2019re a married couple!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed, I don\u2019t understand the danger that you\u2019re talking about. Because in my eyes, he was never an important person. He\u2019s my husband!\u201dMo Huiling\u2019s face turned purple with rage at Lin Che\u2019s words.Lin Che merely snickered. \u201cSo no matter how low I am in your eyes, I\u2019m Gu Jingze\u2019s wife. Great Miss Mo, I don\u2019t need you to criticize my life with Gu Jingze.\u201dWhen she was finished, Lin Che turned around immediately and left.Lin Che only let out a breath when she came outside. She stood by the entrance and looked at the sky that was dyed thoroughly neon.She was also very worried about becoming a burden to Gu Jingze. Because the gap in their lifestyles was so large, there were many things that she did not understand and many things that she was confused about.She closed her eyes and sighed before striding forward.However, when Gu Jingze returned from outside, he realized that only Mo Huiling was left in the cafe.Upon seeing Gu Jingze return, Mo Huiling cried and sprawled onto the table.Gu Jingze froze before walking over to ask, \u201cWhat happened, Huiling?\u201dMo Huiling raised her head, her eyes glistening with tears. \u201cJingze, I really don\u2019t want you to live together with Lin Che anymore!\u201dGu Jingze frowned as he looked at her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dMo Huiling looked at him miserably and pitifully. \u201cDo you know what Lin Che did to me just now?!\u201dGu Jingze brow twitched. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d\u201cShe told me that it was you and her who are husband and wife. Whatever she does is always right and whatever I do is always wrong. She and you have an equal relationship. I\u2026 then what am I? Jingze, am I the third party? But clearly, you and I are a pair. Why did she say this to me? Why did she hurt me like this?\u201dGu Jingze lowered his eyes to look at her. \u201cDid she really say that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Mo Huiling said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, you can go and ask her if she said that the two of you are the married couple. When you were here, she did not even say a word. The moment you left, she immediately started saying things like this to me. What exactly does she mean?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Huiling. I think you misunderstood what she said,\u201d Gu Jingze said.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Mo Huiling said, \u201cI\u2019m not a fool either. I heard what she said clearly word for word. Why, Jingze? Could it be that you don\u2019t believe me?\u201dGu Jingze sighed. He sat down and looked at her. \u201cNo. I just feel that she\u2019s not that kind of person. You probably misunderstood her; that\u2019s why you misconstrued her words. Alright, Huiling. Don\u2019t cry anymore.\u201dHowever, Mo Huiling bit her lips and felt even more upset.Gu Jingze said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll get someone to take you home.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not coming with me?\u201d Mo Huiling said dolefully as she lifted her small face.Gu Jingze did not see Lin Che. He was anxious to find out where Lin Che had gone and what exactly had happened. He was vaguely worried that she was angry so after pondering for a bit, he still said to Mo Huiling, \u201cI\u2019ll look for you tomorrow again. Right now, I still have an urgent matter to attend to.\u201dMo Huiling recalled that he had gone out in a hurry earlier to answer a call. She thought that he probably did have an urgent matter.She thought to herself that she was definitely not like Lin Che who was not considerate of his busy schedule. She merely hooked her arm through his. She was careful not to touch his body so as to prevent him from breaking out in a rash. However, she also longed to feel his body heat. She looked at his perfectly handsome looks and said softly to him, \u201cIn that case, go ahead and attend to your matters. Don\u2019t tire yourself out too much. I won\u2019t be able to bear it. I know that you\u2019re busy so I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201dGu Jingze drew in a deep breath and said to her, \u201cGo home.\u201d\u201cHm. Remember to look for me tomorrow once you\u2019re free. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Gu Jingze agreed earnestly.After Mo Huiling left, Gu Jingze asked where the Madam had gone. In no time, his subordinates brought him along and together, they found Lin Che who was strolling alone by the side of the road in the direction of their home.Gu Jingze caught up with Lin Che and said, \u201cWhy did you leave on your own?\u201dLin Che thought that he would have to console Mo Huiling for quite a while. Seeing that he had come over so soon, she said perplexedly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you properly accompany Miss Mo and chat with her?\u201dSeeing that Mo Huiling had gotten so angry, Lin Che also knew that Mo Huiling would definitely not have anything good to say about her after she left.Gu Jingze raised his eyebrows and looked at her. \u201cWhy? Did you want us to chat for longer?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cYes. It was rare for you to have bumped into each other.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really so thoughtful.\u201d Should he praise her for being such a magnanimous and good wife?Lin Che looked at him. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case. My personality is just\u2026 I forgot how the idiom goes. It\u2019s used to describe someone who\u2019s generous.\u201d\u201cMore tolerance will make you a bigger person?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. It describes me exactly.\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head and swept his eyes over her chest.\u201cHn. Your breasts are big.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che looked down and covered herself. \u201cGet lost, you hoodlum!\u201dGu Jingze broke into a smile. He only relaxed when he saw that she was not unhappy.However, he recalled what Mo Huiling had said and tilted his head to ask her, \u201cYou told Mo Huiling just now that we\u2019re a married couple, so whatever we do is always right?\u201dShe just knew that Mo Huiling would not say anything good about her.She did not seem to have phrased it in that way, but there was no problem with construing it like this either.\u201cYes, is that not the case?\u201d Lin Che intentionally acted stupid and tilted her head to look at him.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che blinking her eyes innocently with her face tilted. She looked extremely adorable and Gu Jingze helplessly shook his head.\u201cYes, yes, yes. Your words were right.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cOf course. You\u2019re my husband and I\u2019m your wife. Didn\u2019t you often say that we\u2019re a married couple and that it\u2019s only right for you to look after me? Thus, accompanying me on a stroll and helping me hold things are acts that a husband should do. Isn\u2019t that right, Hubby?\u201dShe was really becoming more and more daring toward him. She pulled on his arm when she came up to him and swung it back and forth. \u201cTell me, Hubby. Am I not right?\u201dHe really felt that his heart was about to melt. He could not help but smile and look at her. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re right.\u201dOnly then did Lin Che smile. She saw that they had almost reached the Gu villa. The two of them then went in together.When they went into the house, Lin Che eagerly took out the pile of handmade soaps that the two of them had made.Although they looked slightly strange as they lay there, the color of the handmade soaps was still pretty nice. She actually really felt a little unwilling to use them.Gu Jingze looked on from behind her. He pointed at those in the pile that Lin Che had made. \u201cThese are really awfully ugly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. This is called art. Do you understand it or not? It\u2019s just like Picasso\u2019s art. This is called abstract art.\u201dGu Jingze shook his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so bad with your hands and feet. Worse still, you only know how to look for excuses.\u201dLin Che turned her head back to glare at him.A maid watched them from the side. Seeing that the two of them looked very happy, she could not help but interrupt and say, \u201cMadam, Sir, did you make these? They look really good.\u201dLin Che immediately turned her head and said, \u201cYes, I made all the nice-looking ones. The ugly ones were made by Gu Jingze.\u201dShe picked up the soaps that they had made and looked at them. \u201cWhat am I going to do? I can\u2019t bear to use any of them.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze leaned in close and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to be unwilling to use them. We can just make them again in the future.\u201d He also picked up a handful to play with. He smiled and looked at her name on the soaps and said to her, \u201cYou use the ones that I made and I\u2019ll use the ones that you made.\u201dUpon hearing this, Lin Che\u2019s face instinctively turned completely red.Gu Jingze proceeded to lower his head and say, \u201cWhen you use it, won\u2019t you feel like I\u2019m touching you all over your body?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She could feel Gu Jingze\u2019s body heat get stronger.He was standing right behind her, his body pressed against her back.He could even smell the scent of shampoo from her head. Although she clearly used the same shampoo and body wash as he did, he felt that the scent on her body was different. The scent seemed to be mixed with the fragrance of a woman. He felt as if the scent was surrounding his nose and penetrating deep into his heart.He instinctively moved slightly closer again. He lowered his head and the tip of his nose nearly touched her hair.Lin Che sat rigidly upright. As she felt his breaths, she did not dare to move another inch.The maids in the Gu family were all very sensible. Seeing that the two of them were here, the maid silently retreated in no time.Only the two of them were left in the room. From above, Gu Jingze looked at the white and clear expanse of her neck. He felt the urge to somewhat touch it.Lin Che could sense a hot hand slowly moving closer to her. Thus, she turned her head abruptly and looked at Gu Jingze behind her. She glared at him and asked, \u201cHey, Gu Jingze, what are you doing?\u201dUpon being caught red-handed while trying to touch her secretly, Gu Jingze momentarily felt ashamed. But when he saw Lin Che\u2019s questioning gaze, he raised his eyebrows and asked calmly, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201dLin Che swept her eyes over his hand. \u201cStop groping me behind my back.\u201d\u201cLin Che, we\u2019re a married couple. How can you call this groping?\u201d\u201cOf course this is groping, you hoodlum!\u201dGu Jingze face was pulled tight. In an instant, he was sitting before Lin Che so closely that she got immediately surprised.She only felt Gu Jingze directly nestle up to her and suddenly kiss her once on her lips.It was like a dragonfly skimming across the water, but it still made her feel burning hot.Lin Che\u2019s face instantly turned into the color of a red apple.Gu Jingze felt that he really very much liked how Lin Che was so sensitive. Her face looked as if it would break upon being provoked. Her skin was so thin and turned red so easily.Immediately, Lin Che leaned backward and moved slightly further from his face.Gu Jingze said, \u201cYou\u2019re my wife. I\u2019ll kiss you if I want to, you got that?\u201d\u201cGet lost, hoodlum!\u201d Lin Che covered her mouth and yelled.Wickedness flashed on Gu Jingze\u2019s face. His gaze followed her beautiful neck and moved downwards. \u201cIf I\u2019m a hoodlum, I won\u2019t just stop here. You really want me to behave like one?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201dGu Jingze broke into a smile and directly kissed her lips.Lin Che let out a low breath. She only felt the tip of his tongue high-handedly rob her of all her air.Although it was not good for Gu Jingze to be in close contact with women due to his illness, he instinctively ran his hand along her frontal chest and grabbed at it.He groped at it and gently kneaded it.His breathing gradually began to quicken.Her body was really too soft. It seemed to make him hate that he could not knead it into a pulp.Lin Che felt him exert more force. The dull feeling of pain was accompanied by a strong electric current. It made her body begin tingling as well.She instinctively whined. Her body turned limp from time to time.Her body was nearly resting in his embrace. Her hands involuntarily came up to rest on his shoulders. However, she felt his hands move to her back and touch her all over.Gu Jingze felt his body burning ridiculously hot. The lust that was nearly about to burst out of his body was extremely hard for him to bear.He really wanted to just forget everything else and devour her now.However, right at this moment, he heard someone knocking on the door outside.With his face flushed red, Gu Jingze released the woman in his embrace after a lot of difficulty. He asked angrily in the direction of the door, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cSir, First Young Master is here.\u201dGu Jingming was here?Gu Jingze could only let go of her for the moment. As he looked at Lin Che\u2019s completely red face, he could not help but give it one last gentle peck again before he stood up directly.He did not take another look at her so as not to momentarily lose control and just take her.Lin Che was still in a daze. She sensed that Gu Jingze had pulled open the door and left. Her face was colored brilliantly red and full of bashfulness.She pinched herself once ruthlessly. Was she dreaming? This Gu Jingze\u2026 what exactly was he doing?Gu Jingze came down the stairs step by step. Sure enough, he saw Gu Jingming down below. Outside, the bodyguards from the National Security Agency were awaiting orders. It looked like they were here on an official business.\u201cBig Brother, this had better be something important.\u201dGu Jingming looked at Gu Jingze as he walked down. \u201cWhy? Did I interrupt something good?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cNaturally. I\u2019m not a bachelor like Big Brother. I\u2019m someone who got married. Of course, I don\u2019t let just anyone into my house. Next time, can you at least give me a heads up in advance?Gu Jingming smiled and shook his head as he looked at Gu Jingze. \u201cAlright. I understand. For a moment, I forgot that you\u2019re already married. But since you seem to be enjoying your married life right now, next time, I\u2019ll try to get used to it too.\u201dGu Jingze sat down together with Gu Jingming.Only then did Gu Jingming place the tablet computer in his hands in front of Gu Jingze. \u201cSomeone sent this to me\u2026\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head and looked at it\u2026It was Gu Jingming on the bed with a woman.It looked like it had probably been taken in secret. However, although the two of them could not be considered completely naked, their clothes were disheveled. Still, what they had just experienced was apparent.Gu Jingze immediately lifted his eyes up. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201dGu Jingming sighed. \u201cI suspect that he may have even worse clandestine photos because on that day, that day\u2026\u201dGu Jingming looked down and massaged his brow.Immediately Gu Jingze understood. Even more explosive scenes had occurred on that day.\u201cIs there a mole among the bodyguards in the National Security Agency? If not, how could anyone have taken such a picture?\u201d\u201cInvestigations are already ongoing. Right now, the primary concern is to figure out how to improve this situation.\u201d\u201cWho is this woman?\u201d Gu Jingze asked amusedly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Big Brother to even have a private life.\u201dGu Jingming raised his head and looked at him coolly. \u201cIt\u2019s Yu Minmin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s gaze sank downwards.After the two of them had discussed official matters, Gu Jingze walked him out.\u201cI\u2019ll get people to investigate this matter.\u201d Gu Jingming could not mobilize his own forces to investigate this matter while avoiding being discovered; it would only exacerbate their situation. Thus, he needed Gu Jingze to make a move.Gu Jingming nodded.Gu Jingze said, \u201cIf that\u2019s not possible, why won\u2019t Big Brother just marry her? No one can say anything about what Mr. President does with his own wife.\u201dGu Jingming looked at him. \u201cNo way.\u201dGu Jingze smiled and said, \u201cWhy? Problems with her profession? A manager will have blots on her reputation? Or is it her family affairs that are complicated?\u201dGu Jingming said, \u201cI investigated her before. Her family is fairly ordinary, but her family affairs are very complicated. She has a younger brother who relies completely on her earnings to pay his school fees. That\u2019s not a problem at all. The crux is that she has a father who likes to gamble.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze was dumbfounded as he looked at Gu Jingming. \u201cLooks like we still have to give this matter more thoughts. But it\u2019s apparent that she\u2019s definitely a civilian. The suggestion I made the last time will actually still be effective. It just depends on whether you accept it or not.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGetting married to a civilian. It\u2019s highly advantageous for your number of votes in the election this time.\u201dGu Jingming glanced at him meaningfully.

    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - It\u2019s Nothing, Go To SleepPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: It\u2019s Nothing, Go To SleepAtlas StudiosGu Jingze walked inside while mumbling, \u201cYu Minmin\u2026\u201dIn no time, he returned to Lin Che\u2019s room. She did not even dare to look at Gu Jingze and kept evading his gaze.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che and asked, \u201cOn that day, why did you and your manager go to the hotel that Big Brother was staying at?\u201dLin Che raised her head and paused before saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019re talking about that day. It was Gu Jingyu\u2019s treat that day. Everyone went to celebrate together after the closing party. I brought Sister Yu along with me. Gu Jingyu brought us there because that hotel is run by the Gu family. Who knew that Mr. President went there too?\u201dGu Jingze sat down in deep thought.Everything looked like it happened naturally. It was probably not some conspiracy. The reason Yu Minmin appeared there was even because of the third youngest brother of their own family.Furthermore, since Yu Minmin\u2019s background had already been thoroughly investigated, it was probably proof that there was no big problem. It could not be an act of espionage.But was Yu Minmin really not involved?Lin Che looked at Gu Jingze perplexedly, \u201cWhy did you start asking about this all of a sudden?\u201dGu Jingze raised his head and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing; go to sleep.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dBecause he did not talk about it, Lin Che did not shoot her mouth off and ask him.The next day.The television series was already midway through its broadcast. Lin Che\u2019s character was becoming more and more pitiful.A fair number of people came to Lin Che\u2019s Weibo page to vent their emotions.A lot of people felt that the character Chen Yihan, which Lin Che played, was really having a very difficult time. She was considerate of others in every aspect, was easygoing and dashing, and never dragged things out no matter what she did. However, she turned out to get hurt in the end each time.In comparison, because the cruel events of late were all happening to Lin Che, all of the attention on the female lead had decreased drastically.Outside, people were starting to sensationalize and smear mud on Lin Che\u2019s name. They said that Lin Che was going to win the competition against the female lead and become the person who benefited most from this television series.Fortunately, on Mu Feiran\u2019s end, they pretended that this had not happened and made no response at all either. On the contrary, a sizable number of Mu Feiran\u2019s fans came to curse at Lin Che for no reason. As she looked at these comments she was also slightly agitated.\u201cIt\u2019s seriously weird. All of these things were written by the screenwriter. It has nothing to do with me. It\u2019s just because the important events in the plot recently are related to me. Ultimately, I\u2019m still just a supporting role. Why did they all come to curse at me?\u201d Lin Che complained to Yu Minmin while they were on their way to attend a promotional activity.Yu Minmin looked at the documents in her hands. Since she had more experience, her reaction to things like this was a lot calmer than Lin Che\u2019s. Of course, she was not the one getting cursed at and she, in fact, did not get agitated as easily as Lin Che did.\u201cWith everyone in the same production, it\u2019s inevitable that there\u2019ll be someone who hates to see you receive good reviews and will intentionally smear mud on your reputation. However, it\u2019s also not easy to investigate who it is. Everyone is a competitor so it could be anyone. Investigating it will be of no damn use either.\u201dYu Minmin looked at Lin Che, \u201cAnyway, just remember this. If you yourself become famous, that will be the greatest blow to your opponents.\u201dLin Che nodded. \u201cI understand, Sister Yu.\u201dVery soon after, they arrived at the event venue.This was a talk show. The chief creators took this promotional activity very seriously because Mu Feiran was coming today as well. They hoped that Mu Feiran and Gu Jingyu would become a hot topic, so they specifically arranged for Lin Che to go up on stage only later so she would not steal screentime from the female lead.Lin Che looked at Mu Feiran and Gu Jingyu sitting together. When it came to work, the two of them were still very professional. They flirted with one another and really played their parts.Mu Feiran also proved herself to be a veteran. On stage, she appeared very relaxed and carried the flow of the program very well too.Right at this moment, Lin Li walked over to her from behind. She looked in front, snickered, and said, \u201cWhy did I hear that you\u2019re about to be suppressed?\u201dLin Che rolled her eyes and turned her head. \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201dLin Li looked at her with a face full of innocence. \u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that the case? I definitely heard that you insisted on generating hype with Gu Jingyu because you wanted to get famous. Ultimately, the attention on you nearly suppressed the attention Mu Feiran got, so you offended Mu Feiran. Lin Che, I must say that you\u2019re too eager for quick success and instant benefits. Among these people who\u2019ve been in the industry for long, which one of them doesn\u2019t have some backing? And which one of them doesn\u2019t have more tricks than you? Still, you insist on putting yourself above the female lead and the supporting roles in a television series? Can\u2019t you just properly play your supporting role?\u201dLin Che glared at Lin Li. She looked at her evil gaze and smiled coldly. \u201cYou really know it so clearly.\u201dLin Li snickered. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see? Even Mu Feiran didn\u2019t want you to generate hype with Gu Jingyu today. She intentionally separated the two of you for the purpose of the interviews.\u201dLin Che glared at her. She then saw Mu Feiran coming down.Lin Li rushed forward to welcome her.\u201cSister Feiran, you completed your earlier interview so well. Our company repeatedly instructed me to learn from you. They said that Sister Feiran is truly capable and even knows particularly well how to deal with reporters.\u201dMu Feiran smiled faintly. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not. You\u2019re being too polite.\u201dSeeing that Mu Feiran was talking to her, Lin Li quickly smiled. She turned back to glare at Lin Che before moving even closer to curry favor with Mu Feiran.Lin Che only felt that she had enough of Lin Li. She glanced at her and did not speak.Then, Mu Feiran noticed Lin Che. She smiled as she walked over and said, \u201cLin Che, I didn\u2019t see you earlier.\u201dLin Che quickly smiled. \u201cReally? I was sitting here all along.\u201dMu Feiran walked over and said warmly to Lin Che, \u201cYou performed pretty well in this television series. I think you\u2019re quite suited to play gallant roles like these.\u201d\u201cThank you for your compliment, Sister Feiran.\u201d\u201cReally, your performance was very natural.\u201d\u201cIf Sister Feiran compliments me even more, my face will turn completely red.\u201dAt this moment, the reporters caught the two of them chatting enthusiastically and quickly took pictures of them from afar.Mu Feiran said, \u201cGu Jingyu has only ever complimented very few people. Earlier, he kept praising you. Tsk, tsk. Lin Che, you\u2019re probably one of the few people he looks at.\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 his taste is so bad. Should I reflect on myself?\u201dMu Feiran began to laugh out loud.Lin Li looked on from behind and was furious.Just like this, Mu Feiran left her hanging dry here. However, she herself had gone directly to start chatting with Lin Che.Sure enough, news of this was released the next day. It stated that Mu Feiran was chatting enthusiastically with Lin Che, dispelling the rumors that they were not on good terms.Mu Feiran also publicly admitted that she felt that Lin Che was a very real and very simple-minded girl.And in the headlining photo, Lin Che and Mu Feiran were standing close to one another. At the back, Lin Li was completely reduced to a background figure.Upon seeing the headline, Lin Li was so angry that she nearly threw the tablet computer onto the ground.\u201cDo these reporters have brains?!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the other hand, Yu Minmin looked at the news and said to Lin Che who was still in the car, \u201cThe reason why Mu Feiran can support you is probably because of Gu Jingyu.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cBut why did she help me?\u201d\u201cFirst of all, she probably doesn\u2019t hate you. Otherwise, she could have just rested on her laurels and simply let the outside world speculate. There\u2019s no need for her to waste her energy. You can tell that she still quite likes you from the fact that she was willing to help you. Secondly, she\u2019s originally not a person who likes to stir up trouble. Furthermore, she\u2019s an intelligent person. She won\u2019t allow others to make use of her for no reason. This time, it was obvious that someone was using her to taint your reputation so of course, she wasn\u2019t happy.\u201dLin Che nodded her head in understanding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rest more at home and take a look at these scripts.\u201dYu Minmin proceeded to throw a huge pile of scripts at Lin Che. Looking at the pile, she quietly asked, \u201cWhat are all of these?\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cThese are for roles we hope you\u2019ll play. We\u2019re still looking. You can browse them and if there\u2019s any that interests you, let me know.\u201d\u201cWow, so many!\u201d Lin Che exclaimed in surprise.Yu Minmin smiled and replied, \u201cThese are not even all of them. The ones we selected for you are all top female lead roles. They won\u2019t go wrong.\u201d\u201cTop female lead?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m not giving you supporting roles anymore. The first step was a supporting role. Now, it\u2019s time for the next step, which is to make you a lead actress in a television drama for you to shine. Thus, these scripts are very important. Take your time to pick.\u201dThe pair walked side by side. Yu Minmin\u2019s phone suddenly rang.Yu Minmin looked at the number and her expression subtly changed. She turned to smile at Lin Che and then walked ahead to answer the call on her own.\u201cDad, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cDaughter, my good daughter. I have decided to turn over a new leaf. All these years, I have let you down. I let you and your brother suffer. I\u2019m going to quit gambling from now on.\u201dYu Minmin listened to the solemn vows on the phone and curled her lips in a smile, \u201cTell me. How much did you lose this time? How much money do you want me to give you?\u201d\u201cNot much\u2026 Not much, really. This time, I got cheated by someone. During the last game\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your stories. Just tell me the result. How much do you owe?\u201d\u201cThiry thousand\u2026\u201d\u201cThirty thousand\u2026 Dad, that\u2019s a few months\u2019 worth of my salary!\u201d\u201cMy daughter. Your father only has you. You have to help me. Otherwise, they\u2019re going to use your mother to clear the debt.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Yu Minmin took a deep breath, \u201cFor Mom. Dad, I\u2019m only doing this for my mom and brother. Please leave them alone, will you? Can you divorce Mum?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Are you still my daughter?\u201dYu Minmin hung up. When she returned outside, Lin Che noticed that Yu Minmin looked a little flustered. She asked, \u201cSister Yu, are you okay?\u201dYu Minmin smiled, \u201cI\u2019m okay; I just have personal matters. Go back and look at the scripts. I won\u2019t send you off.\u201dLin Che nodded as her gaze fell on Yu Minmin, \u201cSister Yu, I feel that you\u2019re rather mysterious sometimes.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Minmin laughed.Lin Che said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with you for so many years but I\u2019ve never heard you mention anything about your family or your personal life as a matter of fact. Everybody says you\u2019re a workaholic.\u201dYu Minmin looked at Lin Che, \u201cAnd I have never told anyone that you\u2019re Lin Li\u2019s sister and a lady from the Lin family.\u201dLin Che panicked and she quickly looked down, laughing dryly, \u201cI always felt that there\u2019s nothing much to say about that. There\u2019s no point. It\u2019s better if I fight for myself and get away from those people and the past.\u201dYu Minmin replied, \u201cAnd that is why I\u2019ve always liked you; you\u2019re not vengeful. What you said is right. There\u2019s no point in saying anything so neither have I. Remember, this society doesn\u2019t applaud failure. I never let others carry what I can carry myself. I don\u2019t want to burden others when they already have their own problems. And I don\u2019t want to add salt to my wounds\u2026\u201dYu Minmin waved her hand for Lin Che\u2019s car to pick her up.Lin Che turned back and looked at Yu Minmin. She was walking back into the building. Her back view looked somewhat lonely while she always put on a strong, unwavering front; It was so drastically different\u2026Lin Che took her pile of scripts home.Gu Jingze saw that Lin Che was carrying something and asked for someone to help her.\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Gu Jingze asked.Lin Che replied, \u201cThe company is letting me choose scripts.\u201dGu Jingze gingerly picked one up. The title read \u201cGolden Affections\u201d.What a terrible name.Lin Che sat on the sofa and poured the scripts on the table, casually flipping through them.Gu Jingze sat on the other side and also took the scripts to see.\u201cI\u2019ll help you see,\u201d Gu Jingze offered. \u201cYou can choose from all of these?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLin Che looked at him silently, \u201cDo you know what to look for in all of these?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cI have a Master\u2019s degree from McGill College.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cLiterature and acting are completely different!\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019re both arts; there must be something in common.\u201dLin Che held her scripts and raised her head to look at Gu Jingze with curiosity, \u201cBut why would a bronze-stinking businessman like you study literature?\u201dGu Jingze said without looking up, \u201cI also have a Ph.D. from Harvard Business School, a Master\u2019s degree from Yale School of Psychology and Law, and I studied management and economics at MIT. It\u2019s too bad that I only had enough time to get a Bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che raised both her hands up at him, her face filled with admiration, \u201cOh, you philomath! Let me bow down to you.\u201dGu Jingze raised his head, \u201cPhilomath?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cIt\u2019s someone who likes to study.\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cI see.\u201dLin Che asked curiously, \u201cBut how could you learn so many things with such little time? Doesn\u2019t university take four years? How did you study everything?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know? There are some universities that allow you to study more than one course at a time.\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s the point of studying so much?\u201d\u201cEverything is naturally of use. It\u2019s better to know some stuff.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed, because of your brain\u2019s capacity. You won\u2019t get it.\u201d\u201cHey, Gu Jingze. I\u2019m a university graduate myself.\u201d\u201cYou graduated from university?\u201d Gu Jingze looked at her incredulously.Lin Che asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you checked my entire background before we got married?\u201d\u201cMy assistants didn\u2019t report that kind of unnecessary information to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDid that mean her education was unnecessary?Lin Che said spitefully, \u201cI graduated from theatre school. It\u2019s also a legitimate major!\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d Gu Jingze raised an eyebrow.Lin Che felt a little guilty, \u201cOf course I graduated!\u201d\u201cReally? Then how much was your scholarship worth?\u201dLin Che felt even more guilty. She pursed her lips and thought of what to say.Gu Jingze smiled and said, \u201cIt looks like you didn\u2019t pass, after all.\u201d\u201cNo way. My graduation score was 61 points. It\u2019s a pass!\u201dGu Jingze raised his brow, \u201c61 points\u2026 Lin Che, you\u2019re such a poor student.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che took a while to realize that he was making fun of her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAren\u2019t you a cunning businessman!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like cunning businessmen like me?\u201d Gu Jingze inched closer to her, wanting to reach across and pinch her face.The truth was that he did not scorn her results. He just thought that it was more fun to provoke her.It was her admiring look that made him burst with vanity. It made him feel good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Gu Jingze moved forward. One hand was on the sofa while he grabbed her hand that was pushing him away with his other hand. He held onto her wrist and pressed her into the sofa.Shocked, Lin Che said, \u201cYou\u2026 Let go of me, Gu Jingze. This is the living room.\u201dGu Jingze looked at the shock in her eyes, her flushed cheeks and embarrassment on her face. It fascinated him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the living room? This is our home; we\u2019re husband and wife. Nobody can say anything about what we do in any room.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che pushed the man in front of her. Her hands pressed against his chest and she could feel his huge pectoral muscles. They filled her palms, even when she just touched them.Then again, every part of his body was well-defined.Lin Che was at a loss. Gu Jingze was coming down on her, looking at her struggle to get away. His lips just grazed the tip of her nose and stayed there. He was amused by her panic, slowly torturing her mind.\u201cNow tell me.

She had expected him to react fast and stop her but he did not this time\u2026Gu Jingze sat on the expensive carpet, clearly in pain.Lin Che quickly knelt down beside him on the carpet and looked at him worriedly.

You\u2019re just being shameless; there\u2019s no need to butter it up.\u201dGu Jingze smiled, but it actually still hurt.Looking at Gu Jingze\u2019s expression, Lin Che remained on the floor shyly and lowered her head, \u201cHow\u2026 Should we go to the hospital?\u201dGu Jingze looked at Lin Che and he lowered his head and whispered beside her ear, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine just rubbing it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che exclaimed, \u201cRubbing? What nonsense.\u201dOther places could be rubbed, but there\u2026 How could that part be rubbed?Gu Jingze held her wrist and pulled her closer, \u201cIf you don\u2019t try, you\u2019ll never know.\u201dLin Che thought that he was going to pull her hand down to that area when a voice came from the door.\u201cJing\u2026 Jingze, what\u2026 what are you doing?\u201dMo Huiling came at this time?Gu Jingze was shocked. He did not expect Mo Huiling to simply enter the house like that.He let go of Lin Che\u2019s hand and got up.At the side, Lin Che also quickly stood up.Gu Jingze looked at Mo Huiling with displeasure, \u201cHuiling, how can you just come in here like that?\u201dThis was his and Lin Che\u2019s home.Furthermore, he was a grown man now. It was not like when they were children and it was acceptable to enter rooms of the opposite gender.What if he was naked at home?Mo Huiling looked at the two who were behaving intimately just now.If she was not mistaken, Gu Jingze was actually pulling Lin Che\u2019s hand and not letting go?The two of them were so close that they looked like one person.Was Gu Jingze\u2019s illness\u2026 cured?Mo Huiling glanced at Lin Che with jealousy and hatred.Lin Che looked at them with interest and picked up her scripts on the table, \u201cYou two can talk. I\u2019m going to look at my scripts.\u201d\u201cLin Che\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze wanted to call her but Mo Huiling said, \u201cOkay. Thanks, Lin Che.\u201dThen, she walked over and grabbed Gu Jingze\u2019s arm.Gu Jingze looked at her hand and frowned, \u201cHuiling, let go of me first. The maids are everywhere. It\u2019s not good for them to see us like this.\u201dMo Huiling glared at him in a furious manner, \u201cAnd it\u2019s okay for you and Lin Che to be seen? I\u2019m just pulling your arm and it\u2019s not good to be seen?\u201d\u201cHuiling, she is my wife. It won\u2019t matter if anyone sees.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mo Huiling was even angrier as she bit her lips and yelled, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been intimate with you since we were kids. Everybody knew and nobody said anything then. Why is it not good now?\u201d\u201cOkay, just let go first. Let\u2019s talk outside.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s face darkened. He looked harshly at Mo Huiling.Seeing his expression, Mo Huiling dared not to say anything else and reluctantly let go.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I want to be with you every day\u2026\u201dGu Jingze looked at her hesitantly, \u201cBut Huiling, I\u2019m already married\u2026\u201dMo Huiling raised her head, \u201cYou\u2019re married but you love me, Jingze. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve fallen for her. Why else would you want to get so close to her? You two\u2026 How far have you two gone\u2026\u201dGu Jingze was not sure what that was either, but he did want to get close to Lin Che.Every time he got close to her, it made him forget everything and he followed his impulsive desires.It was a completely different feeling from being with Mo Huiling.He wondered if it was because he touched her with nothing happening to him and that was why he felt safe.However, there was an emotional connection with Mo Huiling, a mutual sense of familiarity. They were like soulmates.Gu Jingze closed his eyes and felt as if he had let Mo Huiling down. He sighed and let go of Mo Huiling\u2019s hand, \u201cHuiling, I feel like it would be best if we don\u2019t continue this anymore.\u201dMo Huiling was shocked.Gu Jingze continued, \u201cSorry. However, I don\u2019t want to waste any more of your youth. I\u2019ve already taken away so many years; I\u2019ve taken enough. I can\u2019t marry you because I can\u2019t touch you. As long as I\u2019m not cured, I won\u2019t be able to touch you at all. You\u2019ll suffer every day with me. Your family never approved of us so there was really no future for us. It\u2019s because I was too selfish that I was with you\u2026\u201dMo Huiling was shaken.Her face suddenly turned pale as she looked at Gu Jingze in disbelief.Her lips lost their color.\u201cYou\u2019ve been with me even up until my marriage; you\u2019re only wasting time, Huiling. Let\u2019s break up\u2026\u201dGu Jingze could not bear to look at Mo Huiling.After all, it was a relationship that lasted for many years.Although he was cold and ruthless in his business, he was soft-hearted outside of it.Gu Jingze stood up and was ready to leave.Mo Huiling unexpectedly grabbed his arm, tugging at him and refusing to let him go.\u201cJingze, don\u2019t leave me. Don\u2019t leave,\u201d she wailed.Gu Jingze closed his eyes, \u201cLet go, Huiling. Once you get into a new relationship, you\u2019ll forget all about us.\u201d\u201cNo, how can I forget? All these years, you were my one and only. You have become my life, Jingze. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sick; I don\u2019t care if I can\u2019t connect with you physically. I just want you by my side. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re already married. I\u2019ll wait for you. I\u2019ll wait for everyone in the Gu family and Mo family to die until there\u2019s no one who opposes our relationship. Really\u2026\u201d\u201cHuiling, what nonsense are you spouting?\u201d Gu Jingze immediately halted her from cursing others.Knowing that she was saying all those in a state of panic, he sighed and held onto Mo Huiling to calm her down.\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re doing? It\u2019s a fact that I\u2019m married. I don\u2019t know when I will get divorced. Lin Che and I\u2026 It\u2019s not that simple. We are husband and wife. We are close because\u2026 We have to live together. Thus, it\u2019s neither fair to you nor her.\u201d\u201cI know, Jingze. But without you, I will die. I just want to be able to see you, talk to you, and have your company; that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want to ever leave you. I will wait for you my whole life. I won\u2019t get married or be with any other man. So\u2026 Don\u2019t give up on me. I will really die!\u201dGu Jingze looked at Mo Huiling\u2019s face drenched in tears.He knew she loved him very, very much.It was a pity. Why could he not touch her?Mo Huiling noticed that Gu Jingze\u2019s expression had softened and finally felt happy inside.She thought,Since Lin Che could get so close to him without any problems, perhaps Gu Jingze\u2019s illness was much better.Why could she not touch him?Mo Huiling rushed forward when he was not noticing and kissed him on the lips\u2026Gu Jingze only felt her rushing over.He pushed Mo Huiling away. He was not uncomfortable, but he pushed her away in disgust.Mo Huiling flopped onto her bed. She felt angry as she looked up sadly at Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze was frantically wiping his mouth until he remembered that Mo Huiling was still there. He lowered his head and looked at her, \u201cHuiling, you\u2026\u201dMo Huiling wanted to strangle that Lin Che to death.Why was Lin Che able to get so close to Gu Jingze when she could not?Gu Jingze was also furious. He never thought that Mo Huiling would kiss him out of the blue.\u201cHuiling, I told you I\u2019m married. How could you do that\u2026\u201dShe was aware that he had never been close to a woman. She was also aware that by doing that, his illness might act up. He could understand why she behaved haphazardly like this.However, he already told her that he was married; he could not be unfair to all three parties. Yet, she still did that.He was mad. He looked seriously at Mo Huiling before getting up and walking out.Mo Huiling was scared as she watched Gu Jingze leave like that. However, she was afraid to chase him. She was afraid that in a fit of anger, he would not want to see her again.Gu Jingze soon arrived at Chen Yucheng\u2019s place.He quickly brushed his teeth but his mouth still felt uncomfortable.He could not tell if it was his mind or his body playing tricks on him, but he really felt uncomfortable. He brushed his teeth again. It did not work. He brushed them again.Chen Yucheng heard the noise inside and knocked on the door, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. It\u2019s just a kiss and you\u2019re going to use up the whole tube of toothpaste? Your mouth will really get injured if you do that.\u201dGu Jingze opened the door forcefully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis grave expression immediately shut Chen Yucheng up, \u201cMr. Gu, I didn\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m saying that since she is someone you\u2019re familiar with, it shouldn\u2019t be that bad, right? Why not control your mentality? Then, you\u2019ll be able to tell if you were mentally or physically uncomfortable, right?\u201dGu Jingze suppressed his emotions. He wanted to know too but he just felt too dirty and uncomfortable. When he thought about it, he wanted to brush his teeth again.However, it was strange that when he and Lin Che kissed\u2026He only felt nostalgic. He would even swallow her saliva without hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Look, there is no rash. The medicine might have helped this time but it\u2019s more likely that it\u2019s because you\u2019re still not used to touching women.\u201dGu Jingze looked up at Chen Yucheng.\u201cSigh. Yucheng, can you call other types of doctors over too?\u201d\u201cOther types? My expertise is not limited. I can still look at small matters like this. Whatever questions you have, Mr. Gu, you can just ask me.\u201dGu Jingze raised his dark eyes and looked at Chen Yucheng in disdain.Still, he hesitated before saying, \u201cI have\u2026 some questions regarding the private parts\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a long pause.Chen Yucheng looked at Gu Jingze silently, \u201cMr. Gu, was last night too intense? I understand that the two of you are newlyweds and it\u2019s your first romantic involvement, but it\u2019s not good for your body if you get too intense. You have to show some restraint for certain things.\u201dChen Yucheng was surprised that he could get injured down there. Just how intense was it?Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened, \u201cLin Che and I do not have that kind of relationship. We\u2019ve never been in the same bed!\u201dChen Yucheng looked at Gu Jingze incredulously, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious? You haven\u2019t had a breakthrough?\u201dGu Jingze glared at him silently.Chen Yucheng added, \u201cNow, that is strange. I thought you two already\u2026\u201dHow could he control himself while living together with a woman? He should have been like a blazing fire\u2026He suddenly sympathized Gu Jingze; this man must have restrained himself so much. He was so patient!Furthermore, he had seen Lin Che before. She was fair, clean, and looked inviting. It must not be easy for him to control himself when he had a beautiful little wife like that.\u201cMr. Gu, I think it is also not good for your body to restrain yourself so much. Appropriate exercise will be greatly beneficial for your emotional health and your old illness.\u201d\u201cOkay, since there\u2019s not a lot to do here, your job is done.\u201dGu Jingze was even more frustrated by his words.Chen Yucheng made a sound, but Gu Jingze had already turned his back and walked out. He could only shake his head helplessly.It was also a problem to be too honest and proper\u2026Realistically speaking, outsiders would not say anything if a man like him had more than one woman at his side.He need not be so righteous.Gu Jingze knew that he did not want to disclose anything about his relationship with Lin Che, her feelings, and other small details to Chen Yucheng.He simply did not want to tell him.As if Lin Che was only his and he didn\u2019t want to share her with anyone else.The secrets between him and Lin Che belonged to him. He did not want to tell anyone.To him, it would be like letting other people take away a part of Lin Che.It was a strange feeling, but it was something that was deeply engraved in his heart and could not be removed.When it came to certain things, he just could not stop himself, even though he knew it was wrong\u2026Just then, his phone rang.Gu Jingze looked down. It was Mo Huiling.After calming down, he decided to forgive Mo Huiling. He understood that her actions were out of her love for him. It was out of her character.He knew Mo Huiling since they were young. She was a little stubborn and had a bad temper sometimes, but she was not a bad person.He picked up the call.\u201cJingze\u2026 Are you still angry?\u201d she sounded so pitiful.\u201cNo,\u201d Gu Jingze sighed.\u201cThen\u2026 Where are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m at Dr. Chen\u2019s,\u201d he told her truthfully.Mo Huiling knew he went to Chen Yucheng when he had a problem. He had been his personal doctor for many years.Mo Huiling said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I make your illness act up? Honestly, this is my responsibility. I lost control and forgot about your illness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze replied.Mo Huiling continued, \u201cThis time, it\u2019s really my fault. I won\u2019t do it again. I know I shouldn\u2019t just kiss you like that.\u201d\u201cHuiling\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026 I said I will get a divorce but right now, I\u2019m not divorced.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I know. I will wait for you. I\u2019ll wait for the day until you part ways with her for good.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll wait for you, Gu Jingze. I love you. I\u2019ll do anything for you!\u201dWhen he hung up, Gu Jingze felt a little guilty towards Mo Huiling.However, he was also helpless.On the other side.When the call ended, Mo Huiling threw the phone onto the floor, immediately smashing it into pieces.The maid at the side did not dare to look at Mo Huiling\u2019s face.Mo Huiling angrily thought,This Lin Che really deserved to die.She was clearly the rightful wife of Gu Jingze. She was clearly the admirable Mrs. Gu.Everybody in the circle knew how she was with Gu Jingze for so many years. But then, he married someone else!What an embarrassment.After all, Gu Jingze was the type of man that was hard to give up.She thought before that it was better to leave him if they could not live as husband and wife. But after getting to know so many men, none were good enough for her to give up on Gu Jingze.No one could compare to Gu Jingze or the Gu family.The Gu family was the cream of the crop of all families in this country. Gu Jingze was the cream of the crop of all men in this country. If not him, who else could give her the best life and make the entire country envy her?Gu Jingze returned home but did not see Lin Che who usually laid on the sofa. Curious, he asked the maid, \u201cWhere is Madam?\u201dThe maid replied, \u201cMadam said she was tired and went to sleep early.\u201dGu Jingze suspected that something was not right.How could she be so tired this early? It did not fit Lin Che who was usually a night owl.Then, he opened the door to the bedroom and entered. He saw Lin Che lying on the bed. She had really gone to sleep, but she was curled up like a prawn. It was different from her usual sleeping position.Gu Jingze\u2019s eyes moved around as he walked towards the bed.\u201cAre you asleep?\u201d he asked.\u201cHm,\u201d the figure in the bed replied.Gu Jingze smiled, \u201cYou were asleep but you can still answer? Are you talking in your sleep?\u201dEmbarrassed, Lin Che opened her eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe felt Gu Jingze already lift up the blanket and casually settle himself beside her.\u201cYou\u2026 Gu Jingze, who said you could come in?\u201dLin Che knew that he had gone out with Mo Huiling. Although she did not know where he went, she was certain that they were together all this time.\u201cIt\u2019s my bed.

She pushed Gu Jingze\u2019s hand away, \u201cI would be crazy to be jealous! Do you have dementia or something? Our marriage is fake. It\u2019s not like we are really husband and wife!\u201dGu Jingze fell back on the bed and looked at Lin Che as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re really not jealous?\u201dLin Che snorted, \u201cOf course not!\u201dLin Che sat up and glanced at Gu Jingze, \u201cIt\u2019s all just an act. I know I\u2019m good at it, but don\u2019t mistake it for reality! I\u2019m a professional actress. Of course, I will do my best to play the role of a good wife.\u201dGu Jingze took a deep breath. Somehow, he could not help but feel a little disappointed.\u201cAlright,\u201d Gu Jingze sat down and said, \u201cI thought that you were jealous and avoiding me on purpose.\u201d\u201cHa, you\u2019re getting more narcissistic.\u201dGu Jingze asked, \u201cIs there anything wrong with being narcissistic?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Lin Che patted herself and also sat down. The two of them sat side by side on the bed. As the bed was huge, there was still a lot of space, even with them sitting there.Gu Jingze looked at her, \u201cNarcissism means loving oneself. If you can\u2019t even love yourself, how can you expect someone else to love you?\u201d\u201cHa, bullshit,\u201d Lin Che looked at him, \u201cBig Boss Gu has plenty of people who love him; he doesn\u2019t need to love himself.\u201d\u201cSince when do I have many people loving me?\u201d Gu Jingze asked.Lin Che replied, \u201cThat Miss Mo or something. I believe there\u2019s more than just her.\u201dThe mention of Mo Huiling reminded Gu Jingze of the complicated events that happened. He was starting to feel vexed again.The original plan was simple. He and Lin Che would marry and agree to not disrupt each other\u2019s lives and maintain a good relationship until they divorced.However, the situation has progressed a lot further.Gu Jingze said, \u201cMy relationship with Huiling is not what you think it is.\u201d\u201cWhat do I think it is?\u201d Lin Che tilted her head and looked at him.Gu Jingze continued, \u201cHuiling and I have known each other since we were young. We knew each other for almost thirty years, but we have never ever crossed that line. I promise you that as long as I\u2019m married to you, I will never step over the boundaries with her. I\u2019ll only treat her as a friend and as a younger sister.\u201dLin Che hastily said, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. You don\u2019t have to promise me anything, really. I won\u2019t get angry. You were originally with her anyway.\u201dHowever, she did feel grateful that he wanted to make that promise.Even though the promise may not mean anything, it meant that he still respected her and was considerate of her feelings.Lin Che looked at him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that for me. We already agreed to stay out of each other\u2019s personal lives.\u201dGu Jingze turned to her, \u201cWe did agree at the start but we are already married after all. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for you. You\u2019re only 23 and this is your first marriage. You shouldn\u2019t be living with all this mess. I may not be able to give you a complete marriage, but at least I won\u2019t betray you in other aspects. At least these memories won\u2019t be so bad.\u201dLin Che lifted her head and stared at him. She laughed nervously, \u201cNo, this was all because of me. Still, I am really thankful for you. Won\u2019t Miss Mo be angry though?\u201d\u201cFrom the moment I chose to marry you, she was angry. I know it\u2019s also not easy for her, but we had no choice but to marry.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell her that your family threatened you with her and you were forced to marry me for her sake?\u201d\u201cForget it. There\u2019s no point in telling her that. I told her from the start that she had the choice to leave me and start a new life. I would have accepted it because this was all my fault too. If I told her, it would be even more difficult for her to let go. I\u2019d rather she have the choice to leave and live her own life.\u201dLin Che blamed herself even more, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all my fault\u2026\u201d\u201cAt the beginning, I wanted to blame you and hate you, but after thinking it through, I realized that the both of us were caught in this marriage. Both of us were forced and there was nothing to blame on you,\u201d Gu Jingze added, \u201cYou\u2019re still young. You could have experienced love with another man but because of our marriage, you had to give up all of these. So you don\u2019t have to apologize to me. This is not because of you. I guess it\u2019s just a twist of fate that led us to today.\u201dLin Che looked down and yawned. Hugging her knees, she was beginning to feel drowsy.Gu Jingze said, \u201cSo if you have anything you need, just tell me. I\u2019ll be happy to fulfill your requests.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. You don\u2019t need to make it up to me. I have gained a lot now; I can\u2019t ask for a perfect life where I get everything I want. I have a place to sleep, countless people looking after me, and time to focus on my career. I\u2019m already satisfied,\u201d she gently laid down on the bed and covered herself with the blanket as she said softly, \u201cYou need to communicate nicely with Mo Huiling. She is a girl, after all. And girls just want to be coddled. All that you said to me just now\u2026 let\u2019s leave it at that.

Even though you\u2019re so handsome and rich, you have just one Miss Mo who can\u2019t leave you alone. You totally deserve to not be able to find a wife. You don\u2019t even know how to coddle a girl. When a girl says no, don\u2019t you ever take it for real. When a girl says that she\u2019s not angry with you, she\u2019s lying. When a girl says don\u2019t buy something because it\u2019s too expensive, she\u2019ll kill you if you really don\u2019t buy it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cMy psychology class did mention these before.\u201d\u201cHahaha, talking to girls with psychology. If psychological research can fully understand a girl, the subject is not a girl at all. If you use psychological theories to coddle a girl, you\u2019re destined to be forever alone\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze frowned as he said, \u201cIs it that complicated? But why do girls want to be coddled?\u201dAs he turned to look at Lin Che, she was already lying on the bed with her eyes closed. Her breathing had already slowed down to a steady rhythm.How heartless\u2026Gazing at her pure sleeping face, he could not resist gently sweeping the hair on her forehead to the side. He lifted the blanket, leaned on one side, and lied down next to her. Looking sideways at her clear face, he felt a world of calmness. His heart also felt at peace as he lay there and closed his eyes, slowly drifting off to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had both legs on his body. Her exceptional sleeping posture made her sleep horizontally.Strangely enough, he did not feel her legs move at all the previous night.Lin Che, who was too tired from yesterday, was still in a daze.\u201cWhat\u2026 What time is it\u2026\u201d Lin Che scratched at her feet drowsily. One leg was plopped onto Gu Jingze\u2019s face.Gu Jingze\u2019s face darkened as he immediately sat up. Looking speechlessly at Lin Che, he exclaimed, \u201cLin Che, what are you doing?!\u201dLin Che suddenly looked up to see Gu Jingze sitting on the bed. He looked awful as if he just swallowed a fly.\u201cAh, sorry\u2026\u201d she scratched her head and took her phone to see. It was only six in the morning.She sprawled back onto the bed, \u201cMy God, it\u2019s so early. Why did you wake me up?\u201d\u201cThe early bird catches the worm. Also, waking up early makes you feel more energized; it\u2019s good for thinking,\u201d Gu Jingze placed his feet on the floor and entered the bathroom with vigor.Lin Che took one look and thought that he was commendable.No matter how late he slept the previous night, he would always wake up at six and not a minute later. He always got up immediately and then came back at night to continue working until it was late before resting.Lin Che thought that he was definitely not getting the required seven hours of sleep daily. He probably got six hours at most.Only during filming, Lin Che would not sleep for days. However, whenever she had the chance, she certainly slept like a log.She thought that it must be tough for Gu Jingze.Lying there, Lin Che could not recall what they were doing the night before they ended up together on the bed. Since nothing happened anyway, she soon fell back asleep.Gu Jingze returned only to find that Lin Che had gone back into deep sleep.This time, her whole body was flipped over and she was lying face down.Gu Jingze shook his head helplessly. He took the blanket and carefully tucked her in before heading out.In the afternoon, Lin Che watched as the maid washed the car. She thought that it would be fun to join in.The maid saw Lin Che approach and immediately put down the water, afraid that it would get onto her.Lin Che said nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I want to help you guys wipe. Back at my home, I used to do this with my nanny. I do an exceptionally professional job.\u201d\u201cMadam, you really don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m the madam, so listen to me.\u201dHearing what she said, the maid had no other choice.When Gu Jingze returned, he put down his clothes and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Madam?\u201dThe maid looked hesitantly to the backyard and said, \u201cMadam is\u2026 washing the car.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingze entered the backyard and saw Lin Che vigorously wiping the back of the car. Her actions were almost professional.Watching her happily working hard, Gu Jingze shook his head. Half of her skirt was wet and sweat droplets formed on her face. However, she was not afraid of looking unglamorous or afraid of getting tanned. Exposed to the sun, she was like her own ray of sunshine. Anyone looking at her would have cheered up instantly.He seemed to have been infected by her as his mood was lifted.The maid noticed Gu Jingze was not unhappy and was actually smiling. He looked like he was in a good mood now. She said beside him, \u201cMadam never put on any airs with us. She even helped us with our work. She is such a nice person.\u201dGu Jingze turned to her and smiled before walking over to Lin Che.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked curiously.Lin Che looked up, \u201cI\u2019m working. Labor is my pride.\u201dGu Jingze smiled, \u201cHow do you know how to clean cars?\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cThe Lin family has cars too, okay? Back there, I used to clean them. I even know how to wax.\u201d\u201cAre you that good?\u201d\u201cOf course. I know many things!\u201d Lin Che proudly brushed her nose with her thumb and left bubbles on the tip of her nose.Gu Jingze laughed and reached over to wipe them off.Lin Che rubbed her nose adorably and looked at Gu Jingze, revealing an enchanting smile.Gu Jingze felt his heart beat faster.Without any thoughts, he gazed at her face. There was a warm, fuzzy feeling.\u201cAh, that\u2019s the good thing about branded cars. Once I\u2019m done cleaning this, it\u2019ll be as good as new. Beautiful,\u201d Lin Che looked at the Porsche worth millions of dollars.Gu Jingze suddenly realized that she did not have her own car. He asked, \u201cDo you know how to drive?\u201d\u201cMe? No\u2026\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cRight, you\u2019re too dumb. It was pointless to ask.\u201d\u201cHey, I\u2019m busy keeping myself alive. I don\u2019t have time to learn, okay?\u201dGu Jingze smiled and thought that she would not look nice driving this Porsche. She would look great in a smaller car.\u201cYou should get a car and start learning. It\u2019ll be much more convenient for you.\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cYes! I\u2019ll get one when I\u2019ve saved up enough!\u201dShe was earning quite a lot now. But even if she were to save up, she could only afford an average car.Gu Jingze declared, \u201cFine. We would have to wait forever for you to save that much. Let\u2019s go buy you a car.\u201d\u201cHuh? Now?\u201d\u201cYes, this is great timing because I\u2019m free now. Hurry up.\u201d\u201cOh no, it\u2019s too much. I still have to use your money.\u201d\u201cAre you not going to buy it then?\u201dLin Che\u2019s eyes lit up. Of course, she would take the opportunity. She laughed hastily, \u201cNo, buy buy buy. Of course, I\u2019ll buy.\u201dGu Jingze said quietly, \u201cCan you control yourself?\u201d\u201cForget that. I have to think about my future after we divorce. Although I\u2019m using your money now, I still have to fend for myself in the future.\u201dGu Jingze frowned. He suddenly disliked how she mentioned a \u2018divorce\u2019 so casually.\u201cMoney-minded.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time I only thought about money. You better get used to it.\u201dGu Jingze brought Lin Che to the 4S shop.The shop owner saw Gu Jingze arrive and quickly went out to greet him personally. He looked respectfully at the two of them, \u201cMr. Gu, are you getting a car for this lady?\u201d\u201cYes. This is my wife,\u201d he turned to introduce her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe shop owner was shocked and quickly said, \u201cNo wonder I found Madam so familiar.\u201dOf course, she looked familiar because she was getting famous recently.The shop owner asked, \u201cWhat type of car does Mrs Gu like?\u201dLin Che had no opinion on this, so she turned to look expectantly at Gu Jingze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not too expensive or other people will get jealous.\u201dGu Jingze browsed through the catalog and said, \u201cThis will be good. Get a yellow one so it\u2019ll be bright and you won\u2019t get lost on the road.\u201d Gu Jingze looked at her mockingly.Lin Che\u2019s face darkened, \u201cI\u2019m not a pig. I won\u2019t get lost on the road.\u201dAs she said that, she looked down at the catalog and saw that Gu Jingze was referring to a Porsche 911. She was shocked.She thought when he meant something not too expensive, he would be talking about a car worth about 200,000 yuan. She did not expect his definition of \u2018not too expensive\u2019 to be\u2026\u201cGu Jingze, isn\u2019t this too expensive?\u201d Lin Che asked.Gu Jingze replied, \u201cWhy would this be too expensive?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThis is a few million. Is that not expensive?\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIf that was true, then hiring a chauffeur for you would be actually even more expensive.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dGu Jingze continued, \u201cChauffeurs for the Gu family have an annual income of three million yuan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Che initially thought that they were living hard lives and that he was always just so responsible and treated her well. Now she knew\u2026 they were rich people too.Gu Jingze had already gestured for the staff to order the car.The shop owner gleefully proceeded to make the order.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che and said, \u201cYou wait here for a while. I\u2019m going to pick up the car and check it for you.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201dGu Jingze turned around and lightly touched her nose, \u201cBe good and wait here. The car needs to be test-driven. If it\u2019s not safe, it\u2019s best that you not be there.\u201dLin Che could not help but feel embarrassed when he touched her nose.She looked on as Gu Jingze left before she turned back.With nothing else to do, she walked around the shop. This was a chain store for luxury cars. Besides selling cars, there was a supermarket selling car parts at the side. Catered to wealthy customers, the shop was styled to look like a posh caf\u00e9 at a hotel lobby. There were cushioned seats everywhere and coffee tables with beautiful decor on top of them.Lin Che noticed that some snacks were placed on the table and she quickly took some. She might as well eat them.The staff was courteous to Lin Che, knowing that she came with Gu Jingze. Three or four of them were shadowing her, ready if she ended up needing them. They were also looking enviously at her.Although Lin Che was already a star, she acted in only one television series and it was in ancient settings. Those old costumes might have made it difficult to recognize her, so the staff did not know who she was exactly.Just as Lin Che was grabbing snacks, she heard a familiar, classy voice ringing from behind. She immediately turned to look.\u201cLin Li, to make you come here with me. This Qin Qing, I have no idea what he\u2019s so busy with. I wanted to buy a car and it\u2019s unfortunate that you had to accompany me instead,\u201d Chen Meili, a classy looking madam of the Qin family, was being held by Lin Li as they entered the place.Beside them were several other attentive staff.Everybody recognized Lin Li and knew that Chen Meili was a madam of the Qin family. They tended to both of them with great care and respect.Lin Che did not expect to meet Lin Li and Chen Meili here.The mother and daughter-in-law were here to buy a car too\u2026Like enemies on a narrow road.Just then, Chen Meili raised her head and saw Lin Che standing there.\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t that Lin Che? I\u2019m not seeing things, right? Is that her?\u201dLin Li also looked up and saw Lin Che. She was surprised.Chen Meili knew Lin Che since she was young as Lin Che and Qin Qing went to the same school. Lin Che would always come over and play with Qin Qing, but Chen Meili always disliked Lin Che and wished that she would not keep playing with him.Chen Meili walked over. Some people still did not recognize Lin Che.Looking from afar, it looked like her. As she got closer, it looked like something had changed about her.Lin Che had become much prettier as if she had blossomed. She used to be shabby like a small family jade but now, she looked natural and pure. Her clothes were elegant. Her whole body seemed to be surrounded by a clear stream. She looked very good.However, Chen Meili still disliked her, \u201cLin Che, what are you doing here? Are you buying a car?\u201dThere was a hint of mockery in her tone because she knew that the cars here were not affordable for just anybody.Lin Che looked at Chen Meili; she was older after all. She held herself back, \u201cYes, Aunty Qin. What a coincidence. You two carry on; I\u2019m going over there to look.\u201d\u201cHey, Lin Che. I still want to talk to you. Why are you running away?\u201d Chen Meili stopped Lin Che in her tracks.Lin Che turned back.Chen Meili tested her, \u201cHave you met our Qin Qing recently?\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cReally never? Or are you faking it?\u201d Chen Meili scoffed.Lin Che frowned and noticed the hatred in Chen Meili\u2019s voice, \u201cAunty Qin, if you have something to say, just shoot.\u201dChen Meili was unhappy to see Lin Che holding her head high with disdain on her face. She said, \u201cLin Che, I heard you got into trouble the other time and were brought to the police station. They said that it was our Qin Qing who helped get you out?\u201dSo it was about that.Qin Qing did help that time.Lin Che turned to look at Chen Meili and said, \u201cYes, he helped me.\u201dChen Meili looked at her and hit the table angrily, \u201cLin Che, don\u2019t mind Aunty\u2019s words, but Qin Qing is already engaged to your sister. He is now your brother-in-law.\u201dLin Che stared at Chen Meili strangely, \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with my brother-in-law helping me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chen Meili looked at Lin Che scornfully, \u201cI\u2019ve been aware of your feelings toward Qin Qing for a long time, but I\u2019m warning you; you don\u2019t deserve our Qin Qing. He will never like an illegitimate child like you. What\u2019s gotten into you now? Just because you\u2019re a celebrity and you have money, you think you can start to think about Qin Qing again? Well, I can tell you now. No door is open for you.\u201dLin Che listened to her ridicule and smiled silently.At the side, Lin Li tried to look humble in front of her future mother-in-law, but she could not conceal the smugness in her gentle eyes. Looking at Lin Che with a smirk on her mouth, she was enjoying this exchange.\u201cAunty Qin, you must be mistaken. Qin Qing is just a friend to me and even more so my relative now. Although Qin Qing is a good guy, he\u2019s nothing exceptional. All girls may like him, but I have my own boyfriend now. I have no interest in Qin Qing at all!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ve seen you before when you were young and always doing homework with Qin Qing. Our pure and innocent Qin Qing said you were a good person, but I already knew your motive.\u201dLin Che was stunned.Bringing up her childhood made her embarrassed and sad.The situation may have been the same but people have changed over time Lin Che\u2019s face darkened slightly as she looked at Chen Meili, \u201cI treated him well because I had a motive?\u201d\u201cNothing good comes out of an illegitimate child like you. You\u2019re untrue to Qin Qing. You saw that he was too pure and innocent and you thought that he would be an easy target for you. You thought that you could get hold of Qin Qing and live a good life? Ah, I know your wretched little idea all too well. I have walked more than the bridge you crossed. It\u2019s too bad that the Qin family is not that easy to enter.\u201dLin Che bit her lip and clenched her fists. Thinking about her past feelings, her face turned pale and her lips started to become green.Her past feelings about Qin Qing were something that she could never forget or ignore. Especially when everybody else could tell how she felt but Qin Qing had no clue\u2026She felt pathetic.Chen Meili realized that she was just sitting there drinking coffee but with no car in sight. She smiled at the staff and said, \u201cHey, you guys really don\u2019t know how to look at people. Does she look like someone who can afford a luxury car? She\u2019s probably only here to be a freeloader. She thinks she\u2019s a celebrity, so she can afford a luxury car? Ah, judging by her, can she even drive a good car? Does she even deserve one?\u201d\u201cAunty Qin, don\u2019t go overboard!\u201d Lin Che stood up and glared angrily at Chen Meili.Chen Meili held Lin Li\u2019s hand for support as she got up and proudly walked over to Lin Che\u2019s side. She said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a good look at yourself first? Let\u2019s go, Lin Li. This place has been tainted with the putrid smell of poverty. It stinks so bad.\u201d\u201cAt least it smells better than an old woman like you,\u201d Lin Che retaliated.Chen Meili was shocked and turned around in a huff. She scrunched up her face, making the wrinkles more obvious, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d She was so furious that she wanted to lunge at her. The staff hurriedly held her back.Chen Meili went away still cursing and swearing.Lin Che sat down frustrated. She watched Lin Li leave as she turned back and smiled in ridicule. Although Lin Che managed to agitate Chen Meili, she was still in an ugly mood.Gu Jingze entered from behind and saw Lin Che sitting there looking sorrowful. His initially neutral face suddenly turned cold.His deep eyes were clouded.\u201cLin Che,\u201d he called from behind.Lin Che turned around in surprise, \u201cIs the car all ready?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her, \u201cWhat were they saying just now?\u201dHe could see them from afar but he could not hear their conversation.Lin Che forced a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dGu Jingze felt uncomfortable seeing her try to put on a strong front.His expression grew sullen. He stared at Lin Che and did not make a move.Lin Che said, \u201cI\u2019m already used to it. Whatever nonsense she says doesn\u2019t affect me. If I really fought with her, the headlines tomorrow would all be about how I bullied an old lady.\u201dShe spoke as she forced her smile. It did not look good.She always had a strong front, but that smile somehow made Gu Jingze\u2019s heart prickly.It was as if seeing her unhappy only made him unhappy too.He tightened his lips and pulled Lin Che\u2019s hand. He looked at her, \u201cDo you want to see them unhappy?\u201d\u201cOf course I do\u2026 But what are you going to do?\u201dGu Jingze let her hand rest on her arm and smiled faintly at her. However, with that strong face, Lin Che could tell that he was in a different mood.She felt that his face was a lot darker than usual and his eyes had become abysmal like a dark sky.\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m just going to let you watch a good show,\u201d the corners of his mouth curled up into a smirk that any woman would find sexy. It harbored a sense of mischief and calamity.Before Lin Che could react, Gu Jingze was already bringing her with him and walking for over ten minutes. She overheard someone say, \u201cThat person just damaged our Sir\u2019s car.\u201d \u201dLin Che listened to Chen Meili\u2019s sharp voice that followed, \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?

We\u2019ve called the police and are waiting for them to handle this, but she\u2019s making noise and refusing to admit that she did it.\u201dLin Li and Chen Meili turned around to see Gu Jingze dressed all in black. Noble and elegant, he was like a god.Chen Meili was shocked, especially more so to see Lin Che actually holding onto his arm and standing right beside him.Lin Li\u2019s eyes initially lit up but it turned to jealousy as she looked at Lin Che.This Lin Che was standing beside Gu Jingze\u2026 What an eyesore.Chen Meili was shocked at first, but she saw Gu Jingze only take a brief glance at her. He could not be bothered to look at her again and lazily said, \u201cSince the police are coming, let them handle it. What are you guys making noise for?\u201dChen Meili snorted loudly and again exclaimed, \u201cThe Qin family doesn\u2019t care for a car like this that\u2019s only a few million. Why would I even want to touch it? Also, you think calling the police will solve the problem? I just want to see what the police can do with me. Furthermore, I don\u2019t believe you will still be able to put the blame on me!\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression was indifferent. It made Chen Meili feel even more guilty.When she finished, Gu Jingze grunted. Without even looking at Chen Meili in the eye, he said to his security guard, \u201cTell the police that I dislike this person very much. She is in the wrong but is refusing to repent. Let the police handle this properly and have them at least lock her up for a few days before she disrupts the peace again.\u201dChen Meili panicked. Her face immediately turned purple.She wanted to say something but Lin Li stopped her.She looked at Gu Jingze jealously. Although she was reluctant, she quickly whispered in Chen Meili\u2019s ear, \u201cMother\u2026 This is Gu Jingze.

When Qin Qing finds out, he\u2019ll definitely come after you!\u201dLittle slut?Gu Jingze gave a cold look at the bodyguard at his side. The bodyguard immediately reached out his hand and hit Chen Meili\u2019s face with a loud slap.Chen Meili\u2019s cheek burned.

You better believe that our Qin family won\u2019t let you off,\u201d she lunged at him but was blocked by the huge bodyguard.Gu Jingze\u2019s face was expressionless. He said without a single drop of warmth in his voice, \u201cSorry, my bodyguard got too agitated. Perhaps, it\u2019s because I mentioned that if anybody offends Miss Lin, their mouths should be ripped off. They don\u2019t have a lot of manners as they only know how to follow my orders.

This madam wants to make a report.\u201d\u201cSir, the police have arrived.\u201dJust then, a group of men clad in police uniform briskly walked over from behind.Chen Meili saw them and hurriedly said, \u201cPolice, they are framing me and stopping me from leaving! One of them even hit me; I need my injury assessed!\u201dThe police looked at Chen Meili in a puzzled manner.Chen Meili added, \u201cI\u2019m the madam of the Qin family. I want to see your chief.

It was still so hard to believe.Did he really have the whole world in his hand?These people did not care about the Qin family\u2019s status and were still taking her away.At the side, Lin Li dared to not say a word as she stared at the arrogant Gu Jingze until her eyes almost popped out. She was busy pulling Chen Meili, looking up pitifully, popping out her chest, and purposely revealing a part of her shoulders. Fortunately, she had put on her best makeup today. She looked at the tall and mighty Gu Jingze with a hint of greed. She could not control the admiration on her face. She never thought that she would cross paths with a top caliber person like that. The Qin family was already considered an untouchable B-lister. Anyone would already be envious and in awe. However, compared to the Gu family, the Qin family was nothing. After all, the Gu family was the cream of the crop. A layperson would never be able to get to there. One could only dream of it.But today, a man like him was right in front of her. He was even so good-looking. How could anyone not fall for him?She fluttered her eyelids and made her voice extra seductive, \u201cMr. Gu, I hope you will let Aunty go on my behalf. She was just careless and she didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201dChen Meili thought that Lin Li was so nice, willing to offend Gu Jingze on her behalf. She looked at Lin Li gratefully.Gu Jingze did not bother to look at Lin Li for even one second. She was deliberately putting on her charm but he dismissed it and scornfully asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dLin Li was taken aback.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m Lin Che\u2019s sister. We met once before. I\u2019m also a celebrity like Lin Che,\u201d Lin Li took a step forward.But the bodyguard stepped in front of her and blocked her from getting closer.Gu Jingze snorted and looked at Lin Li, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know celebrities. Lin Che has no sister. I\u2019ve never heard of her.\u201d As he said that, he naturally grabbed Lin Che\u2019s waist and made them appear intimate.Following that, he turned to the police, \u201cI\u2019ll let you guys handle the rest of these people.\u201dFrom behind, the shop\u2019s staff hastily asked Gu Jingze, \u201cMr. Gu, what about this car? Shall I help you cover the scratch?\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cHow can I still give this damaged thing to my woman? Especially when it was touched by someone else. I don\u2019t want Lin Che to feel dirty in this car. Scrap it and help me order another car that\u2019s exactly like this. Deliver it straight to my place.\u201dEveryone there listened in surprise and gazed at Gu Jingze who nonchalantly walked off with Lin Che without turning back. Everyone except those taking care of Chen Meili soon cleared the area too. The staff looked on with great admiration.It really was not an exaggeration; Gu Jingze was amazing. He was too handsome and too charming.That Lin Che was way too lucky to be able to be by his side.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Li gritted her teeth and stared hatefully at Lin Che\u2019s back. She wanted to rip Lin Che into pieces.When she looked at Gu Jingze, she was in a daze. Her eyes were glossed over in confusion and chaos. It was her first time seeing such a charming man, especially one so powerful. He was definitely the country\u2019s unrivaled wealthiest.Chen Meili was mad. She was still in shock even when she was being taken away. She let herself be played by that little brat, Lin Che.The worst part was that Lin Che had Gu Jingze at her side. She had no way of taking Lin Che down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She turned to look behind and saw that everyone had left. It looked like Chen Meili was really being taken to the police station. She let out her breath and tilted her head in surprise at Gu Jingze.In Lin Che\u2019s eyes, the Qin family were already a good family. Otherwise, Lin Li would not want to get close to Qin Qing and finally marry him.Lin Che said, \u201cWow, how did the car get scratched? Did they really do it? How did you manage it?\u201dGu Jingze lowered his head and said, \u201cAll of this doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just a little game. If you want someone to falter, there\u2019s always a way.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cMore importantly, I have the ability to put the blame on her and leave her speechless because I am Gu Jingze.\u201dLin Che looked at him in wonder, \u201cIt\u2019s so good to be rich, but is it really okay to do that?\u201dShe was worried about offending the Qin family which might potentially cause problems.Gu Jingze looked at Lin Che, \u201cThe effort I put into making so much money is for moments like this, so I don\u2019t get bullied by anybody.\u201dLin Che looked at him with bright eyes. She did not realize his hegemony could be so powerful. Her heart bubbled with admiration.Lin Che worshipped Gu Jingze even more as she looked at him. Her eyes were sparkling.Gu Jingze felt accomplished when he saw how she pleased she looked like a kitten showered with affection.Especially being worshipped by her, he felt that no matter how taxing it was to run the family business, it was all worth it.It felt satisfying, like a husband getting praised by his wife after a hard day\u2019s work.Lin Che was a strange person. Even by worshipping just a dog\u2019s leg, she looked extremely sincere.Lin Che asked, \u201cBut are you really going to scrap the car? It\u2019s worth a few million. If you don\u2019t want it, why not just save it for me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze looked at her speechlessly, \u201cCan\u2019t you just listen to me? When I say that I don\u2019t want it, it means that I don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s only a few million. I\u2019ll get a new one for you.\u201dLin Che stuck her tongue out. She felt that it was a waste. Looking at Gu Jingze, she said, \u201cI just feel that just because of some scum, we\u2019re wasting a good car. The poor car is innocent after all, right? Heh heh.\u201dGu Jingze looked into her eyes silently. She was finding excuses when she really just could not bear to let it go.Gu Jingze said, \u201cFine, we won\u2019t scrap the car. You can have it. Sell it or use it. It\u2019s yours.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face was gleeful, \u201cWow, for real? Gu Jingze, you are too kind.\u201d Lin Che tugged at Gu Jingze and shook his arm. She was so happy that if she had a tail, it would have been wagging left and right.Gu Jingze looked at her smile and patted her head. He felt his anger slowly dissipate just by seeing her happy.\u201cSadly, the good atmosphere got disrupted,\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze said, \u201cLet\u2019s take the car back first.\u201dThe car was beautiful. Lin Che caressed it and said, \u201cThis car is the same as the one just now?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s the same.\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s no point in having two cars. I might as well sell one. Where can I sell it? If I put it online, people might think that it\u2019s a stolen car.\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cI\u2019ll ask someone to help you sell it.\u201d\u201cReally, Gu Jingze? You are really the best!\u201d Lin Che smiled until her eyes formed two lines like crescent moons. She looked pretty.Gu Jingze shook his head. He must have been the only man to ever give a gift and tear it apart for someone.if he was a sucker, he was a really big one. He knew that she only thought about money but he could not wait to put gifts into her hands.Gu Jingze asked, \u201cIs that all you can say?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWhat did you expect? You have so much money that even if I gave you money, you wouldn\u2019t care.\u201dGu Jingze brought his face close to hers, \u201cHow about a kiss to show your sincerity?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che blushed and pushed his face away, \u201cGo away; don\u2019t joke around.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing, then I\u2019ll kiss you as my payment.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dGu Jingze looked at her and laughed. He said playfully, \u201cThen you have to thank me.\u201d\u201cBut you have everything you need,\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze suggested, \u201cWhy not you cook a meal for me?\u201dLin Che thought about it and then looked at him reluctantly, \u201cYou dare to eat my cooking?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll warn you first that it\u2019s going to be terrible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I will accept it,\u201d Gu Jingze never really saw how she was like when she did something so he was anticipating it.Lin Che pursed her lips and coughed dryly, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll cook for you.\u201dGu Jingze nodded his head in satisfaction.Lin Che was still trying to dissuade him, \u201cI\u2019m telling you; you\u2019re going to regret it.\u201dGu Jingze did not believe that she could cook up poison by following a cookbook.But to be safe, he decided that it was better to select a simple recipe for her.Otherwise, with Lin Che\u2019s stupidity, he might end up with boiled water. That would not be fun.At night, they drove the car home. Lin Che immediately started taking pictures of the car with all sorts of props and angles.Gu Jingze frowned as she pranced around. He said from the side, \u201cWhat are you taking pictures for?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cThis is my very first luxury car in all my life and it\u2019s worth a few million. Of course, I\u2019m taking pictures to show off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze said, \u201cIf you want to show off, just take a picture of the invoice.\u201d\u201cThat is obnoxious.\u201d\u201cThen take a picture of the model number.\u201d\u201cLooks like you don\u2019t know how to humble-brag. That\u2019s so boring. To humble-brag you need to show that it\u2019s expensive but make people feel like you\u2019re not doing it on purpose. Taking a picture of the model number is not very subtle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe really knew how to show off.Gu Jingze watched as she finally found a good angle. She looked like she was taking the flower pot in front but she had the entire car in the frame.Did she suddenly get more intelligent?Lin Che looked at her photo in a satisfied way before sending it to her WeChat and typing, \u201cJust bought new flowers. I better take delicate care to let them grow!\u201dGu Jingze went over to take a look, \u201cThese flowers have already bloomed and they\u2019re all grown up. Do they really need your care?\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you lying?\u201d\u201cThis is a white lie. You wouldn\u2019t understand!\u201dLin Che soon saw people already starting to comment below her post, \u201cWow a luxury car. Must be a few grand.\u201dLin Che muttered, \u201cBull crap. A few grand? How does this person even see?\u201dAnother person commented, \u201cThat\u2019s a nice car indeed, but you took this picture in a yard. Which district did you get a house in?\u201dAnother person also observed, \u201cThis yard is obviously huge. You caught a fortune. Which old man is it? His house is so posh.\u201dLin Che did not expect these people to look at the photo so meticulously.She stood there and happily said, \u201cSee, all these people are experienced. They are so good that they can certainly see what\u2019s in the background. A subtle photo like this and they could tell that the yard is big. Tsk tsk.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Jingze observed her happy face. Standing there, his own lips instinctively curled up.This Lin Che got happy over a simple thing like that. Just by giving her a little bit of satisfaction, she was so elated that she blossomed like a flower.It was as if happiness was so simple.Gu Jingze wanted to give her more and more. He wanted to make her happy forever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In her home, she saw Lin Che\u2019s post of her own car and was unhappy. As they were in the same circle, they had many mutual friends. She saw them commenting below on how big her yard was. Lin Li deduced that it might be Gu Jingze\u2019s house.Gu Jingze\u2019s house must be enormous.What a pity that the little slut was living there. It was too good for her.Lin Che touched her own car and wanted to drive it so badly. Unfortunately, she never had the chance to learn how to drive.Lin Che turned to Gu Jingze and asked, \u201cOn average, how long does it take to learn to drive?\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cIf you want to learn, I can teach you right now. It should be easy to pick up.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cDriving is actually not that hard. Come. We\u2019ll go on an empty road. I\u2019ll teach you there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Lin Che jumped up and down as she tugged on Gu Jingze\u2019s hand.Soon, they were outside with Gu Jingze behind the wheel. The sports car was small, so Gu Jingze felt slightly uncomfortable sitting inside. Lin Che was embarrassed as she looked at the 1.9 meters tall Gu Jingze all crammed up. No wonder he usually drove a sedan and not a small car like this.Gu Jingze stopped the car and was patiently explaining all the functions of the car.Lin Che frowned as she listened and asked Gu Jingze, \u201cIs driving really simple to learn?\u201d\u201cOf course. After my instructor explained everything to me once, I was already driving us all around. With how intelligent you are, I think you will learn in half a day.\u201dLin Che nodded, feeling confident about herself.However\u2026Only a few minutes into it\u2026\u201cLin Che, that\u2019s for the gas lid, not the accelerator.\u201d\u201cLin Che, let go of the steering wheel first!\u201d\u201cLin Che, where are you turning to? Do you want to die?\u201dGu Jingze was getting stricter each time he scolded her. However, the more she got scolded, the more she panicked. In the end, she looked at him speechlessly, \u201cGu Jingze, can you not raise your voice? You\u2019re making me nervous!\u201dGu Jingze frowned deeply and looked at the woman in front of him. He must have overestimated her intelligence.\u201cI\u2019ve never come across a woman so stupid like you!\u201d\u201cSo what if I\u2019m stupid?\u201d Lin Che challenged.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze had really never seen such a stupid woman. He had also never seen a woman as noisy and shameless as her. In any case\u2026He simply thought that she was a truly unique specimen. She was so infuriating that it might have been better to just strangle her right there and then.\u201cCan you please coordinate your hands and legs?!\u201d Gu Jingze could no longer hold his patience.Lin Che looked at him blankly, \u201cI just can\u2019t coordinate them; what can I do? I told you not to yell. You may be a genius but not everyone is like you!\u201d\u201cYou seriously\u2026\u201d Gu Jingze muttered, \u201cI was wrong just now. You need a month at least.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che glared at him helplessly and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy to teach me, fine. You don\u2019t have to yell at me. I don\u2019t care about your lessons!\u201dGu Jingze took a deep breath and turned around to hear Lin Che continue, \u201cYour Mo Huiling must be clever. She probably can learn it in one go. Why don\u2019t you go teach her?!\u201dGu Jingze halted and looked at Lin Che\u2019s brooding face. His teeth made loud grinding sounds in his mouth.He stared intensely at her, then opened the car door, and got out.Without so much as looking back, he took big strides forward and even slammed the door shut as he walked away.It was over. He was really angry.Lin Che was also annoyed at herself. Why did she have to provoke him and mention Mo Huiling? He was not teaching Mo Huiling; he was teaching her. If he could, he would obviously choose to kill two birds with one stone and be with Mo Huiling. Why would he be here wasting time with her?She acknowledged that she was bad in this aspect. She was stupid, uncoordinated and had a bad memory. Especially when she looked at all the controls in the car, she felt like fainting.She wanted to learn quickly too but she just couldn\u2019t help it.After a while.Gu Jingze felt Lin Che catch up from behind and grab onto his waist. She said to him, \u201cGu Jingze, don\u2019t be angry. I was just trying to have fun. You can\u2019t be really mad over something like this.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s expression hardened and was stiff like a jade stone.Although finely architectured and flawless, it was icy with no warmth.Lin Che held his hand as she ran to face him, \u201cDon\u2019t leave, Gu Jingze. I\u2019m talking to you.\u201dGu Jingze shook her hand away, \u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cGu Jingze!\u201d\u201cLet me go!\u201d he ordered monotonously.Lin Che gritted her teeth and tugged at Gu Jingze, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d She stretched out her arms and blocked his path. She said, \u201cHubby, I was in the wrong. Don\u2019t be angry, okay?\u201dLin Che changed her strategy. She was acting coquettishly as she grabbed his hand and swayed it, pouting and looking at him with big, sparkly eyes. Her moist lips curled up like juicy, tantalizing fruits.Gu Jingze frowned and turned his head, \u201cLet go of me.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I won\u2019t let go unless Hubby says he\u2019s not angry anymore.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d\u201cSay it, please, Hubby. Look at me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingze had no other choice. He turned his head back to look at Lin Che\u2019s appeasing look like a small dog wagging its tail and refusing to leave.Especially when she called him Hubby, it was soft and pillowy like cotton candy. How could anyone not relent?Taking a deep breath, Gu Jingze thought,She was indeed a breed of her own.How was he so unlucky that he married a wife like that?\u201cForget it. I shall be magnanimous. I\u2019m just doing a good deed. Since your intelligence is only that low, I shall be compassionate,\u201d Gu Jingze finally relaxed.Lin Che\u2019s smile stiffened. She looked at Gu Jingze sullenly, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to talk nicely?!\u201dGu Jingze returned to the car. He watched Lin Che hold the steering wheel. She looked up at him and waited for his instructions. He smiled and looked into her eyes, \u201cI have an idea that will make you learn faster.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll use rewards and punishments.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you do something correctly, I\u2019ll reward you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cReward me with what?\u201d Lin Che\u2019s eyes lit up the moment she heard \u2018reward\u2019. She looked in anticipation at Gu Jingze.Gu Jingze gazed at her full lips and gently pecked them.Lin Che was startled while Gu Jingze smiled as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll reward you with a kiss.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che immediately blushed, \u201cGu.

She looked sullenly at Gu Jingze, \u201cNobody does that, Gu Jingze!\u201dHer contempt brought out Gu Jingze\u2019s smile.Smirking at her, his cheeks began to soften.Lin Che was stunned. He looked beautiful smiling like that.A man who usually never revealed his expression was now suddenly smiling. It was extraordinarily beautiful.Lin Che was dazed. Gu Jingze inched closer to her, \u201cLin Che, why are you staring at me?\u201dLin Che jolted, \u201cNobody is staring at you!\u201d\u201cHow can that be? I can see it crystal clear. Why? Am I that good looking?\u201d Gu Jingze moved closer as Lin Che tried to hide her expression. Before she realized it, his body was already at her side.The space in the car was tight. Gu Jingze had one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the back of her car seat. His chest was awkwardly positioned such that Lin Che was right in the center.Gu Jingze drew closer to look at Lin Che\u2019s face and thought that her cheeks were very delicate. Up close, he could not see a single flaw on her face. In fact, she looked better and better.At home, she usually did not wear makeup or apply anything. The flawless skin on her face was so clean that it was irresistible to kiss.He looked at her with amusement, \u201cTell me, am I good looking?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Gu Jingze, you\u2019re shameless!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hide anything between a husband and wife, right?\u201d Gu Jingze lowered his head and observed her expression.Lin Che then realized that he had moved so close to her that he was already right in front of her.Her chest was almost touching his. She constricted her breathing.Gu Jingze persisted, \u201cAre you going to admit that you were staring at me because I\u2019m good looking or not?\u201dLin Che felt that she was being pressured until she almost could not breathe.She said in a flurry, \u201cYes, you\u2019re good looking. You\u2019re the most good looking person.\u201dGu Jingze was not satisfied as he looked at her perfunctory appearance, \u201cYou\u2019re not even sincere about it.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Fine. You\u2019re the best looking man, Gu Jingze. You\u2019re the most handsome man I\u2019ve ever seen. You\u2019re more handsome than any other man!\u201d Lin Che quickly said with a hand on her chest.Gu Jingze pressed on, \u201cReally? Then tell me who is more good looking, me or Jingyu?\u201dLin Che had never come across such a narcissistic man like him who compared himself to his own brother.\u201cYou\u2019re more good looking. Are you satisfied now?\u201dShe said this even though Lin Che found Gu Jingze slightly better looking.Perhaps it was because Gu Jingyu did not have the type of charisma that Gu Jingze had, even though Gu Jingyu looked pristine.That deep, intense way he looked at people as if he was going to suck their souls in\u2026Gu Jingze nodded in satisfaction; at least she had good taste, \u201cThen what about\u2026\u201dHe lowered his head and looked at her deeply. He asked hesitantly, \u201cThen tell me who is better looking, me or Qin Qing?\u201dLin Che\u2019s face immediately stiffened.The intelligent Gu Jingze naturally knew that the answer this time would be different. His eyes darkened and bored right through Lin Che, \u201cTell me.\u201dLin Che understood that Qin Qing was not as handsome as Gu Jingze. Qin Qing was the boy next door. When people saw him, they thought of Prince Charming. On the other hand, Gu Jingze was like a knight. At night, when you needed him the most, he would appear silently. He was like a hero in anyone\u2019s eyes.However, there was something about him that could never be revealed in the light. It made people feel gloomy, melancholic, and unable to penetrate through the night.Handsome, sexy, but different.\u201cI\u2026\u201dGu Jingze already knew\u2026He grabbed her wrist and with one swoop, pulled her over onto himself.Lin Che uncontrollably let out a sound, feeling his dark eyes on her like the endless night sky that slowly engulfed her.Gu Jingze stared at her face, hugging her. As she sat on top of him, she looked so shy. Her slight resistance seemed to ignite a passionate fire in him, a burning desire. He lowered his head, hugged her, and then forcefully pressed his lips against hers.\u201cMm\u2026 Mm\u2026\u201d Lin Che exclaimed and pushed his shoulder away.Gu Jingze wrapped his arms tightly around her.\u201cYou\u2026 Mm\u2026\u201dWhen he let go of her, he muttered, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s exciting in the car?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che said in a fluster, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this, Gu Jingze. Let go of me!\u201dHer clothes became undone in the chaos and she revealed herself in front of him.Amidst the chaos, Lin Che looked all around. She pressed the car horn and made a loud, piercing sound.Gu Jingze immediately loosened his grip around her waist.Lin Che broke into tears.Seeing her red eyes, Gu Jingze\u2019s heart sank.He frowned and let her down gently. Looking at her messy clothes, he pulled them together.Lin Che felt he was like a monster at that moment. It was frightening.She turned her head and angrily ignored him. She looked down to tidy her clothes, catching her breath and not saying a word.Gu Jingze took a deep breath and looked at her. His eyes shifted down to his aroused area and he smiled bitterly.Helplessly scowling as he looked at her. He said, \u201cIf you still like Qin Qing, you can actually tell him. It\u2019s a waste if you can\u2019t tell someone that you like them.\u201dLin Che was speechless as she looked at Gu Jingze.Her eyes moved as she said, \u201cI won\u2019t tell him\u2026 In fact, come to think about it, that was all in the past. I don\u2019t really like him now; it\u2019s just that when you liked someone before, you\u2019ll still care about them somewhat.\u201dGu Jingze raised an eyebrow and turned to Lin Che.Lin Che looked up, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the human heart is made of flesh? Just because a person can\u2019t get the one they like and decided not to like them anymore, doesn\u2019t mean that the person can just completely forget about him and treat him like a stranger.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her and shook his head.The mood became a lot better.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe lesson did not progress much more. Gu Jingze promised to teach her slowly, but she did not want him to teach her anymore. He was a scary instructor.When they got home, Lin Che received a call from the company.Yu Minmin spoke to her excitedly over the phone, \u201cYou\u2019ve been nominated for Panda TV Festival\u2019s best newcomer award.

It was difficult to get nominated for an award.A few hundred million people watched it every year. It was naturally different.Yu Minmin was also very happy. She quickly brought Lin Che to the company and started selecting her formal attire.Yu Minmin especially went to search for some reliable sponsors. The products were all of good quality.Out of all the actresses who Yu Minmin managed, Lin Che was now her most capable actress, so she was pouring all her energy into making Lin Che shine.In the company, Yu Minmin had fought for a private room for Lin Che. In the private room, Yu Minmin handed the Festival\u2019s invitation to Lin Che.\u201cThis was just sent over today. Those in the upper levels are also very happy for you. However, some of the other nominees this year also have potential. There\u2019s one that obviously slept their way up, so don\u2019t mind that person.\u201dThe list included all the nominees. Lin Che saw Lin Li\u2019s name up for the fashionista award. It looked like she would have to see her there.Lin Che spoke excitedly, \u201cI honestly never thought that I would get in. I only acted one role and it was a supporting role.\u201d\u201cGu Jingyu\u2019s television series is popular every year, so you were part of a popular show. That\u2019s one reason to be nominated. Secondly, your role was very likeable. Third, your acting was very good.\u201dLin Che looked at Yu Minmin speechlessly, \u201cSister Yu, can\u2019t you praise me in a better way? You just had to put that right at the end.\u201dAs they met everyday, Lin Che\u2019s relationship with Yu Minmin improved a lot and their conversations were not so restrained anymore.Yu Minmin said, \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. What you have today is also partly contributed by luck, so you better not get too arrogant, you hear me?\u201d\u201cGot it\u2026\u201d\u201cBut your efforts did accumulate and pay off. You deserve to be nominated. I believe the other worthy nominees didn\u2019t act as well as you. I think you might have a good chance at winning.\u201dLin Che smiled shyly and covered her cheeks as she said embarrassingly, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dYu Minmin replied, \u201cI mean it. Do you think you\u2019re still a small actress? You are now a new star. The company is preparing to focus on grooming you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I still can\u2019t get used to it. This is the first time I got so successful.\u201d\u201cMe too, actually. You\u2019re the first actress under me to be this successful,\u201d Yu Minmin said.Lin Che looked at Yu Minmin in disbelief, \u201cSister Yu had so many famous artists last time.\u201dYu Minmin said, \u201cThat is because I worked here for a long time. I started working here as an assistant at the moment I graduated. From an assistant, I moved to be a personal assistant, then to a public manager, and then to a personal manager. I\u2019ve been here for eight years. It\u2019s a pity that it takes luck to meet an artist with great potential. I played a safe game and never thought of poaching artists from other managers. As a result, all my artists were either pure newcomers or angry old artists.\u201d She patted Lin Che on the shoulder, \u201cSo, it\u2019s a first for both of us. Let\u2019s work hard together.\u201d\u201cYes! Let\u2019s work hard together!\u201d Lin Che suddenly realized that she previously thought that managers were all high and mighty as they always called the shots and decided the fates of small artists. However, now she realized that these managers actually did not have such an easy job.When the two of them stepped out, the small artists outside saw Lin Che and bowed their heads and greeted her, \u201cHello, Sister Lin Che.\u201d They waited for Lin Che to walk past before lifting their heads back up.Lin Che knew that in the circle, hierarchy and results were most important. In the past, she would also hide at the side whenever a popular star walked past before continuing her way.Now, she was the one getting this special treatment. It honestly felt a little strange.Lin Che remarked, \u201cHonestly, I only acted in one role. They don\u2019t have to treat me like this.\u201dYu Minmin smiled and replied, \u201cBut you\u2019ve already gone up the ranks. Also, you\u2019ve been on a few headlines and you\u2019re a highly raved actress this year. Everybody in the company knows you.\u201dLin Che never thought that she would become so well-known so quickly.Just then, as they got to the door\u2026An old man suddenly rushed over in front of them. Lin Che almost jumped in fear.However, the old man did not really bother Lin Che. Rather, he faced Yu Minmin and kneeled down.Lin Che covered her mouth in shock. She looked at Yu Minmin who was calm, but also suddenly a little dazed. The old man hugged Yu Minmin\u2019s legs and exclaimed, \u201cMinmin, you have to help me. I\u2019m really going to die this time. If you don\u2019t help me, I\u2019m really going to leave our house and become homeless.\u201dThis ragged, dirty-looking old man turned out to be Yu Minmin\u2019s father?Lin Che was also stunned.Yu Minmin bit her lips as she looked at her father. She pushed him away and said curtly, \u201cI told you that this was the last time I was going to help you. What did you do now? Did you lose money again? Dad, I have no money anymore. Not a single cent. This is my workplace; please stay away or I might lose my job. Who will you go to for money then?\u201dWhile he was still on the ground, the old man looked up, \u201cMinmin, I didn\u2019t lose money this time. It was because of those bastards; they said that I didn\u2019t give them enough money. They said that I was 30,000 yuan short and that if I don\u2019t give it to them, they were going to take your mother away to be a cook. I got scared, so\u2026 so\u2026\u201dYu Minmin frowned, \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cSo I kidnapped the young master\u2019s woman from the Lu family and threatened them. Who knew that I would accidentally hit her head and she would have to go to the hospital? Now, they want to sue me. I\u2019m really done for this time\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Yu Minmin changed her frown to a smile. She looked at her own father in amusement, \u201cYou\u2019re really something. Now, besides gambling, you also beat other people up?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cLet go of me. I don\u2019t care about this. You might as well go to prison or you\u2019ll continue dragging my mother and us down,\u201d Yu Minmin pushed her father away from her legs.The old man fell on the ground. People were looking at them with curiosity. The old man saw and suddenly flailed angrily on the ground. He pointed his finger at Yu Minmin and scolded her, \u201cWhat kind of person are you? I\u2019m your father; how can you treat me like this? I raised you and fed you. Now that you\u2019re so capable, you don\u2019t want us anymore, is that it? I\u2019m a burden to you? Fine, don\u2019t care about me. Since you don\u2019t care about me, I\u2019m staying put right at your company\u2019s entrance!\u201dYu Minmin was speechless. Staring at him coldly, she waved to the security guards, \u201cThere\u2019s a man loitering here and hindering our work. Please take him out!\u201dThe security guards quickly went over to take him out. The old man shouted tragically. Each time, his voice went higher and higher.Lin Che could not look on and hurriedly took Yu Minmin away from there.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe onlookers talked amongst themselves, their eyes seemed to be judging Yu Minmin.Father Yu was chased out but he was still wandering outside. Lin Che watched him and said to Yu Minmin, \u201cGo back with me first. If you go back to your home now, your dad will definitely find you.\u201dYu Minmin looked at Lin Che gratefully, \u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201dLin Che gestured for the chauffeur to drive back to the Gu residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She pondered a while before saying, \u201cYour father can\u2019t go on like this.\u201dYu Minmin laughed bitterly, \u201cNothing can be done about it. Gambling has already become his life. I\u2019ve heard him say that he would quit for almost my entire life, yet he\u2019s still causing trouble every day. It\u2019s okay; I\u2019m already used to it.\u201dLin Che had always been Yu Minmin\u2019s artist, but she was only a small one back then. It was different now. It was as if Yu Minmin was now her personal manager, so they were together every day. As a result, she came to know of Yu Minmin\u2019s family background.Lin Che patted Yu Minmin\u2019s shoulder, \u201cThere must be a way.\u201dYu Minmin looked at Lin Che and shook her head, \u201cUnless I take my mother and brother away from here, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way to shake off this parasite.\u201dLin Che comforted her, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll think of something when we get home. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll find a way.\u201dSoon, they arrived at the Gu residence.Yu Minmin had never seen the Gu residence. From the outside, she saw some strict-looking guards and thought that it was a bad idea. She turned to Lin Che and asked, \u201cCan I go in? The Gu family probably doesn\u2019t let outsiders in, right?\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026 It should be fine, but I never brought in anyone before.\u201dAt the entrance, the security guard looked at Yu Minmin and then politely greeted Lin Che, \u201cMadam.\u201d After that, he let them in.Yu Minmin sat still. She noticed their respectful greeting.However, she turned to Lin Che but did not ask anything.She was the manager but she usually didn\u2019t probe where there was no need to probe about personal matters of the artist. She only did that when it affected their job. That was a manager\u2019s work ethic.When they entered, Yu Minmin then saw the enormous house and the subtly elegant decor.Standing in the living room, she could not help but say to Lin Che, \u201cYour house is like a palace.\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cYes. When I first got here, I always got lost because there were too many turns. It looks complicated but after walking a bit, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201dYu Minmin remarked, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is Gu Jingze\u2019s place.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Lin Che looked at her.Yu Minmin smiled and said, \u201cA commoner wouldn\u2019t be able to come in but I get to bask in your light.\u201dLin Che smiled, \u201cIs that so? To think there\u2019d be a day when someone gets to bask in my light.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dJust then, Yu Minmin\u2019s phone rang. She bent her head to answer the call. It was from her mother.Her mother was crying on the other end, \u201cPlease just help your father, Minmin. Only you can help in this family, nobody else is capable enough. See if you know anybody who can talk to them. You only have one father. If anything happens to him, won\u2019t you regret it?\u201dYu Minmin\u2019s fingernails dug into her palm as if the pain would make her feel better.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll think of something\u2026\u201d Yu Minmin could only plainly say to her sobbing mother.When she hung up, she closed her eyes and tilted her head up. She looked at the Gu residence\u2019s sprawling ceiling and sighed.Lin Che said, \u201cSister Yu, who are they? Let\u2019s think of something. There must be a way.\u201dYu Minmin replied, \u201cIt\u2019s the Lu family who runs a moneylending business and underground gambling dens in the B market. My father has been dealing with them for many years. To put it bluntly, they are not good people. I\u2019ll go talk to them and then we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do tonight?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get a hotel room so my father can\u2019t find me for the time being. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve lived like this for many years, so I know what to do. Protecting myself is my strong suit.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dYu Minmin booked a hotel room through her phone. Lin Che arranged for a car to send her there.Later, her phone rang. She saw Gu Jingze\u2019s name appear. She smiled and picked it up.\u201cWhen are you going to fulfill your promise and cook me a meal?\u201dLin Che thought he was joking when he said that but now that he brought it up, she reluctantly answered, \u201cFine\u2026 I\u2019m waiting for you to come back so we can go buy ingredients.\u201d\u201cOkay, wait for me then. I\u2019m reaching soon.\u201dWhen Gu Jingze heard that she was going to buy ingredients to cook for him, he could not wait and hurried home.He arrived quickly and pulled Lin Che out, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the market.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re coming along?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Lin Che remembered Mo Huiling\u2019s warning the other day, \u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous for you to go out?\u201dGu Jingze looked at Lin Che strangely, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that the other day, Mo Huiling told me that it\u2019s dangerous for you to go out on your own.\u201dMo Huiling?A look of unhappiness flashed across his face. He said to Lin Che, \u201cThere\u2019s danger wherever I go. Does that mean I have to be locked up in a cage, just to avoid the danger? Let\u2019s go.\u201dAs he said, his hand held onto Lin Che\u2019s and he took her out.Lin Che wanted to say something else but looking at him, she decided it was best not to. She looked down at his hand on hers and wanted to pull away, but she did not. His grip seemed to tighten. She saw that the maids were still looking, so she did not want to struggle too much.There were not many people at the market. Lin Che thought,It was strange as it was usually crowded. It was like a street with limits as the crowd was small and orderly.Lin Che pushed the shopping cart and looked at Gu Jingze write down a recipe. She remarked depressingly, \u201cSo demanding. That recipe looks complicated.\u201dGu Jingze asked, \u201cThis is complicated? It\u2019s just chopping up and stir-frying a few ingredients.\u201dHe specially chose a less costly recipe.Lin Che pushed the cart and walked around to look at the vegetables. A huge supermarket really made one feel blissful. Lin Che was full of smiles and seemed very relaxed.\u201cI want one of this.\u201d\u201cAnd one of this.\u201d\u201cAh, the radish looks fresh.\u201dThe more she added things into the cart, the messier it got.She had completely ignored the recipe\u2019s ingredients list.Gu Jingze only shook his head helplessly.Just then, a passerby knocked the back of her heel with the shopping cart\u2019s wheel.Lin Che yelped.She looked up to see a man look at her before turning away silently.Lin Che thought unhappily,What an immoral guy.However, Gu Jingze grabbed hold the arm of the man who just turned away.Holding the man\u2019s arm, Gu Jingze pressed him against a shelf. The man was shocked and wanted to swear at him, but looking at Gu Jingze\u2019s deep eyes, he felt guilty and shut his mouth.\u201cApologize to my wife,\u201d he said.The man looked at Lin Che. Although he was unwilling, he feared Gu Jingze and said humbly, \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t notice.\u201dLin Che rubbed her heel, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just be careful next time.\u201dGu Jingze grunted and then let the man go.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe man slipped away quickly. Lin Che was about to get up from the ground but Gu Jingze squatted down beside her and scooped her up in his arms.The passersby looked at them in envy. This strong and tall man would make anyone become infatuated with him.Gu Jingze carried her and put her in the shopping cart, \u201cLet me see if your leg is okay.\u201dLin Che shook her head. She smiled as she looked at Gu Jingze, \u201cI\u2019m okay. The impact from a cart is not that great.

I\u2019m not getting down.\u201dGu Jingze remarked, \u201cLazy egg.\u201dAlthough he sounded unwilling, he had already begun pushing her.She sat in the cart and directed Gu Jingze to buy things.\u201cI want the eggplants over there.\u201d\u201cAh, I want some chips.\u201d\u201cGu Jingze, push faster. There\u2019s some discount over there.\u201dLin Che was chirping away while Gu Jingze pushed her with resentment. The two of them went around the supermarket aisles happily. It was a sight that made people sigh with envy.Some people commented, \u201cSee how someone else\u2019s boyfriend dotes on his girlfriend?\u201d\u201cYou envy them, but you need to consider how they look first. See, the girl is so pretty. If that was my girlfriend, I\u2019d also dote on her like that.\u201d\u201cGet lost. You didn\u2019t see how the boyfriend looked like. He\u2019s so handsome.\u201d\u201cEh, talking about him, he does look a bit familiar.\u201d\u201cI thought the girl looked familiar.\u201d\u201cAnyway, both of them are so good looking. They match so perfectly.\u201dLin Che held no bars as she shopped. Very quickly, they left with three full big bags.Gu Jingze had difficulty going out. He discreetly stopped the ushers outside, took his three bags, and walked towards his car.Lin Che offered, \u201cLet me take one.\u201dGu Jingze refused, \u201cWith your little arms and legs, forget it.\u201dLin Che pouted but watching him, a big and strong man, carry the three bags swiftly to the car and throwing them all in the trunk, she thought that he looked charismatic and manly.Lin Che smiled warmly and sat in the car.Back home, as she was about to begin cooking, she became depressed again.She put on an apron with professionalism but when it came to cutting the vegetables, she had butter fingers.Gu Jingze looked from the side and silently wanted to help her.Especially whenever the knife came down towards her hand, he felt his temples suddenly jump along.\u201cOkay, okay. Let me help you cut the vegetables,\u201d he quickly walked over and said.\u201cNo need. I\u2019m doing it just fine. See, I think my knife skills are getting better.

Blood was flowing out from the opening.Gu Jingze tugged her finger, \u201cYou are really\u2026 I told you not to cut anymore.\u201dAs he spoke, he directly put her finger into his mouth.Lin Che\u2019s finger hurt.She looked at his brows as he sucked on her finger.

Looking into his black eyes, her face became hot.\u201cDirty\u2026\u201d Lin Che thought. It must be dirty from handling all the vegetables.Gu Jingze sucked once and let go of her hand. He bent his head to look closely.He turned around to fetch the first aid kit. Then, he applied a band-aid on her finger.Lin Che looked at the perfectly taped band-aid and then looked at the obsessive-compulsive disorder patient.Gu Jingze frowned and push her aside, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.

Whatever he did was exemplary. Whatever he learned, he learned it fast.In comparison, she was a lot dumber.Lin Che thought,No wonder he always called her dumb.He stood there holding a spatula and wearing an apron; it made him look like a house-husband. A handsome man cooking in an apron was extremely charming and irresistible.Lin Che leaned her head and looked admiringly at this beautiful, appetizing scene. She rested her chin on her hand and stared in obsession.Gu Jingze said as he cooked, \u201cActually, your manager\u2019s problem is really easy to solve.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI can help.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so?\u201dLin Che quickly said, \u201cReally? That would be great\u2026 Gu Jingze, thanks for offering to help.\u201dGu Jingze turned to her and smiled plainly, \u201cYou know the gratitude I want is never just words.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dGu Jingze dished up another plate with speed and walked over. He looked at Lin Che and then hugged her from behind.Lin Che was shocked as she heard Gu Jingze speak next to her ear, \u201cActually, you look really good in the apron. Since you didn\u2019t finish cooking, you should at least reward me for my hard work.\u201dHe blew at her ear and made Lin Che\u2019s ear itch uncomfortably.Lin Che replied, \u201cYou\u2026 What reward do you want?\u201dGu Jingze said in a low voice, \u201cI want to see you wearing just this apron\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che pictured it in her head; it would be like a dirty magazine. So revealing\u2026Lin Che immediately resisted, \u201cGet lost, Gu Jingze. You stinky gangster!\u201dGu Jingze laughed as she pushed him away. He quickly shunned from her.However, from the start just now, he had already observed her wearing the apron. He thought that if she walked around the house in just that, she would look great.Although the image was too embarrassing, he really anticipated it deep down.Lin Che imagined herself in such a scenario and thought that this man was just too evil!\u201cGet lost! No way I would do that!\u201d\u201cEh, what are you running away for? Come back here,\u201d Gu Jingze pulled Lin Che back. Grabbing her waist, he hoisted her onto the table.Lin Che shouted. Even as she sat high on the table, her face was still right in front of his chest. Looking up, she could only see his lower jaw.He lowered his head slightly and looked at her face. He took off his apron and put it on her.\u201cOkay,\u201d he smiled and looked at her.That was it?Lin Che looked down speechlessly at herself and the apron. There was no difference.She looked weirdly at herself. The man standing in front of her had his hands placed loosely on her waist. His head was lowered as he watched her.\u201cAh, you wanted me to wear an apron. I thought you meant just the apron by itself\u2026\u201d Lin Che said.Gu Jingze answered, \u201cJust wearing an apron meant just letting you wear an apron. That\u2019s it.\u201d He raised his brow suggestively as he looked down at her face, \u201cWhy? You look very disappointed. Was this not what you thought?\u201dAs he stared her down like that, Lin Che started to feel embarrassed.Looking angrily at his mischievous smile, she thought resentfully,She had been tricked by him.Fine. This man was getting worse. Now, he was starting to play tricks with her!Lin Che\u2019s face was bright red as she looked at him. Gu Jingze pretended to act innocent, purposely raising his brow and asking, \u201cWhat were you thinking? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 You were thinking\u2026\u201dHe intentionally looked her up and down and said, \u201cIf you must do that, I can accept it too.\u201d\u201cGo away, I didn\u2019t say I wanted to do that\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on. I won\u2019t be scared of you wearing that. Try it.\u201d\u201cGo away. Do you still want to eat? The food is turning cold!\u201dLin Che quickly jumped off the table, not letting him provoke her any further.Gu Jingze smiled as he watched her skip away.He shook his head and thought,This Lin Che may not know anything, but she\u2019s getting good at running away.However, after Gu Jingze told her he would help, he really went to search.The next day, Gu Jingze said to Lin Che, \u201cI found the person you mentioned. She\u2019s in the hospital. We can go over to take a look.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great. You\u2019re too good, Gu Jingze.\u201dLin Che smiled and hugged his arm as she exclaimed.At the hospital.Yu Minmin\u2019s father, Yu Qinglong, was loitering outside.In the ward, the young master of the Lu family was gazing at his lover and carefully blowing at the porridge to cool it down as he fed her, \u201cNana, drink this. Be careful as it\u2019s hot.\u201d\u201cDear, why is that man still outside? Can\u2019t we chase him away? Who wants to see him? He should just compensate us. What a disgusting man.\u201dLu Qinghong gritted his teeth and went out. He kicked Yu Qinglong in the chest, \u201cGet lost. Looking at you disgusts me. Either get your daughter to sell herself or have your wife be a cook for the rest of her life; it\u2019s up to you. Why are you still here?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026 My daughter is not coming,\u201d Yu Qinglong\u2019s face was full of suffering.Ever since that day he looked her up at the office, she disappeared without a trace. He could not find her at all and was completely helpless.\u201cThen get lost. Nobody wants to see your ugly face. Wait to spend the rest of your life in prison!\u201d Lu Qinghong closed the door. Yu Qinglong stared at the door with melancholy.The door opened again.Lu Qinghong turned around and yelled, \u201cWho\u2019s here? Is this a place that you can just enter like this?\u201dHe looked up to see Lin Che in a black jumper and a pair of ripped skinny jeans. She looked dazzling.Looking at Lin Che\u2019s pretty face, his tone immediately softened, \u201cEh, what are you doing here?\u201dLin Che entered the room and saw a woman lying in bed. Beside her stood a tall and huge man.Nana saw Lin Che and her eyes suddenly became alert. As if feeling threatened, she quickly sat up.Gu Jingze followed quietly behind Lin Che as they entered the room, surprising everyone.Lin Che looked at the woman who did not forget to put makeup even on a hospital bed. She took a few steps forward and asked, \u201cWas it you who caused the Yu family problems?\u201dLu Qinghong smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Why? Are you here because of that? He hit my horse, so now I want him to pay. That goes without saying, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che could not see a single injury on the woman.She glanced at the woman and asked, \u201cHow much do you want?\u201dThe man said without hesitation, \u201cI want five million.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Lin Che really had to hand it to them. How brazen. \u201cSince you\u2019re asking for five million, then her injury must be really serious!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I have money here. I\u2019m giving you what Yu Minmin\u2019s father owes you but for others, especially if it doesn\u2019t belong to the Yu family, you can forget about getting a single cent.\u201dNana, who was lying on the bed, was naturally unwilling. The difference between five million and two hundred thousand was not small.She immediately sat up and said, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. Five million and not a single cent less. Otherwise, I will put him in jail!\u201dLin Che smiled, \u201cYou must have gone crazy thinking about money.\u201dAt that moment, Gu Jingze looked at them from behind, \u201cWe are giving you this money so that you guys can shut up. If a simple method like this can\u2019t make you shut up, I have other ways to make you never speak again. Thus, you can either take the easy way or make the situation more complicated than this.\u201dThe pair looked at each other and then looked at Gu Jingze. Their expressions changed.Nana wanted to get up and say something, but Lu Qinghong stopped her.With one look, he was able to tell that Gu Jingze was no ordinary person.From his custom-made clothes to his naturally flawless face, his aura seemed to suppress everyone in the room.His eyes turned and he realized that this man was definitely not a normal person. He probably would not be able to win against this man. Otherwise, he would not have come in alone in such a calm manner.The rest of the Lu family were on their way. They were aggressive too, but he probably would not be fazed by them either.Lu Qinghong immediately said, \u201cThat can be discussed, but may I know who this gentleman is?\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyes swept over him indifferently, \u201cIf you don\u2019t even know who I am, it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re not qualified to stand here and talk to me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lu Qinghong\u2019s face darkened.Lu Qinghong wanted to scold him so badly but he only looked helplessly at Gu Jingze, unable to say a word.\u201cDo you not want to tell me or is there just nothing much to say about you?\u201d Lu Qinghong said with a smile.Gu Jingze replied, \u201cThese kinds of words are useless to me. I was planning to tell you that you may not be qualified to stand in front of me, but since you\u2019re involved in my woman\u2019s problems, I have to take care of this.\u201dAs he talked, he threw an elegant business card in front of him.It landed perfectly on the table.Shocked, he bent down to look and his face immediately turned black.How did the Yu family get involved with a big shot like that?His face turned pale, but he still did not want to be defeated.He taunted, \u201cFive million should be nothing to Mr. Gu. Why? Can\u2019t you afford it?\u201dGu Jingze scoffed, \u201cI earn every single dollar that I make. I don\u2019t wish to waste them on trash.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he yelled, \u201cGu Jingze, don\u2019t be arrogant! Some of that must be dirty money, right?!\u201dGu Jingze replied, \u201cAs long as this little bit of dirty money can suppress you, it\u2019s enough.\u201dLu Qinghong\u2019s eyes moved. In front of the Gu household, it was like throwing eggs at a stone. However, if he retreated now, they would be at a loss.Lin Che, who was observing at the side, added, \u201cWe will only give you two hundred thousand. Take it or leave it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not happening. Hey, who do you take us for, beggars?\u201dLin Che said, \u201cWith your behavior, you\u2019re not even beggars.\u201dNana got up on the bed and yelled, \u201cYou b****. What did you say? I dare you to say it again!\u201dLu Qinghong was shocked and quickly covered Nana\u2019s mouth.Nana was unsatisfied as she glared angrily at Lu Qinghong.Still holding onto Nana, Lu Qinghong said, \u201cShe\u2019s not very understanding but this matter was also partly the Yu family\u2019s fault.\u201dGu Jingze said, \u201cIf anything under the sky can be priced, then asking for ten million for that word ***** won\u2019t even be enough.\u201d\u201cWhat? What right do you have?!\u201d Nana raised her voice.Lu Qinghong\u2019s face got even paler. He hastily agreed, \u201cI\u2026 Fine, I want two hundred thousand.\u201dAs he said that, he took the check on the table.Lin Che looked at him and then said, \u201cBut I still must warn you. The two hundred thousand is to pay off the Yu family\u2019s debt. You are not to step one foot near the Yu family. If you see them near your gambling dens, you must chase them away!\u201d\u201cWhat? So complicated,\u201d Lu Qinghong thought that there would still be more opportunities to go after the Yu family.Their daughter looked like a water sprite. If she were to become a prostitute, she would definitely do well.He observed them for a long time before planning to take action on the Yu family. He did not expect\u2026Gu Jingze said from the side, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to chase him away, I will send my men there to do it. But I think it might affect your business greatly.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 \u201dFor the Gu household to do the chasing, that would be too much.Lu Qinghong was not happy, but he could only say to Gu Jingze, \u201cRest assured, Mr. Gu. The Yu family will never enter the Lu family\u2019s gambling dens in the future. You have my word.\u201d\u201cI will wait and see then,\u201d he replied, turning back and pulling Lin Che along.Lin Che looked back at the woman on the bed and then followed Gu Jingze out of the ward.Watching the two of them leave, the woman on the bed pushed Lu Qinghong away angrily.\u201cYou useless thing! I got hit and you\u2019re brushing it off with two hundred thousand? I can\u2019t accept it!\u201dLu Qinghong slapped the woman, which stunned her as it was so unexpected.\u201cDid you know that I just saved your life?!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d the woman looked at him pitifully.Lu Qinghong snorted, \u201cYou would offend just about anybody. That was Gu Jingze. Do you dare to mess with the Gu family too?\u201d\u201cGu\u2026 Gu Jingze?\u201d the woman was shocked as she held her cheek.Lu Qinghong muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to do this either, but I can\u2019t sacrifice our lives just for pride, right? Couldn\u2019t you see that I was angry too? However, I definitely cannot handle him. We can only blame the Yu family for having this intention at this time. For them to actually be close to the Gu family, we have no choice but to stay away from them in the future.\u201dThe woman listened and thought that this man was undoubtedly capable. Her heart grew jealous, yet had a sense of longing.It was too bad that a normal person would never be able to reach that high. With her standards, it was already good enough to snag Lu Qinghong. She would not dare to hope for a top-class family like the Gu family.After Lin Che settled the matter, she soon looked up Yu Minmin at her hotel.She had been staying in hotels for several days now. She switched hotels every day to prevent her father from finding her.Perhaps she was really used to it as she appeared just fine. It only looked like she lost a bit of weight.Lin Che said, \u201cThe problem is settled. Sister Yu, you don\u2019t need to worry too much now.\u201dYu Minmin looked at Lin Che, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Gu Jingze helped, right?\u201dShe knew that Lin Che would never be able to pull this off on her own. The Lu family was not a pushover. They definitely would not give up with just a few words.Lin Che nodded, \u201cYes, Gu Jingze suppressed them. I just tagged along.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYu Minmin looked at her gratefully, \u201cThank you\u2026 but\u2026 did you use money?\u201dShe did not believe those people would be honest and not want money.Lin Che replied, \u201cIt was not much. They took two hundred thousand as hush money. They won\u2019t let your father into their gambling dens in the future.\u201dYu Minmin\u2019s face sank and then she looked up at Lin Che, \u201cI\u2019ll return you the money slowly with my salary. Thank you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s alright.\u201dYu Minmin smiled, \u201cIf they manage to stop my father from entering their dens, perhaps the future will be brighter. You\u2019re getting more famous and my salary is increasing. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to pay you back in full soon.\u201dYu Minmin raised her brow and looked at Lin Che, \u201cHowever, it seems like Gu Jingze really treats you well.\u201dLin Che was taken aback. Gu Jingze was indeed a good man, but he was sometimes cold. Sometimes, he was cold on the outside but warm on the inside.Lin Che replied, \u201cBut Gu Jingze\u2026 that guy is really hard to please. He\u2019s full of problems. I won\u2019t talk to you about it anymore; I have to go back. There\u2019s a birthday celebration in a few days.\u201dLin Che returned from the hotel. She stood at the gate and looked at the strict security surrounding the Gu residence. She suddenly realized that she had been under the care of Gu Jingze all this time and felt slightly embarrassed.She was a troublesome woman.When it was time to sleep, Gu Jingze came out of the shower to see Lin Che looking embarrassingly at him.Gu Jingze lifted his head up, \u201cWhat are you staring at me for?\u201dLin Che looked bashfully at Gu Jingze\u2019s face and said, \u201cI think\u2026 From today onwards, let\u2019s switch positions. You can sleep on the bed here while I sleep on the sofa.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her strangely, \u201cWhy?\u201dLin Che reasoned, \u201cBecause you\u2019re so tall, it\u2019s bound to be uncomfortable for you. I\u2019m small so sleeping here is just right for me. We should at least be taking turns; you sleep one night on the couch and then I\u2019ll sleep one night. If it\u2019s always you and we don\u2019t even know when we can divorce, it\u2019s not going to be fair to you.\u201dGu Jingze\u2019s eyes flashed. He smiled at Lin Che and raised an eyebrow, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you just can\u2019t bear to see me like this right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis had nothing to do with that!Lin Che said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m just saying\u2026 Nevermind. If you like the sofa, you can have it.\u201dLin Che\u2019s heart sank. She believed that it was not because she could not bear to see him sleep on the sofa.Why would she? It was just that she was always getting into trouble and she blamed herself for it. She simply felt bad.Lin Che glared at this ignorant Gu Jingze and turned towards the bed. However, Gu Jingze followed closely behind her and sat down on the bed with her.Lin Che looked at him and said, \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201dGu Jingze gazed at Lin Che and suddenly said, \u201cActually, the bed is big enough. We can both sleep here just fine.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Che thought she had misheard him.As Gu Jingze spoke, he embraced her and they both fell on the bed.It was a huge double bed, so it definitely had more than enough space for the two of them. But what was the meaning of them sleeping together?Lin Che struggled as she tried to get up, \u201cNo no, Gu Jingze. We can\u2019t sleep on the same bed!\u201dHer waist was pulled back by him despite her efforts. She fell back into his embrace.Gu Jingze lowered his head to look at her, \u201cWhy? What are you afraid of? Are you scared that you won\u2019t be able to control yourself?\u201dLin Che\u2019s face was starting to blush, \u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t control myself?!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t control yourself from coming on to me,\u201d Gu Jingze replied.Lin Che glared at him, \u201cNonsense! How can I not control myself? Men are the ones who are wild at heart!\u201d\u201cOh, if you\u2019re afraid that I can\u2019t control myself, you\u2019re thinking too much. I\u2019ve been in the same room as you for so long and I\u2019ve never touched you. I will definitely not lose it on a bed. You can rest assured!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che just did not want to sleep on the same bed as him.\u201cNo, no. I really can\u2019t!\u201d Lin Che said in a fluster.Still, Gu Jingze pressed her down, surrounding her entire body.\u201cDon\u2019t move and just go to sleep!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d As if she could go to sleep like that!\u201cWhat nonsense are you thinking about? Just go to sleep now!\u201d Gu Jingze said from behind.Lin Che was speechless. She could not move at all and could only breathe heavily there. She felt the man behind her slowly start to relax, but his eyes were wide awake and he was staring at her. It was only after some time did fatigue slowly creep in.Strangely enough, he was able to sleep like that.She was also getting very tired. It was not long before she fell asleep in that position too.The next day, Gu Jingze woke up energized as usual.Lin Che had a premonition that he was going to be in her bed forever\u2026Perhaps the sofa was really uncomfortable for sleeping and he got sick of it. So even her vulgar sleeping habits did not deter him from sleeping on the bed.Thinking about it, perhaps it was only right to let him sleep there.Still, she intended to sleep on the sofa instead. Who knew they would end up sleeping together\u2026The Panda Programme Festival soon started.Because Lin Che was nominated for the Best Newcomer Award, the company made it very grand. They hired professionals to help Lin Che handle the award.Lin Che was already all dressed up at home. Looking at the dress\u2019s long skirt, it split all the way up, which Lin Che was not quite used to. However, it was the company\u2019s arrangement. They told her that there would be a lot of big shots at the awards. If Lin Che wanted to steal the spotlight, it was not going to be so easy. Thus, they specially chose an eye-catching dress for Lin Che to wear.However, Lin Che was not interested in stealing the spotlight at all. Attending a grand event like this made her satisfied.She looked at herself in the mirror and felt that something was still not right.Gu Jingze walked in to see her standing in front of the mirror adjusting herself. With her slim figure in a waisted dress, she looked extremely elegant and rather sexy.Gu Jingze narrowed his eyes as he walked over and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLin Che turned to him, \u201cDo you think I look weird like this?\u201dGu Jingze observed her. The black velvet dress revealed her fair and tender thigh, complimenting each other perfectly. He said, \u201cWeird in what way? You look fine.\u201d\u201cDo you think I look good?\u201d Lin Che asked.Gu Jingze smiled and moved closer. His voice was low and melodious, \u201cI think you look even better without anything on\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Che\u2019s face flushed, \u201cGet lost!\u201dGu Jingze laughed and said, \u201cYou asked me.\u201dLin Che\u2019s face was red, \u201cWho knew you were such a gangster?!\u201dGu Jingze smiled as he checked her out. He thought that slit in the dress was indeed not bad.it seemed like the dress would be so easy to strip\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis heart beat a little faster. He quickly turned around and headed out. He wondered if he had been suppressing himself too much lately. Otherwise, he could not explain why his thoughts wandered off the track to a more evil place whenever he looked at her.Perhaps it had to do with his age, so his body instinctively wanted women?Lin Che turned to look at Gu Jingze, \u201cOh, right. We still have one ticket for today. If you\u2019re interested, you can go take a look.\u201dGu Jingze snapped back to reality and looked at the ticket she passed to him.

She dragged her long dress helplessly to attend the event.Just outside the Panda Programme Festival area, the atmosphere was already different.Lin Che held her dress and walked in, accompanied by Yu Minmin.Yu Minmin told her, \u201cYou should have a big chance this time. Even if you don\u2019t win the award, at least we got to be here.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think my odds are that high.

Everybody believes that bad women have good acting skills.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not for certain. Your role was outstanding too,\u201d Yu Minmin smiled and patted Lin Che\u2019s arm.Lin Che looked outside to see a newcomer actress from another popular show walking on the red carpet. The host introduced her energetically and said, \u201cWang Qingchu\u2019s performance in the TV series \u2018Women\u2019s World\u2019 is remarkable. Her portrayal of the antagonist has been engraved deeply in people\u2019s hearts. She is only 20 and is the youngest out of all the nominees.\u201dLin Che watched as everyone looked at Wang Qingchu enter the scene. A roar of lights flashed everywhere. She shrugged and looked at Yu Minmin.As Lin Che mentioned, this was her competitor.At only 20 years old, she indeed looked radiant.Yu Minmin heard people beside her discussing openly, \u201cIt seems like she might win the award; she looks so proud and confident as if she already won.\u201d\u201cYes. Also, she recently got into a relationship with that Liu Kai. She has been leading the hot topics. I also think she\u2019ll win big tonight.\u201dEveryone looked at Lin Che. There was a hint of disdain in their eyes.Lin Che turned around and Yu Minmin spoke in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t mind about what they think. In this industry, when there\u2019s nothing to talk about, people will stir up nonsense. Live and let them live.\u201dLin Che nodded, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Sister Yu. I know.\u201dJust then, someone from behind hit the back of her head.\u201cOuch, who\u2019s that?\u201dShe turned back to see Gu Jingyu, someone she had not seen in a long time. She had no idea when he caught up behind her.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d he asked.Lin Che asked, \u201cGu Jingyu, why are you here?\u201d\u201cI saw you standing here stupidly, so I came over to check.\u201d\u201cHow am I stupid\u2026\u201d Lin Che gently rubbed her head.Gu Jingyu said, \u201cSilly. Come on! Let\u2019s not wait anymore. Walk with me.\u201d\u201cHuh? Aren\u2019t you supposed to come in later? I don\u2019t have anyone walking on the red carpet with me today.\u201d\u201cAm I not paired up with you now?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Lin Che was pulled along by him and she stumbled forward.\u201cBut what? Let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll be with you.\u201dHow could that be?Although she knew that Gu Jingyu loved breaking the rules since they didn\u2019t matter to him, she always followed the rules in the industry.Gu Jingyu was supposed to be a part of the finale walk. As he pulled Lin Che along, everybody looked on in envy. When it was his turn, he dragged Lin Che with him and placed her hand in the nook of his arm as they walked on the red carpet together.The host inside was shocked but was also aware that Gu Jingyu often did not go by the book, so he reacted quickly.Everyone looked at the two of them on the red carpet enviously. The lights flashed nonstop and the host commented on how Gu Jingyu abandoned the female lead and walked the red carpet with the supporting actress instead.It fed the rumor that was hyped up by everyone for a while.Yu Minmin watched them from behind and shook her head speechlessly.They finally walked to the end of the red carpet and went to their own seats.Sitting at the front, Wang Qingchu suddenly turned back to Lin Che and smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ve been nominated together this time.\u201dLin Che smiled along, \u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cI think your sword is pretty big this time. There\u2019s Gu Jingyu and Mu Feiran after all. Even the supporting roles had Lin Li and the likes. It\u2019s impossible for newcomers like us; none of us are old. We\u2019re already lucky to be famous. Who knew we\u2019d become the dark horses?\u201dEven though the words were self-deprecating, her tone had a sense of pride in it.She implied that Lin Che\u2019s show was famous because of the stars in it while hers had no big stars. She hinted that she got here with her own effort.Lin Che smiled and said, \u201cReally? I don\u2019t know why but no big celebrity wanted to take up that script of yours. It seemed like a good script.\u201dShe really meant that the script was trash with no substance. Of course, if that was true, big stars would not take it.Wang Qingchu\u2019s face changed subtly. She glanced at Lin Che and groaned deep down in her heart. It was just because of Gu Jingyu\u2019s backing.Just then, a number of people passed by and hurriedly greeted Lin Che when they saw her.She knew some of them while she had not met others before. She had not known or even seen some of them.Although Lin Che was always filming, she never joined any gathering in the circle. This Festival was like an enormous gathering. All the celebrities that someone could think of were there. They all had a film this year. This was also the first time so many people actually knew who she was and there were people who wanted to know her.After being bombarded for a long time, the ceremony was finally about to start. Everyone returned back to their places.Lin Che let out a breath and said to Yu Minmin, \u201cI exchanged a lot of WeChat numbers just now.\u201dYu Minmin replied, \u201cOf course. You\u2019re now a rising star! There are many people who want to know you.\u201d\u201cWhy would they want to know me?\u201d Lin Che asked curiously.Yu Minmin said, \u201cNetworking is important in this industry. Who knows in the future if favors are going to be needed? You\u2019re famous now but the future is endless. Of course, they want to get to know you early.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Che never expected herself to be already of value to others. \u201cI thought I was still new.\u201d \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re only new this year. In the future, you\u2019re going to get more famous!\u201d Yu Minmin smiled at her.\u201cWho knows? With more newcomers, I don\u2019t know if I might get photographed on the beach.\u201dBecause of her past experience, Lin Che did not feel optimistic.In the front, Wang Qingchu watched and snorted. She turned back. The people on her side were indeed a lot less. She muttered in her heart that it was only because of Gu Jingyu; what was the big deal? She did not believe that Lin Che could rely on him forever.The awards ceremony soon started.Wang Qingchu left quietly.In the single room outside, someone gasped.Wang Qingchu gasped seductively, \u201cPresident Chen, you promised. This year\u2019s Best Newcomer Award was supposed to be mine.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHm, yours. It\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t see how arrogant that Lin Che was! She\u2019s making use of Gu Jingyu\u2019s affection to steal tomorrow\u2019s headlines. You can\u2019t give the award to her!\u201d\u201cFine, fine, I won\u2019t give it to her. Baby, let\u2019s continue\u2026\u201dWang Qingchu fixed her makeup before returning. She looked at Lin Che behind in contempt, listening to Yu Minmin tell her what to say for her acceptance speech. She smiled even more and said, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time, Lin Che. I know your acting is not bad and you work hard, but this award is definitely mine.\u201d She turned around, \u201cEven if you have Gu Jingyu, it\u2019s useless. I can tell you this now\u2026 You have no idea what kind of backing I have!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Che bit her lips and stared at Wang Qingchu\u2019s back. Her fists were clenched tightly.Yu Minmin never thought that Wang Qingchu would be so arrogant.Maybe she was too young to control her manners.Lin Che smiled coldly, \u201cIs the Panda Awards about skills on the screen or off the screen? Seriously\u2026\u201dYu Minmin pressed Lin Che\u2019s hand, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll check it out.\u201dAs Yu Minmin got up and left, Lin Che sat there alone. She overheard some people behind her talking among themselves.\u201cIt looks like the Best Newcomer Award is going to Wang Qingchu.\u201d\u201cBut Lin Che is also not bad.\u201d\u201cActually, I knew a long ago that Wang Qingchu snagged a high-flyer from the Panda Programme. I\u2019ve seen them a few times already.\u201d\u201cOh my God. Then it really might be her. No wonder she\u2019s so full of herself, walking on the red carpet alone with such confidence. I guess it was already internally decided. Isn\u2019t that a pity for Lin Che?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no choice.\u201dLin Che had already decided not to hold high hopes in getting the award, but she still felt unhappy hearing that. If it was all based on effort, she would be content with the loss. However, she was really not satisfied to be beaten this way.The world was unfair and even more so in this industry. Lin Che simply did not like that something so unjust like this was happening to her.Was it not possible to fight fair and square based on popularity and skills?Wang Qingchu occasionally turned back to Lin Che, raising an eyebrow and smiling smugly. She looked so triumphant.Lin Che only looked ahead and quietly took deep breaths.Celebrities went up the stage one by one as the awards from the Music Award to the Motion Picture Award were given out. Lin Che stared in front. When it was time for the Best Newcomer Award, she silently sat up straight.Wang Qingchu turned back to her once again and smiled slightly at Lin Che, \u201cNo need to be so excited for it; this award is going to be mine. How unlucky for you to have met me this year. Better luck next time.\u201d Wang Qingchu covered her mouth as she pretended to suddenly recall something, \u201cOh, I just remembered. You only get one chance in your life for this award. You won\u2019t be a newcomer next year.\u201dLin Che stared at Wang Qingchu, \u201cAt least I got here with my own efforts and ability instead of relying on whatever that goes on backstage.\u201d\u201cHa, the backstage is also part of our capabilities, especially in this industry. However, you probably can\u2019t beat me in that aspect anyway.\u201dThe entire hall hushed as the host began to speak, \u201cThis year\u2019s newcomers are really an entirely new generation. Especially in the first half of the year, there was hit drama after hit drama. The second half of the year was full of surprises too. There were so many excellent works with excellent reputations and ratings.\u201d\u201cAnd thus, we are now announcing our Best Newcomer this year.\u201dAfter they rolled the video of all the nominees, the host smiled and said, \u201cWho will be this year\u2019s Best Newcomer? Is it Wang Qingchu? Is it Gu Ningning? Can it be Situ Xing or Lin Che?\u201dAt that moment, another guest presenter looked across the entire audience down the stage. All the cameras were going back and forth between the four nominees. Lin Che sat there a little emotionless and stiff. She was still not used to being stared at. On the other hand, Wang Qingchu was full of confidence and looked right ahead at the cameras very proudly.Just then, the guest presenter smiled and announced, \u201cThis year\u2019s Best Newcomer Award goes to Lin Che!\u201dBelow, Lin Che heard her own name and was shocked.She sat there unable to move until the people beside her nudged her and she quickly got up.Still a little dazed, she could barely see anything with the spotlight shining right into her face. She got up on the stage and took the award from the guest presenter.Below, Wang Qingchu had already stood up but when she heard Lin Che\u2019s name, her face turned green.Looking in front, she held her award and stood behind the lectern. She nervously held the microphone and smiled as she said, \u201cThank you, creators of \u2018Swords of Love\u2019. Thank you, director, for giving me this opportunity to play such an important role. And also, thank you to my fellow colleagues and crew for teaching me so much. Thank you all so much\u2026\u201dWang Qingchu could not listen anymore. She got up, not caring about anyone staring at her, and stomped out.Outside, she walked all over the place until she found President Chen at the back.She yelled furiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you? You said that you would give it to me. How could you\u2026 You dare lie to me! Are you toying with me?\u201dShe was so embarrassed. She talked herself up so much full of confidence but got nothing in the end.\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to either. I really wrote your name. Even if everyone thinks Lin Che is better, I still believe in you. But today\u2026\u201d President Chen said quietly, \u201cI can only say that Lin Che has a backing far stronger than yours. I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHonestly, there was no other way. I also wish she wasn\u2019t such a heavyweight. However, I really can\u2019t touch this person. I can\u2019t help you even if I wanted to.\u201dWang Qingchu heard him and was stunned. Her face scrunched up in anger.Very soon, Lin Che got off the stage and saw Yu Minmin. She said in surprise, \u201cI honestly never thought that this award would be mine. God, what is going on?\u201dYu Minmin smiled and replied, \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s still some fairness in this world.\u201dLin Che nodded her head vigorously.She could not conceal the delight on her face.Yu Minmin said, \u201cRemember to treat us.\u201d\u201cOf course, I will treat you all. Heh heh.\u201dThe awards ceremony ended. As Lin Che was walking out, her phone rang.She took it out and saw that it was Gu Jingze.She hurriedly answered the call, \u201cGu Jingze.\u201dHearing the joy in her voice, Gu Jingze smiled peacefully, \u201cDid it end?\u201d\u201cYes, it just ended.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you outside. Come out.\u201d\u201cAh, really?\u201d\u201cOf course. You won, so shouldn\u2019t you treat me to a meal?\u201d Gu Jingze asked.\u201cOkay okay. Of course, I\u2019ll treat you out.\u201dLin Che hung up and ran outside to see Gu Jingze\u2019s car there.Lin Che hopped in and excitedly handed her trophy for Gu Jingze to see.Gu Jingze smiled and said, \u201cCongratulations to you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLin Che said in amazement, \u201cI still thought that it was strange how everyone said Wang Qingchu knew someone formidable, so the award would be hers. In the end, it was still mine.\u201dGu Jingze smiled at her, \u201cThat proves you know someone even more formidable.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dGu Jingze did not continue and already started driving, \u201cLet\u2019s go.

She was so angry that her face got green.The spotlight followed her as she walked down the stage. She was surrounded by people congratulating her and reporters going up to her to interview her. She radiated with pride.Lin Li huffed angrily and swiped the cup in her hand.\u201cLin Che actually got an award!\u201dHan Caiying watched as she tried to comfort Lin Li, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now that she has Gu Jingze behind her, of course, things will be different. Wait until you marry into the Qin family. It\u2019ll be the same for you.\u201dLin Li gritted her teeth and tried to believe that was true. However, between the Qin family and the Gu family, there was some difference. The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.Meanwhile\u2026Gu Jingze took Lin Che to a restaurant. Lin Che exclaimed, \u201cWow! This looks like an expensive place. Do you seriously want me to treat you?\u201dGu Jingze looked at her, \u201cYou won an award today, so shouldn\u2019t you be treating me?\u201dLin Che pouted, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think you would pick such an expensive place.\u201dThis was a Chinese restaurant, but anyone who saw the outside would have assumed that this was a high-end restaurant.The entrance was beautifully decorated and there were few people inside. It seemed like they all had private rooms. Each room had a name beautifully calligraphed on the door. The staff saw the two of them enter and quickly bowed their heads to greet them politely. They smiled so naturally and their makeup was pleasant. The staff must have undergone extremely strict training.\u201cMr. Gu, would you like your usual room? We always keep it reserved for you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dGu Jingze brought Lin Che in. As they walked, he said, \u201cThe food here is very good. Once you try it, you\u2019ll know. And they do such a clean job so it\u2019s very homely.\u201dLin Che retorted, \u201cIf you want to eat homecooked food so bad, why are we at such an expensive place? We should go home so I can cook for you.\u201dGu Jingze looked at her scornfully, \u201cIf I let a klutz like you cook for me, I\u2019ll end up eating slag.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026 The last time was an accident.\u201dGu Jingze refused to believe her. Furthermore, he specially brought her here but she was not even appreciative of this. What an ignorant woman.\u201cI come here a lot. The food is fantastic. You\u2019ll know once you try it.\u201dHe truly wanted to get her approval. In his heart, he wanted her to like the things that he did.From the start, he thought of the good food at this place and for some reason, he wanted to share it with her. However, she still complained that it was expensive.Lin Che followed him in and they sat down. She could see the lake right outside. This must have been the best spot out of the whole restaurant.Gu Jingze was responsible for ordering the dishes since he was familiar with this place. He would certainly know which dishes were good.He ordered a table\u2019s worth of food. Lin Che could feel her pockets crying and her heart bleeding.It felt so expensive.After a while, the food arrived.Lin Che looked at the food. They looked so appetizing and delicious.\u201cTry it,\u201d Gu Jingze was like a noble Persian cat that ate with such graceful and slow movements.Lin Che did not care about table manners. She took and ate whatever was good.They were indeed delicious.She started taking big bites and gulping down her drink. She happily ate.Gu Jingze said quietly, \u201cEat slower.\u201dLin Che replied, \u201cIt tastes better with bigger bites.\u201dGu Jingze shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not good for your digestion.\u201dLin Che said, \u201cYou eat to taste food. If you eat for your digestion, you might as well be eating porridge every day.\u201d\u201cYou only know how to spout nonsense,\u201d Gu Jingze glared at her.However, it was undeniable that seeing her enjoy food like that, he somehow felt a sense of accomplishment. It was as if he got a major approval for what he liked.Gu Jingze looked joyful as he watched her eat.\u201cSlowly. See? You got food all over your mouth now,\u201d he reached out his hand and wiped the sides of her mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll wash after eating. Eh, you eat too. I haven\u2019t seen you move,\u201d Lin Che talked with her mouth full.At the same time, on the outside.Mo Huiling entered the restaurant with her good friends.The people around Mo Huiling have always envied her. She had been close to the Gu family since she was young and everybody knew that Gu Jingze was her boyfriend all along.They would often hear her showing off but even when she showed off, they could not say anything.Everyone could only continue to envy her. So since she was young, she was always the center of attention. And because she was childhood sweethearts with Gu Jingze, nobody could displace her position.Even until now, although Gu Jingze was already married, it was a secret marriage. Not many people outside their circle knew about his marriage. Furthermore, they did not hold a wedding ceremony, so nobody knew that Gu Jingze had another woman by his side.\u201cHuiling, it\u2019s so expensive here. We always eat here and you always pay for us; I feel bad,\u201d her friend said politely.Mo Huiling could not conceal the pride in her tone. She generously said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. There\u2019s a room here that Gu Jingze always has reserved for him. Every time we come here, we just need to use that room and all the expenses will be paid for by Gu Jingze.\u201d\u201cReally? Gu Jingze is so generous to you for letting you use his personally reserved room.\u201d\u201cThese are nothing to Jingze,\u201d Mo Huiling said as she strutted in with her high heels.Everybody behind chimed in, \u201cThat is true. To the Gu family, that bit of money takes mere minutes to earn back. Huiling, I\u2019m so envious of you.\u201dMo Huiling raised her head proudly.The staff immediately recognized Mo Huiling. She came here often, so everybody knew.Looking at Mo Huiling, the staff quickly greeted, \u201cMiss Mo.\u201dMo Huiling requested, \u201cThe same room. There\u2019s four of us today.\u201dAs she spoke, she gravitated towards the room.However, the staff hurriedly held her back and looked inside with a hint of worry. She said shyly, \u201cSorry, Miss Mo, but\u2026 Mr. Gu is using that room tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Mo Huiling asked. \u201cJingze is here? I\u2019m going to look for him.\u201dThe staff quickly stopped her from taking another step, \u201cBut\u2026 Mr. Gu is with a guest.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Huiling was shocked.Her friends felt Mo Huiling\u2019s embarrassment and tried to defuse the situation, \u201cLet\u2019s go to another room. They are all the same. Maybe he\u2019s having a business meeting.\u201dMo Huiling could only force a dry smile and let her friends go to another room.However, she stared intensely at the room with suspicion in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
