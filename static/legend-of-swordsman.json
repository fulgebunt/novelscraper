The speed of her sword was fast. The man standing beside her and giving her advice was a young boy wearing black called Jian Wushuang.Judging by their appearance, both of them were only about 15 or 16 years old. But Jian Wushuang could already point out her shortcomings one by one with his perceptive gaze.After finishing a complete Sword Art, Jian Meng\u2019er stood up, sheathing her sword. She smiled and went over to Jian Wushuang.\u201cBro Wushuang, what do you think of my swordsmanship?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er asked.\u201cAurora Sword Art requires high speed. If someone could finish the whole sword art within 40 breaths worth of time, they would be at the Profound level. You just finished it within 38 breaths of time. That\u2019s quite good,\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cThanks for your help, without you I could not have reached the Profound level in this short period of two months,\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er said.Jian Wushuang shook his head secretly.He knew that his instruction was part of it, but what was more important was that Jian Meng\u2019er herself had great talent in the sword. In the\u00a0Sword Marquis Mansion, where most people paid attention to practicing swordsmanship, perhaps Jian Meng\u2019er was the one with the highest talent in swordsmanship, apart from himself.\u201cBro Wushuang, how long does it take you to finish the Aurora Sword Arts? Within 30 breaths?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er asked.\u201cWithin 30 breaths?\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled but did not answer her.Anyone who finished set of Aurora Sword Arts within 30 breaths worth of time would have reached the Profound level. However, he could finish the whole set in 23 breaths of time if he went all out.It meant that he had reached great heights long ago!\u201cWith your talent in swordsmanship, you must finish it in less than 30 breaths, except\u2026\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er looked at Jian Wushuang with hesitation and sorrow in her eyes.Jian Wushuang certainly knew what she implied. He smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll become a Warrior soon.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er was doubtful. After all, he had said that four years ago.Jian Wushuang was the lineal disciple of the Sword Marquis Mansion. His father was the Sword Pavilion Master and he had been recognized as the most powerful in Sword Marquis Mansion. Jian Wushuang grew up under his father\u2019s cultivation and instruction.Thanks to his father, he was born into a position of eminence and was absolutely one of the top young-generation disciples in the Sword Marquis Mansion. However, all that changed greatly four years ago when he was 12 years old.During that year, his father had left to travel, but thereafter, he had not been heard from and no one knew where he was.Misfortune never comes alone. It was also in that year when he should have started to cultivate spiritual power, which was essential for him to become a Warrior. However, he found that he could not cultivate spiritual power no matter how hard he tried.Failing to cultivate spiritual power was a nightmare for a Warrior.It should be known that to practice Martial Arts, a Warrior needed to absorb spirit from heaven and earth and then to cultivate spiritual power in his body.Spiritual power was fundamental to every Warrior. It was impossible for one to be a Warrior if one could not cultivate spiritual power. Such a person would be looked down as trash in the Sword Marquis Mansion, where strength was everything.During the last four years, Jian Wushuang had never given up. Instead, he had continued to work hard to become a real Warrior. He hoped to succeed his father\u2019s seat and be given charge of the Sword Pavilion one day. But reality was cruel.Although Jian Wushuang could not cultivate spiritual power, his talent in swordsmanship was amazing.He practiced swordsmanship under his father\u2019s instruction since he was young. Because of his father\u2019s status and his great talent, he remembered sword arts quickly and could fully comprehend them after only being he taught once. Though he was young, there was no doubt that he was number one in terms of swordsmanship.But it meant nothing to practice swordsmanship without spiritual power.\u201cIt\u2019s real this time,\u201d Jian Wushuang said confidently.\u201cWell.\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er smiled, but did not take it seriously.\u201cMeng\u2019er, Wushuang.\u201d A kindly middle-aged man walked into the courtyard.\u201cFather,\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er called out.\u201cUncle Lan,\u201d Jian Wushuang called out after.This middle-aged man was Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s father\u2014the Great Elder of the Red Martial Hall in the Sword Marquis Mansion\u2014Jian Lan.\u201cWushuang, you have instructed Meng\u2019er in swordsmanship all day. That\u2019s very kind of you,\u201d Jian Lan smiled and said.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, \u201cUncle Lan, it\u2019s getting late. I\u2019d better be off.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Jian Lan and Jian Meng\u2019er watched Jian Wushuang leave.As Jian Wushuang disappeared from sight, the mild look on Jian Lan vanished.\u201cMeng\u2019er, how much progress have you made?\u201d Jian Lan asked her in a low and deep voice.\u201cIn Aurora Sword Art, I have reached the Profound level,\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er said with a stern look.\u201cGreat.\u201d Jian Lan held his hands with exultation on his face. \u201cFor almost four years, you have been with that loser every day in order for him to teach you swordsmanship. After four years of suffering, you finally get something in return.\u201d\u201cNow you have learned all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of the Sword Pavilion to the Profound level. The next step is to carry out our plan.\u201d\u201cFather, are you sure that we can do it?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er frowned and asked, as her eyes looked cold and merciless.\u201cThose who are involved in a major event do not worry about trifles.\u201d Jian Lan\u2019s eyes became cold and sharp again. \u201cAll things depend on what happens tomorrow.\u201d\u2026Jian Wushuang went back to his own courtyard. After eating something quickly, he sat cross-legged on the bed.\u201cWhen I told Meng\u2019er today that I would become a real Warrior soon, she didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled and his right hand involuntarily touched his lower abdomen.In his abdomen, a grey stone bead, which was the size of a baby\u2019s fist, had existed since he was born and no one knew where it came from.But it was the chief reason which prevented him from becoming a real Warrior.Others thought that Jian Wushuang was a good-for-nothing who could not cultivate any spiritual power. Actually, only he himself knew that it was not true. The 108 meridians in his body were unblocked a long time ago. It was quite easy for him to cultivate spiritual power.However, the spirit that he cultivated from the heaven and earth was totally absorbed by the grey stone bead in his abdomen before it could turn into spiritual power.In other words, all the spirit that he cultivated from nature became \u2018food\u2019 for the grey stone bead. While the grey stone was growing constantly, Jian Wushuang found that the bead was like a bottomless pit that had no limit to its volume.In the last four years, he had been cultivating spirit every day to fill the grey stone bead up as fast as possible, so that the bead would stop absorbing his spiritual energy which would allow him to cultivate spiritual power in his body and become a Warrior.Yesterday, he found that the grey stone bead would soon be saturated. By today, the grey stone bead would reach its limit. Then he could cultivate spiritual power in his body.\u201cLet me get started.\u201d Jian Wushuang started his daily cultivation and awaited the changes.Things went as he had expected. The grey stone bead in his body reached its ultimate limit while more and more spirit energy was absorbed\u201cHum~~~!\u201dThe grey stone bead suddenly spun in his body and the rotation was getting faster and faster, while it was getting smaller and smaller.Unexpectedly, the grey stone bead, which had existed in Jian Wushuang\u2019s body for such a long time, completely vanished with a tremble.\u201cIt\u2019s gone! The bead disappeared, didn\u2019t it?\u201d A burst of great joy came into Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes for one second, but the next moment, he suddenly opened his eyes wide.A rush of information flew into his mind.\u201cHeavenly Creation Skill!\u201d\u201cForm a supreme Martial Art with the Technique of Creation from heaven and earth!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is there one more Cultivation Method occurring in my mind?\u201d Jian Wushuang was startled at first, but at the next moment, he understood that the Cultivation Method was related to the gray stone bead.Jian Wushuang was not a stranger to cultivation methods. In the Sword Marquis Mansion, disciples who condensed spiritual power could pick any appropriate Cultivation Method at the Cultivation Pavilion by themselves. Although there were thousands of Cultivation Methods in this world, he had never heard of any Cultivation Method that dared to name itself after cultivating from the heaven and earth like the Heavenly Creation Skill.\u201cThe gray stone bead was hidden inside me all this time and absorbed all of the spiritual power that I condensed for four years. It is so special that the bead disappeared and left a Cultivation Method for me. This must be extraordinary!\u201d Jian Wushuang carefully looked through the Heavenly Creation Skill at once.\u201cThe path of Martial Arts is a fight against fate, to enable creation with the power of heaven and earth. The Heavenly Creation Skill is divided into many realms, including the Nine Heavens of the Divine Path, Ultimate Spiritual Sea, Supreme Gold Core Realm, Yin-Yang Breaking, Venerable Master, Flying to the Ninth Heaven, and so on. Every realm defies the Heavens and current conventions!\u201cUsing Martial Arts based on the Heavenly Creation Skill implies defying the Heavens\u2014every step is out of the ordinary!\u201cAnyone who defies the Heavens is nature\u2019s enemy, also known a Defiant Cultivator!\u201dIt was a few simple words, but they made Jian Wushuang freeze.\u201cCultivating in defiance of the Heavens? Deviant Cultivation?\u201d he thought.Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and slowly calmed down. Although it was just a brief introduction with several simple words, he could still see the outstanding differences of this Cultivation Method.In Jian Wushuang\u2019s understanding, for Warriors generally, the Way of Martial Arts began with the Spirit Path.The Seven Steps of the Spirit Path, Transforming a Spiritual Sea, Formation of the Gold Core Realm, Yin-Yang Void Realm, and then the legendary Realm of Divine Transcendence were all Realms of Martial Arts that were known to Jian Wushuang. However, the steps for cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill and its every Realm were quite different from what he had known.Just in the beginning, one was the Seven Steps of the Spirit Path, while the other was the Nine Heavens of the Divine Path!One only had seven levels, but the other had a full nine levels.This completely went against cultivating conventions!Its division of Realms violated the natural order and convention, so it was no wonder that people who cultivated this Cultivation Method were destined to defy the Heavens.This was a real Heaven defying cultivation method!Cultivating this Method meant going against the natural order\u2026 Deviant Cultivation!Jian Wushuang hunkered on the bed, but at the moment his mood was extremely complex.Jian Wushuang was shocked and afraid, but the excitement in his heart was hard to hide.Such a Heaven defying cultivation method was hiding inside the gray stone bead?What should I do?\u201cA Heaven defying cultivation method is in front of me, but I don\u2019t know whether I should cultivate it or not.\u201d Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly. However, this hesitation only remained for a moment, and then he quickly made a decision.What\u2019s wrong with Deviant Cultivation? As the Heavenly Creation Skill says, in fact, the way of Martial Arts is fighting against fate and creation with the heaven and earth. Warriors are not tolerated by heaven and earth. In that case, why shouldn\u2019t my cultivation defy the Heavens?Jian Wushuang really could not find any reason to stop him from cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill. Moreover, he had been tortured by the gray stone bead for four years, and now that the bead finally compensated him with such a Cultivation Method. If he did not cultivate it, he would not be satisfied because of the grievances he had suffered for four years.No longer hesitant, Jian Wushuang immediately began to cultivate this Method according to the instructions in the Heavenly Creation Skill.The vast spiritual power of heaven and earth continuously flooded into his body, and his 108 meridians absorbed it crazily. The power ran in his body according to a unique path. After a large circle of vital energy, this power gathered toward Jian Wushuang\u2019s Dantian.The night passed quickly.Early the next morning, while it was still dark, before sunrise.Jian Wushuang opened his eyes slowly, while hunkered on his bed. He had cultivated the whole night. Looking at his right palm, he saw a ray of spiritual power emerging. His eyes could not help shining in excitement.\u201cThe First Heaven of the Divine Path!\u201dAfter one night of cultivation, not only had he condensed the first ray of Spiritual Power, but his Dantian had stored more power. In terms of Martial Arts cultivating, as long as a person could condense Spiritual Power, even a part of it, he would become a true Warrior.The Heavenly Creation Skill is really extraordinary!After only one night, I have stored so much Spiritual Power in my body. This cultivating speed is much faster than that in the Sword Marquis Mansion. Moreover, I feel that the strength I can release is much stronger than the First Step of the Spirit Path.Jian Wushuang shook his arms and felt his strength at the moment.The First Heaven of the Divine Path was much the same as the First Step of the Spirit Path for normal Warriors, but there was an obvious difference in strength. After reaching the First Heaven of the Divine Path, the strength Jian Wushuang could unleash was unquestionably stronger than Warriors reaching the First Step of the Spirit Path.The beginning of the Heavenly Creation Skill was the Nine Heavens of the Divine Path, which included nine levels.\u201cThe strength that I can release is stronger than ordinary Warriors from the First Step of the Spirit Path.\u00a0Does it mean that when I reach the Seventh Heaven of the Divine Path, I can easily outclass Warriors from the peak\u00a0of the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path? Therefore, when I arrive at the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path, which is the peak of the Divine Path, the strength I can use will be more powerful than experts in the Spiritual Sea Realm?\u201d A flicker of fear passed through his eyes.\u201cAmazing.\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly Creation Skill is too strong!\u201dIts cultivation speed was much faster than ordinary methods. The key was that its every step would defy the Heavens!Each Realm could go against the natural order and conventions.In addition, the Cultivation Method contained a secret method.\u201cSoul-Devouring Secret Skill!\u201d Jian Wushuang read to himself.The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill was extremely aggressive and Heaven defying.It was more a forbidden skill rather than secret method. It belonged to the kind that would kill 1,000 enemies at the price of sacrificing 800 soldiers from one\u2019s own side.Anyway, just seeing the introduction to this secret method, he could not help fearing it. He did not intend to cultivate the secret method right now. After he improved his cultivation for a while, he could study it more carefully.\u201cWarrior!\u201d\u201cI, Jian Wushuang, have finally become a real Warrior!\u201dHis heart roared crazily because he had suffered all kinds of humiliation for four years. Now he finally condensed his own Spiritual Power and became a real Warrior. That made him want to loudly scream out.He was Jian Wushuang, with a sword in hand, no one is his match!He was absolutely not trash!\u2026After a simple wash, Jian Wushuang went outside immediately.He could not wait to tell Jian Meng\u2019er the news that he had become a Warrior. He wanted to give her a surprise.\u201cMeng\u2019er, I told you that I would definitely become a Warrior. Not only that, but in the future, I would become as strong as my father. I will become the top Warrior in Sword Marquis Mansion, with the Triple Kill Sword in hand, and in charge of the Sword Pavillion!\u201d He had anticipation in his heart.His father had not been heard from since four years ago, after which he had made the decision.He hoped one day that he would become strong enough to succeed his father\u2019s position and take charge of the Sword Pavilion. This was the greatest wish of his life!He could not condense Spiritual Power before, so he was far from this dream, but now it was totally different!\u201cHave you heard the news that just now, Jian Lan, the Great Elder of Red Martial Hall, united the entire Hall to make a demand to the Mansion Master to nominate his daughter, Jian Meng\u2019er, as the Sword Pavilion Master and to take charge of the Sword Pavilion!\u201dJian Wushuang stopped at once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is it a joke? \u201d Jian Wushuang laughed and didn\u2019t take it seriously.After all, for these four years, he stayed with Jian Meng\u2019er almost every day, and Jian Lan had always been kind and taken particular care of him. As a result, they got along well with each other. Jian Wushuang, even treated them like his family, keeping no secrets from them.His greatest wish which was to take charge of the Sword Pavilion had been known to them, both Jian Lan and Jian Meng\u2019er.In addition, it had been a tradition that the Sword Pavilion Master could only be selected from the Sword Pavilion. And Jian Meng\u2019er, like her father, was committed to Red Martial Hall.In Sword Marquis Mansion, Sword Pavilion and Red Martial Hall belonged to two different factions, which competed for dominance.Sword Marquis Mansion, in its early days, concentrated on intensive research in swordsmanship, which can be inferred from the surname, Jian, of each clansman. However, with its gradual prosperity and development, juniors of the Marquis\u2019 mansion also branched into other weapons. This was especially if they were more gifted in them than in swordsmanship.Later, there were more and more such juniors eventually leading to the formation of Red Martial Hall. The existence of these two factions never led to open conflict, though there was always an undercurrent of rivalry. Now the relationship between them was especially acrimonious. Since Jian Meng\u2019er, the daughter of the Great Elder of Red Martial Hall, was their heir, how could she take charge of Sword Pavilion?Jian Wushuang did not take it seriously at first, thinking that the man was just kidding. But he heard further news after he took just a few steps.\u201cI heard that too. Jian Lan, the head of Red Martial Hall, together with the alchemists of Pill Refining Room, went to the Mansion Master and requested that he approve Jian Meng\u2019er to take charge of the Sword Pavilion. This was strongly opposed by Sword Pavilion. However, they have had little influence since Jian Nantian, the Sword Pavilion Master, disappeared. Their opposition was overruled. Finally, the Mansion Master, although reluctant, promised to have Jian Meng\u2019er take charge of Sword Pavilion as long as she was qualified to be the Sword Pavilion Master.\u201d\u201cWhat standards needed to be satisfied to become the Sword Pavilion Master? \u201d\u201cIn Sword Marquis Mansion, the Sword Pavilion Master is only inferior to the Mansion Master. They have a high status, which is difficult to reach. Therefore, Sword Pavilion has always insisted on a set of minimum requirements for its Master. To be the Sword Pavilion Master, the very first requirement is to gain extremely high attainments in Sword Principles and be proficient in all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion.\u201d\u201cFirst-class Sword Arts? All eighteen of them? \u201dThere were only exclamations that remained.In Sword Marquis Mansion, normal disciples only had access to Third-class or Second-class Sword Arts, while First-class Sword Arts were available for those talented disciples who were core members or elite members. Today in the Sword Pavilion, there were less than 10 disciples who were qualified to learn First-class Sword Arts, and even if possible, they could only learn one or two First-class Sword Arts at most.As for the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts, even a core disciple of Sword Pavilion was not eligible to learn all of them, let alone a disciple of Red Martial Hall.\u201cIt is totally impossible for Jian Meng\u2019er to satisfy this standard, \u201d someone said confidently.\u201cNot exactly, Jian Meng\u2019er did it. Today, under the watchful eyes of the Mansion Master and Sword Pavilion Elders, she carried out all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts, with an incredible display of proficiency at the Profound level.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? \u201d\u201cHow could it be possible? \u201d\u201cHow did she learn these Sword Arts? \u201dEveryone present was shocked.Jian Wushuang, however, standing there the entire time, was dumbfounded.Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion?Was he not the person who had taught Jian Meng\u2019er those techniques?Four years ago, it was Jian Meng\u2019er who helped him get out of his dilemma when his father was missing and he could not condense Spiritual Power, which was a huge blow to him. Having been grateful to her, he stayed with Jian Meng\u2019er almost every day. She was endowed with great talent in Sword Principle and was keen on sword-wielding. However, there were no advanced Sword Arts in Red Martial Hall.Seeing this, Jian Wushuang, an innocent kid then, at 12 or 13, started to teach Jian Meng\u2019er swordsmanship. Later, he even taught her Sword Arts from Sword Pavilion.Four years have passed. In these four years, he taught each of the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts to Jian Meng\u2019er.But today, due to his teaching, she could dream of taking charge of Sword Pavilion?To take charge of the Sword Pavilion was the greatest wish of his whole life!\u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible. Meng\u2019er would never do that.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought, shaking his head, reluctant to believe it.\u201cTo take charge of Sword Pavilion, required tremendous quality and strength, besides proficiency in all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts, which was compulsory. The minimum strength requirement for a Sword Pavilion Master was the ability to battle with each of the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion for at least 20 movements, which Jian Meng\u2019er did successfully. \u201d\u201cHow could it be possible? \u201d\u201cI am well aware of the strength of the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion, who have already reached Spiritual Sea Realm long ago. It is said that Elder Hong, the strongest among them, has reached the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, just one step away from the Gold Core Realm. How could Jian Meng\u2019er ever be able to get through 20 movements? \u201d\u201cWe have looked down upon her all this time. She has always been quiet in the Marquis\u2019s mansion and seldom showed her strength, but today, during her battles with the four Sword Pavilion Elders, everyone present was totally shocked by her strength. It was at the Spiritual Sea Realm. More than that, she is at the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. With one more level, she would be at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. \u201d\u201cJian Meng\u2019er? How could she step into the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for such a young, 16-year-old girl. \u201dNot only were those disciples who were having the discussion too astonished to utter a word, but Jian Wushuang was also totally dumbstruck.\u201cMeng\u2019er, she\u2026 Reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm?\u201d Jian Wushuang thought with disbelief.Although he had been with Jian Meng\u2019er every day for four years, she had never shown her strength. Jian Wushuang did not think much about that, thinking that Jian Meng\u2019er was the same as other disciples in Marquis\u2019s mansion, who were at the Fifth or Sixth Step of the Spirit Path at most. He never imagined she could reach Spiritual Sea Realm, let alone the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cHow could a girl as young as 16 years old step into the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? \u201dIt had never happened in Sword Marquis Mansion over the last hundreds of years.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er, such a genius with super talent has never appeared before in the hundreds of years of history of the Sword Marquis Mansion. She is so good at the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion that she has survived 20 movements of the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion. As a result, Mansion Master gave his instant consent to Jian Meng\u2019er that she could take charge of Sword Pavilion, making her the Sword Pavilion Master. \u201d\u201cIn two months, there will be an annual Sword Marquis Token Battle in Sword Pavilion Mansion, which is when Jian Meng\u2019er can prove her astounding strength in the presence of the strong experts in Bashui Commandery. Then, with everyone bearing witness, she will be awarded the title of Sword Pavilion Master. \u201d\u201cAmazing! \u201d\u201cIt is really amazing that a 16-year-old girl has reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. \u201dIt won everyone\u2019s exclamations except for Jian Wushuang, who was standing by the side and turned pale at this news.\u201cDid Meng\u2019er really reach the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? Will she really take charge as the Sword Pavilion Master in two months?\u201d\u201cNo! No way! I can\u2019t believe that!\u201dClenching his fists, Jian Wushuang rushed to the courtyard of her residence as if he had gone mad. His heart was a mess.It can\u2019t be true. He could not believe it was true.It was known to all that Sword Pavilion belonged to their disciples, and since his father was the Sword Pavilion Master, he was the only heir!He remembered that his father had told him that only disciples from Sword Pavilion could take charge of it.And that was his life-long dream.So how could he let others steal and destroy his dream?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was only Jian Lan, wearing a black robe. He stood with his hands behind his back and waited for him quietly.Jian Wushuang had a bad feeling.\u201cUncle Lan, \u201d Jian Wushuang called him as usual.\u201cYou\u2019re here? \u201d Jian Lan turned. His usual mild face had changed completely into a cold and distant one. \u201cYou must have heard everything. Today the Mansion Master appointed Meng\u2019er as the new Sword Pavilion Master. After the Sword Marquis Token Battle, a succession ceremony will be hosted. By the way, the token representing the status of Sword Pavilion Master is currently with you.\u201dJian Wushuang was shocked.The token representing the Sword Pavilion Master was the most powerful sword in Sword Marquis Mansion, Triple-kill Sword!It had been brought back by a man, trusted by his father, not long after he disappeared. In the last four years, the sword had always been kept by him. It was the Long Sword on his back.\u201cHand it over! \u201d Jian Lan said.Both Jian Wushuang\u2019s body and heart shook. Looking at Jian Lan, he ground his teeth in rage and said in a low voice, \u201cI want to see Meng\u2019er! \u201d\u201cMeng\u2019er, what status does she have? You think you can meet with whomever you wish? \u201d Jian Lan said with a sneer.\u201cUnless I see her, I will not hand it over, \u201d Jian Wushuang said defiantly.Even at this moment, he still had some hope deep in his heart that all this had been Jian Lan\u2019s idea and that Jian Meng\u2019er was being forced into it\u2026\u201cHow dare you! \u201d Jian Lan shouted. He was getting angry.\u201cFather. \u201d A beautiful girl dressed in white came out of the house slowly, Jian Meng\u2019er.\u201cMeng\u2019er. \u201d Jian Wushuang turned eagerly toward her. That one glance destroyed his last hope. He noticed that Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s eyes were cold and ruthless.Jian Wushuang suddenly realized that Jian Meng\u2019er had not been forced.\u201cYou\u2019ve been lying to me? \u201d Jian Wushuang asked, staring at her.\u201cLying to you? No.\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er shook her head, \u201cI never promised you anything. Even though you taught me swordsmanship as I asked, I never forced you. It was a deal. You instructed me and I accompanied you for four years. It\u2019s fair! \u201d\u201cOnly a deal? \u201d Jian Wushuang asked again with a wan smile. \u201cYou should know that the Triple-kill Sword was sent back by a man trusted by my father. It may be the only clue to find him! \u201d\u201cI know. \u201d Jian Meng\u2019er nodded.\u201cYou also know that my greatest wish in life is to succeed my father and take charge of Sword Pavilion with the Triple-kill Sword in hand one day, don\u2019t you? \u201d Jian Wushuang continued to ask.\u201cYes. \u201d Jian Meng\u2019er nodded again, \u201cHowever, it is just a dream for you. It will never be realized. After all, you are trash who is incapable of cultivating Spiritual Power. \u201d\u201cTrash? \u201d Jian Wushuang couldn\u2019t stop laughing at himself.It was just early this very morning, that he had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill and finally condensed some Spiritual Power. He had become a real Warrior now. He could hardly wait to share this with her. Who would have thought she had been thinking he was trash the entire time? A pitiful person who couldn\u2019t cultivate Spiritual Power?\u201cJian Wushuang, things have happened. There is no need to haggle over this endlessly. It will only make you appear weaker. If you are not reconciled with what you have suffered, you can challenge me fairly. In this world, strength gives you power and rights. People take advantage of you when you are weak. Who can you blame for that? \u201d Jian Meng\u2019er said with indifference.\u201cSo that\u2019s it? Because I\u2019m too weak? \u201d Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. However, the smile on his face was a sad one, \u201cSo, I have always been a fool! \u201d\u201cHa-ha, stupid! I am so stupid! \u201d\u201cI am the biggest fool in the world! \u201d\u201cI am an idiot! \u201dJian Wushuang roared as if he was insane.Jian Lan and Jian Meng\u2019er stood nearby and looked at him quietly without any mercy in their eyes.What she had said was the brutal truth.In this world, people survived according to the law of the jungle.Jian Wushuang laughed sadly. But in the meantime, his brain seemed to have been struck by thousands of thunderbolts simultaneously. His face was twisted and his eyes were complicated, first disbelief, then shock, and at last anger, almost to the point of insanity.Several seconds later, Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped laughing. When he looked up again, his eyes had returned to calmness.Both Jian Lan and Jian Meng\u2019er noticed his transformation. They were quite astonished.However, they didn\u2019t notice the radical change Jian Wushuang had gone through in his inner heart in such a short time.The originally innocent and simple-minded Jian Wushuang was gone. Instead, the man who remained seemed to have experienced decades of vicissitudes in life.After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang looked back at Jian Meng\u2019er. The look was marrow-freezing and not at all tender. Jian Meng\u2019er couldn\u2019t help feeling a chill under his intense gaze.These eyes, how cold they were!Like a venomous snake eyeing its prey.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er, you\u2019re right. Only the weak pray for pity. Experts prove themselves with strength. So\u2026 \u201d Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice. He pulled the Triple-kill Sword from his back, raising it.SHUA!The sharp sword edge scratched a bleeding wound on Jian Wushuang\u2019s palm\u2026 A burning pain shot through his hand while he clenched his bloody fist. Painful as it was, he gazed at Jian Meng\u2019er and said,\u201cIn two months, during the Sword Marquis Token Battle, the day when you will succeed the position of Sword Pavilion Master in public, I will challenge you! \u201d\u201cI swear I will make you all know that the Sword Pavilion\u2026 forever belongs to Sword Pavilion. It belongs to my father, belongs to me. It is impossible for anyone else to have a hand in it! \u201d\u201cI will kill everyone who attempts to encroach! \u201dBlood flowed along his arm slowly and dripped on the ground. His words sounded sonorous and forceful.\u201cAs for the Triple-kill Sword? Humph\u2026 \u201d Looking at the sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang sneered and said, \u201cYou want it? Here you are! \u201dJian Wushuang threw Triple-kill Sword towards Jian Meng\u2019er, then he turned and went straight outside. At the very moment, before he left the courtyard, Jian Wushuang stopped and said coldly,\u201cI will see you in two months! \u201dWearing a slight frown and looking at Jian Wushuang\u2019s departure and lonely back in blank amazement, Jian Meng\u2019er suddenly felt that the Triple-kill Sword in her hand was extremely heavy\u2026\u201cHumph! Trash who can\u2019t even condense Spiritual Power wants to challenge you in two months. He must be kidding. It would be better for him to become a real Warrior within two months. \u201d Standing nearby Jian Lan laughed in disdain.Hearing this, Jian Meng\u2019er relaxed her furrowed brows.That\u2019s right! He is still trash who can\u2019t condense Spiritual Power. How dare he fight with me in two months?It is an absolute joke!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He thought of these four years he had spent with her. Their time together had created wonderful memories for him, but now all these memories had become sharp thorns that caused him extreme pain.\u201cWeak!\u201d\u201cYes, she\u2019s right. Ultimately, my strength is too weak!\u201d\u201cIf I was stronger and more powerful than Jian Meng\u2019er, then she would never dare to say words like that in front of me. With that strength, there is no hope for her in taking charge of Sword Pavilion!\u201d\u201cStrength \u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were cold.No one knew what a radical mental change he had gone through in just one day.\u201cNo outsider can ever lay a finger on Sword Pavilion even for one day!\u201d\u201cIn two months, I must defeat Jian Meng\u2019er in a fair way before she officially succeeds to the position of Sword Pavilion Master!\u201d\u201cTwo months!\u201d He clenched his fists tightly.Maybe for others, it was impossible to cultivate from condensing Spiritual Power to Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019 s level, the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, but Jian Wushuang was different.After all, he had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, a Heaven defying Martial Art.And since it was a Heaven defying cultivation method, he should be able to cultivate in defiance of the natural order!\u2026Sword Marquis Mansion was located within Bashui Prefecture, Tianyan Province of Tianzong Dynasty. It was one of the main powers within Bashui Prefecture, and it focused exclusively on Sword Principle.There were two factions in Sword Marquis Mansion, Sword Pavilion and Red Martial Hall.These two factions had fought both overtly and covertly, but Sword Pavilion had always prevailed. However, when Jian Nantian, the Sword Pavilion Master, disappeared four years ago, Sword Pavilion lost its backbone. Its overall strength suffered a disastrous decline, and so did its right of speech. The Sword Pavilion was at an absolute disadvantage in the fight with Red Martial Hall. It was yesterday that the position of Sword Pavilion Master had been taken away by Jian Meng\u2019er from Red Martial Hall.\u201cThe Sword Pavilion\u2026\u201dDressed in white and with a common Long Sword on his back, Jian Wushuang walked up to the door of the Sword Pavilion. Looking at the two words SWORD PAVILION at the top, his mood was extremely complex.He hesitated for a moment and then stepped into the Sword Pavilion.When Jian Wushuang appeared in the Sword Pavilion, many disciples who had been practicing swordsmanship could not help looking at him.\u201cIs that \u2026 Jian Wushang?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s him! He is a traitor. He taught many First-class Sword Arts from our Sword Pavilion to a person from the Red Martial Hall. How dare he come here!?\u201d\u201cAlas! We cannot blame him. After all, he was cheated. And if Jian Meng\u2019er takes charge of Sword Pavilion, he will suffer the most. Please stop talking like that! He is in pain.\u201dThere was a lot of whispering in the Sword Pavilion. Most of the eyes upon him were full of mercy.The news that Jian Meng\u2019er would take charge of Sword Pavilion had spread all over the Sword Marquis Mansion, so the news that she had mastered all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion to Profound level naturally had run through here.Generally speaking, these First-class Sword Arts could not be taught to outsiders. Even core disciples could only cultivate one or two. So how had Jian Meng\u2019er mastered all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts at the same time?The answer was obvious. Jian Wushuang had taught her.In the whole Sword Pavilion, only Jian Wushuang knew all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts. Because of his father\u2019s position, he had learned swordsmanship from childhood and his father had taught him these eighteen techniques.The Sword Pavilion was full of murmuring and comments, but Jian Wushuang did not stop. He walked directly into the inner hall with an indifferent expression.Inside the hall, a gray-haired elder in a grey robe was looking through a thread-bound book, but when he saw Jian Wushuang coming in, he stopped, surprised.\u201cYoung\u2026 Young Pavillion Master?\u201d The gray-robed elder said in a constrained voice.\u201cElder Hong.\u201d Jian Wushuang said humbly. His eyes were full of guilt.For years, the Sword Pavilion Elders had exerted their utmost efforts for the Sword Pavilion. However, due to his stupidity, the position of Sword Pavilion Master had changed hands and was being taken charge of by a person from the Red Martial Hall. So Jian Wushuang felt guilty.\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. You are too young and don\u2019t understand these schemes. We, the Sword Pavilion Elders, are not going to blame you.\u201d Elder Hong saw the guilty look in Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes and shook his head with a smile.\u201cIf someone should be blamed, it should be Jian Lan and Jian Meng\u2019er. Their means were too dishonorable. Especially that Jian Meng\u2019er, I have met her several times. But I had never thought that she could hide her schemes so deeply. With such a mind at a young age, her future achievements will be great. It is not too bad that the Sword Pavilion has fallen into her hands.\u201cSword Pavilion. Only disciples from the Sword Pavilion can take charge of it.\u201d Jian Wushuang said firmly.Elder Hong was startled for a moment, and then he could only shake his head helplessly.In the bottom of his heart, he was extremely reluctant to let Jian Meng\u2019er take charge of Sword Pavilion, but now these things had happened. What could he do? He could only comfort himself.\u201cElder Hong, I want to go inside the Human-level Cultivation Room,\u201d Jian Wushuang said suddenly in a serious tone.\u201cThe Human-level Cultivation Room?\u201d Elder Hong was shocked.The Human-level Cultivation Room was an exclusive secret chamber for cultivation in the Sword Pavilion.Besides the Human-level Cultivation Room, there were the Earth-level Cultivating Room and the Heaven-level Cultivating Room. These three cultivation rooms could help to promote cultivation, but they also had some disadvantages. Few disciples came here to cultivate in them regularly.However, Jian Wushuang had not even condensed any Spiritual Power. What could he do in the Human-level Cultivation Room?Although Elder Hong was puzzled, he nodded his head and said, \u201cCome with me\u201d.Soon, Elder Hong led Jian Wushuang to a secret chamber.\u201cYoung Pavillion Master, you came to this Cultivation Room for cultivation four years ago, and you are familiar with the environment inside. Don\u2019t force yourself. If you cannot carry on, you should come out as soon as possible.\u201d Elder Hong warned him patiently.\u201cI know.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded and then stepped into the secret chamber.There was no decoration in this simple secret chamber. When Jian Wushuang entered the secret chamber, he felt a terrible force rushing toward him and oppressing him. He felt like he was mired down in mud, and it was very difficult to make any gestures or movements.This force was the unique pressure of the Human-level Cultivation Room. It was tyrannical. Under this force, every movement in the secret chamber became extremely difficult. Even if a person wanted to stand, he had to rely on Spiritual Power to resist it. In this way, the speed of Spiritual Power consumption would be quite alarming.In general, if a common warrior in the First Step of the Spirit Path merely stood in the Human-level Cultivation Room, his Spiritual Power would run out in no more than 8 minutes. If he practiced swordsmanship in this room, the speed of Spiritual Power consumption would be incredible.\u201cLet me start.\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s face held no expression, and the Long Sword on his back was unsheathed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: Jian LinTranslator: Transn Editor: TransnCLANG!The sword light flashed around with unpredictable changes in speed. The light would dim and brighten at random moments. Sometimes the whole energy was focused on one point, while sometimes it was separated in every ray of the sword light. This was one of the Sword Marquis Mansion\u2019s First-class Sword Arts, it was called Bright Moon Sword Art.In the Human-level Cultivation Room, Jian Wushuang began to practice swordsmanship, but under the effect of its tyrannical gravity, the Spiritual Power within his body was consumed at an unbelievable speed.In a mere moment, before he even practiced the whole Bright Moon Sword Art. He found his Spiritual Power had already drained out.Without hesitation, Jian Wushaung promptly sheathed his Long Sword and trudged to a corner at the right side of this secret chamber. There existed a yellowish cattail hassock. It was made for people to regain their Spiritual Power with no interruption from the unique gravity.Sitting on the cattail hassock, Jian Wushuang started to use Heavenly Creation Skill, and a flow of Spiritual Power came to him from all directions, aggregating in his Dantian through his eight-extra meridians at a ridiculous speed.After 10 minutes, Jian Wushuang stood up again. His overall Spiritual Power had reached the Peak, even stronger than before.\u201cJust as I thought, the speed of the Heavenly Creation Skill to absorb the Spiritual Power of Heaven and Earth is far faster than that of ordinary cultivation means, certainly, the speed of regaining Spiritual Power is quick. That\u2019s true, because when the Spiritual Power is used up, a common warrior cannot reach the Peak unless he spends several hours recovering. I only need 10 minutes\u2026\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s eyes sparkled with joy.This was another impressive strength of Heavenly Creation Skill compared with other means.The speed of cultivation was fast, as was the speed of restoring Spiritual Power.And this recovery speed in the Human-level Cultivation Room was almost the same as a\u00a0cheating device during cultivation.It should be known that the process of exhausting Spiritual Power and then fully recovering it was very helpful to cultivation. Performing a complete cycle would allow even an ordinary Warrior to improve his Spiritual Power considerably each time he did this. Jian Wushuang cultivated a Heaven defying cultivation method. Therefore, his improvement in Spiritual Power would be higher.As soon as he recovered to the peak, he immediately noticed that his Spiritual Power had improved a lot.This was the advantage of cultivating in the Human-level Cultivation Room.For ordinary Warriors, their speed of regaining Spiritual Power was too slow, so it was not effective for them to complete any more than two cycles a day at most.Besides\u2026 It was depressing and intolerable to cultivate in this room. Normally, very few disciples would choose to cultivate here. Occasionally, some disciples who couldn\u2019t break through a bottleneck would come here, and try to forcibly break through using the gravity in this room.Just as Jian Wushuang had cultivated in this Human-level Cultivation Room once four years ago when he couldn\u2019t gather his Spiritual Power.\u201cThe Heavenly Creation Skill that I cultivate makes my speed of regaining spiritual power unimaginable. Others can only finish the cultivation cycle twice a day, while I can finish twenty times a day at least. That means that my cultivation will be at least ten times the speed of ordinary warriors.\u201dHeavenly Creation Skill\u2019s cultivation speed was fast enough. Besides, with the help of the Human-level Cultivation Room, his cultivation speed would be so fast that he could enter the Second Heaven of the Divine Path within one or two days.\u201cI took four years longer than others to become a Warrior, so I must work harder than common people so that I won\u2019t be left behind anymore.\u201d A keen light burst out from Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes.From then on, he became fully immersed in cultivating in the Human-level Cultivation Room.The cultivation cycle began with him completely exhausting the Spiritual Power and ended after recovering it to its peak. Each cycle helped him improve his Spiritual Power further. What\u2019s more, he could finish dozens of cultivation cycles almost every day.The cultivation speed was also ten times faster than ordinary Warriors, possibly even more.Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.In front of the gate of Sword Pavilion.BANG!With the sound of a deep crash, a Sword Pavilion disciple was relentlessly thrown into the sky. He fell heavily to the ground.\u201cHaha, Sword Pavilion disciples are so weak.\u201dThe laughter came from a purple-robed youth. He was obviously not a disciple from Sword Pavilion, yet he stood domineeringly in front of the gate of Sword Pavilion. Hearing his words, many disciples around him were resentful but couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201cThere is nothing great about reaching the Sixth Step earlier than me and having stronger Spiritual Power than me!\u201d The defeated disciple stood up and spoke indignantly.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that you have been defeated, you still don\u2019t want to accept it? Are disciples from Sword Pavilion all like you?\u201d The youth completely ignored the homicidal stare with a sneer.\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned his gaze, seeing Jian Wushuang walking towards Sword Pavilion, and then gave him a wicked smile.As usual, Jian Wushuang had come to cultivate in Sword Pavilion. However, as he came to the door of Sword Pavilion.\u201cIs that the Young Pavillion Master, Jian Wushuang?\u201d A mocking voice came all of a sudden.Jian Wushuang stopped and saw the purple-robed youth with slightly closed eyes.He had a slight impression of this youth. He knew his name was Jian Lin, and that he was an excellent disciple of Red Martial Hall. More importantly, he knew Jian Lin had a crush on Jian Meng\u2019er and tried to please her all the time.But unfortunately, Jian Meng\u2019er had been with Jian Wushuang for four years so as to study the eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion. This made Jian Lin hate Jian Wushuang very much out of jealousy.Jian Lin had never had a chance to fight with Jian Wushuang on account of Jian Lan and Jian Meng\u2019er.\u201cWith a sword in hand, no one is his match. The name is good, but you don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Jian Lin sneered at Jian Wushuang without any scruple. \u201cBesides, you even want to gain Meng\u2019er\u2019s love. It\u2019s like a toad trying to eat swan meat. You should look at yourself. Why would Meng\u2019er love trash who can\u2019t even cultivate Spiritual Power?\u201dJian Wushuang glanced at Jian Lin. Instead of getting angry, he laughed ironically and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, people like me don\u2019t deserve Jian Meng\u2019er. I\u2019ll give her to you!\u201d\u201cGive her to me?\u201d Jian Lin was puzzled at first, and then became rampant, \u201cDamn it, you think I need trash like you to give her to me?\u201dJian Wushuang laughed coldly. Without another word he walked back toward Sword Pavilion.\u201cTrash, stop right there.\u201d Jian Lin roared.Jian Wushuang ignored him and continued walking.\u201cBastard, how dare you ignore me?\u201d Jian Lin scolded. His face was distorted. He moved his body and a palm struck toward Jian Wushuang\u2019s back.Noticing the wind behind his back, Jian Wushuang suddenly turned back with cold eyes. His right hand punched out powerfully and vigorously as Spiritual Power instantly burst out from him.\u201cGet out of my way!\u201dAs Jian Wushuang roared, the voice lashed out along with the strength of his arm. Jian Wushuang\u2019s fist crashed into Jian Lin\u2019s palm.BANG!Jian Wushuang stumbled back a few steps, while Jian Lin was also forced to take a step back.Though he was pushed only one step back, Jian Lin was completely shocked.\u201cHow come?\u201d Jian Lin glared at Jian Wushuang with bulging eyes.He hadn\u2019t dared to hit too hard, so the palm hadn\u2019t contained too much power. But even so, an ordinary person wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it easily, while Jian Wushuang had even forced him to retreat.\u201cThe Third Step! He\u2019s reached at least the Third Step of the Spirit Path, or even the peak of the Third Step!\u201d Jian Lin said with horror.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They all saw what happened and felt confused.\u201cHe forced Jian Lin back? How could this be?\u201dPeak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Jian Lin is at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Even though he didn\u2019t use all his strength, no ordinary person could take it. Not to mention Jian Lin was forced back!\u201d\u201cThe Third Step, his cultivation is at the Third Step of the Spirit Path!\u201d\u201cHas Jian Wushuang gathered Spiritual Power and become a Warrior? Is his cultivation at the Third Step of the Spirit Path?\u201dIt was shocking. All the Sword Pavilion disciples were amazed.Just ten days ago, Jian Wushuang had not gathered any Spiritual Power. But now, after only ten days had passed, he had not only gathered Spiritual Power, but also cultivated to the Third Step of the Spirit Path.In ten days, he had gone from becoming a Warrior to reaching the Third Step of the Spirit Path after continuous breakthroughs?What did that mean?They did not know that Jian Wushuang cultivated Heavenly Creation Skill and couldn\u2019t be thought of as an ordinary person.He had a Heaven defying Cultivation Method!Ten days ago, although he had just gathered the spiritual power, his cultivation speed with Heavenly Creation Skill was faster than ordinary people. What\u2019s more, he had done frantic and desperate cultivation in the Human-level Cultivation Room, where one day\u2019s cultivation for Jian Wushuang was worth dozens of days of cultivation for ordinary people. After ten days, he had had a direct breakthrough from the First Heaven of the Divine Path to the Third Heaven of the Divine Path!Of course, he had just had the breakthrough and only reached the Third Heaven. The reason Jian Lin thought he had reached the Peak of the Third Step of Spirit Path was that he cultivated Heavenly Creation Skill. So his strength was significantly more than other Warriors at the same level.\u201cKid, I admit that I underestimated you. I did not expect that you could gather Spiritual Power. But it doesn\u2019t matter with only the Third Step of the Spirit Path. In front of me, you are still trash,\u201d Jian Lin stared at Jian Wushuang. The Spiritual Power welling up from his palms showed that he was going all out.Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. No matter what he could not withstand an attack from someone who cultivated to the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path now.At this moment\u2026\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d There was a low growl, then Elder Hong in his gray robe came out from Sword Pavilion.\u201cElder Hong.\u201d Several Sword Pavilion disciples respectfully saluted at once.Seeing the elder, Jian Lin immediately stopped and changed his look. The formidable Spiritual Power welling up from him was drawn back. At the same time, he saluted, \u201cElder Hong.\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d Elder Hong glanced at Jian Lin, and snorted, \u201cYou are Jian Lin, huh? With cultivation at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path, you are pretty good among disciples at the same level. Relying on a slightly deeper cultivation, you are showing off your strength in front of the Sword Pavilion. Do you really think there is no one who can deal with you in Sword Pavilion?\u201d\u201cI dare not,\u201d Jian Lin quickly shook his head, with cold sweat falling down instantly.He pretty much knew that, even if the position of Sword Pavilion had declined markedly in the Sword Marquis Mansion, the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion, all of whom were at the Spiritual Sea Realm, were the backbone of the Mansion. Especially Elder Hong, his strength was absolutely in the top three in the current Sword Marquis Mansion. Facing such a strong man, even though he was conceited, he dared not be rude.\u201cGet out of here now,\u201d Elder Hong scolded.\u201cOK,\u201d Jian Lin replied immediately. But as he was leaving, he glanced at Jian Wushuang and said with a sneer, \u201cJian Wushuang, I heard that you went to find Meng\u2019er the day she was appointed as the new Sword Pavilion Master, and boldly threw down a personal challenge for the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle in two months?\u201dAll those around were puzzled at first. This was the first time they were hearing this. They looked at Jian Wushuang.Two months later, Jian Wushuang would challenge Jian Meng\u2019er?Was this a joke?\u201cThere are many folks in this world who are foolish and arrogant. But I have never met such a foolish and arrogant person as you. With just the Third Step of the Spirit Path, you are actually thinking of defeating Meng\u2019er who is in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? Haha, my laughter is killing me!\u201d Jian Lin left. But his unscrupulous laughter echoed in front of the Sword Pavilion.Jian Wushuang just stood there, with an apathetic expression. Many people gazed at him with regret in their eyes. Some eyes were even filled with ridicule and disdain, just like Jian Lin\u2019s.Even Elder Hong was looking at Jian Wushuang with a quiet complex expression.In two months he is challenging Jian Meng\u2019er?Was Jian Wushuang going to rely on his cultivation at the Third Step of the Spirit Path?All the Sword Pavilion disciples thought that was just wishful thinking for Jian Wushuang.After Jian Lin left, Elder Hong winked at Jian Wushuang. Immediately they went inside the hall of Sword Pavilion.\u201cYoung Pavillion Master, congratulations. You have finally become a real Warrior after four years\u2019 endeavor,\u201d Elder Hong smiled. He had seen everything that had occurred outside the Sword Pavilion just now and had surely seen Jian Lin get knocked back by Jian Wushuang.\u201cAh, but it is not enough just to be a Warrior,\u201d Jian Wushuang said in a downcast voice.Elder Hong looked at Jian Wushuang seriously and asked, \u201cYoung Pavillion Master, do you really want to fight with Jian Meng\u2019er at the Sword Marquis Token Battle?\u201d\u201cYes, this competition is inevitable,\u201d Jian Wushuang said firmly.Elder Hong thought it was impossible. \u201cYoung Master of the Pavilion, you should know that during a warrior\u2019s cultivation, the breakthrough of each level is much harder. It will also take a very long time. Only two months\u2026 As far as I know, in the whole Sword Marquis Mansion, the only one who ever made such great progress in two months was the Pavilion Master, your father!\u201cWhen the Pavilion Master was young, in two months he reached the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path from the Second Step of the Spirit Path. He had a direct breakthrough of four Levels, which greatly defied the natural order. The reason the Pavilion Master had such a breakthrough was that, first of all, he had a great gift for cultivation, together with the support of a large number of pills from the Sword Marquis Mansion. The most important thing was that the Pavilion Master spent those two months in the Gladiator Arena and participated in combat with opponents almost every day. Only because of struggling with life and death in the arena, could he progress so fast!\u201cHowever, the Pavilion Master only had a breakthrough from the Second Step of the Spirit Path to the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path,\u201d Elder Hong stared at Jian Wushuang.But that could not sway him from his decision, not even a little.Of course, he understood what Elder Hong said. It had taken his father two months to break through the Second Step of the Spirit Path and reach the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path, which was incredible. However, what he was going to do was much harder.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er is already at the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. I need to reach at least the level of the Seventh Heaven of the Divine Path. Then by virtue of Heavenly Creation Skill and my swordsmanship, as well as the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, it is possible for me to defeat her! \u201d\u201cAnd from the Third Heaven of the Divine Path to the Seventh Heaven of the Divine Path, it is same in that they both need to break through four Levels. But it is at least ten times harder than that from the Second Step of the Spirit Path to the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I am a Defiant Cultivator. Every step I take will be out of the ordinary and in defiance of the natural order!\u201d\u201cOther people cannot do it. But for me, it is possible!\u201dJian Wushuang had made up his mind. His eyes became more determined.Seeing this, Elder Hong asked, \u201cDo you really want to try?\u201d\u201cOf course. But I will not just try, I will defeat her in two months.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were grim.In that case, I will not say anything more. But I have something that may be able to help you.\u201d Elder Hong took out a jade box from his bosom and then opened it. Inside the jade box were two milk-white pills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fragrance is too strong. It can\u2019t be an ordinary pill. Could it be a first-class pill?\u201dSpirit-cultivating pills were taken exclusively by warriors in the Spirit Path Realm. It would greatly aid the cultivation of warriors of that level.However, there were two kinds of Spirit-cultivating pills. The first-class pills were 10 times rarer and more effective than ordinary pills. Furthermore, it had nearly no impurities, so a warrior could use it without any worries.A First-class Spirit-cultivating pill was a precious treasure!Not even hundreds of ordinary pills could match up to a first-class pill in market value.There were many alchemists in the Pill Refining Room of the Sword Marquis Mansion, but none managed to produce a first-class pill. That was why there were none in the mansion. If there was truly a need for it, the mansion could only purchase it from the Gladiator Arena.Jian Wushuang didn\u2019t expect Elder Hong to have one First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill, let alone a whopping two.\u201cI paid a considerable price to buy these two First-class Spirit-Cultivating pills from the Gladiator Arena. I was planning on finding a good disciple and giving him these pills. I didn\u2019t think the Sword Pavilion would be hit by such a big crisis before I could even find one. So I\u2019ll hand these two pills to you, Young Master. I hope they\u2019ll be useful to you,\u201d Elder Hong said, smiling.\u201cElder Hong\u2026\u201dJian Wushuang looked at Elder Hong but didn\u2019t stretch out his hands to accept the pills.\u201cA First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill is extremely potent. A warrior in the Spirit Path Realm typically needs a month to absorb the pill completely, and now you have two. That\u2019s enough time for you to fully absorb these two pills. I believe it\u2019ll greatly help your cultivation. Just take them,\u201d Elder Hong said.\u201cThank you so much!\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded, accepting the jade box without putting up a show of pretense. \u201cElder Hong, rest assured the Sword Pavilion won\u2019t collapse while I\u2019m still alive!\u201d\u201cIn two months, I\u2019ll properly defeat Jian Meng\u2019er of the Red Martial Hall before everyone in the Sword Marquis Token Battle!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let everyone know that the only one who could be the Sword Pavilion Master is a disciple of the Sword Pavilion!\u201dWhen he was done talking, Jian Wushuang turned and stepped into a Cultivating Room once again. Only this time he entered the Earth-Level Cultivating Room, one of the three big Cultivating Rooms in the Sword Pavilion.Elder Hong remained rooted on the ground, watching as Jian Wushuang walked into the Cultivating Room. A trace of a smile gradually appeared on his face.\u201cYoung Master\u2019s temperament is really similar to the Master\u2019s.\u201d\u201cStubborn. Yes! Pavilion Master was just as stubborn!\u201d\u201cBut to defeat Jian Meng\u2019er in just two months\u2026 that\u2019s not just difficult but nearly impossible.\u201d Elder Hong shook his head. On the same day Jian Meng\u2019er was appointed as the Sword Pavilion Master, he personally had a fight with her. He realized she had unusual strength despite her young age.Having reached the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm long ago, it would be nearly impossible for a warrior with the usual Profound Spiritual Sea Realm to continue a fight against him for 20 movements. Yet Jian Meng\u2019er succeeded.\u201cI really hope our Young Master will manage a miracle in two months. It\u2019s a joyful occasion that he has condensed Spiritual Power to be a warrior. I need to let that person in the Golden Dragon Palace know.\u201d\u2026The enormous pressure of the Earth-Level Cultivating Room was far greater than that of the Human-Level Cultivation Room.Inside the room, the Spiritual Power within Jian Wushuang\u2019s body was consumed even more quickly. Yet he continued practicing his ethereal and fluid swordsmanship with his shadow mirroring his actions. The swordsmanship he used was the Blue Cloud Sword Art, one of many top mysterious arts from the Sword Pavilion.Jian Meng\u2019er had once performed all the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion at the Profound level, causing everyone in Sword Marquis Mansion to marvel at her talent in Sword Principles. They were so busy admiring her that they had forgotten that it was he, Jian Wushuang, who imparted each of those sword arts to her. He was the true genius of Sword Principles.Now, Jian Meng\u2019er was recognized as the number one Sword Principle talent by the whole Sword Marquis Mansion.But even she understood clearly that he was countless times more gifted in Sword Principles than she was.Take the Blue Cloud Sword Art for example. He had truly pushed it to great heights, whereas her performance was just like a little kid\u2019s trick\u2026His swordsmanship practice sped up the consumption of his Spiritual Power, but he was prepared and had already swallowed a First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill earlier.The elixir was incredibly potent. After taking one, the typical warrior would need a month or more to absorb its effects completely. Jian Wushuang, with the help of Heavenly Creation Skill, already felt the pill flowing quickly throughout his body.In just a night, he had completely absorbed the benefits of the First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill.That allowed him to make a direct breakthrough to the Fourth Heaven of the Divine Path.\u201cThe Fourth Heaven of the Divine Path.\u201d Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, feeling the booming power within him.He had just broken through the Third Heaven of the Divine Path yesterday and made another breakthrough today. It was thanks to the potency of the First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill as well as the wonders of the Heavenly Creation Skill.The pill that others needed a month or longer to absorb, he had absorbed within the span of one night.\u201cThe Heavenly Creation Skill is really magical!\u201d\u201cWith the Heavenly Creation Skill, I actually needed just a day to absorb the great effects of the First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill. If I have more, then\u2026\u201d His eyes gleamed red as he thought about this.\u201cI want those First-class Spirit-Cultivating pills!\u201d\u201cThe more, the better!\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s heart was burning with these thoughts.The First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill, capable of being absorbed in a short time, greatly improved his cultivation. Of course, he thirsted for more.What a pity that those pills weren\u2019t so easy to obtain.\u201cNot even the Sword Marquis Mansion is capable of producing these pills. Perhaps only the Gladiator Arena is capable of mass-producing them in Bashui Prefecture,\u201d Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.The Gladiator Arena was a giant chamber of commerce and enjoyed a high status in Bashui Prefecture. If the Sword Marquis Mansion needed ingredients or even pills in bulk, they would certainly purchase those things from the Gladiator Arena.Meanwhile, what attracted people the most about the Gladiator Arena were its duels and life-and-death battles!Jian Wushuang\u2019s father, for example, experienced many battles in the Gladiator Arena over the span of two months and made great progress in that time.\u201cThese pills are so expensive that they\u2019re beyond my means at the moment. If that\u2019s the case, I only have one other way. No matter what happens, I need to give it a go,\u201d Jian Wushuang said firmly, staring at the only First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill left in his palm. Madness and desire colored his expression.A duel!The reason why duels at the Gladiator Arena drew so much attention was the existence of duels leading to fighting and slaughtering between warriors!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But there was, in fact, another stronger force. However, this force had been keeping a low-profile and never engaged in fights. Thus, the title of the strongest force was given to the Sword Marquis Mansion.That transcendent force was none other than the Gladiator Arena!The royals of Tianzong Dynasty were said to be behind the Gladiator Arena. The arena, which was actually the strongest force, was present in every province and county of the Tianzong Dynasty.In Bashui Prefecture, the Gladiator Arena was located in its very center.A masked figure wearing white robes and carrying a Long Sword ambled into the Gladiator Arena.An attendant welcomed him and said, \u201cYour Excellency, what can we do for you?\u201d\u201cI want a duel,\u201d Jian Wushuang replied.\u201cDuel?\u201d The attendant lifted his brows without any surprise.The Gladiator Arena ran a variety of events, among which duels were the most common event.\u201cPlease tell me your name and Cultivation Level,\u201d the attendant said.\u201cCall me Nan. As for my Cultivation Level\u2026\u201d With a flick of his wrist, a jet of Spiritual Power burst out from Jian Wushuang.\u201cThe Fourth Step of the Spirit Path?\u201d The attendant smiled faintly. There were innumerable warriors coming for duels in this place. Warriors in the Transforming Sea Realm or even in Gold Core Realm had participated. Warriors at Jian Wushuang\u2019s level were all too common.\u201cWhat do you want to bet, Mr. Nan?\u201d the attendant asked.\u201cThis.\u201d Jian Wushuang took out the wooden box and opened it.\u201cSprit-cultivating pill?\u201d The attendant recognized the item at a glance but didn\u2019t think much of it. A few seconds later, his expression immediately changed \u201cThis is a First-class Spirit-Cultivating pill?\u201d\u201cMr. Nan, let\u2019s talk in another place. Follow me,\u201d the attendant said, lowering his voice.Jian Wushuang put away his wooden box and nodded. He followed the attendant into a secret chamber where another servant was waiting. The servant was dressed in black robes, clearly having a higher status in this arena.\u201cMr. Nan, our arena is operated in every city of Tianzong Dynasty and our rules are well-known. I believe you\u2019re also aware of it,\u201d the black-robed servant said, looking at Jian Wushuang.\u201cI understand. When you take part in a life-or-death duel, your victory and life is your responsibility.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll arrange a suitable opponent for you as soon as possible. As for that First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pill, please hand it to me now.\u201d The black-robed servant looked at Jian Wushuang.\u201cSure.\u201d Jian Wushuang was already aware of the criteria and he didn\u2019t hesitate to hand the pill over. \u201cMay I know how many First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills I can I get if I win?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always one-to-one in our arena. If you bet one pill, then naturally you\u2019ll only win one. Of course, you can keep dueling if you\u2019re confident,\u201d the black-robed servant said.\u201cOne-to-one?\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s too slow. I don\u2019t have the time to duel this way. Do you have other special duels that would allow me to win more First-class Spirit-Cultivating pills in one go?\u201d\u201cSpecial duels? Yes, we do.\u201d The black-robed servant nodded. \u201cIf you want to win more pills, there\u2019s only one way. That\u2019s the rank-skipping challenge.\u201d The servant\u2019s smile never faltered.\u201cA victory in the rank-skipping challenge pays tenfold. In other words, you\u2019ll get ten pills if you win. But it\u2019s not an easy challenge. 99 percent of our challengers don\u2019t succeed and most of them end up dead!\u201d\u201cThe rank-skipping challenge?\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression darkened.Being in the Fourth Heaven of the Divine Path, he needed to fight with warriors in the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path who wanted to have a duel in the arena.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m only in the Fourth Heaven, my Heavenly Creation Skill is stronger than my peers. My Spiritual Power is also strong enough to rival the common warrior in the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path. There\u2019s still a big gap compared with the Fifth Step, but I have an advantage in Martial Arts Technique!\u201dJian Wushuang had absolute confidence in his own swordsmanship.\u201cMy swordsmanship should be enough to compensate for the gap in Spiritual Power. Besides, I also have my trump card!\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes gleamed, having made his decision.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take the rank-skipping challenge. Please arrange it for me!\u201d\u2026A middle-aged man dressed in a loose purple robe entered the Gladiator Arena.\u201cSupervisor!\u201d\u201cGreetings, Supervisor.\u201dWhenever the servants passed by the middle-aged man, they paid their respects with humility.\u201cAre there any particularly interesting duels going on?\u201d the man asked a Servant.\u201cSir, you came right on time. We\u2019ll have a unique life-and-deal duel very soon. One warrior is at the Fifth Realm of the Spirit Path, but the other is at the Fourth Realm. His breakthrough seems pretty recent too,\u201d the servant replied.\u201cOh, a rank-skipping challenge?\u201d The purple-robed man raised an eyebrow and nodded as if he was intrigued. \u201cI\u2019ll go and check it out.\u201dLarge amounts of spectators crowded around a bluestone arena in the heart of this vast place, all intrigued by the rank-skipping challenge. The purple-robed man found a seat amid the crowd at random, staring at the bluestone arena.With so many spectators around, the atmosphere at the bluestone arena was a chaotic cauldron of noise. The crowd raised an uproar when they saw a dark-skinned man with messy hair stepping onto the arena.\u201cSpear Devil!\u201d\u201cSpear Devil!\u201dMany spectators cheered and howled, filling the whole arena.The man stood in the arena with his long spear, his brass-bell-like eyes sweeping the crowd. He suddenly grinned, revealing a set of white teeth and an expression teeming with ferocity.Spear Devil was considered an expert in the Gladiator Arena. In the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path, he had killed two same-level warriors in life-and-death battles using extremely brutal tactics. Due to the excellent use of his spear, he was nicknamed as such.On the other side of the arena, a masked Jian Wushuang was quietly standing with his long sword. His exposed eyes were fixed on his brutish opponent, keenly feeling the pressure coming from him.Jian Wushuang appeared grim.He knew his opponent was not merely a warrior in the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path. The fact that he could win two duels in this insane arena meant his strength was far greater.He really didn\u2019t want to fight with Spear Devil, much less in a life-and-death battle, if he didn\u2019t have to. But he simply had no choice.After all, time wasn\u2019t on his side. His unique identity was easily identifiable through his sword arts from the Sword Marquis Mansion. He couldn\u2019t participate in duel after duel in this arena at all. That left him only one choice: risking his life to take the rank-skipping challenge and try and win all the First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills he needed in one go.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of you, masked kid. It\u2019s probably your first time fighting in the Gladiator Arena. But you\u2019re really unlucky to meet me.\u201d Spear Devil stared coldly at Jian Wushuang as if he was a predator gazing at its prey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus no one found him out of place.\u201cEnough talk. Let\u2019s fight.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s voice was cold. The minute he finished his sentence, his Spiritual Power was already rising.\u201cThe Fourth Step of the Spirit Path?\u201d Spear Devil was stunned and his face turned red with anger. \u201cYou dare underestimate me?\u201dSpear Devil considered himself very tough after consecutively defeating two same-level warriors. But now, his opponent was just a warrior of the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path. When he considered this, he burst into a rage all of a sudden.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dHis long spear pierced the air like a dragon, causing a shrill sonic boom and appearing in front of Jian Wushuang in the next moment. Spear Devil had also closed the gap of ten meters between him and his opponent at the same time.\u201cHow fast.\u201d Jian Wushuang was startled but his own actions didn\u2019t slow.Swoosh! He drew his Long Sword out of the sheath, instantly producing a sword shadow that was too fast to catch. He swiped at his opponent as his Spiritual Power came bursting forth and pushed his strength to its peak.Clang!The sword and spear clashed with a crisp clanging sound. Jian Wushuang twisted his wrist, inclining his Long Sword forward. With a ghostly jumping movement, the sword crossed the body of the spear and sliced towards Spear Devil\u2019s hands.\u201cThis sword art!\u201d In his shock, Spear Devil\u2019s disdain for his opponent vanished at once.Though it was just a simple sword movement, he realized that Jian Wushuang possessed marvelous swordsmanship.\u201cGet out!\u201d he thundered, forcefully swinging down his arms holding the long spear. His fearsome strength instantly repelled Jian Wushuang\u2019s attack. He turned around, wanting to launch a counteroffensive.\u201cWhether it\u2019s your spear or figure, they are too clumsy. Come up and be my target.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s voice came to his ears, followed by his ethereal sword shadow one after another.Fast. He was too fast.It was so fast that it seemed impossible to have come out of a warrior in the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path. In addition, Jian Wushuang\u2019s swordplay also continually interrupted and gave Spear Devil no room to fight back.\u201cWhat great swordsmanship!\u201d\u201cFearsome!\u201d\u201cThis swordsmanship\u2026\u201dA commotion was raised in the arena, with exclamations rising in succession.The crowd was aware that this battle was a rank-skipping challenge between a warrior of the Fourth Realm of the Spirit Path and a warrior of the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path. Typically, there was no surprise to such battles. After all, there was such a big disparity between the Fourth Step and the Fifth Step. However, everyone was astounded the minute the two started fighting.Spear Devil who was in the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path was actually completely suppressed by the masked warrior in the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path.\u201cInteresting.\u201d The middle-aged man in loose purple robe smiled when he saw the scene unfolding in the arena. \u201cThe masked warrior ought to be a young man, but he has truly great swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, his sword art ought to be the Fallen Leaf Sword Art of the Sword Pavilion. It\u2019s just a general First-class Sword Art, but he has an excellent command of it and is capable of pushing it to great heights. His every move is clean without any unnecessary embellishment. This shows he has a great understanding of the sword art and a solid foundation. His talent in Sword Principles is extraordinary because he possesses such swordsmanship while so young.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, the way the man called Spear Devil used his spear is far inferior. If not for his stronger Spiritual Power, he would\u2019ve lost at the very beginning.\u201dThe middle-aged man in the loose purple robe was the supervisor of the Gladiator Arena and enjoyed foresight as great as his status. With just a glance, he managed to grasp the greatness of Jian Wushuang\u2019s swordsmanship as well as his talent in Sword Principles.The man wasn\u2019t wrong. Jian Wushuang had truly remarkable swordsmanship.He wouldn\u2019t have taken the rank-skipping challenge if he wasn\u2019t confident.On the arena, the battle was overwhelmingly in favor of one person.\u201cHow can this be? How can his sword be so fast? I\u2019m in the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path, but I can\u2019t even catch up to his speed?\u201d Spear Devil was aghast but quickly became agitated.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dSpear Devil growled, raging flames of anger burning in his eyes. He completely exploded in the next moment.Boom!The shrill sonic boom once again rang throughout the arena. Disregarding Jian Wushuang slashing at him, he immediately showed his strongest Killing Move, which had terrifying lethality.\u201cLook! Spear Devil is using his ultimate move!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Thirteen Styles of Cloud-piercing Spear!\u201dSomeone was yelling below the arena.The Thirteen Styles of Cloud-piercing Spear was a continuous attack, with each fiercer and stronger than the one before it. It was the unique move that propelled Spear Devil to fame.The power was so fearsome that even Jian Wushuang couldn\u2019t help feeling nervous. He promptly used his long sword to resist the continuous and fierce spear attacks.Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!His arms felt numb after blocking 12 spear attacks in a single breath. In the meantime, Spear Devil had accumulated his power and pushed it to an ultimate level, demonstrating the strongest and most terrifying 13th spear attack.\u201cDie!\u201d Spear Devil cried, face twisting with ferocity.\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes.Whoosh!The ice-cold sword shadow flashed before disappearing at once.The shadow was unimaginably fast, indescribably so.Vivid red spattered into the air.Spear Devil\u2019s ferocious smile remained etched on his face, but his eyes were filled with resentment and unwillingness. If one looked carefully, one could see a distinct sword wound on the vital part of his throat.Spear Devil, a warrior of the Fifth Realm of the Spirit Path who had won two life-and-death battles in succession, was killed!Jian Wushuang stood by Spear Devil\u2019s corpse, panting heavily.\u201cWhat a close call! They\u2019re indeed warriors who slaughter in the Gladiator Arena. Insanity is etched in their bones. He actually chose to fight life-for-life after being suppressed by my swordsmanship. I can\u2019t match up to his insanity. Fortunately, I had my trump card or it would have been my death today.\u201d Jian Wushuang sighed.Below the arena, everyone was stunned and shocked.Countless spectators were holding their breaths, watching the arena in disbelief.No one expected Spear Devil, a powerful warrior who had won two battles in succession, to die at the hands of a warrior in the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path.The rank-skipping challenge was actually a success?Within the audience, the middle-aged man in loose purple robe finally had a change in expression.

That\u2019s Anonymous Sword Art, Anonymous Sword Art from Sword Marquis Mansion! \u201d The middle-aged man in a purple robe was astonished and couldn\u2019t help recalling the movements Jian Wushuang had demonstrated earlier.His movements were too fast. Though Jian Wushuang\u2019s strength was too weak to be a threat, he might not be able to fend off such an attack if it was made by someone on par with him.It was not his first time witnessing such terrifying swordsmanship.More than a decade ago, a powerful enemy had attacked the Sword Marquis Mansion and defeated many of its Warriors. The Sword Pavilion Master, Jian Nantian, was the only exception. He alone killed the enemy, using precisely this sword art!Anonymous Sword Art!The supreme sword art of Sword Marquis Mansion! It existed only in legends even within Sword Marquis Mansion.Anonymous sword art was simply too profound and mysterious, such that few could use it even after decades of intensive study, much less master it.Furthermore, this sword art was a non-inheritable top secret in Sword Pavilion. Only Sword Pavilion Masters had access to study it, with only three of them in history being able to use it.The Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion may be mighty and extraordinary, but they were nothing compared to the legendary Anonymous sword art.\u201cThis young man actually managed to use the Anonymous Sword Art. Though it was only the First Move, it\u2019s nevertheless incredible. \u201d\u00a0The middle-aged man in a purple robe stared at Jian Wushuang.\u201d The one he used before was the Fallen Leaf Sword Art. He has already reached great heights. As for Anonymous Sword Art, it is the lifeblood of Sword Pavilion. Ordinary people completely don\u2019t have the chance to learn it. \u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so young and only at the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path, but he\u2019s already capable of using so many sword arts of Sword Pavilion. He can even use the legendary Anonymous Sword Art. He must be\u2026 \u201d The middle-aged man seemed to have already guessed Jian Wushuang\u2019s identity and the corners of his mouth lifted. \u201cInteresting! \u201dFollowing the end of the life-or-death battle.\u201cMr. Nan, here are your prizes. \u201dThe black-robed servant of Gladiator Arena handed Jian Wushuang a wooden box. When he opened it, he saw 11 fragrant ivory pills lying inside, including the one that originally belonged to him.The odds of the life-or-death battle between Warriors of the Gladiator Arena within the same rank was one to one, but the rank-skipping challenge was ten to one. That was why he chose it.The greater the risk, the better the harvest.Jian Wushuang examined the wooden box thoroughly. When he was satisfied, he nodded and was ready to leave.The black-robed servant stopped him. \u201cMr. Nan, please wait for a moment. \u201d\u201cIs there anything else? \u201d Jian Wushuang asked, eyes narrowed.The Gladiator Arena had an exceedingly strong status in the entire Tianzong Dynasty and enjoyed great prestige. Though he didn\u2019t worry about what they would do to him just for a mere 11 First-class Spirit-Cultivating pills, he kept his guard up.\u201cOur Supervisor watched your duel against Spear Devil and became interested in you, so he\u2019d like to meet you, \u201d the black-robed servant said.\u201cOh? \u201d Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.Just then, the middle-aged man in a loose purple robe, flanked by a couple of golden-robed servants, entered slowly.\u201cHaha. Mr. Nan, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m Supervisor Bai Chong of the Gladiator Arena. You can call me Sir Bai Chong, \u201d the man said in a clear and bright voice.Surprised, Jian Wushuang immediately bowed. \u201cSir Bai Chong! \u201dThis man\u2019s status was nearly on par with the Sword Marquis Mansion Master, perhaps higher. Jian Wushuang had to show reverence.\u201cYou can leave now, \u201d Bai Chong told the black-robed servant, waving a hand. The servant bowed and excused himself.\u201cMr. Nan, I suppose the swordsmanship you used to kill Spear Devil is the Anonymous Sword Art of Sword Pavilion? \u201d Bai Chong smiled faintly at Jian Wushuang and said, \u201cAs far as I know, that\u2019s the top secret of Sword Pavilion that only successive Sword Pavilion Masters are allowed to study. Now, the only person in the entire Sword Pavilion who can possibly understand it is Jian Wushuang, the son of the missing Master, Jian Nantian. He\u2019s the only one who has a chance of learning the Anonymous Sword Art due to their relationship. So I\u2019m wondering if you have anything to do with Jian Wushuang. \u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s heart thumped, eyes revealing a hint of panic.Obviously, Bai Chong was already aware of his identity.\u201cI was discovered even though I only fought once. \u201d Jian Wushuang sighed helplessly.Truthfully, he had inherited the Anonymous Sword Art from his father. This sword art was indeed the top sword art of Sword Pavilion. He had hidden it so well all this while that not even Jian Meng\u2019er was aware of it.And he had chosen the rank-skipping challenge to get all the First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills he needed in one go because he was worried someone would recognize him if he showed up too much in the Gladiator Arena. Participating in one battle lowered those chances.Yet he was forced to use his strongest skill, Anonymous Sword Art, against Spear Devil. He didn\u2019t expect a sharp-eyed man to be watching him among the crowd.\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. \u201d Noticing the surprise in Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes, Bai Chong immediately understood the situation and faked a laugh. \u201cFrom the looks of it, you seem to urgently need First-class Spirit-cultivating Pills. Is that right, Mr. Nan? \u201d\u201cYes. \u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cWell, these First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills are beneficial to Spirit Path Warriors but they require a long time to be absorbed. You may have 11 First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills now but you\u2019ll need at least a year to take in all of them, \u201d Bai Chong said.\u201cYou\u2019re right. \u201d Jian Wushuang nodded but was disagreeing with him internally.It was true that other people would need at least a year to take in 11 First-class Spirit-cultivating Pills. But he was different\u2026He was a Deviant Cultivator who cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill!Thanks to the amazing power of the Heavenly Creation Skill, he could absorb these First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills very quickly. It wouldn\u2019t even take him a month to absorb all of them!\u201cIt\u2019s too time-consuming to absorb all these First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills. If you want to boost your strength in a short amount of time, it doesn\u2019t seem realistic to merely rely on them, \u201d Bai Chong said.\u201cSir Bai Chong, what are you trying to say? \u201d Jian Wushuang asked, frowning.Bai Chong smiled at him. \u201cMr. Nan, have you heard of Primordial Spiritual Liquid? \u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As it contained extremely refined Spiritual Power, it was better at promoting a Warrior\u2019s cultivation compared to Sprit-cultivating pills.However, its formation required very rare conditions, making it extremely valuable.Additionally, the demand for Primordial Spiritual Liquid was extraordinarily high, even Warriors\u00a0in the Spirit Path Realm tried to cultivate with the aid of Primordial Spiritual Liquid. Therefore, there were few Warriors who were able to use Primordial Spiritual Liquid in the entire Tianzong Dynasty, let alone those in Sword Marquis Mansion.Although there was some Primordial Spiritual Liquid in Sword Marquis Mansion, the effect on their Warriors was insignificant due to the small amount.\u201cI know a place where there is a pond formed completely out of Primordial Spiritual Liquid. Are you interested? \u201d Bai Chong gave Jian Wushang a smile.\u201cA pond? \u201d Jian Wushuang was intrigued by this.A meager amount of Primordial Spiritual Liquid would have little effect on promoting a Warrior\u2019s cultivation, while an abundance of it would play a totally different role.A pond formed out of Primordial Spiritual Liquid? How much was Primordial Spiritual Liquid there?\u201cIt\u2019s in a cave of a rift in the northern part of Nine-wolves Mountain, which is 15 km away from the commandery city. But for a long time, it\u2019s been occupied by a Bloody Lion at the peak of Rank Six. If you want to enter the cave, it is necessary to get rid of the Bloody Lion, \u201d Bai Chong said with a smile.\u201cA rift in the north\u2026 Nine-wolves Mountain. \u201d Jian Wushuang secretly bore it in mind and replied gratefully, \u201cThank you, Sir Bai Chong! \u201d\u201cPlease, you are welcome. \u201d Bai Chong waved at him.Jian Wushuang looked deep in his eyes and then turned away.After Jian Wushuang had gone, a golden-robed servant behind Bai Chong could not help saying, \u201cSupervisor, that pond is formed completely out of Primordial Spiritual Liquid. With such abundant Primordial Spiritual Liquid, it\u2019s value is\u2026 very high. \u201d\u201cThe pond is so precious, not because of the Primordial Spiritual Liquid, but the Spiritual Fruit at the bottom of the pond. The Primordial Spiritual Liquid was formed due to the Spiritual Fruit. \u201d Bai Chong shook his head and laughed. \u201cTell those people who go to the pond to only take the Spiritual Fruit away. Just ignore the Primordial Spiritual Liquid and Bloody Lion. \u201d\u201cGot it. \u201d The golden-robed servant nodded. In the Gladiator Arena, the Supervisor was so powerful that no one dared to violate his orders.\u201cBy the way, will the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle be held next month? \u201d Bai Chong again asked.\u201cYes,\u201d the golden-robed servant replied respectfully. \u201cSupervisor, you\u2019ve been invited to the Sword Marquis Mansion. Moreover, the new Sword Pavilion Master will officially take office. I heard that the new Sword Pavilion Master is Jian Meng\u2019er, the most gifted youth in Sword Marquis Mansion, who is less than 16 years old but has already reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. She is also the daughter of Jian Lan, the Great Elder of Red Martial Hall. \u201d\u201cOh? \u201d Bai Chong unfurrowed his brows. \u201cHaha, it seems that the Sword Marquis Token Battle will be very interesting this year. Now I am looking forward to it! \u201d\u201cThe son of Jian Nantian\u2026 Tut-tut, I want to see if he will surprise me as his father did. \u201d\u2026On the way back to Sword Marquis Mansion, Jian Wushuang kept thinking,\u201cThe pond is formed completely out of Primordial Spiritual Liquid, so it would be extremely valuable. Why did he tell me this information? It must be because of my father! \u201d Jian Wushuang guessed with some certainty.His father had told him that, due to his aloofness and pride, he had few friends. But, Bai Chong was one of them.Obviously, Bai Chong recognized me and, as a friend of my father, he chose to tell me that.\u201cWhether he told me for the sake of my father or not, I am grateful for his kindness, \u201c Jian Wushuang thought secretly.I n a pond that is formed completely out of Primordial Spiritual Liquid, even average people would greatly benefit if they cultivated there, let alone I, who cultivates the Heavenly Creation Skill. However, there is a Bloody Lion at the peak of Rank Six, which is comparable to the peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path for humans. Presently, I am not capable of fighting against it.\u201cTake it slow. I need to enhance my abilities first! \u201d Jian Wushuang clenched his hands firmly.In the Earth-level Cultivating Room of Sword Pavilion\u2014\u201cFirst-class Spirit-cultivating Pills have amazing efficacy. Previously, I broke through the Fourth Heaven of the Divine Path from the Third Heaven of the Divine Path after swallowing just one pill. Now, I have 11 First-class Spirit-cultivating Pills. I really wonder to what extent my strength will reach after absorbing all 11 First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills! \u201d Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on the futon, with fervent eyes.\u201cI am ready! \u201dWithout hesitation, Jian Wushuang opened the jade box and took one First-class Spirit-cultivating Pill. After he took this elixir, Heavenly Creation Skill functioned to quickly absorb that amazing energy.In the following days, Jian Wushuang still carried out his earnest cultivation.When compared to other skills, it took less time to cultivate Heavenly Creation Skill. Furthermore, the cultivation speed increased due to its ability of rapid recovery and the assisting effects of the Earth-level Cultivating Room.Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang freely ingested those First-class Spirit-cultivating Pills, which countless cultivators of the Spirit Path coveted.All of that accelerated his cultivation to an incredible level.In the blink of an eye, half a month passed by. There was now only one month until the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle.That night, it showered.Jian Wushuang, who had continued to stay overnight inside the Earth-level Cultivating Room, completely absorbed the efficacy of those pills inside his body. He then slowly opened his eyes, and there was a dormant, rumbling Spiritual Power within his body. As he abruptly clenched his hands, an explosive force erupted volcanically, as if a punch could cause the air to explode.Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were sparkling with a dazzling light.\u201cThe Sixth Heaven of the Divine Path! Almost reaching the peak of the Sixth Heaven! \u201dJian Wushuang was ecstatic.With his desperate cultivation over half a month, he had completely absorbed the energy from the 11 First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills. After all, the efficacy of a First-class Spirit-cultivating Pill was amazing. For average Warriors, it took at least one month to thoroughly absorb one pill. However, he had absorbed 11 pills in a very short time, by virtue of the Heavenly Creation Skill.As a result, his strength increased by leaps and bounds.It was a long way from the Fourth Heaven of the Divine Path to the Sixth Heaven of the Divine Path\u2014almost to the peak of the Sixth Heaven of the Divine Path!Many people would have been startled had they known that he had cultivated at such an unbelievable speed. Because only one month ago, they knew that he was trash who could not condense Spiritual Power.\u201cYou just wait and see, Jian Meng\u2019er. I will startle you in one month! \u201d Jian Wushuang clenched his hands firmly, with an undiluted self-confidence in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt that Jian Wushuang had changed a lot in terms of his strength.Jian Wushuang did not voluntarily release his aura of Spiritual Power, so Elder Hong could not figure out his exact cultivation. However, he knew that Jian Wushuang must have made great progress in the cultivation room.\u201cIt seems that our Young Pavillion Master has made big strides lately,\u201d Elder Hong said smiling.\u201cYeah.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded and asked, \u201cElder Hong, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Elder Hong replied. \u201cThe Trial Tower has opened again today. If you want to join the fight, you should try.\u201d\u201cTrial Tower? \u201dJian Wushuang was intrigued by this information.Trial Tower was a seven-story building made for testing cultivation and martial arts techniques. The higher the floor, the more difficult the test. It was usually closed, except for the month before the year-end battle each year. The Trial Tower test could be regarded as a preliminary battle.After all, the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle was the most significant event in Sword Marquis Mansion. Every year, the Mansion would invite influential masters from within the Bashui Prefecture. To ensure a good performance for the masters, the participating disciples had to pass the Trial Tower in advance.At a minimum, only disciples who had reached the fifth story, of the seven-story tower, were qualified to participate in the battle. Therefore, Jian Wushuang had to pass this test in the Trial Tower if he wanted to participate in the battle.\u201cI am leaving for Nine-wolves Mountain soon, and I will stay there for one month. Since I have to get the entry qualification for the battle, I have to take this chance at the Trial Tower and pass the test first.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought to himself.It would be a piece of cake for him to pass the Trial Tower test. Once he made up his mind, Jian Wushuang went directly to the Trial Tower.Trial Tower stood erect in the very center of a huge courtyard; it was a gigantic tower, more than 33 meters high. At that moment, there were a lot of disciples in front of the huge tower.\u201cLook, the sixth gem has been lit! Cousin Jian Lin has passed the sixth story!\u201d\u201cCousin Jian Lin is really awesome! \u201d\u201cHmm, how would you know? Cousin Jian Lin broke through the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path long ago. He has reached the peak of the Sixth Step. With his cultivation of spiritual power, it\u2019s a cinch for him to pass the seventh story, never mind the sixth story. Look, the seventh gem has already been lit.\u201dSeveral disciples stared at the seven gems in front of the tower gate. Each gem corresponded to one story of the Trial Tower. After passing one story, a gem would be lit up. If all seven gems were lit up, it meant that all seven stories had been passed.It must have been that Jian Lin, who had reached the peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path, was going to pass all seven stories.Soon after, the tower gate opened once again. The cyan-clothed Jian Lin walked out slowly, with a confident smile. Noticing the envious glances from the surrounding disciples, he was extremely proud of himself.\u201cJian Lin has passed the seventh story. He is qualified to participate in the Sword Marquis Token Battle.\u201d In front of the tower gate, an Elder from Red Martial Hall wrote his name down rapidly, and then looked around, saying \u201cNext!\u201dMany disciples hesitated.It was hard to pass the Trial Tower test. If one wanted to pass the fifth story, he needed to have a Spiritual Power Cultivation of the Fifth Step of Spirit Path. Moreover, if they wanted to take part in the battle, he had to be under sixteen.In the Mansion, the number of disciples who could satisfy these two conditions was only modest. With so few qualifiers and so many bystanders, one would feel embarrassed, if they took the test but then failed to even pass the fifth story.\u201cLet me have a try.\u201dAs a voice rose, a young figure slowly came over. He had a long sword behind his back.Many disciples looked at him. They were astonished when they recognized him.\u201cIs it him?\u201d\u201cJian Wushang? \u201d\u201cJian Wushuang of the Sword Pavilion, was he the one who just spoke?\u201d\u201cHow could he possibly pass the Trial Tower test?\u201dEveryone was in disbelief.As the son of the last Sword Pavilion Master, Jian Wushuang had a special identity. Furthermore, he was universally recognized as trash in the Mansion, because he had not been able to gather Spiritual Power. Therefore, all the disciples in the Mansion knew him.For this reason, they were extremely skeptical when he decided to attempt the test of the Trial Tower.In addition to the disciples, the note-keeping Elder of Red Martial Hall could not help raising his head with surprise in his eyes, asking \u201cYou want to take the test in Trial Tower?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked indifferent.\u201cOf course, you can. As long as you are a disciple of the Mansion under 16.\u201d The Elder nodded, saying, \u201cPlease go in.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Jian Wushuang went directly into the tower, ignoring the multitude of eyes upon him.Just as he ascended the steps, a voice that was obviously unfriendly rose from the side, \u201cJian Wushuang, how dare you come here to take the test? You overestimate yourself!\u201dJian Wushuang paused and glanced coldly at Jian Lin, who glared at him with contempt. Without a word, he continued to walk toward the Trial Tower. Soon, he was inside the tower.When he saw this, Jian Lin slightly turned the corner of his lips, \u201cHmph. Trash like you is so arrogant. Wait and see, you will be embarrassed later.\u201d\u201cCousin Jian Lin, do you think Jian Wushuang can pass the fifth story?\u201d a disciple of Red Martial Hall asked.\u201cHim?\u201d Jian Lin responded with a sneer, \u201cTo pass the fifth story one must have a cultivation of the Fifth Step of Spirit Path. He reached the Third Step of Spirit Path more than half a month ago. Now, he might have reached the Fourth Step of Spirit Path at most.\u201d\u201cEven if he is the son of the last Sword Pavilion Master and possesses outstanding swordsmanship, it is still idiotic nonsense for him to pass the fifth story with a cultivation of the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path.\u201dThe surrounding people all agreed with him.More than half a month ago, he had just reached the Third Step of the Spirit Path. How strong could he be now?He might have reached the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path at most. How could he possibly pass the fifth story in the Trial Tower? What a joke!\u201cHumph, he is asking for grief.\u201d Jian Lin sneered. He expected that Jian Wushuang would disgrace himself in front of everyone.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were opponents that he needed to confront.\u201cTrial Tower\u2014A place where cultivation and Martial Arts Techniques are assessed. In general, anyone whose Cultivation reaches the Sixth Step will complete seven levels in total. Even those who have outstanding Martial Arts Techniques at the peak of the Fifth Step may get to the Seventh Level as well. Therefore, I am curious about how far I can go using only my swordsmanship and not using any Spiritual Power. \u201c Jian Wushuang thought secretly.\u201cI am ready! \u201dAfter saying that, Jian Wushuang waved the Long Sword in his hand. Wow~~~ Instantly, condensed sword essence directly erupted like roaring waves.\u201cSword Tide! \u201d Jian Wushuang yelled with wildness in his eyes.Sword Tide was a deadly move from a First-class Sword Art\u2014Ceaseless Waterflow Sword Art.And it was wielded at its best by Jian Wushuang.After some simple movements, a sword shadow swept over the room. Those three Humanoid Puppets instantly fought back. However, being at the entrance level, they were much weaker than Jian Wushuang. Even if Jian Wushuang did not use his Spiritual Power, he could defeat them easily with only his quick and forceful swordsmanship.The First Level\u2014passed!Outside Trial Tower, the first gem lit up, which meant that he made it through the First Level. The disciples around it did not feel surprised.\u201cHumph! Only the First Level. With his cultivation in the Third Step of Spirit Path, he should easily pass through the first three floors. And completing the Fourth Level is also possible. However, it is an idiot\u2019s daydream to think that he will complete the Fifth Level. \u201d Jian Lin\u2019s face was still full of contempt.Not long after the first gem had lit up, the second one lit up and, soon after, the third one followed. All intervals were short, which meant that it did not take Jian Wushuang too much time to defeat those Humanoid Puppets on each floor. However, it was only after a long interval that the fourth one lit up.\u201cHe stayed on the fourth floor for a long time, so he obviously spent a lot of time battling hard with the Humanoid Puppets there. As for the fifth floor, the Humanoid Puppets are much stronger than the ones downstairs. There is no chance for him to win! \u201d\u201cThe Fourth Level must be his limit. \u201d\u201cHaha, I knew it. Trash like him, how can he pass through the Fifth Level of Trial Tower? \u201dMany disciples around sneered and booed. They thought Jian Wushuang had given his all to make it through the Fourth Level. Otherwise, why would he have been held up for such a long time?Jian Lin especially sneered again and again, smiling sardonically, and could not wait to make fun of Jian Wushuang when he walked out of Trial Tower.On the fifth floor of Trial Tower, Jian Wushuang\u2019s face appeared was grim.\u201cAfter each level, the strength of the Humanoid Puppets greatly increase. I easily completed the first three levels with swordsmanship only. However, on the Fourth Level, I went through a tough battle and it took a long time to defeat them. Therefore, on the fifth floor, it will be impossible to defeat them with swordsmanship alone. Let me use Spiritual Power. \u201d Jian Wushuang stretched the sides of his mouth upward, then Spiritual Power burst forth in a flash.If disciples outside Trial Tower knew that Jian Wushuang completed the first four levels with only his swordsmanship, it would have scared the pants off of them. In general, a Warrior who wanted to pass the Fourth Level of Trial Tower at least needed to be in the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path. However, he had gotten through it without using Spiritual Power. In other words, his Martial Arts Technique was well matched with cultivation of Warriors in the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path!It was incredible.Once his Spiritual Power, which was nearly at the peak of the Sixth Heaven of Divine Path, burst out, it was much easier for Jian Wushuang to fight against those Humanoid Puppets.The disciples outside Trial Tower, including Jian Lin, were waiting to see how Jian Wushuang would bring shame upon himself. But, just then\u2026\u201cHum~~~! \u201dThe fifth gem by the door of Trial Tower lit up.Upon seeing that, the disciples were suddenly astonished.It meant that Jian Wushuang had gotten through the Fifth Level.\u201cHow could this be? \u201d\u201cImpossible. He took such a long time on the Fourth Level. Clearly, he completed that with great difficulty. So, how could he get through the Fifth Level? \u201d\u201cDoes this mean that trash has reached the Fifth Step of the Spirit Path in his Cultivation? \u201dAll of their faces were full of disbelief and astonishment. Jian Lin was even more astonished with a wide open mouth but did not know what to say.However, that was just the beginning. \u201cHum~~~! \u201d Before they could react, the sixth gem lit up.\u201cThe Sixth Level! \u201d Having seen that, all of the disciples who were gathered there held their breath for a second.Then, after less than 15 minutes, the last one also lit up instantly.All seven gems, each embodying one floor of Trial Tower, had lit up. It meant that Jian Wushuang had completed all of them!Silence!Outside was deathly silent. All the people on site looked at those seven sparkling gems in disbelief. They had never been in such a state of shock before.\u201cThe Seventh Level\u2026 he made it through the Seventh Level? \u201d Jian Lin was dumbstruck.Actually, he swore that Jian Wushuang was, at most, only at the Fourth Step of the Spirit Path before he had gone into Trial Tower. To scrape by the Fourth Level was lucky for him. There was no chance for him to make it through the Fifth Level.But what was the reality?The Fifth Level?Jian Wushuang had not only passed through the fifth floor, but he also passed through the sixth and the seventh. He had passed through all seven floors of Trial Tower. Now, he was as strong as him.\u201cImpossible! \u201d\u201cThis is by no means possible! \u201dJian Lin shook his head fiercely. He could never believe that this had happened.While all of them were in shock, they did not notice that Jian Wushuang had walked out of the Trial Tower door.\u201cShua! \u201dIn a flash, all eyes turned toward him, making him the focal point on the field. Even the Elder from Red Martial Hall who was in charge of recording the results was now staring at Jian Wushuang in utter surprise.\u201cAm I qualified to enter the Sword Marquis Token Battle in one month? \u201d Jian Wushuang looked at the Elder and asked.The Elder was startled for a second. Then he returned to himself, nodded, and said, \u201cJian Wushuang has completed the Seventh Level. Qualified. \u201dJian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction. However, the people around him burst into a heated discussion.\u201cThe Seventh Level. How could it be possible? \u201d\u201cHow could Jian Wushuang get past the seventh floor? \u201d\u201cIt generally requires a Warrior whose Cultivation reaches the Sixth Step of Spirit Path to complete it. However, Jian Wushuang\u2014he could not condense any Spiritual Power just one month ago, could he? \u201d\u201cNo. No. His Cultivation could not be that strong. His swordsmanship must have been what helped him. Yes. That is right. I will never believe that a person without any Spiritual Power could reach the Sixth Step of Spirit Path in just one month. \u201dMany disciples were denigrating him.\u201cJian Wushuang! \u201dA somber voice called out. Before he could react, a figure stood in front of Jian Wushuang\u2014It was Jian Lin. He was so angry that his face was twisted\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I never expected that you had hidden yourself so deeply. Everyone thought you were trash who could not condense any Spiritual Power. But now it appears you could condense Spiritual Power long ago, and your Cultivation is not bad. You have just hidden your power and were unwilling to expose it.\u201d Jian Lin\u2019s voice was as cold as a knife.\u201dAbout half a month ago, you exposed your Cultivation at the Third Step of Spirit Path in front of me. You faked that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cPretend? Does he think I hid my strength for four years?\u201d Jian Wushuang sneered inwardly but did not give an answer.Jian Lin and the surrounding disciples could think what they liked.\u00a0It didn\u2019t matter if they thought he had hidden his strength all this time or something similar. He did not mind at all. In the Sword Marquis Mansion, what he really cared about was one person: Jian Meng\u2019er.Jian Wushuang\u2019s indifference, even disregard, made Jian Lin even angrier.\u201cJian Wushuang, I have passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower before. Now you have made it too, so do you dare to fight with me?\u201d Jian Lin said directly.\u201cFight with you in public?\u201d Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at him.\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t dare?\u201dThe corner of Jian Lin\u2019s mouth turned up slightly, with a hint of disdain.\u201cJian Lin, I am very curious. There are many disciples in the Sword Marquis Mansion. Why do you always target me? If you envy me because of Jian Meng\u2019er, well, now I am done with her. Why do you still bother me? Is your mind so narrow?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked with disdain.His guess was correct. Jian Lin was narrow-minded, and he was filled with jealousy. As Jian Wushuang had spent so much time with Jian Meng\u2019er in the past, this caused Jian Lin\u2019s resentment toward him to reach its limit. Even though the relationship between them was now over, his resentment hadn\u2019t faded at all.\u201cEnough talk! I am just asking whether you dare to fight me.\u201d Jian Lin stared at Jian Wushuang firmly.Hearing these words, Jian Wushuang\u2019s mouth tilted slightly. He took a deep breath and raised his head again. His eyes flashed with a hint of relief. \u201cWell, I promise you, if you want to fight, then we will fight!\u201dThere was a stir throughout the whole Trial Tower.\u201cAccepted the challenge! He accepted the challenge!\u201d\u201cHow dare he accept it?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he? After all, he has passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower. Maybe his Cultivation of Spiritual Power has reached the Sixth Step, too!\u201d\u201cWait! They both passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower. Brother Jian Lin\u2019s Cultivation reached the Peak of the Sixth Step long ago. Obviously, Jian Wushuang has been hiding his Cultivation level this whole time. Their fight will be very interesting.\u201dDisciples surrounding them, looking forward to the fight.\u201cYou have got guts.\u201dJian Lin grinned hideously, but he didn\u2019t look Jian Wushuang in the eye at all.Even if he had passed the seventh level of the Trial Tower, it would not make any difference. Everyone knew that any disciple whose Cultivation had reached the Sixth Step could pass the seventh level easily. As for him, he had reached the Peak of the Sixth Step long ago!\u201cTake this!\u201dJian Lin roared loudly and stamped his foot. He was so powerful that a crack appeared in the floor and boundless Spiritual Power poured out like a flood. Using his Spiritual Power, his right hand was clenched into a fist. Immediately he threw a punch with vast power, raising a fierce wind around him.His Cultivation at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path burst out instantly.Many disciples present kept their eyes open. Although the fist was not aimed at them, they still could feel it\u2019s tremendous force.Facing the full outburst of Jian Lin\u2019s power, Jian Wushuang kept his eyes cold and sharp. His Spiritual Power poured out slowly.\u201cThe Sixth Step!\u201d\u201cIt really is the Sixth Step!\u201dAs soon as Jian Wushuang\u2019s Spiritual Power was revealed, many disciples around him knew his true Cultivation immediately.Although they were both at the Sixth Step, there were some differences.\u201cGet out of my way!\u201dAn angry roar sounded out like a thunderbolt. Jian Wushuang struck with all his power.\u201cHa-ha, you dare fight me without drawing your sword. How stupid!\u201d Jian Lin could not help laughing.Everyone knew that Jian Lin was at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Watching Jian Wushuang\u2019s reaction, it was obvious that he was uncertain if he could battle this level. Under the circumstances, he would be at an absolute disadvantage if he confronted Jian Lin directly.BANG!Two Spiritual Power fists finally crashed together. The two fists containing hidden power exploded out at the same time.\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen Jian Lin\u2019s fist slammed into Jian Wushuang\u2019s, his face changed, because he felt the frightening power from Jian Wushuang\u2019s fist.This power was apparently stronger than his.\u201cHow is this possible? He hasn\u2019t reached the Peak of the Sixth Step!\u201d Jian Lin roared in his heart.With a heart filled with astonishment and anger, Jian Lin felt a burst of sharp pain. He groaned slightly, and blood spilt from his mouth. He retreated back ten steps, and every step was so heavy and forceful that he left deep tracks on the floor.However, Jian Wushuang did not retreat even one step.Outclassed!Jian Wushuang totally surpassed Jian Lin in power!\u201cThis\u2026\u201dMany disciples were shocked.No one had thought the competition in pure force would turn out like this.One who obviously had not reached the Peak of the Sixth Step should not have outclassed Jian Lin who was at the Peak of the same realm!However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill. It defied the natural order, and the Spiritual Power Warriors could release was much stronger than Warriors following other forms of cultivations. Although Jian Wushuang had not reached the Peak of the Sixth Heaven of Divine Path, the Spiritual Power he was capable of unleashing was stronger than other Warriors at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path.In this competition, totally focused on strength, Jian Wushuang completely outclassed Jian Lin.\u201cI can not believe it!\u201dA flash of insanity appeared in Jian Lin eyes. He was repelled by Jian Wushuang. He groaned and then rushed toward Jian Wushuang. He stretched out his right hand. A tiger\u2019s roar erupted suddenly between heaven and earth. Then, a Giant Tiger began to gradually form from the convergence of his power.After completely materialising, the Giant Tiger charged at Jian Wushuang like lightning.\u201cIt\u2019s Tiger-roaring Fist!\u201d\u201cBrother Jian Lin is using a Martial Arts Technique and he is using his most powerful one!\u201d\u201cThat Giant Tiger was totally condensed by Spiritual Power. This movement costs vast Spiritual Power, but it is really strong.\u201d\u201cLook, Jian Wushuang is drawing his sword\u2026\u201d\u201cThe movement of the sword!\u201dCHUU!The cold sword light was shining, and then it vanished immediately. Time seemed to stop completely for a moment. In front of the shocked audience, the aggressive Giant Tiger was split into two.CHOU\u2026 The sound of a Sword Edge piercing into the body rang out. A smear of blood splashed across Jian Lin\u2019s shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But before going, he stopped to glance at Jian Lin and said coldly, \u201cThis time I only chopped into your shoulder. But if there is a next time, I will chop off your head.\u201dHearing this, Jian Lin was shocked and humiliated, feeling ashamed and resentful.And the disciples of Marquis mansion did not recover from their surprise until Jian Wushuang had completely disappeared from their sight.Then, everyone present could not stop talking about what had happened.\u201cBrother Jian Lin was defeated. How could this happen!\u201d\u201cOne move. Only one move!\u201d\u201cThere is quite a big disparity in strength! Not only in their Spiritual Powers, but the disparity between their Martial Arts Techniques is even greater!\u201dAnd it was.Jian Wushuang surpassed Jian Lin in explosive Spiritual Power. And as for Martial Arts Technique\u2026 It should be known that Jian Meng\u2019er, whose attainments in swordsmanship were marvelous, was regarded as the First Genius in the Sword Marquis Mansion. But her swordsmanship was taught to her by Jian Wushuang.Even Jian Meng\u2019er herself knew that she was not qualified to compete with Jian Wushuang in Martial Arts Technique.In the entire Sword Marquis Mansion, it seemed that there was no one better than Jian Wushuang in Martial Arts Technique.Because of the great disparity in their Martial Arts Techniques, Jian Wushuang had defeated Jian Lin with only one move and had hurt his shoulder. If Jian Wushuang had wanted to, he could have killed Jian Lin just now.\u2026The news that Jian Wushuang had passed the Seventh Level of the Trial Tower and defeated Jian Lin with one move swept over Sword Marquis Mansion like a hurricane.Suddenly, the Sword Marquis Mansion was in total shock.Naturally, the news also came to Jian Meng\u2019er at once.\u201cMeng\u2019er, something happened in the Marquis\u2019s mansion today.\u201d It was Jian Lan, the father of Jian Meng\u2019er, who told her the news. \u201cJian Wushuang had consolidated Spiritual Power and become a Warrior. Moreover, his Cultivation had reached the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Today, he passed the Seventh Level of the Trial Tower and defeated Jian Lin with only one move.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dEven Jian Meng\u2019er felt quite astonished upon hearing that.\u201cBefore our friendship broke up, he often said that he would be a real Warrior soon. At that time, I thought he was just comforting himself. But now it seems that he wasn\u2019t.\u201d After being a little astonished, she slightly smiled and obviously did not take it seriously.\u201cMeng\u2019er, I\u2019m afraid that you should attach some importance to this,\u201d Jian Lan said seriously. \u201cThough many people in the Marquis\u2019s mansion thought that Jian Wushuang had been concealing his strength, you and I know that there was indeed no Spiritual Power in his body just one month ago.\u201dDuring the last four years, Jian Meng\u2019er was together with Jian Wushuang all the time. No one knew him better than they did.\u201cIn only one month, he went from an ordinary man without any Spiritual Power to a warrior of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path and defeated Jian Lin so easily. What terrifying progress he has made,\u201d Jian Lan said.\u201cSo he has.\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er nodded in agreement, \u201cBut, so what?\u201dJian Lan was stunned for a second.\u201cFather, you\u2019re worrying that he will be a powerful opponent in the battle next month, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er asked.Jian Lan nodded.Jian Wushuang had taken a blood oath that he would compete against Jian Meng\u2019er in the battle. That news spread throughout Sword Marquis Mansion. At first, none of them took it seriously. But now, they changed their minds.If Jian Wushuang defeated Jian Meng\u2019er in front of all the people of Sword Marquis Mansion and the other strong experts present, she would fail to be the Sword Pavilion Master. Furthermore, she and her father would be laughed at by everyone.Jian Meng\u2019er, universally acknowledged as the top genius in Sword Marquis Mansion, was completely surpassed by someone within two months. Was that not a big joke?\u201cFather, you worry too much.\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er did not care about it at all and said, \u201cIt\u2019s normal that Jian Wushuang could eventually consolidate Spiritual Power and make normal progress after practicing for four years. Although he could go from an ordinary man to reaching the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path within one month, he won\u2019t be able to reach the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path by next month. What do you think, father?\u201d\u201cReach the Seventh Step in one month?\u201d Jian Lan was stupefied for a moment and then shook his head firmly and resolutely. \u201cImpossible. Absolutely impossible.\u201cThere is a great disparity between the Sixth and Seventh Steps of the Spirit Path. Even a genius in cultivation like you spent a full half-year advancing from the Sixth Step to the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path. Moreover, you couldn\u2019t have succeeded without the assistance of lots of elixirs and some Natural Treasures\u2014let alone an ordinary person. Therefore, no matter how fast Jian Wushuang cultivates, he can\u2019t reach the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path in one month,\u201dJian Lan said resolutely and decisively.And indeed, that was true. A great disparity did exist between the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path and the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path. To make a breakthrough within one month was definitely wishful thinking.\u201cYes, it\u2019s almost impossible. Besides, even if he did succeed, what could he do?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er said disdainfully.Hearing what Jian Meng\u2019er had said, Jian Lan relaxed the frown on his face and then smiled.Indeed, regardless of whether or not Jian Wushuang could reach the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path in a month, he could do nothing even if he did make it.Presently, Jian Meng\u2019er possessed Cultivation at the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. No matter how extraordinary Jian Wushuang was in swordsmanship, he could not compete with Jian Meng\u2019er unless he was in the Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cMaybe I am overthinking this. Jian Wushuang can\u2019t threaten you.\u201d Jian Lan smiled in relief. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about him. Tell me about the master behind you. Is there any reply to the message?\u201d\u201cI have gotten a reply,\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er answered with expectation, \u201cGreat Master said that she would present herself at the battle in one month to witness me becoming the new Sword Pavilion Master!\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s great. If she could present herself at the battle, you would no doubt be the winner.\u201d Hearing the good news, Jian Lan felt very delighted.In the Sword Pavilion, the Four Great Elders, headed by Elder Hong, were gathered.\u201cHaha. Young Pavillion Master passed the Seventh Level and defeated Jian Lin with one move. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that the Young Pavillion Master could have made such rapid progress in such a short period of time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIf the Young Pavillion Master keeps improving at such a speed, he is likely to defeat Jian Meng\u2019er in the battle next month.\u201dHaving heard the good news, these Elders were all talking and laughing.\u201cElder Brother, we concealed that matter from the Young Pavillion Master because he was previously not even a Warrior. But now, should we tell him about it?\u201d another Elder suddenly asked.\u201cNo hurry,\u201d Elder Hong shook his head and said, \u201cit\u2019s too early. We should tell him a bit later.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m going to write a letter and send it to the master in the Golden-dragon Palace. He will be glad to know that the Young Pavillion Master has made such rapid progress.\u201d\u2026The whole Sword Marquis Mansion was shocked by the battle between Jian Wushuang and Jian Lin. However, Jian Wushuang, the hero of the battle, did not care about it at all. After getting permission to join in the battle, he directly left for Nine-wolves Mountain.Jian Wushuang was very eager to get to the pond full of Primordial Spiritual Liquid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He spent a long time trying to find the cave in the north rift of the Mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s that cave. \u201d Standing at the top of a big tree, Jian Wushuang could see a cave at the bottom of the rift. Not far from the cave was a huge monster; its breathing sounded rhythmically from its nose.\u201cIs that a Bloody Lion? \u201d Jian Wushuang stared at the huge monster, unable to look away.Bai Chong had mentioned that the cave with Primordial Spiritual Liquid was the territory of a Bloody Lion at the Peak of the Sixth Realm. A monster at the Peak of that realm could match a Warrior at the Peak of the Sixth Step of Spirit Path. Some spirit beasts had innate advantages, so when they battled human beings, they were stronger.\u201cThe spirit beasts are born to hate human beings, and their territorial awareness is extremely strong. If I want to get into that cave, I have no choice but to kill the Bloody Lion. So let\u2019s fight! \u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were like lightning. Like an eagle preying on its food, he leapt down from the treetop.\u00a0Long Sword on his back was unsheathed at the same time. The sound of his sword echoed in the rift, as Jian Wushuang rushed violently towards the Bloody Lion.\u201cBloody Lion! \u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were full of battle intent.\u201cHuman Being! \u201d Bloody Lion woke up with a start and a pair of dark gold eyes burst out with cold killing intent. With an angry roar, it charged ferociously at Jian Wushuang.The battle surprisingly finished in just an instant.Jian Wushuang sheathed his bloody Long Sword and looked at Bloody Lion on the ground. Blood oozed from the deep sword scar in its neck. Many sword scars of different sizes were spread all over its body. It was dead now.According to convention, at the Peak of the Sixth Realm, the Bloody Lion was powerful enough to defeat human beings at Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. However, this was only the case with normal Human Warriors. Once it encountered Human Warriors who mastered excellent Martial Arts Techniques, not only could it not defeat them, it would be totally defeated by them. Jian Wushuang\u2019s swordsmanship could overwhelm the whole Sword Marquis Mansion, so killing a Bloody Lion was rather easy.Ignoring the Bloody Lion\u2019s corpse, Jian Wushuang stepped into the cave. It was deep, and its path was very narrow. However, when he went through the small entranceway, he found it was quite different from the outside.The interior of the cave was quite refined. There was a stone table, bench, and bed. It appeared that someone had once lived here. As he entered further into the cave, he found that the pond emitted a faint scent.The diameter of the pond was three meters or less. It belonged to a small creature. However, as soon as Jian Wushuang noticed the pond, his eyes were full of wild excitement.\u201cPrimordial Spiritual Liquid! \u201dJian Wushuang looked at the fragrant, and nearly transparent, water in the pond eagerly. He could feel the pure power contained in the water. There was no doubt this pond water truly was the invaluable Primordial Spiritual Liquid.The whole pond!\u2026Jian Wushuang jumped into the pond. The moment he entered the pond, he found that although it was not long in diameter, it was very deep, at least ten meters.\u201cSuch a large pond! All this water is Primordial Spiritual Liquid. I wonder how much there is? \u201d Jian Wushuang thought in excitement.Primordial Spiritual Liquid was the purest Spiritual Liquid. It contained almost no impurities. For Warriors following the Spirit Path, it was much stronger than Spirit-cultivating pills. Primordial Spiritual Liquid formed naturally, so very few people could use large quantities of it to improve their cultivation.But now there was a whole pond! If the water was divided into drops, how many would it be? What would the value be? No doubt it was very high!\u201cSir Bai Chong has given me such an amazing opportunity. \u201d Trembling slightly with anticipation, Jian Wushuang was extremely grateful.Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang began to cultivate in the pond.By cultivating in the pond, he could absorb the Primordial Spiritual Liquid surrounding him and turn it into Spiritual Power. For an ordinary warrior, it would take a considerable amount of time to absorb all the Primordial Spiritual Liquid in the pond, but Jian Wushuang was different.Heavenly Creation Skill greatly defied the natural order.The First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pill he\u2019d taken earlier contained such toxicity that it would take ordinary Warriors one or two months to absorb it. However, Jian Wushuang had completely absorbed the pill in just one night.It was the same with the Primordial Spiritual Liquid.As Jian Wushuang started to practice Heavenly Creation Skill, the power of his Cultivation Method immediately manifested itself. An overbearing power was erupting out from his body, forcefully absorbing everything nearby. The Primordial Spiritual Liquid in the pond was the first to be absorbed. It flooded into Jian Wushuang\u2019s pores at an amazing speed.It was like a huge black hole, consuming everything, crazy and overwhelming.How horrifying was the absorption speed! As Primordial Spiritual Liquid flooded into his body, it was changed into Spiritual Power, by using the Heavenly Creation Skill. With this process of absorption and change, the steadily increasing speed of his Spiritual Power could be regarded as terrifying!\u201cIt is too fast! The increase of my Spiritual Power is too fast and terrifying! \u201d Jian Wushuang was shocked at himself. His mind was muddled, and he could not believe it.Because the speed was too frightening.In fact, all this was natural.Primordial Spiritual Liquid combined with Heavenly Creation Skill, which defied the Heavens, was truly overwhelming and terrifying!Just like the First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pill he\u2019d taken before, for Warriors, Primordial Spiritual Liquid\u2019s function was much stronger than Spirit-cultivating pills. The pond\u2019s Primordial Spiritual Liquid was equal to ten First-class Spirit-Cultivating Pills.Therefore, the increasing speed of his Spiritual Power was naturally beyond imagination.In just half a day, Jian Wushuang found his Spiritual Power had reached Peak of the Sixth Heaven of Divine Path!It had only taken half a day. It seemed that the pond had not reduced much in Primordial Spiritual Liquid from this half-day of absorption.Over the next few days, Jian Wushuang focused fully on cultivating and didn\u2019t tell anyone about the terrifying improvement of his strength.Time seemed to pass slowly, yet twenty days went by in the blink of an eye.In the pond.The water level was decreasing. Jian Wushuang remained in the pond, as some Primordial Spiritual Liquid was still flowing into his body. Finally, as the last drop of Primordial Spiritual Liquid was absorbed, the huge pond had disappeared completely.Jian Wushuang, who had been indulging in his cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes. A terrifying flash burst out from his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All his muscles and joints crackled as he rose. He stretched and took a great leap to the entrance of the cave.Jian Wushuang looked at the wall of the mountain ahead of him with his sparkling eyes. A sudden clenching of his right hand made an explosive force burst out instantly from the mountain.BANG!The tremendous sound echoed through the cave. Jian Wushuang looked at the large hole in the wall in front of him. His eyes were bright.\u201cNot only did I reach the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path, I reached the Peak! \u201d Clenching his fists in excitement, he could feel the surging power contained in his hands.Jian Wushuang had spent 20 days cultivating in this cave, absorbing every drop of Primordial Spiritual Liquid from the pond.It had contained a huge quantity of pure Spiritual Power, which he had absorbed completely and transformed into Spiritual Power. As a result, his strength had improved to an amazing state.Not long ago he had been at the Sixth Heaven of Divine Path, close to the Peak. But today, a series of breakthroughs had brought him to the Seventh Heaven of Divine Path, then the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path. He had skyrocketed to the peak of the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path.It was an explosive breakthrough.But everything happened in a systematic manner.After all, not everyone had access to such a vast amount of Primordial Spiritual Liquid to help with his cultivation, let alone Heavenly Creation Skill, Heaven defying cultivation method. His marvelous breakthrough was attributed to the Primordial Spiritual Liquid and the Heavenly Creation Skill.The Eighth Heaven of Divine Path was equivalent to the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm for an ordinary Warrior. One who reached the Peak of the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path had the same power as one at the peak of the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm. So Spiritual Power operated with the strength advantage of Heavenly Creation Skill, could be equivalent to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. Perhaps it was slightly lower, but not by much.A stunning light burst out from Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er, I am gaining on you! \u201d Jian Wushuang roared.Jian Meng\u2019er had cultivated to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. Although he had not solidified his cultivation, he had his Heaven defying Heavenly Creation Skill, Spiritual Power, and so on.It meant that compared with Jian Meng\u2019er, he was almost as strong as her.He had only needed two months to catch up to her.\u201cTen days! There are still ten days before the battle. \u201d With his eyes squinting, Jian Wushuang thought, \u201cI should take my time. I have gained battle strength similar to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and have a great chance of defeating Jian Meng\u2019er in battle. However, I still need to prepare a certain trump card for myself, just in case. \u201dThinking about a trump card, the first thing that came to his mind was the secret skill recorded in Heavenly Creation Skill.Soul-Devouring Secret Skill!It was an extremely powerful secret skill that defied the Heavens.Along with Heavenly Creation Skill, he was deeply impressed with this secret skill. It was impossible to forget.When Jian Wushuang thought about this secret skill, he was shocked. It was so powerful that he thought it harmed natural harmony. Furthermore, it inflicted damage on the person who exercised it. Nobody was willing to use it unless it was really an emergency.It did not make sense to use such a secret skill as the trump card.\u201cSoul-Devouring Secret Skill contains three scrolls. In my present Realm, I can only try the first one, at most. I can\u2019t even consider the second and third one right now. \u201d With a smile, Jian Wushuang started studying this skill.It took him a total of five days.Five days later, Jian Wushuang was in the north rift of Nine-wolves Mountain, sitting cross-legged in a glade.\u201cLet\u2019s do it. \u201dHe took a deep breath and started practicing Soul-Devouring Secret Skill.He spent five days studying. He was able to grasp the first scroll of the skill, but it had taken a considerable amount of time to carry out. He knew well the harm the skill could cause him, so he was very careful when putting it to use. He didn\u2019t dare to be sloppy.\u201cThe secret skill, it devours one\u2019s soul\u2026 \u201dAs he cultivated the secret skill, there was a buzzing sound. It even shocked the Void. Jian Wushuang\u2019s body seemed like a giant black hole, into which there were constant peculiar forces flooding in at an amazing speed.These forces were so complex and diverse that Jian Wushuang had difficulty identifying them. But he found that with the infusion of these forces, his cultivation was booming.He had already been at the Eighth Heaven of Divine Path before, but this wild infusion of forces pushed his Cultivation to a higher Level. A single moment was enough to make a breakthrough from the Eighth Heaven.The Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path!His power continued to rise even after he reached the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path.Suddenly, there was a sharp surge of pain in his heart. It became more intense with the rise of his Cultivation.\u201cStop it, now. \u201d Jian Wushuang was clenching his teeth. His face was distorted. Feeling the sharp pain, he stopped the operation promptly.As soon as the secret skill stopped, his increasing Cultivation ceased. The pain began to weaken. Even so, the spasms in his body did not diminish right away.Lying on the glade, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes. He was gasping for breath and looked very weak. It was a long time before he opened his eyes.\u201cSoul-Devouring Secret Skill, it really is a secret skill that devours the soul? \u201d Jian Wushuang couldn\u2019t help shaking his head.It really hurt. It was harmful to practice this skill. He had spared some effort, because he didn\u2019t push his Cultivation to its full extent. However, he still felt extreme pain. If he had exercised it to the full degree, it would be more painful.\u201cThe Soul-Devouring Secret Skill really causes a surge in my Cultivation in a short time, but it hurts me even more, \u201d Jian Wushuang said to himself.It was one\u2019s Essence, Qi and Spirit, rather than their Spiritual Power, that the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill harmed.If it only consumed large quantities of Spiritual Power, he would not care at all. Heavenly Creation Skill, after all, helped him to recover Spiritual Power quickly. As for the Essence, Qi and Spirit, however, even Heavenly Creation Skill could make no difference.Jian Wushuang shook his head and looked up. He wore a weird expression.\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 \u201d Jian Wushuang stared at everything around him in amazement.He realized the earth within dozens of meters around him had become lifeless.The Earth, which had been dark green before, was now yellow and full of cracks. The flowers, grass, and trees were withering away. The ground with dozens of meters around him had died in the twinkling of an eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Further away from the circle the land was green and vibrant.It was at this exact moment that Jian Wushuang understood how the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill had been named, it devoured the soul.What was soul-devouring?The skill would take the soul of the earth, creatures, and nature.He understood what the strange and intricate power flowing into his body just now had been. It had been the natural power of the nearby creatures. The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill worked by taking the power of all living beings within reach and keeping them for his own use.\u201cThis skill really is horrible. Unless it is absolutely necessary, I will never use it again.\u201d JianWushuang warned himself.After this first taste, Jian Wushuang dared not to try it again. Instead, he continued to study the detailed steps of carrying out the skill. Three days later, Jian Wushuang was in the creek in the very middle of Nine-wolves Mountain. He cupped his hands to drink from the creek and then stood up.\u201cIt is the end of the month, and I am only two days away from the battle. It is time to go back now.\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at the endless sky above him. He smiled and jumped up into the air, then headed in the direction of Sword Marquis Mansion.\u2026In the early morning, dawn was just breaking.In Sword Marquis Mansion, when the first blush of the rising sun from the far horizon began to light the earth, everyone fell into an uproar. The disciples and tribesmen of the Mansion poured out from each building and gathered in the Drill Ground at the center of the Marquis\u2019s mansion.Each party and tribe of the whole Bashui Commandery, as well as those from Sword Marquis\u00a0Mansion, had dispatched their experts to Sword Marquis Mansion.Today, the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle was being held in the Mansion. Actually, the so-called Sword Marquis Token was only a title for the strongest person among the youth. An expert would grow up and eventually advance, so the Sword Marquis Mansion attached great importance to the cultivation of young disciples.Every year, Sword Marquis Mansion invited all the parties and tribes of the commandery to watch the Battle. Under normal circumstances, an invitation from Sword Marquis Mansion, the top most-recognized power in Bashui Commandery, would not be refused by any party. This year was no exception. The Sword Marquis Token\u00a0Battle was of special significance, especially this year.It was universally acknowledged in Bashui Commandery that there was a rare super genius in Sword Marquis Mansion. This super genius was only sixteen and had already reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. What\u2019s more, her swordsmanship was unfathomable. Such a young girl was going to take charge of the Sword Pavilion which enjoyed a significant position in the Mansion. Her deeds made every prominent persons in Bashui Commandery full of curiosity and expectation.And this exceptional genius was of course Jian Meng\u2019er, the God\u2019s chosen Daughter in the Sword Marquis Mansion.It was the perfect time for Jian Meng\u2019er to flex her muscle in front of all the experts and to shoot for fame. After today, the Sword Pavilion would officially be in Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s charge. She would be the one crowned in the Mansion.A great number of people had already swarmed into the wide Drill Ground. There were two platforms. One was used as the ring for disciples to show their strength, while the other one was the stands for the audience. Jian Xinhong, the current Sword Marquis Mansion Master, was seated in a chair, having a casual conversation with several great personages who sat by him.Since these people could sit side by side with the Mansion Master, one could infer that their background was not normal.\u201cLook! That must be Situ Qingyue, the Master of Tribe Situ.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Ye Xiu, the Master of Tribe Ye. Their family also focuses on swordsmanship. However, compared with our Sword Marquis Mansion, they are far worse.\u201d\u201cIt is unexpected that this Sir Bai Chong, the mysterious Supervisor of the Gladiator Arena would come.\u201dA lot of disciples of the Mansion were carefully discussing many things around the Drill Ground. They fixed their eyes on the stands from time to time to have a good look at these famous experts whom they seldom saw.The Situ and Ye tribes enjoyed a little less power and position than Sword Marquis Mansion, but the gap was narrow. As for the Gladiator Arena, it boasted great strength. In addition, the Arena held an aloof position and didn\u2019t participate in the conflicts. Even the Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong, was wary of Bai Chong.\u201cMr. Bai Chong, it is really a surprise that you have come to the Sword Marquis Token\u00a0Battle personally this year. In recent years, you often sent a gold-robed servant from the Gladiator Arena on your behalf,\u201d said Situ Qingyue, while wearing a smile.\u201cIt is a great honor for me and the Mansion, that Mr. Bai Chong has chosen to participate in this battle in person,\u201d said Jian Xinhong.\u201cThis battle is much different from those before. It is normal that I should come in person. I am also curious about this exceptional genius and want to see exactly how talented she is,\u201d Bai Chong replied with a smile.\u201cTrust me, she won\u2019t let you down.\u201d Jian Xinhong said and laughed, showing his confidence in JianMeng\u2019er.\u201cReally?\u201d BaiChong lifted his eyebrows. He laughed uncannily but didn\u2019t say anything more. Looking around the Drill Ground, he immediately noticed Jian Wushuang in a corner. He was leaning against the wall with his eyes closed. Bai Chong could not help smiling.\u201cThe little boy is so calm. I wonder whether his strength has improved since the journey through Nine-wolves Mountain.\u201dBai Chong was quite concerned for Jian Wushuang because of his friendship with Jian Nantian. He had provided Jian Wushuang with the opportunity to gain a whole pond of Primordial Spiritual Liquid. His consideration for Jian Wushuang could be seen from what he had done.He had come mostly because of Jian Wushuang.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time. Let\u2019s start,\u201d Jian Xinhong said on the platform.Jian Lan, who stood close to Jian Xinhong, nodded his head gently. Then he took a few steps and came to the very center of the platform. He cleared his throat and said, \u201d Attention! Would all of the disciples participating in this battle, please come up.\u201dAs the Great Elder of the Redly Martial Hall, Jian Lan was supposed to host the Sword Marquis Token Battle this time.There was a disturbance in the Drill Ground. The young disciples who had acquired their position in the battle by getting through the Fifth Level of the Trial Tower went to the center of the ground. They hustled and bustled. There were a good dozen young disciples at first sight, all of whom were geniuses in the Sword Marquis Mansion, including Jian Wushuang.At the same time, a beautiful white figure was walking slowly towards them.Suddenly, everyone on the Drill Ground gave their full attention to her. Not only the disciples on the Ground, even the personages on the platform turned their gaze to this white figure.As the God\u2019s chosen Daughter in Sword Marquis Mansion, disciples in the Mansion adored Jian Meng\u2019er as if she was a goddess. She was so beautiful, along with her cultivation and even her gift in Sword Principle. She had won great admiration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her every move attracted the attention of those around her.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er, 16, Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. She had already mastered the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of the Sword Pavilion. Based on her current speed, she\u2019ll likely reach the Gold Core realm before she turns 20!\u201cA 20-year-old, Gold Core Realm expert? My God!\u201dMany disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion near the Drill Ground couldn\u2019t help sighing with emotion when they saw this extraordinary beauty.The realms were ranked as such, the Seven Steps of the Spirit Path, Transforming Sea from Spiritual Power, and finally, Primordial Gold Core. The Primordial Gold Core realm was the strongest, and there was only one Gold Core Realm expert in Sword Marquis Mansion. He was the Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong.And what did a person who became an expert of the Golden Core Realm before the age of 20 represent?\u201cBlinding strength! She\u2019s such an exceptional genius that we can\u2019t even muster the slightest motivation to compete with her.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a peerless genius that can only be seen once in a lifetime in Sword Marquis Mansion. No wonder she has hopes of becoming the new Sword Pavilion Master at such a young age. No one can hold a candle to such an exceptional genius in the entire Bashui Commandery, never mind the Sword Marquis Mansion!\u201dEven those famous experts on the grandstand were staring at Jian Meng\u2019er with gleaming eyes. Nearly all were here for her, except for Bai Chong and a few others.The eye-catching and aloof girl made a beeline for Jian Wushuang, who stood amid the crowd. She spoke without emotion, \u201cJian Wushuang, I heard you\u2019ve finally condensed your Spiritual Power and became a Warrior. Congratulations.\u201dTurning his head, Jian Wushuang gave her a cold glance and said nothing.She wasn\u2019t angry. \u201cYou\u2019ve become a Warrior and even achieve a breakthrough into the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path in such a short time. That\u2019s admittedly terrific. But you can\u2019t hope to close the gap in our strength in just two months. I advise you not to challenge me today.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t challenge you?\u201d He sneered. \u201cThis battle is unavoidable ever since you and your father started coveting the position of Sword Pavilion Master two months ago.\u201d\u201cStubborn. But you\u2019ve always been this way.\u201d She was still indifferent. \u201cI know you bear resentment in your heart, but there\u2019s an unbridgeable gap between us. Why must you come and seek humiliation?\u201d\u201cSeek humiliation? You really do think very highly of yourself.\u201d\u201cHave it your way. You can\u2019t blame me later when you\u2019re the one not accepting my advice. I\u2019ll show you the full extent of my strength and snip that impossibly stupid idea you have in the bud,\u201d she said coolly.\u201cI\u2019ll be looking forward to it.\u201dJian Meng\u2019er ended the conversation and stood casually in the center of the Drill Ground. Though she was surrounded by many young geniuses of the Sword Marquis Mansion, they might as well be invisible compared to her. She was like a crane standing among chickens, attracting attention with every move she made.For example, everyone had noticed the brief conversation between her and Jian Wushuang.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er is talking to Jian Wushuang. What is she saying?\u201dEarlier, they spoke in very quiet voices. Coupled with the noise in the Drill Ground, no one except the talented disciples close to them heard their conversation. They became very curious about it.\u201cI heard that Jian Wushuang made a blood oath two months ago to battle it out with Jian Meng\u2019er today.\u201d\u201cI heard that too. This guy is really overreaching himself. How dare he challenge Jian Meng\u2019er? Who among us young disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion has the right to challenge this God\u2019s chosen Daughter? Jian Wushuang is just trash who condensed his Spiritual Power two months ago. How dare he?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true. He may have condensed his Spiritual Power very late, but he spent only a month to break through the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. His cultivating speed is unbelievable.\u201d\u201cSo what? He\u2019s merely at the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. A month has passed since then. Are you suggesting he has broken through the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path or the Spiritual Sea realm and is on par with Jian Meng\u2019er? What a joke!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dAll of them began looking down on him.On the Drill Ground, there was another person who was paying special attention to Jian Wushuang. It was Jian Lin.One month ago, Jian Wushuang defeated him, and badly at that. He had been harboring deep resentment since then and today was his chance to avenge himself.He held his hands firmly together, repeating Jian Wushuang\u2019s name in his mind.The young disciples who had passed the fifth story of the Trial Tower gathered in the middle of the Drill Ground. Just as Jian Lan was getting ready to announce the start of the battle, two people showed up nearby.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe famous experts on the grandstand noticed the newcomers immediately and instantly looked at them with sharp eyes. Even the languid Bai Chong couldn\u2019t help glancing at them.\u201cPrimordial Gold Core! Not only that, the Peak of the Gold Core Realm!\u201dThe famous experts were all awed.Those with Primordial Gold Cores were definitely top-notch experts in the Bashui Commandery. Everyone with the right to sit in the grandstand had all achieved that level, but most had only reached the Initial Gold Core Realm, with Jian Xinhong being stronger than most. But, although he had reached the Profound Gold Core Realm, he still had a long way to go before he would achieve the peak of the Gold Core realm.Among those present, there was only one who had the possibility of reaching the peak of the Gold Core realm. That was Bai Chong, and that was merely a possibility, not a certainty. He hardly ever fought with others, so no one knew about his true condition. Now, the leader of the two newcomers was evidently a Peak Gold Core realm expert.\u201cIt\u2019s her?\u201d Bai Chong was stunned, recognizing the newcomer.\u201cSir Bai Chong, you know her?\u201d Jian Xinhong promptly asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Chong nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s Shui Hanxin, the Ninth Elder of the Tianyuan Sword Sect. She reached the peak of the Gold Core realm 10 years ago.\u201d\u201cTianyuan Sword Sect?\u201d\u201cAnd an Elder at that!\u201dEveryone on the grandstand was shocked. They were all famous experts in the Bashui Commandery, with vast knowledge. They naturally knew about the Tianyuan Sword Sect.The Tianyuan Sword Sect was one of the five Sects in the Tianyan Province. It was said that there were quite a few experts in that sect who had reached the Yin-Yang Void Realm, and there were even more experts in the Gold Core realm. In the entire Tianyan Province, the sect was doubtlessly a strong influence and a true top Sect.These experts in the Bashui Commandery, even the most powerful, Sword Marquis Mansion, were nothing compared to the Tianyuan Sword Sect. After all, their commandery was only one out of the 108 commanderies in the Tianyan Province.An Elder of the Sect, no matter their identity or strength, was enough to incite awe in these famous experts. They began wondering why an Elder of the Tianyuan Sword Sect would come to Sword Marquis Mansion.Just then, Jian Lan who was also on the grandstand said proudly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone. Elder Shui is here especially for my daughter.\u201dThe famous experts looked stunned.In the middle of the Drill Ground, Jian Meng\u2019er, who had been drawing attention all along, was already walking toward the newcomers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Have you been well?\u201d Bai Chong\u2019s reply appeared to be rather stiff.\u201cHaha, the arrival of Elder Shui of the Tianyuan Sword Sect brings light to our humble Sword Marquis Mansion.\u201d Jian Xinhong stood up with a face full of smiles. The other famous experts on the grandstand followed his cue and made their greetings.They had to be humble in the face of the eminent status of an Elder of Tianyuan Sword Sect. Bai Chong\u2019s eyes flickered as he stared at Shui Hanxin. He was the only one who did not get up to greet her.\u201cYou\u2019re all too courteous,\u201d she said, smiling faintly. Then Shui Hanxin climbed onto the arena. A servant from Sword Marquis Mansion prepared a seat for her immediately. The grim-looking young man following Shui Hanxin chose to stand quietly by her side.\u201cElder Shui, is that girl your disciple?\u201d Bai Chong casually asked.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Shui Hanxin nodded. \u201cI accepted her as a personal disciple two years ago. This time, I\u2019m actually here to bring her back to cultivate in the Tianyuan Sword Sect.\u201d\u201cPersonal disciple?\u201d\u201cCultivate in Tianyuan Sword Sect?\u201dEveryone on the grandstand all sucked in a breath.It was the one and only Tianyuan Sword Sect! For Jian Meng\u2019er to enter such a Sect and be accepted as a personal disciple by an Elder, it only meant she was destined for a great future. Not to mention, it spoke volumes about her incredible talent!This raised an uproar on the Drill Ground.\u201cTianyuan Sword Sect!\u201d\u201cJian Meng\u2019er was accepted as a personal disciple by an Elder of the Tianyuan Sword Sect?\u201d\u201cTo begin with, she\u2019s already so strong. Now that she\u2019ll be cultivating in the Tianyuan Sword Sect, her future is a promising one!\u201d\u201cLooks like our Sword Marquis Mansion will be welcoming another expert very soon! She might even be stronger than the Mansion Master!\u201dNumerous eyes were fixed on Jian Meng\u2019er. She, who was already eye-catching in the first place, became even more dazzling under the attention.Before, her innate talent was already enough to make others despair. She was now even more perfect as the personal disciple of an Elder of the Tianyuan Sword Sect. No one would dare to question any of her future achievements.She was truly God\u2019s chosen Daughter.\u201cTianyuan Sword Sect?\u201d Jian Wushuang squinted but did not say anything else.On the grandstand, Jian Lan was in high spirits and said, \u201cLet\u2019s start our battle today!\u201dThe annual Sword Marquis Token Battle had begun.This battle was divided into two rounds. First, was Martial Arts Technique, followed by Cultivation of Spiritual Power.Of course, this battle was not meant to be a duel. It was enough as long as everyone demonstrated their strongest Martial Arts Technique and Cultivation of Spiritual Power.\u201cCome forward one by one according to the number you received in the lottery!\u201d Jian Lan shouted. \u201cFirst, Jian Lin!\u201dEveryone on the Drill Ground immediately focused their attention on Jian Lin.\u201cHuh. Jian Lin\u2019s the first one, while I\u2019m the last one.\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at the number 38 on his ticket from the lottery. There were exactly 38 youngsters taking part in this battle, so he was the last one.Under everyone\u2019s eyes, Jian Lin took a deep breath and slowly walked forward to the arena.\u201cShow us your strongest Martial Arts Technique, or what you\u2019re most skilled in,\u201d Jian Lan said.\u201cI understand.\u201d Jian Lin nodded and started to demonstrate his Martial Arts Technique.Roar!A Giant Tiger, entirely conjured from Spiritual Power, materialized in front of him, roaring loudly.Tiger-roaring Fist!It was Jian Lin\u2019s strongest, as well as most skilled, technique. Swift and violent, this move was also full of power and might.\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cWhat an overbearing punch! \u201dExclamations soon resounded around the Drill Ground.\u201cHmm, not bad. You can leave now,\u201d Jian Lan ordered, glancing at Jian Lin who had slowly returned to a neutral posture.Jian Lin nodded and slowly walked down from the arena under the eyes of everyone. He glanced at Jian Wushuang at the same time, feeling nervous after seeing his poker face.He was pretty happy with his performance today. But, he had used his Tiger-roaring Fist and still lost to Jian Wushuang a month ago. That experience had inevitably left him with some trauma.\u201cNext, Jian Qiu!\u201d\u2026The disciples all went up to the arena to demonstrate their best Martial Arts Techniques, one by one. Many of them chose to show off their swordsmanship. They were pretty good to have such levels in the Spirit Path, but it was difficult for them to leave an impression on the famous experts in the audience.\u201cNext, Jian Meng\u2019er!\u201dWhen Jian Lan read his daughter\u2019s name, he deliberately made his voice sound impassioned.Excitement immediately swept everyone on the Drill Ground, including the famous experts on the grandstand. They all fixed their gazes on her. They had high expectations for this chosen Daughter.Dressed in white, Jian Meng\u2019er walked up to the arena. She first bowed to those on the grandstand before beginning her swordsmanship demonstration.Whoosh!The unsheathing of her sword edge caused a piercing sword echo to resound through the Drill Ground. The sword echo carried a faint trace of Killing Intent, coming from the first-class killing sword, the Triple-kill Sword, from the Marquis\u2019s mansion.Swish!The waving sword light was so gentle that it gave the onlookers the feeling of drifting in the ocean.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 The Wave Superposition Sword Art!\u201dThe moment Jian Meng\u2019er demonstrated this Sword Art, everyone immediately recognized what it was.\u201cInteresting! Out of the Eighteen First-class Eighteen Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion, she chose this one. Looks like she\u2019s very confident,\u201d Bai Chong said, smiling.\u201cYou seem to understand this Sword Art very well,\u201d Shui Hinxin casually noted.\u201cJust barely,\u201d Bai Chong replied. \u201cIt\u2019s only a First-class Sword Art, but if you can utilize it to the end, its power can surpass that of First-class Sword Arts.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The rest of the people on the grandstand became interested.\u201cJian Xinhong, you\u2019re the Sword Marquis Mansion Master. You should be the one most familiar with this Sword Art. Why don\u2019t you explain it?\u201d Bai Chong threw the responsibility of answering to Jian Xinhong.\u201cHaha! Mr. Bai Chong, you\u2019re right.\u201d Jian Xinhong immediately gave his explanation. \u201cThough this kind of Sword Art is just one of the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion, it\u2019s quite a special one. If you show the Sword Art in its entirety, its power is no less than those legendary super-class Sword Arts.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called the Wave Superposition Sword Art because the user can accumulate the power of the Sword Art as they continue to use it. There\u2019s actually only one true movement to this Sword Art, and that\u2019s the splitting technique. It\u2019s very simple, just splitting.\u201d\u201cBut the splitting process will pile up. The power superimposes on one another and ends up becoming greater. This way, the Sword Art naturally becomes more powerful and finally surpasses the level of First-class Sword Arts.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Situ Qingyue continued, \u201cThis kind of Sword Art requires a strict application of power.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jian Xinhong nodded. \u201cThe Wave Superposition Swords Art needs to constantly store power, so it can be even stronger. Under normal circumstances, if the power can be overlapped seven times, that is, if the user can demonstrate seven moves, the Sword Art will have reached the Profound level.\u201d\u201cThis Sword Art requires seven moves to reach the Profound level. Let\u2019s see how many moves this exceptional genius from Sword Marquis Mansion can perform.\u201d Situ Qingyue smiled.Everyone was looking forward to her performance.On the arena, Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s swordsmanship was incredibly smooth, stacking wave after wave. She made her first sword move without an ounce of hesitation.The second, third, and fourth moves were also instantaneous.The fifth, sixth, and seventh quickly followed!The process was smooth without any pause.The spectators could clearly see the power of Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s Sword Art become stronger and stronger. That was the result of the power superposing on one another. However, when it came to her seventh sword move,\u00a0there was no uproar in the Drill Ground.To use seven moves, achieving the Profound level in the Wave Superposition Sword Art, was nothing impressive.However, after the seventh sword move, she adjusted her wrist.\u201cHa!\u201dWith a cry, she demonstrated the eighth sword move.The Sword Art had been superposed eight times and its power had exceeded the limits of First-class Sword Arts.\u201cIt\u2019s the Eighth sword move!\u201dExclamations resounded throughout the Drill Ground.Seven moves would lead to the Profound level of the Wave Superposition Swords Art, while the Eighth move meant the Sword Art reached the Exceptional level!\u201cShe\u2019s still not done yet,\u201d Jian Xinhong said excitedly on the grandstand.Sure enough, Jian Meng\u2019er did not stop after making her eighth sword move. She was still accumulating power.\u201cIs she going to try for the ninth sword move?\u201dUnder everyone\u2019s anticipation, the lovely girl in white wore a solemn expression. She moved her wrist, allowing power to accumulate to an ultimate level. An unexpected dazzling light flashed in her beautiful eyes.Whoosh!She dealt an aggressive split, directly cutting into the air.The ninth move of the Wave Superposition Sword Art was a success!Jian Meng\u2019er finally felt at ease after completing this. She sheathed her sword and stood in place.A commotion broke out on the Drill Ground.\u201cThe ninth sword move! She actually did it!\u201d Jian Xinhong stared at Jian Meng\u2019er intensely and said, \u201cIn the first place, the Wave Superposition Sword Art is the highest technique among the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion. Seven moves are enough for the Profound level, what more the ninth move! This girl is still so young but she\u2019s capable of demonstrating the Sword Art to this level!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s truly rare.\u201d Situ Qingyue, Ye Xiu, and a few people agreed with this comment. After they learned the mystery of the Wave Superposition Sword Art, they immediately understood the difficulties of accumulating the power by nine fold. Yet Jian Meng\u2019er, a mere 16-year-old young girl, had accomplished this feat.\u201cShui Hanxin, looks like you\u2019ve taken in a talented disciple. The girl\u2019s talent for cultivation is already incredible, but it looks like her gift in Sword Principle isn\u2019t below any of the peerless talents in your Sect,\u201d said Bai Chong, glancing at Shui Hanxin.\u201cSince she\u2019s my disciple, she\u2019ll naturally be extraordinary,\u201d Shui Hanxin replied calmly.On the grandstand, Jian Lan looked increasingly smug as he listened in on the conversations between the famous experts.\u201cMeng\u2019er, you may leave,\u201d he ordered.\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er bowed lightly towards the grandstand and left the arena under everyone\u2019s attention. On her way down, her glance inevitably went to Jian Wushaung who was standing at the edge of the Drill Ground.\u201cJian Wushuang, you demonstrated the ninth sword move when you taught me the Wave Superposition Sword Art! I can do it as well as you now!\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s glance carried a hint of pride.Unlike the other Marquis mansion disciples, Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression was still without any change when he saw her perform the ninth sword move. It seemed that, in his eyes, her ninth move was just so-so.\u201cNext, Jian Ying!\u201dThe battle continued, but Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s performance was simply too brilliant. She had completely overshadowed the rest.\u201cThe last one, Jian Wushuang!\u201dIt was finally Jian Wushuang\u2019s turn.When they heard his name, many disciples on the Drill Ground immediately wore odd expressions.Jian Wushuang was the infamous trash of Sword Marquis Mansion. But he had formed his Spiritual Power two months ago and gained victory against Jian Lin, giving others a new impression of him. However, when they heard that he challenged Jian Meng\u2019er two months ago to a duel today, everyone thought he was an overreaching idiot.Now, it was this idiot\u2019s turn.Ignoring the attention, Jian Wushuang slowly stepped on the arena.\u201cJian Wushuang.\u201d The way Jian Lan glanced at him was clearly different than how he looked at other disciples.\u201cShow us your strongest martial arts or what you\u2019re most skilled in,\u201d Jian Lan said, his voice somewhat colder.Jian Wushuang prepared his sword, but his gaze was focused on the grandstand right ahead.On the grandstand, those famous experts took little notice of him and were still chattering on about Jian Meng\u2019er. Only the leisurely Bai Chong smiled at him.Jian Wushuang nodded at him and unsheathed his Long Sword.Whoosh!The sword light was like the tide, surging forward with great momentum. It made everyone feel as if they had been submerged in the sea, yet carried a deeper meaning at the same time.\u201cAh?\u201dOnce Jian Wushuang demonstrated his swordsmanship, everyone on the Drill Ground was surprised. Even the famous experts in the grandstand were amazed.\u201cWave Superposition Sword Art?\u201d\u201cThis little boy is also performing the Wave Superposition Sword Art?\u201d Situ Qingyue laughed happily.\u201cIt\u2019s the same Sword Art as Jian Meng\u2019er. But since hers was too dazzling earlier, this boy wouldn\u2019t impress us even if he does as well as her. It doesn\u2019t matter even if he performs the Seventh or Eighth move,\u201d Ye Xiu said, laughing.\u201cThat may not be true,\u201d Bai Chong suddenly spoke up.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Situ Qingyue and Ye Xiu asked.\u201cIf Jian Meng\u2019er can demonstrate the Ninth sword move, reaching great heights in the Wave Superposition Sword Art, do you think the genius who imparted the Sword Art to her will be worse off?\u201d Bai Chong replied.\u201cWhat?\u201d Everyone in the stands was shocked.\u201cMr. Bai Chong, are you saying that little boy taught Jian Meng\u2019er the Wave Superposition Sword Art? Can he also perform the Ninth sword move?\u201d Situ Qingyue asked, having connected the dots.\u201cI don\u2019t know how good he is. Let\u2019s just watch and see,\u201d Bai Chong replied perfunctorily, not saying much.The curiosity of these famous experts in the stands had been piqued, so they immediately concentrated their attention on Jian Wushuang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But one of them was a dazzling and peerless genius and the other was the one who challenged that talent two months ago. It felt like a subtle provocation for Jian Wushuang to perform the same Sword Art.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er had already pushed this Sword Art to its greatest height. Isn\u2019t Jian Wushuang asking for trouble by performing it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not for sure. Don\u2019t forget it was Jian Wushuang who taught Jian Meng\u2019er this Sword Art.\u201d\u201cSo what? Jian Meng\u2019er demonstrated the Ninth sword move. Even if Jian Wushuang can do the same, what can he prove? What\u2019s the point to his provocation?\u201dAll eyes were on Jian Wushuang who was standing on the arena. Many were wearing sneers on their faces. A small part of the disciples in Sword Pavilion wanted to argue for him, but those arguments seemed so weak in front of the Jian Meng\u2019er who had performed the Ninth move of this Sword Art.Jian Wushuang ignored everyone else. He had long focused all his attention on performing this Sword Art.Wave Superposition Sword Art was a constant accumulation of power, stacked one over the other, requiring mastery of the most basic sword techniques.The sword light emerged like a tide. There was no hesitation in Jian Wushuang\u2019s movements as he performed the first Seven sword moves under everyone\u2019s eyes. The sound of the sword slicing the air reverberated with each move.His moves were still smooth after the Seventh one and much more coordinated compared to Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s.The Eighth sword move followed the seventh.\u201cIt\u2019s the Eighth sword move!\u201dPeople on the Drill Ground looked at him with earnest attention. But Jian Wushuang did not stop after the Eighth sword move and everyone realized he was attempting the Ninth sword move.But the Ninth move was the peak level of this Sword Art. Would he be able to do it?Just as the curiosity of the spectators was roused, he was already ready to make his move in the next moment. In an instant, he made another sword move.The Ninth sword move! He still demonstrated it naturally and smoothly.Exclamations rang all over the Drill Ground.\u201cHaha! As expected, Bai Chong was right on the mark. This little boy actually managed to perform the Ninth sword move, and he did it even more smoothly than Jian Meng\u2019er. His talent for Sword Principle is no less than hers,\u201d Situ Qingyue said, smiling.The other famous experts in the grandstand nodded to show their agreements.\u201cDon\u2019t make your assumptions too soon. It\u2019s still too early to decide,\u201d said Bai Chong, wearing a mysterious smile.Everyone was stunned and instantly turned towards the arena. Instead of sheathing his blade, Jian Wushuang who had completed the Ninth sword move continued to wield his sword.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Drill Ground fell into silence just then.He had already completed the Ninth sword move and had theoretically reached the limit. Yet he did not sheathe his blade. What did he want to do?\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, he\u2019s attempting the Tenth move?\u201dWith someone speaking, the whole Drill Ground burst into exclamations in an instant.\u201cThe Tenth sword move! He\u2019s going to perform the Tenth sword move!\u201d\u201cIs there be a Tenth move in the Wave Superposition Sword Art?\u201dEveryone was stunned. That included Jian Meng\u2019er, whose beautiful eyes were staring at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.Jian Wushuang was indeed continuing this Sword Art, power superposed on one another. When it finally reached a certain degree, his face turned steely and he stepped forward to make another sword move without any hesitation.The Tenth move!Swish! His Sword Edge cut through the air, making an ear-splitting explosion. The power of the Tenth sword move was evidently far stronger than the Ninth sword move.A furor swept the Drill Ground.\u201cBravo!\u201d Situ Qingyue suddenly stood up, his eyes flashing with excitement.\u201cJian Xinhong, your Sword Marquis Mansion really has so many talents! We don\u2019t even have to talk about Jian Meng\u2019er. She\u2019s an amazing genius. And you have this boy who has superposed the power ten times and performed the Tenth Sword. His talent in Sword Principle is pretty terrifying!\u201d Ye Xiu looked at Jian Xinhong, his words carrying a deeper meaning.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Jian Xinhong was pretty shocked himself. He did not know how he should respond.\u201cJian Xinhong, didn\u2019t you just say the highest level of this Sword Art was the Ninth move? What about the Tenth move?\u201d Situ Qingyue asked.Jian Xinhong took a deep breath and said solemnly, \u201cIndeed, the highest level of the Wave Superposition Sword Art is the Ninth move. The Tenth move is at the supreme level. However, it\u2019s too hard to perform it. Since the time Sword Marquis Mansion obtained this Sword Art, there has only been one person who could perform the Tenth move. That was Jian Nantian, the previous Sword Pavilion Master. And this boy\u2026 is his son.\u201d\u201cJian Nantian\u2019s son?\u201d Situ Qingyue was frozen in shock. Instantly, the famous experts in the grandstand began to look at Jian Wushuang differently.\u201cThe Tenth move. I just knew the boy wouldn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d A smile came over Bai Chong\u2019s face but disappeared just as quickly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Bai Chong blurted out in surprise.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Everyone in the grandstand was astonished.Jian Wushuang, whose performance of the Tenth move had left everyone astounded, was not done yet. His sword light began to flutter, ready to accumulate power.He was going to attempt the Eleventh move!\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Even Jian Xinhong could not help standing up, eyes gleaming with horror.\u201cThis boy is mad! He\u2019s mad!\u201d Under the arena, Jian Lan was shouting again and again.\u201cThe Eleventh move?\u201d Bai Chong and the rest in grandstand stood up with surprise. Even the high and lofty Shui Hanxin was stunned and, for the first time, looking at him approvingly.The Drill Ground sank into a deadly silence.Everyone\u2019s eyes were concentrated on Jian Wushuang.He did not pay mind to their attention and closed his eyes, recalling everything his father told him when he taught him this Sword Art.\u201cShuang, remember that there\u2019s no such thing as the supreme level to any Sword Art. If the Tenth move is the supreme level of the Wave Superposition Sword Art, all you need to do is to transcend the supreme level!\u201dSwish!The ruthless sword light emerged with fury.This sword move seemed capable of splitting the world into two.On the arena, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes. A faint smile appeared on his face.\u201cI have transcended the supreme level!\u201d\u201cFather, I\u2019ve done it!\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, there was not a single person his age capable of doing that, even in her sect.That meant his talent for Sword Principle was unrivaled by even those in her sect.\u201cThis young man!\u201d The Sword Marquis Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong, rose and stared intensely at Jian Wushuang. \u201cI\u2019m the Mansion Master, but I didn\u2019t know his gift in Sword Principle had become this great.\u201dSitu Qingyue and the others beside him were beyond shocked.\u201cHumph!\u201dThe organizer of the battle, Jian Lan, snorted and turned around to face the famous experts. \u201cPerhaps you all don\u2019t know this. Though Jian Wushuang\u2019s talent in Sword Principle is Heaven defying, he\u2019s trash that can\u2019t even gather Spiritual Power. Without a corresponding Cultivation of Spiritual Power, what use is his excellent swordsmanship?\u201d\u201cOh? You mean the boy can\u2019t gather Spiritual Power?\u201d asked Situ Qingyue and several people, their expressions turning odd.\u201cThat\u2019s right. In Sword Marquis Mansion, everyone knows Jian Wushuang is trash who has been unable to gather Spiritual Power since he was 12. Even though he succeeded and became a Warrior at last, Jian Wushuang lost the golden four years for a Warrior to lay a solid foundation. So, learning about this, what accomplishments do you think he can achieve in the future?\u201d sneered Jian Lan.\u201cIs this true?\u201d\u201cHe just formed his Spiritual Power two months ago?\u201d\u201cWhat a pity!\u201dSitu Qingyue and several excellent famous experts shook their heads and sighed.In the Way of Martial Arts, the years from 12 to 16 were the most crucial stage, being the years of puberty. It was the best time to lay a solid foundation for cultivation. Once a person missed this golden stage, his achievements in the future would be limited.Of course, this was only applicable to ordinary practitioners, not for defiant cultivators who have cultivated a Deviant Cultivation like Heavenly Creation Skill.\u201cSpiritual Power is the foundation of the Way of Martial Arts, while Martial Arts Technique and swordsmanship are external factors. Even if he has excellent swordsmanship, he can\u2019t achieve much with weak Cultivation of Spiritual Power. What a pity for this boy!\u201d Shui Hanxin glanced Jian Wushuang and shook her head. \u201cEven with ordinary cultivation, he has the right to be one of our disciples like Jian Meng\u2019er with his gift in Sword Principle. Yet the fact is, he has missed the best time for his cultivation. He has basically no chance of breaking through the Spiritual Sea Realm. He doesn\u2019t have the qualification to be an expert.\u201dSeveral famous experts beside her nodded.Though Shui Hanxin\u2019s explanation was half-hearted and sloppy, she was right.They could only shake their heads and sigh, feeling sorry for a wasted talent in Sword Principle.On the Drill Ground, many disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion had also recovered from the shock and were sighing before long.Jian Wushuang\u2019s unparalleled gift in Sword Principle had given everyone present a shock. But what could it prove?In the world where everyone bowed down to Warriors, Cultivation of Spiritual Power was the foundation.\u201cThe Eleventh Move.\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er fixed a cold glare at the lonely figure descending down the arena. She had long known about Jian Wushuang\u2019s gift in Sword Principle. After her use of the Ninth Move of the Wave Superposition Sword Art, she thought she had finally surpassed him, even if it was just by a hair, but the gap between them was still huge. Either way, the Cultivation of Spiritual Power formed the foundation of the Way of Martial Arts. She vowed to crush his confidence in the second round of the battle.On the grandstand, Jian Lan commented, \u201cCultivation of Spiritual Power is the foundation to cultivating Martial Arts. Our disciples shouldn\u2019t neglect the Cultivation of Spiritual Power for Martial Arts Technique. That\u2019s simply a fool\u2019s way.\u201dJian Lan\u2019s words resounded throughout the Drill Ground. It was obviously meant for Jian Wushuang.\u201cWe\u2019ll start the second round of the battle next! This round tests your Cultivation of Spiritual Power. Please place the Spiritual Power gem here!\u201dSomeone lifted a huge transparent gem, placing it on the arena. The middle of the gem was divided into ten layers of microgrooves.The Spiritual Power Gem was used to test Cultivation of Spiritual Power, with ten layers representing the ten Levels from the First Step of the Spirit Path, up to the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cFirst, Jian Lin!\u201dJian Lin remained the first participant.\u201cDo your best to instill your Spiritual Power in the Spiritual Power Gem!\u201d Jian Lan said.\u201cYes.\u201d Jianlin nodded, took a deep breath, and put out his palms, displaying his ability. Soon, a cluster of Spiritual Power flowed into the Spiritual Power Gem.With the infusion of Spiritual Power, a bright light surged from the Spiritual Power Gem.A dazzling violet light surged from the bottom to the top of the ten layers of the gem, putting his Cultivation of Spiritual Power at the peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. It did not end there. A fleck of violet light lit the seventh layer. The light was still dim, but the layer was still lit.\u201cThe seventh layer was lit up?\u201d\u201cThe Seventh Step of the Spirit Path!\u201d\u201cJian Lin finally broke through the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path after so long!\u201dPeople on the Drill Ground praised him and many of them looked at Jian Lin with envy.When he withdrew his palms, Jian Lin noticed the attention on him. His mood turned better. He had been mortified ever since he was defeated by Jian Wushuang a month ago, but he had now finally recovered some of his dignity.\u201cSo what if Jian Wushuang has an excellent gift in Sword Principle? He\u2019s probably still in the Sixth Step now.\u201d Jian Lin sneered at Jian Wushuang and stared at him provocatively.But when he saw Jian Wushuang, his anger flared up.\u201cThis bastard dares ignore me!\u201d Jian Lin raged.\u00a0He saw how Jian Wushuang had his eyes closed as he leaned against the wall the whole time. His attitude naturally irritated Jian Lin.What he did not know was that Jian Wushuang had never concerned himself with him since the very beginning.Jian Wushuang had never cared about him, not back then and certainly not now.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Though Jian Wushuang\u2019s performance had suppressed hers, it was not enough to overshadow her brilliance. What truly impressed everyone was her Heaven defying talent for cultivation.She was a mere 16-year-old girl who had achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm!This was something unprecedented in the history of Sword Marquis Mansion. Next, the Detection of Spiritual Power would be the perfect opportunity for her to showcase her peerless talent.On the arena, Jian Meng\u2019er inched her palms closer to the Spiritual Power Gem, gently touching it.Everyone held their breath.\u201cHas she really achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm?\u201dThose famous experts from various spheres of influence were watching with earnest attention. Though they had heard that Jian Meng\u2019er had such an achievement, this time they would be able to witness it themselves.They would only dare to believe it if they saw it with their own eyes.A harsh violent light lit within the ten-layered Spiritual Power Gem. The light filled the seventh layer without any suspense, then the eighth layer lit up as well.The eighth layer represented the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm. It still lit up with that dazzling violet light like the rest of the layers. Then came the ninth layer\u2026It lit up as expected, the light just as brilliant.There were distinctions within the different layers of the Spiritual Power Gem, and they were determined by the brightness of the violet light.Take the previous contestant, Jian Lin, as an example. When he reached the Seventh Step of Spirit Path, he managed to light up the seventh layer of the Spiritual Power Gem. However, it was very dim as he was still new to the realm.But now, through the infusion of Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s Spiritual Power, the ninth layer had lit up with the most brilliant of lights. What did this mean?\u201cThe Peak! The Peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm!\u201d\u201cShe has already achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and she is not just a newcomer to it?!\u201dAll of a sudden, the Drill Ground was in an uproar.\u201cGood! Very good!\u201d On the grandstand, Jian Xinhong rose to his feet and applauded, excitement evident in his eyes.Jian Lan laughed heartily, unable to conceal his joy.\u201cShe not only achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, but even its Peak?!\u201d Everyone else on the grandstand also looked exceptionally amazed.Their amazement was because, even within the same level, there was a tremendous difference between the early stages and the Peak of it.It would take an ordinary Warrior at least several years to accumulate enough Spiritual Power to achieve the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. For some, it may take even longer. Yet Jian Meng\u2019er was only 16 years old!It was already unbelievable enough that she had achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm at that age, never mind reaching the Peak!Everyone felt like they were in a daze.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er\u2026\u201dOn the Drill Ground, numerous disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion were staring at the peerless and beautiful person on the platform. Besides Jian Wushuang, none of them had any desire to compete against her.The chosen one!The most beautiful one!It was none other than Jian Meng\u2019er!Bai Chong squinted and said, \u201cShui Hanxin, you\u2019ve really accepted a great disciple! For her to achieve the Peak at 16 years old, she really has an extraordinary talent for cultivation.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not bad.\u201d Shui Hanxin nodded, smiling. \u201cThis girl does have an extraordinary talent for cultivation. Even among the many talented disciples in my Tianyuan Sword Sect, she\u2019s among the best. With my guidance, it won\u2019t be a problem for her to achieve Gold Core before turning 20. If she\u2019s willing to work hard and has good luck, perhaps another peak existence will come out of my sect!\u201d\u201cA peak existence?!\u201d Everyone was stunned.\u201cElder Shui, are you saying that Jian Meng\u2019er will be able to achieve the Yin-Yang Void Realm in the future?\u201d Jian Xinhong seemed somewhat excited.No one doubted that Jian Meng\u2019er was capable of forming a Gold Core before turning 20. However, the Yin-Yang Void Realm was truly the Peak of cultivation. Even among the powerful Tianyuan Sword Sect, there was only a handful who had achieved it. Within Bashui Commandery, there was not even one!Was there any hope for Jian Meng\u2019er to achieve it in the future?\u201cWith her talent, nothing is impossible as long as she\u2019s willing to work hard,\u201d Shui Hanxin replied placidly.Though she sounded indifferent, it was difficult for the audience to calm themselves down.On the arena, Jian Meng\u2019er was being watched by everyone, but her eyes were directed at Jian Wushuang. Her gaze turned chilly and she said to him, \u201cJian Wushuang, I\u2019ve warned you. I\u2019ll let you feel complete devastation in this battle today! You\u2019re not qualified to surpass me in your entire life!\u201d\u201cCan you see it now?\u201dLeaning on the corner, Jian Wushuang raised his head with his hands folded. His eyes turned as acute as electricity when they met Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s.Though no actual conversation took place, he could understand what she wanted to say through her eyes.\u201cThe Peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? Very good! Things will be more interesting this way.\u201d He touched his parched lips, his eyes darkening as a fire raged within him.The battle continued, yet compared to Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s results, the Cultivation of Spiritual Power of the other disciples seemed even dimmer than a firefly\u2019s light.\u201cThe last one, Jian Wushuang. It\u2019s your turn!\u201d Jian Lan called, voice cold.Leaning on the corner, Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes and slowly made his ways towards the arena.His steps were slow as he put his foot one after another, attracting everyone\u2019s attention.All eyes were on him, including the famous experts.The most eye-grabbing people in this battle were doubtlessly Jian Meng\u2019er and him.In the first round of the battle earlier, Jian Wushuang shocked everyone with the Eleventh Move of the Wave Superposition Sword Art. Though no one had any expectations for him in this second round, no one dared to belittle him anymore at the very least.\u201cHe\u2019s up on the arena?\u201dWatching Jian Wushuang walk towards the platform, a smile appeared on Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s face. \u201cYou achieved the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path a month ago. Now let\u2019s see how much progress you\u2019ve made!\u201d\u201cShow me what you\u2019ve achieved during these so-called two months!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I wonder if\u2026 he has reached the Seventh Step yet.\u201d\u201cAchieving the Seventh Step in a month? Ridiculous!\u201d\u201cThe way I see it, he\u2019s probably still at the Peak of the Sixth Step. Though his Cultivation is considered decent even among us disciples here, he\u2019s still far beneath Jian Meng\u2019er.\u201d\u201cIf he challenges her without achieving the Seventh Step, then he\u2019s a fool. Even if he\u2019s somehow lucky enough to achieve it, challenging her who has achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm is just bringing disgrace on his own head.\u201dThe other disciples started discussing among themselves in whispers.Jian Wushuang eventually stopped in front of the Spiritual Power Gem in the arena. Looking at it, he took a deep breath.\u201cTwo months worth of earnest cultivation\u2026\u201d He recalled the past two months where he dared not even spend a minute relaxing.He stayed in the Cultivating Room and endured the massive pressure, continuously turning the torment into something he could be proud of.In the Gladiator Arena, he risked his life to join the challenge so he could get his hands on all the First-class Spirit-Cultivating pills he needed.In Nine-wolves Mountain, he fought against the Bloody Lion and absorbed a whole pool of Primordial Spiritual Liquid.He had spent two months frantically cultivating and now it was time to show them all his hard work.\u201cEveryone looks down on me. They all think I\u2019m overreaching to challenge Jian Meng\u2019er. In that case, you all better open your eyes wide and watch carefully.\u201d With a heat gleamed in his eyes, he touched the Spiritual Power Gem with his hands. Using Heavenly Creation Skill, the Spiritual Power began to pour out from within.Buzz\u2026A dazzling violet light emerged from the Spiritual Power Gem almost instantaneously.The sixth level of the ten-layered Spiritual Power Gem lit up after Jian Wushuang\u2019s Spiritual Power flowed into it. The same brilliant light marked the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path.\u201cThe seventh layer lit up!\u201d\u201cThe Seventh Step of the Spirit Path?\u201d\u201cHe actually achieved it?\u201dCries of surprises resounded throughout the Drill Ground. Amidst the crowd was Jian Lin, who had gone pale. This time, he had reached the Seventh Step of the Spirit Path as well and thought he had finally caught up to Jian Wushuang\u2026The constant flow of Jian Wushuang\u2019s Spiritual Power sparked the violet light that filled the seventh layer of the Spiritual Power Gem, which was truly glaring!And it was still going.After the seventh layer, the violet light instantly lit up the eighth.\u201cThe eighth level?\u201d Jian Lin\u2019s eyes widened in shock.The eighth layer represented the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm. The bright violet light was still going, inching towards the ninth layer.\u201cIt\u2019s just as I thought. The Spiritual Power Gem tests the Cultivation of Spiritual Power based on its force. Though I haven\u2019t achieved the Spiritual Sea Realm yet, I\u2019ve reached the Peak Eighth Heaven of the Divine Path in the Heavenly Creation Skill. That\u2019s equivalent to the Peak of the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm. The strength of the Heavenly Creation Skill is far stronger than the similar ones. And the ninth level\u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s gaze turned sharp and he shouted,\u201cLight it up!\u201dBuzz\u2026Light abruptly filled the ninth layer of the Spiritual Power Gem.That meant the layer that represented the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm was lit!\u201cImpossible!\u201dOn the arena, Jian Lan was the first to make noise. There was no trace of any smugness on his face, only a distorted expression that looked almost mad.\u201cJian Lan, earlier you said this boy hadn\u2019t even gathered his Spiritual Power two months ago?\u201d said Situ Qingyue, looking directly at him.\u201cI-I\u2026.\u201d Jian Lan could not find any words to retort.\u201cThe ninth layer? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d Jian Xinhong\u2019s eyes were round.\u201cThe Profound Spiritual Sea Realm!\u201d\u201cHe actually achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d\u201cIt must be a lie! A lie! It\u2019s completely impossible. Two months ago, he couldn\u2019t even gather Spiritual Power!\u201dEveryone had gone mad!The whole Drill Ground had completely gone mad!\u201cThe ninth level?\u201dThere was finally a change in Jian Meng\u2019er arrogant expression that she had maintained on her beautiful face since the beginning of the competition. An unprecedented fearful expression crept onto her face.Fright!Yes, even Jian Meng\u2019er was shocked!She was a peerless genius who had started her cultivation at the age of 12. Four years since then, she had achieved the Peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. Her achievement was remarkable. How could Jian Wushuang compare?Everyone knew Jian Wushuang was once trash who could not even gather Spiritual Power.Everyone knew he was just an ordinary man without a trace of Spiritual Power two months ago.Everyone thought him wanting to challenge her today was the world\u2019s biggest joke.But now, who dared to laugh at him whose Spiritual Power Gem had lit up the ninth layer, representing the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm?Who dared to say Jian Wushuang did not qualify to challenge her?If people had found Jian Wushuang lamentable after he had surprisingly pulled off the Eleventh Move of the Wave Superposition Sword Art in the first round, then the Cultivation of Spiritual Power he had just presented was truly shocking!\u201cGenius!\u201d\u201cMonster!\u201dThese two words inevitably appeared in everyone\u2019s minds.Jian Meng\u2019er started cultivating at 12 and achieved the Peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm at merely 16. She could already be considered a peerless talent. Yet Jian Wushuang had only spent two months to go from an ordinary person to someone in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. What was he if not a Monster?And just then, the person who everyone regarded as a Monster had slowly withdrawn his palm. With his dark pupils, he swept everyone with his gaze, carrying a hint of disdain.Standing high up on the arena, Jian Wushuang looked down upon the disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion. Each of them who met his eyes could not help bowing their heads.On the entire Drill Ground, there was only one person who dared to meet his gaze, all while carrying a trace of stubbornness.It was Jian Meng\u2019er.Jian Wushuang\u2019s gaze finally landed on her. There was no need for any words. In that moment, their burning battle intent to fight had risen to the surface.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er, get the f*ck up here!\u201dHis cold growl was akin to a thunderbolt, resonating through heaven and earth.The entire Drill Ground instantly became ablaze with excitement.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was an intense feeling of confrontation that you do not sense any other time.The Long Sword on Jian Wushuang\u2019s back was removed from the sheath and a vibration of sword essence like the rolling tide radiated from it. As the cold Sword Edge directly pointed at Jian Meng\u2019er, without the slightest trace of emotion, Jian Wushuang coldly said, \u201cAs I said two months ago, I have come to find you today! The fight between us is inevitable. It had to come to an end.\u201dJian Meng\u2019er\u2019s face was stone cold as she stood there with her snow-white robe blowing. The power of her peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm was completely released.\u201cJian Wushuang, I don\u2019t know how you increased your strength in just two months. Anyway, I still believe that the winner takes all. Since you are so desperate to fight with me, then bring it on!\u201dThe brief talk led the atmosphere to an elevated level immediately.\u201cOh, I see.\u201dThere was an uproar of excitement and expectation rising in the area around the Drill Ground. It seemed that the disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion were on the brink of madness, waiting to witness how things would unfold.This would be an eye-catching duel! What an exciting turn of events!\u201cIt was universally acknowledged that a 16-year-old teenager, considered to be a super genius, top of the list, had reached the peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. The other one who was buried in oblivion, amazed people with their Spiritual Power, on par with the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, which was acquired within two months.\u00a0The battle between them\u2026\u201d Even those famous experts among the audience were looking forward to watching the fight between them.It was the Summit Battle between two talents!In fact, the people who lived in Sword Marquis Mansion thought Jian Wushuang\u2019s challenge to Jian Meng\u2019er was a joke and brought disgrace on his own head. Now, after two rounds of battle, no one dared to say it was wishful thinking.According to the Sword Principle, someone who cultivated the Wave Superposition Sword Art to the Eleventh Move was definitely a genius.According to the Cultivation of Spiritual Power, he lit up the ninth level of the Spiritual Power Gem, also equivalent to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. So they were neck and neck in this battle.He had the qualification to challenge Jian Meng\u2019er.\u00a0In addition, it was hard to say who would be the victor.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, you see these two. Who\u2019s better than the other?\u201d Bai Chong asked with a smile.\u201cIt is hard to say.\u201d Situ Qingyue spoke first. In Cultivation of Spiritual Power, Jian Meng\u2019er had reached the peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, which was slightly better than Jian Wushuang. In regards to swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang gained the upper hand. They were well-matched, making it hard to judge their true strength.\u201cI agree.\u201d Ye Xiu nodded his head, \u201cAlthough Cultivation of Spiritual Power is a fundamental step in the process of practicing martial arts, the strength of Martial Arts Technique is an important factor that could also determine the outcome, considering the small disparity in their Cultivation. By virtue of their swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang and Jian Meng\u2019er could totally brawl with each other, and the outcome will be unpredictable.\u201cShui Hanxin, what do you think?\u201d Bai Chong suddenly looked at her, beside him.\u201cI bet Meng\u2019er will win.\u201d Shui Hanxin said following.\u201cOh, you are confident you are in your disciple?\u201d Bai Chong said with the corner of his lip raised.\u201cBai Chong, did you just notice?\u201d Shui Hanxin glanced at Bai Chong, laughing as she said, \u201cThat little guy called Jian Wushuang, although he lit up the Spiritual Power Gem during the detection of Spiritual Power, I could see that he barely reached it. So I am sure that he hasn\u2019t reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. I think his Cultivation is between the peak of the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm and the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Bai Chong just noticed this, nodding.\u201cMoreover, we all know that this little guy had not gathered spiritual power two months ago. Now, two months have passed, his spiritual cultivation has unexpectedly increased so much, so I think there are bound to be many external factors.\u201d Shui Hanxin said plainly.\u201cFor example, regardless of the consequences, he swallowed pills or treasures to enhance his Cultivation by force. But the enhancement would lead him to collapse radically. Not only is his chance of becoming an expert in the future very slim, he also won\u2019t be able to utilize 100% of his strength. His performance will be at a mere 20% or 30% at best.People in the spectators stand frowned upon hearing these words.Indeed, they also thought of this possibility. After all, it was inconceivable that his Cultivation of Spiritual Power increased so quickly. It made no sense to say that he did not use some pills or Natural Treasures.However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang was a Deviant Cultivator. Therefore, his training could not be judged by common sense.\u201cOf course, apart from these two things, the most important part is that I have absolute confidence in my disciple. I know my disciple better than anyone else. It is impossible to find a talent of the same age who can beat my disciple in Sword Marquis Mansion, \u201cShui Hanxin said nonchalantly with a look of absolute confidence.\u201cIt is really subjective, but I rather think the little guy called Jian Wushuang could win.\u201d Bai Chong said and laughed.\u201cSince Mr. Bai Chong thinks so, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Shui Xinhan said with an indifferent smile.\u201cLook, these two little guys are fighting with each other.\u201d Ye Xiu said abruptly from the spectators stand. Everyone instantaneously turned their eyes to the stage.Jian Meng\u2019er was the first to attack.As a trace of Killing Intent burst out from Triple-kill Sword as Jian Meng\u2019er took a huge step and swung the Long Sword with an irresistible force.\u201cSword Tide!\u201dWhen the Long Sword suddenly slashed out, it was like the rolling tide sweeping over the area.Sword Tide was the most terrifying move of the Ceaseless Waterflow Sword Art, and its sweeping wave was the essence of this trick. Under normal circumstances, this move, if mastered to the Profound level, could produce six layers. But at this moment, Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s wave swept out with eight layers.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dJian Wushuang chuckled and caught the waves with his sword, a very common sword, dissolving the eight layers of sword essence without any effort when he touched them by taking advantage of their force. Then he made a huge stride toward his opponent.Whoosh!A tide like Sword light was released, creating waves in the area.Jian Wushuang also performed the move \u201cSword Tide.\u201d But when the Sword art was performed, the rolling waves of sword essence burst out with12 layers in an instant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How did he do that?\u201d\u201cHis sword arts are so strong!\u201dThe first fight between the two brought about bursts of exclamations throughout the Drill Ground.\u201cJian Wushuang\u2019s understanding of swordsmanship is much better than we ever imagined.\u201d The\u00a0famous experts on the stands also felt amazed.They all had broader horizons. Naturally, they could see that Jian Wushuang\u2019s swordsmanship was extraordinary.The sword stroke he displayed before seemed simple, but in fact, it required perfect\u00a0use of the Sword Arts power as well as a high comprehension of basic swordsmanship.Next, Jian Wushuang used the same Sword Tide and released twelve layers of sword essence, which astonished everyone. After all, Jian Meng\u2019er tried her best but only brought about eight layers of sword essence.This tremendous difference immediately demonstrated the big gap between their skills.\u201cFuck off!\u201dAfter an effeminate shout, Jian Meng\u2019er attacked straight ahead indignantly, with her towering Long Sword.This simple action, carrying an incomparably strong power, was filled with an awe-inspiring righteousness. A magnificent Spiritual Power gathered together and then rushed out all at once, colliding\u00a0with the onrushing sword essence wave released by Jian Wushuang.\u201cTianyuan Sword Skill!\u201d While watching from the stands, Bai Chong\u2019s pupils immediately shrank and he cast a glance at Shui Hanxin, then whispered, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so confident. Your baby disciple has already practiced Tianyuan Sword Skills!\u201dShui Hanxin smiled faintly but stayed silent.Tianyuan Sword Skill, the supreme sword art that was practiced in Tianyuan Sword Sect, was far stronger than various sword arts in Sword Marquis Mansion. The degree of strength of cultivation Level represented the degree of pureness, precision and momentum of its Spiritual Power.The overall\u00a0strength of Jian Meng\u2019er, who practiced the Tianyuan Sword Skill, was definitely far stronger\u00a0than ordinary people at the Peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. That\u2019s why Jian Meng\u2019er could overcome twenty movements when she competed with the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion by virtue of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.The twelve waves of sword essence were scattered Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s sword strike, then streaks of sword shadow burst out from one of Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s hands.Each sword was startlingly fast.\u201cAurora Sword Art?\u201d Jian Wushuang slightly raised the corners of his mouth, followed by a sudden cold voice, \u201cI told you before, even though the Aurora Sword Art pursues extreme speed, blindly increasing your speed will affect the coordination and coherence between the Sword Arts. But obviously, you didn\u2019t take my advice. Not to mention that your Sword Art\u2026 It\u2019s too slow!\u201dToo slow!These words resounded on the Drill Ground and immediately made all of the disciples of Marquis\u2019s mansion stunned.After all, in their view,\u00a0Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s Sword Art was fast enough. They were too fast to be seen with the naked eye. In only an instant, a series of sword shadows rushed out. Dozens of sword\u00a0shadows were displayed by her, but Jian Wushuang withstood them all.\u201cToo slow!\u201d\u201cToo slow!\u201dJian Wushuang resisted the swords while shaking his head at the same time. It was clear that he could easily withstand these swords.Jian Meng\u2019er bit the bullet and tried her best to increase the speed. However, even though she displayed the Aurora Sword Art with her full power, she couldn\u2019t even touch Jian Wushuang\u2019s clothes.\u201cI\u2019ll show you the real Aurora Sword Art now,\u201d Jian Wushuang said coldly.After saying that, Shua\u2026 an awesome sword shadow, much faster than that of Jian Meng\u2019er, rushed out at once.They were quick like lightning, and the consecutive sword strikes were coordinated and coherent!\u201cToo fast!\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201dLots of cheering erupted on the Drill Ground.They felt amazed by the speedy swordsmanship\u00a0of Jian Meng\u2019er. As for Jian Wushuang\u2019s speed with the Aurora Sword Art, they truly felt it was unbelievable.It was so fast that people couldn\u2019t see it clearly.\u201cHow can it be so fast?\u201d Jian Meng\u2019er was greatly frightened. Seeing the overlapping sword shadows sweeping towards her like lightning, she immediately used the Boulder Sword Art, which was a special defensive Sword Art among the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavillion, to resist with her all strength.Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!After many successive clashes,\u00a0Jian Meng\u2019er was obviously flustered. Jian Wushuang\u2019s Sword Art was so fast that she couldn\u2019t withstand them, and now she was forced into an embarrassing situation.After the sword light radiated for only a few moments, the Sword Art that was falling like torrential rain suddenly stopped.\u201cEighteen breaths!\u201dForced to the edge of the tower, Jian Meng\u2019er stared in front of her. at Jian Wushuang. She calculated the breaths while she tried to resist Jian Wushuang\u2019s Sword Art. After Jian Wushuang finished the entire Aurora Sword Art, it was only eighteen breaths.While she needed at least thirty-seven breaths to display the whole Sword Art.This meant that Jian Wushuang\u2019s speed with this Sword Art was more than twice as fast as her, and it was obvious that Jian Wushuang displayed it more coherently and with more coordination!It was too fast for her to resist.Jian Meng\u2019er took a glance at the sleeve of her robe. Two\u00a0holes from a sword edge could be seen clearly, exposing her white skin, which made her feel shameful.\u201cBastard!\u201dWith an angry shout, Jian Meng\u2019er attacked him directly with Triple-kill Sword, fiercely.Drifting-snow Sword Art!One of the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts Sword Pavilion!\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dJian Wushuang sneered, easily facing this Sword Art. Then he used the Drifting-Snow Sword Art in a more overbearing and aggressive manner.Just as the old saying goes, \u201cServe them\u00a0with the same sauce.\u201dNo matter what\u00a0Sword Art Jian Meng\u2019er displayed, Jian Wushuang resisted it easily at first and then returned it in a tougher, more mature, and perfect manner.Superior Swordsmanship!He completely surpassed her in Sword Arts!Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s swordsmanship was already good enough for her to reach the Profound level in all Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion. But now, in front of Jian Wushuang, her Sword arts were just like tricks played by little children.The gap was so big.\u201cThe gap of swordsmanship between the two was even bigger than we expected.\u201d Looking down, Situ Qingyue solemnly said, \u201cJian Meng\u2019er has good swordsmanship, but Jian Wushuang\u2019s swordsmanship is much better!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a sixteen-year-old boy could have such impressive swordsmanship. Jian Xinhong, in Sword Marquis Mansion, are you the only person who has better swordsmanship than this little guy?\u201d Ye Xiu looked toward Jian Xinhong.As the Sword Marquis Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong had a full understanding of the situation regarding Sword Marquis Mansion. Hearing Ye Xiu\u2019s words at this moment, he couldn\u2019t help nodding in agreement.As for swordsmanship, merely in Sword Marquis Mansion, he was the only one that was better than Jian Wushuang.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is too early to say that my disciple will lose, right?\u201d Shui Hanxin said with a complacent expression as if everything was already in the bag.\u201cThen continue to watch.\u201d Bai Chong frowned and said nothing more.In the arena, eye catching sword light flashed.Jian Meng\u2019er had successively performed many strikes using First-class Sword Arts of the Sword Pavilion, which were incredibly formidable. However, Jian Wushuang not only countered her attacks, he also countered them with superior sword moves in response.The gap in swordsmanship was too large. Although Jian Meng\u2019er had an absolute advantage when using her spiritual power, it was difficult to utilize this at the moment, as her strength could not be channeled through her attacks. Her arrogance and confidence were completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang.\u201cTwo months ago, you said that you and I were from two different worlds and that there was an insurmountable gap between us!\u201d\u201cYou looked down on me. In your eyes, I was trash, a wretch that could not even gather spiritual power!\u201d\u201cJust before the start of this duel, you said again that in this fight, you would let me face complete despair due to your absolutely dominant strength!\u201d\u201cYou have said so much and been so arrogant. But now, Jian Meng\u2019er, is your strength only to this extent?\u201cCome at me with your strongest attack, or \u2026 could it be that with your current strength, you do not have the qualifications to deserve my attention!\u201dWith eyes gleaming like lightning, Jian Wushuang stared at Jian Meng\u2019er who was embarrassed by the pressure from his swordsmanship. These harsh words which were spoken echoed throughout the whole Drill Ground, causing an uproar in the entire Ground.Jian Meng\u2019er clenched her white teeth tightly, and she involuntarily looked at Shui Hanxin who was in the stand. She sensed her gaze on her and nodded toward her slightly. Jian Meng\u2019er immediately understood Shui Hanxin\u2019s plan through this signal.\u201cJian Wushuang, I know that your gift in Sword Principles is unique, and I never thought of fighting with you based on swordsmanship. But today, I will let you know how big the world is, you \u2026 observe closely.\u201d With a groan, an awe-inspiring righteous aura burst out of her body, while holding her sword in one hand with the sword tip pointed at Jian Wushuang. Strong and formidable sword essence spread out slowly.The sword essence was extremely vigorous, grand and magnificent.\u201cThis is \u2026 \u2026\u201d Bai Chong, who had been smiling in the stand, was surprised, and a hint of fright flashed in his eyes.\u201cBoundless Universe Sword Art, one of the four Ultimate Swords Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect.\u201dBai Chong looked at Shui Hanxin with gloomy countenance, and coldly said, \u201cShui Hanxin, did you teach her the Boundless Universe Sword Art?\u201d\u201cMeng\u2019er is my disciple. Is there anything wrong with teaching her this?\u201dShui Hanxin sneered.The Boundless Universe Sword Art, as one of the four Ultimate Sword Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect, was an absolute peak tier First-class Sword Art. Compared to the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion, it was quite a bit stronger.It was because Jian Meng\u2019er had cultivated this Boundless Heaven Sword Art, combined with her higher Spiritual Power cultivation compared to Jian Wushuang\u2019s, that Shui Hanxin had absolute confidence in Jian Meng\u2019er from beginning to end.\u201cThis is Boundless Heaven Sword Art? There is no longer any suspense in this duel.\u201dSitu Qingyue sighed at the side.\u201cWinner, Jian Meng\u2019er must be the winner. Her Cultivation of Spiritual Power is much higher than that of Jian Wushuang, together with this top tier First-class Sword Art, it is impossible for Jian Wushuang to defeat her, definitely impossible!\u201d Ye Xiu said as well.\u201cVictory!\u201d\u201cThat little guy called Jian Wushuang will lose!\u201dThere was a collective groan from the stands.\u201cWell done, Meng\u2019er, excellent.\u201d At this moment, Jian Lan was clasping his hands full of excitement. Hearing the comments that Jian Meng\u2019er would win the duel coming from the famous experts next to him, he looked ecstatic.Only Bai Chong, who stared at Shui Hanxin with a frosty gaze, coldly said, \u201cAlthough Jian Meng\u2019er is your disciple, after all, she has neither really entered into Tianyuan Sword Sect, nor had an entry ceremony, while you have already taught her the Boundless Heaven Sword Art without authorization. Although you are an Elder of Tianyuan Sword Sect, and it is normal for you to have some privileges. But\u2026 to want to win only by virtue of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Shui Hanxin was surprised as she looked at Bai Chong, with a condescending expression.Jian Meng\u2019er is using the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. Could there be any suspense in this duel?On the battlefield, the condition of Jian Meng\u2019er had reached the peak at this moment. That vast sword essence was at an awe-inspiring stage. Such frightful sword essence indicated that the sword strike that was about to be displayed by Jian Meng\u2019er would be world shaking in power.\u201cSuch strong sword essence, I didn\u2019t think that Jian Meng\u2019er would have this much power.\u201d The expression of Jian Wushuang was gloomy. \u201cThis sword essence is amazing. It is not from my Sword Marquis Mansion, so it seems that her Great Master taught her that.\u201d\u201cGood, I guess that makes sense.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were hot.\u201cJian Wushuang, take my strike. Remember, it is called Sword River!\u201dJian Meng\u2019er said coldly.\u201cSword River?\u201dJian Wushuang eyes were fiery, and strong battle intent rose up from his heart immediately.\u201dCome on, let this attack determine the outcome!\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t let you down.\u201dThe awe-inspiring aura from the body of Jian Meng\u2019er had reached the ultimate limit. At this moment, she held the Triple-kill Sword with both hands together and raised the sword into the air. Heaven and earth seemed to pause for a moment, while the surroundings fell silent instantly.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dFinally, Jian Meng\u2019er powerfully hacked down with her Long Sword.Swoosh!A bright and dazzling sword light burst forth, cutting through the air and leaving an eye catching Sword River flowing through the void.Gorgeous and beautiful!Anyone who saw this Sword River would be completely immersed and awestruck.However, when the Sword River flowed towards Jian Wushuang, he suddenly closed his eyes and thought of many unexpected scenes. All these scenes were about the time he and Jian Meng\u2019er spent over the last four years from day to night.\u201cOnce, I dreamed that I could be with you forever. We would get married and even have children!\u201d\u201cYou were my closest partner, someone I truly loved!\u201d\u201cI was willing to give you everything, even my life!\u201d\u201cBut now, this illusion has been broken.\u201d\u201cThe next sword will determine victory or defeat, as well as completely end the relationship between you and me.

The other was cold and dazzling, as well as fleeting.Both sword lights were frighteningly powerful but very different.If one would describe Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s Sword River as a colossal giant, capable of overpowering anything in the world, then Jian Wushuang\u2019s sword light was akin to an omnipresent assassin, lurking in the void like a King of Assassination.A colossal giant had the ability to overpower the world. As an assassin and the King of Assassination, was there any need for him to compete with her? It was naturally hopeless.Swish!The fleeting sword light resurfaced once again, bypassing the long and splendid stream of Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s Sword River and appearing in front of her. Before she could even react, the sword light swept over her wrist.Blood splattered and the Triple-kill Sword fell on the ground.Jian Wushuang was already in front of Jian Meng\u2019er, the Long Sword in his hand pointing at her throat, stopping less than half a centimeter away from her skin. It was so close that she shivered from the coldness of the steel, her beautiful face finally turning pale for the first time.Time seemed to have come to a standstill.Everyone stared at the scene unfolding on the arena in disbelief.\u201cH-Has he really defeated her?\u201d\u201cJian Meng\u2019er lost!\u201d\u201cOh my God!\u201dA thundering uproar swept the Drill Ground as everyone exclaimed loudly.Over on the grandstand\u2026\u201cImpossible!\u201d Shui Hanxin was the first on her feet.

He could not believe what had just happened.\u201cJian Meng\u2019er, who uses the Boundless Heaven Sword Art was defeated.\u201d The famous experts in the grandstand exchanged looks.

Only the Masters are qualified to understand it and only three Sword Pavilion Masters have truly comprehended it. I didn\u2019t think this boy would be able to comprehend it. His father must have taught him,\u201d Jian Xinhong said excitedly. \u201cIt must be his father that taught him,\u201d Jian Xinhong said excitedly.It was no wonder he was so excited. After all, Anonymous Sword Art was so advanced that it was incredible for anyone to be able to comprehend it.\u201cWhat Anonymous Sword Art? Is it even comparable to our Tianyuan Sword Sect\u2019s Boundless Heaven Sword Art?\u201d asked Shui Hanxin, her expression turning cold.\u201cShui Hanxin, you\u2019re being ignorant about this. Even if your Tianyuan Sword Sect\u2019s Boundless Heaven Sword Art is great, it doesn\u2019t mean there are only a few Sword Arts that can rival it. Take the Anonymous Sword Art as an example. It\u2019s more powerful than the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.\u201d Bai Chong sneered, staring at Shui Hanxin. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t heard of the Anonymous Sword Art, I\u2019m sure you know it as the Formless Sword Art.\u201d\u201cFormless Sword Art? The best Sword Art in the world, Formless Sword Art?\u201d Shui Hanxin was startled. \u201cYou\u2019re saying what Jian Wushuang demonstrated was the Formless Sword Art?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The corners of Bai Chong\u2019s mouth lifted and he nodded. \u201cThe famous Formless Sword Art contains nine different movements. The terrifying ones being the last three, but they have been long lost. The middle three are rare and valuable. They\u2019re hard to get even if your sect is willing to pay a hefty price.\u201d\u201cThe first three movements of the Formless Sword Art are more common. Even a second-rate power, much weaker than your sect, could get their hands on them as long as they\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, the first Sword Marquis Mansion Master, 200 years ago, paid a heavy price for the first three movements, which make up the Anonymous Sword Art!\u201d\u201cThe one Jian Wushuang used was the First Move of the Formless Sword Art, Blood Shadow!\u201d\u201cBlood Shadow?\u201dEveryone could not help recalling the move Jian Wushuang had demonstrated on the arena.The sword moved like a ghost, and when the Sword Edge fell there was a flicker of red. It was like a red shadow, thus the technique was named Blood Shadow.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying technique.\u201d The famous experts in the grandstand were all amazed.\u201cShui Hanxin, your disciple lost this battle!\u201d Bai Chong said.Shui Hanxin\u2019s expression turned steely.Lost!She really lost the battle.On the arena, Jian Wushuang\u2019s Long Sword remained near Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s neck. If he moved his palm even just slightly closer, he could kill her at once.\u201cJian Wushuang, are you happy now? If you\u2019re still not satisfied, just kill me directly.\u201d She was smiling but it was an incredibly tragic smile.He looked at her momentarily without speaking before putting down his Long Sword. He bent over to pick up the discarded sword on the ground and stroked the metal slowly.\u201cTriple-kill Sword.\u201dThere was a hint of surprise in her eyes when she saw him pick up the Triple-kill Sword. When she raised her head to look at him, cold words resounded by her ears.\u201cTwo months ago, I told you the Sword Pavilion will always belong to Sword Pavilion. It\u2019ll always belong to my father and I. Don\u2019t even dream about getting a piece of it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill anyone who tries to steal it.\u201d\u201cYou only have yourself to blame for what happened today!\u201d\u201cMyself to blame?\u201d A stunned Jian Meng\u2019er had become a little whiter when she heard this.

That\u2019s a fine phrase.\u201dA majestic, booming voice reverberated throughout the Drill Ground unexpectedly. Everyone turned and finally noticed the cold-faced young man by Shui Hanxin\u2019s side.The young man carried a Long Sword and had always stood quietly beside Shui Hanxin. He had not spoken since the beginning, but his brows were now uplifted. In two quick steps, he came up to the arena and his voice echoed in the air.\u201cI\u2019m Ye Mo of the Tianyuan Sword Sect.

Instead, you\u2019re being humiliated on stage. As a Great Master, she can not help you in respect of her status. However, as your Senior Brother, I can not just stand by and watch.\u201dYe Mo looked at Jian Wushuang again after that, and said in a deep voice: \u201cJian Wushuang, as a man, does it give you a sense of achievement to bully a woman?\u201d\u201cA woman?\u201d Jian Wushuang could not help laughing, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell she was a woman when she taught me an unforgettable lesson two months ago, that strength mattered the most in the world?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re right.\u201d Ye Mo nodded, hummed in a cold voice: \u201cAs you said, only strength matters in this world. But I will tell you with confidence that my Junior Sister, as well as the disciples of the Great Master, are not easy to bully.\u201d\u201cI will let you know that you are just a narrow-minded person and a contemptible scoundrel!\u201dAs the voice fell, a strong Spiritual Power was emitted from Ye Mo.The Spiritual Power was much stronger than the Peak Profound Spiritual Sea Realm emitted by Jian Meng\u2019er.\u201cExceptional Spiritual Sea Realm\u201d\u201cHow could Ye Mo already be an expert in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm?\u201d\u201cHow old is he? He looks about our age. How could his Cultivation of Spiritual Power be so high?\u201d\u201cIt was already surprising that Jian Meng\u2019er achieved the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm at 16 years old, not to mention her Senior Brother!\u201dThe Drill Ground was immediately filled with exclamations.\u201cShui Hanxin, there really are a lot of geniuses in the Tianyuan Sword Sect.\u201d Bai Chong looked at Shui Hanxin meaningfully.\u201cThe reason why my Tianyuan Sword Sect is strong is that there are plenty of generations of genius disciples attracted by our rich resources that keep gathering there. Meng\u2019er is only at the top in talent, but she is not the strongest,\u201d Shui Hanxin said.\u201cBut your disciples\u2019 behavior goes a bit too far, right? The moment Jian Meng\u2019er was defeated, he jumped out. If Jian Wushuang was defeated, would all of your top disciples in Tianyuan Sword Sect jump out to help him? \u201cBai Chong said in a cold voice.\u201cSo what? There are indeed many apprentices in my Tianyuan Sword Sect. What\u2019s more, he is also 16,\u00a0the same age as Jian Wushuang. It is fair for the two of them to fight.\u201d Shui Hanxin said and laughed.\u201cThat is different.\u201d Bai Chong shook his head and said, \u201cAlthough they are at the same age, the cultivation they have is rather different. While your disciple gets top resources from the Tianyuan Sword Sect, including Cultivation Methods in swordsmanship, guidance from experts at the Peak of the Gold Core Realm, as well as from some stronger disciples in the Tianyuan Sword Sect. Jian Wushuang learned all this by himself. How could they be the same?\u201d\u201cThen who is to blame? It is he himself.\u201d Looking pale, Shui Hanxin shot a glance at Bai Chong and spoke in a low voice, \u201cBai Chong, Jian Wushuang has nothing to do with you. He is from Sword Marquis Mansion, and you are the Supervisor of the Gladiator Arena. Even the Sword Marquis Mansion Master allowed this disciple to jump out. Why are you are complaining?\u201dBai Chong, stunned, couldn\u2019t help looking at the experts from Sword Marquis Mansion.They were either Elders from Red Martial Hall or alchemists from Pill Refining Room, except for Jian Xinhong. But People from Sword Pavilion were not here. People from Red Martial Hall and Pill Refining Room did not support Jian Wushuang. As for Jian Xinhong, he hesitated for a while, however, when he saw the cold complexion on Shui Hanxin, he swallowed his words.Because he could tell that Shui Hanxin was enraged. If he supported Jian Wushuang at this moment, he would offend an Elder who had great power in Tianyuan Sword Sect, in the name of Sword Marquis Mansion.So, he chose to swallow his words.Bai Chong couldn\u2019t say anything because even people in Sword Marquis Mansion didn\u2019t support him. How could he blame an outsider?Spiritual Power at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm came from Ye Mo on the arena. It made the disciples from the Marquis mansion feel stressed.\u201cExceptional Spiritual Sea Realm?\u201d Jian Wushuang felt surprised.Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm is a higher Level than Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s. Ye Mo became an apprentice of Shui Hanxin a long time ago. What\u2019s more, he has been training in Tianyuan Sword Sect with Cultivation Methods and secret Sword Arts. His swordsmanship must be more excellent than Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s since his cultivation is much stronger.Jian Wushuang had already tried his best to defeat Jian Meng\u2019er. As for Ye Mo, he felt very unsure. However, he sensed that he had to fight with Ye Mo when he saw the icy stares of Shui Hanxin and the complicated expressions from everyone around him.\u201cI have no right to refuse the fight, yet I never wanted to refuse. So let\u2019s begin!\u201d Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly, showing a little insanity in his slightly narrowed eyes.\u201cSoul-Devouring\u2026 Secret skill!\u201dHum\u2026 the Void shook with insanity.Jian Wushuang\u2019s body seemed to become a dark hole capable of capturing anything. Natural power from all things of the universe came to him at a surprising speed.As the natural power poured into his body, Jian Wushuang\u2019s spirit raged.His Cultivation of Spiritual Power was only at the Peak of the Eighth Heaven of the Divine Path, almost at the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. However, now his Cultivation of Spiritual Power exceeded the Eighth Heaven of the Divine Path into the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path.At the same time, a piercing pain made Jian Wushuang\u2019s face contort.Finally, when this Soul-Devouring Secret Skill reached the peak, the pain in his body reached its Peak too. His Cultivation of Spiritual Power promoted to the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path at that moment.Grinding his teeth tightly, Jian Wushuang\u2019s face contorted. The moment he raised his head, a light filled the Void. Jian Wushuang spoke with great arrogance and obstination that resounded in the people\u2019s hearts.\u201cYou are Ye Mo from Tianyuan Sword Sect, right? If you need to be convinced, then I will convince you with my fists!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because of the advantages of the Heavenly Creation skill, the Peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path had nearly the same power as the Peak of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm for normal Warriors.\u201cWh- what happened here?\u201d\u201cHow did his Spiritual Power become so strong?\u201dAll those present were in awe.They were wondering how Jian Wushuang had become so strong all of a sudden. However, if they looked under the floor, they would find that all the creatures within 100 meters of Jian Wushuang had died.\u201cWhat? He is actually retaining his strength?!\u201dJian Meng\u2019er who had retreated to the Drill Ground trembled with fright when he saw the aggressive figure from behind.Jian Wushuang\u2019s look changed completely. His ruthless eyes were fastened on Ye Mo. He was aware that using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill did great harm to his body, and the pain in his body would grow with each passing minute. He had to end this fight as quickly as possible.\u201cKill!\u201dJian Wushuang soared,and the Long Sword turned into a ghastly force.PING!Sword light shone, cold and glaring.It was still the First Move of the Anonymous\u00a0Sword Art, Blood Shadow.Jian Wushuang defeated Jian Meng\u2019er in a single move. The extraordinary speed of the Sword Art amazed everyone, and the present speed was obviously faster because of Jian Wushuang\u2019s growing Cultivation.\u201cIt\u2019s too fast to think about.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dYe Mo hummed with remarkable noble spirit, and a magnificent sword light appeared.What Ye Mo used was the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.But Ye Mo used the Boundless Heavens Sword Art in a much more flexible manner than Jian Meng\u2019er.This was because Jian Meng\u2019er had just begun to train in the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. Ye Mo, grew up studying the Sword Art in the Tianyuan Sword Sect. They obviously had a different level of understanding towards the Sword Art.It was still a fight between the Giant of Heaven and Earth and the King of Assassination.However, Jian Wushuang\u2019s first move, Blood Shadow, met the magnificent sword light instead of going around it, causing these two strong forces to erupt.It was apparent that the advantage of Jian Wushuang\u2019s first move, Blood Shadow, was its amazing speed. But it still fell behind the Boundless Heaven Sword Art in terms of strength and power.After the collision of these two swords, the cold and shining sword light darkened quickly with the overwhelming crush following.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201d Jian Wushuang was disappointed.\u201cThe advantage of your Sword Art lies in the speed, but it lacks in strength. My Junior Sister has been practicing the Boundless Heaven Sword Art for only a short time, thus she didn\u2019t have a deep understanding of it. This caused her defeat. I am much better!\u201dYe Mo\u2019s look was ruthless, and he said in a low voice, \u201cJian Wushuang, you must think your Sword Art is very swift, yes? I will show you what real speed is.\u201dYe Mo turned into a Flowing Light as soon as he finished his words.WAH!Ye Mo appeared in front of Jian Wushuang swiftly with his sword light.Both the body and the sword were like Flowing Light.\u201cHow fast!\u201d\u201cIt is so fast!\u201dA large group of disciples in a Marquis\u2019s mansion were astonished.\u201cThis is one of the four Ultimate Sword Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect, Flowing Light Sword Art. It is famous for its speed.\u201d Bai Chong was marveled in the stand.The four Ultimate Sword Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect were all First-class Sword Arts, so once each of them was practiced to a certain degree, they would be extremely terrifying.As for the Flowing Light Sword Art, its advantage was speed.It was so fast that the sword light became many shadows and twisted in the air. It looked like it was being swept by the sword light.Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression was very serious. When Ye Mo\u2019s Sword Art came toward him, he used Aurora Sword Art first.Speed was extremely important in the Aurora Sword Art, and Jian Wushuang had mastered it.The Sword Art was extremely fast when it was used.CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!Numerous consecutive clashes could be heard, but it was obvious that Ye Mo\u2019s Flowing Light Sword Art was faster. Although Jian Wushuang tried his best, Aurora Sword Art was only a First-class Sword Art, while the Flowing Light Sword Art was a supreme Sword Art. it was even known as an Ultimate Sword Art in the Tianyuan Sword Sect, which mainly studied Sword Principle.There was a big gap between the level of these two Sword Arts, so even though Jian Wushuang had mastered the Aurora Sword Art, he still could not gain an advantage.In the arena, Jian Wushuang was forced to retreat continuously.\u00a0Then suddenly, a fierce chop instead of the usual sword jab came towards Jian Wushuang.Jian Wushuang immediately noticed. He raised his Long Sword naturally, meeting the fierce sword shadow with his body sinking slightly, and then he retreated very quickly.\u201cJian Wushuang, your swordsmanship is not so great.\u201d Ye Mo glared at Jian Wushuang ruthlessly. \u201cIf your strength is like this, then the battle is over.\u201dJust as Ye Mo finished speaking, a strong sword essence suddenly burst from him. He moved the Long Sword in his hand slowly. With this move, a huge dim shadow with a height of over 10 meters appeared from behind. The Long Sword was moving with Ye Mo.Finally, the Sword Art had matured.\u201cBoundless Heavens Sword Art, Legendary Maneuver!\u201dYe Mo slashed suddenly with the Long Sword in his hand. The enormous sword shadow was also wavering.This sword seemed to be able to split the world in half.The strong power left the crowd breathless. The horrible sword essence could destroy nearly everything. All the people on the Drill Ground were amazed.\u201cNot good.\u201dBai Chong was in the arena. His expression became serious and the Spiritual Power appeared in his hands. He was ready to save Jian Wushuang. However, he became hesitant as soon as he saw Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression.Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression was very subtle, with hints of seriousness and surprise, but mostly excitement.\u201cIs he going to use the Eleventh Move?\u201dJian Wushuang stared at the strong sword light coming toward him. At this moment, a deep awareness of crisis sprang up from the bottom of his heart. He thought about how this sword could cut him into two pieces.But this unprecedented life-or-death crisis made him feel something.In this moment of life or death, he became calmer and closed his eyes.\u201cIs this it? Is it like this?\u201d\u201cI finally understand what it was that prevented me from using this Style.\u201cIt is the ruthlessness for killing.\u201cIf the sword is for killing, how could I lack the ruthlessness for killing?\u201dJian Wushuang opened his eyes, an onrush of excitement flashed before his eyes, and he waved the Triple-kill Sword.It was the second move of the Anonymous Sword Art, Sword-killing Movement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Killing intent began to emerge and rise.\u201cSword-killing Movement!\u201d Bai Chong stood up instantly, stunned by this dazzling bloody sword light, and said, \u201cThe second move of the Formless Sword Art, Sword-killing Movement! He managed to put it to good use?\u201d\u201cSword-killing Movement?\u201d Shui Hanxin was also surprised by this, apparently knowing the prestige of the second Formless Sword Art, Sword-killing Movement.\u201cShui Hanxin, hurry up! Help your disciple,\u201d said Bai Chong.Lowering her eyesight slightly, Shui Hanxin gazed at the two nearly-colliding sword lights in the arena and sighed in frustration. She moved quickly.CLANG!Having collided with each other in the arena, the two horrifying sword lights instantly witnessed victory and defeat.\u201cWhat?\u201dYe Mo, with his eyes wide open, found it rather hard to believe that the most powerful attack, with all of his strength, had been totally defeated without any struggle. Then the dazzling bloody sword light, still concentrating all its power, hacked straight towards him.An unprecedented crisis of death immediately shrouded him.Shui Hanxin\u2019s figure suddenly flashed in front of him at the last second, and the bloody sword light dissipated with just the wave of a hand. Only complete silence remained in the arena.Ye Mo clenched his teeth, gazing firmly at Jian Wushuang, his heart full of unwillingness.He accepted this defeat unwillingly and helplessly. After all, he knew clearly that he would have died if his Great Master had not given him a hand. Such a terrifying sword stroke could easily tear his body apart.At this moment, Jian Wushuang gazed passed Ye Mo. He was suffering great agony from using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill. Even his face looked extremely ferocious. This skill was far more fearful than he ever imagined. It reached the extreme limit in only a short amount of time.BZZZZ\u2026 The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill ceased spontaneously, and the soaring aura around Jian Wushuang faded away rapidly, even to an ignorable extent. Jian Wushuang could not be more feeble, and his entire body was trembling.On the contrary, his inner unyielding willpower was the source of standing still. When he raised his eyes, the Triple-kill Sword in his hand headed precisely towards Shui Hanxin.\u201cUnconvinced? Then fight!\u201dThe rising sword essence suddenly erupted.It was this moment that impressed the entire audience on the Drill Ground. They all saw how Jian Wushuang had become so weak, yet the battle intent and sword essence around him never faded away.Shui Hanxin\u2019s complexion was pale and cold, she was already overwhelmed with helplessness.Fight back?How\u2026 is this possible?\u201dSince it stemmed from the conflicts between Jian Wushuang and Jian Meng\u2019er, Ye Mo had helped the defeated Jian Meng\u2019er, which was far too excessive. A putative second fight was not only excessive but extremely shameless.As one of the Elders of the Tianyuan Sword Sect and an expert at the Peak of the Gold Core Realm, Shui Hanxin had somewhat retained her gentility and self-respect.\u201cMeng\u2019er.\u201d Shui Hanxin glanced at Jian Meng\u2019er with a pale face and stupefied expression. She said, \u201cYou have no choice but to cultivate with me in the Tianyuan Sword Sect from now on, and are forbidden to step outside for three years, during which I will promptly teach you all my skills.\u201dSuddenly Jian Meng\u2019er was astonished, showing a very complicated look. But then she let out a deferential, \u201cYes,\u201d nodding her head.\u201cJian Wushuang.\u201d Shui Hanxin gazed coldly back at Jian Wushuang. \u201cYou won today. It only shows that there are some limitations on teaching my disciple, not for a shortage of some more exceptional disciples in my Tianyuan Sword Sect. In three years we will witness another competition between you and Meng\u2019er.\u201cAnother competition in three years?\u201d A slow sly smile crept at the corner of Jian Wushuang\u2019s mouth. He looked Jian Meng\u2019er up and down, then snickered silently.Jian Wushuang himself was deeply aware of it. Jian Meng\u2019er had been defeated by someone not even qualified to compete. After all, the gap between them was bound to increase because what he had been cultivating was the Heavenly Creation Skill.Silently turning as if Jian Meng\u2019er had no presence, he headed downstairs slowly.\u201cAnytime!\u201dAn icy utterance came from Jian Wushuang, resounding throughout the Drill Ground. Everyone focused on the heavy footsteps below as if each individual step was terrifically tough. Everyone could feel how the existing sword essence was growing more and more powerful with each step.Nowadays, from the perspective of the audience, Jian Wushuang was spontaneously endowed with something peculiar.No one could figure out what it was exactly.As Jian Wushuang\u2019s figure gradually disappeared from their sight, they were all amazed at the strong soaring sword essence. There were no words, only silence.On one of the top floors of the arena tower, four figures stood still.The four seniors looked very ancient. The gray-haired leader wore a long robe.The Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion!The senior leader with a long robe was the impressive Elder Hong.On such a critical day, a decisive time for the Sword Pavilion, Jian Wushuang hadn\u2019t let the Four Elders down, even growing enough to create a miracle. He had defeated Jian Meng\u2019er with only two months of cultivation. Such an unprecedented achievement was surely a great shock within the Sword Pavilion, even to these four. However, the Four Elders, stood still, more depressed than ever before.Deep misgivings, rather than any joy, emerged on their withered faces.With a low voice, one of the Elders said, \u201cbrother, I assume you see it?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 \u201d Nodding, Elder Hong, concentrated on Jian Wushuang\u2019s back, his eyes never leaving it.\u201cDespite being tired physically and mentally, he still stands firm and tense. Sword essence surges upwards, but never disperses!\u201d\u201cThe awakening of Sword Soul, the same as our Pavilion Master. Absolutely.\u201dOnce they heard \u201cthe awakening of Sword Soul\u201d, their looks suddenly became respectful and earnest.Meanwhile, Elder Hong looked up at the immense sky and wondered how the previously sunny day somehow now showed a hint of darkness. Elder Hong lifted up his hand, covering the upward universe, and slowly uttered.\u201cOh\u2026 It\u2019s about to change\u2026\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, she had been completely overshadowed by someone else.Two months prior, Jian Wushuang had been an untalented normal person. But now, only two months later, he had become the victor in the battle. Not only did he defeat Jian Meng\u2019er, but he even defeated Jian Meng\u2019er\u2019s Senior Brother, Ye Mo, who had achieved the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cA real genius!\u201dMore than a Monster.The whole Sword Marquis Mansion and even the whole Bashui Commandery were talking about him with great relish.In the Bashui Commandery county, an old man in a gray robe with silver-white hair walked alone through the streets. It was Elder Hong. He came to a deserted alley. In this alley, there was a shabby wine shop that had been there for years, but no one came here to buy wine. The whole wine shop had only one person, the proprietress.Elder Hong walked into the wine shop and looked at the proprietress standing behind the counter. Without saying anything, he walked directly into the inner hall to wait.After a while, the old woman, the proprietress of the wine shop, came in gracefully.\u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve been here, blind old man? Two years?\u201d The middle-aged woman smiled.\u201cI came here today for something important,\u201d Elder Hong said with dignity.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop by when you were free? You are a little ungrateful,\u201d The woman said this with a weak smile, and then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dElder Hong took a deep breath and said, \u201cThe young master has awakened the Sword Soul.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d A moment ago, the woman had been very calm. Her face immediately became extremely solemn.Jian Wushuang would have been very surprised if he had heard the term that Elder Hong used.He had always been known as Young Pavillion Master, but now he\u2019d become the young master.\u201cSword Soul! The soul of the sword ancestor!\u201d The woman said solemnly, \u201cI am very surprised that after the master awakened the Sword Soul, the young master also awakened his own Sword Soul. Both father and son awakening Sword Soul simultaneously, that is almost inconceivable!\u201d\u201cIt is incredible, but it happened,\u201d Elder Hong said, \u201cAlthough awakening Sword Soul has great benefits, it also has evil accompaniments. If I am right, now that young master\u2019s sword soul is awakened, people in that place will certainly be aware of it, and they will soon come to kill the young master.\u201d\u201cKill the young master? Just as they dealt with the master that year?\u201d The woman had a trace of killing intent in her eyes.\u201cYes, so we must act immediately.\u201d Elder Hong\u2019s voice was solemn, and he immediately drew a letter out from his arm. \u201cGo at once, and send this letter to the one in Golden-dragon Palace. He must be informed as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded solemnly and took the letter. She set off without hesitation.In the meantime, in Tianyan Province Qingdong Commandery, in a slightly secret chamber.By candlelight, a man with a purple coat sat solemnly reading the sealed letter before him.Suddenly, the door of the chamber was opened, and a black-robed man ran in quickly.\u201cHall Master, there is an urgent order!\u201d The black-robed man respectfully handed him a letter.He opened the letter. The first thing he saw was a blood-colored token. The token had a word carved in clear scarlet, \u201cKILL.\u201d\u201cA Scarlet Kill Command!\u201d The man was surprised.The organization he belonged to was extremely powerful. People were scared to hear the name of the organization everywhere in the Tianzong Dynasty. There were many orders for organizing top-level people, such as the Bronze, Silver, and Golden Killing Commands. But the Scarlet Kill Command was the supreme command of the organization, only the mysterious leader of their organization could release it.A Scarlet Kill, meant that it had to be done regardless of the price, as long as they could kill the enemy. Even if all the experts who were sent to assassinate the target would die.The Scarlet Kill Command had been handed down only a few times since the organization\u2019s creation.\u201cPass down the order. Make all assassins above \u2018silver-masked\u2019 level come back immediately. No matter what they are doing now. Even if they\u2019ve accepted a task, make them give up the task or delay it immediately. If anybody hasn\u2019t returned within three days of receiving this order, he will be killed!\u201d The man sneered.\u201cYes.\u201d The black-robed man nodded respectfully.He continued to look at the letter.\u201cBashui Commander, Sword Marquis Mansion, Jian Wushuang\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom this day on, we shall keep a close watch over our target\u2019s actions. We must not let him out of our sight before we are ready to make our move!\u201d\u2026Sword Marquis Mansion. It had been five days since the battle ended.During the past five days, two great events had occurred in Sword Marquis Mansion.The first was that the Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong had appointed Jian Wushuang as the new Sword Pavilion Master.No one was surprised. After all, two months ago Jian Xinhong had appointed Jian Meng\u2019er as the Sword Pavilion Master. He had been preparing to hold the official ceremony after the Token Battle. But, during that battle, Jian Meng\u2019er had been defeated by Jian Wushuang directly, in front of many people. Plus, Jian Wushuang himself belonged to Sword Pavilion. His swordsmanship was unique, and he took over as Sword Pavilion Master in a more convincing way than Jian Meng\u2019er.As for the second thing, it was the Great Elder of Red Martial Hall. Jian Lan had resigned from his position after the battle and left Sword Marquis Mansion to travel far and wide.This caused a great stir in Sword Marquis Mansion, but it was understandable.After the battle, because of her talent, no one had said anything to Jian Meng\u2019er. She had followed her Great Master to go to the Tianyuan Sword Sect and cultivate. But Jian Lan was a joke in Sword Marquis Mansion, and a lot of people were stealthily sarcastic towards him. Jian Lan had been aware, resolutely resigning his position as Great Elder, leaving Sword Marquis Mansion. It had been a good choice.In the courtyard, Jian Wushuang was practicing his swordsmanship alone.Sword light was moving, and it was confusing.For a long time, Jian Wushuang stood with his sword.\u201cIt\u2019s been five days, but my body still hasn\u2019t really recovered.\u201d Jian Wushuang said secretly.The Soul-Devouring Secret Skill had done so much damage to his body that it had been in a state of extreme weakness since then. It had not returned to peak condition yet.\u201cWell.\u201d Jian Wushuang raised his head suddenly and looked at the yard. Four old figures came in, the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion, headed by Elder Hong.\u201cElder Hong, Senior Yuan, Senior Qing, Senior Li,\u201d Jian Wushuang called out immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sword Pavilion would have fallen into the hands of Red Martial Hall if you hadn\u2019t defeated Jian Meng\u2019er.\u201dSenior Yuan said, \u201cYes, you were magnificent,\u00a0Young Pavillion Master. It was amazing that it only took two months for you to surpass Jian Meng\u2019er. You are definitely the son of the Pavilion Master.\u201dSenior Qing proudly said, \u201cHmm, when I heard that you, Young Pavillion Master, would have a battle with Jian Meng\u2019er, I was sure that you could defeat her.\u201dSenior Li refuted him at once, \u201cYou dare to say that. You were the first to say that it was impossible.\u201dHearing the Four Great Elders words and even seeing them play with each other, Jian Wushuang smiled. His heart was full of gratification.But at the moment, Elder Hong looked at him and said, \u201cYoung Pavillion Master, you did a good job at a tough time. You held the Sword Pavilion together for us. But now you are leaving.\u201d\u201cLeaving? Where am I going?\u201d Jian Wushuang was surprised.With severe countenance, Elder Hong said, \u201cYou are leaving Sword Marquis Mansion and going somewhere else.\u201dJian Wushuang felt a little puzzled, \u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026.\u201d, Elder Hong was silent, not knowing how to answer.A cold voice suddenly rang out, \u201cStop your nonsense.\u201d As Jian Wushuang turned and looked around, a green-clothed woman appeared behind him.The green-clothed woman was graceful, with black hair and a veil covering her face. Although people could not see her actual appearance, one could tell that the woman was very beautiful just by looking into her eyes.The green-clothed woman seemed charming. However, there was a faint smell on her body. All the good was gone.Jian Wushuang frowned and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d He was sure that he had never seen this woman.Elder Hong noticed the green-clothed woman and didn\u2019t feel any sense of amazement. He said, \u201cIf you\u2019re here, that means that the others should be ready.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she nodded, stepping toward Jian Wushuang. \u201cThere is little time to say so much. You! Come with me at once.\u201d\u201cFollow you?\u201d Jian Wushuang showed alertness, and sword essence began to gather in his body.\u201cRidiculous.\u201d The woman laughed and moved around. Jian Wushuang did not react as the woman patted his forehead with her palm. At this moment a majestic Spiritual Power poured into his body. It blocked his eight extra channels and then seized his hands.Jian Wushuang wanted to rebel, but he realized, to his horror, that he could not control his Spiritual Power.Jian Wushuang was frightened, \u201cGold Core. She has at least cultivated a Gold Core, she might even be an expert of the Gold Core Realm.\u201dElder Hong said loudly, \u201cYoung Pavillion Master, you can go with her. She won\u2019t hurt you.\u201dJian Wushuang tried to say something, but all of a sudden\u2026 BOOM!A terrifying roar came from close behind, immediately followed by a large amount of Spiritual Power.\u201cWho are you? How dare you behave atrociously in my Sword Marquis Mansion!\u201d A voice immediately rang through the sky.Jian Wushuang recognized that the voice, it was the Sword Marquis Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong.\u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d said the green-clothed woman, who had already put Jian Wushuang behind her back. \u201cI\u2019ll take him and hand everything else over to you.\u201d\u201cThe four of us are ready.\u201d Elder Hong and other three Great Elders looked at each other, and each took out a Scarlet Pill. They did not hesitate to swallow the Scarlet Pill.\u201cBlind old man.\u201dAnother person came to the courtyard, a graceful middle-aged woman. She was the proprietress of the wine shop where Elder Hong had gone before.\u201cJiu Jun\u2026\u201d noticing that someone had come in, Elder Hong became nervous.The woman smiled, \u201cNothing else to say? Give me a Scarlet Pill.\u201dElder Hong frowned.\u201cNo? Are you not willing or you do not have any?\u201d The woman, Jiu Jun, smiled and then took out a Scarlet Pill, \u201cFortunately, I prepared one for myself.\u201dAfter finishing her words, she swallowed it quickly, not noticing Elder Hong\u2019s expression.Elder Hong sighed, \u201cJiu Jun, Why would you do this?\u201d\u201cBlind old man, do you know why I always call you a Blind old man? Because you can\u2019t see how I\u2019ve felt about you for so many years,\u201d Jiu Jun smiled, \u201cBut it does not matter anymore. Although we have not really been together, at least we can die together.\u201dElder Hong took a deep look at Jiu Jun and nodded heavily.The Four Great Elders of the Sword Pavilion and Jiu Jun had swallowed a Scarlet Pill. The aura surrounding the five people instantly soared up, directly reaching an unprecedented level.Gold Core!Five people had all reached the Primordial Gold Core Realm. Elder Hong\u2019s aura was the strongest, reaching the point of the Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201cThis, this \u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang was completely confused.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWho broke into the Sword Marquis Mansion? Who is the green-clothed woman with a veil? What kind of pill did the four Elders swallow? Why did their strength suddenly improve so much? And most importantly, why did they swallow this pill? Why do they look like they are going to die?\u201dJian Wushuang had so many doubts. He did not understand what had happened.All of this was too sudden, there had been no signs at all.\u201cJi Wuyue, I will leave the young master to you.\u201d Elder Hong turned red and growled with a trace of madness in his eyes.Ji Wuyue looked at the five people. Two words that were so heavy came out of the mouth of the green-clothed woman slowly.\u201cTake care!\u201dAfter finishing her words, Ji Wuyue did not hesitate to turn around, taking Jian Wushuang away at full speed and sweeping out of Sword Marquis Mansion.Just as Ji Wuyue turned and left, a wide roar of rage rang through Sword Marquis Mansion.\u201cHaha, you Blood Feather Tower bastards, prepare to go to hell!\u201d\u201cWell, you five old people! How dare you block us?! Kill them!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201dAs the roar of rage echoed, the whole Sword Marquis Mansion was caught in a terrible war. Deadly amounts of Spiritual Power soared through the area.While all this was happening, Jian Wushuang was totally at a loss.\u201cWhat on earth is happening?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jian Wushuang is in danger. Please quickly come to Tranquility Forest, ten miles from the border, to save him.Bai Chong then looked at the signature.\u201cSmile Allure, Ji Wumeng.\u201d\u201cJi Wumeng?\u201d A look of fear showed in Bai Chong\u2019s eyes and then he immediately ordered, \u201cAll golden-robed servants follow me, right now.\u201dA moment later, seven figures full of energy rushed out from the Gladiator Arena.Each of these seven figures had reached the Gold Core Realm. Among which leader Bai Chong ranked at the Peak of the Gold Core Realm.\u2026Tranquility Forest, ten miles from the border.Several figures stood in the treetops, waiting quietly.\u201cHere they come,\u201d said a burly man with a head of disorganized hair. He followed them with his eyes.WOOSH!Ji Wuyue appeared at the top of one of the big trees, with Jian Wushuang right behind her.Ji Wuyue said indifferently, \u201cThen I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u201cJi Wuyue, you didn\u2019t tell us before that our task was to fight against Blood Feather Tower,\u201d said an aloof and thin young man.\u201cHow about double rewards after you finish the task?\u201d Ji Wuyue looked around with her cold and gloomy eyes.\u201cOK.\u201d Suddenly the experts who had felt dissatisfied before were nodding their heads with desire in their eyes.\u201cI need you guys to obstruct the experts from Blood Feather Tower for as long as you can. I also found some extra helpers for you.\u201dAfter saying that, Ji Wuyue looked up to the sky where seven figures rapidly skimmed over towards them.\u201cGolden-dragon Guards from the Golden-dragon Palace?\u201d When Bai Chong came to Tranquility Forest, he not only saw those extraordinary figures on the treetops but also noticed gold rings on their index fingers.Each of them wore a gold ring, the symbol of the Golden-dragon Guard.\u201cSir Bai Chong.\u201d Upon seeing their arrival Jian Wushuang felt pleasantly surprised, even though he was under the complete control of Ji Wuyue.\u201cJian Wushuang.\u201d Bai Chong glanced at him and then looked at Ji Wuyue with eyes suddenly becoming strange. \u201cAre you Ji Wumeng? No, you are not her. You are Ji Wuyue!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d Ji Wuyue nodded and said sternly, \u201cBai Chong, when my elder sister was alive, she was very kind to you and my brother-in-law also took you as his confidant. Now their son is in danger, won\u2019t you help him?\u201dBai Chong\u2019s face darkened and he looked at Jian Wushuang with a serious expression. \u201cTake him away right now. As for the people from Blood Feather Tower, I will try to obstruct them for a while,\u201d Bai Chong said in a low voice.\u201cThank you so much.\u201d After thanking him, Ji Wuyue looked at the burly man beside her and said, \u201cBu, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The burly man nodded and immediately took Jian Wushuang, jumping into the forest with Ji Wuyue.But just as they jumped into the forest, a chipper laugh burst between the sky and the earth.\u201cHa-ha, Ji Wumeng, where are you taking that little guy? Don\u2019t you want to take the antidote? Only I have the antidote, so you\u2019d better stay.\u201dThe voice was full of evil. After hearing the words, Ji Wuyue felt a slight chill but didn\u2019t intend to stop.After the laughter, a loud roar burst out. It was obvious that the two sides had collided.\u201cGolden-dragon Guard?\u201d\u201cMen from the Gladiator Arena? How dare you intercept our Blood Feather Tower?\u201d\u201cHumph, bastards of Blood Feather Tower. Do you think that our Gladiator Arena fears you?\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe war broke out instantly with roaring and shouting.In the forest.\u201cAre those people who want to kill me?\u201d Jian Wushuang could see several black-robed men behind them when he turned his head. Most of them wore silver masks and just a few wore golden masks.\u201cWhat the hell is going on? Those people are all here. What about Sword Marquis Mansion and Elder Hong?\u201d Jian Wushuang shouted anxiously.\u201cShut up,\u201d Ji Wuyue shouted loudly. She continued, unsympathetically, \u201cThese people are coming for you. Their arrival here means the battle in Sword Marquis Mansion has already finished. As for Elder Hong and the others, they are dead.\u201d\u201cDead?\u201d Jian Wushuang was stunned.\u201cAll five of them swallowed Scarlet Pills. It enhances their strength quickly by consuming the person\u2019s life. A Warrior can only swallow one Scarlet Pill in their lifetime because they are doomed to die after taking it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang was shocked. Finally, he understood why their strength had enhanced so much before. They had swallowed a Scarlet Pill and paid for it with their lives.\u201cWhy? Why?\u201d Jian Wushuang could not help roaring.\u201cWhy? Because you awoke the Sword Soul, and that\u2019s how things are now,\u201d said Ji Wuyue.\u201cSword Soul? What is Sword Soul?\u201d Jian Wushuang still felt baffled. He had no idea what she was talking about.\u201cIt seems that you haven\u2019t noticed. Right, you have just awoken it, it\u2019s normal that you don\u2019t know. But once your strength increases in the future you will notice the existence of Sword Soul,\u201d said Ji Wuyue.\u201cDo those people want to kill me just because I have awoken Sword Soul? What the hell is Sword Soul?\u201d Jian Wushuang roared.\u201cI don\u2019t know what Sword Soul is because neither I nor the others have awoken it. The only one who has awoken it is your father, Jian Nantian,\u201d Ji Wuyue said in an uncaring voice. \u201cHaven\u2019t you always wanted to know why your father left four years ago and disappeared without any news?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang glared and said, \u201cWas it because he also awoke Sword Soul?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ji Wuyue nodded, \u201cbut you are different. Your father awoke Sword Soul during the Gold Core period. It didn\u2019t take long before Blood Feather Tower came to kill your father after they heard that your father had awoken his Sword Soul. But they underestimated your father, which allowed him to escape by a fluke. And then your father was afraid of incriminating you and Sword Marquis Mansion, so he left and started living like a fugitive.\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201d Jian Wushuang hurriedly asked.\u201cNow? Your father has been caught by Blood Feather Tower. I don\u2019t know whether he is alive or not.\u201d Ji Wuyue shook her head with a wry smile, \u201cYou only care about your father. Don\u2019t you want to ask about your mother? Your mother\u2026\u201dWhile speaking, Ji Wuyue abruptly had a quiver and her extremely beautiful eyes soon became scarlet with violence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As for his mother\u2026 he had never seen her, and his father had never even mentioned her.So until now, he did not even know what his mother\u2019s name was.\u201cYou know my mother?\u201d Jian Wushuang was just about to ask. But all of a sudden, Ji Wuyue threw him directly to the burly man that was skittering beside her.\u201cWuyue, you\u2026\u201d The burly man took Jian Wushang very quickly and looked at Ji Wuyue at the same time. However, what he saw greatly shocked him.Ji Wuyue\u2019s veil had dropped, exposing a horrible face that was completely purulent, with blue veins surging upon its surface as if millions of insects had bitten her. Ji Wuyue roared out crazily and miserably, looking to be in extreme pain.\u201cDamn. Poisoning.\u201d The burly man, Bu\u2019s face became gloomy. \u201cThis didn\u2019t happen earlier, nor later, but now suddenly.\u201d\u201cPoisoning?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at Ji Wuyue in shock.\u201cJian Wushuang.\u201d A slightly crazy voice suddenly rushed out from Ji Wuyue\u2019s mouth. \u201cListen\u2026 Your mother, Ji Wumeng, was the eldest daughter of the Ji Clan. Three years ago, your father was hunted by Blood Feather Tower,\u00a0and having no other choice, he fled to the Ji Clan. In order to protect your father, the Ji clan went against Blood Feather Tower and resisted all the experts that they sent.\u201cIn the end\u2026\u201cYour mother was killed, your father was taken away by Blood Feather Tower, and our Ji Clan was extinguished. All of the families were slaughtered. I was the only one lucky enough to escape!\u201d\u201cSo you have to remember, you are not only the son of Jian Nantian, but also the last in the bloodline of the Ji Clan, except for me. You have to live well and grow up, improving your strength and ability so that you can destroy Blood Feather Tower and avenge my entire Ji Clan!\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026 there\u2026 and\u2026\u201d Ji Wuyue had an expression of madness as the extreme pain of the poisoning made her words continuously stutter. \u201cYou have to keep\u2026 Triple-kill\u2026 Sword\u2026 Well, your father\u2026 said that is\u2026 the token\u2026 enter into the Ancestors\u2019\u2026 Land!\u201dBy the end, Ji Wuyue\u2019s voice had already turned hysterical.\u201cGo! Bu, take him and go at once!\u201dJi Wuyue suddenly roared and shouted again.Bu looked into Ji Wuyue\u2019s eyes deeply, then carried Jian Wushuang on his back. \u201cGo!\u201d\u201cAunt. She is my aunt.\u201d Jian Wushuang finally understood who Ji Wuyue was. \u201cNo, take my aunt, we\u2019ll go together!\u201d\u201cOnce poisoned, Wuyue will instantly turn to unconscious madness and she will attack everyone. If we take her with us, none of us would be able to escape,\u201d Bu said in a low voice.\u201cEven so, we can not leave her behind,\u201d Jian Wushuang shouted.Bu turned a dark expression and slapped Jian Wushuang on the back of the neck, immediately knocking him unconscious.Taking the unconscious Jian Wushuang, Bu fled quickly fled from the area.Soon, a man in a purple coat from Blood Feather Tower found Ji Wuyue, who had gone crazy.\u201cHaha, Ji Wuyue, come and follow me obediently.\u201d\u201cOld bastard An Ying, you will meet a horrible end!\u201d\u2026Half a day later, the slaughter in Tranquility Forest had finally calmed down.Bones and corpses were all over the battlefield, and more than a dozen black-robed men and masks were standing there, led by the man in a purple coat.\u201cEven sending out more than 30 silver-masked assassins and three gold-masked assassins was not enough to kill the target. More than half of the silver-masked assassins were killed or injured, and even one of the gold-masked assassins died. So many losses, what do you have to show for it?\u201d The man in purple\u2019s expression became heavy.\u201cClatter, Clatter!\u201d The black-robed man immediately knelt down behind him.\u201cSend the order. Release the Scarlet Arrest Warrant all over Tianyan Province. You must find him, even if you must completely turn Tianyan Province upside-down,\u201d the man in purple said in a chilling tone.\u201cYes,\u201d answered those black-robed men immediately.\u201cAlthough we did not kill the target this time, catching Ji Wuyue counts for a little bit.\u201d The man in purple muttered, \u201cWith Ji Wuyue, I am not afraid that Jian Nantian will not speak.\u201d\u2026After the tragic battle, the entire Sword Marquis Mansion was in ruins, and the atmosphere was extremely depressing.Every corpse was moved to the back of the central Drill Ground\u2014up to 100 corpses at a glance.A large number of the disciples in Sword Marquis Mansion stood on the edge of the Drill Ground, looking at the hundred corpses, each one of them with an ugly face.\u201cMansion Master, the casualties have been counted,\u201d said an Elder of Red Martial Hall, coming over to Jian Xinhong.\u201cFine, go on then.\u201dJian Xinhong\u2019s pale face, and the trace of blood at the corner of his mouth, showed that he had obviously been through a great battle and was seriously injured.\u201cEight experts above the Spiritual Sea Realm died. Four of them are the four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion, the rest are the Servants of Sword Pavilion,\u201d that Elder said.\u201cAll of them are from Sword Pavilion?\u201d Jian Xinhong eyes stared and he asked again, \u201cWhat about the dead disciples?\u201d\u201cThere were 94 disciples of the Spirit Path that died. Most of those disciples did not take the initiative to join the war. Instead, they were helplessly dragged into it. The youngest of them was only 12, and had just gathered Spiritual Power,\u201d the Elder replied, with a trace of grief.Hearing the number of casualties, Jian Xinhong was shocked from head to toe. His face became green and then turned pale. After a long time, he sighed deeply and said, \u201cBury them well!\u201dIn the Drill Ground, there were several other people standing there who looked very dismal as well. They were Bai Chong and others from the Gladiator Arena.But the gold-robed servants that followed Bai Chong had decreased from six to three.Bai Chong was looking at the corpses spread all over the ground, and his right hand could not help touching his left sleeve, which was empty and covered in blood, impressively lacking an arm.\u201cJian Nantian and Ji Wumeng, I no longer owe you a debt of gratitude!\u201dOn this day, with the sudden outbreak of war, even the forces of all the parties involved were not clear about it. The result was\u2026In the Sword Marquis Mansion, the Four Great Elders of the Sword Pavilion had all died!Jiu Jun had died!The four Servants of the Sword Pavilion and nearly a hundred ordinary disciples of the Spirit Path were implicated and killed as well, the youngest of whom was only 12 years old.Sword Marquis Mansion was full of countless wounded.Of the six gold-robed servants from the Gladiator Arena\u2014three died and the other three were all seriously injured.Bai Chong had lost an arm!Ji Wuyue was captured alive!What a tragedy!

He threw a piece of meat to Jian Wushuang and said, \u201cYou must be hungry after being unconscious for so long. Come on.\u201d\u201cMy name is Sima Bu, but people call me Bu. You can call me elder brother Bu,\u201d he said.\u201cBrother Bu,\u201d Jian Wushuang called out and immediately asked him, \u201cWhere is my aunt?\u201d\u201cJi Wuyue?\u201d Sima Bu shook his head and heaved a deep sigh. \u201cShe should have been caught by Blood Feather Tower. They are heartless and cruel. She would come to a sticky end.\u201d\u201cAsshole!\u201d cursed Jian Wushuang.\u201cBoy, your name is Jian Wushuang, right? Although you are young, you have caused Blood Feather Tower to appoint so many people to kill you.\u201d Sima Bu sighed and said, \u201cBut you seem to be at a loss.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m puzzled. Up to this point, all I know is that I have awakened my Sword Soul. So they want to chase me down, just as they chased my father years ago. That\u2019s why he left Sword Marquis Mansion. But what is a Sword Soul?\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned.\u201cSword Soul? I haven\u2019t heard of it. But if Blood Feather Tower wants to kill you and your father so recklessly because of this Sword Soul, and they even slaughtered the Ji Clan without hesitation, then it must be important,\u201d Sima Bu said.\u201cEldest brother Bu, since you have a deep relationship with my aunt, you must know something about her, the Ji Clan, and Blood Feather Tower. Please tell me something,\u201d Jian Wushuang pleaded seriously.\u201cWe have been on many adventures together, and we were like Damon and Pythias, but I don\u2019t know much about her. However, I do know something about the Ji Clan and Blood Feather Tower,\u201d Sima Bu answered at once.\u201cWhen it comes to Blood Feather Tower and the Ji Clan, we have to start with the general pattern of the Tianzong Dynasty.\u201d\u201cThe Tianzong Dynasty has a vast territory with 16 provinces, and each province has many commanderies. For example, Tianyan Province has 108 commanderies, and Bashui Commandery is only one of them. So you can imagine how wide the Tianzong Dynasty is. Although the Sword Marquis Mansion that you belong to is the most powerful, compared to the whole Tianzong Dynasty, it is so weak that it can\u2019t even be regarded as a third-rate power.\u201dAn amazing gleam appeared into Jian Wushuang\u2019s eye, but it soon disappeared.Indeed, it was only in Bashui Commandery that Sword Marquis Mansion was a top power. In the entire Tianzong Dynasty, it was not. Even in Tianyan Province, there were countless powers stronger than Mansion of Sword Marquis. For example, the Tianyuan Sword Sect, one of the five Sects in Tianyan Province, was not something that the Sword Marquis Mansion could compare to.\u201cThe three Hegemons in the Tianzong Dynasty are Golden-dragon Palace, the Gladiator Arena, and Blood Feather Tower.\u201d Sima Bu continued.\u201cThe ruler of Golden-dragon Palace is the Monarch of the Tianzong Dynasty. Branches of Golden-dragon Palace can be found all over the Tianzong Dynasty. Although its power is overwhelming, it isn\u2019t restrained by the Golden-dragon Guard like me and your aunt, Ji Wuyue.\u201cThe power of the Gladiator Arena, the biggest chamber of commerce, is everywhere in the Tianzong Dynasty. It is said that the Gladiator Arena has the support of the imperial household, which must be the prince.\u201cThe last one is Blood Feather Tower!\u201cEveryone that wanders around the Tianzong Dynasty knows about and fears Blood Feather Tower. It is the number one assassin organization recognized by the public. There are a large number of invisible assassins. These assassins are divided into four levels. Copper, silver, gold, and purple. Silver masks generally have cultivation in the Gold Core Realm. Gold masks are at the peak of the Gold Core Realm. And purple masks are supreme experts in the legendary Yin-Yang Void Realm.\u201cThis time, dozens of silver-masked assassins and three gold-masked assassins chased us down.\u201cWhat I talked about was the Three Hegemons with terrible strength who stood in the first echelons of the Tianzong Dynasty. The ancient Eight Clans were second to them.\u201cIt is said that the Eight Clans were passed down since the establishment of the Tianzong Dynasty, ancient and culturally-rich. One of them, the Ji Clan, was wiped out three years ago, which shook the whole Tianzong Dynasty. All the powers were curious about the reason. However, they were killed because of granting asylum to your father,\u201d Sima Bu said and sighed.\u201cWhat about my aunt? What about the poison in her body?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked sullen.\u201cIt is called Heart-biting Poison and it\u2019s very poisonous, enough to completely destroy a person gradually. When I saw her three years ago, she was poisoned and it would occasionally attack her. When it does, she suffers unprecedented pain that directly destroys her mind. She will refuse to have anything to do with her kin or friends, only understanding to crazily kill. I have seen it several times, it\u2019s so miserable!\u201cThe attack of the poison manifests suddenly, without any regularity. She was trying to save you this time, but it so happened that the poison attacked, alas!\u201d Sima Bu sighed gently, and said slowly, \u201cThe poison quickly makes her fall into madness. If we took her, we could not have escaped, so\u2026\u201dSaying this, Sima Bu looked pale.He and Ji Wuyue had gone through many things together, and they had a deep relationship. He would have never left without her unless there was no choice.\u201cWho? Who poisoned my aunt?\u201d asked Jian Wushuang.\u201cI know. It was An Ying, the Hall Master of Blood Feather Tower in Tianyan Province. He was among the assassins this time,\u201d said Sima Bu.\u201cAn Ying? Good, I will remember him.\u201d\u201cNot only him, but also Blood Feather Tower!\u201dJian Wushuang raised his head and his eyes were filled with unprecedented killing intent. He did not know his lot before, but now, he knew everything.His mother was the firstborn daughter of the Ji Clan. He had the blood of the Ji Clan. That is to say, he bore the blood feud of the Ji Clan.In order to protect his father, the entire Ji Clan was killed.His father, who had been caught by Blood Feather Tower, could be dead or alive.His aunt, persecuted by Blood Feather Tower, was suffering from severe pain. Now, in order to save him, she had been caught by them.With the awakening of his Sword Soul, the experts of Blood Feather Tower had come to kill him for the first time\u2026 All of the culprits were from Blood Feather Tower!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was apparent that he had already calmed himself down.\u201cFor me, Blood Feather Tower is a genuine colossus and I can\u2019t compete with them at my present strength. So I must endure for now.\u201d\u201cEndure, hide and wait!\u201dJian Wushuang held his hands so tightly that his nails dug into his palm until he was bleeding.Although his heart was full of killing intent, he needed to restrain his sharp edge.\u201cIn addition to revenge, I also have to find a solution to make all these things clear,\u201d Jian Wushuang growled.Although he now knew his own lot and the huge blood debt that was on his shoulders, he still had many doubts in his heart.For example, what on earth was Sword Soul?Why had Blood Feather Tower tried to kill him and his father, who had awakened their Sword Souls, regardless of everything?In addition, what was the Ancestor\u2019s Land that his aunt, Ji Wuyue, told him about with her last words?There were many, many doubts that he slowly needed to explore.\u201cStrength\u2026 In the final analysis, my strength was so weak that I had no ability to stand against Blood Feather Tower when it chased after me to kill me. I only survived by good luck with the help of my aunt and Elder Hong, who sacrificed themselves for me!\u201cIf my strength had been great enough that Blood Feather Tower feared me and did not even dare to offend me, then none of this would have happened!\u201cStrength! Strength!\u201dJian Wushuang growled crazily in his heart.He had never had a thirst for strength as great as he did now. Even before, when he was betrayed by Jian Meng\u2019er, he had not come to this point.After all, he fought with Jian Meng\u2019er for his own dignity, for his father\u2019s dignity, and for the dignity of the Sword Pavilion. But with Blood Feather Tower, it was a blood feud that would never stop until death.In such an unprecedented desire for strength, even Jian Wushuang himself did not realize that the Spiritual Power in his body had sprung up at that moment, and the Heavenly Creation Skill had operated naturally.Heavenly Creation Skill, the Technique of Claiming.Suddenly\u2026 \u201cOm!\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s body suddenly shuddered, with a sense of amazement in his eyes, followed by surprise.\u201cHas the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path been broken through? So unbelievable.\u201dEven Jian Wushuang did not think that his cultivation would naturally make a breakthrough while he was full of an unprecedented desire for strength. It must be known that, just a few days ago, he relied on absorbing a large amount of Primordial Spiritual Liquid to promote himself to the Eighth Heaven of the Divine Path.And now, just a few days later, a huge breakthrough had directly been made.The Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path was equivalent to the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm of common Warriors. So that, along with the advantage of the Heavenly Creation Skill on strength, even if he did not use the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, his Spiritual Power would not be weaker than Jian Meng\u2019er, who had achieved the peak of the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm.His strength had risen again!\u201cThe Heavenly Creation Skill is so amazing.\u201d Jian Wushuang could not help thinking that, and was more confident with his future growth.The Blood Feather Tower was indeed a colossus for him now, but in the future, it might not be.\u201cMy father, my mother, my aunt, the Four Elders, the Ji Clan, and all the innocent people who have been implicated in this fight for me\u2014I, Jian Wushuang, will bet all of myself to assure you that, in my lifetime, I will certainly slaughter Blood Feather Tower and uproot it. I will avenge you!\u201dJian Wushuang, with cold eyes, had a determination that ran deep in his blood!\u2026The next morning\u2014\u201cBoy, you stay here and wait for me while I go to the nearby cities to fish for information,\u201d Sima Bu said.\u201cOk.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded, he also knew that Blood Feather Tower would not take things lying down.Jian Wushuang stayed in the cave alone and cultivated quietly. After about an hour, Sima Bu came back.\u201cBrother Bu, how is it going?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked immediately.\u201cThe situation is a lot worse than I thought. I walked around in a nearby city and there were no less than 10 assassins from Blood Feather Tower that I was aware of, as well as those who were hidden deep inside, so there must have been more that I couldn\u2019t find. What\u2019s more, I went to a secret intelligence station of the Golden-Dragon Palace and learned that Blood Feather Tower has issued a Scarlet Arrest Warrant for you. Now there are many scouts from Blood Feather Tower lurking around all the big cities, only waiting for you to appear,\u201d Sima Bu said solemnly.\u201cIt can be said that Blood Feather Tower has formed a tight dragnet in Bashui Commandery, even in the entire Tianyan Province. So if you did appear, you would be killed by the experts of Blood Feather Tower without any ability to struggle. And with the intelligence capabilities of Blood Feather Tower, even if you bring a mask or camouflage your appearance, you will be noticed immediately by them as long as there is the slightest trace or flaw.\u201cI was going to bring you back to Golden-dragon Palace in Bashui Commandery to accomplish this task, but now it seems impossible,\u201d said Sima Bu.\u201cI can\u2019t stay in Bashui Commandery for now.\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a low tone, \u201cNot even Tianyan Province is safe. I must leave quickly.\u201d\u201cYou are right.\u201d Sima Bu nodded. \u201cI realized it out on my way back. Right now, Blood Feather Tower is mainly focused on killing you inside of Tianyan Province, where it is difficult for you to survive. But in other provinces, you still have space to live, and the most suitable for you is Tiannan Province, located in the surrounding area of Tianyan Province.\u201cTiannan Province is one of the main provinces where the Gladiator Arena operates, so the forces of Blood Feather Tower are not very strong there. It\u2019s the most suitable place for you to go. But the road from Bashui Commandery to Tiannan Province is relatively long and it requires passing through the Dark Forest.\u201d\u201cThe Dark Forest?\u201d Jian Wushuang gazed slightly.He had also heard of the Dark Forest, which is a vast forest between Tianyan Province and Tiannan Province. It was famous as a dangerous place full of spirit beasts and crisis.\u201cThen, I will go to Tiannan Province.\u201d Jian Wushuang said seriously, \u201cAs for the Dark Forest, I\u2019ll just have passed through it.\u201d\u201cHaha, you are young, but you have great courage. Don\u2019t worry, I will go to Tiannan Province with you and escort you through the Dark Forest safely.\u201d Sima Bu laughed.\u201cEven without you, I still have to go through the Dark Forest.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes sparkled with energy.Tiannan Province was his only chance to live and no one could stand in the way of his survival.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If Jian Wushuang wanted to go to Tiannan Province, he had to go through the Dark Forest.The first day after setting foot in the Dark Forest\u2014Deep in the thick jungle\u2014\u201cHowl!\u201dAfter roaring, a blue shadow jumped out as if it was a Ghost, rushing at Jian Wushuang and Sima Bu directly. Both of them responded quickly, and they easily moved away from the beast.\u201cIt\u2019s a Scarlet Leopard, no wonder it moved so fast,\u201d said Sima Bu with a low voice, looking at the spirit beast which suddenly attacked them.\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d Jian Wushuang said with piercing eyesight. He pulled his Triple-kill Sword from behind, and the sword light moved straight toward the Scarlet Leopard.\u201cBe careful, this Scarlet Leopard has reached the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm\u2026\u201d Sima Bu had only just reminded him, then Jian Wushuang showed off his unparalleled sword light the next moment.The sword light was like snow, and on such a boundless ground, broke out its Spiritual Power all of a sudden.\u201cClang! Clang! Clang!\u201dAfter a series of three swords split out, each sword light looked so beautiful. At that time, the Scarlet Leopard also charged forward\u2014its four hooves, trampling heavily on the ground, then turned into lightning, rushing toward Jian Wushuang fiercely.\u201cChi!\u201dAt that moment, the brilliant sword light easily ripped a huge hole in the Scarlet Leopard\u2019s body, and the Scarlet Leopard\u2019s belly began to bleed as all its internal organs began falling out everywhere, which lead to its immediate death.\u201cToo weak.\u201d Jian Wushuang glanced at the body of the Scarlet Leopard, and sympathetically shook his head.Compared with humans, spirit beasts at the same level were indeed more powerful. However, when it was under the condition of slaughtering, it entirely depended on the instinct of the spirit beast, which was far less than a cultivating Human Warrior with Martial Arts Techniques.\u201cI have broken through the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path. My Spiritual Power could be compared to the highest Level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, but by virtue of my swordsmanship, spirit beasts in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm are not a threat to me at all. If it was a Spirit Beast in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, there may have been some pressure on me,\u201d Jian Wushuang said, with a glimmer of anticipation in his eyes.There were not many things in the Dark Forest, but there were many spirit beasts.Here, there were countless spirit beasts in the Spiritual Sea Realm, and there were even quite a few spirit beasts in the Gold Core Realm. With so many strong Spirit Beasts, it could serve as an excellent cultivating place as well as a dangerous spot at the same time.\u201cAh! Excellent swordsmanship, boy!\u201d Sima Bu came over, glancing at Jian Wushuang with astonishment. \u201cIn addition, your Cultivation is not bad as well. How did you kill that Scarlet Leopard, in the\u00a0Profound Spiritual Sea Realm, in an instant? Also, how old are you this year?\u201d\u201cSixteen.\u201d Jian Wushuang told him his true age.Sima Bu stared at him.\u201cBrother Bu, from now on, if it\u2019s not necessary, you do not have to fight. I can take charge of killing the spirit beasts on the way through the Dark Forest,\u201d Jian Wushuang solemnly said.\u201cNo problem. Sounds good to me.\u201d Sima Bu nodded with a smile, with no need to explain more since he knew Jian Wushuang\u2019s purpose.Half a day later\u2014\u201cBoy, be cautious. What you are facing now is a Spurting Mouse in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. It is not only fast but also has a body that\u2019s extremely hard, except for its eyes. But its means of attack are very simple. And that is its teeth, which are very sharp and can easily crunch rigid bluestones. Therefore, you\u2019d better protect yourself from being bitten.\u201d Sima Bu reminded him off to the side.Jian Wushuang stared at the Spurting Mouse in front of him, a small but oppressive figure that had eyes blazing with ferocity.\u201cFrizzle!\u201dThe Spurting Mouse made a whinny sound, then its body immediately burst out in the form of a Flowing Light.\u201cPurple Fire Sword Art!\u201dJian Wushuang, who became hot-tempered, used the Triple-kill Sword with a baking-hot Sword Edge, and instantaneously slaughtered the Spurting Mouse.Such a fierce fight.Because the body of the Spurting Mouse was so stiff, it was not hurt too much by Jian Wushuang, either by his Long Sword or the straight stab. The only vulnerability of\u00a0the Spurting Mouse was its eyes. However, the target was too small and moved so fast. It was actually quite difficult to attack it. At last, Jian Wushuang was forced to use the First Move of Anonymous Sword Art, Blood Shadow. He swept his sword toward the Spurting Mouse with an astonishing speed. With this move, he successfully killed it.Unfortunately, the Spurting Mouse had also bitten off a large piece of flesh from his shoulder. It was such a painful wound.\u201cCarry on!\u201dSimply bandaging the wound on his shoulder, Jian Wushuang recovered his Spiritual Power and he continued on his way.That night, the moonlight was so bright but it did not reach into the forest. The complete darkness in the Dark Forest was horrible.Later, in the treetops of a large tree lay Sima Bu, dangling a weed and laying on his hands while his eyes looked at Jian Wushuang, who was cultivating under the tree from time to time.\u201cHow hardworking this little guy is. He is so strict with himself.\u201d Sima Bu laughed secretly.Although he had entered the Dark Forest only one day ago, Sima Bu felt the instinctive madness in Jian Wushuang.In just one day\u2019s time, Jian Wushuang had gone through a full eight battles, of which six opponents were spirit beasts in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm, while the other two were in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.With Jian Wushuang\u2019s present strength, it would be extremely fierce to fight with spirit beasts in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm without using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill. Like today, when fighting with a spirit beast in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, although Jian Wushuang had successfully killed one of them, he himself did not escape unharmed.A large chunk of flesh was bitten off his shoulder, and another spirit beast in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm scratched him above his chest with its sharp claws, leaving a very clear bloody paw print.In fact, as extremely numerous as spirit beasts were in the Dark Forest, it was impossible to encounter so many spirit beasts in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm on the first day. This occurred because Jian Wushuang deliberately searched for those spirit beasts.As for other Warriors, they tended to avoid meeting spirit beasts that had mighty strength. However, Jian Wushuang was deliberately looking for these powerful spirit beasts to battle with them.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a bit crazy, he has improved through these experiences. What\u2019s more, his swordsmanship is really good,\u201d Sima Bu said to himself.\u201cSwordsmanship?\u201d Sima Bu was suddenly a little touched, but he became absorbed in thought the next moment.Early the next morning, Jian Wushuang gradually opened his eyes with a trace of joy.After one night, his Spiritual Power was refined a bit, and although his overall strength had not improved, at least he was making progress every day. The life-or-death fights in the Dark Forest with Spirit Beasts had also greatly promoted his swordsmanship.\u201cCarry on today\u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang gripped his hands tightly. A madness shined deep in his eyes that had not even slightly weakened. Instead, it had become a little more powerful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Covered in greenish black scales, it dashed toward the shadow, using its giant arms that were notorious for their outrageous strength.The moment that the sword shadow was smashed and scattered, another three sword lights flashed almost simultaneously\u2026It had already been six days since Jian Wushuang entered the Dark Forest. During his search in the Dark Forest over the past five days, he had undergone dozens of battles. Some of which were fiercely dangerous, especially when battling against spirit beasts in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm and the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.Compared to five days ago, his swordsmanship appeared much sharper and he had gained much more fighting experience.Except for the one battle in the Gladiator Arena, Jian Wushuang had grown up training in Sword Marquis Mansion. He had no previous fighting experience with anyone before that. But now, his previous disadvantage in experience was being made up for.\u201cClang!\u201dThe fleeting and flickering shiny Sword Edge eluded the Golden Gibbon\u2019s eyes, directly puncturing its throat with an amazing piercing force.Rumbling\u2026 Its blood continued to spew out as its huge body instantly fell down.\u201cGreat, that is the seventh spirit beast in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm that you have killed these last few days,\u201d said Sima Bu, walking up with a smile. \u201cYour Spiritual Power still needs to improve some more before it can reach the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm, but your swordsmanship has become more refined after several days of fighting.\u201d\u201cI still have a long way to go,\u201d said Jian Wushuang, shaking his head without any sense of pride. \u201cI\u2019m still far from having enough fighting experience. By virtue of my mastery in swordsmanship, I can now get rid of some inexperienced spirit beasts in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm. However, I have to flee instantly once I encounter stronger spirit beasts because I\u2019m still unable to use my strength to the fullest.\u201cIf only I were more experienced in battle and more adept at swordsmanship\u2026\u201d said Jian Wushuang, holding his hands tightly.\u201cDon\u2019t aim too high. After all, you are not even in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm, yet you already have such awesome battle strength,\u201d said Sima Bu. Then he suddenly added, \u201cThese days, I\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019re highly gifted in swordsmanship, and I have something that might be useful to you. I am giving it to you for Ji Wuyue\u2019s sake.\u201dSima Bu immediately turned his right hand upward, unfolding a yellow wire-bound book.\u201cWhat?\u201d said Jian Wushuang with a little surprise, then he stared at the gold ring that was always on the ring finger of Sima Bu\u2019s right hand. \u201cIs that an Interspatial Ring?\u201d he asked suspiciously.Just as its name suggested, an Interspatial Ring contained a separate space for holding things.There was nothing else in his hand, but how did the book appear as he flipped his hand over? It went without saying that it must have been an Interspatial Ring.\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s an Interspatial Ring,\u201d said Sima Bu with a smile. \u201cPresented by Gold-Dragon Palace, called the Gold-dragon Ring, and symbolizing the Gold-dragon Guard. If you\u2019re interested in this and go there by any chance, you\u2019ll be given a Gold-dragon Ring by Gold-Dragon Palace only after you complete the task to become a Gold-dragon Guard. \u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Jian Wushuang became excited.\u201cAnyway, I obtained this book by chance. First, you should read it carefully, as you can benefit from what this expert in Sword Principles had learned. By the way, he is a Supreme expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm,\u201d said Sima Bu.\u201cInsight into Sword Principles from an expert? And left by a Supreme expert?\u201d asked Jian Wushuang with a serious look.The Seven Ranks of the Spirit Path, the Transcending Sea Realm, the Primordial Gold Core Realm, and the Yin-Yang Void Realm\u2026 Among these, the Primordial Gold Core Realm already linked to the strongest, the Yin-Yang Void Realm, and a Supreme expert, who was also rare in the whole Tianzong Dynasty.Was it Sword Principle insights left by such a Supreme Expert?Jian Wushuang immediately took the book and began to read it carefully.It did not mention the name of the Supreme Expert, but it spoke of his insights in Sword Principle, as well as his views related to swordsmanship.Sword Principle can be broken into two parts. Sword Arts, which are merely the form of swordsmanship, and Sword Essence, which is required for real swordsmanship. Combining both will give you insight into Sword Principle.In fact, that book respectively introduced Sword Principle, starting with the Sword Arts chapter, then progressing to the second chapter, Sword Essence.Jian Wushuang first absorbed the Sword Arts Chapter.\u201cIf a swordsman depends on sophisticated, but formal and stiff, Sword Arts, there is no difference for him between normal and average Sword Arts. While an expert can easily surpass his rivals. Even if they are thousands of times stronger than him, as long as he is more adept at using his Sword Arts, and even if his Sword Arts are of a lower class.\u201dThe pages of the Sword Arts Chapter could be counted on one\u2019s fingers. And all they spoke of was the common sense of Sword Principle. But what made the book different, lay in the fact that its creator seemed to despise all Sword Arts in the universe. He even held the belief that Sword Arts were insignificant to Sword Principle.\u201cThis senior seems biased against Sword Arts. Admittedly, I do agree with his view on various Sword Arts, but not on his thoughts that Sword Arts mean nothing to a Warrior and can be ignored,\u201d Jian Wushuang thought.His training began with Sword Arts at an early age, and he believed that it very helpful to a Warrior.After all, it was Sword Arts that had defeated Jian Meng\u2019er and Ye Mo in the Sword Marquis Token Battle.And, it was also Sword Arts that helped him battle spirit beasts of the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm in the Dark Forest, even making it possible to kill those beasts in the end.Without Sword Arts, he would, at most, have only been a match for spirit beasts at the Peak of the Profound Transforming Sea Realm by virtue of his unique Heavenly Creation Skill. Even then, it is uncertain who would have won.Shaking his head secretly, Jian Wushuang turned his eyes to the Sword Essence Chapter instead of the Sword Arts Chapter.\u201cSword Essence was divided into two sections as well. In one, Sword Principle was used to accompany and enhance one\u2019s swordsmanship\u2014Stronger swordsmanship means stronger Sword Essence.\u201cIn the second section, Sword Essence was used to shape the Essences of Heaven and Earth through comprehension.\u201cThere many Essences in the universe, including the immense Earth, raging flames, and the wind, everywhere in our lives\u2026 They are all part of the strength of the universe and nature. These Essences can be shaped by using one\u2019s Sword Essence and greatly sharpening one\u2019s swordsmanship through comprehension. Upon reaching a high enough level, any move with his sword can surpass both First-class Sword Arts and even Legendary Sword Arts.\u201cThere are many different kinds of Sword Essence, such as the Sword Essence of Gale, the Sword Essence of Raging Fire, the Sword Essence of Earth, and Sword Essence of the Waterdrop\u2026\u201dThe contents of the Sword Essence Chapter were more sophisticated and detailed than the plain introduction in the Sword Arts Chapter. And, Jian Wushuang was totally immersed in its contents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But I didn\u2019t understand what Sword Essence really indicated until now. I finally know that Sword Essence is formed by comprehending the Essence of Heaven and Earth.\u201cYes, in fact, it is a matter of understanding and using the natural power of Heaven and Earth. Watch this.\u201dSima bu said, then smiled and abruptly pulled out the sabre at his waist, immediately attacking a rock that was several meters away.A sharp crack appeared on the rock and a large amount of rubble fell.\u201cI didn\u2019t use the Essences of Heaven and Earth just now. but now, I will try again with the Essence of Heaven and Earth. Make sure you watch.\u201d\u00a0Immediately, Sima Bu split the rock again.Jian Wushuang sensed a strong and fiery power this time when the rock was attacked.\u201cWas that the Essence of Heaven and Earth?\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s heartbeat quickened.Peng!The rock shattered and a large amount of rubble fell.Jian Wushuang was astonished to see such a large difference.The difference was humongous.One attack only caused a crack in the rock while the other blew the entire rock into pieces.\u201cIs this the difference between a normal attack and an attack using the Essence of Heaven and Earth?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Essences of Heaven and Earth are the powers of nature, which can be guided by both Sword Warriors and Blade Warriors. However, I have only mastered superficial knowledge. Otherwise, the power would have been much stronger,\u201d said Sima Bu.\u201cActually, for Warriors, they would try to master Essences of Heaven and Earth after reaching the Gold Core Realm. Once he mastered a hint of Sword Essence or Blade Essence, his strength would explode.\u201d\u201cOnce, I met a super genius who was talented in swordsmanship, like you. At that time, he had just entered the Gold Core Realm, but he had deep comprehension in three different Sword Essences at the same time, which helped him to kill an expert Warrior at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang was stunned.Everyone knows, the distance in power between each level only gets larger as their strength progresses.The distance between the Initial Gold Core Realm and the Exceptional Gold Core Realm was so large that even a genius who possessed a Heaven defying Cultivation Method, like the Heavenly Creation Skill, still couldn\u2019t compare with someone at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.However, because that exceptional genius reached a high Level of understanding in Sword Essences, he was able to kill someone in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm with only one stroke.Just a single stroke!\u201cSword Essence is that terrifying?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked in shock.\u201cYour Spiritual Power is still too low to progress to the Gold Core Realm, but after these few days, I noticed that you are very talented in swordsmanship. So, I decided to give you this book in the hope that you can learn Sword Essence earlier. It depends on whether you yourself can actually comprehend it,\u201d Sima Bu said.\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.When he saw the chapter on Sword Essence, he knew there was a large difference someone who comprehended the Essences of Heaven and Earth and someone who did not. He was full of longing and expectation towards the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.And that chapter also introduced the methods for comprehending the Essences of Heaven and Earth in great detail.\u2026Even after this day, Jian Wushuang continued searching and battling with powerful spirit beasts at the Profound Transforming Sea Realm and Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm in the Dark Forest. But obviously, he spent more time studying Sword Essence than he had previously.Inside an open canyon of the Dark Forest, Jian Wushuang stood alone with his eyes closed and his Long Sword held out. He had been holding this position for half an hour.With the breeze whisking by his body repeatedly, he quietly attempted to feel the power of the wind in the surrounding the area.\u201cThe wind \u2026 is invisible, but ubiquitous.\u201dUnexpectedly, the Long Sword in his hand began to sweep slowly upwards.Very slowly, very lightly, each move followed the strength of the wind that flowed in the surrounding area.With a trace of a smile on his face, Jian Wushuang very clearly sensed the power of the surrounding wind, as well as the lightness of the wind\u2026 Gradually, a trace of enlightenment grew in his heart as the speed of his sword increased.At this time, Sima bu was sitting arbitrarily on a rock near the open space. Occasionally, Jian Wushuang would glance in his direction.\u201cThis kid has begun to ponder Sword Essence, but is it so easy to comprehend?\u201d Sima Mabu shook his head and could not help laughing in the heart.One must know that to comprehend the Blade Essence of Raging Fire, he had ventured alone to a desolate and huge volcano. He lived there for a full three years, day and night, feeling the turbulent flames. Finally, he grasped a trace of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire, which was considered very lucky compared to the unfortunate experts in the Gold Core Realm who worked hard their whole life without ever being able to feel a trace of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.Even though Jian Wushuang was born with talent in Sword Principle, it would still take a long time for him to comprehend Sword Essence.But, at this moment \u2026\u201cHmmm? How is that possible?\u201d Sima Bu looked up unexpectedly, feeling completely astonished by what he was seeing.Jian Wushuang was still practicing his swordsmanship at this moment, but the speed of his sword gradually became surprisingly fast, so much that even Sima Bu could only see the flickering sword light.\u201cHe is drawing his sword so quickly\u2026 And he is doing it freestyle, without using Sword Arts, ah?\u201d Sima Bu\u00a0was shocked.He did not use Sword Arts to enhance the speed, like the Aurora Sword Art or Flowing Light Sword Art. He was just practicing freestyle, but it was still so fast. What does it mean?\u201cThe sword flows with the wind, the wind\u00a0becomes the sword!\u201d\u201cThe Sword Principle of Gale! He comprehended it!\u201d Sima Bu was dumbstruck immediately.Note that it was only yesterday when he gave the book to Jian Wushuang. Also, he only learned of the existence of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth yesterday\u2026Today he comprehended the Sword Principle of Gale from the Essences of Heaven and Earth.\u201cWhat speed is that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have grasped the Sword Principle of Gale today even though you just learned of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth yesterday. Your talent completely outmatches the exceptional genius I mentioned to you earlier. If I\u2019m not mistaken, although your natural talent is good, part of it must have to do with your awakening of the Sword Soul. \u201d\u201cSword Soul?\u201d Jian Wushuang felt a tremor in his heart, then nodded, quietly approving.Indeed, when practicing his swordsmanship, he also realized that something inside him helped him comprehend the Essences of Heaven and Earth. Even though it was difficult for others, he could easily grasp the Sword Essence of Gale.But what was it inside him that helped him comprehend the Essences of Heaven and Earth?Undoubtedly, it must be because of his Sword Soul awakening.Sword Soul. Something that drove Blood Feather Tower to chase after him desperately.\u00a0Naturally, it must be extraordinary.It was due to the Sword Soul that he could immediately and swiftly comprehend a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale.\u201cAnyhow, I have already grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale. With it, my swordsmanship should be several times or even dozens of times more skillful than before.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought with a bright look in his eyes.Only a trace of Sword Essence of Gale could easily make his sword several times faster once it was integrated into his swordsmanship.Such an increase in speed also helped sharpen his swordsmanship, greatly contributing to its piercing force.It would cause his level of swordsmanship to increase immensely.\u201cLet me test it against a Spirit Beast first!\u201d Jian Wushuang thought quietly.Shortly after, he fought with a huge Iron-backed Bear.Its force was extremely dreadful and absolutely the most formidable Spirit Beast in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.If he had encountered this huge Iron-backed Bear before grasping a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, Jian Wushuang would have had no choice but to flee in a disorderly manner. However, now he did not even show a trace of fear.\u201cKill!\u201dAfter releasing a low howl, with his eyes blazing like torches, Jian Wushuang waved his sword. Sword light flashed out across the air for several meters before finally striking the huge body of the Iron-backed Bear directly.The sword light was so fleeting that the Iron-backed Bear didn\u2019t even realize its body was had been injured at first. Instantly, a flood of fresh blood poured out from the sword scar on its body.Though the sword scar was nothing to its huge body and strong defense, it was definitely enough to enrage the Iron-backed Bear.\u201cHowl!\u201dThe howl from the Iron-backed Bear\u2019s mouth echoed in the surroundings. Its two giant feet stamped on the ground as it made great strides towards Jian Wushuang. Every step forward produced a minor tremor.\u201cGo to hell, human!\u201dThe dark golden eyes of the Iron-backed Bear were a bloody color and its desire to kill Jian Wushuang increased dramatically.\u201cHaha, come on.\u201dJian Wushuang began to laugh loudly while moving his sword to fight against it.After a while, a cold and dazzling sword light directly penetrated it\u2019s defense and plunged into its throat.\u201cIron-backed Bears are formidable in both power and defense, but their speed is very slow. Now that I have grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, I can easily surpass it in speed. There is no chance for it to resist against my absolute advantage in speed. \u201d Jian Wushuang smiled secretly.Iron-backed Bears, the most formidable Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm. Now, they could easily be slain by Jian Wushuang.\u201cContinue\u2026\u201dNext, the tests progressed forward\u00a0as he battled one formidable Spirit Beasts after another.Such as Purple Crystal-Winged Lions, Phantom Foxes, Gibbon-shaped Wolverines, Nine Poisons Pythons and so on.The most formidable Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm became the opponents of Jian Wushuang and were eventually killed by him.Time flew by. It had already been one month since Jian Wushuang entered the Dark Forest.The Dark Forest covered an abundantly immense area, stretching across two provinces. Although he had already traveled for a month, Jian Wushuang still had a long way to go before he would reach the Tiannan Province.With his hands crossed, in the darkness of the forest, Sima Bu gravely stared at Jian Wushuang, who was practicing his swordsmanship in front of him.In his eyes, he could clearly perceive that every one of Jian Wushuang\u2019s extremely heavy moves interacted and integrated with the earth.\u201cSword Essence of Earth!\u201d\u201cHe has just grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, but in less than a month after that, he seems to have also grasped the Sword Essence of Earth!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable, it\u2019s really unbelievable!\u201dIt shocked Sima Bu to his core.It was really incredible for him to simultaneously grasp two kinds of Sword Essence within a month. However, this made Sima Bu much more curious about Sword Soul, \u201cWhat on earth is Sword Soul? And how did it create such a monster?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before Jian Wushuang finished practicing his swordsmanship.\u201cEarth, warm and heavy!\u201d\u201cThe Sword Essence of Earth is exactly like this!\u201dJian Wushuang forced a smile and rejoiced. He himself didn\u2019t expect to grasp the Sword Essence as easily as he did today. He grasped Sword Principle of Gale earlier, but only one month later he had also grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Earth. For his part, that must be the result of the Sword Soul.Great progress had been made in his swordsmanship in the past month.First, his Cultivation had reached the peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path after one month\u2019s worth of life-and-death fighting and day-and-night cultivation. His current level was comparable to when he used the Soul-taking Secret Skill to fight against Ye Mo.At its peak, the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path was equivalent to the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.Secondly, his swordsmanship, and especially his fighting experience, had made greater progress. Now, without a doubt, he was completely experienced in fighting.As for Sword Essence, he learned more tricks in the Sword Essence of Gale and became more skilled and flexible in the practice and use of Sword Essence. But more importantly, he also apprehended a trace of the Sword Essence of Earth just now.It must be acknowledged that he had grasped two different Sword Essences of nature in this short amount of time.Characterized by its flexibility and fastness, the Sword Essence of Gale could make Sword Arts and piercing force much more powerful. As for the Sword Essence of Earth, it was boundless and tremendous due to its heaviness and steadiness.If used perfectly and flexibly, these two Sword Essences could make his Sword Arts more dreadful and formidable.\u201cAfter a month of cultivating and fighting, I have killed numerous Spirit Beasts easily. Even the formidable Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm are not considered a threat to me, so\u2026\u201dExposing a cold look in his eyes, Jian Wushuang made a decision in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You are going to fight against Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm!\u201d Sima Bu looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment.\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.Just as water naturally runs downhill, he aspired to fight against stronger Spirit Beasts, ones in the Gold Core Realm, to practice his swordsmanship. It was a fact that Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm couldn\u2019t pose a threat to him.Despite the big difference between the Gold Core Realm and Transforming Sea Realm, Jian Wushuang was still confident in his strength.As we all know, the peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path could rival the Spiritual Power of the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm. With his Sword Arts as well as the Sword Essences of both Gale and Earth, he had the ability to fight with Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm.\u201cBrother Bu, don\u2019t worry about me. With my current strength, I can fight against the weaker Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm. Even if I can\u2019t beat them, I can escape. If I can\u2019t escape, I can count on you,\u201d said Jian Wushuang with a smile.In the past one month, he got along well with Sima Bu, who always gave him references and guidance from nearby when he was fighting with Spirit Beasts. Jian Wushuang appreciated that very much.\u201cAlright, I still want to remind you that Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm are so powerful that you may be killed by them before I can help you out. You must be careful when you confront them,\u201d Sima Bu advised repeatedly.\u201cCertainly, I won\u2019t risk my life, \u201d said Jian Wushuang while smiling. Then he began to search for nearby Spirit Beasts at the Gold Core Realm.Spirit Beasts at the Transforming Sea Realm in the Dark Forest were everywhere, but those in the Gold Core Realm were rare. During the last month, they only met several Spirit Beasts at the Gold Core Realm, and once meeting them, they chose to escape instead of fighting.Jian Wushuang searched for them for a long time, but he failed to find one at the Gold Core Realm on the first day. However, he found a Spirit Beast already in the Profound Gold Core Realm the next day. Even though it was barely in the Profound Gold Core Realm, fighting against it was like playing with fire, so he decided to give up.Jian Wushuang didn\u2019t find a suitable Spirit Beast in the Gold Core Realm to fight with until the third day.\u201cIt\u2019s a Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf!\u201dStaring at the more than one-meter high, dark-red Devil Wolf, whose whole body seemed to have been bathed in blood, Jian Wushuang desperately desired to fight it.\u201cHuman beings!\u201dJust like Jian Wushuang, the dark red eyes of the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf also stared at him. Stronger Spirit Beasts are also much wiser. This Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf in the Gold Core Realm was as intelligent as a human being, so it could also feel Jian Wushuang\u2019s burning desire to fight.\u201cYou, a small ant, who has not even reached the Gold Core Realm, how dare you fight with me? Go to hell.\u201dWith a sudden release of all his strength, the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf moved so fast that only a bloody shadow was left in the air.Wearing a serious look, Jian Wushuang used his long sword against the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf right when its shadow flashed.Jian Wushuang used a mysterious angle to both stab and block the shadow of the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf as soon as its dark red shadow emerged.Immediately, an angry howl was released by the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf, accompanied by a wave of sound, easily bouncing his long sword back.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang said with astonishment.A mere howl was able to deflect his Sword Art.\u201cAurora Sword Art!\u201dAfter a cold humph, Jian Wushuang released all his strength and produced many sword shadows at almost the same time. His Sword Arts, mixed with a trace of Sword Principle of Gale, made the sword shadows flash at lightning speed.Thump, thump, thump\u2026 The sky was almost filled with the whistling sword light.The Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf suddenly attacked Jian Wushuang with its extremely sharp claws, which seemed to be able to split the void in two.Peng!Instantly, all the sword shadows disappeared. At the same time, a formidable force was released from the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf and transmitted to Jian Wushuang through his Long Sword, causing him to shiver unconsciously.\u201cIt\u2019s so powerful that its force alone is enough to block me.\u201d Jian Wushuang looked serious.\u201cWatch out!\u201d yelled Sima Bu, who was watching and standing in a nearby treetop.Jian Wushuang instantly noticed that the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf had already opened its mouth, showing its sharp and bloody fangs, and was preparing to bite off his head.\u201cFuck off!\u201dAlong with an angry shout, Jian Wushuang moved his Triple-kill Sword to generate a kind of heavy boundlessness. He integrated Sword Essence into his attack and used the Sword Essence of Earth to angrily chop at the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf, finally making it step back.\u201cAnonymous Sword Art, Blood Shadow!\u201dWith his eyes full of killing intent, Jian Wushuang instantly performed the First Move of the Anonymous Sword Arts.His use of the Anonymous Sword Art was more powerful after grasping Sword Essence.The cold and sharp sword light flashed quickly as the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf abruptly lunged at him.Ding!A low crash sounded. Then, Jian Wushuang tried to stabilize his body after being repelled.\u201cSword-killing Movement!\u201dJian Wushuang released his most powerful killing blow without any hesitation.Showing an angry look in its dark red eyes, the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf suddenly stretched out its cold and sharp claws.Clang!A low metal sound crashed, then there was a huge sword scar on the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf\u2019s paw, from which blood continuously poured out. After staring at Jian Wushuang with its dark red eyes, it shrank down into a blood shadow and fled directly into the jungle, where it disappeared.\u201cIt escaped?\u201dWhile looking in the direction the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf fled, Jian Wushuang withdrew his Long Sword and displayed a strange expression.\u201cKid, are you okay?\u201d Sima Bu came over to him and asked.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head, but he couldn\u2019t help looking at his right hand that was holding his Long Sword. Actually, he still felt a shiver in his palm.\u201cIt is worthy of being called a Gold Core Realm Spirit Beast, it\u2019s much more powerful than me. Though I wounded it with my Sword-killing Movement during the fight, it also hurt me with the formidable power from its paws,\u201d Jian Wushuang murmured.\u201cKid, you did quite well. You repelled it by using your Sword Arts. As a Spirit Beast at the Gold Core Realm, it is definitely more powerful than you,\u201d Sima Bu said.\u201cStill not good enough!\u201d Jian Wushuang said without any sense of satisfaction. \u201cMy swordsmanship still needs to improve, and I\u2019m not flexible enough when using the Sword Principles of both Gale and Earth. If I could use the Third Move of the Anonymous Sword Arts, or perfectly combined the Sword Principles of Gale and Earth, integrating one into the other, I wouldn\u2019t have panicked in that fight.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s continue like this\u2026\u201dJian Wushuang continued practicing his swordsmanship while heading towards his destination.Time flew and three months passed in the blink of an eye.Jian Wushuang and Sima Bu had spent four months (three months added to the previous month) walking through the Dark Forest before they finally reached the other side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Due to its proximity to the Dark Forest, the forces of Qingdong city became entangled. Some of them may be the forces of Gold-Dragon Palace and, of course, there are also some spies from Blood Feather Tower. Because of this,\u00a0you need to keep a low profile when you go into the city. \u201d Sima Bu took a conical straw hat from his Gold-Dragon Ring, handing it to Jian Wushuang.Carrying the Long Sword, Jian Wushuang, whose clothes were in tatters, took it and wore it without hesitation.Compared to four months ago when he just entered the Dark Forest, Jian Wushuang obviously appeared a little calmer and his skin had also turned much darker. Because of this, his innocent appearance had vanished.In the city, Jian Wushuang wore a conical straw hat that slightly covered his face. Although he knew that Qingdong City was already within the region of Tiannan Province, and the intelligence system of Blood Feather Tower was certainly not as good as Tianyan Province, Jian Wushaung was still cautious.Led by Sima Bu, the two quickly arrived in front of a magnificent loft.A gold dragon hovered over the rooftops of the gigantic loft, in front of which two men were standing there coldly. Then Sima Bu brought Jian Wushuang inside.A large number of Warriors were in the loft and most of them, like Sima Bu, were wearing a gold ring, apparently symbolizing that they were Gold-Dragon Guards.\u201cBoy, wait for me for a while. I\u2019m going to turn in the task.\u201d Sima Bu said.\u201cOkay.\u201dJian Wushuang nodded and then slightly raised his head, looking around at those Gold-Dragon Guards, who seemed to be drinking wine and chatting very casually. Yet, he could feel their subtle killing intent.\u201cBrother Bu was right. Gold-Dragon Guards, all of them are dangerous killers, who often engage in life-and-death struggles!\u201d Jian Wushuang whispered.\u201cIt took more than four months to finally fulfill the task.\u201d Sima Bu came back to where Jian Wushuang was, carrying a pot of wine, then he said, \u201cBoy, I took the task in the first place for the purpose of helping Ji Wuyue. As for bringing you, it was just out of convenience. Now my mission has been completed, so from here on you are on your own.\u201d\u201cThank you for all your help in these four months, Brother Bu.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded with gratitude deep down inside. Sima Bu really gave him a lot of assistance and Jian Wushuang secretly kept that favor in mind.\u201cHa-ha, it\u2019s nothing. Oh, yes. What do you intend to do next?\u201d Sima Bu looked at him and asked.\u201cI want to be a Gold-Dragon Guard.\u201d Jian Wushuang said directly.\u201cOh?\u201d Sima Bu smiled, and said with a raised brow, \u201cI knew that was the choice you would make.\u201d\u201cGold-Dragon Guard is an occupation that walks on the edge of life and death, making it easier to hone real experts, dangerous as it is. Besides, judging from your actions in the Dark Forest, your craziness makes you suitable to be a Gold-Dragon Guard.However, the Gold-Dragon Guard is divided into several different levels, such as One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, Three-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, and Golden-Dragon Ambassador, which is the highest level. Considering your current strength, at most,\u00a0you can complete the task required to become a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard.\u201d\u201cYes, I see,\u201d said Jian Wushuang while nodding.Jian Wushuang often asked Bu about a variety of things those four months in the Dark Forest. Naturally, that included questions about the Gold-Dragon Guard.Gold-Dragon Guard was an occupation with high requirements.To even become a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, the lowest level, one must at least reach the peak of the Profound Transforming Sea Realm.In addition, to become a Gold-Dragon Guard, you had to complete a task assigned by Gold-dragon Palace. These tasks were extremely difficult and the chance of failure was high.\u201cWith your current strength, as long as you are careful and not too impulsive, you have the ability to complete the task and become a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard. It isn\u2019t supposed to be difficult.\u201d Sima Bu laughed.Witnessing Jian Wushuang\u2019s growth, step by step, for four months, Sima Bu was definitely aware of his strength.\u201cFollow me, I\u2019ll take you to sign up and accept the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard,\u201d said Sima Bu.Jian Wushuang nodded. Then Sima Bu brought him to the counter in the attic, in front of which was a grey-robed elder with silver hair and half-squinting his eyes, who looked like he might fall asleep.\u201cMr. Huo,\u201d said Sima Bu with reverence. \u201cMy little brother wants to take on the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard.\u201dThe old man in gray looked up slightly, glancing at Jian Wushuang with his half-squinting eyes, and said indifferently, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cWith regard to my name\u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang touched his nose, the corners of his mouth curling upwards as he said, \u201cjust call me Swordsman.\u201d\u201cSwordsman?\u201d Sima Bu cast a glance at Jian Wushuang and burst out in laughter.\u201cTake this token and come here again three days from now.\u201d The grey-robed elder threw a Wooden-token with a Gold-Dragon Mark to Jian Wushuang and then turned around without giving Jian Wushuang a second glance.\u201cIs it that simple?\u201d Jian Wushuang took the Wooden-token with great surprise.\u201cWhat do you think? Go!\u201d said Sima Bu, smiling as they walked back.\u201cThis is Mr. Bu, right? Haven\u2019t seen you for many years. I didn\u2019t expect to meet you here today,\u201d said someone, with a clear and unpleasant tone of voice. Hearing this, Jian Wushuang saw a black-robed man with a cold face and bird-eyes coming over, followed by a purple-haired man.\u201cZhu Tao.\u201d Sima Bu picked his eyebrow, coldly smiling as he said, \u201cLong time no see.\u201dZhu Tao, his bird-eyes flashing with a ray of coldness, then looked to the grey-robed elder by the counter.\u201cMr. Huo, this is my disciple, Dongfang Yu. He is here to accept the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard,\u201d Zhu Tao said humbly.\u201cTake this token and come back here in three days.\u201d The grey-robed elder still spoke coldly and also gave the purple-haired man a Wooden-token with the Gold-dragon Mark.Zhu Tao turned around and his eyes swept the room, only to see the Wooden-token in the hands of Jian Wushuang. The corners of his mouth quirked up as he said indifferently, \u201cMr. Bu, the one who is behind you is your disciple? It seems that he has already taken the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, too. What a coincidence!\u201d\u201cThis is one of my little brothers, called Swordsman, not my disciple,\u201d Sima Bu said directly.\u201cIs he not your disciple?\u201d Zhu Tao was laughing, then turned around and looked at the purple-robed man, \u201cMy disciple, this is your Great Master, Mr. Bu, whom I often mentioned, and the one next to him is one of his \u2018little brothers.\u2019 You may as well say hello to his \u2018little brother.\u2019 After all, you are going to work together to accomplish the One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission. \u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The purple-robed man nodded, then looked directly at Jian Wushuang. The corners of his mouth at this moment quirked up as he said, \u201cSwordsman? My name is Dongfang Yu. I wonder if you have the courage to fight with me! \u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His strength is not as good as mine, so he does not dare to come to me in person, only sending his disciple to make trouble for you. Just ignore him. \u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Jian Wushuang knew the reason. While glancing at Dongfang Yu, he shook his head and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\u201cHow come? Could it be said that the person Mr. Bu brought here is a coward?\u201d Dongfang Yu said with a cold smile and a loud voice, attracting the attention of the Gold-dragon Guards in the loft.The Gold-dragon Guards looked in their direction and immediately revealed a look of interest.As so many people stared at Jian Wushuang suddenly, he pressed down his conical straw hat with a grim face.\u201cZhu Tao, what do you mean by this?\u201d Sima Bu shouted with a cold voice.\u201cNothing. I just did not expect that the person Mr. Bu brought here was so arrogant. Whatever the outcome is, we are going to complete the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard together three days from now. He is too supercilious to even greet me,\u201d replied Zhu Tao, with a sneer.\u201cWell, do you mean that no matter who challenge us, we must take it? In that case, I challenge you now. I wonder if you have the courage to fight with me?\u201d Sima Bu said with a deep voice.\u201cHa-ha, Mr. Bu is making a fun of me. Everyone knows your strength.\u00a0I dare not fight with you,\u201d Zhu Tao said casually.Joking? Sima Bu comprehended a glimmer of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire. He was even a Three-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard and he was at the peak of the Primordial Gold Core Realm. Sima Bu was obviously much stronger than Zhu Tao.\u201cSwordsman, will you always hide behind Mr. Bu? Being such a coward, what qualification do you have to complete the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard?\u201d Dongfang Yu said with a sneering smile.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Jian Wushuang suddenly looked up with a slight smile. \u201cIf it is just a greeting, I have no reason to refuse. Please.\u201d\u201cJian Wushuang.\u201d Sima Bu looked over in surprise.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know what to do,\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a quieter voice.Jian Wushuang accepted the challenge and it was decided the fighting area would just be the open space of the central hall.In the area with a coverage of dozens of square meters, stood Jian Wushuang and Dongfang Yu, with a large number of Gold-dragon Guards nearby, happily watching.While standing there, with a long black stick in his hand, Dongfang Yu exuded a soaring aura.\u201cLong Staff?\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s expression changed as he drew the Triple-kill Sword.\u201cBoy, be careful.\u201d Dongfang Yu smiled, followed by a quick move, then he instantly rushed over. At this moment, the long stick in his hands turned into a shinning black light.\u201cSo slow.\u201dJian Wushuang saw Dongfang Yu rushing straight over, but he didn\u2019t take it seriously.In fact, Dongfang Yu\u2019s burst of speed from the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm was very fast, but compared with Jian Wushuang who comprehended a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, it was indeed a bit too slow.Though it was slow, the power was not weak.\u201cI\u2019ll use him to put on a good show.\u201d Jian Wushuang faintly smiled and suddenly swung the Triple-kill Sword, releasing a whistling sword light that divided the air.Clang!The Triple-kill Sword directly collided with that shinning black light, making a low-pitched percussion sound. And then the dark light turned into a huge snake, twisting in the air before instantly changing back into the form of a stick, aiming to hit him.\u201cWhat?\u201dJian Wushuang seemed to panic as he hurriedly waved the sword to block. But he was still hit by the stick, causing his body and knees to bow. What\u2019s more, the serpent form lengthened unexpectedly, as if a large fierce-looking mouth was ferociously opening to bite Jian Wushuang.Jian Wushuang placed the Triple-kill Sword horizontally across his chest with great effort.Peng!A low noise was heard as Jian Wushuang was knocked back, retreating directly to the edge of the open space to keep his balance. Moreover, a trace of blood spilled from his mouth at this moment.\u201cWhat a piece of trash you are!\u201dDongfang Yu placed the stick upright and said with an indifferent look, \u201cYou can\u2019t even take three attacks from my stick, yet you want to complete the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard. Ridiculous!After he finished talking, Dongfang Yu did not bother to glance at Jian Wushuang. Instead, he went toward his Great Master, Zhu Tao, both looking at each other with a subtle smile.\u201cZhu Tao, your disciple is really good!\u201d\u201cHis stick technique is very strong. Besides, his cultivation has also reached the peak of the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm. Also, his Cultivation Method seems unusual and his release of Spiritual Power was obviously much stronger than the average warrior in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.\u201cWhere did you find such a good disciple?\u201dGold-dragon Guards acquainted with Zhu Tao were talking with their sights focused on him and Dongfang Yu, but no one even glanced at Jian Wushuang.After all, in this world, the strong will always be honored. Since Jian Wushuang was defeated and could not even ward off three strokes, naturally he could not attract the attention of these Gold-dragon Guards.\u201cHa-ha. I\u2019m telling you guys the truth, my disciple is the son of my old friend, and he indeed has a bit of talent. I would like to seize the opportunity to send him to Dragon Palace, but no one recommended him,\u201d Zhu Tao said with a laugh.\u201cDragon Palace?\u201d\u201cYou Intend to send him to Dragon Palace, but no one will recommend him?\u201d\u201cHa-ha. Zhu Tao, your disciple is really good!\u201dThe Gold-dragon Palace was very noisy because many of the Gold-dragon Guards were talking about topics related to \u201cDragon Palace\u201d.Jian Wushuang, whom no one noticed, left the crowd\u2019s attention quietly, coming to Sima Bu.Sima Bu,\u00a0who was drinking alone by the table, threw the wine pot to Jian Wushuang when he saw him coming over.\u201cTake a sip,\u201d Sima Bu said.Jian Wushuang caught the wine flask and took a drink without hesitation. He had learned to drink from Sima Bu in the Dark Forest during the last four months. Now, when drinking, he felt comfortable tasting the tangy and piquant flavor.\u201cRefreshing,\u201d Jian Wushuang could not help commenting.\u201cYou could have beaten him head-on, so why lose deliberately?\u201d Sima Bu laughed with a lowered voice.Though others did not know the strength of Jian Wushuang, Sima Bu was fully aware of it.\u00a0Apparently, Jian Wushuang lost the fight on purpose.\u201cThis is, after all, a branch palace of the Gold-dragon Palace. The more people, the more interference. Hence, there may be some spies from Blood Feather Tower.\u00a0I have to keep a\u00a0low-profile. As it is now,\u00a0everyone will focus their attention on Dongfang Yu, so no one will pay attention to me. Isn\u2019t that good?\u201d Jian Wushuang said and laughed.\u201cHa-ha, I understand your intention. But, don\u2019t you feel embarrassed being defeated by Dongfang Yu in front of so many people, with only three strokes?\u201d Sima Bu asked again.\u201cCompared with my life, losing face is of little significance!\u201d Jian Wushuang said, grinning and continuing to drink with his head raised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is a gathering of real talents! It was said that there are countless treasures, like Cultivation Methods and Martial Arts Techniques. Lots of things that can\u2019t be obtained in Tianzong Dynasty can be found in Dragon Palace.\u201cAt the same time, there is a variety of Strong and legendary people in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. Anyone who enters Dragon Palace will receive the best cultivation materials from Tianzong Dynasty.\u201d\u201cBut not everyone can be admitted to Dragon Palace to cultivate. In Tianzong Dynasty, it is said that all the people in Dragon Palace are exceptional geniuses! So you can understand that only the strongest geniuses can have the opportunity to cultivate inside Dragon Palace. People with average talent are not qualified at all.\u201dJian Wushuang could not help being stunned.\u201cAre all of them geniuses?\u201dThat was to say, any disciple in Dragon Palace would be respectfully treated as a master in Tianzong Dynasty. No wonder it was called the Holy Land.\u201cBrother Bu, since the qualifications are so harsh, is Dongfang Yu qualified to enter Dragon Palace?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cOf course!\u201d Sima Bu laughed and said, \u201d But not everyone can become a disciple and join Dragon Palace. Firstly, he must be recommended by a Golden Dragon Ambassador. Secondly, he has to pass the test arranged by Dragon Palace. As for these two conditions, not everyone can accomplish the first one.\u201dJian Wushuang understood, the first condition was the recommendation from a Golden Dragon Ambassador.But what\u2019s the status of a Golden Dragon Ambassador?It was known to all that the strongest experts of the Gold Core Realm, like Sima Bu, who had a deep understanding of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire were just a Three-Clawed Golden Dragon Guards. Only the Supreme existences could be a Golden Dragon Ambassador. That recommendation would be very difficult to get.\u201cZhu Tao has been complaining that his disciple didn\u2019t get recommended, but if he really has the talent, there is no need for him to worry about the recommendation. Look at Mr. Huo at the counter. If Dongfang Yu really is a monster-class talent, why hasn\u2019t Mr. Huo recognized him in all this time? And nobody in Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace of Qingdong City except him has the ability to contact a Golden Dragon Ambassador.\u201d Sima Bu sneered and said.Jian Wushuang looked at the grey-robed elder in front of the counter and smiled.Mr. Huo had his eyes narrowed the whole time and would not even look at Dongfang Yu, no matter how much Zhu Tao boasted about him.\u201cIn fact, Jian Wushuang, if you are willing to work hard in the future, with your talent, there is a chance for you to enter Dragon Palace,\u201d Sima bu said.\u201cMe?\u201d Jian Wushuag shook his head.\u2026Having stayed at an inn in the Qingdong City for three days, Jian Wushuang went back to the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace after the three days wait.Once Jian Wushuang arrived, he immediately saw many people holding the same wooden-token, with the same Golden Dragon Mark as him, waiting in the hall. That included Zhu Tao\u2019s disciple, Dongfang Yu.\u201cSo many people?\u201d Jian Wushuang was surprised. He just came in and didn\u2019t have time to find a place to sit down.\u201cSwordsman.\u201d A shadow appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, which turned out to be Dongfang Yu. However, Dongfang Yu looked at Jian Wushuang with despise at this moment. \u201cHow dare you come?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cYou can\u2019t even fight with me for three blows. You are such a piece of trash. Did you come here to be killed?\u201d Dongfang Yu said and laughed.\u201cEven if I did, that has nothing to do with you,\u201d said Jian Wushuang as he glanced at Dongfang Yu. He didn\u2019t want to talk with Dongfang Yu, because Dongfang Yu was just a self-righteous idiot in his eyes.\u201cHum, for someone so weak, you shouldn\u2019t have such a bad temper!\u201d said Dongfang Yu with a sneer. Then, he thought, \u201cBoy, once the task begins, do not let me find a chance, or\u2026\u201dDongfang Yu remembered clearly that his Great Master asked him to take down anyone who had something to do with Sima Bu.Jian Wushuang sat at a table alone, but not long after, a black-haired man walked towards him.\u201cYou are Swordsman, right?\u201d The man asked, smiling at him and showing great passion.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at him and asked the man.\u201cI am Ling Tianhao, but you can also call me Mouse. I came here to finish the task to become a One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard, just like you.\u201d The man opened his palm, showing a wooden-token with the Golden Dragon Mark.\u201cIs there something you want?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked coldly.\u201cOf course.\u201d Ling Tianhao looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, \u201cIs this your first time accepting the task for a One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cThis is my third time.\u201d Ling Tianhao sighed and said,\u201d My strength was not enough, so I was unable to finish my task the other two times, only managing a narrow escape. If I can\u2019t finish the third time, I will never become a Golden Dragon Guard.\u201dJian Wushuang fell into silence. He knew that a person could only accept the task for One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard three times. If he failed all three times, he would never be qualified to become a Golden Dragon Guard.\u201cI want to cooperate with you. When the task begins, let\u2019s work together.\u201dLing Tianhao said.\u201cOh?\u201d Jian Wushuang was a little surprised, \u201cCooperate?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate.\u201d Ling Tianhao continued speaking, \u201d I know that you fought with Dongfang Yu three days ago, and you didn\u2019t even last for three exchanges. You are one of the weakest out of all the people attempting this task, just like me. So if you work alone, you will be killed before you even have a chance of finishing the task.\u201d\u201cYou are right. I will cooperate with you.\u201d Jian Wushuang said and nodded.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s right. Follow me, I will introduce a backer to you.\u201d Ling Tianhao pulled Jian Wushuang along as he left.\u201cBacker?\u201dAlthough Jian Wushuang was doubtful, Ling Tianhao brought him to meet a red-haired girl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He will work with us later.\u201d Ling Tianhao smiled at the playful girl.\u201cSwordsman?\u201d The girl looked at Jian Wushuang and said, \u201cI know that you fought with Dongfang Yu here three days ago, and you didn\u2019t last three strikes.\u201d\u201cYes, that is true.\u201d Jian Wushuang touched his nose without denying it.\u201cI am Yin Min. You can call me Boss Yin, like Mouse does. From now on, if you work with me, I can guarantee that no one will dare to bully you,\u201d said the playful girl, Yin Min, patting her chest.Jian Wushuang thought that Yin Min was just boasting, but he still called out, \u201cBoss Yin.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Yin Min nodded without saying anything further.At that moment, Ling Tianhao said to Jian Wushuang quietly, \u201cBrother Swordsman, we are so lucky to have the backup of Boss Yin. Of course, this is because of our relationship with Dongfang Yu. Otherwise, I am afraid that Boss Yin would not help us.\u201d\u201cOh? What do you mean?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked quickly.\u201cWell, maybe you don\u2019t know, but that Dongfang Yu is the sworn enemy of Boss Yin. They both also fought each other once. I quickly came to ask for her help after hearing that, and she agreed without any hesitation after knowing about the hatred between me and Dongfang Yu. As for you, Boss Yin would allow you to work with us because many people know that you were defeated by Dongfang Yu in only three strikes,\u201d Ling Tianhao said.\u201cIs there any animosity between you and Dongfang Yu?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at Ling Tianhao.\u201cIt\u2019s just a trivial matter, but I just really don\u2019t like Dongfang Yu,\u201d Ling Tianhao said.Jian Wushuang was doubtful and asked, \u201cIs Boss Yin\u2019s strength very powerful?\u201d\u201cOf course, she would not even lose a fight with Dongfang Yu. She is the strongest, aside from Dongfang Yu, among all the people who accepted the task for One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard,\u201d Ling Tianhao said.\u201cIs that true? It seems that we have found a good backer.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled mysteriously and showed his interest.At that moment, the grey-robed elder in front of the counter, Mr. Huo, came out.\u201cTime\u2019s up. Now follow me, everyone,\u201d Mr. Huo said, leading everyone directly out of the city.After they were out of Qingdong City, Mr. Huo continued to lead everyone, walking in one direction for most of the day without stopping.\u201cMouse, since you have accepted the task for One-clawed Golden Dragon Guard twice, do you know where he is leading us to?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ling Tianhao shook his head, then continued speaking, \u201cThe task from the Golden Dragon Palace is different every time. Only after we arrive at the designated place will we be informed of what the task is. So, we have no choice but to follow him now.\u201d\u201cWhat were your previous two tasks?\u201d Jian Wushuang continued his questioning.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t tell you about the previous tasks,\u201d Ling Tianhao said.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jian Wushuang was puzzled.\u201cBecause that is the rule of Golden Dragon Palace. Any task from the Golden Dragon Palace is prohibited from being leaked out, and anyone who is found leaking it would likely be executed immediately.\u201d Ling Tianhao said seriously, \u201cBut I can tell you that those two tasks were extremely dangerous. It was only with good luck that I\u00a0was able to survive because most of the people were dead by the time the tasks were completed.\u201dAfter hearing this, Jian Wushuang wore a serious expression.They continued walking for two hours before they arrived at a big valley, where Mr. Huo stopped.\u201cHave we arrived?\u201d Jian Wushuang and the others looked around, but all they could see was the vast landscape surrounding them and the huge valley. They could not clearly see what was in the valley.\u201cMr. Huo, you are really slow.\u201dA cold voice was heard as a lofty shadow appeared in front of them.It came from a middle-aged man who had a long red robe and a cold expression. His eyebrows were able to display majesty without losing his temperament. While holding his hands behind his back, he looked over at everyone present with profound eyes.Everything and everyone fell into complete silence when that man appeared.Jian Wushuang, Dongfang Yu, Yin Min, and everyone else who had accepted the One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard task opened their eyes wide, looking at the man in great shock. Not because of how powerful and awesome his aura was, but because the man was floating in front of them.Yes, floating. Floating in the air!\u201cYin-Yang Void Realm!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a supreme expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm!\u201d\u201cA legendary existence!\u201dAll the people intently stared at him as he walked through the air. It was evident that the man was a supreme expert who had entered the Yin-Yang Void Realm.\u201cThe Yin-Yang Void Realm?\u201d Jian Wushuang pressed his hands tightly together as his eyes shined brilliantly.The Yin-Yang Void Realm had always been a legend. There were not many experts like him, and it was the first time for Jian Wushuang to see an expert at this level.\u201cGolden Dragon Ambassador.\u201dEven the enigmatic Mr. Huo showed respect to the man and kept a low profile.\u201cSince you are finally here, we can start working,\u201d the man standing in the air said in a low voice.\u201cAs you wish, Sir.\u201d Mr. Huo nodded continuously.Upon hearing this, the old man turned around and suddenly disappeared from everyone\u2019s sight.\u201cWhat speed is that?\u201dAll these people who had not even reached the Primordial Gold Core Realm were stunned when they saw this scene.\u201cSo fast! Although I am also very fast due to my understanding of the Sword Essence of Gale, I am just like a snail compared to this Golden Dragon Ambassador,\u201d Wushuang thought.A few loud voices came out from the vast valley as soon as the Golden Dragon Ambassador disappeared.\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cThis is the land of our Tianhuan Sect. Who are you? You should leave now!\u201d\u201cWhich Expert has come to our Tianhuan Sect?\u201dThe vast valley was the base of the Sect. When the Golden Dragon Ambassador was seen intruding into it, a loud warning came out from the valley. But after the expert in that Sect learned that the man was a Yin-Yang Void Realm expert who could Voidwalk, his tone became very respectful.At this time, a deafening sound was heard in that vast valley.\u201cTianhuan Sect? How dare you plot against the Golden Dragon Ambassador from our Golden Dragon Palace. Today is the end of your Tianhuan Sect!\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Afterwards, dozens of roars suddenly sounded from inside.Boom! Boom! Boom!Severe crashes continuously burst out from the depths of the valley, seemly causing the heavens and earth to tremble.No one knew what was happening there, including Jian Wushuang and others, who stood in astonishment outside the valley. All of them couldn\u2019t help holding their breath through the dozens of earthshaking roars.It was not long before the valley suddenly became tranquil.Whoosh!The middle-aged man with a powerful aura reappeared among them. After glancing at Mr. Huo, he said, \u201cAll fourteen masters of the Tianhuan sect, in the Gold Core Realm, are dead. You know what to do next.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Huo nodded respectfully.\u201cLittle guys, try your best.\u201d The middle-aged man said as he smiled again at the group and then left in the direction of Qingdong City.All the trainee\u2019s lost focus as they stared at the middle-aged man. Only after he had completely disappeared did they begin to gradually regain control of their thoughts.Suddenly, Mr. Huo announced, with a muffled voice, \u201cNow I will tell you the task. Listen carefully!\u201dAll the trainees in the area made sure to listen thoroughly.\u201cThe core of the Tianhuan Sect, a second-rate sect in Tiannan Province, is located in the valley in front of you. There are fourteen masters, who are experts in the Gold Core Realm, and many disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm. However, the fourteen masters have already been killed by the Golden Dragon Ambassador,\u201d said Mr. Huo.Everyone was shocked into silence.The fourteen experts in the Gold Core Realm? In such a short time? They were killed?\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cAll the expert in the Gold Core Realm were killed in such a short time?\u201d\u201cSo powerful, that is true strength!\u201dEveryone was so excited and they felt their blood begin to boil, even Jian Wushuang.\u201cThough the Masters are defeated, there are many disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm and the Spirit Path. The latter ones can be ignored, but you need to obtain the 10 Interspatial rings printed with the symbol of the Tianhuan Sect. They are worn by the disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm. To succeed, each one of you needs to seize one of those rings. Do you understand?\u201d Mr. Huo asked while looking around.All the trainees in the area understood.\u201cOnly those who obtain one of the Interspatial Rings will be able to complete the mission, right?\u201d\u201cThis mission doesn\u2019t seem so difficult,\u201dSomeone in the area suddenly murmured.\u201cOnly ten Interspatial Rings?\u201d\u00a0said Yin Min, frowning slightly.\u201cThis mission is more dangerous than the previous ones.\u201d Ling Tianhao couldn\u2019t help scolding them.\u201cAbsolutely dangerous.\u201d Jian Wushuang wore a grim expression on his face as he spoke.This mission\u2026 To start with, the numerous Warriors, in the Spiritual Sea Realm, in the Sect, would fight with all their power. But more importantly, there were only 10 Rings and over 30 trainees present. Yet, one ring could only be used by one trainee.In other words, over two-thirds of the trainees were doomed to fail.And\u2026 those who failed to obtain an Interspatial Ring,\u00a0in order to complete the mission, would have to fight with the other trainees.It could also be said that they should pay equal attention to both the Spiritual Sea Realm disciples in theTianhuan Sect as well as the other trainees from their\u00a0side.Mr. Huo said, \u201cNow that you know the mission, it\u2019s time to get started.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe trainees that were already prepared immediately rushed towards the valley.Jian Wushuang and his companions quickly rushed out as well.Whoosh!After leaping rapidly across the ground, three people quickly came into view of the great Sect gate in the middle of the valley.The Tianhuan Sect fell into a panic and loud noises could be heard from every corner.\u201cBoth of you stay close to me. If you move too far away, it\u2019s quite possible that you will lose your lives,\u201d said Yin Min, glancing at Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao.\u201cOkay,\u201d\u00a0said Jian Wushuang, with a nod.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ling Tianhao also answered and nodded, with a grim expression.\u201cHey, Yin Min, it\u2019s rare for you to look so serious, right?\u201d A voice was suddenly heard. Then, Dongfang Yu appeared with his five followers behind him.Yin Min disdained him and said nothing.Dongfang Yu didn\u2019t lose his temper. Glancing at Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao, he laughed and then said, \u201cYin Min, look at your two companions. One is joining the One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard Mission for the third time and the other was defeated by me within less than three moves. You actually dared to team up with these two?\u201d\u201cThis has nothing to do with you. Piss off.\u201d Yin Min directly scolded him.Dongfang Yu\u2019s expression became quite serious, but he quickly recovered. Ignoring Yin Min, he turned his eyes towards Jian Wushuang, laughing at him as he said \u201cHey, kid, watch out for your life during this dangerous mission. After all, trash like you can easily die inside the Tianhuan Sect.\u201dThen Dongfang Yu and his followers quickly rushed inside the Tianhuan Sect.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang thought. He watched with a weird expression as Dongfang Yu left. \u201cAt the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace, I didn\u2019t want to risk being noticed by people from Blood Feather Tower. Because of that, I pretended to lose. But I didn\u2019t expect him to look down on me so much.\u201dJian Wushuang touched his nose and shook his head with a smile. Then, he immediately raced towards the Tianhuan Sect together with Yin Min and Ling Tianhao.The moment they stepped into the Tianhuan Sect, the warriors in the sect sensed their arrival.\u201cDamn, people from the Golden Dragon Palace came to exterminate my Tianhuan Sect. Keep dreaming!\u201d\u201cI grew up in the Tianhuan Sect. My whole life is here. If you plan to destroy my Sect, you will have to step over my dead body first!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill all the invaders!\u201d\u201cStay with the Sect!\u201dMany loud roars could be heard in the Tianhuan Sect. They had cultivated many loyal Warriors. Though the fourteen experts of the Gold Core Realm were dead, the Warriors and disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm chose to stay with the Sect and fight for it, instead of escaping.Therefore, numerous disciples in the Spiritual Sea Realm, from the Tianhuan Sect, madly rushed towards the invaders.A violent fight was about to erupt.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some teamed up while others began rampaging alone.The disciples of the Tianhuan Sect also rose up in resistance.Jian Wushuang and his companions had just arrived in one of the yards in the Tianhuan Sect when they saw tens of shadows charging at them, all of them in the Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cYou two, follow me closely!\u201d Yin Min ordered coldly. Gripping her scarlet long spear, she immediately dashed forward.Jian Wushuang nodded at Ling Tianhao and followed Yin Min, his expression a little cold.\u201cInvaders!\u201dThe sight of these three instantly triggered the killing intent of the Tianhuan Sect disciples.\u201cKill them!\u201dTens of shadows rushed toward them.Swish!A blurry spear shadow charged towards them, like a viper sticking out its tongue at its prey. For a moment, the lighting-fast spear seemed to create an environment in which snowflakes were gently falling. It gave the spear a poignant feeling.Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash!The spear pierced five necks at once, leaving five corpses collapsed on the ground.\u201cThis skill\u2026\u201dJian Wushuang couldn\u2019t help being surprised when he saw this.These disciples of the Tianhuan Sect were only in the Initial and Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. So it was not hard for Yin Min, in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, to kill them. But it was so much more difficult to kill five with one strike.What Yin Min demonstrated earlier caused his eyes to light up.\u201cKill!\u201dThe death of their fellow disciples didn\u2019t slow down the remaining ones. They rushed forward and launched a series of attacks towards Jian Wushuang and his companions.Jian Wushuang swung the Triple-kill Sword in his hand at two disciples. With two clean slashes, he easily ended the lives of the two, who were only in the Initial Spiritual Sea Realm.Holding his dark dagger, Ling Tianhao quietly stabbed the disciples charging at him. He was incredibly fast in killing two of them. The rest were all killed by Yin Min.It took mere moments for the tens of Tianhuan Sect disciples to meet their death.\u201cThey\u2019re too weak.\u201d Jian Wushuang could not help sighing when he saw all the dead bodies on the ground.The Tianhuan Sect was considered a second-rate sect in the Tiannan Province, yet it was far more powerful than Sword Marquis Mansion. But after the deaths of their fourteen Gold Core Realm experts, the ending was basically written in stone.The remaining disciples were all in the Spiritual Sea Realm, with the majority in the Initial and Profound level. Rarely were any of them at the Exceptional level. Unfortunately for them, those who accepted this mission were all at the Exceptional level. They also possessed their own personal techniques.After all, anyone who accepted this mission despite knowing its extreme danger would certainly come prepared.Ling Tianhao, for example, might be one of the weakest among the participants who accepted the mission. But if you put him among the Tianhuan Sect disciples who were it the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, few could defeat him.\u201cNone of the people I killed has an Interspatial Ring. What about you guys?\u201d Yin Min asked, looking over at them.\u201cNone here.\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head.\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Ling Tianhao shrugged.This didn\u2019t come as a big surprise to them. After all, there were only a total of 10 rings. For how precious and rare they were, they ought to be at least worn by disciples in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. And none of those that they killed were at that level.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Yin Min said. The three of them then walked toward the depths of the Tianhuan Sect.They did not even glance at the corpses on the ground.Though they felt sympathy for the Tianhuan Sect disciples, they would never show any mercy in a fight. After all, they were on different sides. If they showed mercy, then the corpses lying on the ground would be theirs.Inside an underground secret room in the Tianhuan Sect.There were eight people wearing robes standing inside the room, wearing copper masks that only showed their eyes. A person wearing a black robe and a silver mask sat on a stone chair.Thud!The door to the secret room opened and a purple-haired old man came running in, panicking. He shouted anxiously, \u201cPlease, my lords. I beg you, help save our Tianhuan Sect\u2026\u201dThe one wearing a silver mask looked up, revealing his pair of cold eyes as he looked at the purple-haired old man. He said indifferently, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on outside?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re here! Men from Golden Dragon Palace are here! There are many warriors in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. Not only that, our leader and many of our elders are already dead. We don\u2019t have a single expert in the Gold Core Realm that is still alive. We simply can\u2019t hold up against those warriors, so please help us\u2026\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t even finish his sentence before he collapsed on the ground with a bloodstain on his neck. Beside him, a man wearing a copper mask was slowly sheathing his sword.\u201cMy Lord, what should we do next?\u201d a copper-masked servant asked.\u201cThree years ago, the Tianhuan Sect leaked some information, scheming against a Golden Dragon Ambassador. It was supposed to be a secret, but it was still discovered by the Golden Dragon Palace. Their intelligence work is truly amazing.\u201d The man with the silver mask continued coldly, \u201cSince it has been discovered, the Tianhuan Sect is bound to be exterminated. As for us, naturally it\u2019s best if we can avoid exposing ourselves.\u201d\u201cThose who were sent here now are only in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. If I estimate correctly, they\u2019re part of a One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard mission. Those rookies may not even discover this place if we stay here. And if they really do end up finding us, the Golden Dragon Ambassador would already be gone by then.\u201d\u201cWithout the Golden Dragon Ambassador hindering us, it\u2019s impossible for those rookies to stand in our way.\u201dThey were all afraid of the Golden Dragon Ambassador, who was in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. The man with the silver mask was not an exception. When the Golden Dragon Ambassador was fighting with others, he did not discover them because the robed men were good at hiding their auras and were hidden in this secret room.In his opinion, the high and mighty Golden Dragon Ambassador would no be so bored as to stay back and watch the rookies wrap up the mission after he finished killing all the Gold Core Realm experts.\u201cBut what a pity that the extermination of the Tianhuan Sect means we\u2019ve lost a chess piece!\u201d The man wearing the silver mask shook his head and sighed.The black robe and that facial mask\u2026 They were obvious symbols of Blood Feather Tower, the strongest Assassination Association of the Tianzong Dynasty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, with an abrupt sweep, it heavily hacked towards two more disciples, making them step back.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be killed, then leave.\u201dYin Min, a nifty girl with a long spear in her hands, wore a cold expression while criticizing them. However, several Tianhuan Sect disciples ignored her words and lunged at her, immediately attacking with their knives and swords.\u201cKill them,\u201d Yin Min said in a cold voice.A flash of coldness appeared in the eyes of Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao, but suddenly\u2026\u201cHum!\u201dA cold voice and three auras rushed into the battle. These cultivators were stronger than previous Tianhuan Sect disciples.\u201cThree people at the level of Exceptional Spiritual Sea?\u201dThe arrival of these three caused Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression to change.Since they came to the Tianhuan Sect, they had encountered three groups of Tianhuan Sect disciples who just reached the level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and the Initial Realm. They had yet to encounter a single disciple at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, not to mention encountering three of them at the same time.\u201cYou two, protect yourselves,\u201d Yin Min said in a low voice. Then, the long spear in her hands danced through the air like flashing stars and drifting snow as it struck towards two of the disciples at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cHaozi (Mouse), leave the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciple to me. As for the others, it\u2019s up to you to handle them,\u201d Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.\u201cYes,\u201d Ling Tianhao said and nodded.Although he had to fight against several Tianhuan Sect disciples at the same time, these disciples were only at the level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm or Initial Spiritual Sea Realm and were no threat to him. Those three at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, that could threaten him, had been blocked by Yin Min and Jian Wushuang.\u201cHow dare you two guys blocked me?\u201dYin Min laughed loudly and then she furiously hacked towards the two people at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm with the long red spear, blasting them with hazy spear shadows. Both of them realized how ruthless and tyrannical Yin Min was as they fended her off with all their strength. However, they were no match for Yin Min\u2019s spear skills.Though fighting against two enemies, Yin Min still gained the upper hand.\u201cBe careful, she is strong,\u201d said a person at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, seriously.\u201cHum, she is only at the level of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. Why should we be afraid of her when we have a two-to-one advantage? Let\u2019s kill her.\u201d The other one sniffed and then they lunged at Yin Min again.A giant axe was shown in front of Yin Min and hacked towards her.Meanwhile, a flash of dark gold sword light appeared in front of Yin Min, traveling ten meters in an instant.\u201cHow ridiculous.\u201d Yin Min laughed as the look in her eyes abruptly turned cold.\u201cDivine Spear of Dripping Blood!\u201dClang!Clang!Clang!Two flashes of spear shadow struck out successively, faster than those two people expected. And then, those two flashes of spear shadow stabbed into the area between the eyebrows of both disciples, immediately killing them.\u201cGood girl, Yin Min has a good command of her spearmanship.\u201dJian Wushuang was still fighting with the other disciple at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. But he saw everything that happened, especially when Yin Min killed other two disciples at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm on her own.\u201cIt seems that I should also show a little bit of my ability.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled faintly while looking at his enemy.\u201cDie!\u201dOnly Jian Wushuang could hear his light voice. The disciple at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm saw a flash of cold sword light in front of him, rapidly approaching his eyes.It was too fast for him to resist, quickly piercing through his throat.Meanwhile, Ling Tianhao also defeated his enemies.\u201cSwordsman, not bad. How did you kill someone at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm on your own?\u201d Yin Min asked while looking at Jian Wushuang with startled eyes.\u201cHaha. I just have a good luck,\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a smile.\u201cReally?\u201d Yin Min raised her eyebrow but didn\u2019t continue asking.\u201cGo and see if any of them have an Interspatial Ring,\u201d said Yin Min.It only took a moment for Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao to check them.\u201cNo.\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head.\u201cNothing here either.\u201d Ling Tianhao also shook his head.\u201cIt seems that we really have bad luck. We have killed so many Tianhuan Sect\u2019s disciples, even three people at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm but we still didn\u2019t find an Interspatial Ring,\u201d Yin Min said with a wry smile.Peng!Suddenly, a wall on the perimeter of the courtyard shattered as a pitiful figure heavily landed on the ground. It was a white-hair old man, who vomited a mouthful of blood after falling on the ground. Then, he stood up and immediately tried to escape.\u201cWhere are you trying to escape to?\u201dFour figures appeared behind the white-hair old man, chasing after him.Jian Wushuang had seen these four people receive the Golden-dragon Guard task together with him.Jian Wushuang\u2019s group of three felt surprised when they saw these four people chasing the white-hair old man who wore a lilac ring on his right ring finger.\u201cThat\u2019s an Interspatial Ring!\u201d\u201cHe has an Interspatial Ring!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201dWithout any hesitation, all three rushed in front of the white-hair old man, among whom Yin Min arrived first. She ruthlessly struck out with the long spear as if trying to pierce through everything in the world.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe white-hair old man had already encountered a major battle that left him seriously injured, but now he was being chased by four people. He was already in a desperate situation and he didn\u2019t expect to encounter even more people from the Golden-dragon Palace. The white-hair old man felt hopeless when he saw the ruthless spear stabbing towards him.\u201cChi!\u201dThe spear stabbed through the white-hair old man. Then the spear cut off his right ring finger and made it fly up. Yin Min reached out to grasp the amputated finger and the lilac ring on it as it fell directly into her hand.\u201cThe first Interspatial Ring!\u201dSeeing this, both Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao smiled.However, on the other side, the expressions of the four people who had chased the white-hair old man before suddenly turned dark.\u201cHand over the ring!\u201d\u201cThat Interspatial Ring belongs to us.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense, kill her immediately!\u201dBoom!Four figures tried to kill Yin Min at the same time.\u201cSh*t.\u201dThe complexions of both Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao changed. Although they had known that they might need to kill people from their own side during the task, they didn\u2019t expect these people to attack without any hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, the four people were knocked back over 10 meters by Yin Min before they regained their footing.Whoosh! Whoosh!Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao immediately appeared beside Yin Min.\u201cDo you want to kill people on your own side?\u201d Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.\u201cThat Interspatial Ring should have belonged to us but you guys snatched it.\u201d Those four people all had grim expressions as a burly man, the leader of them,\u00a0growled, \u201cIf you guys are wise, then hand over the Interspatial Ring or we\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\u201cOtherwise?\u201d Yin Min sneered and said, \u201cMore than 30 people received the task, but only 10 Interspatial Rings exist. That means most of the people can\u2019t complete the task. This is a competition between us and the Interspatial Ring is in my hand. If you want to grab it just come try. But who will get the ring hasn\u2019t\u00a0been decided yet.\u201dThose four burly men felt unpleasant.They had just fought with Yin Min and realized that Yin Min\u2019s strength was stronger than any of them. Even killing two of them on her own was a piece of cake. Besides her, there were Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao. They would probably suffer if they fought with them.\u201cHum, let\u2019s go.\u201d The burly man snorted and then those four people reluctantly left.Jian Wushuang and other two couldn\u2019t help laughing when they saw the group leaving.\u201cIt\u2019s lucky for them to leave, otherwise it\u2019s possible one or two of them would be killed by me and Swordsman, not to mention sister Yin. Fighting against three on her own is no problem at all,\u201d Ling Tianhao said with a smile.\u201cFighting against three on my own?\u201d Yin Min shook her head and said, \u201cYou think too highly of me. Those who dare to receive a Golden-dragon Guard task are stronger than we imagine. Fighting two is possible, but three is not realistic.\u201d\u201cAll right. Don\u2019t talk about it anymore. We have been fighting for a long time, now we finally have an Interspatial Ring. Give this one to me and if we obtain more Interspatial Ring, they will belong to you two. How\u2019s it?\u201d Yin Min turned to Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao.\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jian Wushuang said and nodded.\u201cOf course I agree,\u201d replied Ling Tianhao with a smile.It was obvious that Yin Min was the biggest contributor to the battle. She was also the oldest among them, so giving the first ring to her was only proper.\u201cOk, let\u2019s go on. It hasn\u2019t been long since the slaughter started, so we have many opportunities to find more Interspatial Rings,\u201d Yin Min said.\u201cYes.\u201d Both Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao agreed and nodded.The slaughter in the Tianhuan Sect continued, becoming even crazier as time passed.Jian Wushuang and other two had already been in the Tianhuan Sect for an hour.\u201cAh?\u201dJian Wushuang and other two suddenly looked up from the corridor and saw a fierce battle ahead of them.There were two sides in the battle. One one side, disciples of the Tianhuan Sect, and on the other side, their acquaintances that also came for the Golden-dragon Palace task.\u201cIt\u2019s those four,\u201d Jian Wushuang said. Those people fighting against the Tianhuan Sect disciples were the stout man and his three companions that they had just met. The first Interspatial Ring Yin Min got was from them.\u201cThey are in a bad situation,\u201d Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.They could clearly see that those four people were in a bad situation because over 20 Tianhuan Sect disciples were fighting against them. Among them were five disciples at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201cThese four guys are really unlucky. It\u2019s unbelievable they were attacked by so many Tianhuan Sect disciples,\u201d Yin Min said and sneered.\u201cLook! Sister Yin and Swordsman, that man\u2019s right hand\u2026\u201d Ling Tianhao suddenly exclaimed.Jian Wushuang and Yin Min looked in the direction Ling Tianhao pointed. They saw a Tianhuan Sect disciple at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm wearing a lilac ring on his right index finger.\u201cAn Interspatial Ring,\u201d Yin Min felt surprised and said, \u201cHaha, the second Interspatial Ring has appeared. Let\u2019s do it. First, we\u2019ll join hands with those four men to kill the Tianhuan Sect disciples, then we grab the Interspatial Ring.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Both Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao agreed and nodded.The three of them immediately rushed into the battle.\u201cThree more bastards!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201dThe Tianhuan Sect disciples were crazy with blood-lust, immediately attacking Jian Wushuang and the other two as soon as they saw them.The pressure on the other four who had been under siege this whole time was suddenly reduced by a large amount.\u201cIt\u2019s them.\u201d The stout man changed his face after seeing Jian Wushuang and quickly said, \u201cRun. We should get away while the Tianhuan Sect disciples are fighting with them.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The other three men froze.\u201cWhy should we leave? If we join hands with them, it is completely possible to kill all these Tianhuan Sect disciples and grab the Interspatial Ring,\u201d a purple-dressed woman asked.\u201cHum! Our alliance surely can kill all of the Tianhuan Sect disciples. But after that? Can we get the Interspatial Ring? Don\u2019t forget that Yin Min just defeated us on her own. There is also Swordsman and that Ling Tianhao who has reached the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. We are no match for them at all if we fight against them,\u201d the stout man said with a chilly expression.\u201cInstead of joining hands with them and then letting them take the Interspatial Ring, it would be better leave now and observe them secretly. After they finish the life-and-death struggle against the Tianhuan Sect disciples we can show up and obtain the ring without any effort.\u201d\u201cGood idea!\u201d\u201cBoth sides will suffer great losses in such a fierce battle. Whoever wins the battle will be weakened, and then we can easily defeat either side at that time.\u201d\u201cI agree too.\u201dThe other three soon agreed with the stout man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he quickly turned around and disappeared into the corridor with his companions, leaving Jian Wushuang and the other two to fight with the pack of Tianhuan Sect disciples.\u201cBastards!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dSeeing that, Yin Min and Ling Tianhao cursed in rage with a peevish expression on their faces.\u201cThis is troublesome.\u201d Jian Wushuang also felt a little worried.Including those four, along with Jian Wushuang, Yin Min and Ling Tianhao, if these seven Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm masters fought together, they would easily defeat these Tianhuan Sect disciples. However, with those four leaving, the remaining three had to fight with five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples, a dozen Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Initial Spiritual Sea Realm Tianhuan Sect disciples.The situation was instantly at its worst.\u201cHaha, your companions seem to have abandoned you.\u201d\u201cPoor guys, prepare to get trashed.\u201dAll the disciples of the Tianhuan Sect laughed at Jian Wushuang and the other two, lunging at them directly.\u201cSwordsman, Haozi (Mouse), Let\u2019s fight!\u201d Yin Min shouted to Jian Wushuang and desperately rushed into the battlefield.\u201cI\u2019ll take three Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples. I\u2019ll count on you to handle the rest two, several Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Initial Realm disciples,\u201d Yin Min said in a deep voice. It was her ultimate limit to fight with three Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples at the same time.\u201cLet me take these five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s words surprised Yin Min. Before she could reply, Jian Wushuang ran in front her with amazing speed and collided with the Tianhuan Sect disciples.Whoosh!Suddenly a bright dazzling sword light swept across the five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples simultaneously.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow dare he fight with all five of us at the same time? He must be suicidal!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dThose five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples became furious and lunged towards Jian Wushuang.But when the dazzling sword light swept, zooming, the horrible Sword Essence rose suddenly and sharply.\u201cWatch out!\u201dThe five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples hurriedly changed from attack to defense. But when they came into contact with the sword light, these five figures fell back with five loud thumps.Shoop! Shoop! Shoop! Shoop! Shoop!The wild sword shadows almost instantaneously spurted from Jian Wushuang\u2019s hands. The amazing speed of Aurora Swordsmanship had soared to an incredible level ever since Jian Wushuang comprehended the Sword Essence of Gale.\u201cIt\u2019s so fast!\u201d\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cBe careful!\u201dThe Tianhuan disciples shouted with voices full of fear. Although the five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples tried their best to withstand the sword shadows, the sword shadows were too fast and arrived too quickly.Even though the sword shadows swept to five of them at the same time, it was still too fast to resist.Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!The sounds of clanks were heard one after another. The five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples were hit by dozens of sword attacks, and three of them seemed to be unable to parry.Beep\u2026 A sword Flash swept towards the throat of those three disciples.\u201cChi!\u201dThe three figures immediately fell backward.\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dSeeing that, the Tianhuan Sect disciples began escaping crazily with almost no hesitation. The two remaining Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples also lost the courage to fight with Jian Wushuang. The only thing they could do was run.\u201cHe\u2019s too strong. Even with five of us together, his swordsmanship was so fast that he killed three of us in the blink of an eye. We\u2019ll all die here if we do not run.\u201d The two Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples were aware of the insurmountable gap between Jian Wushuang and them. Naturally, they did not dare to fight with Jian Wushuang anymore.\u201cRun?\u201d A cold voice without a hint of emotion rang out near one of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples. The disciple raised his head in horror, only to find Jian Wushuang standing in front of him and the Triple-kill Sword stuck in him.\u201cNo!\u201d The disciple only had time to make an unwilling roar before he was immediately killed.\u201cYou are the owner of the Interspatial Ring. I can\u2019t let you get away from me.\u201d After killing the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciple, Jian Wushuang grinned and took the Interspatial Ring off the disciple\u2019s finger. As for the Tianhuan Sect disciples that escaped, Jian Wushuang was not in the mood to chase after them.\u201cSwordsman!\u201d\u201cSwordsman!\u201dJian Wushuang turned his head, finding Yin Min and Ling Tianhao with stunned expressions on their faces that were hard to describe.Jian Wushuang stroked his nose and then laughed in his sleeve.Last time, he deliberately lost to Dongfang Yu so he would not stand out, making people think he was weak. And during the mission this time, he still hadn\u2019t found a good chance to prove his ability because of Yin Min. He had finally reached the point where he could not hide it anymore.His strength shocked Yin Min and Ling Tianhao.Jian Wushuang killed four real Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples in an instant. What kind of strength was that?Yin Min knew that if she fought against five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples, she could barely resist for a while before eventually losing. In the end, she would die even if she killed one of two of them by risking her life.Which meant that Jian Wushuang\u2019s strength was much more tremendous than hers.\u201cHaha, Swordsman, I admire you so much!\u201d When Ling Tianhao regained himself, he laughed and gave Jian Wushuang a bear hug.\u201cSwordsman, you hid your strength this whole time?\u201d Yin Min asked seriously.\u201cYes,\u201d Jian Wushuang said and nodded. There was no sense in denying it now.\u201cYou fought with five Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples on your own and killed four of them in a short time. This level of strength is not something me or Dongfang Yu can compare with. Swordsman, you disguised yourself pretty well,\u201d Yin Min said with a smile.The four who abandoned Jian Wushuang, Yin Min, and Ling Tianhao, gloating as they were surrounded by the Tianhuan Sect disciples, were still very close. They were hiding in a room near the courtyard and heard everything Jian Wushuang and Yin Min said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This kind of battle will definitely make them suffer,\u201d the stout man said gloatingly.But only a short while later they saw Jian Wushuang kill four of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples swiftly and cruelly, while the remaining Tianhuan Sect disciples fled.The four of them were stunned.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable! That Swordsman, how could he be so strong?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe that he killed four Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples in such a short time. How could that happen?\u201dThe four of them felt it was impossible. Meanwhile, they recalled the words they heard in Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace. It was about Dongfang Yu defeating Jian Wushuang in only three moves.\u201cToday we personally witnessed Swordsman\u2019s strength. How was it possible that he couldn\u2019t resist Dongfang Yu? You must be kidding me. I would rather believe that Dongfang Yu was defeated by him in three moves,\u201d roared the stout man.How could his incredible strength be overcome by Dongfang Yu in three moves?That was ridiculous!\u201cIt is a relief that we didn\u2019t have a real conflict with them, or\u2026\u201d The stout man spoke in a relaxing tone. He counted himself fortunate to have never turned against Yin Min, even when she took Interspatial Ring away from him. He felt terrified when he thought of Jian Wushuang\u2019s immense power.\u201cGo! Be quick!\u201d the stout man roared. \u201cWe should keep away from these three people until the mission is finished. All in all, we used them just now, and they might hold a grudge against us. I\u2019m afraid that they will fight against us next time.\u201d\u201cGo! Hurry up!\u201dThe others nodded and intended to escape in panic.\u201cHey, do you see that?\u201d said the woman in purple.The strong man turned his head at once. Suddenly his expression became weird. \u201cIt\u2019s them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Dongfang Yu and his followers. They arrived just now and met Swordsman just in time.\u201dThe four were just about ready to leave, but at this moment their steps suddenly stopped.On the corridor, Jian Wushuang and his companions also noticed Dongfang Yu and his followers.\u201cIt\u2019s Dongfang Yu.\u201d Yin Min and Ling Tianhao glanced at Jian Wushuang with queer complexions.Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and smiled slightly but said nothing.\u201cDongfang Yu, you are like a ghost, constantly haunting us,\u201d Yin Min said in a cold voice and cast a glance towards Dongfang Yu.\u201cYin Min, I\u2019m surprised that the two trash following you are still alive. Lucky guys.\u201d Dongfang Yu appeared in front of them, speaking with an arrogant voice, \u201cLet\u2019s get to the point. Yin Min, since you guys have been in the Tianhuan Sect for a while now, I bet you have an Interspatial Ring, right?\u201d\u201cInterspatial Ring?\u201d Yin Min said with a sneer. Then she stretched out her right hand as a light purple ring shined dazzlingly on her fourth finger, \u201cHere it is. If you want it, come and take it.\u201dAt the sight of the Interspatial Ring on Yin Min\u2019s hand, the eyes of the five people behind Dongfang Yu brightened and a flash of heat appeared in their eyes.\u201cOh, you really do have one. But only one ring.\u201d Dongfang Yu sneered at her and turned his head to his five followers. Then he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe people following Dongfang Yu hesitated, but eventually the left with him. However, Dongfang Yu glanced at Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao as he left and said in a low voice, \u201cYou two trash are very lucky to have Yin Min as your pillar. But there are only ten Interspatial Rings. Even I only managed to get one of them. How dare you expect to get them?\u201dDongfang Yu left once he finished speaking.\u201cWhat a contemptuous look! But he would never think that our Swordsman has the second Interspatial Ring,\u201d Ling Tianhao said before pursing his lips.\u201cI\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t bother us. That was my fault. I should have given the ring to you, Haozi (Mouse). If Dongfang Yu knew an Interspatial Ring was in your hands, he would definitely try to take it from you without hesitation.\u201dShe was definitely hoping to see Dongfang Yu try to take the ring just now. If he had started a fight, Jian Wushuang would have instantly given him a lesson. But Dongfang Yu had no desire to snatch the Interspatial Ring when he saw that it was in her possession.Things would totally change if the Interspatial Ring was Ling Tianhao\u2019s.\u201cHaozi (Mouse), the second Interspatial Ring, it\u2019s yours.\u201d Jian Wushuang gave the ring to Ling Tianhao.\u201cSwordsman, what happened to you?\u201d Ling Tianhao looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment, instead of accepting the ring.\u201cI need you two to do me a favor.\u201d Jian Wushuang said directly.\u201cHow can we help you?\u201d Yin Min also turned to face him.\u201cSee this attic?\u201d Jian Wushuang stared at the attic beside him and said with a smile, \u201cI want to cultivate alone in this attic with no interruptions, so I need you two to safeguard me.\u201d\u201cCultivate?\u201d\u201cYou want to cultivate now?\u201dYin Min and Ling Tianhao both felt astonished.\u201cDid you have a breakthrough?\u201d Yin Min asked spontaneously.\u201cYes,\u201d Jian Wushuang said and nodded.\u201cReally?\u201d Yin Min and Ling Tianhao were both surprised.They believed the fighting capacity of Jian Wushuang was already incredible among people in the Spiritual Sea Realm. If he made a breakthrough, he would probably reach the Gold Core.Primordial Gold Core, a level they hoped to reach someday.\u201cI need some time to cultivate, but I don\u2019t know how long I will need. Maybe our mission will finish before I\u2019m done with my cultivation. So the second Interspatial Ring naturally belongs to you Haozi (Mouse). After all, it\u2019s your last chance to attempt the Golden-dragon Guard mission. If you fail, you will never be able to become a Golden-dragon Guard for the rest of your life. But it\u2019s not the same for me,\u201d Jian Wushuang said while smiling.\u201cI see,\u201d Ling Tianhao understood, so he nodded his head with a smile and said, \u201cthanks a lot. You can count on us to guard this area. We won\u2019t let anyone disturb you. \u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d said Jian Wushuang. Then he smiled and went straight into the attic. Yin Min and Ling Tianhao stood guard in front of the attic.The stout man and his companions witnessed it all because they were still near the courtyard.\u201cWhat is Swordsman doing? Why did he go into the attic?\u201d\u201cDid he suddenly comprehend something? Is he going to make a breakthrough?\u201d\u201cWill he reach the Gold Core?\u201dTheir complexions became uneasy. The strength of Jian Wushuang was already so terrifying. What kind of level would he reach after he made a breakthrough?\u201cDon\u2019t mind what he does. From now on, if we meet the three of them, we turn round immediately,\u201d the stout man said and left with the others in a hurry.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The breakthrough was not into the Gold Core, but the Spiritual Sea Realm.No one knew that Jian Wushuang, who could easily kill an expert that had achieved the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, had not even entered the realm yet.He sat cross-legged inside the attic, where a boundless Spiritual power was beginning to come together inside his body.Having reached the top of the Ninth Heaven of Divine Path three months ago, his breakthrough would happen at any given time. Earlier, while fighting three experts of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, he unexpectedly noticed signs that his Spiritual power was about to breakthrough.This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a breakthrough. Naturally, he did not dare to make any delays.\u201cOthers are in the realm of Spiritual Sea, but I\u2019m in the Ultimate Spiritual Sea.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled.In the first place, the Heavenly Creation Skill was Heaven defying cultivation method.Cultivating the skill was an act in defiance of the natural order. With every step, he was defying nature and becoming extraordinary.Ordinary martial arts who cultivated the Spirit Path were in the spiritual realm of Seven Realms of Spirit steps. Martial artists cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill, on the other hand, was in the Nine Heavens of Divine Path.The typical warrior would be in the Spiritual Sea from Spiritual power, while those who cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill would breakthrough into the Ultimate Spiritual Sea.\u201cI wonder what\u2019s the so-called expansion of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea?\u201d Jian Wushuang felt excited. Inside him, his condensed Spiritual power was charging at the barrier of his breakthrough, crashing into it.The Spiritual power only made impact several times for breaking the barrier. The rest of his Spiritual power instantly flowed into all his tendons and vessels.Here came the Ultimate Spiritual Sea!He finally understood the Ultimate Spiritual Sea really was after the breakthrough.\u201cIt\u2019s the amount of spiritual power. I\u2019ve only broken through into the Spiritual Sea Realm, but there\u2019s so much more spiritual power in my body. I\u2019d say it\u2019s 10 times more than the ordinary Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior.\u201d Surprise crossed his face.Compared with the Spiritual Sea from Spiritual power of ordinary warriors, the Spiritual power of Ultimate Spiritual Sea is vaster.The Spiritual Sea Realm was divided into three levels, namely the Initial, Profound and Exceptional Realm. There would be a vast improvement in Spiritual power in every level advancement. But it was a different story for Ultimate Spiritual Sea.Instead of having the Profound Realm and Initial Realm stages, the Ultimate Spiritual Sea had three levels that increased the amount of Spiritual power with each advancement.Now that Jian Wushuang had entered the first level of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, his Spiritual power was 10 times the amount of Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior.In Stage Two of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, his Spiritual power would be 100 times the amount of Spiritual Sea Realm Warriors.If he reached Stage Three, then his Spiritual power could be described as truly endless.The amount of Spiritual power available should not be taken lightly. Warriors need a strong foundation of Spiritual power whether to fight with others or display their martial arts. If they exhaust their Spiritual power from a prolonged battle or tricky martial arts, they could only wait to be killed.And what did an endless Spiritual power meant?That meant if he was fighting someone of a similar strength, he could rely on his endless Spiritual power to prolong the battle and wait for his opponent to exhaust his own.This was truly an unbelievably strong advantage.However, through all three levels of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, only the amount of Spiritual power would increase and not strengthen itself. That was to say, his spiritual force outbreak would remain consistent throughout. This was unlike ordinary Spiritual Sea Realm Warriors who would see a great improvement in their Spiritual power outbreak with each level breakthrough.But that did not bother Jian Wushuang. \u201cIt\u2019s only normal that Spiritual power outbreak doesn\u2019t improve.\u201dAfter all, his Spiritual power outbreak was already comparable to that of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm when he was at the peak of the Ninth Heaven of Divine Path. If his Spiritual power increased to its peak after achieving the final level of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, could anyone still survive after fighting him?\u201cMy Spiritual power outbreak\u2026\u201d He closed his eyes and made a fist. He felt the explosive power in his hand, experiencing a far stronger energy than he had ever felt. A smile came to his face.\u201cI\u2019ve now broken through into the Ultimate Spiritual Sea. Though I won\u2019t see any improvements in my Spiritual power outbreak in the second and third stage in the future, my current Spiritual power outbreak is now good enough to surpass an expert of the Gold Core Realm.\u201dHe was only in the first level of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea, yet he had Spiritual power outbreak of a Primordial Gold Core. His Spiritual power, in particular, surpassed that of ordinary Spiritual Sea Realm Warriors. This was the ultimate cultivation of the sky after the expansion of the Ultimate Spiritual Sea!\u2026Just as Jian Wushuang was marveling at his breakthrough, something else was going on in the underground secret chamber of the Tianhuan Sect.Shadows wrapped in black robes appeared one after another.\u201cThe screams above are getting fainter. Looks like the fighting is coming to an end in the Tianhuan Sect,\u201d a man with silver mask said.The warriors of the Golden-dragon Palace have been fighting above for nearly two hours, enough time for them to wipe out the entire Sect twice. Most Spiritual Sea Realm warriors of the Tianhuan Sect had already been slaughtered. Most who remained had already fled, with only a handful still scattered in the corners of the sect.Basically, the fight was about to be over very soon.But just then, something happened.Boom!The door to the secret room was kicked open, followed by the sound of hearty laughter.\u201cHaha! I didn\u2019t expect there\u2019s a secret room inside the Tianhuan Sect. What\u2019s in this room?\u201dAll the robed men inside the secret room instantly became cold when they heard the laughter.The door of the secret room opened and four shadows stepped one after another. If Jian Wushuang were here, he would definitely recognize them at a glance for they were the ones who had framed him in the past.The minute the four men stepped into the secret room, the nine robed men all glared at them with a deadly coldness. The silver-masked man\u2019s gaze was even more severe, piercing enough to stab a human heart like a sword.\u201cOh?\u201dFeeling the glares of the robed men, the four men seemed like their hearts had momentarily stopped beating.That stout man opened his mouth, wanting to say something. But in that instant, the silver-masked man instantly disappeared. When he reappeared again, he was already standing behind the stout man.The stout man\u2019s eyes rounded. He felt a warm sensation in his throat and found only gushing warm blood when he touched his throat.Thud! The four intruders collapsed on the ground.The silver-masked man suddenly spoke, his cold voice reverberating inside the secret room.\u201cSince we\u2019re already exposed, there\u2019s no longer any need to hide. Follow me and just kill our way out. I\u2019d like to see who dare stop me!\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had five experts following him earlier, but now one was missing.There were too many Spiritual Sea Realm warriors in the Tianhuan Sect. Though Dongfang Yu and his five companions of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm were strong, it was not enough for them to rampage through the sect. Not too long ago, they even lost one of their companions in a fierce battle.\u201cIt\u2019s been two hours. Those Tianhuan Sect warriors that weren\u2019t dead had all fled. There aren\u2019t many of them left. We\u2019ve found three Interspatial Ring. I suppose the rest have found the remaining seven,\u201d said Dongfang Yu.The four people behind him appeared grim.Dongfang Yu would definitely claim one of the three things, while they had to share the remaining two. Two of them were destined to go back empty-handed, failing to accomplish the mission.\u201cThese two Interspatial Ring\u2026\u201d Dongfang Yu was just about to assign the rings between themselves.Boom!When they felt a terrifying aura suddenly emerging, the five of them immediately turned toward the source of the aura. They saw robed shadows appearing one after another, all wearing masks and bearing intense murderous intentions.The one who was the most striking was the man with the silver mask. He was the source of the terrifying aura they felt earlier, so strong that Dongfang Yu could not help the change in his expression.\u201cGold Core!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an expert of the Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s actually an expert of the Gold Core Realm in the Tianhuan Sect?\u201dEveryone from the Golden-dragon Palace was also shocked after sensing the fearsome aura.The difference between the Primordial Gold Core and the Spiritual Sea Realm was like heaven and earth. Even Dongfang Yu, who was close to achieving the Gold Core, would be defeated by an expert of Gold Core Realm. Worse, he could even be instantly killed.The fearsome aura burst forth from within the silver-masked man, seemingly forming a great storm. When the man charged forward, the storm seemed to be swept away.\u201cDeath to those who stop me!\u201d the man roared, creating a commotion in the Tianhuan Sect that had just recently fallen into a brief silence.\u201cLet\u2019s go, fast,\u201d Dongfang Yu said. Together with his four companions, he jumped off the roof in haste and disappeared. He was afraid to even show up in the robed men\u2019s line of sight for fear of them targeting him.Whoosh!A figure abruptly appeared before the group of robed men. It was none other than the grey-clothed elder, Mr. Huo.\u201cAre you people from the Blood Feather Tower?\u201d Mr. Huo appeared grim. He did not expect there would be so many assassins of the Blood Feather Tower to be hidden within the Tianhuan Sect.\u201cGood that you know.\u201dThe silver-masked man relaxed when he saw the man before him was a mere Gold Core warrior and realized that the Golden-dragon Ambassador was gone. He sneered and said, \u201cOur Blood Feather Tower doesn\u2019t intend on making enemies with the Golden-dragon Palace. Today, you\u2019re here to destroy the Tianhuan Sect. That has nothing to do with us. We just so happen to witness it.\u201d\u201cIn that case, then I ask you that you leave immediately. In addition, you\u2019re not to fight with these rookies who have just accepted the mission of the Golden-dragon Guard. Otherwise\u2026\u201d Mr. Huo said in a low voice.As the number one assassination organization of Tianzhong Dynasty, the Blood Feather Tower did not have a pervasive influence in the Tiannan Province. But it was better not to provoke them if there was not a need to.\u201cDon\u201dt worry. We just want to leave this place. We naturally won\u2019t hurt them as long as they don\u2019t stop us.\u201d The silver-masked man smiled. He glanced at the eight black-robed men beside him and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Kill anyone who dares to get in our way!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTheir figures blurring into mere shadows, the black-robed men jumped onto the pavilion roof and started leaping from one roof to another. Whether it was the remaining Tianhuan Sect disciples or the rookies from the Golden-dragon Palace, none dared to stop the impressive sight of an expert of Gold Core Realm leading eight Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm warriors.Just then, Jian Wushuang had stepped out of the attic after breaking through into the Ultimate Spiritual Sea.The moment he came out, he instantly sensed the terrifying aura permeating the Tianhuan Sect. He immediately leaped to the roof, finding Yin Min and Ling Tianhao already there.\u201cThose are\u2026\u201dYin Min and Ling Tianhao noticed many robed silhouettes leaping across roofs, charging in their direction. They were particularly frightened by the terrifying aura bursting from the silver-masked man.They both immediately recognized the silver-masked man.\u201cIt\u2019s a Gold Core Standout!\u201d\u201cOne Gold Core and eight Profound Spiritual Sea Realm warriors. They\u2019re heading in our direction. Let\u2019s retreat!\u201dThey did not hesitate and also warned Jian Wushuang. \u201cSwordsman, hurry up and leave!\u201dBut Jian Wushuang did not show any signs of wanting to escape. He remained rooted in place, staring coolly at the robed shadows before him.Black robes, masks\u2026\u201cBlood Feather Tower!\u201dHe muttered these three words through gritted teeth, as a burning Killing intent raged within him.Om!He swiped at the men with a ringing sound, releasing his sword essence.The majestic stream of murderous intention and sword essence merged together to be one and flew up to the Ninth Heaven!The incomparably mysterious power within his body, the power of Sword Soul, in his body seemed to be gradually awakening at the same time.Jian Wushuang had unsheathed his Triple-kill Sword in a flash and stood coolly on the roof of the attic as if he was the King of Swordsmanship dominating everyone\u2019s lives and deaths, drawing everyone\u2019s attention to him.\u201cSwordsman, hurry up and go!\u201dYin Min and Ling Tianhao were surprised to see Jian Wushuang not escaping. Instead, he was standing there bearing a strong intention to battle it out with the robed men.In every corner of the Tianhuan Sect, the surviving warriors who had accepted the mission were all standing on rooftops. They had also spotted the figure emitting a strong fighting desire.\u201cIt\u2019s him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the swordsman?\u201dThese people recognized Jian Wushuang.\u201cWhat is this trash trying to do?

Both sides continued moving towards each other.The black-robed men fiercely raced across the rooftops. Upon noticing Jian Wushuang standing in their way, their eyes flashed with killing intent.\u201cKill him,\u201d said one of the black-robed men.Like to said to Mr. Huo, they only wanted to leave. But if someone wanted to stop them, they would attack and kill them without hesitation. Jian Wushuang was clearly planning to stop them.\u201cSwordsman, retreat!\u201d\u201cRetreat, retreat, retreat!\u201dYin Min and Ling Tianhao shouted widely at Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang did not move at all.\u201cRetreat? Should I retreat?\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d Jian Wushuang roared in his heart.He was too weak four months ago, so he could only run away while being chased by a great number of silver and golden masked assassins from the Blood Feather Tower. But now, four months later, everything had changed. More importantly, his opponents were just one silver masked assassin and eight copper masked assassins.They were not strong enough to make him retreat.Since he\u00a0did not have to retreat, he would fight!This is war!\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to stand out in the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace because there were too many people around. But everything that happens during the Golden-dragon Palace task is top secret. No one would dare to spread the information. So I don\u2019t have to worry about drawing attention or my true strength being revealed.\u201dJian Wushuang raised his head, looking at them with cold eyes that were void of any emotion. He moved directly in front of the black-robed men and abruptly swung his Triple-kill sword.The first move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow!The speed of his sword flashed out. At this moment, it was even more incredible, cold, and harsh than ever before.On the roof, except for the silver-masked man, the other eight black-robed men saw a dazzling sword light move towards them, with the reflection in their eyes growing larger.The sword light was too fast.A hint of panic could be felt coming from the eight black-robed men. In the next moment, the sword flash swept past the necks of those eight men without any obstruction.The eight black-robed men fell down without making a sound.All of a sudden, the whole Tianhuan Sect went dead still.Silence, dead silence!Everyone in the Tianhuan Sect was shocked by this terrifying sword speed.On top of the roof, the silver-masked man in a black robe was the only one still standing in front of Jian Wushuang. He glanced at the black-robed men who had all just died and felt frightened.He also saw the stroke from Jian Wushuang.The only one stroke swept past the necks of the eight men at an amazing speed, killing all eight of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm assassins from Blood Feather Tower.\u201cWho are you?\u201d The silver-masked man in a black robe asked with unprecedented seriousness.\u201cI am Swordsman,\u201d Jian Wushuang answered indifferently.\u201cI only want to leave here. I\u2019m not trying to impede your task and I\u2019m not a person from the Tianhuan Sect. I shouldn\u2019t be a target from your task,\u201d the silver-masked man in a black robe said in a low voice.\u201cIt has nothing to do with the Golden-dragon Palace. You were all dead the moment I saw you,\u201d Jian Wushuang said without any emotion.\u201cLet\u2019s see who die first!\u201d The silver-masked man in a black robe turned into a stream of light and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. A dark red dagger pierced the air and immediately moved towards Jian Wushuang\u2019s head with an unprecedented speed. At the same time, a gruff voice from the silver-masked man in black robe rang out,\u201cGo to hell.\u201dThe eyes of the silver-masked man in a black robe were filled with killing intent. As an assassin at the silver mask level in the Blood Feather Tower, his first move was a slaughter move.\u201cRidiculous!\u201d said Jian Wushuang. Smiling indifferently, he and charged toward the killer.This seemingly casual sword move was the first move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.The speed of the sword light was unbelievably quick.\u201cThat was the sword movement.\u201dThe grey-robed elder, Mr. Huo, concentrated on this rooftop fight in the near distance. He looked serious. \u201cSword Essence of Gale, he grasped a sense of the Sword Essence of Gale. And his understanding of it is very deep. The sword movement was so quick.\u201dYes, the speed was very fast.The dark red dagger had not reached Jian Wushuang, yet the sword light from Jian Wushuang\u2019s attack had already moved towards the silver-masked man in a black robe.Clang!As a deep metal crash sounded, the silver-masked man suddenly felt a strong power surge through his dark red dagger. The power of the clash instantly numbed his hands\u00a0and forced him to retreat.The silver-masked man gaped in shock at Jian Wushuang , \u201cHe hasn\u2019t reach Primordial Golden Core, but his Spiritual Power is as strong as mine. More importantly, his swordsmanship is faster and superior to mine.\u201d\u201cSword Essence!\u201d\u201cYes, he has grasped a sense of Sword Essence.\u201dIt was no wonder that the silver-masked man in a black robe was so stunned. He could tell that Jian Wushuang had not reached the level of Primordial Golden Pill yet.After all, Spiritual Power had a qualitative change once it reached the level of Primordial Golden Pill. Once it was released, Spiritual Power at the Primordial Golden Pill level couldn\u2019t be hidden. He didn\u2019t sense an aura at the level of the Golden Pill from Jian Wushuang.So he was sure that Jian Wushuang had not reached the level of Primordial Golden Pill Realm.This alone was enough to thoroughly surprise him.He has reached the peak of Initial Gold Core Realm, and there was only one step away from Profound Gold Core Realm. He used a slaughter move, but he was thoroughly defeated by Jian Wushuang, who had not\u00a0even reached the Gold Core yet.\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dThe silver-masked man in a black robe instantly made a decision.He could only run.As an assassin, speed was his strong point, so he fled for his life. However, the speed of Jian Wushuang was much faster than his.\u201cTrying to escape?\u201d Jian Wushuang said indifferently.\u201cWhat?\u201d The silver-masked man in a black robe was astonished and filled with a sense of bitterness. \u201cWarriors with a sense of the Sword Essence of Gale are best at speed.\u201d\u201cGo to hell,\u201d Jian Wushuang said while releasing a strong killing intent.It was the second move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Sword-killing Movement.A dazzling and bloody sword light appeared.\u201cThis strike is even faster and stronger than the previous one.\u201d The silver-masked man in a black robe was full of despair and he even gave up on fighting back at this moment. The dazzling bloody sword light easily slashed out through his neck.Spurt!The silver-masked man in a black robe, at the level of Initial Gold Core Realm, was lying dead on the ground.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes were empty. He simply could not believe it.He killed eight people in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. He even killed the Gold Core Realm expert in one move. That man didn\u2019t even get a chance to run away. What level was his strength at?And it was the same man that could not take three moves from him during recruitment that did it. He couldn\u2019t believe it.He recalled what he said to Jian Wushuang at the beginning of the mission: \u201cYou are just a waste. There are so many people in the Tianhuan Sect that can kill you.\u201dHis words had been full of disdain! Thinking back to those words, Dongfang Yu\u2019s complexion became very pale.He suddenly realized that Jian Wushuang must have lost on purpose.After killing the silver-masked man in a black robe on the roof, Jian Wushuang looked over and noticed Dongfang Yu inside the courtyard.Whoosh!Jian Wushuang moved swiftly towards Dongfang Yu, appearing in front of him in a second.Whoosh!An icy sword edge hit Dongfang Yu\u2019s throat.\u201cHand over your Interspatial Ring, or you will die!\u201d Jian Wushuang said coldly without any emotion.Dongfang Yu moved his throat, clearly sensing the icy sword edge, remembering the recent death of the man of Gold Core Realm. He had no doubt that Jian Wushuang could do it.The four people behind Dongfang Yu had disdained Jian Wushuang earlier, but now they did not even dare to breathe.Should I refuse? Dongfang Yu roared in mind. His small and fragile self-esteem fought with his reason, but in the end, his reason prevailed.While trembling, Dongfang Yu handed over an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang without too much hesitation.Jian Wushuang took the Interspatial Ring and smiled. He looked Dongfang Yu up and down as if he was a contemptible scoundrel. Finally, Jian Wushuang withdrew and sheathed the Triple-kill Sword, walking away without a single word.Dongfang Yu and the four people sighed with relief after Jian Wushuang went away. At that moment, they were totally soaked in sweat, especially Dongfang Yu. He was still trembling even now. Suddenly Dongfang Yu turned to the four people behind him.\u201cAn Interspatial Ring was taken away by Swordsman. That means only two people can finish the task now.\u201d Dongfang Yu looked gloomy.Then the complexions of the four people behind Dongfang Yu turned serious.Yin Min and Ling Tianhao were waiting in the courtyard. It didn\u2019t take long for Jian Wushuang to arrive.Ling Tianhao moved towards Jian Wushuang and smiled, \u201chaha, Swordsman, Innate Gold Core Realm, a real Gold Core Realm expert was killed by you. You are so awesome!\u201d\u201cYou were indeed awesome, Swordsman!\u201d Yin Min gave Jian Wushuang the thumbs-up, \u201d Well, the reason why your strength improved so much was because you had made a breakthrough, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.The reason that he was able to kill the eight in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm with only one stroke and even kill the silver-masked man in a black robe, who was at the peak of the Initial Gold Core Realm, was because he made a breakthrough and reached the Ultimate Spirit Sea. As a result, his Spiritual Power improved to a level similar to an average warrior in the Gold Core Realm.If he had not made a breakthrough, he could not have killed the silver-masked man in black robe so easily.\u201cWe should leave here.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cWhat about the Ring?\u201d Ling Tianhao asked.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I took an\u00a0Interspatial Ring just now.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cOh?\u201d Yin Min and Ling Tianhao both felt surprised.\u201cI saw Dongfang Yu and snatched an Interspatial Ring from him just now,\u201d said Jian Wushuang, smiling weirdly.After hearing that, both Yin Min and Ling Tianhao showed great interest.\u201cHaha, Swordsman, did you confront Dongfang Yu?\u201d Ling Tianhao looked excited.\u201cI don\u2019t think Dongfang Yu has enough courage to fight with you. He must have handed over the Interspatial Ring immediately. Haha, I wonder how terrible the expression on his face was,\u201d Yin Min said and laughed.\u201cCertainly, it must have been very ugly,\u201d Ling Tianhao said and also laughed.Both Yin Min and Ling Tianhao had some kind of beef with Dongfang Yu, so they disliked him. But they both could not contend with him. So it was reasonable for them to be so excited when they heard that Dongfang Yu suffered a defeat on Swordsman\u2019s hand.Jian Wushuang only shook his head and smiled.In his eyes, Dongfang Yu was just a contemptible scoundrel and could not make a difference at all.Outside this gigantic valley, the grey-robed elder Mr. Huo waited quietly. Some warriors in the One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission had recently returned. Mr. Huo didn\u2019t pay any attention to them though. However, when Jian Wushuang, Lin Min and Lin Tianhao came back safe and sound, everyone immediately looked in their direction.\u201cSwordsman!\u201d\u201cAlthough he only reached Spiritual Sea Realm, he killed an expert in Primordial Gold Core!\u201d\u201cIt was too awesome!\u201dThe people who witnessed the death of the nine black-robed men had complicated expressions while they looked at Jian Wushuang more carefully this time.Even the grey-robed elder, Mr. Huo, gave Jian Wushuang a friendly smile.Mr. Huo said gently, \u201cWell done, kiddo!\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Jian Wushuang said modestly.\u201cPlease wait for a while,\u201d said Mr. Huo with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dongfang Yu, followed by the brown-haired man, was the last to arrive, but his appearance looked a little unnatural.\u201cIt\u2019s good that there are still 15 people alive in the end,\u201d Mr. Huo said indifferently with a casual glance.However, everyone else looked awestruck.\u201cMore than 30 people at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm accepted this mission, but only 15 people survived in the end. In other words, more than half of the people died during the mission. Some were killed by disciples from the Tianhuan Sect, while the ones killed by fellow examinees is probably not only a few.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought secretly.Take Dongfang Yu for example. He was followed by five martial masters in the beginning, but now there was only the brown-haired man, who was seriously injured. So it was very clear to Jian Wushuang how the other four people had died.\u201cEveryone who has an Interspatial Ring should give it to me,\u201d said Mr. Huo.Among the 15 people who survived, ten stepped forward to hand in their rings. At which point, Mr. Huo took out a list and recorded their names.After recording their names, Mr. Huo waved his hand and threw them gold rings.\u201cThese are your Gold-Dragon Rings. The claw marks represent your rank in the Gold-Dragon Guard. One claw mark stands for One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard while two stands for Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard. From this day forth, you are members of the Gold-Dragon Guard,\u201d Mr. Huo said loudly.After receiving the rings, Jian Wushuang and the other nine, who had completed the task, immediately used their blood to bind the rings.\u201cIs this an Interspatial ring?\u201d Jian Wushuang became aware of the space contained in the Interspatial ring when he inspected it with his mind. Then he laughed and said, \u201cThis Interspatial ring will make it more convenient to carry things.\u201d\u201cYou should be exhausted after completing the task, so you can take a break before returning to Qingdong City.\u201d After saying this, Mr. Huo glanced at Jian Wushuang and said: \u201cLittle guy, come with me.\u201dJian Wushuang felt surprised as he followed Mr. Huo to the side.\u201cLittle guy, you hid so well. I did not notice the slightest flaw when you were defeated by Dongfang Yu within three rounds three days ago.\u201d Mr. Huo glanced at Jian Wushuang with a smile.Jian Wushuang only smiled awkwardly.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, you should have some grievances with the Blood Feather Tower, right?\u201d Mr. Huo asked suddenly.Jian Wushuang\u2019s complexion changed immediately.\u201cIt seems that I guessed right.\u201d It was clear to Mr. Huo when he saw the change in Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression. \u201cEvery action has a reason. There must have been a reason for you to prefer giving up your face and allowing Dongfang Yu to defeat you within three rounds at the Gold-Dragon Subsidiary Palace. Yet, during this mission, you killed all the people from Blood Feather Tower. So, I guessed that you must have a huge feud with Blood Feather Tower.\u201dHearing that, Jian Wushuang could only shrug his shoulders, replying in a deep voice, \u201cI do, in fact, have a grudge with Blood Feather Tower. Unless I die, I will never stop seeking revenge.\u201d\u201cUnless you die?\u201d Mr. Huo frowned.\u201cBlood Feather Tower is the number one assassin organization in the Tianzong Dynasty. Their actions are very cruel and extreme. In the Tianzong Dynasty, there are many people who have grudges with the Blood Feather Tower, deathless endlessly, but Tiannan Province is not the main province where Blood Feather Tower operates. Their insidious hidden strength cannot be underestimated. If you are spotted by them, you will be in a big trouble,\u201d Mr. Huo said and smiled.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, the rehabilitation capacity of our Golden-dragon Palace is always good and in general, it\u2019s not possible to let out the course of this mission. Therefore, although you have killed several martial experts of Blood Feather Tower, you don\u2019t need to worry about being spotted by the people of Blood Feather Tower.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Jian Wushuang said and nodded.But don\u2019t worry, our Gold-dragon Palace is always good at dealing with the aftermath. In general, it\u2019s impossible for the information of this mission to be leaked. Therefore, although you have killed several experts from Blood Feather Tower, you won\u2019t have to\u00a0worry about being targeted by Blood Feather Tower.\u201d\u201cLittle guy, you should have heard of Dragon Palace?\u201d Mr. Huo asked suddenly.\u201cOf course I have.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.\u201cIt will be much simpler if you already know about the Dragon Palace. Are you interested in cultivating in the Dragon Palace?\u201d ask Mr. Huo while smiling mysteriously.\u201cGo to the Dragon Palace to cultivate? \u201d Jian Wushuang asked while surprised.Dragon Palace was a Holy Place full of exceptional geniuses!Jian Wushuang has always wanted to join a group like Dragon Palace, a place which was full of geniuses and monsters.\u201cCan I join Dragon Palace? \u201d Jian Wushuang asked immediately.\u201cI\u2019m uncertain whether you can actually join Dragon Palace to cultivate. But, based on your performance in the Tianhuan Sect, you can easily kill someone at the peak of Initial Gold Core Realm in just two moves while you are only in Spiritual Sea Realm. This is incredible and you can absolutely be called a monster, so you have a very good chance of entering Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cTherefore, if you are willing to wait, I will ask for a Gold-Dragon Ambassador to come and verify your actual strength once we return to Qingdong City. As long as you can gain the recognition and recommendation of the Gold-Dragon Ambassador, you will have a chance cultivate at Dragon Palace.\u201dMr. Huo paused and glanced at Jian Wushuang afterwards, \u201d so I\u2019ll ask you now, do you want to go to Dragon Palace for cultivation?\u201d\u201cYes, of course I do,\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded and said immediately, without any hesitation.Dragon Palace was a Holy Place for cultivation. Numerous talents in the Tianzong Dynasty were eager to join and cultivate, and Jian Wushuang was no exception.After all, a warrior who cultivated blindly by himself could become an expert, but compared with warriors who had a lot of resources and were instructed by experts, he would still be inferior.Jian Wushuang possessed remarkable ability in swordmanship because he had followed his father in practicing swordsmanship since he was a child. Therefore, he knew very well that there was a large difference between having a teacher and learning on his own.\u201cHaha, I will immediately arrange for you as you wish after returning to Qingdong City. In addition, it doesn\u2019t matter if you eventually didn\u2019t enter into Dragon Palace, but once you enter into Dragon Palace, you needn\u2019t care about Blood Feather Tower. Because Dragon Palace will protect its talented disciples strictly, even Blood Feather Tower is hard to find chance to kill you, and even if there is a chance, they dare not to kill the disciples of Dragon Palace.\u201d Mr. Huo said with a smile.After hearing these words, Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes lit up again.What was he most worried about? It was not having the chance to grow up and become stronger, the chance that Blood Feather Tower did not want to give him. If he joined the Dragon Palace, he could grow up slowly over the next few years under the protection of the Dragon Palace. He would eve have a chance to grow strong enough to make the Blood Feather Tower treat him seriously, maybe even fear him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some looked envious, some appeared shocked, and there were also those who shot him looks of longing.Dongfang Yu\u2019s expression, in particular, was complex beyond measure.He still remembered how his Great Master, Zhu Tao, had been complimenting him on his ability to join the Dragon Place when they were in the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace. He said Dongfang Yu only lacked someone to recommend him. But Mr. Huo did not even spare him a glance.Yet Mr. Huo had taken the initiative to invite Jian Wushuang to join the Dragon Palace?The way he treated them both was too dramatically different.\u201cHumph! So what if Mr. Huo is willing to play matchmaker? The recommendation list is with the Golden-dragon Ambassador, not Mr. Huo. Even if Mr. Huo has the recommendation list, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll be able to join the Dragon Place if he wants to.\u201d Dongfang Yu was feeling a deep envy toward Jian Wushuang.\u201cNow, listen carefully.\u201d The sonorous voice of Mr. Huo suddenly reverberated as his gaze traveled around the place. \u201cThe missions issued by our Golden-dragon Palace have always been secrets. Though you\u2019ve joined the mission, you mustn\u2019t reveal anything about it whether it\u2019s the process or the result. If it is leaked and we find out it\u2019s you, we\u2019ll kill you no matter who you are.\u201dEveryone looked serious. No one dared to defy the rules of the Golden-dragon Palace.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go back to the Qingdong City.\u201d With a wave of Mr. Huo\u2019s hand, everyone immediately embarked on their way back to the Qingdong City.They all felt tense when they made their way here, but much more relaxed now that their mission was done. Those who had officially became the One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard were in especially high spirits.Before long, they made it back to the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace in the Qingdong City.The second they reached the place, Mr. Huo immediately said to Jian Wushuang, \u201cYoung man, come with me to see the Golden Dragon Ambassador.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cBrother Swordsman, I really need to thank you this time. Go ahead and see the Golden Dragon Messenger. When you return, we must have a good drink,\u201d said Ling Tianhao, smiling.\u201cHaozi (Mouse) and I will be waiting for you at the Celestial Immortal Residence with good wine,\u201d Yin Min said with a smile.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. He then followed Mr. Huo in the direction of the inner hall of the attic.When they came to an empty secret room, Mr. Huo said, \u201cWait here for a moment. I\u2019ll go meet the Golden Dragon Ambassador.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.Mr. Huo was not gone for long. Soon, he returned with a grim-looking middle-aged man dressed in a crimson robe.Jian Wushuang had met this man before. It was none other than the Golden-dragon Ambassador who had killed 14 experts of the Gold Core Realm of the Tianhuan Sect.He immediately bowed. \u201cYour Excellency, Golden Dragon Ambassador.\u201d\u201cHuo Man, is he the young man who you mentioned has the chance to cultivate in the Dragon Palace?\u201d The middle-aged man asked.\u201cYes, his name is Swordsman,\u201d Huo Man replied.\u201cSwordsman? It\u2019s probably a pseudonym.\u201d When the middle-aged man looked at Jian Wushuang, he felt as if he was being targeted by an ancient fierce beast.\u201cI\u2019ll introduce myself first, young man. I\u2019m Ye Rufeng and, as for my rank, you should be aware that I\u2019m the Golden-dragon Ambassador of the Golden-dragon Palace,\u201d Ye Rufeng said slowly. \u201cEarlier Huo Man has told me about you and he spoke highly of you. But the recommendation list to enter the Dragon Palace is in my hands. So if you want to join us for cultivation, you must first display enough talent to satisfy me.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cGood. I\u201dll be your opponent. Show me all that you\u201dve got and remember, you don\u2019t have many opportunities,\u201d Ye Rufeng said.\u201cYes.\u201dJian Wushuang took a deep breath, his expression turning solemn. As what Ye Rufeng had mentioned, he truly did not have many opportunities.\u201cGolden Dragon Ambassador, I\u2019ll start.\u201d He was already gripping his Triple-kill Sword and a strong fighting desire rose in him.\u201cFeel free to come at me.\u201d Ye Rufeng had his hands behind his back and wore an indifferent expression.\u201cAnonymous Swordsmanship, Sword-killing Movement.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes turned cold as he gathered his killing intent.A stream of dazzling bloody sword essence burst forth. His killing intent rose sharply at that moment, before being pushed to its peak.Ye Rufeng was surprised. \u201cOh? It\u2019s the Formless Swordsmanship?\u201dHe, as the Golden Dragon Messenger and the strongest warrior at the Yin-Yang Void Realm, was naturally familiar with the so-called first in the world, the Formless Swordsmanship.He did not use any Martial Arts Technique or show any of his amazing Cultivation of Spiritual Power. With a simple wave of his sleeves, he easily defused Jian Wushuang\u2019s strongest sword move. When he was done, he stretched out his fingers.Clang!He caught the edge of the Triple-kill Sword like a pincer. No matter how much Jian Wushuang struggled, he could not move the sword out of Ye Rufeng\u2019s firm hold.\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d Jian Wushuang was greatly shocked.He had long known that Yin-Yang Void Realm warriors had impressive strength but he did not expect it to be this strong.After making a breakthrough into the Ultimate Spirit Sea level, he could kill the strongest Initial Gold Core Realm with ease. But now the strongest move he could use was so easily defused by Ye Rufeng, to the point where his sword was even being controlled by mere fingers.\u201cYou\u2019re already pretty good to be able to use the second type of the Formless Swordsmanship to this extent.\u201d Ye Rufeng was still holding the Triple-kill Sword in place but he was now smiling at Jian Wushuang. \u201cYou imbued the Sword Essence of Gale in your swordsmanship and you also have a high comprehension of it. Not bad. Not bad at all.\u201dHe finally loosened his grip, allowing Jian Wushuang to retrieve his sword.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that I don\u2019t have a swordsmanship suitable for the Sword Essence of Earth. Otherwise\u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang balled his hands into fists, feeling unsatisfied with the outcome.He had comprehended Sword Essence of Gale and Sword Essence of Earth at nearly the same time. Though he comprehended the former earlier, he later realized that he comprehended Sword Essence of Earth faster and ended up doing just that in the Dark Forest in the past three months.Thus, he had a better comprehension of the Sword Essence of Earth.Unfortunately, he did not have a suitable swordsmanship to display it.Take his strongest move, the Anonymous Swordsmanship, as an example. It emphasized on speed and was most suitable to be used with the Sword Essence of Gale. When paired with the Sword Essence of Earth, it not only seemed out of place, its might was also reduced greatly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Little guy, you should prepare yourself to go to the Dragon Palace with me in two days.\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s eyes lit up because he understood that Ye Rufeng recognized his talent and was going to recommend him.\u201cThank you so much, Gold-Dragon Ambassador,\u201d Jian Wushuang said immediately.\u201cYou are welcome. It will also benefit me if you really become a disciple of Dragon Palace.\u201d Ye Rufeng gave a wave.Jian Wushuang nodded and then he left.Qingdong City, Celestial Immortal Residence.\u201cBrother Swordsman.\u201d\u201cSwordsman, how did it go?\u201dYin Min and Ling Tianhao had been waiting for him since earlier.\u201cThe Gold-Dragon Ambassador promised to recommend me. But it\u2019s not guaranteed that I can join Dragon Palace,\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cHaha, based on your strength, you should definitely be able to. Come on. Cheers,\u201d Ling Tianhao said and smiled.Jian Wushuang grabbed the wine cup and had a toast with Ling Tianhao.Although the time that he had been acquainted with Yin Min and Ling Tianhao was not long, he found that they were a spontaneous and merited group after getting along with them.\u201cThe status of a Gold-Dragon Ambassador is high and he knows a lot regarding Dragon Palace. Also, a Gold-Dragon Ambassador has a limited number of recommendations, so each recommendation is important. Since the Gold-Dragon Ambassador recommended you, it means that he thinks you have the ability to make it through the test to join Dragon Palace,\u201d Yin Min said.Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.Indeed, Ye Rufeng was well informed on the situation inside the Dragon Palace. Since he was willing to recommend him, it meant that he was confident in Jian Wushuang.\u201cHaha, based on that, you will definitely be able to join and cultivate in the Dragon Palace. Come on. Cheers! Cheers! Congratulations!\u201d Ling Tianhao said instantly.Jian Wushuang and Yin Min also lift their cups. The three of them were drinking with passion.Two days later, at the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.\u201cLittle guy, are you ready? Let\u2019s go,\u201d Ye Rufeng said.Jian Wushuang nodded and then he left the city with Ye Rufeng. Now, they were outside of the city.\u201cGrasp my hand,\u201d Ye Rufeng said.After grasping Ye Rufeng\u2019s hand without hesitance, Jian Wushuang felt a special power gathering beneath Ye Rufeng\u2019s feet. Subsequently, the figure of Ye Rufeng was floating and then Jian Wushuang also began floating.Then\u2026 Hoom!They left at an incredible speed.\u201cIs this Voidwalk?\u201d Jian Wushuang was surprised and became even more eager to reach the Yin-Yang Void Realm.The distance between the Dragon Palace and Qingdong City was equal to the most remote provinces. It would take one or two months to rush to the Dragon Palace if Jian Wushuang walked there on his own. But now it would only take one day to rush to the Dragon Palace under Ye Rufeng\u2019s lead.\u201cIs this the Dragon Palace?\u201dJian Wushuang was still floating in the air, overlooking the boundless ground in astonishment. Below him, he saw an area between two giant mountains, full of\u00a0magnificent palaces and pavilions that towered above the ground.In the center, a statue of a gold dragon was coiled up, appearing as if it was flying to the Ninth Heaven.\u201cLet\u2019s go down.\u201dYe Rufeng dived down along with Jian Wushuang. Upon reaching the ground, many figures appeared in front of them.These people all wore the same golden armors and helmets, holding golden long spears. When they saw Ye Rufeng, they paid their respects instantly and said, \u201cYour Excellency!\u201d\u201cWhere are the two Palace Masters?\u201d Ye Rufeng asked directly.\u201cThey are both staying at the Dragon Gate,\u201d A Golden-armored Sergeant, a leader among them, said,\u201cOh. The Dragon Gate? Is there an exceptional genius going through the Dragon Gate Pass? He should be fascinating if he drew the attention of the two Palace Masters!\u201d replied Ye Rufeng.\u201cYes. He is new, but his talent is unbelievable. It\u2019s said that he has made it through the sixth layer,\u201d said the Golden-armored Sergeant.\u201cWhat? The sixth layer?\u201d Ye Rufeng was shocked and then waved his hand, saying, \u201cCarry on with your duties. I\u2019ll go meet the two Palace Masters on my own.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Those Golden-armored Sergeants went back to work immediately. However, they could not help glancing at Jian Wushuang as they left.Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression was serious. Once those Golden-armored Sergeants were gone, he could not help asking, \u201cYour Excellency, those Sergeants are all experts in the Gold Core Realm?\u201d\u201cYes. And their strength is at the peak of the Gold Core Realm.\u201d Ye Rufeng smiled casually and continued saying, \u201cthose Golden-armored Sergeants are the Emperor-guarding Army that is well known in the Tianzong Dynasty. They specifically guard the imperial palace and some other important areas. They are the most elite and violent force in the Tianzong Dynasty. The battle strength of the army is astonishing. The minimum strength required to become a Sergeant in the Emperor-guarding Army the Peak of the Golden Core Realm!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang was astonished.The minimum strength required for normal Sergeants was the peak of the Gold Core Realm?\u201cLittle guy, I have heard from Huo Man that you have a great enmity with the Blood Feather Tower, and that it\u2019s irreconcilable. Is that right?\u201d Ye Rufeng asked while looking at Jian Wushuang.\u201cYes,\u201d Jian Wushuang said and nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the Blood Feather Tower. As long as you can make it through the Dragon Palace\u2019s test and become a disciple of Dragon Palace, you will be protected. The Dragon Palace is located at the campsite of the Emperor-guarding Army. There are many experts. The Blood Feather Tower has no way to kill you in the Dragon Palace, even if they sent all of their experts here,\u201d said Ye Rufeng.Jian Wushuang believed him.\u201cYour Excellency. Is the Dragon Gate that the Sergeant mentioned also the testing area for joining the Dragon Palace?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cYou are clever. Yes, a carp jumping into the Dragon Gate means that you are successful. Every disciple who joins and cultivates in the Dragon Palace has to make it through the Dragon Gate Pass. That is the test you must pass,\u201d Ye Rufeng narrated.\u201cThe test in the Dragon Gate is special. It doesn\u2019t test your Cultivation, Spiritual Power, or your Martial Arts Technique. It tests your comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.\u201d\u201cThe Dragon Gate has total 13 layers. The first layer requires comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. The higher your comprehension, the more layers you go through. Under normal circumstances, the minimum for joining the Dragon Palace is to make it through the third layer.\u201d\u201cBecause your swordsmanship was executed using your comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale, I think that you are very likely to make it through the third layer. That is why I recommended you,\u201d Ye Rufeng said.\u201cBased on my comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale, it is very likely that I can make it through the third layer?\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression became strange.From what the Golden-armored Sergent said earlier, a new person, like him, that just arrived, was currently going through the Dragon Gate and had already passed through the sixth layer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is the Dragon Gate.\u201dYe Rufeng led Jian Wushuang to a towering golden pavilion. At a glance, the pavilion appeared to have 13 levels.At the moment, many people were standing in front of the golden pavilion. The two most prominent people were an old man wearing a black robe and a graceful woman dressed in white.Even though Ye Rufeng was an expert, upon seeing these two people he bowed to pay his respects and said, \u201d Greetings, Palace Master Black and Palace Master White.\u201d\u201cYe Rufeng.\u201d The graceful woman in white looked at him and Jian Wushuang, then said with a smile, \u201cYou brought this little guy to go through the Dragon Gate?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Ye Rufeng with a nod.\u201cYou will have to wait a minute. Someone else is already going through the Dragon Gate now,\u201d said the graceful woman in white, then she turned her head immediately.Ye Rufeng and Jian Wushuang had no choice but to wait quietly.Jian Wushuang lifted his head and looked at the towering golden pavilion. The lowest six levels of this 13 level golden pavilion were shining. Jian Wushuang knew it meant that six levels had been passed by the genius that was currently going through the Dragon Gate.Currently, the genius was making his way through the seventh level.Suddenly, the seventh level of the golden pavilion also burst out with a golden light.\u201cHe passed the seventh level!\u201d Ye Rufeng shouted out in shock. Many others outside of the golden pavilion also shouted out in surprise.\u201cSir Ye, is it amazing that he passed the seventh level?\u201d Jian Wushuang couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cAmazing. It is really amazing.\u201d Ye Rufeng nodded seriously and said, \u201cI have told you that moving through the Dragon Gate is based on your comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. It\u2019s likely that you could make it through the third level with your comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale. But it\u2019s hard to say if you could make it through the fourth level.\u201d\u201cAs for the seventh level, it\u2019s a huge bottleneck. Generally speaking, only someone with comprehension equal to an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm can make it through.\u201d\u201cIn other words, if someone gets through the seventh level, it means that his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is not less than an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm?\u201d Jian Wushuang was shocked.How strong was an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm? How high was an expert\u2019s comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth?Jian Wushuang could not imagine it. However, he knew that the amount of time he spent comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth was short. Although he reached a certain level of understanding, there were numerous people whose comprehension was higher than his just among experts in the Gold Core Realm. As for the Yin-Yang Void Realm, he was too far away from them.\u201cIf going through the seventh level is amazing, how about the eighth level?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.Suddenly, the eighth level of the golden pavilion immediately burst out with golden light.He passed through the eighth level!\u201cThe eighth level.\u201d Ye Rufeng had a shocked expression.\u201cNo wonder the two Palace Maters of Dragon Palace came, a marvelous new member has appeared. Even before cultivating in Dragon Palace, he can already pass through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. There\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019ll make greater progress after cultivating in Dragon Palace. His achievements will be even more spectacular.\u201d\u201cHe is really a peerless genius!\u201dYe Rufeng was full of praise, but Jian Wushuang only gave a shrug after listening to his explanation.He was just good in the eyes of Ye Rufeng, but the genius going through the Dragon Gate was praised by Ye Rufeng. With this, it\u2019s easy to see how amazingly talented he was.Going through the Eighth Level of Dragon Gate represented that his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth had surpassed many experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm. It also induced a burst of surprise outside of the Golden Pavilion. However, the eighth was the limit. The ninth level of the Golden Pavilion did not light up in the end.Jingle!The gate of the Golden Pavilion opened. Wearing a blood-red robe, with a blood-red saber on his back, a young man slowly appeared before the eyes of the crowd.Everyone looked at the young man for the first time, including Jian Wushuang.He was slender and handsome with a hint of indifference and pride on his face, a glimmer of an unyielding will was hidden in the deep of his eyes, and he emanated an aura of coldness.\u201cThe man\u2026 is cold.\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned secretly.\u201cHaha, little guy. Welcome to Dragon Palace.\u201d The Black and White Palace Masters, as well as the nearby experts of the Dragon Palace, all greeted him with a smile.\u201cLittle guy, what\u2019s your name and how old are you?\u201d Palace Master White asked with good intentions.\u201cYang Zaixuan, 21,\u201d he replied in a cold voice.Everyone who heard him was immediately surprised.\u201c21?\u201d\u201cHe is only 21 years old, yet his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is already so high!\u201d\u201cHe managed to pass through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. The most dazzling talent in Dragon Palace only made it through the eighth level.\u201d\u201cAwesome! Our Dragon Palace will become boisterous. Bai Cheng finally has a rival.\u201dMany disciples of Dragon Palace that were present were talking about that.A 21-year-old man had gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. Even in Dragon Palace, it was incredible. He was the most exceptional one among all the exceptional geniuses.After all, previously, there had only been one person that made it through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. And he was known as the number one genius in Dragon Palace, Bai Cheng!\u201cYang Zaixuan is amazing,\u201d Ye Rufeng said, then sighed with emotion.Having sighed for a while, the black and white Palace Masters looked at Ye Rufeng and Jian Wushuang.\u201cYe Rufeng, you can let this little guy you brought go through the Dragon Gate now,\u201d Palace Master White said, completely ignoring Jian Wushuang.The Palace Masters had a high status, so the geniuses who had gone through the Dragon Gate were only worth a glance to them.Only a peerless genius like Yang Zaixuan could excite the two Palace Masters and receive their enthusiastic treatment.\u201cLittle guy, you should go. Remember, you should try your best to go to the highest level you can reach,\u201d said Ye Rufeng.\u201cOkay,\u201d said Jian Wushuang, then he nodded and went straight towards the Golden Pavilion without paying attention to the gazes of the people around him. He quickly entered the Golden Pavilion.The first level of the Dragon Gate.A red-haired man was sitting cross-legged on the empty ground. When Jian Wushuang walked inside, the man suddenly glared at Jian Wushuang and said, \u201cLittle guy, if you beat me, you can go to the next level.\u201d\u201cCome on!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, the red-haired man began to brandish his large axe, which was surrounded by a blast of invisible airflow. In an instant, the large axe slashed toward his opponent.Jian Wushuang immediately swung his Triple-kill Sword to block the blow. Then he directly took the chance to strike back, scratching the garment of the red-haired man. Obviously, the red-haired man was defeated.He made it through the first level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, it was easy to defeat him.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought privately, then he entered the second floor.The opponent he faced on the second floor had comprehended a trace of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. It was the Gale Essence, but only the initial stage, so Jian Wushuang still defeated him easily.On the third floor, Jian Wushuang faced a much stronger opponent. After all, one must pass through the third level, at the least, to enter Dragon Palace. Naturally, it was more difficult.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dAn ice-cold sword light flashed before disappearing in an instant.In the end, Jian Wushuang defeated him with the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship.on the fourth floor, Jian Wushuang\u2019s opponent was a black-clothed elder, who held a Purple Soft-Sword in his hand.CHUU!Another ice-cold sword light flashed. Once again, it was the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.\u201cFormless Swordsmanship?\u201d The black-clothed elder smiled slightly and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence, I can use the Sword Essence of Gale too.\u201dThe same ice-cold dazzling sword light appeared in the black-clothed elder\u2019s hand.They were brandishing two of the same sword shadows with the same sword essence. Not only that, both of them released nearly the same spiritual power because the opponent was from the Dragon Gate.Clang!The two sword edges met.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang was astonished and downcast. He could clearly tell that the swordsmanship used by the grey-clothed elder was faster than his, even if it was only by a little.\u201cHis comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale is higher than mine.\u201d Jian Wushuang realized immediately.\u201cSword-killing Movement,\u201d Jian Wushuang followed with the second move of Anonymous Swordsmanship.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s useless. In the Dragon Gate, the real test is in your comprehension of Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. Martial arts technique and swordsmanship don\u2019t make a big difference here. Besides, I can use Sword-killing Movement too.\u201d The killing intent from the purple soft-sword in the black-clothed elder\u2019s hand exploded, attacking with a sword light which was equal to the one Jian Wushuang released.Once again, two equal sword lights met, and the black-clothed elder suppressed him again.\u201cLittle Boy, give it up. You are too weak in the Sword Principle of Gale to pass the fourth level,\u201d the black-clothed elder said with a smile.\u201cReally?\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression became serious, then he said, \u201cWhat about this move?\u201dAfter saying that, a heavy sword essence was released. Jian Wushuang swung his long sword with great momentum.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Earth Sword Essence?\u201d The black-clothed elder\u2019s expression changed.It\u2019s not easy to comprehend the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. Comprehending one was difficult, to comprehend two at the same time was much more difficult. Yang Zaixuan, who passed through the eighth level just now, was a super genius that comprehended two at the same time.The black-clothed elder didn\u2019t expect that the little guy standing in front of him, who was under 20 years old, not only had a high level of comprehension in the Sword Essence of Gale, but also comprehended Earth Sword Essence at the same time.Hum~~~A sword shadow with great momentum rushed straight towards him, as if it could chop up a mountain.After perceiving the great amount of power contained in the sword shadow, the black-clothed elder\u2019s countenance changed a little. He didn\u2019t fight back recklessly, quickly choosing to dodge it instead. However, before the elder could use his sword to attack, Jian Wushuang changed his sword essence again.He used the Sword Essence of Gale along with the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.\u201cHe can shift between the Sword Essences of Gale and Earth so easily?\u201d The black-clothed elder was surprised and smiled bitterly.The Sword Essences of Earth and Gale. One was massive and majestic with power and influence, while the other was flexible and visionary. If he could perfectly transition between them, these two sword essences would produce a terrible power which the grey-clothed elder could not oppose.The Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate, passed!As for the fifth level, the opponent Jian Wushuang faced also comprehended the Sword Essence of Earth. Not only that, he was stronger than Jian Wushuang in Sword Essence of Earth comprehension and used it more freely. Jian Wushuang tried his best, fighting with him for quite a while. But finally, he was defeated, causing him to stop\u00a0at the fifth level.When Jian Wushuang walked out of the Golden Pavilion, all the experts of Dragon Palace that were waiting outside looked at him.\u201cPassing through the Fourth Level is good enough, so he is qualified to enter Dragon Palace. However, there is a large gap in skill between him and Yang Zaixuan.\u201d\u201cAn extraordinary genius like Yang Zaixuan is rare. It is impossible to come by two in a single day.\u201dEveryone in the area was secretly discussing it.\u201cLittle guy, what\u2019s your name and how old are you?\u201d Palace Master White walked to him and asked directly.\u201cSwordsman,\u201d said Jian Wushuang, still chose to use this pseudonym, \u201c17 years old.\u201d\u201c17 years old?\u201dEveryone in the area was astonished, including both of the palace masters. then, Palace Master White smiled and said, \u201chaha, good. It seems that we have one more genius.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rare for a 17-year-old kid to pass through the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate. You could be ranked between middle and upper among the many disciples in Dragon Palace.\u201d Palace Master Black, who stayed silent, nodded in agreement.\u201cYe Rufeng, you brought a good disciple to Dragon Palace.\u201d Palace Master White looked over at Ye Rufeng.\u201cI just did my duty,\u201d said Ye Rufeng, remaining humble.\u201cYang Zaixuan, Swordsman, from now on, you are both disciples of Dragon Palace. Congratulations for becoming one of the many Monsters in Tianzong Dynasty,\u201d said Palace Master White with a laugh.Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan stood side by side. After hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and Yang Zaixuan was indifferent as always.\u201cCome with me. I will take you to visit Dragon Palace,\u201d said Palace Master White, intending to escort both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.Suddenly, the surroundings totally calmed down.A white-haired man wearing white, slowly walked into the people\u2019s sights.\u201cHis hair is as white as snow, the strongest genius, Bai Cheng!\u201d\u201cThe strongest disciple in Dragon Palace!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him. he actually appeared.\u201dAs he approached, all the disciples of Dragon Palace watched him with grim looks on their faces.\u201cIs he Bai Cheng?\u201d Jian Wushuang slightly squinted his eyes while hearing Bai Cheng\u2019s name mentioned in their discussion.\u201cThe strongest person in Dragon Palace?\u201d Yang Zaixuan raised his head and saw the white figure, with cold and prideful eyes, walking slowly in their direction.The white-haired man in white stopped. His black eyes, full of arrogance, swept over them as the sides of his mouth stretched upwards to form a meaningful smile.\u201cI heard that a newcomer passed through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate today, so I wanted to see for myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He passed through the fourth level.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Bai Cheng glanced at Jian Wushuang with a faint smile and said, \u201cThe fourth level. He would be ranked at the bottom among the many disciples of Dragon Palace. But he\u2019s young. If there are no accidents, it\u2019s possible for him to pass the seventh level before 20. He can reach the same level as Golden Dragon Ambassador Ye and would barely be an expert in the Tianzong Dynasty.\u201dHearing what he said, Ye Rufeng smiled faintly and ignored it. He did not dare to show any disdain.However, Jian Wushuang frowned and felt unpleasant.\u201cI might reach the level of Ye Rufeng?\u201d\u201cI might barely become an expert?\u201dEven I can\u2019t imagine what I might achieve in the future. What makes Bai Cheng think he can judge me with one glance in such a condescending manner, acting as if what he says will definitely come true in the future.How arrogant and conceited can he be?Even though he was unhappy, he didn\u2019t openly offend Bai Cheng.\u201cThis is Yang Zaixuan. He is the one who passed the eighth level and he is currently 21 years old,\u201d replied Palace Master White.Bai Cheng turned to face Yang Zaixuan and fixed his eyes on him before saying, \u201cTo pass through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate at 21 years old, you\u2019re promising. In Dragon Palace, I\u2019m afraid that there is no one but me who could suppress you.\u201d\u201cYou mean you are stronger than me right now?\u201d Yang Zaixuan\u2019s expression fell.Bai Cheng didn\u2019t answer him, he just smiled confidently.\u201cPalace Master White, no one is in the Dragon Gate, right?\u201d Bai Cheng asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Palace Master White nodded.\u201cOkay, I have not been tested in a long time. Today, let me give it a try.\u201d After saying that, he immediately entered the Dragon Gate.Both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan, who were supposed to leave, stopped and looked carefully at the Golden Pavilion to see what would happen.After entering the Dragon Gate, Bai Cheng quickly passed through the first level, causing it to light up. Then he continued moving forward smoothly.He passed eight levels in succession.Bai Chong entered the ninth level and stayed in it for a long time before the ninth level finally lit up, releasing a golden light.The ninth level of Dragon Gate, passed!\u201cHe actually passed the ninth level?\u201d Ye Rufeng was shocked and couldn\u2019t say anything. It should be known that even if it was him, he would not be able to pass it, even after trying his best. However, Bai Cheng succeeded.He really was the top genius in Dragon Palace!\u201cThis is the strongest person in Dragon Palace, so awesome!\u201d\u201cThough Yang Zaixuan is great, he is new and young. He can not compete with Bai Cheng yet.\u201d\u201cWe thought Yang Zaixuan would be strong enough to be Bai Cheng\u2019s opponent, but the truth is that he is far away from him for now.\u201dA large number of disciples of Dragon Palace in front of the Dragon Gate were discussing the recent events secretly.Not long after that, Bai Cheng walked out of the Golden Pavilion. Under the watchful eyes and shocked expressions, Bai Cheng walked over to Yang Zaixuan again and smiled slightly before saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to work harder, Freshman.\u201dAfter saying that, Bai Cheng left without looking back. Since Jian Wushuang only passed the fourth level, Bai Cheng did not even give him a second glance.\u201cHe is really arrogant!\u201d Jian Wushuang licked his lips, the battle intent vaguely rising in his eyes.\u201cYang Zaixuan, what do you think?\u201d Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.\u201cAbout what?\u201d Yang Zaixuan looked at him indifferently.\u201cI don\u2019t like him, don\u2019t you want to defeat him?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cCrush him under my feet? Hum, he won\u2019t be qualified to be my opponent within one year,\u201d replied Yang Zaixuan.Hearing that, the corners of Jian Wushuang\u2019s mouth quirked up.\u201cAll of you are so arrogant and conceited. Okay, you are peerless geniuses, so it\u2019s normal to be proud of yourselves. Besides, you really are strong.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought.Someone who just joined, passed the eighth level of the Dragon Gate, and the other one passed the ninth level.However, he could only pass the Fourth Level after trying his best. So there was a huge gap between him and those two peerless geniuses.The wider the gap was, the more it inspired him.There was a gap now, so what?It should be known that he had only started comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth four months ago!It\u2019s unbelievable to comprehend both of the Sword Essences of Gale and Earth to such a high level within four months. No matter whether it was Bai Cheng or Yang Zaixuan, they were both older than him and they had spent much more time comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth as well.\u201cBai Cheng asserted that I could only be a Golden Dragon Messenger like Ye Rufeng in the future. Hum, let\u2019s see.\u201d Jian Wushuang snorted.\u201cAll right, go back to your places. Yang Zaixuan, Swordsman, you both follow me,\u201d Palace Master White said.Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan followed Palace Master White. Ye Rufeng and the Golden Dragon Messenger who brought Yang Zaixuan here followed Palace Master Black to receive their rewards.These Golden Dragon Messengers had the right to recommend disciples. Every recommendation that passed the test and became a disciple of Dragon Palace would earn the Golden Dragon Messenger a reward based on the strength of the disciple.In the Dragon Palace.Both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were curiously examining their surroundings while Palace Master White was telling them the basic information and rules of Dragon Palace.\u201cDragon Palace is a Cultivation Sanctuary. You both became disciples of Dragon Palace means that you are talented. In Dragon Palace, there are 238 disciples, not counting both of you.\u201d\u201cAmong the 238 disciples, only one had passed the eighth level of the Dragon Gate, and that was Bai Cheng. But now he has passed the ninth level.\u201d\u201c16 disciples passed the seventh level.\u201d\u201c67 passed the sixth level.\u201d\u201c141 disciples passed the fifth level.\u201d\u201cThe 13 disciples left passed the fourth level.\u201dAfter saying this, Palace Master White could not help glancing at Jian Wushuang.Jian Wushuang also could not help touching his nose with an embraced expression.\u201cThere are 238 disciples in total and only 13 of them were at the fourth level. Most disciples were all at the fifth level or higher. It seems that Bai Cheng was right, I am at the lowest level in Dragon Palace right now.\u201dHowever, Jian Wushuang didn\u2019t worry about being at the bottom.It didn\u2019t mean that he would be at the bottom forever.\u201cSo many geniuses are in Dragon Palace. However, the more geniuses the better for me.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were sparkling with excitement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They are of great help to the disciples of Dragon Palace. As for the benefits of the three treasures, you will gradually understand them in the future.\u201d\u201cIn addition, there are also two places for practicing. The Dragon Gate and Heavenly Palace .\u201d\u201cThe Dragon Gate, which you have just tried, is the best place to test the progress of the Dragon Palace disciples. It can accurately gauge the disciples\u2019 perception to the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.\u201d\u201cAs for the Heavenly Palace, that is used to test overall strength.\u201d\u201cUsually, no one will go to the Heavenly Palace. Only disciples who have enough strength to leave Dragon Palace will go to the Heavenly Palace.\u201dPalace Master White simply explained a few basic conditions of Dragon Palace again. Not long after that, she arrived at the manor with Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.\u201cEach disciple of Dragon Palace will have a single house. Your rooms are also in this manor,\u201d Palace Master White informed them.Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan quickly noticed that the manor contained four independent houses, even though the area was not big.\u201cFatty Wang.\u201d Palace Master White\u2019s voice echoed throughout the area.\u201cOh, I\u2019m coming,\u201d A rough voice echoed back. After which, a big fat man in a blouse hurried out of one room and a timid figure hurried out of another room.Jian Wushuang looked at the two incoming people.That big fat man was not tall, but he was extremely large, weighing nearly three hundred jins. That big face, larger than an ordinary person, was covered with a smile. But the smile seemed very quirky no matter what angle you looked from.As for the other person, she was a tall and thin girl with long blue hair. A young girl who appeared to be only 14 or 15 years old. She followed the big fat man, looking down in a very shy manner. It seemed like she was afraid to make eye contact with Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.Palace Master White glanced at the big fat man and told him, \u201cFrom now on, they will live in the manor with you. You can take them and familiarize them with environment of Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d The big fat man nodded and promised.\u201cThese are your disciple tokens, which contain your points. In Dragon Palace, points are very important. Many of the resources in Dragon Palace can only be redeemed using points,\u201d said Palace Master White.Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan took the tokens and examined the numbers.\u201c2,000 points?\u201d Jian Wushuang felt excited, then he looked at Yang Zaixuan\u2019s token. He had a full 6,000 points.\u201cI only have 2,000 points, but he has 6,000 points, three times mine. Is it possible that\u00a0the points depend on how many levels you pass through in the Dragon Gate?\u201d Jian Wushuang secretly pondered.In his opinion, that was the only possibility given the situation.\u201cAlright little guys, make sure to work hard! Many years from now, I hope to see another two excellent disciples emerge from my Dragon Palace,\u201d said Palace Master White, who smiled and then immediately departed.After Palace Master White walked away, the big fat man immediately looked over and introduced himself, \u201cMy name is Wang Yuan, and the girl next to me is Su Rou.\u201d\u201cSwordsman,\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cYang Zaixua,\u201d Yang Zaixuan also introduced himself.\u201cSwordsman, Yang Zaixuan, your arrival made the manor considerably full.\u00a0Come, for the first meeting, the four of us need to have a quick drink,\u201d replied Wang Yuan with a smile.\u00a0Then, he turned up his hand and a wine pot appeared. After the stopper was opened, the aroma of the wine soon spreaded out.Smelling the aroma, Jian Wushuang smiled. While on the other side, Yang Zaixuan\u2019s indifferent expression also slightly relaxed a bit.After which, the four of them drank in front of the stone table in this manor.After drinking a few glasses of wine in succession, the atmosphere is was no longer so boring.At this time, Wang Yuan said: \u201cSwordsman, Yang Zaixuan, we will not live in the manor together for more than several years. It\u2019s too polite to call each other by name. What if we call each other as brothers and sisters according to age? I\u2019m the oldest, so I\u2019m the elder brother.\u201d\u201cYang Zaixuan, your age is only a little younger than mine, so you are the second brother.\u201d\u201cSwordsman, you, the third brother.\u201d\u201cAs for Su Rou, she\u2019s our fourth sister.\u201d\u201cAll right?\u201d Wang Yuan smiled and looked around.\u201cOK.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded his head.After all, they will live in the same manor in the future, the relationship among them should be better.And after drinking, the three of them all left a good impression on him.Wang Yuan, he was a generous and careless person without any scheming. This kind of person is the most worthwhile to make friends with, except his talkativeness.Yang Zaixuan, as indifferent as he is, did not put on airs. It\u2019s said that he is the one who broke into the eighth level of the Dragon Palace when he arrived. With such talent, he was still willing to sit down with them to have a few drinks. His eyes did not have the slightest bit of arrogance. For the point, making friends with him was very worthwhile.As for the last one, the little girl Su Rou, she\u2019s so timid and shy that she didn\u2019t dare to say one word while they were drinking. Jian Wushuang felt a little strange in the beginning, but later he heard from Fatty Wang that when Su Rou was a little girl, she had been sold to a mansion as a servant-girl. To be a servant-girl since childhood, it\u2019s normal for her to be so timid.However, this timid little girl had a great reputation in Dragon Palace.As mentioned before, among the disciples of Dragon Palace, only Bai Cheng had passed through the eighth floor. There were 16 disciples that had passed through the 7th level and Su Rou was one of them.And most importantly, this year,\u00a0Su Rou was only 14 years old!The 14-year-old Su Rou broke through the Seventh Level of the Dragon Gate. What does that mean?So, after Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan learned of her achievement, they were both astonished.Similarly, Su Rou is also worth making friends with.Therefore, after hearing the proposal of Wang Yuan, Jian Wushuang immediately agreed.Yang Zaixuan, as always, was indifferent, giving neither refusal nor opposition.As for the timid girl Su Rou, she nodded her head shyly.\u201cHaha, since there is no objection, let us make this decision final. From now on, the four of us are siblings. We shall share happiness and hardship together!\u201d said Wang Yuan, then he smiled and lifted the cup for a toast.Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang and Su Rou immediately raised their glasses. As for Yang Zaixuan, he pondered for a while, then raised the glass too.Kuang!With the toasting finished, the famous Tianzong Dynasty and the Four Matchless Heroes of the heaven and the earth were born!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let me show you around. I\u2019ll take you to the treasure troves of Dragon Palace,\u201d Wang Yuan said.\u201cAll right.\u201d Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan nodded.Dragon Palace covered a large area and was famous for three treasure troves: Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind, Secret Land of Heaven and Earth, and Secret Pavilion. The first place Wang Yuan brought them to was Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind.\u201cLook, this is Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind.\u201d Wang Yuan pointed to the four pavilions which covered a wide area. Each pavilion had a gilded character engraved on the lintel, Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind respectively.\u201cThe Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind are where the Disciples of Dragon Palace visit the most. Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind represent the four kinds of Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, which are, Earth Essence Realm, Raging Fire Realm, Waterdrop Essence Realm, and Gale Essence Realm.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019re six Temple Masters in each temple. They\u2019re the top experts in the world and have reached the highest level of comprehending Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. The reason why Disciples of Dragon Palace often visit Four Temples is that the Temple Masters usually give lessons in the temples, displaying some Martial Arts Techniques and giving disciples some advice.\u201d\u201cIf you have any problem in comprehending Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, you can consult these Temple Masters. After receiving their guidance, you might be enlightened.\u201dOn hearing this, Jian Wushuang\u2019s and Yang Zaixuan\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cIf I have any problem in comprehending Essence Realm, I can consult these Temple Masters? What\u2019s more, there are six Temple Masters dealing with each Essence Realm?\u201d\u201cThe six Temple Masters in each temple should be good at different aspects?\u201dIt would be superior to following a top expert.Although a top expert would try his best to teach someone, he was alone and studied only one aspect. If he encountered unfamiliar fields, he would not know how to instruct them.In Dragon Palace, Four Temples covered four kinds of Essence Realms of Heaven and Earth. Each temple had six powerful Temple Masters, who studied various fields. Therefore, the disciples did not worry that they would encounter an unsolvable problem.\u201cNow we come to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.\u201dWang Yuan led the way. Then they stood in front of a majestic palace, two Golden-armored Sergeants kept guard at the palace entrance.Wang Yuan said, \u201cSecret Land of Heaven and Earth is special and helpful at comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, if you want to enter Secret Land of Heaven and Earth, you need to pay 1,000 points to access the palace, and you can only stay inside for two hours each time.\u201d\u201cThough it is only two hours, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll benefit greatly from each visit. Moreover, you\u2019re newcomers in Dragon Palace, so each of you can enter the palace for free three times.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Jian Wushuang said, raising his eyebrows.He had just been surprised at the Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind. The Secret Land of Heaven and Earth was as famous as the Four Temples. Jian Wushuang was somewhat curious about it, as the palace, with the harsh requirements to access it, must be extraordinary.\u201cHow about it? Do you want to have a try?\u201d Wang Yuan smiled mysteriously.\u201cSure.\u201d Jian Wushuang gave a little smile and then glanced at Yang Zaixuan. \u201cSecond elder brother, you go first.\u201dYang Zaixuan nodded and directly walked toward the palace. The two Golden-armored Sergeant stepped forwards, but immediately allowed Yang Zaixuan to enter Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.Two hours later, Yang Zaixuan came out of it with a blank look.\u201cSecond elder brother?\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t disturb him. He\u2019s in the state of comprehension.\u201d Wang Yuan was not surprised at all and spoke to Jian Wushuang. \u201cThird younger brother, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dJian Wushuang nodded slightly, and then he stepped towards the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.The two Golden-armored Sergeants walked forward again, and let Jian Wushuang enter after realizing that he was a newcomer.\u201cWhat on earth is stored in the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth?\u201dJian Wushuang stepped into the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth with a flicker of curiosity.As soon as he entered, Jian Wushuang immediately felt himself surrounded by darkness. There was only a glimmer of light ahead in the endless darkness.Jian Wushuang could not help but look at the light.He was totally absorbed in it. The glimmer of light suddenly changed into a sword, which contained Sword Essence of Gale, Earth Sword Essence, Sword Essence of Raging Fire, and Sword Essence of the Waterdrop. He knew the four kinds of sword essence were unfathomable, although he had not comprehended the last two.Jian Wushuang drew out Triple-kill Sword behind him, the sword light starting to move\u2026One after another, the ethereal sword light moved flexibly.Jian Wushuang then started to perform the Anonymous Swordsmanship.He easily showed the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.He did not encounter any problem either in performing the Second Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Sword-killing Movement.The Third Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, named Expeditious Maneuver, was a terrifying Killing Move, emphasizing absolute speed.Jian Wushuang had not comprehended this move. He thought it was because his speed at unleashing the sword was not fast enough. In fact, it was related to his inferior comprehension of Sword Essence of Gale.However, Jian Wushuang could not help wielding his Long Sword and slowly performed this move in this special situation.Hoo!The sword light flashed and then disappeared with the wind.He naturally performed the Third Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Expeditious Maneuver.Nevertheless, it was not over.As Jian Wushuang continued to wield Long Sword, the sword light became grander and more massive.Every beam of the sword light contained Sword Essence of Earth.One strike after another\u2026Suddenly, the glimmer of light disappeared. Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised and blankly stared into space.\u201d Two hours, I\u2019ve run out of time? \u201d Jian Wushuang looked into the darkness, sighing. Then he turned to leave.Jian Wushuang walked out of Secret Land of Heaven and Earth and saw his three sworn brothers waiting outside, but he ignored them and directly sat on the ground, with eyes closed.Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou were not angry at Jian Wushuang. They knew Jian Wushuang\u2019s state and did not want to disturb him. After a while, Jian Wushuang finally breathed a sigh of relief and immediately stood up.\u201cHow about it?\u201d Wang Yuan asked with a smile.\u201cGood, very good.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. \u201cThe benefits from practicing in Secret Land of Heaven and Earth for two hours can be comparable to that from earnest cultivation in a month.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I made great progress, too,\u201d Yang Zaixuan said seriously.\u201cHaha! This is one of the three treasures of the Dragon Palace. The cost of entering it so high, naturally there\u2019s a high return too. You can enter the place three times. Since you\u2019ve entered once, you must treasure your two remaining chances,\u201d Wang Yuan said, smiling.\u201cCome with me. I\u2019ll show you the last treasure of the Dragon Palace.\u201dThey followed Wang Yuan to the entrance of a heavily guarded tall attic that exuded a faintly ancient scent.\u201cThis attic is the most important of the Three Treasures of Dragon Palace, the Secret Pavilion.\u201d\u201cThere are countless treasures in the Secret Pavilion, but you can only take them in exchange for points. Go in and have a look,\u201d Tianbao said.Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan immediately entered the Secret Pavilion.Inside the large and spacious Secret Pavilion, the treasures were divided into many categories.There were Cultivation Methods, Martial Arts Techniques, Elixir Pills, and Exotic Classes\u2026With a Heavenly Creation Skill that defied the natural order, Jian Wushuang had no need for Cultivation Methods. Neither did he need Elixirs and Exotic Classes for now, so he made a beeline for the Martial Arts Techniques section.The Martial Arts Techniques section was divided into swordsmanship, knife methods, spear methods, and so on. Jian Wushuang left Yang Zaixuan\u2019s side and headed straight for the swordsmanship section.The section stored nearly thousands of rare books on swordsmanship. Fortunately for Jian Wushuang, there was a list that he could refer to. Otherwise, he might need to flip through each book to find the one on his swordsmanship.The list detailed a number of swordsmanship, a basic introduction for each swordsmanship, as well as the points needed for exchange. But just from a quick glance, Jian Wushuang realized the lowest-ranked swordsmanship on this list was already top-notch ones. There was also no shortage of Sword Skills.Sword Skills were beyond the scope of so-called swordsmanship.Generally, one needed to use Sword Skills with a display of Sword Essence understanding at the same time.\u201cFormless Swordsmanship\u2026\u201d The first item he looked for was the Formless Swordsmanship.He found out from Ye Rufeng that the Formless Swordsmanship was none other than the Anonymous Swordsmanship. The Formless Swordsmanship had nine sword movements and what he had been cultivating was merely the simplest first three of the swordsmanship.\u201cFound it!\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes brightened when he found the Formless Swordsmanship on the list.\u201cFormless Swordsmanship, the Sword Skill acknowledged by the Tianzong Dynasty as world\u2019s number one. It was suitable for warriors who understood the Sword Essence of Gale. There were nine movements, and each was stronger than the one before it.\u201d\u201cExchange for the first three movements with 200 points!\u201d\u201cExchange for the middle three movements with 2,000 points!\u201d\u201cThe last three movements are unavailable!\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s true they only have the middle three movements, not the last three.\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head.He had heard this from Ye Rufeng on their way here. Though there were nine sword strokes of the Formless Swordsmanship, the most powerful latter three were long lost to history. The Dragon Palace might be the Cultivation Sanctuary of the Tianzong Dynasty, but not even they could recover sword movements in a swordsmanship that had been lost.\u201cI\u2019ll need to spend 2,000 points alone just for the middle three movements.\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned secretly for his current score was precisely that number.\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. Let\u2019s look at other Sword Skills.\u201dJian Wushuang was not anxious to make his decision yet. He started reading the category of swordsmanship for Sword Essence of Earth understanding.His comprehension of Sword Essence of Earth was, in fact, far higher than Sword Essence of Gale. It was a pity that he did not have any suitable Sword Skill to display it all this while.Even in the Mansion of Sword Marquis, the First-class Swordsmanship he learned leaned toward the Earth Essence. But that was not even a First-class Swordsmanship, let alone a super First-class Swordsmanship. It was too weak that he could not even show the might of his Sword Essence of Earth to its fullest.Therefore, his immediate priority was finding a suitable Sword Skill in the Sword Essence of Earth.There were many Sword Skills on the list that was suitable for his goals. He finally selected three after carefully pondering over each one.They were Mark of Earth, Immemorial Sword Skill, and Formless Sword Wave.Mark of Earth required 2,500 points, while Immemorial Sword Skill required 3,000 points. Formless Sword Wave was divided into two sections, with each being 2,500 points.\u201cThough each of these Sword Tactics has its own advantages, I think the Formless Sword Ripple seems superior. It also suits me better, but the exchange rate is higher.\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned.The two sections would cost him 5,000 points. At the moment, he only had 2000 points.\u201cWhatever. Since I don\u2019t have enough points for the other two Sword Skills now, I\u2019ll just not exchange for now. I\u2019ll just wait and find a way to get more points. It wouldn\u2019t be too late by then.\u201dHe then left the Swordsmanship section and began taking a stroll through the Elixir Pills and Exotic Classes section.There were all kinds of odd treasures and elixirs here, many of which were hard to find in the outside world. In the Secret Pavilion, one only needed points to get them.Before long, Jian Wushuang left the Secret Pavilion with Yang Zaixuan. But before he left, Yang Zaixuan spent 4,000 points to exchange for a Martial Arts Technique.Jian Wushuang could only shrug his shoulders helplessly. There was nothing he could about it. Yang Zaixuan had more points than him after all.When he came out of the Sword Pavilion, Wang Yuan came up to him. \u201cWhat do you think about the treasures in the Secret Pavilion?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019re many of them,\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cI\u2019ve once visited the storehouse of a great power, but it\u2019s nothing compared to this place,\u201d Yang Zaixuan added.\u201cHaha! Of course. This is the Secret Pavilion of the Dragon Palace. How can those so-called sects of the Tianzong Dynasty compare to? As the disciples of this place, we can redeem the treasures if we have enough points.\u201d Wang Yuan smiled.\u201cBoss Wang Yuan, how can we get these points?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cThere are many ways! I\u2019ll tell you one by one,\u201d Wang Yuan replied, immediately describing each method.\u201cFirst method: go through the Dragon Gate Pass!\u201d\u201cThere are 13 stories in the Dragon Gate. Starting at the third level, you can get 1,000 points for passing through each level. After the ninth floor, you get 2,000 points each.\u201d\u201cI heard you mention that one of you passed the eighth floor and the other the fourth. Old Two, you earned 5,000 points. Old Three, you earned 1,000 points. But every newcomer also get 1,000 points for free, so you have 6,000 and 2,000 points respectively.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some of them are difficult, some are relatively simple. You will obtain points according to the complexity of the task.\u201cThe third way is to battle for points.\u201dOn hearing this, both Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were puzzled.They could easily understand the first two ways, but could not figure out what the battle for points was.\u201cThe battle for points is actually dueling.\u201d Wang Yuan spoke with a smile. \u201cThere\u2019re more than 200 disciples of Dragon Palace with varying strength. As exceptional geniuses, they can be somewhat arrogant. As a result, they often fight with each other in Dragon Palace. Since there are fights, there are duels and bets. As for the bets, it\u2019s up to the two duelers.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan immediately understood.\u201cSpeaking of the battles for points, Third Younger Brother, you should be careful.\u201d Wang Yuan suddenly spoke.\u201cWhy?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at him in surprise.Wang Yuan said, \u201cI just mentioned there are three ways to get points. First, going through the Dragon Gate. Many disciples will wait a long time to challenge, and they may not be successful. What\u2019s more, they can only gain a few points there.\u201cSecond, complete tasks for experience. But, only difficult tasks offer a lot of points. Disciples of Dragon Palace will face death trials while performing these tasks, so it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201cOnly the third way, battle for points, is simple. You only need to challenge someone weaker than you and settle the bets. Disciples who have stayed in Dragon Palace for a period of time, know the other disciples very well, so they won\u2019t easily accept challenges. However, you and Second Younger Brother are different because you\u2019re newcomers.\u201dJian Wushuang understood.\u201cYou mean the other disciples of Dragon Palace will want to challenge me?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cRight.\u201d Wang Yuan nodded. \u201cThey are inclined to bully those weaker than them. You have just entered Dragon Palace, so they will treat you as a weakling. They will try their best to challenge you to a duel before you have time to use treasures of Dragon Palace to improve your strength.\u201cOf course, Second Younger Brother is also a newcomer, but he made it through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. He\u2019s so powerful that no one will dare to challenge him.\u201dJian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.\u201cWe\u2019ll reach the Martial Arts Practice Field soon, where many disciples of Dragon Palace gather. Battle for points is usually held there. Third Younger Brother, you must remember my words. If someone challenges you, you can refuse directly or just ignore them. They cannot do anything to you.\u201d Wang Yuan reminded Jian Wushuang.\u201cRefuse, why should I refuse?\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a smile.\u201cDon\u2019t be rash, Third Younger Brother. It is not easy for you to earn points. Do not lose them by acting on impulse.\u201d Wang Yuan continued to persuade him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know what to do,\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a smile.The four of them had finally arrived at the huge Martial Arts Practice Field.The Martial Arts Practice Field covered an extremely large area. There were quite a few disciples of Dragon Palace around the center of it. At the moment, all of them looked at the four people who just stepped inside.\u201cHa, newcomers!\u201d\u201cI hear there are two new disciples. Those two must be the newcomers.\u201d\u201cThe man with a cold expression is called Yang Zaixuan. It\u2019s inconceivable that he has already gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. He must be a monster on the same level as Bai Cheng.\u201d\u201cYang Zaixuan, an exceptional genius. We\u2019re not comparable to him. The other person was called Swordsman. I hear he only made it through the fourth level?\u201d\u201cThe fourth level means that his strength is at the bottom of Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cGoing through the fourth level is worth 1000 points. And since he\u2019s a newcomer, he also received 1000 points for free. In other words, he has 2000 points now.\u201dYang Zaixuan should have attracted more attention, because of his brilliant results. Nevertheless, none of the disciples of Dragon Palace looked at him. All eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.Their eyes were full of expectation.\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m popular.\u201d Jian Wushuang noticed that their eyes sparkled with eagerness, the corner of his mouth lifted up.\u201cHaha, you are Swordsman, right?\u201d A laughter could be heard along with the question. Then a red-haired young man with a saber on his back appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. The aura of Spiritual Power in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm spread out. He said, with an expectant look, \u201cI\u2019m Zhang Tao. I hear you have gone through the fourth level of the Dragon Gate. So have I. Do you have the guts to have a fair fight with me?\u201dLooking at Zhang Tao, Jian Wushuang was delighted in his heart.The other disciples of Dragon Palace were furious.\u201cDamn it. He got there first.\u201d\u201cZhang Tao is really fast.\u201d\u201cI hope the newcomer does not accept his challenge.\u201d\u201cZhang Tao.\u201d Wang Yuan frowned and shouted in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year since you went through the fourth level. Now your strength has improved greatly to the point that you can challenge the fifth level. Aren\u2019t you embarrassed to talk about having a fair fight with my brother?\u201d\u201cThird Younger Brother, leave him alone,\u201d said Wang Yuan, winking at Jian Wushuang.\u201cWhat? Are you afraid of fighting with me? If you became a disciple of Dragon Palace, you must be a genius. Don\u2019t you have the guts?\u201d Zhang Tao spoke directly, then laughed out.\u201cZhang Tao, right?\u201d Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared at Zhang Tao with a faint smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to provoke me. I accept your challenge. Tell me how many points you want to bet.\u201d\u201cCool.\u201d Zhang Tao was glad that Jian Wushuang accepted his challenge. \u201cI know you should have 2000 points. I will not bet for all of them, just 1500 points. That will leave you with 500 points to choose a manual from the General Hall in Secret Pavilion. What do you think?\u201d\u201c1500 points? Zhang Tao, you have a huge appetite.\u201d Wang Yuan spoke angrily.\u201cIt\u2019s true. He has a total of 2000 points. Only, you want 1500 points. Isn\u2019t that too much?\u201d A disciple of Dragon Palace spoke up from the side. He also coveted Jian Wushuang\u2019s 2000 points.\u201c1500 points. It\u2019s too much indeed. Well, I can bet 1000 points,\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cOK, 1000 points.\u201d Zhang Tao agreed without hesitation, secretly delighted.Zhang Tao thought that Jian Wushuang was not his match. Jian Wushuang had just become a disciple of Dragon Palace and had only made it through the fourth level of the Dragon Gate.Zhang Tao went through the fourth level a year ago. Since then, his strength had improved greatly with the help of the resources from Dragon Palace. Therefore, he thought he would win this fight no matter what would happen.He was over the moon when thinking about the 1000 points.It was not a small amount for him, as it was hard to gain points in Dragon Palace.\u201cHaha, watch out.\u201d Zhang Tao spoke.He directly rushed forward. With a single stride, he appeared before Jian Wushuang and drew the saber on his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The movement was swift, but his sword was faster.SWISH!A dazzling glare of sword light fleeted. It was still the first blood shadow move of Formless Swordsmanship.A clashing sound could be heard when the two swords met. There was only a slight gap between these two powers.\u201cYou will be defeated,\u201d Zhang Tao said in a low voice.\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Jian Wushuang replied with a laugh.These two people began to display their power to its furthest extent.One used the knife, and the other the sword. Their splendid speed reached its peak.CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!Numerous clashing sounds could be heard. The blade lights and sword shadows were extremely rapid.Both Jian Wushuang and Zhang Tao sensed Sword Principle of Gale, and it was very powerful.Zhang Tao had achieved the Fourth Level a year ago. Although it was not certain that he would achieve the Fifth Level, he had been able to fight with the level keepers in the Fifth Level for a long time.Jian Wushuang did not have a deep comprehension of Gale Sword Principle, and he was not as powerful as Zhang Tao. But he had obtained a better understanding of Sword Principle of Gale during the two-hour cultivation in the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. Thus he was no weaker than Zhang Tao now.OM~~The sword light moved and disappeared with the wind.The third move of Formless Swordsmanship, Expeditious Maneuver.\u201cIt\u2019s Formless Swordsmanship, and it\u2019s the third move!\u201d\u201cIs this Expeditious Swordsmanship? Unbelievable!\u201dThe surrounding Dragon Palace Disciples were amazed.These Disciples were familiar with the first Sword Skill of Tianzong Dynasty, and several of them had cultivated the Formless Swordsmanship. All of them understood the high requirement of practicing this move.\u201cFormless Swordsmanship? So What?\u201dZhang Tao roared. The saber in his hand split straight down with a bloody light flickering. It burst out in the blink of an eye.The scarlet light of the saber hit the sword light. The sword essence changed suddenly as Jian Wushuang twisted his wrist.It started as the Sword Essence of Gale, and suddenly became the heavy Sword Essence of Earth.\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhang Tao looked pale.\u201cSword Essence of Earth!\u201d The Dragon Palace Disciples were shocked.It was very difficult to comprehend the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, and someone comprehending two types at the same time, not to mention both at a high level, was rarely seen. Very few disciples in Dragon Palace could comprehend two types of the Realm at the same time.The swordsmanship Jian Wushuang exhibited was obviously the Sword Essence of Earth.Sword Essence of Gale converted perfectly to Sword Essence of Earth\u2026Sword Edge swept Zhang Tao\u2019s sleeves, and rolled up his robe. Zhang was defeated in this battle!\u201cLose!\u201d\u201cHas\u2026has Zhang Tao lost?\u201dThe entire martial arts practice field went quiet. The Dragon Palace disciples were shocked, some held contempt for Zhang Tao.Wang Yuan was amazed too.No one had expected this. A newcomer like Jian Wushuang could beat Zhang Tao.Only Jian Wushuang, himself, thought this was very normal.\u201cRelying on the perfectly converted Sword Essence of Gale and Sword Essence of Earth, I have fought for a long time at the fifth level. When I went through the Dragon Gate Pass, I improved my cultivation of these two sword essences after just one hour of learning Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. Now I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll pass the fifth level. Zhang Tao, on the other hand, still has a way to go before reaching the fifth level. \u201c\u201cIt is natural that I should beat him, I even didn\u2019t do my best \u2026\u201dJian Wushuang laughed at heart.True, he had not done his best. If he had, it would not have taken so long to beat Zhang Tao.Of course, he had his reasons for not doing his best from the beginning.Zhang Tao had a gloomy look on his face. He was in agony. He had lost indeed, and with so many people watching. He could not change it. He transferred one thousand points to Jian Wushuang immediately.When he saw that his pledge number had reached three thousand, Jian Wushuang smiled and looked around.\u201cIs there anyone who wants to fight with me?\u201d he called out in a loud voice.\u201cMe.\u201d An ice-cold girl stepped forward.Although Jian Wushuang beating Zhang Tao was beyond the expectations of many people, it did not count for anything.After all, Zhang Tao had only broken through to the Fourth Level, and he was not the top among those who were at this level.\u201cA dual is still a thousand points.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cGood.\u201d The girl did not hesitate. She shot at him directly.SWISH!A fierce blade slashed straight out. The blade\u2019s extreme speed caused a glimmer of heat.\u201cHaha, come on.\u201d Jian Wushuang laughed loudly. He moved his sword in a counterattack stance.The girl had a high cultivation of Blade Essence of Raging Fire. She was close to the fifth level and even stronger than Zhang Tao. As she fought with Jian Wushuang, she soon discovered that Jian Wushuang not only had a strong ability using Sword Essence of Gale, but also the Sword Essence of Earth.Sometimes these two swordsmanships were very fast and smart, sometimes they were heavy as a mountain pressing overwhelmingly.Two great changes of the sword essence quickly suppressed her.The fight did not last long.This fight caused many disciples of Dragon Palace to sigh.\u201cIf her cultivation of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire were higher, she would not have been suppressed, and she would have had a better chance of winning.\u201d\u201cYeah, he was just a little stronger than her.\u201dJian Wushuang was just slightly stronger than the girl, everyone could see it. Hence, the third challenger was ready to challenge\u2026This challenger was much more powerful than the ice-cold girl. Everyone was expecting Jian Wushuang to be defeated in this fight. But the result was shocking.A narrow victory!The fight with the third challenger had lasted for nearly an hour, Jian Wushuang had finally obtained an extremely narrow victory.Three consecutive fights had all been won. Jian Wushuang\u2019s points went from two thousand to five thousand.The Dragon Palace disciples\u2019 expressions become a bit weird.They were not stupid. It was rather coincidental to win three fights in succession with such a trivial difference.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, he is just a newcomer.\u201dThose disciples of Dragon Palace knew that Jian Wushuang was only a newcomer who had passed the fourth level of Dragon Gate, therefore his strength should be very limited. However they were very suspicious of him after he won these three consecutive battles, beating his opponents.A burly man came out among the crowd looking extremely domineering, wielding a thick broadsword.\u201cLin Feng!\u201d\u201cLin Feng came out!\u201dDisciples of Dragon Palace all looked at this burly man.\u201cLin Feng, you have gone through the fifth level. Aren\u2019t you ashamed of challenging a newcomer?\u201d Wang Yuan fumed with a dark face.Although Jian Wushuang had defeated three challengers who were at the Fourth Level of the Dragon Gate, this burly man, Lin Feng, had passed the fifth level already.\u201cYou are a swordsman. You should also have the strength to break through the fifth level. Why can\u2019t I challenge him?\u201d Lin Feng replied indifferently and his eyes looked to Jian Wushuang.\u201cOf course you can.\u201dJian Wushuang smiled slightly, \u201cTo duel, it is still a thousand points.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Lin Feng nodded, \u201cBe careful.\u201dWhoosh!Lin Feng crossed ten meters instantly and appeared before Jian Wushuang. He swung his thick broadsword ferociously, a Waterdrop Essence erupted. All of a sudden Jian Wushuang felt like he had been plunged into a boundless sea, with crashing waves. He was a lonely boat in the sea, at risk of capsizing anytime.\u201cWaterdrop Essence?\u201d Jian Wushuang frowned, immediately berated in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019ll break it down.\u201dA strong sword light pierced out at an alarming rate, tearing down everything with its speed.Om ~ ~ the thick broadsword brought stacked waves, covering everything.The sword light pierced several ripples by Jian Wushuang. The power was weakened to the extreme, but the thick broadsword continued to deliver its full force.\u201cRetreat!\u201dJian Wushuang retreated without any delay, exerting the Sword Essence of Earth at the same time.The best skill of Sword Essence of Earth, thick and strong, was defense.Hua hua hua hua~~~Lin Feng\u2019s broadsword domain erupted completely. A series of shadows split endlessly, and it did not stop. Jian Wushuang felt lost as if he had plunged into a huge whirlpool. No matter how he struggled to resist, he could not get rid of it. He only relied on Sword Essence of Earth to resist.\u201cWaterdrop Essence, this is Waterdrop Essence?\u201d Jian Wushuang with a trace of horror.This was the first time he had fought with such a strong concentrated drip realm. He had a new appreciation towards this Waterdrop Essence.Water, The greatest power of water, despite it being seemingly weak and feeble, but it had the power to wear through boulders.\u201cAfter all, it is a lack of Sword Tactics of Sword Essence of Earth. Otherwise, I can fight with Lin Feng.\u201d Jian Wushuang sighed. His heart was yearning for Formless Sword Wave.\u201cThe swordsman is suppressed, he is finally suppressed!\u201d\u201cHe will be defeated!\u201d\u201cIt is normal. Lin Feng, after all, has passed the fifth level.\u201dThe Disciples of Dragon Palace around he saw the scene on the battlefield, and all of them sighed.But at this moment\u2026A sword shadow pierced out in a straight line, at incredible speed. It was the third type of Formless Swordsmanship\u2014\u2014Expeditious Maneuver.Logically, the third type of Formless Swordsmanship was not a threat to Lin Feng, but once this sword shadow appeared, boom!It was an extremely forceful sword, it\u2019s power unexpectedly soaring at this moment! Almost directly defeating Lin Feng\u2019s offensive. The sharp sword shadow was more than a stroke crossing his shoulder.\u201cWhat?\u201dStill in shock, Lin Feng\u2019s clothes at his shoulder had been cut away.Jian Wushuang had still won this fight.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cLost? How did he lose?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dEveryone around was confused. Lin Feng was so superior, completely suppressing Jian Wushuang. And he should have won immediately, but yet he had suddenly lost.Only Lin Feng, himself, barely knew the reasons for his loss.\u201cStrength, it\u2019s strength. His power surged suddenly on that sword so that the power of his swordsmanship also rose sharply, tearing through everything directly.\u201d Lin Feng thought inwardly.But he was curious that Jian Wushuang was at Spiritual Sea Realm, like him. Why was his power so much stronger than his?He did not know that compared to ordinary martial warrior, the biggest advantage of Jian Wushuang was not his sword essence, nor swordsmanship, but cultivation method!He practiced the Heavenly Creation Skill. He was an Inverse Cultivator who defied the natural order!Lin Feng\u2019s power was at the peak of ordinary Spiritual Sea Realm, and Jian Wushuang, at the peak of his spiritual outbreak, could compare to Gold Core!The spiritual power of Gold Core was far from Spiritual Sea Realm.In the Dragon Palace, although there were numerous disciples, most of them were just as the Spiritual Sea Realm. Only a handful of people could breakthrough to reach Gold Core. All men defeated by Jian Wushuang were just at the Spiritual Sea Realm, and he deliberately controlled his power to fight with them.However, Jian Wushuang had only broken out thirty percent power while facing Lin Feng!Although it had only been 30%, it was also stronger than the normal Spiritual Sea Realm peak. So he defeated Lin Feng with one sword strike.Lin Feng defeated. Jian Wushuang got one thousand points again.\u201cWho else wants to fight with me?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked around, but those disciples of the Dragon Palace were now hesitant.Before, everyone treated Jian Wushuang as a soft persimmon, and wanted to pinch and get points from him, but after these four showdowns, especially the fight with Lin Feng, they still did not know why Lin Feng failed in the end.They also realized that Jian Wushuang had hidden his real strength before, so now no one was willing to duel him.Watching this scene, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, but immediately laughed, \u201camong disciples of the Dragon Palace, there are innumerable geniuses, so many people. Why is it so difficult to find someone to duel with me? Or are you reluctant to fight with me as I am just a newcomer?\u201d\u201cWell, among you, as long as you went through the fifth level, you can challenge me. I will not reject anyone. As for the bets, all will be one thousand points.\u201d\u201cDo not reject anyone?\u201d Disciples of Dragon Palace around he turned to a dark face.\u201cThis swordsman, what a crazy guy!\u201d\u201cHe even dares to say that he would not reject anyone, clearly looking down on the disciples who broke through the fifth level.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll fight with you!\u201dMost of disciples of the Dragon Palace were infuriated by Jian Wushuang. A disciple who had broken through the fifth level came to fight with Jian Wushuang immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Many disciples who had broken through the fifth level itched to have a try, which was as he expected.Based on the comprehension of realm, these disciples were almost all at the level of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, while Jian Wushuang barely reached the fifth level, so many of the disciples who broke through the fifth floor are stronger than him. Nevertheless, his greatest strength was in his cultivation method which had superior overall power.Relying on his absolute strength, he won the fifth confrontation.Followed by the sixth and seventh challenges\u2026until the eleventh!Jian Wushuang won all 11 matches!Those disciples of Dragon Palace at the Martial Arts Practice Field were speechless in astonishment.It was nothing for Jian Wushuang to win one or two battles consecutively, but now he had won 11 battles successively. In addition to the first three disciples who were at the fourth level, the other eight disciples were all at the fifth level. However, they were all defeated by Jian Wushuang.\u201cIt is his power that makes this happen. His power is even stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s strange that he has so much power as he is only at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm.\u201d\u201cHe has completed 11 battles in a row, but his spiritual power has not diminished. Why? Did he not need to consume his spiritual power when confronting others?\u201dEveryone was astonished.They thought Jian Wushuang\u2019s strength and vast spiritual power were amazing.Needless to say, his strength was much stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. But it was also his vast spiritual power shocked others so much.Several battles among these 11 battles were bitter fights, so how much spiritual power would these successive battles consume?Usually warriors needed to stop and have a rest to recover their spiritual power after at most three battles, but what about Jian Wushuang?Keep fighting!After 11 battles without any pause, Jian Wushuang won all of them without any reduction in spiritual power. How could this happen?And he was actually still at his peak level.What kind of monster is he?All those watching thought that this was incredible.\u201cWho else wants to battle me for points?\u201d Jian Wushuang said confidently and looked around.The disciples of Dragon Palace looked at each other in speechless despair and nobody stood out.Winning 11 battles in a row, Jian Wushuang proved to all that he was strong enough, and those people who wanted to challenge him would surely lose face and worse, one thousand points.For them, a thousand points was a big deal.\u201cNo one else?\u201d Seeing everyone\u2019s hesitation, Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction. However, as he was about to turn around and leave, an ethereal voice was suddenly heard.\u201cIt\u2019s very crowded here, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe soft voice was followed by the arrival of a handsome man dressed in a luxurious robe who slowly appeared.\u201cNangong Jie!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he isolating himself? Why is he here?\u201d\u201cHaha, it must be the commotion.\u201dA burst of noise swirled all around, which made it clear that these disciples of Dragon Palace knew this handsome man.Jian Wushuang also looked at the man and found his appearance was almost perfect with slender physique, handsome face and a free and ethereal temperament.\u201cSoon after I finished my self-isolation,\u00a0I heard that there was a newcomer in Dragon Palace and he said that anyone who had broken through the fifth level can challenge him. What arrogance!\u201d Nan Gong Jie smiled lightly, but his eyes were instantly locked on Jian Wushuang.\u201cNangong Jie, my brother has said this, but these words are only for the disciples of Dragon Palace at the level of Spiritual Sea. So you, who has broken through six months ago, shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d Wang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but shout.Most disciples of the Dragon Palace were at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm, but a small part of them were at the level of Gold Core, and Nangong Jie was one of them.\u201cOh, I do not know that your brother has made a distinction between Spiritual Sea Realm and Gold Core. I am also the disciple of Dragon Palace who has broken through the fifth level,\u00a0so it\u2019s ok for me to join this battle.\u201d\u201cMoreover, your brother just has a normal perception of the Realm of Heaven and Earth, but he successively defeated so many disciples of Dragon Palace who are at the fifth level. It is precisely that his strength is much stronger than the others.\u201d\u201cI think his strength will not be weaker than a disciple at the level of Primordial Gold Core if he goes all out. So it\u2019s quite fair for me to challenge him.\u201d Nangong Jie said.\u201cExactly! this swordsman defeated so many disciples because that his strength is stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. Now Nangong Jie\u2019s strength is also stronger than Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm, these two should have a battle.\u201d Immediately some disciples kicked up a fuss.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Yuan wanted to refute them.\u201cWang Yuan, stop!\u201d Jian Wushuang waved one of his hands to interrupt him and continued, \u201cSince I said that, I won\u2019t break my promise.\u201d\u201cNangong Jie, it\u2019s ok to gamble with you, but the stakes are still only a thousand points.\u201d\u201cOne thousand points?\u201d Nangong Jie raised his eyebow and said, \u201cno problem.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll start.\u201d Nangong Jie smiled thinly, and his figure begun to slowly dissipate at this moment.Whoosh!A sword light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang suddenly.\u201cSo fast.\u201dJian Wushuang was greatly frightened. He knew Sword Principle of Gale, and was also good at speed, but the speed of Nangong Jie was so fast that he even did not know when his sword was drawn.The Sword Essence of Earth was so strong that Jian Wushuang did not hesitate to defend with it.Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!Nangong Jie slashed his sword ten times consecutively with increasing speed and power.Jian Wushuang went for broke to going all out with Sword Essence of Earth to defend against Nangong Jie. However, he felt that he could not sustain this because the sword shadow was like thousands of poisonous snakes.Suddenly\u2026pop!Nangong Jie\u2019s Sword Edge crossed Jian Wushuang\u2019s right hand wrist with a very clear sword scar. The pain in Jian Wushuang\u2019s wrist made him loosen his grip of the Triple-kill Sword.\u201cBro junior, are you okay?\u201d Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou immediately rushed over.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head and picked up Triple-kill Sword again.\u201cNangong Jie, the battle is just for learning from each other. You shouldn\u2019t hurt him so much.\u201d Wang Yuan shouted in a low voice.\u201cOh, sorry, it\u2019s just an accident.\u201dNangong Jie replied immediately. But his joking smile made it clear to everyone that he did it on purpose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One thousand points, here you are.\u201d Jian Wushuang gave Nangong Jie one thousand points directly without hesitation.After getting the one thousand points, Nangong Jie didn\u2019t change his facial expression but touched his nose and said suddenly: \u201cSwordsman, do you want to fight with me one more time?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d Jian Wushuang was so surprised.\u201cNangong Jie, don\u2019t go that far!\u201d Wang Yuan immediately shouted.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Nangong Jie shook his head and said, \u201cI intend to continue the battle for points, but this time the condition will be changed. For example, you will win as long as you withstand my swords for three times. What do you think about it?\u201d\u201cI can win after three swords?\u201d Wang Yuan immediately looked at Jian Wushuang in confusion.Disciples of the Dragon Palace around him all looked over and discussed this heatedly.\u201cWhat does Nangong Jie intend to do? Jiang Wushuang will be the winner after fighting with him for three moves?\u201d\u201cIn the past battle, Swordsman used nearly 20 moves before he won.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Nangong Jie? Does he want to give his points to others for nothing?\u201dThese disciples of Dragon Palace were confused over Nangong Jie\u2019s behavior, because in the past battle, Jian Wushuang endured nearly 20 moves before he won.Now he wanted to defeat Jian Wushuang with less than three moves. What a joke!\u201cIf I agree with the battle, how many points will you bet?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at Nangong Jie calmly.\u201cOne thousand points is too few. I believe you have many points now because you have won so many battles before, so I will bet my seven thousand points, including my current points and the one thousand points I won from you.\u201d Nangong Jie said with smile.\u201cSeven thousand points?\u201d People around he were all shocked.\u201cNangong Jie is too confident!\u201d\u201cHow could he be so brave to bet seven thousand points in such an unfair confrontation?\u201d\u201cSeven thousand points?\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled sightly with his pupils shrinking, but then he rejected, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not interested in it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Nangong Jie changed his facial expression.\u201cHe refused? It was incredible!\u201d someone around exclaimed.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Swordsman can win points without any effort, but he refused it. Is he a fool?\u201d\u201cHumph! You are a real fool. Nangong Jie must have enough ability to bet on seven thousand points with the Swordsman. In my opinion, the Swordsman is really stupid if he agreed with the battle.\u201d\u201cYes,\u00a0Nangong Jie absolutely has enough confidence in his strength.\u201dMany of these disciples of Dragon Palace were shrewd enough to see through the intention of Nangong Jie.Jian Wushuang, of course, was not a fool.\u201cHumph! Wanting to set a trap for me to get more points from my hands?\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.In the past battle, though Nangong Jie did his utmost to conceal himself, Jian Wushuang saw the truth clearly.\u201cHe did not do his best, and he even just used less than half of his strength.\u201dJian Wushuang knew it clearly.It looked like Nangong Jie beat him with nearly twenty moves\u00a0in the last battle, but in fact, Nangong Jie did it deliberately.Jian Wushuang had no doubt that if Nangong Jie goes for broke, he could not withstand one move, let alone three moves.\u201cHis comprehension for sword essence is much better than me, and he definitely has the strength to break through the sixth level!\u201dThe sixth level!Yes, this was Jian Wushuang\u2019s assessment for the strength of Nangong Jie.Nangong Jie was at the level of Gold Core and his understanding of sword essence was at the sixth level of Dragon Gate. His strength could surely defeat him with no more than three moves.\u201cHe rejected? He didn\u2019t fall into my trap?\u201d Nangong Jie was very angry at this moment, \u201cHow did he know that I deliberately concealed my strength? Or was he too cautious to use seven thousand points to bet with me?\u201cNangong Jie.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s voice was heard again.Nangong Jie could not help looking up.\u201cIf you really want to bet with me, it\u2019s ok.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and continued, \u201cbut today I battled with others many times and my spiritual power has been consumed greatly. My wrist is hurt, so I have no power to battle again. Therefore, we can conduct this battle in three months\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cThree months?\u201d Nangong Jie frowned.\u201cOf course, after three months, I will have a fair battle with you, and I will accept any points you want to bet. What do you think? \u201cJian Wushuang said.Hearing these words, Nangong Jie\u2019eyes were bright.\u201cDeal!\u201d Nangong Jie agreed quickly.\u201cDeal!\u201dJian Wushuang nodded seriously.Hearing their words, people around were confused.\u201cIs this swordsman stupid?\u201d\u201cHaving a fair battle with Nangong Jie in three months? Points are also up to Nangong Jie?\u201d\u201cDoes he think that he can beat Nangong Jie in three months?\u201d\u201cHe is definitely crazy!\u201dAlmost everyone thought Jian Wushuang was crazy and silly.After all, Nangong Jie had great strength. Many disciples knew from the last battle that he could break through the sixth, and he was also an expert of the Gold Core Realm.While Jian Wushuang, just was at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm. Even if his strength was great enough to fight with Primordial Gold Core, how was his understanding of sword essence?Jian Wushuang\u2019s understanding of sword essence could just narrowly break through the fifth level.What a big gap!Could he make up such a large gap in three months?What a joke!\u201cHaha.\u201d Nangong Jie was very happy, and he laughed, \u201cYour words have been heard by so many people present. I will come see you in three months.\u201dAfter these words, Nangong Jie turned around and left happily.As he was leaving, Nangong Jie was still thinking about the scene in three months.\u201cThis guy didn\u2019t know that I just showed a small part of my strength and I didn\u2019t show my perception of sword essence completely. I also didn\u2019t show my trump card. Even in this case, I beat him easily. How can he beat me in three months?\u201d\u201cHaha, come on. I\u2019m looking forward to that day, but that day, I will bet much more than seven thousand points.\u201dNangong Jie was full of confidence for the battle in three months.All those on the Martial Arts Practice Field looked at Jian Wushuang with pity in their eyes.However, no one noticed that a subtle smile appeared in the corners of Jian Wushuang\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can\u2019t break my word, can I?\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.\u201cBut Nangong Jie is very strong.\u201d Wang Yuan said seriously.\u201cI know, Nangong Jie can break through level six,\u201d said Yang Zaixuan.\u201cI know.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded, but was not afraid. \u201cTake it easy. I promised I would duel with him and I\u2019m confident of success. In three months you\u2019ll see.\u201dJian Wushuang had a faint smile. He did not feel anxious.Perhaps three months was a short time for ordinary warriors but for Jian Wushuang it was too long.It had only taken him four months before he understood what the sword essence was.It had only taken four months before Jian Wushuang was eligible to break through to the level five of the Dragon Gate. Perhaps, even Dragon Palace disciples would be shocked at his cultivation speed.He had cultivated by himself without any teachers or help for four months. Even so, great progress had been made, not to mention now in the Dragon Palace.The Dragon Palace was renown as a holy place for cultivating. It was rich in resources.Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind; the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth; the Secret Pavilion\u2026Besides, Jian Wushuang could learn from so many talents now by exchanging views.With such wonderful conditions for cultivation, he would certainly comprehend the Realm of Heaven and Earth faster!That was why he was confident enough to duel with Nangong Jie in three months\u2019 time and had promised that no matter how many points Nangong Jie required, Jian Wushuang would agree.Anyway, nobody but Jian Wushuang himself knew the reason.\u2026Shortly afterwards Jian Wushuang went to the Secret Pavilion again.He had hardly won eleven duels in succession when he lost one in the martial art practice field. Every time he won a duel, Jian Wushuang would get 1,000 points. So he had 10,000 points in total. Including the 2,000 points from his own, he had 12,000 points in total. He was very well off now.Surely now that he had enough points, Jian Wushuang would naturally buy whatever he wanted.Using 7,000 points, he bought the Formless Sword Wave and three skills of the Formless Swordsmanship.Then he exchanged 1,500 points for the Reincarnation Sword Skill in comprehending Sword Essence of Earth.Reincarnation Sword Skill was a Sword Skill for defense; Sword Essence of Earth was the best for defense.After obtaining these three superb Sword Skill, Jian Wushuang bought 20 First-class Divine Pills with 400 points.Heavenly Spirit Pill was similar to Spirit-cultivating Pill. Only by breaking through Spiritual Sea Realm could warriors take Heavenly Spirit Pill. Weaker warriors should take Spirit-cultivating Pill. First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill was the best in Heavenly Spirit Pills. It was potent enough to produce the desired effect.In the outside world, First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill was very rare with extraordinary value, but in the Secret Pavilion of Dragon Palace it only cost 20 points for one First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill. Thus, Jian Wushuang exchanged 400 points for 20 First-class Heavenly Spirit Pills.As soon as he had bought what he wanted, he returned to his manor.In the courtyard of the manor, Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou sat at the stone table drinking wine. From time to time they turned to look at Jian Wushuang, who was practicing his Sword Skill.BZZZ\u2026Jian Wushuang happened to be aggressive with his firm sword shadow.It was quite easy for him to learn the first move of Formless Sword Wave without stopping.The second, third, fourth\u2026sixth move.Formless Sword Ripple was divided into two parts. Each part included seven sword skills. However, Jian Wushuang was such a genius that he performed the first six sword skills easily.\u201cHe has performed the sixth move?\u201d Wang Yuan was shocked.\u201cAfter having bought the Sword Skill, he performed the first six moves in merely two hours. Even if he had comprehended the sword essence of earth, he shouldn\u2019t have performed such sword tactics so fluently.\u201d Yang Zaixuan was a little surprised as well.After all, Sword Skills were combined perfectly using sword essence and swordsmanship. It was important to comprehend sword essence, but it was more important and difficult to grasp every move of the wonderful sword skills.Like a general warrior, even if he got the Sword Skills and had the appropriate sword essence, it would take a long time to learn and grasp the moves and skills of sword tactics.But Jian Wushuang was absolutely not an ordinary warrior.After having bought the sword skills, he performed the first six moves in just two hours with no difficulty.\u201cHe is a genius,\u201d Yang Zaixuan thought with eyes blazing like torches. \u201cWushuang has a gift for sword principle.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s such a genius. If an ordinary genius wants to grasp the first moves of such advanced sword skills, he must learn for several days.\u201d Wang Yuan sighed.Jian Wushuang had hardly performed the sixth move of the Formless Sword Wave when he stopped practicing.\u201cFormless Sword Wave is worth 5,000 points. Every skill or move is powerful enough, so I\u2019ll comprehend the Sword Essence of Earth as much as possible.\u201d Jian Wushuang was quite satisfied.He had always been distressed for he could not comprehend the sword essence of earth fully without suitable sword skills. But now he did not need to worry.\u201cWhat a pity. Perhaps I cannot comprehend the Sword Essence of Earth fully. Although I am trying my best, I cannot break through the sixth move,\u201d Jian Wushuang thought.He had grasped the basic skills of the seventh move but had not been able to perform the complete swordsmanship.\u201cHaste creates waste. I have to walk with a firm step.\u201dJian Wushuang thought with a faint smile. Shortly afterwards he started learning the Reincarnation Sword Skill.Early the next morning, Jian Wushuang came to the Four Temples.The Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water and Wind were renowned for their six strong temple masters, who would occasionally give instruction in the palace. Today, a master was giving lessons.Jian Wushuang went into the Ground Palace where many of Dragon Palace disciples sat on the ground. Some were discussing as they pleased.Jian Wushuang did not mind the disciples talking around him. He sat down and closed his eyes to cultivate.It was not long before a master appeared. Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and turned to him.He was a middle-aged man wearing a golden robe. He looked quite kind. He seemed to be an ordinary person without excessive tyranny, but when Jian Wushuang first looked at this middle-aged man, he found himself deeply attracted by the master, as if the man had something magical.\u201cThat is why he can give lessons in Dragon Palace. Although he showed no strength outside, he seems stronger than Ye Rufeng,\u201d Jian Wushuang thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He occasionally performed a few movements of the Earth Essence Realm.Every one of the disciples, including Jian Wushuang, listened intently.It was not long before Jian Wushuang felt puzzled about the lessons. He fell into deep thought.After an hour, the man stopped teaching. He waved his hands to the people in the palace before all the disciples on the ground left.Jian Wushuang rose to walk out of the palace slowly. He was in deep contemplation. He did not come out of it until he was far away from the palace.\u201cIs that it? That\u2019s the reason!\u201dA flash appeared on Jian Wushuang\u2019s face; his eyes were sparkling like fire. He turned to gaze at the Earth Temple and inhaled deeply.He was clear that though the middle-aged man had only taught for one hour, Jian Wushuang had still learned a lot. He had also comprehended unknown knowledge about Sword Essence of Earth in his head.\u201cPerhaps this is why the Four Temples are called one of the Three Treasures of Dragon Palace. It was so helpful to listen to the lessons from the Temple Master.\u201d Jian Wushuang sighed.Four Temples of the Three Treasures of Dragon Palace did not require many points. Dragon Palace Disciples could listen to their lessons whenever they wanted. But this did not mean the Four Temples were useless. Instead, the Four Temples were sometimes more helpful and larger than the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth and the Secret Pavilion.\u201cI did not comprehend a lot and had no teachers to ask before. I relied only on myself to cultivate. However, everything I needed is now in front of me. Next I\u2019ll know what achievements I can make.\u201d Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly with eyes sparkling.From then on, Jian Wushuang was deeply focused on cultivating.His cultivation was very regular.When the Temple Masters of the Earth Temple and the Wind Temple in the Four Temples gave general lessons, Jian Wushuang would go and study by himself afterwards.Sometimes he would go to the Martial Arts Practice Field and watch the other disciples\u2019 fights. When he fought with others, he always kept his strength.As for the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth, he could not go there whenever he wanted. After all, although it was helpful for him to comprehend the Sword Essence there, he would think about the mechanism of it for a long time. Thus, Jian Wushuang went there once every two weeks in general.Three months passed quickly.These were the most precious three months for any newcomer.One must know that almost everyone lacked in good teachers and cultivation resources before going to the Dragon Palace. So they began to learn considerably in the three months.In the history of the Dragon Palace, some disciples had been ordinary but after the three months they showed significant talent and improved remarkably.Never mind Jian Wushuang who had woken up his Sword Soul during the three months, how much had he improved?He was in the manor.His sword shadow was so swift that it was like lightning in the sky.A gust of wind passed.When he stopped performing, the wind died away.Everything fell into silence.\u201cNo, this movement is still far from perfect.\u201d Jian Wushuang wrinkled his brows in concentration. Though it was fast enough, he was not satisfied with the movement he had just performed.\u201cI have completely grasped the fourth movement of the Formless Swordsmanship but the fifth is still wrong.\u201dThe fourth movement of the Formless Swordsmanship was named A Hundred Variations, which he had completely grasped in two months. But the fifth\u2026 It was much more difficult than the fourth.\u201cThe first three movements of the Formless Swordsmanship were very complicated while the middle three movements were even more difficult. Never mind the last three movements. That\u2019s why the Formless Swordsmanship is renowned as the greatest Sword Skill in Tianzong Dynasty.\u201dAlthough the Formless Sword Wave was also a sword skill, it only took him two hours to completely grasp all of the first seven movements and perform the first six movements on the ground.But the Formless Swordsmanship was much more complicated than the Formless Sword Wave. He had completely comprehended the fourth movements after three months. However, he did not understand the fifth.\u201cWushuang.\u201dWang Yuan hastily came in with his raspy voice and Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou followed him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jian Wushuang turned to look at them.Wang Yuan approached Jian Wushaung and breathed for a while before he said, \u201cNangong Jie has gone through the Dragon Gate Pass.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Jian Wushuang was a little surprised but immediately said with a faint smile, \u201cwhich level did he pass?\u201d\u201cThe Sixth.\u201d Wang Yuan looked serious and said, \u201cas we know, he has passed the sixth in less than an hour. It will not be long before he goes through the seventh, but he will stay there for a long time before he advances further.\u201cThree months ago, I knew he could pass the sixth, but he did not try until today. It was obviously deliberate for him to go through the sixth today when you will fight with him. I think he was afraid you might flee away if he did so earlier.\u201d Yang Zaixuan said.Timid Su Rou, who had been speechless, added, \u201cThere\u2019s a threshold between the sixth and the seventh Dragon Gate. The level keeper of the seventh is much stronger than that of the sixth. He could fight with the level keeper of the seventh, which means he is very strong.\u201dJian Wushuang listened carefully and he nodded slightly.Indeed, it was not a big deal for him to go through the sixth because they had already known he could pass it. But it was completely different for him to fight with the level keeper of the seventh.\u201cNangong Jie\u2019s capacity to understand the Sword Essence is the best even among the disciples who have gone through the sixth.\u201d Yang Zaixuan said.\u201cWushuang, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d Wang Yuan turned to look at him.\u201cAll I can do is take measures according to the actual situation.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled.\u201cYou have a big heart.\u201d Wang Yuan rolled his eyes.Jian Wushuang smiled. He did not feel anxious.He had passed the sixth level in Dragon Gate and fought sharply for a long time with a seventh level keeper. So what?\u201cSo What?\u201dI\u2019m not shocked by that at all.It\u2019s funny!It was because he had not gone through the Dragon Palace for three months. Otherwise it was Nangong Jie who had to worry now.\u201cYou three can talk while I have to go to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth once more.\u201d Jian Wushuang said. He left to go to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.Wang Yuan and the others watched Jian Wushuang\u2019s back from afar. They were worried.\u201cWushuang must be anxious. That\u2019s why he is going to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. I am afraid he\u2019s not confident about fighting with Nangong Jie.\u201d Wang Yuan said seriously, \u201cI hope Nangong Jie will not bet too many points. Otherwise it\u2019ll be your turn to win back the points for Wushuang.\u201d\u201cI do not mind fighting with him. But I am afraid Nangong Jie dares not to fight with me,\u201d Yang Zaixuan said in a cold voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Nangong Jie got past the sixth level in Dragon Gate. He even fought a close battle for a long time with a seventh level keeper.\u201d\u201cOf course! Nangong Jie didn\u2019t fight earlier or later until the last day before the duel. His purpose was very clear.\u201d\u201cLook, he is coming.\u201dNangong Jie, in a luxurious robe with charming smile, and another two disciples came over side by side slowly walking amongst all the disciples of Dragon Palace.The two disciples were well-known in Dragon Palace, who both had passed the sixth level.\u201cYou two, don\u2019t forget what I told you.\u201d Nangong Jie talked with the two disciples in a low voice.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will never forget what we have promised. Not to mention that it is also important for us.\u201d one of them replied.\u201c3000 points! It is not a small number. I will not lend it to you easily if I didn\u2019t know your actual ability.\u201d the other one smiled.\u201cSo, you two just enjoy the fight. As soon as the fight is over, I will return the 3000 points with an extra 1000 points.\u201d Nangong Jie smiled.\u201cOf course! We have never doubted your ability.\u201d The two disciples smiled. They have both battled with Nangong Jie, so they knew his ability. There was no point worrying.It was why they agreed to lend their points to Nangong Jie.Not long after Nangong Jie arrived at the Martial Arts Practice Field, Jian Wushuang also appeared, of course followed by Wang Yuan and others.\u201cLook! The newbie is coming.\u201d\u201cIt seems that he is confident.\u201d\u201cEm\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t a genius like him who is qualified to be a member of Dragon Palace be confident? What\u2019s more, he has been in Dragon Palace for three months, which is a time of great improvement. So as a newbie, he must have improved significantly in this period. \u201d\u201cGreat improvement? So what? How far can he go in three months? He could get past the fifth level with difficulty three months ago. It is unlikely that he could reach the sixth level. He can only beat Nangong Jie in his dreams.\u201d\u201cYeah, he is a newbie after all. Hope he won\u2019t lose too badly.\u201d\u201cGuess how many points will Nangong Jie bet with the newbie? The newbie has said in public that he will agree with any amount of points.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see. He won\u2019t win any way. It will be a lesson for him to be more humble as a newbie.\u201dDisciples of Dragon Palace on the scene spoke loudly without much thought, so both Jian Wushuang and Nangong Jie could hear them clearly.\u201cSwordsman, you dared to come?\u201d Nangong Jie laughed and looked at Jian Wushuang.\u201cI promised to fight with you three months ago, so I\u2019ve come.\u201d Jian Wushuang said indifferently.\u201cGreat courage! but you are a newbie after all, too naive.\u201d Nangong Jie shook his head and said.\u201cCut the crap, Nangong Jie, how many points do you want to bet?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You are a newbie after all, so I won\u2019t go too far.\u201d Nangong Jie grinned, \u201cI know you won 11 fight three months ago. Although you have been defeated by me, you won 10 thousand points in the end. Plus you came to here to fight and won some points. So you have about 15 thousand points.\u201d\u201cI have borrowed my friends\u2019 points,12 thousand in total. Let\u2019s bet 12 thousand points.\u201d\u201c12 thousand points?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this too much?\u201dAll the people present were stunned.They all knew that Jian Wushuang got many points by fighting. But scores were very valuable and important in Secret Pavilion and Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. It must be difficult for him to take out 12 thousand points.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too much?\u201d\u201c12 thousand points?\u201d12 thousand points were enough to exchange for several secret techniques or to go to Secret Land of Heaven and Earth 12 times.It was a large amount for any Disciples of Dragon Palace. Nangong Jie had gone too far in betting 12 thousand points.\u201cEm? Do you think the points are too much? But you said yourself that you would agree to whatever bet I wanted.\u201d Nangong Jie put on an act and said.\u201c12 thousand points? OK.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded his head directly.\u201cHaha, great courage.\u201d Nangong Jie said with a smile immediately.The Drill Ground was immediately filled with turmoil.\u201cHe agreed! The Swordsman dared to take it?\u201d\u201cIt is 12 thousand points!?\u201d\u201cThe Swordsman has so many points? \u201d\u201cIs he being arrogant at his own cost?\u201dSeeing all the worried eyes, Jian Wushuang smiled secretly and turned to Wang Yuan and other two people.\u201cBro, bro senior and sis junior, I need you to borrow me some points.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.He did not have 12 thousand points, but he could borrow them.\u201cDo you have the confidence, bro? It is 12 thousand points.\u201d Wang Yuan frowned and said.\u201cDefinitely! \u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cOK, it is enough to hear that. I trust you. You can have all my 4 thousand points.\u201d Wang Yuan said directly.\u201d I have exchanged for two secrets before, so I don\u2019t have that many. You can have my left 1.5 thousand points.\u201d Yang Zaixuan said.\u201cYou can also have my 3 thousand points.\u201d Su Rou said timidly.\u201cEnough.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at his bros and sis gratefully.Jian Wushuang regarded the three people as his bros and sis the moment they lent their points to him without any hesitation.\u201c12 thousand points.\u201d Jian Wushuang took out his disciple\u2019s pledge. The points in the pledge were shown to everyone. Jian Wushuang looked at Nangong Jie with a threatening gaze.\u201cNangong Jie, you looked for this fight yourself !\u201d\u201cPrimordial Gold Core is a big deal?\u201d\u201cYou got past the sixth level in Dragon Gate and fought closely for a long time with a seventh level keeper. Is that a big deal?\u201d\u201cI will test how much progress I have made in the three months by fighting with you.\u201d\u201cCome on!\u201dA 12-thousand-point battle would begin at any moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chuu! A cold sword shadow broke the air and moved towards Jian Wushuang.The sword edge was cold enough to tear through anything.\u201cFormless Swordsmanship? \u201d Jian Wushuang was surprised.Jian Wushang was very familiar with this sword skill. Nangong Jie was using the first move of the Formless Sword Art, Blood Shadow.Jian Wushuang drew his sword and used the Formless Sword Art too.The two sword shadows were both incredibly fast. They entwined with each other like two serpents, then separated immediately after colliding.\u201cFuck off!\u201dFollowed by a howl, the long sword in Jian Wushuang\u2019s hand drew up\u00a0immediately, filled with killing intent.A\u00a0fresh bloody sword shadow moved through the air like it was dancing in the wind.In an instant, the air was cut through directly.\u201cHaha.\u201dNangong Jie laughed. Then he moved his wrist and used the same sword movement.It started with the First Move, Blood Shadow, then came the Second Move, Sword-killing Movement.They were tied\u00a0again at\u00a0the end.\u201cTime for a different skill.\u201d Jian Wushuang had a cold look in his eyes.Whoosh!A sword shadow immediately stabbed out. It seemed very slow, but the real speed was astonishingly fast.The fourth move of Formless Swordsmanship, One Hundred Illusions!\u201cThe fourth move? Ridiculous,\u201d Nangong Jie yelled out and grinned.The same slow sword came out from Nangong Jie.They struck each other and\u00a0then separated at the same time.Jian Wushuang stared at Nangong Jie with a dignified look.\u201cSwordsman, this is your level of strength after earnest cultivation in Dragon Palace for three months?\u201d Nangong Jie stared at Jian Wushuang with a little derision, \u201cit is really brave of you to take out those 12,000 points and fight with only this much strength. Stupid enough. \u201d\u201cI will show you my real strength.\u201dAfter saying that, Nangong Jie prepared to make his next move.Weng\u2026 It seemed slow, but it was actually an astonishingly fast strike. Nangong Jie still used the fourth move, One Hundred Illusions.It was\u00a0the same move, but it was twice as fast as before.The previous sword strike was already extremely fast. How did he manage to reach a speed that was twice as fast as before?\u201cSo fast !\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s complexion couldn\u2019t help changing when he saw that terrifying speed sword.\u201cYou lose,\u201d Nangong Jie growled in an excited voice at that moment.\u201cWill he be defeated?\u201d All the people around there paid attention to the scene, watched as the sword light approached Jian Wushuang.\u201cHmm!\u201dAfter the Hum,\u00a0Sword Essence of Earth was released from Jian Wushuang\u2019s sword. A thorough and majestic sword shadow struck out.The sword shadow seemed to be overlapped by numerous sword shadows, striking out violently.It seemed like a 100-million pound\u00a0mountain, grinding everything as it violently moved forwards.\u201cWhat?\u201d Nangong Jie\u2019s complexion changed a lot. Before he could respond, the \u201c100-million pound mountain\u201d reached him.Peng!The\u00a0loud roar shook the whole space instantly, with its power forming\u00a0several shock waves. It even swept away many disciples of Dragon Palace that were too close at that time.After that strike, on the battleground, Nangong Jie was knocked back awkwardly. He quickly noticed a sharp pain in his palm and a little blood.A giant sword scar, nearly a foot wide, was left on the ground in front of him.Lots of disciples of Dragon Palace around there gasped after seeing the sword scar.\u201cIt was the seventh move, Formless Sword Wave. \u201d Some disciples of Dragon Palace immediately recognized the swordsmanship Jian Wushuang used just now.\u201cFormless Sword Wave? \u201d Nangong Jie felt stressed.There were a lot of sword skills in the Secret Pavilion. That included some famous ones, such as Formless Sword Wave. He knew that.Formless Sword Wave was quite fitting for warriors who comprehended the Sword Essence of Earth. In general, if you could\u00a0fully use the sixth move, you\u00a0would be able to pass the fifth level in the Dragon Gate. As for the seventh move, it was no problem to get past the sixth level in the Dragon Gate.\u201cI was too careless. I didn\u2019t expect his comprehension of the Sword Essence of Earth to be much higher than the Sword Essence of Gale, but\u2026 this is the\u00a0end. I will not give him another chance to use that move.\u201d Nangong Jie thought solemnly.The seventh move, Formless Sword Wave, was powerful. A sane person would not confront the toughness with toughness. However, Warriors who comprehended the Sword Essence of Gale depended on speed, rather than strength.\u201cNangong Jie!\u201dJian Wushuang\u2019s voice rang out suddenly. His black eyes stared at this Nangong Jie with indifference.\u201cYou said you would show me your real strength just now, and\u00a0I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d Jian Wushuang spoke, with a grin that was similar to a blade, \u201cNow, I\u2019ll let you see my real strength.\u201dAfter saying that, Jian Wushuang held the Triple-kill Sword with both hands, raising the Long Sword high.Wengweng~~~ The splendid Sword Essence of Earth reached its peak at that moment.Boom!Such a terrifying sword stroke.Before the sword stroke landed, everyone already felt a horrible power was continuously\u00a0condensing. The momentum in Jian Wushuang\u2019s Triple-kill Sword increased suddenly and sharply.Everyone saw a giant sword shadow forming slowly, three meters long and half-meter wide.Oppression!The moment the giant sword shadow formed, the oppressive atmosphere reached its peak.The air seemed to shiver.\u201cFormless Sword Wave, the eighth move!\u201d Jian Wushuang shouted out suddenly.The huge streak of sword shadow drew everyone\u2019s attention. With a soaring aura, it wavered slightly and then lashed out.The world suddenly changed colors.\u201cThe eighth move? Can it really be the eighth move?\u201d Nangong Jie\u2019s eye opened widely.He was already shocked\u00a0when Jian Wushuang used the\u00a0seventh move. Now, Jian Wushuang was about to use the eighth move\u2026It was well-known that anyone who was able to perform the seventh move was qualified to reach the sixth level.\u201cThe eighth move?\u201dThe Formless Sword Wave, eighth move, along with his comprehension of the Sword Essence of Earth, was enough to pass the seventh level.Seventh floor!Although he fought fiercely with the keeper of the seventh floor for a long time when he went through the Dragon Gate yesterday, he knew that it was not a fierce fight. Instead, It was a very suffocating fight because he was completely suppressed by the keeper.He only managed to prolong the fight for a while by relying on his speed.He clearly understood that he was far from being able to pass the seventh level.But now, someone who entered Dragon Palace for only three months ago, surpassed him completely incomprehension of Sword Essence.Nangong Jie was dumbfounded when the splendid, giant sword shadow, hacked directly towards him. Following that, an unprecedented look of madness appeared on his face.\u201cSwordsman, you made me do this!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The mighty power then turned into a strong breeze and dissipated.However, after tearing the sword shadow into pieces, the power of that sword shadow still persisted and turned into a light flying straight towards Jian Wushuang.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d shockingly, Jian Wushuang swung his sword against it immediately.Clang!A violent power crashed over Jian Wushuang with a loud bang. He was forced to step back, each step heavy enough to crack the ground.When he came to a stop, he shook his stinging palms.Jian Wushuang looked up at Nangong Jie again with an extremely serious expression, \u201cNangong Jie, I have looked down on you. I would have never thought that you would not only hide your comprehension of Sword Essence, but also your Cultivation of Spiritual Power.\u201d\u201cMaybe only a few people knew you were at Profound Gold Core Realm in Dragon Palace.\u201dProfound Gold Core Realm!Right. This moment, the Spiritual Power of Nangong Jie had reached Profound Gold Core Realm.When the Disciples of Dragon Palace on Martial Art Practice Field noticed his Spiritual Power, a stir was raised.\u201cProfound Gold Core Realm? Nangong Jie has reached Profound Gold Core Realm?\u201d\u201cA man who has reached Profound Gold Core Realm challenged a new guy who was at the Level of Spiritual Sea to a duel?\u201cNangong Jie might be going too far!\u201dThe gazes of disciples of Dragon Palace looking at Nangong Jie, suddenly changed.One should know that one has his own pride as a genius. Anyway, Jian Wushuang had just reached Spiritual Sea Realm. As a Primordial Gold Core, Nangong Jie was just bullying.And now, Nangong Jie had revealed that his Cultivation of Spiritual Power reached Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201cA man who has reached Profound Gold Core Realm challenged a warrior who was at the Level of Spiritual Sea to a duel?It was far more than bullying, this was shameless!\u201cNangong Jie, as a Profound Gold Core Realm, you challenged my bro to a duel? You are so shameless, so brazen! If I were you, I would hide my face in disgrace.\u201d Wang Yuan shouted from the sidelines.\u201cHuh.\u201d Nangong Jie looked around and said in his chilliest tone, \u201cThe world has its law of the jungle, and the Dragon Palace has too. How would you fight a duel to win points if you don\u2019t even know how to hide your strength?\u201d\u201cSwordsman.\u201d Nangong Jie looked at Jian Wushuang, \u201cyou, as a freshman entering Dragon Palace for less than three months, it\u2019s an honor to force me to this situation. I will still gladly accept your twelve thousand points.\u201dBoom!Nangong Jie pushed off the ground which cracked at once.With an ear-piercing rushing sound, Nangong Jie slashed with his sword. It was still Formless Swordsmanship.Under the outburst of Spiritual Power of Profound Gold Core Realm, the speed and power had both reached a brand new level.The sword light pierced the void and whistled, its amazing speed and intense power were heart-stopping.Disciples of Dragon Palace held their breath as they watched this.\u201cNangong Jie, do you think you can defeat me like this? Ridiculous.\u201d Jian Wushuang sneered. Although Nangong Jie\u2019s Spiritual Power was at Profound Gold Core Realm, he was still calm.\u201cReincarnation Sword Skill!\u201dWhen Nangong Jie\u2019s swordsmanship swept through, Jian Wushuang engaged Reincarnation Sword Skill.The vast Sword Essence of Earth was maximized in the meantime.Reincarnation Sword Skill, a defensive Sword Skill, which could be exchanged for with1,500 points. It could not be compared to Formless Sword Wave. However, if it was properly used, its power could overcome the Formless Sword Wave.Moreover, because of the low points needed for Reincarnation Sword Skill and its outwardly simple technique compared to Formless Sword Wave and Formless Swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang could master this Sword Skill perfectly.Jian Wushuang has completely mastered the Reincarnation Sword Skill in the last three months, even reaching the peak.And now he used the Reincarnation Sword Skill to its full potential.Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!Continuous clanging sounded around the Martial Art Practice Field, the surrounding Disciples of Dragon Palace were shocked to see this.\u201cHow fast! How strong!\u201d\u201cThis swordsmanship is so fast, so amazing!\u201d\u201cLook, the Swordsman is being completely suppressed, he seems to be losing!\u201d\u201cThat is not necessarily the case. Don\u2019t you see that the Swordsman has resisted Nangong Jie\u2019s swordsmanship even though he is being suppressed all the time. His defense is watertight!\u201d\u201cRight. He has mastered the Reincarnation Sword Skill completely and put it to good use. It won\u2019t be easy for Nangong Jie to win.\u201dLots of disciples started discussing in whispers.On the battlefield, Sword Flash struck at high speed and from multiple angles. Nangong Jie\u2019s swordsmanship, perception of Sword Essence and Cultivation of Spiritual Power of the Profound Gold Core Realm had reached perfection.The heart palpitating Sword Flash generated an irresistible feeling among the surrounding disciples.But what about Jian Wushuang?The sword kept moving, dauntless.His swordsmanship seems simple, but resisted all the sword shadows perfectly.It was true that Nangong Jie\u2019s Sword Flash was powerful, and it had completely suppressed Jian Wushuang who had no chance to strike back. Still, Jian Wushuang was resisting every attack from Nangong Jie.\u201cWell, although his Cultivation of Spiritual has reached Profound Gold Core Realm and his power is much better than mine, I can still defend. When I use my Reincarnation Swordsmanship, I can weaken the power of his swordsmanship. Otherwise, even if I could block, its impact force would be enough to defeat me.\u201d\u201cBut now, he can dream about my defeat.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s expression was cold.The most exquisite part of Reincarnation Sword Skill is its ability to wear the opponent down.Using the sword strokes to weaken the power gradually. Finally, the power from the attacks had no impact to him.\u201cThis boy is so hard to deal with.\u201dNangong Jie\u2019s expression became unsightly as his attacks were blocked by Jian Wushuang over and over again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His defense is perfect and can even disperse force. Perhaps I could defeat him directly if my swordsmanship much faster than his.\u201d Nangong Jie said to himself.He needed a stronger and faster swordsmanship to defeat Jian Wsuhaung, but he has already used his full strength. How can he make it faster?\u201cThere is only one way to defeat him, though it\u2019s a bit disgraceful. However, even if it\u2019s shameful\u2026 if I win, I will receive 12,000 points.\u201d Nangong Jie\u2019s face turned grim.He had already made up his mind to defeat Jian Wushuang in the most unethical and dishonorable way.That way is\u2026 through Spiritual Power consumption!Spiritual Power is the source of power. The importance can be imagined.During the battle, Spiritual Power was constantly consumed, but it has a limit!Nangong Jie decided that he would compete against Jian Wushuang using the consumption of Spiritual Power.After all, he was in the Primordial Gold Core Realm and had reached the Profound Gold Core Realm.\u00a0However, Jian Wushuang was only in the Level of Spiritual Sea.There were two sub-Realms between them, including a true Realm. Under normal circumstances, Nangong Jie should have much more spiritual power Jian Wushuang. Naturally, he should last longer during battle.Once Jian Wushuang\u2019s spiritual power runs out, he would win.Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew!The roar of swordsmanship continued. But, as the battle continued, the disciples of Dragon Palace began to understand Nangong Jie\u2019s intention.\u201cHow shameless Nangong Jie is.\u201d Wang Yuan gnashed his teeth.\u201cHe\u2019s going too far!\u201d\u201cAs someone in the Profound Gold Core Realm, he should stop and end it in a draw if he can\u2019t quickly defeat an opponent in the Spiritual Sea Realm. That way, he would suffer less embarrassment. But now, he actually wants to rely on his advantage in Spiritual Power to compete with Swordsman!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. Even if he wins, I would despise him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so humiliating. He even makes me, an expert of the Gold Core Realm, feel extreme shame.\u201dThe disciples of Dragon Palace looked at Nangong Jie with disdain.Even the two who came with Nangong Jie looked at each other for a moment with complex feelings. They also thought Nangong Jie is being ignoble. However, considering that they had loaned their points to him, if he won, they would also benefit. So they didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cHmph, idiots.\u201dDuring the battle, Nangong Jie glanced at the surrounding disciples of Dragon Palace, sneering in his heart, \u201cIt is disgraceful, so what! The winner takes all. I will even do despicable acts to win those 12,000 points.\u201d\u201cLose, lose.\u201dNangong Jie watched Jian Wushuang, paying attention to his aura of spiritual power, but his complexion quickly changed.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThis is impossible!\u201dIt was unbelievable.Yes, he could not believe it.\u201cHe, he has been fighting with me for so long, but his Spiritual Power is \u2026 it is not weakening at all?\u201d Nangong Jie looked startled.As someone in the Profound Gold Core Realm, he has already consumed more than half of his spiritual power while fighting for so long. But what about Jian Wushuang?His aura was still grand, his swordsmanship was still sharp, and his spiritual power was still strong. There were no signs of him weakening.\u201cHow is that possible!\u201d Nangong Jie couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.However, when Jian Wushuang saw the rich expression on Nangong Jie\u2019s face, the corner of his mouth lifted, turning into a cold smile.\u201cSpiritual power consumption?\u201d\u201cYou want to defeat me with only spiritual power consumption?\u201dJian Wushuang really wanted to mock Nangong Jie at this moment.He practices the Heavenly Creation Skill!Although it seemed that he was in Spiritual Sea Realm, the Spiritual Sea Realm for the Heavenly Creation Skill is the Ultimate Spirit Sea!What is the Ultimate Spirit Sea? It is a vast sea of spiritual power!When he first broke through to the Ultimate Spirit Sea, he had ten times as much spiritual power as ordinary warriors in the Spiritual Sea Realm. However, he kept practicing these last three months. Not only that, he had eaten and absorbed the effects of 21 first-class Heavenly Spirit pills.Now, he was at the second stage of the Ultimate Spirit Sea, Endless Spiritual Power. He had 100 times more than an ordinary warrior in Spiritual Sea Realm!100 times more spiritual power!And Nangong Jie, in the Profound Gold Core Realm, only had several times that of ordinary warriors in the Spiritual Sea Realm. How dare he compete against Jian Wushuang using consumption of spiritual power!It was like a novice warrior in Sword Principle\u00a0complimenting his swordsmanship is in front of a Master of swordsmanship.It was stupid, just ridiculous.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, impossible.\u201d Nangong Jie\u2019s face had become extremely pale.He could suppress Jian Wushuang in a fight, but he couldn\u2019t win. Adding to that, his consumption of spiritual power was far more than Jian Wushuang\u2019s. Eventually, he would lose.\u201cSwordsman, stop. Can we end this in a tie?\u201d Nangong Jie said quickly.\u201cA tie?\u201d Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help cursing, \u201cNangong Jie, I knew you were shameless, but I did not expect you to be this shameless!\u201d\u201cIt is already ridiculous for you, an expert in the Profound Gold Core Realm, to fight with me, someone in the Spiritual Sea Realm. When you realized that you could not defeat me directly, you even tried to defeat me using the consumption of spiritual power.\u201d\u201cBut that did not work. Now you know that your consumption is faster than mine, and you actually have the guts to say that you want to end this in a tie.\u201d\u201cNangong Jie, be a man. I have never met someone who is as shameless as you!\u201dJian Wushuang cursed him openly, with no mercy, while the surrounding disciples of Dragon Palace looked at Nangong Jie in disdain.At first, he did not want to end with a tie. Now that he was going to lose, he wanted to stop with a tie.He was treating everyone like they were fools.\u201cBastard!\u201dNangong Jie tensed up. Now, with more than 90 percent of his spiritual power gone, his lack of spiritual power led to a sharp reduction in the speed and power of his swordsmanship.Jian Wushuang, who had been suppressed by him, struck back at this moment.Om! Om! Om!His sword shadows were displayed majestically using the Sword Essence of Earth. Jian Wushuang was obviously still at his peak and his sword continued to strike out. Nangong Jie had been completely defeated.Finally, a cold sword shadow swept out directly across Nangong Jie\u2019s arm, while Jian Wushuang used his foot to kick him. Nangong Jie flew back in an arc, like a parabola, eventually falling onto the ground.\u201cNangong Jie lost!\u201dThe whole Martial Arts Practice Field\u00a0fell into silence.And at this moment, Jian Wushuang walked to Nangong Jie slowly, under everyone\u2019s gaze, looking down at him indifferently.\u201cYou Lost!\u201d\u201c12,000 points. Pay up!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After slowly standing up, his expression grew ferocious and was filled with resistance.Yes, he was not willing. He did not want to concede, even though he was defeated by Jian Wushuang after using his full power.However, no matter how unwilling he was, it was a fact that he lost to Jian Wushuang. He could not quibble. Ultimately, he could only tremble as he gave 12,000 points to Jian Wushuang.On the other side, the two disciples who had previously loaned points to Nangong Jie had a pale look.After seeing more than 12,000 points in his token, Jian Wushuang grinned and faced Nangong Jie again. \u201cNangong Jie, I have some advice for you\u2026 Natural iniquity can be forgiven, but human iniquity can not.\u201dNangong Jie trembled physically and mentally.Suddenly\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a good sentence. This rookie of the Dragon Palace is becoming more and more arrogant.\u201dA strong voice sounded out in the Martial Arts Practice Field, slowly followed by a red-robed man with a saber\u00a0on his back.Everyone looked turned to face him at the same time.\u201cSu Lie!\u201d\u201cIt is him?\u201d\u201cThe tyrant, Su Lie!\u201dAfter seeing him, many of the disciples of Dragon Palace that were present couldn\u2019t help exhaling a breath of cold air. Obviously, they were in awe of this man.\u201cSu Lie! Why is he here?\u201d Wang Yuan\u2019s expression instantly changed after seeing this person.\u201cWho is Su Lie?\u201d At this moment, Yang Zaixuan, who was always silent, frowned and asked. He sensed a mighty pressure that he had only felt from Bai Cheng since the time he joined Dragon Palace three months ago.\u201cThe tyrant Su Lie, a top genius among the disciples of Dragon Palace. Su Lie was the only one who could possibly be compared with Bai Cheng, before second brother joined Dragon Palace,\u201d said Wang Yuan.Hearing this, Yang Zaixuan\u2019s eyes could not help but squint.\u201cA warrior, who is in the Profound Gold Core Realm, was defeated by a rookie who has only been here for three months. Not only that, the rookie is only in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Nangong Jie, you are definitely shameful enough,\u201d said the burly man, Su Lie, with a laugh.Nangong Jie had a pale look on his face.If these words were said by someone else, he would be furious. However, these words were spoken by Su Lie, who was also known as a tyrant. He was afraid to display even a little bit of a temper in front of Su Lie.Su Lie glanced at Nangong Jie, but he was too lazy to talk to him. Looking at Jian Wushuang though, he said, \u201clittle guy, your name is Swordsman, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded with a serious expression.When Su Lie appeared in front of him and looked at him, all the pores in Jian Wushuang\u2019s body were directly tied up. This feeling felt similar to being looked at by a fierce ancient beast.Jian Wushuang immediately understood that Su Lie\u2019s strength was terrifying.\u201cI have heard of you. When you entered Dragon Palace three months ago, you only made it through the fourth level. But now, three months later, you should be able to make it through the seventh level with your comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. That speed is matchless in Dragon Palace. Such a genius, I can\u2019t help being interested in you. Why not fight with me?\u201d Su Lie said casually.\u201cBattle with you?\u201d Jian Wushuang changed his countenance, but he immediately shook his head without any hesitation, and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not interested.\u201dJian Wushuang did not want to battle with Su Lie at all.The reason was simple. Su Lie\u2019s strength was terrifying.Although he never made a move and just stood in front of Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang knew that he was not this man\u2019s opponent.It was hard to say whether or not he could even take one move from Su Lie.The gap in strength was incredible and Jian Wushuang had no interest in being abused.\u201cYou are refusing me?\u201d Su Lie\u2019s countenance became clouded, but he suddenly grinned and said, \u201d I don\u2019t want to make a bet with you, I just want a pure fight with you. Your refusal\u2026 What good is it?\u201dBoom!The floor under Su Lie\u2019s feet exploded instantly and the figure of Su Lie rushed forwards. At first glance, it looked like a mass of hot flames was fiercely racing towards Jian Wushuang.\u201cOh no!\u201dAt the moment when Su Lie started moving, two figures also rushed out, simultaneously, from behind Jian Wushuang.Those two people, one was Yang Zaixuan, and the other was Su Rou, who rarely spoke.As for Wang Yuan, he had only gone through the fourth level,\u00a0so he was unable to help Jian Wushuang.Two traces of flowing light appeared simultaneously, in front of Jian Wushuang.Yang Zaixuan\u2019s eyes were cold and his saber was already drawn.In Su Rou\u2019s hands, there was a two-meter-long, thick and heavy sword. Her slender figure raised the heavy sword and chopped out.\u201cHaha, you want to stop me by yourselves?\u201dSu Lie laughed while clenching his five fingers. Then, a terrifying flame filled with the Essence of Raging Fire was released. It was as if he could burn everything around it. Then, Su Lie used his fist to directly attack them.A violent force suddenly rushed towards them.Yang Zaixuan was someone who had gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate.And Su Rou, herself, had gone through the seventh level.As for Su Lie, on the surface, his strength was equal to a warrior who went through the seventh level.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dTwo deep crashes sounded and the figures of Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou were both knocked backwards.They were knocked back forcefully, it was not because they moved backwards.The next moment, Su Lie struck out with his fist again. This fist smashed directly toward Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang quickly lifted his sword and executed the Reincarnation Sword Skill with his full power in an attempt to parry it.\u201cBang!\u201dA terrifying power arrived. The force was more than Jian Wushuang could parry, even with the Reincarnation Sword Skill. Subsequently, the figure of Jian Wushuang was sent flying back under that terrifying force, smashing onto the ground behind him.Silence!Everyone at the Martial Arts Practice Field looked startled. The only emerging voice was from disciples of Dragon Palace swallowing their saliva.\u201cFearsome!\u201dSimilar words echoed in everyone\u2019s mind.It was indeed terrifying. In only a flash, Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou were defeated without any room to even struggle.\u201cSo strong!\u201d Jian Wushuang slowly rose to his feet and wiped the blood from his lips, but there was a trace of shock in his eyes.\u201cHis Cultivation of Spiritual Power absolutely reaches the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Not only that, his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is far higher than mine!\u201d Jian Wushuang thought secretly.\u201cI have gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. But based on his attack, I know that his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is definitely higher than mine.\u201d Yang Zaixuan had a serious look on his face.\u201cYou two.\u201d Su Lie clasped his hands and looked at Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan. \u201cA word of advice, as rookies, you better keep a low profile. Dragon Palace is not as simple as you think. What you are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg.\u201dJian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan were both startled.What they had seen of Dragon Palace so far was only the tip of the iceberg!Su Lie was too lazy to explain any more and he wanted to leave. But, after only taking two steps, he stopped suddenly. He looked to the side,\u00a0smiled, and said, \u201cBai Cheng, you have been watching for so long. Have you seen enough? If you are itching for a fight, I don\u2019t mind playing with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He, Bai Cheng, was the top person of Dragon Palace.As everyone was looking at Su Lie, no one noticed Bai Cheng\u2019s arrival.\u201cSu Lie, I hope I didn\u2019t upset you.\u201d Bai Cheng squinted at Su Lie.\u201cYou don\u2019t provoke me, but just looking at you puts me in a bad mood. What can you do? If you feel bad, we can play a game and take a bet.\u201d Su Lie sneered and gave a bold look.Bai Cheng\u2019s countenance was clouded and he shouted in a low voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it. One day sooner or later, I\u2019ll beat you down completely.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m waiting, but before this, you can think of ways to climb up the Earthly Dragon List.\u201d Su Lie smiled and then left.\u201cHumpph.\u201d\u00a0Bai Cheng gave a cold grunt and then left.This scene made many Disciples of Dragon Palace on the Martial Arts Practice Field look confused.\u201cIt\u2019s said that Bai Cheng is the strongest disciple in the Dragon Palace. But why do I perceive that Bai Cheng seemed to be afraid of Su Lie?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think that Bai Cheng doesn\u2019t dare to battle with Su Lie.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth happened?\u201dThose Disciples of Dragon Palace were confounded, as were Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.Soon after, people on the Martial Arts Practice Field began to disperse.In the Dragon Palace.\u201cPalace Master White.\u201dAppearing in front of Palace Master White, Su Lie said with great respect but not the previous superciliousness on the Martial Arts Practice Field, \u201cI have given Swordsman and Yang Zaixuan some lessons based on your order.\u201d\u201cOK. I have seen it. Good job,\u201d Palace Master White nodded slightly and said, \u201cSwordsman and Yang Zaixuan have high talent, especially Swordsman\u2026\u201d\u201cThree months ago, he merely was at the Fourth Level. But now, he is qualified to go through the Seventh Level. In the history of our Dragon Palace, only several people could match with him in terms of the speed of his advancement. I have great hopes for him.\u201d\u201cHowever, we should give them some obstacles. After all, they are still rookies.\u201dHearing this, Su Lie could not help pursing his lips.It was known that he was similar to Jian Wushuang when he joined the Dragon Palace. He did not put other Disciples of Dragon Palace in his eyes. But Palace Master White also asked a powerhouse to let him face some obstacles.He was badly defeated in that battle.He became more humble after that.\u2026In the manor, Jian Wushuang and another three people were drinking, sitting at a stone desk.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m very happy looking at the defeated countenance of Nangong Jie.\u201d Wang Yuan sneered. \u201cHum, he\u2019s arrogant and shameless! He is only at the level of the Profound Gold Core Realm. But he still wanted to vanquish third brother by the consumption of the Spiritual Power. What a foolish man.\u201dJian Wushuang smiled slightly and said, \u201cNangong Jie is not important seeing how he\u2019s not a threat in the future. As for Su Lie, his strength still shocks me until now.\u201d\u201cSo do I.\u201d Yang Zaixuan also nodded. \u201cI thought that the people who could be qualified to be my rival in the whole Dragon Palace was only Bai Cheng. However, it\u2019s not the case now.\u201d\u201cDragon Palace is not as simple as it appears,\u201d Su Rou on the side said with low voice, \u201cI have gone through the Seventh Level, so I know something. Though there are only 16 people that have passed through the Seventh Level, there are many others who have the strength to go through it. But they don\u2019t do it, so nobody knows them.\u201d\u201cI conservatively estimate that there are at least 30 people that have the strength to pass through the Seventh Level, or even the Eighth Level\u2026\u201d\u201cOn the surface, there is only Bai Cheng and your second brother going through the Eighth Level. But in fact, there are at least five people who can complete it. Su Lie is one of those five. Su Lie has reached the level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm a long time ago. So Bai Cheng would be vanquished if they battle, although Bai Cheng\u2019s comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is higher than his.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s what it is. It could be the reason that Bai Cheng seems not to dare to battle Su Lie.\u201d Yang Zaixuan nodded secretly.\u201cWe all look down on Dragon Palace.\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled. \u201cBy the way, what is the Earthly Dragon List Su Lie mentioned?\u201d\u201cI know it,\u201d Wang Yuan said this time.\u201cEarthly Dragon List, set by the Golden-dragon Palace, lists the 100 strongest powerhouses of all experts of the Gold Core Realm in the Tianzong Dynasty.\u201d\u201cIf someone can be listed on Earthly Dragon List, he would stand at the top of pyramid of all those of the Gold Core. All of them could vanquish those at the Primordial Gold Core. The higher rank, the greater the strength. It\u2019s said that the experts ranked at the top 10 of Earthly Dragon List could match or even kill warriors at the level of the Yin-Yang Void Realm!\u201dHearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.Match, even kill the warriors of the Yin-Yang Void Realm?It should be known that the gap between Spiritual Sea Realm and Gold Core was huge. And the gap between Gold Core and Yin-Yang Void Realm was even larger.A warrior of Primordial Golden Pill Realm was like a Monster if he could match with a warrior of Yin-Yang Void Realm. It would be legendary if a warrior of Primordial Gold Core killed a warrior of Yin-Yang Void Realm.\u201cIt\u2019s true. Each powerhouse listed in the top 10 of the Earthly Dragon List has this ability,\u201d Wang Yuan continued saying, \u201cby the way, the Earth Dragon List seems to be at the Secret Pavilion. If you are curious about it, you can swap points for it and read it carefully.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Jian Wushuang left toward the Secret Pavilion without any hesitation.Hearing this, he was filled with ambition to rise on the Earthly Dragon List.Soon after, Jian Wushuang was back. He swapped 100 points for an Earthly Dragon List in the Secret Pavilion.Although it was called a list, it was a thick book.Jian Wushuang opened the first page.\u201cTianzong Dynasty is vast and is filled with talented heroes.\u201d\u201cOver time, old people are replaced by new people. Lots of heroes die and are forgotten. Our Golden-dragon Palace compiles the Earthly Dragon List and the Heavenly Dragon List by recording the heroes in the Tianzong Dynasty.\u201d\u201cEarth Dragon List record the 100 strongest of the Primordial Golden Pill Realm in our Tianzong Dynasty,\u201dJian Wushuang was fascinated. \u201cThere is not only the Earth Dragon List but also the Heavenly Dragon List. The Earthly Dragon List records the experts of the Primordial Gold Core and the Heavenly Dragon List should record those of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.\u201dJian Wushuang kept reading.\u201cThe 100 Superiors of the Golden Pill Realm on the Earthly Dragon List all had outstanding battle results and their strength was recognized by many Sects.\u201d\u201cIf you want to be listed on the Earth Dragon List, you need great battle results.\u201dReading the first page, Jian Wushuang continued reading the second page right now.There were some introductions of the 100 powerhouses listed on the Earth Dragon List on the second page.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She is eccentric and has many enemies. She also excels at marksmanship and has a comprehension of Raging Fire.\u201cA half year ago, by herself, she killed five opponents who had achieved the Exceptional Gold Core Realm at Sunset Ridge over the body of a Spiritual Beast. Two months ago, she beat Mount, the former 100th expert on the List, and replaced him.\u201d\u201cThe 99th on the list is Luo Ao\u2026\u201dJian Wushuang carefully read the introductions and combat abilities of every expert.\u201cThe person who was 94th on the list was surprisingly the Tyrant Su Lie.\u201d\u201cSu Lie.\u201d Jian Wushuang said with surprise.Yang Zaixuan, Wang Yuan and Su Rou beside him came closer.\u201cSu Lie, a bad-tempered disciple of Dragon Palace, was known for his aggression and excellence at Exceptional Gold Core Realm, Raging Fire and brutal Fist Position.\u201d\u201cHe once fought against 13 Gold Core warriors among which 8 achieved the Exceptional Gold Core Realm and killed 11 of them including 7 of the 8. Two survived and he only had a minor injury\u2026.\u201dWhat Jian Wushuang saw really shocked him.Su Lie by himself could unexpectedly kill 11 of the 13 Primordial Gold Core with only two surviving and escaping. It was no wonder that there was a saying that any powerhouse on the list is able to beat a large group of people of Exceptional Gold Core Realm.\u201cSu Lie is really tough,\u201d said Yang Zaixuan seriously.\u201cIt made sense that Bai Cheng dare not fight him,\u201d said Wang Yuan.Jian Wushuang kept reading.The list revealed all the names of powerhouses and their achievements. Jian Wushuang soon read the top five.\u201cThe person who ranked the fifth was Barbarian King Qing Cang, a disciple of Dragon Palace, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cThe fourth was Feng Yutian, who belonged to Gladiator arena, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cThe third was Mu Yingying, a member of the Mu clan, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cThe second was Bai Lichen, a disciple of Dragon Palace, who achieved the peak of Exceptional Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cThe first was Xue Yun from Blood Feather Tower who achieved the Profound Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cXue Yun from Blood Feather Tower,\u201d said Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.\u201cHow could Xue Yun rank first on the list by merely achieving the Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201d Yang Zaixuan and other people wondered.\u201cCheck his combat achievements.\u201dJian Wushuang also saw his achievements.The list read, \u201ca year ago, Bai Lichen, the second on the list, and Barbarian King Qing Cang, the fifth, joined hands to fight Xue Yun outside the imperial palace and this only ended in a draw.\u201dThe description of this was simple but shocked all of them,because the top five on the list could even contend against Yin-Yang Void Realm and yet the two of them against him could only end in a draw.Meanwhile Xue Yun had merely achieved Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201cI now understand why Dragon Palace is reputed as the Cultivation Sanctuary,\u201d said Yang Zaixuan suddenly.\u201cExactly,\u201d nodded Jian Wushuang. 16 of 100 Primordial Gold Core on Earthly Dragon List were Disciples of Dragon Palace and there were even 3 in the top 10.Jian Wushuang could not help but admire how outstanding Dragon Palace was.Among 100 people on the list, there were 16 of Disciples of Dragon Palace, 9 from Gladiator arena and 3 from Blood Feather Tower.Although there were 3 people from Blood Feather Tower on the list, this did not mean that these experts were inferior to those from Gladiator arena. As the tower was an assassins organization, members in it seldom exposed their true abilities and nobody knew if they were able to be placed on the list.Apart from the Three Hegemons, the seven ancient clans of Tianzong Dynasty were home to various talents and more than 10 of them were named on the list.There were also many solitary experts.Among 100 experts on the list were nearly 40 solitary experts.\u201cI have never seen any disciple of Dragon Palace named on the list with the exception of Su Lie.\u201d said Jian Wushuang.\u201cMe neither.\u201d said Wang Yuan.\u201cAs those disciples left the palace long time ago, it is rare to meet them. The palace, however, held regular annual meetings, during which many strong disciples on or off the list would be back.\u201d said Su Rou.\u201cReally?\u201d asked Jian Wushuang with a smile.Right about that time, whoosh, a person in a white robe appeared in the manor.Jian Wushuang and his companions hurried to stand up.\u201cPalace Master White!\u201dThe four people gave a salute to him.\u201cSwordsman and Yang Zaixuan, an expert in the world could only emerge from countless trials and tribulations. As we know this, we assign missions to our disciples at intervals to train them.\u201d said Palace Master White with his hands behind his back.\u201cYou two have been here for 3 months and it is time to receive your first mission.\u201dSaying that, the master produced two beams of light with his hands.Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan took them and saw three minor scrolls.\u201cAs you two are at different stages\u2013one in the Spiritual Sea Realm and the other at Primordial Gold Core, I have assigned you two different missions. But both of your missions have three stages which are already on your scrolls.

He showed how outstanding he was by beating Nangong Jie of Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201cIt seems ridiculous to ask a warrior of Level of Spiritual Sea to achieve that, but actually, it is not too difficult for me. The real arduous one, I thought, was at the second and the third stage because I don\u2019t even know what they are.\u201d said Jian Wushuang with a smile.He was more curious about the tasks at the last two stages. He had scrolls in his hands, but he did not open them in a hurry.\u201cBrother, your first stage mission was simple,\u201d said Jian Wushuang when he had a glance at the scroll inYang Zaixuan\u2019s hands.Yang Zaixuan\u2019s first mission was to kill a warrior of Profound Gold Core Realm who could be killed easily by him, although the warrior was good.\u201cWhen do you plan to set off?\u201d said Yang Zaixuan.\u201cI am going to visit Secret Pavilion and then leave directly. What about you?\u201d said Jian Wushuang.\u201cI will go now.\u201d answered Yang Zaixuan.\u201cGood luck.\u201d said Jian Wushuang and left for Secret Pavilion immediately.With lots of points, he purchased as many Elixir Pills as possible.First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill was worth twenty points, and he surprisingly spent one thousand points buying fifty.He had no alternative. Other people may reach the peak of Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm from Initial Spiritual Sea Realm with the use of ten pills. Jian Wushuang, however, was different, because he needed too much Spiritual Power to support his Ultimate Spiritual Sea. It was questionable whether he would be able to reach Stage Three from Stage Two of Ultimate Spirit Sea.What\u2019s more, he also spent 1,200 points buying pills for treatment.After his preparation, he set off.\u2026The Innumerable Huge Mountains contained hundreds of mountains. The vast space and dangers in it were on another level compared to the Dark Forest.Moon Heart City was located at the foot of Great Mountains.Whoosh! A huge figure dived sharply in the vast place outside the city.That was a big Spiritual Beast, Griffin, with huge wings carrying a man on its back.Jian Wushuang directly jumped off its back and said \u201cThank you\u201d to Golden-armored Sergent.Nodded with a smile, the sergeant left riding the griffin.As the city was very far away from Dragon Palace, it could\u00a0take him over half a month. But now he just spent less than half a day by taking the beast.Of course, he paid 100 points for that.After entering the city, Jian Wushuang went straight to the crowded and noisy Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.When he came to the counter, an old man behind the counter asked, \u201cCan I help you?\u201dJian Wushuang took out the pledge as a Disciple of Dragon Palace, which surprised the man. The man immediately said, \u201cMaster, this way please.\u201dSaying that, the man led him to the cellar.There was a man there who seemed cold. By coincidence he knew Jian Wushuang.\u201cYour Excellency Ye.\u201d said Jian Wushuang with surprise.\u201cSwordsman? I didn\u2019t expect that you were here.\u201d said the cold man with a smile when he saw Jian Wushuang.The man\u2019s name was Ye Rufeng, the Golden Dragon Ambassador, who had actually brought him to Dragon Palace.\u201cHis Excellency, you know each other?\u201d said the old man in confusion.\u201cWe can handle this, you can go.\u201d said Ye Rufeng.\u201cYes, Your Excellency.\u201d the elder immediately retreated.\u201cHaha, nice to see you again, brother.\u201d said Ye Rufeng with a big laugh.\u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a smile.\u201cCome on and have a seat.\u201dAfter sitting on chairs in the cellar, Ye Rufeng asked, \u201cBrother, you were supposed to cultivate in the palace.\u00a0Why did you come here? Did you get mission?\u201dAs a Golden Dragon Ambassador of Golden-dragon Palace, Ye Rufeng knew about the Dragon Palace and understood that their disciples often received assignments from it.\u201cI am on my mission as a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard and the destination was Innumerable Huge Mountains.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cWhat? You are here for a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard mission?\u201d Ye Rufeng asked in shock.\u201cYes, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Jian Wushuang with confusion and he did not know why Ye Rufeng overreacted.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s great, to tell you the truth, we actually were going to ask you to do us a favor.\u201d said Ye Rufeng with a joy.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.He could enter the Palace just because of Ye Rufeng\u2019s recommendation and he owed him. So Jian Wushuang would not decline it if it was not to the death.\u201cFollow me.\u201d said Ye Rufeng and took him to another hidden cellar of the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.There was a girl in purple practicing swordsmanship.Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew!The sword shadow was actually not bad.\u201cShe is\u2026?\u201d asked Jian Wushuang looking at the girl.Although the girl was young, she, with exquisite swordsmanship, reached level of Primordial Gold Core. What most impressed people was that the girl unexpectedly comprehended the level of Waterdrop Essence, although she was not yet high in it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today she accepted a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission in the Gold-Dragon Subsidiary Palace,\u201d Ye Rufeng said.\u201cOh?\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled silently. He immediately understood what Ye Rufeng wanted to request from him.\u201cMei\u2019er, this is Swordsman, a brother of mine. Since you insist on doing the mission, I asked Swordsman to accompany you. That way, he can take care of you on the way,\u201d Ye Rufeng said to Ye Mei.\u201cHim?\u201d Ye Mei looked at Jian Wushuang coldly, and said, \u201cHe is just a warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm. He has not even reached the Primordial Gold Core Realm. It\u2019s not him taking care of me, but me taking care of him!\u201dAn expert of the Gold Core Realm possessed\u00a0a distinctive aura, so one glance was enough for Ye Mei to know that Jian Wushuang did not have a Gold Core.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Brother Swordsman is a disciple of Dragon Palace,\u201d Ye Rufeng replied.\u201cA disciple of Dragon Palace?\u201d Ye Mei was a little bit shocked and gave Jian Wushuang another glance. But what followed was her sneering again before saying, \u201cSo what? Even if he has a lot of talent, he is still only in the Spiritual Sea Realm. If he uses his full strength, he is only the equal of someone in the Initial Gold Core Realm. How is he qualified to take care of me?\u201dNo sooner than the words had been uttered by Ye Mei, she directly left the secret chamber, not even speaking one more word to Jian Wushuang and Ye Rufeng.\u201cShe is\u2026\u201d Ye Rufeng looked a little bit awkward, and then he quickly apologized, \u201d Sorry brother Swordsman, my daughter was very impolite.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Jian Wushuang shook his head and replied. He was not mad at all.\u201cMei\u2019er is such a stubborn and arrogant girl. But, it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Ye Rufeng said, then lightly sighed.\u201cHer mother died when Mei\u2019er was a child. Being her father and a Golden Dragon Messenger, I spent most of my time dealing with public affairs. Because of that, I failed in taking care of her well. Over the years, she has taken care of herself on her own. I guess that helped create her current personality.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded and then asked, \u201cAmbassador Ye, your purpose in coming was just to help her with the mission?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYe Rufeng continued, \u201cMei\u2019er is too arrogant. She is anxious to become a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, but she only achieved the Primordial Gold Core Realm half a month ago. What\u2019s more, the location for the mission is the Innumerable Huge Mountains, which is extremely dangerous on the inside. Considering she could have an accident, I tried to stop her, but she would not listen to me. However, at that time, you arrived.\u201dYe Rufeng looked at Jian Wushuang and pleaded, \u201cBrother Swordsman, since you are going to the Innumerable Huge Mountains for the same mission, I want you to do me a favor and with Mei\u2019er, to watch out for her on the way.\u201d\u201cOkay, no problem.\u201d Jian Wushuang agreed without hesitation.\u201cHa-ha, that is great. I am relieved that I can leave her to you,\u201d Ye Rufeng said with a smile.He knew Jian Wushuang\u2019s strength well. He could easily kill experts in the Initial Gold Core Realm even before he was a disciple of Dragon Palace. Now he had spent time\u00a0in a\u00a0Holy Place for cultivators like Dragon Palace for three months, so his strength should be much greater than before.\u2026The next day. Outside Moon Heart City.The eight people who accepted the Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission had all arrived. Among them, only Jian Wushuang was in the Spiritual Sea Realm. So naturally he stood out from the crowd.\u201cWhy is there a Warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm here?\u201d\u201cWho brought him here?\u201d\u201cTaking a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission with someone in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Is this a joke?\u201dSeveral eyes that were as sharp as a blade glared at Jian Wushuang. A few of them even shouted at him.It\u00a0was common knowledge that Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard missions were extremely risky. Even if they were all in the Primordial Gold Core Realm, the mission would still be quite a challenge. Not to mention now, with someone in the Spiritual Sea\u00a0Realm dragging them down.\u201cHey boy, who allowed you to take this task. Get out of here!\u201d a heavily built man with whiskers howled angrily.Jian Wushuang gave the man a glance and said, \u201cIdiot. Why can\u2019t warriors in the Spiritual Sea Realm accept a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission?\u201d\u201cBoy, what are you talking about?\u201d the whiskered man shouted in rage.\u201cAll right, everybody shut up!\u201d A yell was heard, coming from a black-robed man.The black-robed man was the only Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard among the eight people who were present. He was also the initiator of this mission. While the remaining seven were just One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guards. Among the eight there were obvious disparities in strength. Two\u00a0had achieved the Profound Gold Core Realm,\u00a0including the black-robed man. One was a warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm, which was Jian Wushuang. The other six were all in the Initial Gold Core Realm.\u201cBoy, no matter how you got the Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission, I have to inform you that it\u2019s not a mission that just anyone can easily accomplish. Also, opportunism will not work on this mission,\u201d the black-robed man stared at Jian Wushuang and rumbled.\u201cIn addition, this mission was initiated by me. So I can tell you guys clearly, although you seven accepted the mission simultaneously, only five at most can accomplish the task. That is to say, two of you are doomed to fail this mission.\u201d\u201cAnd you will have to rely on your own strength to decide if you can be one of those five who accomplish the task .\u201dHearing this, everybody present looked serious, except for Jian Wushuang.\u201cDid you hear that, boy? Only five can accomplish the task. You are only at the Spiritual Sea Realm. Do you think you can accomplish the mission? How ridiculous!\u201d the heavily built man with whiskers shouted and sneered.\u201cIt\u2019s not something you get to decide!\u201d Jian Wushuang replied, without even giving him a glance.\u201cHem, what an arrogant boy. Just wait, you will have your chance to be arrogant once the mission begins,\u201d the whiskery man said coldly.\u201cIf everybody is ready, then let\u2019s go.\u201d No sooner than the black robe man uttered this, the eight warriors left for the Innumerable Huge Mountains.On the way, the purple-clothed lady, Ye Mei, walked up to Jian Wushuang.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I don\u2019t need anyone to take care of me?\u201d Ye Mei whispered.\u201cI owe your father a favor. What\u2019s more, I am also taking this mission, so I just have to watch out for you at my convenience,\u201d Jian Wushuang replied.\u201cWith only your strength? You should give priority to your\u00a0own safety, since I don\u2019t want you to run to me once you are in danger,\u201d Ye Mei said, then sneered.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If I was in danger, then you would have already died long before that,\u201d Jian Wushuang said.Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, Ye Mei half closed her eyes. Her dislike for Jian Wushuang grew stronger.\u201cI can not believe that the legendary disciples in Dragon Palace are as arrogant as you.\u201dHaving finished her words, Ye Mei quickened her pace and glided ahead of Jian Wushuang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And apparently, these Spiritual Beasts were much stronger than those in the Dark Forest,Likewise, the Innumerable Huge Mountains are much more dangerous than the Dark Forest.A sudden loud thump disturbed the tranquility of the forest.Peng!Following that, a human could be heard laughing before he said, \u201cHaha, just a Spiritual Beast in the Initial Gold Core Realm. You were doomed the second you met me!\u201d\u201cTai Shan, don\u2019t waste your time, let\u2019s keep going.\u201d A black-robed man, the leader, said in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d said Tai Shan, a strong man with a big mustache,\u00a0laughing while holding a Spirit Beast Core in his hand.Every Spirit Beast in the Gold Core Realm has Beast Core that is very valuable.It had been two days since the eight of them had entered the Innumerable Huge Mountains, so they knew very little about each other. But, they at least knew each other\u2019s names. The two men leading them were strongest, having reached the Profound Gold Core Realm. The black-robed man was known as Ba Yan. As for the other, he was called Tai Shan. He was a burly man with a big mustache, who liked to argue with Jian Wushuang.The eight continued to move forward, deeper into the Innumerable Huge Mountains. But a short while later, they suddenly halted on a treetop.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThey stood on the treetop and looked down.There were many dead bodies laying parallel to each other, spread out on the ground.\u201cLet\u2019s check the area,\u201d said Ba Yan. Following his words, everyone went down to the ground, carefully checking the bodies.Jian Wushuang also approached one of the dead bodies.\u201cThis is\u2026 A sword scar?\u201d Seeing the deadly scar on the neck of the dead body, Jian Wushuang became alert.Apparently, the scar was not caused by a Spirit Beast, but a sword.Thus, Jian Wushuang looked around and noticed that they all died the same way. Nothing but a sword scar was found on each one of them.\u201cthey were killed in one move, without a chance to fight back. Whoever did this was much stronger than them,\u201d Jin Wushuang said with a dark expression.\u201cThese people\u2026 \u201d Yin Min also looked, while feeling overwhelmed.\u201cThey were killed\u00a0by a human hand, and probably all by the same one.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cHuman?\u201d Ye Mei changed her look all of a sudden.\u201cThey have not been dead for long, which means that the killers might still be in the area.\u201dJian Wushuang checked the bloodstains on the dead bodies once again. It was obvious that they were killed just minutes ago because the bloodstains were not dry yet. Besides that, there were so many Spirit Beasts in Innumerable Huge Mountains. If they had been dead for long, their bodies should have been eaten by those Spirit Beasts already. In which case they would no longer be completely intact.\u201cAll of you need to be careful. Spirit Beasts are not the most dangerous threat here. Other humans can be even more dangerous,\u201d Ba Yan said with a serious look.Everyone nodded. They all knew that human beings are more dangerous than Spirit Beasts since this was not the first time that they had accepted a mission from the Golden Dragon Guard.\u201cCaptain Ba Yan, you are being too paranoid. Look at the people who were killed. Only four of them reached the Initial Gold Core Realm, while the rest were merely in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Now look at our group. We are much stronger than them, aren\u2019t we? They won\u2019t have the guts to mess with us,\u201d said Tai Shan, in a disapproving tone.\u201cJust be careful, anyway. \u201d Ba Yan said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201dThus, the eight continued their journey. Finally, half a day later, they arrived at the destination.In front of them was a thick mountain forest.\u201cAlright, now I can tell you what the specific mission is.\u201d Ba Yan looked at the seven people and said seriously, \u201cIn the forest in front of us, there are two Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns. I accidentally saw them while passing through here previously.\u201d\u201cThe Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns has a coarse appearance. Both its skin and bones are excellent materials for making weapons, not to mention the golden horns. On top of that, its Core is also quite valuable. Its whole body is a treasure. That\u2019s why I set up the mission at the Golden Dragon Palace. All you need to do is help me kill the two Beasts.\u201dEveryone became alert.\u201cA Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns?\u201d\u201cHow many gold horns do they have?\u201dSomeone quickly asked.For Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns, the more horns they have, the more powerful they are!\u201cOne has three golden horns and the other has two, so they are absolutely within our ability. As for the requirement for completing the mission, that would be obtaining a golden horn. However, there are only 5 golden horns altogether.After hearing that, all seven of them had a strange look on their faces.The Blue-eyed Beast with three Golden Horns is the most powerful among Spirit Beasts in the Profound Gold Core Realm. Normal warriors in the Profound Gold Core Realm cannot match up to it at all. By comparison, the one with two horns is less powerful, but it could still fight on even terms with a human in the Profound Gold Core Realm.With their current group, it would be easy to deal with the two Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns. There was only one problem. Seven people accepted the mission, but there were not enough horns for everyone to complete the mission.Seven people wanted to obtain the five golden horns, which meant two of them were doomed to fail this mission. As for who would finish and who fail, Ba Yan didn\u2019t say a word because everyone understood it would depend on how capable they were.\u201cAlthough the Two Clawed missions are not as cruel as the One-Clawed missions, it is still full of danger. Seven people and five golden horn. Eventually, there will be a deadly struggle to decide who succeeds.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought secretly.\u201cThey are in the same forest, but the forest is big, and they don\u2019t always stay together. However, once one of them is in danger, the other will immediately come. So we have to split up.\u201d Ba Yan began to make the arrangements.\u201cEveryone, listen up. Tai Shan, Wang Chong, Lin Yu, and I will deal with the three-horned beast. The rest of you\u2026 \u201d Ba Yan looked at the other four and said, \u201cYou four are not as powerful, but you can still deal with the two-horned beast. After you finish, you are free to decide who gets the horns. What do you say?\u201d\u201cOk, not a problem,\u201d Tai Shan said and smiled.\u201cI agree.\u201d Wang Chong and Lin Yu also nodded.Tai Shan. Wang Chong and Lin Yu agreed without any hesitation, because they knew they can finish the mission by killing the Blue-eyed Beast with Three Golden Horns and get three golden horns, and distribute them evenly.But the rest four of them didn\u2019t look well except Jian Wushuang, because they knew that only two golden horns would be gained after killing the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, which means that two of them are doomed to fail this mission.They are reluctant to do this, but they have to. After all, they are not powerful enough in terms of their Cultivation of Spiritual Power.\u201cSince you all agreed, it\u2019s settled then, here we go.\u201d Ba Ya said, and the eight soon divided into two groups, moving toward the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With one using an axe while the other used a long spear, they launch a powerful attack toward the incoming Blue-eyed Rhino.Jian Wushuang also immediately launched an attack with his sword, releasing power equivalent to the Initial Gold Core Realm.Among them, Ye Mei seemed to be the strongest.Swish!As she attacked, a streak of sword shadow using Waterdrop Sword Essence slashed towards the Blue-eyed Rhino. Before landing on its body, the sword shadow split into three dazzling streaks of sword light.\u201cimpressive swordsmanship.\u201d The indigo-robed man exclaimed.Jian Wushuang frowned and shook his head, \u201cHer swordsmanship is good, but she is too naive and hasty.\u201dJian Wushuang understood clearly, killing the Blue-eyed Rhino was not a problem. The real issue was the fight over the two horns. However, since Ye Mei showed her strength already, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man would be cautious around Ye Mei.Jian Wushuang noticed that the indigo-robed man seemed to be shocked by Ye Mei. In fact, both of them had a weird look in their eyes. Jian Wushuang immediately knew that as soon as the Blue-eyed Rhino was dead both men would work together and launch a sneak attack on Ye Mei for the sake of acquiring the horns.Clang! Clang! Clang!Although the attack landed on the Blue-eyed Rhino\u2019s body, only three white marks were left behind on its hard shell.\u201cThe shell is too hard. Aim for the stomach, it should be softer and it\u2019s not protected by the shell.\u201d Jian Wushuang shouted.\u201cI do not need your advice.\u201d Ye Mei glanced at him before launching an attack towards the Blue-eyed Rhino\u2019s belly.\u201cHowl!\u201dAs the Blue-eyed Rhino roared, It stomped on the ground with its hooves, causing the ground to\u00a0tremble.\u00a0Then it lowered its head, pointing the two horns at Ye Mei, and attacked.It charged straight towards Ye Mei with its golden horns.But, it was so big and awkward, Ye Mei easily moved around it and let it pass.\u201cKill it quickly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s trying to run away.\u201dThe indigo-robed man was attacking as he exclaimed happily.Although the Blue-eyed Rhino had great defense, it was still just a beast. Jian Wushuang and the others worked together to attack it. In particular, Ye Mei aggressively attacked the beast\u2019s belly. As a result, the Blue-eyed Rhino had already reached its limit.\u201cIt is going to die.\u201d Ye Mei had a delighted look on her face, but she still felt contempt towards Jian Wushuang.She had played the biggest part in killing this Blue-eyed Rhino. Of course, the other three did work together and assist her. But Jian Wushuang only helped to prevent the beast from escaping, so it wasn\u2019t odd that she felt contempt towards him.\u201cWith this level of strength, you thought you could help me?\u201d Ye Mei thought.But at this moment\u2026a violently rampaging Spiritual Power appeared as a two-meter tall figure jumped out of the forest.\u201cNot good!\u201d\u201cAnother beast?\u201d\u201d It\u2019s a\u2026 Herculean Demonic Monkey!\u201d\u201cProfound Gold Core Realm!\u201dYe Mei and the indigo-robed man were shocked when it appeared, causing their expressions to become slightly pale.Even a normal Herculean Demonic Monkey is powerful, let alone this one, which is in the Profound Gold Core Realm.The Herculean Demonic Monkey, in the Profound Gold Core Realm, was stronger than them since they were in the Initial Gold Core Realm.\u201cThis is a catastrophe.\u201d Ye Mei\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cYou three should finish killing the Blue-eyed Rhino. I will deal with the Herculean Demonic Monkey.\u201d Jian Wushaung said in a deep voice.\u201cYou?\u201d When Ye Mei looked towards Jian Wushuang, he had already rushed towards the Herculean Demonic Monkey.\u201cA Herculean Demonic Monkey at the Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled, releasing a strong Spiritual Power that surpassed the Spiritual Sea Realm. At the same time, a massive amount of Earth Sword-Essence began to fill the area.\u201cThe seventh move of the Formless Sword Wave .\u201dAs he shouted, his Triple-kill Sword moved to attack the beast.Countless sword shadows gathered together to form an immensely heavy mountain, which began descending towards Herculean Demonic Monkey.\u201cDamn humans.\u201dThe Herculean Demonic Monkey\u2019s eyes turned red as it launched an attack that seemed to be able to shatter Heaven and Earth.Ye Mei and the indigo-robed man were shocked when they saw this.\u201cThat guy, does he want to die?\u201d\u201cWith his strength, he shouldn\u2019t even be able to defend against a Herculean Demonic Monkey in the Profound Gold Core Realm. Yet, He dared to attack it head-on. He must want to die.\u201d\u201cStupid!\u201d Ye Mei cursed him.Herculean Demonic Monkeys were known for their\u00a0strength. Even if a warrior in the same Realm was fighting with it, they would be careful and would avoid facing its strength head-on power. Let alone, Jian Wushuang, who was only in the Spiritual Sea Realm.He must be crazy!Ye Mei and the indigo-robed man thought Jian Wushuang had lost his mind.What happened next surprised all three of them.Boom!When they saw what happened, they were shocked by Jian Wushuang. The beast, which reached the Profound Gold Core Realm, flew out like a bullet, smashing into a tree that was more than ten meters behind it.Boom!The tree, unable to withstand the impact from the Herculean Demonic Monkey, was smashed to pieces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As a result, would the Herculean Demonic Monkey decide to escape?\u201cQuick, kill the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns.\u201dAfter a brief shock, the indigo-robed man reacted first and shouted loudly.Ye Mei was startled and the harsh light in her eyes flashed. Wow! The sword light roared out instantly with astonishing power. Her strength at the moment erupted to the extreme.She did not know how long Jian Wushuang could delay the Herculean Demonic Monkey, so she had to battle quickly to force an outcome.\u201cGo to hell!\u201d The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man also shot out at full force at the moment.As their power was unleashed, the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns who had already been pushed to the limit, immediately lost its struggle and was killed directly.When the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns died, the two golden horns on its foreheads immediately became the target.\u201cGolden Horns.\u201d Ye Mei rolled her eyes and went towards the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns.\u201cGrab them quickly.\u201d The indigo-robed man suddenly burst out shouting, followed by a sound of humming and a towering Axe Shadow chopped towards Ye Mei suddenly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ye Mei was shocked and quickly wielded her sword to resist. As the Axe Shadow heavily hit on her long sword, Ye Mei backed sharply.\u201cHa ha!\u201dWhen the laughter sounded and Ye Mei was retreating, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man rushed to the dead body of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns immediately. Then they removed the two golden horns of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns with giant axes. After four blows in succession, they finally detached the two golden horns.Two golden horns immediately fell into the hands of the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man.\u201cYou two.\u201d Ye Mei armed with a longsword, glared at the two men in front of her with fury in her eyes.\u201cAll is fair in war, little girl. Thank you for killing the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, but these two golden horns belong to us.\u201d The indigo-robed man smiled.\u201cBastard.\u201d Ye Mei was becoming more furious. There was a towering aura surrounding her with signs that it would erupt.\u201cWhat? Do you want to fight?\u201d The indigo-robed man grinned, and next to him, the purple-haired middle-aged man also stared at Ye Mei icily.If it was one-for-one, he knew that neither of them was an opponent of Ye Mei, but by teaming up, they would have no fear.\u201cHo-ho, two strong men attacking a little girl. Don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201d A light voice suddenly sounded.The facial expression of the indigo-robed man and purple-haired middle-aged man both changed, and they quickly looked towards the source of the voice.At the side, Jian Wushuang, armed with his Triple-kill Sword, was surrounded by overwhelming sword essences. As for the Mighty Demonic Monkey, which frightened them when they heard of it, it was lying at the feet of Jian Wushuang unmoving. A bloody hole was in its chest with streams of blood flowing out.This scene made both the indigo-robed man and the\u00a0purple-haired middle-aged man inhale sharply.\u201cThe Herculean Demonic Monkey, is dead!\u201d Ye Mei was also astonished.After watching Jian Wushuang fighting with the Herculean Demonic Monkey and hacking it to death with one sword stroke, they had already been shocked, but now\u2026It was dead!The Herculean Demonic Monkey could not be dead.Since Jian Wushuang began his fight with the Mighty Demonic Monkey, it had only been a few minutes. It was during those few minutes that the Mighty Demonic Monkey had been killed.What was happening?Were they dreaming?The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man were a little confused. Even Ye Mei, who knew Jian Wushuang\u2019s real identity, was still extremely shocked.At the same time, she finally understood why her father asked Jian Wushuang to take care of her.She had looked down on Jian Wushuang before, thinking that disciples of Dragon Palace were useless.But now she knew how foolish she was.They were shocked, but Jian Wushuang was very calm without any exultation. After all, he was a disciple of Dragon Palace.Disciples of Dragon Palace were all super talents. They were all weirdos. But he was the weirdest among them because he could defeat Nangong Jie after he had joined the Dragon Palace for only three months. Besides, he cultivated such a defiant cultivation tactic as the Heavenly Creation Skill\u2026\u201cAlthough the Herculean Demonic Monkey\u2019s power is extremely high, it only had brute force. The power I used through the Heavenly Creation Skill is only at the Level of the ordinary Initial Gold Core Realm, but my swordsmanship and sword essence are very high. Depending on the power of the Formless Sword Wave and the swordsmanship power to fight with it directly, I had an absolute advantage. In other respects, I have a significant edge. It was an easy kill.\u201d Jian Wushuang did not take it too seriously.Catching a glimpse of the remains of the Herculean Demonic Monkey, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and put the remains of the Mighty Demonic Monkey into the Interspatial Ring, and then Jian Wushuang looked at the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man again.\u201cDuring the killing of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, Ye Mei and I contribute the most. But the two most important gold horns belong to you two whose contributions are the least. That\u2019s not fair, is it?\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a light smile.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man were staring at Jian Wushuang fearfully.They thought Jian Wushuang would be entangled with the Herculean Demonic Monkey for a long time and had no time to think about him, so they grabbed the two gold horns quickly. They had never dreamed that Jian Wushuang would kill the Herculean Demonic Monkey in only a few minutes.\u201cTake out the two golden horns, and I can ignore what happened just now.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man were displeased and looked at each other. Then the indigo-robed man nodded and said, \u201cOK, we will take them out.\u201dHearing this, Ye Mei breathed with a relief.However, suddenly\u2026\u201cRun.\u201d The indigo-robed man shouted lowly and the purple-haired middle-aged man leaped up immediately.Both of them were very clear that the condition for the completion of this mission was exactly the two gold horns. As long as they could escape and flee to the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace, even without the witness of their team leader Ba Yan, they could complete this Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard mission with these two gold horns.But once they moved and acted, an icy sword light immediately whistled out.Whoosh! Whoosh!The sword light whistled slightly, skimming directly onto these two men\u2019s faces.The indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man stopped their paces at once. They were shocked, feeling their faces turn cold. They subconsciously touching their faces and felt a stream of scalding blood.At the same time, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of them suddenly, and the icy voice passed slowly into their ears.\u201cThe stroke just now only left a sword mark on your faces, but the next one, will cut your throats.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They trembled and experienced great fear, after they saw a death-like smile on Jian Wushuang\u2019s lips.\u201cI will hand\u2026 I will hand\u00a0over the golden horn.\u201d The indigo-robed man trembled and tossed the golden horn to Jian Wushuang immediately.\u201cMe too.\u201d The purple-haired middle-aged man also handed over his golden horn.Taking the golden horn, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, \u201cYou are not foolish men.\u201dAfter speaking, Jian Wushuang walked toward Ye Mei with a flicker. Jian Wushuang handed over a golden horn to her and said, \u201cThis is yours.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Ye Mei was still confused.\u201cYou deserve it because of your contribution while killing the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.After hesitating a while, Ye Mei ground her teeth and took the golden horn. She mumbled, \u201cThank you!\u201dAfter shrugging his shoulders, Jian Wushuang said quietly, \u201cYe Mei. For your father\u2019s sake, I remind you that you\u2019d better not trust anyone even if he is your partner because many have incomprehensible hearts. You will meet many as you travel the world.\u201dAfter being slightly startled, Ye Mei looked at the indigo-robed man beside her and the purple-haired middle-aged man and subsequently nodded.\u201cIs it already over?\u201d While a loud booming voice, the black-robed man Ba Yan walked out from the forest.\u201cCaptain Ba Yan.\u201dJian Wushuang and others looked at the black-robed man.Seeing the corpse of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, a satisfied smile emerged on Ba Yan\u2019s face. Ba Yan waved his hands to put the corpse into the Interspatial Ring.Ba Yan only knew that Jian Wushuang together with three people killed the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, but did not know what happened here a moment ago nor the existence of the Herculean Demonic Monkey. Jian Wushuang had already put the corpse of the Herculean Demonic Monkey into his Interspatial Ring.\u201cWho got the two golden horns?\u201d Ba Yan asked curiously.After hearing that, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man\u2019s expression were depressed. However, Jian Wushuang smiled and said, \u201cYe Mei got one. So did I, with good luck.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The countenance of Ba Yan grew odd.He did not expect that Ye Mei obtained one golden horn. After all, Ye Mei was in the Initial Gold Core Realm of Jindan and her strength was not weak.But Jian Wushuang\u2026Only in the Spiritual Sea Realm, Jian Wushuang could obtain one golden horn?Ba Yan couldn\u2019t help but look at the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man. He found that they stood there with reticence and sporadically looked at Jian Wushuang with gazes filled with dense fear.\u201cThese two men\u2026\u201d Ba Yan, an experienced person, understood the two men\u2019s gazes. Based on this, Ba Yan was more curious.What happened? I feel the fear from the two men towards Swordsman.After all, Swordsman is only in the Spiritual Sea Realm, but they are all in the Primordial Gold Core!Although Ba Yan was curious, he did not ask.\u201cNow that the two golden horns have been distributed, we should move to meet Tai Shan immediately. The strength of the three Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns was high, so we expended more effect to kill them. Now, Tai Shan and the two others are recovering their Spiritual Power.\u201d Ba Yan smiled and said.\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.Several people walked toward another battlefield.\u2026In the mountain forest.\u201cSwordsman, could you tell me what happened a moment ago? Why do I feel that the two men are afraid of you?\u201d After glancing at the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man, Ba Yan asked discreetly.\u201cCaptain Ba Yan, I have said that it was due to luck.\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled and did not want to explain much.\u201cForget it if you don\u2019t want to say.\u201d Ba Yan smirked. \u201cMy aim is the two corpses of the Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns. As for who could succeed in the mission, it does not matter much to me.\u201dJian Wushuang smiled silently. He found that the attitude from Ba Yan towards him had improved.At this moment\u2026\u201cCome out!\u201d\u201cSon of a b*tch. Do you dare to battle me directly?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dHearing a salvo of hysterical and furious roars from up ahead, Jian Wushuang and other people were startled.\u201cSomething has happened.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cThe voice belongs to Tai Shan!\u201d Ba Yan frowned. \u201cHurry up! Hurry up!\u201dThe five men accelerated their speed and dashed up ahead as quickly as possible. Soon after, they arrived at a desolate war-torn land.In the center of this land, a bearded strong man was clasping a big bronze saber. He stared around appearing flushed, and roared furiously continuously.Around the bearded strong man, there were two cold corpses.\u201cWang Chong? Lin Yu?\u201dAfter seeing the two corpses, Jian Wushuang, and the others changed their expression.The two corpses were their partners. They had worked together with Ba Yan and Tai Shan to kill the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns ago. Subsequently, Wang Chong, Lin Yu, and Tai Shan had stayed there to recover their spiritual power. Meanwhile, Ba Yan had been looking for Jian Wushuang and his three companions.However, it was beyond their expectation that the two people had actually died before Ba Yan could lead Jian Wushuang and his companions over.\u201cTai Shan. What happened?\u201d Ba Yan walked toward Tai Shan.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Tai Shan still flushed with his veins bulging on his forehead. Furthermore, a trace of fear was in his eyes.\u201cWe are being observed by someone.\u201d Jian Wushuang suddenly said.\u201cAh?\u201d Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang.\u201cLook at their wounds.\u201d Jian Wushuang pointed to the two corpses of Wang Chong and Lin Yu.There was only one scar on the whole corpse. The scar was located at their necks and the was an obvious sword scar.\u201cDeath with a single blow. They had no chance to retaliate. It\u2019s similar to the corpses on the road which we passed by earlier.\u201d Jian Wushuang spoke softly.\u201cIt\u2019s him?\u201d The countenance of everyone fell, after hearing what Jian Wushuang said.In fact, they didn\u2019t know who he was. However, they had seen numerous corpses by the road. Those people were killed by a single harsh blow.\u201cHe might be close by.\u201d Jian Wushuang only saw tall trees and could not identify where the man was hiding.\u201cDoes he regard us as prey?\u201d Ye Mei whispered.\u201cVery likely.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.In the Innumerable Huge Mountains, not only was it useful to hunt spirit beasts, but also hunting humans. Hunting humans was even more profitable.A man in a silver robe stood in a treetop adjacent to the barren land. Cloaked by leaves, he could see what Jian Wushuang and his companions were doing, but his targets could not see him.Two people in the Profound Gold Core Realm. Three people in the Initial Gold Core Realm. And a man at Spiritual Sea Realm. All of them are the Golden-dragon Guard!This looks interesting. Let me play with you.The man in the silver robe tilted his lips and smiled coldly after observing the worried expression on Ba Yan and others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You should tell us the details,\u201d Ba Yan said.\u201cWang Chong, Lin Yu, and I were recovering our Spiritual Power because it had been greatly consumed after battling the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns. Suddenly, Wang Chong screamed miserably. When I turned to look at him, he had been killed,\u201d Tai Shan said with a muffled voice.\u201cAfter the death of Wang Chong, Lin Yu and I became vigilant immediately. But, what was unexpected was that a few seconds later, Lin Yu was also killed in my presence. Even I couldn\u2019t see how the assassin did it.\u201dHearing that, everyone\u2019s expression became very somber.\u201cDo you know his appearance and his Cultivation of Spiritual Power?\u201d Ba Yan continued asking.\u201cNo.\u201d Tai Shan shook his head.\u201cYou are a man in the Profound Gold Core Realm. How could you not know the man\u2019s Cultivation of Spiritual Power?\u201d Ye Mei could not help excoriating him.\u201cI said that I couldn\u2019t see him. His speed was amazing. When I was able to perceive him, he had already fleeted off into the mountain forest,\u201d Tai Shan exclaimed in a low voice.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Mei wanted to say something.\u201cOkay. Please stop.\u201d Ba Yan waved his hands, and then looked around, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the man is still around and targeting us or has left.\u201d\u201cHe could have left.\u201d An indigo-robed man could not help saying.The deaths of Wang Chong and Lin Yu could induce grief from other people. But, to the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man, their deaths could only induce delight. That was because the golden horns were left and the two of them could succeed in the mission of the Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard now that they had died.\u201cHaha. Thanks to the Powerhouse who killed Wang Chong and Lin Yu, I can obtain the golden horns and then succeed in the mission, \u201d the indigo-robed man laughed secretly.Suddenly\u2026 a Ghost-like figure approached him, followed by a sword shadow that swept directly toward his neck.Too fast! Too sudden!The people around him perceived nothing, barring Jian Wushuang, who swerved his head at this moment.In the next moment, the sword shadow directly cut the indigo-robed man\u2019s neck.\u201cWhat?\u201d The indigo-robed man\u2019s life was dissipating as he goggled from the pain in his neck. The Ghost-like figure faded into the nearby forest.\u201cThud!\u201dThe corpse of the indigo-robed man fell to the ground with a muffled sound.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dNo one around noticed what had happened until now and they were all startled.\u201cIt\u2019s him. It\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave. He is still nearby,\u201d Tai Shan roared, filled with terror.The countenances of Ba Yan, Ye Mei, and the purple-haired middle-aged man became ghostly pale at that moment.Before, they had not thought that it was terrifying, even though they had heard Tai Shan\u2019s narrative about his prior experience. But now, they had witnessed it for themselves.The indigo-robed man had been with them and was killed right under their noses. Nevertheless, they could not see any trace of the adversary.They did not even know whether it was a human or a ghost who had killed the indigo-robed man.Just then, a feeling of terror emerged from the bottom of everyone\u2019s heart,except for the fearless Jian Wushuang, who wore an odd expression.Jian Wushuang had witnessed the scene, but Ba Yan and Tai Shan, who were in the Profound Gold Core Realm, did not see it. However, because of what he saw, he felt strange.A warrior in silver who is in the Profound Gold Core Realm?\u201cHis Cultivation of Spiritual Power is in the Profound Gold Core Realm and the strength that I sensed is not very strong. However, his speed is very fast and his movements are very flexible. Moreover, he has a good method of assassination,\u201d Jian Wushuang thought secretly.Regarding the assassination method, he had first thought of the killers from the Blood Feather Tower. However, the killers from the Blood Feather Tower dressed in masks and black robes, which was different from the warrior in silver.\u201cThe actual strength of that man is probably not comparable to Ba Yan. However, his cloaked assassination terrifies Ba Yan and Tai Shan, who are in the Profound Gold Core Realm. It\u2019s a wise method.\u201d Jian Wushuang tilted his lips slightly.Jian Wushuang was not afraid of the warrior in silver after learning something about him.But the other people were still in fear.\u201cWho are you? What kind of hatred do you have for us? Why did you pick us?\u201d Looking around unceasingly, Ba Yan spread his voice with a cold expression.Behind a nearby tree, the warrior in silver\u2019s cold smile bloomed upon hearing that.\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d The warrior in silver looked straight ahead.At this moment, the eight-person group of Ba Yan had only five people left.The five people were: Ba Yan and Tai Shan, who were in the Profound Gold Core Realm;Ye Mei and the purple-haired middle-aged man, who were in the Initial Gold Core Realm;and Jian Wushuang, who was in the Level of Spiritual Sea.\u201cThe warriors who are in the Profound Gold Core Realm are a bit hard to kill. Therefore, I must kill those two people last.\u201d The warrior in silver looked at Ba Yan and Tai Shan, shaking his head. And then he looked at Jian Wushuang.That Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior. He is too weak to motivate me to kill him.Okay. The two remaining warriors are in the Initial Gold Core Realm.The warrior in silver stared at Ye Mei and the purple-haired middle-aged man and then made a decision.\u201cI\u2019ll choose her.\u201d The gaze from the warrior in silver was locked on Ye Mei. A few seconds later, he silently approached her.In the center of the mountain forest, Ba Yan and the others had already become greatly frightened.\u201cWatch out! Pay attention to the surroundings,\u201d Ba Yan said in a muffled voice.The five living people all wore somber expressions, except for Jian Wushuang.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dA supersonic noise resounded, followed by a silver figure suddenly bursting out of the nearby forest.His movements and appearance were just like a Ghost\u2019s. His speed was stupendous. In a flash, he was right in front of Ye Mei.\u201cWatch out!\u201d Ba Yan first cried out, but it was too late to rescue her.\u201cEscape!\u201d Tai Shan also roared.\u201cWhat?\u201d Immediately, Ye Mei\u2019s dark pupils shrank\u00a0as her hair stood on end. An outburst of astonishing killing intent enveloped her when the Ghost-like figure appeared in front of her.At that moment, Ye Mei was fraught with dense terror.She was too frightened to resist it.\u201cHaha. Another one.\u201d After seeing that, the warrior in silver grinned. His Purple Soft Sword lightly stabbed toward Ye Mei\u2019s neck.Suddenly\u2026\u201cSwoosh!\u201dA cold sword light silently chopped toward him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked in disbelief at the sword light that had suddenly appeared.\u201cIt\u2019s him?\u201d The warrior in silver also recognized who had executed that move.Was it that Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea, whom he had paid no attention to and regarded boring to kill?Yes, it was exactly that Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea. When everyone around, even including Ye Mei herself, did not realize what was happening, Jian Wushuang had clearly seen the warrior in silver\u2019s figure and cleaved toward him.\u201cThis sword light\u2026\u201d A flicker of fear appeared in the warrior in silver\u2019s eyes.The sword light was too fast, even much faster than what he could execute with his full power. It was too fast for him to defend. In the next instant, the sword had directly roared past right in front of him.\u201cAh!\u201dThe warrior in silver immediately let out a sad and painful cry, looking at his right hand with astonishment. Actually, that sword light had directly chopped half of his palm off as streams of blood wildly burst out.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe several people around also witnessed what had happened. They finally were able to clearly see the warrior in silver\u2019s figure, as well as his palm chopped in half and the Purple Soft Sword that had dropped on the ground.At that moment, everyone stopped breathing.\u201cRun!\u201dWith half of his palm chopped off, the warrior in silver\u2019s face twisted with great pain, but he still remained a little sober. Instead of picking up the chopped off half-palm and that Purple Soft Sword, he rushed out and escaped.He clearly knew that what he was most versed in were assassination and high speed. As for face-to-face slaughter, either Ba Yan or Tai Shan, who were both in the Profound Gold Core Realm, could beat him single-handedly. Hence, once his figure was seen, he had to leave immediately. What was worse was that his right hand was crippled now, and his battle strength was largely reduced.\u201cAs long as all of you have come, then stay here.\u201dA floating voice was passed into the warrior in silver\u2019s ears when his complexion sharply changed.\u201cShua!\u201dThe icy Sword Edge directly penetrated through the warrior in silver\u2019s chest from the back, with its edge passing right through the entire heart.The third movement of Formless Swordsmanship\u2026 Expeditious Maneuver!The warrior in silver just felt a little sweetness in his throat. In the next instant, a gush of blood spurted from his mouth, before his body slowly slumped down to the ground.Even when he died, he could not believe that he would die at the hand of a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea.After killing the warrior in silver, Jian Wushuang put the Triple-kill Sword back into its sheath. Then, he bent over to pick up the warrior in silver\u2019s Ring of Heaven and Earth and that Purple Soft Sword from the ground before turning around to look at Ba Yan and the others.As soon as he turned around, Jian Wushuang found that all of Ba Yan, Tai Shan, Ye Mei, and that purple-haired middle-aged man were staring at him with shocked faces.\u201cSwordsman, you\u2026 you killed him?\u201d Ba Yan said in astonishment.\u201cShould I not try to kill him and wait for him to kill you one by one?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked in return.Both Ba Yan and Tai Shan looked at Jian Wushuang in a different way.Like Tai Shan, he did not regard Jian Wushuang as somebody at all before this. In his view, a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea trying to complete the task of the Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard meant that he was pursuing death. He had even quarreled with Jian Wushuang. But now\u2026 Tai Shan absolutely could not look down upon Jian Wushuang. Instead, he felt deep fear toward him from the bottom of his heart.Yes, it was fear.After all, that warrior in silver had killed three of his companions in front of him, but he did not even see the shadow of their opponent. However, Jian Wushuang did directly slaughter that warrior in silver.Having witnessed such strength, how could he stand there with no fear?As for Ye Mei and that purple-haired middle-aged man, they had seen before that Jian Wushuang killed the Herculean Demonic Monkey in the Profound Gold Core Realm in just a moment, so they had known that Jian Wushuang\u2019s strength was very horrifying. Yet, when they saw Jian Wushuang so easily slaughter that warrior in silver, they still felt extremely shocked.\u201cSwordsman, thank you!\u201d Ye Mei earnestly stared at Jian Wushuang and expressed her gratitude.Just now, that warrior in silver had aimed to kill her, which she knew very clearly. If Jian Wushuang had not saved her in time, she would be dead now.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Anyway, we are companions. Of course I can\u2019t watch you be killed,\u201d Jian Wushang casually answered.Ye Mei nodded slightly. Although Jian Wushuang seemed to be very casual, she had remembered his kind help.\u201cAll right. The guy who was in our way has been killed. Captain Ba Yan, let\u2019s continue ahead,\u201d said Jian Wushuang.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ba Yan was stunned before grasping his words. Then, he nodded in a hurry, saying, \u201cAll right, all right. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\u2026At night, on a hill, Ba Yan and the other several people were gathering in front of a fire.\u201cHow could it be? That man was only in the Profound Gold Core Realm with not very powerful strength. He was just relatively good at assassination. If I fought against him face-to-face, maybe I could have beaten him.\u201d Tai Shan\u2019s voice was very solid.\u201cHumph, what a shame! Anyway, you are an expert in the Profound Gold Core Realm, but couldn\u2019t see his Cultivation of Spiritual Power!\u201d Ba Yan sneered.\u201cThat\u2019s all due to that guy\u2019s high speed!\u201d Tai Shan curled his lip and then said, \u201cYet, Brother Swordsman is really awesome. He\u2019s only in the Spiritual Sea Realm, but he so easily killed a warrior in the Primordial Gold Core?\u201dAfter knowing Jian Wushuang\u2019s real strength, Tai Shan was not proud at all in front of Jian Wushuang.\u201cReally awesome!\u201d Ba Yan also praised him. \u201cSuch an excellent Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior can\u2019t be an ordinary person. In my opinion, he must possess a great background. He is even maybe a disciple of the Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cDragon Palace?\u201d Both Tai Shan and the purple-haired middle-aged man opened their eyes wide.\u201cThat Swordsman is really a Disciples of Dragon Palace,\u201d said Ye Mei just then.\u201cReally?\u201d Ba Yan, Tai Shan, and the purple-haired middle-aged man\u2019s showed expressions of great interest.At their side, Jian Wushuang was casually sitting on a giant rock, playing with the Purple Soft Sword in his hand.That Purple Soft Sword was obtained after killing that warrior in silver. What was noticeable was that there were two red characters engraved on its Sword\u00a0Hilt\u2026 \u201c11\u201d.\u201c11?\u201d Jian Wushuang murmured. Then, he turned his hand over and a small scroll appeared.That was naturally the task scroll of the Dragon Palace.The Dragon Palace\u2019s task of Stage One had been mostly finished, so he began studying the task of Stage Two.Opening the scroll\u2026\u201cTask of Stage Two: Kill the Dark Silver Guard!\u201cTask Location: Innumerable Huge Mountains.\u201cTask Description: In the Palace of the Dongyang Commandery Prince of the Tianzong Dynasty, there is a well-cultivated guarding army called the Dark Silver Guard. There are more than 100 Dark Silver Guards, who often secretly help the Palace of Dongyang Commandery Prince to kill enemies and complete some confidential tasks. The cultivation process of the Dark Silver Guard is extremely cruel and complicated\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a Dark Silver Guard Team with 12 members which successfully entered the Innumerable Huge Mountains.\u201d\u201cMission Requirements: To kill at least five Dark Silver Guards and take their Purple Soft Swords with specific numbers that the Dark Silver Guards carry all the time as evidence.\u201d\u201cAward: 1000 points for killing a Dark Silver Guard and 3000 points for killing a Dark Silver Guard leader!\u201dAfter reading the whole mission scroll, Jian Wushuang looked weird.\u201cWas the warrior in silver I killed a Dark Silver Guard?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked at the Purple Soft Sword carved with a number 11. Obviously, it was the specific number of the Dark Silver Guard.\u201cThe Dark Silver Guard set the Golden-dragon Guard as a target for their mission. When Dragon Palace got the news, I, a Disciple of Dragon Palace, was sent to stop the Dark Silver Guards. Well, what they plan and conspire are so complicated.\u201d Jian Wushuang silently smiled but took it seriously in his heart.The Stage One task was quite easy for him. However, Stage Two made him feel stressed.It should be known that it was a Dark Silver Guard Team with 12 members in the Profound Gold Core Realm. All members were good at rapid and stealthy assassination. What\u2019s more, they were elusive. It was not easy to set them as the targets.\u201cIt\u2019s good news that members of the team are dispersed in the Innumerable Huge Mountains. I only need to assassinate five Dark Silver Guards to fulfill the task, and this is possible.\u201d Jian Wushuang thought.By late noon of the next day, the Mountains were still in darkness.\u201cLeader Ba Yan, in front it is the periphery of the Innumerable Huge Mountains. We do not need to worry about being the targets of others after we arrive there.\u201d Jian Wushuang said.\u201cSwordsman, are you sure that you want to adventure alone in the Innumerable Huge Mountains?\u201d Ba Yan asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded. \u201cCould you please extend the deadline of the task of Two-Claw Marked Golden Dragon Guard when you return to Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace? Then when I return next time, I can complete it with the golden horn.\u201d\u201cHaha. No problem. See you next time,\u201d Ba Yan said.\u201cSee you,\u201d Jian Wushuang said with a smile.\u201cSwordsman\u2026\u201d Ye Mei looked at Jian Wushuang with mixed feelings and did not know what to say next.The Innumerable Huge Mountains were immense.There were old trees aged tens and even hundreds of years around. Overgrown weeds and thorns were everywhere.The black-robed youth with a Long Sword walked alone in the jungle. He seemed to be relaxed and care free, but his Spiritual Power was at the ready constantly. He looked around with vigilance.\u201cIt has been two days.\u201d He slowly raised his head.It had been two days after he left Ba Yan and had walked alone into the Innumerable Huge Mountains. He encountered many spirit beasts and even a few Human Warriors, but he had not encountered Dark Silver Guards again.\u201cWell, the Innumerable Huge Mountains are so immense. What\u2019s more, there are just 12 Dark Silver Guard and one of them was killed by me. It is so difficult to find out the rest of the members. After all, they are spread out.\u201d Jian Wushuang slightly nodded his head. Suddenly, he noticed a spirit beast crawling hundreds of meters away. Then, he came up with an idea.\u201cSince I\u2019m unable to find them, let\u2019s see if I can make them come to me instead.\u201dNext moment, there was an outburst of Spiritual Power from Jian Wushuang and it went flew directly at the spirit beast which was only at the Level of Initial Gold Core Realm.A fierce battle broke out within a moment.With Jian Wushuang\u2019s strength, it would have been quite easy for him to kill the spirit beast at the level of Initial Gold Core Realm.However, this battle lasted a long time.Boom! Boom! Boom!The booming sound thundered and many trees around the battlefield fell over, some of which were even crushed. The ground was pitted with holes and sword scars, looking like a scene of great devastation.Judging from the battlefield, it seemed like a close battle. They made a huge racket when slaughtering, which gave the impression to people far away that it was a ferocious battle.Of course, all of this was caused by Jian Wushuang deliberately.The reason was quite simple: to attract Dark Silver Guards through the sounds of fighting.The reason why the Dark Silver Guards were here was to kill Golden-dragon Guards. So, they would be attracted where there were battles. If there was a Dark Silver Guard around Jian Wushuang, he would be attracted and immediately reveal himself.Obviously, Jian Wushuang was not very lucky. He deliberately slaughtered with the spirit beast for a long time, but the Dark Silver Guards were not attracted. It happened to attract another two spirit beasts and one of them was at the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201cIt seems that the Dark Silver Guards are not around. I\u2019d better move to another place.\u201d Jian Wushuang immediately left.After an hour, he appeared in a place tens of meters away and slaughtered with a spirit beast at the Level of Initial Gold Core Realm again and still made a tremendous sound.In the dense forest.Whoosh!A figure like a Ghost rapidly passed the trees and then soon stopped at the top of a big tree.The warrior in silver with a bony face was one of the members of the Dark Silver Guard Team.\u201cThe task has been going on for half a month, but I have only got 16 Golden-dragon Rings\u2026\u201d The warrior in silver frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s too few. I have to hurry up and try to gain 50 before the deadline.\u201d16 Golden-dragon Rings meant he had killed 16 Golden-dragon Guards.Suddenly, boom\u2026 A deep booming sound was heard at a distance.\u201cWhat?\u201d The warrior in silver changed color.The booming sound suggested that there was a slaughter ahead.\u201cI hope that there will be Golden-dragon Guards.\u201d There was a cold light flashing in his eyes, then he rapidly moved towards the source of the commotion.After a moment, the warrior in silver arrived at the vicinity of the battlefield. He stood behind a tree to observe what was happening in the forest.He noticed that a black-robed youth was slaughtering with a lion spirit beast using a longsword, and that the slaughter was intense.At first, warrior in silver was astonished at this scene, \u201cHow can a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea be able to slaughter with a spirit beast at the level of Initial Gold Core Realm?\u201dBut later, he observed that there was a golden Ring of Heaven and Earth in the hand of the black-robed youth.\u201cGolden-dragon Ring?\u201d The eyes of the warrior in silver were bright and there was a weird smile on his face. \u201cIt seems that I\u2019m able to immediately get the 17th Golden-dragon Ring!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But, it was obvious that he did not intend to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s the third time that I\u2019ve had a fierce fight with a Spirit Beast and deliberately made tremendous noises. Are there any Dark Silver Guards around that will be attracted by it?\u201d Jian Wushuang was not sure because only other Spirit Beasts had been attracted the last two times.The intense battle continued for a while, and then Jian Wushuang \u201cvery fiercely\u201d killed the Moon-fire Lion.A silver-haired man, standing behind a nearby tree, watched this scene silently. At the moment, he concentrated his attention and then quietly rushed out.\u201cBeat the air again?\u201d Jian Wushuang felt pity as he went to pick up the Core of the Moon-fire Lion.At that moment, a slight wind came suddenly.Common warriors, even the Warriors in the Profound Gold Core Realm might not have been able to sense such a light sound, but Jian Wushuang could hear the sound clearly because he had comprehended the Sword Essense of Gale.\u201cHe\u2019s finally come.\u201d Jian Wushuang felt happy, and in the next moment, he turned around and looked over.That warrior in silver was worthy of being a professional killer of the Dark Silver Guard. He picked a very good time for assassination, as Jian Wushuang had his back toward him.When he burst out, he directly stabbed at Jian Wushuang\u2019s neck with a Purple Soft Sword.The sword was so fast, and the warrior in silver was full of confidence with this move.\u201cHow wonderful the opportunity is! And what a perfect assassination! Even if he is a real expert in the Profound Gold Core Realm, he could not withstand my sword. There is no doubt that this guy is going to die, and the 17th Golden-dragon Ring will be had.\u201d The warrior in silver smiled to himself, along with the smile on his face.But unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang, who had his back toward him the entire time, suddenly turned around with a pair of cold eyes. And then, Jian Wushuang grinned at him.That smile gave a sudden scare to the warrior in silver.Damn.As a Dark Silver Guard, years of experience told him that he had fallen into a trap.Sure enough, Jian Wushuang directly fought back.\u201cShua!\u201dA beautiful scarlet sword light blazed out and instantly confronted the Purple Soft Sword of the warrior in silver directly. However, in the next moment, that scarlet sword light disappeared like an unreal image. When it appeared again, the sword had arrived at his chest.\u201cWhat?\u201d The warrior in silver was shocked. He was violently beaten back the first time.The scarlet sword light flashed across his chest. His silver cape was torn and a long wound appeared on his chest.\u201cHow powerful!\u201d The warrior in silver was intimidated.He was not good at face-to-face slaughtering, he was in the Profound Gold Core Realm at least. However, when he fought with Jian Wushuang, he felt that he had gone through Gate of Hell after just one encounter.At this moment, the strength that was revealed by Jian Wushuang even horrified him.He should have had the self-confidence to take Jian Wushuang as prey just now, with the purpose of taking that Golden-dragon Ring that was in his hand. But now it seemed\u2026Out of the two of them, who was the hunter, and who was the prey?\u201cYou are a Dark Silver Guard, right?\u201d Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.\u201cHuh?\u201d The warrior in silver looked up at Jian Wushuang with astonishment. How could he know his identity?\u201cI have taken your Purple Soft Sword.\u201d A grin spread over Jian Wushuang\u2019s face. Then, as he moved, the Spiritual Power in his body broke out while sword essence violently rushed into sky simultaneously.\u201cShua!\u201dAs it stabbed, the sword shadow made people feel that it was slow, but in fact, its true speed was so fast that it was scary.The fourth move of Formless Swordsmanship\u2026 A Hundred Variations!The warrior in silver was scared and had intended to stop it, but that sword was too fast. When he just raised the Purple Soft Sword in his hand, that \u201cslow\u201d sword had appeared in front of his throat and then pierced his throat directly.Jian Wushuang picked up the Purple Soft Sword from the warrior in silver, and looked at the engraving \u201c9\u201d on its Sword\u00a0Hilt.\u201cTwo Purple Soft Swords .\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled, and then he checked the Ring of Heaven and Earth left by the man in silver.\u201cAs expected, like that Dark Silver Guard from before, both of them had collected a lot of Golden-dragon Rings. This time, there are 16 in total, which means that he had killed 16 Golden-dragon Guards.\u201d Jian Wushuang was astonished.The true strength of these Dark Silver Guards was actually not frightening, but their ability of assassination was indeed so strong that people in the Profound Gold Core Realm might be directly killed if they were careless.\u201cKeep moving\u2026\u201dJian Wushuang continued to go further in the Innumerable Huge Mountains. Just like before, he stopped at each section of the road to find a Spirit Beast in the Initial Gold Core Realm and impetuously fight with them. He deliberately made it a big scene so he could attract the Dark Silver Guards that came on their own initiative.But unfortunately, his luck seemed to have completely run out. Over the next three days, Jian Wushuang did not come across a third Dark Silver Guard.In the Innumerable Huge Mountains, a breeze blew with a mild bloody odor.\u201cBe careful. Buck up,\u201d a man said in a low voice. And a small team with a dozen people slowly moved ahead in the jungle.Most of them in this small team looked pale, even some of their eyes were full of terror.Suddenly, the grass in the front shook.\u201cWho is it?\u201dA sudden shout was raised, and all the people in the team looked over at the grass.\u201cCrash!\u201d The grass then parted to two sides. A black-robed youth wearing a Long Sword slowly appeared in front of these people\u2014it was Jian Wushuang.\u201cHuh?\u201d Jian Wushuang looked up at this small team of a dozen people without any astonishment in his eyes.The Innumerable Huge Mountains were boundless. There were a lot of Nature Treasures and countless Spirit Beasts. It was a perfect place for Warriors to cultivate themselves, so it was common to encounter other people occasionally.When seeing Jian Wushuang, the whole team felt nervous. But soon after, they perceived that Jian Wushuang was only a warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea, so they relaxed.\u201cWhere does this reckless dude come from? Get out now!\u201d the team\u2019s leader, who had Birdeyes, immediately shouted.\u201cSomeone in the Spiritual Sea Realm dares to adventure in the Innumerable Huge Mountains alone? You are really heading for death.\u201d The rest of the team members also laughed at him, which lightened the tense atmosphere at that moment.Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. He was not angry about their words, but their expressions attracted his attention.\u201cThese people obviously feel some degree of fear,\u201d Jian Wushuang thought.\u201cPeople who dare to adventure in the Innumerable Huge Mountains generally have experienced life and death, so it\u2019s impossible for common things to make them feel scared. Unless\u2026\u201d Jian Wushuang glanced at their hands quickly, and there surely were four people whose wore Golden-dragon Rings on their fingers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unexpectedly, he\u2019s a Warrior at the Level of Spiritual Sea.\u201d\u201cA Warrior with just a level of Spiritual Sea dares to adventure in the Innumerable Huge Mountains. He must be really bold.\u201d\u201cI think he isn\u2019t bold, just suicidal.\u201dThese two men were walking abreast and talking.Suddenly\u2026 a silvery Ghost-like figure appeared in front of one man while a sword light stabbed at him. The man could react. After the sword light slashed across his throat, he was immediately killed. Just as quickly, the silvery Ghost-liked figure disappeared.\u201cHey, do you think that the horrible guy has left\u2026\u201d The other man was still talking to that man and looking towards him.He saw the corpse of that man slowly falling to the ground.\u201cOh!\u201d The strong man screamed and all the other members of the team came over for a look.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d They asked.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cAsshole. It\u2019s him again!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s coming. The bad guy. He\u2019s coming again!\u201d\u201cDevil. Devil. He\u2019s a devil!\u201dSuddenly the whole team became restless and terrified again.It should be known that this team originally had over 30 people. But now there was just a half alive, the other half of them were killed by this \u201cdevil\u201d.From start to end, they had not even seen the devil\u2019s face clearly.Whoosh!The sound of rushing wind was heard again. A silvery figure like a Ghost moved swiftly and showed up in front of the strong man. The strong man saw a sword light with difficulty and then was killed directly.The silvery figure moved toward the jungle again.\u201cIt\u2019s so easy\u2026 to kill these people.\u201d The Dark Silver Guard laughed. Shortly after he had just entered the jungle, he found a black-robed youth standing here.With his hand clasping his wrists behind his back, the black-robed youth watched him with interest. It seemed that the black-robed young man had been waiting for him.\u201cWho and what are you doing here?\u201d The Dark Silver Guard felt surprised, but the black-robed youth in front of him had already started to attack him.The Dark Silver Guard was outclassed by a formidable sword shadow filled with strong Earth Sword Essence.The Dark Silver Guard changed his countenance at once and hastily brandished his Purple Soft Sword to parry.Bang!The sword shadow hit the Purple Soft Sword and twisted it due to the powerful force. The Dark Silver Guard felt his palm numb and a stinging pain. He flew out of the jungle and staggered back a few steps before standing firmly.Shua!All of the people in the team with more than 10 members looked at him together.\u201cDamn it!\u201d The Dark Silver Guard said and had a ghastly expression.\u201cThe seventh.\u201d The other silvery figure showed up at the side of the Dark Silver Guard, staring with alertness at the black-robed youth who was walking towards them slowly.\u201cOh? There are two guys?\u201d Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and felt delighted secretly.Jiang WuShuang followed the team before. Perceiving the countenance of the people in the team, Jiang Wushuang guessed that they might be under surveillance of the Dark Silver Guard. So he didn\u2019t leave and hid in the jungle. As he expected, the Dark Silver Guard appeared.But lucky for him, the team was waylaid by two instead of only one Dark Silver Guard.Two for one?\u201cWho are you?\u201d The man with Birdeyes, the leader of the team, shouted to them immediately when he saw Jian Wushuang and two Dark Silver Guards. All the other members took a deep breath and waited to see what would happen next.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of who I am. You need to know that they\u2019re targeting to your team. And I am targeting them,\u201d Jian Wushuang laughed and said.\u201cThose two guys staring at us?\u201d The man with Birdeyes looked at the two Dark Silver Guards and said.\u201cThe devils? Are them?\u201d\u201cTwo warriors, who are in the Profound Gold Core Realm?\u201dImmediately, the whole team became restless.With a solemn expression, the two Dark Silver Guards did not care about the man with birdeyes and his team, but they were afraid of Jian Wushuang standing in front of them.Although Jian Wushuang\u2019s Cultivation of Spiritual Power was just at the Level of Spiritual Sea, no one dared to regard him as a common Spiritual Sea Realm Warrior in terms of that movements he showed just now.\u201cOld seventh. We are exposed. It\u2019s not our strength to slaughter directly. We should leave now. Hurry up!\u201d The Dark Silver Guard, who had never fought with Jian Wushuang, said.\u201cOkay.\u201d The other Dark Silver Guard nodded heavily. Both of them transformed into beams of Flowing Light and fled into the jungle at the side.\u201cHaha. Do you think you can escape?\u201dA cold voice emerged and then Jian Wushuang stabbed at the two Dark Silver Guards with his Triple-kill Sword.The sword shadow moved so quickly and was like a flash of lightning streaking through the Void.A gust of wind roared.The wind stopped and the swords fell to the ground at the same time.Everything returned to peace.The two Dark Silver Guards\u2019 eyes widened in shock. They looked incredulously at their chests which had been poked through.The two dead bodies dropped to the ground at the same time.Jian Wushuang held the Triple-kill Sword with blood dripping from the Sword Edge.\u201cI have already mastered the fifth move of the Formless Swordsmanship.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s lips curled into a small smile.The fifth move of the Formless Swordsmanship was faster and more ruthless than the fourth move\u2013 A Hundred Variations.The sword was brandished. The wind stopped and then the sword dropped! The two Dark Silver Guards were already dead.\u201cThey are also warriors in the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm, but are far from the Disciples of Dragon Palace.\u201d Jian Wushuang looked down at the two corpses, shaking his head secretly.The Disciples of Dragon Palace, were the talents who comprehended the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth to a high level. At the Dragon Palace, a Disciple of Dragon Palace in the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm was able to compete with the warriors in the Level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm.However, Jian Wushuang had beaten a Disciple of Dragon Palace who was in the Level of Profound Gold Core Realm. It was really easy for him to kill Warriors at the Level of Gold Core. Moreover, the Formless Swordsmanship he mastered was the ultimate Sword Skill which stressed speed.As long as Jian Wushuang used the fifth move of the Formless Swordsmanship, the two Dark Silver Guards had no chance to struggle and would be killed immediately.After killing the two Dark Silver Guards and picking up their Purple Soft Swords and Rings of Heaven and Earth, Jian Wushuang was far too busy to care about the shocked expressions of those people around him. He turned around and wanted to leave. After he had walked several steps, he stopped suddenly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jian Wushuang said. With unprecedented shock in his eyes, he looked out into the distance.He still could see the vibrant jungle. But at this moment, there was a kind of strange feeling emerging in his heart.Meanwhile, a mysterious strength from the Sword Soul within his body gradually emerged.The Sword Soul\u2026 his Sword Soul was waking up.Although his Sword Soul was awakening, he didn\u2019t know what it was. He just knew that because of the awakening of Sword Soul, he could comprehend sword essence with an astounding speed.But now, it was his first mutation after the awakening of Sword Soul.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed that something in front, not far away, was summoning and calling to him. To be exact, it was summoning and attracting his Sword Soul.\u201cWhat on earth is there? What is summoning me?\u201d Jian Wushuang leaped to a branch of a big tree, looking forward.Hesitating for a while, Jian Wushuang decided to investigate.Whoosh!Jian Wushuang directly rushed forward. And he also found that as he was getting closer and closer, his Sword Soul felt stronger and stronger. Likewise the attractive summoning power.In the meantime, Jian Wushuang rushed toward the source of that\u00a0power.Meanwhile in the mountain forest where Jian Wushuang had killed two Dark Silver Guards,\u201cHumph! Is it these two f**k guys that killed so many teammates?\u201d The Birdeyed man and other teammates approached the corpses of the two Dark Silver Guards.They thought the one that had spied on them and killed several dozen teammates was a devil, a demon.But now looking carefully, they found that they were also ordinary mortals without three heads and six arms and only possessed Cultivation of Profound Gold Core Realm.\u201cPooh! Two bastards! Useless!\u201dThe rest of the team were all cursing. Some of them were spitting at the two Dark Silver Guards.No one noticed that a coquettish shadow had already appeared in a nearby tree. It was a lady with a bleak face. She was quite beautiful in silver, tightly holding a Purple Soft Sword whose hilt was carved with the number one.\u201cLao Liu, Lao Qi?\u201dStanding in the tip of the tree, the severe-looking lady observed the corpses of the two Dark Silver Guards at a glance and a frozen killing intent flashed in her eyes immediately.\u201cAre they?\u201d The frosty lady took action at once.They were still cursing when a coquettish shadow moved suddenly.\u201cAh!\u201d \u201cAh!\u201dTwo miserable shrieks sounded in succession. The next moment, they felt panic.\u201cDevil? Devil again?\u201d\u201cHadn\u2019t he been killed already?\u201d\u201cShit! He hasn\u2019t. He is coming again.\u201dAmidst those frightened voices, the blurry silver shadow moved, again and again, killing people crazily.Just after a while, there were numerous corpses on the ground. Dozens of teammates were dead except the leader, the birdeyed man. But his arms had already been chopped off, he had lost the ability to struggle.\u201cGood-for-nothings. You aren\u2019t likely to kill Lao Liu and Lao Qi. Tell me, who killed them?\u201d the bleak lady turned up in front of the Birdeye man, interrogating.The Birdeyed man had been frightened into numbness and immediately told everything he knew.\u201cSpiritual Sea Realm?\u201d\u201cLao Liu and Lao Qi were killed just by a Spiritual Sea Realm?\u201dThe bleak lady\u2019s face clouded over. When she waved her hands, a sword directly pierced through the Birdeye man\u2019s throat. And then she chased toward the direction where Jian Wushuang left.Pursuing the sense of fate, Jian Wushuang soon came to the convergence of two mountains. However, the convergence was cut off in the middle by a dark bottomless abyss.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Jian Wushuang stood nearby the abyss, looking upon the bottom of the dark abyss where the chilly wind blowing.Swoosh!A chilly wind blew on both side of the mountain wall with a crackling sound. Meanwhile, some mountain stones were blown off.\u201cHorrible wind.\u201d Jian Wushuang was astonished and knew where this was.\u201cThe Abyss is well-deserved as the most dangerous land among Innumerable Huge Mountains.\u201d Jian Wushuang looked grim face.Before leaving for Innumerable Huge Mountains, he had gotten a map of it. There was information about the natural dangers on it, including the Abyss.The Abyss, located at the convergence of two great mountains, was bottomless. There was a strong chill wind blowing into the abyss. The force of this chill wind was so terrible that rocks would be cracked into pieces, not to speak of the human body.However, a human warrior could generate a shield of Spiritual Power to forcibly withstand these chill wind.However the most terrifying aspect of the abyss was absolutely not the chill wind, but its mystery.Since the abyss had appeared, over a long period, a great many strong warriors including some warriors of Yin-Yang Void Realm had attempted to explore it. But they only could enter within a kilometer. Once exceeding that, no one could get out alive.So until now, nobody knew what existed at the bottom and what the secret was?Unknown! Mysterious!As such, the Abyss was so frightening and universally acknowledged to be the most dangerous land among Innumerable Huge Mountains.\u201cIs it the Abyss that attracted me all this time?\u201d There was a hint of shock in Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes.The Abyss was well-known, mysterious and terrible. What on earth was attracting him over there?\u201cIs it the Ancestor\u2019s Land that aunt had told me before?\u201d Jian Wushuang remembered it spontaneously.Ancestor\u2019s Land. Jian Wushuang also did not know what it was.Ji Wuyue had told him to carefully keep the Triple-kill Sword, the only token to enter the Ancestor\u2019s Land.In his view, it seemed that in the abyss, the only thing deeply attracting him was the Ancestor\u2019s Land.Of course, Jian Wushuang was uncertain whether it was the Ancestor\u2019s Land below the abyss. Even if confirmed, he dared not go down now.Seriously, it was the abyss. Among other things, he was unable to withstand the chill wind with his present strength. It was no different from going to hell if he entered the Abyss impulsively.\u201cI should explore it after my strength is increased,\u201d murmured Jian Wushuang.Jian Wushuang felt very curious to find that there seemed to be a relation between the abyss and the Ancestor\u2019s Land. But what made him happy was the changes in his body.\u201cSword Soul, are you completely awake?\u201dJian Wushuang smile slightly. Just on the way, his power of Sword Soul hidden in the body was continually improving, becoming stronger and stronger. Until now, the power of Sword Soul had reached a completely new level. Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang also found that there was something new in his brain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, now the Sword Soul had awoken thoroughly and formed a solid sword-shaped phantom.\"I'm wondering what would happen after my Sword Soul evolved into the sword-shaped phantom?\" Jian Wushuang was curious, but now the sword-shaped phantom just silently floated in the sea of consciousness, so he could not find out anything.\"Maybe it would be helpful to my sense of sword essence?\" Jian Wushuang murmured with a smile.But at that moment\u2026\"What?\"Jian Wushuang sensed a sudden feeling of fear, and he turned his head in a rush only to see an alluring silver figure dashing toward him with a Purple Soft Sword. The chilling light reflected by the Sword Edge surprised Jian Wushuang, and the cold and murderous look in her eyes frightened him.\"So fast! Much faster and more terrifying than the four Dark Silver Guards that I fought before!\" Jian Wushuang wanted to retreat, but obviously, the sword edge flickering with purple light had already approached him.Jian Wushuang had no time to take out his sword and parry, but he tried his best to force his body to one side.This move had allowed him to avoid hurting vital parts of his body.\"Shua!\"The cold sword edge crossed Jian Wushuang's shoulder, tearing his clothes up as blood spattered. A two-centimeter blood stain emerged from his chest to his shoulder.Seeing this blood stain, even as tough as Jian Wushuang was, he could not stop a chill from going up his spine.Just at that moment, he would have been a dead person if he had reacted even a little bit slower.He could avoid hurting his vital parts?That cold-faced woman looked surprised when Jian Wushuang survived her attack, and then she retreated rapidly.\"Trying to escape now? Too late!\"Jian Wushuang shouted, and then he withstood the sharp pain from his shoulder, dashing out with the Triple-kill Sword.A gust of wind roared.This sword movement!Having a look of fear, the cold-faced woman thrust out her Purple Soft Sword.\"Clang!\"The fifth movement of the Formless Swordsmanship, which Jian Wushuang had used, was blocked by the cold-faced woman. She then fled into the woods behind Jian Wushuang.\"Haha, do you think you can escape?\"Jian Wushuang said with a snort and lifted the Triple-kill Sword up high. His tremendous Earth Sword Essence condensed gradually, forming a huge, three-meter-long and half-meter-wide sword-shaped phantom.Formless Sword Wave, the Eighth Move!The majestic phantom quaked a little and directly slashed toward the woods, where the cold-faced woman was hiding.The huge sword-shaped phantom showed its power!The power struck heaven and earth!Immediately, a large number of trees collapsed, some were even pulled up from their roots. The cold-faced woman was exposed to Jian Wushuang at once.\"Found you,\" Jian Wushuang said with a fleeting murderous gaze.\"What, what the...\" The cold-faced woman was deeply shocked by the big patch of rupturing woods. And at that moment, a gust of wind blew over that almost burst her head. Right away, she was buried in the wind.And then, the wind dropped and the swords fell on the ground.The surroundings totally calmed down.Jian Wushuang walked slowly toward the dead body of the cold-faced woman, with his hands covering the bleeding wound on his shoulder.The dead woman's wide-open eyes were filled with shock.\"A woman?\" Jian Wushuang looked down at the dead body.Although it was a woman, Jian Wushuang did not dare to underestimate her at all. It was this cold-faced woman that had nearly killed him.Leaning over to take her Purple Soft Sword, Jian Wushuang stared at the number on the sword hilt.\"Just as I thought.\"Jian Wushuang understood what happened when he saw the number \"1\" carved on the sword hilt.\"She was the leader of the Dark Silver Guard.\" Jian Wushuang was not surprised.The cold-faced woman was far superior to the Dark Silver Guards that he had met before. Just the time that she chose to attack, the speed that she burst in an instant, the determination that she had to kill, and the sword that she thrust out almost got him into big trouble.Only the leader of the Dark Silver Guard could possess such powerful assassination skills.Regarding the points reward of the Stage Two missions distributed by the Dragon Palace: to kill an ordinary Dark Silver Guard could only earn you 1,000 points; to kill a leader of a Dark Silver Guard, however, was 3,000 points.Such a big difference between the points made it reasonable for such a great difference in their strengths.\"With this Purple Soft Sword of the leader of Dark Silver Guard, I have finished my mission for Stage Two.\" Jian Wushuang sighed slightly and looked over his shoulder unconsciously.The nearly two-centimeter wound from his chest to his shoulder was still bleeding. The blood had reddened his clothes.\"I need to first find a place to bind up the wound and recover a little.\" Jian Wushuang left there immediately.After half a day, near a stream in the Innumerable Huge Mountains\u2014\"Hum~~~!\"The sword lights were brandished one after another.After binding up the wound, Jian Wushuang had started to practice his swordsmanship.The wound on his shoulder was indeed very severe, but the elixirs from the Secret Pavilion of the Dragon Palace were magical.After taking the elixirs for only half a day, the pain from the wound was alleviated, and he was getting better. He would recover in no more than two days.Flashes of sword shadows fleeted incessantly with straight stabbing or chopping, and every single sword rumbled with a slight heat.With Jian Wushuang practicing his swordsmanship faster and faster, the heat hidden in his swordsmanship became violent and fierce.\"Hua!\"Shouting out loud, Jian Wushuang brandished the Triple-kill Sword and chopped into a giant tree beside him.\"Bang!\"The giant tree, tens of meters high, burst from the middle.Watching this, a trace of a smile appeared on Jian Wushuang's face.\"Sword Essence of Raging Fire. So this is the Sword Essence of Raging Fire.\"After comprehending the Sword Essence of Gale and the Earth Sword Essence, Jian Wushuang had comprehended a third sword essence... Sword Essence of Raging Fire!\"Sure enough, now that my Sword Soul has awakened totally, it is much easier for me to comprehend sword essence,\" Jian Wushuang said with a slight smile.Before the awakening, he had tried to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire many times, but always failed in the end.But now, he could comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire with ease. There was only one reason that the sword-shaped phantom was formed in his sea of consciousness. After that, it was much easier and simpler to comprehend the sword essence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Though I comprehend some Sword Essence of Raging Fire, I don't have the appropriate Sword Skill to display it now. There is nothing to do but exchange the appropriate Sword Skill of Sword Essence of Raging Fire after going back to the Dragon Palace.\" Jian Wushuang smiled and then leaped to the top of a big tree.Leaning against the tree trunk, Jian Wushuang took out the last task scroll.\"I've completed the Stage One and Two tasks. What is the Stage Three task?\" Jian Wushuang wondered with a slight expectation.He was assigned three tasks by the Dragon Palace this time. The first one was easy to complete. But the second one was much tougher, which almost killed him. And the third one...Jian Wushuang opened the scroll. After taking a glance at it, he unexpectedly stared with rounded eyes.On the scroll read some words...\"Stage Three Task: Kill 10 Spirit Beasts of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm!\"Task Location: the Innumerable Huge Mountains.\"\"Task Description: Lots of Spirit Beasts live in the Innumerable Huge Mountains and countless of them have reached the Primordial Gold Core. Though being in the Level of Spiritual Sea, you defeated a disciple of the Dragon Palace who was a warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm in a face-to-face battle. You are fully capable of killing Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.\"Task Points: Whether these 10 Spirit Beasts of the Fulfillment of the Golden Pill Realm are strong or not, each one is worth 1,000 points. Bringing their bodies back to the Dragon Palace will serve as proof.\"\"Shit!\"Even Jian Wushuang could not help cursing while reading the Stage Three task.To kill Spirit Beasts?Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm?A full 10 of them?Are they kidding?\"Those elders in the Dragon Palace must want me to go to hell,\" Jian Wushuang said to himself.In the task description, it referred to a disciple of the Dragon Palace who was a warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm that was defeated by him face-to-face. Indeed, he did that. But how did he do it?It was not until Jian Wushuang made his opponent use up his Spiritual Power that he won the battle.However, he was completely suppressed when competing with Nangong Jie.Jian Wushuang clearly knew his strength. It was not a big deal for him to kill a common warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm. But what about competing with the one in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm?He barely could compete with a common warrior in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. He surmised that, in the end, he would be suppressed.And to kill Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm?Firstly, it was much more difficult to kill Spirit Beasts than humans because of their different physical conditions.Secondly, Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core had intelligence. If they found that they could not beat Jian Wushuang, they would flee rather than foolishly continue to fight with him or even continuously consume their Spiritual Power.More importantly, Jian Wushuang was not as strong as a Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.\"Cruel. They are so cruel.\" Jian Wushuang cursed while gnashing his teeth.But the good news was that the task time was unlimited. Therefore, he could make good preparations before killing those Spirit Beasts.Three days later, Jian Wushuang targeted an Armored Tiger in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.The Armored Tiger was strong in defense capabilities but not so good in speed. Compared with others, it was relatively weak. At the very beginning, Jian Wushuang naturally chose a weaker one to fight with that was not a threat to him.Jian Wushuang quickly started to attack.Selecting the right time, he made a sneak attack. However, he did not get any advantage because the Armored Tiger reacted in time.Then, Jian Wushuang made good use of his swordsmanship and sword essence and started to fight with the Shell-backed Tiger.In this battle, the man and beast were neck and neck. However, the Armored Tiger chose to directly leave when it found that it could not beat Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang could do nothing but let it go.Fighting with the Armored Tiger, he could not prevail at all, let alone did he kill it.\"Well. Take it easy...\"He sighed and then spontaneously overlooked the endless mountains and woods far away.He knew that he might have to stay in the Innumerable Huge Mountains for a long time.Things happened just as he had expected.There were lots of Spirit Beasts in the Innumerable Huge Mountains. Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core were countless and Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm were also easy to find. Jian Wushuang wandered alone in the Innumerable Huge Mountains and fought with Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm one after another.Jian Wushuang felt great pressure when fighting with any Spirit Beast in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. He tried his best in each battle. Such crazy slaughtering vastly improved his strength.Especially after his Sword Soul had completely awoken, he distinctly comprehended sword essence much faster than before.Even so, it was two months later that Jian Wushuang succeeded in killing the first Spirit Beast in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm with great effort.As time went by...The hot summer had soon gone and so had the autumn. Instantly, the cold winter arrived.Jian Wushuang had wandered alone in the Innumerable Huge Mountains for half a year.At the edge of the Innumerable Huge Mountains, visible to the naked eye, a man who wore an animal-skin and carried a Long Sword slowly walked out of the mountains. Judging by his appearance, he was a young man, but he had a calm and resolute face, and his exposed skin was bronzed.Even in the cold winter, this young man wearing thin animal-skin did not feel cold at all.\"Innumerable Huge Mountains, I have finally gotten out.\" Jian Wushuang turned and glanced at the endless mountains and forests behind him. He smiled slightly with his mouth turned up.Staying in the Innumerable Huge Mountains for more than half a year, he had suffered a lot and met with danger several times that almost killed him. If he took off his animal-skin, many scars on his body would clearly be seen. Most of them were inflicted by the claws of Spirit Beasts, and some of them were by humans.Among them, a 20-centimeter scar that extended from his breast to his shoulder was the most evident.He had also improved himself so much over these six months.And of course, he had completed the Stage Three task.There were a full 10 Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm and their Cores lying in his Ring of Heaven and Earth.Walking along the official road, Jian Wushuang did not spend much time before returning to Moon Heart City.The Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace of Moon Heart City was still bustling and boisterous.Jian Wushuang, in the animal-skin, entered the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace and walked directly to the counter. A black-haired elder, who stood in front of the counter, had met Jian Wushuang half a year ago and knew his status. Therefore, when seeing Jian Wushuang again, he made a respectful face.\"Your Excellency,\" the black-haired elder said in a low voice. No one else around them could hear it except for Jian Wushuang.\"I came here to tell you about the task.\" Jian Wushuang took out a Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, handed it over to the elder and said, \"The task was assigned half a year ago.\"\"Please wait a moment, Your Excellency.\" Immediately, the black-clothed elder carefully looked at the task list and quickly found the task that Jian Wushuang had accepted to catch the Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From now on, you are a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard of Golden-dragon Palace.\u201dLooking at the Golden-dragon Ring, Jian Wushuang found that there were two claw marks which were the sign of a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard.\u201cArrange a Griffin for me, please. I\u2019m going back to Dragon Palace,\u201d Jian Wushuang then asked.\u201cOkay. I will do it right now,\u201d the elder with grey hair said and nodded.At the very moment, a gentle middle-aged man in a white coat walked into the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.Suddenly the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace fell silent. All those present looked at that man.\u201cYin-Yang Void Realm!\u201d\u201cIs he a Golden-dragon Ambassador?\u201d\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. He is\u2026 the Governor of Blizzard City\u2013 His Excellency Lin Yun!\u201d\u201cYes. He is. It is said that His Excellency Lin Yun is a very kind and respectable good elder.\u201dPeople in Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace were all in shock.It was very rare to meet such a super master of Yin-Yang Void Realm.Jian Wushuang also looked over at that man.With a mild face, the gentle middle-aged looked elegant and cultivated, decent and smart. Besides, his eyes were very kind and warm.Generally speaking, a super master who was in Yin-Yang Void Realm had an amazing deterrent power. But the gentle middle-aged man was very kind and friendly, which made it hard for people to fear him.\u201cMr. He,\u201d the gentle middle-aged man walked to the counter softy said.\u201cYour Excellency Lin Yun.\u201d The elder showed great respect.\u201cI\u2019d like to assign a task, please give me that task scroll,\u201d Lin Yun said very politely.\u201cOkay. Wait for a moment, please.\u201d The black-robed elder instantly went to take the scroll.Lin Yun waited in front of the counter with a slight smile. After looking around, he saw Jian Wushuang who was also waiting in front of the counter.\u201cHmmm?\u201d Lin Yun suddenly felt stunned but he did not express it.\u201cLittle Brother, may I know your name?\u201d Lin Yun seemed to ask casually.Feeling startled, Jian Wushuang didn\u2019t expect that an elder of Yin-Yang Void Realm would talk to him and instantly answered, \u201cI\u2019m Swordsman.\u201d\u201cSwordsman?\u201d Lin Yun showed a quirky expression without saying more.\u201cYour Excellency Lin Yun, this is the scroll.\u201d The black-robed elder handed it over to Lin Yun and then looked at Jian Wushuang. \u201cYour Excellency Swordsman, your Griffin is ready. You can go outside the city.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded and then left Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.After Jian Wushuang left, Lin Yun instantly asked, \u201cMr.He, what is that young man\u2019s status? He is just a warrior of Spiritual Sea Realm. Why do you call him Your Excellency?\u201d\u201cYour Excellency Lin Yun. That young man is great,\u201d the black-robed elder said with great admiration.\u201cGreat? Could he come from Dragon Palace?\u201d Lin Yun asked again.The black-robed elder slightly smiled but didn\u2019t reply. But Lin Yun had got the answer from his smile.\u201cIt is him.\u201d Lin Yun laughed brightly, and then quickly put down his pen, turning and leaving.\u201cYourExcellency Lin Yun, you haven\u2019t assigned your task?\u201d the black-robed elder promptly asked him.\u201cI\u2019ll come back later.\u201d Briefly replying, Lin Yun departed Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.Outside the Moon Heart City, a Golden-armored Sergent riding a Griffin was waiting there. After arrival, Jian Wushuang directly sat on the Griffin and then left for Dragon Palace.As soon as Jian Wushuang left, Lin Yun suddenly appeared there.\u201cA Griffin?\u201dGriffins flew so fast that Lin Yun couldn\u2019t catch up with it even though he was a powerhouse of Yin-Yang Void Realm.Staring at the direction where Jian Wushuang disappeared, Lin Yun lost his mild smile and turned cold. Turning his hand, he had a portrait.The young man in the portrait was quite similar to Jian Wushuang in appearance.\u201cIt\u2019s him. Absolutely!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be a mistake!\u201d\u201cScarlet Must-kill Command\u2026 Jian Wushuang!\u201dLooked at the portrait, Lin Yun had an unprecedented killing intent in his eyes.\u201cNo wonder they searched the whole Tianyan Province but could not find Jian Wushuang. Because he had left Tianyan Province and gone to Dragon Palace, being a Disciple of Dragon Palace!\u201d Lin Yun clenched his fists.People only knew that Lin Yun was the Governor of Blizzard City who was a very gentle and respectable man with a good reputation. However, he also concealed another identity\u2013 a purple mask killer of Blood Feather Tower.\u201cI finally found him!\u201d\u201cI have to report it right away!\u201dLin Yun immediately went back to report the news.The news shocked the whole Blood Feather Tower for a moment.Blood Feather Tower paid more attention to Jian Wushuang than to anyone as he was the target of a Scarlet Kill Command.In a dim study, an old man in gray stood there with his hands behind his back. And two black-robed men in purple masks stood behind him.Killers with purple masks, the best killers in Blood Feather Tower.In general, killers with purple masks were selected from super experts of Yin-Yang Void Realm. However, the two killers with purple masks now were standing respectfully behind the old man in gray. It could be presumed that the old man held an important status in Blood Feather Tower.\u201cIt is confirmed that the target of Scarlet Kill Command is using the pseudonym of Swordsman. He has been in Dragon Palace for more than nine months and showed his great talent. After three months, he has defeated a disciple of Profound Gold Core Realm and was able to pass through the sixth level of Dragon Gate,\u201d a killer with purple mask said respectfully.The old man in gray slightly narrowed his eyes, murmuring, \u201cThere are countless experts in Dragon Palace, the Holy Cultivation Sanctuary. Even if all the purple mask killers of Blood Feather Tower attacked Dragon Palace at once, they would not be able to kill Jian Wushuang. Therefore, we cannot kill him until he leaves Dragon Palace again.\u201d\u201cGive out my order. Closely follow Jian Wushuang\u2019s every move from today. Report his behavior and experiences in Dragon Palace every seven days. If there is a chance, the secret killer hidden in Dragon Palace should take action!\u201d\u201cHis Excellency, Dragon Palace is a very hard to infiltrate. We paid a great cost to plant the secret killer in it. Should we sacrifice him?\u201d a killer with purple mask instantly asked.\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d the old man in gray glanced at the killer with purple mask, snorting and saying, \u201cAs long as we can kill him, we will sacrifice the secret killer. If necessary, both of you could be sacrificed.\u201dBoth two killers with purple masks were shocked by what he said.At the same time, they eventually knew what a Scarlet Kill Command was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97: ExchangeTranslator: Transn Editor: TransnBack at Dragon Palace, Jian Wushuang submitted his tasks.At Stage One, 2,000 points were awarded.In Stage Two of the task, Jian Wushuang received 4,000 points for killing four ordinary Dark Silver Guards and 3,000 points for killing the leader of the Dark Silver Guard.In Stage Three of the task, there were ten Spirit Beasts at the Level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm. Each one was worth 1,000 points and so the total points were 10,000.Therefore Jian Wushuang received a total of 19,000 points after adding up all three stages.Coupled with the 12,000 points won from the duel with Nangong Jie before, together with his own points, Jian Wushuang had an abundance of points now.After getting the points, he went to the Secret Pavilion immediately.In Secret Pavilion, firstly he needed to select a Sword Skill suitable for Sword Essence of Raging Fire.After picking and choosing, Jian Wushuang selected the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire.Sword Skill of Blood and Fire was further divided into two volumes and its exchange price was 6,000 points. It was even more expensive than the Formless Sword Wave that he had exchanged for previously.Subsequently, he received three notebooks again.These notebooks were left by three strong men who were at the top level of Yin-Yang Void Realm. The three notes had very detailed explanations for Sword Essence of Gale, Sword Essence of Earth and Sword Essence of Raging Fire, and helped Jian Wushuang a lot.Each one of these three notebooks was as valuable as the Sword Skill, and Jian Wushuang spent 6,000 points to exchange for these three notebooks.After that, Jian Wushuang began to exchange for some Elixirs.5,000 points for one Bottleneck-breaking Elixir. He exchanged for three Bottleneck-breaking Elixirs at a time, spending 15,000 points.5,000 points for one Golden-sun Pill which he redeemed.Adding this up, it cost him another 20,000 points.\u201d I thought my points were quite a lot, but now there isn\u2019t much left. \u201d Jian Wushuang sighed inside.After all these things had been exchanged, he had only 3,000 points.But all these things were extremely useful.Especially the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire and those three notebooks.Both the Bottleneck-breaking Elixir and the Golden-sun Pill were used to prepare for his breakthrough.After he swallowed First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill for half a year when he was in the Innumerable Huge Mountains, and coupled with his speed at cultivating due to the Heavenly Creation Skill, his Spiritual Sea had expanded to the extreme and was at the peak of Ultimate Spirit Sea after half a year, with boundless Spiritual Power.After this step was achieved, the next was to break through to Gold Core by any means.Bottleneck-breaking Elixir, just as its name implied, was to break the barrier. After swallowing one Bottleneck-breaking Elixir, people could quickly touch that barrier, thus they had a chance to achieve a breakthrough.As for Golden-sun Pill, it was used when making a breakthrough.After all, there were risks when making a breakthrough, because sometimes the barrier still could not be broken through even if they touched it.However, the Golden-sun Pill could minimize this risk.These two kinds of Elixirs, with astonishing high value, were extremely rare in the outside world. Even in the Secret Pavilion, 5,000 points was needed for only one.At a lofty palace of the Dragon Palace.\u201cMy lord, Swordsman is coming back,\u201d a purple-robed servant of Dragon Palace said.\u201cOh?\u201d With brow lifted, Palace Master White said, \u201cHas he finished his experience tasks?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Purple-robed servant nodded.\u201cHis experience tasks were arranged and carefully selected by me in person. I thought he needed at least one year to finish all these tasks, while it only took him half a year to finish them. Well done,\u201d Palace Master White said with a smile.She thought highly of Jian Wushuang.It was because of her high opinion that the arranged experience tasks were more challenging since these tasks for Jian Wushuang were arranged and selected by her in person.\u201cHe received sufficient points this time and should go to the Secret Pavilion to exchange for treasures. What did he exchange?\u201d the Palace Master White asked again.\u201cThis is the list of the treasures he exchanged for.\u201d A purple-robed servant immediately handed over a list.\u201cThree Bottleneck-breaking Elixirs and a Golden-sun Pill?\u201d Palace Master White nodded slightly, \u201cIt seems that he is ready to remove the barrier of reaching Primordial Gold Core.\u201d\u201cThree sword essence notebooks left by the strong?\u201d Palace Master Whites smiled, with the normal expression.\u201cHum?\u201d When she saw the last thing on the list, she frowned.\u201cSword Skill of Blood and Fire?\u201d\u201cPeople start to study that when they have comprehended Sword Essence of Raging Fire, so why did Swordsman exchange for it?\u201dPalace Master White knew that Jian Wushuang had comprehended both sword essence of the Gale and the Earth, but he had never comprehended Sword Essence of Raging Fire.\u201cComprehending various sword essence at the same time can indeed result in stronger combat power, but everyone has limited energy, and becoming distracted will limit his achievements in the future. I hope this little guy is aware of this.\u201d\u201cMaybe he exchanged Sword Skill of Blood and Fire for someone else?\u201dPalace Master White secretly thought.Treasures in the Secret Pavilion of Dragon Palace could be exchanged by the disciples of Dragon Palace as long as they had enough points. As for the usage after exchanging, it depended on the disciple, as he could give this Sword Skill to others after he had exchanged for it.At this moment, Palace Master White also hoped that Jian Wushuang had exchanged Sword Skill of Blood and Fire for someone else.\u201d If he exchanged Sword Skill of Blood and Fire for himself, he would be too stupid.\u201dIn the manor, Jian Wushuang had been taken away by Wang Yuan for a drink as soon as he came back.\u201cThe third, took a full six months to complete this time.\u201d Wang Yuan sighed. \u201cTell me what were your tasks for Stage Two and Stage Three, and why did it take you so long to finish them?\u201dWithout any hesitation, Jian Wushuang directly told him his tasks and the process briefly.\u201cF*ck, ten Spirit Beasts of Exceptional Gold Core Realm?\u201d Wang Yu\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\u201cTen?\u201d Su Rou could not help gasping in astonishment.\u201cHave you finished?\u201d Wang Yuan asked again.\u201cOf course, how could I come back without finishing the tasks?\u201d Jian Wushuang laughed.\u201cSh*t, you are too strong,\u201d Wang Yuan smiled and said, \u201cYou are just at the level of Spiritual Sea Realm, even without a breakthrough of Gold Core, and you could kill ten Spirit Beasts of Exceptional Gold Core Realm. You are formidable.\u201d\u201cJust had good luck,\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled.Only he himself knew how hard and arduous it was in the past six months to complete the task of killing ten Spirit Beasts at the Level of Exceptional Gold Core Realm.\u201cAnd where is the Second?\u201d Jian Wushuang asked.When he came back, he saw Wang Yuan and Su Rou, without Yang Zaixuan.\u201cThe second\u2019s experience tasks were easier than yours, and he is also so powerful, so it took him only a month to finish all the tasks of three stages. However, he received a new experience task after he just returned Dragon Palace, and he hasn\u2019t come back yet, \u201cWang Yuan said.\u201cAnother experience task?\u201d Jian Wushuang sighed.\u201cThe second was stimulated by the Earth Dragon List and thus he is cultivating much more than anyone else,\u201d Wang said.\u201cEarthly Dragon List?\u201d Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.He also longed for a placing on the Earth Dragon List very much, but his strength was still far from it.\u201cThe second works very hard, so I also should work harder,\u201d Jian Wushuang smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zoom! Zoom!Streaks of scorching sword shadow were chopped out fiercely one after another and the high temperatures seemed to burn the air.Soon after, Jian Wushuang sheathed his sword and stood still.\u201cAs a 6000-point-valued sword skill, Sword Skill of Blood and Fire is way better than Formless Sword Wave in the term of power, and its moves are more exquisite. I can only execute the fifth move with my current ability. I have to study for a period of time before executing the sixth move,\u201d Jian Wushuang said to himself.However, it would definitely shock many if they knew that Jian Wushuang could execute the fifth move of Sword Skill of Blood and Fire.If a man could execute the fifth move of Sword Skill of Blood and Fire, it meant that he could pass the Seventh Level of Dragon Gate without difficulty.Everyone in the Dragon Palace knew that Jian Wushuang was most versed in the sword essences of both the Gale and the Earth.In addition, the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire was just exchanged from Secret Pavilion that day.\u2026Early morning the next day, Jian Wushuang entered the Hall of Fire, which was one of the Four Halls of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind.Today, a Palace Master would give a lesson in the fire temple. Although Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Sword Essence of Raging Fire for half a year, he comprehended it by himself. Therefore, in the Dragon Palace, he would listen carefully to the Palace Master.Casually sitting in the corner of the fire temple, Jian Wushuang relaxed with closed eyes and awaited the Palace Master. The surrounding Disciples of Dragon Palace looked at him from time to time with a weird gaze.\u201cHe\u2019s Swordsman. Why does he come here?\u201d\u201cPeople in the fire temple\u00a0comprehended the Fierce Fire Realm, but Jian Wushuang has comprehended the sword essence of Gale and Earth.\u201d\u201cDoes he want to comprehend the Fierce Fire Realm?\u201d\u201cA man can comprehend three realms at the same time. Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cSwordsman is too ambitious.\u201d\u201cHmm. The more ambitious he is, the more foolish he is. Trying three realms at the same time. Who is he?\u201d\u201cYou are right. It\u2019s exceedingly hard to comprehend two realms at the same time. Even a peerless genius would suffer from fatigue if he comprehended three realms.\u201dThose Disciples of Dragon Palace chatted with each other casually. Their voices were not loud, but not quiet, either. They did not care whether Jian Wushuang heard it or not.Whatever they said, Jian Wushuang didn\u2019t pay attention to them. He was still relaxing with closed eyes.Soon after, the Palace Master of the fire temple arrived. He looked at Jian Wushuang with amazement, and then sat and gave a lesson with his legs crossed.After an hour, this Palace Master of the fire temple\u00a0waved goodbye and the listeners started to leave.Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and a smile emerged.\u201cSince half a year ago, I have pored through the sword principle of Fierce Fire alone. I was confused about many things. However, the confusion has been cleared up after the Palace Master\u2019s lesson.\u201dJian Wushuang was satisfied with this lesson. He had benefited a lot from it and was enlightened in many aspects.After that, Jian Wushuang left.In the palaces of the Dragon Palace, white-robed Palace Master White was walking slowly.\u201cPalace Master White.\u201d A figure appeared suddenly in front of Palace Master White.\u201cTemple Master Yao.\u201d Palace Master White smiled. \u201cDid you finish your class?\u201d\u201cIt is finished. Their comprehension depends on themselves.\u201d Temple Master Yao gave a slight smile and said, \u201cI came here for a reason.\u201d\u201cI saw the little disciple Swordsman in the class when I was imparting knowledge,\u201d Temple Master Yao said directly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Palace Master White was shocked and said, \u201cDid Swordsman go to your class?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Temple Master Yao nodded and said, \u201cThe brat is noteworthy in the Dragon Palace. His potential absolutely could rank in the top five amongst all disciples of the Dragon Palace. That\u2019s why I informed you about him.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d A serious expression emerged on Palace Master White\u2019s face.\u201cThe next thing depends on you. You should exhort him not to waste much time comprehending the Fierce Fire Realm. I\u2019ll leave,\u201d Temple Master Yao said and then left.Palace Master White stood there with a saturnine and gloomy expression.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Swordsman would try to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Doing three things at the same time. Comprehending three sword essences at the same time? What is he thinking?\u201d Palace Master White gave a cold humph and then directly went to the manor where Jian Wushuang lived.In the manor, Jian Wushuang was practicing his sword skill diligently.\u201cSwordsman.\u201d Palace Master White appeared.\u201cPalace Master White.\u201d Jian Wushuang put away his sword and paid his respects.\u201cI have heard that you have exchanged for the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire in the Secret Pavilion yesterday and attended the class of Temple Master Yao. Do you want to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire?\u201d The expression of Palace Master White grew cold.\u201cYes.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cStupid! Idiot!\u201dPalace Master White was mad.\u201cThe Martial Arts way is fraught with troubles. You are a young talent and have deep comprehension of the sword essences of Gale and Earth. It\u2019s highly possible for you to combine the Gale Realm with Earth Realm in the future. You will be amongst the top ranks if you are in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. It\u2019s also likely for your strength to equal or even outclass the Palace Masters of the Four Halls of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind!\u201d\u201cYou are promising and our Dragon Palace also possesses the hope to cultivate one more top powerhouse.\u201d\u201cI have far higher expectations from you!\u201d\u201cBut now, you are so overconfident that you want to comprehend the Sword Essence of Raging Fire?\u201d The cold gaze hardened in Palace Master White\u2019s eyes.\u201cDo you know that nobody has endless energy? Doing two things at the same time is the limit. Doing three things at the same time is ridiculous\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that you think your strength will grow if you comprehend three sword essences at the same time. However, you will bear a greater burden!\u201d\u201cIn history, some geniuses of the Dragon Palace had a higher comprehension than you. However, they could only comprehend two realms at the same time. Yes, there have been geniuses who comprehended three realms at the same time, but do you know their results?\u201d\u201cTake Ling Wuxiao, a genius about ten years ago in the Dragon Palace, as an example. He was a matchless genius. He comprehended three realms at the same time and combined them perfectly. When he was in the Initial Gold Core Realm, he could kill a powerhouse who was in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm!\u201d\u201cHe was way better than you. However, his speed of comprehending the sword essence became slower and slower. His cultivation was even stalled in a small bottleneck for many years. And his speed of improvement was also lower and lower. Finally, he was overtaken by other geniuses\u2026\u201dHearing that, Jian Wushuang felt overwhelmed.He didn\u2019t realize that he would be excoriated as soon as Palace Master White met him.\u201cSwordsman, you should recognize that the road of cultivation will not be reset if you go awry.\u201d\u201cDo you understand what I said?\u201d Palace Master White looked at Jian Wushuang.\u201cI see.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded. Jian Wushuang was acquainted with what Palace Master White said.\u201cOkay. I have great faith in you. I believe that your future achievement will be greater than those of Bai Cheng and Su Lie. Therefore, you can\u2019t let me down.\u201d Palace Master White became calm.\u201cOkay. I have said what I should say. How you walk depends on you. Go ahead!\u201dAfter saying that, Palace Master White left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To learn three kinds of sword essence at the same time is to do three things simultaneously. It is too difficult. But that is only for ordinary geniuses, not for me!\u201dJian Wushuang didn\u2019t think he was superior and better than other geniuses. However his circumstances were quite different!\u201cI practice the Heavenly Creation Skill. It is a defiant form of cultivation. It is different from others!\u201d\u201cI have also awakened my Sword Soul and have completely mastered it, while others have not.\u201dJian Wushuang clearly knew what road he should take.The burden was really too heavy for others to master three kinds of sword essence at the same time. But it was easy for Jian Wushuang to do it for his Sword Soul which had awakened.After staying in the Innumerable Huge Mountains for half a year, he learned three kinds of sword essence at the same time, which was equal to doing three things simultaneously. But he still comprehended them at an amazingly fast speed, way beyond anyone\u2019s imagination.There were only three kinds of sword essence, which was definitely not his limit.If there was a chance, he was even eager to study the fourth Sword Essence of Dripping Water.\u201cAfter I have completely awakened Sword Soul, the speed at which I study the sword essence is much faster than others. With such a powerful Sword Soul, if I only concentrated on studying sword essence of the Gale and the Earth, I would be wasting all my talent.\u201d Jian Wushuang\u2019s eyes were resolute.He agreed with Palace Master White\u2019s opinion, but he would not follow that advice blindly.After all, he decided on what path he would take.Two days later, the Temple Master Yao in the Fire Temple gave another lecture, and Jian Wushuang went there to listen once more.When Jian Wushuang appeared again, Temple Master Yao showed a little weird expression.In the lecture, Temple Master Yao directly said, \u201cOn the road of Martial Arts, do not get distracted. It is necessary to remember to devote yourself to studying one road until the end. Then the ultimate result you will achieve will be much better than those who are distracted.\u201dTemple Master Yao casually said it, but many Disciples of Dragon Palace who listened to the lecture knew that he was talking about Jian Wushuang.So did Jian Wushuang. But he just shrugged with resignation.After Temple Master Yao finished his lecture, many Disciples of Dragon Palace went out of the temple one after another.After leaving, Jian Wushuang indistinctly heard people discussing.\u201cWho did you think the words of Temple Master Yao referred to in today\u2019s lecture?\u201d\u201cUndoubtedly, he referred to Swordsman.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess so. He is particularly gifted at sword essence of the Gale and the Earth. However, he is insatiable, even expecting to master the Sword Essence of Raging Fire?\u201d\u201cHe is so courageous that he could learn three kinds of sword essence at the same time. It has been so hard for me to obtain one kind of essence.\u201d\u201cIt is said that Palace Master White had warned him in person not to do too many things at one time. However, it is obvious that he is not following her advice.\u201d\u201cHum, he is too arrogant to follow the advice of Palace Master White.\u201dIn a manor of Dragon Palace, Nangong Jie as well as other two Disciples of Dragon Palace gathered together and talked about Jian Wushuang.\u201cHa ha, that Swordsman is so bold and naive that he doesn\u2019t even listen to Palace Master White. He insists on studying Sword Essence of Raging Fire. He will soon come to an unfortunate end.\u201d\u201cLearning three kinds of sword essence at the same time. Who does he think he is?\u201d\u201cWhat an idiot! I am treating him as my opponent but never expected that he is such an idiot!\u201d\u201cHa ha!\u201dNangong Jie crazily and madly laughed.He was very jealous of Jian Wushuang and bitterly hated Jian Wushuang.The reason for jealousy was that Jian Wushuang had made such great progress after he joined Dragon Palace for only three months.He hated that Jian Wushuang had defeated him in front of so many people that he lost all his face and his 12,000 points were gone.Now, Nangong Jie was very pleased to know that Jian Wushuang was so arrogant as to study Sword Essence of Raging Fire.However, Palace Master White who warned Jian Wushuang was furious after hearing that Jian Wushuang did not follow her advice and continued to study the Sword Essence of Raging Fire.\u201cBastard!\u201d\u201cArrogance!\u201d\u201cIgnorance!\u201d\u201cThis guy, does he really think he is so great?\u201dPalace Master White was so disappointed about this.There were lots of Disciples of Dragon Palace, even many outstanding and talented people, such as Bai Cheng and Su Lie who were senior people, and even Yang Zaixuan who passed the Eighth Level of Dragon Gate as soon as he came into Dragon Palace.However, she thought most highly of Jian Wushuang as he progressed so quickly and she hoped that he would obtain huge achievements in the future.But now, Jian Wushuang was not satisfied with sword essence of the Gale and the Earth. He insisted on studying Sword Essence of Raging Fire.How could she not be sad or angry?\u201cLet it go,\u201d Palace Master White suddenly calmed down and said, \u201cHe chooses his own way. Others can\u2019t force him to change. Since he wants to take the extreme way, just leave him alone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame given his talent.\u201d\u201cAlas ~\u201dPalace Master White slightly sighed and quickly stopped thinking about it.After that, she put Jian Wushuang to a lower level in her heart.In the manor.\u201cLao San, I hear a lot of Disciples of Dragon Palace talking about you, and they say you are at the fork of your cultivation. What\u2019s exactly going on?\u201d Wang Yuan asked with frowning.\u201cI also heard about it.\u201d Su Rou said.\u201cThere is nothing special,\u201d Jian Wushuang immediately told them briefly.\u201cLao San, Palace Master White had warned you in person not to study the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Should you not follow her advice?\u201d Wang Yuan asked feeling surprised.\u201cAlthough what Palace Master White said made sense, I\u2019m the one that knows myself best and exactly what to do next,\u201d Jian Wushuang replied.\u201cReally?\u201d Wang Yuan stopped frowning and immediately laughed. \u201cLao San, I trust you. Since you think this choice is right, it is certainly right. As for others, nobody cares what they are thinking. Even Palace Master White may be wrong.\u201dObviously, Wang Yuan disagreed with what Palace Master White said.\u201cI agree with you. You should go your own way. What other people say is just a reference,\u201d Su Rou said.Jian Wushuang felt touched and warmed to the bottom of his heart, affectionately looking at Wang Yuan and Su Rou.\u201cWell, it\u2019s time for you to work hard at cultivating. Then your strength will prove that you were right when others look at you,\u201d Wang Yuan said and laughed.\u201cOf course.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.As time passed, Jian Wushuang persisted in cultivating his own way, ignoring the Disciples of the Dragon Palace doubts.Whenever there was a Temple Master of Fire Temple using swords, Jian Wushuang would get there to listen to their lessons.Thus, his comprehension of the Sword Essence of Raging Fire did not fall behind at all.Seven days passed quickly.In his manor, Jian Wushuang finished practicing swordsmanship and was sitting beside the stone table. He took out a pot of wine and drank it.\u201cTen days passed \u2026 After getting the Bottleneck-breaking Elixir, I immediately swallowed it. But I didn\u2019t sense the sign of a breakthrough until now. It seems that the first Bottleneck-breaking Elixir is unable to take effect.\u201d Jian Wushuang secretly sighed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But it might not work. Jian Wushuang thought it was normal that he could not break through if he only took one Bottleneck-breaking Elixir.Therefore, Jian Wushuang swallowed another Bottleneck-breaking Elixir.\u201cI hope the second Bottleneck-breaking Elixir works.\u201d Jian Wushuang expected.At this moment\u2026\u201cHaha. It\u2019s so boring to drink alone.\u201d With a bright laugh, a burly scarlet-robed man who carried a saber was walking here.\u201cSu Lie?\u201d Jian Wushuang lifted his brow.\u201cWhy are you so free to come here today?\u201d Jian Wushuang invited Su Lie to sit down with a smile and then took out a pot of wine.As for Su Lie, Jian Wushuang did not mind him and even had a favorable view of him.Although Su Lie had vanquished him in front of many people, it was a fair defeat using Su Lie\u2019s strength without any tricks or schemes. Jian Wushuang accepted it.It was a good thing for him to be vanquished by Su Lie because he could have a deeper understanding of the Dragon Palace at least.\u201cActually, it is Palace Master White that let me come here,\u201d Su Lie took up the wine above the desk and directly said.\u201cPalace Master White?\u201d Jian Wushuang was surprised.\u201cTo be honest, Palace Master White has faith in you. After hearing about you comprehending the Sword Essence of Raging Fire, she immediately exhorted you not to do it. But you ignored it. She asked me to come here because she didn\u2019t want to lower herself to exhort you again,\u201d Su Lie said with a smile.\u201cOkay. I see.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded and said, \u201cWhat Palace Master White said makes sense. However, I have my own reasons to insist on doing this.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Su Lie laughed and said, \u201cTherefore, I don\u2019t want to remind you further. However, I have to let you know that was following the directive of Palace Master White when I competed with you last time.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Jian Wushuang was really surprised.Was it Palace Master White that ordered Su Lie to violently compete with him last time?\u201cAs a rookie, it might not be a good thing to be too outstanding. Therefore, Palace Master White asked me to dampen your pride. In fact, it was good for you,\u201d Su Lie said.\u201cAh?\u201d Jian Wushuang immediately understood.The birth of the expert was like iron tempering iron.\u201cSo, Swordsman. Palace Master White is truly good to you. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t follow her advice, but you must work hard. You should be sure not to let her down,\u201d Su Lie said.\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201d Jian Wushuang nodded.\u201cHaha. You should certainly do so. I have said what I came here to say. I have also drunk wine. Now, I have to leave.\u201d Su Lie smiled and then left.In front of the stone table, Jian Wushuang sat there alone, staring at the flagon with calm.\u201cWhat Su Lie said is right. Palace Master White is good to me. I can\u2019t let her down.\u201d\u201cNow \u2026 I should verify that the road I chose is right!\u201dThe top rule of the world was that whoever possessed the strongest strength was the king.Now, everyone looked down on him and regarded him as a man filled with hubris. Nobody would dare to doubt him if his strength improved to an unprecedented height.This kind of strength needed proof.In the Dragon Palace, the most suitable place to verify his strength was the Dragon Gate.\u2026In front of the huge golden penthouse, after entering Dragon Palace, two disciples of Dragon Palace were casually chatting with each other.\u201cVery good. You even competed with the level keeper on the fifth floor for such a long time. You will complete the sixth floor soon.\u201d\u201cHaha. Not too bad. It\u2019s better than last time at least.\u201dThe two disciples of Dragon Palace were on the fifth floor but their talents were just average in Dragon Palace.Suddenly, the black-robed young man Jian Wushuang slowly walked over carrying a long sword.\u201cLook. Swordsman!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him. Does he also want to enter the Dragon Gate Pass?\u201dThe two disciples stopped and looked toward Jian Wushuang. Under their gazes, Jian Wushuang directly entered the Dragon Gate.\u201cHe has entered the Dragon Gate! Which floor will he be able to reach?\u201d\u201cAt least the sixth floor. He has the strength to make it after he vanquished Nangong Jie. Now six months have passed, passing the seventh floor is not a surprise!\u201dThe two disciples were talking. They did not hurry to leave, quietly waiting.In the Dragon Gate, Jian Wushuang began at the fifth floor because he had gone through the fourth floor last time.The level guardian of the fifth floor was a green-robed man who had comprehended the Earth Sword Essence.Jian Wushuang was defeated by the green-robed man when he went through the Dragon Gate Pass first time. Now nine months had passed, Jian Wushuang competed with him again. However, the green-robed man was defeated by Jian Wushuang with just one move.Jian Wushuang went through the fifth floor of the Dragon Gate.Following the sixth floor\u2026In a magnificent palace, Palace Master White sat on a chair and flicked through a book.The book recorded the comprehensions of a top expert. Palace Master White had been studying it closely over this period.Although she was a master of the Dragon Palace, there were still powerhouses stronger than her in term of strength within Tianzong Dynasty. Thus, she had to continue to cultivate.Suddenly, the gate of the palace was opened.\u201cYour Excellency. Palace Master.\u201d A purple-robed servant rushed in front of Palace Master White.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Palace Master White put down the book and looked toward the purple-robed servant.\u201cIt\u2019s Swordsman. He is going through the Dragon Gate,\u201d the purple-robed servant replied.\u201cSwordsman?\u201d Palace Master White raised her eyebrows. In the past, she did think highly of Jian Wushuang. But now, the status of Jian Wushuang in her heart was lower than before. However, she still asked, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising for Jian Wushuang to go through the Dragon Gate because he is a disciple of the Dragon Palace.\u201d\u201cHe has gong through the eighth floor,\u201d the purple-robed servant said.\u201cSo what?\u201d Palace Master White still did not care.\u201cBut he went through the eighth floor merely by virtue of his Sword Essence of Raging Fire,\u201d the purple-robed servant said again.\u201cWhat?\u201d Palace Master White changed her expression.If Jian Wushuang merely went through the eighth floor, Palace Master White would not be surprised. After all, Jian Wushuang could almost go through the seventh floor when he vanquished Nangong Jie. He would surely make a great progress with his talent after going outside to cultivate for six months.Palace Master White expected Jian Wushuang to pass through the eighth floor.However, it was totally different if he went through the eighth floor merely by virtue of his Sword Essence of Raging Fire.It should be known that Jian Wushuang initially comprehended the sword essences of the Gale and the Earth. The Sword Essence of Raging Fire was comprehended later. She was angry about it. Jian Wushuang could go through the eighth floor merely by the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Which floor would he go through if he also executes the sword essences of the Gale and the Earth?\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Palace Master White stood and looked at the purple-robed servant solemnly.\u201cIt\u2019s true. The level keeper of the eighth floor told me that,\u201d the purple-robed servant replied.After obtaining verification from the purple-robed servant, the expression of Palace Master White grew more solemn.\u201cGo. Go to the Dragon Gate!\u201dPalace Master White forsook what she was doing and directly walked toward the Dragon Gate.At the same time, it completely shocked the whole Dragon Gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
