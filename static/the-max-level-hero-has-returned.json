There was a time when strong people dominated an era only through their presence and their names. There was an emperor who established his empire and the leaders of many men. There were medical clinics that saved countless patients, there were strong people who didn\u2019t seem like they belonged anywhere, and there were people who were praised by many others.There were warriors who defeated the devil, and there was a man named \u2018Cheonma\u2019 who unified the continent with his power, increasing the noble\u2019s influence. However, when Davey heard about them, he spoke both confidently and firmly.\u201cHeroes? Ah, they take ten-year-old kids and push them around as far as they can, and if they don\u2019t like it, they\u2019ll start beating them like a dog.\u201d\u201cWhen they\u2019re forced to become stronger and reach a certain ground, they\u2019ll hand out another task and start pushing them again.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll throw humans into lava, hang them off a cliff, and right into a fire pit. And they\u2019ll tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good!\u201d You\u2019re talking about those nobles, right?\u201dWhether they were a hero or an outstanding human being, most of them certainly had some screws missing!It felt like a thousand years to the soul! It was already six years later when the powerless chamber prince, Davey, returned to his original body.The frigging Corridor.[Half a day after arriving at the Hall of Heroes.]The Corridor of Heroes, or Hall of Heroes. It looked like a place where the souls of legendary heroes and great men who remained in legends and myth lingered. Apparently, it was an underworld space designed to elevate the pride of those who accomplished great achievements. Nobody knew who had built this place. Everyone seemed to have curious expectations for me, but the truth was, there were no outstanding factors that made me a hero.[Third day after arriving at the Hall of Heroes]Even the heroes who had been sleeping woke up after hearing that a new kid had arrived. Apparently, there weren\u2019t a lot of new recruits because there weren\u2019t many qualified people. Of course, they must\u2019ve had thought I had some sort of great achievement to end up here. A child who was only about ten years old was amazed and danced excitedly around.I felt guilty because I didn\u2019t have much of anything, but I might get fired back if I told them, so I instinctively shut my mouth.[A week after arriving at the Hall of Heroes]He patted me on the back and gave cringy compliments every time we met. Ignorant man. He was so strong that it honestly felt like he was trying to break my shoulders. Sometimes I saw them doing some play fighting, but they were playing on a continental scale\u2026I was getting even more scared. If they find out that I\u2019m an ordinary person that has nothing\u2026[Two weeks after arriving at the Hall of Heroes]I got caught\u2026[A month after arriving at the Hall of Heroes]It was cold. A dagger then flew out and pierced my heart. But no worries\u2026no, not this. I was an ordinary human being that had nothing, so I shouldn\u2019t get a ticket to a place like this. I seemed to have scratched their pride.[A month and fifteen days after arriving at the Hall of Heroes]They were noblemen in their own way, and they didn\u2019t bother me anymore, but I still didn\u2019t feel comfortable with their stares. I couldn\u2019t even swallow my food anymore because they treated me like a useless person. Those who are already dead and left with only their souls and heroes who once enjoyed their era. Why were they so cheap with their food?[Two months after arriving at the Hall of Heroes]There wasn\u2019t much happening, but I still felt bothered by the way they looked at me like I was a useless person, so I ended up yelling and getting upset, which had soon become the source of more trouble. I should\u2019ve just kept my mouth shut\u2026[Two months and three days after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]They had ongoing meetings the past few days to figure out why I had come here without any power or achievement. It was already the third day of quiet meetings. You could hear them fighting and shouting at each other if you moved close to the door of the huge hall. I began to worry that they might blow my head off, for the reason that I deceived them.After a long time, the meeting ended. I couldn\u2019t say anything as I watched them return with a grim face.[Two months and fifteen days after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]Finally, someone came to me. It was the big man who brought a bag full of delicious snacks and urged me to eat them when I first came here.\u201cI decided to comply with your request. It\u2019s not even your fault in the first place, but it\u2019s funny that we\u2019re getting upset about it. It has been so boring until now, so this is fun? You\u2019re our family now, so I\u2019ll take responsibility for you, follow me.\u201dThat was how it started.[It had been a year after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.][If the new kid who arrived at the corridor isn\u2019t a hero, he can be raised to be a hero no matter what the situation is!]The big guy\u2019s name was Hercules. He said that he would give me survival training. I thought that I heard a similar name somewhere, but\u2026 I was afraid this wasn\u2019t the same. I followed his words to just believe in him, that he would make me perfect, and I regretted it exactly half a day later.One year.There was the time he threw me into a forest full of unidentified monsters and left me unattended! Poisoned food\u2026water\u2026predators attacking day and night are all over the place\u2026they were all terrible. They wanted to help before I was nearly dead.[Two years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]I was surviving in the desert.[Three years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]It looked like I was in a tunnel this time. The sharp teeth of a medium-sized sandworm that broke through the wall yesterday to chew on my body were still vivid in my mind. I didn\u2019t know what it had picked up and eaten, but even though its body was strong, its teeth were all ruined.[Seven years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]God damn Hercules![Twelve years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]During the survival training over the last ten years, my body hadn\u2019t grown a centimeter or aged one bit. What should I do with that giant who\u2019s dancing and saying that I\u2019ve grown more than he expected? He patted my exhausted back and said something scary to me as if it was nothing.\u201cAlright! This is enough for my training! I won\u2019t be embarrassed to call you my disciple with those skills! Pahahahaha! Then let\u2019s go to the next training with the old sword god!\u201dI should have put my fist in the man\u2019s face\u2026[Twelve years and a day after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]He told me that it would be an older man, but he was quite young and outgoing. I wasn\u2019t saying it because I had a 10-year-old kid\u2019s body, but my past life, present life, and life at the Hall of Heroes combined weren\u2019t really very short. Guided only by Hercules, who only liked doing whatever he wanted, the man was like a loose cannon who didn\u2019t look serious at all.The man seemed to be a legendary figure who remained in the ancient books of the continent of Tionis, where I was reborn. He used to be an average person, but the gentleman held a sword and soon became the sword god. Haris was a lot more fun and sharper than the stern image I was expecting.Haris, I was sure I had heard the name before.He was a great man who had some considerable achievements, so I had some fantasies, but it took less than a day for them to break down. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t the sword god, but the god of laziness instead.[Fifteen years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]A near-disaster talent. That was what Hercules had said, so I guess I had some pretty good talent. What he offered to teach me were his now forgotten sword skills. Thanks to Hercules, it wouldn\u2019t be as hard as the first time, but\u2026in a different sense, it fit well with the expression \u201chell.\u201dI shouldn\u2019t have caught the wooden sword and metal bag he threw me\u2026[Twenty-five years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]That damn sword! The sword alone made me want to vomit! I never wanted to hear the sound of a sword swing again![Forty years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]Sure, I had my own talent, but it still took some time to surprise him. He seemed to be appalled, but I\u2019d still have to invest decades of training to beat him at this rate.[Sixty years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]I met a man who called himself the spirit of archery. He had a cheesy face and voice. Even his personality was the same. He kept calling out to a woman named Daphne, a saint whom he loved. I think I got a hard one in store this time.Why wasn\u2019t I running away? If dozens of people came looking for me with their eyes lit up, I would just be a flea in a bottle.[Eighty years after causing trouble at the Hall of Heroes.]P\u2026Please! Sa-save me\u2026[One-hundred-and-twenty years since I fell into this shit.]My dream came true. Yeah, I survived for a long time, but I didn\u2019t feel alive here.[One-hundred-and-seventy years since I fell into this shit.]Except for the heroes who had lost interest and fell asleep again, most of them were committed to training, which was actually just torture in disguise. Magic, spears, swordplay, chains. Fighting\u2026work! Among them, there was an absolute psycho called the revolutionary wizard, a woman named Odin. It was a place where only the exceptionally crazy gathered\u2026[Two-hundred years since I fell into this shit.]I met Hercules during my training. I tried to pierce a hole in his stomach with a bamboo spear, but when I finally came to my senses, I was already in a deserted field. Apparently, his powers as a survival expert were the highest among the heroes in this place.[Three-hundred years since I fell into this shit.]I was getting tired of trying to master martial arts with my ignorant head. That must\u2019ve been why I got a psychosomatic disease. One of the heroes who was observing my condition had said there might be a solution and brought someone who was asleep. She was called the god of medicine.Her name was Hippocrates\u2026 which also seemed to be a strangely familiar. However, it did sound like it had been changed. What conversation did she have with Hercules? She said it\u2019s time for my medicine. While undergoing her new acupuncture treatment, she asked if I was interested in learning medicine.[Three-hundred-and-fifty years.]Acupuncture, surgical medicine, blood vessels. Completely curing different symptoms of diseases. I was learning whatever she threw at me. She told me this time that there would be some scary training.My talent was shining through!

What was interesting was that the memories of my past and present life still remained clear. I had started to stare into the sky more often now. The Hall of Heroes was dark at night, but the afternoon skies proved to be so beautiful.Suddenly, I started to wonder why I was being pushed around, struggling, and being beaten up every-day trying to learn these things. I couldn\u2019t even get out of here anyway. Even if heroes could create something new using their knowledge, it was impossible to transfer existing knowledge, but I was starting to think there were no such restrictions on me. Was that why? They were sitting around trying to push me![Seven-hundred years]They said that time was the cure to all ailments, and I started to relate to that a little bit. I had become a loafer, and it felt like I had returned to the time when I first arrived at this place. Acting all serious didn\u2019t suit me. They had been living as spirits for thousands of years, so I guess I was becoming one of them. I wondered why they were so frivolous even though they were quite old, but they would say it was because of time.Daphne had come to see me. She was the saint who repeatedly cast hundreds of curses on me to teach me about divine magic and the curse system. She looked strangely happy, as if she had kicked the flirty Apollo in the groin. She said she wanted to drink with me because she found some good alcohol. However\u2026something felt weird.It was almost as if she was trying to hide something.[Nine-hundred and fifty years]Most of the heroes who trained me then came to see me. Even the God Ko-Jun, who never showed up because he was the lazy King of Conquest and boasted every time he drank that he was a great emperor, had come to see me. Most of them were heroes who used to be involved with me, and they were also people who had tortured me under the guise of training.Why did they train me like that? I couldn\u2019t even leave this place anyway. If I tried asking that question before, I would\u2019ve been beaten near death. When I greeted them with a grumpy face, the goddess who used to take care of me most, Hippocrates, gave me a faint smile. This woman wasn\u2019t interested in me before, but she started taking care of me as if she were my real sister.It was an unexpected banquet. Everyone was chatting for several days. Hippocrates, who had been sipping alcohol, quietly spoke, and the banquet came to an end.\u201cOur youngest. I found a way for you to go back.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything to her for a while. I felt strange.[Nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine years]I think today was my birthday. It had been a long time since I forgot how old I was, but there was still a small anniversary.They then began to unite. They didn\u2019t tell me the reason, or why, or how. They were separate beings who could no longer interfere with the world. They were the type of people who wouldn\u2019t do anything or work together even if the world collapsed right now. But somehow, they decided to unite with each other for the second time. The people who used to scold me all the time suddenly started to say good things and be nice to me as if they were high.The day had finally come.I asked them what they wanted to do, and they would tell me that they wanted to eat well and live a good life. It looked like they took the first step toward achieving that dream. This was a safe place if you had power, but you wouldn\u2019t feel alive. They asked me if I had anything to say for the last time.In one corner, Yuriana, the master spirit who tried to throw me into the pool of magma after being immersed in the deep sea, was starting to cry.Sigh\u2026I was starting to feel bad for no reason\u2026As they were asking me questions calmly, my body began to get surrounded by a light, regardless of my thoughts on the matter. This must be my last time. I thought and smiled at them.\u201cLet\u2019s never see each other again! And how long were you old grandmas expecting me to call you\u2019 sister\u2019?\u201dIt was quite refreshing to see their last expressions. The most furious of all was the saint, Daphne.\u201cHey! You Fu*king idiot\u2026\u201dHowever, they shut their mouths when they noticed the sorrow I was feeling. I didn\u2019t want to leave them crying. I smiled at those who waved at me. And then, the world changed.* * *Flap!!!\u201cHaaa\u2026haaa\u2026\u201dI looked around blankly at my surroundings, almost as if I had awoken from a long dream. My blurry vision was blindingly painful to the point of tears as I hadn\u2019t seen the light in a long time. As I lowered my blurry eyes, I saw a strange liquid flowing from an IV into my arm.[Restore.]A short murmur. Contrary to my expectations, no changes occurred at my fingertips. Everything was starting to feel real now. I had escaped from the Hall of Heroes and returned to my original body, Prince Davey.The return of the prince.I couldn\u2019t think of how to explain it. When reality struck, I lost strength in my body and closed my eyes again. I wanted my mind to be blank for the time being because the sense of exhaustion was eroding my whole body. The rough but strangely cozy blanket was also tempting me never to leave the bed.To be exact, I didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a finger. After lying for a while, my vision slowly began to adjust. My focus was blurry, so I wasn\u2019t sure if my eyesight had returned completely yet, but I thought this was okay.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dWhen I struggled to speak, a raspy voice came out. It was a muffled sound, but it was clear. Even though I came back after a thousand years, I still had a clear memory of it, so I smiled bitterly.\u201cAh\u2026Ahhhh. Ahhhhhh~\u201dWhen I started to make a voice as if I were practicing vocalization, my cracked voice began to change slowly as if it were adjusting.\u201cAhhhh.\u201dI repeated that for a while. Now that I was able to pronounce words properly, a familiar but slightly different voice came to my ears. They said my voice sounded mellow, but honestly, it was just a plain voice that didn\u2019t sound too bad.\u201cRestore.\u201dOne more try. There was no significant change this time as well. However, I wasn\u2019t feeling impatient. Since I was tortured under the guise of training for a thousand years, I had experienced all kinds of situations. Of course, I had experienced this situation before.\u201cHia once said that when a person falls into a coma, you slowly lose your muscles, and it was the same for mana and divine power.\u2019I was the only person who called Hippocrates, the God of medicine, \u2018Hia.\u2019 What could I do? She asked me to call her that. If it was unfair for them, then one should try and befriend her.Hia taught me medicine with her unique ability and let me treat numerous patients. Among them, there were definitely patients in my current situation. The solution was\u2026\u2018Time.\u2019It wasn\u2019t good to restore muscles that had been damaged due to a lack of nutrition in a short time. Eating in a hurry would make you sick. I had to build up physical strength so I could move my own body. Fortunately, the IV stuck in my arm was providing me with some nutrition. You could possibly starve to death if someone didn\u2019t come to feed you when you couldn\u2019t even move.Such a situation wasn\u2019t welcoming for me either. When I thought of it, I felt relaxed and smiled. I laid down comfortably, smirked, and began to focus on flicking my fingers. I think they say that rehabilitation training starts from your fingers. Now I just wanted to be immersed in the fact that I had come back.* * *No one came into that quiet room for days. No, it would be very rare for anyone to enter this palace, where I was located. Even if someone did come in, it would\u2019ve been one or two maids in charge of my nutritional supplements. I think it was like that before I fell into a coma and went to the Hall, so it seemed unlikely that it had changed.When I reached out a shaky hand and looked at the wooden calendar, I saw the time [Baldis Calendar year 278]. I had been shot by an arrow during a hunting competition held in the year 272. I immediately arrived at the Hall of Heroes that time, so it had been about six years since then.If so, it meant that I was sixteen now. By the standards of this continent, it also meant that I was at the age of adulthood. The thousand years I spent in the Hall of Heroes were only six years here. Was it because time ran differently? Or was there some other reason? Whatever it may be, it was a familiar phenomenon that time was indeed different.If one left Earth and went to space right now, time would still be different. However, of course, this wasn\u2019t Earth. This was a different dimension from Earth called the Tionis Continent, and this was my hometown during my second life. It was a hell of a place, but it was a place where people lived.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be laying down for too long.\u201dI started to concentrate slowly with my eyes closed even though I was mumbling. Except for the time when I was doing my rehabilitation training, this is what I usually did. It was hard to lift a finger at first, but thanks to my constant effort, I was able even to raise my upper body after a few days. Of course, the difficulties leading up to the process proved to be beyond explanation.Just because I was used to pain didn\u2019t mean that this was easy for me.\u201cRestore.\u201dI closed my eyes and focused, lifting the white energy that was asleep in my body.Divine power.In the words of the saint Daphne, my divine power couldn\u2019t reach those who were naturally born with it. However, nobody would be able to reach my level, given my proficiency. Even those famous popes or saints. That meant that I was short of power.In Daphne\u2019s case, she was a hero who would remain in history since she had to learn how to harness her God-given powers by herself. The reason I acquired as much power as I had was due to her hard teachings. Of course, it was natural that nobody could reach my powers, as most people build their divine power slowly by praying. Divine power was just another form of power. It was impossible to build it up quickly just by praying.In fact, that woman with a bad personality rarely praised God when she taught me. Tsk, tsk. And they call her a full-fledged saint.\u2026She probably trained me to use divine power so she could get me to clean the entire hall. I calmly tried to use the divine power, but there was nothing happening.\u201cStop being so stubborn.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I had gotten used to using magic, but it was useless without its main source, which was mana. Fortunately, most of my powers arrived safely with my soul. The problem was that it was hard as a rock, and it would take a long time until I could use it. I had clearly heard that it would take some time to loosen these hardened things.\u2018Move.\u2019I uttered basic divine magic to express my strong will.\u201cRestore.\u201dHowever, there was still no change.\u2018Move.\u2019At this point, I thought it would be time for even a small amount to come out, but it was too stubborn. Once it started to flow, it would accelerate and wake up on its own, but the start wasn\u2019t at all easy. They say that the beginning was half the battle. It would be a lie if it weren\u2019t this difficult. If it were stubborn, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it.The stubborn power was shameless. However, I kept asking for it to awaken.\u2018Move.\u2019Once again, when I spoke with a strong will, I felt as if my hardened divine power flinched very weakly. It was very weak, but I wouldn\u2019t miss out on the opportunity. I held back my laughter and tried it once again. I asked the stubborn divine power politely.\u2018Get a move on before I really explode.\u2019Whoooosh!!!Flash!!I heard something crack in my body. At the same time, my eyes opened wide. I couldn\u2019t miss this opportunity.\u201cRestore!\u201dAfter shouting fiercely, the divine power, which had currently been moving weakly, finally began to move more powerfully. The warm white energy slowly escaped from the hardened divine mass and began to wrap around my body. I was delighted as I finally succeeded in moving the divine power.\u201cNice!\u201dIf others saw me, they would think that I was lying in bed talking nonsense like a crazy person. But it was whatever. There was no one watching anyway. The Restore magic, which wrapped around the entire body as if it were a warm blanket, was a basic form of divine magic that healed inner wounds. The structure itself was simple, so it was magic that most priests who accepted divine power could use. But of course, if you ignore basic magic, you would see little efficiency.The characteristic of divine magic was unlike other magic in that it could increase the level of lower magic and amplify the effect. That\u2019s why there was a difference between the \u2018restore\u2019 of the high-ranking priest and the \u2018restore\u2019 of new priests.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dDid they say it was an equivalent exchange? Even though a lot of physical strength was used to boost recovery, this power couldn\u2019t be regarded as fraudulent magic. Increasing recovery by consuming physical strength could be a dangerous act that might be harmful to patients like me. However, I didn\u2019t stop.Whoo\u2026whoo!As the white light slowly dissipated, my senses slowly began to return to the side of my leg. And when it completely disappeared, I was satisfied that my toes could finally move. The first was my toes. The second was my ankles, and the third was my knees. I slowly lifted myself up while trying not to overdo it. I desperately felt like I was in danger, like I was going to collapse right away if I wasn\u2019t holding on to anything.\u201cRestore.\u201dOf course, I wouldn\u2019t just stop here. After using restore once again, I was starting to feel hungry. However, if I suddenly increased the number of fluids that provided me nutrition, it would only be a matter of time before my body started to break down. The effect of the restoration was remarkably beginning to heal the body and show noticeable changes.When I raised my body very slowly, I started to feel a strange joy. This was how parents probably felt when they saw their baby crawling around and slowly standing up! Although, considering it, this was my body. As I raised my body by supporting myself with one hand on the wall, my view slowly widened.\u201cHmm, the air above is better.\u201dI was saying useless things as I tried to move slowly and softly. Then, I looked out the window. Although I couldn\u2019t see any signs of people, the sun in the sky was shining brightly as if it were showing off its presence.\u201cOh, I really wanted to try this.\u201dI stood upright with my legs. Then I raised my hands at a 45-degree angle towards the sky and opened my palms. It looked like the letter \u201cY\u201d of the alphabet.\u201cPr\u2026\u201dStrongly!\u201cPraise the sun!Rattle.Shatter!At the same time, there was the sound of the door opening from behind me and glass shattering on the ground.\u201cAhhhh?!\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dGreat timing. As I turned my head slowly and stiffly, I saw a small girl with a frightened look. She looked like she was in her mid-teens. Given that she worked as a maid, she must be the daughter of a poor man. It was weird to say this since I was a mid-teen myself, but I thought she was still a little too young to work as a maid. Perhaps it was because of the unexpected and embarrassing situation, but the strength in my legs gave way, and my body collapsed. I could see the girl running with a scream.\u201cPrince! Wake up!\u201dI lowered my head without even thinking about responding. I wished she hadn\u2019t seen me like this\u2026\u201cHa, just put me back into a coma\u2026\u201d* * *\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dAn older man with a suspicious look on his face swept a hand through his beard. The older man\u2019s name was Ramdas. He was a man from the royal court. He had the position of examining the king\u2019s personal safety and preventing the king from getting sick.\u201cYou\u2019re quite a strange one; the condition of your body is surprisingly better. Are you experiencing any pain you\u2019re not telling me about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay, just a little tired.\u201dWhen I answered calmly, he nodded with satisfaction. If I were living in my previous life, I wouldn\u2019t have thought of treating an older man so rude. However, this life was different. I didn\u2019t like it, but I understood my current status.Davey Al Rown.It was the full name given to me since birth. I am a \u2018Rown,\u2019 a member of the royal family of the most insignificant kingdom. As you may have noticed, those who used the surname \u2018Rown\u2019 in the Kingdom had one thing in common: We were royals. Among them, I was the first son of the king. It felt weird to say it myself, but I was the first prince of the nation.\u201cHmmm\u2026 How tenacious.\u201dI heard a sharp voice while I was lying in bed blankly, and my eyes turned. What I saw at the end of my gaze was a woman with a fancy look and a fierce impression. Behind her were two boys that looked as if they were laughing at me.The current queen, Liness Varietta. And her sons, the second prince Carlos and third prince Benedict.\u201cI agree. I didn\u2019t know that my body was this strong either.\u201d\u201cRight, did you see the ungrateful man who shot the arrow at you?\u201d\u201cNot really. The arrow came flying out of nowhere. Oh, did you capture him? Because he\u2019s a big sinner.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d She answered with a lot of meaning, and she spread her fan to cover half of her face. She was trying to hide her frown.Queen Liness. Her name was Liness Varietta before she became queen, and she was the eldest daughter of the\u201cWe\u2019re all done. I\u2019ve done the basic treatment. You can call the priest regularly for treatment, and you will recover in a few years. From tomorrow morning, you can start giving meals to Prince Davey. I\u2019ll send you a special fluid diet so that it\u2019s easy on his stomach.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWhen he answered calmly, Ramdas bowed his head and got up from his seat with a stern face.\u201cI shall take my leave.\u201dWhen the maid followed him, there were only Queen Liness, Prince Carlos, and Prince Benedict left in the room. Silence hung heavy in the room because we didn\u2019t have a good relationship.\u201cYou should\u2019ve just died like that\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you disappointed that an eyesore came back to life?\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dThe light voice then caused Queen Liness\u2019s eyebrows to wriggle. However, I was still the prince, and she was the queen. Originally, it was a mother-son relationship, but everyone knew that my relationship with Queen Liness wasn\u2019t so comfortable.Slam!When Queen Liness stormed out, Carlos and Benedict, who looked like they were laughing, quietly followed.\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that the first prince will never be in the kingdom again when he was attacked and put into a coma. Let\u2019s go, Benedict.\u201dWith repeated provocations.The room suddenly calmed down. It was so calm that I thought it was too much for the room of a person who woke up after sleeping for nearly six years, but I didn\u2019t say it because it was almost too sad. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t the scene I was used to before I fell into a coma. To be cool-headed, this was far better.\u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace to the kingdom.\u201dAs I slowly controlled by divine power with my eyes closed and with a smirk, I could feel the warmth of my body again. Although I was openly using divine magic, it was safe to say that there was no person who could notice the divine power in this imperial palace.It was the same logic that it is difficult to see through the essence of the opponent if there was too much of a difference in the level of power. Was it because I had put all my attention into recovering my body right after I woke up? Even if it weren\u2019t easy to move right now, it would be possible to walk around within a few days. Mana would gradually accelerate the speed and regain its original form alongside the divine power.It was clear that my recovery would gradually accelerate.* * *I spent about two weeks bedridden without being able to go anywhere. Perhaps it was because I had been focusing on recovering, but it felt like time was rapidly flying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone would be shocked when they heard that a prince lying in bed for more than six years in a coma could now move like this. Of course, my bones were damaged, and my muscles were almost gone, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to recover easily, even with the priest\u2019s continued healing magic.Moreover, most of the priests who had come for treatment were Queen Liness\u2019s people. And so, they didn\u2019t perform proper healing. Yeah, to put it bluntly, this castle was a very indecent place. As the queen wanted to kill the prince, there was no such thing as family affection.We used to be family in the past because we proved to be partners that had to spend our whole lives together. Because of this, I approached them personally and believed in them. It didn\u2019t take much time to understand that was a stupid judgment. The first life on earth and the second life at this place were different.There was no such thing as family love in this country, where people sold their children for the sake of instant success and used them as tools for a political marriage. They didn\u2019t give a shit.Of course, not all nobles were like that. In fact, Queen Liness was a woman who cared so much for her own sons. But what if they weren\u2019t blood-related? What if he was the one who was standing in the way of her biological son?Queen Liness wasn\u2019t my biological mother. She was a person with distinctly different blood than I. My mother, who used to be the queen, was killed by someone who poisoned her about five years after I was born. They failed to catch the criminal, and my mother\u2019s death ended in grief.It was Queen Liness who took over my mother\u2019s position afterward. She was an ambitious woman that wanted to get rid of me, the son of the former queen, and push her son to be the next king. Of course, she was also a woman that had power. In the Kingdom of Rown, the maternal relatives had the strongest power, with the Duke of Liness\u2019s direct family was none other than the Duke of Varietta. Unless you were an idiot, you would understand that they were in cahoots.In the meantime, my life had been quite monotonous. Mana, divine power, and command mana used to increase my recovery. I had exercised in my spare time to restore my body\u2019s muscles. In addition to this, I quickly sought recovery by eating all the meals that the chambermaid Amy brought.Recovery magic used immediate divine power and showed a tremendous pace of recovery. For me, who had learned the knowledge of Hippocrate and studied extremely hard about the human body and the medicine directly under them, this recovery wasn\u2019t a very difficult challenge.In the process, my appetite had improved so much that I was excitedly forgetting the budget allocated to the prince\u2019s castle, but who could say anything about it when it was my money anyway?\u201cStill, they probably took more than half of the money that was supposed to come in.\u201dYou could tell by looking at the condition of the castle. Who would think of this place as the first Prince\u2019s castle? There was a lot of split marble on the floor, and weeds were sticking out. Compared to other places in the royal castle, it was as good as a deserted house. The appearance of the royal castle was a great disadvantage to the prince\u2019s reputation, that was, to my image and position. However, it wouldn\u2019t change unless I replaced the people who were taking half of my money.Therefore, recovery was important. No matter what I wanted, my body needed to be healthy. Revenge on the useless second Prince and third Prince, who were believed to have caused me to fall into a coma, and Queen Liness, who was believed to have caused the death of my mother. I had the freedom to because I had become quite a strong man.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dWhen sweat poured out of my body like rain because of the exercise, I raised my hand without saying a word and chanted.\u201cClean.\u201dWith a short murmur, droplets of water appeared in the air, covering my whole body, and soon my body was washed clean and turned cool. Magic was a fairly convenient power. Wasn\u2019t there a saying that laziness was the key to scientific development? Odin, who taught me magic, told me that, but I believed in it very much.\u201cPrince. It\u2019s me, Amy.\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dAfter organizing the messy clothes and lying on the bed, Amy, a girl with a very stern face, came in with her head down. In this royal castle, I was more known as the black sheep instead of the prince. Both nobles and servants ignored me behind my back, so Amy was quite faithful in that sense.\u201cI brought you a meal.\u201dHer calm words made me smile.\u201cThank you.\u201dI didn\u2019t reject courtesy. Amy, at least not this long after she came to this castle, was the only one who didn\u2019t get involved in dirty politics. For now, anyway. Apparently, she had been demoted to this place because she was sent out of the queen\u2019s sight while working at the castle.\u201cThe first prince\u2019s castle is a place where servants get demoted to\u2026 this is a mess.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You did a good job. Go back and rest for today.\u201d\u201cBut Prince, today\u2019s rehabilitation training\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that, so go back and rest.\u201dShe looked up at me with a tremble as if she weren\u2019t going to listen. Hey, don\u2019t look at me like that. If you look up with that puppy-dog expression, you will make me feel guilty for no reason. She swallowed her words, and when I patted her head, she blushed, and then she bowed her head.\u201cSo\u2026sorry!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Go back now.\u201d\u201cYe-yes!\u201dA handsome face was helpful in situations like this.\u201cHmmm~\u201dI felt good and hummed while looking down at the meal Amy prepared for me.\u201cThey\u2019re treating me like an old man because I\u2019m a patient.\u201dConsidering my mental age, I wasn\u2019t an old man by human standards, but an actual living fossil. Sadly, I wasn\u2019t mentally mature enough to be such an upright person either. Most people or heroes who lived for thousands of years or tens of thousands of years were still giggling, as if they were in their teens or early twenties.Are you confused? It meant that people go around and around. It would be a natural change for those who had already accepted death once. Some people kept their seriousness, but others eventually returned to their childhood personalities. The worst of them was the saint Daphne, and the self-proclaimed survival king Hercules.They were both mad.While silently eating the meal on the table, I didn\u2019t forget to use mana and divine power at the same time. The mana would recover on its own even if I didn\u2019t do anything, so that meant I just needed to use the rest of them.What you could do with the divine power was the basic magic of healing, restoring, and curing. Magic was all about simple lights, magic missiles, and other life magic that could be used easily, but that was only the case for me, who hadn\u2019t recovered fully.Even though it felt like my stomach was about to burst, once I used the restore magic, my digestion became better, and I could eat endlessly. What I ate was roughly more than three times the average amount eaten by an ordinary person.That was too much? If you forced it in, it\u2019ll eventually all go in. Amy looked surprised at the amount of food I ate, but I\u2019m also a stubborn person. After pushing in so hard that my cheeks were about burst, I felt like my soul was about to return to my body. Oh, of course.\u201cOh\u2026the damn bathroom.\u201dThe disadvantage was that I needed to go to the bathroom frequently because I digested everything too fast. If Haris, the lazy god, saw me, he would have made fun of me. An old man that doesn\u2019t act like his age\u2026We don\u2019t have enough food!The recovery process proved to be smooth. However, soon problems began to arise elsewhere. The problem finally revealed itself about a month after I woke up, and it threatened me.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dI experienced a stomachache, and I groaned loud enough that the sound flowed out of the castle. Amy\u2019s expression naturally turned to a frown, and there was a shadow over her face.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dI consoled her and read the document she gave me and let out a laugh. The royal budget allocated to the royal castle was extremely small, so the ingredients for food seemed to have run out.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the first prince would have to worry about eating.\u201dAlthough, it was quite obvious where the issue stemmed from.\u201cAmy.\u201d\u201cYes, Prince.\u201d\u201cCurrently, how many maids and servants are working in this castle?\u201dShe looked embarrassed by my question.Seeing her expression, I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cIs it just you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I have sinned!\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but sigh at her bowing. It wasn\u2019t a very wide place, but it was still a castle that the prince used. Originally, it wasn\u2019t a castle used by the royal princes who were chosen as the next king, but it was quite wide as it was a castle where the royal family once lived.\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re taking care of this castle by yourself?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026that\u2026\u201dAfter returning from a coma, the situation was very unusual. However, in the past, it was a place where people lived, and I never felt that there was a severe shortage. But it changed to this just in six years. It wasn\u2019t a short time.Listening to Amy, I got a rough idea of what she said. Davey Al Rown, the first prince of the royal family, was the black sheep in the queen\u2019s eyes. A royal prince couldn\u2019t even enter the Parondas castle because he lacked the power to do so. Was it my fault?It was my fault.Couldn\u2019t they have just treated me as a family and embraced me, even if my brothers weren\u2019t blood-related?\u201cNo wonder the castle is in a mess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, just kill me!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not cold-hearted to kill innocent people.\u201dCompared to the beginning, it was now getting easier to move. Was this the body of a weak prince? I slowly got out of bed, sat on a chair, and wore magnifying glasses. My blurred vision gradually became clear. My original body had very bad eyesight. That was why I was naturally weak, and\u2026I also had a memory that I didn\u2019t want to think about.\u201cLet\u2019s see. What\u2019s the original budget for the castle?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026it\u2019s 5,000 gold a year.\u201d\u201cBut only 10 gold is left in the castle.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd the prince\u2019s castle isn\u2019t in charge of it.\u201dHaving a lack of food in the castle was an error.\u201cHow much did we earn this month? We could still work around that budget so that we have enough food to eat.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, so tell me.\u201d\u201cIt says 500 gold on paper, but the actual amount we receive is 100 gold\u2026\u201dI sighed deeply after hearing her words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was such an innocent fool. This meant that she was the only person who protected me even when everyone ran away from the castle, not worrying whether I\u2019d die or not. I felt strange gratitude and formed a bitter smile.\u201cTake what you didn\u2019t receive from my income.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI told you not to make me say it twice, remember?\u201cSorry! But\u2026!\u201d\u201cSo there isn\u2019t anything for food tomorrow?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. Prince.\u201d\u201cYou can stop calling me that. It just sounds too uptight.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cIt makes me feel quite detached from you when I\u2019m being called prince.\u201dAll classes had their own responsibilities. Having a position wasn\u2019t about showing off your excellent pedigree and suppressing the common people but about completing a complicated responsibility. However, the position of the prince wasn\u2019t at all satisfactory for a country that was like this.An external force was messing with state affairs and nobility. A father who didn\u2019t care about his son, and a queen who was in a hurry to put her own son on the throne. Even the wicked aristocrats manipulated the common people. If I still had my powers from the hall of heroes, I might have erased the country Rown from the map.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026Prince Davey. Please withdraw your order. I\u2019ve turned this castle into\u2026\u201d\u201cYou had no power to stop them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need to be paid for your work. I can\u2019t continue eating after what I\u2019ve heard.\u201dHa! I shouted, then clicked my tongue and looked straight at her.\u201cTake all your overdue salary from the remaining funds.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2026accept your offer.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take care of the ingredients for food, so let\u2019s go to the financial department.\u201dSo now, the prince was managing his own finances? My ancestors would flip out if they knew. However, what else could I do? There was a problem with food for tomorrow. As the weather grew cooler, we had to get firewood and repair some places in the castle that were damaged. In that sense, the current castle of the first prince seemed to look pretty bad. If I hadn\u2019t woken up for another year or two, the castle might\u2019ve taken a turn for the worst.\u201cMy father had never shown up even in a situation like this\u2026\u201dAmy\u2019s eyes now looked as wide as a tray. What I just said would\u2019ve likely caused a lot of problems. If my words entered the queen\u2019s ears, it wouldn\u2019t be strange even if the royal guards came to pick me up tomorrow. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that I was withdrawing.As a light-hearted human being, I am well-liked and well-expressed, but I\u2019m also a reckless person who doesn\u2019t do what I am told when people act hostile.\u201cGuide me.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026okay!\u201dI remembered the geography of the castle, but some things might\u2019ve changed. And it would look pretty funny if a prince were walking around without any assistance.* * *\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince. To use additional funds that are already accounted for is impossible\u2026\u201dThe aristocrat didn\u2019t even sound sorry. He just bowed his head and expressed his intention to refuse what I had asked. Rather, he acted like I was bothering him by coming here. This was a weak prince. The perception that arose in the incident didn\u2019t disappear easily.Watching him without saying a word, he looked straight at me as if he was sorry. His mustache that looked like rat whiskers made him look mean\u2014that little bastard. I smiled as I dragged over a nearby chair, then sat down to face him. He seemed a little surprised by my unprincely behavior, but soon showed a subtle contempt. You think I\u2019m a weak and tactless prince because you don\u2019t know me yet.\u201cAre you trying to fool me?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHis face looked stunned by what I had just said.\u201cThe castle\u2019s funds for this month are supposed to be 500 gold. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cBut the actual amount we received was less than 100 golds\u2026\u201d\u201cPrince! That\u2019s\u2026the amount of gold left after we deducted the costs spent repairing and maintaining the castle! The other royal family members of the caste are also following that economical\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh, you\u2019re starting to really piss me off.\u201dI gave him a look that forced a bitter pill upon him.\u201cSo. Is that why the maintained castle has cracked floors and weeds growing from it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThe garden is on the verge of collapsing because of the weeds. Even an idiot can tell that not one penny was spent on that haunted house.\u201dHe shut his mouth at my words.\u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t make sense, doesn\u2019t it? What kind of prince looks over his own finances.\u201dHe didn\u2019t express agreement, but he must\u2019ve felt that I was right because he stopped talking. My chambermaid Amy, who was helping me, now looked pale.\u201cWell\u2026Prince. However, the use of the maintenance funds is not supervised by our department. All we do here is\u2026\u201dI tapped my knees at his words.\u201cAh! I didn\u2019t know about that.\u201dI made an exaggerated reaction and grabbed the cane next to me. His face turned pale at sight. No matter what happened tomorrow, I was still a prince who could beat this damn rat mustache to death. Of course, I would be punished accordingly, but I wouldn\u2019t be punished as much as others.However, I wouldn\u2019t do that. It was easy to kill a man, but the roots would just hide deeper.\u201cWhether it\u2019s here or on earth. They\u2019ll just pass the blame.\u201dI got up from my seat.\u201cNever mind. You can go use the money you stashed into your pockets.\u201dPerhaps it was because of my grim expression. Or perhaps he was embarrassed by his outspoken remarks. I was unlike others who were weak and nice. He looked up at me hesitatingly.\u201cBut we\u2019ll see.\u201dHe spoke calmly and turned away. The men who were responsible were all looking for a way out. The maintenance department would try to blame someone else, so I would just end up tiring myself after trying to dig up everything. All the employees who worked at the first prince\u2019s castle were running away and stealing salaries.Amy, who was actually working, knew the situation. Because of this. she kept her mouth shut and reduced her own salary. It seemed that those who didn\u2019t even show their faces were taking extra pay. Turning around without hesitation, I glanced at Amy, who was scared, and followed carefully.\u201cAmy.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026yes?\u201d\u201cWould you like to get a sword from the warehouse?\u201dAmy\u2019s face turned pale at the word sword. She must be worried that I might be planning to stab someone.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, and I\u2019m not going to hurt anyone.\u201dHer cute behavior made me feel reassured. Yeah, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt people. I was just going to hurt the ones who aren\u2019t even human. How long that standard will be maintained\u2026was something I wasn\u2019t sure of just yet.* * *What would happen if I cut down the employees and nobles who worked in my castle for no reason? The answer was simple. The prince was crazy. The tower of the outer castle must be locked up immediately. I was just a fish in a pond. I was in the perfect position to be cut off by the aristocrats that had a higher power. The sword was worn out, but it could still be used.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince\u2026that\u2019s all the swords we have left\u2026\u201dNo wonder the last guards in the castle were in a state of disrepair. I laughed because I thought it was her habit to keep saying sorry every time, and she lowered her head once more.\u201cA master does not blame his equipment.\u201dAt this, I pulled out half the sword from the cover without saying a word. It was originally a sword used by knights who protected the inner castle. The knight\u2019s equipment used for protecting the castle was one of the faces of the castle. Such an item was already out because of the maintenance, and there was also a shortage.The sword, which lost its shine, had piled up so much dust during its time of disuse.\u201cManagement, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dWhat a dirty sword. If a certain swordmaster saw it, his mouth would\u2019ve been foaming. A great master wouldn\u2019t even blame his equipment.\u201cAmy, how many animals are loose on the hunting grounds inside the castle?\u201d\u201cPardon? That\u2026that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be enough for the time being.\u201dWith this thought in mind, I put the sword back inside its cover.* * *The next day, Amy looked surprised when she saw the body of a wild boar lying in front of her.\u201cGood to see you.\u201d\u201cPrince? Tha, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cSomeone left it in front of the castle, so I brought it in. I was thinking about what to do with it. Maybe a righteous man brought it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026?\u201dThis was a lie. I caught it myself, but I couldn\u2019t help but lie to her face. Amy, who didn\u2019t understand what I said, saw the body of the boar I brought carelessly and shook with her eyes wide.\u201cGo to the warehouse and get me a bowl and some more waterproof cloth. We still have some supplies left, right?\u201d\u201cPri\u2026Prince Davey! Just kill me instead!\u201d\u201cHuh, what now?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let the blood of an animal touch the hands of a prince! And to say that you\u2019ll butcher and cook the animal yourself! You\u2019ll end up hurting yourself!\u201dI laughed in vain at her desperate cry.\u201cIt\u2019s okay because no one\u2019s watching.\u201dEven if I wanted to see the king, he would deny seeing me and say that he was busy. How could I meet a king who never showed his face when his son was sick? Of course, it was a pass. It was a pass for the other departments too because there was nothing I could do about them.Queen Liness seemed to be doing everything in her power to kill me, but I\u2019ve become somewhat of a specialist in survival since I was trained by Hercules for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s a boar. But now it\u2019s my dinner.\u201dWhile spouting nonsense, I skillfully used hot water, and the sword to peel off its skin and remove the guts. It looked like it was taking a lot of effort, but its leather and flesh were cut out easily. The blade was saturated in mana, so it would\u2019ve been even more strange if it wasn\u2019t easy.It was fun, even for me, secretly catching a wild boar raised in the hunting grounds of the castle and trying to butcher and cook myself\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could she possibly say that she wanted to protect me like that? Was she just too loyal or too cute? Both weren\u2019t all that bad.For nearly decades, I had learned how to survive by being pushed around by Hercules, the self-proclaimed survival king. The ability to catch such wild animals and butcher them was as easy as chewing a piece of gum. Of course, this kind of behavior would be very troublesome if it had been seen by the eyes of others.Who would believe that the prince, who had just got out of bed and started to move, crawled into the hunting grounds and caught a boar? It wasn\u2019t normal that the first prince would be playing a survival game inside the castle in the first place. Even if we couldn\u2019t leave any risk factors behind, there was no other way to do so if I wanted to make ends meet.Queen Liness had assigned a watchman\u2026but it had been a long time since I bothered that watchman. How could I be sure? This was because I used command magic. Unlike other mana and sacred power, command mana showed remarkable growth, and the foundation of command mana was to confuse the opponent.Your eyes and ears would become useless from the moment you failed to identify your opponent. Looking at Queen Liness\u2019s castle from far away, I smiled, sliced the meat appropriately, and sprinkled herbs and salt that had promptly been prepared in advance.\u201cThe smell will be gone by evening. Amy, please run some errands.\u201d\u201cPr\u2026Prince\u2026\u201dNow, she was crying and asking me to stop.\u201cTell the chamberlain Vespers that I want to meet the King.\u201d\u201cB\u2026but\u2026\u201d\u201cJust tell him even if you know it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShe bowed and walked away. Her footsteps seemed very heavy. There seemed to be a misunderstanding. Honestly, even if we shared the same blood, I had no intention of reuniting with my father. I didn\u2019t know why he left me unattended and why he didn\u2019t get to the bottom of this. And he did nothing when my mother died\u2026\u2018You\u2019re just not family anymore.\u2019They said that when your head was hardened, your thoughts would be hardened too. Even if someone were to say that I was immature, this was my choice right now. So you were asking why couldn\u2019t I go visit him at night? All I wanted was a proper face-to-face conversation. I didn\u2019t want to sneak in like an assassin and grab him by the collar and yell, \u2018Why did you do that?!\u2019He once said that he was a man who only loved my mother. In my mother\u2019s diary, there was affection and love for him, and there was a belief that he would never forget it even if she died. However, he was different. His love for her was only this much. My father, who was the only trace linked to my mother, was this kind of human being.That was why I was just watching him for my own judgment. In the past, I thought that my half-brothers would approach me sincerely one day. However, when I was 10 years old, I had been betrayed by them, and I fell into a coma. It was a miracle that I survived after being hit by a random arrow. No, I knew best that it wasn\u2019t random at all.When a hunting contest was held at the hunting ground inside the castle where I had caught the wild boar, the event was held to promote friendship between royalty and aristocrats. There, I was hit by an arrow shot by the second Prince, Carlos. It was none other than my half-brother, who was one year younger than me. I had told Queen Liness that I hadn\u2019t seen the criminal, but I would never forget the sneer Carlos had after shooting me with an arrow.Even if he was my half-brother, he tried to shoot me to death. Wasn\u2019t that funny?Nevertheless, there was no evidence, and Queen Liness\u2019s power was extremely high. Because I didn\u2019t wake up, Carlos didn\u2019t receive any punishment. That was why Queen Liness, the second Prince Carlos, and the third Prince Benedict came as soon as I woke up, even though they were busy.She pretended that she didn\u2019t know because she wasn\u2019t going to risk her life. The clever woman wouldn\u2019t have simply believed in me anyway. That was probably why she was monitoring me. Perhaps she was the reason why I couldn\u2019t meet the king. Perhaps she was so worried that I might tell him that I saw Carlos shoot the arrow.\u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m 100 percent sure that\u2019s the truth.\u201dThe blood had been washed away with cleaning magic after heavily seasoning the meat. Then I burned all the rugged clothes I had been wearing.Just a little bit. In others\u2019 eyes, I needed to be seen as a weak, powerless, and lucky prince who lived a difficult life\u2014a prince who would cook the meat that someone hunted every day.* * *\u201cPrince Davey, I brought you a meal.\u201dHer face turned red when I smiled at her.\u201cDo you want to eat together?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t!\u201d\u201cJust eat.\u201dSo that the rumors would spread faster. They would think that I was stupid and that I didn\u2019t have any awareness of my position. The more the opponent looked down on me, the less they would check on me.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I told you not to make me say it twice.\u201d\u201cSorry\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cCome sit down.\u201dWhen I spoke calmly, she crouched down and sat on the opposite side of the table. Now she was the only ally in this castle. So she should be receiving this kind of treatment.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not normal for you to manage this castle by yourself.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s my job.\u201d\u201cNo one in this castle works as much as you do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right! I\u2019m just\u2026doing what you ask me\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lot, too.\u201dIt was hard for her to manage most of the things by herself. Because of that, I boldly gave up managing this castle. It would be better if there were more rumors. If there was a rumor that I was incompetent, I would be far safer.It wasn\u2019t like I could press charges against Queen Liness right now anyway. She would only be criticized. And she wasn\u2019t weak enough to be scared by that.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. You\u2019re so meticulous. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be loved even when you get married.\u201d\u201cTha\u2026thank you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to repay you later.\u201dA chambermaid didn\u2019t usually do chores; it was the maid\u2019s responsibility. Even if she was a declassed noble, it wasn\u2019t her job. Nevertheless, she was in charge of the chores because of the bloody people that ran away.I could see some of them trying to come back because they were afraid of future trouble, but I was confident that it would be their last time in this castle if they returned. I might be affectionate, but I was not stupid. Since they all had their own backs, they must be making excuses not to return.\u201cWhat\u2019s the update for my requested to meet the king?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI see. They refused again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince\u2026\u201dShe bowed her head carefully with a melancholic voice.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. What about the other thing?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ve already found out about that\u2026but why would you\u2026\u201dShe bowed her head again when he sat there without saying a word.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. How dare I ask\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201dI spoke calmly and chewed. As I continued to recover from the restored magic, my appetite was growing bigger. Of course.\u2018Oh\u2026my stomach\u2026\u2019The problem was that my digestive system proved to be faster. Clearly, unless I found a way to turn bodily waste into nutrients, my digestive system would continue to cause a disturbance. I felt bitter when I thought of that.* * *\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking?\u201dQueen Liness made a face while sitting at a table quietly drinking her black tea.\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a possibility that he\u2019s acting?\u201d\u201cEven the priests examining Prince Davey said that his body still has limitations in moving. Considering the current rate of treatment, he needs to recuperate for at least a year.\u201dA woman in a chambermaid\u2019s uniform answered quietly. She looked like an ordinary chambermaid, but she was a little different from a normal chambermaid. She was a level-A secret agent of the Black Moon guild of assassins from the capital of the Rown Kingdom.The presence brought by the position of a level-A secret agent was truly amazing. Liness watched the woman in front of her, savoring the tea without saying a word. She looked cool and calm, the very image of a skilled chambermaid.The arrogance and murder in the eyes of a woman with an icy face answered silently. Her ability to grapple with life that wasn\u2019t directed at a particular object proved to be great. Still, she had been both very perceptive and ambitious since she was young. She was a recognized secret agent on the continent, and she was capable of assassinating high-ranking nobles in a single day.Therefore, she commissioned the Black Moon Guild to keep her at their side for the long term. There might be better assassins on the continent than her, but it was clear that her skills top-notch within the kingdom at least. At least she had the power to protect herself. There was nothing to be greedy about because she could get rid of any annoying things that came her way.In fact, if you put someone\u2019s life in her hands, she had a record of taking that person down within a few days. This was a machine made for murder.That was what Liness felt when she had seen her. If she was the person speaking, it was most likely to be true. And if the target were set, that person would be found dead the next day. However, why did she feel qualms?\u201cMaybe there\u2019s information that the secret agent wasn\u2019t able to catch?\u201dIt was very surprising when the first prince, Davey Al Rown, had woken up after six years of lapsing into a coma. However, she calmly grasped the situation and soon recalled that there was nothing he could do. It didn\u2019t matter if Davey knew that he was almost killed by an arrow shot by Carlos at the hunting competition.The truth could be easily buried if they threatened him. The king wasn\u2019t interested in his son anyway. As such, Davey\u2019s leash was always in her own hands. She was just looking for a good reason to get rid of him.When Liness asked her a question, the level-A Black Moon secret agent\u2019s, Shary\u2019s, eyes turned cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It sounded like a low rank, but that was by no means the case. However, her anxiety didn\u2019t go away.\u201cThey have secret weapons that have nothing to do with ranking. If you\u2019re going to mock my men any further\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m just concerned. If you\u2019re really confident\u2026\u201dShe smiled a little when she stopped talking, proving her to be just as dreary as Shari.\u201cDavey, you can block any of if that\u2019s not the case, you\u2019ll have to pay for it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dShe smiled at my words and savored the tea as if there was nothing else to say.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste good.\u201d Liness, murmuring quietly, handed the teacup to Shari.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll have to get rid of the disobedient dog.\u201d\u201cWhen the time comes, just let me know.\u201d There was no emotion in Shari\u2019s face as she answered quietly.Unique Rehabilitation Training\u201cAre you\u2026 Prince Davey? Why in the world are you here?\u201dI stood at the place with the most weeds inside the palace. Amy inquired carefully after following me to one side of the garden. A maid wasn\u2019t supposed to ask such questions haphazardly, but it meant that my efforts were worth it, considering she asked such a question.A person could and should ask questions. That was how I thought. She undeniably thought that way as well because she wasn\u2019t familiar with the world. Of course, I asked her to do it because she knew her boundaries.I cleared the grass, cleaned it up, and went inside despite her question, leaving the abandoned garden as wild as I found it. It was funny. Nobody was bothered to do anything despite there being a space like that inside the palace.\u201cYou should go back. Let me know if anyone looks for me.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone that I\u2019m here.\u201dAmy nodded several times, implying she knew what I meant.\u201cNow\u2026 Let\u2019s get started.\u201dI pulled at the uniform that I was wearing and slowly sat cross-legged comfortably in the middle of the grassy field. It didn\u2019t matter if I lay down, but I didn\u2019t want to lie on overgrown weeds. It was a pretty messy place, after all. It wasn\u2019t until one couldn\u2019t move for a while that they could steadily see the world surrounding them.I closed my eyes and put down my glasses without saying anything. I then uttered the magic words quietly.\u201cOperation Field.\u201dConsequently, my mana began to assimilate slowly with the surroundings, all in conjunction with my will. The particular mana around me was a bit tricky, unlike the sacred power carved in my soul and my command mana, which had grown well. I took special measures since we wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from mana shortage for several years if I didn\u2019t take any action against it.Mana naturally gathered the most at that place. Wandering around me, it slowly flocked into my body when I conjured my weak mana and created a unique locus for it connected to the surrounding area. Mana entered my body and circulated out again, leaving behind only the pure version of it that I needed.It was a groundbreaking breathing method for collecting mana, or, to be exact, a miracle. There were a lot of benefits to having a body without mana that disrupted magic applications, considering it ultimately left the pure mana that maximized magic in the body. Considering the skill of the continental wizards I knew, they would be surprised and ready to kill to understand the principle when they saw the mana breathing method invented by Odin, an ancient hero called the revolutionary wizard.It would only take me a few days to gather the mana others would take months to collect. Of course, although I had no intention of revealing the method to the public, very few people could use it even if I told them. Consequently, it meant that it was a breathing method only talented people could utilize.\u2018You think I\u2019m being cocky? If you think it\u2019s unfair, you should have been born with talent! Hm!\u2019I felt Odin\u2019s aftermath a great deal when it came to magic, which surprised me in turn. While reflecting on myself, I repeatedly inhaled and exhaled mana. Even though it seemed extremely slow compared to the way one would just take and stack mana, it built up at a tremendous speed since there was little waste.Trying to catch all the mana that came in when breathing was what basic magic common sense was. The ability to break up such knowledge and create a breathing method in reverse was frankly admirable, regardless of personality. It was so slow that no one would have thought such an excellent outcome would follow. I couldn\u2019t ask her if she created this method by researching about it for a long time without doing anything else or if she was just a genius in her lifetime.If I asked the question, she would have hit me on my head with her cane, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be distracted.\u201dI began to concentrate again by shaking off small memories from the past.Obviously, the time needed to accumulate the mana in my body would be worthwhile. I wasn\u2019t only building it up but waking up my sleeping mana as well, after all.* * *The results were quick! There was a certain amount of mana, divine power, and command mana that had already begun to flow in my body in the past few days. Those who knew the concept of mana might call me a nut who was going to die, considering divine power and mana were separate energy that opposed each other.That was why priests couldn\u2019t use arcane magic and wizards couldn\u2019t use sacred magic. However, I had done all three.How did I do that? I inherited the work of two maniacs and two nerds who studied head-to-head.The foul-mouthed, alcohol-loving saint, [Daphne]. The bad-tempered wizard who swung her cane like a blunt instrument and went nuts, burning everything when you made fun of her, [Odin]. The necromancer called Deathlord, a woman with a kind heart who often made me wonder if she was actually a real saint, [Rolas]. Lastly, the god known for her work on dissecting almost every part of the human body, [Hippocrates].I was the outcome of the miracle created by those four crazy women. We all spent time together at the Hall of Heroes, a place where many heroes arrived, and only the best in each field remained. Even if they were enemies in life, they became close after spending a lot of time together.Perhaps they interacted with each other because they were lonely. In fact, the saint, Daphne, and the archer, Apollo, were just like that. The two were heroes of the same century. Still, Apollo was the sworn nemesis of Daphne, who often roared to kill Apollo. Perhaps the two grew affection from hatred over time even though they argued and fought a lot.Of course, I didn\u2019t want to be involved with Apollo, who was annoying. Daphne used to tell stories about her life when I drank with her, which made me think that their relationship was ridiculous.One day, while learning command magic and curses from Rolas, I remembered the day when I was drinking with Daphne because she visited my place in the middle of the night and attacked Apollo, trampling on his middle leg.\u201cWhat? Did you touch Rolas? What the fuck! I told you that you\u2019re dead if you act like a slut. Isn\u2019t it enough that you screwed me in your life, you fucking bastard?!\u201dAll I knew was that Daphne had a very foul mouth. Ironically, however, she didn\u2019t evoke the sense of being offended. She was tough on the outside but soft on the inside. As a matter of fact, although Daphne used to curse at me like that, she bought me drinks often. Of course, Apollo was an exception.\u2018Ha.\u2019My laughter had disrupted the process, but I went back to concentrating on absorbing mana immediately. The resisting mana escaped from my body after wandering through, leaving only pure mana behind once more.* * *As soon as I gathered all the mana, the circle began to be made, and the growth rate began to accelerate. Time flew by instantly once I began focusing on making the circle.As opposed to novels, circles couldn\u2019t be completed in a short time. Oh, of course, most wizards would rush it. However, in their case, growth was bound to be very slow.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dI took a deep breath as I slowly moved the pure mana with my eyes closed. Mediocre wizards made circles in the heart and rotated them. However, in that way, it was impossible to endure a clash between the divine power and the commanding mana.I would be lucky if I didn\u2019t explode right away if I used such a method. In that sense, my body was currently in a pretty dangerous state. If the amount increased a little, I would die because I wouldn\u2019t withstand my strength. Such a method was called Blood-Point Circling.What did I mean by that?Within the whole body, the blood point circulated. With that, they created an intricate circle following its way around the blood. Even though it was insanely dangerous because it would instantly kill anyone if something were off even a tiny bit, it was just a matter of reopening its process after succeeding through the same method before.I was still worried even though I told Amy not to come near me even if someone approached me.For the time being, I had someone who was after me. They would hide and watch me because they couldn\u2019t observe openly. They, unfortunately, wouldn\u2019t be able to know what I was doing exactly because of the weeds around me. That alone gave me plenty of room for suspicions.When I slowly applied the ultimate Qigong technique to the mana, my whole body began to be filled with subtle vibrations. Since I was able to make simple movements, I held my body firmly, trying not to let myself be distracted from it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 8Whoooooo!As the mild vibration spread throughout my body, I began to spread and rotate the mana throughout it. The most difficult parts were the quadriplegic and cerebral fluid. The head was as dangerous as touching mana or circulating it through blood.Anyone would go crazy in no time if it went wrong. In that sense, Hippocrates\u2019s knowledge was extremely helpful. The knowledge about blood that I learned while being scolded proved invaluable. As it began to move extremely slowly and weakly, the tightly blocked blood points slowly began to vibrate and shake.Cold sweat began to flow out of me.I was forced to gather as much focus as possible since it was quite delicate, just like putting a needle into hundreds of holes and then removing them. Even though I had a safety net, I would better off without failure.\u2018Drop it!\u2019 There came the sound of something breaking.The blood point, which had been tightly blocked, was punctured by mana and slowly began to flow correctly.\u2018Slow down.\u2019I knew I should proceed slowly to avoid my brain bleeding.\u2018I just need to pierce it once. Just once.\u2019It was so difficult to set up the first circle that it required all of my concentration. I lost all strength in my body, but I had never lost focus. I precisely controlled the mana while watching the conditions inside myself cautiously.Thud thud! Thud thud thud thud thud thud!As I began to pierce through the tightly closed blood point like piercing a nerve from neck to tailbone, I felt the mana accelerating. I caught it not forcefully but naturally, anchored its direction firmly so that it wouldn\u2019t wander off, and pushed it steadily as if I were knocking on the gate with a battering ram.\u2018Drop it!\u2019\u201cUgh!\u201dUnimaginable pain came at that moment. I felt dizzy, almost as if I had been hit in the head with a sledgehammer. Unlike in the Hall, my body was in poor conditions, making the difficulty clearly greater. Of course, if I had been frightened and avoided pain, I wouldn\u2019t have revived.\u2018There\u2019s no failure.\u2019As I thought to myself, mana began to push into the cerebral blood, boasting a tremendous amount of pressure, like water that began to pour out of a dam.And then\u2026Poof!With the sound of something exploding, my mind became clear for a moment, and a mix of cold and warmth began to circulate in my head.\u201cPhew.\u201dA sigh of relief left me unbidden. If one said that I had only succeeded in establishing only one perfect circle, albeit not a sloppy circle, they should try it for themselves. To be honest, it was more difficult to establish one circle than establishing eight or nine circles with the bizarre establishment method I used. I finished the crazy process by myself this time, unlike when those four women helped me to see whether the result of their experiment, me, turned out to be a masterpiece.The balance of my body was entirely deformed because there was mana, divine power, and command mana existing simultaneously in me, which was completely back to normal. After checking the mana, which began to rotate around my body in an instant, I opened my eyes slowly. I saw the scenery outside. It had already become dark.I began to think about it. I sat down around lunch, but it was already dark. Outside, I saw Amy standing restlessly with a worried look. It seemed that she was there the whole time. Her legs must be in pain after standing up for almost 7 or 8 hours. Still, that went to show she had a lot of patience. I felt so sorry for her.I wiggled my fingers around carefully. Circles that moved along the blood allowed the forces of different properties to rotate without colliding. With the road paved with mana, it was time to circulate the sacred power and the command mana. This bizarre circle establishment method, which had the advantage of allowing different forces to coexist with each other, had many advantages. It was the best.Whooooooo.It was a silent magic chant. It sounded like something that only happened in fiction. When I chanted it, it produced better results because the effect doubled. Just by flicking my fingers to help me express my will, I could conjure a simple ability. It was as expected of a Master-Class Wizard.Amy\u2019s eyes were filled with curiosity when she felt her body warming up as the Restore magic started to work.\u2018Don\u2019t be surprised yet. You\u2019ll be surprised again and again.\u2019I was attempting to surprise her again for the sake of my own gentle sadism.* * *Five months passed.All I had done was hold my breath and roll my mana away from others\u2019 eyes. Of course, nothing was as difficult as the first time. There was undoubtedly an incredible increase in my growth as the basically hardened mana and sacred power slowly picked up momentum.Four circles.Considering that the average wizard didn\u2019t exceed three circles, it was really a tremendous recovery speed. It was enough to sneak out and catch wild animals whenever I needed food. Of course, I started to have financial leeway slowly thanks to the well-rolled dividends that came in during those five months, which I only spent on necessities. It was impossible to be extravagant like any other member of the royal family, anyway.\u201cMajesty. It\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dThe olden door opened, and Amy slowly came in after I permitted her.\u201cSomeone brought a live animal again today as well as vegetables.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dIt was exactly three months ago. Someone had started to bring me meat and vegetables in the courtyard of this quiet palace. I was cautious because I thought Queen Liness had brought them to assassinate me initially. However, it turned out they were pretty good meat and vegetables. Even though I felt like someone was helping me, I didn\u2019t know who they exactly were.\u2018There was someone who stopped by the day before.\u2019It was just one. If I used my mana, which was widely spread inside the palace, I could easily find out who was there. I learned of Amy\u2019s private life unintentionally, so I retrieved the mana around her to calm my conscience.\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about food for now.\u201d\u201cGood. Well done.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHave you considered repairing the palace? Like getting rid of weeds in the garden.\u201d\u201cLeave it alone.\u201d\u201cBut the appearance of the palace\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to let it remain this wake for the sake of my life.\u201dShe turned her head down with a tearful expression after my words. Since she had a good nature and a great sense of responsibility, she looked sad because she knew what it meant.\u201cYes, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard. You can leave now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLooking at her retreating with her head down, I closed my eyes again and began to move slowly. Externally, I wasn\u2019t supposed to make such violent action. Despite that, however, I accelerated my training whenever I was able to avoid surveillance.What caught my eye was the few iron swords in the palace. They were too dull and old to use immediately, but I didn\u2019t have the luxury to be picky. No matter how good the sword was, my skills would worsen as soon as I neglected training. Practice was essential, even if it was simple.Whoooo!The mana around me then changed themselves to suit my movements. It wasn\u2019t Haris who taught me swordsmanship at first. To be honest, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to its word origin that was supposed to hold meaning. In fact, there was no doubt that his swordsmanship was as powerful as Haris.It was called the Sword of The Water-Flowing Demon. It was a swordsmanship style that even Haris, a well-known swordsman, accepted, saying, \u201cI admit that it is actually pretty good.\u201dIts movements were persistent and gentle compared to Haris\u2019 swordsmanship style, which was oppressive and destructive.[Dok Go-jun, the Heavenly Horse]He was once an unknown man who broke down a corrupt political faction and became a master of martial arts. Hercules, who taught me swordsmanship for the first time, made me learn from him after Haris, as he also dug into swordsmanship to its limit in the Hall of Heroes. At first, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to teach anyone. I don\u2019t know why I should teach him,\u201d but he was a quirky guy who suddenly changed his mind with a bottle of unusual rice wine.When he laid down Cheongju, he bowed down and served almost as if he were serving a god, though I couldn\u2019t see him without laughing. He was a notorious drinker in the corridor. Even saint Daphne, who loved drinking, said he was pathetic.Usually, if one learned a swordsmanship style, it became challenging to learn from others. Accept different techniques into the style that they learned intensely would feel alienating.That was why I decided to use a combination of different swordsmanship styles. I combined the tenacity and elegance of the Heavenly Horse, Dok Go-jun, with the overwhelming power of Haris. The techniques that two crazy swordsmen created were honestly remarkably close to perfection.To be more precise, I could say that I was the final weapon that the heroes had determined to create. I knew I was strong, and even they said I was amazing. I thought of an imaginary hidden enemy before me as I moved nonstop.My body, which had almost recovered, didn\u2019t complain of pain despite the slight movements.\u201cSigh\u2026sigh. I\u2019m still around level 30.\u201dHowever, it was surprising that I recovered this much in just five months. The Knight Commander of the Royal Guard, who was called the Master, would be defeated by me if I considered our swordsmanship skills.\u201cWhoa\u2026 Whoa\u2026\u201dAs I lay down my tired physique, the ceiling of the old yet clean hall came into view. It seemed like it would collapse at any moment, but it was holding on so well thanks to the minimum management required by it.\u201cHmm? Who\u2019s here?\u201d\u201cThe priests are.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201dI used cleaning magic to wipe off my sweat, enjoying the refreshing feeling.With a suspiciously refreshed face, the person who was training a while ago moved slowly and held a cane toward the room.I wasn\u2019t capable of walking yet, as far as those outsiders knew.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 9\u201cHmm, how are you feeling?\u201dA priest questioned me with a cold expression, all while holding my wrist.\u201cNot bad. How much longer do you think I will need to recover?\u201d\u201cYour energy is low because you\u2019ve been lying down for a long time. It\u2019s dangerous to overdo the divine magic.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dI laughed because I found it perfectly ridiculous. They didn\u2019t even apply proper recovery magic in the first place. Even if they did, they made excuses and reluctantly did so. Since they were Queen Liness\u2019s people, they would\u2019ve been told to delay my recovery as much as possible. However, it was still quite disgusting to see them act so corrupted. They were supposed to be priests.The basics of being a doctor started with knowing the importance of life. It was the first lesson that Hippocrates taught me. She was a genuine doctor, so she didn\u2019t discriminate between enemies and allies. I was an exception, though. Since they heard what happened to my life, they knew the thorny path ahead of me. I should thank them for not going any further.As a person who made a conscious declaration, I couldn\u2019t stand what they were doing. As a matter of fact, they were practicing medicine, whether they were doctors or priests. It wasn\u2019t true that I was unable to recover. I wasn\u2019t even trying, yet my body was healing by itself.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that divine magic is quite amazing.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u201cI thought this injury would heal quicker with the power of grace from Lord Freya.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, you probably think that simply because you\u2019re not familiar with this.\u201dThey might have forgotten that the 16-year-old boy in front of them who they were mocking and looking down on was a prince.\u201cI don\u2019t know much?\u201d\u201cYes, the knowledge of divine power is an authority unique to our priests.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dI was looking at him as if I was interested. He smiled slyly and continued to murmur to himself.\u201cOf course, I know you are different from the brilliant prince Carlos.\u201d\u201cBort! How dare you say that in front of a prince! Be careful with what you say!\u201dThe problem was that this idiot didn\u2019t have a brain to think with.\u201cHow dare a mere maid talk back to me?\u201dI sighed when I saw him turning his head away from me and scolding Amy.Slap!Even though I was standing right there, he didn\u2019t stop but suddenly stood up and walked up to Amy and slapped her cheek. It was too rough for a priest who was supposed to be loving, but it wasn\u2019t all that surprising. Queen Liness had already corrupted him with materialism.\u2018That\u2019s why you can\u2019t go further than being a lower-ranked official in your life.\u2019Even a junior official would gain significant power the moment they had Queen Liness behind them. That was probably why he was sitting here, filling up his lust. I was confident he didn\u2019t think before he spoke.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dWhen I asked him calmly, he coughed in vain and slowly came up to me and held my hand again.\u201cIf you let a maid with a big mouth work for you, you\u2019ll be in trouble someday.\u201dIn the corner, Amy was crying with her lips closed tightly. She looked angry. Considering her personality, the maid was probably angry at the fact that I was humiliated, not herself. She was one of the few people who were on my side in the palace.\u201cThe treatment is over. See you in fifteen days.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen I nodded calmly, he arrogantly got up from his seat. He then passed Amy and went to the door before stopping abruptly.\u201cThat bitch has beauty.\u201dHis insidious smile caused me to frown.\u201cAmy.\u201dI got up from my seat and leaned on my cane as if I knew nothing about it.\u201cThey are important priests. Escort them to the way out of the palace.\u201d\u201cAs you wish, your Majesty.\u201dWith her head down, she followed the priest. She had to be angry. Furious, even. And she wasn\u2019t the only one who felt that way.Looking at the priest\u2019s back without saying a word, I slowly took out the old sword sitting next to the pillow. He was just asking for trouble. There was no reason to endure it. I calmed myself down and moved slowly.* * *I felt strangely cooled down. Was I angry? Not really, I guessed. For a long time, I had been waiting for this moment. Daphne, the saint, said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t control your anger, you\u2019re no different from a dog or a pig,\u201d but I disagreed with her.Moderate anger was a source of life and a milestone of purpose. If annoyance was the key to development, then anger was the driving force. The sound of my footsteps completely disappeared. Slowly walking down the palace hall, I saw Bort, the priest, pushing Amy into a corner and saying something. It looked like he was talking, but I couldn\u2019t hear much because he was too far away.\u201cOh, prince\u2026\u201d\u201cShut your mouth.\u201dPuck!Perhaps he was watching me nearby. When an apprentice, standing nearby, found me, he tried to shout with his eyes wide open, but I was faster than his voice. As soon as my sword struck him, I walked away with a cold expression.Even though my abilities hadn\u2019t fully recovered, it still wouldn\u2019t be easy to spot me for a lower-ranked official like him. Bort was smiling menacingly at Amy, not expecting me to come here.\u201cRemember, you\u2019ll have to come to my room alone. Also, keep in mind that Prince Davey\u2019s life is in my hands.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cRoyal Persecution? What do you know? He is a puppet. I didn\u2019t kill him, not because I couldn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t listen to what I say, I\u2019ll end his life without mercy. The Queen would say that I did a good job. No one is on Prince Davey\u2019s side in this palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAs you know, there\u2019s no one to punish me, the sheep of Freya, the son of Queen Liness and the holy shepherd. No, there isn\u2019t. Hahaha!\u201dEveryone knew the power of Queen Liness in the royal palace. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Soon enough, I made some noise as I appeared.\u201cThat\u2019s great. I needed an excuse, Amy.\u201d\u201cBooch?! Majesty!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment for insulting me?\u201dMy sudden appearance caused Bort\u2019s eyes to widen, who couldn\u2019t detect my presence earlier. At the same time, I picked up the sword I was holding and pulled it out like I was throwing it.A flash!The action was quick, and that was my creed.Put your head against the fire.Apparently, he had been harassing her. I was sharp enough to know what happened so far without looking. I needed a proper justification, but could there be anything better than this?\u201cOh, my God!\u201dIn a second, the sound of metal rang out, and hot blood splashed everywhere. Amy\u2019s eyes were filled with shock as she began to shudder.\u201cUgh\u2026 Ugh\u2026 Ugh\u2026 W-why\u2026\u201dBort, the low-ranking official, collapsed on the floor and looked up at me, showing a shocked expression. According to what he knew, he didn\u2019t think I was able to appear without any noise. He would have thought that even if I could move a little, I still needed someone to support me.With that, I crept up toward him silently and swung my sword. He was one of Queen Liness\u2019s limbs inside the palace, not anyone else\u2019s, after all. He had a look of complete incomprehension. I spoke while keeping my face blank.\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it twice.\u201d\u201cImmediate execution.\u201dI shook my sword clean and smiled coldly at Amy, who answered my questions even though her body was shaking with fear. It was the law, but he didn\u2019t expect what was coming to him because no one ever died for it before. His expression was filled with confusion.\u201cDid you hear?\u201d\u201cThe Queen will not stand for this. In fact, even in the Mainland\u2026\u201d\u201cThanks for the advice, but I assure you, there is no one on your side.\u201dI pulled out the sword quickly after inserting it into his heart again as he coughed up blood. His body flinched and fell flat.He was dead.When I sheathed the sword back after I killed him, I glanced over at Amy.\u201cMa\u2026 Majesty\u2026 Why\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s just as you said. The crime of defamation of the royal family and attempted murder is immediate execution.\u201dShe burst into tears at my words. I patted her back without saying anything, and she cried there for a while. No matter how naive she was, she was most likely familiar with watching people die. This palace was a place where so many people had died behind my back. In the past, I was so foolish that I didn\u2019t even know it.\u201cAre you calming down now?\u201dShe realized her mistake and bowed her head after I teased her for crying.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, your Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cGood job for holding on for so long. Call the guards to clean up since there are no knights here.\u201dAmy looked at Bort while her body shook at my instructions.\u201cBut, your Majesty\u2026\u201dShe was so brilliant that she had immediately figured out what would happen to me after what I did. Bort was an official from the Mainland serving the god Freya, and he served Queen Liness.That meant he was sent here to monitor and slow down my recovery process. Externally, Queen Liness was a benevolent Queen who sent an official to a new palace for the safety of her stepson, but she was just a cheap woman full of dirty tricks inside. Whatever the reason was, it wouldn\u2019t be presented that I killed him under the right circumstances.Regardless of him committing a crime against the royal family, killing him without due process clearly had enough room for gigantic troubles. I wasn\u2019t certain, but rumors would most likely spread in the palace that the first prince, Davey Al Rown, had gone crazy.It was going to make my position worse. In the worst-case scenario, I would be confined to the outskirts of the palace because they would claim that I was a maniac. Furthermore, if there were complaints from the Mainland, I might be taken to the Mainland under the pretext of being a pawn.Whatever it was, Queen Liness would toast to it. She regarded me as a thorn in her side, after all. Of course, I was aware of all of that when I did it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 10They said a horse without feet could go to heaven.Word about my actions spread through the palace quickly. As was widely rumored, Amy asked the guards for help, so there was nothing more to see.\u2018That hurt!\u2019My head then turned away from the sudden slap. When I calmly looked up, I saw a furious woman standing before me. Queen Liness, the woman who commanded the low-ranking priest I killed. She currently held most of the power in the royal palace.\u201cAre you insane?!\u201d\u201cDo you think I am?\u201d\u201cHow dare you kill a priest who was sent from the Mainland!\u201dI smirked at her. \u201cBort threatened my life with his greed. I punished him according to the law in return. Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201dShe raised her hand again, throwing away her usually graceful mien. I quickly opened my mouth before she could continue.\u201cIsn\u2019t that funny?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe royal law wasn\u2019t as chaotic until I fell into a coma.\u201dShe fell silent at my words.\u201cThe Majesty is silent about this complete disorder. I just cut down a traitor who defamed the royal family, and now I\u2019m getting blamed for it. It is funny, after all, the fact that the royal family\u2019s status is now lower than that of a priest.\u201dI smiled, making eye contact with her. I wasn\u2019t the same person as before who used to avoid her gaze out of discomfort. I would\u2019ve been silent in the past, but I didn\u2019t spend three months recovering and training my body while avoiding others\u2019 eyes for no reason. I simply needed the power to protect my body.\u201cHow dare you bring up the authority of the Majesty and the Royal Family\u2026 You\u2019re insane.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the one going crazy or if the royal palace is.\u201dI continued to look at her with a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence. No matter what reason you cut him down for, this situation isn\u2019t simple enough for your little, stupid mind to judge. There will be complaints from the Mainland!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve always known you\u2019re as stupid as your mother, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re also this impulsive.\u201dHer words only served to deepen my laughter.\u201cIt is quite true that I inherited my mother\u2019s traits.\u201d\u201cVery shallow. You\u2019re like a clone of your mother.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good to belittle parents in front of their children, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dHer murderous spirit flared with those words. Such emotions were impossible to utilize if let out of control. However, when controlled, a spirit of jealousy and murder could be a powerful weapon. She looked at me with a face that turned pale in an instant and then slowly retreated. The maids flinched, sensing the abnormality in Queen Liness\u2019s behavior.I couldn\u2019t see their hands, which meant they stopped pulling out their sword when they felt the bloodthirsty outrage. It wasn\u2019t proper behavior for a maid. One of them was even peculiarly creepy.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019\u201cGreat loyalty. It would\u2019ve been fun if they pulled it out a little more\u2026\u201dI brushed off the murderous spirit and smiled as if nothing happened.\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous when people rush their decisions. Not just for you, Queen Liness, but others as well. They won\u2019t tolerate any murder within the royal family.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease be mindful of your choice. I am not the same boy I used to be.\u201dI got up from my seat without hesitation and grabbed my cane. I then walked away, limping past her.\u201cCould you leave now? I\u2019m tired. As you can see, the palace itself is out of control and shabby. You are too good to be here.\u201d\u201cYou punk!\u201d\u201cI ask you to be quiet in my palace. As you can see, the palace is a mess thanks to a certain someone.\u201dAs I turned around as if there was nothing more to say, I witnessed her confused expression. I had clearly conveyed my intention. It wasn\u2019t my personality to go into battle with a hidden knife since I had a reckless and hot temperament that could explode at any moment. She wasn\u2019t that stupid to not know what I meant. Hence, she stared at me with fury in her eyes but soon turned around.The choices that I had definitely wouldn\u2019t be available forever. If I didn\u2019t take action when I could, I might never be able to use it. That was the reason why I didn\u2019t hesitate to give her a heads-up. I implied that I knew Carlos shot an arrow at me at the hunting contest six years ago.She wasn\u2019t sure if I knew about it before, but she must\u2019ve known now that I was aware of everything. Sooner or later, she would try to stop me.\u201cOh, by the way, all the servants in the palace have been sent somewhere else. It\u2019s not good to be sneaking around.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Queen has been taking care of the royal family. I\u2019d like you to see all of them again as soon as possible. If this continues, there may be some bizarre rumors.\u201dHer eyes filled with even more rage as I made myself clear. I wasn\u2019t elegant enough to battle with a knife wrapped in fabric.\u201cIt\u2019s a serious crime to steal money from the royal funds, as far as I know.\u201dI grinned and murmured. \u201cAnyone caught would be beheaded. Haha, you\u2019re not stupid enough to not know that.\u201dShe snorted at my words and walked away. That was enough. When I lay down on the bed with satisfaction, I lifted my mana and saw four circles rotating inside my body. It was magic that moved along the blood points.Search Eye. Just like the command mana, which symbolized secrecy, a black air stream, invisible to others\u2019 eyes, stretched out and followed Queen Liness. It wouldn\u2019t last long, but I had an eye on her. It was quite a satisfying result in return for getting slapped in the face.* * *\u201c\u2026\u201dQueen Liness, who returned to her room without saying a word, remained silent with an expression of rage.\u201cQueen Majesty.\u201dSlap!When the maid quietly tried to speak, she was hit by the queen.\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Do you really want to die?\u201dAt her shouting, the women bowed their heads with their mouths shut.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHer face showed no emotion as if she weren\u2019t even human.\u201cGrrr!!\u201dAngered even more by her dull expression, Queen Liness began to throw everything in her reach hysterically. Most of the people in the Queen\u2019s Palace knew that she had a bad temper. Nobody stopped her, even if she shattered glasses and smashed wood tables.At that point, they were just waiting for her to stop.\u201cSigh\u2026 Sigh\u2026\u201dAfter the long disturbance, she put her hand on the smashed table with a grim face, clenched her fist, and growled.\u201cHe is stupidly clueless about where he belongs.\u201dHe didn\u2019t do that in the past. He was as dumb as his shallow mother back then. In fact, she could\u2019ve killed him if she really wanted to. However, he became different after he woke up from a coma. It was as if he had become a completely different person.\u201cCome on. If you really want to die, there is no reason to hesitate.\u201dBreathing heavily, she murmured lowly, \u201cKeep it up. Your rude behavior will tighten the noose around your neck.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know that Davey was humming as he listened to her hysterical shouts.* * *The result went as expected. Rumors began to spread inside the palace.Prince David Al Rown was crazy. He was mad and killed the innocent people around him without any care, losing his royal pride. Since most people inside the palace were her people, my reputation plummeted. In the past, they thought I was too weak to be king, a kind prince with a lot of affection. Now, however, I was treated like a maniac.\u201cMajesty! The medicine is here today!\u201dWhen I was quietly reading a book, Amy came in and began to make a fuss. She still seemed quite shocked by the time I wielded my sword. Still, she showed me a smile because she knew I was trying to save her, not anyone else, and that I was generally nice most of the time.I thought she was cute. No one had been younger than me in the Hall. I was currently sixteen years old, and she was a little younger than me. In that regard, she was like my little sister, although the status between us had an enormous gap.I had to protect my people.\u201cWho brought the medicine?\u201dAt first, they only brought me food, but medicine then started showing up after I ended priest Bort\u2019s life. The gifts arrived secretly, so no one could really tell. In fact, it had been quite helpful to me. I didn\u2019t need any medical herbs as of the moment, though, so I just kept them in storage.Clearly, my body had finished recovering. After five months of dedication to recovery and training, the effects began to appear. Once my body started to heal, it didn\u2019t take long to become healthy again. She smiled at me when I asked her a question, pretending that I didn\u2019t know that someone came in the middle of the night.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe someone who knows your kind nature is helping.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m kind?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dShe smiled brightly as she nodded, which made me laugh. Even though she had seen me kill a man, she still had quite the character.\u201cTake good care of the medicine and keep it safe.\u201d\u201cI was going to get them ready for you.\u201d\u201cI know my body well enough. The medicine I\u2019m taking is enough.\u201dShe looked disappointed when I refused but didn\u2019t argue further. I was a man of my own.\u201cDavid, your Majesty, are you here?\u201dWhile I was talking to Amy, gently teasing her, I heard someone calling my name. Slowly, I got up from my seat and went outside, and an old butler dressed in neat clothes bowed to me.\u201cI see the little sun of the kingdom.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to act fancy. What\u2019s going on?\u201dI knew the old man. Vespers. He served as the king\u2019s servant and the head of the royal court\u2019s inner servants. He was an old man who had worked here since I was born.\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who stole money from the First Prince\u2019s Palace and escaped from their duties under the command of Queen Liness.\u201dI squinted at his determined words and let out a small sigh. When I looked behind him, I saw a little more than ten people kneeling on the floor, all having frightened expressions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were all kinds of people like them. If I tried to chase them by myself, half of them would\u2019ve fled successfully, so my plan worked out in the end. Except for the maid Amy, they all ran away when I was in a coma. They were embezzlers who took their salaries without working. Their face turned pale as soon as they looked into my eyes, hearing the ongoing rumors that I went crazy.\u201cVespers.\u201d\u201cYes, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment for them?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re heinous. Technically, they should be beheaded alongside their immediate family.\u201dHe answered without hesitation, and the faces of those tied up turned blue.\u201cYour M-Majesty! I\u2019ve sinned terribly, but spare my life, please!\u201dAs one of them started begging for forgiveness by holding my leg, most others followed suit and bowed their heads. Even if I were crazy, they probably thought I\u2019d forgive them because I was supposed to be weak-minded. Or they could have done that to survive, taking any chance they could.\u201cRecently, interesting rumors are circulating around the palace.\u201d\u201cWhat rumors are they?\u201dI asked Vespers, the Lord Chamberlain while ignoring their pleas.\u201cThat I\u2019m obsessed with blood?\u201d\u201cYes, your Majesty.\u201dHe replied so firmly, almost as if he never spoke indirectly. There was nothing strange about the rumor because the priest who came to give me treatment was stabbed to death in my palace. It was an immediate execution without a detailed investigation. No justification for punishing me existed at that moment, however.Even though Queen Liness put me on probation, which was almost a joke, she was just watching me quietly. If my reputation grew worse and more violent, I would be in a different situation. Hence, I decided to only punish those who broke the law for the time being.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to keep up with the rumor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAt my words, Vespers bowed his head without saying a word. He then told the soldiers who had brought them to put them down on their knees.\u201cDid you hear Majesty\u2019s order?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cTake them. They dared embezzle the precious treasury of the kingdom. Don\u2019t give them a sip of water and lock them up. Behead them in four days!\u201d\u201cPlease, god, no\u2026 Lord Chamberlain!\u201d\u201cSave me!\u201d One of them shouted sternly, ignoring those who were crying and hanging on.\u201cThey have filled their stomachs by sucking up the taxpayer\u2019s money. What are you waiting for? Take them now!\u201dThe soldiers took the people who were crying away.\u201cI will leave now, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cDid you say it was the Queen Majesty\u2019s order?\u201d\u201cYes, she said she had been trying to capture those who had stolen from the treasury.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dI saw a little shock in Vespers\u2019 expression. However, he carefully smoothed over his face as if he had come to his senses.\u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019re not supposed to be disrespectful to the Queen. You should be careful with your language.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Lord Chamberlain, but I\u2019ve already seen everything.\u2019When I was young, he used to smile at me and often gave me snacks.\u201cI\u2019ll hire new people and arrange them in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cI want Amy to be my maid. Since she has been through a lot, I want to promote her to Chief Maid. Did you say it should be from different funding if I want to reward her?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cGive her a big bonus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201dHe bowed politely.\u201cAlso.\u201dI caught him on his way back.\u201cIs it still impossible to see the King?\u201dHe went silent at my words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIs it my father\u2019s order or the Queen\u2019s?\u201dHe smiled in vain at the fact that I had already figured out the situation.\u201cI am just delivering command.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Thank you. You may head back.\u201dHe turned silently at my words. Then, he stopped again.\u201cMajesty, patience is crucial in the palace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I know what you\u2019re trying to say, though. I\u2019ll keep your words in mind.\u201dWith a grin on my face, he stepped back, seemingly unconcerned. Vespers was one of those who didn\u2019t belong to Queen Liness. I knew what he was saying wasn\u2019t a warning but advice from his experience. Surely I was in a precarious situation in his perspective as well.The prince with nothing was too fearless. Except what he didn\u2019t know was that I wasn\u2019t without anything.* * *\u2018Cut the tail.\u2019Queen Liness got rid of everything that could be dangerous to her in the name of her business with me. If she removed existences that could become evidence one by one, she would have nothing to be afraid of someday. She had to be aiming for that time. I thought she\u2019d act right away, but she was being quite careful for some reason.While reading silently, Amy came in.\u201cMajesty, I brought some snacks.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dShe blushed at my smile.\u201cYour Majesty. The fourth prince and the second princess have returned to the palace.\u201d\u201cBarris and Winley?\u201dIt was surprisingly good news. I looked up, and she nodded quietly.\u201cYes, he must have come straight from the country when he heard that you had woken up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good news.\u201d\u201cHe said he would stop by here immediately after he meets the King.\u201d\u201cThen can we just let it go? Please prepare some refreshments as well as good tea.\u201dShe grinned and heeded my words.* * *The current king, Crianes Al Rown, had a wife and two concubines. The first wife was the current Queen Liness. His first concubine was Anisha, and his second was Alice.My mother was supposed to be the queen, but she died when I was a child. Since then, some political tricks must\u2019ve been used in removing the records of my mother. Eventually, The only traces of her existence left were the ones in the first Prince\u2019s Palace where I stayed. When I looked at the picture without saying a word, I saw a black-haired beauty holding a little me and smiling kindly.It felt narcissistic, but I thought my face was quite gentle and handsome. Just as I received quite a few of my mother\u2019s genes, she was also a beautiful woman who looked really beautiful.\u201cThanks to the good genes you passed onto me, your handsome son is doing well.\u201dI tried to talk to her, but of course, no answer came.\u201cIs it worth living there?\u201dPerhaps she reincarnated and had been living well somewhere in this world or another. There was no way to see her again, considering I could never find her.\u201cPlease wait a little longer. I can\u2019t just let the people who killed my mother die without first paying the price.\u201d\u201cDavey, brother!\u201d\u201cBig brother! It\u2019s Winley! I\u2019m here!\u201dI had been quietly waiting for them with cookies and tea when I heard two urgent voices.\u201cI\u2019m here. Come on in, you two.\u201dIt felt amazing to hear the voices that I missed so much. As soon as I let them in, the door burst open, and a little boy and girl jumped in. They were cute mid-teens who looked good with their green hair.Fourteen years old. Fourth Prince Barris and his fraternal twin Winley, the second princess.\u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cBrother! I heard that you woke up, and I ran straight to see you. What a relief!\u201dI stroked Barris\u2019s head, who was shouting adorably, as Winley came up to me.\u201cAre you guys doing well?\u201dWhen I asked them with a smile, they nodded vigorously. \u201cYou know who I am! I\u2019m your little brother. There is nothing hard about living in the countryside.\u201d\u201cHuh! You always whine about it, though.\u201d\u201cWhat? Hey! I\u2019m your older brother. You\u2019ve been complaining about the robbers too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! You were born five minutes earlier than me.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dI smiled as they chatted loudly. They were some of the few people who weren\u2019t my enemies, and I trusted them as always.Attack.Unlike the stupid, thoughtless second Prince Carlos and the grim, twisted-minded Benedict, they turned out to be unbelievably delightful. They looked just like a normal twin brother and sister who squabbled a lot instead of royal family members. The two wild kids busied themselves with rambling at each other.I felt that I was really looking at the kids in their early teens. They were only fourteen years old, an age when they should still be playing around. That was how I saw it.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well. Let\u2019s see. You little ones grew up so well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been six years. When you got sick, we were sent straight to the countryside.\u201dI smiled at Barris, who murmured angrily.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard about the gist of it.\u201dIt was definitely Queen Liness who got rid of any candidates to become the next king. Queen Liness was so cold that she sent Tanya away, the first daughter of the King\u2019s concubine. She sold her to another country for her reputation. Hence, it wasn\u2019t that strange that she got rid of Barris and Winley, who liked to wander around.\u201cHave you seen father?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow is he doing?\u201d\u201cHe looked a little tired, and\u2026\u201dBarris paused for a moment. At the same time, Winley seemed puzzled.\u201cDavey, have you not seen father?\u201d\u201cNo, not yet.\u201dIt made Winley\u2019s face crumple, showing her dissatisfaction.\u201cOh, my God.\u201dHis son woke up from a coma after six years. It had been five months since then, but I hadn\u2019t seen him once.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see him soon.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026\u201dUnlike Carlos and Benedict, they had been good to me even though our mothers were different. They were so affectionate to me, though they had a strong will. That was why I trusted them.\u201cThe Queen was too harsh\u2026\u201dWinley came up to me in tears, so I patted her on the back without saying a word.\u201cHow is your body? I saw it on the way here. The condition of the palace\u2026\u201dI nodded at Barris, who couldn\u2019t finish the sentence without tearing up as well.\u201cThere were people who have embezzled royal funding. I\u2019ve taken them all away before you guys. The palace should look good again soon.\u201dBarris gritted his teeth.\u201cHow come they left the garden like this? They must have taken advantage of you being in bed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like I said, I can take care of myself. Let\u2019s talk about you guys. I heard you two are chasing a herd of local pirates.\u201d\u201cWe are.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI was surprised that even princess Winley was involved in chasing the thieves with Barris. However, I had no power to do anything about it.Winley used to hate life in the palace, just like Barris, and it was all because of her wild character.She was incredibly talented in magic and was just a different breed who enjoyed her life like a spring sprout, unlike other aristocratic ladies.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve already seen blood. I wish you only saw pretty and good things.\u201d\u201cThis idiot would be badly hurt without me.\u201dBarris, sitting right next to her, frowned and grumbled when she pinched his cheek.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\u201cDid I say something wrong? You charge in like a battering ram!\u201dQueen Liness sent kids to the battlefield, who were only fourteen years olds. It was such a terrible act. If they weren\u2019t talented, their lives would\u2019ve ended in tragedy.I began to laugh in vain.\u201cSo when are you going to come back?\u201d\u201cHonestly, I feel at ease there. Even though I hate fighting, at least I don\u2019t have to stay in the suffocating palace.\u201dIt seemed like that was what they wanted as well.\u201cBut Anisha is here. Wait, you guys went to see Anisha, right?They seemed discomforted by my question.\u201cSigh\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it. You should see her right now. What are you two still doing here?\u201dTheir face turned pale as I waved and spoke.\u201cHi-Hi-Hih! Yes, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cBrother! We\u2019ll be back in the evening!\u201dI smiled at them as I watched them run. Amy also smiled at them slightly with her head down, waiting in the distance to serve us.* * *In the palace, there was a queen and two concubines.the eldest daughter of Duke Varietta, had replaced the queen after my mother died.The two concubines were Anisha, the first concubine, and Alice, the second concubine. Barris and Winley were the children of Anisha.Queen Liness didn\u2019t favor the first concubine. Unlike Alice, Queen Liness\u2019s favorite, Anisha had a good friendship with my mother back when she was alive.Consequently, Anisha, the first concubine, was unfavored by Queen Liness, who hated any of my mother\u2019s traces. Well, Anisha\u2019s hatred was stronger, who sent her kids to somewhere remote from the palace.It was best for her children to be in a safe area that her family had power over. At least Barris and Winley had been guarded by the local soldiers who were loyal to her household.Barris and Winley, in return, were furious about the fact that their mother was being frightened by the queen.It was late at night when the twins came back to see me. Amy got emotional when she saw the palace was regaining its original appearance as new servants started working in the place.Did I overload her with work?When I asked her, she shook her head. She seemed happy, almost as if she was a child.Barris asked, \u201cBrother, now that you\u2019re awake, does that mean that you\u2019re going to be the crowned prince now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, brother! I\u2019m sure you will be the Sage King!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAs you know, the Crowned Prince\u2019s seat is empty in the Rown Kingdom.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThen you will be one.\u201dFlick!I flicked his head with my finger, implying I didn\u2019t want to hear more. He yelled and stepped back in reply.\u201cOw!\u201dI wanted to live for a long time enjoying my life. Being king was an unfortunate occupation where most people died from overwork.It wasn\u2019t surprising that his head was in great pain, simply because my physical ability had exceeded normal human beings.He looked shocked.\u201cCome on, get another drink.\u201d\u201cBrother, I\u2019m considered underage for drinking.\u201d\u201cHuh! Don\u2019t be a prude, Barris. I\u2019m ready for a drink, Davey.\u201dWinley asked for her glass to be filled with wine as she handed it over. She was such a cutie.\u201cHe is way better than our underaged brothers who party all the time-wasting money in the palace.He smiled at me as if he agreed with me.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get a drink!\u201dHe gulped down the wine I poured.\u201cAaah\u2026 it tastes good.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s left by my mother.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t we save it?\u201d\u201cWhy the hell would you save the alcohol that she left for drinking?\u201dBarris looked at me curiously.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot, brother.\u201d\u201cDo I look different?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You used to keep your mother\u2019s traces.\u201dThese little kids remembered everything. \u201cWell, tell me why you came here in the middle of the night.\u201dAfter being silent for a few minutes, I asked them when I noticed that they were hesitating about something. Then, instead of Barris, Winley pulled a small letter from the pouch in her hand.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a continental sword competition held every five years! It\u2019s going to take place in the Duchy of Felicity.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThere was an Olympic-like concept on this continent.continental competitions. Swordsmanship, magic, archery. Even academic.The competition, which covered various fields, revolved around each country, and it was also an excellent opportunity for those who won the prize.Of course, the spectacle was definitely worth seeing because all the future notables and strong individuals would be there. Even aristocrats scalped tickets for the swordsmanship competition.\u201cBrother, you row when the water comes in. You\u2019ve rarely been out of the palace, have you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So I asked father!\u201dProudly shouting, Barris puffed his chest out. Winley poked his ribs with her elbow. \u201cI\u2019ve already told him. The only muscles you have are for standing and smiling.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dI looked at the notice without saying a word as they grumbled again.It was definitely one of the best contests for spectators.The Continental Sword Contest was attended by many promising talents to make a name for themselves continually.As it was a competition to promote the continent\u2019s harmony, anyone, from mercenaries to royalty, could participate if they had the required skill.\u201cAhem! Brother, I got a ticket to the qualifying round!\u201d Barris said proudly with a throbbing heart.\u201cOh, really? You must\u2019ve improved a lot.\u201dI pretended to be surprised, but I could see Mana accumulating in his body.He was an expert intermediate, which meant that he was on a tremendous level compared to his age. His talent was by no means average.\u201cI\u2019m participating, and I\u2019m asking you to watch me. Why don\u2019t we all go together?\u201d\u201cMy brother and I will also see the capital of Winley and the Duchy of Felicity! Hehe! The city of water must be lovely!\u201dI was thankful that it was clearly revealed that I hadn\u2019t been anywhere else since I woke up from my coma.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If you suffer, I\u2019ll carry you on my back!\u201d\u201cI heard from Lord Ramdas of the Royal Court. My brother\u2019s body is recovering at a tremendous rate.\u201d\u201cLucky little ones.\u201dThe words made me laugh. Well, life had become full of leisure. The reason for being tied up like in the past had long since disappeared.It wasn\u2019t detrimental for me to watch such a competition at least once, as Barris said.And then, wait, we could join, right?* * *\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good opportunity.\u201dA woman\u2019s eerie eyes shone into the darkroom.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d crawl into the dragon\u2019s mouth.\u201dThe woman, who was talking coldly and looking down at the cold cup of tea, was Queen Liness. She didn\u2019t even look at her, who was bowing her head in silence.\u201cShari.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to save the man who wants to die.\u201d\u201cThere is only one chance of a raid on the way to the Duchy of Felicity. I\u2019ll scatter their blood in it.\u201d\u201cIf you fail, it\u2019s going to be a huge blow.\u201d\u201cThey have no chance of survival.\u201dEven if his bloodline hadn\u2019t continued, he was still a member of the same royal family.Liness Varietta seemed to feel no guilt about making her do it.\u201cYes, but you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, so you better finish it yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026 As contracted.\u201dWhen she said that, the woman-in-law, Shari, answered coldly, grasping at her coldly subsiding life.* * *In most countries, the competition where promising young people participated was truly remarkable. Of course, it was safe to say that the royal family didn\u2019t oppose Barris\u2019 participation in the continental sword competition.What was a little surprising was that Queen Liness, who had never looked at anyone else\u2019s children with kindness, readily agreed to let him participate in the competition and to me accompanying him.If Barris were to win a prize in the competition, his position would soar completely different from Carlos, who only believed in himself.Of course, Queen Liness, who didn\u2019t want such a situation, would have to oppose his participation, but she was willing to allow it for some unknown reason.In addition, she expressed her willingness to accept me joining the ranks under the pretext of nursing care.A series of groups approached us, kneeling on one knee on the altar of the Mana Gate, which led to the estate nearest the Duchy of Felicity.\u201cRaise your head.\u201dIt was a stern voice, but on the other hand, it also sounded tired.At the end of the silent raise, a middle-aged man came out and looked at the procession to the Duchy of Felicity, including Barris and Winley.He was Crianes Al Rown, King of the Rown Kingdom.He was the king of this country and my father. That was the first time I saw my father in nearly half a year after I woke up.\u2018You\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u2019I peered at him closely. His former cheerful and imposing figure was hard to find in his current appearance. For six years, or a little longer than that, my father had been transformed into a completely different person.He had now become a weary old lion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if he wasn\u2019t really interested in the conversation at hand.\u201cYes, Your Majesty! I will surely win the prize and elevate the status of the kingdom.\u201dWhen asked such a question, Barris answered it as vigorously as he had always done.I wasn\u2019t sure if the answer itself quite satisfactory. Regardless, King Crianes soon brushed his beard off, nodded, and sighed briefly.\u201cBe safe.\u201dAfter tapping Barris on the shoulder and smiling at him, he immediately turned his head away. Then, his gaze rested upon me.A look of mixed emotions was visible on his face.I was pretty good at reading people, but his expression was hard to discern.He was, after all, a man of dignity. Even old and tired lions never lost their dignity.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say anymore.I had no intention of being sentimental with him at that moment, so I just looked down.\u201cListen! Fourth Prince Barris\u2019s participation in the Continental Sword Contest is the bliss of the kingdom! As of this day, I will release extra funds to celebrate a festival in our territory!\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dThe nobles all answered at the shout of Crianes.\u201cGive special amnesty to those who have sinned small!\u201dThere were some odd faces of disapproval with the King\u2019s order since it only happened when there was a big national event, but no one dared disobey his order.Still, special amnesty was one of the most incomprehensible laws.\u201cGo on and boost the status of the kingdom!\u201dAt the end of his remark, Barris noded, slowly lifting his head.\u201cOpen the gate!\u201dPssssszzzzzz!When the wizard who was manipulating the mana gate shouted, a vast blue circular structure built behind me began to emit light.The bizarre wave of power slowly created a whirlpool with a considerable gap. It began to shine as if the light would completely cover the raised podium where the procession to the Duchy of Felicity was standing.Ssssssshh!Soon after, the wizard\u2019s incantation came out, causing a huge wave to devour all the processions.King Crianes\u2019 expressionless face glanced beyond as we disappeared into the light. I closed my eyes, remaining silent, as Queen Liness maintained her own mysterious air.* * *The procession to the Duchy of Felicity was small.Fourth Prince Barris led the way to participate, and Winley and I accompanied him to support him. In addition to that, there were only five butlers, five or six maids, and five knights for escort.Of course, four of them were the best in swordsmanship.Considering that every one of them was a strategic-weapon-level talent, they could guarantee our safety.Their expertise would eventually defeat any hostility.Perhaps because of that, it was such a tedious journey. There weren\u2019t even any animals on the way, much more mountain thieves.\u201cOh\u2026 boring.\u201dBarris, who had lived wildly, seemed unable to endure such uneventfulness.\u201cYou idiot! Boring is the best thing!\u201d\u201cDo you like this extreme boredom?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t! But do you want to be attacked by somebody when Davey is here with us, you idiot?\u201dBarris cringed at Winley\u2019s criticism before he went and looked at me.I was supposed to go on a horse carriage because I had been sick not that long ago. Barris realized that and put me in the horse-drawn carriage.Thanks to him, it became more tedious, but I was thankful for his thoughtfulness.\u201cWe should camp here today.\u201d Sir Blcano, the knight who was leading the way, promptly suggested.It was going to take another day to get to the Duchy of Felicity on horseback. We could\u2019ve been gone through the Mana Gate, but unfortunately, the Duchy of Felicity was one of the smallest countries.As a result, there was no Mana Gate. To move, we had to travel through one of ours to a nearby state and then walk directly by land.Fortunately, the territory of the Duchy of Felicity was quite close to the Rown.The servants and maids taking care of us were experienced for camps, and our knights were scattered to guard the site. Barris then began to ask, throwing branches into the bonfire, \u201cHow do you feel, Davey?\u201d\u201cRight, do you like the gift we\u2019ve got for you? In the past, you said you wanted to go camping like this on an adventure. We thought you wouldn\u2019t like a big group of people with us, so I minimized the size.\u201dThey were smiling at me as if they were waiting for compliments from me, which made me laugh in turn.\u201cYes, thank you, you two.\u201dThey could\u2019ve cared less about me because we were only half-related, but their warm-hearted care touched me.Barris sat down and excitedly talked about how we used to play together when we were little. Meanwhile, Winley was making fun of Barris but seemed just as excited, seeing as she was smiling the whole time.\u201cDavey?\u201dHowever, despite their conversation, my eyes were fixated on the other side of the forest.\u201cHey, Davey.\u201dWinley called out to me, carefully sensing the unusual look on my face.\u201cOh\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d\u201cTry some of this.\u201d\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d\u201cWhat were you looking at so closely?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Davey. Is there something over there?\u201dI ignored his question. Upon seeing my movements, the two seemed to feel concerned for me.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s late, so I\u2019ll go in and rest first. Will you rest in the carriage with me?\u201dThe two shook their heads at my suggestion. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with tents, sir.\u201d\u201cMe, too.\u201dWho would think that they were noble royalty?Barris was fine, but I was a little worried about Winley for being too wild.\u201cHmm. I guess camping just fits your wild nature. I\u2019m a little worried about how you\u2019re going to find a husband, though.\u201d\u201cPfft. I\u2019m not going to be married but live with Davey instead. Mind your own business, Barris.\u201dWinley stuck out her tongue at Barris and hugged my arm. When I went to stroke her head silently, Barris clicked his tongue.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you punk.\u201d\u201cPhooey!\u201dThey went to their tent set by servants, both sporting sad expressions. Silence then dawned at the campsite. The conversation had been cut off, after all. The two, who were mainly leading the talks, had already gone to rest.As I sat silently and looked at the sky, Amy approached me carefully and asked, \u201cYour Majesty, would you like to go in and rest?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day for a walk.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI then got up without answering her question.* * *While everyone was already asleep, I sat on a tree branch nearby the campsite, slowly moving my gaze to the sky from a book.Although they would\u2019ve been in chaos if anyone noticed that I had disappeared, I replaced myself with Ghost magic that I had saved for a time like this.The book I had been reading was about the continent\u2019s political situation when I was in a coma and medical practice. I shouldn\u2019t neglect my physical training, but I should take care of my medical expertise as well.My medical technique proficiency was considered to be quite excellent, and I was still the best student in a master of the Divine Hippocrates\u2019s class.\u201cIt is a beautiful night sky.\u201dI just talked to myself.The night sky was lit up by red and blue moons showing off their power.Cyrus, the moon that illuminated the beginning, and Krias, the moon that illuminated the end.The moon that brightened the night of the first and the moon that brightened the night of the last had quite a few stories, but most of them proved to be too exaggerated to keep me interested.Meanwhile, I just thought that the moons looked beautiful.They filled the night sky along with numerous stars and galaxies that spread out, illuminating the evening brightly, making me wonder if it was really nighttime.Nothing was the same in the night sky of the Earth or the Corridor. I found myself suddenly wondering if Barris and Winley had brought me here to show such a view to me.The dark sky I saw here was completely different from the one I saw in the palace, though they were both beautiful.Ssssss!All I could hear was the sound of insects and owls. I casually put down the book in my hand and swung a nearby branch in the air lightly.Whip! Whip!Each swing tore through the air with a faint sound.Well, it was still satisfying.\u201cNow that I\u2019m done watching the night, I should try my evening exercise.\u201dMy eyes were fixed on a single spot without moving. I then saw a movement of a group of men dressed in black.After all, commanders generally had good night vision.There were about 20 people, and they had professionally hidden their murderous spirits.They were assassins with extraordinary abilities, able to safely accomplish their duties despite all the unfavorable conditions.If I were an ordinary person without any physical strength, the consequences that would follow my ignorance would\u2019ve been a brutal murder.The whole story was obvious. The only opportunity to take us three children\u2019s lives had finally come.Queen Liness seemed to have chosen to send murderers to assassinate us rather than leave potential sources of trouble for nothing.To be honest, I wasn\u2019t happy about the situation where I might look suspicious if I were to show my ability. Hence, I quickly let go of my thoughts without much regret.I didn\u2019t have to worry about it in the first place.\u201cThey are too slow to make ends meet as assassins.\u201dThe people who could see me running wild in the first place\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOuch.\u201d[Mountain Pressure]They didn\u2019t exist.A slender branch suddenly became an enormous mountain and, in doing so, sliced the highly-trained assassins\u2019 bodies in half.Dark red blood splashed over the night sky, warming up the atmosphere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 14The Duchy of FelicityThe quiet incident managed to silence the surroundings completely.Ssssslit!Without even knowing how he died, the man was split in half and fell, his blood spilling profusely.Sssssss!Red fluids that couldn\u2019t withstand the pressure had begun to splash all over the place. Still, I calmly brushed off the dust on the branch in my hand.If one didn\u2019t have a tooth, they had to chew with gums.Since I didn\u2019t have a sword with me, I had to use a branch instead. That was what Thousand Horse Dok Go-jun said, and I considered him my second teacher of swordsmanship.-Everything becomes a weapon when you hold it in your hand. Don\u2019t forget: there\u2019s no law in a fight. Weapons are an extension of physical attacks. Depending on how you think, a piece of cloth could become a rare high-class sword.My sudden attack seemed to make the people moving in secrecy stumble, for they apparently couldn\u2019t handle the shock I had created.Even if it was just a branch in my hand, the skill of the assassins proved to be insultingly poor compared to Hermes, who had taught me the art of killing.That was the light Stroke of Bell.However, when the Thousand-Force Hammer technique, invented by Thousand Horse Dokgojun, and Haris\u2019 sword technique, shared subversive, destructive power, branches would inevitably turn into a mountain. No assassin would be able to withstand the pressure, no matter how good of a team they were.\u201cAs soon as you got the chance, you tried to raid, you dullards.\u201dIt definitely seemed that the injury made it difficult for them to scatter back into the forest.The assassins stared at me with intense eyes, all without moving their bodies.\u201cJust for clarification, did Queen liness send you here?\u201dI asked a question, but no answer came forth. I didn\u2019t think they would answer my question anyway. Hence, I wasn\u2019t all too disappointed.The tension had undeniably gone a little higher, considering I had only started to warm up after such a long time without combat.\u201cI know you\u2019ve been waiting for your chance. You crawled here without knowing it was a trap.\u201dI clicked my tongue as I swung the branch in lightly, making some of the assassins gasp and collapse at the sight.\u201cI wonder what she\u2019s planning to do now.\u201dI was genuinely curious. After all, there were only three royal families.If we were assassinated on the way to another country, the entire royal family would be shaken. It was going to be hard to handle the aftermath, even for Queen Liness.There were only two factors to think about.She was either confident that she would never leave a trace or planned to pin the blame on someone else. Either way, from her perspective, it was definitely worth a try. She must\u2019ve done something similar in the past to shake the real power of this country.\u201cHmm? Are you still here?\u201dThey all looked confused by my question.According to the information they received, their target was but a mere sick prince who could barely travel alone. They wouldn\u2019t have expected that I could dominate them in their own field: attacking without anyone noticing.They wouldn\u2019t even think that I was able to find them since they had just been watching me at the campsite from a distance while waiting for their chance.Either way, they probably didn\u2019t see this coming. What astonished them most was probably the worthless-looking branch in my hand.It wasn\u2019t a strong, sharp sword but a thin branch that could be found anywhere in the forest. Regardless, a single Stroke of Bell could weigh down the surrounding area and instantly split my target\u2019s physique in half.Unless they were a bunch of morons, they must\u2019ve already noticed that the force wasn\u2019t from brute strength.\u201cPatience is the key in assassinations. Keep that in mind.\u201dI could feel the invisible expressions of the assassins cooling down. Their faces morphed into aggression.When I collected the unidentified pressure pressing them even though I wasn\u2019t attacking them anymore, they began to look at each other\u2019s eyes. I could read their expressions even without using the Mind-Reading technique.They had received the wrong information. The mission could now be considered a total failure.\u201cGo tell her. She\u2019ll be destroyed eventually, even if she doesn\u2019t ask for it.\u201dWhen I stopped and stayed still, they looked at each other and squinted at me in an attempt to understand my intentions.Was I really trying to let them go? I was sure they were all wondering about that.\u2018Yeah, go ahead.\u2019I put the branch down and stood still. They soon realized that I wasn\u2019t kidding at all. Soon enough, the assassins turned around and began to run away.\u2018I was kidding, you bunch of stupid jackasses.\u2019[Rupture]Poof!In an instant, a flash of black light penetrated their bodies as if something thick had completely pierced through them. In shock, they couldn\u2019t believe what just happened despite not feeling any pressure on their physiques.\u201cKkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.\u201dOne of the assassins who had been penetrated began to tremble and tried to get up again. He stared at me with his bloodshot eyes.\u2018You said you\u2019d let me go, you fucking bastard!\u2019His glare screamed those words out. Upon seeing such a sight, I instinctively spoke out.\u201cDid you believe my words? You stupid bastard. I just said that assassination is patience. I guess you forgot.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026 what assassination\u2026\u201dHow absurd it must\u2019ve been to see the person who had been silent until now answering back, all while throwing up blood excessively. It was hard to understand him, however, for he had lost all strength in his voice.\u201cIf no one\u2019s watching, then it\u2019s considered an assassination. That\u2019s also a long-standing quote, so keep that in mind.\u201dI took a step forward. Instinctively feeling danger, the remaining guys scattered, dashing away in an attempt to escape.Some of them had lost their judgment and came at me. I wasn\u2019t sure what they were thinking. Obviously, the raid failed, and they had zero chance of winning in a frontal assault against me.Their speed was definitely fast and sharp. I could give them that.The attack was threatening enough that it felt a little different from the first time. However, all I had to do was quietly swing the branch in my hand against them.Whoo! Whoo!As the stubby and thin branch flashed once, a black flame with white brilliance rose along its trajectory. As the men rushed at me, they were cut in two simultaneously.The durability was strong enough. For a human being, that was.As they fell like chopped logs, I immediately called forth my command mana, putting one hand on the ground while holding the branch with the other.Black magic and command magic was the most efficient way to track down, stop, and break down opponents.That was the case at the Halls of Heroes.Ro Aias was the best at finding me when I didn\u2019t want to attend the training. She was called Death Road in the Pesquisa Continent, a completely different world from this place. She had managed to trick people with a tearful face, blocking the retreating road of her enemy in the back. Her tracking skills proved to be excellent.Was she too nice? It wasn\u2019t all that surprising if I considered how Daphne, the first saint, turned to violence when she started drinking.Ro Aias used to be an eccentric black wizard who worked her whole life trying to help black wizards live with people.I didn\u2019t even want to recall what happened to me after I was caught.[Chase][Blind]Whoo!I saw black whips coming out of their fingertips.It was the black magic of the first circle system, which took away the opponent\u2019s vision and worked stronger against those who were living in extreme fear. They could\u2019ve easily overcome it if only they had a little more resistance.\u201cKkkk!\u201d\u201cBuck!\u201dI had already locked on when I ran into them.Unless they traveled to the other side of the continent, there would be no way out. The magical effects soon appeared, and its intensity started to increase. Those who lost their sight began to struggle to get away from me, forgetting their original goal of silently moving through the night.Was I enjoying this?Now, I could see why Ro Aias looked sorry yet simultaneously happy for some reason.In extreme fear, they struggled to escape from me. Unfortunately, I had no intention of keeping them alive once I already had them in my hand.It was up to me whether I would kill or save them. If one wanted to kill someone, they should be prepared against the risk of their own deaths.I put a string to the assassins that crawled away with black magic and to those that fell against the command mana.I conjured more black-hued command mana, which I then caused to explode and spread.[Confusion][Low Resistance][Soul Explosion]It was all a little harsh, but I was taught by my masters how to clean a scene properly.Don\u2019t show mercy to those who try to kill you.Tooowooo!Intangible, odorless, and colorless spirits scattered, spreading light waves around.More than half of their souls burst out and disappeared immediately without any chance of rehabilitation. They had all gone silent.The quiet forest turned into a terrible murder scene.\u201cThat\u2019s a neat assassination.\u201dI wondered if it was necessary to make such a big scene, to which I shook my head.I then moved on without regret. Whatever it was, it was a successful assassination for as long as no one found out.* * *\u201cQueen Majesty.\u201dThe black shadow slowly appeared in the quiet room like a mirage.\u201cHow did it go?\u201d\u201cThe attempt failed.\u201dSlap!As soon as she finished her sentence, Shari\u2019s face, who brought the bad news, was forced to turn sideways. She had hit her so hard that her white cheek turned red, and her lips were about to burst.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?!\u201dIt was a hysterical shout.The calamitous temperament of Queen Liness wasn\u2019t new to those who were always around her.\u201cAll the mana stones were designed to lose its glow when the assassins died.\u201d\u201cFailure\u2026 What happened?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t figured it out yet. However, I think someone is helping him.\u201dSlap!Once again, Shari\u2019s cheek turned with a loud noise. Meanwhile, Queen Liness continued to throw everything around her to release her anger.Clang!A small flowerpot hit Shari\u2019s forehead. She gasped, staring at Shari with a venomous look.\u201cHuh! That\u2019s all that the Black Moon Guild can do after all!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow come they were all wiped out against only four old knights and three little kids? Twenty assassins being unable to handle a few knights? Pathetic!\u201dAlthough Shari was mad as the Queen shouted, she simply stood silently with her head down.\u201cFind out who\u2019s helping him! Show me the obstacles in my way!\u201d\u201cYes, Queen Majesty.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget. I didn\u2019t look after your Black Moon Guild to see you fail. You need to take their lives. If you fail again this time\u2026\u201dShe stared at Shari with a cold gaze and continued.\u201cI will no longer have any more dealings with you. I will end the Black Moon Guild by using the Duke of Varietta and the power of this country.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dShari, bowed down, closed her eyes slowly, and smiled as the Queen stopped talking and poured tea into her mouth.Her eyes were lit up by a faint blood-like glow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Very, very small.It was about the size of a small city-state like Singapore.The size of the city was a little larger than the cities in other countries, however.\u201cWow, Davey! Look! It\u2019s the Duchy of Felicity!\u201d\u201cHo!\u201d Winley shouted while jumping, admiration evident in her voice.Her eyes were filled with excitement as she looked at the vast and beautiful water surrounding the whole city.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dIt was pure and without a single lie.As a small country, the Duchy of Felicity had a distinctive charm. It had a magnificent view that was no less beautiful than any other empire.Large waterways surrounding the capital were connected to various parts of the city, almost like a beautiful painting on a canvas.\u201cThe Duchy of Felicity is a small city-state, but as a city-state built over ancient ruins, it has an outstanding view even when compared to most countries.\u201dBarris, who had gotten off his horse, boasted at the city\u2019s excellence as I was looking around.\u201cLook at your face. You must quite like it.\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201dAs I expressed my honest impression, he proudly puffed his chest.\u201cHahaha! I\u2019m glad you like the view. It was worth coming here. The competition will last for four days. That means you have plenty of time to enjoy our trip.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Davey, why don\u2019t you go on a tour of the city tomorrow? For now, you should go and see the round stadium with us. It is the pride of the Duchy of Felicity.\u201d\u201cRound stadium?\u201d\u201cYes! I heard it\u2019s a wonderful stadium with a beautiful waterway. It\u2019ll be crowded tomorrow, so let\u2019s go and see it today instead!\u201d\u201cShall we do that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t steal my words!\u201d\u201cHeng! It would be best if you met the management administrator. I\u2019m going to show Davey around.\u201dWinley couldn\u2019t participate in the competition because she was never taught swordsmanship. Nevertheless, she came to the trip for me, as well as to support her twin brother.Even though it looked like they were always competing against each other, they cared about the other in reality.* * *The main revenue of the Duchy of Felicity was tourism.The architectural style and various sculptures inside were quite mysterious and beautiful, while the city\u2019s exterior was immensely beautiful.One of the tourist spots was the arena that a lot of nobles from other countries visited at least once in their lifetime.\u201cThis is going to be where the combat happens. There will be gladiators, monsters, or competitors who come here to compete, Davey.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless and barbaric.\u201dBarris grumbled at my comment for some reason.\u201cI guess the peace-stricken public wants something more stimulating.\u201dBarris smiled bitterly at my words afterward.\u201cThe human rights sector is slowly getting better, though. One day, the Kingdom of Rown\u2026\u201d He began to murmur hopefully.\u201cHow many people are going to be there?\u201dI looked around the stadium, and Winley pushed him forward at my question and smiled.\u201cI heard that eight countries would participate in the combat this year. Surprisingly, Barris will represent the Rown Kingdom.\u201d\u201cHey! Did you just say it\u2019s surprising?!\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dWinley giggled before she gave off a weird sneer.\u201cStarting with the first host country, Palan Empire, representatives will be selected from various countries, including the Rown Kingdom, Flip Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Shodan.\u201dThe purpose of the continental swordsmanship competition was to discover the talents of young people. Still, it was basically nothing but a battle of pride between countries.\u201cSince it\u2019s for young people, only men and women under the age of twenty can participate.\u201d\u201cWhat about the people who aren\u2019t selected?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a national competition for new talents. It\u2019s not considered as the main swordfight season for top talents.\u201dWinley grumbled as if she didn\u2019t like it. \u201cThe opportunity to participate should be given to any talented people from all classes.\u201d\u201cThere will be too many participants if they did that.\u201dThe statement was true. In other words, it was just a show.\u201cOh! I\u2019ve heard that the Sword Princess of the Palan Empire is also participating in this competition.\u201d\u201cSword Princess?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? She\u2019s pretty famous. Even the little kids in the Rown Kingdom would know who she is.\u201d Barris asked me in surprise. However, nothing came to mind.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI had a pretty good memory, though. I guessed she became famous while I was in a coma.\u201cHey! Davey was in a coma!\u201dWhen Barris tilted his head curiously, Winley became furious and kicked him on the shin.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cHuh! What a sight!\u201d\u201cYou punk.\u201dI stared blankly at them while they were fighting. Barris soon made a groaning voice.\u201c[Ileana de Palan]. She is the precious daughter of the Palan Empire\u2019s King. As you know, they have eight princes and only one princess.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Their nation is definitely a great powerhouse.\u201d\u201cOf course, they\u2019re famous. However, she\u2019s renowned not just because the Palan is in great power, and she is the only princess. She is famous because she is the owner of the New Sword.\u201d\u201cNew Sword?\u201dThe word \u201cNew Sword\u201d instantly intrigued me.\u201cYes, the owner of Calderas, an ancient hero known for his sword, the sword of the sword god Haris. It\u2019s one of the greatest works of his life.\u201dCalderas.It had been a while since I last heard that name.The swordsman had excellent swordsmanship, even though he had a bad temper. I had also heard a lot about the sword that he had used.The sword could cut down the devil.\u201cCalderas\u2026\u201dTwo people had taught me swordsmanship. Haris, the God of Swords in the ancient history of the Tionis Continent, and another was Dok Go-jun, the Thousand Horse of Devil Creed.Thinking about it, I realized Haris was from here, so it wouldn\u2019t be that strange to find his traces.\u201cIt\u2019s called a new sword since it hasn\u2019t rusted even after thousands of years. I\u2019ve heard that it has an ego that expresses magic on its own.\u201d\u201cEgo\u2026\u201dThe sword contained the spirit of the master craftsman and the compassion of the user; that was the ego.\u201cThe sword had been searching for its owner for hundreds of years and finally chosen its owner recently. That\u2019s Princess Ileana.\u201dBarris smiled and added an explanation. \u201cThere\u2019s another reason why she\u2019s famous, Davey.\u201d\u201cAnother one?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dHe smiled insidiously. \u201cShe\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s even so-called one of the top five beauties on the continent in full bloom.\u201dI wasn\u2019t interested in who the owner of Calderas, the favorite sword of Haris. The most interesting subject so far was what Barris had just said.* * *The physiology of the aristocracy was quite simple. All of the participants in the continental swordsmanship competition were representatives that the state had chosen.They were also expected to lead the nation in the future.Should we just have them fight?Of course not.Consequently, they had arranged a dinner party to promote friendship among those expected to become leaders in the future.It made sense that Barris had been invited to the dinner. However, it was a little surprising that Winley and I were invited as well.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d Amy asked me carefully when I looked at myself, swallowing a groan.\u201cIsn\u2019t this too flashy? Do you have more modest clothes?\u201d\u201cNo, this is modest enough, Your Majesty!\u201dShe shouted firmly with a sad face as if she didn\u2019t want to yield. My conscience told me that I might\u2019ve given Amy a hard time, based on her sorrowful expression.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cMajesty, your dignity is the Rown Kingdom\u2019s dignity. Even if you don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. You\u2019ve done enough. Let\u2019s go now.\u201d\u201cAs you wish!\u201dShe looked down a few minutes ago as if she would immediately burst into tears. Now, however, she looked excited.I was busy getting ready for the dinner party.Of course, it was fortunate that men did less. Winley said it was hundreds of times worse for women.\u201cEh, you can\u2019t put lipstick on a pig. Even if you do, it\u2019s still a pig!\u201d\u201cHey!\u201dPuck!I could see the twins grumbling about whether or not they were ready to go to the banquet.\u201cOh! Davey, my older brother!\u201dWhile snarling at Barris, Winley found me first and ran towards me with her eyes shining brightly. Barris, who just got kicked on the shin, seemed to have no time to find regard for it.\u201cWow! You look great!\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cUnlike the playboy over there!\u201d\u201cHey! Why am I a playboy?\u201d\u201cWhat? Did I say something wrong?\u201dI knew they were on good terms, but what if someone else were to see them grumbling and fighting again?\u201cYou look pretty. I thought a fairy came down.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dIt was lip service, but it turned out to be partially true.The green dress matched the color of her green hair. She was a pretty lady for her age, where most people had yet excessive glamour or unbecoming maturity.Perhaps, in a few more years, she would turn out to be extraordinarily beautiful. Winley reached out to me, holding the hem of the dress and twirling around.\u201cWell, then, wonderful prince. Would you be honored to escort me today?\u201d\u201cIt looks like our positions have switched. There\u2019s no reason for me to refuse.\u201dWhen I lightly held her hand, I heard Barris clicking his tongue.\u201cShe\u2019s irritating.\u201dOf course, Winley was still happy, considering how used she was to such comments from him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Kram, the Head Chamberlain of the Duchy of Felicity.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work, Kram.\u201dAs we entered the place, I saw servants and maids waiting for the guests with their heads down. Barris smiled kindly.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d\u201cI wonder if we\u2019re too late.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dResponding politely, he quietly pointed to the entrance of the banquet hall.\u201cPlease come in. Most of the VIPs are already here.\u201d\u201cI shall ask your favor.\u201d\u201cPlease leave it to me.\u201dWhen he sent a signal to the other servants, they quietly opened the door, revealing a colorful and spacious room.When we entered, people inside the hall immediately turned their heads towards us.CombatThe age limit for participants in the continental swordsmanship competition was under twenty. Due to that condition, most of the party attendees looked young.for the people who came along with the competitors like Winley, most of them were quite young.The attention we got from them was intense. However, Barris didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by it. Instead, he kept walking in with a smile.\u201cDavey, shall we go?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWith Winley\u2019s beautiful smile and her quiet voice, we entered slowly, following after Barris.Having a lot of people\u2019s attention was weirding me out. Our arrival seemed to make them tremendously curious.A lot of people were interested in Barris. His skill was a little higher than an intermediate level, which was already above his age.Their knowledge of him might not have been accurate, but they must\u2019ve heard about him all the same. As a competitor, they were interested in him.At least, in the upcoming competition, they were opponents.\u201cDamn, I\u2019ve heard he is talented, but he is good-looking as well.\u201d\u201cBy the way, is she Princess Winley?\u201d\u201cShe is beautiful.\u201dI heard some people murmuring in the distance. They probably didn\u2019t think I could hear them. However, I happened to have excellent ears.However, Barris and Winley, smiling awkwardly, didn\u2019t seem to hear their voice.\u201cNice to meet you, Prince Barris. I am the Duke of Perdisha Kingdom\u2019s Koldium.\u201d\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you. I am the Duke of Voltis of the Hushan Kingdom.\u201dNaturally, there were boundaries between competitors. On the other hand, they seemed to think it was worth getting to know each other.Barris looked at me for help as a lot of people approached him with a smile on their faces.Sometimes\u2026\u201cWinley, Would you like to dance with me?\u201dIt was good to ignore someone\u2019s plea for help.\u201cHey, Davey\u2026\u201dIn the end, I just decided to ignore his annoyed tone of voice.* * *People started to dance with their partners as the music changed in the hall.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve danced together, Davey, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWinley smiled and put her hands down elegantly after the music.\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cI was eight years old when you became comatose. I hadn\u2019t even made my social debut yet.\u201dIn most of the countries in the Tionis continent, the aristocratic and royal family encouraged fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls to begin their social life.It happened a little early for royal families.Winley made her social debut when I was still in a coma.I still couldn\u2019t believe they sent her to chase the local criminals.As she recalled the past, Winley smiled with her eyes fixed on the banquet hall.\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re recovering now. They will learn of your true value someday.\u201dHer genuine smile made me smile as well. They were one of the few affectionate people in the royal palace.Most people in the royal palace of the Rown Kingdom were coldblooded. Hence, I wondered how these guys came out so warm-hearted.\u201cYou were very talented in swordsmanship.\u201dShe reminded me as if I had forgotten about it.\u201cI have no use for the sword now.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019re still young.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you a little too young to say that?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dShe smiled and drank a glass of grape juice.\u201cPrincess Winley.\u201dIt was a gentle voice but quite cheesy at the same time.While Barris had the most attention, Winley was also in the center of attention among the aristocratic males and females.Considering the male-to-female ratio, there was nothing weird about Winley getting a lot of attention, who was admittedly pretty cute.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWinley seemed to know who he was.\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you again.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, Prince Baltian de Voltiz.\u201dShe spoke awkwardly with a stiff expression, taking a step back unintentionally.However, he held out a hand to her as if he didn\u2019t notice her body language.\u201cCan you spend some time talking to me?\u201dIt was rare to see Winley, who wasn\u2019t picky about people, retreating with a dark expression.A sudden curiosity arose.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince Baltian, but I was talking to my brother.\u201dHe turned to me at her words.Although he was aware of my presence right from the beginning, he pretended that he just took notice of me.He clicked his tongue and soon burst into laughter. Even if the aristocrats wanted to beat someone to death, they had to smile externally.\u201cOh, I apologize. I\u2019m Baltian de Voltiz, the seventh prince of the Voltiz Kingdom.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Davey Al Rown.\u201dHis eyebrows wiggled with my short answer.I felt sorry, but it was too late to give a good impression anyway.I looked at his eyes, immediately feeling his contempt.No matter who he was, it was disrespectful to look at the royal family of another country in such a way. However, he didn\u2019t seem to care at all.\u201cWhat brought you here, Prince Davey?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to watch my brother\u2019s game.\u201d\u201cI see. Please enjoy your trip.\u201dHe turned to Winley again, with a creepy smile on his face.\u201cI will give you the honor if I win the Continental Sword Competition, Princess Winley. You are my inspiration.\u201dWinley looked disgusted by the way he spoke in a cheesy tone.Although she was pretty good at presenting herself in public, she couldn\u2019t hide her discomfort at his remarks.\u201cYou should know that it is disrespectful to say that for the people who gathered here.\u201d\u201cYes, but it wouldn\u2019t be rude if it was true.\u201d\u201cMy twin brother is also participating in this competition. It is quite disrespectful to my brother.\u201dWinnie looked up at me as if she didn\u2019t want to hear any more of his nonsense.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Davey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard to step out, but I didn\u2019t mean to burden Winley or Barris. However, when we were just about to leave\u2026\u201cHow dare you ignore me?! Princess Winley!\u201dPrince Baltian quickly reached his arm out to her, who turned her back against him, seemingly unable to stand him anymore.That was it.\u2018I\u2019ve had enough. I can\u2019t take more bullshit.\u2019Poof!Ukhhh!\u201cKkkkh?\u201d\u2018When the chance comes, don\u2019t hesitate.\u2019As I always said, I wasn\u2019t the kind who battled with the knife wrapped in cloth.It also wasn\u2019t like me to put up with rudeness that had gone way too far.* * *It was essential to keep public and private matters separate for royalty and aristocrats.We had to hide our emotions, no matter if we were upset or happy. Such was the life and responsibility of the noble blood.Sometimes I thought it was unfair.No one lived a perfect life, even if they seemed that way on the outside.\u201cOh, my gosh!\u201dBaltian, who fell on one knee, gave out a painful scream, which brought everyone\u2019s attention to us.\u201cHey, Davey.\u201d\u201cYou are not supposed to touch someone else\u2019s precious sister.\u201dI spoke calmly and softly with a smile, which aggravated Prince Baltian even more.\u201cLoud\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I saved your bone.\u201d\u201cKkkh!\u201dI released his wrist, which I was holding tightly, and he immediately gasped and grabbed at it.I could\u2019ve broken his bone simply by twisting his arm, but I didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble.The worst thing that could happen was Barris getting disqualified.Whatever it was, it was okay if there was no evidence left.He was furious now, but his body would still heal after a while, so he would have nothing to complain about. He stared at me with spiteful eyes, but he took a step back from me.The relaxed and cheesy impression he had a while ago was no longer present. Only a boy with a bad temper was in front of us.He took off his gloves and threw them at me.\u201cI challenge you to a duel!\u201dEveryone in the banquet hall was now looking at us, from the young aristocrats and royal families who came here for the competition to the small number of people who accompanied them.I glanced at the gloves on the floor and looked at him coldly.Winley then began to shout furiously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t be rude!\u201d\u201cPlease stay out of this, Princess Winley! He disgraced my honor as a knight\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you cared about honor, you should\u2019ve known how rude you were to Prince Davey.\u201dHe clenched his teeth at her rebuttal. He then shook his head vigorously and shouted, \u201cHush! I demand silence!\u201dHe had evidently lost his mind.Winley looked shocked, just as someone among the crowd spoke, seemingly finding that situation ridiculous.\u201cI think she\u2019s right.\u201dIt was so ridiculous that she couldn\u2019t stand still. It wasn\u2019t me or Barris, who was walking towards us in anger, or Winley, who stopped talking to Baltian, who was screaming in anger.\u201cPrincess Ileana\u2026\u201dBaltian\u2019s face turned pale upon seeing the girl with a pleasing voice.\u201cPrince Baltian de Voltiz.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me ask you again. Do you think you deserve honor?\u201dHer voice was clear and beautiful. However, it was as cold as the snow accompanying the north wind.As I turned my head away from him, shaking hands as he retreated, I saw a little girl staring at him coldly.The girl had waist-length hair that had a brilliant color, like oozing honey. She was dazzlingly gorgeous, and I wasn\u2019t even exaggerating.She looked like an actual goddess. However, when I saw the girl, I had a weird feeling for some reason.\u201cHaris?\u201dHaris the Sword God.Her aura was so similar to the hero of thousands of years ago, who taught me the art of the sword.I spoke my thoughts aloud by mistake, causing the girl to look at me with surprised eyes.\u2018That was dumb\u2026\u2019* * *Sword God, Haris.He was the founder of the Heavy Sword technique, the Undefeatable Swordsmanship, which led him to become the Sword God. His technique turned swords into mountains and seas.However, his nickname in the Hall of Heroes was different.A lazy old man. He looked young for his age, but he was definitely older than the heroes of the Hall, who made fun of him.He was factually male.Although he was quite a fine-looking man, he was definitely not a woman. Yet, the girl in front of me looked like him but was also subtly different at the same time.He would definitely look like her if he were a girl and extremely beautiful.\u201cWait, what did you say?\u201dThe girl, with her eyes wide open, addressed my words.I felt weirded by her surprised expression, and I shook my head fast.\u201cNothing, there must\u2019ve been a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWe looked at each other awkwardly.She stared at me suspiciously for a while before speaking coldly toward Baltian as if she were trying to shake off her thoughts.\u201cI was watching the situation. Let me ask you again, Prince Baltian.\u201dBaltian could only groan.\u201cDo you think you deserve honor?\u201dAs she intervened, many people watched the situation breathlessly. Most of the people here were invited as the representative prospects in each country.\u201cYou insulted this young lady and her partner as well as everyone else in this place. She refused your request politely, but you still treated her with disrespect.\u201dShe must have been watching the situation very carefully.Her cold voice turned Baltian\u2019s face pale.He looked like he knew he screwed himself up. Of course, all the people who gathered here came as representatives of a nation. He shouldn\u2019t have offended anyone in the hall, especially Princess Ileana.The Palan Empire was one of the three superpowers of the present continent.Before us was the precious Princess of the emperor, who was very protective of his daughter. According to rumors, he ordered a palace to be destroyed just to build her a garden.In short, she was a powerful figure. Baltian looked confused and scared.\u201cHuh, if you were a knight of honor, I shall think you should apologize to them sincerely right now.\u201dPublic psychology was frightening. As some people nodded in agreement with her, the rest of the people followed them.Shivering with a red-hot face, he looked like he would run away at any moment.\u201cI accept the duel.\u201dI couldn\u2019t just let him go as he wished to. If I sent him away like this, I wouldn\u2019t be able to rest.\u201cWhat are you doing now\u2026\u201dWinley looked at me, surprised by what I said.Ileana also looked at me with a puzzled expression.She might\u2019ve thought that her effort was rendered useless. I appreciated her effort, sure, but I was strong in my own way.\u201cPrince Baltian, did you ask for a duel?\u201d\u201cY-yes!\u201d\u201cI accept it.\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201d\u201cDavey!\u201dThe twins, Barris and Winley, shouted in horror at the same time.\u201cUgh\u2026 Good! If I win, you shall kneel down and apologize to me in front of everyone!\u201d\u201cHey, Prince Baltian!\u201dFurious, Barris gruffly grabbed him by the collar. \u201cYou know this ridiculous act you\u2019re doing now can turn into a national conflict, right?\u201dBarris shouted sharply as if he was going to knock him down. He looked so furious that he would\u2019ve cut him down right away if no one were around.\u201cHmm\u2026 What\u2019s there to be afraid of if it\u2019s a fair duel? Huh! Yes! I\u2019ve heard that Prince Davey, who used to be talented, can\u2019t even hold a sword now.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dI stopped the enraged Barris as soon as he raised his fist.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cDavey!\u201dWhen I smiled and stroked his head, he clenched his teeth as he put his head down. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long since you got up from your sickbed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201dI spoke calmly and looked at Prince Baltian.\u201cYou have to be responsible for your words.\u201d\u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen, but if I lose, I\u2019ll kneel down in front of everyone and apologize to you!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dHis insidious smile deepened when he heard my answer. He was so confident that he would never lose.It was a natural reaction.They were all excitable boys and girls in their mid-teens.I was sure that it was hard to get to the expert level in the early and mid-teens without exceptional talent, yet each of the people gathered here was talented enough to be selected as the nation\u2019s leading prospects.As I followed him to the center of the banquet hall and turned my eyes, I saw Barris and Winley looking at me with worried faces.They looked like they wanted to stop me, but they didn\u2019t know why I was being so stubborn. I saw other facial expressions in the hall, all filled with either curiosity or concern that it might lead to a serious problem.However, there was also a person who looked cold and was immersed in something different.\u201cGet your sword! Today, I will teach you the depth of the sword.\u201dPrince Baltian shouted confidently at me with a wooden sword. And so, I picked up the wooden sword on the floor and smiled a little.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I last had to do things like this.\u201d* * *The biggest interest in the banquet hall, which was hosted to promote friendship and harmony, seemed to move quickly to our duel.As there were many young prospects representing nations, there must\u2019ve been quite a few fights for pride between them. Furthermore, noblemen who were supposed to mitigate conflicts in each country were just watching the situation for some reason.Perhaps they wanted to avoid a situation where they might get into trouble as well.Without imposing any significant sanctions, the Duchy of Felicity was also watching the duel in the distance. Those who came to enjoy the banquet were silent, looking at the open space for the duel.\u201cA master is supposed to yield his turn!\u201dHolding the Bastard Sword, known for its strong durability, he stood arrogantly and pointed at me with the tip of his blade.\u201cThat rude bastard!\u201dBarris exclaimed angrily at his arrogant attitude. Just like him, many people looked strangely intrusive, but they stayed quiet.Being full of energy and being rude was far different.Furthermore, those who were watching the situation already knew who was conceited and disrespectful.Among them, Princess Ileana, the precious daughter of the emperor of the Palan, was making the most disgusted expression.Looking at Baltian with an irritated face, she soon turned to me and shook her head as if she couldn\u2019t understand it.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with your consideration.\u201dAfter murmuring a joke, I looked at the thin wooden sword and turned to him.Imprudent.Although I wasn\u2019t yet fully recovered, I still had been building up my strength.It wasn\u2019t wise for him, a mere beginner of swordsmanship, to challenge me to a duel, who had crushed assassins ranging from mediocre to professional levels.I wanted to destroy him thoroughly so that he could never grab a sword again, but I was supposed to be a weak prince who got up from a sickbed less than a year ago.I had an idea.Yes. There was only one.\u201cAre you scared? Ha, I suppose so. Fear is natural.\u201dBaltian was speaking as if he had already won. He then sneered closely. \u201cBut the battle has already begun! What are you doing? Come on!\u201dSeeing him shouting as if he was treating his subordinates, I knew how bad the relationship was between the Voltiz and the Rown Kingdom.\u201cWell, I won\u2019t turn down your offer.\u201dI had complicated thoughts, but I brushed them off.There was a way to beat an opponent while hiding my skills completely. In addition, I could effectively destroy my opponent\u2019s mentality through it.\u201cDavey.\u201dWinley\u2019s voice, who was looking at me anxiously, was faint.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started.\u201dMumbling a little, I lifted the heavy wooden sword towards him.Then slowly, I took one step at a time.And, by the time when he was within a certain distance\u2026.Ssssss!My sword pierced through him with a heavy sound.A light Stroke of Bell.However, he avoided my sword by taking a step back as if he had already expected how I would attack.\u201cHuh?\u201dTung!!My wooden sword was flung to the floor, making me lose my balance against gravity.\u201cThat was stupid.\u201dPpaaaah!But I wasn\u2019t done just yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the contrary, I had already lost my balance, but I managed to use the sword as a support to avoid falling.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dSilence quickly lurked around because of the hit.\u201cUgh?!\u201dI pointed the disproportionately shaken wooden sword at Baltian, who stood up with a perplexed look on his face, unable to understand the situation.The foundation for the sword technique I used was to show one\u2019s weak point, and it was about tricking the opponent thoroughly.\u201cPfft.\u201dUnlike him, who was angry, laughter poured out from the audience. He didn\u2019t expect the blow.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!!\u201dPerhaps it was because he got smashed by someone to whom he yielded the lead to.The guy staring at me with an eerie expression came in quickly, his sword pointed at me.An old eagle was definitely better than a young crow.His swordsmanship was definitely sharper than the kids his age, as he participated on behalf of the Voltiz Kingdom. His postures were well established, and his sword\u2019s movements were quite accurate.However, because of his lack of experience, his actions were too predictable.That applied not only to Baltian but also to most people.Whoooong!With the sword down, I took a step toward him and raised my weapon.From the axis of the legs to the shoulders and the waist, it seemed almost impossible to restrain him because it was a sloppy posture that was swung without being properly supported.In an instant, my sword was deflected away from my body by the blade he swung up, and I heard the sound of gasps from all sides.There was also a worrying cry from Winley, who was surprised.Even those who were proud of knowing the situation seemed to think that I just accidentally struck Valtian\u2019s sword and that such a coincidence would never happen again.Well.Paang!Seemingly unable to let it slide, he lifted his wooden sword towards me. In retaliation, I straightened my legs and distracted my balance.\u201cEek.\u201dAt the same time, my body followed his weapon\u2019s flow of momentum, spinning, collapsing, and avoiding his attack.Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Simultaneously, my sword swung away directionlessly as it dodged his.I hit his forehead that time.* * *\u201cKkkh!\u201dThe same situation happened again. People were surprised by the jaw-dropping moment.Baltian was one of the brightest to participate in the upcoming competition, even though he had a bad temper.On the contrary, I was known as a weak prince who just recovered from a six-year-long coma. I couldn\u2019t have relearned the way of the sword properly.In fact, the careless attitude I showed would\u2019ve instilled more confidence in his mind.However, the results were different from their expectations.Unlike their prediction that I would be defeated, losing the duel in a second, I knocked down Baltian with my sloppy swordsmanship twice.If it were a real fight, not a duel, he would\u2019ve been killed twice already.\u201cThat stupid trick!\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m winning. Your skill must be worse than I thought.\u201dBaltian, who jumped up at my words, had his face red full of shame.Pffftt!As someone burst into laughter as if they couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore, he got madder, almost as if that added more fuel to the fire.\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u201cTo a beginner who doesn\u2019t know how to swing a sword.\u201d\u201cWho said Prince Baltian is one of the most skillful competitors?\u201d\u201cArgh!!!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t argue with them, so he glared at me with his teeth clenched instead.Just like how he had already suffered twice, his defeat was a fixed fact, but he refused to admit it. Now was the time to give him a little stimulation.Unlike the beginning, his senses became cautious. Reflexively, he was afraid of being hit by nonsense coincidences.I could bet he thought that if he became extra careful, he could never lose. With that logic, he observed me from a distance.If he didn\u2019t come, I would have to go. Hence, I came after him in a sloppy manner.Then, I swung my sword wildly.I was displaying a messy technique that was no different than a child swinging a branch recklessly. It had no distance, no distribution of power, and no formalization of direction.Smack!I couldn\u2019t balance my bodyweight properly. Hence, I couldn\u2019t put a lot of strength on my sword.Smack! Smack!As I watched the guy calmly stopping the attacks I delivered, the people inside the banquet hall seemed to think his weapon would soon hit me.However\u2026Paaah!!The blindly-swung sword struck him on the temple, and everyone opened their mouths in astonishment.* * *\u201cOh, my God!\u201dI gave off a flurry of seemingly random swordsmanship.My attacks were so slow and weak that any person who had learned how to fight properly could easily avoid them. Everyone could see that.If so, then why did he get hit again?Baltian looked confused and was soon staggering after sustaining three blows to the head.\u201cHmm, did you get hit?\u201dI jokingly asked such a ridiculous question. Laughter came from the audience again.\u201cWhat happened? I thought he was an expert?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s here. How come he got beaten by swordsmanship like that?\u201d\u201cMaybe he really is nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cSince he did it three times, not once or twice, then I\u2019m sure\u2026\u201dNobody thought that I wasn\u2019t making it happen on purpose anymore.\u201cOh, no! No! That is not it!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lame excuse.\u201d\u201cTut-tut-tut-tut.\u201dBy that time, Baltian\u2019s expression looked really mad enough to jump. It was as if he was being treated unfairly.He stopped, recollecting his thoughts. He couldn\u2019t block the first hit, and the same could be said for the second attack.Despite my seemingly poor skills, he had gotten hit. Baltian knew there was something more to what other people could see.Of course, making excuses for him wouldn\u2019t change anything. I grinned at him, who was currently huffing.This was why I had learned this sword technique.It was called,The [Drunken Swordsmanship.]It was literally swinging a sword like a drunk man.It was a swordsmanship style invented by the heavy drinker Dok Go-jun at the Hall of Heroes and was completed by Haris, the Sword God.\u2018Damn it, even though I made it, this is such an evil technique!\u2019This technique made the bad-tempered Dokgo-jun click his tongue.-Don\u2019t use it unless you really want to bury someone socially. If you have a conscience for the same person, that is.Haris, who was organizing the structure of the completed sword style, also frowned and said, \u201cDon\u2019t use this technique unless absolutely necessary.\u201dWas it because they were heavy? Sharp?It wasn\u2019t. It was because of the deceptiveness and playfulness that embodied the entire swordsmanship style.It was so full of malice that even the two swordsmen belonging to an entirely different league felt that it shouldn\u2019t be used.Its objective wasn\u2019t something grand like achieving something, protecting someone, or killing a target.No, its objective was to shame a bastard in front of everyone.What could describe it better than evil swordsmanship?I was staggering as if I was drunk, avoiding or offsetting the opponent\u2019s attacks and delivering a sudden and unexpected attack.To be honest, it was quite an efficient sword technique since it frustrated the hell out of the opponent. If it was used in a situation where people were watching, its effect became even greater.Just like now.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure whether I was lucky or my opponent is weaker than I thought.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dSince it was almost a style made for entertainment purposes, I actually gave it the ridiculous name of Entertainment Swordsmanship rather than Drunken Swordsmanship.Even if it was called the entertainment meta itself, it was no exception.Of course, it would be meaningless if it was just fun and weak.Even if it was made for entertainment in the first place, would the swordsmanship created by those swordsmen be weak?An unexpected result unfolded.Baltian, embarrassed by the situation, eventually began to summon Mana, emitting sword energy.\u201cPrince Baltian! I can\u2019t believe you are using your sword energy at someone who\u2019s not a knight in a duel! Are you out of your mind?\u201dPrincess Ileana shouted faster than Barris, who looked just as enraged as her.However, Baltian ignored her and came at me with spiteful eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201dI took a step back at the very moment he attacked with the sword energy, acting as if I was scared.\u201cIt\u2019s too late to dodge!\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201dThe moment Barris, who shouted in despair, ran out to protect me\u2026.\u201cIf the coincidence persists, I will be suspicious.\u201dThere was a person who seemed to be unable to understand the situation ever since it started.Eventually, I stopped fooling around, took a step back, and collapsed as if my legs lost strength.Paang!At the same time, the weapon containing the sword energy sliced through the air where my head was supposed to be, scattering in the air aimlessly.What a moron.\u201cHuh?!\u201dRight before it hit me, I fell backward and avoided the offensive, and as I did so, I saw his eyes widen.I murmured, speaking in a hushed voice, having no intention to be heard, making his eyes fill with even more anger.He soon realized something went wrong and tried to run away.It was a little too late to go back. There was nothing I could do now except continue executing my Entertainment Swordsmanship technique.\u201cUgh!\u201dMy staggering feet tripped his legs, which made him lose his balance and fall toward me.Thump! Thump!We got entangled as we rolled over the floor. Those who watched our miserable and unsightly battle were silent as if they were at a loss for words.Whoooong!And, by the time the cloud of the moment was over\u2026Miraculously, I preempted the position of pressing him down from above and reflexively hacked my sword down, hitting the floor inches away from his head.It looked as if my sword, which I used for nothing but supporting my body, had delivered a clean hit.\u201c\u2026\u201dBaltian was on the floor. I sat on him and purposely missed his head.As the winner of the match was determined by a coincidence, astonishment and cold silence surrounded the banquet hall.I felt everyone\u2019s eyes on me, surprised by the ridiculous situation.As I looked up, Baltian, who had rolled on the ground with me, looked up at me with a disbelieving expression.There were a lot of surprises.Lightly, casually and slowly, I lifted the sword that struck the space right next to his ear and smiled. Immediately afterward, I heard the sound of him breathing in deeply.\u201cI think I won.\u201d\u2018Pretend you don\u2019t know anything,\u2019The silence lasted way longer than I thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was simply a sloppy fight between children who had just learned how to use a sword. The problem was that Prince Baltian, who came here to represent the Voltiz Kingdom, showed that childlike fight. Everyone already heard that I was a weak prince who just woke up from a coma; that topic lasted a long time in the flow of conversation. At this point, everyone would know my situation, even the royalty from other countries who had no interest in me.Baltian was well-known for his talent in swords. However, he fell to the floor under my sloppy attacks. No one in the banquet hall seemed to want to break the silence in this ridiculous situation. The advantage of the drunken, or entertainment, sword was that my level couldn\u2019t be grasped in the eyes of others. It was a randomly wielded sword, one that could be avoided easily.However, it was said that giving a lesson was different from doing it yourself. It seemed like they could easily avoid it, but they still couldn\u2019t. It was one of the strongest aspects of the entertainment sword. Originally, it was a sword technique that could distract the opponent\u2019s attention, but it wasn\u2019t just left to spontaneous luck.\u201cOh, my arms and legs are sore.\u201dWhen I stumbled weakly, dropping my sword, Winley rushed over to help me.\u201cDavey! Are you alright?!\u201d She shouted in dismay, looking up at me as she checked if I was hurt.\u201cBrother!\u201d At the same time, Barris, who had been sporting a blank expression this entire time, followed a moment after her.\u201cWhy were you so reckless?\u201d\u201cI was lucky. Haha.\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201dHe let out a short sigh when I smiled awkwardly at him.\u201cThe game is over,\u201d Ileana said quietly, breaking the silence.\u201cPrincess Ileana! This was a mistake.\u201dIn response, Baltian hurried to get up and tried to find an excuse, but the cold beauty only gave him a colder look.\u201cDoes one of the knight\u2019s vows intend to reverse the outcome?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a fair game!\u201d\u201cYes, it was a very dirty game, far from justification that the Prince Baltian promised. Do you think you have the right to complain about it after you lost?\u201dIt was a straightforward way of speaking that one could rarely see among the ladies in the social life. She stared at Baltian, standing by with a dumb expression, and soon turned to me. Then, she looked momentarily puzzled before she turned away.\u201cHuh, I\u2019d better go.\u201dAt that, she walked away as if she lost her interest. Oh, she was indeed an ice queen. I appreciated her beauty and her favor, but that stern look wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. Except a few who were leaving behind her, the remaining soon turned to Prince Baltian.\u201cYou have to keep your promise no matter what.\u201dHis face flushed red with shame and anger as I spoke.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is too late to say no.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe frowned at my words.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you would go against what you said as the representative of the Kingdom of Voltiz?\u201dHis body flinched at the calm words. The young aristocrats who followed Baltian from the Voltiz Kingdom looked growingly concerned since they could not stop the situation.\u201cI deserve an apology from you.\u201dHe clenched his teeth as I said this. He looked like he was holding back his anger to kill me right away.\u201cKeep your promise! Prince Baltian.\u201dBarris shot back with a stern look on his face, which made Baltian clench his teeth and put his head down after he looked around. Then, he slowly knelt.\u201cI was disrespectful to Princess Winley and Prince David\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dLosing face, he ground his teeth so hard that it wouldn\u2019t be strange for him to kill a single person right away. But what could he do? A deal was a deal. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to apologize to me, who had humiliated him in front of so many people.There was an unbearable humiliation at the sight of his mumbling. Winley, who would normally have accepted the apology, grabbed my hand in anger. \u201cHuh, let\u2019s go back, Davey.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, brother.\u201dIt seemed difficult to stay in the banquet hall any longer because of the discord. I had no patience when it came to my precious sister, especially if anyone treated her disrespectfully. Turning around with a soft smile inside, I left the banquet hall, ignoring him with a clenched fist. I didn\u2019t know what kind of spite he might have against me, but it was beyond my interest.A monster.\u201cBrother! You were reckless!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Did you know you could\u2019ve been in big trouble?\u201dWatching the two twins made me smile as they voiced their complaints as soon as we got to the carriage.\u201cIt is all good now.\u201dHe was a guy with that kind of personality, but he was still famous in the Voltiz kingdom for his talent.\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen him before during a joint event.\u201dFeeling offended, Winley swept her arm.\u201cSince then, he has constantly been pushing for marriage. He isn\u2019t just stupid, but bad-sighted as well.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201dI didn\u2019t know that he had harassed her before. If I knew, I would have broken his arm. It wasn\u2019t easy for a sword trainer to feel Mana without talent. But it was also not easy to train and enter the expert rank. It was like saying that most knights couldn\u2019t reach the master rank, even if they tried during their entire lives.There were three Sword Masters in the kingdom of Al Rown, but even if the entire continent were combined, the number of Sword Masters would amount to less than 50. Despite this, the continent had a bigger population than expected.\u201cDavid, did you get hurt anywhere? Are you alright? With a tearful face, Winley held her tightly and asked.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t get hurt for sure.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t hurt me; he was dancing to my tune the entire time. However, I would have seemed to be in danger to the audience. It was the entertainment sword that I chose to humiliate the opponent without revealing my presence. The results were a little childish but quite satisfactory. It was possible that the conflict with him could worsen the cold war between the Voltiz and the Al Rown Kingdom.\u201cMy stomach dropped! If you got hurt, how was I supposed to see you again?\u201dAs Barris spoke wildly, I flicked his forehead without hesitation. I then smiled at him when he began shrieking in pain. I was thankful that they cared about me; that was probably why I cared more about these two.\u201cBrother, where the hell does your power come from?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a trick. And I\u2019m not that patient, so I just did it without thinking.\u201d\u201cHum\u2026that isn\u2019t true.\u201dBarris\u2019s gaze was the look of someone who knew me to some extent. That was how he looked.\u201cAs long as it worked. It\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201cWhoa\u2026well, since you\u2019re not hurt, I won\u2019t say anything anymore. But please don\u2019t do this again. I\u2019ll do it for you. Brother.\u201cGod helped you. You stumbled because you couldn\u2019t bear the weight of the sword, which let down his guard.\u201d Winley murmured in curiosity.\u201cSure. He probably didn\u2019t see what was coming.\u201d\u201cHa! To tell you the truth, I was grateful. You were amazing!\u201dBarris didn\u2019t add anything to Winley\u2019s remark, but his mouth was twitching, so perhaps he felt the same.* * *\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\u201dA furious boy threw everything in his room, breaking everything into pieces.\u201cPrince Majesty, please calm down!\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201dThe boy shouted coldly as if he were going to cut down the man right away.\u201cHow dare he! I am the next Emperor of Voltiz Kingdom.\u201d\u201cPrince Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201cPrince!\u201dThe boy\u2019s shout made the aristocrat who had been blocking him tremble.\u201cGet out of here before I kill you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo one could stop him anymore. The aristocrats went outside with their heads down without another word, leaving the boy to his rage.\u201cI\u2019ll kill him. I\u2019ll kill him!!\u201dHis anger was aimed towards Davey, who mortified him in a great deal.\u201cSigh\u2026sigh\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to kill him?\u201dIt was then\u2026He stopped, unquenchable anger burning in his eyes. The boy, frowning reflexively, turned his head, and a red-eyed woman was sitting by the window. She looked like she was in her early 20s. The woman\u2019s red hair and red eyes were the only things shining in the darkroom in the night.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cDo you want to kill him?\u201dIt was an alluring voice, perhaps meant to prey on those who gave into its charm.\u201cI asked who you are!\u201dBaltian, shouting furiously, pulled out the long-sword that was beside him. However, she didn\u2019t seem to care. The woman simply lifted herself and walked towards him from the window.\u201cI can help you.\u201dLike a mother who comforted a child, or a sister who took care of her little brother\u2026like a woman whispering love\u2026Baltian didn\u2019t say anything as he saw her coming toward him.\u201cI can help you, baby.\u201dHis trembling hands slowly began to stop with the seductive voice. At the same time, his eyes began to turn blank.\u201cKill\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, your anger called me out. I\u2019ll help you rip his flesh and take his bones.\u201d\u201cYour\u2026name is??\u201d\u201cSharis. Please remember my name.\u201dBaltian, who was looking at her with blank eyes, nodded unconsciously. Looking at him, the woman, her eyes shining red, gradually showed a cold smile. Then she moved closer, hugging Baltian and murmuring as she buried her face in his neck.\u201cGood boy. Leave it all to me. You just have to do what your heart tells you.\u201dSimultaneously, her mouth slowly opened, and her canines sank relentlessly into his neck within the darkroom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, there weren\u2019t any, so Amy stayed quiet with a puzzled expression fixed on the three of us, settling into the strange atmosphere. In this way, she felt like a nanny, not a maid. It was weird to say this about a girl younger than me, but the way Amy took care of me was over the top. Meanwhile, Barris continued with his sword training.Silent Night.Despite what happened in the banquet hall, the Duchy of Felicity maintained a festive atmosphere. The story didn\u2019t spread wide. Even if it did, people would have considered it as a common fight between some aristocrats.\u201cWill it be okay?\u201dI read a book silently when Barris, who stopped swinging his sword, turned to me carefully.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cPrince Baltian is the most promising candidate for the Crown Prince of the Voltiz Kingdom. Wouldn\u2019t it be possible for him to hold resentment over this incident?\u201d\u201cLet him do whatever he wants.\u201dWhen I calmly moved my gaze back in the book, Barris laughed bluntly. Then he put his sword down and plunged into the seat.\u201cHow is Winley?\u201d\u201cI think she was so stressed that she fell asleep a while ago.\u201d\u201cYou should sleep soon because your tournament starts tomorrow. Your match is in the first round in the draw.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201dHe closed his eyes quietly as if there was some kind of fire burning in his mind. \u201cAlthough it looked weird, you destroyed him once. But I\u2019m not satisfied yet.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201cI will smash Prince Baltian with my own hands.\u201dWith this, I saw his determination. Barris was an expert intermediate. Prince Baltian of the Voltiz Kingdom, whom I faced, was a beginner. Although Barris\u2019s skill was slightly above his level, you still couldn\u2019t guarantee anything if you were on the same level with them unless there was a distinctive difference.He probably knew this. A bitter smile came out. I would love to teach him the swordsmanship I learned, but a one-day lesson wouldn\u2019t make a big difference.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be great.\u201dHe was choosing mana with his eyes closed and smiled at my words.\u201cOf course. Whose brother am I?\u201d\u201cAre you trying to flatter me?.\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dHis smile disappeared quickly in his face. He seemed serious in his way.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dOut of my curiosity, I immediately focused my eyes on the mana as I sat on a branch and watched Barris sitting on the floor of the garden, whirring about. His rotating mana soon came into view and spread out evenly and wide.Clean.That was the first thought I felt when I saw his mana.Honest and gentle.It wasn\u2019t a bad move. However, I felt like there was a part that was a little blocked.\u2018Should I help him just a little bit?\u2019If this method were known, wouldn\u2019t it cause an uproar? It was a completely different method, destroying the concept of the most common training method. There was a reason why so many large groups of martial arts people worked hard to implement casting off one\u2019s old self. I often didn\u2019t use this trick, but I didn\u2019t want to be stingy with my brother\u2019s matters.Besides, a vindictive Baltian could do something stupid to Barris.\u201cBarris.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cLet me give you a massage.\u201dAs I calmly stepped down from the branch and walked close to him sitting, he closed his eyes and waited for my hand. It would hurt a little.\u201cOuch?! Brother?!\u201d\u201cWell, you must have been a little tense in your muscles.\u201d\u201cWell, wait for a second!\u201d\u201cIt seems to be too stiff.\u201dAs if massaging his shoulders, he clenched his teeth and gasped under my touch. Although he probably wanted to writhe, he couldn\u2019t even properly resist the pain because he lost all his strength.\u201cWhat the\u2026heck!\u201d\u201cWhoa, it is pretty bad.\u201d\u2018He is just massaging me, but why is my whole body sore?\u2019He was probably thinking this.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not just a massage, boy.\u2019I spread the mana by stimulating his shoulders with my hand, which would shake it up to become active without his awareness. With this simple explanation, it was obvious how much difference it would make. I had heard a Thai massage was one of the best.\u201cYola Pongtai!\u201d\u201cHey! Oh! What are you talking about\u2026ahhh?!\u201dThe massage took me a while to make his body flexible, in which mana was hardened in his shaking, writhing body. I smiled as I was satisfied with the mana\u2019s flow in his body, which changed slightly.\u2018Ah, I forgot the insurance.\u2019Disregarding Barris catching his breath, I collected mana in my right palm. Then, mana began to shine in the form of a small, elaborate magic square with my will, and I hit his back as soon as I finished it.\u201cOuch!!\u201d\u201cBoy, you need to get some rest. Just go and sleep.\u201dHis scream resonated out when I hit him on his back once more. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t forget to check if the small golden magic square engraved on his back was fixed. He was also giving me a strangely dissatisfied look. He probably had no clue how some of his body structure changed as I twisted with the massage that I gave him a little while ago.* * *The day was bright, and the Continental Swordsmanship competition officially began. Although the tradition itself was quite old, it was also an important game in its way, which had maintained peace between nations without any accidents. The discord that occurred here would soon spread to disputes between countries.Although the war wasn\u2019t eradicated on the continent, it would be true that such a harmonious competition was suppressing the war as much as possible. I remained in the dorm on the pretext of being unwell, sitting on the bed, condensing mana with my fingertips, and repeating to release it.\u201cI feel there is enough manas for Aura Blade, but why am I still not able to recast?\u201dWhile supporting everyone else, I couldn\u2019t check my body properly. To be clear, I knew that my body was moving a lot differently from its normal orbit, but it was too far off from what I expected.Bone metamorphosis. The heroes of the corridor all spoke together and expressed it that way. It was self-evolution that changed itself when the body was to hit the limit of growth. Humans had the only advantage, who didn\u2019t have spirit affinities like elves and long lifespan, toughness and delicacy like dwarves, and powerful magic power like demons. If you embraced everything, it would make the bone metamorphosis happen.Ordinary bone metamorphosis happened with humans that had too much mana or other strength that couldn\u2019t be held in their body. So, when the expert reached the level of Sword Master, the mana that had grown to the limit would gather rapidly based on certain enlightenment and evolve by itself. Stronger muscle strength, a strong body, and a younger appearance were one thing, and one\u2019s longevity would also be extended. It was like a tremendous reward for your efforts.If so, how should I explain my case? Most of them were still asleep, but I had returned with an unbelievable amount of mana in my body. It was like the mana that needed to be accumulated slowly was filled in at once.\u2018It wasn\u2019t normal to go there while I was in a coma in the first place.\u2019There was no effect without a cause. There must be a reason why I fell into the Corridor, but that wasn\u2019t what I cared about now. All I wanted now was my well-being and longevity. My life was too short in my past or present life, so I had a little obsession with life. The goal of my life was to eat well and live well for a long time.I wasn\u2019t going just to watch and let people ruin my plan. In terms of safety, a prince\u2019s status was safe enough to be incomparable with ordinary commoners, but in a different sense, it was more dangerous. As there was no power, I had to protect myself. However, I felt lost since the bone metamorphosis hadn\u2019t yet occurred.\u201cIt changed well in the corridor.\u201dI worried while suppressing the complaints that popped in my head.\u2018Shall I just force to change it?\u2019If the knights, who look forward to pioneering the land, heard me, they would have a stroke. There were many possible solutions, but the effect wasn\u2019t worth trying. Eventually, after contemplating, the conclusion I made was to hold. The metamorphosis of the bone structure happened naturally when a direct load or trigger was given to the body.No matter how many experiences you had, the realm of the human body and mana was unknown. What if I tried and failed? It would be like forcing something that had less than one percent chance of success and pushing it into the reinforcing machine. It wasn\u2019t worth considering my priceless body as a piece of data.\u201cMajesty, it\u2019s time for Prince Barris\u2019s match to begin soon.\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re late, you might miss the game\u2026\u201dWhen I focused on training mana in silence for a long time, Amy suddenly peaked out her head and reported with an anxious look. She looked worried at the possibility that I might do something absurd again. What did I do? Although I often did weird things in front of her, was it quite disrespectful?\u201cAmy.\u201d\u201cYes, Yes?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cHah. Yep!\u201dAs she looked at me with an anxious expression, she bowed her head in surprise. There was a lot to find out, but for now, we had to stick to reality. Didn\u2019t I learn enough in the corridor that I shouldn\u2019t be impatient? I slowly changed into comfortable activity attire and left.* * *The arena of the Duchy of Felicity was a truly beautiful stadium. The maximum age limit for the participants of the competition was 20 years old. It was a competition among young boys, but it wasn\u2019t such a low-level game considering their talent. All of these were talented sons representing their respective countries.It wasn\u2019t easy to enter into the expert level even if the average knights were recognized for their skills and status as knights. When it came to royal knights, most of them were experts, but ordinary knights could deal with mana only a little bit. In that sense, Barris\u2019s talent was quite outstanding. I headed to the special audience seats of the nobles above the normal audience seats that filled the stadium.It looked like they could have accommodated more people without these special seats, but I wouldn\u2019t protest against this. Soon, the crowd began to cheer. I saw a boy above the stadium posturing for victory.\u201cOh, Davey!\u201dWinley, looking out of the glass and chewing cookies combatively, was delighted to find me. \u201cHey, how is your body?\u201cNot bad.\u201dEven if I died, I wouldn\u2019t tell her that I couldn\u2019t go because I had to go to the bathroom.Stupid bowel movement!If I couldn\u2019t solve it with the bone metamorphosis, I might have to use divine power.\u201cWhere is Barris?\u201d\u201cHe will start his match soon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I thought of how funny it was to have this match right away, but it was better than not being able to have it at all. Barris was standing on the martial arts field with a determined face, showing no fear whatsoever. I felt the excitement in the entire stadium was heated up from the previous game.Since most participants had outstanding skills, it must have been markedly different from the usual scuffles. Barris had a claymore, similar to his body size, but the sword\u2019s blade was quite blunt for a non-lethal battle. Wizards and priests with outstanding skills were on standby, but if you were hit with a sharp-edged weapon, you would still likely die before any treatment could occur.\u201cI am so worried if he gets injured while running like an angry foal.\u201d\u201cBarris has a lot of experience. He will be fine.\u201d\u201cI know, but\u2026\u201dWinley was a rear assistant, but Barris used to take the lead when clearing up the many mountain thieves in the country, perhaps because of his personality. Because of that, I felt sorry for the knights who were busy trying to protect him.Before long, Baltian slowly appeared with a long sword from the other side. I expected that he wouldn\u2019t look good because of the embarrassment he had at the banquet yesterday, but his face was scarily expressionless.\u201cEven though the blade of the sword is dull, killing is forbidden. Do not attack each other with direct qi.\u201dA wizard in a robe quietly spoke and then installed a barrier in front of the battlefield. It was to prevent the fight from flying to the audience seats. He had a gaze filled with hostility, but Barris stared at Baltian without saying anything. On the contrary, Baltian simply pulled out his sword silently.\u201cStart!\u201dBefore long, the two men collided as soon as the start signal went off. Barris, who learned deadly swordsmanship using power, and Baltian, who uses a variable sword technique to fool his opponent with a long sword. Barris was dominant when it came to proficiency and stability in swordsmanship. Besides, the atmosphere was turning toward him because of the misbehavior that Baltian showed before.Those who saw him at the banquet didn\u2019t seem to have any expectations from Baltian. However\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201dUnlike everyone\u2019s expectations, Baltian fought head-to-head against Barris\u2019s sword. Did his skill improve? Not really. It was like a strange flash of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Clang! Clang!They both had expert-level skills, reinforcing their bodies with mana. Even though the swords didn\u2019t have sharp blades, I could see sparks when they collided.Clang!! Clang!!The wild audience had now gone silent, surprised by the close encounter between the two. Without even screaming, they squeezed their hands tightly and swallowed their breath. Abandoning deadly swordsmanship of unknown origin to me, was far beyond the physical abilities that he showed yesterday. It was impossible that him improved his skill in that short time. As if he had changed completely, his swordsmanship was alien to me.If I hadn\u2019t awakened Barris\u2019s mana yesterday, it would have been a big mess.Clang!!The two men, who were pushing each other in a strength competition, spread apart simultaneously.\u201cWow\u2026it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen Barris move that fast\u2026\u201dWinley was right. Barris, who was catching his breath, seemed surprised that his physical ability increased sharply from yesterday and once again surprised that sword technique, struck him with the same sword technique as himself.\u201cHis skill has significantly improved.\u201dBarris, who used to say that he would become a knight, wielding a wooden sword at random, had indeed grown a lot. Baltian was acting weird, but I felt proud of Barris at the same time.\u201cI never thought he\u2019d be so good at using the power sword like this.\u201dCatching his breath, Barris quietly asked Baltian. However, Baltian remained quiet, just raising his longsword and pushing toward him. Once again, I felt a sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201cDavey, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWhile speaking calmly, I immediately focused the command mana on my eyes. The Silent magic trick was activated, and I started to see things slowly in the dark. This was Black magic that could read the opponent\u2019s mind. At the same time\u2026I frowned at Baltian when I saw the air current flowing through his body.\u201cWhat the heck?\u201dI jumped up, realizing something wasn\u2019t right. Then, the battle between the two was over at the same time. As if making a final decision, Baltian pushed himself toward Barris\u2019s sword. Reflexively turning the sword\u2019s trajectory and trying to attack again, Baltian didn\u2019t miss the short gap and swung his sword. And, momentarily, a red air current in his sword appeared, and he thrust his sword into the heart of Barris without hesitation.Bhaha!!!!Simultaneously, a blue veil around his body prevented Baltian\u2019s attack and disappeared as if crushed.Let me borrow a sword.The Continental Swordsmanship Competition was a competition in which outstanding people competed. Functionally, it was a sports game with the principle of not killing your opponents. However, he relentlessly violated two of the biggest rules: not to use murderous techniques and not to apply qi to his weapon. The inside of the stadium, full of surprise, began to sway.Blue air veil.Anyone who knew swordsmanship wouldn\u2019t miss it. This was of expert-intermediate level or higher. Because of this, it was a self-barrier that more advanced professionals used. When he inflicted a dangerous attack, the mana would then wake up to protect the owner. It was of an advanced expert level or higher\u2026Most swordsmen were often frustrated because they couldn\u2019t break through this situation, but Barris pioneered the technique at the age of fourteen. All I did was to slightly stimulate his mana, which had been hardened to his body, but even with that, his condition had already taken a big step forward. Of course, Baltian\u2019s sword qi wasn\u2019t ordinary; it was an ominous dark red qi.Since he entered the upper ranks, Barris couldn\u2019t mitigate all the shock.(Cough)As a small amount of blood flowed out of Barris\u2019s mouth, Barris slowly raised himself with a pale face.\u201cDuel is stopped! Prince Baltian! You have violated two rules, so I declare your disqualification!\u201dWith the wizard\u2019s furious shout, the knights quickly climbed up the battlefield, surrounded, and suppressed him. However, Baltian only turned his head to a bizarre angle with an expressionless face despite this situation. Then, he puffed his lips as he opened his mouth for the first time.\u201cKkkkrr!\u201dHowever, the voice that flowed out of his mouth was so strange that he didn\u2019t sound like a human at all.\u201cPrince Baltian de Voltiz! At a convention held for the Confederation of Nations\u2019 unity, this rude behavior can only be regarded as the intention of the Voltiz nation.\u201d Officials of the host country, the Duchy of Felicity, shouted angrily.If Barris were killed here, it wouldn\u2019t be a normal problem. That wasn\u2019t only true for Barris, but for everyone who participated. Those who came here were representatives of each country. Among them were the royal family and the sons of famous military nobility. Any country that valued them would certainly not be happy and make a claim.If so, of course, unity, which was the national coalition\u2019s purpose, would be over. They all knew that once two small nations declared war, all the neighboring countries would jump in since they\u2019ve waited for this very reason to do so. However, even at the words of the official of the Principality of Felicity, he just tilted his head and didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cFrom our perspective, the prince\u2019s action was malicious and deliberate actions to revenge! If you do not give any clarification, I will formally report a claim against the Voltiz Kingdom as the current host of the Continental Swordsmanship Contest organized by the Confederation of Nations!\u201dAs if throwing an injunction, the official shouted.\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cPlease wait! The prince\u2019s action wasn\u2019t intended to cause discord!\u201dA formal claim would never be what the Voltiz Kingdom would hope for. The Voltiz Kingdom\u2019s nobles who jumped up over the battlefield were sweating to ease the situation.\u201cPrince! Please, say something..!\u201dIt was then.Baltian, who was still silent, turned his head to a bizarre angle and grabbed the head of a nobleman who approached him.(Gnarl)(Crackling)In an instant, the head of the nobleman burst like a watermelon hit by a baseball bat. At the same time, the blood disappeared from the faces of everyone watching the situation at the stadium.* * *With his mouth wide open, Baltian began to shed a bizarre sound and a red air veil, not only from his sword, but also from his empty hand formed. As if a sticky liquid was flowing over, the appearance of the red air veil that enclosed his entire body gave the viewers goosebumps.\u201cAhhhhhh!!!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhh!!\u201dThen, after a brief silence, screams began to erupt from all over the stadium.Again, the game was supposed to be a friendly match with a strong sports concept. If an athlete grabbed a person\u2019s head and burst it during the Earth\u2019s Olympic Games, it would surely cause chaos like this. Baltian\u2019s eyes, which looked as if they were smiling, were moving quickly, and the white part of his eyes began to turn red.Simultaneously, unidentified veins sprouted all over the skin, and the fangs visible in his open mouth began to lengthen, much like a vampire from a ghost story.\u2018Infection.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a normal vampire that could create an infectious agent that could shed Dark qi. Instinctively realizing it, I narrowed my eyes. I noticed that he wasn\u2019t the same as I knew just by looking at the flow of mana from a little while ago. The flow of mana that creatures should have wasn\u2019t there, and only a bizarre flow remained.As I approached, Barris, ignoring Baltian, who was standing overwhelmed by the knights, looked up at me with a half-pale expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Good job.\u201d\u201cCough! Did you see that? I made that air veil, brother.\u201dHe smiled, and I knew he was trying to make me not worry. He was, after all, only a 14-year-old boy. He had matured rather quickly compared to others. Meanwhile, I felt like I was stuck to the ground. If I hadn\u2019t set up a protection yesterday, Barris would have lost his life in this match. No one else, but my brother, who was the only one on my side in the stark palace, almost died.\u201cGo in and take some rest.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cBaltian.\u201dI sent Barris away on a stretcher and headed to the field. My dream was to eat well and live peacefully, just like everyone else. It was a simple dream for me, who hadn\u2019t lived in such a way in the previous and present life combined. Life in the corridor wasn\u2019t a living form. That was why I couldn\u2019t stand out that much.No matter how brilliant a human could be, they could never survive by turning everyone into an enemy. Did they say that a cornered stone meets the mason\u2019s chisel? When judged objectively, I had a range of diversity that ordinary people could never understand. That meant that I could be considered a dangerous molecule. Especially now, when enemies in the Al Rown palace surrounded me.As I approached Baltian in anger, the knights hurriedly blocked me. Baltian, bizarrely changed, didn\u2019t look like a human being but a monster now. Of course, the knights, pulling out their swords, didn\u2019t let me get close to him.\u201cIf you get any closer than this, it is too dangerous. Please step back!\u201dHe said firmly, but I, ignoring the knights, turned around and stared at him. I wondered what the use of these words would be to a man who lost consciousness. It was annoying.What should I do? Should I pull out all of his limbs even if it would end in a war with Voltiz? Or should I take another way? As I mulled this over, Baltian started to move.\u201cUggghh! Ugggghhhh!!\u201dHe began to shed bloody tears from his red eyes, looking at me, and then he ran towards me.\u201cStop him!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let Prince Baltian close to Prince Davey!\u201dEven so, he continued to rush powerfully.\u201cHuh?!\u201dHis power was too strong to be stopped by the skilled knights.Slice!He cut the knights in front of him with a red sword to reach me.\u201cDavey!!!\u201dWinley, who had followed me, screamed. Everyone thought that it was too late to stop him.\u201cMove.\u201dA blonde-haired girl stormed over the field, grabbed my shoulder, and pulled me backward, swinging a sword at Baltian.[Heavy sword. Splitting the Mountain.]The girl, who looked only about 150cm-tall and holding a huge sword as tall as her, struck at him, completely changing from someone with a cold face to an insane monster.Kuwoong!!!Tremendous vibrations resonated out, and the stone floor, protected by magic, shook and cracked lightly. It was just one strike. However, with it, he was thrown to the ground on one knee by the girl\u2019s overwhelmingly heavy attack.\u201cRaauugh! Raaaaaugh!!\u201dHer attack made him shriek. Ileana de Palan, called the Princess of Swords, appeared with a blue air veil all over her body, staring coldly at Baltian with tightly constricted pupils.\u201cVampire\u2026\u201dAs if there she held a grudge against vampires, she kicked him in the head. She was so fast and intense that even the knights who kept their distance to counterattack Baltian couldn\u2019t stop her. Rather, she was way more powerful than most of the knights here, so it would be more practical to help her defeat him rather than stop her.\u201cRaauughhh!!\u201dHe screamed and fought back, but Princess Ileana pushed him away like a beast.\u201cThe prince is more powerful! Help her defeat him!\u201dBaltian was no longer a prince, but a monster was running wild. The knights followed her and raised their swords. The wizards who were supervising the battlefield applied attack magic quickly, and the priests who were waiting for the wounded squeezed out their divine power and increased the momentum to press him down.He wouldn\u2019t run wild anymore. Everyone thought so.\u201cRaaugghh!\u201dHe pulled out a bizarre gem from his heart when she pushed him to the far end of the field.\u2018Blood Polis?\u2019It was a sanctuary for vampires. No matter what it was or what it did, my body reacted instantly. Even though Barris went out of the stadium on a stretcher, Winley was still here. As I pulled Winley reflexively toward me and focused my energy, the frightening red gem pulled out of his heart emitted a big light. It turned into a living fog and soon swallowed up its surroundings.* * *It didn\u2019t take much time for the wave of bloody fog to cover the entire arena. As if volcanic ash was flying from a volcanic eruption, wait a minute! At that moment, it was filled with red fog on all sides, promptly covering everything.Only two were shining in that space where you couldn\u2019t normally even see one inch ahead. Ileana was sitting down while scattering light from her body, and I, holding Winley in my arm, made an air veil to block the fog. In other words, only the three of us were awake. If there were swordmasters, they might have been fine as well, but the Duchy of Felicity didn\u2019t have any swordmasters.If so, what about the sword-masters in other countries?According to the agreement of the Union of Nations, the swordmasters were considered as human weapons and weren\u2019t allowed to leave their country unless it was quite a matter of affairs. The swordmasters here were treated like knights who had mediocre proficiency that was below Princess Ileana\u2019s level. In the first place, it was unlikely that swordmasters came here since there weren\u2019t many on the continent.\u201cCough, Davey?\u201dWinley, who was painfully breathing, looked exhausted like a person who hadn\u2019t slept for several days.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Winley. Everything is okay.\u201d\u201cDavey\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t even think of herself and eventually closed her eyes.\u201cGet some sleep, and everything will be fine after you wake up from a good dream.\u201d I spoke calmly, carefully laying her in a corner.Then, I frowned as I stretched out my hands.\u2018Hurry up and move. If you\u2019re lazy, you\u2019ll be mixed up with the command mana.\u2019Whooooshh!As if shrieking, a pale white light moved through my fingertips. There were three energies in me: Mana, command mana, and divine power. Each had its characteristics. Only those who had reached a certain level to communicate with mana were able to sense the change. Not only did it increase efficiency, but it also eliminated recoil and raised more power than I currently had.This was the state of enlightenment at the very highest master level. My body currently maintained a slightly abnormal balance, though. It had been a little weird since the beginning. The word \u201cpsycho\u201d would suit the command mana.\u2018Use me right now! If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll scream!!\u2019The command mana had this kind of mindset. It had the fastest resilience and was also the most efficient for this reason. The other mana, in a sense, was like a sassy girl. She was difficult, but when I expressed my will, she reluctantly but elegantly moved. And, the divine power showed the worst dullness. It had a lazy nature that didn\u2019t listen to whatever I would say.Even now, if I didn\u2019t force it to move, it wouldn\u2019t have moved. It was similar to giving a dog a treat for tricks; it only moved when there was special motivation. This was level 4 divine magic, the Shining bright protection. The impact of the Blood Polis wouldn\u2019t reach her for a while. However, I wasn\u2019t satisfied with it yet and kept using different divine magic.\u201cWhew\u2026\u201dA sigh of relief flowed out only after a great deal of divine power escaped, and intense light covered Winley. She wasn\u2019t in pain anymore and looked healthier. Too many people in the stadium were suffering from the Blood Polis, but I didn\u2019t have time to take care of them. It was a crazy idea to apply protective magic one by one with my divine power in the first place.My divine magic was, after all, only at level 4. Level 1 was the best, so Level 4 was not the lowest. It was quite similar to the fourth circle magic. As I looked at the two people silently, I got up slowly. Then, I looked at the blonde-hair girl grasping for her sword on one side. Her blond hair, which was bright as honey, was scattered weakly, and her face, which was beautiful enough to take away one\u2019s eyes, looked pale.Nevertheless, the original beauty remained the same. After all, appearance mattered when it came to someone\u2019s first impression. Unfortunately, we all tended to judge a person by appearance.\u201cSigh\u2026sigh\u2026\u201dI could barely endure the airflow from my body. I didn\u2019t expect her to have a stronger power beyond this. Of course, I didn\u2019t need her help. When I approached her silently and put my hand on her back, she cringed away. She was barely holding on with a half-broken giant sword, and as the mana gradually flowed in through my hand, she stopped gasping and began to breathe slowly and evenly.\u201cOnce you feel better, step back.\u201d\u201cHold on! You?!\u201dShe realized my existence, looking up at me in amazement. There was a puzzled expression on her face.\u201cYou\u2026how come you are unaffected?!\u201dThe bloody fog covering their surroundings weakened and collapsed everyone who inhaled. That included the knights with excellent skills who could manage a certain amount of mana. However, I was fine. She wasn\u2019t stupid enough not to know my situation.The fact that I was the prince of misfortune, who fell into a coma in an accident and was unable to wake up for six years\u2026she had probably heard about me after she came here. Still, she seemed to believe that I was a weak prince with no power after watching the whole thing at the banquet yesterday.\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cCough! I don\u2019t know what happened, but you should step back. It\u2019s not something that you can solve.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can solve the situation.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t resolve the situation with luck like the duel at the banquet!\u201d She shouted urgently.\u201cThey are the nobles of the night, the demons that remained in old books. You\u2019ve probably heard of vampires.\u201dIt was more than that I heard of them. I had hundreds of thousands of fights against vampires. As I was silently listening to her, I found that she couldn\u2019t control her body. Because of this, she forced herself to lift her sword in an attempt to block me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019ll be torn right away since you hardly feel the mana. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re normal, but go run away.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like he is going to stop.\u201d\u201cI will stop him!\u201dShe was someone who didn\u2019t easily show her emotions. The position of the princess would have changed her in that way. However, now, she was showing excessive obsession. It seemed that vampires were her deadly enemy. I pulled her shoulder as she was trying hard to activate mana with a bitter smile inside. It was a little revenge for interfering in the situation.\u201cWhat?!\u201dI gently poked the back of her neck with my index and middle finger.\u201cOuch!!\u201dThe moment she looked back at me with a shocked expression, I poked her collarbone accurately and quickly one more time.\u201cHuh?!\u201dHer body thusly collapsed like a broken doll.\u201cWhat\u2026what is this?!\u201dShe looked puzzled, trying to understand the situation that happened to her body. I felt so guilty looking at her eyes, asking for an explanation in which I didn\u2019t turn away without a word.\u201cI am not sure why you have such a grudge against vampires, but it\u2019s my job, so don\u2019t get in the way of my work.\u201dHer eyes were wide open in astonishment with my dire warning.\u201cWhat, what are you\u2026?\u201dI left her behind.I closed my fists, and stretched out with my left hand measuring the distance. Then, I took a short breath as I pulled my left foot back.\u201cUgghh! Ughghhhh!!\u201dBaltian, who was passionately breathing the bloody mist, ran into me with the speed of a bullet. The bloody mist was the best circumstance to him. He proved to be faster and more powerful after inhaling a lot of mist. Dark qi was working within him, and he was immune to magic. He was a type of undead monster who had considerable resistance except for one thing.\u201cUghhh!\u201dHe was more furious and violent toward me than when attacking the others. Even if he lost his consciousness, he still had the instinct of deep hatred against me. As he struck down his big fist with great force, I hit his wrist to the side with my left hand to measure the distance. It was such tremendous power. Yet, I had the muscle strength that I had trained since I learned swordsmanship for the first time. I knew exactly what his weakness was. I could easily get rid of his force just by twisting his balance off a little.Should I destroy him in the same way?[Cheonmagong Thousand Bloody Horse Detonation]As the black destructive magical spirit began to overflow, I penetrated his heart without hesitation with my fingers and thrust my palm as I rotated.Pop!!!A black silhouette, extending from my hand to his heart, swallowed him with a huge vibration and disappeared, leaving a huge mark on the wall behind him.* * *The blonde girl was watching the whole thing in astonishment. It all felt like a giant demon destroying a small being. The strange and terrifying feeling made her tremble.\u201c..What is that?\u201dShe, barely holding herself against the huge vibration, had gone silent as she watched Baltian, a monster boasting a huge body, collapse in vain. It was obvious that Baltian was far stronger than before. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t attack carefully. I just punched a hole in his body just by pushing his palm with a little force.It was unbelievable to see him exploding instantly, who had reached the highest level of expert swords. She didn\u2019t even feel a single drop of mana in his body. Was it possible to do that as a human? Was it realistically possible for a human without a handful of mana to blow up a monster with a black and white current? She couldn\u2019t believe what she had seen.\u201cPhew.\u201dI walked towards her, brushing my hands off in relief and ignoring Baltian\u2019s black blood. It might have been my violence a while ago, or it may be because of the unexpected power I showed, but she looked a little scared of me. As I walked silently and towards her, she was stepping backward without realizing it.Tttt!\u201cAh!\u201dHer feet were twisted because of her sudden movement, and she screamed cutely as she fell to the ground. She looked up at me with a frightened expression, losing her usual imperturbable attitude. Meanwhile, I stayed quiet, thinking about something and smiling at her as she stared at my black hair. Her cold attitude from a while ago had now disappeared.\u201cOh, I\u2019m feeling a little better now.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cLet me borrow your sword.\u201dShe tilted her head at my sudden words. The only sword she had was that huge, half-broken sword. Although people said, she was the master of the divine sword Calderas\u2026She didn\u2019t quite master the sword.\u201cThis is already broken\u2026\u201d\u201cNot that one.\u201dI pointed to her chest with a smile. It was a little brooch on her outfit.\u201cThis.\u201dRip!!Her eyes opened wider as I tore off the brooch without her permission. She couldn\u2019t just seem to understand the situation.\u201cA boss needs a special tool, so let\u2019s borrow your strength. Divine swordmaster.\u201d9 Hierarchical castle magic, change.Thousand Nightmaster Surt had been promoted as a hero thanks to his life of making numerous weapons, including swords that would save the world. He had given this name to one of the masterpieces of his life: Calderas. It meant white guardian in an ancient spirit world.He could create a master\u2019s sword from the same material as others; even old swords turned into master swords with his hand. This was a magical blacksmith with the blessing of the spirit. He was well known throughout the continent for his ability to smelt a sword by controlling mana.There were two masterpieces in his life, and the other ten swords remained somewhere in the continent as national treasures. All of them were great magic swords, but Calderas was exceptionally superior among them. He made Calderas for his best friend, Haris, by sacrificing his life to give it ego.What was the ego? It was self-esteem. A sword usually emitted power on its own with an ego. Honestly, if I just listened, I had no choice but to feel great, but I knew the truth, and I knew what kind of guy he was.What kind of guy was he?-Hey! Who do you think you are holding me? Put me down!!Wouldn\u2019t you be able to tell just by listening to this crackling and whining from the sword?\u2018Noisy.\u2019Of course, I had heard of his notorious temper from his master.-What, what?!\u2018Please cooperate with me. If you come out uncooperatively, your master will also die.\u2019The sword vibrated lightly as if he was startled at my words.\u201cA sword with a vibration function. As I heard, he\u2019s a real pervert.\u201dIf Surt heard what I said, as the sword maker, he would try to beat me to death right away, whether I was once his student or not. Of course, he was in the corridor so that he wouldn\u2019t hear me. What did it matter if anyone swore when the king didn\u2019t listen?-Hey!! How dare are you treating me like this?!The voice of the screaming sword was inaudible to anyone else.\u201cThis\u2026hey\u2026\u201dShe was no longer keeping her mind clear without the power of the divine sword. It seemed like she was at her limit. It would be difficult to even stay awake. Her talent was excellent, but she faced a difficult opponent.Whoo\u2026As I concentrated on the energy and lowered the hand holding the brooch, an intense white light burst. The sword was made by compressing an Orichalcum ingot that had been cast for a thousand years. That was why it was a divine sword. As I calmly focused my energy in, a huge storm surrounded my body, and soon the light of the sword turned into a huge giant sword.The length was approximately 120 cm, and the width of the sword was over 10 cm. Considering the current owner, the sword was as tall as Princess Ileana, who was only around 150cm tall, and it ended up being pure white. It had a surprisingly smooth surface and a dangerously sharp blade. I could feel the warm divine power radiating so intensely that my head was ringing. Was it obvious because the only magic blacksmith on this continent forged this sword? I lifted the sword silently and swept the surface with my fingertips.\u201cIt\u2019s superior.\u201dDid people say opportunity made a thief? When one saw good things, isn\u2019t it natural to want them? However, I got rid of the thought immediately. It wasn\u2019t mine in the first place, and it was a sword that didn\u2019t match my personality that much.-I haven\u2019t been awoken by the contractor yet, but uh\u2026how did you raise my power?!I swung the sword cutting through the air, ignoring the screaming Calderas, and\u2026Boom!!A great wave of power wrapped around me and slowly scattered. Baltian, the monster wandering around in the red mist, just burst out in a bloody blast under my Thousand Bloody Horse Detonation.It wasn\u2019t that there wasn\u2019t an enemy. Baltian, a monster who lost his mind, must have not led the situation. It was the high-ranking vampire who infected him that led to this situation. I silently pulled my hand, holding the grip, pointing the tip of the sword in the air. Then I put the tip of the sword down and sliced it upwards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the quality will pick up after 10 chapters of Community Unlock, since we will be bootstraping an extra editor.]Episode 24\u2018Please cooperate. Just let me borrow your strength. I\u2019ll do the rest.\u2019-You\u2026what the hell\u2026[Divine Sword Unity][Super Heavy Sword Thunder]Crack!!Enlightenment was such a convenient system. Muscle strength would build up in the body but becoming a pioneer of something and growing enlightened was engraved in my soul. This was a new change to me, who had already been through enlightenment once. It was only that the frozen Mana had now returned to its original state. Although the recovery had been slowed down considerably, it wasn\u2019t a lack of enlightenment but rather the sudden release of a large amount of Mana, which caused a gap.The heavy sword, Haris\u2018 swordsmanship, which could be regarded as the foundation of the technique I used, cleaved the air with enormous power. Even though Mana\u2019s power wasn\u2019t strong enough, the divine sword supplemented the insufficient power of Mana with enormous divine power. As the pure white flash passed through the air, the red smoke disappeared for an instant, leaving a terrible sword\u2019s image instead.\u201cHow long are you going to hide? Come out.\u201dThere was no answer to my words. However, I felt that something was coming closer.\u201cI knew it was a vampire, but I never thought it was a high-ranking vampire.\u201dThe black bats united together and broke apart but then slowly began to unite again in the torn air. They then formed the silhouette of a person as they united into a single mass.\u201cDo you remember me? Miss maid.\u201dThe silhouette turned into a woman who opened her eyes with terrifyingly cold red pupils as she recovered her form.* * *One thing was certain, looking back at my memory, according to what I\u2019ve heard about the vampire tribe, they were so prideful that their nose was tilted as high as the sky. They referred to themselves as nobles and acted like they had class inside them. Of course, they certainly had such great power. They were the only creatures who could use blood magic. Vampires instinctively had strong control over blood, similar to the dragon\u2019s unique ability.Blood polis was a power that granted vampires sanctuary.\u201cI thought there was someone secretly helping you when my men were attacked, but I guess it was just you.\u201dIt was a high-handed tone. She looked down at me silently, looking unsurprised.\u201cAs you know, I\u2019m kind of awesome,\u201d I responded to her in an attempt to hurt her pride.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come down a little bit? My throat hurts because I keep looking up.\u201d\u201cHuh, how dare you\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you wear such a dress and float there, I can see your underwear. It\u2019s black like your personality.\u201d I said calmly, removing the smile on my face.\u201cSo, come down right now.\u201dCrack!!Then there came a streak of lightning, splitting the space where she was. Of course, the amount of mana I recovered was too small to reach the ability to tear the entire space apart, so what I tore down was a part of this red mist. However, it didn\u2019t matter. The giant sword Calderas was a sword with an ego that possessed great divine power.Sadly, to those infected by vampires or vampires themselves, they were vulnerable against divine power. As my repeated blows hit much harder than before, she frowned and slowly came down to the other side of the field.\u201cWith such a catastrophe like this, Queen Liness would never have to cover up her actions even if I, Barris, and Whitney were killed. The relationship with the Voltiz Kingdom may get worse, but there is no way that the Voltiz Kingdom would wage war against the kingdom of Al Rown, given how targeted they are by the other nations.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI smiled at her, who was staring at me as if her pride had been wounded.\u201cCan I assume that you showed up in front of me because you are confident enough to kill me, right? You rolled your head quite well, but what should I do? It\u2019s closing time, fool.\u201d\u201cYou snobby\u2026\u201dAs she spoke coldly and opened her arms, drops of blood gathered in her hand. A red whip then materialized, and she relentlessly swung it at me.Whip! Whip!!The whip struck the ground, and my body, completely smashing the hardened floor, was treated with magic.\u2018Ouch. You\u2019re pissed off.\u2019It wasn\u2019t the end yet. The part of my body where the whip touched turned red, and sharp thorns rushed in towards me.Shiiiiing!!Of course, I wasn\u2019t going to keep getting hit, so when I lightly swung the sword, the thorns were scattered away.\u201cIt\u2019s different from what I expected, but you\u2019re just a poor human being.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you working for a human now?\u201d\u201cHold your stupid tongue!!\u201dThe whip, which had been swung strongly, tore through the air again. She seemed quite angry, but that was to be expected. The most efficient way of attacking vampires was with a quick wit.-Vampire Lord? He was strong; he was stupidly strong. First of all, he\u2019s the strongest among the species. They are crazy from birth, and one of them becomes a lord after holding a succession ceremony. They don\u2019t die easily without a high elf, the natural enemy of vampires.-Then how did I get him? I made him mad enough to go crazy with my three-inch tongue and beat him up. Making any creature sufficiently mad simplifies their action. Vampires are particularly prideful, so if you tenaciously point out their birth or appearance to higher-ranking aristocrats, there are many greenhorns who burst out in anger.This was what the noble had said, who was lying on a wooden podium because he was lazy. Come to think of it; it seemed that the Palan Empire was quite the believer in swordsmanship. I wondered what would happen if everyone found out who he was.Whip!! Whip!!The whip continued to lash out, causing a sonic boom as it persistently aimed at me. If someone got hit once precisely, it would be difficult to withstand even if you had a trained body. At that, a whip wasn\u2019t a weapon that could easily be blocked. At this, a whip with bloody thorns came in again, as if cutting off my retreat.There was a limit to avoiding it. However, if I retreated further, it could affect the humans who were lying on the floor.\u201cThe only result left to you is death!\u201d She shouted coldly, avoiding the sword I was wielding.\u201cEven if it has the power of a divine sword, that woman, who was said to have inherited the swordsmanship of the god of swords, eventually collapsed.\u201dAt that arrogant tone, I swung my sword again, but the red blood drops covering her body blocked me.\u201cIt\u2019s a blood clot\u2026\u201d-A Vampire Count or higher! Although they are relatively young, they are purebloods who can challenge the lord if only the lineage is concerned.As I saw the blood veil, I quietly nodded my head at Calderas\u2019s words.\u2018I have to deal with it now.\u2019-Is it possible?\u2018Why, you think it\u2019s impossible?\u2019Despite the enormous force of the whip that was pushing me away, as if I were finished, I gently lifted my sword and twisted my body lightly. The red whip struck near me, missing by the width of a piece of paper. It wasn\u2019t easy to learned how to, you would be able to counterattack as you wish.Shari\u2019s expression momentarily stiffened. And, without missing the short chance, I attacked the red thorns coming towards me, almost crumbling them.There was only a very short chance. However, there was enough time for an attack. The predictable trajectory of the sword wasn\u2019t efficient at all, but I applied stronger force to it. I aimed for both her and the huge jewels floating in the air that emitted this damn red smoke.\u201cYou said she inherited swordsmanship from the god of swords? Do not be mistaken for only seeing a little girl who just scratched the surface.\u201d-This\u2026this swordsmanship?!The light cut that I swung tens or hundreds of thousands of times in the name of training. It was a little faded to match me, but it was the same technique of splitting the mountain that Princess Ileana used on Baltian.[Super heavy sword splitting mountain]However, the power was remarkably different from what she showed.\u201cWhat?!\u201dHer eyes became wide-open, and she reflexively created a blood clot\u2026However, it was far too late to block my attack.Crack! Crack!\u201cWhat?!\u201dA flash of lightning, the condensation of the enormous power, created a huge pure white light, tearing the space through her body.* * *The aftermath of the huge blow was truly enormous. It was because the battlefield, which had maintained a certain shape even with her attack, collapsed as if it was smashed under the vibrations, even though it had been treated with magic. I was surprised to see that the floor was turned to powder by a single weapon because I thought it would be fine even if it were bombarded.Hercules, a hero who called himself the King of Survival, said so.-What? Isn\u2019t it better to use whatever\u2019s at hand? Danger comes unintentionally at any time! Do you think you will have good artifacts or objects all the time?Haris, a lazy swordsman, and Dok Go-jun, a drunkard, had said so.-This kid is still immature.-Think simple! Listen, kid, which one would be strong? A strong guy with a strong sword\u2026Oh! I\u2019m drunk. What did I say\u2026oh yeah. Or a guy who doesn\u2019t know anything about swords holding a greatsword? Ugh\u2026oh, how far did I say it?Wizard Odin said so.-If so, what is the use of learning magic? Just grab a great magic staff and wield it. By the way, this kid is trying to change the subject as he made fun of me being a midget?!When did I do that? Lastly, the divine Hippocras pinched my cheek and smiled.-Isn\u2019t he asking the question because he got yelled at by the others? I can\u2019t give you great advice because I\u2019m not an expert in combat skills. However, don\u2019t forget to return what you borrowed eventually. The difference between what you\u2019ve built up and borrowing something that was already built up is big.Even though the Corridor was where various humans gathered, everyone said the same thing in the end.Don\u2019t be dependent on items.However\u2026once you experienced the synergy that the item brought, you couldn\u2019t just say that easily.\u201cHey\u2026it\u2019s amazing; that\u2019s why people seek rare items.\u201d-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Back in my days! Uh?!\u201cHey, you snot.\u201dThe divine sword, Calderas, sounded refreshed. It was a guy who had been kept loftily without an owner for thousands of years. It found the owner, but because the master\u2019s skills were still imperfect, its body couldn\u2019t be manifested and was maintained in the form of a brooch, so it seemed quite frustrated.-By the way. What the hell are you? How did you get my power out? And how do you know about me? Your swordsmanship too! It was his technique, Mountain Split, that you showed me just now.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d-Plus, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve known me from before\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s just follow our contract. Do we need to dig up unnecessary facts from each other?\u201d-What is it\u2026?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, even if I told him that I was a student of his original master, there was no way he would choose to believe it. Rather, it would be fortunate if he didn\u2019t freak out, saying that I had just insulted the deceased. The existence of the Corridor was kind of a secret in some sense. It was also a story that was hard to believe.I stared at the huge red jewel that slightly cracked and split in half. The power of the blow properly borrowed from the divine sword was amazing. It wasn\u2019t completely smashed, but that was still enough for me. Shari was a vampire with great power, but she didn\u2019t threaten me. She never thought she would be defeated. Whether she was dead, alive, or had fled, it wasn\u2019t a good time for me to chase her.It wouldn\u2019t be easy to find her with the current power I held. Besides, there was a more important thing now than Sharis, who seemed to have run away. The source of this red mist was the vitality of all living things, except the vampires inside there. Once a fire was lit, it was left burning with only oxygen and combustion. If I waited any longer, an irreversible catastrophe would occur.-Blood Polis\u2026Ah, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen this air\u2026 It makes me nauseous.I heard the murmur of the divine sword in annoyance.-You know that? This red mist won\u2019t get any bigger thanks to destroying the nucleus, but it won\u2019t stop until everyone here dies if you leave it this way.\u201cOkay.\u201d-Because of its somewhat weakened strength, you can use purifying magic that is at least level 6 or higher for several months, but it still won\u2019t save the humans who have already lost their vitality. Most of the people will die in there.\u201cYou are right. Even worse, if people were exposed to this damn mist for a long time, they would be infected.\u201d-The humans outside must be wondering if it is safe to enter the mysterious mist. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably already turned upside down around here.He was quite quick-witted since his ego had lived for a long time.-Because human beings are scared easily.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for any living creature. Because the desire to survive advances the species.\u201d-In that sense, you were really lucky. You look young, but you are very strong at the master level, right? You seem to have a high tolerance against Blood Polis.I laughed at him. Was it just master? I had already reached the level of Sword Master or higher.\u201cMaster\u2026you\u2019re not wrong, but I still need more time to pull out the Aura Blade.\u201dI wasn\u2019t strong because I used pure mana like everyone else. I had reached the Master or a higher level because of the doping created by my enlightenment and mana proficiency. Thanks to this, the phantom metamorphosis seemed completely impossible.-What? What does that mean\u2026wait, who are you?I heard the murmur of the divine sword Calderas, astonished. He seemed to notice it now.-You\u2026you\u2019re a freak! Who are you?!His trembling voice soon turned to a scream.-What is this ridiculous mana! Besides, command mana and divine power?!The Calderas had the power to look inside of the person who held the sword with his ego. It could control its strength by interlocking with the owner\u2019s power. The sword protected the owner, and this wasn\u2019t just for physical reasons. The excessive dependence on items would eventually ruin the owner.Why did you think there was a limit in games with item levels? Anyway, I guess I was just talking nonsense. Ignoring his astonishment, I frowned at the mana and command mana which weren\u2019t moving even though they were awake. It seemed that I had to give them a little stimulation, but there weren\u2019t many chances.-Three forces coexist; I haven\u2019t even heard of this case\u2026are you human? You\u2019re not some sort of bizarre creature who just came out to get a taste of this world?\u201cUnfortunately.\u201dTalking calmly, I walked forward slowly with the sword in my hand. All the heroes of the Corridor told me that I had insanely outstanding talent. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t deny the fact that I was extremely talented. Otherwise, I would not have been able to achieve so many things.-It can\u2019t be\u2026the mana and the divine energy are conflicting with each other! Maybe one but not two. If you have such a tremendous amount, your body will explode and completely blow up the surrounding area\u2026\u201cHere is a human who breaks common sense.\u201d-Is it possible?! You, you\u2019re crazy!!\u201cYou said crazy, don\u2019t be disrespectful to the new method that has been researched for hundreds of years.\u201dTalking calmly, I pushed him back to the ground. Calderas were, of course, a giant sword with a straight shape. Because of that, when it was held upside down, it turned into a shape of a cross that had enormous divine power.\u201cLet me borrow you until I finish. I can\u2019t handle this with my current power.\u201d-What do you mean?\u201cLet\u2019s clear up this situation.\u201dI had no reason to sacrifice myself to save them, but I would be willing to use my power if it helped my recovery.\u2018It would be like greasing the cogs to smooth the recovery process. I don\u2019t do free labor.\u2019The more you use the basis of energy, the more you likely improve them, whether that was mana, divine power, or command mana. So, some wizards used mana up and built it up again while they were recovering. The speed would be extremely slow whether you meditated, used this method, or used the usual method. On the contrary, just stimulating them to move would already increase the total amount since I already had a lot of energy. And the greater the amount of stimulation, the faster the recovery rate would be.Without further explanation, I knelt in front of him. Then, I closed my eyes like a praying priest.\u201cOh, this is not my cup of tea.\u201dI clicked my tongue.\u201cThe Lord Priyasi, who looks down on us. Your lamb here is wandering on a dark road. He can\u2019t see an inch ahead. Could you please hand him a flashlight? I\u2019d like to take care of it myself, but you know that I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d-What, what kind of prayer is that!?Calderas were further frightened by my prayer. It didn\u2019t sound like a prayer with faith in God. Rather, it was a profane prayer that might be subject to some divine punishment. The source of my divine power was a little different, thanks to St. Daphne\u2019s training. The source of my strength was knowledge and faith, not the faith that sustained God.God did not love me, but rather I was a subject of curiosity.\u201cThe lamb of the Lord God is groaning in pain and tempted by the Devil. Your disrespectful lamb believes only in the rare items. Please save\u2026oh, I don\u2019t know! I know you are watching everything. I am just going to use it; allow me to do so!\u201dThe priests had no idea. The fact that God didn\u2019t love a devout believer who chatted a lot, but those who practiced it. The truth was that I was nowhere near what I was trying to do with my divine power. However, it was possible if I gathered all of the divine power from Calderas.Again, this was the first sword called the divine sword. If he realized my intentions, he would surely be frightened. It was possible to clean up the fog with the purifying magic, but you couldn\u2019t fix the ones that had already been drained of their vitality. If you tried to suppress it with a strong force, you would have to press it with a stronger force than it possessed.The highest-ranking miracle created by Daphne, the highest-ranking holy magic that I learned and used with the permission of God, had the greatest power ever.-Hmm! Something like God\u2026who would listen to such a nonsense prayer\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t know much about God either.\u201dHe noticed something wrong with my smile. Just like the vampire maid, he was also quite slow to notice things.\u2018God likes crazy guys. Especially extremely crazy guys.\u2019[9th Tier of the Last Holy Magic.][Saint Sanctuary]-9th, 9th tier?! What, what are you doing! Are you trying to kill me?!\u201cDon\u2019t overreact. You are not going to die. You are not going to die. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d-Hey\u2026hey, you crazy ahhhhhh!!Calderas, who had noticed what I was going to do, screamed out, but it was too late.Whooo!!!A burning sensation fell behind my back as if the prayer had been delivered even with that bizarre plea. It almost felt like getting burned by an iron. It was an unusual wound, or trace, that could never be created in this world. Was God a pervert who enjoyed hurting his believer\u2019s body? I felt like vomiting, but I scattered all of the divine powers that ran wild without releasing my hands.Whooo!!Crack!An enormous light spread out as if covering the field, and white feathers began to flutter. It was like an angel was descending from heaven. The warm white light, invisible to the eye, began to swallow away the red mist, and the light began to permeate the bodies of the people whose vitality was being sucked away, comforting them.Crack! Crack! Crack!!!!And the red bloodstone, which sucked people\u2019s vitality and emitted red mist, finally disappeared as it was completely broken.Boom!A huge wave of divine power soundlessly rocked the arena. Beyond the slowly scattering light, only a piece of light that looked like a white feather remained.\u201cKah\u2026hak.\u201dWas it because I used most of my power? Calderas were silent, trembling, as he forgot to scream. Of course, the recoil of super high divine magic didn\u2019t go only to him. At the same time, a sense of incredible fatigue fell over me.\u2018Did you work a little too hard?\u2019When I called in power for a moment, it seemed that the divine power that had been solidified was torn apart, causing this sense of exhaustion.\u201cPhew\u2026sigh\u2026\u201dI took a short breath and shook away my blurred vision. Although there was a lot of energy, it would be okay as Calderas was a treasure trove of living divine power. A sigh came out of me for the remaining amount of the divine power had completely disappeared without leaving even dust.The red mist that maintained the Blood Polis had completely disappeared as I sat down breathlessly and turned my gaze away. It was then\u2026Beep.With that bizarre mechanical sound, I began to see strange things in my eyes, which were clouded by fatigue.-Name: Davey Al Rown.-Age: 1-Gender: male-Tribe: human-Title: The pupil of the insane heroes in the Corridor.-Symptom: Divine power exhaustion-Special comment :A half-crazy freak without any common sense(?).-Grant merit, you can briefly check the status of the target.\u201cHey, Lord Priyasi, I\u2019m not crazy,\u201d I muttered angrily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Simultaneously, I had a tremendous feeling of exhaustion throbbing through my whole body. There was no mercy on the rebound.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dAs I slowly blinked, the Blood Polis, the red mist created by the vampire, seemed to have disappeared. Great. It shouldn\u2019t leave a trace after a ninth rank spell. This was transcendental magic that brought God\u2019s will to the earth. At this, I burst into laughter.After I checked the people who were slowly opening their eyes and raising their heads, I turned my body and looked at Calderas, which was currently stuck upside down. I thought I had to go back, but all I could manage was to lean on the sword and collapse. Calderas went quiet after most of his divine power had been taken away. It may have been deeply shocked by the sudden sense of loss since it was a sword with an ego.There was a huge difference when you knew that you had been exploited or not. I felt sorry for no reason whatsoever. I knew I needed to be nice to Calderas the next time I saw him. I was slowly closing my eyes as I was thinking like that. I was also thinking of the unidentified bizarre status window that popped up in front of my eyes, but now I just wanted to forget everything and fall asleep.While checking the energy that began to recover at an unparalleled speed, I fell asleep comfortably, hardly noticing the blonde girl approaching me.* * *How long had it been since I had slept without any worries or stress? Even though the sleep was much shorter than when I was training, it would have been nice to describe it as a very satisfying sleep for me, who hadn\u2019t slept well for nearly half a year.\u201c\u2026For Bernie\u2026\u201d\u201cI am sorry\u2026\u201dWhile sleeping, I heard someone talking. When I opened my eyes half-awake, I could see the ceiling of the cleaning room. The small mansion that I stayed in the first time when we arrived at the Duchy of Felicity.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI breathed a sigh of relief, feeling refreshed.\u201cOh! Davey!\u201dAs Winley, who looked upset about something, found me awake, she ran to me quickly.\u201cDavey! Are you alright?\u201d\u201cWinley.\u201d\u201cHow is your body?! Is there any problem with it?\u201dShe looked extremely worried, as if she was going to burst into tears.\u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201dWhat happened to make you so upset? As I asked her, Winley burst into tears and hugged me.\u201cYou haven\u2019t woken up for two days. I was\u2026I was scared that you wouldn\u2019t be able to get up again\u2026ugh.\u201dAh. Since I had done that, it was a natural reaction that she was worried. As I patted Winley on her back, I heard a soft sobbing from her. I tried to comfort her without saying anything as her body trembled in my arms.\u201cI\u2026I had a dream.\u201d\u201cDream?\u201d\u201cYes, when the red mist crept on us, you protected me against it in my dream.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to remember much of what happened then. I thought it was better for her that she didn\u2019t see that cruel scene.\u201cWhere is Barris?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dShe frowned with a familiar, anxious look on her face.\u201cOh Davey, my brother, please tell me the truth. Did\u2026did you get rid of the red mist?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw something while checking your body. I saw a mark. Is it a stigmata? God\u2019s mark.\u201dShe slurred her words as she spoke, overwhelmed by emotion. The problem was the presence of the large stigmata on my back. In terms of size, it was about three spans. Considering that the size of common stigmata was wrist-sized, it could be considered unusually large. A sign engraved with the power of God. It was a peculiar wound that couldn\u2019t be created by any means that existed in this world. It was a trace of God, and it was also a testament to a noble being loved by God.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cAre\u2026you okay?\u201d\u201cIs it obvious?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know at first glance because it just looked like a plain wound on your back. But when I looked closer, I knew it was a stigmata.\u201dI had a feeling that nothing other than divine power had been detected.\u201cI heard from the priest who visited this place. It seems that all those red mists had been purified. I couldn\u2019t quite figure out who had done that, so I was wondering if you were involved.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cYes, but if you don\u2019t remember anything, maybe not.\u201dPrincess Ileana, who may be the only one who had seen everything, seemed to keep everything to herself. Honestly, I thought she\u2019d come and nag me right away, but I guess she just wasn\u2019t that kind of person.\u201cA senior priest who was healing your body found the stigmata. They are making a big deal out of this. They think that you, who fainted in the place where the divine energy was circling, received the stigmata\u2026.\u201dRumors were bound to spread; the situation certainly deserved it. Unlike most devout priests, having the stigmata meant God showed its love first.\u201cOh, my brother, are you feeling sick?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel anything bad.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dFeeling bad?\u2018Rather, the situation has gotten better.\u2019Evidence of a saint: that was the stigmata. Nine Hierarchy, the purpose of expressing the realm of the Holy Magic God, was to deal with the red mist. However, there was also my calculated strategy hidden in it. The precisely calculated strategy was essential to eat and live well. Using a large amount of mana at once to reveal the foundation would spur the growth rate. It was a small attempt, but the result was anything but.\u2018The mana capacity has increased dramatically.\u2019The mana responded to the divine power, and my command mana had already risen in large amounts. Compared to the amount I had previously, it was quite noticeable. There was enough to make the Aura blade now. I hadn\u2019t gone through a round of metamorphosis, but I had already come to the level where I could pull out the master\u2019s exclusive Aura blade. In the past, I was barely maintaining my power due to my enlightenment and experience.However, now I have recovered enough to pull out the Aura blade. Laughter came out. Among them, the biggest change in growth was the divine power with its lazy nature. People were obsessed with the stigmata for a reason. I felt that the amount of holy power living inside me had increased enormously because I could get the large stigmata that I couldn\u2019t get by existing in the form of a spirit when I was in the Corridor. Eventually, the divine power, which was the slowest in growth, had risen to the highest of the three energies.\u2018It is a power that grows when there is a reason. What a difficult divine power.\u2019As I leaned against the bed, I roughly patted Winley\u2019s head.\u201cGo in and take some rest. I want to think about something for a moment. You must be tired after taking care of me\u2026you should get some rest.\u201d\u201cIt was chaos after you passed out.\u201dShe looked angry with her puffed cheeks.\u201cBesides, Princess Ileana suddenly insisted on taking you to her place.\u201d\u201cDid she?\u201d\u201cYes, she said she had excellent medical staff. She came back a while ago saying that you wouldn\u2019t wake up here. I had to send her away again. Huh!\u201dThe reason she showed such behavior was obvious. Unless she was a fool, she must have seen everything and remembered them. The things that happened then\u2026What was weird was that Winley acted a little sensitive to her. I was curious, but it wasn\u2019t like I needed to ask her.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me anymore. I\u2019m awake now.\u201d\u201cThe games stopped on that day. Because of the incident, the entire country is chaotic right now.\u201dIt was an understandable reaction since it wasn\u2019t just an ordinary monster.\u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go back to my room. Then, take some rest, brother.\u201dWinley left the room with short steps after she smiled and hugged me tightly. I quietly stretched my arm toward her as she opened the door and left.\u2018Well\u2026is it right? Information confirmation.\u2019Beep!As if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, a translucent black box revealed itself to me again.-Name: Winley Al Rown.-Age: 14-Gender: female-Tribe: Human-Title: Nothing-Symptom: Fatigue.-Special comments: Three Circle Wizard.-Current psychology:Worrying about the viewer.Surprised.Fragile.\u201cOh, oh\u2026\u201dIt didn\u2019t show much. However, this status window contained information that couldn\u2019t generally be found.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to a game?\u201dHowever, the ability to gain insight into a person was of great merit when dealing with people.\u2018Why did this happen all of a sudden?\u2019Was it because I prayed to the Lord? Or was there a problem since I used the same method as when I was a spiritual body?\u2018Let\u2019s not worry; it\u2019s not bad anyway.\u2019I would use it if it helped my life in the future. At least there would be no misunderstandings. As I thought so, I looked out of the darkened window, and I could see the bright night view of the Duchy of Felicity. I wasn\u2019t able to easily decide whether or not I should hide my identity. There were too many factors to consider. If I were to make a big scene, the people around me might suffer.\u2018Is there any reason that I should hide my identity?\u2019Looking at the current situation, it seemed that people already knew about my stigmata. However, no one knew a single detail about it yet. This was an arena filled with sacred energy and the stigmata engraved on me when they found me there. The story of the stigmata was circulating, thanks to the sleazy senior priest who healed me. In other words, no one had seen me running wild. People might misunderstand that I did all that, given the situation. I mean, I knew it wasn\u2019t a misunderstanding. I was silent with such complicated thoughts.-It\u2019s just one side, but I guess they liked your ability to see through the other person\u2019s psychology. By the way, what are you thinking?It was then\u2026a strange voice came into the quiet room. He spoke like an elderly person, but the voice I heard was a boy my age. The voice sounded to be passed from a will in someone\u2019s head, not through sound.\u201cWho are you?\u201dI muttered and frowned at the voice that came from nowhere. How did he sneak up on me? I was nervous because I knew that it was impossible to do so. Therefore, it was probably not a normal creature. As I was sitting blankly, I narrowed my eyes and slowly started to boost my power.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time around, I felt which direction it was coming from. I reflexively turned to the place where the voice had been coming from. There, a palm-sized girl was looking up at me and sitting down on my leg.\u201cThis is my first time seeing you, I was a little bewildered when I accidentally released the seal, but I guess it was meant to be God\u2019s will.\u201dThere was an evident pair of pure white horns sprouting from the head. Its eyes were engraved with red patterns that had a strange glow; it could not possibly be compared to me or the vampire maid, Sharis. In short? An overwhelming beauty. As I looked at her, I opened my eyes wide to the memory of a time that suddenly came to mind.-You look perplexed with that strange window in front of your eyes. Am I wrong?* * *[Hmm? Why are you up? Who are you drawing? I didn\u2019t know you were good at painting.]-Hmm, what does it look like to you?[It has ergonomic handles on its head and fierce red eyes like a rebellious teenager. Isn\u2019t that a demon? If I look at that beautiful face, it almost looks like a high-ranking demon.]-You\u2019re the only one who says the horns of the head are handles. Yes, as you said, this one is a demon.[Why the heck did you draw a portrait of a demon? Besides, the detailed illustration looks like a beautiful girl.]-Is she pretty? Of course, she\u2019s overwhelmingly beautiful compared to those crazy girls partying over there. I\u2019ve drawn this hundreds of times. Her name is Perserk.Haris, the lazy swordsman, laughed bitterly, pointing to the appearance of a girl who seemed to be about eighteen years old.-She was my daughter, whom I adopted and taught swords back when she was still human.[Wait, Perserk?]-Yeah, as you know, this is the Demon King of the Abyss who I cut with Calderas and sealed in the sword to end the Great War.* * *\u201c\u2026\u201dI only thought it was amazing.One of the two regrets he had was right in front of me.\u201cDemon\u2026Perserk.\u201d-Whoa\u2026you know very well about me. After all, my eyes weren\u2019t wrong\u2026ugh?!I released command mana to tie her as she was talking casually. Knowing who she was, there would be no reason to be confused anymore. The command mana quickly became lighter, spreading like a rope to restrain her and lift her into the air.-Oh, you\u2026 you\u2019re a man with rough hands. I don\u2019t know about you, but I am not a fan of being bound.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re close enough to make that kind of joke.\u201d-Isn\u2019t this the first time you and I have faced each other? There is no reason to be on bad terms.At her words, I laughed bitterly without lowering my guard.\u201cI want you to explain this situation now.\u201dIn my eyes, she looked like she was in trouble.-Were you going to build a symbiotic relationship with me even if I say not to?My eyes twitched a little at her words.\u201cSymbiotic relationship?\u201d-The stigmata engraved on your back. It has become a vessel that holds my soul, so that is why the size is unusual.\u201cIt\u2019s funny to say that the stigmata were a vessel that seals the Demon King. To be honest, I don\u2019t understand that situation at all.\u201dAt my words, she was trapped by the command mana and shed a light groan, avoiding my gaze.-Would\u2026would you perhaps like to loosen this up? Again, I don\u2019t have a fetish of being constrained so much\u2026 besides, if it\u2019s such a terrible position\u2026She had a slightly reddened face, avoiding my gaze.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d-A, little\u2026it\u2019s such a shame.As if I was naked, I began to feel ashamed, and the blood that had cooled down was returning to its original state. As she shook her hand lightly, the mana that was restraining her gradually became loose. It wasn\u2019t intentional, but it looked like she was bizarrely tied up while trying to resist. Of course, depending on the viewer, this perception might not be strange at all.-Wow\u2026 I think I will buy it.It was indeed a big problem to free the Demon King, but I boldly released the mana that was holding her. She was, after all, already a dead person. As she was dead, she couldn\u2019t possibly do more harm to me.\u201cOkay. Can you explain it neatly and briefly so that you can convince me?\u201d-Hmm\u2026you have a twisted personality.\u201cThey said that my temper was a little bit grotesque.\u201d-Hmm\u2026She smiled emptily up at me. I felt a light reflection of myself in the red blood that was engraved in the patterns.\u201cYes, what should I do for the Demon King that was sealed in a divine sword?\u201d-Since you know my true identity, it is meaningless to persuade you.She smiled bitterly and sighed. Then, she looked up at me and quietly bowed her head, raising the ends of her dress.-Greetings, formally, my name is Perserk von Palan. I am the Demon King who looks at you from the abyss.The cause of the great war between ancient Middle-earth and the demons was in front of me. When someone looked into the abyss, that abyss also looked at them. It was her who was in that phrase. In that respect, she was a little different from a typical Demon King. She then looked up at me with a pleasant smile\u2026-The situation is simple. You seem to have already known that I was sealed with a divine sword.The divine sword was the sword that Haris, the sword god, used to cut down the devil to end the Great War. What was known outside was that the demon king\u2019s soul had been sealed in the sword. I heard it from him, so this one was not a lie.\u201cRight. I never thought I would be the one to awaken you.\u201d-It\u2019s not that Calderas is bad enough to stop his friend\u2019s will.Her words gave me pause.\u201cFriend?\u201d-Well, does this mean the personal situation means nothing? I will tell you exactly; I was only transferred from Calderas to you at the will of God.\u201c\u2026\u201dAt her words, I went silent, almost as if I had lost the ability to speak entirely. Why should I care about a God who had never come down? However, the will of God certainly existed. Because of that, sanctuary magic was possible. The starting point was also the divine magic I used to undo the Blood Polis. The question was, why did she come to me from Calderas?\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dI was really curious, and when I asked her, she merely laughed.-Because of you, we have entered an unintended symbiotic relationship, so shouldn\u2019t you be responsible?As if raising a small child, she continued to speak in the same condescending tone.-I\u2019m quite interested in you. You are the second person to bear the traces of the sword.\u201cHaris\u2019 swordsmanship?\u201d-It sounds like you know him well.\u201cOf course, he talked about you all the time.\u201d-I see\u2026 my story.The status window appeared in front of my eyes. Lies were useless, given it was her power. No matter who it was, she would eventually see through the truth and find the essence. At my words, she nodded.-I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t hide it.\u201cI\u2019m still going to have to selectively keep things secret. But, what good is a lie if you are a Demon King who has the power to see through people?\u201dShe smiled bitterly at my question.-It\u2019s the Hero\u2019s Corridor\u2026I didn\u2019t know there would be such a place. It\u2019s amazing. However, I\u2019m correcting one thing.\u201cWhich one?\u201d-I am not looking through you. I\u2019m just borrowing the power of higher beings. The status window that will express you. The slightly nasty way of expressing it is not my taste.\u201cA higher power?\u201d-Don\u2019t humans call them Gods?I laughed at the expression, the higher beings, who are in such a great position, gave the power to a half-mad man like me. The god granted divine power out of curiosity to a guy like me in the first place, so why should I expect more? She began to mutter in regret. From what I heard from Haris, she could read a person\u2019s thoughts. Her value of existence was the abyss that looked into the person staring in. That was why she was called the strongest Demon King ever.\u201cSo, because of the holy magic I used, you came from Calderas to me?\u201d-When you used the ninth tier magic, a large amount of divine power was released, and I came with it. My soul, which lost a place to go, seems to have settled in your stigmata like that. Originally, it was impossible\u2026Clucking her tongue briefly, she had a pitiful look on her face.-There are no eternal seals. If I knew it, I would\u2019ve bid goodbye to the ego of Calderas\u2026\u201cWhere is Calderas? Do you know?\u201d-Instinctively, you might already know. Don\u2019t you know that Calderas has fallen asleep in the aftermath of the ninth-tier holy magic you used?\u201cAh.\u201d-He\u2019ll sleep for about three more days. Listening to that talker may hurt my ears, but I wasn\u2019t bored. He\u2019ll probably yell and swear at you when he wakes up, hehe.Unlike the way she talked, she sounded like a child when she laughed. This was the Demon King, which became the cause of the Great War, or the origin of the Continental War. Her appearance was a little different from what was known in public. I knew she wasn\u2019t acting, not because of how she acted but because I had already heard.She was a scapegoat for war. And, he was a bad father who was taken advantage of at the moment. Haris, the swordsman, used to blame himself for what had happened\u2026-I felt weird when I first saw you. No way, I didn\u2019t think you would use some of the perfect prototypes of swordsmanship left by my father.To be precise, my swordsmanship was more like a collaboration between him and another. At first, I learned the unique swordsmanship of the sword, but it then began to change afterward.-If you evaluate it soberly, it looks like a modified sword style that best suits you.\u201cRight. The two old men who were crazy about swords made this. \u201cShe smiled bitterly and slowly flew up. She approached me, with small cute wings flapping behind her, and then she reached out to me.-Well, we have come this far. It is not so bad to move together, and the symbiosis isn\u2019t bad either. I look forward to your kind cooperation.From what she said, it was clear that even if she had a bad heart, there was no way to do anything now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The text on the status window had been altered as she adapted to me. As a result, she entered a parasitic relationship with me, which allowed me to borrow her power.\u2018It isn\u2019t that bad.\u2019The power she lent was pretty attractive. When I stretched out my index finger, she smiled cutely, grabbed the fingertip with her small hands, and shook it.-At least, you can show me more of the world than the current contractor who was unable to manifest Calderas. Can I expect more from you?Her question made me curious. \u201cShow the world?\u201d-If you live this long, the only thing you care about is to see the world.\u201cThen what will I get in return?\u201d-Of course, you will have my ability. That is the only thing I can give you. However, there is nothing weird about acquiring new skills as you have the will of the Gods.\u201cWhat do you mean by new skills?\u201d-Didn\u2019t you say that you see a status window? Maybe like a game in your previous life\u2026the concept of \u2018skills\u2019 may follow.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Is there more?\u201d-Unfortunately, that\u2019s all I have. I can\u2019t satisfy you like a Succubus with my body right now.\u201cNothing is impossible in the world.\u201d-Whoa\u2026I don\u2019t want you to say something like that, even if it\u2019s a joke; I\u2019m not interested in a little boy who is thousands of years younger than me.As she said this playfully, she began to disappear like scattering particles. It seemed like I unintentionally made the only person with who I shared my secrets leave.-Call me whenever you need me. I am going to catch some sleep inside of you.After that, she disappeared completely without making any noise. Because there were many things all at once, I couldn\u2019t help but feel so perplexed.* * *The capital of the Duchy of Felicity. Originally, this place should have been excited by the Continental Swordsmanship Competition. However, it was destroyed completely the day before by Baltian de Voltiz, who became a monster. The raid was big, aiming at the entire stadium hosted by numerous national coalitions. It was a huge raid that almost caused countless casualties. If I were a little bit late, the entire continent would have been engulfed in chaos, but it didn\u2019t go so badly. It was because I turned over the situation before it grew worse.The divine sword Calderas was the only one who saw me running wild. There was also Princess Ileana, who was called the princess of the sword and the owner of the divine sword. I couldn\u2019t determine whether she was awake or not, however. She might not have a clear memory even if she was awake.\u2018Now the priests believe that I had cleared the situation based on the Stigmata on my back and the remaining divine power in the stadium.\u2019It was detailed speculation. Besides, after they heard the priest, who checked my physical condition, they were frightened by the huge Stigmata on my body. What should I do to deal with this situation? Now, I couldn\u2019t hide what had been revealed, and there was no need for anything further.The fact that the traces of God had already been engraved on me would have spread everywhere. Why were they making a big deal out of the Stigmata? Only three saints or candidates for saints had them in the past three to four hundred years. There were very few people who could bear the stigmata.The trace was so precious that even if it were found in the Mainland, people would run just to see it. It wasn\u2019t just a genetic trait or something that could be achieved through effort. In short, it would be impossible not to attract attention, no matter how much I wanted to avoid it. Damn Stigmata.It might cause less attention if I just said I was a Swordmaster because the priests showed a maniacal obsession with the stigmata. Many humans would shout and rush without thinking, as if they abandoned logic and custom, unlike the nobles, who usually hid their true intentions.-Whoo whoo, it is true that the Stigmata is the evidence of God\u2019s love, but it\u2019s not a trace worthy of obsession in my eyes.\u2018You don\u2019t have to remind me bitterly.\u2019Muttering, I wondered how I could turn this unwelcomed attention away. There was only one way to solve this. The problem was that the size of the Stigmata was so big that it had destroyed the existing common sense.-W\u2026What are you thinking?\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve decided.\u201dThe decision itself was clear. And, what should I do with such a decision? Take action right away!\u201cBarris! Winley!\u201dI made a decision and called the two of them as the chaotic day continued.\u201cDid you call us, Davey?\u201dThey turned their eyes to me simultaneously as they were shivering in front of the wood-burning stove as the weather grew cold.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest. We are all annoyed by this situation, right?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d\u201cHonestly, we haven\u2019t committed any crime, but I don\u2019t know why the priests keep wanting to see you, brother.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t like it is some kind of Holy Land.\u201dThough, technically, more than half of this city was the Holy Land. That was right. Chamberlains and maids sent most of them back, while Barris and Whitney sent the rest of them away without any mercy. Those crazy priests. Most of the priests, who were eager to meet me, seemed to be more interested in my Stigmata, which was unprecedentedly bigger than the incident itself. As I watched Barris murmuring, I began to laugh, revealing my teeth.\u201cLet\u2019s pack! It\u2019s best to run away when it\u2019s complicated.\u201dThere was no reason to remain and explain it in the first place. I no longer cared as long as I was alive. Right? I had no obligation to remain and explain the whole story. If I stayed here, I would have to deal with all those obsessed priests. Because of this, it might not be a bad idea to leave some bait that could distract them.* * *Trembling.There was a loud trembling sound. A finely trembling finger holding a small teacup repeatedly hit the teacup like a machine vibrating.\u201cHe dipped?\u201d\u201cP\u2026Princess Majesty! Dipped\u2026 How could you say such a\u2026!\u201d\u201cJust answer the question, Linda.\u201d\u201cEep.\u201dPrincess Ileana looked at Linda with her eerie eyes.\u201cD\u2026 Did you just say he ran away? Did you? He accused me of causing a strange misunderstanding because he couldn\u2019t cover it all up, and he ran away with his brother and sister, right?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2026that is. When a person went there to request your visit, their lodge was already empty\u2026\u201dHer voice was low, so why was she so scary? Her golden hair trembled as if she was moving it by her will alone.\u201cShe smashed the enemy with the divine sword in the moment of crisis? Besides, the manifestation of the Stigmata was caused by the hidden power of the divine sword?\u201dThe truth was that she had passed out without any attempt to resist, and there was no hidden power within the sword.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dBullshit, that was ridiculous! Baltian, who had already turned into a monster, was destroyed by an unorthodox method, and the red woman was cut down with that overwhelming swordsmanship! Everyone else seemed to believe this was true, but she knew it; she had seen it all. He seemed to believe that she had lost her mind or some sort of equivalent state, but she saw it. What he said, and even what he showed.\u201cLinda, tell the knights to get ready.\u201d\u201cPrincess Majesty! Please calm down!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhh!! Find him! Find that snooty bastard! I\u2019m going to pull all of his hair out!\u201dDid people know? The true face of the Palan Empire\u2019s princess, which was known for her stiffness and coldness, had a wilder temperament than even Winley.Crack.\u201cYou got me wrong, Prince Davey. I\u2019m going to pull out everything on his head, so be prepared.\u201dHer growling eyes flashed like a ferocious beast.Night guests.The way back to the kingdom of Al Rown was very quiet. However, the priests who showed a maniacal obsession with the Stigmata weren\u2019t animals who couldn\u2019t distinguish between professional and private matters. They might have thought it was their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the Stigmata with their eyes.Barris and Winley, who were previously moving ahead with excitement, were sleeping, leaning against each other in the carriage corner, as they were too exhausted.\u2018Looking at them like this, they seem to have a tight sibling bond.\u2019Their bond was certainly special. Considering the brother and sisters\u2019 reality, only a few cared about each other while clashing a lot.-Hey you, the corner of your mouth is up a lot.\u2018Well, they look good.\u2019Perserk had woken up from sleep and slowly settled on my lap, sitting comfortably as she radiated light. Her existence was real, but she was still invisible to others. Because of this, there was no way her identity could be revealed, even if the guys were to wake up suddenly.-Actually, I thought you were interested in Calderas.\u2018Hmm?\u2019-You are the only one who can manifest Calderas other than the current master of the divine sword. In fact, in the current situation, it is accurate to say that you are the only one who is capable of manifesting Calderas.\u2018Ah.\u2019-Rather, you are the perfect candidate for the owner of Calderas.I chuckled at her because I knew what she meant. Calderas. It was an excellent sword. Because of this, it was quite hard to see a sword with a large amount of divine power, enough even, to use 9th tier holy magic just by adding a little to its divine power. However\u2026\u2018It\u2019s still not mine.\u2019-I thought you would want to take ownership by any means.\u2018It\u2019s a tempting offer, but I can\u2019t steal things from kids. Besides, Calderas isn\u2019t a good fit to me.\u2019-What do you mean that the sword is not a good fit for you?Strictly speaking, I didn\u2019t use a greatsword. I looked out of the window, leaving her in her silent worry. However, I had a different sword in mind. It wasn\u2019t available yet, but I should have the twin sword in my hand at Surt\u2019s request. The sword had been produced simultaneously as Calderas, and the material was also the same. However, the sword couldn\u2019t show its true value because it hadn\u2019t been completed in time.-I made a room in the basement of the house where I lived, which no one could open. You will be able to open the door after learning my skills. There are two swords, like my children, that I couldn\u2019t finish before I died. If you find them, complete them with your own hands. I don\u2019t care if you become the owner of the twin swords, tell people that you made them, or sell them. Do whatever you\u2019d like.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What if I screw up?]-Hey, what you\u2019re talking about? How are you going to mess it up? You have more grit than me. You will know once you get there.He was blaming his short life for why he couldn\u2019t finish them. When I go back now, what should I do? I didn\u2019t have to worry for long.\u2018I need to get rid of something.\u2019-Getting rid of something. It sounds like you hold resentment against someone.\u2018Don\u2019t you already know that?\u2019-You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t always know everything, though. There are some parts inside your mind that I don\u2019t even have access to.There was something that even the Demon King of the Abyss couldn\u2019t see. It seemed that she was aware that I wasn\u2019t feeling well in the first place.-By the way, how are you going to manage it? You might not want to just take the upfront approach.\u2018Yes, I can\u2019t just act before the preparations are done. I can probably handle Queen Liness without too much trouble. However, it will cause many problems that would put the entire Al Rown Kingdom in danger if I remove the nobles led by Duke Barrieta too quickly. Even if we start purging right away, we can\u2019t stop the Al Rown Kingdom from staggering.\u2019It would take too much time to remove one by one. Queen Liness would maintain such an arrogant attitude, and the royal family couldn\u2019t even punish the nobles.\u2018I have an idea.\u2019-Can I ask you one thing?\u2018What is it?\u2019-What do you want?The voice was sweet, like a demon seducing someone. But she was fair; I knew she wasn\u2019t going to do everything that I asked for. When she asked the question, she probably already knew the answer in the first place.\u2018I want to make a family, eat well in a warm house, and live a long, long life without too much stress.\u2019She burst into laughter.-It sounds far from the life of the royal family. Though, aren\u2019t you already living like that?\u2018Do you think I do?\u2019-Not at all.\u2018Then all right, I\u2019m going to leave the palace. Fortunately, the royal family members own land on a small scale, as I do, although it is barren.\u2019I said calmly with a smile.-You\u2026\u2018It should have character if possible. How about the only high-tech city on the continent?\u2019-It is a huge dream. It would be faster to become the king of Al Rown Kingdom and change the country.\u2018Once you become king, you can\u2019t have a comfortable life.\u2019-Did you think it would be different if you become a landowner?\u2018It is possible as a landowner. I\u2019m going to make lots of money, retire, and enjoy my hobby.\u2019I will try my best if it\u2019s possible. If there were a technical issue, I would replace it with something else. The advancement was a bit slow in science globally, but it was pretty good in other areas. Maybe it would be safer and better in the future.\u2018I will make my city when I return.\u2019* * *There were no more attacks on the way back to the Al Rown Kingdom; perhaps they had no more energy left to attack me anymore. Sharis, who seemed to be a close maid to Queen Liness, even failed, then who would dare to try another raid? I don\u2019t know if she knew the truth, but at least she would have noticed that she wasn\u2019t in a situation where she could tamper with me.\u201cYou did a great job.\u201dIt was a small encouragement.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s just a problem of the Voltiz Kingdom, having done such a shameless thing against the Confederation of Nations.\u201dBarris, bowing his head down on one knee, was silent. Because Baltian turned into a monster, public opinion on the continent was overwhelmingly unfavorable to the Voltiz Kingdom. If the Voltiz Kingdom was an Al Rown Kingdom\u2019s ally, we might find a way to help them, but unfortunately, Voltiz and Al Rown were locked in a cold war.\u201cI am glad that you came back safe despite such trouble.\u201dKing Crianes spoke calmly with a weary face.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dHe looks at me at the end of the faint words. I said nothing to that strangely mixed expression.\u201cI heard about your Stigmata.\u201d\u201cI received too much blessing from God.\u201d\u201cWe should celebrate that blessing.\u201dHe muttered and turned his head.\u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Queen Liness?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026we should celebrate.\u201dShe had a worried look on her face, full of confusion and complexity. She probably expected that I would have been dead, yet I came back with the Stigmata. Whoever they were, the ones with the Stigmata became the center of attention. If she were caught attacking me, it was likely that the Mainland would intervene. I wasn\u2019t trying to get support from the Mainland, but it seems like I did anyway. Of course, I had no intention of accepting any help.\u201cQueen Majesty doesn\u2019t seem to be excited that I have the Stigmata.\u201dAs I responded with a smile, she opened her fan to cover her mouth. Then she curled her eyes and smiled. My eyes trembled; this woman was something else.\u201cWhat are you talking about? The child\u2019s happiness is the mother\u2019s happiness.\u201d\u201cIf so, I am glad.\u201dI saw her clenching her teeth. Even though she covered her mouth with a fan, it wasn\u2019t hard to notice her discomfort.\u201cHow is your body? Did you get hurt anywhere?\u201d\u201cFine, I came back without any scars, perhaps because I was blessed.\u201dWhen he answered calmly, he turned his head as if it were satisfactory.\u201cDuke Barrieta.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWe cannot pass this matter without any action, and we will have to file a petition to the Confederation of Nations and strongly complain against the Voltiz State.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dEven though it wasn\u2019t as obvious as Queen Liness, King Crianes had a strangely grumpy look. His unfavorable child came back with the Stigmata, so it caused him a headache.\u201cYou must be tired from the long trip, so go back to your room and relax.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dAs I stood up, bowing my head calmly, Barris and Whitney turned around after me.\u201cDavey.\u201dIt was then. Crianes, after a moment of silence, quietly called my name.\u2018It\u2019s been freaking long that you called my name.\u2019My voice clung to my throat, but I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cWill you stay for a minute?\u201dUnderstanding what he meant, I quietly bowed my head; everyone else got up and slowly left. Queen Liness was looking at King Crianes and me but soon bowed her head silently under the gaze of Crianes and left the office.It was quiet. It was the first meeting alone with him, who had ignored my request to visit since I recovered from the coma.\u201cDavey.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been almost half a year.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty hasn\u2019t talked to me alone since I recovered from the coma.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say anything at my words. He looked like a lost, powerless lion without any ambition.\u201cAre you blaming me?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason to lie. Yes, I am. You don\u2019t have to say when it started.\u201dHe sighed bitterly at the thorns in my words. Do you think I came back for a short-term issue?\u201cI\u2019m glad you look healthy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019ve been paying some attention to me.\u201d\u201cDid you know?\u201d\u201cI feel good.\u201dAt my words, he smiled bitterly.\u201cOf course, my prediction was right.\u201d\u201cCan I ask what you mean?\u201d\u201cNo parents are stupid enough to not notice their son\u2019s change. When you woke up from a coma, you were a little different.\u201dTalking calmly, he stood up slowly. Then he sat down by the table that chamberlain set up and quietly offered me tea.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have some?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe smiled bitterly once again at the short answer.\u201cAre you not going to call me father?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dHe was silent at my words.\u201cThe word father is a word for your parent.\u201dHe just kept smiling bitterly and didn\u2019t say anything at my rude answer.\u201cShould I call you father?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t deserve to be your father as one who left you alone in those difficult times.\u201dI didn\u2019t say anything after him; I guess he already knew.\u201cYou wanted to meet me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a little while. And I just wanted to ask you one question.\u201dIt was a different question this time. It was just a moment, but it reminded me of a memory.[Father! Please save my mother!][Aren\u2019t you already aware of her health condition?][It\u2019s not a disease! It is poison!][Stop that nonsense!]He was so cold that he forced me to stop talking about my mother. Four years later, at the age of nine, I asked him again when I found out that Queen Liness was behind my mother\u2019s death, and he said.[The former queen, Lenny Alisha, had a chronic illness. No one was able to cure her disease, even the exceptional doctors and powerful priests!][Do you still believe it? The timing doesn\u2019t make sense! Do you think that makes sense?!][Davey! I won\u2019t tolerate it if you talk about it once more! Go back!]\u201cHow did you feel when you abandoned my mother, whom you once loved so much?\u201dHis face turned bitter at my words.\u201cDavey.\u201d\u201cThe King Majesty chose the country over my mother. For the sake of the nation\u2019s security, you let go of my poisoned mother\u2019s hand, and for the sake of the nation, you remarried with the enemy.\u201d\u201cDo not blame her too much. It was my fault, my karma.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I have no interest in your romantic history. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Queen Liness and mother were friends a long time ago, or her jealousy had caused the catastrophe.\u201d\u201cDavey.\u201d\u201cI wanted to ask you, were you really fine? My mother said she wanted to see King Majesty before she died. Even though she was throwing up blood, she was only looking for you, Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t say anything while I continued.\u201cYou did that. Mother shed tears in front of me and said that she was sorry and left-\u201c\u201cBe the king.\u201dHe continued his speech before I answered.\u201cI was not an excellent king nor a caring father. I had a lack of knowledge and strength.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you will be different. You may be able to fix everything. However, you are not ready yet. The world is not as green as you might think. Dangers are lurking everywhere, and some people are dangerously smart enough to manipulate you as easily as they bake and boil food.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cA king isn\u2019t in a place where you can do everything as you think, but rather, a king has to make decisions that may look incomprehensible to others. So hold your breath and build your strength so that no one can stop what you want to do.\u201dI laughed at his words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, you have been holding on to the wound for too long. Do you know why I want to leave this damn kingdom alone without destroying it? I smiled at him, thinking to myself.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already too late. Anyone would know that the nobles, led by Duke Barrieta, hold a strong power unless they are stupid. When someone\u2019s life is in danger, they cut their rescue rope to survive.\u201d\u201cDavey\u2026\u201d\u201cThey say that children resemble their parents. However, I will be different. If you are the king and a father who abandons your family for the sake of the country, then I am willing to take a different path.\u201dHe went silent at my firm answer.\u201cYou said the throne is the brightest spot that numerous people want to sit.\u201dAt my words, his eyes lowered quietly.\u201cYou should polish the seat and give it to Barris. I am not interested in it even if it is given to me.\u201d* * *-You tend to be a little harsh.\u2018It was necessary to do this.\u2019-Tch. Tch, you said he isn\u2019t your family, but you have too much affection for him.As I returned to the palace, muttering bitterly, I looked at Perserk.-You\u2019ve already seen my powerful insight and\u2026\u2018Whatever I saw, does it change my decision? Besides, even you can\u2019t see everything.\u2019-That is true.\u201cAmy.\u201d\u201cYes! Your Majesty!\u201dShe raised her head, responding to my call with a cheerful face.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep, so don\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAmy could have asked a question, which she did at first. But now, she quietly obeyed my order without any questions. Was it because she trusts me, or was she just obedient?-Where are you going?\u2018The rabbit digs several ways to escape.\u2019-Yes.\u2018Did you say it was the Black Moon? Duke Barrieta would have hidden a lot of information in case his people betray him.\u2019If I find all the information there, I could tear the limbs off of the nobles.-Then a bloody wind will blow.\u2018I told you, I can\u2019t solve any problem by killing everyone. At least I have to be innocent.\u2019-That means\u2026oh, dear.She smiled when she realized what I meant.\u2018Because people sometimes cut their rescue rope to survive.\u2019Duke Barrieta would be strangled by the hands of those who served him. I had the evidence of his collusion with the vampire so that I could destroy him right away without any trouble.\u2018Then let\u2019s go.\u2019After I created a double of myself sleeping with simple ghost magic, I opened the window.[ Invisibility ]Fifth-tier stealth magic. The mana that was stopped at the 4th tier grew and entered the 5th, making it possible to use this spell. I stepped out of the window without hesitation when I found myself slowly assimilating and disappearing into my surroundings.* * *Secret information guild, Black Moon. There were numerous guilds that specialized in assassination or information in the Al Rown Kingdom. Among the information guilds, Black Moon had overwhelming power and scale that couldn\u2019t be challenged at any time. Unlike other information guilds, the range of the Black Moon Guild was widely spread throughout many countries as well as in the Al Rown Kingdom.The guild leader of the Information Guild frowned at the report in front of him.\u201cSharis is missing?\u201d\u201cYes, she disappeared without a trace.\u201d\u201cMany of Sharis\u2019s assassins have disappeared before.\u201d\u201cYes, according to the information, it appears that the attempt to assassinate Prince Davey, Prince Barris, and Princess Whitney has failed.\u201dHe closed his eyes as his assistant replied with an expressionless face and left. Sharis, who was disguised as Queen Liness\u2019s maid, was an A-class intelligent agent. Ostensibly. Moreover, she was an agent from the dispatched headquarters of the Black Moon Guild. Unknown name, unknown address, and possessing an alluring beauty and a sense of intimidation.The Black Moon Guild could be said to be a big guild. The exact origin of the Guild was so deep that even the Guild leader of the Al Rown Kingdom branch couldn\u2019t fathom it. Therefore, he had no way to prove whether Sharis was an A-class agent. She could have been just a member of the headquarters disguised as an A-class. Was it possible to defeat someone like her?Even though her skill was known as A-class, and it wouldn\u2019t be strange if she had a higher class based on her performance. It just didn\u2019t make sense that such a person like her failed in her assassination and was now missing, presumably due to the weak prince who was known to have neither physical strength nor political power.\u2018It seems like things are going erratically. I will have to leave this place after burning all the information except for what\u2019s necessary.\u2019The choice had to be made boldly. If you sense something strange, you have to get out of the place quickly to survive. With these kinds of thoughts in mind, the leader of the Black Moon Guild quietly pressed the button that was attached to the bottom of the desk. The button would call his assistant.Click\u2026click, click.However, he didn\u2019t hear anyone coming even after pressing the button a few more times. The moment he pressed the button, someone was supposed to come into his room, but no one showed up. What did this mean? It was like an alarm ringing, driving his instincts.\u2018Oh shit!\u2019\u201cStop, don\u2019t move.\u201dThen, he heard a quiet voice coming from thin air. The voice was soft but eerie at the same time.\u201cHuh?!\u201dBang!The moment he pulled his sword from the sheath when he heard the voice, a black figure appeared and broke his arm, quickly pressing him into his desk.\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s human. Are you not a vampire?\u201dThe voice that muttered was that of a boy, who was probably mid-to-late teens at most.\u201cI don\u2019t mind you screaming, no one is coming, no matter how much you shout.\u201dThe boy, squeezing him and whispering, stretched out his finger. Simultaneously, the tightly closed door opened slowly. A strong smell of blood stabbed him in his nose.\u2018Oh my god, dear god!\u2019His eyes opened in astonishment. When it came to secrecy, the Black Moon Guild was one of the best guilds. It was where the best assassins in the kingdom gathered, and dozens of people who were perfect assassins were hidden there. But not a single person noticed when he entered. If anyone had noticed, he would have received the report.But not now. As if everyone didn\u2019t even know how they died, there was no sign of resistance.\u2018He is strong! If things are going this way, I can\u2019t even resist for a second and will die!\u2019He instantly thought he would die at the hands of the boy who overpowered him; it didn\u2019t matter where he came from. He had many talented people in his Guild capable of killing anything without being spotted. But none of that mattered; this boy was capable of attacking the best information guild in the Al Rown Kingdom.And, he held no mercy in his hands.\u201cHuh\u2026who sent you? Are you from the Luxo Guild, Karsha guild, or not\u2026did the headquarter send you?\u201dAlthough he was the guild leader of the Black Moon Guild in the Al Rown Kingdom, the headquarters of the Black Moon Guild was an unreliable organization. That\u2019s why it was a very secret and dangerous place. The Karsha Guild and the Luxo Guild, who were their competitors, were great but not significant enough to destroy the Black Moon Guild overnight like this. If so, was the headquarters trying to exit this place? There were thoughts in his head, but he remained silent.\u201cDo you want to live?\u201dIn the dark, his red eyes curled eerie and strangely.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cIf you want to live, I want you to give me some information.\u201dHe heard him giggle, causing goosebumps to rise on his arms.\u201cIf you\u2026if you wanted some information\u2026 I hope you followed the proper process\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that could be bought with just money.\u201dAt the boy\u2019s words, he clenched his teeth and thought calmly. If he went against the boy\u2019s will, he was going to die. Although he had excellent assassination skills, the boy had exceptional talent. If so, he shouldn\u2019t bother him as much as possible.\u2019\u201cI\u2026I will tell you everything. I\u2019ll give you the information you want.\u201d\u201cReally? Well, I\u2019ll take it if you\u2019re offering.\u201d\u2018Stupid bastard! You are the one who threatened to steal the information.\u2019He agreed, but he didn\u2019t resist. If he said something wrong, he was going to die. That was what his instincts screamed.Phew!When the restraining force holding his body disappeared instantly, he fell and took a deep breath. It was a very harsh and dull reaction, unlike his usual self.\u201cHuff\u2026huff\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want a lot. Give me the list of the nobles who are the limbs of Duke Barrieta, who are shaking the country, and the notes on the corruption they committed.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026what?\u201d\u201cThere will be information that Duke Barrieta has collected secretly to take their lives. And he\u2019ll keep them here, right?\u201dAt that, the guild leader quickly turned his gaze to confirm the boy\u2019s identity in front of him.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHowever, his actions were quickly blocked. The boy\u2019s hand was slightly bent, and eerie energy suppressed his whole body.\u2018Master Assassin!\u2019Realizing what the eerie energy was, his expression turned to fright. Very few assassins reached the master level, which was extremely difficult. It may be possible to beat a master, but very few people broke through the barrier of self-enlightenment. So it didn\u2019t take much time to realize how absurd the boy in front of him was.\u2018A Master Assassin in a small country like this?! Nonsense!\u2019He was the prince who has been in a coma for six years. He couldn\u2019t understand from common sense that the prince, who had been awakened for less than half a year, had such skills. He smiled at the boy, Davey.\u201cJust to let you know, detecting lies is my specialty. No need to bluff. The choice is up to you.\u201dBecause of his terrifying energy, the guild leader trembled quietly.* * *\u201cH\u2026Here you are.\u201dAs soon as I received the scroll from the shuddering man, I immediately checked the contents and put it quietly in my arms as if to save it.\u201cI\u2026I gave everything you wanted. S\u2026so please step back now.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dAs if he was worried, his expression was wrinkled. What else do you want from me?!His face was saying something like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think this is enough.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026if\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like unnecessary killing that much.\u201dAs I stood up, talking calmly, he looked perplexed.\u201cForget everything you saw today.

It was confidential information that needed a password to access. They could have used magical artifacts. The information accessible with the guild leader\u2019s authority was more extensive and detailed than I thought. There were reasons why they were the best guild in the kingdom.But I didn\u2019t stop there.-As you said, a rabbit wouldn\u2019t have dug only one burrow.\u201cThere must be missing information. It must have been hidden in other information guilds.\u201dThe Black Moon Guild was the largest Information guild in the Al Rown Kingdom, without a doubt. However, even if it was a large Information guild, having all the information in one place was dangerous. If you put all the information in one place, there would be a higher liability. Duke Barrieta was no fool, so he must have prepared several alternatives.I was going to put them in an irreversible situation. Even though it was a fragment of information, there was content about Duke Barrieta\u2019s attempt to seek the position of King through Carlos. If you think about it, this country\u2026the Al Rown kingdom hadn\u2019t appointed the next king, the crowned prince.-Are you going to handle them yourself?\u201cWhy would I do that? There is someone else who can do that for me.\u201d-There is someone else\u2026\u201cNo matter how high-ranking as aristocrats they are, they still have political rivals.\u201d-But, will they move according to your will?\u201cA beast, who is starved to death, can\u2019t pass by its victim.

It would be great if you recognize his contribution by rewarding him.\u201d\u201cRewarding him?\u201d\u201cI heard that Prince Davey has already been given a manor. I heard it\u2019s the region of Hines.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dEach member of royalty had their own manor. The criterion was that the royal family member who came of age would receive one. Of course, when he became of age, a manor was granted by the kingdom for Davey. It was the eastern part of the kingdom, Hines, a province facing the Mainland. However, while it was a massive area of land, it was also largely barren. It would be a waste to abandon, but had too few resources or specialties to develop.It was Queen Liness\u2019s idea that the land should be handed down to David.\u201cNow, Prince Davey seems to be almost recovered, so why don\u2019t you let him go down and develop the land so that he can benefit the kingdom.\u201dQueen Liness suggested with a pretty smile. She didn\u2019t think it would be successful at once, as he was constantly deviating from her intentions. It would have been perfect for her if he had died in a coma. He\u2019d been a thorn in Liness\u2019s eyes since he got up.She didn\u2019t like it. The assassination failed not once but twice. Moreover, one of her biggest secrets, Sharis, had gone missing. Someone was protecting him. Was it the king or someone else? The Marquis Patelis could have been within the radar of suspects, but it still couldn\u2019t explain the situation unless he was directly engaged.It was complicated.The assassins couldn\u2019t defeat him, and the Stigmata made it difficult to blame him as a madman and put him in confinement as a disqualified prince. There was only one way left; legally remove him from the royal palace. There were lots of methods, whether it is through an arranged marriage or independence. The reason she made that decision was that she couldn\u2019t keep an eye on him anymore.The day before, someone robbed all the information guilds. Not one or two, but seven information guilds in this country were robbed in a single day. She couldn\u2019t figure out who did it, but her instinct was yelling at her that it was the same person who had been helping the prince. The backer seemed so vicious that she thought she had no means to win.The only answer was that she didn\u2019t want to fight such a monster. If the information from the information guilds went to the Marquis of Patelis, known as a political rival of the nobles\u2026The aftermath that would arise was that the nobles, led by Duke Barrieta, who had stood firmly, could be shaken at once. She had to be careful dealing with her opponent because the information was dangerously valuable. She had to even consider a rebellion in such a problematic situation, which was her last resort. That was why she made the suggestion.Now that she wasn\u2019t in a situation to care for Davey, she has no choice but to put the troubling child on hold for a while. She was uncertain if King Crianes would approve it, but she had to try it first. She smiled at King Crianes, looking at her as if examining her intention.\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not good education for a grown-up prince who isn\u2019t the crowned prince to continue to stay in the royal palace.\u201dQueen Liness looked surprised at his calm reply. Why all of a sudden? His surprising decision caused her eyes to widen.\u2018What the hell is this guy thinking?\u2019King Crianes thwarted all of the strategies she had put in place to cut Davey\u2019s breath short. She couldn\u2019t understand, but it wasn\u2019t bad either. If she could get rid of him, she no longer needed to worry about the problem right now. If Hines\u2019 Manor developed, it would be a tremendous strength for him, but she was convinced it would never be. Hines\u2019 province was a barren land that could practically be called cursed.\u201cSpeaking of which, why don\u2019t we get ready, chamberlain!\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cCall Davey.\u201dSeeing him speaking boldly, Queen Liness looked like she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or frown.* * *\u201cPrince Majesty, the King Majesty is looking for you.\u201d\u201cThe King?\u201d\u201cYes, you should change into your formal outfit and visit his Majesty\u2019s palace.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026okay.\u201dWhen Vespers, the chief of staff, came to me, I watched his back with narrow eyes. What brings you here? Suddenly I thought about it, and when I woke up, I saw Perserk lying in bed and sleeping.\u2018Wake up.\u2019-Hmm\u2026let me sleep a little bit more\u2026She mumbled and rolled up in the sheet that was a dozen times larger than her body. She was invisible to others, but she was real, so if someone were watching, it would look like a ghost was rolling about.\u2018Wake up. I\u2019ll let you sleep as long as you want later.\u2019Of course, I had no intention of indulging this naughty Demon King\u2019s grievance.-You have no mercy on me. I hardly ever get good sleep because you wake me up all the time. You have to guarantee me more sleep.\u2018We have a big age difference, but let\u2019s not say something that could mislead others.\u2019-Hmm\u2026you\u2019re a mess.As she slowly got up, she yawned and sat on my head.\u201cLet me help you get dressed, your Majesty.\u201cPlease.\u201dAt my words, Amy smiled, looking to be in a good mood.* * *I expected this. Since he realized that my existence was like a strange bomb, he would have decided that he couldn\u2019t leave me here anymore.\u201cGo and cultivate the assigned Hines land. Brighten your existence more and more.\u201dHe acted like a father who tossed pains on his son to motivate him. However, I had already learned that the meaning behind his speech was different because of Perserk\u2019s whispering.-Hmm\u2026he is afraid that you\u2019ll take things too far here, so he is going to relocate us somewhere else.\u2018Don\u2019t remind me for no reason.\u2019-Haven\u2019t you noticed anyway?Perserk shrugged.-Your father doesn\u2019t seem to fully believe in your abilities yet.\u2018If he didn\u2019t do this, I would have left on my own.\u2019No mines had been discovered, and since it was a wasteland, clearing it to make farmland wouldn\u2019t be easy. The monster\u2019s habitat was also not too far away. The only good thing I found was its potential as a transportation hub, but that was only if the roads were paved properly.Oh, there was one more. The land of Baron Alisha, the home of my mother, was right there. There was nothing left of Baron Alisha now, who became a low-ranking nobleman after having been quietly dismantled. My mother\u2019s parents, my maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother, had already passed away.Although my mother had a younger brother, who was the only blood relative left, he was missing. I thought my face would have frowned automatically, but when I remained unexpectedly calm, King Crianes had a little doubt in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if I am gone, I have someone who will replace my role.\u2019Right now, we are just keeping an eye on the aristocrats. However, when they see the gift I prepared, the royal palace would become a sea of blood from the endless purges. It would be hard to stop the power dynamics that aristocrats had because they were a cause-oriented group.Barris and Winley, who were highly likely to be affected by the consequences, would soon return to their original provinces to remain safe from the incident.\u201cI will follow your order.\u201d\u201cGood, when will you be able to leave?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to wait. I will leave as soon as I get ready.\u201dThe sooner I made the decision, the better it was. It might have been better to say that I would leave right now, but I needed time to prepare myself before I move.-You, you are dangerous. Thousands of people might die based on your decision.\u2018If the kingdom remains the same even after Barris becomes king, we would be better off without the kingdom. So, before that happens, the changes are for the better.\u2019I had no intention of handing over the messy reality to my younger brother. It would be better if I get a chance to get rid of the enemies with a bit of effort. This fight wouldn\u2019t cause the doom of Queen Liness or Duke Barrieta at once. However, with my perfect preparation, I was sure that they would gradually lose their power.Would that be all? Their relationship, which had been tightly tied up, would fall apart instantly. Consequently, severe turmoil will follow. What was going to happen next?Civil war.I didn\u2019t want to be involved in the complicated political scene. If I were here, the chances were more likely that I would get involved. So, before Queen Liness initiates her sly plans, I was thinking of leaving this place. The next time I show up would be when they made an irreversible choice.At that time, I will slice their necks.\u201cIf that is what you want to do, we will follow your decision. We have high expectations for you, so make sure to bring good news to the kingdom soon.\u201d\u201cI will keep it in mind, Majesty.\u201dAs I said so, I had to hold myself back from laughing.* * *When I left the room and returned to the first Prince\u2019s palace, I saw a clean wall greeting me. The first Prince\u2019s palace, which used to look like a haunted house, was now immaculate to this level. Unfortunately, It was now time to leave it behind.\u201cAmy, go to the Treasury and the Land Department to retrieve all the documents for the land in Hines.\u201d\u201cDocuments? Which ones should I ask for?\u201d\u201cEverything without missing anything. If you say I sent you, they\u2019ll give the documents to you.\u201dIt may be challenging to understand everything quickly due to the large volume, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was confident I could read a few hundred documents to store in my head.\u2018Know your enemy\u2026\u2019-and know yourself. You will win every single battle. It\u2019s a pretty impressive proverb. Did it come from your previous life?\u2018There is a similar phrase here.\u2019-We had a similar one back in my day.As for the proverb, it was interesting where they all came from. Perserk, giggling as she found it funny, had a look of excitement on her face.-Don\u2019t you think it is funny?\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dAfter Amy left quietly, bowing her head, I no longer had to have a conversation with my inside voice. At my question, she jumped over my legs. Then, with both legs folded outward, she sat down and looked up.-I like it when things get interesting, don\u2019t you have a lot of strength and skill?\u201cHmm.\u201d-Nevertheless, you never try to cross the line of arrogance that you set for yourself. This is quite interesting.I couldn\u2019t understand her taste.\u201cVicarious satisfaction? Isn\u2019t it something like that?\u201d-My life was kind of boring, so maybe I am feeling satisfaction through watching your life.\u201cI had never thought that I was going to be the subject of somebody\u2019s vicarious satisfaction.\u201d-Be proud of yourself because I am about to become your fan as a former Demon King.She grinned and bowed. Then she put her cheeks on my thighs and closed her eyes as if she was going to sleep.-I am getting a little sleepy\u2026The phrase \u2018beauty sleep\u2019 best suited this woman. It seemed like she spent a lot of time sleeping to maintain her overwhelming beauty. From a positive perspective, it was ultimately her way of taking care of herself.On the contrary, it was just her being lazy since she\u2019s got a lot of free time.-Hmm\u2026you seem to have a strangely unpleasant thought.She was excessively bright. It must have been because of her life, where she had analyzed countless people without using the power of detection.-I\u2026I\u2019ll sleep a little\u2026don\u2019t move\u2026\u201cMy thighs are expensive.\u201d-You\u2026um\u2026your legs are firm and fluffy, so it feels good to fall asleep\u2026She fell asleep after saying that. She didn\u2019t disappear like before, and I didn\u2019t want to wake her up, so I let her sleep.\u201cMajesty! I brought what you asked!\u201dIt was then. I thought it would take longer, but it didn\u2019t.\u201cIs this all?\u201d\u201cYes, they said this is all the information about the land.\u201d\u201cI guess this is it since it\u2019s only a remote area of the countryside\u2026.\u201dI laughed at the surprisingly lacking amount of information. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be a lot, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this little.\u201cGreat.\u201dAs soon as I took the papers and skimmed them, an irresistible sigh flowed out of my mouth.\u201cA cursed land? I guess this what I have.\u201dIt was an unbiased evaluation.* * *Cursed land. A barren wasteland. A land where the drought never stops. The dying land.There were many ways of expressing it, but I could simplify the evaluation of the Hines manor. At first, I thought Queen Liness had blocked information about where I was going, but that wasn\u2019t true. The state of the land was so terrible that it wasn\u2019t worth hiding.\u201cExcept for ten percent of the land, all the land dried up due to drought.\u201d-Hmm\u2026whether it is mine or not is terrible. However, particular areas need some additional research. Since there is no adjacent sea, it seems impossible to have a fishing industry or any sea trade.Without my attention, Perserk, lying asleep on my leg, yawned and muttered. She was a pretty smart Demon King. She was once the king of an entire species, and she had lived for thousands of years even if she was sealed. My experience wasn\u2019t nearly enough to evaluate her.\u201cFrom five years ago, the provinces couldn\u2019t afford to pay taxes, so the country has given them a tax reduction.\u201dThe policy of reducing taxes for poor estates was a bill that my father, King Crianes, promoted when he was young. The reason behind this was that there were no benefits toward the kingdom when he tried to impose excessive taxes on a poor manor that couldn\u2019t even afford to pay it. It was previously aggravating the publics\u2019 sentiment.That was precisely what the current situation of Hines was. Ten years ago, it had served its purpose as land. However, at present, there were no elements that could be advocated except for it having a significant transportation advantage as a checkpoint on the way to the Mainland.\u201cIt might be better to throw me in the middle of the desert.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t really to that extent, though.-There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll ever get anything back from such a bare land. How much support can the kingdom provide?\u201cLooking at it, a handful of slaves and material resources seem to be everything. I refused everything because they could use it as a tool against me.\u201d-That doesn\u2019t seem enough anyway. We won\u2019t be able to figure out the situation until we re-examine everything first.\u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d-Can you see it here? It says it\u2019s a cursed land.It was five years ago that it stopped raining in the estate. According to the rumor, the specific reason was unknown; it seemed that an unknown curse was placed on the land. It was said that it was caused by the alien races living in the forest, but honestly, the chances of that being true were low. If the curse is limited to just drought and it rained again, a considerable amount of land could be used as farmland.\u201cThe keeper must have died already.\u201d-You underestimate my potential. What is the use of spiritualism and alchemy?\u201cThat is right, thanks for the advice.\u201dPerserk was a pretty good talker and consultant. At least she knew what I had to do. I had learned a lot in the Corridor, but I never studied geography. Knowing what to do to survive was different from the knowledge that changed the world. Even in areas that I wasn\u2019t aware of, she had quite an in-depth knowledge. Moreover, the fact that she was someone with whom I could have good communication with also played a part.-Whatever it is, it\u2019s hard to judge at will unless we actually see it for ourselves. Well, even if it\u2019s not enough, I can lend you a certain amount of foolish wisdom as you have a symbiotic friendship with me.\u201cIs my leg your compensation?\u201d-There aren\u2019t many beds that are as comfortable to sleep on as your legs, for sure.She was smiling cutely.* * *A few days passed. The speed at which we processed information together had become so quick that there was no longer a need to confirm with each other. As we talked about the development of the manor, we often ended up staying up all night. She often fell into a deep sleep from which she could not wake up from. Perhaps the reason was that the longer she uses her powers to materialize, the faster she grew tired.As soon as the sun came up, the royal castle was crowded with processions leaving for Hines. There weren\u2019t that many leaving: me, who would be inaugurated as the lord, and my exclusive maid, Amy, who would assist me, followed by a few attendants and maids. In addition to this, some of the knights would stay with me for a while.I was a bit poor\u2026-You must have too much time since you are acting silly.\u2018Hmm.\u2019I had no knights or nobles who pledged allegiance to me. Therefore, this modest procession was also a natural result in some way. When Barris and Winley heard that I was leaving, they immediately came to me and complained. It was apparently because they knew what the Hines land was like. Barris shouted,\u2018We\u2019ll go to the Majesty and petition against it!\u2019\u201cJust believe in your brother.\u201dThen he became so upset that he left the room immediately. Afterward, Winley, who had wiped her tears with a handkerchief, quietly hugged me.\u201cDavey, if you have any trouble, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us. We will come and get you no matter what.\u201dWho were these 14-year-old kids taking care of? Still, I was grateful for them being so thoughtful, so I just stroked Winley\u2019s head, which made her cry out loud even louder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEpisode 33Barris and Winley seemed upset because they had to return to their place soon, even though they wanted to follow me.\u2018I guess I am finally leaving this damn palace.\u2019-I don\u2019t think I\u2019m leaving here forever, but I\u2019m pretty excited for the future.\u2018How miserable will it be?\u2019At my thoughts, she, sitting on my thigh as if riding a horse, turned her head and smiled.-Isn\u2019t it fun? I am curious about what you\u2019re going to do.I don\u2019t know what to do with your high expectations.\u201cMajesty.\u201dI was quietly getting ready to leave the palace. As I lifted my head to the unanticipated voice, an elderly man slowly walked in under the guidance of Amy. His age was around 70 years old. However, compared to ordinary people of his age in this continent, he looked strong and gave an imposing appearance.\u201cI am Marquis Patelis, and it is an honor to see the little sun of the kingdom.\u201d\u201cPlease get up, Marquis of Patelis.\u201dUsually, I wouldn\u2019t have said that, but he was different. There were only three swordmasters in the Al Rown kingdom, and among them, he had the best skills and experience. He was well respected by the knights of the Al Rown Kingdom, and countless knights on the continent showed their respect just upon hearing his name.It wasn\u2019t just that. He was also the most crucial candidate with who I chose to destroy the nobility. The swordmaster was a kind of strategic weapon. Although he didn\u2019t have a large number of troops, he became a central pillar of the country only by his strength and the power of his long-established family.Usually, he held a neutral stance and kept a distance from the nobles, but now he wouldn\u2019t stay neutral anymore. A few days after stealing all the information from the information guilds, I snuck into Patelis\u2019 bedroom and left him all the information the nobles wanted to hide. Since he was a man of enormous loyalty and self-discipline, he would soon begin to investigate the aristocracy as soon as he vetted the authenticity of the information.\u201cI heard you\u2019re leaving.\u201d\u201cIt happened to be that way. Any adult royal family members must leave the palace unless they are the crowned prince.\u201d\u201cIn the future, you might become the crowned prince.\u201d\u201cThat is a matter of the future.\u201dAs I smiled, he adjusted his monocle and smiled vainly.\u201cYou have grown a lot. If the former queen were here, she would have been so proud of you.\u201d\u201cTo my mother, I am just a terrible son.\u201dHe shook his head at my reply.\u201cIf you say so, this old man who couldn\u2019t protect the queen majesty should have already bitten his tongue and died.\u201dI smiled at his words. Unlike my father, who gave up everything after my mother\u2019s death, he, who volunteered as my mother\u2019s knight in the past, seemed to have secretly searched for evidence behind my mother\u2019s assassination. I found it out when I snuck into his house, which made me feel grateful towards him.\u2018So please, shake all the nobles who are eating up the country.\u2019When I saw him without speaking, he looked at me as if I was his grandson.\u2018I will deliver the final blow.\u2019\u201cIf you are in trouble, please feel free to contact me. I\u2019ll help you as much as I can.\u201d\u201cAs a person keeping a neutral stance, if you look after me, the nobles will be outraged. You don\u2019t want this little boy to die, right?\u201dWhen I said jokingly, he laughed.\u201cIf I don\u2019t do that, the life and oath of this sinful old man will be a lie.\u201dHe said bitterly as if whipping the guilt he held.\u201cI\u2019m going to turn the land into a place where people live. It\u2019s not difficult.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cSo please do your job well here, Marquis.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI smiled at him.\u201cYou will be busy soon.\u201dAs if he didn\u2019t understand what I was saying, he remained silent for a long time.* * *After flying up to the neighboring province with the mana gate, I was on the move all day. It wasn\u2019t that bad because Hines was quite close to the capital. If it were elsewhere, it would have taken a few more days.-I thought you were the only one who had enemies in the palace, but that wasn\u2019t true.When did she wake up? Perserk floated in front of me as I read a book in the carriage. She, lightly dressed like a demon, looked down and giggled at me from a height where I could see her underwear if she moved a little by mistake.-There are some vital people like that.\u201cBecause Marquis Patelis was my mother\u2019s knight. However, it is only recently that I got to know about him. So I don\u2019t know him that well.\u201d-By the way, you handled the information well.\u201cAt least it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s the only loyal person in this country.\u201dShe giggled at my words, waving her hand in the air. Then the window of the carriage opened smoothly, and the dried-up lands began to appear.-It feels like something is blocking the atmosphere here.\u201cRight, I feel the same.\u201dThe Hines territory itself was pretty big. Nevertheless, this manor became abandoned because more than ninety percent of the landmass was suffering from drought as if it were cursed. There was no way to know the exact reason yet, but everything would weather and turn into a desert if it continued a little longer.Among the inland regions, few lands were so barren like this. It was the only land in the Al Rown kingdom that was suffering from drought. The wasteland, which was seen outside the window, was initially agricultural, but the soil dried up and cracked as the drought continued. Fortunately, the government had hired some wizards to conjure water several times. If not, it would have been much worse.Hiring wizards to spray water over a large amount of land wouldn\u2019t solve the problem with a small budget such as ours, though.\u201cMajesty, I am sorry, but we should stop and stay somewhere around here for tonight.\u201dI nodded quietly at chamberlain Ferrum\u2019s suggestion.\u201cWe have no other choice because there is no private lodging nearby. Get ready for camping.\u201d\u201cYes, Majesty.\u201dAfter watching the chamberlains, maids, and escort knights move busily, I left the carriage, leaving Amy behind.-Dry air. Sandy wind.I strolled while looking at the block of land that looked like a desert. Although it was a large amount of land, not much of it was useful. When I walked far away from the carriage on the only paved road, all I could see was dried-up earth all over the place. I silently reached out my hand and touched the cracked ground. Then I closed my eyes and whispered.-Checking Information.Perserk\u2019s insight was a unique ability infused with the will of God, and the subject wasn\u2019t limited to living creatures.Beep!There was a faint light in her eyes as a simultaneous mechanical sound flowed out in the air. At this moment, a strange transparent status window began to appear out of the air.-Region: Hines Manor.-Earth condition: Lowest-Special comments:Due to a prolonged drought and a strange power, the earth is dead, and the ground is dried up.It is showing signs of a curse (?): dead earth, climate change.It seems possible to remove the curse (?).-Was it a curse?\u201cI have to get rid of it. Rather, why do you have so many question marks like this in the status window of God\u2019s will?\u201dI felt strange.16. The lord is cleaning.-I can\u2019t answer your question.\u201cBut it\u2019s your ability.\u201d-I am only able to show. You probably know that the contents in the window aren\u2019t mine but the will of a God with a cheap taste.As a Demon King, she had no faith in God.-So you don\u2019t like them?\u201cWell\u2026I am not in a position to say since I am borrowing the divine power of God, but I cannot deny that she is a God with a little peculiar taste.\u201d-By the way, as expected, it\u2019s a curse, not something worse.Ignoring Perserk\u2019s joke, I quietly swept the cracked ground with my hands. This was the current situation shown in most of the Hines territory. Except for ten percent of the land, most areas were in the same situation as stated previously by the status window.\u2018The curse that spread out the entire land\u2026\u2019-I\u2019m saying this because you might not understand. There is something called a spread-type curse in the curse tree, a vicious curse activated by an insignificant medium that spreads endlessly.\u201cI didn\u2019t know there were still remnants of black magic left here.\u201d-Looks like one of the residents touched the medium.It seemed that someone among the residents had triggered an unexploded mine. The Hines Manor had gone through that unfortunate event.[Purification]I laid my hand on the ground silently and raised my divine power. It was cleaning magic that was raised to the third rank.Paaching!!Even though it said removing the curse was possible in the status window, it seemed complicated.\u201cLook at this.\u201dA smile caught on the corner of my mouth. If I used the purification magic without any intention, it might seem that I wasn\u2019t able to absorb the powerful repulsive force, which repelled my divine magic.Fifth Tier [Purification]The characteristic of purification magic, which boasted one axis of divine magic, could be used by first-class priests. And, depending on the individual\u2019s capacity, they could rise to the eighth tier. If it didn\u2019t work with the third-tier purification magic, I had to raise it a few steps.Kaaching!!Once again, you could hear the sound of something breaking. It seemed that the magic bounced back again, but the result was a little different.Pushhkkk\u2026The colorless, odorless smoke slowly began to flow out of the area I had touched. The curse was scattered for a moment but recovered again.-A curse that has been around for a long time cannot be removed so easily.\u201cThat is true.\u201dI have to find the medium and destroy it; otherwise, I couldn\u2019t remove the curse. Without doing that, it was like shoveling snow in the middle of heavy snowfall. I quietly returned to the carriage and leaned on the fluffy sofa, closing my eyes.\u201cThis is how most of the land is like.\u201dBlack magic, especially large-scale curses like this, mainly went extinct a long time ago. To be precise, we had very little information about the different species on the continent now, and it was safe to assume that a few black wizards once shook the continent.-As it was in the past, the world has remained essentially unchanged.As I listened to Perserk\u2019s voice, I slowly closed my eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As such, it was impossible to surround everything with a wall, so basically, only some areas surrounding the Lord\u2019s manor house were surrounded by a wall, and the rest were maintained as open land.\u201cIt is a great manor.\u201d-It was poorly maintained, though.Was it because it was an old and underdeveloped manor? Some of the fortress walls surrounding the inner manor were weathered, making it impossible to recognize their original shape, and the grass was growing rampant over it. The gate, which should have been firmly closed, had already been long battered beyond usefulness.-You should be glad that at least there is someone who keeps the gate closed.\u201cIt\u2019s an area adjacent to the large forest where monsters live, and the manor wouldn\u2019t have survived without volunteer watchmen.\u201d\u201cStop! From here and forward, it\u2019s the Hines manor! Please show your ID card!\u201d\u201cThis is Prince Davey, who was appointed to be the Lord of this manor! Open the gate!\u201dThe old gentleman, who took the lead on a horse, shouted sternly before anyone came forward. It seemed that they soon noticed that it wasn\u2019t a precious procession that had graced them.\u201cP\u2026Please wait a moment. I should get Director\u2026\u201d\u201cHey! Are you going to make the Prince Majesty wait?!\u201d\u201cStop, we have to go through the process. I am not officially delegated the authority of the manor yet.\u201dIt was true that the royal order delegates the authority of the province, but when the Lord was absent, the deputy manor manager took over. In this system, a nobleman, and appointed lord, had to take over from the manor manager to be inaugurated as an official lord.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too uptight. We\u2019ll all become family.\u201dAs I got off the carriage, he nodded.\u201cP\u2026Please forgive me for being rude. Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I see the sun of the kingdom.\u201dI\u2019m not sure how he knew I was the prince, maybe because of my fabulous appearance? When the guards realized I was the prince who would become the Lord described by the old gentleman, they laid down on the ground.\u201cYou should get up. If you lay down on the ground, who is going to keep the gate?\u201dAs I spoke, the two guards were taken aback.\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cThe volunteers are good. However, why is the manor house in this state?\u201dThey exchanged glances when I asked calmly. It was that moment a middle-aged man wearing light gloves was running from the inside wall.\u201cD\u2026Director!\u201d\u201cW\u2026Welcome, Prince Majesty! I received the message, but I apologize for being late. Please kill me!\u201dI focused my gaze on the guy, who was lying flat on his stomach and trembling. Now I saw the strange traces. Monster attack. There were signs that there was a monster attack within the last day. Somehow the atmosphere was cluttered.\u201cWhen did the messenger arrive here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2026It was two days ago.\u201d\u201cWhen did the monster attack happen after that?\u201d\u201cW\u2026well\u2026 H\u2026How did you know that\u2026?\u201dI smiled at him, who looked at me in surprise.\u201cLooking at the traces of blood, it must be a recent attack. If it was an urgent situation, your judgment was right.\u201d\u201cY\u2026Your Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is the point of this dreary procedure? First of all, I\u2019ll go in and hear more details.\u201dHe looked up at me as if surprised by my words.\u201cAlso, please bring the internal affairs deputy manor manager.\u201dHe, who had been frightened, sighed and lowered his head as though his life had been cut short by ten years.* * *When Hercules taught me the art of survival, the ability to observe was the first lesson he imparted. I didn\u2019t realize it from afar, but I noticed bloodstains on the walls and some weapons which had been broken and couldn\u2019t be retrieved in time. Despite the absence of bodies, the dark bloodstains were visible. I could even smell it.How did I smell it? I could amplify my senses even though I hadn\u2019t undergone a metamorphosis. It was because I acquired a master-class body after the manifestation of God. They seem shocked that I found the remnants. What was wrong with them? It was a simple ability that everyone at my level had.-At times, you tend to forget how ridiculous your talent is. I\u2019m sorry, but you sound like a jerk to me. Those who lack talent, even at your rank, would miss such a hint.\u2018Did I say anything like that?\u2019-Even if you didn\u2019t say, I knew. I wonder if hitting your head once is okay.\u201cI, Montmort, was in charge of the province\u2019s military force by acting as the volunteer commander in the absence of the lord.\u201d\u201cWhere is the manor manager?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026is\u2026\u201dHe hesitated and then lowered his head again.\u201cS-someone else was in charge before the recent assault, but since then\u2026I\u2019ve been in charge.\u201dHe was the only one in charge of both internal affairs and the volunteers. He didn\u2019t seem to be overly selfish, but he was a man of exceptional talent.-If you hire that kind of person, it will undoubtedly benefit you.\u2018I can trust his abilities since he has kept the dying manor over the past five years.\u2019He rolled his eyes back and forth with an anxious face as I sat quietly; he was scared. He looked worried if I would become mad due to the condition of the manor, or the manor house, which was all worn out. I, on the other hand, maintained a dignified demeanor while appearing worried.\u201cI know you\u2019ve had a difficult time.\u201dAs I entered this town, I saw the broken houses and their inhabitants. To be clear, they didn\u2019t seem to be excited at the arrival of the new Lord. It was, in some ways, a natural reaction. It was common for the nobles to bully the commoners in the current state of the Al Rown kingdom. Maybe he was scared for that reason, but it was no good if he was already scared.As I pondered this, I looked at Montmort, the middle-aged man who stood in front of me.\u201cTo manage the manor, you would have to know how to read?\u201d\u201cEven though I\u2019m a lowly guy, I learned to write by looking over other\u2019s shoulders a little.\u201d\u2018It seems that I have discovered a talent.\u2019I was quite impressed.\u201cSo\u2026now, since your majesty is here\u2026\u201d\u201cI want you to keep working.\u201d\u201cP-pardon me?\u201d\u201cNot as a volunteer corps. I\u2019ll promote it to the manor\u2019s official guard and establish a formal organization. Sir Berman, who used to be a guard here, will assist with the training.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll do what you say.\u201d\u201cY\u2026you want me to do that?!\u201dHe looked up at me, shocked.\u201cThen who else is going to do that? I\u2019ll employ you as a knight and give you a title if your ability improves. I have the power to do so.\u201dAs I replied, I flung my ear wax into the air in response to his question.\u201cB\u2026but I am a lowly man\u2026\u201d\u201cIf someone is skilled, I hire them. That\u2019s my philosophy.\u201dHe seemed surprised by my comments.* * *It was an assault by goblins. There were about a hundred of them. Their bodies were the size of a child\u2019s, their intelligence was poor, and their physique was small, so they had only child-like strength. The only thing they had in their favor was their prodigious fertility. Regardless of the species, even if you killed indefinitely, the number of them didn\u2019t decrease.That\u2019s why a goblin-infested manor was so irritating. It was challenging to adapt to them since they were nocturnal monsters. They were previously known for living in the mountains and sometimes appearing to steal animals, children, or women from people\u2019s homes, but this was the first time such a large group appeared.With this size, he couldn\u2019t understand why they hadn\u2019t been conquered by the orcs who lived in the same mountain, who refer to themselves as warriors. As the range of desolation of the manor spread to the forest, their attack cycle became more frequent. The elders in the manor said that this was due to the earth\u2019s curse, but Montmort didn\u2019t believe them.Meanwhile, someone from the royal palace arrived. In a somewhat arrogant manner, an official from the royal palace came down and told him, who managed the volunteers and the estate, that the first prince of the Kingdom would be named Lord here, and then he left immediately. He didn\u2019t seem to want to remain in this remote area any longer. Montmort was a commoner who despised the aristocracy.He learned to write at a beginner level from his father, but he despised all nobles except Baron Alisha, who had previously ruled the manor. To him, nobles were arrogant and were overly manipulative. Now what? There was going to be a royal prince. If it\u2019s a prince of the damn Kingdom, what else was there to say?That\u2019s what he was thinking. It\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t break his neck in anger over this manor\u2019s predicament.He was scared, but he didn\u2019t want to be overwhelmed. The more troubling aspect was that he couldn\u2019t imagine such a man abusing his authority in his hometown, which was in jeopardy. Meanwhile, the goblins attacked again. This time, there were almost a hundred fifty goblins in the raid. It\u2019s impossible to say where this influx of heads came from, but it seemed as if all the goblins in the vicinity of the Hines manor had gathered.No matter how well-trained the volunteers were, they would eventually incur fatigue from the constant battles. In reality, it was a known fact that some residents were abducted by fleeing goblins. Defeat was obvious, and they pillaged their possessions.The gloomy residents seemed dissatisfied that the government didn\u2019t intervene to defend them. It had been ten years since the Kingdom\u2019s assistance was withdrawn. The previous Lord, Baron Alisha, died a long time ago. On top of that, now they had to deal with a prince.The prince seemed to be a small child who hadn\u2019t yet seen half of what they had. According to the kingdom\u2019s laws, citizens became adults at the age of sixteen, but maturity generally occurred at twenty or older. In other words, he was much too young. Young nobles were very arrogant. Furthermore, as a prince who has spent his whole life in the royal house, he couldn\u2019t have a wide range of experiences.Montmort\u2019s head felt dizzy just thinking about how the prince was going to annoy him. However, instead, he casually found the traces of their war and praised them for their effort. Montmort thought he was lying at first, but he looked confident. As if he knew what he was doing. With a blank expression on Montmort\u2019s face, he looked up at the prince.For some reason, his eyes and mannerisms gave the impression that he already knew everything. It was an odd instinct not to lie in front of him. Even though the journey would have been exhausting, he summoned the workers to verify the manor\u2019s condition, so we confessed the truth. He stood up and responded casually after hearing out the entire story.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s clean up the goblins until I remove the curse of the wasteland.\u201dAlthough he had been told there were hundreds of goblins, he sounded like he was dusting a kitchen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is this to imply that the goblins entered the manor house?\u201d\u201cY-you are right.\u201d\u201cWhy was the defense broken?\u201dEven though there were many goblins, we had a fortress. So how did they break through? It was just a concern, not an attempt to criticize him. However, he seemed to grow awkward at my question for some reason.\u201cI am not criticizing you. We will solve the problems of this manor one by one in the future, based on your experiences and memories.He was taken aback by my words. It was true for those newly named lords to assign vital roles to their loyal servants. Occasionally, there were cases like his, but, overall, it was common for those in his position to find themselves in a dangerous situation when the management changed.\u201cThat\u2026that is\u2026the volunteers were tired and wounded as a result of the ongoing attack\u2026\u201d\u201cHow bad is the damage?\u201d\u201cDozens of residential houses were burned. A lot of people were kidnapped\u2026\u201dAs he was muttering resentfully, I rubbed my chin.\u201cHow are the manor\u2019s internal affairs?\u201dThe most important thing was this. I would have paid more attention to this if it hadn\u2019t been for the goblin assaults rather than the reinforcement of the units. Any manors in jeopardy must be dealt with caution.\u201cThat is, there is enough food to last until the end of the winter\u2026to tell you the truth, this year\u2019s farming was a failure\u2026\u201d-Even if you don\u2019t count all the repairs to the walls and the manor house and services, the wealth received from the royal palace will barely last two years.Perserk grinned as soon as she realized which part I was looking for. Whoa, you have a beautiful smile. Is it possible for you to be my secretary?-I refuse.She laughed peacefully and laid down on my thighs in the chair.-It is already time to go to bed\u2026hmm\u2026As she dozed off, I chuckled.\u201cIt would be better if you get them.\u201dMontmort stared at me as I muttered and pondered. He looked doubtful at me, as his name implied. I took small bags from my clothing and gave them to him. After I handed over three fist-sized sacks, he opened his eyes wide.And he was once again amazed by the contents.\u201cPlat-platinum coins!!\u201dPlatinum coins. It was the highest currency with the value of fifty gold coins. Although the number of coins was small, the size of the coins was much greater than that of ordinary gold.\u201cSir Pallis and Sir Horton should accompany him. If you want, you can take a volunteer member. Put my name on the receipt and buy food and supplies. That way, we can buy enough food and supplies that will last for a while.\u201dSince there were only two hundred residents at most, it was possible.\u201cYour Majesty, how could you give such a\u2026.\u201dNot only Montmort but also the others who were here to assist me looked astonished. As far as they saw it, I wasn\u2019t the kind of person who could afford such a large sum of money.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me where I got them. Because I earned that money fairly.\u201dYes, I earned them. It was the money I earned as a good thief by robbing the Information Guild.-There is no such thing as a good thief in the first place\u2026\u2018You are too noisy.\u2019She had a knack for responding while she was supposedly sleeping. They must have been furious when they later discovered they had been robbed of both money and information. Well, it was too late to do anything about it now anyway. They looked perplexed as I spoke but then looked down as if their doubts had been disappeared.\u201cIf you ask me, I will follow him.\u201dIt was Chamberlain Bernil, who was in charge of the First Prince\u2019s Palace. He was related to Vespers, the royal palace\u2019s head butler, and King Crianes\u2019 right-hand man. Their appearances were strikingly similar.\u201cYes, it would be better if Chamberlain Bernil followed.\u201d\u201cIn three days, we will return with the items that you requested.\u201dAt those words, I got up from my seat.\u201cThen, let\u2019s sort things out right away. The faster lives are saved, the better. Summon all the remaining knights and volunteers except for the minimum number of people who will protect the manor. Amy, lead the maids to clean the manor house.\u201dI will be back after taking care of the outside business. They stared at me blankly for a moment as I stood up, as if I wouldn\u2019t listen to their opinions, then followed me as they realized the situation.* * *As expected, they were full of distrust.Excluding the minimum number of defense personnel, the number of volunteers in the province was only twenty. It was even surprising that there were still close to thirty volunteers in the territory where most young people had already left. There were eight knights, which was a significant strength against the goblins, but given the level of the volunteers, who were pawns of the rabble, it was similar to suicide.There were precisely one hundred and fifty goblins to deal with. With conventional tactics, the power gap was much too large and risky.-Hmm\u2026you want to make life as simple as possible; however, the numbers will change. If you look at the current situation, it is more than one hundred fifty. If it reaches two hundred\u2026\u2018No, one hundred fifty goblins is right.\u2019I would block any goblins above them. Berserk, who was making a sleepy expression, shut her mouth as if she realized what I was saying.-Sometimes I like you because you\u2019re wild.\u201cThank you, everyone, for gathering. Everyone is probably seeing me for the first time. I am Davey Al Rown. I was appointed as the lord of this manor.\u201dI stepped up on the platform and looked at them. Their information was listed before me, but no one seemed to have the same outstanding potential as Montmort.\u201cAs you may already know, some residents were kidnapped by goblins last night.\u201dAs I said, they were upset, and I could hear them muttering in the crowd.\u201cI know there are some people who may want to find them right away. Or some people may be too scared and want to hide.\u201dThe silence continued.\u201cBut whatever it is, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they will continue to attack the manor if we leave it as it is.\u201dEveryone was silent at my calm voice. They looked full of disbelief, but no one opened their mouth easily. I was giving them a lot of pressure in the first place.\u201cAlthough I just arrived here, I don\u2019t think the fact that I\u2019m a lord has changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know you, but I have no intention of tolerating intruders entering my property. I don\u2019t have the patience to wait for those who believe they can stick their swords in my manor and walk away with their limbs intact.\u201dAt my words, they looked troubled. They knew. Even if they want to bring back their family and avenge them, they would be in danger if they pursued. It would be difficult to find them in the forest, which was like their front yard. Even goblins held an advantage on home ground.\u201cB\u2026but dealing with them with our force is like\u2026\u201d\u201cSuicide!\u201dOf course, I could hear the volunteers\u2019 shouts full of disbelief at me as they thought the same thing. There were young boys and old men who seemed to be in danger just holding their swords. The age group wasn\u2019t consistent, which hinted at a lack of people.\u201cSo, should we let them keep invading?\u201dAt my words, they went silent. Then, they looked into each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cWe do understand what the Lord is trying to say\u2026but we are the last volunteers left in this manor\u2026if we die, who is going to protect the manor?\u201d\u201cThat is right! Goblins are very hostile to their enemies! If we fail, they will attack this place again!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going with you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dAt my words, their expressions dropped. Some of them gave me scoffing looks. Of course, it was normal to think of me as a prince who lacked experience, only believing in his young blood as he acts recklessly. They didn\u2019t have to say anything since it was visible in their status windows that appeared in front of me. I sensed the reality when they looked at each other, muttering, \u2018Now we\u2019re all dead.\u2019The knights tried to stop their rude behavior right away, but I restrained them with my arm.\u201cI know what you are worried about, but I\u2019d like to correct one thing.\u201dThey, who were confused by my words, stared at me.\u201cI am not here as a prince but as the appointed Lord of Hines manor. And you guys are my residents, whether you like it or not. Now, we have become one family. Do you think I\u2019ll let my family be killed?\u201dAt my words, the crowd quieted once more.\u201cI swear with my Stigmata. Believe and follow me. I\u2019ll make sure that no one dies and to eradicate them.\u201dIf I had wanted to, I could have gone alone and gotten rid of them. But I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted to see their determination and skills.\u201cIs it hard to believe me? If so, believe in God\u2019s mark, the Stigmata that God gave me. If you still don\u2019t believe me, follow me as if I were a lord oppressing you.\u201dEveryone was silent at my words. No matter how blinded from the outside world they were, it seemed that they had understood by this point that I was the prince with the Stigmata.\u201cMy life is the most important thing to me. And yours is important too because your job is to protect me. Don\u2019t ever think about dying without my permission.The room was momentarily frozen when I unleashed an overwhelming fighting spirit. People tend to misunderstand the air that pressures the whole body as charisma. They looked surprised at my decisive voice.* * *The massive forest near the Hines manor was originally a quiet forest where only wild animals lived. It was the forest where the residents frequently came to hunt. Although a few orcs had been found in the past, they had little interest in humans. But what happened this time was that the goblins began to be discovered more frequently, and the situation had grown worse.As a result, hunting in the forest became impossible.\u201cWe\u2019ve already tracked down the goblins\u2019 home village.\u201dThe eldest volunteer, Corris, spoke on behalf of the volunteer leader, Montmort, bowing his head to me.\u201cThere are a lot of goblins if we travel across this ridge in front of us.\u201dIt was exactly as he had said. A small village started to appear not far away as we moved silently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the orcs\u2019 construction technology and design. To the orcs, those who called themselves warriors, goblins were their enemies. But how come there were goblins in the orc\u2019s village?\u201d\u201cIt was a village without an owner. A watchman told me that they were gathering here recently.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear, but fortunately, it seemed to be true. The number was about one hundred fifty as expected. Even though many were killed in the raid, it seemed that their numbers had been replenished. In other words, it means that they weren\u2019t just here but also exist somewhere else. The people who were kidnapped by goblins weren\u2019t in sight. Maybe they were being held in the dilapidated buildings of the village.\u201cThey kidnapped Lini\u2026\u201dWhen I turned my head to the sound of the muttering, one of the volunteers was glowering with bloody eyes as if he were going to shed red tears right away. He was trying so hard to push down his urge to jump in right now because of the atmosphere.\u201cAre you angry?\u201dSo, when I looked at him calmly, he clenched his teeth and nodded vigorously. This time, I looked at the entire volunteer squad.\u201cDo you want to kill them?\u201dMy calm voice spreads to everyone like a wave.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI want revenge!\u201dThe other volunteers nodded and loudly responded. They seemed to be on the verge of swinging the shabby weapons they armed themselves with. I felt that the people here had good spirits. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be angry with those who weren\u2019t their family members.\u201cI guess I chose a good manor.\u201dI smiled. After that, I lifted the bow in my hand and put an arrow on the bowstring. Then I closed my eyes and raised my mana. My first actual battle as a lord came quicker than expected.* * *\u2018Strengthened shot.\u2019By the appearance, it just looked like I was pulling an arrow in a twisted position. It looked sloppy on the outside, but it was a skilled shot. I was the one who absorbed all the skills of Apollo, the god of archery. Despite his cheesy personality, he possessed exceptional archery skills. As a result, the technique that I learned wasn\u2019t at all typical. The knights\u2019 eyes widened as they were taken aback when I unexpectedly pulled the bow. What I was trying to do was the standard tactic. It must have looked like that in their eyes.\u201cL\u2026Lord?!\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work with standard tactics!\u201dThey probably thought that it was ridiculous. If goblins trapped you in such a wide area, it would result in a lot of casualties. Given the number of goblins in the village and the volunteer\u2019s current state, significant losses or annihilation were more probable. They would have initially thought I would reduce their numbers by setting up appropriate traps or guerrilla warfare. I even promised that no one would die with my leadership.However, I had no intention of using such a slow method in cleaning them up. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was afraid of dust.\u201cDo not forget. I mean not for a single person to be killed.\u201dWith a smile, I gently twisted the bow and released it.Bam!!With the sound of air bouncing, a sharp arrow flew into the air.Thud!-Kieeek!!-Ahhh!!The arrow that flew instantly broke the bones of a goblin holding a bent club. As they learned of their colleague\u2019s death, the goblins let out strange cries that shook the whole village as well as the surrounding forest. It was a peculiar cry, no matter how I heard it. When they discovered me standing leisurely with arrows by my side, the goblins gathered and exploded in rage with a violent scream. It looked like a swarm of bees popping out of a beehive when someone touched it. The volunteers looked overwhelmed by the air of their menace, their faces turning pale.What the hell was this kid doing?! They didn\u2019t say that, but I\u2019m sure that was what they were probably thinking now. I immediately pull an arrow on the bowstring and raised my divine power. Then I put strength in my throat. Watch your lord and see how amazing he is.\u201cI will commend you for the first time as your lord and family.\u201dI looked back at them in breathtaking silence.\u201cEveryone!!!\u201dI grabbed their attention. With that word, the Stigmata in my back began to glow.[Hard Skin][Strength][Agility][Vital Pump][Mana Shield][High Blessing]Strengthening the skin, strengthening their muscles, increasing agility, increasing stamina, magic defense, and enhancing overall capability.The pure white light that spread out in a circle starting from where I was standing became various buff spells and began to wrap them. Not just one or two, but to everyone who gathered here. Although it was just light buff magic, the effectiveness was incredible when someone could forcibly raise other\u2019s levels.Suddenly, countless buff spells flew around my body, and then wrapped around them as well. They were amazed. Along with a strange light, their body started overflowing with power. Were they already surprised? I wasn\u2019t finished yet. As I spread the continuous white light, my will, which comprised of divine power, was further manifested.-You. Are you going to use all of it?Since I already started, let me finish my cosplay as a genius saint because they don\u2019t even know what kind of magic this is anyway.[Divine Protection][Renovathio][Reinforce the Mind]Upper-level defense, increasing health recovery rate, and strengthening mentality. This might have been enough, but I gave them an even bigger service.[Saint Gloria]Buff efficiency amplification area spell.When [Saint Gloria], a buff-amplifying magic of the sixth tier, appeared, the golden glow of light encircled us, and their bodies began to grow even lighter. With this spell, even the general public could perform expert-level skills under certain conditions.\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my gosh\u2026\u201dCurrently, the divine magic that I could cast was of the upper sixth tier, considering the case of artifacts. It was a divine enhancement buff from level one to level two and even level three, but the effect was incomparable when you raised the levels. Even paladins in Valshas, the headquarters of God\u2019s order in the mainland, wouldn\u2019t lavishly use it like this.Unlike other magic or black magic, divine magic was the most challenging magic to acquire. It would be enough to bring out the seventh tier if they were a saint or a pope. The volunteers and knights who instinctively realized that they had become something more from the buffs looked astonished by the strange power overflowing within their bodies. They seemed to feel the sensation gradually swelling up inside.Those who previously seemed enraged by my reckless behavior looked at me with impressed eyes. I responded with a silent smile and inhaled a quick breath again in response to their reaction. Belief, or something like that, was essential to boost morale.\u201cI will let you release all the anger accumulated in yourself!!\u201dThis fight was important to them, who were exhausted from the continuous raids. For those who were exhausted, nothing was better than confidence as a stimulant.\u2018Oh, I wanted to do this at least once in my lifetime.\u2019\u2013 What are you talking about?You became stronger! Charge in!-\u2026The volunteers of the manor have been looking for chances to avenge the goblins\u2019 attack that happened previously. They regarded the buffs I gave them as just mysterious magic, but the power overflowing from their body was strong enough to give them the confidence to relish the moment.-Shriek!-Scream!Otherwise, there\u2019s no way they could make expressions filled with excitement even when they saw the group of deadly goblins.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cSweep them away!!\u201dOur headcount was only a third of theirs. It seemed to be a significant difference on the surface. Still, on the contrary, it was possible to handle the goblins without difficulty if each person handled three.Did they say that in martial law? If the number was more than three times as many, you should never use the standard tactics. In a way, it didn\u2019t matter because this wasn\u2019t a standard tactic. It was a fight between a human and a goblin with a different specification. The fight between the injured volunteers and goblins was tied at first, but the balance of the fight soon collapsed because of the divine magic I used.\u201cAhhhhhhhhh!\u201dI pulled my bow again as I watched them screaming with crude weapons. Then I briefly blinked. As the mana was circulating inside my eyes, the goblins\u2019 heads from beyond appeared in my sights instantly.[Lock-on]While muttering lightly, I prepared another strengthened shot. I aimed my arrowhead and immediately released the bowstring. It hit the nape of the goblin\u2019s neck, who was screaming wild.Boom!With the sound of the bowstring cutting through the air, another goblin screamed and fell.Bam!The goblins collided with the knights and volunteers running in the front row.\u201cYou beasts!\u201d-Shriek!They had a faster body than imagined, as well as improved muscle strength and boundless confidence. The aftermath began to spread out of control after a volunteer lightly struck his sword and blew a goblin\u2019s head off.\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u2026\u201dIt was usually impossible to cleave through a neck with a single sword so neatly, even though they were goblins with weaker physical strength than humans. Only knights could do so with professional training as they had physical and technical skills, but certainly not these poorly trained volunteers. Yet, such a phenomenon was happening.\u201cWe can win!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be scared!\u201d\u201cThe Lord is with us!\u201dThe confidence showed on their faces when they realized the change in their body; the war situation quickly turned into a one-sided attack rather than a battle. Of course, there was always someone who overdid it with extreme confidence.\u201cOuch!\u201dWhen they acted hastily, it could cancel the mana shield and instantly damage the volunteer. If I ignore the situation, it might cause one or two serious injuries. Of course, I had no intention of leaving it like that.[Heal]Level one simple recovery magic. However, the higher the level, the more effective it would be.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe wound\u2026\u201dAs the wounds on his body were engulfed in warm light and healed in an instant, he looked up at me with a surprised face. Instead of responding to his stare, I shot another arrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay37\u201cDivine magic isn\u2019t invincible. I said I wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to die, so you\u2019d better focus!\u201dAt my words, they took a deep breath as if they shook off their unnecessary worries. They seemed to finally recognize that the frail-looking boy who had come to their town as their lord.\u201cKeep in mind. I will give you a hard time if you get injured once we return to the manor.\u201dEven though my threatening voice could have made them rebellious\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s live up to the expectations of the lord!\u201d\u201cSweep them away!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t miss this opportunity! Destroy their heads!\u201dThe volunteers seemed like they weren\u2019t interested in such a thing. Do they know that their amplified morale, like a berserker\u2019s madness, turned the goblins\u2019 faces pale in fear? It was a standard tactic that seemed unfavorable at first, but the number of goblins quickly decreased. It must have driven the goblins crazy.They might not have ever seen humans with strange lights on their bodies in their lifetime. It made them hard to fight because of their light. Even if they stabbed them and made a scar somehow, the white light healed their foe\u2019s body. Their instincts may already be yelling to them that something was wrong.What was the point now? It was already too late.-Graahhghaa!-Shriek!The goblins, feeling the fear of death, began to run away one by one, but the volunteers who were already on a roll didn\u2019t leave the fleeing ones alone. The one-sided attack didn\u2019t last long. The volunteers accumulated a lot of resentment, wielding weapons like crazy without giving them a chance to run away. Eventually, one of the last goblins who had fled got shot by my arrow and fell to the floor, declaring the end of the slaughter.Momentarily, silence descended upon the killing fields. However, one of the volunteers, who had forgotten to breathe, shuddered and held both his hands up.\u201cWe\u2026we won!\u201d\u201cWe won!\u201d\u201cWhooaahhhhhh!\u201dThe contagious atmosphere quickly spread as if they saved the world.\u201cHooray for the lord!\u201d\u201cThe saint is with us!\u201dI couldn\u2019t get used to it when I heard someone throwing around cheesy comments without hesitation.-Expression management isn\u2019t working.\u2018Look at my fingers if they are fine.\u2019-Your fingers and toes won\u2019t shrink by the laws of physics.While Perserk said that, she also looked a little uncomfortable, as her facial expression was uneasy. As I watched them continuously cheering my name, I didn\u2019t feel like the awkward feeling would go away. Therefore, I had to disperse the atmosphere by reminding them of something they had forgotten.\u201cWhat the hell are you guys doing? There are residents still locked up!! Move fast!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cGo!\u201dEven with my high-handed voice, the blind faith had already been engraved on their faces. They looked fanatic. A carrot and a stick\u2026 all I wanted to do was instill a sense of repulsion and awe in moderation, but they were only shouting for their lord. I felt anxious that I had made the wrong choice.17. It\u2019s raining outside!The number of residents was around two hundred. With the number of volunteers and knights combined, there were about thirty to forty people. Considering the number of residents, the ratio of volunteers was relatively high. From a young boy to a middle-aged man, everyone took up weapons to protect the manor. They had not trained correctly, and their equipment wasn\u2019t satisfactory due to a lack of skills and funds.On top of that, the goblins started looting. It was impressive that they had held on so far.\u201cI found them!\u201dAs I walked into the village while checking the bodies of the goblins, a volunteer rushed to my side. It was the boy who showed furious anger towards the goblins.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYep!\u201dHis glance filled with disbelief at first had already disappeared. I think my trick worked, but it wasn\u2019t good if they became addicted. I got up calmly and went into the artificial cave where he guided me. It seemed to have been used as a food storehouse for the orcs.As I entered the sloppy cave, I saw the volunteers holding weapons and standing in front of some goblins.\u201cAre there more?\u2019-No matter how stupid they are, they could learn a little.There were about ten goblins left. The number was small enough to handle quickly, but they hid behind the residents as hostages and held rusted weapons. They probably stole the weapons when they attacked the manor. Since the weapons weren\u2019t well-maintained, they were rusted, but they looked dangerous enough to hurt.On the contrary, the residents who became hostages were loosely tied up, but they were so injured and exhausted that they couldn\u2019t properly fight back. Fortunately, no one had yet been hurt by the goblins. Regardless of species, these goblins aimed to r*pe female hostages after exhausting them.The kidnap happened the previous night, so they hadn\u2019t assaulted them yet. It was a relief.-It\u2019s unfair. Even if the woman returned safely, they could be shunned by people.\u201cThe mother fuckers\u2026\u201dNo matter how much they were buffed, the volunteers and knights wouldn\u2019t get through fast enough to keep them from hurting the hostages. Because of that, they weren\u2019t able to approach the goblins.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAs I watched the situation, I groaned briefly.\u201cGordon and Freeman, if I signal, cut all of them down.\u201d\u201cLord?\u201dAt my words, two volunteers and everyone else were surprised. The reason we came here and attacked goblins was to save the residents in the first place. However, they were shocked when I said it like hostages didn\u2019t matter. All I did was shrug at those who looked at me in shock.\u201cWhat are you doing? Are you going to stay here all night?\u201d\u201cLord! They are sly, and they have hostages, so we can\u2019t rush in a hurry\u2026\u201d-Huh, huh, they lack faith\u2014unfaithful folks.\u201cI think you misunderstand something.\u201dAt the end of my words, my hand shined again. Hostage?\u201cWhere are the hostages?\u201dAt the end of my words, a pure white light touched the bodies of the weary and injured people and began to protect them like a shell. The goblins who escaped from the deadly battle took hostages here and harassed them, so they must have realized what the light shining from the body of the hostages meant right now. You could tell just by looking at the expressions of those green monsters, whose faces turned blue in fear after realizing.-Ahhhaaa!-Kieeek!I shouted instinctively at the screaming goblins trying to run away.\u201cHow long are you going to wait? Jump in!\u201d\u201cHuh?! Die, you damn bastards!\u201d\u201cI am gonna kill you, fucking rapist!\u201dAt the same time, the volunteers and knights, realizing what I had done, blasted through and stabbed their swords at the goblins. Even if they tried to run away, we were blocking the exit, so eventually, they were forced to flock to the corners and be slaughtered. The last one cried madly as it was slain.It was a very successful ending for rushing in a village of more than a hundred goblins, considering they never made a plan. I calmly took out the blankets that I had prepared, and I approached the people who were being held captive. It would be the first time they saw me.They had severe bruises on their bodies from being beaten up by the goblins, and their expressions revealed they were perplexed as if they didn\u2019t understand what had happened to their bodies, but the bruises were gradually healing under the faint light. Among those, there was a little girl who looked up at me with a blank face. I smiled at her, and I wrapped a blanket around her shoulders.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. We\u2019re here to save you.\u201d[Sobbing.]Tears began to drip from the eyes of the girl, who had a semi-empty expression with a calm smile. As the girl was so scared, she soon started crying in my arms, making the other residents cry out loud as they realized they were safe now.\u201cAll of them are rescued!\u201dA volunteer approached me with a modest salute as I silently patted the girl\u2019s back.\u201cIs that so? Then what are you doing? Let\u2019s go home. Don\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWhen I held the crying girl in my arms silently, the faces of everyone, including the volunteers, turned bright with relief.* * *Was it because it was me, who was newly appointed, that led the volunteers? The volunteers, who were guarding the old fortress with faces full of distrust and anxiety, looked puzzled at the appearance of the punitive expedition, which returned faster than their expectations.\u201cHey! What are you doing? Get rid of the barriers right now!\u201d\u201cThe lord is entering!\u201d\u201cMove fast, you dawdler!\u201dSoon after, at the shout of the volunteers who followed me, they ran out and cleared the barrier, still looking puzzled. They were probably wondering what the hell happened, why they were showing this nonsensical blind faith towards me. I couldn\u2019t tell them anything with my own words, so I kept silent and walked past them.\u201cThere may still be a few more Goblin villages. We\u2019ll clean them up regularly.\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201dDisbelief had now disappeared. As I yelled, the volunteers replied, shouting as if they were doing something for granted. The remaining volunteers who didn\u2019t know the situation only sent confused gazes at the others.\u201cDismissed! We\u2019ll be swamped starting from tomorrow, so I\u2019ll let you regret it if you get caught overdoing things.\u201d\u201cHooray for Lord!\u201d\u201cHooray for the saint!!\u201dAt my cry, the volunteers immediately screamed while holding their arms up, which made the manor residents look at me with a strange gaze. They seemed to think that I was doing some kind of hypnosis, but I did nothing of the sort.-To be honest, what\u2019s the difference between taking drugs and what you did?\u2018You\u2019re too noisy.\u2019Ignoring Perserk giggling at her comments, I quickly left the podium. I was concerned that they were going to make a real pseudo-religion if it stayed like this. It would be okay after a few days; it\u2019s just that they\u2019re unique.It didn\u2019t take long to realize that I was foolish to think that way.* * *So\u2026 it continued when I led the remaining volunteers to erase the lingering distrust within the territory.As soon as the day broke, Amy was asked to investigate the rest of the territory.Only 10 volunteers and three knights were to climb the mountain with me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The lord must be crazy!\u201d\u201cEven if the number of goblins decreases\u2026\u201dThe volunteers that were not there from the day before looked like they couldn\u2019t believe what was going on. It wouldn\u2019t be weird to shout out that it was a vain bluff if one heard it without context. And that\u2019s what they did.\u201cWe found a goblin village ahead. There are about 50 of them.\u201dAfter listening to the report, I turned to the ten volunteers standing behind me. All of their facial expressions were full of distrust and fear. The volunteers, who swept away a large-scale village with me the day before, weren\u2019t here, so the others didn\u2019t seem to trust me easily.\u201cAre you guys scared?\u201dThey were silent at my question. It was hard to believe this. Honestly, if I were in their position, I would have thought that the others had taken a bowl of medicine as a group.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all scared. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u2018Only ten people came to clear up the Goblin\u2019s village. I think it\u2019s right to kill this crazy bastard and run away.\u2019\u201dI didn\u2019t hear an answer, but they all seemed to be thinking the same thing. If it was hard to believe, I had to show them myself.\u201cAs I have said before, I have never allowed anyone to die.\u201dLight begins to flow out with my words. Unlike the knights who realized what I was going to do, the other people\u2019s faces looked surprised. Light started to flow out of my body. Then, after the buff magic settled on them, their distrust disappeared.* * *\u201cWahahahaha! Die, you bastards!\u201d\u201cThe Lord is with us!\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to believe me until a little while ago\u2026\u201dIt felt absurd, but I maintained my composure because I had already seen it once before.\u201cYou bastards! Stick your necks out!\u201d\u201cThe saint is with us!\u201dYeah, since I was cosplaying as a saint, I understood.\u201cGod is with us!\u201d\u201cHa! Take God\u2019s wrath!\u201d\u201cHey, you crazy shits!\u201dIt was absurd when they even uttered remarks that would be considered blasphemy. Were they the ones who looked at me with disbelief because they couldn\u2019t believe me? I felt sorry for Goblins, who ran away and trembled in fear because of the crazy followers. And those followers were the ten volunteers who didn\u2019t even receive systematic training or proper weapons.The time it took to slaughter more than 50 goblins wasn\u2019t that long. If a weapon broke while using it, they could just break their bones with their bare hands. Every one of them was as brave as an extremely fortified warrior! This time, it was hard to kill all of them because I didn\u2019t raise my bow, but since most of them were dead, I didn\u2019t need to catch those that ran away.Rather, it would be better to have them confuse themselves because they would realize how dangerous humans had become. After finishing the village instantly, I felt a sense of fear for a moment as they gathered to me in unison. I think it was worse than before.\u201cLord! Some of them are running away!\u201d\u201cHaha! They\u2019ll never cross Hines again!\u201d\u201cHahahaha! Those losers!\u201dThe scene of them talking made me smile awkwardly. Well, I guess it was a shallow distrust.\u201cWell\u2026well done.\u201dYes, as a volunteer who has to protect your home, it\u2019s good to be loyal. At least they won\u2019t be unhappy with what I\u2019m trying to do. It\u2019s a little shaky, but it\u2019s not bad! I thought so.It\u2019s not bad to take care of your image. So, exactly two days later, as I was inspecting the changes taking place in my estate\u2026\u201cOh\u2026Holy Saint!\u201d\u201cThe saint is here! Clear the way, you bastards!\u201dThe rumors spread fast. Whether these are volunteers or missionary priests\u2026I was beginning to regret the first decision I made.* * *As a lord, it was a success to win the trust of the people who resided in this land. It didn\u2019t matter since it was my estate, and I was in the highest position anyway.Astrea, the conquering king of the Borde, the Paladian Empire, told me every time.[Don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s not livestock that you lead, but free-willed men. You have to make them follow you with their own will. You shouldn\u2019t lead them forcefully.]He taught me harmony and not politics, so I didn\u2019t learn politics as a king in depth, but at least I sympathized with what he said from time to time. It was a small estate with only 200 people, but everything starts from poverty.\u201cFrom a nearby commercial city, Bernille sent me a charter. I heard that the leader of volunteers did a good job, so he had prepared a lot of supplies. That could delay the return date a little\u2026\u201dAmy, who was waiting for my return, was also working as my secretary. It was unusual for a woman to be in this position in the kingdom of Al Rown, but I hired men, women, children, and old people alike as long as they were talented.Amy seemed moved by my appreciation of her worth.\u201cThe rest of the estate documents are here. What else do you need?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s getting late; I want to clean up. Go take a break, stop working.\u201d\u201cStop\u2026working?\u201dShe looked at me with surprise.\u201cWell, how long are you going to wait for me? You can\u2019t even sleep properly.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201dShe tilted her head as if she were a puppy abandoned by her master.\u201cDon\u2019t want to go home?\u201d-You know a lot, but you don\u2019t know how a girl feels.\u2018She had feelings for me?\u2019Perserk sighed as if she found something ridiculous.-It\u2019s not that she has feelings, but it\u2019s hard to explain. Anyway, it\u2019s not right to throw away a child\u2019s heart that wants to help you.Perserk was experienced and wise. After she said that, Amy\u2019s gaze got on her nerves.\u201cWell\u2026Si.. Davey\u2026I can do well! I mean\u2026\u201dI sighed briefly as I watched her fumble her words. I didn\u2019t know that it would come out like this, even though I took care of it in my own way.\u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s nothing we can do now. Instead, I\u2019ll need a lot of your help, so be prepared.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. So take a break for now.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow then.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAs soon as she regained her energy, she left the office. I let out a deep sigh.\u201cI\u2019ve never really paid close attention to her, though.\u201d-Well, it seems that the girl feels quite responsible for you since you saved her life.Ah, that corrupt, low priest\u2019s business. I indeed saved her, but I couldn\u2019t forget that it was only half my intention. I felt guilty for no reason for thinking so. Nodding without a word, Perserk sat lightly on the old desk. Then she squinted, peering through the papers under her butt.\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re thousands of years old, but you still know how to write well.\u201d-I didn\u2019t just play and eat that whole time.She said so and reached out to a document that was much larger than her body and swept it away.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d-Do you want a cold assessment?\u201cFor now.\u201d-If you lift the curse right now, the territory will be back to normal in at least five years. And it\u2019s about 20 years before you make it into the land you want.Her judgment was quite accurate. Lifting the curse on the dying land wouldn\u2019t immediately change everything.\u201cSo that\u2019s just based on your judgment?\u201d-No way. Will you listen to what I think about the land?\u201cI\u2019ll listen.\u201dShe laughed with satisfaction. As she sat down, she reached for a small document and pointed to one across from her. Then the small document came up lightly with a light wind and flew in front of me.\u201cAre you able to deal with physical force?\u201d-It\u2019s possible if I\u2019m controlling just a small force. That\u2019s enough to lift a bit of light stuff like this.Nevertheless, she looked satisfied.-This estate doesn\u2019t have accessible water, so the water supply is a mess. Is that all? The livestock industry has shrunk rapidly in the past few years, while the food stockpile of crops has led to a low deposit of food.She kept going.\u2013 Thanks to a large amount of platinum you got from robbing the capital\u2019s Information Guild, you can endure it for the time being, but it\u2019s a temporary solution. The most serious is also the issue of funding.It was as she said.\u201cThis land has almost no profit.\u201dIt is inevitable to feel extremely underdeveloped compared to other territories.\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of ways.\u201d-I\u2019ll tell me what you think.Her eyes, smiling beautifully, seemed to be full of expectations. I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t checking what was on my mind either. After thousands of years of living, life would be as boring as it gets. It was understandable.\u201cThe good news is that, despite my expectations, the region has quite a few able young people. The first way is to use them by hunting monsters or animals.\u201d\u2013 That\u2019s the worst-case scenario.Even if the government called for the reform of the territory tomorrow, the people\u2019s trust in the territory is not great enough. If you use them for hunting monsters, you could hold out right away, but that\u2019s where growth ends.\u201cThe second option is to produce specialties, but it\u2019s hard unless you solve the situation with the land.\u201d-I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right about that.\u201cFinally, trade. How do we get diamonds with corn?\u201dShe tilted her head at my words.-There\u2019s no reason for another city to trade from here, and there are no items that we can trade anyway.\u201cIf we can\u2019t trade with people, we can trade with the other races. But just in case, let\u2019s look into the territory first.\u201dWe had to try anything we could for now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay39It seemed that it was worthwhile to have this conversation with Perserk all night. As soon as it dawned, I left the citadel and came to a large, abandoned field nearby. I felt a little burdened because I saw the eyes and expectations of the volunteers who saw me on the way out.Even though the air was dry, I felt calm as I looked over the open plains. The chilly air hit my whole body. Although my cold and fire resistance had rarely risen due to the lack of transformation, it wasn\u2019t a problem if I raised my divine power lightly. Have you ever heard of divine fire?\u201cIn the past, this was all farmland.\u201dIt was now a flat land. How useless the land became, as the original owners all gave up ownership and left the land. What do I mean? I mean, this whole place was land without an owner.\u201cOh, I\u2019ve always wanted to own land, but it looks like I\u2019m going to be a huge landowner.\u201dPerserk looked ridiculous as she laughed in vain. She had a unique direction of greed, and if my purpose were to live comfortably, there was a good way of exploiting her.\u201cI don\u2019t like that. People have to live with a conscience.\u201dEven if I couldn\u2019t be proud of the people who taught me, at least I shouldn\u2019t curse them out. Like it or not, one day, many people would know that I inherited their skills. It didn\u2019t matter if it was the skills of heroes who weren\u2019t from Theonis, but some of the heroes who taught me were from this continent.The Sword God, Haris, was a very good example. Above all\u2026\u201cMy purpose is to live as a human being for a long time.\u201dShe remained silent as if she understood the meaning.-You\u2019re\u2026She blurred her words and asked cautiously.\u2013 Was your past life short?\u201cI died before I could do anything.\u201d-That\u2019s a sad life.\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong. On the contrary, I\u2019ve lived in the Corridor for a very long time.\u201d-You\u2019re alive, but you didn\u2019t feel alive. The life you want to see is to share affection with people and live like a human being.She hit the nail on the head harder than I thought.-I wanted the same as you.Her life, which had been at the center of war because of her birth, wouldn\u2019t have been a very good one either. Maybe all she wanted was to live with her stepfather, Haris, in peace. I shook my head because I felt like I was too sentimental.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long it will take to find the medium with normal methods.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t land that was neglected without reason. I had considerable knowledge of curses, so I knew how cumbersome this line of curses was for me now.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to worry about it if we\u2019re going to fix up the sanctuary\u2026.\u201dPurification magic of at least the eighth tier, if not the sanctuary of the ninth tier, was necessary. The level of the curse was considerable, and I didn\u2019t think it would be easy to do it with 5th and 6th tier spells. The problem was that with my current level of divine magic, it would be difficult to reach the 8th tier. It wouldn\u2019t matter if there was a lot of divine power around, but honestly, there couldn\u2019t be another object that had divine power stored on par with Calderas.\u2018I\u2019ll just ask Princess Ileana.\u2019Maybe she\u2019ll take the bait. I think she was very proud of Haris\u2019 sword skills, but if I borrow Calderas with a little help\u2026\u2013 I don\u2019t recommend it.Perserk shook her head, apparently aware of my thoughts.-So, what brings you here?\u201cI need to see more information about the curse.\u201dAfter using information verification on the ground, the only information she could check with her power now was that there was a curse. Then I had no choice but to grasp it on my own.\u201cI was whining about why you haven\u2019t been using it lately.\u201d-Whining?\u201cYou know, a child who screams if he can\u2019t use something.\u201dSpeaking calmly, I kneeled on one knee and put my hand on the dry ground. Then I quietly closed my eyes and expressed my will.\u2018When you have a chance, go wild.\u2019Thanks to the circle that rotated through my blood, I didn\u2019t have to express the power by throwing spells out of my mouth.[Re Fix Curse]Curse rearrangement.-Oh? I\u2019ve never seen this before.That was a matter of course. My black magic teacher [Lo Ayas], the founder of this magic, wasn\u2019t from this continent. It was known as the \u2018C\u2019-language of curse spells! A curse is a high level of magic created by numerous modalities and mana arrangements. That\u2019s why even black magicians had to borrow the power of many artifacts or spend a lot of time on their curses.Then what if I could decipher and interfere with the arrangement? We could figure out the terms of the curse, or if we do well, we could find the medium of the curse. A curse of this level wouldn\u2019t be possible with the modern knowledge of the dark magic on this continent. What I expected was a trace from the days when Daphne and Apollo, who were called the first saints in the past, were alive.I heard that the black wizards tried to overthrow the continent, and there was a big fight; perhaps this curse that spread over the Hines estate was a curse of this was created to decipher and solve a vicious curse, so it wasn\u2019t fair to say that the purpose was completely wrong. In an instant, the commanding mana began to flutter around me and released power, and I began to feel the ringing of a great force.I didn\u2019t want to use it even after I came here because of this. It was at the level of a 5th tier curse spell, and my command mana was a bit of a nutcase with great pride in trying to show off. Anyone who knew how to use or feel mana would quickly notice this cold, dark mana. It was for this reason that I came alone on this deserted field. The hardest power I had ever learned was high-level black magic.Whoo-hoo\u2026Before long, black and white magic began to spread widely over my hands. The curse structure would be the same, so there was no need to find other samples. The size of the widely spread magic circle was about 3-4 meters. In time, the figure changed and began to print out bizarre characters as if they were carved on a huge stone plate.It was as if the programing language was being printed out. The code-like contents were patterns that no one could understand, but they were familiar letters to me.\u201cHmm?\u201dMy eyes darted back and forth, trying to decipher the sequence of curses.\u201cPerserk.\u201d-You must have found something.\u201cIs this even a curse?\u201dMy words put a question in her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s more like a fully automatic greenhouse than a curse.\u201dI had a feeling that there was no more accurate expression than that.* * *Curse magic, which was well-known for its complexity among black magic, was like a sophisticated program. It was magic that maintained a sophisticated arrangement of complex commands. Therefore, it was also the only type of black magic that worked with the Re-Fix Curse spell.Although [Lo Ayas] wasn\u2019t a black wizard from the Theonis continent, the basis of black magic using command mana was the same, so it was still effective. It was a good decision to use the Re-Fix Curse spell to investigate the unidentified phenomenon. Although the traces of black magic remained so severe that the land couldn\u2019t be used for a long time, what did it matter if I revived a corpse or called out the devil if there was no one in the deadland to witness it?\u201c\u2026\u201dPerserk pulled my hair in frustration at my agonizing silence.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me know? I can\u2019t crack that code.\u201dIt took 30 years to learn and apply this decryption method. After getting used to it, I reached the point where I could quickly decipher the content as I saw it, but not Perserk. No matter how much of a genius you were, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to read an unknown block of text. This block of texting, being a programing language.-You mean it\u2019s not a curse?\u201cTechnically, it is a curse; it\u2019s a very vicious one. But from another point of view, it\u2019s also ambiguous.\u201dSaying so, I gently twisted my palm on the ground.Whoosh!At the same time, the window mixed with black and white disappeared, and the remaining lights began to turn into large arrows.\u201cIt looks like there\u2019s one nearby, so let\u2019s check the medium for ourselves.\u201dThe Fortress was located in the eastern part of the vast Hines estate. So I chose one that was placed in the east closest to our position.\u2018No wonder the outer boundaries of the estate were so obvious. They\u2019ve arranged the mediums so that only Hines is covered.\u2019From a quick scan, I successfully found a total of seven places that are believed to have mediums.East, west, north, south, southwest, northwest, and southeast, respectively.Each one sits narrowly on the border of the estate. Since it was a curse spread out in such a huge area, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if there were more than seven mediums.Rather, it was quite sophisticated and efficiently arranged considering the conditions of the terrain. What about other places? I thought it would be better to mobilize volunteer members to check the others, but I couldn\u2019t send people since they might have prepared preventative measures to protect the mediums. If a big accident happened, it could lead to a disaster.\u2018That\u2019s a no-brainer.\u2019It may not be possible, but even if there were a small chance that I met the heroes of the Corridor again, even the slightest chance, how could I tell them that their disciple lived like this. I want to proudly tell them what I\u2019ve done in my life over a drink. I had no intention of sacrificing my followers for any purpose.-I don\u2019t know what\u2019s awaiting us; I recommend you be more prepared.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dIf things get messed up, we\u2019ll have to take out the hidden moves.* * *Following the arrow that guided me, the place I was headed to was a rocky area east of the estate. The dry rocks had a strangely inadequate structure to make their quarries. The only thing there was a magnificent view. It was a good idea to enjoy a picnic while appreciating the scenery. But I didn\u2019t come here to play, so I jumped into a rocky area without any regrets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They did a pretty good job.\u201d-You\u2019re good at keeping me in suspense.\u201cIt was designed to forcibly fix most of the natural phenomena related to climate and geology throughout this land.\u201d-Oh?\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s an unthinkable idea.\u201dPerserk touched her chin as if she thought my words were interesting.-Is the curse the reason why it doesn\u2019t rain here?\u201cSomething like that. The only thing I\u2019ve found in my decoding is the effectiveness of the curse. It maintains certain circumstances.\u201dThe word \u2018maintaining certain circumstances\u2019 came off a little strange, but if it unfolded in a certain area for a long time, it became a very scary and very dangerous curse. Not to mention if it was a particular situation set in malice. Thanks to the fact that everything except temperature remained constant for a long time, the drought continued, and the land was consumed due to the lack of circulation.If it was a function of the curse, it was already doing its job. The creator of this curse probably intended to slowly desiccate the Hines estate here. Now I wonder if the owner was even alive. What if it could be controlled, rearranged, or modified? The earth, climate, temperature. What if we change it so that we can adjust it according to our will?It wouldn\u2019t be strange to call it paradise magic, not a curse. If you maintained warm temperatures and certain precipitation in certain areas, it wasn\u2019t a matter of growing special crops accordingly. Thanks to the medium that controlled the surroundings, I could find mines that hadn\u2019t yet been discovered.Was that all?The temperature is as low as it was now, so even if winter arrived when everyone had to wrap up to stay warm, they would be able to maintain warm and quiet temperatures like spring and summer. There was also ample potential as a tourist resort. The moisture in the air could also be changed as it pleased.For now, all of these were just hypotheses and not certain, but one could expect this to happen. I stood in front of a rock that looked tens of meters long after I stopped walking calmly. The arrow guiding me pointed to this huge rock.\u201cHmmm\u2026is it here?\u201dIt was a dead-end, but I wasn\u2019t disappointed as I reach out to the surface of the rock. Then, I slowly pulled up the commanding mana as if it moved in a certain pattern.Whoo-hoo\u2026At the same time, the command mana stretching out of my hand began to resonate with the wall as if it had become a key, and the hard rock began to pull me in as if it had become a black hole. If I opened this door without knowing it, I would be quite shocked, but this felt more familiar to me, having seen similar things.* * *The interior of the rock led to a huge space. To describe the form in a word\u2026\u201cRuins?\u201dThe interior of the huge rocky mountain was an unexpected space. The height of the huge hallway looked 5 meters high, and elaborate patterns carved on the wall conveyed an antique feeling. In addition, even though it was a hallway that should be dark because no light could come in, a glowing blue stone on the ceiling shone softly inside the hall of the ruins.I never thought there was such a huge space in these rocky mountains.\u2013 If you look at the architectural style, it\u2019s not the style that came out after the Great War.She was now as small as my palm, but her original identity was the leader of the Demons who fought against the humans\u2019 thousands of years ago. She was like a living witness of history, so if she said it was an architectural style she had never seen, it could be regarded as a historical site. If the alchemists or wizards heard about this, they would drool and go crazy.I couldn\u2019t believe this space hadn\u2019t been discovered before.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how to get in here if I hadn\u2019t used the Re-Fix Curse.\u201dAside from its location, it may have taken months to find a way to break through this defensive spell. In a sense, it was quite thoroughly hidden because there might be some side effects if the passage was broken with determination.-It could be dangerous.\u201cBut we can\u2019t just let it go; let\u2019s go in.\u201dOn the continent, civilizations that existed too far in the past to be preserved in records, were considered to be from the Ancient Age. The period is so distant that it could be at least 10,000 years in the past. Sadly, it couldn\u2019t be identified in the corridor because there were no figures from that time. However, its existence was well known due to the few ancient relics that had survived throughout the world.It didn\u2019t feel like anyone was around, but I felt a lot of mana around me. Contrary to what we expected, where the curse was manifested, the command mana was a little different. Most of the power dissolved in the atmosphere was mana.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the work of the Black Wizards.\u201d-Maybe they didn\u2019t realize that this place existed here. However, it was worth questioning why the long-lost curse had recently been activated.At first, I thought it was just a mine-type curse set up by the Black Wizards to destroy the entire territory. However, given the current situation, it was concluded that the unbalanced curse wasn\u2019t only one to two thousand years old but was stuck in the ground for at least 10,000 years, but somehow it became a huge landmine.\u201cIt\u2019s awfully quiet.\u201dPerserk murmured mysteriously as she was walked forward without light magic.-Common sense suggests that there is no Guardian at this site\u2026Squeak! Thump!-Oh, my mouth is a source of trouble.She slapped her mouth with her small hands. At the same time, the hallway, which was still a little while ago, began to become noisy for a moment, and before I could move, the stone wall of the ceiling twisted, and something huge fell toward me.Whoosh!!!With a huge sound, what struck me was a fist made of huge black stone.Waaaaaaaah!It was a matter of seconds. If the response were a little late, or if I were a little too slow, I would have been seriously hurt by the attack. Overcoming a sigh of relief, I looked at the owner of the giant fist that attacked me with a frown.He was a blue-eyed monster with a human figure, about 4 meters tall, with angled black stones attached to it. On its forehead, a small blue jewel the size of a human palm was embedded like a nucleus, and I could realize what it was just by looking at its shape and the amount of mana contained within.Formed of hundreds of mana stones, it was a Magic Stone. One this big, was worth its size in platinum.\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that a Magic Stone? That\u2019s crazy.\u201dI was shocked.-Golem\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a magic golem. And, it\u2019s amazing that it\u2019s using a Magic Stone as its nucleus.The number of golems in front of me was roughly a dozen. All of them were using a palm-sized rock on their foreheads as a nucleus. Unlike regular golems, which usually used mana stones to move, these guys were hewn from raw materials.\u201cIt smells.\u201dThe sight made me think.My expression frowned.-It must be strong, agile, and firm beyond comparison to the mass-production golem that the Alchemist Society boasts, and there is a possibility that it has a special ability, so you must not overdo it.Perserk\u2019s advice came nervously, but I had already quickly dug into it.Boom.At the same time, a black spark popped under my rolled fist\u2026if the opponent is made of solid rock, not flesh, a half-hearted attack would put me in danger. Besides, since it had a Magic Stone, I didn\u2019t know what kind of functions it had. It started attacking me again, moving at great speed, but I wasn\u2019t one to back down. Rather, I ducked under its fist as I stepped forward, swinging wildly.[Heavenly Explosive Attack ]Bang! Boom!Intense sounds and black sparks scattered all over the place as the giant golem lifted in the air. It was an attack that would normally have destroyed the body of a regular golem, but these survived. Without hesitation, I reached out to the golem\u2019s head and forcibly snatched the Magic Stone and ripped it apart.Riiiip!A half-broken rock was caught in my hand and was pulled out of the golem\u2019s head.\u201cI can smell it!\u201d-Your power is amazing every time I see it. By the way, what the hell does it smell like?I shouted proudly at her tilting her head as if she couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cThe smell of money! It\u2019s the signs of a big hit!\u201dMy statement was mindful of the possibility that the ancient ruins could control the weather conditions of the Hines estate. There were many golems here that had a Magic Stone. I didn\u2019t know for sure, but what\u2019s hidden here seemed to be a big hit.It\u2019s not an abandoned and dying land; it\u2019s unlimited gold!* * *Boooom!With a refreshing sound of destruction, the hard rock stuck in the last Golem\u2019s head was torn apart by my bare hands.\u201cWhoa\u2026that was intense.\u201dPerserk was wiping off her sweat in a refreshing mood.\u2013 Intense? You need to re-learn the word intense.\u201cWasn\u2019t it a little intense, though?\u201dI just smiled while showing her my torn, burnt sleeves.-Who\u2019s to blame for your black and torn sleeves? If you look at yourself, you\u2019ll realize how dense that statement sounds.Her words quieted me.\u201cBy the way, how much is this worth?\u201dA Magic Stone was pulled out and was placed inside of the bag on my back. I found some of the golems that gave up and tried to get away quickly and took their Magic Stones too.My previously empty bag was now full, and it was all thanks to the meticulous dissection of the golems.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm not going to use your energy to save money. Leave it to me. I'll call you more and give you back.\"That's what you say. I wouldn't give it away as easily as a child who's already well-to-do.It was true that the existence of Yeoju definitely came heavy as even the masterpiece buldak, who was submissive to me, gave up face and acted cute, hesitated.But the difficulty without the lady's wine was the same with me.\"Do you see him here?\"When I showed Layna to the two guys I was holding in my arms, the eyes of the two giant guys fell on her.\"A warrior who saved the world. But the rules of the world make it impossible to live or die like this.\"Two new faces flinched at my words.I know that even if you have a violent temper, you are not a dead man for nothing.I comforted two of them and told them quietly, as if they were parents who told their children old stories.\"He sacrificed everything he could for the sake of the world, and his existence itself was forgotten. It's no use telling who it is, but at least you know I'm not lying.\"At my words, the Qurungi burst into tears and the fire chicken stretched out its beak and sniffed at Reina's body.Then he looked at me with half-suspicious eyes, and soon they looked at each other and quietly retired.Uh-huh.It was the Cheongnyong Tomb that brought out the female liquor first.a masterpiece of the Four Dragon The basic traits of the head were brutal, but they were spiritual deities that offered the highest respect to those who sacrificed their noble lives.It probably stimulated their hearts by saving the world and disappearing alone.After summoning a small female liquor in her mouth, she made a golden female liquor in her arms, and a fire chicken that was put out to me with her beak, and I patted the beak and the scales of the beak without a word.\"Thank you.\"It's...Leaving the retreating boys behind with a subtle cry, I put two marbles in the air and finally put Raina's body in the air.\"Roar, Bres, load.\"It was not long before I spoke to Kureungi, and he looked at me as if he was surprised, and soon began to collect the blue-eyed thunderstorm in his mouth.\"Shoot me when I signal you.\"It was not long before I raised one arm and spoke, and the face of the Qurungi turned complicatedly upside down, and soon he nodded quietly.It was not long before I, who launched the last magic line, began to penetrate Raina's body, combining the power of magic and two female spirits, the power of the new Soo.As the bright lights of five colors began to seep into Raina's body, as if something like a ghost were being absorbed while wandering around, her pale face gradually began to turn red.A human being but not a human being. It may be oppression, not salvation, that brings her back to life, who is no longer even human.But there were so many things to show even if she died again.Not to die like this yet.He was too sad to be forgotten by everyone.The God of the First, according to your wishes.[Checking out the last installment]][9th-degree Eucharist][Saving]Soon after, the last sexual magic came out, and Reina's body began to be engulfed in the light.Later, I raised my hand so that I could shoot the brainstorm at any time.If you fail again...\"It's better to break the body than disappear.\"I can't be sure of this anti-smoking softening.If it goes wrong, there is a high possibility that not only the body but also the soul of Layna, who holds onto the faint hope of living, will be destroyed.SoEven a little twist had to break her body and take her soul out immediately.It was the same before, and this time again.Reina's body, which is swimming in the light, and the wings that sprang up according to God's will are fluttering.As if witnessing the descent of a sacred angel in person, Reina slowly unfolded herself, closing her eyes, as if she were a rising angel.AndIn the long-running work, I've already laid out dozens and hundreds of magicians everywhere to fix any problems as soon as they arise.Was it completed soon?As the light slowly penetrated, I slowly lowered my arms and shook my head at the Qurungi.\"That's enough. Now.\"It's...At what I said, the Qurungi scattered the brain-crazy Bresse in the air.It was then.Boom!!!A white light fell from the sky and began to envelop Reina.Ferserk opened his eyes round to see if he was surprised by the unexpected results.In the first place, it was not me who made the wings on Raina's back, but the goddess of Priya who gave it to me.She might have wanted a real angel to save Reina and spread her will.Although the beginning is made of artificial beings.With the blessing of the two gods, Reina began to turn into something complete.Soon after,The cloths that were covering Reina's God began to crumble and appear in the sky and white clothes.And the light disappeared with the appearance of a symbol of God on her forehead.It was a different kind of power from the saint's signs.Slowly she began to open her eyes.Very slowly. The Kureung and the Fire Chicken watched as they gulped down what was so nervous.It must have been a long time since the slow change took place.Soon after, Reina's eyes, which slowly began to open, gave off a mysterious atmosphere with silver.Argh!!It was not long before she landed on the floor barefoot, and her back wings fluttered brightly.Then, it became a particle of light and disappeared like a scattering.Visibility and non-visualization were virtually no surprise.Looking around, including me, she soon looked down at her hand and took another step slowly.And soon she came up to me and looked up at me quietly.\"I'm... are you alive?\"\"I told you. Hang in there with a desire to live.\"He's good at holding out.In my words, she must have remembered her memories and what I said, but soon she shook her shoulders and bowed her head.Then, with one hand covering his mouth, he sat down and sobbed lightly.\"I really thought that was it... ...but I never thought I'd see that good life again.\"\"No one still remembers you before. All I can do is put you in a new body.\"Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.There was no way to revive the already erased memory, and there was a high possibility that even Ray would be in danger.\"It's okay... it's okay... you remember... you remember me.\"\"Really?\"\"Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'll never forget the light you gave me.\"When I grabbed her shoulder, she was still sobbing with her head in her arms.Even though she was born as an artificial angel by the power of God, she is not emotionless.Wait a minute, I remember the heavenly beings have no feelings, but is this okay?\"How about the fresh air that you drink again?\"\"I love it... ...how long has it been since I closed my eyes?\"\"A little over a month ago?\"\"......\"At a guess, Reina's smile came from her mouth.\"What a ridiculous period.\"She, who spoke calmly, knelt down to me and looked down.\"You showed me a very small light and saved me. Accordingly, I will keep the promise I made to you.\"My hand will be your will, my feet will be your horse.Until the moment this life burned down. I will follow you.Her words, which spoke calmly and solemnly swore, soon became a force and made an invisible cord between her and me.I don't care what happens.After thisShe slowly raised her head and gave a bright smile.Illina, who was called one of the six most beautiful women on the continent, has grown mature.Of course, it's hard to see her as the same person because her outward appearance has changed a little, but she has a charm that gives off a mysterious atmosphere and shakes the mind of reason.But I ignored her charm and ignored it.It's probably only an amateur who cares about his work.\"You know, you're not human.\"\"Yes... ...I feel the same way myself. It feels oddly different.\"\"The Lord Priya will put his strength into your body and try to use you.\"\"If it's God's will... ...and yours.\"\"I didn't mean it.\"The smile disappeared from her face at my words.\"I don't need it.\"\"You can't throw it away, so keep it. I'll protect you.\"She nodded quietly at my words.\"Where do you feel uncomfortable?\"\"No, not at all. It's rather surprisingly light.\"I nodded quietly at the words.\"I'll have to stay here for a while. It's not completely adjusted yet, and you have to stay away from me for a while to avoid the eyes of providence that make the world a reality.\"She tilted her head curiously at my words.\"What does that mean?\"\"Not a big deal, stay here for a while. I'm sure these two guys will help you.\"She gave me a strange look as I pointed to the fire rooster and the cuneung.\"If that's an order.\"\"Let's check one last thing.\"She gave me a bright smile.But the smile was horribly distorted by the bombshells that soon popped out of my mouth.\"Let's face your past face to face.\"According to the Doppelg\u00e4nger theory, if two people are completely the same person, one of them must disappear.It is also a part that cannot be overlooked in any way.on the contrary, if there is no problemHer resurrection was meant to be perfect.I'd prefer to avoid the final verification.It was also an essential verification process for the simultaneous existence of Illinois here and the Illinois of the future, which came from other world lines.You're meeting me?\"I nodded at the sight of him asking with a very nervous face.\"You don't like it?\"\"No...... not really. I'm actually a little embarrassed... but are you okay? Even if I intrude into your life.\"\"Don't get in there, I'll save you and that's it. You take care of your own business from now on. It's up to you to decide whether you're going to live here, leaving Hines territory for the Palan Empire, not me.\"If you've already saved it once and are diagnosed with complete recovery, then it's your responsibility, not mine.Meeting Illinois will be the final verification of the cure.\"Your name is Reina?\"\"Yes, it's a name I'm quite attached to now. And it's the first name you've ever called me.\"I thought my personality was subtly twisted, but I wondered if it was because of my mood.Doctors are supposed to save patients, not responsible for their lives.Her face began to feel a strange stubbornness in what I said.The Manreb hero is coming back!Thirteen volumes and 20 episodesShin-soo's power is rumored to be clean and clear.Unlike evil-doers, Sasin-su is a creature that feeds on the good spirits of the world.In particular, it was safe to say that Yeoju, which Shin-soo has, was a collection of power.a creature like the life of a god, a cohesion of its powerIt was the magic pearl of Shin-soo.Because Cheongnyong Tombs usually have female liquor in their mouths, the female liquor tends to look visible, but no one sees the main character because the main character is usually inside.It was of course the other two yet to be born, Hyeonmu and Baekho, and Hwangryong and Giraffe, the central figures.Of course, yellow dragons and giraffes cannot be summoned from this land.As a result, Yeoju was the lifeblood of the god and was so important that it was called the source of its power.Even parents can't pass it to them.When I asked for a female liquor, the Qurungi and the buldak instinctively flinched and withdrew from me.\"You don't use it now anyway. I'm not going to use your energy to save money. Leave it to me. I'll call you more and give you back.\"That's what you say. I wouldn't give it away as easily as a child who's already well-to-do.It was true that the existence of Yeoju definitely came heavy as even the masterpiece buldak, who was submissive to me, gave up face and acted cute, hesitated.But the difficulty without the lady's wine was the same with me.\"Do you see him here?\"When I showed Layna to the two guys I was holding in my arms, the eyes of the two giant guys fell on her.\"A warrior who saved the world. But the rules of the world make it impossible to live or die like this.\"Two new faces flinched at my words.I know that even if you have a violent temper, you are not a dead man for nothing.I comforted two of them and told them quietly, as if they were parents who told their children old stories.\"He sacrificed everything he could for the sake of the world, and his existence itself was forgotten. It's no use telling who it is, but at least you know I'm not lying.\"At my words, the Qurungi burst into tears and the fire chicken stretched out its beak and sniffed at Reina's body.Then he looked at me with half-suspicious eyes, and soon they looked at each other and quietly retired.Uh-huh.It was the Cheongnyong Tomb that brought out the female liquor first.a masterpiece of the Four Dragon The basic traits of the head were brutal, but they were spiritual deities that offered the highest respect to those who sacrificed their noble lives.It probably stimulated their hearts by saving the world and disappearing alone.After summoning a small female liquor in her mouth, she made a golden female liquor in her arms, and a fire chicken that was put out to me with her beak, and I patted the beak and the scales of the beak without a word.\"Thank you.\"It's...Leaving the retreating boys behind with a subtle cry, I put two marbles in the air and finally put Raina's body in the air.\"Roar, Bres, load.\"It was not long before I spoke to Kureungi, and he looked at me as if he was surprised, and soon began to collect the blue-eyed thunderstorm in his mouth.\"Shoot me when I signal you.\"It was not long before I raised one arm and spoke, and the face of the Qurungi turned complicatedly upside down, and soon he nodded quietly.It was not long before I, who launched the last magic line, began to penetrate Raina's body, combining the power of magic and two female spirits, the power of the new Soo.As the bright lights of five colors began to seep into Raina's body, as if something like a ghost were being absorbed while wandering around, her pale face gradually began to turn red.A human being but not a human being. It may be oppression, not salvation, that brings her back to life, who is no longer even human.But there were so many things to show even if she died again.Not to die like this yet.He was too sad to be forgotten by everyone.The God of the First, according to your wishes.[Checking out the last installment]][9th-degree Eucharist][Saving]Soon after, the last sexual magic came out, and Reina's body began to be engulfed in the light.Later, I raised my hand so that I could shoot the brainstorm at any time.If you fail again...\"It's better to break the body than disappear.\"I can't be sure of this anti-smoking softening.If it goes wrong, there is a high possibility that not only the body but also the soul of Layna, who holds onto the faint hope of living, will be destroyed.SoEven a little twist had to break her body and take her soul out immediately.It was the same before, and this time again.Reina's body, which is swimming in the light, and the wings that sprang up according to God's will are fluttering.As if witnessing the descent of a sacred angel in person, Reina slowly unfolded herself, closing her eyes, as if she were a rising angel.AndIn the long-running work, I've already laid out dozens and hundreds of magicians everywhere to fix any problems as soon as they arise.Was it completed soon?As the light slowly penetrated, I slowly lowered my arms and shook my head at the Qurungi.\"That's enough. Now.\"It's...At what I said, the Qurungi scattered the brain-crazy Bresse in the air.It was then.Boom!!!A white light fell from the sky and began to envelop Reina.Ferserk opened his eyes round to see if he was surprised by the unexpected results.In the first place, it was not me who made the wings on Raina's back, but the goddess of Priya who gave it to me.She might have wanted a real angel to save Reina and spread her will.Although the beginning is made of artificial beings.With the blessing of the two gods, Reina began to turn into something complete.Soon after,The cloths that were covering Reina's God began to crumble and appear in the sky and white clothes.And the light disappeared with the appearance of a symbol of God on her forehead.It was a different kind of power from the saint's signs.Slowly she began to open her eyes.Very slowly. The Kureung and the Fire Chicken watched as they gulped down what was so nervous.It must have been a long time since the slow change took place.Soon after, Reina's eyes, which slowly began to open, gave off a mysterious atmosphere with silver.Argh!!It was not long before she landed on the floor barefoot, and her back wings fluttered brightly.Then, it became a particle of light and disappeared like a scattering.Visibility and non-visualization were virtually no surprise.Looking around, including me, she soon looked down at her hand and took another step slowly.And soon she came up to me and looked up at me quietly.\"I'm... are you alive?\"\"I told you. Hang in there with a desire to live.\"He's good at holding out.In my words, she must have remembered her memories and what I said, but soon she shook her shoulders and bowed her head.Then, with one hand covering his mouth, he sat down and sobbed lightly.\"I really thought that was it... ...but I never thought I'd see that good life again.\"\"No one still remembers you before. All I can do is put you in a new body.\"Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.There was no way to revive the already erased memory, and there was a high possibility that even Ray would be in danger.\"It's okay... it's okay... you remember... you remember me.\"\"Really?\"\"Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'll never forget the light you gave me.\"When I grabbed her shoulder, she was still sobbing with her head in her arms.Even though she was born as an artificial angel by the power of God, she is not emotionless.Wait a minute, I remember the heavenly beings have no feelings, but is this okay?\"How about the fresh air that you drink again?\"\"I love it... ...how long has it been since I closed my eyes?\"\"A little over a month ago?\"\"......\"At a guess, Reina's smile came from her mouth.\"What a ridiculous period.\"She, who spoke calmly, knelt down to me and looked down.\"You showed me a very small light and saved me.

You skipped another meal?\"\"......\"a quiet forest cabinAlthough it is not a rare forest to be trained in the lungs, Belial continued to recuperate in a small forest not far from the palace with the help of Illinois.The man, who sat on the rock without a word and reached out his hand and sat down with the bird, did not turn his head even at the girl's cry.Ignorance, as this has always happened since he was brought in the last few days, Illinois looked like nothing new.\"Sigh... I'll just talk to him.\"\"Human Woman.\"a human womanEven though Illina had a name, he started calling her a human woman.\"What is it?\"\"Since when the sun has risen...\"\"What?\"The girl, Illina, frowned at the sudden question.\"What are you talking about? This mana. When did the sun rise? Of course, the sun rises in the morning.\"\"I see. Does the sun rise every time?\"\"Well, isn't it?\"\"......\"As the man who did not answer slowly stretched out his finger, a small lark flying in the garden quickly flew and sat on his finger.\"There was no sun in my hometown where I was born.\"\"Belliele, you said you came from a place that wasn't here, right? Where are you from?\"\"Black Army.\"\"Black servant? What is that? People. You have to make it easier to understand.\"At the grumbling of Illinois, Belial looked at the bird silently and remained silent.I thought the silence was frustrating when I was about to say something.Belial's mouth slowly opened.The Ma people were banished from the land a long time ago. And he was trapped in a place where he could never come back.\"\"......\"\"The Maas, who took their new home there, have been grinding their teeth for a long time for all life on the continent.

What's wrong?\"\"No. You seem to have a lot of faith in him.\"Illina frowned as if embarrassed by the unexpected remark.\"Trust... ...trust... yes, trust me, you're such a good-natured guy.\"While speaking calmly, he seemed to feel emotional.\"Then what's the use? He's a brag, a bunch of pretensions, a quarrel, and he's a vicious man who enjoys watching others cry.\"At Illina's cry, Belial just listened silently.\"To be honest, it used to be like that. I'm interested in his swordsmanship, so I've even brought him up with a Korean marriage question to learn.\"\"So?\"\"What do you mean? I was cold-heartedly rejected.\"Belial tilted her head at the calm voice of Illinois.Whether it's a human or a horse, I know that the aesthetic sense is similar.\"\"Oh, really?\"\"You must be quite a beauty from the point of view of our mah people.\"\"I don't know.

After all, that's where it ends.\"Illina, who spoke calmly, reached out her hand.Then the bird sitting in Belial's hand looked at Ilina without a word and went straight into Belial.\"The animals are very good at following.\"\"......\"Quietly silent, he looked at Illina and Caldiras in her arms.\"Master of the Shingam.\"\"What?\"\"I heard that the new prosecutor has an ego. I thought you were going to yell at me to kill you.\"\"Caldiras isn't the kind of guy who just cries out to kill the mana.\"\"It's a little different.\"Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.He calmly brought out what he knew.\"The sword of the sword, the self of Caldiras, is known to be very ferocious for the Ma people. I heard that 3,000 years ago, when the self could be modern, he hated the horse race almost fanatically.\"At the words, Illina looked at Caldiras, but Caldiras said nothing until the end.\"It changes over time.\"At Ilina's words, Belial nodded silently.Then he staggered up slowly.\"Catch the sword.\"\"What?\"Even our Ma people, who have been enemies for thousands of years, tend to acknowledge the sword. My family has inherited the independent sword technique created by imitating such a sword. Although I can't teach you a proper autopsy. It's not gonna help.\"\"That's enough. I'm not so stubborn as to confront a patient.\"Illina's refusal slowly lifted Magi.At the same time, the surrounding air changes.\"You need to know that even if you're like this, you're not in a position to worry about.\"Illina looked at him with a stiff look at the words.Then he seemed to be thinking for a while, slowly untangling the cloth wrapped around the caldiras and pulled up Manna.Along with the unique mana flow that appears when using a heavy sword, it is activated as if a mana bursts out of her whole body, and the green sword begins to be made with the tip of her sword.the symbol of none other than the SwordmasterIt was an oracle.\"Oorablade at a young age. The reincarnation of the sword itself. Are you the first?\"\"Exactly the second, because that son of a gun wasn't just a sodmaster.\"\"I'm curious how it works.\"Boom!!!With the horse, Illina takes a strong step.The ground on which her feet touched was broken for a moment, and her new brother shot into him like a shell.At the moment, the explosive weight was put on the sword, and the lower cut, which was applied, Belial calmly lifted the sword.Whaaaah!A tremendous sound of shock overturned the whole forest.\"You're quick-witted. No one knows that the sword that you combed down the middle bayonet will be destroyed.\"\"Didn't you say that? My family swordsmanship is a catch that mimics a heavy sword.\"He spoke calmly, took out the raised sword momentarily and scattered the balance, and walked the leg of Illinois.\"Huh?!\"At the same time, as I tried to grab Illinois' neck, I turned and grabbed her arm and held her to the ground.Whaaaaah!However, the shock wave that followed soon forced Belial to step down after failing to achieve all the meaning.\"In the midst of all this, you're being considerate.\"\"Don't think that human chivalry is only human. Although I remained alone, my family had a family tradition of not bothering the weak, whether they were enemies or allies.\"\"Thank you so much for crying!\"She came at her with an irritated look.Belial meant that she was considered an overwhelming underdog.Boom! Boom!A tremendous sound of shock began to sound inside the quiet forest.Illyana and Belial poured an unhesitating attack on each other as if they were making a life-or-death decision under the guise of a rival.Although weak, Belial showed a superior horse-like force, and Illinois pressed him with unprecedented strength and finesse.[Ilina, what are you doing, forgetting you're a patient?]]Illina, who naturally became interested in the battle with the strong, was surprised that she soon forgot that her opponent was a patient and wielded a sword.At the same time, Belial, who was wielding her sword at her level, was embarrassed when she suddenly stopped the attack and forced her to turn the sword.Whaaaaah!Eventually, Belial hit the heavy black ground and smashed the floor, and the impact knocked ill-balanced Illina over.Then, as if to support her, Belial reached out quickly, and he lost his balance and collapsed.Silence lasted for a long time on the behavior of the two men who collapsed in a delicate atmosphere.Then, after a short silence, Illina opened her mouth first.\"Mi, I'm sorry. But would you please step aside?\"Staring blankly at her words, he slowly stepped aside and stood up.\"Excuse me.\"\"Well, the Ma people are polite. You said we were enemies. You could've just killed him.\"\"It doesn't pay me to kill you.\"Speaking calmly, he took the sword.Although the confrontation collapsed in an instant, neither of them seemed to be dissatisfied with the fact.\"Dining... you didn't. I'm going to see you eat today. Don't skip it.\"\"Why are you so nice to me?\"\"Because of the persimmon.\"Belial was silent at Illina's words.It was then.\"Why, that was nice to see. Do we go on?\"With an unheard-of voice, both Illina and Belial looked surprised and turned their heads.\"Raina, take him down.\"\"Belliele, I thought you'd still be a homage to the Ma...\"For a moment. Before anyone could react, white wings flashed and flapped pure white feathers.Belial's body, which was on guard in surprise, bounced off as if it had been hit by a huge pendulum.Following the situation in an instant, the black-haired boy who created the situation said to Belial leisurely.\"Laina isn't the half-dead body you used to know. Oh, you don't know who this is, do you?The Manreb hero is coming back!Episode 21 of the Thirteen106. Unusual language.\"Belial!

After all, that's where it ends.\"Illina, who spoke calmly, reached out her hand.Then the bird sitting in Belial's hand looked at Ilina without a word and went straight into Belial.\"The animals are very good at following.\"\"......\"Quietly silent, he looked at Illina and Caldiras in her arms.\"Master of the Shingam.\"\"What?\"\"I heard that the new prosecutor has an ego. I thought you were going to yell at me to kill you.\"\"Caldiras isn't the kind of guy who just cries out to kill the mana.\"\"It's a little different.\"Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.He calmly brought out what he knew.\"The sword of the sword, the self of Caldiras, is known to be very ferocious for the Ma people. I heard that 3,000 years ago, when the self could be modern, he hated the horse race almost fanatically.\"At the words, Illina looked at Caldiras, but Caldiras said nothing until the end.\"It changes over time.\"At Ilina's words, Belial nodded silently.Then he staggered up slowly.\"Catch the sword.\"\"What?\"Even our Ma people, who have been enemies for thousands of years, tend to acknowledge the sword. My family has inherited the independent sword technique created by imitating such a sword. Although I can't teach you a proper autopsy. It's not gonna help.\"\"That's enough. I'm not so stubborn as to confront a patient.\"Illina's refusal slowly lifted Magi.At the same time, the surrounding air changes.\"You need to know that even if you're like this, you're not in a position to worry about.\"Illina looked at him with a stiff look at the words.Then he seemed to be thinking for a while, slowly untangling the cloth wrapped around the caldiras and pulled up Manna.Along with the unique mana flow that appears when using a heavy sword, it is activated as if a mana bursts out of her whole body, and the green sword begins to be made with the tip of her sword.the symbol of none other than the SwordmasterIt was an oracle.\"Oorablade at a young age. The reincarnation of the sword itself. Are you the first?\"\"Exactly the second, because that son of a gun wasn't just a sodmaster.\"\"I'm curious how it works.\"Boom!!!With the horse, Illina takes a strong step.The ground on which her feet touched was broken for a moment, and her new brother shot into him like a shell.At the moment, the explosive weight was put on the sword, and the lower cut, which was applied, Belial calmly lifted the sword.Whaaaah!A tremendous sound of shock overturned the whole forest.\"You're quick-witted. No one knows that the sword that you combed down the middle bayonet will be destroyed.\"\"Didn't you say that? My family swordsmanship is a catch that mimics a heavy sword.\"He spoke calmly, took out the raised sword momentarily and scattered the balance, and walked the leg of Illinois.\"Huh?!\"At the same time, as I tried to grab Illinois' neck, I turned and grabbed her arm and held her to the ground.Whaaaaah!However, the shock wave that followed soon forced Belial to step down after failing to achieve all the meaning.\"In the midst of all this, you're being considerate.\"\"Don't think that human chivalry is only human. Although I remained alone, my family had a family tradition of not bothering the weak, whether they were enemies or allies.\"\"Thank you so much for crying!\"She came at her with an irritated look.Belial meant that she was considered an overwhelming underdog.Boom! Boom!A tremendous sound of shock began to sound inside the quiet forest.Illyana and Belial poured an unhesitating attack on each other as if they were making a life-or-death decision under the guise of a rival.Although weak, Belial showed a superior horse-like force, and Illinois pressed him with unprecedented strength and finesse.[Ilina, what are you doing, forgetting you're a patient?]]Illina, who naturally became interested in the battle with the strong, was surprised that she soon forgot that her opponent was a patient and wielded a sword.At the same time, Belial, who was wielding her sword at her level, was embarrassed when she suddenly stopped the attack and forced her to turn the sword.Whaaaaah!Eventually, Belial hit the heavy black ground and smashed the floor, and the impact knocked ill-balanced Illina over.Then, as if to support her, Belial reached out quickly, and he lost his balance and collapsed.Silence lasted for a long time on the behavior of the two men who collapsed in a delicate atmosphere.Then, after a short silence, Illina opened her mouth first.\"Mi, I'm sorry. But would you please step aside?\"Staring blankly at her words, he slowly stepped aside and stood up.\"Excuse me.\"\"Well, the Ma people are polite. You said we were enemies. You could've just killed him.\"\"It doesn't pay me to kill you.\"Speaking calmly, he took the sword.Although the confrontation collapsed in an instant, neither of them seemed to be dissatisfied with the fact.\"Dining... you didn't. I'm going to see you eat today. Don't skip it.\"\"Why are you so nice to me?\"\"Because of the persimmon.\"Belial was silent at Illina's words.It was then.\"Why, that was nice to see. Do we go on?\"With an unheard-of voice, both Illina and Belial looked surprised and turned their heads.\"Raina, take him down.\"\"Belliele, I thought you'd still be a homage to the Ma...\"For a moment. Before anyone could react, white wings flashed and flapped pure white feathers.Belial's body, which was on guard in surprise, bounced off as if it had been hit by a huge pendulum.Following the situation in an instant, the black-haired boy who created the situation said to Belial leisurely.\"Laina isn't the half-dead body you used to know. Oh, you don't know who this is, do you?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's better to be hated by Ilina than to protect him from everyone's hands.He was not afraid of being stigmatized and tried to protect his younger brother's life.Was he able to deal with his brother's safety with complacency simply for the sake of national prestige?Of course not.I smiled at Belial looking at me without a wordless.\"It's not like this, but I'm a guardian for now.

I'm doing it because I believe in it.\"Reina questioned my unexpected answer but said nothing more.It's time for a bite.\"He was seriously injured in the undead situation in the Palan Empire and taken prisoner and detained by the Mahan army, and suffered years of terrible torture and humiliation that could not be described in words.\"The trembling hands of Illinois turned pale as if they were going to break.\"Shall I tell you what's going on here?\"At last, Illina's eyes were reddened by my subsequent words.Then he looked at Reina with a look of realness.The manna in the air began to shake, but not a single person except me seemed to notice it.\"All these words... are true...\"Boom!!Then, Illina opened her eyes wide before she could finish and stopped.She wasn't the only one.Except for Reina and me, the whole world felt as if it had stopped.\"It's... ...\"\"It will happen if you make a fuss about the past. Look, you've been wiped out. That won't change.\"\"......\"\"If you force yourself to remind me of your existence.\"Speaking calmly, I covered my mouth with one hand and spat out what was stuck in my mouth.It was a red-hot six-piece.The reality is that once you enter the 9th circle, you get closer to internal immunity, but even though you are in such a position, the impact was not normal.\"We're going to be regulated, aren't we?\"\"Okay... are you okay?\"\"Surprised, Reina rushed to help me.\"What are you doing?\"\"The scene of shouting urgently was the same enough to make me think that it makes sense even with age.\"Never try to experiment. Even if it's the moment you bring these facts up for the purpose of disruption...\"You disappear from the spot.Raina's face turned pale at a word without a lie.\"Don't commit suicide because you spent a lot of money on it.\"\"Oh, my God... ...there's no human being who can show that in this ignorant way!\"\"You know, here.\"Pointing at me and jokingly speaking, I soon reached for her.Curse is originally half made for good purposes. I'm sorry, but I'll put a curse on your face. As long as I am alive, I will remain semi-permanent.\"\"You're not going to see me as Illinois?\"\"It's similar, but I don't think they're the same person.\"This is not the only way to prepare.\"If that's the case, I wish I hadn't made this face in the first place...\"\"It's easy to say, and what did you do wrong to fix that pretty face?\"She smiled dejectedly at my words.\"If I had heard of this place, I would have fallen for it.\"\"You don't?\"\"Well, I'm willing to give you anything, body or mind, if you want, but I'm not as clean as you think. Honestly, I'm a little scared of men.\"\"Do as you please. I hate doing things around here and there, too. Close your eyes.\"Whoo!And at the same time, the air currents surrounded Reina for a moment. When it was completely gone, I flicked my finger and slowly defrosted the hardened mana around.Once thawed, Manna soon began to slowly unravel the area, causing a chain reaction, and soon the hardened Illinois and Belial began to move again.\"Davie, who the hell is this... ..uh?\"And Illina, who had been absent-minded, has repeated the same thing to me as if the interim process had been deleted.To be exact, it stopped while doing it.Illina tilted her head as she looked at Reina with a questionable face.\"Strange? I'm sure...\"Reina's face remained unchanged.However, no one saw her as the same person as Ilyna de Palan.I just looked at him as someone who looked a little alike.a perception curseThis means that the 9-circle curse used for Reina has settled down properly.\"What's wrong with you? staring into a person's face\"\"Oh, no. I'm sorry. It was rude. Oh, no, that's not it. Yes! You! What makes you judge me like that? What do you know about me?\"When Illina snapped at me as if she had been grumpy for no reason, Reina looked at me quietly.Then he shook his head quietly.\"That was a slip of the tongue. Please forgive my rudeness if you were offended. Lady Hwang.\"Illina looked embarrassed at the calm tone that was different from her previous one, which had been subtly choked.\"No, well... if you say so, I have nothing more to say...\"Unlike me, who has a temperament to bite when the opponent's tail is lowered, Illina did not like the meaningless division itself.On the contrary, all my attention was on that man named Belial after Reina's work.\"Raina.\"\"Yes.\"\"How many positions does he hold?\"\"Well, I've never had that much conversation. But I'm sure it was a very high position.\"\"Really? Well, you know more than I thought.\"Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.As I said so, I looked at him and asked.\"What made you come all the way here?\"He didn't answer my question.Instead, they asked questions in reverse.\"Come on over... ...man, do you mean you know where we came from?\"\"Did I look like a pushover enough to give you information without thinking?\"Instead of answering, he remained silent, but he constantly looked at me.The eyes were more of a boundary than hatred or hatred.I`m just a failure in my mission anyway. I have no value as a prisoner. Although I thank you for treating me humanely without killing me, it's just another matter.\"\"That's too bad. I was going to get the information out of the way if I got here.\"We look at each other through a quiet war of nerves.He was well aware that he didn't touch Belial to be considerate of Illinois.\"But before the prisoners of war, that human woman is like a lifesaver. Though the enemy is the enemy, he does not do anything stupid that cannot distinguish between grace and revenge.\"He said so, but he got up and said, leaving.\"I'll pay you back.\"I eased my hands lightly at the sight of him saying his words and disappearing.Then he slowly got up and looked at Ilina and snapped his hand clappingly.\"What, what?\"\"What do you mean? You should do what you always do.\"After instinctively realizing what I was doing, Illina sprang up.Seureung!At the same time, he pulled out Caldiras and shuddered away from me.At the same time, it was so funny that his pupils were constantly shaking.\"Well, you don't have to do that, do you?\"\"I'm going crazy even if you do it for me. You can't even pay for this anywhere.\"\"Well, I know that!\"\"Then take it well, dude.\"Boom!Even before the end of the conversation, Illina, who had been overtaken by Reina and overpowered, struggled desperately in cold sweat.It is a desperate resistance for a brilliant blonde woman with a noble atmosphere.The scene where the future self was holding and overpowering himself in the past was a complete scene.Of course, I don't know about it at all.Illina, who reached Sodmaster, was a strong contender.But Reyna was a warrior who had been out of that line for a while.Sodmasters can't be a big threat to me.\"It'll only hurt for the first time. I feel better soon.\"The girl, Illina de Palan, seemed to have a miraculous constitution that made a person's desire to massage just by looking at her.You don't do it to others at all. If I knew the efficacy of your massage, I would bring a bundle of money.'That's my refusal.

It's time to show the pride of the nobility.\"\"If you're ready, move.\"Angry vampires no longer opposed the war, and everyone gave their approval.The decision soon moved their long-prepared corps.It was also a moment of war.Only they didn't know that.The fact that there is a secret association waiting to move with a large number of troops.The Manreb hero is coming back!The 13th and 23rd episodesYou have to be the most embarrassed.Illina, who was looking up at Layna as if she had lost her words, slowly tried to reach out and stopped.With a look of uncertainty about what to say and what to do, Illina kept looking at Raina and me alternately.Therefore, I threw a keyword as a confirmation.\"Say hi. He's very close to you.\"Illina's expression was subtly frown at my words.\"Someone close? Do I know him?\"\"Maybe you know best.\"Illina's mouth was sulky because of her playful tone.\"What the... what the hell is...\"\"Will you believe me if I say it's you?\"Illina's eyes were slightly wide open at my words.Then, Veryl, who was watching it without saying a word, opened his eyes slightly.Well, let's see how it comes out.\"What... ...\"\"Fighter Reina.

Sigh...\"Her loose eyes, panting breath, hot cheeks, drooling from her mouth reminds her of a very obscene appearance, but sadly, her clothes were neat as if proving that no one had ever touched them.\"What an amazing body.\"It is a mysterious body that has a strong desire to massage at any moment.The Swordmaster and the Expert will remain the same.If you look at the strength of your own strength, you won't be able to break it with a machine gun from your previous life.That's what transformation is.Human beings, the only race that can cross the limit because they have the most ambiguous power, undergoes self-evolution once they experience transformation.A soft skin, but a body that absorbed mana, when needed, was no different from being an extremely rigid shield itself.Let's pull out a dagger without a word, strengthen my body and draw my fingertips...Cargagagagak...Rather than being cut by a knife, the reflexes made the blade hurt.\"Oh, I feel it every time...\"In your case, your body is more strange. It's not usually that bad.No matter how hard a sodmaster is, he is not as ignorant as he is.Honestly, haven't you had only one transformation? You'll have to go through three or four more transformation periods if you're not that ignorant?\"What should I say...\"It's happened once before.When I survived in the desert.It was when I was sucked into the basement because I fell into something wrong.The man who was welcoming me at that time had thousands of teeth sticking out of his mouth with a giant sandstorm, and had the power and sharpness to pierce steel.I almost died at first.\"I got used to it after I chewed it again.\"Well... ..I don't think you can get used to wanting to get used to it.\"The body will continue to strengthen. I was a soul back then. The power is being slowly applied to the body as it is all engraved in my soul.\"Didn't I tell you before?The first thing that taught me was none other than the ignorant monster of the physical school.Hercules, a survival expert.\"He's simply a test of how strong a man can be.\"How hard was he actually?In her question, I took the last-ditch first-choice battle in the corridor as the best example.Not all heroes were as crazy as then.\"I stopped your father from breaking the sea with my bare body. In the first place, the lunatic survival expert doesn't have a shield or a weapon on his body.\"Oh, my God.It is impossible to know how large the sword was used to separate the sea.In particular, the heavy sword of the body is not a speed or technique, but rather a grandiose technique that focuses on destructive power.The reality was that there was virtually no hero except Hercules who took such a sword with no body.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...\"After covering Ilina, who was shivering and convulsing, with a blanket, I wiped my smile off and said quietly.\"I have no one to listen to, so let me see you.\"I heard a sign outside the door.It was Belial.Later, I spoke to Persek through will.Persec, can you take a look at Ilyanna for a second?'I guess it's something she shouldn't hear.'I don't care if you listen to it. I don't really recommend it.'In my words, Persec seemed troubled for a long time, then nodded and sat on the simple bed of the cabin.Yeah, she doesn't have to stand by you in everything.\"Yes.\"After saying so, I walked along with Belial without anyone listening in a long time.Belial followed me slowly with a wary glance, and by the time I arrived not far from the cottage that stretched out in Illinois, I had a light hand.Uh-huh.At the same time, Mu Young-chang's Silence Curtain unfolded, and Belial looked at me without hiding his gaze that he was a little puzzled.\"What do you want to say? Human.\"\"We don't have to be formal between us. I'll ask you straightforwardly. Clarify the purpose of your coming here.\"\"......\"\"Otherwise, whatever Ilina said, you're dead here.\"without a smileBelial's expression began to turn pale as a huge mana began to move.In the first place, he was seriously injured and was recovering.Even if he fought in a normal state, he would have known best that he was not the one to do anything if the power gap was significant.......\"Silence...\"Whoooooo!One of his arms fell off as soon as he finished talking.\"Huh?\"\"You think I'm kidding, right?\"When he smiles and asks a question, he steps back.It means that you won't accept my smile.I opened my mouth again to him, who faltered and walked away without even thinking of rebelling.\"The arm, if you don't put it back in less than 30 minutes, you can't put it on forever. Think carefully.\"\"You're crazy, as expected. Madness ate into the soul, not the body.\"I looked quite surprised at the unexpected comment.Come to think of it, I think there was only one of the mah people that Harres had ever realized that he was the only one who could guess my condition just by just looking at my condition.So\"Was it Seop Melphrog?\"\"...that's... how did you do it?\"\"I don't know. Melphrog's eyes make me aware of my condition. I'm sure it's been a while. Is it a descendant?\"\"......\"He clenched his teeth at my words.\"You're going to shut your mouth to the end.\"\"Crazy.\"\"Honestly, I've never told anyone.\"After remembering everything and living for nearly a thousand years, the human self cannot be intact.\"I was a little crazy.\"Whoooooo!Soon the other arm was cut off in a flash.I asked quietly, although it seemed ridiculous for others to see him in a situation where he was being driven only by a simple sword.\"What is your purpose? I told you I'm going to crush the vampire, but I don't think you're going to just cooperate with the vampire and turn this place into a mess.\"I have already done my best at the time of the death of my close aide, Nick.\"\"The gold that Knicks had on you? He's already been invoiced, so it won't work.\"He avoided my eye at what I said.\"The eyes are turning. Did you hit the nail right on the head?\"\"......\"\"Then what is it? I don't think he's particularly greedy. It's a bit negative about the resurrection of the devil. The reason why the current rulers of the world sent you on foot is that it's hard to say that they and you have the same purpose.\"I smiled as I was pointing out one by one.\"If you're a descendant of Melfrog, you can see the soul.\"Speaking calmly, I soon used his scattered arms to lift them up.Whoo!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.At the same time, he looked at me in surprise as the commander Manna began to pour out of my body.\"How can anyone with the power of divinity...\"Uh-huh.His arms began to cling to his body as if he were alive, and soon after he recovered enough to move himself, he sent me an incredible look.\"What the hell do you... what do you know more?\"\"I've got a hunch. Melprague was a devotee of the Devil's Persec. If the custom is still alive, all you want is not just the resurrection of the devil. It's Persec's comfort.\"His expression wrenched at my words.\"Can I tell you more? The problem is, when that happens, there's no reason for you to refuse when vampires try to resurrect the devil. I would have welcomed you if you had welcomed me.\"\"I'm doomed...\"But I refused. What's the reason?\"He looked at me like a monster with a haggard look on his face.\"Even if he doesn't listen to himself, you're the only one who can find the devil's soul, so he sent you. You've noticed something wrong. Isn't that right?\"He clenched his teeth at my words.\"Vampires... ...the vampires have settled the demon King Persecrech's spirit into the body, resurrected it, and are trying to do what they want.\"They can't forget that Persek is not an idiot, but the devil who cried out for peace.Nevertheless, the reason for her resurrection is that she is the only demon with the absolute power to attract the mahjong.\"So when the ban was lifted, you had a different idea. As soon as I knew who I was, I stood by him. Why?\"Even now, if he could have run away, he could have run away.His eyes began to tremble with my eerie smile.\"I think if you're specifying the location of Persek's seal, there's only one. Somewhere around Ilyna, the owner of the Shingam, you would have thought that Persec's soul was sealed.\"\"The grace and resentment are simple excuses. Now, tell me. What do you really want?\"\"... ..to find the spirit of the devil. My eyes are sealed with the spirit of the devil. You can see it even if you do.\"\"So?\"\"And so, he...\"It protects the soul of the pure blood absolute, which is currently the only remaining, until the end of life.\"I wish the devil's resurrection, but I couldn't let them take advantage of it. That's why I used a human woman. She's showing me her sympathy.\"Human relationships are very friendly and ugly to each other.However, at a time when everything worked out well, one thing could be said if I had to pick a strange point.Persec remained with me in a state of spirit.However, why did he not see Persehrk?The reason is\"You. What's your eyesight now?\"\"......\"\"I can't control it when they come over here.\"I don't know much about Ma'an itself, but at least I've had that kind of overload. The reality was that they were judging it that way.That's why I don't find her covered with scarves, even though I have Persec next to me.I have never spoken to anyone but myself. How the hell did you find out?\"\"I told you. I was in an environment where I couldn't live in my mind. When you're a nut, you usually don't see anything.\"Do you know Tazza?They're gamblers. They're scammers at the smallest difference that most people don't see.\"......\"\"What people think. Sometimes I see it clearly, so I get it done on purpose. I'm really good at acting.\"I can make as many people as I want to protect, but I can't make people who can understand me.also\"I'm in a situation where I won't be strange to disappear anytime.\"I spoke again quietly after silence.\"I just took it, and I guess it hit you right?\"\"You're crazy. There is no reason why Maan is called Maan if it is at that level of filming.\"At that, I grinned and blew in the commander's mana under the overload that hung on his body.\"You. Are you ready to die for King Perserk?\"\"Why should I tell you that?\"\"I'm going to get a sense of what I'm going to do in the future or not, depending on your answer.\"said he, snatched his sitting hand.\"I don't do a lot of useless investment. It's normal to kill you on the spot, but if it's worth your investment, you should keep it alive.\"I, speaking calmly, smiled broadly.Only one for everyone else. It is also a story that should not be told as much as the former king with silver hair who kept protecting me.The vampire's plan is now too late to stop.\"You. Let's have a party with me.\"\"What are you talking about?\"\"There's only one thing that fits you and I. What do you say? Do you want to try?\"He was silent at my question.\"You'll need a price.\"The quick-witted man seemed to have found something in a smile imbued with my madness.\"Yes, I need a price.\"\"What is it?\"At his question I quietly told him the most important price.It was just one thing.The Manreb hero is coming back!Thirteen volumes and Twenty-four episodes\"Sigh... Sigh...\"Her loose eyes, panting breath, hot cheeks, drooling from her mouth reminds her of a very obscene appearance, but sadly, her clothes were neat as if proving that no one had ever touched them.\"What an amazing body.\"It is a mysterious body that has a strong desire to massage at any moment.The Swordmaster and the Expert will remain the same.If you look at the strength of your own strength, you won't be able to break it with a machine gun from your previous life.That's what transformation is.Human beings, the only race that can cross the limit because they have the most ambiguous power, undergoes self-evolution once they experience transformation.A soft skin, but a body that absorbed mana, when needed, was no different from being an extremely rigid shield itself.Let's pull out a dagger without a word, strengthen my body and draw my fingertips...Cargagagagak...Rather than being cut by a knife, the reflexes made the blade hurt.\"Oh, I feel it every time...\"In your case, your body is more strange.

I was a soul back then. The power is being slowly applied to the body as it is all engraved in my soul.\"Didn't I tell you before?The first thing that taught me was none other than the ignorant monster of the physical school.Hercules, a survival expert.\"He's simply a test of how strong a man can be.\"How hard was he actually?In her question, I took the last-ditch first-choice battle in the corridor as the best example.Not all heroes were as crazy as then.\"I stopped your father from breaking the sea with my bare body. In the first place, the lunatic survival expert doesn't have a shield or a weapon on his body.\"Oh, my God.It is impossible to know how large the sword was used to separate the sea.In particular, the heavy sword of the body is not a speed or technique, but rather a grandiose technique that focuses on destructive power.The reality was that there was virtually no hero except Hercules who took such a sword with no body.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...\"After covering Ilina, who was shivering and convulsing, with a blanket, I wiped my smile off and said quietly.\"I have no one to listen to, so let me see you.\"I heard a sign outside the door.It was Belial.Later, I spoke to Persek through will.Persec, can you take a look at Ilyanna for a second?'I guess it's something she shouldn't hear.'I don't care if you listen to it. I don't really recommend it.'In my words, Persec seemed troubled for a long time, then nodded and sat on the simple bed of the cabin.Yeah, she doesn't have to stand by you in everything.\"Yes.\"After saying so, I walked along with Belial without anyone listening in a long time.Belial followed me slowly with a wary glance, and by the time I arrived not far from the cottage that stretched out in Illinois, I had a light hand.Uh-huh.At the same time, Mu Young-chang's Silence Curtain unfolded, and Belial looked at me without hiding his gaze that he was a little puzzled.\"What do you want to say? Human.\"\"We don't have to be formal between us. I'll ask you straightforwardly. Clarify the purpose of your coming here.\"\"......\"\"Otherwise, whatever Ilina said, you're dead here.\"without a smileBelial's expression began to turn pale as a huge mana began to move.In the first place, he was seriously injured and was recovering.Even if he fought in a normal state, he would have known best that he was not the one to do anything if the power gap was significant.......\"Silence...\"Whoooooo!One of his arms fell off as soon as he finished talking.\"Huh?\"\"You think I'm kidding, right?\"When he smiles and asks a question, he steps back.It means that you won't accept my smile.I opened my mouth again to him, who faltered and walked away without even thinking of rebelling.\"The arm, if you don't put it back in less than 30 minutes, you can't put it on forever. Think carefully.\"\"You're crazy, as expected. Madness ate into the soul, not the body.\"I looked quite surprised at the unexpected comment.Come to think of it, I think there was only one of the mah people that Harres had ever realized that he was the only one who could guess my condition just by just looking at my condition.So\"Was it Seop Melphrog?\"\"...that's... how did you do it?\"\"I don't know. Melphrog's eyes make me aware of my condition. I'm sure it's been a while. Is it a descendant?\"\"......\"He clenched his teeth at my words.\"You're going to shut your mouth to the end.\"\"Crazy.\"\"Honestly, I've never told anyone.\"After remembering everything and living for nearly a thousand years, the human self cannot be intact.\"I was a little crazy.\"Whoooooo!Soon the other arm was cut off in a flash.I asked quietly, although it seemed ridiculous for others to see him in a situation where he was being driven only by a simple sword.\"What is your purpose? I told you I'm going to crush the vampire, but I don't think you're going to just cooperate with the vampire and turn this place into a mess.\"I have already done my best at the time of the death of my close aide, Nick.\"\"The gold that Knicks had on you? He's already been invoiced, so it won't work.\"He avoided my eye at what I said.\"The eyes are turning. Did you hit the nail right on the head?\"\"......\"\"Then what is it? I don't think he's particularly greedy. It's a bit negative about the resurrection of the devil. The reason why the current rulers of the world sent you on foot is that it's hard to say that they and you have the same purpose.\"I smiled as I was pointing out one by one.\"If you're a descendant of Melfrog, you can see the soul.\"Speaking calmly, I soon used his scattered arms to lift them up.Whoo!Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.At the same time, he looked at me in surprise as the commander Manna began to pour out of my body.\"How can anyone with the power of divinity...\"Uh-huh.His arms began to cling to his body as if he were alive, and soon after he recovered enough to move himself, he sent me an incredible look.\"What the hell do you... what do you know more?\"\"I've got a hunch. Melprague was a devotee of the Devil's Persec. If the custom is still alive, all you want is not just the resurrection of the devil. It's Persec's comfort.\"His expression wrenched at my words.\"Can I tell you more? The problem is, when that happens, there's no reason for you to refuse when vampires try to resurrect the devil. I would have welcomed you if you had welcomed me.\"\"I'm doomed...\"But I refused. What's the reason?\"He looked at me like a monster with a haggard look on his face.\"Even if he doesn't listen to himself, you're the only one who can find the devil's soul, so he sent you. You've noticed something wrong. Isn't that right?\"He clenched his teeth at my words.\"Vampires... ...the vampires have settled the demon King Persecrech's spirit into the body, resurrected it, and are trying to do what they want.\"They can't forget that Persek is not an idiot, but the devil who cried out for peace.Nevertheless, the reason for her resurrection is that she is the only demon with the absolute power to attract the mahjong.\"So when the ban was lifted, you had a different idea. As soon as I knew who I was, I stood by him. Why?\"Even now, if he could have run away, he could have run away.His eyes began to tremble with my eerie smile.\"I think if you're specifying the location of Persek's seal, there's only one. Somewhere around Ilyna, the owner of the Shingam, you would have thought that Persec's soul was sealed.\"\"The grace and resentment are simple excuses. Now, tell me. What do you really want?\"\"... ..to find the spirit of the devil. My eyes are sealed with the spirit of the devil. You can see it even if you do.\"\"So?\"\"And so, he...\"It protects the soul of the pure blood absolute, which is currently the only remaining, until the end of life.\"I wish the devil's resurrection, but I couldn't let them take advantage of it. That's why I used a human woman. She's showing me her sympathy.\"Human relationships are very friendly and ugly to each other.However, at a time when everything worked out well, one thing could be said if I had to pick a strange point.Persec remained with me in a state of spirit.However, why did he not see Persehrk?The reason is\"You. What's your eyesight now?\"\"......\"\"I can't control it when they come over here.\"I don't know much about Ma'an itself, but at least I've had that kind of overload. The reality was that they were judging it that way.That's why I don't find her covered with scarves, even though I have Persec next to me.I have never spoken to anyone but myself. How the hell did you find out?\"\"I told you. I was in an environment where I couldn't live in my mind. When you're a nut, you usually don't see anything.\"Do you know Tazza?They're gamblers. They're scammers at the smallest difference that most people don't see.\"......\"\"What people think. Sometimes I see it clearly, so I get it done on purpose. I'm really good at acting.\"I can make as many people as I want to protect, but I can't make people who can understand me.also\"I'm in a situation where I won't be strange to disappear anytime.\"I spoke again quietly after silence.\"I just took it, and I guess it hit you right?\"\"You're crazy. There is no reason why Maan is called Maan if it is at that level of filming.\"At that, I grinned and blew in the commander's mana under the overload that hung on his body.\"You. Are you ready to die for King Perserk?\"\"Why should I tell you that?\"\"I'm going to get a sense of what I'm going to do in the future or not, depending on your answer.\"said he, snatched his sitting hand.\"I don't do a lot of useless investment. It's normal to kill you on the spot, but if it's worth your investment, you should keep it alive.\"I, speaking calmly, smiled broadly.Only one for everyone else. It is also a story that should not be told as much as the former king with silver hair who kept protecting me.The vampire's plan is now too late to stop.\"You. Let's have a party with me.\"\"What are you talking about?\"\"There's only one thing that fits you and I. What do you say? Do you want to try?\"He was silent at my question.\"You'll need a price.\"The quick-witted man seemed to have found something in a smile imbued with my madness.\"Yes, I need a price.\"\"What is it?\"At his question I quietly told him the most important price.It was just one thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Never step forward.\"\"......you're not gonna tell me what's going on?\"I shook my head quietly at the sight of him asking with a complicated expression.\"Trust what people say.

Let's go.\"\"Yes.\"Illina, who spoke calmly, followed me and looked at Reina, tilted her head and shouted at me at the subtle hint she had felt.\"Davie!\"I turned my head to her shouting from behind.\"Well, you know what? I don't know what you're trying to do. When it's all over, can you free up some time?\"\"Time?\"\"Yes, there's someone I really want to show you.\"She then dyed her cheeks slightly red.When she turned her head to such a fruitless figure and activated the magic, Persec, who was sitting on her shoulder and dozing, rubbed her eyes cutely.He's in conflict. My heart became restless when I saw him face to face. Just be honest with me. I mean you. Aren't you good at catching people's minds?'Well, I don't know.'Let's go.Tsu-fang!!For a moment, the space was twisted and the familiar forest was revealed again.Later, I could see the peacock and the tomb of the Blue Dragon sitting quietly waiting for me, and a giant monster recovering from the blue light between them.\"I've recovered a lot.\"[Humans] It's been a while since I've been here, so I'm in a hurry.]\"I have to take two of them.\"I'm amazed at the spirituality of these gods.

I have something for you to do.\"\"If you're an order. Even the neck of God.\"\"Don't be so harsh in front of the saints. From now on, Reina as men in action again.\"Then I took a large window out of the subspace and stuck it out to her.It was the new longinus, which was shaped like Unwol.Reina, who received Longinus without any vigilance, fell down with her eyes wide open.A pale face nearly collapsed, she instantly pulled Manna up, grabbed a spear, and looked up at me with a puzzled look.\"This... this is the weight...\"\"Usually, it's about 80kg, and you're not the owner, so it's about 300kg. You managed to hold it.\"\"Are you crazy? This is a weapon?\"\"Nothing in the world can destroy that ignorant man. You won't get a scratch. And, I think that's better for you.\"A heavy sword is a sword technique that uses heavy weapons.If he is as talented as Raina, there will be no big difference even if he is not a sex sword.The sword made of Helixium, a metal of God, was the world's highest weapon in terms of its strength, drawing tens of times the strength of Oryharcon, Adamantium, and hundreds of times the intensity of awakening.\"I'm half asleep.

How can he boast to everyone around him that his son is such a mature and wonderful son?On the surface, he was quite blunt and cold-spoken, but his behavior was a little strange to Yuri, who was famous for her love for her son.\"Father!

What's he talking about from the morning breeze?\"\"Oh... no!\"It was then.As soon as my son freaked out and shouted as if he had found something.The glass could see a huge shadow from the sky.Then, his body, which raised its head along the shadow, hardened.Why didn't I know?There are so many huge things.Not only Yuri looked at the sky with a blank face, but also the vigilantes who were guarding the goal looked at the sky. And most of them were of the same mind.Whispering!!!AndAs soon as the main character of the huge shadow flying in the sky dropped a huge roar, I felt the whole area of the ground shook.In the intense echo, Yuri could see something walking from the forest where her son had escaped.AndHe opened his eyes in dismay.What he saw was.It was simply an incalculable war of hell.Flaming...Then, as the hero of the giant shadow in the sky opened his mouth, red flames began to gather.Without a chance to avoid it, the fire hell was created in the land.* * *Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.The kingdom of Solbran, located on the southern tip of the western continent, collapsed in just a few days.The ripple effect of this one sentence shook the entire continent in an instant.It was a tremendous piece of all time.Not a single kingdom has been destroyed by war since the Continental Union, formed under the name of the Three Emperors, signed an agreement to eradicate war.Those who had been out of the war for a long time were slowly becoming indifferent to the real danger of war.Meanwhile, the news of the collapse of the small country Solbran was enough to spread throughout the continent through the mouths and mouths of countless people.The events of the southernmost maritime city of the eastern continent and the Undeed Changshu incident in the Palan Empire did not cause much repercussions because they did not know how dangerous the enemy's capture was, but this time it was different.the advent of the Black DragonThe army accompanying the dragon is a large army of hundreds of thousands, but the dragon, which turns hundreds of thousands of people into ashes at a time in Bresse, implies an unparalleled strength compared to the Frost worm before.There was only one direction they were heading.It was the eastern part of the continent.Their offensive of non-stop movement and random destruction posed a different level of danger than the rise of the undead of the former Palan Empire.And a few more days later, when a small small country headed east after Solvran was burned to ashes in another few days, the entire continent began to shake.Fortunately, the mysterious army of those who burned down the two countries stopped in the ruins of the kingdom's capital as if it were to replenish their strength for a while, but the power was not going anywhere.Of course, the Three Kingdoms, which could never let the situation go, quickly held a central conference of the Continental Union and called in the king's representatives of all countries who joined accordingly.Using the famous Lindis Empire air force, the kings and their representatives of each country began to move from all over the continent.And the fact remains the same in the Kingdom of Lounge.After Varys was elected as the king's deputy, I was selected in the name of the saint to attend the United Nations Conference.\"The King of the Louns! Prince Barris Allan and Prince Davey Allan are here!\"\"Come on, listen to me!\"In a hurry I opened the door without hesitation and went inside.There were dozens of nobles and royalty with mixed expressions turning to me.\"Honorless glory to His Majesty the Emperor.\"\"Welcome, Prince Davy.\"an old emperor who welcomes meI can see Emperor Deord. And behind him, Katherine Caravella, the usually slow-smiling queen, waved quietly.\"Ho... ..that boy is a troublemaker on the continent.\"Subsequently, a young man with brown skin sitting on the other side of the Emperor Lindis' empire identified me with his arms crossed with an imposing expression.In addition, the youngest crown prince in the center, the new crown prince of the Palan Empire. Salivan was quietly welcoming me.\"I would like to say hello to you, the twin dragons of the Lindis Empire, the little lions of the central Palan, and the Black Scorpion of the Western Continent.\"\"Black-and-white-carved... ...who knows Jim's stage name is rare in the Empire.\"He said it was interesting, but he couldn't leave his hand still for a moment.It was a great appearance of the Western Contas Empire, which had a great sense of triumph.\"I guess I'm the latest.\"I could see familiar characters sitting quietly on one side.the deputy king of the law from the Holy Land There was also Alice, who was a candidate for sex.She looked at me and bowed her head quietly to show her respect and then remained silent again.\"Let's start right away as it's happening.\"Although it was a gathering of two imperial emperors and representatives of all the national federations on the continent, I spoke to them without hesitation, heading to the seat assigned to me.\"I'll check before that.\"It was then.The young emperor, Contas the Great, who was quietly watching the situation as if it were funny, glared at me and said,\"Prince Davey the saint.\"\"Yes.\"Have you predicted the situation?\"\"Well.\"He gave me a ridiculous look when I responded with a smile.As if the discomfort was at its peak, two bearded men behind Contas Daeje pulled out Shamshir to stop him, but he raised his hand and stopped him.\"Don't take Jim's intelligence lightly. I understand that you have signed an agreement with the Crown Prince of the Palan Empire to fund the production of large amounts of weapons in Ammma-ri. Besides that, you invested a lot in the tower. Because of the mass production of the attack magic scroll.\"He's got a great piece of information.\"That means you've predicted and prepared for this, right? And there's no promise from other countries.\"I bowed my head quietly at the word.Are these people picking a fight at an important coalition meeting?\"The Great.\"\"......\"\"What is the purpose of asking such a question?\"When I asked him a question, a man jumped up.\"Excuse me...!\"Boom!!!However, the man, who was shouting in a hurry, collapsed under the light fist of King Contas.\"Does Jim dare to cut in on what he says? Okay, go ahead.\"\"That's an obvious answer. It's just a moderate estimate. It's obvious. I don't think the king would lie because it's an unimaginable situation.\"\"Your liver is swollen.

Salivan was quietly welcoming me.\"I would like to say hello to you, the twin dragons of the Lindis Empire, the little lions of the central Palan, and the Black Scorpion of the Western Continent.\"\"Black-and-white-carved... ...who knows Jim's stage name is rare in the Empire.\"He said it was interesting, but he couldn't leave his hand still for a moment.It was a great appearance of the Western Contas Empire, which had a great sense of triumph.\"I guess I'm the latest.\"I could see familiar characters sitting quietly on one side.the deputy king of the law from the Holy Land There was also Alice, who was a candidate for sex.She looked at me and bowed her head quietly to show her respect and then remained silent again.\"Let's start right away as it's happening.\"Although it was a gathering of two imperial emperors and representatives of all the national federations on the continent, I spoke to them without hesitation, heading to the seat assigned to me.\"I'll check before that.\"It was then.The young emperor, Contas the Great, who was quietly watching the situation as if it were funny, glared at me and said,\"Prince Davey the saint.\"\"Yes.\"Have you predicted the situation?\"\"Well.\"He gave me a ridiculous look when I responded with a smile.As if the discomfort was at its peak, two bearded men behind Contas Daeje pulled out Shamshir to stop him, but he raised his hand and stopped him.\"Don't take Jim's intelligence lightly. I understand that you have signed an agreement with the Crown Prince of the Palan Empire to fund the production of large amounts of weapons in Ammma-ri. Besides that, you invested a lot in the tower. Because of the mass production of the attack magic scroll.\"He's got a great piece of information.\"That means you've predicted and prepared for this, right? And there's no promise from other countries.\"I bowed my head quietly at the word.Are these people picking a fight at an important coalition meeting?\"The Great.\"\"......\"\"What is the purpose of asking such a question?\"When I asked him a question, a man jumped up.\"Excuse me...!\"Boom!!!However, the man, who was shouting in a hurry, collapsed under the light fist of King Contas.\"Does Jim dare to cut in on what he says? Okay, go ahead.\"\"That's an obvious answer. It's just a moderate estimate. It's obvious. I don't think the king would lie because it's an unimaginable situation.\"\"Your liver is swollen. Prince.\"People around me get nervous at the sight of the gentle anger is rising anger.I don't think he's judging the situation yet.\"I don't think he's got all the status reports yet.\"I erased the smile when I smiled brightly. Those who knew me turned pale at the sight.It's not that I don't know what you mean to say to me.\"If you're trying to get me off the hook, do it after the meeting.\"If you don't want to go behind, you're the Emperor of Daeje High School.\"If you have enough time for this unnutritive interrogation, I'll help you get a little more urgent.

It's not funny that 150,000 people are so wary of a human being like that's not funny.\"Mumbling coldly, he kicked Goblin hard on the back of his head as he walked with a vague gait nearby and murmured irritably.\"I'm not the body to do this kind of spy mission!

I'll let you eat the meat of the humans for dinner!\"The original mission was to examine the enemy's movements and tie their feet until additional troops came, but Gorgon had a different mind.With his armor-resistant self and this large force, he can defeat them at once.It was actually enough power.Thus, he did not stop the march itself, and he was able to find numerous human soldiers and cavalry watching him as if he were facing him in a large plain.\"It's going to be a boring war.\"I can't believe you came here without fear.Gorgon was about to give the order to march, thinking so.\"Hmm?\"The Manreb hero is coming back!the second installment of the 14th volume.Yuck!Reina's eyes widened at the beauty of the door, and everyone's eyes were on her.She looked calm in the gaze of the royal family and even the royal family, who had a large wall, who seemed to shrink.Her life was too rough to be intimidated by the gaze of countless people.I glanced at Salivan as she appeared with a huge unwoldo wrapped around her back.It was because I wondered if my brother, who cares terribly about his younger brother, might recognize him.\"Who is that woman?\"However, there was no one who judged Raina to be the same person as Illina, as to whether the curse worked properly.\"I'd like to say hello.

What a ridiculous thing to do.Gorgon's expression cooled with derision and contempt.\"Ha! Not funny guys. You're not afraid to stand in front of my forces? Ha!The number of troops was rather superior to the vampire side.The dominance of the actual number of people, which is about 40,000 to 50,000 at the most, was nearly double or triple that of vampires.Not to mention the level of soldiers pointed out by keen vision.It was qualitatively different from the army of vampires, who had been preparing for battle for a long time, and those cowards who crouched in fear and were busy looking around.the battle between the hobjjol and the well-trained armies of hellGorgon expressed both irritation and surprise at the recklessness of fighting even though there was a perfect difference enough for even children to know the outcome of the fight.in a twaddleIt was not long before a person riding a horse slowly walked out of the center of the human army.Then slowly, he took off his pitch.\"Isn't she a young lady?\"Gorgon's cry clearly recognized a woman with a sky-blue hair that took off her helmet.\"I have no fear of trying to stop this army!\"As the voice rang out without loudspeaker magic, the other side began to show considerable agitation.The feeling was a clear fear.The frightened soldiers are humming and afraid of each other.The stronger you push, the more scared you get.Gorgon approached the enemy's army with his spirited steps.As if escorting him, the human agitation became immense as the giant minotaurs of the skin of Sakaman followed.\"You're trembling, are you afraid of me? Hehehehehehehehehe, I will! You'll be scared! All the peace-stricken Neckats can do is scream and die helplessly!\"Soon after, the soldiers began to whisper in their ears.\"Oh, my God... What the hell are those monsters...\"\"How can I win if the numbers are already more than double...\"From trembling young men to old men standing with resigned faces.How urgent it was, the soldier's age deviation was a mess.Many soldiers were properly trained, but the number of soldiers who were conscripted urgently was overwhelming.\"Human girl, you'll also have to take a good look!

But you can be sure that it's not now.\"She continued, speaking calmly.\"We have only one purpose. It's for those stupid vampires who are so peace-stricken they can't do anything.\"How frightening the resistance of mankind is.Speaking calmly, she slowly lifts the undulating moon.Boom!!!At the same time, a golden air stream poured from the sky, and huge forces began to gather around her whole body.\"Hmm?\"Alarmed by the stronger power than expected, Gorgon could soon hear her.\"All men, have faith. In the name of the commander, I won't let anyone die easily. Cut the opponent and kill him. That's the only way to protect those who trust us and wait for us!\"With a calm cry, she slowly raised the unwol-do high.Then he took a step forward.\"God is with us. A noble man, empowered by the name of God, is helping us. We should not waste his efforts to protect humanity by himself.\"It was not long before she took another step in a calm voice.\"All troops. Charge.\"Soon after, with her cry, the soldiers began to move slowly, fearful.They are enemies that will threaten the foundation of mankind, not the fight between humans.It means that if you don't fight, you'll die, but it's the same.\"Erex bee! Yeah, once, twice!\"\"If you die here anyway, you'll be all searched! Let's go!!\"The feeling of killing and killing one more person who would rather die than running away for fear, which is half desperation, has spread strongly.Gorgon, the top vampire, didn't know. That's because of the existence of a dragon that has overwhelming power that makes them feel that it may really destroy the continent.Boom! Boom! Boom!The morale of the soldiers began to rise gradually, regularly hitting the giant Helveod's spears.Even though there was nothing blocking the back, the soldiers on the human side began to march in line with each other as if they had struck a drainage camp.\"All units! Spread your wedge-shaped camp!\"It was not long before the soldiers began to approach her cry, taking the form of a single spear in perfect order.Gorgon turned his head away with a cold laugh.\"Bite it, tear it apart. It is a shame to a proud aristocrat such as a fool who is being eaten.\"The lower vampires, who already thought they were winning, were not scared at all.Aside from the majestic advance of humans, the change in morale brought about by the confrontation between the fierce and relaxed vampire armies was certainly an overwhelming victory for vampires.But the change soon began to twist little by little.Boom!!A huge white wizard, hundreds of meters from the sky, began to emerge, led by Raina, the first warrior to rush in the lead.Gradually speeding up and shouting, the soldiers and cavalry rushed to the scene with their grim faces as if they had not found a huge magic line stretching out from the sky.Andwhen the two armies reached the point of collision at any momentSoon after, pure white magicians made in the sky began to scatter huge pieces of light, forming dozens and hundreds.The truly horrifying divine buff magic soon became surrounded by all human soldiers, and soldiers who did not notice their change at once began to rush like men whose lives ran on alert and exercised superhuman power.Something's wrong.Feeling it instinctively, Gorgon stepped back without realizing it and distorted his expression.This can't be happening.I don't know what that white magic pearl is, but I could see one thing for sure.If you don't stop that right now, you'll be in big trouble.It was about time for him to rush up his energy to prevent the activation of the Magic Circle.Yikes!!!Gorgon opened his eyes to the huge roar from the sky.A huge bird of flame coming down from the sky crossed the army of vampires exactly and inserted the ultra-high-temperature flame Bress directly.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"The unidentified buff magicians are marching fearlessly. In addition, a huge fire bird from the sky.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Frustrated, Gorgon looked blank as he could not accept all the unexpected changes in the war situation.And even before he shouted something out of the blue.Realizing that his body was overwhelmingly lightened, the fighting spirit began to burn surprisingly in the eyes of the human soldiers.\"Dead!!!\"\"To protect my family!\"\"The saint and the warrior are together!!\"with one's cryGorgon could see.The nettle-type attackers of human soldiers, who were less than half in number, immediately enter by pushing their own troops, who were proud, brave and ferocious.* * *\"Are you all right?\"I watched the situation quietly at the words of Alice, the sex candidate who led the priesthood to join the war.On the surface, it was a battlefield where the human side seemed to be at a disadvantage.In addition, he showed a sense that shook the psychology of the soldiers.\"The sacred magic of the priesthood doesn't reach all of this.

Even if you're watching from so far away...\"\"Oh, my God... I'm afraid we're all gonna die.\"\"I have to talk to the Holy Lady and the Holy Father and join the ranks.\"I was watching the situation, ignoring the murmuring words, and turned away when I saw Raina silently lifting Longinus and starting to move.\"Alice, let's get started.\"\"What?\"\"We need to pave the way for a turnaround.\"I, who spoke calmly, clasped my hands strongly and closed my eyes.Boom!!At the same time, a white air began to burst out of my whole body.[To save countless innocent people, let's make a half loan of grace on 36-month interest-free installments.][Ninth Eccentric Last Vocalization.][\u1109\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1174 \u1109\u1165\u11bc\u110b\u1167\u11a8(Sain Sanctuary)]Argh!!!A sacred area that makes the viewer's eyes wide open begins to activate for a moment.\"What the... ...\"The priests looked at me with surprise when they realized that the power of the divine magic they saw in person was far beyond the level of the divine magic they knew.In response, I said after creating a passage that connects the place where the priests are and the plain where the soldiers fight.\"What are you doing?

What a ridiculous thing to do.Gorgon's expression cooled with derision and contempt.\"Ha! Not funny guys. You're not afraid to stand in front of my forces? Ha!The number of troops was rather superior to the vampire side.The dominance of the actual number of people, which is about 40,000 to 50,000 at the most, was nearly double or triple that of vampires.Not to mention the level of soldiers pointed out by keen vision.It was qualitatively different from the army of vampires, who had been preparing for battle for a long time, and those cowards who crouched in fear and were busy looking around.the battle between the hobjjol and the well-trained armies of hellGorgon expressed both irritation and surprise at the recklessness of fighting even though there was a perfect difference enough for even children to know the outcome of the fight.in a twaddleIt was not long before a person riding a horse slowly walked out of the center of the human army.Then slowly, he took off his pitch.\"Isn't she a young lady?\"Gorgon's cry clearly recognized a woman with a sky-blue hair that took off her helmet.\"I have no fear of trying to stop this army!\"As the voice rang out without loudspeaker magic, the other side began to show considerable agitation.The feeling was a clear fear.The frightened soldiers are humming and afraid of each other.The stronger you push, the more scared you get.Gorgon approached the enemy's army with his spirited steps.As if escorting him, the human agitation became immense as the giant minotaurs of the skin of Sakaman followed.\"You're trembling, are you afraid of me? Hehehehehehehehehe, I will! You'll be scared! All the peace-stricken Neckats can do is scream and die helplessly!\"Soon after, the soldiers began to whisper in their ears.\"Oh, my God... What the hell are those monsters...\"\"How can I win if the numbers are already more than double...\"From trembling young men to old men standing with resigned faces.How urgent it was, the soldier's age deviation was a mess.Many soldiers were properly trained, but the number of soldiers who were conscripted urgently was overwhelming.\"Human girl, you'll also have to take a good look! Because of your stupid judgment, all the people who believed and followed you will be brutally torn and eaten! Four years will also be inevitable, Khhhhhhhhhhhh, don't worry. I'll suck the blood and kill you for as long as I've been dried and twisted myself!\"As the red air began to flow through his whole body, there began to be a heavy flesh of evil around him.Despite this situation, however, she got off her horse with her pitching off and slowly untied the large unwalled cloth on her back as if she was not interested.\"Listen, soldier.\"It was not long before I heard the voice of Raina, who untied all the cloth.\"You'll be afraid. You'll be scared. Enemy numbers are more than our own. Each risk will be higher than any previous event.\"Gorgon slowly turned back to his camp and gave a cold sneer at her calm speaking.\"Maybe all of you will die. But you can be sure that it's not now.\"She continued, speaking calmly.\"We have only one purpose. It's for those stupid vampires who are so peace-stricken they can't do anything.\"How frightening the resistance of mankind is.Speaking calmly, she slowly lifts the undulating moon.Boom!!!At the same time, a golden air stream poured from the sky, and huge forces began to gather around her whole body.\"Hmm?\"Alarmed by the stronger power than expected, Gorgon could soon hear her.\"All men, have faith. In the name of the commander, I won't let anyone die easily. Cut the opponent and kill him. That's the only way to protect those who trust us and wait for us!\"With a calm cry, she slowly raised the unwol-do high.Then he took a step forward.\"God is with us. A noble man, empowered by the name of God, is helping us. We should not waste his efforts to protect humanity by himself.\"It was not long before she took another step in a calm voice.\"All troops. Charge.\"Soon after, with her cry, the soldiers began to move slowly, fearful.They are enemies that will threaten the foundation of mankind, not the fight between humans.It means that if you don't fight, you'll die, but it's the same.\"Erex bee! Yeah, once, twice!\"\"If you die here anyway, you'll be all searched! Let's go!!\"The feeling of killing and killing one more person who would rather die than running away for fear, which is half desperation, has spread strongly.Gorgon, the top vampire, didn't know. That's because of the existence of a dragon that has overwhelming power that makes them feel that it may really destroy the continent.Boom! Boom! Boom!The morale of the soldiers began to rise gradually, regularly hitting the giant Helveod's spears.Even though there was nothing blocking the back, the soldiers on the human side began to march in line with each other as if they had struck a drainage camp.\"All units! Spread your wedge-shaped camp!\"It was not long before the soldiers began to approach her cry, taking the form of a single spear in perfect order.Gorgon turned his head away with a cold laugh.\"Bite it, tear it apart. It is a shame to a proud aristocrat such as a fool who is being eaten.\"The lower vampires, who already thought they were winning, were not scared at all.Aside from the majestic advance of humans, the change in morale brought about by the confrontation between the fierce and relaxed vampire armies was certainly an overwhelming victory for vampires.But the change soon began to twist little by little.Boom!!A huge white wizard, hundreds of meters from the sky, began to emerge, led by Raina, the first warrior to rush in the lead.Gradually speeding up and shouting, the soldiers and cavalry rushed to the scene with their grim faces as if they had not found a huge magic line stretching out from the sky.Andwhen the two armies reached the point of collision at any momentSoon after, pure white magicians made in the sky began to scatter huge pieces of light, forming dozens and hundreds.The truly horrifying divine buff magic soon became surrounded by all human soldiers, and soldiers who did not notice their change at once began to rush like men whose lives ran on alert and exercised superhuman power.Something's wrong.Feeling it instinctively, Gorgon stepped back without realizing it and distorted his expression.This can't be happening.I don't know what that white magic pearl is, but I could see one thing for sure.If you don't stop that right now, you'll be in big trouble.It was about time for him to rush up his energy to prevent the activation of the Magic Circle.Yikes!!!Gorgon opened his eyes to the huge roar from the sky.A huge bird of flame coming down from the sky crossed the army of vampires exactly and inserted the ultra-high-temperature flame Bress directly.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"The unidentified buff magicians are marching fearlessly.

Even if you're watching from so far away...\"\"Oh, my God... I'm afraid we're all gonna die.\"\"I have to talk to the Holy Lady and the Holy Father and join the ranks.\"I was watching the situation, ignoring the murmuring words, and turned away when I saw Raina silently lifting Longinus and starting to move.\"Alice, let's get started.\"\"What?\"\"We need to pave the way for a turnaround.\"I, who spoke calmly, clasped my hands strongly and closed my eyes.Boom!!At the same time, a white air began to burst out of my whole body.[To save countless innocent people, let's make a half loan of grace on 36-month interest-free installments.][Ninth Eccentric Last Vocalization.][\u1109\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1174 \u1109\u1165\u11bc\u110b\u1167\u11a8(Sain Sanctuary)]Argh!!!A sacred area that makes the viewer's eyes wide open begins to activate for a moment.\"What the... ...\"The priests looked at me with surprise when they realized that the power of the divine magic they saw in person was far beyond the level of the divine magic they knew.In response, I said after creating a passage that connects the place where the priests are and the plain where the soldiers fight.\"What are you doing?

Soldiers who once clashed with the huge, sacred firebirds that appeared to help themselves.I no longer fear the space where white feathers fly as if I were seeing a miracle of God.The old man, who used to be sarcastic, showed such great power that he has been working out for a long time.\"Oh, you bastards! Even if I die, I'm coming with you guys!\"The old man, who shouted and threw a helicopter at him, snatched the jaw of a huge dark wolf with his bare hands, twisted it to death, and swung the body of a huge dark wolf like a blunt instrument.It was too overwhelming to be seen as coming from the old man's body.But hundreds of white magicians activated in the sky made it possible.\"Ahem! Ahem! Ahem!The boy, who became a mercenary at a young age and participated in the battlefield, roamed around as if he were cutting everything when he was caught in an overwhelming body-enhancing buff after his skillful swordsmanship, which he had been training to fill his deficiency.The first wedge formation had long since disappeared.However, the battlefield was already so chaotic that it was meaningless.It was a disaster itself that many people fought with huge buffs on their backs.Boohoohoohoohooh!!The black minotaurs, who swept the human race with their hand-held blunt instruments with a huge cry, soon jumped up as if they had been fatally wounded and stepped back as if they were tired of the zombies.Just a swarm of ants!The result was obvious as long as there were far fewer numbers and each one was suspiciously human.\"Hey, this is... this is ridiculous...\"Moreover, the biggest problem was none other than the two....quadding!!!Dozens of people are swept away in half if they lose in a single batch.Reina, the hero at the forefront of the battlefield, was simply a terrible monster.Her presence of covering up the golden-white oracle-blade on Unwoldo Island ended at once those who questioned whether she was so strong.Yikes!!!And so did the giant firebird, like her, who roamed the entire battlefield and shook off its great grandeur.\"Hey, this is ridiculous...\"Gorgon stared blankly at the bird of flame, flying in the sky and turning the eroded Wyverns into ashes in an instant.It is not easy to kill each soldier. Their commander, the human woman, was a frightening strongman far beyond Gorgon's expectations, and the bird of fire, presumed to be an unidentified Phoenix, unilaterally burned Gorgon's army without harming humans at all.No matter how weak it is as an advance team, it was still not this one.Considering the level and number of powerful blood horse-riding and horse-riding monsters, it should never have happened.However, humans created this situation as if they had been waiting.\"Hey, you guys!!!\"Outraged, he threw a nearby man's neck away.I am getting goose bumps at the power of the damn recovery, but if I die immediately, there is no way to save the recovery magic.\"Dead! You punk!\"\"You're dead!Which means,It was like saying that if you don't die, you'll surely survive.Therefore, it was a natural result that soldiers' fighting spirit went up in real time.Gorgon, who had been cutting to death at random, soon swept away the crowds of vampires and took a step back when he saw Reina approaching.It's not a fight with that crazy-powerful human woman.You have to run.Instinct calls for retreat immediately, but reason held it.He was the one who violated the order of the main force and made a first attack.And not only were they defeated, but they also led to a significant increase in their morale.Even if you live, the result of your return will be nothing but miserable disgrace and death.Reina, who came slowly toward Gorgon, who had been hardened, pointed at the end of Longinus' spear at him.Then he spoke quietly.\"That's what my silversmith said.\"\"......\"\"The empty cart is noisy. You're pretty weak-kneed for a jaw drop.\"\"Hey, you damn X!\"Furious at Reina's provocation, Gorgon left both reason and instinct to anger and quickly penetrated into her.Whaaaaah!Then he pulled out a huge sword and struck her and screamed like crazy.\"Four years!

I couldn't help but feel hopeless.Even so, there could not have been surrender or retreat for vampires who had the pride of the nobility.Unlike the number of deaths and bloodshed, vampires eventually held out until the last one collapsed.Sue was nearly three times the battle, but as a result of hitting each other without retreat, one side was completely destroyed.Reina shook her head as she watched Longinus, who had been so ignorant and frightened that she couldn't breathe and shake her head.It's really incredible durability.\"Speaking calmly, she soon stood absentmindedly and slowly lifted the spearhead toward the soldiers looking at her.a declaration of victoryAt the same time, tremendous cheers began to burst from all sides.\"Wow!!!\"The soldiers' morale soared as if they had been literally hit by drugs when the fight, which they thought would be absolutely defeated, became such an absurd victory.It wasn't just a win, it was a plus for winning in an amazing way.\"Long live the warrior Reina!!!\"It was not long before there were some cries of praise from the soldiers.\"Hurrah!\"Originally, the person who provided the buff should be praised the most.As if to induce this situation on purpose, he only watched the situation as slowly as he could from the eyes of the soldiers.* * *Lady candidate Alice could soon feel how much he had done.The divine magic he used was the divine magic of a line she had never seen before.No, to be exact, I've seen the traces.When the events of the Duchy of Felesti broke out in the past.At that time, it was rumored to be a divine magic that broke out when the Iliana Empress Caldiras awakened.Alice had a good feeling of how rubbish it was.It was widely believed that the saint in front of him was a real exhaust monster.\"Oh, my God... what did I see in that short time?\"\"Oh, God.\"An intermediate priest of the Priya Church, who had participated in the war to treat the wounded, spoke to Alice with an incredible face.\"Oh, my God... ...is I seeing a miracle from God?\"\"What the hell is he...\"\"No matter how much you're a saint, it's really shocking.\"\"I've been reluctant to follow Alice because she believes in her, but I'm really... ashamed of myself.\"He did not participate in the war games himself, but he turned the tables of the war by himself.The soldiers see it all as a miracle created by Raina, but the priests who were looking from the outside could tell.The man who really ended this war.It's not the warrior Reina, but the saint David who was watching the situation from afar.How can he perform miracles that even the Pope of the Holy Land can't do at such a young age?\"Kuluck...\"At that time, when Prince Davy slightly twisted his body, respect began to grow in the eyes of the priests.\"Oh, my God... he doesn't even take care of himself...\"\"Ah... God's grace.\"In fact, I sneezed because of the dust, but it didn't matter to the priests who were already wet.Is this really the true face of the saint who was rumored to be on the continent?I thought so, but there were also things I couldn't understand.Leaving him alone looking at the war situation, the priests waited for Alice to lead them.And Alice, the sex candidate who was watching the situation without a word, slowly opened her mouth.\"A saint is the recipient of God's man.\"\"But...\"\"And the more you love life, the stronger you are.\"At the words, the priests dazed and soon opened their eyes wide.Then he made a face that he was touched.\"Oh, my God... then from him...\"\"How much do you love the world?\"Even the Pope of the Holy Land gave up the power he couldn't even imagine.Priests did not understand how absurd the divine magic used by a man named Davy was because they had never used it or actually had never seen it.I just thought it was amazing, amazing.\"But I was really surprised.

How could she do this to me?!\"Illina, who was gazing at the empty cabin, nervously tried to swing a giant sword, not Caldiras, but stopped.Oh, my God!But her sword did not stop completely, so the tip of the luxury wooden table in her room was cut sharply.Nevertheless, she was bragging about her anger.Disposal of absenteeism and tardiness dispositionIt was like a bolt out of the blue for Illina.Suddenly, my brother released the prince from the palace and attacked the quiet cabin where Belial was.Illina, who regularly dropped by the cabin to get Belial some medicine, heard the news late.By the time she arrived, Belial had already fled.There was no reason to keep him around in the first place.When she first found him, she was in danger of dying right away, so she brought him in.Even if the injury was not completely cured, she judged that she would not die anywhere herself as long as she had more than Sodmaster-class power.However, he was a good friend of the story who listened to the story silently.He was a man who could be a good friend in a different sense from Davy.I didn't mean to kick him out like this. The furious Illinois went to my brother's to pick a quarrel with him about everything.And I could hear it.He visited Illinois after hearing that there was something disturbing enough to violate the imperial spirit.And there he said he actually found Belial.Illina rebuked the imperial dignity, and eventually she was imprisoned by the royal court.Of course, even though she escaped, Illina's long experience with a psycho child allowed her to infer the true culprit of the incident.Davy O'Loon.This bad boy went to Saliban and told him everything about Belial.It made her unable to get away from the palace.Why did he do this?I couldn't understand it even in retrospect.No, I couldn't have known.It's a device to get Belial to leave Illinois after the deal with Belial is made.In additionWhen I heard that the enemy was a vampire, I knew how she would turn out, so I tied her to the palace.Illina was just a girl who thought in the normal human category to infer such facts without a clue.Calm down, Illina. He was meant to leave anyway, wasn't he?]\"It's not Belial that I'm angry! Davy's son beat me in the back of the head. Why is he always so impatient with me?\"Caldiras answered the cry with a clear air.I've heard it from Harres before.

I don't care about him anymore.\"[Hmm......really?]\"Yes\"[I've told you lie is bad...]At the words of Caldiras, who breathed a sigh, Illina blushed her face as if she were a child who had been caught.She came carelessly, looked after her condition, and trained her lungs too hard, so in fact, there were some unpleasant things left in her body.Davy is.I noticed that right away.I made an excuse to say, \"I don't know what to do with my hands,\" and I solved it on the spot.Honestly, how much help did you get from him?He said no. She also shook her head when she tried to propose to him on the spur of the moment.As time went by, I thought it was okay, but every time I met him, I felt different and different, so I couldn't shake off my complicated feelings.\"Down!

Let's get started.\"Bam!!!Group A of the Alpha Knights of the Reinforce was a regular group of young boys and girls.However, they were children who passed the formal examination and became regular members, and were basically talented men and girls of their own age.In an instant, the spirit technique performed by the twin sisters of the Spirit Temple moves.The pre-soaked liquid medicine spread like a bubble and began to permeate quickly in the wind of Silaim, the intermediate spirit of the wind.Most of the knights have already seen and confirmed the efficacy of the virus created by an unprecedented new member of a monster named Davy.It doesn't work for all living things, but the only virus that can only be found in the blood of vampires and vampires...\"S, it's a raid!\"\"Hold it! The humans!\"As soon as the lower vampires, who were moving quickly and quietly, shouted out loud, the saint Pildir, who was holding a shield in front of him, dug in at a tremendous speed like a dump truck and hit a vampire in front of him.Although the current drivers of Group A are not lacking in skills, strengthened vampires cannot be killed at once.Careful not to say that it is to have killed by a ball all to death are well aware.As such, vampires now had a viability that exceeded their knowledge of the existence of vampires.But this time, the purpose was not to kill them.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"When a sharp sword penetrated and cut off a vampire, he frowned and pulled his arm back.At the same time, dozens of blood horses penetrated the knights, but the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha worked together as if they had been waiting and prevented their offensive.In the meantime, the wind of the water droplets of twin sisters still swept the whole country.\"You rat bastards!!!\"Vampires, who had a fever over the behavior of tying their feet without attacking due to absolute schedule, began to grind their teeth and exude blood.\"Up to here!

You ran away!\"Starting with him, who seemed angry, those who regained their sight looked around, but none of the young humans who had taken them by surprise were seen.An infuriated by the fact that he was completely misled by the guerrilla war, a vampire began to vent his blood all over his body.\"Okay!

It's a little... weird.\"\"Didn't you forget to eat?\"He shook his head at the question of his fellow lower vampire.\"That's not true. Is this mission actually a little risky?

That's a stupid greeting.\"\"Even if you do...\"While talking, he grabbed his stomach and bowed down.\"Luck...\"\"Huh? Hey! What's wrong with you?\"A bewildered fellow sub-vampire shouted, patting him on the back.However, he couldn't move easily and breathed out roughly.\"You... you'really.He seemed to have felt something was wrong with his body, but he hardened his words.A fellow vampire, curious about the sudden silence, was about to help him.Yaaaah!!Suddenly, the vampire, who was bending his back, jumped up and bit off his fellow vampire's arm.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhh! He's crazy! What's wrong with you!\"Surprised, he hurriedly pulled out his arm, but his arm was dripping with vampire-like blood, as if he had been stabbed properly.\"Uh, uh, what did I... ...\"\"Hey.

A-ing...\"The grumbling vampires did not know.Not only that, but most vampires are in the same situation.Reports from the Reinforce Alpha Knights began to come up.Aside from vampires who have continued to advance like rocks with eggs to keep me tied to the main stage, the fact that the Byeoldongdae is moving to all parts of the continent.Since we already knew where they were coming from, it was obvious that they would be on the road.I took control of the wind in the sky through the Qurungi and told the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha to raid them.In the meantime, they let go of the additional offerings.All they want is a hateful sacrifice.It's selfish to think that most of them are criminals or people who cause big problems, but I was going to use them as they are.The first sacrifices were immediately used to destroy them, but doing more than that would only hamper the plan.I flicked my finger as I watched Reina move the troops to the main.It's almost time for the news to come.Vampire Star Dongdae was planted with viruses.And the virus that would trigger it also seeped through the blood horse water that I revived with a rebib.NowThe result will come out.\"Oh, my God!

Even if I die, I'm coming with you guys!\"The old man, who shouted and threw a helicopter at him, snatched the jaw of a huge dark wolf with his bare hands, twisted it to death, and swung the body of a huge dark wolf like a blunt instrument.It was too overwhelming to be seen as coming from the old man's body.But hundreds of white magicians activated in the sky made it possible.\"Ahem! Ahem! Ahem!The boy, who became a mercenary at a young age and participated in the battlefield, roamed around as if he were cutting everything when he was caught in an overwhelming body-enhancing buff after his skillful swordsmanship, which he had been training to fill his deficiency.The first wedge formation had long since disappeared.However, the battlefield was already so chaotic that it was meaningless.It was a disaster itself that many people fought with huge buffs on their backs.Boohoohoohoohooh!!The black minotaurs, who swept the human race with their hand-held blunt instruments with a huge cry, soon jumped up as if they had been fatally wounded and stepped back as if they were tired of the zombies.Just a swarm of ants!The result was obvious as long as there were far fewer numbers and each one was suspiciously human.\"Hey, this is... this is ridiculous...\"Moreover, the biggest problem was none other than the two....quadding!!!Dozens of people are swept away in half if they lose in a single batch.Reina, the hero at the forefront of the battlefield, was simply a terrible monster.Her presence of covering up the golden-white oracle-blade on Unwoldo Island ended at once those who questioned whether she was so strong.Yikes!!!And so did the giant firebird, like her, who roamed the entire battlefield and shook off its great grandeur.\"Hey, this is ridiculous...\"Gorgon stared blankly at the bird of flame, flying in the sky and turning the eroded Wyverns into ashes in an instant.It is not easy to kill each soldier. Their commander, the human woman, was a frightening strongman far beyond Gorgon's expectations, and the bird of fire, presumed to be an unidentified Phoenix, unilaterally burned Gorgon's army without harming humans at all.No matter how weak it is as an advance team, it was still not this one.Considering the level and number of powerful blood horse-riding and horse-riding monsters, it should never have happened.However, humans created this situation as if they had been waiting.\"Hey, you guys!!!\"Outraged, he threw a nearby man's neck away.I am getting goose bumps at the power of the damn recovery, but if I die immediately, there is no way to save the recovery magic.\"Dead! You punk!\"\"You're dead!Which means,It was like saying that if you don't die, you'll surely survive.Therefore, it was a natural result that soldiers' fighting spirit went up in real time.Gorgon, who had been cutting to death at random, soon swept away the crowds of vampires and took a step back when he saw Reina approaching.It's not a fight with that crazy-powerful human woman.You have to run.Instinct calls for retreat immediately, but reason held it.He was the one who violated the order of the main force and made a first attack.And not only were they defeated, but they also led to a significant increase in their morale.Even if you live, the result of your return will be nothing but miserable disgrace and death.Reina, who came slowly toward Gorgon, who had been hardened, pointed at the end of Longinus' spear at him.Then he spoke quietly.\"That's what my silversmith said.\"\"......\"\"The empty cart is noisy. You're pretty weak-kneed for a jaw drop.\"\"Hey, you damn X!\"Furious at Reina's provocation, Gorgon left both reason and instinct to anger and quickly penetrated into her.Whaaaaah!Then he pulled out a huge sword and struck her and screamed like crazy.\"Four years! I will tear you to death with this hand! I will tear him to death and drink blood!\"Reina, who had taken his sword without saying a word at his onslaught, saw madness and pushed in, soon took a familiar step.Then he quietly blew up Manna and pulled her up.[Serious Prosecutor][Breaking mountains]Boom!!!a sword of overwhelming weightAlthough it was made of spears, not of a sword, the weight of Longinus' spear was overwhelmingly heavy, instantly cutting off Gorgon's sword and splitting his body in half.It was so strong that there was a huge hole of several meters from where he was standing.After the death of a man who led a large army of 150,000 people, it was in vain.Of course, vampires who lost their heads had no choice but to be confused.Even the lowest-ranked vampires are more powerful than humans.But all of them could not withstand the power of the lunatic humans, who were engulfed in buff magic, and were swept away at random.In the meantime, their conductor died. I couldn't help but feel hopeless.Even so, there could not have been surrender or retreat for vampires who had the pride of the nobility.Unlike the number of deaths and bloodshed, vampires eventually held out until the last one collapsed.Sue was nearly three times the battle, but as a result of hitting each other without retreat, one side was completely destroyed.Reina shook her head as she watched Longinus, who had been so ignorant and frightened that she couldn't breathe and shake her head.It's really incredible durability.\"Speaking calmly, she soon stood absentmindedly and slowly lifted the spearhead toward the soldiers looking at her.a declaration of victoryAt the same time, tremendous cheers began to burst from all sides.\"Wow!!!\"The soldiers' morale soared as if they had been literally hit by drugs when the fight, which they thought would be absolutely defeated, became such an absurd victory.It wasn't just a win, it was a plus for winning in an amazing way.\"Long live the warrior Reina!!!\"It was not long before there were some cries of praise from the soldiers.\"Hurrah!\"Originally, the person who provided the buff should be praised the most.As if to induce this situation on purpose, he only watched the situation as slowly as he could from the eyes of the soldiers.* * *Lady candidate Alice could soon feel how much he had done.The divine magic he used was the divine magic of a line she had never seen before.No, to be exact, I've seen the traces.When the events of the Duchy of Felesti broke out in the past.At that time, it was rumored to be a divine magic that broke out when the Iliana Empress Caldiras awakened.Alice had a good feeling of how rubbish it was.It was widely believed that the saint in front of him was a real exhaust monster.\"Oh, my God... what did I see in that short time?\"\"Oh, God.\"An intermediate priest of the Priya Church, who had participated in the war to treat the wounded, spoke to Alice with an incredible face.\"Oh, my God... ...is I seeing a miracle from God?\"\"What the hell is he...\"\"No matter how much you're a saint, it's really shocking.\"\"I've been reluctant to follow Alice because she believes in her, but I'm really... ashamed of myself.\"He did not participate in the war games himself, but he turned the tables of the war by himself.The soldiers see it all as a miracle created by Raina, but the priests who were looking from the outside could tell.The man who really ended this war.It's not the warrior Reina, but the saint David who was watching the situation from afar.How can he perform miracles that even the Pope of the Holy Land can't do at such a young age?\"Kuluck...\"At that time, when Prince Davy slightly twisted his body, respect began to grow in the eyes of the priests.\"Oh, my God... he doesn't even take care of himself...\"\"Ah... God's grace.\"In fact, I sneezed because of the dust, but it didn't matter to the priests who were already wet.Is this really the true face of the saint who was rumored to be on the continent?I thought so, but there were also things I couldn't understand.Leaving him alone looking at the war situation, the priests waited for Alice to lead them.And Alice, the sex candidate who was watching the situation without a word, slowly opened her mouth.\"A saint is the recipient of God's man.\"\"But...\"\"And the more you love life, the stronger you are.\"At the words, the priests dazed and soon opened their eyes wide.Then he made a face that he was touched.\"Oh, my God... then from him...\"\"How much do you love the world?\"Even the Pope of the Holy Land gave up the power he couldn't even imagine.Priests did not understand how absurd the divine magic used by a man named Davy was because they had never used it or actually had never seen it.I just thought it was amazing, amazing.\"But I was really surprised. I can't believe I'm going to reinforce every single one of those soldiers on this street.\"\"That's true.

Goddess Priest. Forgive me for being arrogant...\"\"Thank you forever for your sublime...\"\"God will be with you...\"Believe what you want to believe.Alice thought so.No matter how saint he was, his power was real and I could see how noblely he tried to be.I'm saying this over and over again. The illusion is the freedom of each person.\"Cough, click\"Why do you sneeze like that?\"Someone must be cursing at me.\"It's understandable. I'm sure by now she's been chewing on you.They may be feeling betrayed and shuddering.However, for Illinois, it was better not to participate in the war.Because there's nothing good about revenge?No way.Revenge is sweet, and achieving it neatly and finding the next goal is also life's vitality.What do you call counseling?He meant that such words were not used as old words for nothing.But this kind of ignorant war will be hard to come.I can, but it was true that the more I was stranded here, the more advantageous that side would be.Looking back at the ruined plains with the Allies turning back with the victory news, I reached for numerous vampires, bloodshed, and beasts of the horse world who had fallen dead in the blood.If I had just moved in the name of a saint.It's time to move as a black-and-white colonel.Taking out a small reagent from the subspace, I poked the reagent into the affected parts of several hematopoietic beasts and reached out quietly.[Revive]A magic different from the Spiritual Resurrection Magic that brings the undead back.It is an unfinished magic created before death by a commander who spent his life trying to save his dead wife.After all, he couldn't use this magic to his wife because he had to live up to the expectations of his death.I don't care what they look like to me right now.Boong!!As soon as the black mana penetrated, several blood horsehorses, which had become bodies like electronics with charged batteries, sprang up.Then he moves about with a ferocious air. They gathered quietly when they found me.\"Go back to your homes.\"Go, bite everything and infect them.Don't regard zombie apocalypse as a disaster for humans.I'll assist you with your, your, your, your abyss biological virus.Originally, these viruses cannot exist in common sense.Like a virus that only responds to vampires and related hulmasters.Such a narrow-minded virus is something you can only see in movies, but it is less efficient and less practical.Above all, the truth is that the world's rules can't just leave such unconscious things unattended.But the life of the abyss I have is the life of the world behind the dog's disregard for such rules.It was originally a method that I discovered while doing an experiment that I wanted to control at my own discretion by undetecting some of his flesh.The problem was that the undetected virus turned into a zombie virus.After collecting viral eggs in a reversed virus in the wake of extraterritorial forces, not the rules of the world, I transformed it into a surprise gift for vampires.There are still a lot of side effects and a lot of risks.It's none of my business.With the rapidly disappearing hematoma behind me, I took out the crystal ball and tried to connect it.Davey, that black dragon.

Her presence will receive the attention of all countries and every single one of her actions will have a great impact.That way, you can often use her methods on this side by side.Can't you lower yourself?Monopoly of interest is an unexpectedly troublesome task.It's a vicious and vicious way, but Reina has made every effort to be praised as a warrior.They will only be rewarded accordingly.\"It's me, Davey.\"[David] I've been waiting for your call.]\"We're all set up here.\"[They're starting to move] We've put the virus in a surprise guerrilla operation in their path.

Therefore, the Knights decided not to reveal themselves to the world, but to prevent them from being hidden.Moving in secret, interfering with their behavior.

How could she do this to me?!\"Illina, who was gazing at the empty cabin, nervously tried to swing a giant sword, not Caldiras, but stopped.Oh, my God!But her sword did not stop completely, so the tip of the luxury wooden table in her room was cut sharply.Nevertheless, she was bragging about her anger.Disposal of absenteeism and tardiness dispositionIt was like a bolt out of the blue for Illina.Suddenly, my brother released the prince from the palace and attacked the quiet cabin where Belial was.Illina, who regularly dropped by the cabin to get Belial some medicine, heard the news late.By the time she arrived, Belial had already fled.There was no reason to keep him around in the first place.When she first found him, she was in danger of dying right away, so she brought him in.Even if the injury was not completely cured, she judged that she would not die anywhere herself as long as she had more than Sodmaster-class power.However, he was a good friend of the story who listened to the story silently.He was a man who could be a good friend in a different sense from Davy.I didn't mean to kick him out like this. The furious Illinois went to my brother's to pick a quarrel with him about everything.And I could hear it.He visited Illinois after hearing that there was something disturbing enough to violate the imperial spirit.And there he said he actually found Belial.Illina rebuked the imperial dignity, and eventually she was imprisoned by the royal court.Of course, even though she escaped, Illina's long experience with a psycho child allowed her to infer the true culprit of the incident.Davy O'Loon.This bad boy went to Saliban and told him everything about Belial.It made her unable to get away from the palace.Why did he do this?I couldn't understand it even in retrospect.No, I couldn't have known.It's a device to get Belial to leave Illinois after the deal with Belial is made.In additionWhen I heard that the enemy was a vampire, I knew how she would turn out, so I tied her to the palace.Illina was just a girl who thought in the normal human category to infer such facts without a clue.Calm down, Illina. He was meant to leave anyway, wasn't he?]\"It's not Belial that I'm angry! Davy's son beat me in the back of the head. Why is he always so impatient with me?\"Caldiras answered the cry with a clear air.I've heard it from Harres before. I have a preference like a child who likes to bully me.\"......\"The words hardened Illinois' body.[Maybe that's what Davey is like?]Illina blushed at the question.Then he shook his head.\"Who, who accepted that you were interested in? I don't care about him anymore.\"[Hmm......really?]\"Yes\"[I've told you lie is bad...]At the words of Caldiras, who breathed a sigh, Illina blushed her face as if she were a child who had been caught.She came carelessly, looked after her condition, and trained her lungs too hard, so in fact, there were some unpleasant things left in her body.Davy is.I noticed that right away.I made an excuse to say, \"I don't know what to do with my hands,\" and I solved it on the spot.Honestly, how much help did you get from him?He said no. She also shook her head when she tried to propose to him on the spur of the moment.As time went by, I thought it was okay, but every time I met him, I felt different and different, so I couldn't shake off my complicated feelings.\"Down! Down!\"Illina, who was sitting annoyingly in a chair and savoring her car combatively, tilted her head at the sight of her exclusive girl rushing in.\"What's going on?\"\"So, did you hear that?\" Snake, vampire! A monster named Vampire appeared...\"The royal palace is rather quick to hear from.However, Illinois belatedly learned the news.\"What... what do you mean?\"When she jumped out of her seat and asked with a serious expression, the poet gasped and hurriedly brought up the story she had heard.Four days ago, two countries were overthrown at the southern tip of the western continent.a gang of black dragon-dominated monsters A full-time meeting of the Continental Union was held to solve the problem with the corps.He said he realized that his enemies were vampires and maids there.Later, they declared war on the entire continent to achieve their goals.In the lead, Reina, a beautiful woman with sky-blue hair that Davy brought, is a warrior.He said he was in the position of commander.Perhaps the reason she climbed up there with nothing was because of what Davy had done.More important than that was elsewhere.\"Bam... Fire? Vampires came out in the sun?\"The poet nodded as if she was frightened by the eerie question of Illinois.Boom!Illina immediately replaced Caldiras with a brooch and quickly ran out on the product.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But as soon as she opened the door, she could see five or six knights and my brother blocking her.\"Get out of my way, brother.\"\"Iilina, I can't get out.\"\"You've been working so hard to keep the news to the palace late.

We can't make it as big as you, but if he's prepared so hard, he can move accordingly.\"Alisa, speaking calmly, raised her hand to a small group of vampires and bloodmars that moved quickly across the ridge.\"Everyone, please don't let go of your tension. Let's get started.\"Bam!!!Group A of the Alpha Knights of the Reinforce was a regular group of young boys and girls.However, they were children who passed the formal examination and became regular members, and were basically talented men and girls of their own age.In an instant, the spirit technique performed by the twin sisters of the Spirit Temple moves.The pre-soaked liquid medicine spread like a bubble and began to permeate quickly in the wind of Silaim, the intermediate spirit of the wind.Most of the knights have already seen and confirmed the efficacy of the virus created by an unprecedented new member of a monster named Davy.It doesn't work for all living things, but the only virus that can only be found in the blood of vampires and vampires...\"S, it's a raid!\"\"Hold it! The humans!\"As soon as the lower vampires, who were moving quickly and quietly, shouted out loud, the saint Pildir, who was holding a shield in front of him, dug in at a tremendous speed like a dump truck and hit a vampire in front of him.Although the current drivers of Group A are not lacking in skills, strengthened vampires cannot be killed at once.Careful not to say that it is to have killed by a ball all to death are well aware.As such, vampires now had a viability that exceeded their knowledge of the existence of vampires.But this time, the purpose was not to kill them.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"When a sharp sword penetrated and cut off a vampire, he frowned and pulled his arm back.At the same time, dozens of blood horses penetrated the knights, but the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha worked together as if they had been waiting and prevented their offensive.In the meantime, the wind of the water droplets of twin sisters still swept the whole country.\"You rat bastards!!!\"Vampires, who had a fever over the behavior of tying their feet without attacking due to absolute schedule, began to grind their teeth and exude blood.\"Up to here! We're in danger. We'll retreat!\"Soon after, when the horn was heard with a loud cry, the knights nodded quickly and began to retreat from them, covering each other, leaving behind what they were fighting.\"Humans! You think you can survive this!\"At the cry, the boy with a leech who was running away from the back row giggled.\"I learned something from my classmates, you bastards! Get hit by the eyeballs of Hegg!\"Whoooooo!With the words, he took a small scroll out of his arms, held it in his mouth without hesitation, tore it with one hand and threw it into the air.\"I was told to say that when you use it!\"Confucius says there is a light.I don't know what Confucius says.[Magic to modify light properties][4 Circle][Stern Grenade]At the same time, all the boys and girls in Group A closed their eyes and blocked their vision with one hand as if they had been waiting.Poof!!With the sound of deafening, a huge light that seems to poke the eyes explodes.It's actually a strong light.Besides, what would a vampire who is weak in the nature of light say more?\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\"Oh, my God, my eyes!\"The vampires, who shrieked and faltered, rolled on the floor holding on to their eyes as they were burning.The fact was no different because it was a blood horse with vision.Has it been a long time since everyone closed their eyes and woke up?A vampire slowly opened his eyes and looked around with a frown.\"Oh, my God! You ran away!\"Starting with him, who seemed angry, those who regained their sight looked around, but none of the young humans who had taken them by surprise were seen.An infuriated by the fact that he was completely misled by the guerrilla war, a vampire began to vent his blood all over his body.\"Okay! Damn you guys! Find him and kill him! Tear it to death and bleed it until it's twisted!\"On the contrary, some looked relieved.\"Whew... how did you get your life fixed?\"\"If you take the power of immortality because of that damn human being, you never know when you'll die.\"It is certainly not normal for a single human being to keep all vampires on edge.\"I hope this war ends soon. The blood horse I was assigned to this time is finally starting to listen to me. He's still weak, so I kept him in hiding until he grew up. We can go back after this mission.\"\"Oh. That's good news. I pray for you to grow more and make it a dashing blood horse.\"\"Thank you for your kind words...\"A vampire, who was speaking quietly, frowned slightly.\"Why, but you.\"\"......it's not a big deal. It's a little... weird.\"\"Didn't you forget to eat?\"He shook his head at the question of his fellow lower vampire.\"That's not true. Is this mission actually a little risky? So I caught some mountain animals and washed the blood in advance in case they were hungry.\"\"Then you drank too much. That's a stupid greeting.\"\"Even if you do...\"While talking, he grabbed his stomach and bowed down.\"Luck...\"\"Huh? Hey! What's wrong with you?\"A bewildered fellow sub-vampire shouted, patting him on the back.However, he couldn't move easily and breathed out roughly.\"You... you'really.He seemed to have felt something was wrong with his body, but he hardened his words.A fellow vampire, curious about the sudden silence, was about to help him.Yaaaah!!Suddenly, the vampire, who was bending his back, jumped up and bit off his fellow vampire's arm.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhh! He's crazy! What's wrong with you!\"Surprised, he hurriedly pulled out his arm, but his arm was dripping with vampire-like blood, as if he had been stabbed properly.\"Uh, uh, what did I... ...\"\"Hey. Are you crazy?!\"\"Oh, no! I didn't do it on purpose!\"\"Ehhhuh...\"\"Mi, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to put you through a lot!\"\"Look, you don't fit well with the battle. Apparently, you're upset because of stress, so let's go home. If you get back to work, the mahjong will heal you.\"\"Oh, you're talking about that mysterious circus woman.\"\"Yeah, yeah. Let's go. A-ing...\"The grumbling vampires did not know.Not only that, but most vampires are in the same situation.Reports from the Reinforce Alpha Knights began to come up.Aside from vampires who have continued to advance like rocks with eggs to keep me tied to the main stage, the fact that the Byeoldongdae is moving to all parts of the continent.Since we already knew where they were coming from, it was obvious that they would be on the road.I took control of the wind in the sky through the Qurungi and told the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha to raid them.In the meantime, they let go of the additional offerings.All they want is a hateful sacrifice.It's selfish to think that most of them are criminals or people who cause big problems, but I was going to use them as they are.The first sacrifices were immediately used to destroy them, but doing more than that would only hamper the plan.I flicked my finger as I watched Reina move the troops to the main.It's almost time for the news to come.Vampire Star Dongdae was planted with viruses.And the virus that would trigger it also seeped through the blood horse water that I revived with a rebib.NowThe result will come out.\"Oh, my God! Commander!She looked at me as if she had predicted the situation roughly at the sight of a messenger running toward Reina from afar.\"Weird movements were observed in the\" ship, vampire form! It's like a civil war broke out...!\"When she nodded, she quietly spoke to a general who was beside her without further consideration.\"Ready to attack. I'll push it in at once.\"At the same time, I nodded to her and turned around.\"Where are you going?\"\"I'm leaving the army.\"\"Ta, desertion?\"\"Do you think you can catch it?\"She shook her head at my question.\"I have no idea what you're thinking. You're the one.\"Then, when I moved to leave the unit, I declared my desertion to Alice, who came to see me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soldiers who once clashed with the huge, sacred firebirds that appeared to help themselves.I no longer fear the space where white feathers fly as if I were seeing a miracle of God.The old man, who used to be sarcastic, showed such great power that he has been working out for a long time.\"Oh, you bastards! Even if I die, I'm coming with you guys!\"The old man, who shouted and threw a helicopter at him, snatched the jaw of a huge dark wolf with his bare hands, twisted it to death, and swung the body of a huge dark wolf like a blunt instrument.It was too overwhelming to be seen as coming from the old man's body.But hundreds of white magicians activated in the sky made it possible.\"Ahem! Ahem! Ahem!The boy, who became a mercenary at a young age and participated in the battlefield, roamed around as if he were cutting everything when he was caught in an overwhelming body-enhancing buff after his skillful swordsmanship, which he had been training to fill his deficiency.The first wedge formation had long since disappeared.However, the battlefield was already so chaotic that it was meaningless.It was a disaster itself that many people fought with huge buffs on their backs.Boohoohoohoohooh!!The black minotaurs, who swept the human race with their hand-held blunt instruments with a huge cry, soon jumped up as if they had been fatally wounded and stepped back as if they were tired of the zombies.Just a swarm of ants!The result was obvious as long as there were far fewer numbers and each one was suspiciously human.\"Hey, this is... this is ridiculous...\"Moreover, the biggest problem was none other than the two....quadding!!!Dozens of people are swept away in half if they lose in a single batch.Reina, the hero at the forefront of the battlefield, was simply a terrible monster.Her presence of covering up the golden-white oracle-blade on Unwoldo Island ended at once those who questioned whether she was so strong.Yikes!!!And so did the giant firebird, like her, who roamed the entire battlefield and shook off its great grandeur.\"Hey, this is ridiculous...\"Gorgon stared blankly at the bird of flame, flying in the sky and turning the eroded Wyverns into ashes in an instant.It is not easy to kill each soldier. Their commander, the human woman, was a frightening strongman far beyond Gorgon's expectations, and the bird of fire, presumed to be an unidentified Phoenix, unilaterally burned Gorgon's army without harming humans at all.No matter how weak it is as an advance team, it was still not this one.Considering the level and number of powerful blood horse-riding and horse-riding monsters, it should never have happened.However, humans created this situation as if they had been waiting.\"Hey, you guys!!!\"Outraged, he threw a nearby man's neck away.I am getting goose bumps at the power of the damn recovery, but if I die immediately, there is no way to save the recovery magic.\"Dead! You punk!\"\"You're dead!Which means,It was like saying that if you don't die, you'll surely survive.Therefore, it was a natural result that soldiers' fighting spirit went up in real time.Gorgon, who had been cutting to death at random, soon swept away the crowds of vampires and took a step back when he saw Reina approaching.It's not a fight with that crazy-powerful human woman.You have to run.Instinct calls for retreat immediately, but reason held it.He was the one who violated the order of the main force and made a first attack.And not only were they defeated, but they also led to a significant increase in their morale.Even if you live, the result of your return will be nothing but miserable disgrace and death.Reina, who came slowly toward Gorgon, who had been hardened, pointed at the end of Longinus' spear at him.Then he spoke quietly.\"That's what my silversmith said.\"\"......\"\"The empty cart is noisy. You're pretty weak-kneed for a jaw drop.\"\"Hey, you damn X!\"Furious at Reina's provocation, Gorgon left both reason and instinct to anger and quickly penetrated into her.Whaaaaah!Then he pulled out a huge sword and struck her and screamed like crazy.\"Four years! I will tear you to death with this hand! I will tear him to death and drink blood!\"Reina, who had taken his sword without saying a word at his onslaught, saw madness and pushed in, soon took a familiar step.Then he quietly blew up Manna and pulled her up.[Serious Prosecutor][Breaking mountains]Boom!!!a sword of overwhelming weightAlthough it was made of spears, not of a sword, the weight of Longinus' spear was overwhelmingly heavy, instantly cutting off Gorgon's sword and splitting his body in half.It was so strong that there was a huge hole of several meters from where he was standing.After the death of a man who led a large army of 150,000 people, it was in vain.Of course, vampires who lost their heads had no choice but to be confused.Even the lowest-ranked vampires are more powerful than humans.But all of them could not withstand the power of the lunatic humans, who were engulfed in buff magic, and were swept away at random.In the meantime, their conductor died. I couldn't help but feel hopeless.Even so, there could not have been surrender or retreat for vampires who had the pride of the nobility.Unlike the number of deaths and bloodshed, vampires eventually held out until the last one collapsed.Sue was nearly three times the battle, but as a result of hitting each other without retreat, one side was completely destroyed.Reina shook her head as she watched Longinus, who had been so ignorant and frightened that she couldn't breathe and shake her head.It's really incredible durability.\"Speaking calmly, she soon stood absentmindedly and slowly lifted the spearhead toward the soldiers looking at her.a declaration of victoryAt the same time, tremendous cheers began to burst from all sides.\"Wow!!!\"The soldiers' morale soared as if they had been literally hit by drugs when the fight, which they thought would be absolutely defeated, became such an absurd victory.It wasn't just a win, it was a plus for winning in an amazing way.\"Long live the warrior Reina!!!\"It was not long before there were some cries of praise from the soldiers.\"Hurrah!\"Originally, the person who provided the buff should be praised the most.As if to induce this situation on purpose, he only watched the situation as slowly as he could from the eyes of the soldiers.* * *Lady candidate Alice could soon feel how much he had done.The divine magic he used was the divine magic of a line she had never seen before.No, to be exact, I've seen the traces.When the events of the Duchy of Felesti broke out in the past.At that time, it was rumored to be a divine magic that broke out when the Iliana Empress Caldiras awakened.Alice had a good feeling of how rubbish it was.It was widely believed that the saint in front of him was a real exhaust monster.\"Oh, my God... what did I see in that short time?\"\"Oh, God.\"An intermediate priest of the Priya Church, who had participated in the war to treat the wounded, spoke to Alice with an incredible face.\"Oh, my God... ...is I seeing a miracle from God?\"\"What the hell is he...\"\"No matter how much you're a saint, it's really shocking.\"\"I've been reluctant to follow Alice because she believes in her, but I'm really... ashamed of myself.\"He did not participate in the war games himself, but he turned the tables of the war by himself.The soldiers see it all as a miracle created by Raina, but the priests who were looking from the outside could tell.The man who really ended this war.It's not the warrior Reina, but the saint David who was watching the situation from afar.How can he perform miracles that even the Pope of the Holy Land can't do at such a young age?\"Kuluck...\"At that time, when Prince Davy slightly twisted his body, respect began to grow in the eyes of the priests.\"Oh, my God... he doesn't even take care of himself...\"\"Ah... God's grace.\"In fact, I sneezed because of the dust, but it didn't matter to the priests who were already wet.Is this really the true face of the saint who was rumored to be on the continent?I thought so, but there were also things I couldn't understand.Leaving him alone looking at the war situation, the priests waited for Alice to lead them.And Alice, the sex candidate who was watching the situation without a word, slowly opened her mouth.\"A saint is the recipient of God's man.\"\"But...\"\"And the more you love life, the stronger you are.\"At the words, the priests dazed and soon opened their eyes wide.Then he made a face that he was touched.\"Oh, my God... then from him...\"\"How much do you love the world?\"Even the Pope of the Holy Land gave up the power he couldn't even imagine.Priests did not understand how absurd the divine magic used by a man named Davy was because they had never used it or actually had never seen it.I just thought it was amazing, amazing.\"But I was really surprised. I can't believe I'm going to reinforce every single one of those soldiers on this street.\"\"That's true. A saint who loves the world!prefer the depth and sophistication of the divine magicFocusing on the hidden mind, the priests began to kneel down and pray as if they had been touched by a god.\"Ah... Goddess Priest. Forgive me for being arrogant...\"\"Thank you forever for your sublime...\"\"God will be with you...\"Believe what you want to believe.Alice thought so.No matter how saint he was, his power was real and I could see how noblely he tried to be.I'm saying this over and over again. The illusion is the freedom of each person.\"Cough, click\"Why do you sneeze like that?\"Someone must be cursing at me.\"It's understandable. I'm sure by now she's been chewing on you.They may be feeling betrayed and shuddering.However, for Illinois, it was better not to participate in the war.Because there's nothing good about revenge?No way.Revenge is sweet, and achieving it neatly and finding the next goal is also life's vitality.What do you call counseling?He meant that such words were not used as old words for nothing.But this kind of ignorant war will be hard to come.I can, but it was true that the more I was stranded here, the more advantageous that side would be.Looking back at the ruined plains with the Allies turning back with the victory news, I reached for numerous vampires, bloodshed, and beasts of the horse world who had fallen dead in the blood.If I had just moved in the name of a saint.It's time to move as a black-and-white colonel.Taking out a small reagent from the subspace, I poked the reagent into the affected parts of several hematopoietic beasts and reached out quietly.[Revive]A magic different from the Spiritual Resurrection Magic that brings the undead back.It is an unfinished magic created before death by a commander who spent his life trying to save his dead wife.After all, he couldn't use this magic to his wife because he had to live up to the expectations of his death.I don't care what they look like to me right now.Boong!!As soon as the black mana penetrated, several blood horsehorses, which had become bodies like electronics with charged batteries, sprang up.Then he moves about with a ferocious air. They gathered quietly when they found me.\"Go back to your homes.\"Go, bite everything and infect them.Don't regard zombie apocalypse as a disaster for humans.I'll assist you with your, your, your, your abyss biological virus.Originally, these viruses cannot exist in common sense.Like a virus that only responds to vampires and related hulmasters.Such a narrow-minded virus is something you can only see in movies, but it is less efficient and less practical.Above all, the truth is that the world's rules can't just leave such unconscious things unattended.But the life of the abyss I have is the life of the world behind the dog's disregard for such rules.It was originally a method that I discovered while doing an experiment that I wanted to control at my own discretion by undetecting some of his flesh.The problem was that the undetected virus turned into a zombie virus.After collecting viral eggs in a reversed virus in the wake of extraterritorial forces, not the rules of the world, I transformed it into a surprise gift for vampires.There are still a lot of side effects and a lot of risks.It's none of my business.With the rapidly disappearing hematoma behind me, I took out the crystal ball and tried to connect it.Davey, that black dragon. Reina, can he handle this?\"......I don't know because I haven't seen it in person, but if he has real dragon-like power, it's not possible.\"Like it or not, you're gonna bump into it.\"That's why the world's eggs are moving.\"It's going to be a huge burden for Al, but it doesn't matter if she's there's a dragon doesn't matter.Ignacil, who was extinguished by me, was also the only thing that eventually penetrated and attacked the only weakness of being young.In this war, Reina should be praised as a leading figure throughout the continent. Her presence will receive the attention of all countries and every single one of her actions will have a great impact.That way, you can often use her methods on this side by side.Can't you lower yourself?Monopoly of interest is an unexpectedly troublesome task.It's a vicious and vicious way, but Reina has made every effort to be praised as a warrior.They will only be rewarded accordingly.\"It's me, Davey.\"[David] I've been waiting for your call.]\"We're all set up here.\"[They're starting to move] We've put the virus in a surprise guerrilla operation in their path.

Then, please.\"[Okay]People on the continent don't know the name of the Rhinforce Alpha Knights. Therefore, the Knights decided not to reveal themselves to the world, but to prevent them from being hidden.Moving in secret, interfering with their behavior. The virus is being introduced periodically by surprise.As a result, none of them appreciate their services.In the first place, it was their choice as a secret organization of the birth group.Originally, in my case, I was thinking of revealing the existence of last whiskey to the world.But I didn't.It would be a moment for the noble Knights to be corrupted if material and political power began to intervene.\"Davie, you bastard!! How could she do this to me?!\"Illina, who was gazing at the empty cabin, nervously tried to swing a giant sword, not Caldiras, but stopped.Oh, my God!But her sword did not stop completely, so the tip of the luxury wooden table in her room was cut sharply.Nevertheless, she was bragging about her anger.Disposal of absenteeism and tardiness dispositionIt was like a bolt out of the blue for Illina.Suddenly, my brother released the prince from the palace and attacked the quiet cabin where Belial was.Illina, who regularly dropped by the cabin to get Belial some medicine, heard the news late.By the time she arrived, Belial had already fled.There was no reason to keep him around in the first place.When she first found him, she was in danger of dying right away, so she brought him in.Even if the injury was not completely cured, she judged that she would not die anywhere herself as long as she had more than Sodmaster-class power.However, he was a good friend of the story who listened to the story silently.He was a man who could be a good friend in a different sense from Davy.I didn't mean to kick him out like this. The furious Illinois went to my brother's to pick a quarrel with him about everything.And I could hear it.He visited Illinois after hearing that there was something disturbing enough to violate the imperial spirit.And there he said he actually found Belial.Illina rebuked the imperial dignity, and eventually she was imprisoned by the royal court.Of course, even though she escaped, Illina's long experience with a psycho child allowed her to infer the true culprit of the incident.Davy O'Loon.This bad boy went to Saliban and told him everything about Belial.It made her unable to get away from the palace.Why did he do this?I couldn't understand it even in retrospect.No, I couldn't have known.It's a device to get Belial to leave Illinois after the deal with Belial is made.In additionWhen I heard that the enemy was a vampire, I knew how she would turn out, so I tied her to the palace.Illina was just a girl who thought in the normal human category to infer such facts without a clue.Calm down, Illina. He was meant to leave anyway, wasn't he?]\"It's not Belial that I'm angry! Davy's son beat me in the back of the head. Why is he always so impatient with me?\"Caldiras answered the cry with a clear air.I've heard it from Harres before. I have a preference like a child who likes to bully me.\"......\"The words hardened Illinois' body.[Maybe that's what Davey is like?]Illina blushed at the question.Then he shook his head.\"Who, who accepted that you were interested in? I don't care about him anymore.\"[Hmm......really?]\"Yes\"[I've told you lie is bad...]At the words of Caldiras, who breathed a sigh, Illina blushed her face as if she were a child who had been caught.She came carelessly, looked after her condition, and trained her lungs too hard, so in fact, there were some unpleasant things left in her body.Davy is.I noticed that right away.I made an excuse to say, \"I don't know what to do with my hands,\" and I solved it on the spot.Honestly, how much help did you get from him?He said no. She also shook her head when she tried to propose to him on the spur of the moment.As time went by, I thought it was okay, but every time I met him, I felt different and different, so I couldn't shake off my complicated feelings.\"Down! Down!\"Illina, who was sitting annoyingly in a chair and savoring her car combatively, tilted her head at the sight of her exclusive girl rushing in.\"What's going on?\"\"So, did you hear that?\" Snake, vampire! A monster named Vampire appeared...\"The royal palace is rather quick to hear from.However, Illinois belatedly learned the news.\"What... what do you mean?\"When she jumped out of her seat and asked with a serious expression, the poet gasped and hurriedly brought up the story she had heard.Four days ago, two countries were overthrown at the southern tip of the western continent.a gang of black dragon-dominated monsters A full-time meeting of the Continental Union was held to solve the problem with the corps.He said he realized that his enemies were vampires and maids there.Later, they declared war on the entire continent to achieve their goals.In the lead, Reina, a beautiful woman with sky-blue hair that Davy brought, is a warrior.He said he was in the position of commander.Perhaps the reason she climbed up there with nothing was because of what Davy had done.More important than that was elsewhere.\"Bam... Fire? Vampires came out in the sun?\"The poet nodded as if she was frightened by the eerie question of Illinois.Boom!Illina immediately replaced Caldiras with a brooch and quickly ran out on the product.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But as soon as she opened the door, she could see five or six knights and my brother blocking her.\"Get out of my way, brother.\"\"Iilina, I can't get out.\"\"You've been working so hard to keep the news to the palace late. Are you out of your mind to use state funds and talent for such a place?\"\"Don't worry, I'm just playing my own money.\"\"Let me go. I'll join you right now.\"\"White Bird was briefly transferred from my authority and sent to court. You wait here.\"\"I'm going to fight too!!\"Illina cried out.\"Orabani... ..you know how my mother died...\"Salivan sighed briefly at the words and approached her.Then he spoke quietly.\"Are you going to waste Prince Davy's efforts worrying that you might get hurt?\"Illina's body flinched at the words.\"He seems cold-hearted, but he is a good man who always protects his own people. I'm going to ask you, Illina. Do you think it's for a simple reason that Prince Davy, such a thoughtful and strong man, tied you up here?\"\"I'll take care of my life.\"It was around the time when the cold-throwing Illinois tried to pass him.He also lost his mother. Think about why he stopped your revenge like that revenge.\"In short, when he passed her again, Illina stood there shivering for a long time before collapsing.Then he buried his head and started sobbing.How much have you trained swordsmanship to kill vampires?He even joined the Rhinforce Alpha Knights to find information about vampires.You want me to watch from afar without holding a sword when the vampire is out?\"Davie... ...you've got the wrong. Caldiras, you said you could find out where he is if you wanted to.\"First of all, Per is sealed in his castle.]\"Guide me.\"The destruction of the vampire was one of Illinois' life's goals in the first place.news of a landslide victory in the battle against the enemy advance teamIt would be great news for those who were anxiously waiting for the victory or defeat of the war.There were too many remaining enemies and too many unexposed ones to be considered to have actually taken a heavy toll on the enemy's power.It was because of the existence of a black dragon that burned the top vampires, the Ma tribe, or the two countries at once, which were judged to be the greatest risk factors.Of course, the combined forces were not everything here now.At a time when large-scale forces are moving neatly under the agreement throughout the continent, the fact that it is a full-scale war of large-scale forces does not change.\"That's... that's great. With Prince Davy here, this war... ...can't possibly end in a landslide.\"\"That's right! God's mercy on those special forces under God's name...\"\"I am not the commander of this war. \"Alice, the Holy Woman Candidate.\"\"I don't know that he's not bound to such a trivial place.\"Her rebuttal shook my head.\"You'll see if you watch.\"She said nothing more about what I said.an undisclosed order of knightsThe Knights of the Reinforce Alpha, the last group of Whispe Knights, was moving with the determination of unprecedented continental intervention.They never go beyond their boundaries unless they are basically a crisis over the annihilation of the entire continent.In fact, they have long prevented the polar beasts, which are in danger of the survival of the continent in silence, from spreading.\"Whoa...

That's right.\"Damour frowned at Alisa's calm rebuttal.But in the end, I couldn't say anything.You don't know that it's actually karma you've built up by yourself.He's rather timid.[Chuck! Group A.

We can't make it as big as you, but if he's prepared so hard, he can move accordingly.\"Alisa, speaking calmly, raised her hand to a small group of vampires and bloodmars that moved quickly across the ridge.\"Everyone, please don't let go of your tension. Let's get started.\"Bam!!!Group A of the Alpha Knights of the Reinforce was a regular group of young boys and girls.However, they were children who passed the formal examination and became regular members, and were basically talented men and girls of their own age.In an instant, the spirit technique performed by the twin sisters of the Spirit Temple moves.The pre-soaked liquid medicine spread like a bubble and began to permeate quickly in the wind of Silaim, the intermediate spirit of the wind.Most of the knights have already seen and confirmed the efficacy of the virus created by an unprecedented new member of a monster named Davy.It doesn't work for all living things, but the only virus that can only be found in the blood of vampires and vampires...\"S, it's a raid!\"\"Hold it! The humans!\"As soon as the lower vampires, who were moving quickly and quietly, shouted out loud, the saint Pildir, who was holding a shield in front of him, dug in at a tremendous speed like a dump truck and hit a vampire in front of him.Although the current drivers of Group A are not lacking in skills, strengthened vampires cannot be killed at once.Careful not to say that it is to have killed by a ball all to death are well aware.As such, vampires now had a viability that exceeded their knowledge of the existence of vampires.But this time, the purpose was not to kill them.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"When a sharp sword penetrated and cut off a vampire, he frowned and pulled his arm back.At the same time, dozens of blood horses penetrated the knights, but the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha worked together as if they had been waiting and prevented their offensive.In the meantime, the wind of the water droplets of twin sisters still swept the whole country.\"You rat bastards!!!\"Vampires, who had a fever over the behavior of tying their feet without attacking due to absolute schedule, began to grind their teeth and exude blood.\"Up to here! We're in danger. We'll retreat!\"Soon after, when the horn was heard with a loud cry, the knights nodded quickly and began to retreat from them, covering each other, leaving behind what they were fighting.\"Humans! You think you can survive this!\"At the cry, the boy with a leech who was running away from the back row giggled.\"I learned something from my classmates, you bastards! Get hit by the eyeballs of Hegg!\"Whoooooo!With the words, he took a small scroll out of his arms, held it in his mouth without hesitation, tore it with one hand and threw it into the air.\"I was told to say that when you use it!\"Confucius says there is a light.I don't know what Confucius says.[Magic to modify light properties][4 Circle][Stern Grenade]At the same time, all the boys and girls in Group A closed their eyes and blocked their vision with one hand as if they had been waiting.Poof!!With the sound of deafening, a huge light that seems to poke the eyes explodes.It's actually a strong light.Besides, what would a vampire who is weak in the nature of light say more?\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\"Oh, my God, my eyes!\"The vampires, who shrieked and faltered, rolled on the floor holding on to their eyes as they were burning.The fact was no different because it was a blood horse with vision.Has it been a long time since everyone closed their eyes and woke up?A vampire slowly opened his eyes and looked around with a frown.\"Oh, my God! You ran away!\"Starting with him, who seemed angry, those who regained their sight looked around, but none of the young humans who had taken them by surprise were seen.An infuriated by the fact that he was completely misled by the guerrilla war, a vampire began to vent his blood all over his body.\"Okay!

Tear it to death and bleed it until it's twisted!\"On the contrary, some looked relieved.\"Whew... how did you get your life fixed?\"\"If you take the power of immortality because of that damn human being, you never know when you'll die.\"It is certainly not normal for a single human being to keep all vampires on edge.\"I hope this war ends soon.

It's a little... weird.\"\"Didn't you forget to eat?\"He shook his head at the question of his fellow lower vampire.\"That's not true. Is this mission actually a little risky?

That's a stupid greeting.\"\"Even if you do...\"While talking, he grabbed his stomach and bowed down.\"Luck...\"\"Huh? Hey! What's wrong with you?\"A bewildered fellow sub-vampire shouted, patting him on the back.However, he couldn't move easily and breathed out roughly.\"You... you'really.He seemed to have felt something was wrong with his body, but he hardened his words.A fellow vampire, curious about the sudden silence, was about to help him.Yaaaah!!Suddenly, the vampire, who was bending his back, jumped up and bit off his fellow vampire's arm.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhh! He's crazy!

Commander!She looked at me as if she had predicted the situation roughly at the sight of a messenger running toward Reina from afar.\"Weird movements were observed in the\" ship, vampire form! It's like a civil war broke out...!\"When she nodded, she quietly spoke to a general who was beside her without further consideration.\"Ready to attack. I'll push it in at once.\"At the same time, I nodded to her and turned around.\"Where are you going?\"\"I'm leaving the army.\"\"Ta, desertion?\"\"Do you think you can catch it?\"She shook her head at my question.\"I have no idea what you're thinking.

Soldiers who once clashed with the huge, sacred firebirds that appeared to help themselves.I no longer fear the space where white feathers fly as if I were seeing a miracle of God.The old man, who used to be sarcastic, showed such great power that he has been working out for a long time.\"Oh, you bastards! Even if I die, I'm coming with you guys!\"The old man, who shouted and threw a helicopter at him, snatched the jaw of a huge dark wolf with his bare hands, twisted it to death, and swung the body of a huge dark wolf like a blunt instrument.It was too overwhelming to be seen as coming from the old man's body.But hundreds of white magicians activated in the sky made it possible.\"Ahem!

You punk!\"\"You're dead!Which means,It was like saying that if you don't die, you'll surely survive.Therefore, it was a natural result that soldiers' fighting spirit went up in real time.Gorgon, who had been cutting to death at random, soon swept away the crowds of vampires and took a step back when he saw Reina approaching.It's not a fight with that crazy-powerful human woman.You have to run.Instinct calls for retreat immediately, but reason held it.He was the one who violated the order of the main force and made a first attack.And not only were they defeated, but they also led to a significant increase in their morale.Even if you live, the result of your return will be nothing but miserable disgrace and death.Reina, who came slowly toward Gorgon, who had been hardened, pointed at the end of Longinus' spear at him.Then he spoke quietly.\"That's what my silversmith said.\"\"......\"\"The empty cart is noisy. You're pretty weak-kneed for a jaw drop.\"\"Hey, you damn X!\"Furious at Reina's provocation, Gorgon left both reason and instinct to anger and quickly penetrated into her.Whaaaaah!Then he pulled out a huge sword and struck her and screamed like crazy.\"Four years! I will tear you to death with this hand! I will tear him to death and drink blood!\"Reina, who had taken his sword without saying a word at his onslaught, saw madness and pushed in, soon took a familiar step.Then he quietly blew up Manna and pulled her up.[Serious Prosecutor][Breaking mountains]Boom!!!a sword of overwhelming weightAlthough it was made of spears, not of a sword, the weight of Longinus' spear was overwhelmingly heavy, instantly cutting off Gorgon's sword and splitting his body in half.It was so strong that there was a huge hole of several meters from where he was standing.After the death of a man who led a large army of 150,000 people, it was in vain.Of course, vampires who lost their heads had no choice but to be confused.Even the lowest-ranked vampires are more powerful than humans.But all of them could not withstand the power of the lunatic humans, who were engulfed in buff magic, and were swept away at random.In the meantime, their conductor died. I couldn't help but feel hopeless.Even so, there could not have been surrender or retreat for vampires who had the pride of the nobility.Unlike the number of deaths and bloodshed, vampires eventually held out until the last one collapsed.Sue was nearly three times the battle, but as a result of hitting each other without retreat, one side was completely destroyed.Reina shook her head as she watched Longinus, who had been so ignorant and frightened that she couldn't breathe and shake her head.It's really incredible durability.\"Speaking calmly, she soon stood absentmindedly and slowly lifted the spearhead toward the soldiers looking at her.a declaration of victoryAt the same time, tremendous cheers began to burst from all sides.\"Wow!!!\"The soldiers' morale soared as if they had been literally hit by drugs when the fight, which they thought would be absolutely defeated, became such an absurd victory.It wasn't just a win, it was a plus for winning in an amazing way.\"Long live the warrior Reina!!!\"It was not long before there were some cries of praise from the soldiers.\"Hurrah!\"Originally, the person who provided the buff should be praised the most.As if to induce this situation on purpose, he only watched the situation as slowly as he could from the eyes of the soldiers.* * *Lady candidate Alice could soon feel how much he had done.The divine magic he used was the divine magic of a line she had never seen before.No, to be exact, I've seen the traces.When the events of the Duchy of Felesti broke out in the past.At that time, it was rumored to be a divine magic that broke out when the Iliana Empress Caldiras awakened.Alice had a good feeling of how rubbish it was.It was widely believed that the saint in front of him was a real exhaust monster.\"Oh, my God... what did I see in that short time?\"\"Oh, God.\"An intermediate priest of the Priya Church, who had participated in the war to treat the wounded, spoke to Alice with an incredible face.\"Oh, my God... ...is I seeing a miracle from God?\"\"What the hell is he...\"\"No matter how much you're a saint, it's really shocking.\"\"I've been reluctant to follow Alice because she believes in her, but I'm really... ashamed of myself.\"He did not participate in the war games himself, but he turned the tables of the war by himself.The soldiers see it all as a miracle created by Raina, but the priests who were looking from the outside could tell.The man who really ended this war.It's not the warrior Reina, but the saint David who was watching the situation from afar.How can he perform miracles that even the Pope of the Holy Land can't do at such a young age?\"Kuluck...\"At that time, when Prince Davy slightly twisted his body, respect began to grow in the eyes of the priests.\"Oh, my God... he doesn't even take care of himself...\"\"Ah... God's grace.\"In fact, I sneezed because of the dust, but it didn't matter to the priests who were already wet.Is this really the true face of the saint who was rumored to be on the continent?I thought so, but there were also things I couldn't understand.Leaving him alone looking at the war situation, the priests waited for Alice to lead them.And Alice, the sex candidate who was watching the situation without a word, slowly opened her mouth.\"A saint is the recipient of God's man.\"\"But...\"\"And the more you love life, the stronger you are.\"At the words, the priests dazed and soon opened their eyes wide.Then he made a face that he was touched.\"Oh, my God... then from him...\"\"How much do you love the world?\"Even the Pope of the Holy Land gave up the power he couldn't even imagine.Priests did not understand how absurd the divine magic used by a man named Davy was because they had never used it or actually had never seen it.I just thought it was amazing, amazing.\"But I was really surprised. I can't believe I'm going to reinforce every single one of those soldiers on this street.\"\"That's true. A saint who loves the world!prefer the depth and sophistication of the divine magicFocusing on the hidden mind, the priests began to kneel down and pray as if they had been touched by a god.\"Ah... Goddess Priest. Forgive me for being arrogant...\"\"Thank you forever for your sublime...\"\"God will be with you...\"Believe what you want to believe.Alice thought so.No matter how saint he was, his power was real and I could see how noblely he tried to be.I'm saying this over and over again. The illusion is the freedom of each person.\"Cough, click\"Why do you sneeze like that?\"Someone must be cursing at me.\"It's understandable. I'm sure by now she's been chewing on you.They may be feeling betrayed and shuddering.However, for Illinois, it was better not to participate in the war.Because there's nothing good about revenge?No way.Revenge is sweet, and achieving it neatly and finding the next goal is also life's vitality.What do you call counseling?He meant that such words were not used as old words for nothing.But this kind of ignorant war will be hard to come.I can, but it was true that the more I was stranded here, the more advantageous that side would be.Looking back at the ruined plains with the Allies turning back with the victory news, I reached for numerous vampires, bloodshed, and beasts of the horse world who had fallen dead in the blood.If I had just moved in the name of a saint.It's time to move as a black-and-white colonel.Taking out a small reagent from the subspace, I poked the reagent into the affected parts of several hematopoietic beasts and reached out quietly.[Revive]A magic different from the Spiritual Resurrection Magic that brings the undead back.It is an unfinished magic created before death by a commander who spent his life trying to save his dead wife.After all, he couldn't use this magic to his wife because he had to live up to the expectations of his death.I don't care what they look like to me right now.Boong!!As soon as the black mana penetrated, several blood horsehorses, which had become bodies like electronics with charged batteries, sprang up.Then he moves about with a ferocious air. They gathered quietly when they found me.\"Go back to your homes.\"Go, bite everything and infect them.Don't regard zombie apocalypse as a disaster for humans.I'll assist you with your, your, your, your abyss biological virus.Originally, these viruses cannot exist in common sense.Like a virus that only responds to vampires and related hulmasters.Such a narrow-minded virus is something you can only see in movies, but it is less efficient and less practical.Above all, the truth is that the world's rules can't just leave such unconscious things unattended.But the life of the abyss I have is the life of the world behind the dog's disregard for such rules.It was originally a method that I discovered while doing an experiment that I wanted to control at my own discretion by undetecting some of his flesh.The problem was that the undetected virus turned into a zombie virus.After collecting viral eggs in a reversed virus in the wake of extraterritorial forces, not the rules of the world, I transformed it into a surprise gift for vampires.There are still a lot of side effects and a lot of risks.It's none of my business.With the rapidly disappearing hematoma behind me, I took out the crystal ball and tried to connect it.Davey, that black dragon. Reina, can he handle this?\"......I don't know because I haven't seen it in person, but if he has real dragon-like power, it's not possible.\"Like it or not, you're gonna bump into it.\"That's why the world's eggs are moving.\"It's going to be a huge burden for Al, but it doesn't matter if she's there's a dragon doesn't matter.Ignacil, who was extinguished by me, was also the only thing that eventually penetrated and attacked the only weakness of being young.In this war, Reina should be praised as a leading figure throughout the continent. Her presence will receive the attention of all countries and every single one of her actions will have a great impact.That way, you can often use her methods on this side by side.Can't you lower yourself?Monopoly of interest is an unexpectedly troublesome task.It's a vicious and vicious way, but Reina has made every effort to be praised as a warrior.They will only be rewarded accordingly.\"It's me, Davey.\"[David] I've been waiting for your call.]\"We're all set up here.\"[They're starting to move] We've put the virus in a surprise guerrilla operation in their path. Honestly, it feels a little strange.He seemed skeptical about the somewhat inhumane way of war.\"The more effort you and the knights make, the more human beings on the continent can live. Then, please.\"[Okay]People on the continent don't know the name of the Rhinforce Alpha Knights. Therefore, the Knights decided not to reveal themselves to the world, but to prevent them from being hidden.Moving in secret, interfering with their behavior. The virus is being introduced periodically by surprise.As a result, none of them appreciate their services.In the first place, it was their choice as a secret organization of the birth group.Originally, in my case, I was thinking of revealing the existence of last whiskey to the world.But I didn't.It would be a moment for the noble Knights to be corrupted if material and political power began to intervene.\"Davie, you bastard!! How could she do this to me?!\"Illina, who was gazing at the empty cabin, nervously tried to swing a giant sword, not Caldiras, but stopped.Oh, my God!But her sword did not stop completely, so the tip of the luxury wooden table in her room was cut sharply.Nevertheless, she was bragging about her anger.Disposal of absenteeism and tardiness dispositionIt was like a bolt out of the blue for Illina.Suddenly, my brother released the prince from the palace and attacked the quiet cabin where Belial was.Illina, who regularly dropped by the cabin to get Belial some medicine, heard the news late.By the time she arrived, Belial had already fled.There was no reason to keep him around in the first place.When she first found him, she was in danger of dying right away, so she brought him in.Even if the injury was not completely cured, she judged that she would not die anywhere herself as long as she had more than Sodmaster-class power.However, he was a good friend of the story who listened to the story silently.He was a man who could be a good friend in a different sense from Davy.I didn't mean to kick him out like this. The furious Illinois went to my brother's to pick a quarrel with him about everything.And I could hear it.He visited Illinois after hearing that there was something disturbing enough to violate the imperial spirit.And there he said he actually found Belial.Illina rebuked the imperial dignity, and eventually she was imprisoned by the royal court.Of course, even though she escaped, Illina's long experience with a psycho child allowed her to infer the true culprit of the incident.Davy O'Loon.This bad boy went to Saliban and told him everything about Belial.It made her unable to get away from the palace.Why did he do this?I couldn't understand it even in retrospect.No, I couldn't have known.It's a device to get Belial to leave Illinois after the deal with Belial is made.In additionWhen I heard that the enemy was a vampire, I knew how she would turn out, so I tied her to the palace.Illina was just a girl who thought in the normal human category to infer such facts without a clue.Calm down, Illina. He was meant to leave anyway, wasn't he?]\"It's not Belial that I'm angry! Davy's son beat me in the back of the head. Why is he always so impatient with me?\"Caldiras answered the cry with a clear air.I've heard it from Harres before. I have a preference like a child who likes to bully me.\"......\"The words hardened Illinois' body.[Maybe that's what Davey is like?]Illina blushed at the question.Then he shook his head.\"Who, who accepted that you were interested in? I don't care about him anymore.\"[Hmm......really?]\"Yes\"[I've told you lie is bad...]At the words of Caldiras, who breathed a sigh, Illina blushed her face as if she were a child who had been caught.She came carelessly, looked after her condition, and trained her lungs too hard, so in fact, there were some unpleasant things left in her body.Davy is.I noticed that right away.I made an excuse to say, \"I don't know what to do with my hands,\" and I solved it on the spot.Honestly, how much help did you get from him?He said no. She also shook her head when she tried to propose to him on the spur of the moment.As time went by, I thought it was okay, but every time I met him, I felt different and different, so I couldn't shake off my complicated feelings.\"Down! Down!\"Illina, who was sitting annoyingly in a chair and savoring her car combatively, tilted her head at the sight of her exclusive girl rushing in.\"What's going on?\"\"So, did you hear that?\" Snake, vampire! A monster named Vampire appeared...\"The royal palace is rather quick to hear from.However, Illinois belatedly learned the news.\"What... what do you mean?\"When she jumped out of her seat and asked with a serious expression, the poet gasped and hurriedly brought up the story she had heard.Four days ago, two countries were overthrown at the southern tip of the western continent.a gang of black dragon-dominated monsters A full-time meeting of the Continental Union was held to solve the problem with the corps.He said he realized that his enemies were vampires and maids there.Later, they declared war on the entire continent to achieve their goals.In the lead, Reina, a beautiful woman with sky-blue hair that Davy brought, is a warrior.He said he was in the position of commander.Perhaps the reason she climbed up there with nothing was because of what Davy had done.More important than that was elsewhere.\"Bam... Fire? Vampires came out in the sun?\"The poet nodded as if she was frightened by the eerie question of Illinois.Boom!Illina immediately replaced Caldiras with a brooch and quickly ran out on the product.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.But as soon as she opened the door, she could see five or six knights and my brother blocking her.\"Get out of my way, brother.\"\"Iilina, I can't get out.\"\"You've been working so hard to keep the news to the palace late. Are you out of your mind to use state funds and talent for such a place?\"\"Don't worry, I'm just playing my own money.\"\"Let me go. I'll join you right now.\"\"White Bird was briefly transferred from my authority and sent to court. You wait here.\"\"I'm going to fight too!!\"Illina cried out.\"Orabani... ..you know how my mother died...\"Salivan sighed briefly at the words and approached her.Then he spoke quietly.\"Are you going to waste Prince Davy's efforts worrying that you might get hurt?\"Illina's body flinched at the words.\"He seems cold-hearted, but he is a good man who always protects his own people. I'm going to ask you, Illina. Do you think it's for a simple reason that Prince Davy, such a thoughtful and strong man, tied you up here?\"\"I'll take care of my life.\"It was around the time when the cold-throwing Illinois tried to pass him.He also lost his mother. Think about why he stopped your revenge like that revenge.\"In short, when he passed her again, Illina stood there shivering for a long time before collapsing.Then he buried his head and started sobbing.How much have you trained swordsmanship to kill vampires?He even joined the Rhinforce Alpha Knights to find information about vampires.You want me to watch from afar without holding a sword when the vampire is out?\"Davie... ...you've got the wrong. Caldiras, you said you could find out where he is if you wanted to.\"First of all, Per is sealed in his castle.]\"Guide me.\"The destruction of the vampire was one of Illinois' life's goals in the first place.news of a landslide victory in the battle against the enemy advance teamIt would be great news for those who were anxiously waiting for the victory or defeat of the war.There were too many remaining enemies and too many unexposed ones to be considered to have actually taken a heavy toll on the enemy's power.It was because of the existence of a black dragon that burned the top vampires, the Ma tribe, or the two countries at once, which were judged to be the greatest risk factors.Of course, the combined forces were not everything here now.At a time when large-scale forces are moving neatly under the agreement throughout the continent, the fact that it is a full-scale war of large-scale forces does not change.\"That's... that's great. With Prince Davy here, this war... ...can't possibly end in a landslide.\"\"That's right! God's mercy on those special forces under God's name...\"\"I am not the commander of this war. \"Alice, the Holy Woman Candidate.\"\"I don't know that he's not bound to such a trivial place.\"Her rebuttal shook my head.\"You'll see if you watch.\"She said nothing more about what I said.an undisclosed order of knightsThe Knights of the Reinforce Alpha, the last group of Whispe Knights, was moving with the determination of unprecedented continental intervention.They never go beyond their boundaries unless they are basically a crisis over the annihilation of the entire continent.In fact, they have long prevented the polar beasts, which are in danger of the survival of the continent in silence, from spreading.\"Whoa... I'm nervous.\"Shivering, one of the twin sisters, Shire Lenda, held his spirit's hand tightly.\"Yeah... it's the first time I've been out of the continent since I was a kid.\"\"I heard the world is a really scary place... ...and now that I'm out here, it's not much!\"Alisa Patrick, who was watching the situation quietly at Damour's words, answered quietly.\"Damour, shut your mouth.\"\"Hmm... just me.\"\"Damour, if you say something, it'll happen.\"\"Laughing! That's right.\"Damour frowned at Alisa's calm rebuttal.But in the end, I couldn't say anything.You don't know that it's actually karma you've built up by yourself.He's rather timid.[Chuck! Group A.

We can't make it as big as you, but if he's prepared so hard, he can move accordingly.\"Alisa, speaking calmly, raised her hand to a small group of vampires and bloodmars that moved quickly across the ridge.\"Everyone, please don't let go of your tension. Let's get started.\"Bam!!!Group A of the Alpha Knights of the Reinforce was a regular group of young boys and girls.However, they were children who passed the formal examination and became regular members, and were basically talented men and girls of their own age.In an instant, the spirit technique performed by the twin sisters of the Spirit Temple moves.The pre-soaked liquid medicine spread like a bubble and began to permeate quickly in the wind of Silaim, the intermediate spirit of the wind.Most of the knights have already seen and confirmed the efficacy of the virus created by an unprecedented new member of a monster named Davy.It doesn't work for all living things, but the only virus that can only be found in the blood of vampires and vampires...\"S, it's a raid!\"\"Hold it! The humans!\"As soon as the lower vampires, who were moving quickly and quietly, shouted out loud, the saint Pildir, who was holding a shield in front of him, dug in at a tremendous speed like a dump truck and hit a vampire in front of him.Although the current drivers of Group A are not lacking in skills, strengthened vampires cannot be killed at once.Careful not to say that it is to have killed by a ball all to death are well aware.As such, vampires now had a viability that exceeded their knowledge of the existence of vampires.But this time, the purpose was not to kill them.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"When a sharp sword penetrated and cut off a vampire, he frowned and pulled his arm back.At the same time, dozens of blood horses penetrated the knights, but the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha worked together as if they had been waiting and prevented their offensive.In the meantime, the wind of the water droplets of twin sisters still swept the whole country.\"You rat bastards!!!\"Vampires, who had a fever over the behavior of tying their feet without attacking due to absolute schedule, began to grind their teeth and exude blood.\"Up to here! We're in danger. We'll retreat!\"Soon after, when the horn was heard with a loud cry, the knights nodded quickly and began to retreat from them, covering each other, leaving behind what they were fighting.\"Humans! You think you can survive this!\"At the cry, the boy with a leech who was running away from the back row giggled.\"I learned something from my classmates, you bastards! Get hit by the eyeballs of Hegg!\"Whoooooo!With the words, he took a small scroll out of his arms, held it in his mouth without hesitation, tore it with one hand and threw it into the air.\"I was told to say that when you use it!\"Confucius says there is a light.I don't know what Confucius says.[Magic to modify light properties][4 Circle][Stern Grenade]At the same time, all the boys and girls in Group A closed their eyes and blocked their vision with one hand as if they had been waiting.Poof!!With the sound of deafening, a huge light that seems to poke the eyes explodes.It's actually a strong light.Besides, what would a vampire who is weak in the nature of light say more?\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\"Oh, my God, my eyes!\"The vampires, who shrieked and faltered, rolled on the floor holding on to their eyes as they were burning.The fact was no different because it was a blood horse with vision.Has it been a long time since everyone closed their eyes and woke up?A vampire slowly opened his eyes and looked around with a frown.\"Oh, my God! You ran away!\"Starting with him, who seemed angry, those who regained their sight looked around, but none of the young humans who had taken them by surprise were seen.An infuriated by the fact that he was completely misled by the guerrilla war, a vampire began to vent his blood all over his body.\"Okay! Damn you guys! Find him and kill him! Tear it to death and bleed it until it's twisted!\"On the contrary, some looked relieved.\"Whew... how did you get your life fixed?\"\"If you take the power of immortality because of that damn human being, you never know when you'll die.\"It is certainly not normal for a single human being to keep all vampires on edge.\"I hope this war ends soon. The blood horse I was assigned to this time is finally starting to listen to me. He's still weak, so I kept him in hiding until he grew up. We can go back after this mission.\"\"Oh. That's good news. I pray for you to grow more and make it a dashing blood horse.\"\"Thank you for your kind words...\"A vampire, who was speaking quietly, frowned slightly.\"Why, but you.\"\"......it's not a big deal. It's a little... weird.\"\"Didn't you forget to eat?\"He shook his head at the question of his fellow lower vampire.\"That's not true. Is this mission actually a little risky? So I caught some mountain animals and washed the blood in advance in case they were hungry.\"\"Then you drank too much. That's a stupid greeting.\"\"Even if you do...\"While talking, he grabbed his stomach and bowed down.\"Luck...\"\"Huh? Hey! What's wrong with you?\"A bewildered fellow sub-vampire shouted, patting him on the back.However, he couldn't move easily and breathed out roughly.\"You... you'really.He seemed to have felt something was wrong with his body, but he hardened his words.A fellow vampire, curious about the sudden silence, was about to help him.Yaaaah!!Suddenly, the vampire, who was bending his back, jumped up and bit off his fellow vampire's arm.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhh! He's crazy! What's wrong with you!\"Surprised, he hurriedly pulled out his arm, but his arm was dripping with vampire-like blood, as if he had been stabbed properly.\"Uh, uh, what did I... ...\"\"Hey. Are you crazy?!\"\"Oh, no! I didn't do it on purpose!\"\"Ehhhuh...\"\"Mi, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to put you through a lot!\"\"Look, you don't fit well with the battle. Apparently, you're upset because of stress, so let's go home. If you get back to work, the mahjong will heal you.\"\"Oh, you're talking about that mysterious circus woman.\"\"Yeah, yeah. Let's go. A-ing...\"The grumbling vampires did not know.Not only that, but most vampires are in the same situation.Reports from the Reinforce Alpha Knights began to come up.Aside from vampires who have continued to advance like rocks with eggs to keep me tied to the main stage, the fact that the Byeoldongdae is moving to all parts of the continent.Since we already knew where they were coming from, it was obvious that they would be on the road.I took control of the wind in the sky through the Qurungi and told the Knights of the Reinforce Alpha to raid them.In the meantime, they let go of the additional offerings.All they want is a hateful sacrifice.It's selfish to think that most of them are criminals or people who cause big problems, but I was going to use them as they are.The first sacrifices were immediately used to destroy them, but doing more than that would only hamper the plan.I flicked my finger as I watched Reina move the troops to the main.It's almost time for the news to come.Vampire Star Dongdae was planted with viruses.And the virus that would trigger it also seeped through the blood horse water that I revived with a rebib.NowThe result will come out.\"Oh, my God! Commander!She looked at me as if she had predicted the situation roughly at the sight of a messenger running toward Reina from afar.\"Weird movements were observed in the\" ship, vampire form! It's like a civil war broke out...!\"When she nodded, she quietly spoke to a general who was beside her without further consideration.\"Ready to attack. I'll push it in at once.\"At the same time, I nodded to her and turned around.\"Where are you going?\"\"I'm leaving the army.\"\"Ta, desertion?\"\"Do you think you can catch it?\"She shook her head at my question.\"I have no idea what you're thinking.

It is true that the income tax Prince Davey has paid has rescued the Rowane Kingdom out of a financial crisis and brought hope for our recovery. You all seem to be getting ahead of yourselves. Shouldn\u2019t we discuss the root of this matter first?\u201d Duke Bariatta maintained a tone that made it seem like he had no other intentions, and spoke as if he was trying to help Davey.\u201cDiscuss the root of the matter?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. What you are debating about is how to make the moon grass business beneficial to the kingdom, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYes. This is a revolutionary business. If we utilize it well\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, why are you trying to give the business rights to the kingdom and make decisions about it without the opinion of Prince Davey, the biggest contributor?\u201d Everyone went silent as Duke Bariatta spoke, and so he went on. \u201cAre your statuses greater than the royalty of this kingdom?\u201dNo one seemed to be thinking clearly because of the sudden success of this business; in reality, there was really no reason to nationalize the moon grass business.\u201cAlso, isn\u2019t Prince Davey already independent from the palace?\u201d Duke Bariatta pointed out.\u201cB\u2014But\u2026\u201d\u201cMarquis Farondis.\u201d\u201cY\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cIf you were told to give all your wealth to the kingdom for its well being, would you do it?\u201d\u201cTh\u2026 That is\u2026\u201dEveryone remained silent.-Why do you think he is helping you?\u2018Does it look like he\u2019s helping me?

Unfortunately, Davey could already sort of see what Duke Bariatta was trying to do.\u201cAhem!\u201d The conference room was filled with silence and a few awkward coughs. Most of the people were trying to gain some profit from the business by not allowing it to be monopolized. Some were probably trying to find a way to use the money earned by the territory to fill their own pockets.\u201cAs such, everything is up to Prince Davey. This is not something for you people to argue about.\u201d\u201cAhem\u2026 Of\u2026 Of course.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201dThe atmosphere started to settle down, and it seemed like the end of the conversation. However, there was no reason for Duke Bariatta to take Davey\u2019s side without any insidious intentions.\u201cLet the Heins Territory take care of their own business. That\u2019s what is beneficial to the kingdom, is that not right, Your Majesty? If this business were forced to be nationalized, that would be oppression. Then, no one would want to start a business in the future.\u201d Duke Bariatta stared at Davey with indifference.Davey just silently nodded. Then, he commented with such sarcasm, \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: give them an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile.\u201dThe faces of the nobility and royalists turned red with embarrassment.\u201cSo, Duke. That\u2019s not all you had to say, am I wrong?\u201d Davey spoke to Duke Bariatta.\u201cDid it seem that way? But yes, there\u2019s something more important. I just felt that the situation needed some intervention.\u201dIf anyone else saw this, it would seem like Duke Bariatta was looking out for Davey despite being aloof. As Duke Bariatta spoke, he pulled out a small bunch of papers from his chest pocket. It was a properly wrapped parchment, which looked like a command paper from an emperor. \u201cIt is correspondence from the High Priest of the Valchas Empire.\u201d\u201cCorrespondence?\u201d King Krianes asked.\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d Duke Bariatta handed the letter to King Krianes. He continued, \u201cThey are asking to examine the stigmata of Prince Davey, and if it is confirmed, they are proposing that he be moved to the empire so that he could be given the title of a saint.\u201dDuke Bariatta had checked the correspondence from another country\u2019s High Senate, the people right under the Pope, who was the commander of the entire empire, without the king\u2019s permission.-What a selfish man. And this kingdom is a mess.From just this act alone, Davey could tell how unbelievably powerful the duke was, and how weak the authority of royalty had become. Perhaps this was how powerful the Kim family had been near the end of Joseon.[1]\u2018No matter what world I\u2019m in, it\u2019s obvious what would happen when the country\u2019s situation becomes difficult.\u2019\u201cPrince Davey has been given a stigmata at an early age. However, no one is asking for the saint\u2019s title to be given to His Highness. This cannot happen,\u201d Duke Bariatta said.\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense! Prince Davey is the First Prince of this kingdom! We cannot send him to the Holy Empire because of a stigmata!\u201d A young count, who was silently frowning, quickly shouted.\"Haha. Count Rhonda. It is the Valchas Empire. Do you not know of them?\u201d\u201cOf course, I do! I know them too well! The Valchas Empire! Their national power is greater than any kingdom and is clearly that of an empire! The country that serves Freyja, the Goddess of Wine!\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 How can you act like this when you know about them?!\u201d\u201cBut this is unfair treatment! It is not just anyone, but the First Prince! How is this different from paying tribute to the empire?!\u201d\u201cAhem! Watch your words! Someone might hear!\u201d\u201cThis is the Rowane Kingdom, not the Valchas Empire! Since when did the Rowane Kingdom become a vassal state of the empire?!\u201d\u201cHaha! Have you ever seen a man so blind to the vision of the future?!\u201dEven as Count Rhonda shouted, most of the nobility seemed to be hushing one another and staying quiet.\u201cOkay, you are going to send me off after checking the existence of my stigmata?\u201d Davey, who was fed up with the situation, finally asked Duke Bariatta in a slow and calm voice.Duke Bariatta nodded. \u201cThis will be helpful to you as well, Your Highness. And this is something that should be fulfilled as royalty\u2026\u201d\u201cSure, you all know that I was given a stigmata, right?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, look at the entire forest and not the individual trees. The Valchas Empire is the Rowane Kingdom\u2019s brother nation and a friendly ally.\u201d\u201cSo, you think the empire will better protect this kingdom if I go and receive the title of the saint?\u201dDuke Bariatta paused for a second, then said, \u201cRoyalty all bear that much responsibility. Remember, no good comes from ruffling the feathers of the Holy Empire.\u201d Duke Bariatta seemingly spoke of an inevitable outcome.Davey remained silent for a moment. Then, one of the nobles, who couldn\u2019t read the room, shouted with frustration, \u201cThen!! What happens to the territory?! I\u2019m talking about the Heins Territory that Prince Davey is the seigneur of! And what happens to the moon grass business?!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, according to the law, the prince can no longer manage the territory after receiving the saint\u2019s title and becoming part of the empire.\u201dAs if the nobles realized what Duke Bariatta was getting at, their eyes shone with greed. Before, the Heins Territory was a cursed land that no one had paid any attention to, but now, they could be swimming in a pool of gold upon possessing it.-They\u2019re trying to play a dirty trick.\u2018Wow, this is getting interesting.\u2019Davey chuckled, feeling intrigued by how the situation was progressing. He stared at the nobles as they began to debate once again, like it had already been decided that he was going to go.\u201cThen we must quickly appoint a new seigneur!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If he receives the title of the saint, we have no choice but to find and appoint a capable person as seigneur.\u201d\u201cAhem! My son happens to have reached adulthood recently\u2026\u201dIt seemed that everyone was trying to involve themselves, their family, or their associates. However, Duke Bariatta wasn\u2019t one to just watch from the sidelines since this was why he had been so adamant about the business remaining independent.\u201cAbout that matter, I dare speak a word.\u201d Duke Bariatta spoke directly to King Krianes. \u201cCurrently, the Heins Territory has become the most important territory in the kingdom. The seigneur of that kind of place cannot be filled just by anyone.\u201d\u201cGo on,\u201d King Krianes said.\u201cSince Prince Davey will not be able to manage the territory after he goes to the Valchas Empire and receives the title of the saint, someone else must do it in his place. God knows that the only person capable of that is the Second Prince Carlus.\u201dDuke Bariatta was simply saying that they should make the Second Prince Carlus, Queen Lynesse\u2019s son, the seigneur. His suggestion was to leave the business independent, then hand it over to Carlus so that his family could take all the profit. He had just spun it differently, but he was also getting ahead of himself and bullshitting exactly like the others.As soon as Duke Bariatta stopped speaking, a boy who kept silent until now finally stood up. It was as if he had been waiting for this very moment.It was the Second Prince Carlus; he attracted even more attention because he was wearing a weird hat unlike before. He gave Davey a big smirk, then stood up. He bowed to King Krianes and confidently opened his mouth. As everyone was waiting for his speech\u2026.\u201cRibbit!\u201d\u00a0A strange frog-like croak came out of Carlus\u2019 mouth.-Giggle!At the same time, Davey shook as he held in his laughter and Perserque, who couldn\u2019t hold it in, covered her mouth with her small hands. It was only right for a present to be opened at an important place, right?24. How to Get in Touch with Dwarves.\u201cTh\u2026 This is\u2026\u201d As if even he was bewildered by the sound coming from his mouth, Carlus frowned. However, unlike his intentions, his voice just kept proudly boasting its presence. \u201cCaw! Cock-a-doodle-doo!\u201dWhen the nobles saw Carlus making all kinds of weird bird noises, their jaws dropped. This was even enough for the composed Duke Bariatta to lose his cool. He asked, \u201cCarlus. What are you doing?\u201d\u201cTh\u2026 That is\u2026 Squeak!\u201d Carlus stuttered. He looked so confused by how he couldn\u2019t control the sounds from his mouth, even though he was making them. \u201cY\u2014Your Majesty! Growl\u2026 Woof woof!\u201dIt just seemed like Carlus was goofing off.-Y\u2026 You. This is a little\u2026 Hup! Ahahahaha!!!Perserque, the former Demon Lord, couldn\u2019t hold it in and burst out in laughter.\u201cSnicker!\u201d In fact, it wasn\u2019t just Perserque who couldn\u2019t hold in her laughter. Everyone else was in the same situation. Some of the nobles laughed at how ridiculous Carlus looked, then covered their mouths and tried to keep their composure. Among them, Davey was barely holding it in too.\u201cHow dare you try and joke around in the royal court! Get out!\u201dAs King Krianes shouted angrily, Carlus tried to express how this wasn\u2019t his doing. \u201cYour Majesty, please believe me! Quack quack!\u201d\u201cGuard! Lock him up in a room! Leave him there to think about his wrongdoings, and don\u2019t let him out until I say so!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty! Your Majesty! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doo!\u201d\u00a0As the guard pulled him out of the room, Carlus, who was desperately shouting, began to flail so hard that his hat was tipped off of his head.1. The Andong Kim family was a family of nobility that had become extremely powerful near the end of Joseon, the last dynastic kingdom of Korea, and had been the ones who held the power in the country. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Sun is shining! A nasty, patchy baldness!\u2019The size of the\u00a0bald patch was almost the size of Davey\u2019s hand. As if more hair had fallen out while Carlus had kept his hat on, his blond hair floated in the air like electrons flying around.-Ahahahahahaha!!!!Perserque laughed so hard that she shook. Davey ignored her and stared at Carlus with a smirk.Carlus met Davey\u2019s gaze and tried to shout furiously, but only unintelligible animal noises came out of his mouth. Thud!!\u00a0He was rushed out of the conference room and the doors closed.Davey stood up from his seat. The nobles, who were dumbfounded by Carlus\u2019 strange actions, returned to their senses. They didn\u2019t know what to do, and King Krianes coughed in discomfort.\u201cHe is still too immature to manage the Heins Territory,\u201d Davey said calmly, then glanced at Duke Bariatta. As the confused nobles all gathered toward him, he continued, \u201cNow, I will speak. Duke Bariatta.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dDavey smiled at Duke Bariatta\u2019s composed response. \u201cSince when were you above the king?\u201d\u201cYour Highness?\u201dIt was highly disrespectful, but Davey\u2019s question was piercing. Instead of Duke Bariatta answering, it was another noble who yelled, \u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cI will ask again, Duke. Is this kingdom yours?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Duke Bariatta spoke emotionlessly, but Davey could feel his hostility; in the end, he was a human being with emotions and intentions. \u201cYour Highness, my actions were all for the Rowane Kingdom\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why are you reiterating the same bullshit as those people?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cY\u2014Your Highness! How could you?!\u201d\u201cWhat? I just said the same thing that you did, Duke. Also, why wasn\u2019t His Majesty informed about the correspondence regarding a highly important matter of the kingdom? Did you think it wasn\u2019t worth reporting? You really are the king, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYour Highness! That is not true!\u201d Duke Bariatta shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s not? I thought it was since you announced it so confidently.\u201dDuke Bariatta was stunned at Davey\u2019s words. Looking him dead in the eyes, Davey said with a grin, \u201cFrom what I can tell, I don\u2019t think you understand the situation\u2026. You give them an inch, and they want to take a mile.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, this is the royal cou\u2026\u201d Duke Bariatta spoke.\u201cSo, what did you resolve about this matter in this conference? To sell off royalty as per the Holy Empire\u2019s wishes? To take this opportunity and gain sole control over the territory and its business?\u201dFor just a second, Davey saw confusion appear in Duke Bariatta\u2019s eyes. Even if he was royalty, it was extremely dangerous for him to act like this, especially when the Bariatta family had overwhelming power in the kingdom.Davey remained calm, simply grinning before bowing toward King Krianes. \u201cThe main idea is that everything will be solved if we can appease the Holy Empire.\u201d\u201cSo you have a way to settle their request?\u201dAt King Krianes\u2019 mysterious question, Davey chuckled. \u201cThe Holy Empire\u2019s inhabitants are people, too. Perhaps the High Priest might be a problem, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d* * *The meeting of the royal court fizzled out. Well, that was probably how the nobility felt, but it was quite a valuable time for Davey, who had a lot to benefit from it.As soon as he got back to the First Prince\u2019s palace, Davey pulled out a communication crystal that had a mana stone attached to it. Then, he contacted a place by entering a number he had prepared in advance. The crystal emitted a faint light before a young priest showed up.This magic communication device was made by connecting a mana stone to a communication crystal; it wasn\u2019t a difficult system to make, but it was something only the wealthy could enjoy because of how expensive the mana stone was. Appropriate skills were also needed to make things happen. Of course, it wasn\u2019t a problem for Davey, because he was sitting on a big pile of money right now.\u2018This is why you need to choose your business item well.\u2019The territory\u2019s curse, which had been going on for over ten thousand years, had actually become the springboard for success.A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.[Hup! I have received your call, Prince Davey! I am Archdeacon Belliam, the Treasurer of the Valchas Empire.]\u201cI apologize for the sudden call, Archdeacon Belliam.\u201d[Oh, please don\u2019t say that. This was already discussed, right?]\u201cHaha. So, may I ask what the Pope has decided to do?\u201d Davey asked the young priest in the crystal ball, and the priest chattered and chuckled.[Yes, I did get a call from the empire, and the Pope is willing to accept your offer. He also said not to worry; this was High Priest Muless\u2019 independent decision and it will never happen again.]Of course, even if the Valchas Empire was built on sacred land, people still lived there, and they had to run their business as well. Davey had told the Pope one thing: moon grass would not be able to be harvested if anything happened to either the Heins Territory or himself. Someone like the Pope should\u2019ve understood the implications from that comment alone.[Anyway, I didn\u2019t imagine that the Rowane Kingdom would think to send you to the Valchas Empire. Well, it isn\u2019t a bad offer, but we believe that it would be a loss to us in the long run. Haha!]The young priest slurred the end of his words and giggled. As he was still young, he was more friendly than serious.\u201cThen, please keep an eye on it.\u201d[As you wish. Haha! If the product is supplied to us on time, it is definitely not a bad thing for the Valchas Empire as well. However\u2026]\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that part. I will set aside a certain amount for the empire\u2019s purchase in the next quarter.\u201d[Oh! Thank you for going out of your way and doing that! Haha, the Pope said that he would be satisfied if all went well, and he personally asked for you to sell more high-quality leaves in the future.]\u201cI will cultivate some of the remaining land and harvest some additional leaves to sell to the empire.\u201dPerhaps this deal was very worldly and materialistic, but Davey didn\u2019t care about that. The Valchas Empire had basically announced that if one wanted special treatment, they would have to bring them something. Even though he had released a certain amount to the market, it was true that Davey hadn\u2019t been completely satisfied with the amount.\u2018It\u2019s a dirty deal? I didn\u2019t sell only part of the supply for no reason.\u2019In fact, Davey didn\u2019t even have to ask; the Valchas Empire would\u2019ve probably judged that it was more beneficial to maintain a continuous supply of moon grass rather than taking him from the Rowane Kingdom.Of course, they had to know that moon grass could not be harvested without Davey and the Heins Territory. Even if other organizations found out about their deal, they probably could not complain; they would probably try to profit from it by offering something like the Valchas Empire. By then, Davey could slowly expand his business. And if everyone got into deep water all at once, they could not blame each other.\u2018Let everyone fall in deep! It\u2019s a business based on everyone pulling each other down.\u2019\u201cRunning a business is easy.\u201d-Liar.Davey bitterly smiled at Perserque\u2019s criticism.\u201cWell, the matter with the Valchas Empire is taken care of.\u201dThe person who had tried to transfer Davey to the Valchas Empire was High Priest Muless. Since he was at the high ranks of the High Senate, his influence was even greater than some small kingdoms. However, Davey had made a deal with the Pope, the commander of the Valchas Empire.In the end, people lived there as well. And since a political fight was a matter to be dealt with on their own, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem any longer. If the empire were to remain silent because of internal issues, the nobility of the Rowane Kingdom would not be able to touch Davey any longer. It was a pretty good outcome.Davey quickly ended the call with Archdeacon Belliam, pulled out another crystal ball, and tapped on its mana stone. Just like before, it began shining and showed a man\u2014no, it was two people this time.[Sob\u2026 Sir Bernile\u2026 It\u2019s too much\u2026][Ahem! You have received the honor of assisting the First Prince\u2019s work by his side! How could you be so lazy\u2026 Hup! Your Highness.]It was Amy, buried in a pile of papers with tears in her eyes, and Royal Attendant Bernile, who was taking care of the state of affairs at the territory in Davey\u2019s place. One was a royal attendant, and the other was Davey\u2019s personal lady-in-waiting who had looked after him for a long time, but the work they were doing was closer to a personal assistant and a proxy than their actual jobs.\u201cThank you for your hard work, Royal Attendant Bernile.\u201d[I\u2019m just doing what I ought to do.]\u201cAnd Amy?\u201d[Y\u2026 Your Highness? Is it really you?! Your Highness! Please help me!][Hey! I told you: no dinner if you don\u2019t finish the task I assigned to you! Ahem! Your Highness, I apologize for showing this ugly side of me.]\u201cHaha\u2026 Don\u2019t work her too much,\u201d Davey said.Amy was quite bright for a lady-in-waiting, and so, Davey was investing in her future. \u2018This is what a healthy company environment looks like, isn\u2019t it?\u2019Right now, Amy was still young and na\u00efve, but she was going to become exceptionally capable in a few years.\u201cAnyway, how is the restoration work going?\u201dIt had just begun raining in the territory, and the ground was starting to come back to life; however, because it had been abandoned and undeveloped for a long time, there were too many problems to just develop it right away. The biggest concern was the lack of skills and time. The foundation had to be stable and strong for any building; if the territory was built on a weak foundation, there was a high chance that it would cause problems in the blueprint that Davey had designed for his future city.\u2018I have to do something now, when I have the money. It\u2019ll make things much easier in the future.\u2019[Sigh\u2026 I did inspect it as you said, Your Highness, but\u2026]\u201cTime is the problem?\u201d[Yes. To rebuild everything according to the design you left, it is going to take a while.]The estimated timeframe to rebuild the Heins Territory was about ten to twenty years. This was the time needed to build a strong foundation for the Heins Territory, which hadn\u2019t been developed in a long time and was crumbling, and to fix the water system, and cultivate the farmland. Those things wouldn\u2019t be magically fixed, and not everything could be done with money.\u201cWhat about the wizard towers, schools of alchemy, and the merchant companies?\u201d[They are staying at the temporary lodgings for now, because the materials haven\u2019t arrived yet. But they have all received the permit to build on the land as soon as it arrives. Everything is proceeding accordingly.]\u201cOkay. They can do what they want, but they can\u2019t violate the rules I have set.\u201d[Your wish is my command.]Royal Attendant Bernile, the old gentleman, bowed his head with a satisfied expression.\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about the problems regarding the lack of skills; I\u2019ll return with the best-skilled technicians in the continent. We have to start our second business, don\u2019t we?\u201d[The best technicians on the continent?]Royal Attendant Bernile looked puzzled. He was probably wondering what Davey meant.\u201cYeah. They\u2019re really stubborn and not willing to do business a lot of the time, but I know a species that will never turn down my offer.\u201dIt was trading diamonds with corn; there was no better business idea than something that was low-risk and high-returns.Realizing who Davey was referring to when he said, \u2018the best technicians of the continent\u2019, Royal Attendant Bernile widened his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you talking about the dwarves? But it is difficult to get in touch with them without His Majesty\u2019s command\u2026 Also, they are an unfriendly species, and they do not easily cooperate even with high-status people.]After listening to Royal Attendant Bernile\u2019s concerns, Davey replied, \u201cI will take care of that, so just prepare the materials as I said. If possible, from a merchant company with good credit.\u201d[Ah\u2026 Yes, I will make sure to prepare it. The Alioui Merchant Company has already offered to provide all the supplies as quickly as possible.]The Alioui Merchant Company was a large, continent-wide company that had taken over half the supply of moon grass at the auction with their overwhelming amount of funds.\u2018Man, they sniff out money-making opportunities like dogs.\u2019Well, that was probably why they were a major merchant company.[I will say nothing more since it is your plan, Your Highness, but\u2026]As prideful as they were, the dwarves had a strong passion for their crafts and skills. It wasn\u2019t intentional, but Davey had two things that would definitely grab their attention; although, they were two nameless and incomplete works.* * *The dwarves used to be referred to as midgets or subterranean people in the past. They were about 100 to 130 centimeters tall; although they were short, they could grow impossibly long beards and had bulky muscles, and they had an amazing level of heat resistance. Because of their characteristics, they had once been called the \u2018iron race\u2019.Unlike elves, who had become legendary beings due to hiding for over three hundred years, dwarves had some interactions with humans. There weren\u2019t many of them, but they formed tribes with a certain number and lived near mountains or volcanoes.\u2018They were born as talented craftsmen.\u2019The dwarves were quite a bit smaller compared to humans, but their strength was far superior, and their level of precision completely outstripped ordinary craftsmen.-Well, people say that no species is as meticulous as the fairies, but\u2026\u2018The fairies have already gone extinct.\u2019-That\u2019s right. However, you never know; they might be hiding out somewhere like the elves.As long as the fairies, the only species comparable to dwarves, were known to be extinct, it was safe to say that the dwarves were the best craftsmen in the entire Tionis continent.Due to Davey\u2019s success in the harvesting of moon grass, King Krianes would grant him one request. Most of the nobles were probably expecting him to ask for the position of the Crown Prince of the Rowane Kingdom, since it was vacant and no one had been selected yet. However, as Davey had no interest in that kind of position, he had boldly decided to ask for something different: to allow him into the dwarf tribe\u2019s village located in the southern region of the Rowane Kingdom.Befitting for the dwarves, who did not enjoy interactions with other species, the first condition they presented when interacting with humans was that only high-ranking people could enter the village. That mostly referred to the king or his proxy. To put it nicely, they were respectfully declining any visitation, but it really was no different from telling humans to keep out.Of course, most of the continent\u2019s dwarves traded items that they crafted for a few basic necessities from the kingdom under that very condition. The Rowane Kingdom had made a deal with the Yellowstone Tribe of dwarves located in the southern region and traded them quite a large amount of meat and liquor for crafted items every year. In fact, the sword on King Krianes\u2019 waist and all the crowns he wore were outstanding works made by the dwarves.Even the same iron sword differed greatly in terms of durability, sharpness, and the ability to conserve energy if it was made by the dwarves, which showed how extraordinary their skills were. Furthermore, since they were highly skilled in subjects like architecture, they were absolutely necessary to the Heins Territory, which was lacking in time, skills, and manpower.-But they would have to be insane to follow you into the Heins Territory.Davey nodded at Perserque\u2019s comment while staring at the line of carriages. Since the palace knew that he was trying to get in touch with the dwarf village, they couldn\u2019t send him off on his own. He was going as King Krianes\u2019 proxy, so it was inevitable for a large group of servants to travel with him. As a result, he couldn\u2019t do as he wanted and make the journey to find the Yellowstone Tribe with only a small party. Of course, he had to be satisfied with this, since this was the smallest party he could get.Theft is never good, try looking at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cYour Highness, we are soon entering the region of the Yellowstone Tribe.\u201d A high-ranking knight reported to Davey, who was reading a book while traveling on a horse.\u201cSure.\u201dAs they went through the mana gate and traveled for an entire day after that, the landscape became one of gigantic yellow rocks.Davey suddenly remembered how people responded when he had said that he wanted to meet the dwarves. Because he had already done something that stirred waves throughout the continent, the nobles had wondered what he was up to, and King Krianes had stared at him silently.\u2018Can I ask why?\u2019\u00a0King Krianes had asked.\u2018I need their help to repair the facilities in the territory,\u2019\u00a0Davey had replied.\u2018Hm\u2026\u2019\u2018Y\u2014Your Majesty! The dwarves are picky people! If we were to rub them the wrong way\u2026\u2019The nobles had been worried that Davey might cause trouble there, so they had shouted and strongly opposed Davey\u2019s request. However, Davey had simply ignored them all. It was natural that the nobles felt this way, since if Davey were to ruffle the dwarves\u2019 feathers and they left to another kingdom, it would be a huge loss.\u2018They are not humans. Davey, if you are trying to provoke them without thinking thoroughly\u2026 Even if it is a reward\u2026\u2019\u2018Do not worry; I will prepare a proposal that will make them unable to slam the door in my face, at the very least.\u2019Perhaps the knights who were traveling with Davey knew about this too, since they seemed to be watching him so that he didn\u2019t cause any trouble. He felt bad for them, since they were clearly anxious. But\u2026he was going to cause trouble.-The smell of iron and black smoke. It\u2019s quite a nostalgic scent.\u2018You\u2019ve had encounters with dwarves before?\u2019-Do you know how old I am? Of course I\u2019ve seen dwarves before.Perserque, who was floating up in the air and appreciating the view, looked intrigued as she smelled the metallic scent of iron and saw the black smoke. Davey didn\u2019t know how long she had been trapped in the sword for, but her expression of delight suggested that everything around her was new and fresh.The party stopped when they reached the large door made of wood and iron. It sat in between the gigantic rocks on the rocky terrain.\u201cStop! Who is it?!\u201dAs soon as Davey\u2019s party passed the rocky terrain, someone stopped them and peeked out from the top of a watchtower. It was the dwarves; they were about a meter tall, with inhumanly large muscles and a beard almost as long as their height.The dwarves located here were from the Yellowstone Tribe. They had huge battle-axes in their hands and wore durable armor; it seemed like they were the guards protecting the tribe.\u201cWe are from the royal palace of the Rowane Kingdom! Give us permission to enter the village of the Yellowstone Tribe!\u201d One of the high-ranking knights slowly pulled up on his horse and shouted.\u201cYou want permission to enter the village? We didn\u2019t hear anything about it.\u201d Since Davey had suddenly come here without sending word prior to his arrival, the dwarves looked like they were in a predicament.\u201cI have a proposal I think you\u2019d like to hear.\u201d Davey offered a friendly smile.The dwarf who had the flashiest armor and battle-axe among the guards stared at Davey as if he was deliberating. \u201cYou are?\u201d\u201cI am Davey, the First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom.\u201d\u201cAhem! I am Gerrit, the captain of the guards.\u201d Gerrit awkwardly coughed and nodded. \u201cWell, a promise is a promise. However, we cannot do business with your human kingdom because there is a big problem in the tribe right now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t do business with us?!\u201d One of the guards yelled.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know! Since a promise is a promise, come in! But leave the horses there; we are not that friendly with horses.\u201d Captain Gerrit said.The guards seemed annoyed, but Davey silently got off his horse and slowly walked toward the opening huge iron doors.* * *The Yellowstone Tribe\u2019s village was quite large. There were about two thousand dwarves living in this village; considering that dwarves generally lived in small tribes, the Yellowstone Tribe could be considered quite big.\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, it\u2019s moving on its own.\u201d\u201cHow is it moving like that?\u201dThe people in Davey\u2019s party followed him inside, and they couldn\u2019t hide their admiration as they were astonished by the automatic door and the various mechanical devices. It was rare for humans to enter a village of dwarves, unless there was something important. Even if Davey\u2019s entourage had seen dwarves before, it was their first time entering the village.Not only did the humans feel this way, but the dwarves did as well. The dwarves, who had been chattering lively and walking around, were now alert as Davey and his party showed up.\u201cHumans? How could humans come in here?\u201d\u201cAre they trying to attack us?\u201dThe dwarves stared at the party with various emotions in their eyes: anxiety, caution, and curiosity. The party was under the spotlight as everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to them.\u201cY\u2026 Your Highness, do you really think it will be okay?\u201d One of the guards asked Davey.Davey looked calm and said nothing. The guards were all afraid because their heads would be the ones sent flying if Davey were to provoke the dwarves.In the end, Davey simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t try to do anything, just stay here. I\u2019ll protect you guys no matter what happens.\u201dThe party seemed somewhat relieved by Davey\u2019s words, but they still looked a little anxious.Davey left most of the party outside and entered the building with gigantic mechanical devices only with a couple of knights following him. As he went in, he saw an old dwarf quietly waiting for him at a round table.The old dwarf had an unusually long beard and was distinctly large compared to the other dwarves. He seemed quite old, from the looks of his wrinkles, but appeared still sprightly, and the axe on his waist gave off an incredibly sharp energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay-Hm, his expression already shows that he thinks this is bothersome. This is unsurprising for such a proud species.It was expected of a species so stubborn that they didn\u2019t care about being threatened with a knife to their neck. They simply wouldn\u2019t budge in any sort of situation. Just as Perserque said, the old dwarf seemed like he had just let Davey in because Davey was a guest and they had a promise, but the old dwarf didn\u2019t seem too enthusiastic about the situation.\u2018Normally, dwarves have many tribe leaders, but it seems that everyone else is absent. He\u2019s the only one here.\u2019-It\u2019s rare for the leaders to leave the tribe unless it\u2019s for something important.After Perserque spoke, Davey silently stood in front of the old dwarf and then bowed to him with a distinct hand and body gesture. It was a unique greeting to dwarves and was often used among them. \u2018First impressions go a long way, right?\u2019Davey did have a proposal that would make the dwarves go nuts, but he decided to think it through for a bit more. He thought, \u2018Nothing good can come out from creating conflict, since there will be some dwarves who\u2019d become my territory\u2019s residents.\u2019\u201cMay the blessing of the God of Iron be with you. My name is Davey O\u2019Rowane, the First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom.\u201dPerhaps Davey\u2019s greeting was completely unexpected; the eyes of the dwarf elder, who was sitting at the table looking bored, suddenly sparkled. He spoke up. \u201cHuh? Ahem! I\u2019m Goulda, the Eighth Elder of the Yellowstone Tribe. I\u2019m surprised a human knows the greeting used by dwarves.\u201d\u201cDwarves are a species of outstanding craftsmen. One would be foolish to not treat those skills with respect.\u201dAs Davey buttered him up without batting an eye, it seemed like Goulda\u2019s expression softened a little. He replied, \u201cAhem! It\u2019s rare for me to like any human, but I like you. Well, the other grandpa elders are all busy, so I came here instead.\u201d\u201cThank you for your time.\u201d\u201cSince the Rowane Kingdom has done business with our Yellowstone Tribe for a long time, this is the least that I could do.\u201dCurrently, the kingdom was starting to crumble from the nobles\u2019 tyranny, but the Rowane Kingdom had been a pretty good place to live in the past. There didn\u2019t use to be much discrimination based on social status or species, and everyone had shown respect for one another. It was only recently that the nobility, who were led by Duke Bariatta, was running wilder\u2026 But they had no reason to provoke the dwarves unless they were idiots. So, thanks to the pleasant impression of the past, Davey was able to enter the dwarf village rather easily.\u201cSure. So, what brings a greenhorn prince like you to the village? As you know, most deals happen outside the village,\u201d Goulda stated.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Davey replied.\u201cIn fact, I believe that the business period between our tribe and your kingdom hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201dDavey quietly nodded at Goulda. \u201cThat\u2019s right. According to the contract, the business period isn\u2019t for a few months.\u201d\u201cThen, what is it?\u201d\u201cActually, I have come here to ask for your cooperation on a few different things. The beer and meat in the carts outside are just to show my appreciation.\u201dGoulda stroked his thick beard, which was tied up. He soon appeared to be bored. \u201cAhem! I don\u2019t dislike humans that know their manners. And I also don\u2019t dislike your human beer made of barley. However, we, the Yellowstone Tribe, cannot give you the thing that you want.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dGoulda didn\u2019t bother explaining any further. \u201cI can\u2019t discuss any more details with an outsider.\u201d He paused slightly and sighed. Then, he went on. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to say is this: since you have come a long way, I won\u2019t expel you right away. You can stay here for a few days, but I\u2019m warning the others that you will be kicked out immediately if you cause any problems.\u201dAs Goulda stood up like he had nothing more to say, the knights seemed a little angered. They felt that they had been disrespected alongside Davey, whom they had escorted here.Davey silently raised his hand and stopped the knights from doing anything. He glanced at Goulda, then brought out his authority. \u2018[Check Information].\u2019Beep!\u2018Even dwarves can\u2019t escape the authority of the Demon Lord.\u2019-Name: Goulda.-Age: 180.-Sex: Male.-Species: Dwarf.-Title: None.-Status Effects: Tired; annoyed; contemplating.-Notes: The Eighth Elder of the Yellowstone Tribe, and the youngest.-Current Emotion: Wants to focus on refining the Primordial Inferno, the divine sword of dwarves; annoyed by the fact he was forced out here to face humans because he is the youngest; a little curious and interested as it had been a long time since humans had entered the village; feeling somewhat friendly to the castor, who knows his manners; thinking that having to host them is bothersome.Dwarves generally had a lifespan of 250 years, so Goulda\u2019s age wasn\u2019t particularly surprising.As the bothered Goulda silently glanced over at him, Davey focused on one thing written on the translucent box in front of him: [Primordial Inferno]. He found it familiar, since he had heard it from the crazy blacksmith who had been married to his hammer.[There is one thing I made with those guys, but it was a long time ago and I made it when I wasn\u2019t as skilled\u2026 Honestly, the quality isn\u2019t so good. Back then, those midgets and I celebrated for days, because we were so proud.][Are you asking how outstanding it is? Bring me something that you made.][Well, I think it\u2019s about this good. You think it\u2019s funny? There\u2019s no one who masters a craft right from the beginning! Whatever. Hammer already!]\u201cThen we\u2019ll stay here for a few days. Thank you.\u201d Davey instantly understood what was going on and smiled.25. Uh, Give Me A Hammer.The village of dwarves was usually pretty loud. Perhaps to compensate for their small height and size, their rowdy, chattering voices were as loud as a foghorn. And unlike elves, they had lively and vigorous personalities. Most of their days were boisterous.A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.There were two things that dwarves couldn\u2019t live without: alcohol and gambling. There were some who would gamble everything and be ruined, but these dwarves were a strange species that stopped gambling after reaching a certain limit.\u2018That\u2019s probably why they\u2019ve lived for so long.\u2019Davey, who was being treated relatively well by the dwarves, spent his time relaxing as if he had no regrets. The dwarves seemed troubled by the problem in the village, but he didn\u2019t involve himself and simply gathered information from the outside. Not everything would go the way he had thought; there wouldn\u2019t be anything funnier than if he failed after confidently stepping up.-Is the Primordial Inferno an extraordinary sword?\u201cTo be honest, it is an exceptional sword by common standards.\u201d-But to your standards?\u201cIt is something I could make if I had the time.\u201dThe Primordial Inferno wasn\u2019t a sword made for attacking; it was simply the sword that the dwarves worshiped.Surtr, the ancient hero, and a few dwarf craftsmen had forged this sword, giving it a few abilities, such as harmony, development, and the blessing of the God of Blacksmiths, to make it a significant symbol. There were probably many more abilities aside from these, but Surtr hadn\u2019t gone into the details, and Davey hadn\u2019t taken interest in it either.To be honest, from the moment the Primordial Inferno had broken apart, it was safe to say that its significance and meaning was already gone. It might\u2019ve been different if Surtr\u2019s techniques had been passed down, but without that, it was simply difficult to mimic his distinct techniques even with a considerable amount of effort.\u201cI guess the Primordial Inferno is closer to a prototype.\u201d-Prototype?\u201cSo like\u2026 How should I explain this? Ah, I should say that this is the start of Caldeiras. Although the usages are different, the crafting method used is similar.\u201dThat was probably why the dwarves were racking their brains to fix the sword. It was a special method of crafting with mana, and most craftsmen didn\u2019t even think to try it because of their pride and fear of failure. However, this world revolved around both the laws of physics and anti-physics: the laws of physics operated with physical power, and the laws of anti-physics operated with mana, a huge mass of energy. This world consisted of those two laws, and that probably wasn\u2019t any different on Earth.-It\u2019s the basic theory for mages.\u201cWhether it be the divine sword or the Primordial Inferno, the challenge is to harmonize those two laws well. Most craftsmen don\u2019t even attempt it because they want to see the limit by purely working with metals.\u201d\u2018Of course, there were some oddballs.\u2019\u201cFrom hammering to handling ingots, everything about the traditional way had to be turned upside down. Only a sliver of the mana crafting method would be understood even after abandoning all existing knowledge. You think those narrow-minded dwarves would invent it? No way.\u201dThe dwarves weren\u2019t able to do that because they weren\u2019t human, and because their pride was too great and their skills were too excellent.-Then why is an object as great as that doing here?\u201cThe Primordial Inferno is the first work of the humans and dwarves. It\u2019s made to promote harmony between them. Well, I haven\u2019t heard any details either,\u201d Davey calmly explained, then got up.-Where are you going?\u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a bit of fun, right? Now, I have to do my job.\u201dTaking the dwarves back to the Heins Territory was a minor problem; Davey\u2019s main goal was to borrow the Great Furnace that had a concentration of highly advanced skills.-If that\u2019s what you were complaining about, you could\u2019ve just made it yourself\u2026\u201cIt\u2019d take a long time to make it with the current technology. I will borrow the furnace and the skills, and that will be a pretty good selling point for the dwarves.\u201d Davey chuckled and left the room without hesitation.When Davey suddenly appeared, the curious dwarf children peeked at him from afar before quickly disappearing. It seemed like humans were pretty unfamiliar to them, since only a few dwarves had actually come into contact with humans before\u2026-So? I don\u2019t think those stubborn people will easily let you borrow the Great Furnace.\u201cFirst\u2026\u201d Davey looked around rather thoughtfully, then started moving after having found something. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the tavern first?\u201d-Alcohol?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was important to have a plan.Dwarves mostly enjoyed gambling and indulging in alcohol. Not all dwarves were like this, but because most dwarves were surprisingly good at self-control, they do enjoy gambling in moderation. In fact, those that were stressed and frustrated from work usually relieved their stress by drinking and gambling, since even the most extraordinary craftsman experienced stress.Davey stepped into the tavern and the Eighth Elder Goulda recognized him immediately. The old dwarf asked, \u201cHm? What are you doing here?\u201d\u2018I thought he was too busy to do business, but he\u2019s drinking here?\u2019It seemed like the old dwarf had been drinking here for a while, since the number of glasses in front of him were enough to leave any human speechless.As Davey sat in front of Goulda with a laid-back attitude, Davey scoffed and said, \u201cI thought you were quite busy, but it seems that you have some time to relax. Let\u2019s have a drink together.\u201d\u201cHmph! Even the most important matters need to be slept on. To rush into dealing with the matter is, in fact, worse than doing nothing at all. And right now, Big Brother Goulda has kicked us all out, so\u2026 But you said you want to have a drink?\u201d\u201cI heard the dwarf-made spirit is quite strong.\u201dIt was not the Eighth Elder Goulda who responded, but Gerrit, the captain of the dwarf guards, who was nearby. \u201cWhat? Spirit?\u201d\u2018I thought he\u2019d be watching the door, but he\u2019s here drinking, too. Alright.\u2019\u201cHey Malcolm! This human here wants to drink the dwarf-made spirit!\u201d Gerrit shouted.\u201cHuh?\u201dEveryone suddenly perked up. The dwarves, who were too drunk to even realize that Davey had entered the tavern, looked at him in fascination. It was as if they were looking at a mystical animal.\u201cPhahahaha!\u201d\u201cYou want to drink the spirit? You\u2019re out of your mind! And the person you\u2019re drinking with is Elder Goulda?\u201dPeople began chattering from all over, as if they had understood what Davey had meant.\u201cHey, human. You said your name was Davey?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m warning you, but the alcohol content in dwarf-made spirit is no joke. It\u2019s too strong for a human to drink.\u201d\u201cWell, this is nothing.\u201d Davey grinned and chugged down a glass of spirit that was right in front of Goulda. He felt a strong yet clean scent of alcohol punch his nose.\u201cHup!\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dAt the same time, the dwarves, who were chattering and laughing nearby, looked surprised.\u201cWhew! This is what alcohol should be like.\u201d Davey chuckled and clicked his tongue.-I don\u2019t understand why people drink alcohol\u2026\u2018To be honest, it\u2019s just super strong and doesn\u2019t taste good at all.\u2019\u201cIt feels a little weak, but it doesn\u2019t matter. So, Eighth Elder. Would you care for a battle?\u201d Davey asked.Goulda squinted at Davey. He still looked a little bothered when he gradually widened his eyes in surprise. \u201cHey, are you really okay? You chugged that down in one shot. Can you tell how many fingers I am holding up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Davey replied.\u201cPahahaha!!!\u201d Goulda burst out in laughter, but he soon slammed his glass on the table and stared at Davey intensely. \u201cAlright. We dwarves don\u2019t treat good drinks poorly! Let\u2019s do it! Hey, Malcolm! I\u2019ll pay for everything, so bring this greenhorn prince all the drinks that he wants!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not responsible for anything!\u201d The muscular dwarf wearing an apron walked into the kitchen while shaking his head. Then, he put down several glasses filled with the same amount of spirit as Goulda had.\u201cDwarves love a good bet. On the off chance that you win, what do you what? Although, I\u2019m not in the position to grant whatever your request is because of the important matters at hand.\u201d\u201cI just want to hear your story.\u201d\u2018Approach them slowly.\u2019As if he liked Davey\u2019s response, Goulda let out a hearty laugh. Then, they simultaneously grabbed the handles of their wooden glasses and glared at each other. Goulda warned, \u201cI won\u2019t go easy on you. If I win, you will leave this place. Although it\u2019s been a long time since a human I like has come here, the timing isn\u2019t good right now.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dSupport us at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.* * *\u201cGroan\u2026 Hey, I\u2019m totally fine. Why don\u2019t you give up?\u201d Goulda asked Davey.\u201cI think you\u2019re at your limit.\u201d\u201cDamn\u2026 You are one nasty human\u2026\u201dDavey had thought that Goulda would be more stubborn, but Goulda was fair and honorable. To Davey, who had a master-level abundance of mana, being drunk meant nothing to him in the first place. Well, he was sort of holding out with his willpower, but even though his physical strength wasn\u2019t like the past, his willpower still was.-A true fraud.\u2018I can win against him even without mana.\u2019-What did you have to do to get like this?Davey reminisced about his past since Perserque asked him in amazement. He remembered one of his swordsmanship teachers: the man who had instantly united the World of Martial Arts as soon as he appeared. At first, he wondered how a man who was remembered as a terrifying being could have become a hero. However, the man had been a human being with feelings. The other heroes of the Hall called Dokgo Jun, the Heavenly Destroyer, \u2018The Hero of One Person\u2019.-The Hero of One Person\u2026\u2018Well, I\u2019ve only kind of heard tales of that world, so\u2026\u2019Whatever it was, Dokgo Jun was the reason why Davey could drink a crazy amount of alcohol. The man had been the greatest drunkard to have ever lived. Since even Daphne, the immoral saintess who liked to drink, had warned Davey to never have a drink with him, it was clear how much of a heavy drinker the man had been. The problem was that because Davey had learned swordsmanship from him, he had often had drinks with him. Thinking back, Davey thought that maybe the most difficult thing he had to endure while training at the Hall was having had to have that damn drink. Since Dokgo Jun\u2019s usual spirits could even wipe out transcendent beings who handled mana, it had been difficult for Davey to bear it.\u2018Compared to his, dwarf spirit is nothing.\u2019[Hiccup!\u00a0You want to learn more? Hiccup!\u00a0Then get me another bottle. I\u2019ll teach you if you can tolerate it. Just so you know, if you pass out, I\u2019m going to work you hard.]The image of Dokgo Jun worshiping alcohol as a god and working as the missionary was still fresh in Davey\u2019s memory.\u201cHiccup! I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see a human better at drinking than a dwarf\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are many kinds of people in the world, right?\u201d\u201cPahahaha! Hiccup! Everything looks like\u2026it\u2019s spinning\u2026\u201dThud! Finally, Goulda gave in to his intoxication and slept with his head slammed against the table. It was clear who the winner was.\u201cWow! Grandpop Goulda fell!\u201d\u201cWhat a rare sight!\u201d\u201cPahahaha!!!\u201dAs Goulda fell asleep, the surroundings became rowdy again. Even the dwarves, who were shocked at how much Davey was able to drink, laughed and chattered.\u2018A few seconds ago, he couldn\u2019t even hold himself up properly from being so drunk. Now, he has good judgment.\u2019\u201cHey, you human! Amazing!\u201d\u201cMy, how did you drink all that?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe the drunkard of our tribe passed out like that!\u201d\u2018The best?\u2019\u00a0Davey chuckled and stared at Goulda, but the old dwarf had already passed out from all the alcohol.-You\u2019re going to have to wait a day.\u2018I think so, too.\u2019Watching Goulda be carried out by other dwarves, Davey turned his glance over to the remaining dwarves and smiled. \u201cWho wants to be my next competitor?\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve ignited their competitive spirit, so I should at least make a campfire with it.\u2019* * *\u201cWell, a bet is a bet. Okay, what are you so curious about?\u201d Goulda asked.\u201cDid you say the Primordial Inferno has been causing the village to be so disorderly?\u201d Davey threw a question back.After hearing Davey\u2019s question, Goulda suddenly went stiff from going all limp from the alcohol. Then, with a chuckle, he slumped onto the table. \u201cWell, what can be done? The problem is the old sword that had been protecting our Yellowstone Tribe has broken.\u201d\u201cIt broke?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s strange.\u201d Goulda seemed dissatisfied by something and let out a sigh.\u201cThen, can\u2019t you just give up on it?\u201d Davey asked.Goulda stared at Davey as if he was trying to figure out the intentions behind Davey\u2019s honest question. \u201cEven though it\u2019s old and not made for attacking, it\u2019s kind of like our spiritual anchor, in a way.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I apologize.\u201d\u201cUsually, the tribes take turns taking care of the sword. The tribe that receives the sword must take care of the sword for a certain amount of time; that is the promise and the rule. It\u2019s been under the care of my father\u2026 But my brother and I are in charge of it now, because my father returned to the earth much earlier than we had expected.\u201dAfter hearing Goulda\u2019s explanation, Davey managed to figure out the current situation. It was the Yellowstone Tribe\u2019s turn to take care of the dwarves\u2019 sacred weapon, but after Goulda\u2019s father, who had been the only one fit to manage the sword, had passed so early, Goulda and his brother were hurried into taking over the role. Then, now that the sword itself had broken apart\u2026 Davey could sort of understand the situation.As Davey nodded his head slowly, Goulda stared at him silently. Goulda asked Davey, \u201cOkay, since I like you, I will ask this question: is that all you wish to know?\u201dDavey smiled. Dwarves had a strong sense of pride, but they were kind to species they found friendly and likable. All he did was have a drink with Goulda, but of course, he didn\u2019t try to maintain a good impression for nothing. He said, \u201cActually, I am a little skilled in blacksmithing, so\u2026 Would I be able to watch you do your work as a late learner?\u201dGoulda flinched as he heard Davey\u2019s question.* * *As soon as the sun came up, Goulda quickly headed to the Central Workshop, the best workshop of the Yellowstone Tribe, as if he was never drunk. Davey quietly followed along.Although magic existed in this world, scientific technology was less developed than Earth because magic was much more advanced. In fact, when the people on Earth used technology to raise the temperature of a blast furnace, most kingdoms and empires required the help of magic or alchemy. All that the furnaces of a smithy in a territory or city could do were tasks like melting iron and such, but\u2026The Great Furnace of the dwarves was different. This enormous furnace, the pinnacle of the dwarves\u2019 skills and crafts, was their pride. Hundreds of spinning wheels spun to automatically operate bellows, and it withstood extremely high temperatures because it was made out of a special material. As such, the temperature the Great Furnace could go up to was about 3000 degrees celsius. Of course, even this Great Furnace would start to crumble if the temperature was raised higher than that.-I can\u2019t believe that all this was made without any magic or alchemy and just by their craft.Intrigued by Davey\u2019s explanation, Perserque flew beside Davey while nodding. Even though she had lived for a long time, she still couldn\u2019t have seen something like this. This was unsurprising since she had mostly lived in spirit form.\u201cOh, Gol\u2026 Hey, who did you bring in here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A few of the oldest dwarves frowned when they saw Goulda leading Davey inside. Addressing them, Goulda said, \u201cCan\u2019t you see? It\u2019s the human who has come to visit the village.\u201d\u201cGoulda, you\u2019ve gone mad!\u201d\u201cHow dare you bring a human into this place?!\u201dThe old dwarves responded just as Davey had expected. Goulda was the Eighth Elder, meaning that there were other elders, and the other elders had refused to meet Davey because of their work in the Great Furnace. Among them, he could see an old dwarf who looked very similar to Goulda.\u201cGoulda,\u201d the dwarf said.\u201cBig brother.\u201d\u201cExplain this nonsense.\u201dAs the dwarves glared at Davey with cold eyes, Goulda let out a deep sigh. He explained to his brother, \u201cIt was a bet. Apparently, this greenhorn prince from the Rowane Kingdom knows blacksmithing.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just trying to let him shadow our work here for a little while.\u201d\u201cSo, you brought a human into this Central Workshop? Goulda! Are you insane?! You\u2019re still drunk, aren\u2019t you?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine! It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve met a human that I like. As one of the elders, please trust my judgment and have faith in this greenhorn prince.\u201d\u201cGoulda, you\u2026!\u201dGoulda was unexpectedly brave. He did initially find Davey bothersome at first, as did the other elders, but he was a man who kept his promise. At that moment, he addressed Davey, \u201cHey, you greenhorn prince.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Davey.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, Davey. This is all I can do for you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cA promise is a promise. I am helping you today, but don\u2019t think I will do this again.\u201d\u201cThis is enough for me.\u201d Davey smiled.As if he didn\u2019t like how Davey was smiling, Goulda scoffed and turned away. He said to the other dwarves, \u201cWhat are you all doing?! I told you we have important work to do today!\u201d\u201cDamn it! What is this nonsense?!\u201d A dwarf even threw his hammer on the ground. They were probably infuriated that Davey, a human, had entered the Great Furnace.-They\u2019re overreacting.\u2018Even time doesn\u2019t change the stubbornness of craftsmen. Since I\u2019m the one doing something completely impudent right now, don\u2019t get too angry.\u2019Perserque puffed up her cheeks in discontent.-You\u2019re just going to let them talk to you like that?\u2018I would react in the same way, too.\u2019The weapon being worked on here was a legacy of Davey\u2019s teacher, Surtr. Davey had seen the divine sword, and he was in possession of his teacher\u2019s last work, the two twin swords. All that was left to see was one of his teacher\u2019s past works, which was in the Great Furnace.\u201cDamn it! You learned blacksmithing? Do you even know what we\u2019re doing here?\u201d One of the dwarves shouted at Goulda.\u201cGod, it\u2019s not just any weapon; it\u2019s the thousand-year-old sacred object!\u201d Another added.\u201cI know! Everyone, I am asking for a favor on behalf of my position as an elder.\u201dThe infuriated dwarves closed their mouths once Goulda shouted with determination. However, their hostility toward Davey did not subside easily.-Is there a reason to help these people?\u2018Who said anything about helping them? I\u2019m just here to trade diamonds for corn.\u2019\u00a0Davey was just taking a look around before he could make a trade.\u201cHave a little mercy on the late learner,\u201d Goulda pleaded.\u201cWhat are you all doing? Goulda is an elder, too! If he has decided so, we must respect it!\u201d Right then, the old dwarf who looked exactly like Goulda helped him out. He was Golgouda, Goulda\u2019s older brother and the First Elder who was taking care of the Primordial Inferno in this generation. As the First Elder, he was the highest-ranking one, so it was safe to assume that he was the commander of the entire Yellowstone Tribe.\u201cAhem\u2026 I will allow it since Elder Golgouda has spoken.\u201d\u201cHowever, this mustn\u2019t happen again!\u201dPerhaps Elder Golgouda had a much stronger influence than expected. The dwarves who initially complained simply picked up their hammers from the floor and began to focus on their work again.\u201cHuman.\u201d Elder Golgouda glanced at Davey.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI gave you permission on account of my younger brother. But if you get caught doing any funny business, I will crush your skull with my battle-axe.\u201dWhen Davey smiled at his threat, Golgouda just turned and walked away. It was as if he didn\u2019t like Davey\u2019s response.* * *The Primordial Inferno was a gigantic sword with an antique design. It was about two meters in length and had a blade that was easily over 30 centimeters in width. Although it was called a sword, it looked closer to being a structure with many parts attached to it. It wasn\u2019t a weapon made for attacking, but maybe that was because it couldn\u2019t slash.The sword, a sacred item of the dwarf village, was placed in the center of the black workshop. It looked half-broken but still magnificent. Davey just stared at the Primordial Inferno without a word.-What are you looking at so closely?\u2018That can\u2019t be fixed.\u2019\u00a0Davey, who was silently looking at the sword, decided boldly. He said to Perserque, \u2018Fix it? Fixing it is as disrespectful and stupid as trying to revive an old man who died after living a good life. They\u2019re better off making a new one. That sword is too old.\u2019The Primordial Inferno was crafted using the same method that was used to make Caldeiras, but unlike the divine sword, it was never completed. That was why it wasn\u2019t able to withstand the long period of time.\u201cWhat are you all doing?! Pull it!!\u201d\u201cHey! Where\u2019s the iron you made?!\u201d\u201cYou damn people! Hammer properly?! Do you all want to die?!\u201dThe workshop was like a battlefield. All the dwarves were highly skilled, but they would never be able to fix the Primordial Inferno even if they all worked on it. There was no reason for the dwarves to work this hard on any regular sword, but the Primordial Inferno was a sword imbued with many blessings. It was more of a magical instrument than a regular sword. That was why the dwarves were carefully taking it apart piece by piece and working on it delicately.-They have a nasty personality, but they are surprisingly hard workers.As Davey watched the dwarves discuss their next steps and then cautiously work on the sword, Perserque mumbled as if feeling surprised.\u2018Did you just realize that dwarves have a hot temper?\u2019-I know they do.Even if they had a nasty personality, the dwarves were extremely polite to those that they respected. This was the first time Davey had met a dwarf, but he had heard about them before.The sun was starting to come down, but the dwarves continued on with the restoration work that had started early in the morning. Davey was impressed by how they were grinding their souls into their hammering and how hard they were studying the sword.Davey got lost in his thoughts as he sat comfortably and observed the dwarves, like a lion watching its prey. \u2018With that passion and skills, they would be perfect for the development of the territory.\u2019The dwarves were much more talented than Davey had thought. Although, there was no way they would come to his territory and fix the facilities even if he asked, since they weren\u2019t focusing on anything else other than that sword right now.The most hardworking and fastest dwarf among them was First Elder Golgouda, the older brother of Goulda who had brought Davey here. He was silently hammering away, not thinking about his health. It was as if he had committed a sin.Support us at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cDamn! Golgouda, you\u2019re going to collapse if you keep working like that! Get some rest!\u201d One of the dwarves shouted to Golgouda.\u201cI\u2019m fine! Where are the pliers? Get me the next piece!\u201d\u201cDamn it!!\u201dGolgouda was pushing himself so much that the other dwarves went pale just from watching him. He probably felt the most responsible for the Primordial Inferno breaking, since he was supposed to take good care of it. And since the sword broke as soon as Golgouda and Goulda had inherited the management of the sword from their father who had passed, it seemed inevitable for him to feel guilty.Davey clicked his tongue at Golgouda, who was fiercely working while clenching his jaw. \u2018Working like that isn\u2019t going to solve anything.\u2019To be frank, Davey could see that Golgouda didn\u2019t have a clear judgment right now, but he could also see that Golgouda\u2019s outstanding skills were the only thing allowing Golgouda to hold on to the sword. The old dwarf was desperately working on the sword even though he wasn\u2019t skilled enough to fix it. He was basically taking one step forward and one step back, making no progress. Whatever it was, all the dwarves did was just hold on to a glimmer of hope.Davey was silently watching the dwarves work when an opportunity for him to step up appeared unexpectedly. A dwarf wearing black barged into the workshop and said, \u201cHa! These damn Yellowstone Tribe folks. You guys managed to break the sword.\u201d\u201cTorrs?\u201d\u201cWhy did the Blackstone Tribe show up here?\u201dThe other dwarves murmured.The Blackstone Tribe was a tribe of dwarves who were located in the southern part of the continent.\u2018When did they come here? The Blackstone Tribe is pretty far from this place.\u2019The workshop went silent at Torrs' sudden appearance, except for one person. Torrs commented, \u201cYou all speak so shamelessly when you have destroyed the sacred item.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth, Torrs!\u201d Goulda shouted, incapable of containing his anger.Torrs, the dwarf in black, just shrugged his shoulders and came into the Central Workshop.\u2018This is getting interesting!\u2019Torrs watched the other dwarves and smirked at Golgouda, who was ignoring his approach. He said provocatively, \u201cWhat do you think, Elder Golgouda? I didn\u2019t really like the fact that the sword was in your possession in the first place.\u201d\u201cYou!!\u201d\u201cGive the sword to the Blackstone Tribe now. Our craftsmen are probably better than this. Ptui!\u201dThe other dwarves frowned in anger as they saw Torrs spit on the ground and provoke their First Elder.\u201cThat\u2019s not true! We have the finest elder in our tribe!\u201d\u201cHa! That\u2019s funny. Not even the best elder of the Blackstone Tribe will be able to fix this!\u201d\u201cEven though you say that, you have struggled to fix this sword for a while,\u201d Torrs remarked.Perhaps it was because Torrs spoke the truth. The other dwarves clenched their jaws in fury.However, Golgouda silently hammered at a piece of the Primordial Inferno. Clang!! Clang!! He ignored Torrs and desperately swung his hammer over and over again, like he was praying.\u201cHand it over now. Don\u2019t insult the sacred sword any longer!\u201d Torrs shouted, and the frowns of the other dwarves deepened.At the same time, Golgouda\u2019s hammering intensified. It rang out.Some dwarves were so enraged that their jaws were clenched and their eyes were red. Davey could practically feel their anger just by looking at them.\u201cThis has been discussed and agreed upon by all the elders of the other tribes. We can\u2019t leave the sword in the hands of the least skilled tribe. Well, I would\u2019ve been able to trust you if Great Elder Gould was here.\u201dAs everything was based on abilities and skills for dwarves, no one could say anything to Torrs.Clang!! Clang!! The intense hammering sound rang throughout the entire workshop, and that was when it happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had a hopeless gaze, as if he was looking at a terminal patient.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Everyone let out a shameful sigh and frowned. Then, Elder Golgouda also glared at the Primordial Inferno and ground his teeth. He seemed so infuriated that tears were forming in his eyes.\u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing more to see here! The men of our tribe are here! Don\u2019t be stubborn and hand it over now!\u201d Torres yelled in anger.While Golgouda collapsed onto his knees with a dejected expression, a few young dwarf men followed Torres into the workshop and began taking the parts of the Primordial Inferno. They wrapped the separate pieces in the cloth they had prepared.-You?Davey was done organizing his thoughts. He knew that not everything in the world would go his way, but he felt this situation had become more complicated than he had expected.\u201cHuh?\u201dDavey silently stood up and went into the Central Workshop, grabbing a small hammer near him as he headed in. The dwarves looked at him with puzzled expressions, but he walked past them and reached the Primordial Inferno. Then, he stared at Golgouda, who was sitting hopelessly near the sword.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cMay I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cElder, are you really a true craftsman?\u201d Davey\u2019s voice was far colder than anyone had imagined.26. Let\u2019s Call You Blue Ribbon and Red Ribbon.The heated atmosphere of the Central Workshop grew cold in seconds. At first, Elder Golgouda did not understand what Davey was saying; however, as realization dawned upon him, he glared at Davey with bulging eyes. His gaze was one of intense anger, and he looked like he wanted to grab his hammer and hit Davey with it right this second. Golgouda asked quietly, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cA true craftsman feels the soul of what they are making and respects it. But you, Elder, threw it away from the beginning.\u201dGolgouda flinched at Davey\u2019s reply.[Although it\u2019s very faint, a soul enters everything that a craftsman creates. A person who disrespects this fact has no right to be called a craftsman. Crush their heads!]There was one thing that Davey had mastered at a similar level to his teacher at the Hall, and that was blacksmithing. Out of all the heroes who had taught Davey, Surtr had been most devoted to teaching him and the fastest to improve him. It wasn\u2019t because he had been an exceptional teacher, but because Davey was unique in that he had learned many other skills, such as magic, swordsmanship, alchemy, holy power, and more. Normally, one\u2019s lifetime was too short and people didn\u2019t have the capacity to master all these subjects. In that sense, the skills Surtr had taught Davey coincidentally suited him well. Although, he couldn\u2019t catch up to the delicate handwork of that crazy talented blacksmith.\u201cA human?\u201d Torres, the dwarf of the Blackstone Tribe, frowned when he noticed that Davey was here. He shouted, \u201cHey, Grandpops Golgouda. Now you\u2019re bringing humans into the Central Workshop? Since when did the Central Workshop become a place where anyone could enter?!\u201d\u201cDavey! Stand back! You\u2019re not part of this!!\u201d Eighth Elder Goulda, who brought Davey here, quickly tried to stop Davey as soon as Torrs spoke. Still, he kept his eyes on Golgouda.\u201cLet me change the question. Do you really want to fix this?\u201d Davey asked Golgouda.\u201cWhat are you saying? Of course, I\u2026\u201d Golgouda replied with a frown. However, Davey cut him off before he could finish.\u201cThen why did you do it?\u201dGolgouda\u2019s eyes widened at Davey\u2019s question.\u201cDoes pride sustain you?\u201dAfter speaking, Davey walked over to where a piece of the Primordial Inferno was located. Then, he tapped on its surface with a small hammer. Clang\u2026 Clang\u2026\u00a0He could hear a clear ring that sounded nothing like hammering metal. It resonated through the workshop.\u201cTsk. It\u2019s long gone. It can\u2019t be used.\u201d Davey clicked his tongue.The mana circulation system of the Primordial Inferno had come to an end. A regular lump of metal could last for tens of thousands of years if properly maintained, but it was impossible for an artifact mixed with mana to last that long since the metal itself would become weathered by the mana.\u201cHey, human! What are you doing?! How dare you get near that! Get away!\u201dA few dwarves came to their senses and ran over to Davey to stop him.\u201cWhat are you thinking? How dare you interfere here.\u201d\u201cGet lost right now!\u201dThe atmosphere began heating up again as the dwarves scowled, looking like they were going to smash Davey\u2019s head in with their hammers if he did something.\u201cThis exceeds his authority! We must formally make a complaint to the Rowane Kingdom!\u201d\u201cElder Goulda! How are you going to take responsibility for this?\u201dThe voices of the livid dwarves were getting louder, and some dwarves were coming at Davey to try and pull Davey away.\u201cElder Golgouda.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have an answer?\u201dGolgouda squinted at Davey, as if trying to figure Davey out. \u201cYou. What kind of nonsense is\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you not want to fix it? Or are you trying to escape reality by giving an already dead artifact misplaced significance?\u201dSome of the dwarves flinched at Davey\u2019s words. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cThree thousand years, right? I think it\u2019s been that long since the Primordial Inferno has been made, and it has tirelessly protected this village for that time.\u201dAs Golgouda clenched his jaw, Davey continued, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to revive a sword that has passed its natural lifespan? You call yourselves craftsmen? This precious sword has been your spiritual anchor, and yet you treat it like this?\u201dRegardless of pride, this sword was a work of Davey\u2019s teacher, meaning that this matter somewhat concerned Davey too. Thud!!\u00a0As soon as Davey stopped speaking, he roughly moved his arms, and the couple of dwarves who held him simply fell onto the floor.\u201cWoah!!\u201d\u201cKeugh!\u201d\u201cSince when did dwarves become this shameless?\u201d Davey remarked.Dwarves were a race of craftsmen; they were skilled and deserved to be called the best in the continent. So how could they not know the condition of an item that had died and could no longer be revived?\u2018That\u2019s bullshit.\u2019\u00a0Davey shrugged off the dwarves who were holding him back and took a quick look at the sword part in his hand. Then, he threw it into the nearby furnace without hesitation.\u201cNo!!\u201dSome of the dwarves screamed, but Davey walked over to another sword part and did the same thing. The dwarves swarmed him, but he kept throwing the parts into the furnace without a word.\u201cYou damn human!\u201d\u201cDo you want to die?!\u201dWith menacing, bloodshot eyes, the dwarves swung their hammers at Davey like they were trying to kill him. Even if it was broken, the Primordial Inferno was probably still the symbol of their species. However, some dwarves, including Elder Golgouda and Torres, the dwarf from the Blackstone Tribe, just vacantly stared at Davey.\u201cN\u2026 No\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201dAt last, the dwarves collapsed onto their knees with blank expressions. They looked at the sword parts that were thrown into the furnace. There were looks of anger, emptiness, and extreme confusion. Some dwarves were even shedding tears in frustration.\u2018Man, I really look like the asshole here.\u2019-I\u2019ve never seen those stubborn bulls be that dismal.Ignoring Perserque\u2019s chatter, Davey coldly criticized the dwarves, \u201cThe sword is already dead, but you just don\u2019t know if you can make a new one.\u201d\u201cShut up! You don\u2019t know anything! Stop speaking as if you do!\u201d\u201cI should beat you to death!\u201dSome of the dwarves threateningly glared at Davey.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even try because you thought it was impossible? You guys are supposed to be the greatest craftsmen!!\u201dCrash!! As Davey roughly kicked the anvil near him, the anvil crumpled as if it had been hit with a large metal ball.\u201cStop it! How miserable are you going to make us?!\u201d One of the bitter-looking elders shouted in sorrow.The dwarves probably knew that it was pointless trying to fix this sword, which had already reached the end of its life, and that they weren\u2019t skilled enough to create a new one. They couldn\u2019t admit it because of their strong sense of pride, and it led them to self-rationalize and believe that nothing could ever replace this sword. It was the worst thing a craftsman could do.\u201cWe are the most skilled among the craftsmen in this continent, and even we couldn\u2019t restore it!\u201d The dwarves shouted, \u201cThen, are you saying that you can create this damn sacred sword?\u201dA quick look at tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w will leave you more fulfilled.\u201cYes,\u201d Davey replied calmly.\u201cYou must be joking! Even the best craftsmen cannot handle the metal refined with that strange arrangement, and you think you can do it?! A greenhorn human prince?\u201d\u201cIt is none other than the work of the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019! It\u2019s not something that can be made with your trivial skills!\u201d\u201cThen just accept it and learn, you people,\u201d Davey said.-Think of it in this way. Your plan is useless if you can\u2019t win them over\u2026\u2018Let\u2019s think of it as a warm-up.\u2019\u00a0As soon as Davey made his decision, he began to move. He quickly gathered a few things in the workshop and started his work. He classified the reagents by smelling them and neatly organized the tools he needed in one place. \u2018This should be good for the materials.\u2019It was befitting to be called the Central Workshop, the place where the best of the best craftsmen gathered; this was the dwarves\u2019 pride and dignity.Davey immediately turned to face the enormous Great Furnace that could reach up to 3000 degrees Celsius. It was the dwarves\u2019 pride, the pinnacle of their skills. A red fire was still wavering inside from its earlier use. He could feel the intense heat that prevented any regular person from approaching it.However, releasing his mana, Davey stuck his hand inside the furnace without hesitation and cast a spell with his hands. A strange unfamiliarity followed, since this method used mana in a completely different way. It was the mana crafting method: the method that most craftsmen didn\u2019t dare to try, and the specialty and vision of Surtr, the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019. It was a method that was created by a bizarre way of thinking.\u201cHup?!\u201d\u201cTh\u2026 The color of the flame\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe transformation was instant. The red flame in the furnace merged with Davey\u2019s mana to become a brilliant blue flame. The temperature hadn\u2019t changed, but it was as if something fundamental had transformed.\u201cHm\u2026 This should be good enough for the temperature.\u201d Davey didn\u2019t care about the dwarves\u2019 shock or confusion. He just silently waited for the furnace\u2019s temperature to rise.Once it reached his desired temperature, Davey immediately stuck in the metal he had prepared and only pulled it out after it had become bright red from the heat. Then, he placed it on the anvil with a practiced gesture and secured it in place using a few clips. He could hold it if it were small enough, but the base of it was quite big.\u201cWhat are you doing? Combining cadmium and mithril into an alloy is forbidden! It\u2019s common knowledge!\u201d\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have let that damn human in!\u201dFeeling stupid for hoping for some kind of miracle, the dwarves expressed their displeasure out loud. However, their great unhappiness went as quickly as it came when they heard Davey speak.\u201cWho said that methods beyond common knowledge can\u2019t be used?\u201d Davey asked.Clang!\u00a0The dwarves went silent as they heard the resonating sound of a hollow echo.\u201cDid your ancestors say that? Or the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019?\u201dClang!\u00a0It was unusually clear for the sound of a dull hammer hitting a piece of hot iron.\u201cAren\u2019t you just binding yourselves to the rules that you have made?\u201dWith every hit from Davey\u2019s hammer, a large ripple seemingly traveled across the piece of metal. The transformation was taking place. As the hammer hit the surface, a blue wave enveloped the metal, then scattered away.There was no such thing as common sense; everything depended on how a technique was utilized. Cadmium and mithril could be combined, depending on the crafting method. One example would be the method that the dwarves called deviant.First, Davey mixed the forbidden reagents when mixing types of metals. He then allowed the reagent to be absorbed by the steady flame fused with mana and twisted the metallic layers. Among the acts that were not to be done during crafting, some new methods existed. It was kind of like a difference in perspective.\u2018Anyway, mithril is a pretty expensive metal\u2026\u2019\u00a0Davey thought that this workshop was quite high class.Clang! Clang!! A blue wave spread out, rippling with each strike of the hammer. The metal began changing.Since it was difficult for ordinary craftsmen to find the layers of iron and strike them, it was quite surprising that Davey was able to find the layers that changed with every strike and hit them with precision.Perhaps the transformation of the shape of the metal was so rapid, or because Davey hadn\u2019t hammered in a long time, but he was engrossed by the task for a long time.When he finally snapped out of his work, he saw that the metal in front of him had roughly become the shape of a large sword. The sword was so sloppy and dull that it would seemingly take a long time to be completed, but its waves of mana were similar to what the dwarves had been desperately trying to hold on to. Actually, the mana seemed much stronger than that, but that was unsurprising since it was made by Davey, Surtr\u2019s student.\u2018Hm, was I too focused?\u2019\u00a0Davey realized that quite a long time had passed, but no one had stopped him. He acknowledged the fact that he was able to be this focused because no one was bothering him.As he lightly tapped the incomplete sword-shaped metal that was on top of the anvil, a faint light shone to reveal its existence. The mana that he had arranged into a pattern were interacting with each other and reacting.Davey gently turned his head before holding up part of his work to the dwarves who were staring at him in shock. Then, he said with a smile, \u201cHow easy is that?\u201d Even he thought what he said was ridiculous.* * *Search bit.ly/3iBfjkV for the original.Ordinary magic swords were made by engraving a magic circle on the completed weapon, then either embedding a mana stone in a regular sword or getting help from a mage. However, instilling a will in a sword required a different process.\u201cH\u2026 How did this\u2026\u201d The dwarves looked extremely shocked, staring at a weapon that completely broke the commonly accepted knowledge. No one ever imagined that Davey would show them something like this. To them, he was a boy who had suddenly visited from the Rowane Kingdom.It was a little misleading to call Davey a boy, since he was an adult by human standards, but he was still a mere child to the dwarves. They didn\u2019t know what his ultimate request was, but he had entered the village by borrowing the king\u2019s authority; however, he didn\u2019t show any of his intentions at first. Of course, the dwarves looked down on him; although there was a promise, Davey was an unwelcome guest who had come without sending word beforehand. On top of that, they were busy with their own troubles.The Eighth Elder Goulda looked out for Davey, since he saw Davey as an amiable human who knew the manners and etiquette of dwarves quite well. However, the other dwarves could care less about him. But now\u2026\u201cH\u2026 How\u2026 Without a mana stone, the sword\u2026\u201d Incapable of completing his sentence, the Sixth Elder Perdom\u2019s gaze shook in disbelief. He probably expressed what the others also felt.A magic sword was powered by an intricately attached mana stone; it produced multiple types of mana from connecting to the stone\u2019s mana. But there was a problem. A sword that used a mana stone for power could only be used for a certain number of times, since it couldn\u2019t continuously produce mana like the Primordial Inferno or the divine sword.As such, the dwarves who had lost most of their ancient skills were unable to do anything; even if it was the same power, a power that replenished itself and one that had a certain number of usages were fundamentally different. It was sort of similar to how a magic stone was much more advanced than a mana stone.To the dwarves, the Primordial Inferno was probably the ultimate symbol of the pure skills of a craftsman. However, a magic artifact without a mana stone, something that they believed couldn\u2019t be crafted anymore, was made in front of their eyes, and it only took a craftsman\u2019s hammer and anvil. The dwarves stared at Davey, the human boy who was hammering as if he had forgotten about his surroundings. As he picked up part of the enormous sword and showed it to the dwarves, their jaws dropped.\u201cSo? Now do you understand?\u201dHow could they understand when something unbelievable was happening right in front of their eyes?* * *-I think I saw mana thinly spread every time you hammered it, but\u2026\u2018Spreading mana can easily be done with the power of a mana stone. I\u2019m talking about the layers.\u2019-Layers?\u2018The sword absorbs mana on its o\u2026 Simply put, it circulates mana through itself.\u2019\u201cElder Golgouda.\u201d\u201cHu\u2026 Huh?!\u201d Startled by Davey, Golgouda ran over toward Davey with his eyes wide open.\u201cCan you tell what I did?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cTh\u2026 That is\u2026\u201dAs Golgouda struggled to explain, Davey grabbed his hammer and lightly tapped the surface of the sword. Clang! Clang!\u00a0The sound was as clear as a bell. It definitely sounded hollow, but the sword was strangely sturdy.\u201cLike the divine sword, there are extremely rare objects that replenish their own power without a mana stone, and they have a nucleus made from metal,\u201d Davey explained.\u201cY\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cMost magic artifacts die when the mana stone runs out of stored mana. So, for something to release a strong power while enduring a long period of time like the Primordial Inferno, it must be able to circulate mana on its own.\u201dA mana arrangement and magic circle could be used to make something circulate mana on its own, but these people were craftsmen, not mages; they didn\u2019t craft objects based on magic.\u201cDo you see these layers?\u201d Davey asked Golgouda.\u201cLayers?\u201d\u201cYes. Whether it be the Primordial Inferno, the divine sword, it absorbs mana, devil mana, or holy power on its own. The exact details might be different, but the point is that the crafted item itself must have the shape of a magic circle.\u201d\u201cB\u2014but then it can\u2019t be a weapon! The shape of a magic circle is\u2026\u201d Golgouda was flustered and tried to explain, but Davey just grinned.\u201cSo, we change the layers of the inside of the metal. We delicately create hundreds of layers and change them to take on the form of a magic circle.\u201dAs far as Davey knew, the only thing that could constantly store and release power like a mana\u2014no\u2014magic stone, was Caldeiras, the divine sword, possessed by Illyna de Pallan, the imperial princess of the Pallan Empire. When he first saw Caldeiras, he couldn\u2019t even dare analyze it because of how advanced it was.\u201cThen\u2026 If you randomly change the layers of the inside, the sword won\u2019t be able to last; it\u2019ll break even at the slightest impact.\u201d Golgouda argued.\u2018Of course, the durability won\u2019t be strong if it\u2019s hollow.\u2019\u201cSo, that\u2019s why the craftsman envelops it in a thin layer of mana using an artifact or his own power and makes a buffer. That is the main point of the mana crafting method.\u201d Davey answered.\u201cBuffer?\u201d-But you were quite aloof when you first saw Caldeiras and me.\u2018A man who maintains their poker face when seeing a pretty girl is much more attractive than one who drools at her.\u2019-For me, it doesn\u2019t matter if they drool or not if they are my type.\u2018What about me?\u2019-You are too much of a stick. How do you feel about bulking up?Davey was pretty muscular; since he ate and worked out a lot during his spare time, he had gained a lot of muscle. As he complained, Perserque giggled.\u201cMost skills disappeared with time. As war changed from life and death between species to war between humans, the skills probably degenerated inevitably.\u201dIt was honestly disrespectful to compare this time to the past when all humans had to unite to match them.\u201cLet me ask you a question: are the dwarves now less skilled than the ones before?\u201d Davey asked Golgouda.\u201cThat is\u2026 Sigh, yes. Our skills are nothing compared to our ancestors.\u201d\u201cIs it impossible by your nature?\u201d\u201cDefinitely not!!\u201d Davey glanced over at the other dwarves as Golgouda shouted loudly. Their hostility was long gone, and their eyes were filled with vitality. It was like they had discovered something new, some newfound hope.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its state is exactly like before, right when the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019 first handed it over to the dwarves. The rest is up to you,\u201d Davey said.\u201cBut\u2026 We can\u2019t even work on the finishing touches with our current level of skill,\u201d Golgouda replied.\u201cThen, you have to learn.\u201d Davey smiled.Golgouda had an eager expression on his face. \u201cC\u2026 Can you teach us those skills?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to do that for a trade. You\u2019re okay with that, right?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cOf course! I would sell my soul to the devil if I could catch up to our ancestors\u2019 skills!\u201d\u201cT\u2026 Teach me! I will do anything you say!\u201d\u201cTeach me! N\u2014No, please teach me, wise teacher!\u201dThe other dwarves were eager to learn as well.\u2018Man, look at the change in attitude.\u2019\u201cAlright. Then\u2026\u201dNo one regarded Davey as a mere greenhorn prince anymore, since the dwarves had seen what he could do with their very own eyes. They\u2019d probably still struggle to believe it without first-hand experience, because it was hard to believe that a young human who was barely an adult was an expert blacksmith.The dwarves stared at Davey nervously as he was thinking.\u201cThen, we\u2019ll start after we finish my work.\u201dThe dwarves felt relieved, their knees almost buckling.Davey felt bad, but he had his own priorities. He did come here to ask for the dwarves\u2019 help with repairing the territory\u2019s facilities, but there was still something with far more importance than that.\u201cYour work?\u201d\u201cActually, I have come to this village to borrow the Great Furnace.\u201d\u201cThe Great Furnace?\u201d\u201cI have to finish these weapons because I was kind of asked to do so.\u201d Davey pulled out two cloth-wrapped weapons from his backpack.\u201cIs that a sword?\u201dAs Davey unwrapped the objects, the dwarves\u2019 eyes sparkled; they had instinctively felt that the weapons weren\u2019t finished.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe dwarves were known to be the craftsmen of the century, despite being less skilled than their ancestors. Looking at the incomplete swords, they widened their eyes in shock and surprise. They looked on as Davey unwrapped the two dull swords and pulled them out.***-Why does everyone give you such a look whenever you show them something? One day, I think you\u2019re going to get arrested for blasphemy.It was really starting to seem like a bad omen, but Davey wasn\u2019t afraid. \u2018Do you think I\u2019d be afraid of God\u2019s punishment, especially when I have a stigmata?\u2019-Tsk tsk.\u00a0The real punishment doesn\u2019t come from God, but people.The dwarves stared at Davey because of the amazing talent he had shown, but they were now only staring at the two incomplete swords in his hands. The two swords were too long to be daggers and too short to be called longswords; they weren\u2019t designed like the common swords in this continent. Still, the craftsmen had already recognized what they were.\u201cH\u2026 Hey\u2026 W\u2014What is that sword?!\u201d Out of all the surprised dwarves, it was none other than First Elder Golgouda, the best craftsman in the Yellowstone Tribe, who asked Davey.\u201cHow does it look?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cAre you kidding? What is\u2026 No way, did you make this?!\u201d\u201cHm, I didn\u2019t make it, but I will be the one finishing it.\u201dIt was just a fact of the matter. Even if he had the materials, Davey wasn\u2019t skilled enough to make something like this; after all, these twin swords had been made by Surtr, the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019, near the end of his life.\u201cT\u2026Then, the craftsman who made this sword\u2026\u201d Golgouda asked.\u201cHe died. A long time ago.\u201d\u201cAhem! I\u2014I apologize.\u201d Perhaps Golgouda jumped to conclusions, but he nodded with a bitter expression and backed away after listening to Davey\u2019s reply.Davey had no need to feel guilty, since it was true that Surtr was dead. He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, seeing an old dwarf get flustered after thinking he had hit a nerve. Davey said, \u201cHe\u2019s been dead a long time. It\u2019s already been thousands of years.\u201dPerhaps Golgouda understood what Davey was implying. He widened his eyes. \u201cThousands of years ago? N\u2014No way, are you\u2026!\u201dThe problem was that the sword\u2019s potential exceeded its initial design due to the long period of aging from abandonment.-Aging? It\u2019s not even alcohol.\u2018All things created with the mana crafting method need a certain time to age. The Primordial Inferno\u2026 No, the sword that will be newly crafted needs a few months to settle down before it can be worked on again. And it\u2019ll have to be meticulously maintained during that time.\u2019-Is that so?\u2018Well, there is a clear difference in the difficulty of maintenance and crafting.\u2019Wondering about how he should finish the swords, Davey squinted and slid his fingers down the side of the blade. To be honest, he needed some time to think about it, because the swords had a lot more potential than he had expected. Even if the swords only retained 10% of their original condition, he couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous about working on something so great. He didn\u2019t have a lot of time to work on them, so the swords\u2019 quality would ultimately depend on how much effort and skill he could put into them in a short amount of time.\u201cH\u2014Hey! Do you have the materials to finish them?\u201d Golgouda asked.\u201cHm? No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m planning to use an alloy with mithril, so I was going to borrow some from here.\u201d Davey didn\u2019t expect to be given any exquisite materials, but since this was a dwarf village, he would probably be able to get some high-quality mithril. He wanted something like orichalcum or adamantium to finish the swords off, but it was difficult to obtain something that luxurious.However, that problem was solved unexpectedly.\u2018How lucky.\u2019\u201cW\u2014Wait! I\u2019ll lend you my workshop! Although I am not very skilled as compared to you, I have maintained it meticulously! There are plenty of tools for you to use your full abilities!\u201d Golgouda offered.\u201cHm?\u201d Davey was puzzled, since a personal workshop was a sacred space to a craftsman.Golgouda shouted passionately, \u201cAnd I have something that you can use for the finishing material!\u201d Golgouda wasn\u2019t cooperating just because Davey was going to teach him; his eyes were filled with the desire to see the finished work of Surtr, the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019. The Primordial Inferno didn\u2019t seem to concern him any longer.\u2018Excuse me. Out of everyone, you shouldn\u2019t be the one to act like that.\u2019The dwarves stared at Davey, curious as to what he was going to show next. They were almost like dogs excitedly wagging their tails.\u201cIf it\u2019s you\u2026 You might be able to make a sword that matches up to the divine sword! Just wait!\u201dThe dwarves stared at Golgouda in shock as he ran off somewhere as fast as he could.\u201cNo way, Grandpops Golgouda!\u201d\u201cIs he going to bring that out?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s crazy! He\u2019s going to bring the thing that he even hid away from the elders?!\u201dDavey looked puzzled as he heard the dwarves shout in shock. \u2018How great is it that they are making that big of a fuss over it?\u2019Davey\u2019s question was answered as soon as Golgouda ran over and handed him a small object. He could feel the mana, which was intensely unique and different from the usual kind.\u201cWhat\u2026is this?\u201d Feeling the unfamiliar kind of mana, Davey squinted and unwrapped the cloth to see something white. Although it was for a mere second, he realized what the object was almost instinctively.-Bones?\u2018What the hell.\u2019\u201cThese are the bones of a dragon that my ancestors have left me. It seems that it has absorbed mana for quite some time.\u201dDavey was dumbfounded at the unexpected finishing material he had received. It had been a long time since he was this shocked.\u201cYes, it is my family\u2019s treasure that has been passed down from generation to generation. I have looked after it because there wasn\u2019t anyone who could use it, but\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Golgouda looked at Davey with twinkling eyes. He knew the dragon bones were absolutely perfect for the incomplete swords, which had been circulating mana and aging for thousands of years.\u201cWow.\u201d Davey was truly astonished. He wasn\u2019t as good a craftsman as Surtr, but that didn\u2019t mean that Davey couldn\u2019t do what Surtr had been able to do; it was common for the student to outperform the master in the craftsman\u2019s path. He felt that this could very well create an extremely great weapon.***\u201cAhem! W\u2014Wise teacher! Let\u2019s have a talk!\u201d One of the dwarf elders, who was awkwardly glancing around, approached Davey hesitantly. \u201cUh\u2026 Hm. I understand that Grandpops Golgouda has helped you with a lot of things\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I am honored to have received many gifts from him.\u201d\u201cRight. Don\u2019t you think that he would feel a little uncomfortable if you were to use his workshop when you already got the finest material out there? So\u2026why don\u2019t you use my\u2026\u201d\u201cY\u2014You grandpa!\u201d Golgouda shouted.\u201cShriek!\u201d\u201cGet lost! I already called dibs on him!\u201d\u201cHmph! How could you take all the honor for yourself?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This is tyranny!\u201d\u201cOur workshops can match up to yours! This is up to the wise teacher to decide!\u201d\u201cW\u2014What?!\u201d Golgouda shouted.The atmosphere got riled up in seconds, and the dwarves looked like they could start a fight at any minute. Dwarves were known to be hot-tempered, so they would really end up in a fistfight if Davey just left them to keep bickering. It seemed like progress wouldn\u2019t be made unless he put a stop to these dwarves, who were fiercely arguing as if they had a death wish.\u201cNow, now. Everyone stop,\u201d Davey said.\u201cAhem!\u201d\u201cSince Elder Golgouda offered his place first, it would be right to use it.\u201d\u201cAhem! If you say so\u2026\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you need, don\u2019t hesitate to ask! I will get it to you!\u201d\u201cAh! It\u2019s a very small amount, but I have orichalcum!\u201d\u201cWhat! You grandpa?! T\u2014Then, I will use my family treasure, too! I will give you the 100-year-old Torcilim reagent!\u201d Sixth Elder Perdom shouted as if he was in a large auction.\u201cHmph! 100 grams of adamantium! It is our family treasure! I could boast about it for decades if it were to be used in the last work of the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019!\u201d\u201cLook at this guy! You think that\u2019s important?! It\u2019s the family treasure! Family treasure!\u201d\u201cHey, you grandpa! It\u2019s better to invest it and raise the prestige of our family, rather than letting it rot somewhere! And is that the reagent in your hand? You always threw your hammer at me whenever I asked to see it!\u201d Seventh Elder Ranselle shouted, not backing down.The elders kept yelling. It became a competition of who could offer the best thing; now, everyone hopped on the bandwagon and began shouting, presenting Davey with what they had. Individually, the materials offered weren\u2019t as notable as the ancient dragon bones that Golgouda had offered, but they all added up into a significant haul.\u2018Wow.\u2019\u00a0Davey couldn\u2019t help but let out a gasp of astonishment as the dwarves went on. Even if they were dwarves, it was still difficult for them to accumulate fine materials. Extremely rare metals such as orichalcum or adamantium were very valuable; few craftsmen could even see these materials in their entire lifetime. Only tiny amounts could be found at once, so it only became a sizable amount over the accumulation of generations. It was truly something that deserved the title of a family treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could you give up your family treasure that easily?\u201d Davey spoke to the dwarves.\u201cIt\u2019s fine! We can\u2019t use it anyways! I think our ancestors would be happy if you used it in the last work of the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith\u2019, wise teacher!!\u201dDavey was afraid that the dwarves\u2019 ancestors would really feel that way. The ancestors were also dwarves, after all. \u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Davey let out a deep sigh and looked at all the materials laid out in front of him.-You don\u2019t have enough?\u2018All these materials are also going to disappear, too.\u2019\u00a0Davey thought as he looked at the orichalcum, adamantium, and various aged reagents. Not only that, but there were also the dragon bones that were going to be the finishing material.\u2018I think I\u2019m going to have to tweak my design a little.\u2019\u00a0Davey was going to use what he was given; he decided to look at the bright side.* * *\u201cI will issue my authority as the highest-ranking elder! I cannot give up anymore!\u201d Golgouda shouted.\u201cYou cheap grandpa!\u201d\u201cHmph! Tsk tsk!\u201dAt last, the dwarves\u2019 fight about whose workshop Davey was going to use came to an end with Golgouda\u2019s dirty trick. It could be seen as a cheap trick, but it could also be seen as realistic and practical.\u201cH\u2014How do you like it? Wise teacher! Is it just right?\u201d Golgouda asked.\u201cHaha\u2026 It\u2019s very nice!\u201d Davey was truly in awe when he saw Golgouda\u2019s workshop. The old dwarf wasn\u2019t called the best craftsman in the tribe for nothing; the workshop was neat and tidy, and had a furnace directly connected to the Great Furnace, along with various tools and anvils.\u201cAhem! As much as I want to assist you on the final work\u2026\u201d Golgouda\u2019s voice trailed off. He glanced at the two swords on the anvil with a strong yearning in his eyes, but soon shook his head as if he had decided. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, since there are rules I must keep as a craftsman. Like you said, we will think about it while you work.\u201dDavey watched Golgouda, who walked away after speaking gallantly, and mumbled quietly, \u201cHm\u2026 He could\u2019ve watched if he wanted.\u201d-What are you going to do if someone steals your techniques?\u201cThey won\u2019t know how to do it even if they watch.\u201d Davey wasn\u2019t exactly wrong to say so. He then added, \u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s get started.\u201dDavey stared at the furnace that was burning with a bright blue flame, then immediately pushed the two swords in. He spread his hands and closed his eyes. Whoosh!!!\u00a0Blue energy began escaping from his body, creating a giant magic circle in the air.\u2018If you don\u2019t have something, improvise with the next best thing. There\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat.\u2019\u00a0Davey wasn\u2019t enlightened enough to be a craftsman as outstanding as Surtr, but he was getting there in his own way. Even though Davey had trained for about a thousand years, he still couldn\u2019t catch up to the accomplishments that one human had achieved in a lifetime; Surtr wasn\u2019t called monstrously talented for nothing.\u2018Now that I think about it this way, maybe I wasn\u2019t really that gifted,\u2019 Davey thought, but he soon shook the thought off. He believed that the things he lacked in comparison to Surtr could be improved by doing something else.He took the shiny swords that were surrounded in a blue flame out of the furnace. Then, he grabbed his hammer and took a deep breath.* * *The workshop was quiet aside from the constant sound of hammering. Davey felt like it had been so long since he had used his abilities to make something. Clang!! Clash!! Every time he hit the burning sword, a blue flame rose up and disappeared.The swords were almost finished, but Davey heated them up in the furnace and hammered them again. If the only available material for the finishing touch was mithril, he was going to just plate a few parts and be done with it. However, his plans all changed because of the family treasures like orichalcum, adamantium, and the dragon bones the dwarves had brought him.Living things were eventually bound to break and decay over time. However, dragon bones were different; the bones of dragons were the only mana-infused remains of an enormous being. As such, the bones only got stronger with time. It wouldn\u2019t even decay over ten thousand years if there was a sufficient source of mana.Davey knew that the ancient dragon bones were valuable and rare, but he didn\u2019t expect any to be left in the continent. He squinted at the dragon bones that were placed separately from the other materials. \u2018I know how to work with it.\u2019 He smiled as he remembered something from his time at the Hall of Heroes.[Eh! You puny girl! Give it!][Who are you calling a flat-chested puny girl, you jackass?!][What\u2019s with you, girl? I didn\u2019t say you are flat-chested!][Shut up! I\u2019m going to burn Davey alive!][What\u2019s wrong with you, bitch?! Why are you trying to burn a perfectly normal boy?]Davey didn\u2019t know why he had been punished when Surtr had been the one who teased her\u2026The Hall of Heroes, the gathering place for the heroes\u2019 souls, was created by the heroes\u2019 minds. It was very similar to paradise in a way; it seemed to be like a reward for the heroes who had worked so hard in their lives. Thanks to that, Surtr had once given Davey dragon bones by borrowing the power of Odin, the God of Mages. Of course, an appropriate amount of effort was needed to create something very high-quality. Since Surtr couldn\u2019t just whip up something like dragon bones, he had pushed and nagged Odin who had experience in materializing a small amount of dragon bones. Davey could still see the image of the little mage sobbing as she handed Surtr the bones.[That\u2019s it. That\u2019s one of the main materials of the divine sword. It\u2019s difficult to obtain, but you should know how to use it if you ever encountered it, right?]At that time, Davey was annoyed at how Surtr had been making him use an ancient relic that he didn\u2019t think really existed. But that turned out to be a blessing in disguise.Davey became lost in his blacksmithing as he started to concentrate, and nothing could bother him. Every one of his brain cells was focused on polishing the two swords, and he hammered away and forgot that time even existed.The swords\u2019 natural color deepened with every hit of Davey\u2019s hammer. As the blue flame scattered away, the blue and red sheen of the swords intensified and brightened.Clang!! Clang!!\u00a0The sound was much louder and clearer than the sound of hitting regular metal. It resonated through the workshop, but Davey didn\u2019t plug his ears; he took in the entire sound and sped up the process.-It\u2019s beautiful\u2026Even Perserque was infatuated with the shine of the swords. She quietly watched Davey as he worked.At last, the dark maroon-colored sword absorbed light and transformed into a clear ruby color. The blue sword transformed into a mystical sapphire color that looked like a supernova in the night sky.And finally, Davey finished building the grip and pommel of the swords, which shone on their own, and began sanding the blades on a sharpening stone. It would have been nice if these swords were the common ones that could be sharpened using a machine, but because of their quality and material, they couldn\u2019t be affected by regular stones.Thankfully, Davey was able to sharpen and envelop the swords in mana since he had the sharpening stone, another family treasure, that one of the dwarves had given him.Whoosh\u2026 Whoosh!! The two swords vibrated while intensely releasing mana like a newborn baby crying from its birth into the world.Davey wiped off the sweat from his forehead. The workshop was like a sauna from the heat of the endlessly burning furnace, but he didn\u2019t cast any fire resistance spells and simply endured the heat. This was a risky job that would fail if the temperature was even a little off.Whoosh\u2026 Whoosh!! Running his fingers down the shining red and blue swords, Davey felt that the dull, rough texture had been replaced with smoothness.\u201cI should give you a name now.\u201d Davey already had names in mind, ever since laying eyes on them for the first time. \u201cYou guys are now Blue Ribbon and Red Ribbon!\u201dWhoosh!!!!\u00a0The swords vibrated like crazy, as if aware of their own existence. It would take time for their ego to awaken, but this was a sign that they had instinctively accepted the name.-Those are awful names\u2026Davey could hear Perserque\u2019s tired comment coming from behind him, but he was eager to examine the status of the swords first. \u2018[Check Information].\u2019 Since he didn\u2019t have a reason to wait, Davey reached out toward the swords. He didn\u2019t hide his excitement and used Perserque\u2019s authority.Bleep!!-Name: Red Ribbon.-Status: Finishing up.-Shape: A wide, two-bladed Ring Pommel Sword.-Length: 88 centimeters.-Width: 6 centimeters.-Contractor: Davey O\u2019Rowane.-Completion Level: 99.9%.-Details: The first sword of the final work created by the great blacksmith, who had used mana in his crafts, by pouring out all his strength before passing; sword repaired and completed by the student of the great blacksmith to execute his teacher\u2019s final wishes; stats are out of this world; not at 100% completion level because the ego has not woken up; large amounts of elemental and devil mana circulating; has the absolute authority to cut the living; cuts and ignores all physical attacks on the sword; all abilities amplified when held together with twin sword.Bleep!-Name: Blue Ribbon.-Status: Finishing up.-Shape: A wide, two-bladed Ring Pommel Sword.-Length: 88 centimeters.-Width: 6 centimeters.-Contractor: Davey O\u2019Rowane.-Completion Level: 99.9%.-Details: Second sword with stats that are out of this world; second of the twin swords; large amounts of the power of the spirits and holy power circulating; has the authority to cut the dead; cuts everything that does not exist in the physical world; destroys authority of immortality; lethal to demon-type beings; all abilities amplified when held together with the first sword.\u201c\u2026\u201d Without a word, Davey raised the Red Ribbon and lightly slashed down on a mithril anvil. The swing was light and had no mana on it. However\u2026\u2018Slash it.\u2019This novel is available on bit.ly/3iBfjkV.Shwing! As soon as Davey wished for it to be cut, the mithril anvil was divided into two without the slightest resistance. The greatest dwarf-made anvil that didn\u2019t even dent when struck multiple times with the Aura Blade had been cut into two by a single swing.\u201c\u2026\u201d-\u2026There was a moment of silence. Then, Davey picked up the Blue Ribbon and slashed the air. Crack!\u00a0He heard the sound of something being sliced in the air.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d-What kind of sword cuts mana with a swing?!The Blue Ribbon wasn\u2019t able to cut the anvil as easily as the Red Ribbon, but the mana floating in the path of the Blue Ribbon had stopped flowing and disappeared. It was the sword\u2019s authority to cut things that didn\u2019t exist in the physical world, and since mana was an energy that was part of the law of anti-physics, it had been slashed apart. It seemed like Davey had created something insane.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fearless Vampires.\u2018How long was I here for?\u2019 Davey wondered. It didn\u2019t feel like a long time, but he wasn\u2019t sure. He often lost track of time and worked for days when he was very focused.-It has finally come to an end.\u201cThanks for waiting.\u201d-No, it\u2019s fine. It was quite fascinating, so it was worth it, I guess.Davey tilted his head in confusion as Perserque giggled. He asked, \u201cFascinating?\u201d-Well, it\u2019s nothing!\u201cAh, what is it? Tell me.\u201d Feeling anxious, Davey scolded Perserque, but she just stuck her tongue out and scattered away. He felt goosebumps coming along as it seemed like she was never going to tell him, but he shook that thought off. Nothing would change even if he kept thinking about it.Creak! Thud!! Davey slowly opened the workshop\u2019s heavy doors to see a few of the young dwarves dozing off while standing in front of the workshop. They were obviously craftsmen, but it seemed that they stood guard here to keep the place quiet while he worked.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Davey initially thought that maybe he should leave them be, but he immediately woke them.\u201cSnore\u2026 Drool\u2026 Huh?\u201d The dwarf woke up as soon as Davey shook him. He opened his eyes in a daze, but quickly widened his eyes to stare right at Davey. He shouted, \u201cHuk!!\u201d\u201cDid you see a ghost or something?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cT\u2014Teacher! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cWell, there isn\u2019t anything to be sorry about. What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026 Hey you! Stop sleeping and wake up!\u201d Feeling flustered, the dwarf who was talking to Davey beat the other snoozing dwarf to wake him up.\u201cHup! Teacher! Have you finished?\u201d The other dwarf asked.\u201cWe were guarding this place in case anyone tried to disturb you!\u201d The first dwarf explained.\u201cHow long was I in there?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cAbout four days\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d\u201cFour days?\u201d\u201cYes, we were worried since you wouldn\u2019t come out to eat even if we knocked\u2026 Ah! I will go and send word to the elders.\u201dAs the dwarves quickly ran off, Davey stood still and stared into space. He had worked through the night before, but he couldn\u2019t believe that he had just hammered for four days straight without eating or sleeping.-Your determination was similar to that of a madman\u2026Davey felt strangely nervous, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask Perserque for more details. For four days, or 96 hours, he had focused on his work with no food or sleep. He had survived on just water. If he had stayed a little longer, he probably would\u2019ve collapsed from working too hard. Now that he realized that, he strangely felt more tired than before.-You should get some sleep.\u201cI\u2019m still good,\u201d Davey said, but he was pretty tired from pouring all of his energy out for an extended period of time.\u201cWow! Wise teacher!\u201d\u201cYou are back!\u201dThe elders had been discussing matters, but dropped everything to come running to Davey. They were like little children running toward a snack.\u201cDid you make progress?\u201d Davey asked the elders.\u201cYes! We made some progress because of the hints you left us!\u201d Like a child, Elder Golgouda proudly showed Davey a large object. It definitely needed some improvements, but it had the potential to become pretty good if some parts were fixed.\u201cS\u2026. So, teacher. Is it finished?\u201d One of the old dwarf elders asked with caution. No one stopped him from asking; perhaps the others were curious, too.\u201cAh, this. It turned out way better than I imagined.\u201d Davey put down the two cloth bundles that were in his armsThe dwarves gasped.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cThis is the final product of the last work of the \u2018Thousand-Day Blacksmith\u2019!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s finally done!\u201dBefore, they looked worn out from studying how to create a new sacred object. But now, they looked completely rejuvenated.\u201cT\u2014Teacher! Please show us!\u201d\u201cAh, man\u2026\u201dAs Davey unwrapped the cloth and the dwarves gasped in surprise, the two swords, which didn\u2019t even have a sheath yet, emitted a faint light and boasted their presence.\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way! A sword shining on its own\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this the armory created by a true craftsman?\u201dThe dwarves were on their knees while they let out astonished gasps. It was as if they were praying to a God. Among them, some had tears in their eyes, as if a devoted person had encountered God.\u201cTo see a work as great as this\u2026 For something this great to be created with the material I offered! I have no regrets!\u201d\u201cMe neither!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 Look at that beautiful figure!\u201dWell, the swords were extraordinary. They were rare and unique, so knights would most likely gladly die for them. The dwarves instinctively noticed the strange power within the swords and wanted to ask Davey about it, but he didn\u2019t give them a chance to.\u201cI think I need to get some rest. I am human, after all.\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I apologize.\u201dStill, the dwarves couldn\u2019t easily let go of their desires to examine the swords in detail.* * *Davey was completely knocked out after his four days of endless work. He only woke up after one entire day had passed, even though he was strong enough to not feel tired very easily. Perhaps because he had put all his strength and energy into making the swords, he had fallen into an incredibly deep sleep.But after a proper rest, Davey felt super refreshed. He woke up and spent his time relaxing and sharing his wisdom with the dwarves who were racking their brains trying to make a new sacred item.\u201cW\u2014Wise teacher! Wouldn\u2019t the sturdiness be significantly decreased?\u201d\u201cAh, you have to alter the temperature of the flame. You need to adjust the temperature as you work with the tougher metals that also have more mana-affinity than mithril. That way, you won\u2019t risk breaking it.\u201d\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd Elder Romdhi, don\u2019t try to force layers just by hammering. You have to do it naturally.\u201d\u201cL\u2014Like this?\u201d\u201cA little lighter.\u201d\u201cAh! Okay! Thank you, Wise teacher! Wahaha!\u201dThey were dwarves skilled enough to be the leaders of a dwarf village. Even though there were some that could not be elders, everyone here was craftsman with highly acknowledged skills. They were all proud of that fact.Find the original at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.Only the most extraordinary craftsmen could become elders, but if someone other than dwarves saw them right now, they looked more like newbies who were beginning to learn blacksmithing. They were just much more passionate.These dwarves had let go of their pride and were now purely filled with passion. They yearned to learn more; it was as if they had gone back to the time they first held their hammer. And so, teaching them was also quite an interesting and rewarding job.Dwarves were as stubborn as bulls, but they always repaid their debts. For better or for worse. To them, they owed Davey a huge debt of gratitude. And the more they were indebted to him, the more he could gain from them; it wasn\u2019t a bad trade.-That\u2019s not how you really feel.\u2018I have an excuse to relax and enjoy my life. How nice is that?\u2019-You are quite easygoing.\u2018You have to rest when you have the chance. After all, we\u2019re all doing this to live comfortably, right?\u2019-I wish I had a body.Strangely, Davey felt that Perserque would lay around all day and sip juice if she was given a physical body.As for the situation in the Heins territory, Davey had nothing to worry about since he was getting daily reports from Royal Attendant Bernile through the communication crystal. Since the territory needed another month to really get up and going, all he could do was idly stare at the sky even if he was at the territory right now.Thanks to the techniques Davey was teaching them, the dwarves were successfully crafting their second sacred item. Everything was going according to plan, so the enormous sword that was the main component of the sacred item began showing its greatness.The dwarves made everything other than the nucleus and the skeletal structure with their own skills and techniques, so they were extremely proud and delighted. The sacred item might just be a trivial tool to Davey, but it was a new spiritual anchor to the dwarves. They were probably overjoyed at the fact that they were able to recreate the sacred item with their own hands.There was a high rock cliff that overlooked the entire area from just outside the village. This was where the elders of the Yellowstone Tribe, which was surrounded by rocky terrain, came to grab firewood. It was also a nice place to enjoy the view, perfect for relaxing with a hammock or something.\u201cThank you, wise teacher. We dwarves are known to be hot-tempered, but we always repay our debt. We are forever indebted to you.\u201dAs Davey was enjoying the view while munching on a coconut-like fruit, someone approached him and handed him a unique-looking ceramic. It was Golgouda, the highest elder in the Yellowstone Tribe. He greeted the dwarf, \u201cOh, Elder Golgouda.\u201d\u201cThis is, um\u2026 This is a liquor that my brother really cherishes. I heard that you like to drink.\u201dQuite a long time had passed with Davey sharing his wisdom with the dwarves after he had finished the Blue Ribbon and Red Ribbon. In the meantime, he taught them new skills during the day and had drinks with them at night. The dwarves were very friendly to Davey, a human who knew the etiquette of dwarves and the person who gave them a glimmer of hope. Of course, they probably liked him more because he won the Eighth Elder Goulda, the best drinker in the tribe, in a drinking competition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I like the aroma. It\u2019s not too strong, either,\u201d Davey commented.Golgouda nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. Not all dwarves like strong liquor. Actually, I have something I want to talk to you about too.\u201d\u201cSomething else?\u201d\u2018Is he going to come at me\u00a0for\u00a0cutting\u00a0his\u00a0mithril\u00a0anvil?\u2019\u00a0Davey began to think of an excuse. As a joke, he thought that maybe he should hand over one of the twin swords as collateral.Whoosh!\u00a0Of course, Davey had to think of something else. The two swords, which didn\u2019t even have conscious egos yet, vibrated in strong opposition to his idea.\u201cThe truth is\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry about the anvil. At a later time, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dSearch tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w for the original.\u201cHm? What are you talking about?\u201dAs Golgouda looked at him with a puzzled expression, Davey quickly shut his mouth. \u201cNothing. Anyway, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAhem! I may be old, but my ears are still fine. Other than finishing the last work of the \u2018Thousand-day Blacksmith,\u2019 I did hear that you wanted to bring us dwarves over to repair the facilities in your territory,\u201d Golgouda said.\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Davey had intended to bring the matter up later, but things were now made easier with Golgouda mentioning it first.\u201cWe dwarves never forget a favor. Although our skills are nothing compared to yours, we will help you with anything.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? It might take a long time.\u201d\u201cWe have received a huge favor from you, wise teacher. We are no longer going to be remembered as incompetent ancestors to the next generation, and we have also regained our pride. Also, you have allowed us to discover the skills our ancestors had studied,\u201d Golgouda said.Davey said nothing. The sacred item held a lot more significance than he had expected.\u201cI didn\u2019t even say a proper thank you. You set us on the right path when we were caught up in our stubborn ways, tainting the name of the dwarves.\u201d Golgouda spoke calmly and chuckled, as if he was a grandpa talking to his grandson. It was an honest and friendly smile that came from the heart. He then made a pledge. \u201cAlthough we are lacking, we will follow you, teacher. We swear on the God of Iron that we will always stand with you when you have any problems. The Yellowstone Tribe will always follow you, even if all the other tribe villages are hostile.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWe should be the ones thanking you.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a hint of regret in Golgouda\u2019s smile.\u201cThen, please become my territory\u2019s residents,\u201d Davey offered.\u201cResidents?\u201d\u201cI want to make the Heins Territory, which I am managing, into a unique territory.\u201dCurrently, there were many species living in the continent, but each had their own exclusive region. There wasn\u2019t any place where various species lived in harmony.\u201cSo, can I assume that you are asking us to consider leaving this place and moving there?\u201d Golgouda asked.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not right away. And to be exact, I am not requesting the dwarves of the Yellowstone Tribe to move.\u201dGolgouda tilted his head in confusion. \u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI will tell you the details later. All I need right now is your cooperation.\u201dGolgouda looked puzzled, trying to figure out Davey\u2019s intentions. But he soon shook away that thought. He opened his mouth to say something when\u2026\u201cElder!! Elder Golgouda!!\u201d Someone hurriedly ran toward them and called for Gologuda.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Golgouda\u2019s smile vanished from his face. He asked in a solemn tone, because the approaching dwarf was one of the attack dwarves guarding the village.\u201cThere\u2019s a big problem! I think an intruder has hidden in our village!\u201d\u201cIntruder?\u201d Golgouda frowned.Whip!! Crash!!\u00a0A sharp red object flew toward the two dwarves when Golgouda had just heard the news. Davey got off his hammock and swung his arms. The object that bounced off his arm was a red knife, but it wasn\u2019t made out of metal. It was made out of blood.* * *\u201cAhhhhh!! Goddamn Davey!!\u201d The scream was one of insanity. The ladies-in-waiting turned pale as the boy had completely lost his cool and was flipping out. He just kept screaming without any thought; he was too angry to think straight.\u201cDavey!!! Davey!!!\u201d As he was breaking, kicking, and destroying everything around him while screaming Davey\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t seem to be in good shape. First of all, not a strand of hair could be seen on the top of his head; it was as if he had shaved only the crown of his head for some kind of surgery. It was what people called a large bald patch!What enraged the boy more was that he wasn\u2019t even completely bald. He just had a patch of baldness about the size of a palm at the very top of his head. However, Davey\u2019s curse didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cYo\u2026 Your Highness\u2026 Please calm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?! Ribbit!!\u201d There was a strange animal sound that he kept blurting out at the end of his sentences. It didn\u2019t happen all the time, only emerging when he had something to say during important moments. It also occurred regardless of his intentions; it was as if it waited for the perfect timing.Because the animal sounds happened just some of the time, it looked like Carlus was joking around. It was so bewildering that even Queen Lynesse, his biological mother, couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him. Since it wasn\u2019t a disease, the examination of Ramdas, the palace doctor, yielded no answers either. The only people who could recognize some mischief were the priests.However, the curse plaguing Carlus was made by the dark mages who were constantly oppressed and persecuted, meaning that the traces of the curse couldn\u2019t be easily found even if the low-ranking priests examined him. As wild and destructive as dark magic was, it was developed in secret. And so, the details about Carlus\u2019 symptoms, which were similar to madness, were hard to find.However, Carlus was fully aware that his weird symptoms started to happen after he had encountered Davey, the First Prince of this kingdom and the idiot that he thought to be inferior to him.\u201cGahh!!!!\u201d\u201cPlease calm down, Your Highness!\u201dOf course, others assumed that Carlus had gone mad and was oddly obsessing over Davey.\u201cCacaw!! Cock-a-doodle-doo!!\u201d\u00a0Carlus frowned in extreme anger and confusion. He was hiding it as best as he could, but news about his hair was already spreading. The rumor turned even more strange because of his weird animal cries. He was flipping out since he wasn\u2019t used to things not going his way.\u201cGiggle!\u201d Then, one of the ladies-in-waiting could no longer hold in her laughter. She giggled at Carlus\u2019 strange voice. She instinctively covered her mouth, but he had already heard her. She cried out, \u201cY\u2014Your Highness!\u201d\u201cYes, you are all mocking me too! How dare you lowly beings!!!\u201d Carlus lost his cool and was blinded by anger. Trembling in fear, the lady-in-waiting collapsed onto the floor from Carlus\u2019 menacing attitude. However, he simply walked over to her and strangled her without hesitation. \u201cHow dare you insult me?! Die!! Die!!!\u201d\u201cGasp!! Wheeze!\u201d The lady-in-waiting flailed around, but a little girl couldn\u2019t beat the strength of Carlus, who had insisted on getting swordsmanship training. Watching her go limp after flailing around and even pissing on the floor, the other ladies-in-waiting went pale. It was an insane situation, but no one could say anything; there was no one who could stop Carlus.\u201cYou\u2026 Are you guys mocking me too?!\u201d Carlus shouted.\u201cN\u2014No, Your Highness!\u201d\u201cPlease have mercy!\u201dAs his anger shifted toward the other ladies-in-waiting, they simultaneously began trembling and got on the floor to beg for forgiveness. If they didn\u2019t do so, they were convinced that they would die just like the first girl did.\u201cNo\u2026 No! You are mocking me as well, right? Ehehehe\u2026 Ribbit ribbit!\u201d Laughing strangely, Carlus\u2019 eyes shone with malice, and it looked like he was going to kill everyone here immediately. The ladies-in-waiting had to calm him down somehow, but they couldn\u2019t say a word as they trembled in fear.That was when a relaxed and easygoing voice was heard. \u201cHm, I haven\u2019t seen anything this interesting in a while.\u201dCarlus, who was walking toward the ladies-in-waiting, opened his eyes wide and turned toward the voice. Then, he stopped for a second as someone entered the room through a window that had opened on its own. He was surprised that someone had broken in, but that wasn\u2019t his concern.\u201cKyakk!\u201d\u201cShriek!\u201dThe intruder was holding onto a human head. It was still bleeding, as if it had been freshly ripped off of someone. The ladies-in-waiting fainted, foaming at the mouth, as they watched the horrendous situation.But Carlus, who had lost his mind, growled at the intruder with a threatening scowl. \u201cWho are you? Do you have any idea where this is?!\u201d\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t introduced myself yet. My name is Pace.\u201d The man with icy blond hair and eerily red eyes had a cunning handsomeness. However, his extremely pale skin made Carlus question if he was really human. Unphased by the situation, Pace calmly greeted Carlus with a sly smile. \u201cActually, I heard that you were disappointed by one of our people.\u201d\u201cYour people?\u201dPace smiled eerily and snapped his fingers. Whoosh\u2026\u00a0A space opened up near him and someone was pulled out from it. It was a battered-up woman hanging on a cross; she was in a shape so bad that it was difficult to tell whether she was alive or not. However, Carlus was familiar with the woman.\u201cYou\u2019re Mother\u2019s\u2026\u201dIt was Shari, the quiet lady-in-waiting who used to be under Queen Lynesse. Carlus thought that she had disappeared at some point. \u201cYou\u2026 What are you? Growl\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It truly was a curse. Listening to his weird sounds, Pace laughed his head off and lightly flicked his hand. He chuckled, \u201cKekeke. Someone played a funny trick on you.\u201dPaching! As soon as Pace spoke, something shattered from within Carlus\u2019 body.\u201cI can easily break that. Consider this on the house.\u201d\u201cWho are you\u2026 Hup! The weird animal noises\u2026\u201d Carlus muttered.\u201cThat won\u2019t happen anymore since I just broke the curse. Is that important, though?\u201d Pace asked.\u201cWhat?\u201d This time, no strange animal noise followed his sentence. Carlus realized that the weird cries that were bothering him had disappeared.\u201cSign a contract with me. We will take care of the person you despise,\u201d Pace said.\u201cHup?!\u201d Realizing that Pace wasn\u2019t offering empty promises, Carlus gulped. He flinched, feeling a pressure pressing down on him. He frowned menacingly and turned pale.\u201cHow is that?\u201d Pace asked.\u201cYou\u2026can kill him? Davey has a stigmata, and someone else is also protecting him. He\u2019s not that easy a target.\u201dPace should have been surprised at Carlus revealing information that should be disclosed with caution, but he just shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing but a human.\u201d\u201cYou speak as if you aren\u2019t one.\u201d\u201cWell, it should be settled soon. I have already sent my subordinates that way.\u201d Pace slowly stood up and as he did, Shari, the lady-in-waiting who was hanging from the cross, disappeared into the air. Pace\u2019s red, bloody eyes shone. \u201cThey should have his head by now.\u201d* * *Only one authority allowed for blood-related abilities, such as making blood stronger than metal. It came from an unknown power. It was the power of blood, the authority of vampires. However, the thing that appeared before Davey\u2019s eyes wasn\u2019t exactly a vampire.\u201cWho are you?! How dare you come in here!\u201d\u201cShow your\u2026 Gasp! Elder! Look!\u201dThe dwarves, who were flustered at the sudden attack, ran all over the place. It was only after an unexpected discovery did their jaws drop.-A demonic beast\u2026 And a high-level one at that.\u2018The power of blood is unique to vampires, but a demonic beast has it too.\u2019The beast was about the size of a house, and it had huge claws and spiky thorn-like fur. Its appearance was threatening.\u2018The blood-made knife probably came from that.\u2019The beast looked down at the village as if eyeing its prey, then it fixed its gaze onto Davey.-Grr\u2026The beast smiled eerily, took a deep breath, and let out a loud roar.-Roar!!!The volume was astonishing.\u201cKeugh!\u201d\u201cAgh!\u201dThe aftermath was quite severe; as soon as Davey reflexively released his holy power and cast a protection spell on the two dwarves who were in front of him, an intense vibration resonated through the village and began breaking the surrounding rocks apart.Thud!!\u00a0The two dwarves couldn\u2019t endure the bestial roar even with Davey\u2019s protection spell and collapsed onto the ground.The beast came down, looking satisfied. It never cared about the dwarves anyway, since its target was Davey in the first place.\u201cWould you look at that?\u201d Davey scoffed at the absurdity of the situation.The beast slowly circled around Davey. To Davey, its thoughts of playing with him before killing him were plain as day.Demonic beasts were animals that acted on instinct. The beast using the power of blood, which was the vampires\u2019 unique power, was unexpected, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that it was an idiot.\u2018And this beast has such thoughts? It\u2019s not even funny.\u2019\u201cYou think you\u2019re the predator?\u201dAs if it understood Davey, the beast, which was putting pressure on the surroundings with an eerie strength, became extremely furious.-Grr\u2026 Roar!!!Davey\u2019s gentle provocation had gotten the beast ferocious in seconds.-Blood aura?Perserque sounded surprised as she noticed the red energy current that was surrounding the beast\u2019s claws. The power of blood was a unique power that vampires of a certain rank could release, and some high-ranking ones could even release a red blade energy. Even if it was the same aura, a blood aura was sharper and stronger than a regular one.This particular beast had the power of an \u2018Expert\u2019 level. Normally, it took a person of the highest level in \u2018Expert\u2019 to easily kill any demonic beast that wasn\u2019t a high-ranking one. However, this red beast in front of Davey was incomparably more dangerous than regular demonic beasts.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dCrack!! Davey didn\u2019t have to care about someone watching him go wild because no one was conscious. He put his hand into a void as he stomped and smashed the ground. It was helpful that he had forcibly created a subspace because he didn\u2019t have a good space to store them separately. The spell to create a subspace purely from a mage\u2019s powers and without any tools was a high-ranking seven-circle spell, and it was difficult to cast with the mana circles Davey had now, since he hadn\u2019t reached the seventh circle yet. All he could do was create a very small space that was enough to store two swords.The best way to deal with the beast was to use high-level holy magic or borrow the power of the divine sword, but Davey had two tools that were much better than that.-Roar!!Even the Aura Blade of a \u2018Master\u2019 would have a hard time slashing the beast\u2019s body, which was like a huge lump of metal. However, Davey didn\u2019t cast Aura Blade, the symbol of the \u2018Master\u2019 level, or Aura, the symbol of the \u2018Expert\u2019 level. All he did was swing what was in his hand.\u201cPeople have to use tools.\u201d Since he now had the best weapon, Davey had to try it out. One could only truly appreciate a new car after taking it for a ride.[Demon Sword Art 24th Form][Majestic Flash]It was a slow and gentle slash that seemingly couldn\u2019t even cut the beast. However, as soon as the blade came close to its body, a red afterimage instantly accelerated and split into a dozen strands that covered the sky.28. An OmenThe World of Martial Arts hit its prime when Davey\u2019s swordsmanship teacher, Dokgo Jun, the Heavenly Destroyer, had been alive. From what Davey had heard, there was a time when people grew tired of the extremely corrupt Orthodox partisan dignitaries and those who trained in martial arts found it increasingly difficult to do anything.[So, what I did! Hiccup! So\u2026 Um, what did I say? Hiccup!]To be honest, Dokgo Jun had been nothing but a drunkard who couldn\u2019t really be believed. But Davey had heard numerous times that he had united the entire World of Martial Arts with one sword.There were 88 moves that Dokgo Jun had made, and each one had been like a finishing move; his destructive and extremely powerful swordsmanship combined with Sword Lord Ares\u2019 and became the most optimal form for Davey. Split!!!\u00a0With a momentary vibration of the air, the beast was shredded.\u201cWoah, this is nice.\u201d Davey\u2019s expectations were exceeded. He had made these swords for himself and no one else; as such, there was no way the swords wouldn\u2019t be compatible with him.Davey shook off the blood on the sword as soon as the charging large, red demonic beast fell onto the ground. The blood slowly began evaporating, as if burning away as steam.\u201cI think this is enough for the Red Ribbon.\u201dAs Davey spoke calmly, Perserque poked his cheek.-You. That thing isn\u2019t dead yet.\u201cI know.\u201dShshshsh\u2026\u2018Be careful of what you wish for.\u2019Thanks to the Red Ribbon, the beast had been cut into several pieces. As its blood began moving and combining with each other, as if it had its own will, Davey put his hand into the void again. He pulled out a sapphire-colored sword.\u201cPerserque. Do you know anything about a demonic beast having qualities of immortality when it\u2019s not even a high-ranking vampire?\u201d-A beast using the power of blood isn\u2019t normal in the first place.-Grr\u2026 Roar!!Showing an unbelievable recovery speed, the beast\u2019s shreds of flesh clumped together before it came back alive. The insane beast came at Davey in extreme anger, charging as if it was going to rip him into shreds with its sharp claws. Its speed was no different than before. Split!! As the red flash of light cut its body once again, its attacks lost strength and it flew into the air.\u201cWell then\u2026 Let\u2019s see the authority of destroying immortality.\u201dHigh-ranking vampires had a survival skill similar to \u2018Reach,\u2019 which hid the source of immortality somewhere away from the physical body. Breaking the source would kill it, but without breaking that, the physical body could revive again and again. Death was possible if the physical body was shredded into very small pieces, out of power, or exposed to a large amount of holy power. However, it was difficult for that to actually happen. Simply put, it meant that this fight was going to be an annoying one.As much as it was an OP ability, there were still some limitations; the physical body would be extremely weakened if the source were attacked or if it was struck with high-level holy magic. It would also become less powerful if the body were separated from the source of immortality. It was kind of like a balance patch from God, the divine will\u2026 But it was clearly still a dangerous power when fighting with an unprepared opponent.Unlike \u2018Reach,\u2019 the source of immortality, the survival skill of vampires, couldn\u2019t be hidden far away from the physical body. That was because immortality was quite a high-level authority. It was only given to the high-ranking vampires who were strong enough to be the Lords.Find the original at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u2018But why\u2019s that kind of power given to a demonic beast?\u2019\u00a0Davey momentarily thought that maybe he should capture the demonic beast and investigate this, but it was unfortunate that the current situation wasn\u2019t that great.As the demonic beast, that kept reviving when slashed with the Red Ribbon, collapsed onto the ground with one strike from the Blue Ribbon, it felt strangely exhausted. The Red Ribbon was far superior to the Blue Ribbon in terms of precision and sharpness, but the Blue Ribbon was highly effective on demon-type and immortal beings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHm\u2026 Did I destroy the source of immortality itself?\u201d Davey wondered.-It\u2019s a little different. I think that the system itself is broken.\u201cWhat did Surtr put in this sword?\u201dThe sword Surtr had made could very well be a weapon that would allow a human to kill God. Since Davey wasn\u2019t the one who put the authority to destroy immortality in the sword, he couldn\u2019t understand the mechanism of it; he did learn a lot of things from Surtr, but there were still some important things that he didn\u2019t know.-Other than that, the long aging process and the OP finishing material are probably aspects that amplified the power. Still, it doesn\u2019t affect everything just because it can destroy immortality.Davey knew that these swords would turn out absolutely amazing, but he did feel a little bitter for some reason.\u201cLet\u2019s think about the complicated things later.\u201d Davey calmly glanced somewhere else. Then, he smiled at the empty space. \u201cReady or not\u2026\u201dCrash!! The air momentarily vibrated before the red blade energy Davey had released cut through it.\u201cHere I come, you ass.\u201d* * *Boom!! It was an enormous crash. Pedkhid, the vampire, quickly ran away without looking back. His instincts of fear overtook him entirely.\u2018I\u2019ll die if I get caught! I\u2019m going to die! I\u2019ll really die if I get caught!\u2019\u00a0Pedkhid couldn\u2019t even think about why a powerful and dignified noble like himself had to be running away so disgracefully; he was consumed with the thought that he had to run away from that lunatic of a human. \u2018He\u2019s not easy!\u2019Pedkhid had thrown his dignity out the window, running away once the human suddenly found him. He had seen how the human easily slashed the demonic beast that was sent to provoke him.Boom!!! Boom!!\u201cI can see you.\u201dFeeling a chill in the air, Pedkhid reflexively rolled onto the floor. He then saw frightening red energy slice the space where his neck had just been.\u201cShriek!!\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t paid yet, sir.\u201d The human teased Pedkhid in exactly the same way he had done with the demonic beast. He also didn\u2019t look tired at all, even though he had run quite a long distance.\u201cD\u2014Damn human!!\u201d Pedkhid swore and threw himself down on the ground once again. He didn\u2019t expect this at first\u2014no, he had underestimated his opponent, thinking him to be like all other humans.When Pedkhid had first been given the assignment, he didn\u2019t understand why Pace, the high-ranking vampire who was his master and superior, had given such orders. They were dignified nobles, so they had no need to be this cautious in killing a human. Furthermore, Pace was a transcendental being who ranked above regular vampires. Pedkhid was also a mid-rank vampire, but he could proudly say that his powers were close to that of a high-rank vampire since he had received the grace of Pace. In fact, as the demonic beast he had controlled had also received Pace\u2019s grace, it was also a powerful being that even strong Swordmasters couldn\u2019t easily kill.According to Pedkhid\u2019s plan, he was going to scare the human with the demonic beast and toy around with him. But now, everything was clearly a mere delusion on his part. He had misunderstood the severity of the situation.Crash!!\u201cKeugh!\u201dAs the monstrous human instantly flew up and pinned him on the ground, Pedkhid\u2019s survival instincts began to ring like an emergency alarm.\u201cS\u2026 Seriously, what are you?! Shriek! What are you doing?! Stop it!!\u201d Pedkhid yelled.\u201cWhat do you mean?! This is an act of love!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d In the sudden silence, Pedkhid could tell that this human was absolutely crazy.\u201cMan, you need to make these kinds of jokes to enjoy life. Do you really believe that gays do this to express affection?\u201d The human complained, still pinning Pedkhid down so that he couldn\u2019t move. Then he pierced through Pedkhid with two fingers.\u201cKuk!!\u201d Feeling an intense pain, Pedkhid went as stiff as a plank.The human smiled with satisfaction. \u201cNow you\u2019re calm.\u201d\u201cW\u2026 What did you do to my body, human?! You inferior species\u2026 Do you want to die? Get rid of this now!\u201d Pedkhid shouted without thinking.The human just shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll let you go later, but there\u2019s something I want to make sure of first.\u201d\u2018Sorry, but I\u2019m famous for being good at keeping secrets among the vampires!\u2019 Pedkhid thought. He was sure that he would never reveal anything to the human, but he was soon dumbfounded by what the human said next.\u201cOh, really? Sorry, but I know a perfect spell that can read all of your thoughts.\u201dPedkhid thought something like that couldn\u2019t exist; however, all he could do was scream as a strange dark purple flame blazed from the human\u2019s hand.* * *The strange flame, which seemed to be alive, burned. It threatened to burn Pedkhid\u2019s legs.[Mind Subjugation][Dark magic \u2018Curse Mark\u2019][Spell Merger][Fire of Interrogation]However, the scorching dark purple flame left no burn wounds. It only gave him a nasty pain.\u201cKaaaah!!! It\u2019s hot! Hot! Put it out! Please put it out!!\u201d Pedkhid squirmed around, screaming with snot and spit all over his face.Perserque frowned.-You. He is the enemy, but this is\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not going to die,\u201d Davey said.-You know that I\u2019m not worried about him dying!\u201cDemon Lord, do I have to consider the situation of someone who is after my life?\u201dPerserque frowned at Davey\u2019s rhetorical question.-You are right, but\u2026As Perserque struggled for an answer, Davey dulled the flame that was hurting Pedkhid. He said calmly, \u201cWell, okay. We don\u2019t have to be barbaric when we can do something else.\u201d-I won\u2019t stop you if you are aware of it.Davey wondered if this awfully sweet little girl was really the cause of a world war between species. He then watched the trembling vampire before stepping on him.\u201cKeugh!\u201d Perhaps due to the mental shock, Pedkhid\u2019s pupils dilated. It looked like he had been ripped apart despite not having a single scratch on him.\u201cI don\u2019t need a lot from you, so let\u2019s keep this short.\u201d\u201cGroan\u2026 Moan\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst, what are you?\u201d\u201cHuff\u2026 Puff\u2026\u00a0Human! You think I\u2019d\u2026 Shriek!\u201d Pedkhid trembled and squirmed at the sight of the dark purple flame in Davey\u2019s hands.\u2018This isn\u2019t an ordinary flame, but a type of curse made to cause pain. It makes sense that he is afraid.\u2019\u00a0Davey knew that such a curse was made to cause the victim a nasty pain, like they were burning alive, but the curse wouldn\u2019t kill or injure them.\u2018It might be foul and wicked, but what more could you expect from a curse that has malicious intent in the first place?\u2019Rho Aias, Davey\u2019s dark magic teacher, hadn\u2019t taught Davey this so that he could use it like this; she had taught him this curse so that he could learn how to counter it. However, Davey was the kind of person who had to use everything he had.\u201cYou want more?\u201d\u201cP\u2014Pedkhid! I\u2019m a count!\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 How does a mid-rank trash like you have the power of immortality?\u201d Davey asked, knowing that the power of immortality was the source of pride for the vampire nobles.Pedkhid knew exactly what would happen if he stayed silent. He had seen the demonic beast that had the power of immortality be slaughtered in one blow.\u201cYou could actually die if I slash you right now. So, next question. Your target is me, and it\u2019s because of that vampire lady-in-waiting, right?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cT\u2014That\u2019s right!\u201d Pedkhid probably didn\u2019t want to tell Davey, and it was true that he was better at keeping secrets than most; however, he had answered almost reflexively because he was in such severe pain. He even struggled to stay conscious.\u201cThen, answer me this: why do you and that demonic beast from earlier have the power of immortality?\u201dPedkhid stared at Davey while trembling. He looked like a million thoughts were running through his mind; he couldn\u2019t tell Davey even if he wanted to, but he was scared of the pain. He was in a predicament.Davey thought that maybe he should pressure Pedkhid a little more, but he couldn\u2019t. As Pedkhid began squirming around in pain, Davey simply asked, \u201cHm?\u201dFind the original at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cI\u2019d rather choose death!\u201d With those last words, Pedkhid began puffing up like a balloon before bursting apart.Boom!!-A taboo\u2026 And it\u2019s complete death. What a cruel curse\u2026Pedkhid\u2019s last words might have not been his, but a message of the person who had inflicted him with the curse. The fact that he wasn\u2019t granted the use of immortality meant that he wasn\u2019t that valuable. His complete death was so cut and dry that it was almost meaningless.\u201cI did expect that to happen.\u201d Davey nodded. He put distance between him and Pedkhid\u2019s exploded body, then squinted. \u201cI guess this is all I can get for now.\u201d-Davey\u2026After Perserque lowered her head and mumbled apologetically, Davey answered calmly, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you to be sorry about. I asked him for small bits of information at a time because I knew this would happen. I\u2019ll have to get the rest from the others I capture.\u201dPerserque tightened her lips as if she was somewhat leery.* * *Once a curse was broken, it would be made known to the one who cast it. This meant that Davey knew that one of the curses he had inflicted on Carlus had been undone. It had become dormant, to be exact, but Davey was nonetheless surprised. It would have been pretty difficult to find it, and yet they did.Seeing the dwarves working day and night on the restoration of the sacred item, Davey felt a little bitter. It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t suspected it since vampires never forgive those who had hurt their prestige.Davey had guessed that this situation was inevitable as Shari, the vampire lady-in-waiting whom he had slashed, definitely seemed to be from quite a prominent family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Davey hadn\u2019t heard about the details of the damage, but it was a miracle that there were no casualties.\u201cOh, wise teacher! You\u2019re here!\u201d Elder Golgouda and Goulda greeted Davey. The incident with the demonic beast had caused them a lot of trouble, on top of the headache-inducing restoration of the sacred sword.\u201cWise teacher, I am ashamed to have shown you this ugly sight,\u201d Golgouda said regretfully.\u201cThat\u2019s alright. Are you hurt anywhere?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m fine. The beast\u2019s attacks were less severe than I thought. Although, dozens of houses burned down and some dwarves were injured.\u201d\u201cDo you usually have demonic beast attacks here?\u201dAt Davey\u2019s question, Golgouda bitterly smiled and shook his head. Then, he opened his cupboard and brought out a huge bottle as if he had been waiting to do this. He simply said, \u201cI think there\u2019s something you want to say, wise teacher. Let\u2019s have a drink.\u201d* * *\u201cI cherished this liquor for a long time, but I can bring it out for you!\u201dIt can be hard to make great work when its stolen from bit.ly/3iBfjkV.Lightly swirling the aromatic liquor in his cup, Davey quietly closed his eyes. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll show you what the liquor of other continents tastes like.\u201d\u201cOther continents? Is it liquor from the eastern or southern continents?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s similar.\u201d Davey was talking about the hard liquor from the World of Martial Arts, to be exact. He thought it would be perfect for these dwarves since it was as potent as the notorious dwarf-made liquor. Then, he said, \u201cActually, I came here to give you this.\u201d\u201cAnd this is?\u201d Golgouda asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a notebook with the information you need to restore the sacred item. It\u2019ll take you a while to finish it, and I have to start heading back.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dThe dwarves looked disappointed, but they still held onto the notebook dearly. Golgouda spoke up, \u201cI really don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll ever repay this debt\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything. Actually, I should be the one thanking you.\u201d Davey had obtained the bones of the ancient dragon, orichalcum, adamantium, and many other valuable materials, so it actually seemed like he should be the one repaying them. It was true that the dwarves had greatly contributed to the creation of the twin swords, which were currently half-dormant.\u201cThat\u2019s a different matter. We did that because we wanted to,\u201d Golgouda said.\u201cSo did I; I had my own reasons as well.\u201d Davey felt a little thankful to these dwarves who had taken care of his teacher\u2019s work and had held onto it however they could. Although, this was different from what Davey had to do.\u201cAnyway, the dwarf guards were quite busy.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cGoulda.\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201d Goulda coughed awkwardly when Golgouda stopped him from talking.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cBrother, is the wise teacher an outsider? How are you going to gain any trust when you hide something like this?\u201d Goulda criticized.\u201cAhem!\u201d Golgouda cleared his throat as if he was in thought, then he slowly opened his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. They say that a child has gone missing from the orphanage. We are trying to get the guards to find evidence of the child, but\u2026\u201dDemonic beasts were evil. There seemed to be nothing left behind, even though some kind of evidence should have been left if a child was involved in an incident where the demonic beast had run that wild.\u201cWe have a problem now, because nothing is being confirmed and there\u2019s huge confusion\u2026 I think that it might be dangerous for you to keep staying here, wise teacher.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of, I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m going to head back.\u201d As the two dwarves stayed silent, Davey added, \u201cI think that the demonic beast hid here not because it was after the village, but me. The problem should go away if I leave.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cI apologize for not telling you.\u201d\u201cN\u2014Nonsense! How is that your fault?\u201dIt all depended on perception; any person who was hostile toward Davey would have gladly pointed their fingers at him.Afterwards, Davey just made an excuse that his stigmata had stimulated the demonic beast, leading to the beast attacking the village. After all, it was true that he was the target. He was only apprehensive that the vampires might take their anger out on this village after he left, but he didn\u2019t have the power to care about that right now.At last, the two elders said nothing. Perhaps they also thought it would be safer if Davey went back.* * *There was something about Davey that had inspired the dwarves to focus on more than just their business. There were probably a multitude of reasons behind the sudden change, but there was no need to bring that up.\u201cS-Stop! Show your identification!\u201dThe first thing Davey did as soon as he sold the moon flower leaves was to buy equipment from the merchant companies to resupply the militia, which had now become the royal guards. He believed that the guards who protected the territory\u2019s palace were the face of the territory itself.The royal guards wore leather armor and used worn spears or swords. Perhaps it was because of the several dwarves who had followed Davey in, but the royal guards watching them from the run-down watchtower came down and stopped them. They were terrified.\u201cYour seigneur,\u201d Davey said. As both he and his party were pretty tired from the long journey, Davey had gone straight to the point and skipped the complicated, formal process.\u201cS\u2014Saint, sir!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a saint. Was everything okay while I was gone?\u201d\u201cYes, yes!!\u201d As if he was a private meeting the division commander, the royal guard gave a stiff answer with a voice as loud as a foghorn. His response amused the dwarves.\u201cThe territory feels exceptionally quiet today.\u201d\u201cT-That is\u2026 The merchant companies and mercenaries already went by today, sir!\u201d\u201cAlright. Keep up the hard work. I\u2019ll hear the detailed report once I get in.\u201dPerhaps it was because Davey had just returned to the territory after a few weeks. Monmider, who was the captain of the royal guards, Royal Attendant Bernile, and the other servants greeted him in a straight line as soon as he entered the run-down palace. He had said before that he wanted to skip the formalities, but they were forced to do this because of Bernile\u2019s strong opinion that Davey\u2019s authority as the seigneur and the prince of this country would weaken if they didn\u2019t do this.\u201cThe people behind you\u2026\u201d Royal Attendant Bernile\u2019s voice trailed off.\u201cThey have come here from the Yellowstone Tribe to help repair the territory\u2019s facilities. We should be grateful for them. Please bring them drinks and meat since they\u2019re probably tired from traveling. What about lodgings?\u201d\u201cI have prepared it in advance as you ordered, but it is not great due to the lack of time,\u201d Royal Attendant Bernile said.\u201cThat\u2019s alright; I heard everything about the territory on the way here. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, is it not?\u201d Eighth Elder Goulda, the only elder who followed Davey here, spoke confidently on behalf of all the dwarves.\u201cYes\u2026 I am Royal Attendant Bernile. Please call me whatever you are comfortable with.\u201d\u201cI am Goulda, the eighth elder of the Yellowstone Tribe.\u201dDwarves rarely left their village, even if they were doing business with humans, so many humans had never actually seen dwarves in person despite having heard about them. As such, the servants of the palace couldn\u2019t help but be fascinated by the dwarves.\u201cWise teacher, you don\u2019t have to do all this for us,\u201d Goulda said.\u201cHow could I not? You are all my precious guests,\u201d Davey replied.\u201cHaha, dwarves are meant to live with fire and stone. And your problems are ours as well.\u201dHearing Goulda\u2019s comment, Captain Monmider\u2019s gaze slightly changed. He seemed to wonder what he had done to make these dwarves, who seldom left their village, act like this.\u2018Man, you really don\u2019t trust anyone.\u2019\u201cI think the captain is going to need to have some faith.\u201d\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cRight? It\u2019s not like I constantly stab you in the back or something.\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d\u201cThe Heins Territory was my mother\u2019s territory; I\u2019m from here as well.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Now realizing his mistake, Monmider backed away while bowing his head apologetically.\u201cLet\u2019s go inside; I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cI will get the bath running.\u201d\u201cFirst, let\u2019s do a quick briefing.\u201dDavey had heard most of the territory\u2019s matters through the communication crystal. He knew that the preparation to harvest moon grass was going smoothly, but he hadn\u2019t been in a good situation to receive reports on the little details.\u201cThere are seventeen merchant companies in total that have currently bought land in the territory and are building.\u201d\u201cThe total number of people?\u201d\u201cWith the wizard towers, the schools of alchemy, the temple, the merchant companies, and the small number of guards, it\u2019s about three thousand people.\u201d\u2018Wow.\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s about three thousand people requesting to immigrate here, and our current number of residents is only about two hundred\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is still increasing. The people who have predicted that this place will become profitable are thinking of making a commercial district here. Since this territory\u2019s location made it quite good in terms of transportation, it seems they want to make a middle point between the Holy Empire and the Empire.\u201d\u201cThe estimated number of people?\u201d\u201cIt seems that about four thousand people will request to immigrate here after the second quarter.\u201dDavey was surprised by the numbers now that he was hearing them for himself. \u2018Two hundred to four thousand\u2026 That\u2019s about twenty times more.\u2019\u201cEverything is going well.\u201dAny city needed a population to prosper. They would face many problems if the number of residents increased all of a sudden, but Davey wouldn\u2019t be able to run this territory if he was afraid of that. Nothing really bothered him right now.\u201cWise teacher, I see that the conditions of the territory are abysmal.\u201d\u201cI am ashamed.\u201d\u201cMore than that, I am horrified by the condition of this palace you live in,\u201d Goulda said sternly and tapped the tools on his belt. \u201cThis is a good chance for us to repay the debt. Although our skills are nothing compared to yours, we will make a new space for you to live in as the best craftsmen in the continent.\u201dDwarf-made palaces and castles were famous continent-wide, because dwarves normally didn\u2019t leave their villages a lot, and their skills, unique design, and finish were incomparable to anyone on the continent.\u201cDon\u2019t say that you\u2019re fine or something. No one follows a leader that does not take care of themselves, no matter how outstanding the leader is.\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to say anything.\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201d\u2018Was I too transparent?\u2019\u201cHowever, I was wondering if I could ask you to add a few things I would like. It\u2019s probably something that you will like, too.\u201dAs Monmider quietly lowered his head, Goulda laughed heartily and said, \u201cGreat! Hey, you people! It\u2019s time to show them what we\u2019ve got! Is there anyone tired from walking for just a few days?!\u201d\u201cOf course not! If we were tired, we wouldn\u2019t live up to the name of \u2018the best craftsmen in the continent\u2019! Alright! Let\u2019s get to it!\u201dAs Davey vacantly stared at the eager dwarves who were rushing inside, Royal Attendant asked cautiously, \u201cPardon me, Your Highness, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026didn\u2019t brainwash them or something, right?\u201d Royal Attendant Bernile looked embarrassed as Davey stared at him with a flat expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since Goulda was very skilled, he was the one assigning people to the appropriate areas. The dwarves\u2019 main goal was to repair the territory\u2019s facilities. After hearing about the current situation in the territory, Goulda used his unique expertise as a dwarf and placed the appropriate technicians and young men in areas the way Davey would have done too.Of course, Davey generously provided artifacts or alchemy tools to boost the dwarves\u2019 efficiency to the extreme, and manpower, as it would be difficult for them to do everything alone. He was able to obtain all these resources, since the territory was packed with wizard towers, schools of alchemy, temples, and merchant companies. And since the territory had more than enough money and all the organizations were handing him small bribes, there were no shortages of any resource.\u201cLet\u2019s do that here\u2026\u201d\u201cI have a good idea for that.\u201dFor days, Davey discussed the development of the territory multiple times with the dwarves.The better the foundation, the more the territory would benefit. If they were to create a space or facility that everyone would want to live in, the merchants nearby would be desperate to build things of similar quality to prevent their sales from decreasing. Then, the wizard towers and the schools of alchemy would be forced to match that quality as well, since they were proud organizations.Davey was trying to rapidly improve the condition of the territory while preventing the organizations\u2019 power play of establishing their branches here. To him, this was worth a shot. Of course, it didn\u2019t matter if they acted out of his expectations, because he had nothing to lose.Perhaps it was because of the dwarves\u2019 special skills, but most of the shabby portable lodgings made out of wooden panels were replaced with temporary houses. However, problems began arising from the sudden increase in the territory\u2019s population.There was conflict from the friction between a growing group of people in the territory. No resident was allowed to discriminate against another, and Davey always made thoughtful and fair decisions, but life didn\u2019t always go as planned.Davey only managed to solve the immediate problems after pulling several all-nighters. Now, all he wanted to do was sleep. He groaned, \u201cDamn it. I think fighting would be much easier than this.\u201d-Being a leader isn\u2019t easy.\u201cNow I know why kings lived such short lives,\u201d Davey said to Perserque as he plopped down onto his large bed. The coziness and warmth of this new ergonomic bed by the School of Alchemy surrounded his entire body. Befitting for royalty, the bed was huge. It would also be considered a pretty high-quality bed on Earth as well.\u2018I want to relax.\u2019 Davey covered his eyes and let out a deep breath while laying silent in the dark room.\u201cGroan\u2026\u201d Then, for some reason, there was a little girl\u2019s voice in the supposedly empty room.Davey got up almost reflexively and noticed that there was something curled up inside the blanket, which was at the center of the bed. \u201c\u2026\u201d Remaining calm, all Davey could do was stare at the small squirming thing with mixed feelings.29. You Have to Take Responsibility for Your Child.It was human, but the lumpy shape was too small to be an adult human.\u201cDid I get the wrong room?\u201d-There\u2019s no way.Davey squinted and quickly lit a mana stone lantern, despite still being in disbelief. Once the dark room was lit, the shape was revealed to be\u2026definitely someone wiggling in the middle of the massive bed, which seemed like it could fit seven or eight people!It wasn\u2019t uncommon for someone to enter Davey\u2019s room. Bribes didn\u2019t always come in the form of money. Sometimes, it came in the form of offering sexual services. It had been about two months since Davey had returned from the dwarf village. It seemed that the organizations saw Davey as an incredibly important business partner after confirming that moon grass was consistently harvested. And so, this was one of their ways of offering bribes.This wasn\u2019t rare or a big deal in a world where monarchy was deeply rooted in society, but it was different for Davey; he wasn\u2019t interested in sleeping with a woman he didn\u2019t love. He wasn\u2019t impotent, but he had learned different values from his time in the Hall.[Davey! If you use your dick thoughtlessly, I will rip it off even if I have to leave the Hall. Do you understand me? You know I always keep my word.]The warning of the immoral saintess had sunk deeper than Davey had thought. \u2018For the first ever saintess to have no filter\u2026\u2019It first started with sex workers from different territories, since the Heins Territory didn\u2019t really have such businesses. Several different people were responsible for bringing these young and beautiful girls into Davey\u2019s room, but Davey never bothered to find out who they were before sending the girls back.However, people from noble families and students of mages or scholars\u2014people with some social status\u2014began showing up. Of course, Davey sent them all away. But this was a regular occurrence when he wanted to take a rest, so he declared one thing: whatever business they had would be thrown out the window if they sent someone to his room one more time.The declaration caused a pretty big fuss, but it was quite effective. No one came to see him afterwards, and he was able to enjoy his time relaxing, but\u2026\u201cDo you think those guys assume I\u2019m a pedophile just because I don\u2019t want to fool around with women?\u201d-Giggle.As Perserque smiled mysteriously, Davey flipped over the blanket and the shape finally revealed itself.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Unsurprisingly, it was a cute girl with glistening red hair. She was dressed in a white dress that made her look pure and innocent. She seemed to only be about five or six and looked quite well off. With chubby cheeks and small hands, her cute appearance was enough to turn heads on the street.Davey did expect it to be a child since the figure was too small to be an adult. He believed that those guys mistook him to be impotent or a pedophile since he didn\u2019t sleep with any of the previous women.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d The small child groaned while waking up, then slowly opened her eyes. Her bright and clear red eyes had a deep gaze, as if staring at them would get you lost in their depths.\u201cHi, little girl. Who are you?\u201d Davey asked cautiously. He already planned to beat those damn people later. \u2018She\u2019s a child. She doesn\u2019t know anything.\u2019\u201cHm\u2026\u201d The girl rubbed her eyes with her small hands before blankly staring up at Davey for a while. She looked up at him with indiscernible eyes and soon opened her eyes wide as if she definitely recognized him. Then, she smiled brightly. \u201cGiggle!\u201d\u201cHup!\u201d-That\u2019s too cute\u2026 It hurts my heart\u2026The girl\u2019s cute smile made Davey stumble. Even Perserque collapsed in the air and landed on his shoulder. Davey shouted angrily, \u201cThese damn people put this innocent child in here as a mistress?! Amy!\u201d\u2018Amy just abandoned this child here when I specifically told her not to let anyone in?\u2019Amy immediately came running when she heard Davey, as if she had been waiting. Her eyebags seemed less severe now that Davey had come back, since she had less work to do.\u201cY\u2014Your Highness! What is\u2026\u201d Amy widened her eyes when she saw a little girl on the bed while Davey was standing with a menacing frown. \u201cYour Highness! Did you?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Did I not specifically tell you not to let anyone in?\u201dAmy, who was staring at Davey with a suspicious gaze, blinked. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t let anyone in! Did you\u2026not bring her here, Your Highness?\u201d She genuinely didn\u2019t seem to know anything about this. Most of the palace\u2019s happenings would be reported to her, but if she didn\u2019t know, then the only possibility was that one of the servants had taken a bribe to sneak the little girl in here. Otherwise, the little girl had wandered in here all by herself; either way, it wasn\u2019t good.\u201cDidn\u2019t anyone take me seriously?\u201dAs Davey looked at the giggling girl with a severe expression, Amy quickly ran over and took the girl into her arms. She backed away with a pale face. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness\u2026 I should\u2019ve made sure to keep this place in order\u2026 There definitely wasn\u2019t anyone in here before you came\u2026\u201dThey took advantage of the slightest opportunity.The girl smiled brightly at Davey and reached out to him. She clapped her hands and giggled. \u201cDada!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHeh?\u201dEveryone froze. The little girl didn\u2019t speak very clearly, but Davey wasn\u2019t an idiot; he knew what the girl had said.Clutter\u2026 Suddenly, the cupboard leaning against the wall slowly opened up while everyone was still frozen in place. A blue-eyed little girl, who looked exactly like this girl on the bed, peeked out.\u201c\u2026\u201d Davey\u2019s silence went on for longer than expected.* * *The sun rose after the night with two moons passed.\u201cScream! Miss! You can\u2019t run around like that!\u201d\u201cGiggle!\u201dDavey was woken up by someone\u2019s excited laughter. He stared blankly at the ceiling and covered his eyes while taking a deep breath. \u201cWow, I really didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d He could only blame his own stupidity; if he had just used [Check Information] on the little girl in the first place, things wouldn\u2019t have gone this chaotically.-I don\u2019t know. I think I did want you to feel a little guilty.Perserque said as she flew toward Davey, who was vacantly staring into space.\u201cHow do I change a name that I\u2019ve already chosen?\u201dSupport us at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.As soon as Davey complained, the door of the silent bedroom burst open, and a cute girl with long, red hair came running in. She was still wearing a white dress, but it looked more luxurious than before. She looked around the room, and when she found Davey, she came running toward him with a terribly cute smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Dada!\u201d\u201cY\u2014Yes\u2026\u201d Davey held the girl in his arms with an awkward and forced smile. He asked, \u201cWhy are you so cheerful in the morning?\u201d\u201cHehehe! Dada! Dada!\u201dNobody knew that a sword could have the authority to materialize into a human. Davey was aware that Caldeiras, the divine sword, could materialize and show her ego, but it made no sense for a sword to become a blob of energy and adopt the human form all by itself.-Name: Red Ribbon.-Status: Complete.-Shape: A wide, two-bladed Ring Pommel Sword.-Length: 88 centimeters.-Width: 6 centimeters.-Contractor: Davey O\u2019Rowane.-Completion Level: 100%-Details: Ego has awakened; consciousness of ego is quite young since the ego has awakened earlier than expected due to an unknown reason; although the original creator is different, it sees Davey O\u2019Rowane, the person who finished the sword with everything he had, as her father; ego develops with time; caution: extremely cute.\u201c\u2026\u201d-I\u2014It\u2019s not me!As Perserque shouted with a bright red face, Davey quietly nodded.Honestly, Davey had thought that he had seen everything; he had survived being thrown into an extreme wasteland and multiple battles that should have killed him. He had changed a curse into a blessing and had also created a springboard for the territory\u2019s success. However, he had never expected nor experienced a sword of his making that took on the form of a human and saw him as her father.\u201cHehe. Hehehe.\u201dAs the little girl giggled happily in Davey\u2019s arms, he looked up at Amy who was wheezing. Amy tried to catch her breath. \u201cWheeze\u2026 Wheeze\u2026\u00a0I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness\u2026 She is\u2026 Wheeze\u2026 Very active\u2026\u201dDavey could tell that the little girl had incredible stamina despite being young; after all, she was similar to the divine sword. Although she took on the form of a little girl, she was probably a huge ball of energy that had been accumulating for over thousands of years on the inside.\u201cThanks for working so hard in the morning\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2014It\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Amy backed away, looking at Davey and Red Ribbon like she couldn\u2019t understand this situation. She usually didn\u2019t doubt Davey, but if even she was looking at him like that, everyone else would definitely be bewildered.Perhaps it was because of the red-haired girl playing in his arms, but Davey soon saw the blue-haired girl looking up at him. She had her arms out, tugging on his shirt.\u201cBlue Ribbon\u2026\u201d\u201cD\u2026 Dada.\u201d\u2018When did she come in here?\u2019Blue Ribbon sounded similar to Red Ribbon. In fact, they had such similar appearances that it would be difficult to tell them apart if it wasn\u2019t for their differently colored hair and eyes. Davey could also tell them apart by the slight nuances in their voice and impression. Maybe it was because he had made them, but he could strangely distinguish them rather easily.\u2018Maybe I have really become their dad.\u2019 When Davey suppressed a deep sigh from escaping his lips and picked up Blue Ribbon, he heard a gurgle. Red Ribbon wasn\u2019t hiding her happiness, and Blue Ribbon blushed while hugging him tightly. He glanced at them and thought, \u2018They are so cute that it hurts my heart.\u2019\u201cMiss, your hair isn\u2019t done yet,\u201d Amy said.\u201cNoo!\u201d The girls stuck their tongues out to Amy and buried their faces into Davey\u2019s chest.Looking at Amy\u2019s helpless expression, Davey said, \u201cRed Ribbon, you have to be a good girl and listen to her.\u201d He persuaded Red Ribbon, since she listened to him relatively well.Red Ribbon pouted and held Amy\u2019s hand.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Amy, who was wheezing a couple of minutes before, now blushed. \u201cY\u2026 Your Highness, the girls are so cute! Where did you find them?\u201d It was a relief that she didn\u2019t think Davey was actually their father, although to be exact, he did create them.\u201cWho knows about these girls?\u201d Davey asked.Amy played with her fingers, then answered hesitantly, \u201cFor now, only a few of the servants in the palace. Since Lady Red Ribbon is very active\u2026\u201d She meant that Red Ribbon had been running around the palace as soon as morning came, having stayed quiet for the entire night.\u201cThey don\u2019t yet know that the girls are associated with me, right?\u201d\u201cPardon? Ah\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cOkay. Keep this a secret until I\u2019m done organizing my thoughts. And make sure to keep everyone quiet.\u201dAlthough Amy seemed like she couldn\u2019t understand Davey\u2019s actions, she nodded.Davey wouldn\u2019t need to do any contemplation if these girls were really normal children. Feeling like he was going to get an ulcer, he forced a smile and quietly told Amy, \u201cLet them do whatever they want, except for going outside.\u201dAmy vigorously nodded like she would absolutely make sure of it.* * *\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see.\u201d As Davey spoke in a determined tone, the eyes of two girls who were sitting on the bed glistened. He added, \u201cFirst, do you want to try this? It\u2019s called a cookie.\u201d\u201cCwookie?\u201d\u201cYes, a cookie. Do you want to try it? It\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cGiggle!\u201d\u201cBlabber!\u201dWhen Davey handed each of them a cookie, Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon smelled it with shining eyes, then simultaneously shoved it in their mouths. There was no way to tell how swords like them could eat, but it seemed like they could.Inconveniently, Davey had to find out the details himself since Perserque\u2019s [Check Information] only provided him with basic information.-How can it be possible for a sword to eat?\u201cThey sleep and they eat. I know that they have emotions because they are egos, but\u2026\u201dThe children reached out with spreadout palms after already gobbling down the cookies.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cDada\u2026\u201d\u201cCooooookie.\u201d\u2018Do they want more?\u2019 Davey found the situation weird since it felt like he was really teaching his children. He said, \u201cYou can\u2019t. Your teeth will rot if you have too many.\u201d\u201cAww\u2026\u201d Red Ribbon didn\u2019t hide her disappointment.Blue Ribbon looked at Davey in sadness even though she didn\u2019t explicitly show it.Sob\u2026 Sob. Both girls soon looked up at Davey in tears, the best weapon of children.\u201cNo.\u201dSob\u2026\u201cN\u2026 No.\u201dWeep\u2026 Sob\u2026\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026 You can\u2019t\u2026 You can\u2026 Okay! I\u2019ll allow it. You can have one more!\u201d\u2018Oh, disciplining them is hard already.\u2019\u201cYay!\u201d The two girls excitedly ran into Davey\u2019s arms and smiled.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d Davey couldn\u2019t help but frown. Still, he made sure to hide that expression from the children.-They\u2019re not going to listen to you if you do whatever they want.\u2018No way. I mean, they\u2019re swords.\u2019-From the looks of it, they are similar to real children. They might change depending on how you teach and discipline them.\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d-Giggle, isn\u2019t it funny? They might become saint swords or demon swords depending on how you teach them.Well, although the standard for whether a sword was a saint or demon depended on the user and not the sword itself, Perserque had a point.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s check out the most important thing.\u201d Davey couldn\u2019t just let go of his suspicions so easily. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem to think of them as innocent children if they were left like that, but\u2026 Davey asked, \u201cOkay, then. Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon. Do you think you can go back to your original form?\u201dThe children understood language rather well. Their speech wasn\u2019t fully developed yet, but that might be due to them not having materialized for long yet. The two kids initially tilted their heads in confusion, but soon went into Davey\u2019s arms as if they understood.A quick look at tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w will leave you more fulfilled.Davey smiled at the children\u2019s warmth for a moment. Very quickly, the two kids emitted a bright light from their bodies as they fully transformed into two swords. Cute, red-haired Red Ribbon transformed into a red sword, and shy Blue Ribbon turned into a blue sword. The children did not protest the transformation, perhaps because that was their original form.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Davey lightly swung the swords after making sure the children had fully transformed. It was a relief that the swords hadn\u2019t weakened or anything from the egos\u2019 awakening. It actually seemed like the power within them had become denser.\u2018Transformation is natural as well.\u2019\u00a0Davey realized that the girls could change their forms quite naturally as if they relied on instincts.\u201cThat\u2019s good. You can come back now.\u201d As Davey spoke with a cookie in his hand, the swords soon changed back into two girls and ran toward him excitedly. It was as if they were never swords in the first place.\u201cDada!\u201d\u201cC\u2014Cooookie, p\u2014please!\u201dThey were trying so hard to speak even when they couldn\u2019t pronounce words properly. As Davey handed them a cookie with an insuppressible smile, the girls began nibbling their cookie with a serious face; they were trying to savor it.\u201cSince I can\u2019t just leave them, I should still declare that they are under my care.\u201d-Aren\u2019t they your daughters? Well, foster daughters might be more like it.\u201cAre you trying to make me ineligible for marriage?\u201d-Wasn\u2019t that your intention in the first place?Davey clicked his tongue at Perserque\u2019s question and stared at the girls. He could\u2019ve just said that he was taking care of them if they were just children, but they were still his first pieces of work that had an ego. Even if they were swords, it didn\u2019t seem too bad to live up to their expectations and act as their father. It was right to take responsibility for them since he had created them in the first place, but\u2026-Royalty must be cautious with adoption.\u201cRight.\u201dIt would cause quite a commotion if an unmarried man were to adopt two children with an unknown bloodline. His reputation would be damaged instantly, and trivial rumors would spread. Everyone else would raise a fuss even when the man in question wouldn\u2019t care at all; some nobles just have their noses stuck in everyone\u2019s business.\u201cWhatever. They can talk crap about me if they want. I\u2019m not going to care about that when I have a million other things to do.\u201dDavey needed to develop a territory and regain his strength. To Davey, who had unexpectedly come back to another life after spending nearly a thousand years in the Hall, there was no clear goal. The only thing he could think of was to live a long life since he had never led a long life in both his past and current life combined.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She flailed about excitedly, and the girls stared up at him with sparkling eyes. They wanted to see when he was going to eat it.\u201cYou girls are so sweet,\u201d Davey praised.As he unhesitantly munched on the cookie because he found them to be so adorably thoughtful, Red Ribbon happily giggled and hugged his neck to give him kisses all over.Knock knock.\u201cYour Highness, it is Amy.\u201dDavey stopped himself from squirming at Red Ribbon\u2019s adorable nature, which he could never get tired of. He then heard a knock at the door. He coughed awkwardly and wiped the smile from his face. \u201cAhem, what is it?\u201d\u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d\u201cWithout a message? Did they throw their manners out the window?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026 It is Princess Winley.\u201d\u201cWhat? Where is she right now? Lead the way!\u201dThere were always exceptions. Amy didn\u2019t say anything for a while, as if she was a little bewildered by Davey\u2019s confident shout.* * *\u201cBig brother!\u201d The green-haired girl, who was admiring the small but elegant garden, ran into Davey\u2019s arms as soon as she saw him.\u201cHave you been well?\u201d Davey asked. It had been almost six months since they had last seen each other. The last time they had met was just as Davey was leaving for the territory.\u201cI really missed you, Big brother.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Are you hurt anywhere?\u201dDavey patted Winley on the back and stroked her head. As she blushed and looked up at him, she slightly pushed him away. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re mean. How could you not even send a letter?\u201d\u201cHaha, sorry. I was a little busy.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026 I\u2019m letting it slide because of the territory\u2019s situation, so consider yourself lucky,\u201d Winley said.\u201cAnyway, where\u2019s Baris?\u201d\u201cHe is\u2026\u201d Winley slightly frowned and squinted. Then, she gasped with sparkling eyes, as if she had found something interesting. \u201cHowever, Big brother, who are those children\u2026?\u201dWinley had just now noticed Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon, who were clinging onto Davey\u2019s back and hiding behind him. She couldn\u2019t help but smile at the two girls, who peeked out from behind Davey with nervous faces. Winley exclaimed, \u201cT\u2014They\u2019re so cute!\u201d\u201cWoah!\u201d\u201cKyak!\u201dWinley immediately ran over and hugged them, so Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon flailed around in surprise. But they couldn\u2019t escape from Winley\u2019s arms as she screamed about how cute they were. Winley also rubbed her cheeks against theirs.\u201cDada!\u201d\u201cNooo!\u201dThe girls seemed to like it only when Davey did it; he guessed that there was a difference between a parent and a stranger.\u201cLet\u2019s go in now.\u201d Davey stopped Winley after seeing the girls\u2019 look for help.Regaining control, Winley backed up from the children. \u201cHm\u2026 I must\u2019ve gone crazy for a second.\u201d She kept glancing over at them like she would hug them for days without letting go if she got the chance. As she put aside her desires and followed Davey into the drawing room, her eyes sparkled as she saw the children cautiously reach for the cookies. She asked, \u201cMy! So cute! Big brother, who are these children? Residents?\u201d\u201cThey are under my care,\u201d Davey replied.\u201cYours?\u201d\u201cThey are my daughters.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Winley shook her head in disbelief. \u201cYou are doing something new every time I see you, Big brother. Really\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reason I have to take care of these kids.\u201d\u201cThen, I don\u2019t have anything to say\u2026\u201d Winley was soon distracted by the nervous glances of the children, who were playing with each other in such a cute way. She opened her arms while panting. \u201cH\u2014Hey kids, do you want to come into my arms?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dThere was no way the children would go. Winley couldn\u2019t help but frown as the girls hid inside Davey\u2019s arms.\u201cRed Ribbon and Blue Ribbon, you have to be nice to your sister.\u201d As Davey stroked their heads while smiling, the children hesitantly went to Winley and handed her the cookie they were holding. It was as if they were trying to make Davey happy.\u201cCoookieee\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is for me? Really? Kyak!\u201d\u2018Does she like it so much that she has to scream?\u2019\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cEeh\u2026\u201dUnable to hold back, Winley hugged them and rubbed her cheek against theirs. Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon squirmed with a faint frown on their faces. Winley cooed, \u201cYou guys are so cute! Hey, do you want to follow me home?\u201d\u201cNoo!\u201dThis novel is available on bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cDada!\u201d The children declined Winley\u2019s offer instantly. They were explicitly showing their unhappiness.Davey couldn\u2019t help but sigh at Winley, who was still screaming about how cute the children were despite their refusal. He soon asked Winley while swirling his teacup, which was filled with the black tea that the ladies-in-waiting had served them. \u201cAnyway, how did you come here? I know you\u2019re busy in your territory.\u201d\u201cBig brother, you\u2026 The territory has become pretty quiet now, since the barbarians haven\u2019t been too rowdy recently. Keep up with the news, would you?\u201d\u201cHaha, sorry.\u201d Davey wouldn\u2019t have been this slow if they had exchanged letters or something, but he had been pretty busy.\u201cMy, I was so shocked. I was so worried when you said you were coming to this wasteland\u2026 I never expected your business to succeed so much\u2026 And I also saw dwarves in the village.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting some help from them.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 Aren\u2019t dwarves known for not coming out to the outside world? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a dwarf in my life.\u201dAside from Winley, the people on the territory were also constantly looking at the dwarves as if they were fascinating creatures. They were all taken by surprise. Of course, they\u2019ll get used to it since the dwarves were going to live here for a while.\u201cI would like to host you, but the territory\u2019s current state still isn\u2019t great\u2026 It\u2019s going to take a few more months until everything is settled.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t complain; I\u2019m the one who suddenly came. To be honest with you, the reason I\u2019m here is\u2026\u201d Winley trailed off with a bitter face. Her happiness from before was nowhere to be seen. She now looked worried and solemn about some kind of secret. \u201cBig brother.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Davey replied.\u201cThe power of the stigmata\u2026 Can you use it?\u201d\u201cThe power of the stigmata?\u201d Davey calmly asked.Winley began speaking with mixed feelings. \u201cI know that I shouldn\u2019t ask this of you when you are really busy\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Tell me.\u201dDavey had only been in possession of the stigmata for a short while, since he only got it after waking up from his coma. But he was confident that he could make the impossible possible for his younger sister. \u2018What\u2019s stopping me from helping?\u2019As Davey urged her to speak, Winley brought it up reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Big brother\u2026\u201d\u201cMan, don\u2019t be so hesitant and just tell me. I\u2019ll help you even if it\u2019s impossible.\u201dPerhaps Winley was assured by Davey\u2019s words, because she began weeping in his arms. She let out all of the sorrow that she had been keeping to herself. \u201cBig brother\u2026 Someone I\u2019m fond of is struggling with their life\u2026 Even the priests and doctors have given up\u2026\u201dA weird sensation came over Davey as he heard Winley\u2019s teary voice. He asked, \u201cEven the priests and the doctors gave up?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 So, I thought maybe something could be done with the power of the stigmata\u2026\u201d\u2018This feeling.\u2019\u00a0Davey felt like something serious had happened.30. The Signs of a PlagueWinley, who burst into tears in Davey\u2019s arms, only stopped crying after she was completely exhausted. Comforted by Davey\u2019s presence after being so emotionally distressed for a long time, she eventually collapsed from dehydration and fell asleep, and Davey had no choice but to lay her down.Davey would have to learn about the details some other time. He murmured to himself, \u201cShe\u2019s probably worn out. She must have been struggling with this for a long time\u2026 Leave her be. It seemed like it was a long journey here.\u201dThe Ordem Territory, the territory where Winley and Baris were from, was pretty far from here. She must have been pretty tired if she had traveled here for days without rest. That was probably how much she treasured the person. Davey felt a slight fever as he stroked her forehead while she was asleep.[Restore]Winley looked much more comfortable than before after Davey cast a healing spell with his leftover strength.\u201cHwoo\u2026\u201d\u201cIs Sister sick?\u201dPerhaps Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon instinctively felt that Winley was sick from looking at Winley asleep. They followed Davey in and asked with a frown, like they had already forgotten that they had rejected her affection just a few moments ago.\u201cShe should be fine after a good rest. Let\u2019s leave her be so that she can sleep well, okay?\u201d Davey spoke to the girls.\u201cIt\u2019s not good to be sick. Red Ribbon is going to stay beside her!\u201d Red Ribbon climbed onto the bed and fell asleep while holding Winley close.Blue Ribbon also climbed into the opposite side of the bed carefully, and closed her eyes while hugging Winley.Davey normally wouldn\u2019t have allowed it, but the girls were balls of energy that naturally released spirit power, holy power, or mana. It seemed that their presence would undeniably help Winley regain her strength. He watched Winley sleep, then left the room after Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon completely fell asleep too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDada!\u201d\u201cGiggle!\u201dWinley only got up when it was already late evening. Looking at her with concern, Davey asked, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\u201cOf course, Big brother. Your younger sister is quite healthy.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d\u201cMe! Red Ribbon slept, too!\u201d\u201cBl\u2026 Blue Ribbon, too!\u201dIt was still shocking to hear that swords could sleep.Davey didn\u2019t know what the children were laughing about, but the children ran around the room, giggling joyfully.\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of those children, but\u2026 I feel a lot better than usual.\u201dAside from feeling well rested, Winley\u2019s amount of mana had probably increased too. She was also a mage, so she would\u2019ve absorbed some of the power the two children, who were balls of energy, had released.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Hey kids, do you want to go play outside for a bit?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dAfter the children answered simultaneously and scuttled out of the room, Davey turned to look back at Winley. \u201cAre you okay now?\u201d\u201cYes, thank you for your concern.\u201d\u201cHow long did it take you to travel here? I would\u2019ve gone instead, if you had contacted me.\u201d\u201cH\u2014How could I? You\u2019re busy, too\u2026\u201d Looking like she was going to cry, Winley lowered her head.\u201cOkay. Explain it to me.\u201dWinley nodded with tears in her eyes, and she finally revealed the severity of the situation. \u201cWe first brought priests, but they said that it was an illness incurable with holy power\u2026 So, we called the doctor, and they said that they couldn\u2019t cure it either\u2026\u201d\u201cThey couldn\u2019t cure it?\u201dComforted by Davey\u2019s presence, Winley began sharing her concerns. She revealed that Portna, her bodyguard and close friend, had been shot with a poison arrow by the thieves instead of herself. Because Winley had fallen into a trap after chasing the thieves too far, she would\u2019ve been severely injured or maybe dead if Portna hadn\u2019t taken the shot for her.\u201cWhat about an antidote?\u201d\u201cThe priest did remove the poison with an antidote spell, but blue-black spots began showing up after that\u2026 And she keeps coughing up blood\u2026 Sob\u2026 Weep\u2026\u201dThe real problem only showed up after Portna had returned to the camp after being detoxified. She began suffering from a high fever, and blue-black spots started showing up on her body. From then on, she began coughing up blood and gradually losing a lot of weight.It seemed that the priest who was treating Portna had mentioned that an extremely high-ranking priest with a stigmata might be able to fix her while they were trying to find a way to deal with this disease, which wasn\u2019t treatable with the power of a regular priest or the art of medicine. That was probably what had brought Winley here to the Heins Territory in a hurry.\u201c\u2026\u201d-Davey?Perserque called out in puzzlement, since Davey was just quietly listening to Winley.-Why do you look like that?\u2018Nothing. It\u2019s just that the symptoms are familiar.\u2019When Davey couldn\u2019t think of any words to comfort Winley, who began crying from emotional distress again, all he could do was just silently stroke her vibrant green hair. He murmured, \u201cIt must\u2019ve been hard for you. No one\u2019s perfect from the beginning. Take this mistake to heart and make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\u201cSob\u2026 Weep\u2026 Big brother, what do\u2026 What should I do? Because of me, Portna\u2026 Weep\u2026 Sob!\u201dDavey patted Winley on the back as she sobbed in his arms.The symptoms manifested about two weeks ago. This unknown poison, which first made Portna lethargic, began to continuously harm her even after it had completely left the body after detoxification. It was a disease. Blue-black spots began showing up on her body, she was coughing up blood, and she constantly felt languid. Winley had heard from the priest that this disease couldn\u2019t be treated with holy power, so she had turned to the art of medicine. Unfortunately, even the doctors hadn\u2019t been able to find out just what the disease was.Feeling sorry for Winley as she was falling apart, one of the priests had said that maybe the power of the stigmata could cure Portna. Of course, Davey was the only person with a stigmata that Winley could ask for help from. Like she was grasping at straws, she had come to the Heins Territory straight away without rest, since the only person who had a stigmata she could possibly ask was Davey.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take a look at her,\u201d Davey said.\u201cR\u2014Really?!\u201d Winley did want to hear that Davey was going to treat Portna. It probably pained her so much that the person she was fond of was dying because of her mistake.Davey had no choice but to comfort Winley until she calmed down. Then, he called out, \u201cRoyal Attendant Bernile.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dIn the quiet office, Davey, who was organizing documents that had records of the various matters of the territory, spoke quietly. \u201cThere should be an intelligence guild in the territory. Find the most trustworthy and informative one, and get me the branch leader.\u201d\u201cYour\u2026wish is my command.\u201d Although Bernile could\u2019ve found Davey\u2019s orders to be ridiculous, Bernile just bowed his head silently to carry out his orders.* * *\u2018There\u2019s this thing called intuition. In life, there are times when people suddenly feel a premonition even without any clues or evidence.\u2019\u00a0This thought popped into Davey\u2019s head, because he did get that feeling from the moment he heard Winley\u2019s story.\u201cAh\u2026 I keep feeling like something big is going to happen.\u201d-Don\u2019t you always manage to turn it into a huge gain?\u201cThat is true, but\u2026\u201d Davey answered bitterly and sighed. He calmly rose from his seat. \u201cThe increase in the number of patients isn\u2019t something to be appreciated\u2026 There\u2019s one illness that I know fits the symptoms.\u201d-There\u2019s really\u2026an illness like that?\u201cThe problem is that there\u2019s no way that specific disease would be on this continent.\u201d-Hmm? What does that have to do with getting the intelligence guild?Confused by Davey\u2019s words, Perserque tilted her head.\u201cThere\u2019s something called causality; there\u2019s no such thing as a result without a cause. Portna was shot with a poisonous arrow, and she received an antidote spell, but she became sick the next day. She seems to be suffering from an unknown illness, one that not even the priests and doctors know of\u2026 It makes no sense.\u201dThere was no way that the barbarians, who had to live off of thieving and attacking the outskirts of the kingdom because they didn\u2019t have their own territory, could get their hands on that kind of poison. And it couldn\u2019t be just any ordinary poison if the priests and doctors had given up.-Then, in that case\u2026\u201cSomeone gave the barbarians a poison with a special kind of virus\u2026\u201d Davey, who trailed off, sighed and then continued, \u201cOr there\u2019s a possible cause of the illness that Winley didn\u2019t mention.\u201d\u2018Although, I feel that it\u2019s the first one.\u2019Whatever the illness was, Davey needed to know the cause to discover an appropriate treatment. This was one of the first things he had learned when he had been taught the art of medicine: understanding the overall situation.\u201cCome in if you\u2019re here.\u201d Davey threw the documents that he was reading while standing onto his desk. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to discern me.\u201dIf someone else saw Davey, they wouldn\u2019t know who he was talking to. As he mumbled into the emptiness, a man wearing a black mask soon appeared in front of him with a faint presence. Looking over, Davey thought to himself, \u2018He seems quite skilled.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d The man who silently bowed to Davey was wearing a black uniform and mask. The only body parts that Davey could see were the man\u2019s strong, large hands and sharp eyes.Regular people would probably instinctively freeze up at the man\u2019s hidden killing aura, but Davey wasn\u2019t really tense at all. After all, he wasn\u2019t particularly impressed by the man\u2019s concealment skills.\u201cI heard that there\u2019s something you need,\u201d the man said after a short silence.\u201cYes, I apologize for making you come and go when you\u2019re busy.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s an honor that you have asked for me.\u201d\u201cSit.\u201d Davey offered the man the seat that was in front of him. He sat down, but the man chose to remain standing.The man\u2019s gaze seemed to suggest\u2026nervousness. It was probably inevitable that he felt that way, since Davey had found him right away despite his usage of concealment skills to hide his presence. By nature, assassins were extremely wary of people who could find their location.\u201cI\u2019ll be straightforward with you. I want to buy some information. How much can you offer?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cEverything\u2026\u201d The man answered without an ounce of hesitation. \u201cHas a price.\u201dTheft is never good, try looking at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u2018Of course. Nothing is free.\u2019\u201cThen, you can get me anything if I pay the right price?\u201d\u201cIf you pay appropriately, we can get you information about the underwear color of the kingdom\u2019s princesses. If you want, we can also get you the underwear itself\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk, what would I do with such a dirty thing?\u201d Davey chuckled hollowly at the man\u2019s calm but confident voice. The man did promote his guild\u2019s information gathering ability and drive, but\u2026\u2018What a weird way to express it.\u2019As Davey looked at the man in shock, Perserque crossed her arms and pouted as if displeased. A short silence surrounded the office.A lot of intelligence guilds in the Rowane Kingdom were exceptional, but they were still just minor intelligence guilds of a small kingdom. However, Davey could strongly feel that this man\u2019s guild was a part of something bigger; it seemed like they worked continent-wide.Of course, Davey wasn\u2019t surprised since his territory was getting the spotlight and becoming a site of exchange as several merchant companies, wizard towers, and schools of alchemy were gathering. However, it was inevitable that the shadows grew alongside the light; intelligence guilds were known to sniff out money better than merchants.It was safe to say that Davey\u2019s territory had new information to be discovered every single day, so it wasn\u2019t weird that an intelligence guild that worked on a continental scale had an eye on this place. That pretty much meant that they probably had the ability to get Davey what he wanted fast.Davey could see the man's serious gaze when they made eye contact. The man would\u2019ve heard about him if he wasn\u2019t an idiot, and so, the man probably knew that he wasn\u2019t going to say anything lighthearted. Furthermore, Davey wasn\u2019t a well-known person, but had seen through his concealment skills.Davey kind of felt bad. He could see how tense the man had become, but he still had to ask for what he wanted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThen, what about the ones of the imperial princess of the Pallan Empire? Would it be difficult to get some of hers?\u201d Davey asked the man.\u201c\u2026\u201d-\u2026You pervert.For a second, Davey felt like he heard Perserque genuinely complain in irritation. But still, he thought to himself, \u2018Well, I could be roused if it was a girl as pretty as her.\u2019Although the Pallan Empire\u2019s imperial princess was still quite young, both Davey and her had come of age and were independent adults.Since Davey didn\u2019t bother to make any excuses and simply stared at him, the man silently closed his eyes. His eyelashes quivered. He was trying to figure out the true meaning of Davey\u2019s words: was he serious, or was there a different meaning to his words? After some contemplation, he gave the best answer that he could provide. \u201cI\u2026am fond of my life.\u201d There was a hint of tiredness in his sighing voice.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough for me,\u201d Davey replied calmly and lightly threw a pouch of gold coins toward the man. \u201cIt\u2019s payment in advance.\u201dThe man looked shocked as he caught the unexpectedly heavy pouch of gold coins.\u201cIt\u2019s one hundred and fifty gold coins. There should be a female mage named Portna under Winley, my younger sister. Investigate her recent whereabouts.\u201d\u201cSecretly trail the woman?\u201d The man asked.\u201cCould you say it\u2019s for medical purposes? Do you see me as some kind of perverted stalker?\u201d Davey replied. He felt like the man looked a little less interested in the task.-You\u2019re not a perverted stalker, and yet you mentioned the underwear of the Pallan Empire\u2019s imperial princess?The man in front of Davey couldn\u2019t converse with Perserque, but he also looked suspicious of Davey.\u2018[Check Information]\u2019Beep!-Name: Jack (Aina Helishana).-Age: 124.-Sex: Male (Female).-Species: Human (Dark Elf).-Title: Lethal.-Status Effects: None.-Notes: Possesses assassination skills of entry-level \u2018Master\u2019; leader of fourth division of the Echo Guild, a continent-wide intelligence guild; known as Jack in the guild.-Current Emotion: Confusion.\u2018Hm? She was a woman? And a dark elf?\u2019\u00a0Davey stared at the man after reading his information. He noticed that the man didn\u2019t have particularly dark skin or long ears.-Dark elves don\u2019t have dark skin in the first place. They are just different types of elves and they look the same, just like how mages and dark mages don\u2019t look different from each other.\u2018It might get ugly if we provoke her too much.\u2019-And are you one to be troubled by that?\u2018Of course, not.\u2019\u00a0Davey chuckled secretly and went on. He asked the dark elf, \u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t take the payment.\u201d After some careful consideration, the dark elf quietly handed back the pouch of money to Davey.\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cI won\u2019t take the money.\u201d The dark elf replied.\u201cYou\u2019re going to do it for free?\u201d\u201cNot that, either.\u201d The dark elf calmly answered and lowered her head. \u201cI will\u2026calculate the payment afterwards.\u201d\u201cWhat if I rip you off?\u201d With a chuckle, Davey lowered his head further.\u201cThis is my proposal since, although you seem to be more perverted than I thought, you don\u2019t seem like the kind of person to not keep a promise. You are not cheap, and you have integrity.\u201dThe dark elf wanted to see how Davey would act, then build a friendly relationship with him if he was to her liking.The probing was a little disrespectful, but it didn\u2019t feel terrible. Davey was just a bit surprised that she was a dark elf, but it probably wasn\u2019t anything too extraordinary since she could even change her sex. She seemed to have a sturdy, muscular figure, but that was actually fake. As Davey used his power to glance into the darkness for a bit longer, he began to see an image of a thin and short girl. \u2018No wonder. This was the power from a piece of the will of God.\u2019\u201cIs that your organization\u2019s offer?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cNo, my personal one,\u201d the dark elf answered.\u201cSure. Do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cOkay, then\u2026\u201d The dark elf bowed her head for a short goodbye, then disappeared into the air.\u201cYou\u2019re going to focus more on your concealment abilities? What a sense of pride you have.\u201dAs he chuckled, Davey thought about the information that he had read about her. \u2018She\u2019s a dark elf and had also hidden her sex\u2026 And isn\u2019t the Echo Guild one of the most famous guilds in the continent?\u2019-It is not only merchants who can quickly notice a cash cow. Besides\u2026Perserque trailed off and quietly asked.-Do you know anything about the family name, \u2018Helishana\u2019?\u201cHelishana?\u201d-You don\u2019t know?\u201cIt\u2019s the dark elf\u2019s family name, right? Is there something about her?\u201dPerserque smiled softly and shook her head.-It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t know. Forget about it.\u201cWhat a bummer.\u201dTheir conversation didn\u2019t go on for long.* * *Winley must have been tired from traveling for a long time, but she followed Davey as if she couldn\u2019t wait even a moment longer. However, she didn\u2019t have enough strength to endure another long journey since she had come all the way here without rest. As if she had fought in a battlefield while being emotionally drained, Winley was currently a mage who lacked strength.\u201cI know your physical condition the best. Stay here,\u201d Davey told Winley.\u201cNo! I\u2019m going with you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn.\u201d Davey sounded serious, but Winley refused to budge.\u2018I wonder if she knows how bad of a physical state she is in right now.\u2019Horseback riding was quite a physically draining activity. Davey wondered what Baris was doing in a situation like this, but he thought that Baris must have his reasons, since Baris cherished his twin sister more than anything in the world. Baris just didn\u2019t act like it.\u201cWe have to travel for days to get to the Orden Territory. A carriage will slow us down, and from the symptoms you have described, we don\u2019t have that kind of time. You might even slow us down.\u201d Davey intentionally criticized Winley so that she would change her mind, but she kept saying that she could travel by horse in a teary voice.-I don\u2019t know why you are so weak against that sister of yours.\u201cBig brother, I can go! I\u2019m not weak!\u201dTechnically, Winley could; traveling wouldn\u2019t be a problem since she could just hold onto her consciousness with her mental strength. However, Davey just didn\u2019t want her to do that.Wondering about how to solve this problem, an unexpected solution simply presented itself.* * *\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Yulis, a class-5 \u2018Master\u2019. I am humbly a part of the Red Tower.\u201dMages usually excluded their gender, but included their class and proficiency when introducing themselves.\u2018Class-5 \u2018Master\u2019.\u2019People who took the oath of mana found faking their classes very distasteful, so the red-haired mage who appeared to be in his twenties in front of Davey was almost a 5-circle \u2018Master\u2019-level mage. A 5-circle mage; considering this mage\u2019s age and that his skills were almost that of an entry-level \u2018Master\u2019, he had reached an incredible level. After all, it required an exceptional amount of effort and talent that went beyond the level of a \u2018Swordmaster\u2019.If swordsmanship trained the physical body, then magic strengthened the mind. Unlike the few people who became masters in their forties and fifties after devoting their entire life to magic, this mage was already at the entry level of \u2018Master\u2019 before the age of thirty, and was working his way up to the higher levels. Davey was a special case, since his standard of time was a little different.\u201cI am Davey O\u2019Rowane. I have heard great things about you, Class-5 Yulis. It\u2019s an honor to have someone as respected as you to come to this shabby territory.\u201dIt can be hard to make great work when its stolen from bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u2018Heard things about him? I don\u2019t even care about him. And I have no reason to converse with him.\u2019Regardless of his continental fame, Yulis was from the Central Tower in the central continent. Any involvement with him would only result in trouble.\u201cShabby? Nonsense. This territory is the shining star of the eastern continent right now. And I\u2019ve wanted to meet you since Princess Winley had spoken so highly of you,\u201d Yulis said with a smile, showing no hint of sarcasm. Looking at his impression, he was a righteous young man who might be a little too hardworking.However, Davey had already classified Yulis as a highly dangerous individual. \u2018He\u2019s dangerous!\u2019-You shouldn\u2019t be so quick to judge. Is there a reason for you to be so wary of him just because he traveled with your younger sister?\u2018Of course there is. That\u2019s a good enough reason. How dare he touch her with his dirty hand?\u2019Aside from being kind-hearted, Yulis was also a genius that even the wizard towers acknowledged. On top of that, he was from a good family. There was nothing second-rate about Class-5 Yulis, including his status, wealth, personality, looks, and abilities; he was the golden boy. Furthermore, becoming a \u2018Master\u2019 at such a young age held more merit than one would imagine.\u2018Man, you\u2019re tall, too.\u2019The problem was why Yulis was involved with Winley, so Davey simply asked, \u201cBut how does someone like you, Class-5 Yulis, know my sister?\u201d He squinted suspiciously.Winley nudged Davey in shock. She exclaimed, \u201cB\u2014Big brother!\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s alright. I would also be wary in such a situation. I was actually on the way to the Heins Territory to take care of business, but then I ran into Princess Winley, and we happened to travel here together,\u201d Yulis explained.Blushing, Winley lowered head.\u2018People say there\u2019s no use in working hard to raise a daughter. Ah, I can\u2019t do it. Let\u2019s get rid of him right now.\u2019-You have to be patient. And besides, Winley isn\u2019t even your daughter!If Perserque didn\u2019t shout and hold back his arms with an invisible power, Davey would have swung his sword. \u2018Phew\u2026\u2019\u00a0Davey bitterly smiled as he made his sword disappear without Yulis noticing.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I should thank you for helping my sister,\u201d Davey said.\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Princess Winley was actually the one who helped me,\u201d Yulis replied. It seemed that Winley had used her magic to chase away the fearless bandits whom Yulis had encountered on the way here. He added, \u201cSo, I came to see you. I was wondering how to repay you.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Yes.\u201d Davey nodded.\u201cAlthough I am lacking, I think I may be able to help you. I am familiar with spatial magic, other than flame magic.\u201d\u201cTe\u2014Teleportation magic!\u201d As Winley exclaimed in surprise, Davey secretly let out a gasp. Mages usually studied one subject of magic for their entire lives; it wasn\u2019t because they were interested in that one subject, but because life was too short for them to learn other types.\u201cI happen to have a small mana gate with me. I was going to use it to move some essential products,\u201d Yulis revealed.\u201cA\u2014A small mana gate!\u201dDavey stared at Winley who shouted in shock. He asked, \u201cIs that something great?\u201d\u201cB\u2014Big brother, of course! Unlike installation-type large mana gates, small mana gates are extremely luxurious artifacts. They are rare even among the mages of the wizard towers!\u201d Winley explained.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is a secret treasure of the continent, so only mages who are knowledgeable in spatial theory above the class-5 level and those who possess mana similar to the High Wizard could have it. I never expected someone like that to be at the Red Tower,\u201d Winley said.Apparently, Yulis had been on his way to get the wizard tower\u2019s important supply himself to prevent it from getting damaged in the process. And since Winley was also a mage, she had lots of curiosity and an eagerness for knowledge.Davey decided to hold off on getting rid of Yulis for now. A mana gate would allow them to move without a lot of strain. In addition, Winley was still a mage, so she wouldn\u2019t react adversely to the teleportation magic even if she wasn\u2019t a spatial-related mage. It was difficult for Davey to use a long-distance teleportation spell since it could only be done above the 6-circle level.Davey nodded gratefully. \u201cThen, I owe you.\u201dAs Davey smiled and offered a handshake, Yulis laughed and grabbed his hand. But Yulis turned slightly pale when he felt Davey\u2019s firm grip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tzzz!!\u00a0With an enormous spark, a light appeared above the territory\u2019s town square. Then, the surroundings changed once the light went away.This was the Ordem Territory. It was rather far from the Heins, and it was a region where tribes of the Thieves\u2019 Guild, who looted plains and forests without settling anywhere, began operating. It had metal mines and large amounts of farmland, so it was also the family land of a venerable count. Although the territory was currently unstable due to the Thieves\u2019 Guild turning the place upside down, it didn\u2019t change the fact that it was quite a big and developed territory. Of course, the atmosphere was more depressing than what Davey had expected.\u201cHaha\u2026 It\u2019s not pretty, is it, Big brother?\u201d Winley said.\u201cWas there another attack?\u201d Davey asked. He smelled the nasty scent of burning flesh once he amplified his senses. This odor of protein burning away was very similar to that of burnt human flesh.The territory looked normal and quiet, but it had a strange gloominess. Looking around, Davey was starting to feel grateful that Baris and Winley had grown up so bright despite being in this kind of an atmosphere.Winley frowned slightly. \u201cThis makes no sense\u2026 There shouldn\u2019t be an attack from the Thieves\u2019 Guild for a while\u2026\u201d Thinking that something had happened again in the territory, which had burning corpses, Winley mumbled in confusion. She thought that another incident where a large number of people had to be cremated had taken place.\u201cUnless these people died of an internal conflict, there\u2019s only one thing that could\u2019ve caused a mass burning.\u201d With a cold gaze, Davey pointed to a group of people who were dressed in red cloth and red armor.Looking at the red armored men who were using wagons to move the corpses of the residents, Winley widened her eyes. \u201cW\u2014What is this\u2026\u201d Her voice quavered, because she didn\u2019t understand what exactly was going on.\u201cMy, my, isn\u2019t this Princess Winley? You\u2019ve returned.\u201d A man wearing a monocle emerged from among the knights and bowed to Winley. He wore a kind smile, but it looked odd for some reason. \u201cMy name is Count Lington. I was dispatched here from the Coalition for Disease Control\u2026 You are more beautiful than what I have heard. It seems that rumors don\u2019t do you justice at all.\u201d\u201cMy apologies, but there is an important matter at hand. I think we may have to converse later.\u201d\u201cHaha, I would like to as well, but the current situation is quite unfortunate.\u201d Lington smiled awkwardly but still seemed friendly. His outward appearance was like an old-fashioned scholar. \u201cFirst\u2026 I apologize for coming to the territory without notifying you, and for allowing the knights to roam freely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLington squinted at Winley, who stayed silent with a complicated look on her face. He then said, \u201cFirst, come in. We have just finished quarantining the royal palace that you will reside in with a magic artifact from the Holy Empire.\u201d His words made Winley frown.* * *Baris wasn\u2019t at the territory; it seemed that he was absent for whatever reason, meaning that the armored men were occupying the seigneur\u2019s castle when he wasn\u2019t present. This was quite a shitty situation, but there was a separate reason as to why Winley couldn\u2019t formally complain any further.\u201cSigh\u2026 I know that the situation may be uncomfortable, but please try to understand. Please have some tea. This is a tea brewed from beneficial herbs,\u201d Lington offered.\u201c\u2026To my knowledge, I don\u2019t think I handed over the authority of the seigneur to you, Count Lington,\u201d Winley replied.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d\u201cBaris is the seigneur of the Ordem Territory. However, those rights belong to me when he is absent.\u201d Winley looked displeased as she expressed her thoughts.\u201cI am aware. I know that it is brazen of us to come here and request for whatever we want.\u201d This was honestly no different from a robber acting as the owner of the house when the actual owner had come back. But Lington was unperturbed. \u201cHowever, as I told you before, we are from the Coalition of Disease Control.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Davey had heard about the Coalition of Disease Control before. They were a multinational organization that had special rights, since they had been acknowledged with the seals of the three empires\u2019 emperors who had conquered the continent.\u201cIt is true that the Coalition of Disease Control\u2019s main purpose is to provide free medical attention all around the continent. It is an organization founded by the three wise emperors with good intentions.\u201d\u201cI have heard of it, yes. However, what are the people of the coalition doing here in the territory?\u201d Winley asked. Davey could tell that she couldn\u2019t shake away her anxiety.-How can you know without using [Check Information]?\u2018Winley has a habit of grasping her skirt with her right hand whenever she\u2019s anxious.\u2019-Your love for your younger sister is almost like a disease.\u2018Why do you care that I cherish my sister this much? She is so cute.\u2019Winley was clearly prettier than most nobles, who were already known to mostly be quite good-looking. Her big, round eyes and cute facial features caught the attention of many sons of the nobility in the Rowane Kingdom. Rumor had it that she had rejected the marriage proposal of a foreign prince who had fallen in love with her at first sight when he had visited the kingdom for an international visit. But Davey didn\u2019t know for what reason she had declined.-Tsk tsk.Perserque stared at Davey pathetically as he explained, but he ignored her to pay attention to Count Lington.\u201cAs you know, Your Highness, there is a wicked disease going around in the territory. The coalition is currently calling the disease, \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019.\u201d\u201cThe\u2026 \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019.\u201d\u201cYes. This nasty disease causes blue-black spots to appear on the affected and makes them cough up blood. It is fatal. This wicked illness is also known to be extremely contagious.\u201dLife drained out of Winley\u2019s face, because Lington had mentioned symptoms that were the same as what Portna was experiencing. Winey hurriedly cried for help with teary eyes, \u201cN\u2014Now is not the time! Big brother! We have to hurry for Portna!\u201d\u201cMy, I have yet to greet Prince Davey. I have wanted to meet you ever since hearing about you. I heard that you have received a stigmata and that you have successfully harvested moon grass in your territory.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fortunate that the conditions are favorable.\u201dLington laughed exaggeratedly. \u201cThere is no result without a cause. It is probably because you are so extraordinary, Your Highness. Haha, I see that the shining individuals of our continent are gathered here.\u201d\u201cMy apologies, Count Lington, but I must leave. I have an urgent matter to take care of. Lindy!\u201d Winley quickly shouted for Lindy, who was her lady-in-waiting, but Lindy didn\u2019t show up at all.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the servants of the seigneur\u2019s palace and the knights are all under quarantine right now,\u201d Lington explained.\u201cWhat?\u201d Infuriated, Winley glared at Lington.Lington answered while wiping the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable. The \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019 is a highly contagious disease. It can be avoided if managed well, but it becomes uncontrollable if a single infected person roams free. Please understand.\u201dNot knowing what to do, Winley stared at Lington who bowed his head with a pale face. \u201cB\u2014But this is clearly an overreach of power\u2026\u201d\u201cI am aware. It is also true that we are shameless. However, Your Highness, I hope you understand that we acted according to the agreement of the Alliance of Nations. There were precedents set in the past for us to be given the authority of the territory in emergency situations,\u201d Lington explained. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, this disease is incurable, regardless of the level of holy power. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t\u2026be\u2026\u201d\u201cThat is why we have stepped up, so please leave it to us. We will make sure to carry out an effective treatment method and give you good news.\u201d Lington\u2019s words were like a false commitment of good will.* * *There was nothing Davey could check for himself even if he spoke to Lington, because he had to go and see it for himself. He walked into the treatment center with an adequate excuse, quickly picking up the foul odor that blew toward him.Groan\u2026\u201cIt\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201dThe center looked horrid. There were gruesome moans and groans of pain. There were also the bodies of residents who had already died from the disease. Portna, who was Winley\u2019s knight, had been the only one suffering from the unknown disease at first. But numerous residents began suffering from the same thing in a matter of days. The red armored knights were loading the bodies onto a wagon and continuously burning them.-The smell of burning corpses is sickening. My head aches.\u2018Me too.\u2019\u00a0Davey calmly walked into the center. Normally, this wouldn\u2019t have been allowed, but he had come because he knew how to use holy magic and because Winley had pleaded so desperately.The treatment center was a confined space made by layering several pieces of fabric. Here, people were treating quarantined patients who all had different symptoms.\u2018No, instead of treatment\u2026 This is more like quarantining to prevent the worst-case scenario.\u2019The solution was horrendous, but also realistic in a way.-\u2026Perserque covered her mouth and looked around in shock.-I\u2019ve never seen a disease this terrible in my lifetime\u2026\u201cThis disease shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d-What are you saying? And there\u2019s a weird smell wafting through the air.As Perserque mumbled, Davey walked into the special quarantining space where Portna was. Immediately, the strange odor intensified and assailed his sense of smell.-Ugh\u2026Unlike Perserque, who immediately frowned, Davey calmly and somewhat stiffly went inside to see a woman who was tied to her bed. The woman was Portna, the escort knight whom Winley pleaded for Davey to save. Looking at the corpse-like woman, Davey said, \u201cIt smells like Blue Death Blossom.\u201d-Blue\u2026 What?\u201cBlue Death Blossom. It\u2019s probably called the Tostart flower here.\u201d-I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201cIt\u2019s a rare flower that grows in extreme conditions. It\u2019s difficult to see now.\u201d The smell was strangely unpleasant, but was also strangely addictive. Taking it in, Davey continued to explain, \u201cThe Tostart flower is extremely poisonous.\u201dA drop of the flower\u2019s essence was enough to kill hundreds of people. It was a flower loved by assassins, but it couldn\u2019t be used if it was this difficult to obtain or harvest despite its high effectiveness.Davey approached Portna silently and put his hand on her wrist to feel her pulse. Thud\u2026 Thud Thud\u2026 Thud thud thud. Thud\u2026 He could feel a weak pulse through his fingertips. Then, he released his mana to surround Portna to see through her. Since he didn\u2019t have some high-tech equipment like a CT or an MRI available, he had no choice but to check her by using mana. This required an extremely delicate control of mana, but Davey was someone who had learned everything from Odin, the God of Mages.Portna was so pale that she almost looked dead, but her prominent pulse indicated otherwise. She was said to have been exposed to the disease far sooner than the residents, but she was still alive when others were already dying.\u201c39.7 degrees Celsius. Her brain cells are going to cook,\u201d Davey commented. Portna\u2019s skin was as cold as a corpse, but her organs were extremely hot; her state was completely out of balance, and it was almost miraculous that she was still alive.The disease had horrendous symptoms, outcomes, and deaths. Davey had expected this when he first heard it from Winley, but he couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the complicated situation. \u2018If Portna was a normal human, she would\u2019ve already died by the time I got here.\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t understand. There\u2019s no way this disease exists in this world\u2026\u201d-What do you mean? Tell me, too.\u201cThis disease was rampant in a different world. Since it\u2019s a virus that was made in special circumstances, it\u2019s not something like a cold, cancer, leukemia, or like the Black Plague.\u201dThis was certainly a virus made from gene modification, meaning that this disease wasn\u2019t natural. One could even call it a bioterror attack.\u2018Even the people who made this virus died because of it.\u2019A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.-It was made?\u201cMelting Acceleration Virus.\u201d-M\u2014Melting\u2026 What?\u201cMelting Acceleration Virus. The method that the virus kills its host is wicked, but it is also quite contagious. It has a history of killing millions of people with one outbreak in a short amount of time. And\u2026\u201d Davey closed his eyes. \u201cIt took ten years to develop a cure for it. Two hundred million eight thousand people died before the cure was developed, and eighteen thousand people were saved from it. I think we\u2019re going to have to make an antibody fast.\u201dDavey quickly grabbed a knife, tube, and a glass test tube that was nearby. He put holy power into the knife. \u2018It\u2019s important to disinfect.\u2019That was when\u2026\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Someone\u2019s wary voice stopped Davey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Participating in the Frontline of Medicine!\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d It was an angry shout that was both formal and cold. The person who shouted also grabbed Davey\u2019s knife-wielding hand. \u201cI asked what you are doing to a dying patient.\u201dThe man who stopped Davey was wearing a red uniform. He looked quite meticulous and picky. He also had his nose and mouth covered with a red cloth, so he wondered why Davey was here without any kind of protection. With a harsh tone, he asked again, \u201cThis is a restricted area that\u2019s for authorized personnel only. Who are you, and why are you in here?\u201dDavey pulled out a small token from his chest. Showing the status of royalty during such a situation would be quite helpful. \u201cI am Davey O\u2019Rowane, the First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom.\u201d\u201cAhem\u2026 My apologies. I am Baron Gorneo. Although I am still lacking, I am a member of the Coalition of Disease Control.\u201dAs Davey examined the man\u2019s uniform, he could see that the man was wearing the same red uniform as Count Lington and had a brooch with a strange symbol. \u201cI see.\u201d\u201cHowever, I cannot let you in here even if you are a prince. I\u2019m sorry, but you must leave!\u201d Gorneo shouted.Seeing his unwavering attitude, Davey put down his knife and asked, \u201cAm I not allowed to be here?\u201d\u201cThe disease that has spread in this territory is transmitted through the air under special circumstances\u2026 Oh no! Use this to cover your nose and mouth! Hurry!\u201d Realizing that Davey didn\u2019t have anything covering his face, Gorneo quickly pulled out a piece of cloth. He pushed Davey out. \u201cThere is a low chance of catching the disease outside, but there are several infected patients here! Hurry!\u201dWhen Davey silently accepted the cloth, Gorneo yelled with urgency, \u201cI heard that you came to this territory because of this outbreak, Your Highness! I heard that you have a stigmata; however, this can\u2019t be cured, even with the power of the stigmata!\u201dDavey stopped Gorneo as he spoke firmly. \u201cDid you check that it couldn\u2019t be cured?\u201d\u201cNo, not really, since it is difficult to encounter anyone with a stigmata. However, a High Priest with a similar level of holy power has told us that, so\u2026\u201d\u201cAghhhh!!!\u201dThat was when Davey and Gorneo heard a desperate cry of help. As they both hurried over, they saw a man screaming and struggling while tied to his bed.\u201cDamn it!!\u201d Baron Gorneo immediately ran over to the patient to do an examination. It seemed like he had completely forgotten about keeping Davey out. He then yelled, \u201cSince when was he like this?!\u201d\u201cTh\u2014That is\u2026\u201d\u201cGet me a painkiller! Calm him down first!!\u201dDavey ignored the fact that Gorneo was treating the patient with both urgency and determination. He simply stared at the patient.-It\u2019s horrible\u2026\u201cBlood foam, pus from the eyes that resemble bloody tears, and the spots on his body are moving around irregularly.\u201d-Davey?Perserque called upon Davey with her eyes open wide as she heard him murmur.Davey boldly stopped the person who was bringing the tube and the medicine.\u201cWh\u2026 What are you\u2026\u201d\u201cThat patient is going to die if you give that to him right now,\u201d Davey said.\u201cPardon\u2026 Pardon?!\u201d\u201cGive me the tube.\u201d Davey snatched the sterilized tube away and promptly walked toward the screaming patient. Then, he covered the screaming man\u2019s mouth and wiped away all the bloody foam that was spewing out of the man\u2019s mouth. It was dangerous, since his finger could very well be bitten off, but his body was durable enough to withstand the bite of a human.\u201cH\u2014Hey, what are you\u2026?!\u201d Gorneo, surprised by Davey\u2019s sudden intrusion, was about to shout when Davey ripped off the patient\u2019s top. Then, Gorneo\u2019s eyes flew wide open in surprise.\u2018I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing when they\u2019ve got an emergency patient. Time is of the essence. There are two lumps\u2026 No, another one is forming.\u2019\u00a0Davey squinted at the presence of the air bubbles. He could tell that a clot of the virus-infected blood was building up in the man\u2019s lungs. The patient was surely going to die if it wasn\u2019t extracted immediately.\u2018Eight millimeters from the bottom, and three millimeters from the right. This human is going to die if I\u2019m even a little bit off.\u2019\u00a0Taking a breath, Davey felt the area with his fingertips and concentrated. He touched the patient\u2019s ribs with two fingers and then courageously raised the tube with a sharp end. Ching!\u00a0A faint light began emitting from his hands as he held onto the patient and the tube.[Pain Alleviation][Holy Coating]Whoosh\u2026 Holy magic was just a different type of magic, but casting two spells simultaneously was pretty difficult. The two holy magic spells began activating, then Davey pierced the sharp tube past the patient\u2019s ribs and into his lungs. Stab! Davey expected the patient to squirm in pain, but the man only screamed and spewed even more bloody foam. He was struggling to breathe properly.\u2018A little more!\u2019\u00a0Davey, who was moving his fingertips along the tube that he pushed slowly and precisely, pierced the tube in much more boldly.Shocked by Davey\u2019s actions, Gorneo came at him and grabbed him by the collar. Davey didn\u2019t even have the time to take his hands off the tube. \u201cYou!! What are you doing with this human\u2019s life?!...\u201dDavey could feel Gorneo\u2019s intense fury in his voice. It probably wasn\u2019t because someone was doing his work, but because Davey was being reckless with a patient. To someone else, Davey\u2019s actions carried a stronger intention to kill than to save.All Davey did when Gorneo shouted in anger was to point at the patient with his chin. \u201cSay someth\u2026\u201dDavey\u2019s actions only infuriated Gorneo even more. He looked like he was going to hit Davey, not caring that Davey was a prince. But he soon froze as he turned his glance over to where Davey was pointing at.\u201cCough\u2026 Cough\u2026\u201d Before, the patient was in so much pain that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Now, he actually calmed down and was only coughing a little. Squirt\u2026 A blue-black liquid quickly came flowing into the tube that Davey had inserted.\u2018He\u2019s going to have trouble breathing again if it doesn\u2019t drain for a while.\u2019\u201cGive that to me.\u201d Davey brushed off Gorneo, who was stunned into stillness. He took a test tube from the nearby doctor. He poured the liquid from the patient into the test tube without hesitation and closed the lid.\u201cStop the bleeding and then stitch him up. Just so you know, the patient will die of shock if you give them painkillers within 24 hours of those symptoms showing up, so don\u2019t. And,\u201d Davey said rather unwillingly, then stared at the surprised Gorneo. \u201cSomeone with a stigmata is immune to almost everything.\u201d\u2018The power of God isn\u2019t nothing.\u2019Ignoring the dumbfounded stares all around him, Davey took the test tube with the blue-black liquid and left. The people inside the treatment center were frozen in place until he left.* * *Putting the incident at the treatment center behind him, Davey returned to the seigneur\u2019s palace to see Winley, who was probably devastated.\u201cOh, Big brother!\u201d As soon as Davey entered the room, Winley, who was holding her face with a teary frown, stood up with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d Beside her was Yulis, who had a soft smile on his face.It definitely seemed like Winley was hiding something as she was flustered and red. She asked, \u201cB\u2014Big brother, did you\u2026hear?\u201dIt can be hard to make great work when its stolen from bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cHear what?\u201d\u201cN\u2014Nothing!!\u201d Jumping at Davey\u2019s question, Winley vigorously shook her head.Davey glanced over at Yulis, since he could sense the strange atmosphere in the room.Yulis said nothing and just smiled, while Winley blushed and seemed to not know what to do. Yulis was also considered to be the best person for marriage\u2026 A girl of Winley\u2019s age was bound to have some interest in a person who looked like that, and since Winley was a girl\u2026\u2018There\u2019s no use in raising a daughter!!\u2019-She is not your daughter!Davey chose not to hear Perserque\u2019s shouting.\u201cI got some information about a few things. There are two people from the Coalition of Disease Control here: Count Lington and Baron Gorneo. Ah, their titles were from their past. They are members of the coalition,\u201d Yulis explained.\u201cMembers?\u201d Winley, who was staring at her herbal tea with tired eyes, looked at Yulis in puzzlement.\u201cYes, I should first tell you about the Coalition of Disease Control. Would that be okay?\u201d\u201cI was just wondering the same thing.\u201d\u201cAhaha. It\u2019s a good thing I found something.\u201d Yulis laughed and put his quill on paper. Then, he drew a pyramid of circles: one on top, three below that, and then fifteen below those. He continued, \u201cFirst, this is the hierarchy of the Coalition of Disease Control. It\u2019s probably best that I explain the big picture.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cYou all know that the Coalition of Disease Control is an organization founded by the three emperors for treatment purposes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my impression of it.\u201d Davey nodded. No matter what it was, the Coalition of Disease Control was still the largest official medical organization of the continent.\u201cIn terms of hierarchy, there is one leader, three chairmen, and fifteen council members. There are numerous knights and people related to medicine, but these people are the important ones.\u201d\u201cAre the three chairmen the three emperors?\u201d\u201cYou are quick. And the leader is none other than His Excellency, the Pope of the Valchas Empire. I heard that he participated in this good cause to support it.\u201dExternal trauma could easily be fixed with a recovery spell, but diseases were complicated. Therefore, the coalition\u2019s purpose was quite transparent and easy to understand.\u201cAnd there are fifteen council members below them. Most of the members have great accomplishments or are skilled enough in the art of medicine to have been acknowledged. However, all their personal information has been erased to prevent them from carrying out any personal business.\u201dThese people had erased everything about them for one cause\u2026\u2018I can practically see that they are crazy.\u2019\u201cThere are two council members on the continent right now: Count Lington and Baron Gorneo. Well, the ranks are just titles since they hold no meaning now.\u201d Yulis slurred the end of his words and smiled bitterly. \u201cThe important thing is that they have been given the power of not only the three emperors, but the Alliance of Nations. Count Lington\u2019s words are actually valid.\u201dThis meant that the actions the men had taken to stop the outbreak of the disease in this territory were justified. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that they were allowed to kill all the residents recklessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If we were to protest against this, not only would we be making enemies with the three empires, but it could be considered treason against our kingdom and the countries in the alliance,\u201d Yulis explained. Simply put, he was saying that the repercussions would be like an atomic explosion if they were to rub the coalition the wrong way.\u201cBut the residents are afraid,\u201d Winley pointed out.\u201cWell, it hasn\u2019t been long since they\u2019ve arrived here. All we can do right now is wait\u2026 Prince Davey?\u201d Yulis called upon Davey, who kept silent.\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Davey snapped out of his thoughts and nodded.Yulis chuckled. \u201cAnd the order protecting the place is the Knights of Destruction, and I have heard that the captain dispatched here is Count Collio.\u201d\u201cCount Collio? Um\u2026 From the Lyndis Empire, the most powerful empire in the eastern continent\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, he is one of the royal knightage\u2019s captains. I heard that he retired a few years ago, but it seems that he\u2019s here.\u201d Yulis added with a sigh, \u201cWell\u2026 It doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea to leave it to them for now\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad decision to leave it to the coalition, since they were the continent\u2019s best medical organization. However, it seemed like Davey\u2019s worries weren\u2019t going away.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have brought the two of you here if I knew how dangerous it was\u2026\u201d Winley blamed herself. When Davey just hugged her and patted her on the back, she murmured, \u201cBro\u2026ther?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Comforted by Davey\u2019s voice, Winley gradually stopped trembling.At least they had gotten off on the right foot. What they planned to do from now on was more important, and it was meaningless to dwell on what had happened.Davey was determined to keep his promise; Winley was his precious younger sister who brought him joy and laughter, after all. Then, turning to Yulis, Davey said, \u201cAnyways, never mind me, but we caused a huge inconvenience to you, Class-5 Yulis.\u201dYulis shook his head and laughed. \u201cNo, not at all. I forgot to tell you, but Portna is part of the Red Tower.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Yes.\u201d\u201cSince one of the mages of the Red Tower is severely ill, I must stay and monitor the situation as an elder.\u201dIt looked to Davey that Yulis was being genuine since he was someone of a virtuous character. In fact, it said that Yulis truly did want to help when he checked with [Check Information].\u2018But why does it look like he has another reason?\u2019-Don\u2019t blindly trust the power of [Check Information].The power couldn\u2019t be perfect even if the authority was a fragment of the power of God.* * *-Why didn\u2019t you stay there and treat people?\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have helped even if I was there.\u201dWhen she heard Davey\u2019s aloof answer, Perserque tilted her head in confusion. She wondered why he left without any hesitation when he had seen the patients and knew what the disease was.-And all you did was take some weird pus.\u201cThis is key.\u201d Davey smiled bitterly as he lightly shook the liquid in the test tube. \u201cI told you that it\u2019s a virus. We can treat the disease right away by finding the cause.\u201d-But if we do that\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s a fifty-fifty chance: you either get to live or you die on the spot. Acupuncture could also work, but only for certain cases.\u201d To Davey, it made no sense to make such a rash and extreme decision. He continued, \u201cIf the coalition is at least suppressing the number of dying residents as best as they can, I have to find a cure when I have the time right now.\u201dWhat Davey was trying to do was simple: to make an antivirus or an antibody. This disease didn\u2019t exist in this world, but it was strong enough to remain and wreck the human body, so Davey\u2019s method was the only way to find a cure. Hypocria, the Goddess of Medicine who previously cured this disease, had said that she had to watch numerous people die while she developed an antibody.The process of developing a cure for a nasty disease was incredibly arduous. Candidly put, the history of medicine was stained with blood; as such, it was crucial for those who practiced medicine to learn the importance of life while learning the art of medicine. Even Davey, who hadn\u2019t personally experienced the bloodstained history did understand the magnitude of life.-An antibody\u2026\u201cWhen something bad enters the human body, the human body secretes something to destroy it. And it remembers the information of the intruder and makes an antibody for it.\u201dPerserque nodded in understanding.Antigens and antibodies; the human body was truly fascinating.-It\u2019s common in the medical field, right?The Coalition of Disease Control probably tried several different ways to create an antibody as well. Of course, they most likely didn\u2019t succeed since the method to create this antibody was completely beyond common knowledge.-But\u2026how are you going to make an antibody with just that?Davey was just staring at the tube, but he suddenly raised his head. \u201cCome in if you\u2019ve arrived. Don\u2019t just stand there.\u201d There was no one other than Davey and Perserque, who was floating, in the room, but his words were clearly for someone else.Shshshsh\u2026 Just then, a presence could be felt. The empty space began distorting, and someone started appearing in the air.\u201c\u2026\u201dDavey could only see the eyes of the man in the black uniform and mask, just like before. The man looked slightly shocked, his emotions showing through his eyes. It seemed like Jack had tried to hide as best as he could, but Davey\u2019s skills as an assassin were probably more than ten times better than Jack\u2019s; honing a craft for close to a thousand years was nearly impossible for ordinary people. Time was probably the most valuable resource that the heroes who couldn\u2019t reach the end in their lifetime could have in the Hall.\u201cYou found me again,\u201d Jack said.\u201cI found you because I can see you,\u201d Davey replied.\u201cThat makes\u2026\u201d\u201cSense.\u201d\u2018You should look at who you\u2019re talking to before teaching a fish how to swim.\u2019Although Davey\u2019s physical body wasn\u2019t that experienced yet, his inner self was another story altogether.Davey cut Jack off and glanced over in irritation.Then, Jack approached slowly. \u201cThis is the information you were looking for.\u201d\u201cGood work. And are you going to receive the compensation?\u201d\u201cNot yet. And take this as well.\u201d Jack calmly handed Davey a capsule that contained two different piles of documents. Well, Jack was actually Aina Helishana, the dark elf.\u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cI brought it because I thought that it would be useful.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to get fired if you keep doing this kind of charity work.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We calculate everything.\u201dOffering the extra documents wasn\u2019t the intention of the Echo Guild, the enormous intelligence guild, but of Jack\u2019s own accord.Since Jack was offering them, Davey accepted the documents. He went on to read and squint at the documents. \u201cHm\u2026 Are you sure this is accurate?\u201dJack silently nodded. The information was probably true since anybody who sold information as their livelihood had to be known as reliable.\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask for one more thing.\u201dWhen Jack quietly nodded, Davey made his request. \u201cI need large quantities of the products listed here. Put it under the name\u2026 Coalition of Disease Control.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cWhat would be wrong with that? You already know that the coalition is here. Just tell them that Baron Gorneo ordered it. You have to get it as soon as possible. I don\u2019t know how many more will die each day that we don\u2019t have the items.\u201dPuzzled, Jack tilted his head, but it was good for both of them to have a win-win situation.\u201cThe quantity of each medicinal herb should be more than enough to fill up one carriage. I think you should be able to obtain it faster and more accurately than mercenaries.\u201d\u201cI will get it to you as soon as possible\u2026\u201d Jack slightly bowed and disappeared into thin air. Watching him, Davey just shook the test tube in his hand.* * *As soon as the sun came up, Davey headed to the headquarters where the Coalition of Disease Control\u2019s doctors and administrative members were having a meeting. The knights who normally blocked his entrance into the headquarters no longer did that; perhaps they were given different orders from the members.\u201cAh! Prince Davey, you\u2019re here,\u201d Count Lington said.\u201cThank you all for your hard work,\u201d Davey replied.Lington chuckled. \u201cHaha, what is there to call hard work? It is you who\u2019s done the hard work, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard that you saved an emergency patient at the treatment center yesterday.\u201d\u201cIt just happened, so I dealt with it.\u201d\u201cHahaha! I was really surprised. I didn\u2019t know you were versed in the art of medicine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be proud of.\u201dLington shook his head vigorously. \u201cNot something to be proud of?! The treatment method you tried yesterday, Your Highness, was something that was new and bold to all of us. Isn\u2019t that right, Baron Gorneo?\u201dWhen you're just trying to make great content at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201c\u2026\u201d Gorneo lowered his head.Lington said, \u201cThank you for your help yesterday, but\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough with the formalities.\u201d Davey cut Gorneo off and stared at Lington. He said, \u201cThank you for stopping the territory from getting into worse shape. It has been a huge help.\u201dLington shook his hands in dismissal. \u201cThat is the very reason we are here.\u201d\u201cHowever, it is not that I cannot trust the two of you, but looking at the disease, we cannot afford to waste any time.\u201d\u201cThen, you are saying\u2026\u201d\u201cI will treat them. So please give me the right to participate in treatment activities.\u201dSlam!! Gorneo bolted up from his seat, exclaiming, \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cDoes this situation look like a joke to you?! Do you think they will be fine if we leave them to someone else for a few days like you want?!\u201d Gorneo shouted.Davey squinted. \u201cThat patient. Do you know that he would\u2019ve died if I was two or three minutes late?\u201dGorneo flinched at Davey\u2019s question. Normally, he would\u2019ve given them carrots and used his stick moderately, but he didn\u2019t have the luxury, nor did he think to do that since the patients would have to be treated as soon as it was prepared.\u201cLet me ask again: do either of you have a way to cure this disease?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cT\u2014Then! Are you saying that you have a way, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cYou should at least hold onto any chance if there is one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not trying to take away your jobs or anything. This is a territory of my kingdom, and the territory of my younger sister.\u201dAs Gorneo glared at Davey as his tightly held fists trembled, the atmosphere soon turned extremely hostile.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a good idea?\u201d Lington just fixed his monocle, which made his sharp eyes pop, and calmly wiped the cold sweat off. It seemed like he had no intention of acknowledging the threatening atmosphere.\u201cCount Lington!\u201d Gorneo shouted.\u201cWe must face reality. It hasn\u2019t been long since the \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019 has spread in the Ordem Territory. It\u2019s a relief that we acted quickly and not all the residents were affected. However\u2026\u201d Lington trailed off before his next question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the residents ended up dying, and dozens of doctors and knights died as well,\u201d Lington said.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dBefore Gorneo could finish his sentence, Lington went on. \u201cBaron Gorneo, you were also there. So, are you trying to maintain your pride in this situation? If there is even a sliver of hope\u2026 It might be right for us to hold onto it.\u201d\u201cThat damn pride! Sigh\u2026 Well, alright.\u201d Gorneo let out a deep breath, as if he was holding back something that he wanted to say, Then, he glanced at Davey and lowered his head. \u201cYou seem to be quite confident, Your Highness. Can you really show us something?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright. I am agreeing because you are the First Prince of this kingdom, and you possess a stigmata with special authority. If you think lightly about human life, I will make sure to hold the royal palace accountable!\u201d Even though the patients weren\u2019t from Gorneo\u2019s country, neither were they his responsibility, Gorneo still treated them as his top priority.\u2018I wouldn\u2019t hand over part of my rights to someone I couldn\u2019t trust, either.\u2019\u201cI won\u2019t let you down at least\u2026\u201d Davey smiled.Gorneo left the room as if he had nothing more to say. On the other hand, Lington spoke while maintaining his calm gaze. \u201cI will put my faith in you, Your Highness. Haha, although this is unbelievable.\u201d\u201cI am grateful for your consideration.\u201d Davey nodded.\u201cNo, that\u2019s alright. I was surprised that you have a better knowledge of medicine than I had expected. In fact, such cases do appear rarely, but\u2026 If it\u2019s alright, can I ask who you learned that kind of knowledge from?\u201dDavey didn\u2019t answer the question. He could say that he had learned it from Hypocria, the Goddess of Medicine from a different world, but he didn\u2019t really have a reason to tell them.* * *Although she was anxious, Winley couldn\u2019t hide her happiness when she heard that Davey was officially participating in medical activities. It seemed like she only relied on him and not the Coalition of Disease Control.Winley and Yulis were surprised at the fact that Davey possessed medical knowledge, but they soon expressed that Davey should tell them if there was anything he needed, and that he should unhesitantly ask them for support if anything came up.\u201cThe Red Tower will provide support, since I have quite a large amount of funds I can use with my personal authority. If there\u2019s anything you need that requires magic\u2026\u201d Yulis offered.Davey appreciated Yulis\u2019 good intentions, but he didn\u2019t really need them. Afterwards, Davey went into the individual treatment tents and obtained a few more test tubes with the blue-black liquid. Then, he divided them into the tubes he had prepared.The Artmite ore was a hard, solid ore that became sticky and tough after being melted at a certain temperature over a long period of time. It was the material of the test tubes, and that was probably why glasswork wasn\u2019t necessary in the Tionis continent.Count Lington provided Davey with a lot of information to show his full support, especially since Davey had decided to participate. The little pieces of information allowed Davey to put forward quite a few hypotheses.\u201cI guess they are still the best medical organization in the continent,\u201d Davey murmured as he glanced over the data and progress reports in the pile of documents. He had to complete this task perfectly now that he had started.Baron Gorneo, one of the council members, wasn\u2019t happy about this, but Davey had no reason to care about his situation.As Davey was observing the changes in the test tubes, two of the doctors in the administration came to Davey and reported their progress. \u201cYour Highness, we have finished classifying the patients that you talked about.\u201d\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s try to buy some time.\u201dThe completion of the antibody was estimated to be four days. During this period of time, Davey was determined to keep each and every one of the residents alive.* * *\u201cDo you think it will be okay?\u201d The elderly man asked. He looked quite old, but his unusually massive physique for his age and the sharpness of his gaze clearly showed that he was no ordinary being.\u201cFor what, Count Colio?\u201d Count Lington replied.Count Colio was the former captain of the royal palace of Lyndis\u2019 knights and was currently one of the Knights of Destruction\u2019s captains under the Coalition for Disease Control. He was a \u2018Swordmaster\u2019 who used to be famous in the Lyndis Empire.\u201cThe thing with the First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom. If he\u2019s really doing something\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, then the face of the coalition would be damaged.\u201dDavey, a teenager, had stepped up to solve what the people of the so-called \u201cbest medical organization of the continent\u201d had been struggling with for years. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if this was all. However, even to Lington, Davey really seemed to have something. The stigmata was a holy power, not something that gave him knowledge. That meant Davey either picked it up on his own or he learned the art of medicine from someone else.\u201cIt could potentially make people doubt our qualifications. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to protest if we declined like Baron Gorneo.\u201dLington just coolly nodded in agreement. \u201cThat is also true.\u201d\u201cThen, why\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, Count Colio\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good if the disease could be cured?\u201d Lington smiled.Count Colio\u2019s face stiffened slightly. \u201cRight.\u201d\u201cSince it has come to this, so what if Prince Davey is successful in curing the disease?\u201d Lington smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation for him and for us. It will push the field of medicine forward, and the ones who deserve honor will be given it. It\u2019s a win-win situation, is it not?\u201dCount Colio did not speak about who would be the one being given the honor.32. The Antibody, and Movement.\u201cAs Count Lington mentioned, the Coalition for Disease Control is changing all treatment measures to yours like you wanted,\u201d Baron Gorneo said.\u201cThank you for making such a huge decision.\u201d\u201cBut you must keep in mind. I will go so far as to watch you. I will at least have to be the line in the sand.\u201dDavey was replacing Gorneo; since Davey was nothing but an imposter to him, there was no way Gorneo was going to go down easily.\u201cTo be honest, there are some who are saying that we should not accept your ideas.\u201d\u201cBaron Gorneo.\u201d\u201cRemember that the art of medicine isn\u2019t a stepping stone for prestige.\u201d Gorneo, right now, was simply stating the obvious.\u201cI know it sounds crazy and it\u2019s hard to believe, but have some faith. I have no intention of letting Winley and Baris\u2019 residents die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis disease\u2014no, this variant of a virus\u2014causes high fevers, randomly alters body temperatures, and melts the entire body by the minute.\u201d\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201dThere was no significant difference between the Melting Acceleration Virus and a regular virus during its initial stages, but\u2026\u201cA virus remains dormant for a certain period of time when it first enters the human body. Only after a period of time does it become active.\u201d Speaking calmly, Davey grabbed the arm of a patient who was moaning in pain. He pressed on their entire body, and the bedridden patient began frowning from the pain.Groan\u2026\u201cJust endure a little bit. The pain will subside soon.\u201d Davey spoke to the patient, then kept listing the symptoms. \u201cFirst, the muscles start to melt. Then, the bones begin to melt, starting with the joints and cartilage.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would actually be a relief if it ended there. Next, it\u2019s the organs. It begins with the rectal area and the gonads, then it travels up to the kidneys, large and small intestines, and then the pancreas, liver, and stomach.\u201dGorneo\u2019s face was filled with surprise. Then, he expressed shock when Davey kept explaining and listing out the symptoms of a patient from the beginning stages to the end. His shock was understandable, since this disease was rarely known in this world.\u201cBy then, the fluid of liquified internal body parts begins flowing out of the holes. Since it looks like blue-black spots on the skin as it leaks out, that\u2019s probably how it gets the name, \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019.\u201d\u2018Do you know why I am explaining this to you?\u2019\u201cPrince Davey, don\u2019t tell me that\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it is officially called \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019 here, but it is also called the \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019 in a different place.\u201d\u201cA different place\u2026 \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the important part. Doctors who encounter this disease try the same thing and then come to one conclusion: they have to find the source and remove it, since it cannot be treated with drugs.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 That is true\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m right, most of them have died during the procedure, and the remaining few have been completely destroyed by the virus that grew inside their bodies.\u201d\u2018Am I wrong?\u2019Baron Gorneo trembled, feeling nervous.\u2018What a sight.\u2019\u201cI feel a little more comfortable, sir\u2026\u201d The patient said in between groans.\u201cYes, try to endure the pain a little bit more even if it hurts. I will definitely keep you alive if you want to live.\u201d\u201cTh\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201dThe patient was just a commoner, one of the underprivileged members that this damn monarchal continent paid no attention to. Nobody would really care if people like that died. However, they were all just human beings and patients to Davey. Davey had no intention of compromising anything related to the art of medicine, even if it\u2019s because of the promise he had made with the person who had taught him the art of medicine.\u201cWhat about the items I asked for?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cI have prepared them at the location you have specified.\u201d\u201cShriek!!\u201d Gorneo widened his eyes in surprise when he heard a man responding to Davey. It was natural since someone had suddenly appeared when there wasn\u2019t any presence before.\u201cAlright. Put it on the tab and let\u2019s finish it in four days.\u201dA quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.Gorneo blankly stared at the man disappearing into thin air, then followed Davey with mixed emotions.* * *Four days went by. Gorneo honestly couldn\u2019t hide his bewilderment.\u201cMy, the color is changing.\u201d\u201cHow is the blue-black color changing back to red?\u201dGorneo couldn\u2019t even hear the little girl and the man with square glasses who were speaking in fascination.\u201cHow is this\u2026\u201d That was all Gorneo could say. If he never witnessed this with his own eyes, he would never have believed it.\u201cWhat did I say? I told you I was going to finish this in four days.\u201d\u201cBig brother!!\u201d\u201cNow all you have to do is monitor the situation and administer it.\u201d\u201cSob\u2026 Weep\u2026 Thank you, Big brother\u2026\u201dWatching Winley, the little girl, weep as she ran into Prince Davey\u2019s arms, Baron Gorneo just flopped onto his chair dejectedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No way\u2026 No kind of medicine worked!\u201dSomething like this had never happened.\u201cI wish I had a microscope\u2026but there\u2019s nothing like that here.\u201d The man didn\u2019t even know what a microscope was, but the important thing was that\u2026\u201cAn antibody\u2026 An antibody! The first thing that the doctors, who were the best of the best in this field, gave up on was making an antibody!\u201d The man, Baron Gorneo, gasped in astonishment.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d Davey just grinned.The human body had a system that prepared for the next viral attack by remembering its initial attack; this was the relationship between antigens and antibodies. However, Gorneo had thought that an antibody couldn\u2019t be developed for this nasty disease. Since he was also an exceptional doctor, he had attempted to make an antibody numerous times, but had failed time and time again. Yet, right in front of his eyes now was the outcome he had been searching for over the last three years.\u201cB\u2014But this isn\u2019t something that could be made this easily\u2026\u201d Gorneo stammered.\u201cIt\u2019s because I used something that isn\u2019t usually used in medicine. Baron Gorneo, can I tell you something funny?\u201d As he stopped stroking Winley\u2019s head, Davey spoke with a smile. Then, he filled a thin needle with the transparent liquid he had made and injected it into the blue-black blood. Just then, something fascinating began to happen; the blue-black fluid started to gather in one place, as if it was running away from the needle. Then, the blue-black color subsided and all that was left was a red fluid, normal human blood.\u201cYou know, the \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019 should actually be thought of as an organism that strategically targets the human body, which has strong survival instincts. It is a parasite, and an extremely malicious one at that.\u201d Baron Gorneo anxiously looked at Davey, who went on to explain, \u201cSo, I needed to break the spirits of this damn parasite to do something.\u201dNo one had ever thought about such an approach. This method needed a few kinds of medicinal herbs and a few kinds of poisonous plants that people believed could not be used for medicine.\u201cHaha, I had some trouble with finding the medicinal herbs because the names are different.\u201dEveryone, including Class-5 Yulis, Baron Gorneo, and Princess Winley, shared the same thought. \u2018Where did he find that out?\u2019* * *\u2018How much do you know, and what more do you know?\u2019 Baron Gorneo parted his lips to speak, but promptly shut his mouth. He was deep in thought.Right now, it seemed like Gorneo was interrogating Davey. But Davey just calmly handed him the test tubes he had prepared, as if he had already expected such a reaction. Davey said, \u201cThe dosage per person is one over fifty. Give it to them. Exactly fifty people can be treated with one tube. Since there are markings on the tube, can I leave this to you?\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u201cOne dose won\u2019t completely cure them, so they can\u2019t be up and about. The dose has to be given somewhat regularly. Well, the prescription of the drug is as written. I have obtained the ingredients and left it in the back, so use it however you\u2019d like.\u201d\u2018Since it\u2019s not even my money, and it\u2019s charged to the Coalition for Disease Control.\u2019Gorneo couldn\u2019t laugh even when Davey was speaking playfully, because Davey was acting like this wasn\u2019t a big deal. Countless doctors had given up on this disease, but this young boy in front of him had solved it in four days.Baron Gorneo felt like he didn\u2019t know what to do, but he could also feel his long-forgotten passion as a scholar of medicine returning. Then, he just bowed to Davey with wide eyes, abandoning his initial objective and the petty pride he had as a doctor. \u201cL\u2014Leave it to me!\u201d That\u2019s all Gorneo could say.Afterwards, word began spreading all over the territory that Prince Davey had finally completed the cure for this nasty disease.* * *\u201cDid you hear?\u201d\u201cAh, are you talking about that piece of news?\u201d Lington answered as he was relaxing and sipping on a glass of wine. \u201cYes, the commoners are going crazy over it, saying that he\u2019s the saint who has driven out the demon. Haha, I guess it\u2019s not weird that he is being called a saint since he has a stigmata.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd aren\u2019t I right? The prince of the Rowane Kingdom actually cracked the problem that the coalition had left unsolved for all this time,\u201d Lington said. Then, he murmured to himself, sounding intrigued, \u201cAnd in just four days.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing?\u2019\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking if it\u2019s okay to just leave it like this.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t anything that would cause any problems, at least in principle. Prince Davey was given the authority through negotiations with Lington and was successful in curing patients. Of course, Lington could have declined the prince\u2019s help, but he was confident that he had seen all kinds of people; it was clear that Davey had a bold character that constantly pushed him forward despite any setbacks.\u201cThis is how medicine will advance again.\u201d Lington smiled.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cThis was a task that the continent\u2019s greatest doctors have racked their brains about, and they couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. It\u2019s a nasty disease that could have been forever left as an unsolved problem.\u201dHoly power didn\u2019t work on this disease. Normal drugs became poisonous and caused the patient to die if administered incorrectly. In addition, the course of death was absolutely horrendous.\u201cThis teenage boy has rescued humanity from a huge crisis. Thankfully, this disease hadn\u2019t caused any problems in the past because it\u2019s extremely rare, but now, the \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019\u2026 It was called \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019, right? Anyways, this disease has now lost its power.\u201dThe problem was that a teenage boy was the one who had developed a cure for it. If this were to be known, not only would Count Lington\u2019s reputation be damaged, but the reputation of everyone who was involved. It wasn\u2019t really their fault, but it was just that an outsider had done their work for them.Thud!!\u201cWho is it?!\u201d Count Colio shouted angrily.A knight quickly ran into the room. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry! But it is urgent news!\u201d\u201cNow now, don\u2019t be so mad, Count Colio,\u201d Lington said to Colio. \u201cSo, tell us. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dCount Colio frowned. He didn\u2019t like the fact that Lington was remaining calm even in a situation like this.\u201cTh\u2014That is\u2026 The patients who were given the new cure developed by Prince Davey\u2026\u201d\u201cHm? Has something gone wrong?\u201d\u201cNo! Apparently, they are making a rapid recovery\u2026\u201dShwing\u2026 Splatter!!!\u00a0The knight who was wearing a strange, hooded cape that only had holes for the eyes fell. Blood splattered everywhere and he collapsed onto the ground. Count Colio\u2019s sword glistened.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201dSearch tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w for the original.Lington, who was smiling, murmured in a quiet voice, \u201cCount Colio. I am\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cI am a doctor. I am a doctor who fixes people and politics.\u201d Then, Lington put his hands behind his back and stared out the window. \u201cLet\u2019s perform a little bit of a procedure. Our funding is going to get cut off if we leave the situation as is, right?\u201dWith an eerie smile, Lington\u2019s eyes sparkled with a hint of madness.Lington had received quite a lot of funding for the treatment of the \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019. And part of that money had been used to achieve his other precious goal. Count Colio had joined forces with him for the same goal as well.\u201cSo, let\u2019s do it quietly and secretly. Now that it has come to this, let\u2019s get rid of that wary Baron Gorneo who is digging up dirt on us. Ah, and the person who has the stigmata and the talented mage of the wizard tower\u2026 They are quite interesting. Don\u2019t kill them.\u201d The eerie smile on Lington\u2019s face deepened as he said thoughtfully, \u201cI guess there will be some resistance, but a \u2018Swordmaster\u2019 should be able to do it. Just subdue them. We can just tell the public that the Ordem Territory has been completely destroyed by monsters. It has to be a win-win situation, right?\u201d* * *\u201cBig brother, do you know what the residents are calling you? They are calling you a saint. A saint\u2026! Yes. I knew you were extraordinary, but I didn\u2019t know you were well-versed in the art of medicine as well.\u201dDavey lightly pinched Winley on the cheek because her sparkling eyes were so cute, so she groaned quietly. Yulis, who had his gaze fixed on her, laughed.\u201cYour Highness, you are more fascinating the more I get to know you. But how did you know?\u201d Yulis asked.\u201cKnow what?\u201d Davey asked while he organized some documents and divided the medicine into separate tubes.\u201cUm\u2026 The \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019. You already seemed to know about that disease.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBig brother! Does that mean we can save Portna?\u201d Winley exclaimed.\u201cOf course. She actually needs to be the first one to be treated because she is in the worst situation.\u201dBaron Gorneo, who was absent because he had to go administer the cure, seemed very wary and meticulous. Looking at him, Davey respected the man\u2019s integrity and determination. \u2018That kind of good will is hard to see.\u2019-Good will\u2026Count Lington seemed like a person who could embrace anything on the outside. Davey wouldn\u2019t have doubted him if he didn\u2019t catch the familiar feeling in his smile. However, the man seemed more like a researcher rather than a doctor. On the other hand, Baron Gorneo was stubborn, but Davey respected his dedication to medicine. Perhaps that was why Davey was able to treat Gorneo with kindness even though Gorneo had been nothing but snippy.-Well, you rarely had a chance to meet someone new. You can meet new people and start growing from now on.Perserque was the only person who could truly understand Davey, and she was the only person he could truly understand. Davey smiled at her warm words.\u201cAnyways, I wonder where Baris went. I heard that he left the territory with some knights.\u201d\u201cHe also has his work to do.\u201d Winley puffed up her cheeks and complained, as if she didn\u2019t like the fact that Baris was absent.\u201cAnyway, Your Highness, is there anything I can do to help?\u201d Yulis asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, big brother! All I\u2019ve done up until now was just watch you. So please let me do something to help you.\u201dDavey thought about what they were saying, then nodded. \u201cThen could you alter the temperatures of those fluids that are being heated?\u201d\u201cThe\u2026temperature?\u201dThis shouldn\u2019t be a difficult task for them, since they knew magic from the Red Tower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt should be easy to manage with a heater spell. I\u2019m going to go see if the treatment is going well, so please maintain the current temperature,\u201d Davey said to Winley, who nodded with determination.* * *The atmosphere of the tent turned awkward after Davey followed Baron Gorneo out.\u201cYou seem to really like Prince Davey, Princess Winley.\u201dA simple magic spell for temperature change was easy for both Yulis and Winley, both of whom had learned the Red Tower\u2019s magic. Yulis, who was familiarly handling the heat with mana, asked the question with a faint smile on his face, so Winley\u2019s expression softened.Winley smiled. \u201cRight? Big brother has always been such an amazing person, even in the past.\u201d\u201cIn the past\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s always kind to us. He stayed by our sides, saying that we\u2019re family even though we have different mothers. He\u2019s a little feisty\u2026 But we will never be able to forget the warmth he shows us.\u201d Winley couldn\u2019t even remember when it was, but she smiled while rubbing her red cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like Big brother so much. I still remember the old story called \u2018The Three Little Pigs\u2019 that he told us when we were younger.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m envious,\u201d Yulis mumbled without a hint of insincerity and smiled softly. \u201cThen, Princess Winley, if I\u2026\u201dWhoosh\u2026 Whoosh\u2026 Whoosh\u2026\u00a0Feeling a vibration, Yulis stopped talking and pulled out a small object from his chest pocket.\u201cA communication artifact?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 My apologies. I must get this.\u201dWinley just smiled brightly and nodded. Yulis quickly got up and left the room with a pale face.\u201cHehe. Maybe I\u2019ll bake some delicious cookies for Big Brother.\u201d Winley started to think about what she should do after this whole incident came to an end and the coalition finally left. Since Davey was here anyway, she wanted to show him the specialties of the territory and make him delicious food with the baking skills she had acquired. She smiled, thinking of all those happy thoughts. It could seem like she had romantic feelings for Davey, but she was just unfortunately obsessed with her older brother.Tap\u2026 Tap\u2026\u201cOh, are you already back?\u201dIt had been about five minutes since Yulis had left. Winley, who was releasing mana from her fingers, turned around and smiled when she heard footsteps behind her. No, she was going to turn around if it wasn\u2019t for something hitting the back of her neck.Thwack!\u201cAh\u2026 Oh?\u201d Winley collapsed without being able to fight back. She only saw a blurry image of an old knight wearing a red uniform with a scarf instead of a hood before passing out.* * *\u201cTeacher,\u201d Yulis greeted.\u201cWell, has everything gone well?\u201d Hellison asked.\u201cYes. Prince Davey is extraordinary. I didn\u2019t know that he\u2019s knowledgeable in the art of medicine.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThe most outstanding thing about him is his confidence.\u201d\u201cHm, confidence, you say?\u201d Hellison appeared to be satisfied, stroking his white beard.Yulis nodded. \u201cWhat do I say\u2026 He displays the confidence of someone who has a lot of experience. The fact that he has that kind of confidence at such a young age probably means that there could be something I don\u2019t know about.\u201d\u201cIf you feel that way, then that probably is the case.\u201d\u201cYes, there is a lot to learn from being by Prince Davey\u2019s side. But honestly, I have some personal desires.\u201d\u201cDesires?\u201d\u201cYes. Perhaps he could become a close friend regardless of age or group interests.\u201dApart from his capabilities, Davey was strangely kind and warm. He was slightly different from the members of royalty or nobility who lived a planned life from the moment they were born; if Yulis had to describe him, he seemed like a free person.\u201cChuckle! I see that you\u2019ve met a good person. There are things that cannot be judged by age. Remember that there are things to learn, even from a three-year-old.\u201d\u201cYes, Teacher.\u201dHellison contently stroked his beard. \u201cAnd I did some research on the thing you asked me about.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Did you find anything?\u201d\u201cYes. Baron Gorneo and Count Lington, the two people in charge of the Coalition for Disease Control\u2019s special project. Most of their information has been lost, but I managed to find something.\u201d Hellison sighed, then went on. \u201cYes, Baron Gorneo is indeed a good person. It\u2019s rare to see a person that good-willed and dedicated. However\u2026 That guy named Lington is a little different.\u201dYulis quietly listened to what Hellison had to say, even forgetting the fact that his face was stiffening up as his teacher\u2019s explanation went on. And when that story came to an end\u2026 Boom!!!! Yulis widened his eyes, witnessing how the tent with Davey\u2019s cure went up in flames with a large exploding sound.\u201cN\u2014No!!!\u201d Yulis lost his usual smile, crying out loud. He hurried away.* * *A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.\u201cPrincess Winley!\u201d Yulis hurried over, screaming while looking at the burning tent dejectedly. He and Winley were taking care of the cure that Davey had left them not too long ago. But this had happened in the few moments he was gone.[Listen! Communicate!][Water Cyclone!]As he reflexively released his mana, a staff burst out of his Yulis and shone. At the same time, a large amount of water came flowing from the empty space and swirled around to extinguish the fire.Shhhh\u2026\u201cP\u2014Princess Winley!!\u201dYulis had reflexively used an advanced 4th circle magic spell. He lost a substantial amount of mana because he had suddenly used magic, and quite a high circle one at that. But ignoring the feeling of life draining out of him, he ran into the remains of the tent without noticing that his robe was becoming a mess. However, all he could see was the cure that had been entirely destroyed.\u201cWhat in\u2026\u201d Yulis couldn\u2019t see Winley anywhere. He froze up before he widened his eyes, remembering something. He didn\u2019t think this would be the case, but what his teacher had just told him definitely made it a possibility. Although Yulis knew that this person didn\u2019t have a normal past, he didn\u2019t think that this person would cause a scene here.With a pale face, Yulis immediately began to move without hesitation. \u2018Prince Davey has an exceptional knowledge about medicine and has a stigmata, but he doesn\u2019t have power. I cannot get him involved in this. Then\u2026\u2019\u00a0Yulis knew that only he could do something about this. Upon coming to that conclusion, he immediately cast a 5th circle flying magic spell and quickly followed the traces.His full name was Lington Bornithiad, and he was a genius who had shown talent in medical knowledge from a young age. He was born in the Ryuthis Kingdom, a medicinal kingdom that existed in the eastern continent and was later subjugated to the Lyndis Empire, the superpower of the east. However, Lington had once been punished and banned from medical activity in the Ryuthis Empire because of his strange nature.That had happened when a cure for a disease had to be developed but not many patients had been inflicted with the rare disease. At that time, 15-year-old Lington had kidnapped about two hundred of his territory\u2019s residents and had carried out hundreds of experiments on them after injecting them with the virus. He did end up successfully developing the cure\u2026but it was said that only ten of the two hundred residents had survived at the end of the experimentation phase. The survivors were all disabled, dying less than three months later.It was obvious that Lington would do anything to achieve his goal. A person who killed someone else was called a murderer, and one who killed more than a single person was called a serial killer. A person who killed a hundred people was called a slaughterer, but killing ten thousand people could earn someone the title of hero. However, Lington\u2019s strange ideology only made him look like a demon who had killed ten thousand people.\u201cYou must be well!!\u201d Yulis quietly ground his teeth.* * *Meanwhile, Davey, who was examining and treating patients in the treatment center that Baron Gorneo had led him to, frowned at the red armored knights. They were surrounding him with their swords out. He called out, \u201cHey, Baron Gorneo.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWell, is there a problem?\u201dBaron Gorneo shook his head vigorously. \u201cAbsolutely not! Hey you, what are you all doing?! How dare you take your swords out in the sacred treatment center!!\u201dGorneo was a superior of the knightly order, and so, they should be following his orders, but no one put their swords down at his command. The knights, who were all wearing strange-looking hoods with only the eye holes cut out, released \u2018Aura\u2019 from the tip of their blades. They were seemingly boasting that their power was higher than \u2018Expert.\u2019The knights declared, \u201cWe have no grudge against you, but an order is an order.\u201d\u201cOrder?\u201d\u201cFollowing the order of Count Lington, you must die here, Baron Gorneo. Your Highness, please follow us.\u201dBaron Gorneo widened his eyes in shock. \u201cWhy would he do such a thing?!\u201dOf course, the knights disregarded Gorneo\u2019s protests. They said, \u201cDo not fight back. It will just be more painful if you do.\u201dClang!!!\u00a0One of the knights swung his sword at Gorneo.\u201cOh, really?\u201d At the same time, a pale hand easily grabbed the end\u2014the blade\u2014of the sword without blinking an eye.33. The Chase\u201cGroan\u2026\u201dThe probability was very low for an ordinary person, who was now aging and getting old, to block the blow of a knight who was more skilled than the \u2018Expert\u2019 level. Gorneo had no doubts that he would have been beheaded by the sudden attack. He did have Davey, a young man, by his side, but he had heard nothing about Davey having power. He just knew that Davey possessed an unstable stigmata\u2026 He was so certain that he had no choice but to die from that attack, so what was this?Cling\u2026 Cling!\u00a0The knight who held onto that sword was trembling. He looked at Davey, who held onto the blade with his bare hands, with mixed emotions.\u201cY\u2014Your Highness?\u201d Gorneo called out.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cOh\u2026 Oh, yes.\u201d\u201cKeugh!\u201d The knight groaned, using all of his strength to yank the sword out of Davey\u2019s grip. But the sword just wouldn\u2019t budge no matter how hard he tried.\u201cDid you say that Lington sent you?\u201d Davey asked the knights.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, that politician guy bothered me a little, but I didn\u2019t think that he was stupid enough to do something like this.\u201d Davey\u2019s eyes shone dangerously. At the same time, he tugged the sword toward him. The sword-wielding knight followed the sword, falling toward Davey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The knight who was trying with all his strength to retrieve his sword from Davey lost his balance and fell toward the prince instead.Once the knight fell, Davey immediately let go of the sword. He then placed his hand on the knight\u2019s stomach.[5th Circle][Zero-charge Thunder]Boom!!\u201cKeuhuk!!\u201dWith a sudden sound, a magnificent blinding light momentarily engulfed the surroundings before disappearing. Sizzle\u2026 The knight now looked like a piece of burnt meat.Davey glanced at the stiffened knight with boredom, then his expression hardened. He said, \u201cSo, they told you to kill us.\u201dRealizing that something was off, the knights tried to move.\u201cDon\u2019t cause a ruckus in a hospital room, you asses.\u201d\u201cKuk!!!\u201dDavey could see confusion arising in the knights, all of whom he slammed to the ground with ease. \u2018They are being pressed to the ground by an unknown pressure. Of course they are in disbelief.\u2019For the knights, this mission should have been an easy success, since the assassination target wasn\u2019t someone to be cautious about. Obviously, the knights were now baffled, because the situation wasn\u2019t what they expected.\u201cWell, you should know that your death is also a possibility during an assassination,\u201d Davey spoke calmly. He felt one of the knights flinch as he stepped on them.-Davey, if you shed blood here\u2026\u2018That\u2019s why I\u2019m not using my sword.\u2019\u00a0Davey had no intentions of shedding blood here.[5th Circle][Zero-charge Thunder]This was a proximal-type 5th-circle magic spell that caused a high-voltage shock. Its force was so strong that it could knock out a troll, who had an incredible recovery speed, in just about two hits. It was also the most advanced magic spell Davey could currently use with the highest circle level he could employ. This was also the best way to get rid of the knights without causing a scene.\u201cKeuhuk\u2026 W\u2026 What is\u2026\u201d The knights all turned pale, realizing just who had caused their comrade to fall to the ground.At the same time, the knights who had barely escaped from Davey charged at him. Thump\u2026\u00a0Of course they were surprised that Davey was using magic, but there was no way they could have known that his main weapon of choice was a sword.\u201cKuk?!\u201dBoom!!Davey took another step forward as another knight fell to the ground.\u201cW\u2014Wait!\u201dBoom!!!Shriek!! Realizing that something was wrong and that they had to escape, the knights who were still standing quickly turned away to run. However\u2026\u201cI\u2019m coming. Let me see your backs.\u201dBoom!![Fast-traveling Teleportation][Flash]\u2018You shouldn\u2019t show your back so easily.\u2019\u00a0Leaving an afterimage of himself, Davey instantly charged toward the knights. He was soon ahead of them, burning them all into a crisp. With the intense smell of burning flesh wafting through the air, Davey called out, \u201cJack.\u201d\u201cDo you need something?\u201d\u201cGet rid of the bodies. And kill any enemies that come in here.\u201d\u201cI will calculate this into my final compensation.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how big of a compensation you are going to ask for, but sure.\u201dJack\u2014no, Aina Helishana, who stood beside Davey like she had never left, nodded quietly. Then. she vanished into thin air.\u201cBaron Gorneo.\u201dLeaving the tent, Davey could see Gorneo\u2019s eyes grow wide when he called out. Gorneo seemed to have a hard time believing what had happened in front of his eyes. \u2018Man, a lot of things surprise you.\u2019\u201cPlease stay back and keep treating them,\u201d Davey told Gorneo.\u201cT\u2014Then, Your Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cI will come back after exterminating those worthless humans.\u201dGorneo stood in front of the tent with no words.* * *After leaving the treatment center, Davey could see the knights in red uniforms come out from his surroundings.\u201cThe target uses a strange electricity! Capture him carefully!\u201dThere were about twenty or thirty knights, all of whom weren\u2019t ordinary. They were all skilled above the \u2018Expert\u2019 level.Davey didn\u2019t have Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon as weapons. The only person he could think of as a suitable fighting partner was Aina Helishana, but he had already given her the order to stop anyone from coming to this area.-Davey.\u201cThe tracking magic spell I put on Winley has begun to move,\u201d Davey muttered with irritation.Davey put his hand in the air. Whoosh!! His mana, which was circulating in his body, spread throughout the territory as a very thin and large wavelength. Since he didn\u2019t have a weapon\u2026\u201cEveryone! Eliminate the target!\u201dStab!!!\u201cKeugh?!\u201dDavey had no choice but to bring one.One of the attacking knights fell to the ground, bisected.A red light rapidly dived through the sky and left an afterimage. Shwing\u2026 At the same time, a Ring Pommel Sword that scattered a red light resonated with a creepy metallic sound. Red Ribbon fell into Davey\u2019s hand as it emitted a dangerously red light.Whee\u2026 Stab!! Something blue fell into Davey\u2019s hands after flying through the air. During its flight, it slashed another two knights.[Telekinetic Blade Control][Divine Sword Art: Ego Blade][Cosmic Sword Dance]The skill was a simple Blade Control that used Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon, steering the swords while they remained in the air. To outsiders, the swords had seemingly come to life and were slashing the enemy themselves\u2026 But that was technically true since both swords had egos.Davey immediately pointed Red Ribbon down and twisted Blue Ribbon so that it faced the sky. Without hesitation, he stepped out with his left foot and saluted before taking on a fighting stance.If he remained caught up with these meddlesome knights, Davey would be wasting his time. So he decided that his best option was to get rid of them now, so that they wouldn\u2019t end up slowing him down.Davey applied an explosive force to his left foot, and he put pressure on the ground. His sword flashed in the air as he used the rebound from his foot to jump up. \u2018They were all \u2018Expert\u2019? I think the assassins I met while traveling to the Felicity Territory were stronger than this.\u2019* * *\u201cKyaa!! W\u2014Wait! Wait, stop\u2026!\u201d The knight who screamed and crawled on the floor\u2026was beheaded. His head flew up in the air.Davey slashed multiple knights as he quickly moved through them. They were all positioned strategically to hold him up for as long as they could. He could practically feel their malicious intent. Davey thought that he would have had a hard time with them if he was just some mediocre \u2018Master\u2019.-Why did they target Yulis and Winley?\u201cProbably an excuse.\u201d\u201cShriek! P\u2014Please!\u201dSplatter! Davey was in a quiet forest; he unhesitantly beheaded the knight, since he had nothing to watch out for.\u201cThere are only two council members, so some of them should listen to Baron Gorneo, right?\u201d After pondering for a moment, Davey realized that they were all subordinates of Count Lington.-Excuses?\u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny because I honestly just thought of it, but they can\u2019t just kill us and act like nothing happened. There\u2019s still rank to think about.\u201dDavey had placed a protection spell on Winley, but it was too draining to keep it up. Because he could only use magic at about the 5th circle, he had switched the protection spell to a tracking spell, which he could maintain for longer. But now this had happened. Well, a protection spell was probably useless if the opponent was a \u2018Swordmaster\u2019.\u201cYulis is an elder of the Red Tower, and Winley and I are royal members of the Rowane Kingdom.\u201d-Right.As he walked past the cold bodies on the ground, Davey approached an ajar iron door that was under a gigantic tree. Someone had arrived before he did, and the only person he could think of was Yulis.\u201cIf we died, the Orden Territory would be examined to determine what happened. The best excuse would be us being attacked by barbarians or monsters, and both cases are possible in the Ordem Territory. What could the royal palace or the Red Tower do if they just said that we died while defending the territory from invaders?\u201d-What does that have to do with kidnapping Winley?\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t know for sure, but it seems to just be an excuse for later on.\u201d After speaking calmly, Davey quickly headed underground, one that was carefully made to be rather sturdy. However, he cut through all the walls blocking him with Red Ribbon and marched on. \u201cWinley went missing. So, the Knights of Destruction, Count Colio, the captain of the order, left the territory to find her. Then, there was an attack.\u201d\u2018This would be enough for them to avoid responsibility.\u2019\u201cA\u2014An intrud\u2026 Keugh!\u201d One of the Knights of Destruction shouted upon noticing Davey\u2019s presence.Davey pierced his fingers into the knight\u2019s neck, causing a sharp stab into the flesh. He kicked the fallen knight who was spewing blood, then slashed the wall once more to reveal a large space.A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.The area was too big for a thorough search, but Davey was unfazed. He already knew of Winley\u2019s approximate location. If the path was blocked by a tough wall, Davey was going to break it with Red Ribbon. If there were someone getting in the way, he would simply slash them.-But then, did they really have to do that to Winley\u2026 They could\u2019ve just said that it happened\u2026Davey could hear Perserque\u2019s confused mumbling, but he just focused on the bottom of the void. The situation was so unspeakably atrocious that it couldn\u2019t be described in any other way.-Oh my\u2026Davey and Perserque could see hundreds of people, who were tied to a bed with strange cells transplanted to them.\u201cDid the knights try to capture me alive?\u201dPerserque thought about it for a second, then nodded.-The only possibility is that they were trying to obtain a high-level mage or a person with stigmata, since these people are hard to come by.\u2018How dare they.\u2019* * *\u201cWhat is\u2026\u201d Gorneo, left behind at the treatment center, was still in panic. He couldn\u2019t comprehend just what had happened in front of his eyes.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dBut then, Gorneo heard a manly, emotionless voice that snapped him out of it. When he turned around, he saw a man wearing a black uniform with a black mask covering his entire face.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201cI will make sure to carry out my part of the deal. You do your job.\u201dBaron Gorneo flinched. \u201cYou are fine with this situation?!\u201d\u201cSo what if I am not?\u201d Gorneo\u2019s eyes opened wide as Jack continued, \u201cAre you going to abandon the patients in front of you because the knights caused a problem?\u201d\u201cO\u2014Of course not!\u201d\u201cThen why are you stopping? You should do your job if Prince Davey trusted you to.\u201d\u201cB\u2014But if the entire Knights of Destruction! And if it is true that Count Colio\u2019s involved in this matter!\u201d\u201cIf it is?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Prince Davey also in danger?! Do you not have to help?!\u201dGorneo\u2019s concerns were valid; all of the knights in Knights of Destruction were above the \u2018Expert\u2019 level, and their captain, Count Colio, was once a famous \u2018Swordmaster\u2019. However, Davey was left alone and without a weapon to face enemies as powerful as these. It was true that Davey had some strange, unexpected power, but Gorneo didn\u2019t think that it was a magic bullet.However, Jack didn\u2019t seem to agree with Gorneo. He asked, \u201cWho is worrying about who right now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gorneo asked.\u201cYou\u2019re worrying about Prince Davey? Ha\u2026\u201dFor the first time, Gorneo could feel emotion from Jack: bafflement.\u201cFrankly, there\u2019s nothing more useless in the world than worrying about him,\u201d Jack stated as though it was the most obvious fact in the world.\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, if Jack spoke the truth, then Gorneo\u2019s work had already been planned out for him. Gorneo wondered aloud, \u201cSeriously\u2026 Who is Prince Davey\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I would like to know that as well\u2026 But it\u2019s against policy for a merchant of information to give out that piece of information so easily.\u201d\u201cP\u2014Put it on my bill!\u201d\u201cThat human\u2026 I can\u2019t tell anything about him. All I know is that he was practically dying from a coma not too long ago, but he\u2019s become a totally different person in just these few months,\u201d Jack revealed.Gorneo, who was dumbfounded by the ridiculous piece of information, strongly shook his head. He hoped that he had misheard Jack. Then, he simply said, \u201cAlright. Then, please keep me safe so that no one can bother me while I treat these patients!\u201dEach of them had their job to do; Gorneo acknowledged that fact, and he began preparing to treat patients straightaway.* * *\u201c[Demi-Hellfire]!\u201dA 5th circle magic bombed the entire hall, which went up in flames. Although the power of [Demi-Hellfire] was probably incomparable to the power of a legendary 9th circle spell, [Hellfire], this attack was powerful enough against \u2018Expert\u2019 level people.\u201cGahhh!!!\u201d The knights were swept up by the flames. They rolled on the floor while screaming, then collapsed miserably.\u201cCough cough!\u201d Staggering with a pale face, Yulis coughed hard and frowned. Normally, he would have never used this kind of magic on humans.\u2018Magic can easily end a life, so be careful when using it.\u2019\u00a0This is what Yulis had learned from his teacher. However, why would he have learned magic if he couldn\u2019t even use it when he needed to? Yulis had learned magic to protect people and to study. He wouldn\u2019t be worthy of being an elder if he couldn\u2019t even protect the person who was in his heart.Yulis followed the trail and left the territory as soon as Winley went missing. Since he was the only one who could do it, he had made a bold decision. After following the knights who were keeping him in check and entering this unknown facility, he felt the life drain out of him upon seeing the horrifying situation through the large glass. It seemed that Count Lington was more of a psychopath than Yulis had imagined.\u201cKeugh!\u201dCrash!! Burnt to a crisp, one of the knights collapsed onto the floor and instantly broke the thick door apart.Yulis was completely exhausted from using mana extensively and could barely hold himself up with his staff. He looked past the door while supporting himself on the staff. As expected, he saw dozens of the red-uniformed Knights of Destruction who were holding out their swords, and the captain standing in the middle. Yulis yelled, \u201cCount Colio\u2026 Where is Princess Winley?!\u201dCount Colio silently pointed his chin.Yulis looked over. He could see Count Lington standing right by Winley, who was unconscious and tied up.Lington wiped the sweat off his forehead like usual and spoke rather unwillingly. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect you to be lured this easily.\u201d\u201cCount Lington! Do you know what you are doing?!\u201dLington just shrugged at Yulis\u2019 yelling. He cooed, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a win-win situation for both of us. Don\u2019t be so mad; it\u2019s good for us both.\u201d\u201cHow is this damn situation a win-win?\u201dAfter Yulis shouted in fury, Lington tilted his head as if he truly didn\u2019t understand. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s good? Prince Davey has died and progressed human medicine one step further. And I have gained prestige from that accomplishment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd for you, Class-5 Yulis\u2026 You will help humanity by becoming an exceptional experiment subject. There isn\u2019t a more perfect win-win situation than this, right?\u201d Yulis automatically clenched his jaw as Lington continued speaking playfully, \u201cWhat do you think? I think it\u2019s quite perfect, so why don\u2019t you stop fighting back and start cooperating\u2026?\u201dBoom!!! Lington wasn\u2019t able to finish his sentence; he was interrupted by a red ball of fire exploding right in front of him. Perhaps it was because the knights had blocked the attack as if they were ready for it, but the explosion did not even leave a scratch on Lington.\u201cOh no\u2026 You don\u2019t like the idea?\u201d\u201cI refuse to listen to your bullshit!\u201d Enraged by the situation, Yulis\u2019 eyes shone with hostility. At the same time, he released a threatening mana from his body.\u201cTsk\u2026 Fighting back until the very end\u2026 Count Colio, subdue him with the least amount of violence. A living subject is much more useful than a dead one.\u201dCount Colio silently raised his sword and pointed it toward Yulis. At the same time, the knights who stood in a line all charged toward Yulis at once.* * *Yulis burned so many people alive that he couldn\u2019t remember exactly how many. \u201cCough.\u201d He coughed up blood and collapsed to the ground, since he couldn\u2019t support himself from the countless sword wounds he had sustained. He had run out of mana, and his favorite staff was all dented and cracked from the excessive mana use and blocking too many attacks. The mana stone on his staff had lost its shine as well.\u201cYou held up for quite a while.\u201dEven though Yulis had fought back desperately, he hadn\u2019t been able to successfully land an attack on Lington once. To be exact, he couldn\u2019t even get rid of all the knights who had come at him. Each knight was above Expert, and most of them were advanced; perhaps he had gathered only the best among the order.Yulis\u2019 skills were far superior to the knights since he was a Master, but the problem was that his endurance had a limit, since his physical body hadn't reached the 6th circle yet.A quick look at tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w will leave you more fulfilled.\u201cCough! Hack!\u201d Coughing up a large amount of blood, Yulis collapsed. He kept wheezing on the ground.Count Colio slowly approached Yulis. He hadn\u2019t taken a single step after taking out his sword; Yulis\u2019 attacks had all been blocked by the tag-teaming from the Expert level knights. Colio asked Yulis in a scolding manner, \u201cWhy did you come all the way here?\u201dYulis chuckled weakly and replied, \u201cI came to protect.\u201d\u201cWho? That princess? Or the residents who are dead? Or Prince Davey, who is probably being dragged here right about now?\u201d Colio asked.Yulis\u2019 eyes grew wide. \u201cWh\u2014What\u2026are you\u2026\u201d\u201cElder Yulis. Did you really think we were stupid enough to come here without a plan? All the residents are probably killed by the remaining knights on the territory by now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026.\u201d The veins in Yulis\u2019 eyes popped as he shouted in rage, \u201cAhhhh!!!\u201dThen, he screamed with everything he had and tried to help himself up. Slash!! However, he was forced back onto the floor with a terrifying slicing sound.\u201cKeugh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve run away if you wanted to save someone. You should\u2019ve escaped the territory with as many people as you could have gathered and run somewhere far away.\u201d Count Colio bitterly said to Yulis, but he seemed to be directing his words elsewhere.Yulis stared at Colio in anger while he was on the ground. Then, he heard Lington mocking him while he was trying to hold onto his consciousness.\u201cClass-5 Yulis, did you think that you had to step up and rescue everyone? Or\u2026 Do you have feelings for this princess?\u201d Lington mocked Yulis.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen you really are a fool! Ahahaha!\u201d As Lington laughed at Yulis, the knights who were standing in line began smirking as well. Lington then tapped Winley\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt seems to be the latter\u2026 Well, she does have a pretty face.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Ahh\u2026 Ahhh!!!!\u201d Yulis tried to get up at once, but that was impossible to do. Count Colio had cut the tendon in his leg.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I think I like her. I will definitely use her well as a subject.\u201d\u201cLington!!!\u201d Yulis clenched his jaw with bloodshot eyes. All he could do was scream on the ground. Mages didn\u2019t believe in God, but if Yulis\u2019 belief or faith could do something right now, he wanted to pray to be able to stand up, or maybe\u2026\u201cGet rid of him, Count Colio. He cannot just die, so don\u2019t kill him,\u201d Lington instructed.\u201c\u2026As you wish.\u201dYulis stared vacantly at Count Colio, raising the sword in his blurry view. Swish\u2026 His ears rang, and that was when he heard a faint sound of something being cut through. No one else had seemed to notice, but it was strange how loud and clear it sounded to Yulis. He realized that the source of the sound was right behind him.Count Colio\u2019s sword was struck with Lington\u2019s hearty laughter. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything alone in life! You have figured that out far too late. Hahahaha!\u201dThud!!! However, even before Colio\u2019s sword landed, something black interfered so swiftly and naturally. It sounded like something heavy had been cut.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you worthless piece of garbage. There are strong enemies that one can\u2019t face alone, but you guys are not them.\u201d[Devil Ylgr\u2019s Exploding Fist][Immediately Transforming Ball of Penetration][Piercing Strike]Crack.\u00a0With a bone-cracking sound, a black fist struck Count Colio right in the stomach. A deep red flame flashed for a moment.34. Where Are You Going?It was said that most of a human\u2019s vulnerable spots were gathered in the center of the body: the head, forehead, philtrum, chest, stomach, dantian, and gonads. One would be knocked out no matter where they were hit.Boom!!! With a heavy explosion, the surrounding was ablaze with a deep red flame. The flame gradually went away to reveal a figure on the ground.\u201cD\u2014Davey\u2026\u201d Yulis sounded like he was dying.Perserque clicked her tongue.-He\u2019s almost dead.Feeling bad for Yulis, Davey immediately put his hand on him and began to quietly mumble a prayer.[This is your little lamb asking. I am going to borrow your amazing grace.]Davey\u2019s prayers were still as disrespectful as ever. However, the power that followed was no joke.[7th Level Holy Magic][Sanctuary]It was a wide field of constant recovery.Whoosh!!!! A white energy flowed out of Davey\u2019s body with a dense sound and surrounded Yulis, creating a separate area.The miracle of the 7th level was that it reverted humans back to their inherent state. There were some injuries that regular recovery magic that used holy power couldn\u2019t heal, leaving behind a scar even if one had poured their power out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, there was a type of grace in highly advanced holy magic above the 7th level. It disregarded the notion that recovery magic with holy power couldn\u2019t completely heal everything.Davey had three types of power right now: holy power, devil mana, and normal mana. Ironically, the most developed power among the three was holy power; although, it was thanks to using his damn 9th level holy power.Yulis, who was losing consciousness, slowly looked up at Davey with wide eyes. Feeling a warmth surrounding him, he murmured, \u201cP\u2026Prince Davey?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still going to call me by my title?\u201d Davey replied.\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dYulis looked dumbfounded by Davey\u2019s short thank you.\u201cI don\u2019t forget favors.\u201d Then, Davey slowly pulled out Blue Ribbon with one hand. \u201cNor do I forget enemies.\u201dYulis seemed to be surprised by Davey\u2019s unexpectedly low voice.* * *[Even if it\u2019s a single strike, it\u2019s best to hit wherever causes the most damage.]\u2018Did you say that you created these skills here?\u2019[Ah, right. You know that thing that Eva always makes\u2026 That thing. A stickman! That gave me inspiration for this.]It was just shocking that this unbelievable fighting skill had been created by a stickman.Davey calmly stared at the silent Count Colio, who had been thrown into the wall by his attack. He then walked past the frozen knights and headed straight toward Count Lington.\u201cPrince Davey? How did you\u2026\u201d Count Lington asked.\u201cSeriously. You are foolishly brave,\u201d Davey commented.Slice!\u201cHm? Kuh?!\u201dCrash!!\u201cGet out of the way. You\u2019re going to splatter blood on Winley.\u201dLington\u2019s eyes almost popped out when one of his arms was cut off in an instant. And even before a panicked scream could escape from his mouth, a strong, invisible wind blew him away and sent him crashing into the back wall.\u201cDon\u2019t die. Live,\u201d Davey commanded Lington.\u2018Live so that I can cut you into pieces myself.\u2019 Choosing not to say more, Davey stared at the knights in front of him.\u201cHow many people ganged up on one person?\u201dAlthough Mencius had said that no one could win against a group ganging up on them\u2026-I don\u2019t know who Mencius is, but I don\u2019t think he said something like that\u2026Perserque pouted when Davey ignored her.\u201cAhhh!! Ha\u2026 Groan!!\u201d Lington was stuck in the back wall, screaming in panic.Count Colio couldn\u2019t get up after being slammed against the wall, and the knights were staring at him, dumbfounded. \u2018What a sight.\u2019\u201cSir, how did you\u2026 Never mind! You have to get out of here! These people are dangerous!\u201d Yulis urgently shouted.Davey calmly stared at the knights. He replied, \u201cYou should take care of yourself first.\u201d\u201cSir!\u201d\u201cW\u2014What are you all doing?! Kill that damn guy!! Kill him!!\u201d Lington furiously shouted while squirming on the ground.Upon Lington\u2019s command, the knights who had been glancing at one another finally held up their swords anxiously.\u201cSir!! These people are all experts in tag-teaming! Be care\u2026\u201d Yulis urgently warned.\u201cKeugh\u2026\u201d\u201cKeh\u2026\u201dThe knights were only at the Expert level at best; Davey was far more enlightened in swordsmanship than them. The job of a sword-wielding knight didn\u2019t require a lot of mana; Davey had to keep in mind the difference in basic physical abilities, but it wasn\u2019t like he did nothing in the meantime.\u2018Hm, three of my strength buffs ended.\u2019Furthermore, the multiple buff spells that Davey was casting over and over again, and the precision of Red Ribbon, were making up for what Davey lacked.We are bit.ly/3iBfjkV, find us on google.The knights came at Davey, sticking to a hit-and-run tactic; it seemed that they were going to charge in at him and then retreat after blocking his attack. However, they could only get away from him after a beheading from Davey\u2019s [Aura] and sword.\u201cHas the tag-team strategy changed to a parade of suicides nowadays?\u201d Once Davey asked mockingly, the life drained out of the knights\u2019 faces. They were probably afraid to charge at him recklessly, because their colleagues had splattered blood and died every time Davey\u2019s red eyes and a red energy flashed.\u201cW\u2014What is this\u2026\u201d Yulis was also in disbelief at this situation. \u201cPrince Davey\u2026 How did you\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe what he had witnessed, so he struggled to understand what was going on.\u201cMoan\u2026\u00a0What are you all doing?! Hurry up and kill him!\u201dAlthough Lington was screaming at the knights, Davey could see that the knights couldn\u2019t approach him as easily as before. He thought, \u2018What good would tag-teaming be when a third of them died from just two attacks?\u2019Tag-teaming was a tactic that drained the enemy, taking turns to attack and retreat until the enemy grew tired. But since the knights all died when it was their turn to attack, this wasn\u2019t a tag-teaming battle\u2026 It was more like moths to a flame.\u201cHup\u2026\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s weird, right?\u201dThe knights all flinched at Davey\u2019s question.\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d Davey firmly held onto Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon, then put all his weight on his foot and shot up into the air. \u201cRed Ribbon and Blue Ribbon, it\u2019s time to play.\u201d[Red Ribbon is going to play!!][B\u2014Blue Ribbon, too! I\u2019m going to help!][Transcendental Longsword][Double Sword Technique][Mountain Crush]Crack!!\u00a0The combination of the [Landing Technique of a Thousand Weights] and [Mountain Crush], which contained all of Davey\u2019s strength, traveled down his swords and struck down on the knights as two large waves.The Knights of Destruction were shocked by the sudden expansion of Davey\u2019s [Aura Blade] and released their own [Aura] to block it. If one person couldn\u2019t, two people would work together. If two people couldn\u2019t, then more people would help out. Instinctively realizing that the attack was dangerous, everyone of the order rushed in, but they overlooked one thing.\u2018Cut them.\u2019Slice\u2026\u00a0The knights had disregarded the fact that they weren\u2019t going to be slashed because they were weaker, but because the sword would cut through them along with their [Aura] like paper. When they realized that, their heads were already up in the air and their bodies were on the ground. Splatter!!! A terrifying sound echoed throughout, and the white wall and ground turned red. It was a horrendous slaughter scene, but no one was sickened by the sight.Slice. As soon as Davey took care of the surroundings, he approached Winley and cut the ropes that were binding her with Red Ribbon. He held her in his arms before walking over to Yulis.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Perhaps the slight disturbance had nudged Winley awake. Her eyelids trembled before she slowly regained her consciousness. With a faint gasp, she looked up at Davey in surprise. \u201cOh\u2026 B\u2026 Brother?\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re not hurt anywhere?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cPardon? Oh\u2026 Yes.\u201d Winley mumbled, not knowing what had happened. However, she widened her eyes at the intense scent of blood. Her face went pale when she saw the room. \u201cB\u2014Brother! What is\u2026 Scream! Brother!!\u201dWInley, who was looking around in shock, suddenly screamed. With bulging eyes, she had glanced behind Davey to see Count Colio, who had been unconscious until a little while ago, swinging his sword with a nasty killing aura.Clang!!!! Davey blocked Count Colio\u2019s attack with his sword, but he was still knocked back by quite a distance. It was as if the buff magic spells he used weren\u2019t enough for him to match up to Colio\u2019s strength.\u201cB\u2014Brother! Are you alright?!\u201d Winley widened her eyes, looking like she would shed tears at any minute if there was even a scratch on Davey.\u201cYulis.\u201d Davey quietly called out to Yulis, then he sat Winley down beside Yulis. \u201cPlease keep Winley safe.\u201d\u201cL\u2026 Leave it to me.\u201dDavey nodded to Yulis, who stuttered as he answered, and lightly stretched his neck. Crack\u2026 Crack.\u00a0He cracked his neck, then said, \u201cHow could a Swordmaster be so shameless and attack me from the back?\u201d\u201cYou. Is that a demon sword?\u201d Colio asked. He didn\u2019t think that Davey could be a Master. He commented, \u201cIt is a sword too dangerous for a greenhorn like you.\u201d\u201cWho are you calling a greenhorn?\u201d\u201cI will be taking that sword.\u201d After such determined words, Colio charged at Davey again with a terrifying killing aura. Although Davey had blocked Colio\u2019s surprise attack, Colio was still a Swordmaster; his specialty was fighting head-to-head.And Davey\u2019s specialty was going head-to-head as well. \u2018He\u2019ll die too fast if I just slash him.\u2019\u00a0Davey nodded as he glanced at the swords in his hands, then threw Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon behind Count Colio, which was where Count Lington was.Stab!!\u201cKahh!!!\u201d Lington, who was scuttling away, slammed against the wall again.When Count Colio slightly staggered at Lington\u2019s scream, Davey didn\u2019t miss his chance and rushed in. Then, he pushed down on the ground with all his strength and shot up into the air. Crash!!!\u00a0He made another hit on Colio\u2019s unguarded gut.\u201cKeugh!! Groan!\u201dDavey was astonished at how Colio still managed to get back up from the ground even though he had breathlessly rolled on the ground. However, Davey would gladly choose to have him as a sandbag.Boom!!\u201cUgh!\u201d Colio was pushed back once again. He couldn\u2019t even scream. He simply rolled on the floor after being hit by Davey\u2019s fist, which had struck him precisely in his gut, without even being able to defend himself.\u2018How could you defend yourself when you can barely breathe?\u2019And the moment Count Colio stumbled without holding a proper stance, Davey\u2019s fist immediately hit his gut again.\u201cGroan\u2026 Kah!!\u201d When Davey\u2019s fist struck his gut once more, Count Colio stumbled and fell onto his knees with bulging, red eyes and a clenched jaw. \u201cY\u2026You bastard!!! Groan\u2026 Kah!!\u201d He shouted angrily, \u201cStop aiming for my gut, you cheap bastard!\u201dDavey pushed himself up from the ground and charged at Colio, who was almost kneeling on the ground and shouting furiously.Count Colio instinctively let go of his sword and protected his gut with his hands, but\u2026This time, Davey broke Colio\u2019s guard with his knee instead of his fist, and he rushed in. \u201cThere are no dirty and cheap tricks in fighting.\u201d He struck Count Colio\u2019s gut again.* * *Perhaps Colio was able to tolerate the continuous attacks on his vulnerable spots because he was a Swordmaster. He endured the attacks quite well, but he was disappointingly weak. He didn\u2019t lack skill, since he used to be a soldier of the powerful Lyndis Empire and was the royal palace\u2019s captain after that. However, Colio didn\u2019t have half of his former strength and Davey had noticed this very early on.-It\u2019s all the same according to someone that had failed after trying too hard to raise his level.They had been given their life sentence of swordsmanship. It was a burn-out that people experienced when they tried to raise their level to the extreme without sufficient preparation. The word \u2018burn-out\u2019 didn\u2019t exist in this world, but the phenomena was similar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cEven if I asked, I assume you won\u2019t tell me why you are working with that man, right?\u201d Davey asked and calmly walked toward Count Colio.Count Colio backed away from Davey to put space between them. He initially thought that Davey was being strengthened by the demon sword, but he was still being bombarded by strong attacks after Davey had abandoned the swords. Only now did he realize that Davey needed no external help for strength. \u201cWho are you\u2026\u201dHumans weren\u2019t perfect. Davey was able to use advanced holy magic and was at a Master level in swordsmanship. He also had the physical abilities of a Fist Master. It made no sense how Davey was able to reach this level at his age.\u2018Well, a genius of the century might be able to achieve one of those things.\u2019\u201cI saw, on the way here, that you transplanted monster cells on a human body.\u201dWe are bit.ly/3iBfjkV, find us on google.Yulis widened his eyes in shock.\u201cHmm, did you get involved to recover your broken body?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cShut up!!\u201d Colio screamed in fury. He would normally attack by now, but he reflexively raised his trembling hand to protect his gut instead. He was being extremely cautious.\u201cNow I\u2019m beginning to think of something crazy. The ones who gave the barbarians the poison containing the virus to spread disease in this territory\u2026\u201d Davey glanced at Lington. \u201cIt was you guys, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dShriek!\u201cI guess I\u2019m right. You guys are pieces of human garbage.\u201dThese people had unleashed bioterror on a completely regular territory to find the disease\u2019s cure. And with the funding they had received, they were conducting secret experiments. Understanding the situation, Davey commented, \u201cIf this gets out, I don\u2019t think it will just end with the organization being destroyed.\u201dThe medical organization, which was founded with good intentions, had intentionally infected people with a virus. They had kidnapped people to conduct secret human experiments. This was a world where a commoner\u2019s life was valued similarly to a fly\u2019s, and it was the nobility who enforced such beliefs.But there was still something called human virtue. Davey found it funny that the nobility would try coming for him, especially when he had caught them doing such atrocious acts.\u201cGroan\u2026\u00a0Ugh\u2026 C\u2026 Count Colio!\u201d Lington desperately called for Count Colio while moaning in pain.\u201cBe quiet!!\u201d However, Count Colio looked tense; he seemed very nervous and wasn't able to approach Davey easily.-Enough, Davey.\u2018Hm, I guess so.\u2019Davey chuckled and relaxed his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s stop going for the gut, then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Count Colio remained silent at Davey\u2019s mocking.Boom!!\u00a0Keeping his guard up, Colio suddenly took a step forward and came at Davey. He didn\u2019t give up, making an [Aura Blade] with his sword by using every last drop of mana left inside him. This was seemingly his final attack.\u2018I guess an old eagle is still better than a young crow.\u2019Even though Colio was a ruined Swordmaster, his power was too strong for Davey, who had an abnormal balance of power, to block. Davey was only overwhelmingly superior to Colio when it came to the experience of, and the observation of, sudden opportunities in battle.\u201cHup.\u201d Davey precisely measured the distance between himself and Colio, who was charging at him like a cannonball, in millimeters.The advantage of martial arts was that one could move more freely and faster in close proximity than using a sword. When Colio\u2019s movement was off\u2026 Crack! Cracking the ground beneath him, Davey shot up and directly planted his fist on Colio\u2019s face.\u201cHup!!\u201dThe moment Colio let down his guard to instinctively protect his face using his sword, Davey forcibly changed the direction of his fist. \u2018Haha! You were tricked again, youngling!\u2019[Devil Ylgr\u2019s Exploding Fist][Unwavering Body][Gut Crusher]Once again\u2026 Boom!\u201cKuk!?!\u201dBoth fists slammed right into Count Colio\u2019s gut another time. Davey could hear someone murmur that he was cheap and dirty, but he still kept his gaze focused on Count Colio.Thud!! The shock wave from Davey\u2019s attack sent Count Colio flying. He hit the floor and rolled around in pain. Coughing up blood, he stared at Davey with empty eyes. \u201cYou\u2026 cheap\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you one to say something when you couldn\u2019t even block the attack?\u201dCount Colio widened his eyes at Davey\u2019s murmur. Colio faced the simplest fact that he had forgotten about due to the absurdity of this battle: he was completely outmatched by Davey in terms of basic competency. He was filled with jealousy, envy, and anger about the unknown level Davey had reached. Colio\u2019s eyes looked nothing but empty, especially after a mix of emotions flickered through them, and his old yet strong body slowly lost its power. He fell to the ground.-He\u2019s still alive\u2026 Maybe you weakened your blow too much.\u2018No, that guy is just tough.\u2019The difference between the overall power of an Expert and a Master was almost indescribable, since it was too nuanced and detailed. Furthermore, Count Colio was someone who had an outstanding level of power, which made him the Captain of the Royal Palace Knights; he wouldn\u2019t have let go of his sword if he was completely fine.-Then, you should at least stop his breathing.\u2018He\u2019s bound to die anyway.\u2019\u201cBro\u2026ther,\u201d Winley whispered.Davey approached Yulis and Winley; she didn\u2019t know the exact details, and Yulis didn\u2019t understand the situation that took place right before his eyes.\u201cSir,\u201d Yulis called out.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Davey asked calmly.Yulis smiled bitterly. \u201cI\u2026 I really caused a nuisance. Anyway\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Count Colio ambushed the tent while I was away, and the medication\u2026\u201d Yulis trailed off, and he spoke as if he was responsible for what had happened. He seemed to think that all of the medication, which was the only thing keeping the dying patients alive, had been destroyed by the fire.Everyone couldn\u2019t be cured by the amount of medication that Davey had given to Baron Gorneo in the beginning. The medication would never be enough, because it had to be administered to all patients continually.\u201cOh, that? It\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s my fault for not setting up a proper defense.\u201dYulis widened his eyes, surprised that Davey made it seem like it was no big deal. He asked, \u201cPardon? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf I died, the treatment method would\u2019ve just disappeared. Lington wouldn\u2019t have just abandoned it.\u201dYulis nodded in understanding.Davey smiled. \u201cSo, head back. I\u2019m leaving Winley to you.\u201d\u201cSir, what about\u2026\u201d\u201cI will join you once I take care of the remaining men.\u201d\u201cOh! C\u2014Count Lington has\u2026!\u201d As if she had just remembered, Winley shouted in surprise.Count Lington, who had been pinned up against the wall from Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon penetrating his shoulder, was nowhere to be seen. The two swords had been thrown onto the ground, and a trail of what seemed to be his blood left a trail leading outside of the room.\u201cOh no! He has run away\u2026!\u201d Yulis exclaimed.\u201cSo, head back first,\u201d Davey urged.\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry. With the state my mana is in right now\u2026\u201d\u201cJust stay still.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d Yulis, who looked confused and surprised, opened his eyes wide.Mages at the 5th circle could use a type of teleportation magic. However, the range was only about five to eight kilometers. Davey had also contemplated whether he should use it when traveling from the Heins Territory to the Ordem Territory, since the 5th circle was the highest level of mana he could use right now.\u201cW\u2014What?! Sir, you can even use magic?!\u201d\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201d Davey then snapped his fingers with a smile.When Winley and Yulis, who both looked utterly shocked, instantly vanished, Davey picked up Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon from the ground. He only did so after making sure that Winley and Yulis, who had disappeared without a trace, were no longer under the influence of magic.\u201cHe treated someone else\u2019s daughter like crap.\u201d Davey joked around, but his face was strangely tense, and it didn\u2019t seem like his facial expression was going to relax anytime soon. The fact that they had used Winley in this ruse angered him more than this damn situation itself.* * *\u201cGroan\u2026 Hup\u2026 Shriek!\u201dLington\u2019s escape was just a desperate struggle. Davey followed the trail of blood to see Lington standing beside a huge control facility. The man\u2019s left arm was cut beneath his elbow, and both his shoulders were ripped apart. Davey could tell his desire to live was quite great from how he was enduring the excruciating pain.\u201cYou monster\u2026\u201d Lington stammered.\u201cWho is calling who a monster?\u201dSwish!!! Clang!!! In an instant, Davey\u2019s whip-like [Aura Blade] flew toward Lington like it was going to cut him, leaving a red afterimage. However, his [Aura Blade] went nowhere near Lington and was shattered by a pink energy that suddenly appeared in front of him. The pink energy had seemingly been waiting for an attack.\u201cHe\u2026 Hehe. This is why people should have one final trick up their sleeve.\u201dDavey silently looked down at his trembling hand. He thought about the pink energy barrier that couldn\u2019t be slashed by the [Aura Blade], which could cut through most magic. \u2018It\u2019s pretty durable.\u2019\u00a0It felt like the air was blocking his attack more so than a physical barrier. \u2018A barrier made from forcing a lot of mana together\u2026 This must\u2019ve been expensive.\u201dAfter putting away Red Ribbon, Davey stared at Lington calmly.Lington pulled out a remote-control device and began using it; at the same time, his body started fading away.\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough, you monster.\u201d Lington was disappearing slowly, but how he was vanishing seemed similar to what would happen when one used a mana gate, a well-known ancient remain.-He\u2019s trying to run away!Perserque shouted at Davey in surprise.\u201cWhat are you going to do now? Going to slash me? Ahahaha! Sure! Try slashing me if you want!\u201d Lington threw his disfigured monocle onto the ground in irritation and shouted with his chest puffed up. Then, he put on a crazy smile and glared at Davey. \u201cI never let off someone who bothered my work. Just wait. One day I will throw you into an experiment room alive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\u201cKehehe\u2026 Kehehe\u2026 Kahahaha!!\u201d With a smirk on his face, Lington began laughing at Davey and looking down on him.\u2018Perhaps this situation is funny to him.\u2019\u201cNo matter how extraordinary you are, you are still nothing but a human! I have all the medicine you made, and you did not save anyone in the end! You can\u2019t save anyone now, and you won\u2019t be able to after I\u2019m gone!\u201d Lington\u2019s laughter was filled with insanity, echoing throughout the entire control facility.\u201cKehehehe! Well, alright. Do you have any last words?\u201dSeeing Lington speak as if he was granting Davey a favor, Davey pulled out Blue Ribbon without hesitation. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAn activated mana gate excluded the activator from the laws of physics; this meant that Lington\u2019s blurry, faded body was already on the other side of the second dimension.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However\u2026-It can slash everything, even things that don\u2019t exist in the physical world.The thing was, Davey still had a way of catching Lington, who had planned to escape by running past the second dimension.Slice!! With an eerie sound of skin being sliced, the mana that was being emitted powerfully stopped at once. Then, Count Lington felt a strange touch on his skin; his eyes widened in shock as he saw the shining blade on his neck.\u201cHow is this\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want to know? It\u2019ll cost 500 gold coins.\u201dSplatter!!\u00a0Hot, red blood splashed all across the control room.35. I\u2019ve Always Wanted to Try ThisClop clop clop clop clop!!! About two hundred cavalries quickly ran past Ordem Territory\u2019s gates and entered the territory.\u201cYour Highness! There are bodies!\u201d\u201cDamn it! What happened in the meantime\u2026 Baron Gorneo!!!\u201d The boy who was leading the calvaries took off his armor and shouted urgently. The boy was Baris, the actual seigneur of the Ordem Territory, Winley\u2019s twin brother, and Davey\u2019s younger brother. His return was much later than expected. He shouted again, \u201cSearch the place! The First and Third Order, hurry and take Count Lington and Count Colio into custody! Don\u2019t overdo it, and back away if they resist! Second Order, search for Baron Gorneo! All the others, protect the residents!\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201d\u201cRemember! We are not fighting to the death! Rescue as many as you can!\u201dAfter the knights gave an affirmative and scattered, Baris quickly got on his horse and rode fast.Most of the residents had stopped working and were taken to a quarantine facility after the outbreak of this disease. As such, the territory\u2019s former liveliness had disappeared in a few days, and it was now just filled with desolation.\u2018What happened?\u2019\u00a0Baris could tell that someone had slaughtered the Knights of Destruction from the blood stains and the bodies that were everywhere. \u2018Did Baron Gorneo\u2019s and Lington\u2019s knights fight because Lington did something while I was gone?\u2019Baris, who was ruffling his hair in irritation from the complicated situation, could see more bodies as he rode further into the territory. When he arrived at the treatment center with a pale face, he widened his eyes in shock at the pile of corpses in front of the center. \u201cTh\u2014They\u2019re all part of the Knights of Destruction?!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just one or two bodies, but dozens of them. There were enough corpses to assume that all of the Knights of Destruction in the territory had died.Without hesitation, Baris entered the treatment center as if he was possessed by something. Even though there was an air-borne disease running rampant, it didn\u2019t seem to be a big deal to him. When he entered the center, he could see Baron Gorneo quietly treating patients as if the outside situation didn\u2019t matter. \u201cBaron Gorneo!\u201d\u201cHm? Oh! Your Highness, have you returned?\u201dBaris\u2019 eye twitched at Gorneo\u2019s peaceful tone of voice. He said, \u201cYes, we searched the barbarians\u2019 base and found evidence, just like you said we would. I understand that we sent a messenger pigeon, but what happened?\u201d Baris was full of questions about the current situation and the pile of dead knights outside.Baron Gorneo had joined the territory\u2019s coalition later than the other people. Because of the territory\u2019s terrible state, Baris had transferred most of the coalition\u2019s rights and had just been waiting anxiously. However, after Baron Gorneo had arrived at the territory, he had heard something from Baron Gorneo that was hard to believe: someone could\u2019ve intentionally spread this disease because of Count Lington\u2019s trickery.Baris had left the territory with an excuse that he was leaving to prevent exposure to the disease. Winley, who was the only family he had to protect, had left the territory. He had felt a sense of relief that she wouldn\u2019t return until after his return. Then, he had found a few potion bottles with the coalition\u2019s symbol buried in the ground after searching for a few days. He had come right back after finding them, so he didn\u2019t understand the situation right now, since he hadn\u2019t been away for too long.Trying his best to soothe his overwhelming surprise, Baris asked out of frustration, \u201cWhat\u2026 What happened here?\u201d\u201cPrince Davey came,\u201d Baron Gorneo replied.\u201cBig Brother?!\u201d\u201cAnd he developed a cure as if it was nothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Baris\u2019 eyes widened at the surprising news.\u201cYes, to be honest, I was completely astonished as well. The doctors of the coalition couldn\u2019t discover anything about this disease, even though they have studied it for years; however, His Highness figured out the disease in just three days.\u201d\u201cThen, what about the bodies of the knights\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where the problem began. It seemed that Count Lington had something else in mind, and he planned to kill us all with his knights.\u201d\u201cWh\u2014What about Big brother?! Then, what happened to Winley?!\u201dBaron Gorneo answered calmly, \u201cNow now, calm down. It\u2019s nothing to be worried ab\u2026\u201d\u201cNothing to be worried about?! The cure for the disease is important, but Big Brother and Winley are more important to me! What happened to Big Brother?! And what about Winley?!\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are safe, right? Tell me!! If something has happened to the two\u2026 Especially if anything happened to that fool of a Winley, who blindly trusts people!!\u201d Baris shouted angrily as a question sounded behind him.\u201cIf something happened?\u201d\u201cI will get my revenge, even if it means going to war with the Empire\u2026\u201d Baris, who was shouting in anger with bloodshot eyes, stopped for a moment. Then, he turned his head awkwardly. It was as if he was a broken robot.\u201cHm\u2026 It seems that Prince Baris cares for you, Lady Winley, much more than you have said.\u201d Yulis remarked.\u201cHey\u2026 Why aren\u2019t you acting like your usual self\u2026\u201dSilence filled the treatment center.* * *Lington froze up, his eyes still wide open in shock. He didn\u2019t know how he had been slashed or how the magic, which had already been activated, had been canceled. His gaze was fixed on Davey with sorrow and confusion, but Davey had no obligation to tell the dead of Blue Ribbon\u2019s OP abilities.-He became a gruesome body in the end.\u201cHe should\u2019ve thought about this before doing something so inhumane. Anyway, I didn\u2019t want to kill him this easily.\u201dDavey found six liquid-filled bottles while searching through Lington\u2019s tattered up and limp body. They were the cure for the \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019 that he had made in the past three days. The only people who knew how to make this were himself and Baron Gorneo. It seemed like Lington had kept all the samples, since he didn\u2019t know what the medicine was exactly made of. After all, this particular cure was worth quite a high value right now.-What are you going to do with this place?\u201cWe should destroy it a\u2026\u201dBoom!!!It seemed that there was no need for that.-What is this?!Davey pulled out [Aura Blade] with Red Ribbon when he suddenly saw the buildings shaking. Then, he cut through the ceiling without hesitation and shot up. \u201cJust destroy all of it. There\u2019s no need to clean them up one by one.\u201dIt was just as Davey said; it seemed like Lington had planned to blow this place up before he left to destroy all the evidence. And as Lington had intended, the explosions came from the basement and were blowing up the place to leave absolutely no trace.-Davey, look.Davey heard Perserque\u2019s voice from his shoulder as he was dodging the falling pieces and jumping off of them. He asked, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d-ChimeraDavey\u2019s face was filled with shock as Perserque mumbled. He instantly recognized what it was. \u2018I guess the dark mage was here.\u2019A quick look at tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w will leave you more fulfilled.Half of the chimeras were being killed by the splintering building. The only ones who could escape were those with the ability to fly and the larger size.-Grrr!!-Roar!!The chimeras\u2019 small number multiplied in seconds to become hundreds, and they all simultaneously began heading in one direction.-The Ordem Territory!Instantly realizing where the chimeras were going, Perserque shouted with big blinking eyes.Davey immediately stopped the strange-looking chimera that was closest to him. The chimeras were large monsters that were about four to five meters tall. They had muscles similar to ogres, a skin color similar to trolls, and their strange appearance made it difficult to think that they were living things.-Their heads and body parts are all over the place.The chimeras had their heads attached to their chests and their eyes to their shoulders. Aside from that, they had mouths all over their bodies. Their appearance was so horrendous that anyone with a weak stomach would vomit.-Roar!!!The monster rushed straight toward Davey upon discovering his presence. It roared, warning him to get out of its way.\u201cIt\u2019s fast, and it\u2019s pretty strong, too.\u201dBoom!! Davey instantly charged at the monster and crushed what seemed to be its head, then flattened the rest of its body. The monster wasn\u2019t completely destroyed, but it still fell to the ground from the fatal blow. However, Davey\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t at all pleased.\u201cIt\u2019s tough. Was its performance extremely maximized by shortening its lifespan?\u201d-If they were used in a short war\u2026\u201cSome of them could\u2019ve already gotten in their hands.\u201dTo be honest, it wasn\u2019t any of Davey\u2019s concern if there wasn\u2019t any direct relation; however, the monsters that had shown up and had spread all over the place were all heading to the Ordem Territory, using the forest to shield them. He sighed. \u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s going to be difficult to catch every single one of them in this large forest.\u201d-Why don\u2019t you just quickly return and defend the territory?There were some chimeras that breathed fireballs like Wyverns. And there would be a substantial level of damage if Davey just left them alone.Davey didn\u2019t think about this for long. As he looked up at the sky, he saw that it was filled with heavy, dark clouds. \u201cHumidity is good.\u201d A light spark popped as he reached his hand out into the air and stimulated his mana. \u201cLet\u2019s go with this.\u201dIf there was no way to stop the chimeras, Davey was going to create his own way to do so; he needed to keep his promise.[5th Circle][Fly]This magic cost a lot of mana, but Davey still used it. As he lightly stimulated his mana and released it, he floated up in the air by an invisible force. At the same time, he pulled out Red Ribbon and slid his fingers down the blade. \u201cOkay, Red Ribbon. Sorry, but I\u2019m going to have to borrow your mana.\u201dIt was commonly known that a mere 5th circle mage could not cast large-scale magic. However, Davey\u2019s mana was around the level of a 5th circle mage, and Red Ribbon\u2019s mana was at the 7th circle. It was possible for him to summon what was already in existence.Davey quickly flew past the chimeras and stopped them in their tracks. Then, he floated Red Ribbon up in the air and clapped his hands together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHup\u2026\u201dBuzz\u2026 At the same time, magic circles began appearing with a purple light and surrounded Davey. There was one in front, one behind, and one on his left, and they came together to form one large magic array.-I\u2019ve never seen that language before\u2026 Is that a rune language?In this world where magic was extremely advanced, there were languages known as \u2018inherent magic\u2019 that could only be used by certain geniuses.Each magic circle was engraved with rune words, which each had its own purpose. Shining individually, they began revolving around the entire magic array. Buzz\u2026 Buzz!!\u00a0The magic circles revolved like a motor, then slowly moved away from Davey and went as far as ten meters before multiplying. The circles were being produced continually, but they all differed in shape. They vibrated with each other according to their unique arrangement of mana.Magic was a study in the anti-physics realm. It was essential to control the natural, intangible forces. Even if lightning were to be made another way, it would be much more efficient to forcibly induce lighting from an existing thundercloud rather than creating one by chance. There was a huge difference between changing the direction of an existing waterway and recreating a waterway by making water and creating a path.The entire area behind Davey was made into the boundary.[Range Lock][Boundary Expansion][Formation Rearrangement]All Davey had to do was get rid of the chimeras running behind him; there really was no need for him to find all of them. Watching the chimeras go into his controlled area without noticing him, he quickly grabbed Red Ribbon that was floating in the air. At the same time, Red Ribbon\u2019s large amount of mana and his mana resonated together and turned on the switch, like a magnet attracting a piece of metal.The mark of a unique rune language began showing up on top of the monsters\u2019 heads.\u201cMan. I really wanted to try this, too.\u201d-What is this\u2026?\u201cDie, you nasty bugs!\u201d\u2018It\u2019s a lightning bolt and not a rain of fire, but it shouldn\u2019t matter, right?\u2019[Catastrophe Spell][Bolt from the Blue]Rumble\u2026 Boom!!! Hundreds of lightning bolts fell from the sky and onto the marked chimeras as Davey lightly swung Red Ribbon in the air.* * *Every one of the chimeras turned to ashes from the lightning bolts that fell from the sky like a merciless barrage. The lightning bolts, which were dormant inside the enormous thundercloud, devoured Davey\u2019s weak trace of mana and shot intense flashes of light that were about 27,000 degrees Celsius toward the monsters.Various types of magic could be shown to the world, but this type of magic was considered too dangerous to ever be taken lightly. If people knew that Davey was using it\u2026Davey felt like life was being drained out of his body from his intense concentration, but he ground his teeth and maintained the boundaries. It would seem like hundreds of lightning bolts were raining on the entire forest from afar.-This was theoretically possible, but\u2026Perserque trailed off and was now staring at Davey like he wasn\u2019t human.-Is this an amount of control that one human being can endure\u2026Shaking her head in disbelief, Perserque stopped when she saw Davey\u2019s pale face.-It would\u2019ve been nice if you told me about the hurt you\u2019ve been trying to endure\u2026Davey couldn\u2019t hear Perserque\u2019s bitter mumbling. He had to maintain the boundaries, even if his brain felt like it was burning with each additional second.* * *Perhaps the monsters\u2019 intelligence was lower to balance out their extremely elevated physical abilities. Like moths to a flame, all the monsters, which seemed to be Lington\u2019s creation, ran into Davey\u2019s controlled area and burned to ashes.-Davey!\u201cWheeze\u2026 Wheeze, I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay.\u201d-Do you know how pale you are right now?!\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to ascend to the 9th circle if I was going to die from this.\u201d Davey didn\u2019t use a lot of mana, but it took a toll on his mental strength. The moment a panting Davey was about to deactivate the magic as the last monster turned to ashes, he saw something strange. \u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019m feeling sick\u2026 This is driving me crazy. I think I might die if I don\u2019t go back and res\u2026\u201dDavey stopped mid-sentence when he saw a carriage boldly enter his unidentifiable boundary. \u2018A carriage? Why is a carriage in a place like this?\u2019Although it was deep in the forest, it wasn\u2019t completely out of the ordinary for a carriage to come in here. The forest wasn\u2019t a particularly rough area. However, on usual days, a carriage would have stopped or turned back if they saw lightning bolts falling from the sky abnormally.\u2018Either they wish to die, or they have a way to dodge my lightning bolts.\u2019However, it didn\u2019t take long for Davey to shake off those thoughts. He saw a hidden group of people following the escaping carriage and killing the escorting knights in quick succession.-That is\u2026Perserque\u2019s eyes sparkled; perhaps she realized what that carriage was at the same time as Davey.-Davey, that\u2019s the symbol of royalty.A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.There was a symbol engraved on the carriage door. This symbol usually represented a family or their affiliate; the problem was that it was of a platinum color. The only people who could have a platinum-colored symbol on this continent were royalty.It wasn\u2019t the Contas Empire, since they were thousands of kilometers to the west, so Davey could only think of two empires: the Pallan Empire and the Lyndis Empire, which were both located in the east. Davey couldn\u2019t recognize the symbol, but it was clear that the carriage was royalty, and that the royalty was being chased by an unknown group of assassins.-Ignore it, Davey. They are not ordinary beings if they are assassins chasing after royalty. If you provoke them for no reason, you might encounter a different type of danger\u2026Even though Perserque expressed her worries, Davey\u2019s gaze was fixed on the carriage since he saw someone looking out from the window with a tense expression. She only looked to be in her late teens, and she was quite tiny. Although she was wearing plain clothing, she had glittering blue hair, and was wearing a strange mask that covered her entire face. Not only that, but she was also wearing white gloves on her hands; it seemed like she was hiding her presence. And this fresh energy that weirdly cleared Davey\u2019s ringing head\u2026\u2018Hm, this scent is that of an elementalist.\u2019\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Davey didn\u2019t think for long.-Davey?Keeeee!!!!\u00a0The magic circles began rotating with speed and resonating again. Davey gathered as much of the thundercloud\u2019s power as possible and left a mark on the assassins who were chasing the carriage. He exhausted all of his mana and created an inducing magic circle.Boom!!!!! A lightning bolt that was incomparably larger than before fell onto the assassins. They probably didn\u2019t know what killed them, but even if they did, they probably wouldn\u2019t think that this ridiculous natural disaster was intentionally caused by someone. Well, at least for now.\u201cOh no! My hand slipped.\u201d-\u2026\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know! I didn\u2019t see anything!\u201d Davey did think that he had met the lady\u2019s gaze through her mask, but it didn\u2019t seem to be a big problem. Then, he quietly called Perserque as he stared at the carriage riding off into the distance. \u201cPerserque.\u201d-Why are you\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026rest.\u201d-Davey!!With those words, Davey began falling to the ground as his vision blurred. \u2018I get extremely sleepy every time I do something huge\u2026\u2019\u00a0Unfortunately, he felt that he couldn\u2019t expect his level to increase as it did before when he had also used the holy magic spell. Sometimes, he couldn\u2019t shake off the thought that he was also stupid.* * *Simply put, Davey slept extremely well. What was he talking about when he always had a good night\u2019s rest? After his sixth sense had improved, there were times he had woken up from a bug crawling on the floor.\u2018There are advantages to having sharp senses\u2026 But\u2026 Sigh\u2026\u2019Sometimes he couldn\u2019t rest comfortably when he wanted to because of those senses. It was like his body reacted first, even when he just wanted to do nothing.As he slowly raised his head after letting out a tired sigh, Davey saw a quiet forest in front of his eyes. \u201cPerserque?\u201d-Oh! Are you awake, Davey?As Davey woke up in a daze, Perserque, who was holding up a large leaf with water, approached him with a bright expression. She couldn\u2019t affect anything in the physical world other than energy forms or Davey, her companion, but she could use her demon power and cause something like a poltergeist phenomenon from time to time. At first, she could only move a piece of paper, but it was clear that her power had become stronger with time.-Have some water first.\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you. I feel better now, after a good rest. How long was I asleep for?\u201d-Only a couple of hours, but\u2026Perserque trailed off with a bitter smile.-I think the Ordem Territory is probably in chaos right now.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Davey calmly got up from where he was sitting and climbed up onto a tall tree. It might\u2019ve been a relief, but it seemed that the territory didn\u2019t send a search group out for him. Well, it wouldn\u2019t have been easy to utilize the army since Baris was gone. With a giggle, Davey said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back. They\u2019re probably worried.\u201dPerserque seemed displeased, but she said nothing.* * *\u201cBig Brother!!\u201dIt was a little unexpected that the person who greeted Davey first wasn\u2019t a resident or the royal guards, but Baris. Davey wondered to himself, \u2018He was absent when I arrived at the territory. When did he get back?\u2019\u201cBaris? When did you return?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since I got back! But are\u2026 Are you okay?!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dExamining Davey\u2019s body in a hurry, Baris let out a sigh of relief when he found nothing wrong. There were no huge issues with Davey aside from the blood stains.\u201cIt\u2019s a relief that you\u2019re not hurt anywhere. You don\u2019t know how surprised I was when I heard that Winley and Class-5 Yulis told me that you were left alone at Count Lington\u2019s hidden facility in the forest\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Baris grit his teeth. \u201cThen, I heard that you stayed back after rescuing the two. I was going to form a rescue group and head there, but\u2026\u201d\u2018You wouldn\u2019t have been able to come.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Considering his character, it was actually amazing that Baris had waited around for three hours. Yulis and Winley ran out after him.\u201cBig Brother!!\u201d Winley quickly came out with a surprised look on her pale face. She ran into Davey\u2019s arms, burying her small physique into his. She asked worriedly, \u201cBig Brother\u2026 Are you hurt anywhere?! Do you know how worried I was?!\u201dOf course, Davey was still over 180 centimeters tall and was pretty muscular. The problem was that everyone else was around 190 centimeters tall or had a huge physique. Because of that, Davey could only be considered to be ordinary, since men with rather small physiques were all around 180 centimeters tall.\u201cHey! I told you not to come out!\u201d Baris shouted at Winley.\u201cShut up! How could I have just sat back and relaxed when Big Brother wasn\u2019t back yet?\u201d Winley shouted after Baris criticized her. She stroked Davey\u2019s cheek and looked like she was going to cry. \u201cBig Brother! Are you hurt anywhere? You\u2019re okay? Right?\u201dSupport us at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine, Winley.\u201d Davey chuckled and patted Winley\u2019s head like usual. As tears began forming in Winley\u2019s eyes, Davey glanced at Yulis and asked, \u201cDid anything happen after you came back?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes, sir. You completely destroyed the place.\u201d Yulis bitterly smiled, as if he was a little sick of it.\u201cHonestly, I should\u2019ve told you this when I first saw you,\u201d Davey told Yulis his exact thoughts. Then, he nodded gratefully. \u201cThank you for keeping my dear sister safe. I will never forget this.\u201dYulis may not have been helpful, but he had gone to the facility to find Winley without considering his own life. And he had done so only after having met Winley a few days ago.\u201cI did nothing. All I know is something bad would\u2019ve happened if you weren\u2019t there, sir.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t even protect Lady Winley when I was by her side, and I am an elder of the Red Tower. It is a shameful reality. Also\u2026 The cure\u2026\u201d Yulis said.\u201cOh, that?\u201d Chuckling, Davey pulled out a pouch from his chest and lightly shook it. \u201cThat guy, Lington, kept most of it safe. I guess it was too valuable to throw away.\u201dYulis nodded in relief.\u201cLet Winley and Yulis stay here for treatment. I did already do some basic treatments, but you never know.\u201d Davey just wanted to let Winley and Yulis rest.Baris then pushed the two inside, not willing to accept any arguments or retorts.Winley, who looked displeased, had no choice but to go inside with a sigh.\u201cAnyway, when did Class-5 Yulis start calling Winley that? Big Brother, do you think he has bad intentions for Winley?\u201d Baris, clearly, was still very worried about his sister.Davey chuckled. He could see Baris showing his wariness of Yulis as soon as Yulis was gone. Then, Davey answered very seriously, \u201cI actually think it\u2019s the opposite\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? No\u2026 That makes no sense. How can Winley, that tomboy\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Baris stared at Davey in disbelief. Then, he shook his head. \u201cI guess you might be right\u2026\u201d Baris kept sighing as if he thought this situation was ridiculous.However, Perserque began joking around and suddenly pulled on Davey\u2019s cheek in this solemn atmosphere. He winced. \u2018Ow, what is it this time?\u2019-You are nothing but an idiot!\u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019-\u2026You are usually pretty smart, but you\u2019ve got this situation wrong. It\u2019s the other way around\u2026Perserque sighed when Davey still didn\u2019t understand. He then muttered to her, \u2018Are you saying that it was Yulis who fell in love with Winley at first sight? That\u2019s nonsense. Then, how do you explain how she acted?\u2019Winley had blushed when she first saw Yulis, and she had been like that since coming to the Ordem Territory. As soon as Davey entered a place where she and Yulis had been alone together, Winley was startled and tried to suppress her embarrassment. She did look like a child hiding something.-I don\u2019t know! Just live without knowing forever!\u2018Man\u2026\u2019\u00a0Davey just shrugged. He thought that Perserque turning away after snapping at him was ridiculous.* * *Baris brought Davey to the seigneur\u2019s palace while telling the latter a part of the situation that had caused this situation. Just like Davey had expected, Count Lington had intentionally spread this disease in the territory by using the barbarians. Davey listened like it was nothing new, but Baris was still fuming.The entire situation was comical. It was like a robber who got caught pretending to be the homeowner after breaking in. The funny thing was that Baron Gorneo had been the one to hint about this fact. At first, he had been strongly against Davey doing anything in this territory; perhaps it had been his way of telling Davey to get out without getting too involved and shedding unnecessary blood.\u201cYou are quick,\u201d Baron Gorneo commented.It seemed that Davey was right.-That\u2019s the truth.Perserque mumbled to Davey as she examined the thoughts in Gorneo\u2019s mind.\u201cTo be honest, I knew that Lington was dangerous, but I couldn\u2019t do anything since I didn\u2019t have any evidence nor was anything revealed. However, now that this kind of thing has happened, it wouldn\u2019t cause any problems for you, right?\u201d Baron Gorneo explained as he administered the medicine that Davey had handed to him.\u201cThat would make no sense. It would be tyrannous of the Empire to protest about this,\u201d Baris pointed out.Baron Gorneo nodded. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s funny how the world works. A small, weak kingdom would have no choice but to keep quiet if someone were to nitpick on them. However\u2026\u201d Baron Gorneo trailed off, then spoke with determination. \u201cI will make sure that this incident causes no problems. Your Highness, your accomplishments aren\u2019t small, and they shouldn\u2019t be glazed over because of this.\u201dAlthough he was one of the weakest council members, Baron Gorneo was determined to not compromise on this.* * *The state of the territory greatly improved once the medicine was replicated and distributed. There was more than that too. A cured patient couldn\u2019t get reinfected, so Davey made Baris introduce a vaccination system to the entire territory.A newborn baby couldn\u2019t have an antibody to this disease. The best possible thing to do was to try to vaccinate people regularly to get rid of this problem. Not only that, but since there were a lot of mercenaries who entered the territory, he made Baris vaccinate them as well to completely get rid of this \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019. However, he couldn\u2019t do anything about the remaining virus yet.\u201cOver three hundred people of the Ordem Territory have died from this.\u201d\u201cAt least that\u2019s the only casualty count.\u201d\u201cDoes that not even phase you?\u201d Jack threw out a question.\u2018Now he knows how to come up and talk. Since it\u2019s come to this, let\u2019s have a chat.\u2019 Davey thought as he sat in his chair, playing around with his mana.He then asked, \u201cIt\u2019s a relief that the disease only caused this much damage. How many residents do you think the Ordem Territory has?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cThe best thing to do in medicine is prevention. What do you think the next best thing is?\u201dJack, or Aina Helishana, answered Davey after some pondering. \u201cFast\u2026recovery and prevention afterward.\u201d\u201cAnd the next thing?\u201d\u201cQuarantine\u2026\u201d\u201cThis damn disease is a mad invader that has no intention of cooperating with an intellectual being. Humans have been at war with these invaders for a long time, and they will keep battling,\u201d Davey pointed out.Jack kept quiet, then said, \u201cYou knew about the disease, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cHow much did you know about it?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Does this have a cost as well?\u201d\u201cI am also an information merchant. I am calculating the precise cost with a point system.\u201dDavey couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Jack\u2019s unexpected response. He answered, \u201cI\u2019m worried that you\u2019re going to ask for an organ or something, because of all the points I\u2019ve accumulated.\u201d\u201cI value my life, so\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom someone who practices medicine, this damn invader is so dangerous that it\u2019s a relief that the disease has been stopped.\u201dJack said nothing.This disease had killed millions of people in another continent. It was dangerous to try treating it as a doctor, so it really was a relief that it had only taken a few hundred people this time; although, Davey did feel a little sorry for the ones who had died.If Davey wasn\u2019t here and this disease had spread outside the territory, half of the eastern continent would\u2019ve been wiped out, starting with the Ordem Territory. No, it could\u2019ve spread to the mid-continent and even created chaos in the entire Tionis continent. Considering that, Lington was truly fearless since this ridiculous virus would\u2019ve spread throughout the continent if even one thing had gone wrong.\u201cYou are very peculiar, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cSo, hurry up and tell me. I think that it\u2019s time to say what you want.\u201d\u201cI need to collect more points. I will serve you with everything I have.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning to ask for that requires you to serve me with everything you have\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just come and work for me?\u201d\u201cAre you going to take me in?\u201dDavey chuckled at Jack\u2019s question before saying, \u201cAm I crazy?\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from or what your past is, but at least take off your disguise if you want to say that.\u2019It was unsure what Jack, or Aina Helishana, felt from Davey\u2019s gaze. But he just stayed silent.* * *Rumble!!! Crash!! The carriage, which was moving roughly, didn\u2019t slow down even after getting out of the forest.\u201cSir Belross! Our pursuers are no longer following us!\u201d\u201cThe horses will not be able to tolerate the journey for much longer!\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 Slow down! Balter! Rock! Keep guarding the surroundings and prepare in case there\u2019s a surprise attack!\u201dThere were seven knights who currently escorted the carriage, but there were far more before.\u201cDamn it, those assassins!\u201d The old knight clenched his jaw in a display of anger. Even if he was a Swordmaster, there was no way he could have avoided sustaining any injuries if assassins attacked them day and night. There was a monstrous being on this continent who was an exception to that rule, but they didn\u2019t know about that.\u201cYour Highness, this is Belross! Are you hurt anywhere?!\u201dAfter the old knight shouted, a coughing sound could be heard from inside the silent carriage. Then, the soft voice of a girl could be heard. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You mustn't come out yet!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Cough\u2026 Cough.\u201d The girl emerged from the carriage. Feeling dizzy from the fast ride, she stumbled a little.At the same time, women who seemed to be the girl\u2019s ladies-in-waiting came out from the carriage. They quickly helped to support her. \u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026 Mary.\u201dShorter than most people her age, the girl also had a small, thin physique. She had a soft yet distinct aura to her, and she looked frail enough to break at any moment. However, she was clearly not human, since she had the beastfolks\u2019 characteristic long ears above her blue ponytail. And seeing her ears sagging from exhaustion or sadness would make anyone feel bad for her\u2026 The girl was a fox with strangely sharp ears. Her tail was hidden beneath her large evening dress. Still, it was clear that she was a fox and not human like her knights.But what was truly strange about the girl\u2026was her face being completely covered by an odd-looking white mask. Coupled with her dress, the girl was entirely covered from head to toe, and not an inch of her bare skin could be seen. Looking at her, one could only tell that she was a young beastfolk.\u201cIs anyone hurt?\u201d The girl directly looked at the knights even though her vision should have been obstructed by her mask.The knights simultaneously bowed toward the girl. \u201cDo not worry, Your Highness. We are ready to put our life on the line for your safety.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see Sir Harlus, or Sir Luxa, or Dame Hivena\u2026\u201d The girl mumbled quietly.All the knights flinched.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 The attack\u2026\u201d The girl lowered her head as if she was choking up. Although the mask hid her expression, it was clear from her choked-up voice that she was quite depressed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry everyone\u2026 Because of a beastfolk like me\u2026\u201d\u201cY\u2014Your Highness!\u201d The ladies-in-waiting bowed toward the girl in shock.\u201cYour Highness! I humbly beg you, please stop your tears!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean that it is because Your Highness is a beastfolk?! That is completely untrue and ridiculous!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! How could anyone say that Your Highness is a lowly presence!\u201dThen, all the knights lined up and kneeled toward the girl. \u201cThe power of the gods was not enough\u2026 And it has caused you sorrow! Please kill us!\u201d\u201cStop it! I\u2026 I don\u2019t want any more people getting hurt because of me.\u201d The girl\u2019s voice grew more teary. She murmured, \u201cYes\u2026 I must regain my strength for Father\u2026 No, for His Majesty.\u201d\u201cThey are insolent assassins who dared to attack the royalty of Lyndis, the great empire of the east. Your Highness, I will definitely get to the bottom of this and kill all of the schemers!\u201d\u201cSir Belross\u2026\u201d The girl spoke in a choked-up voice.The old knight spoke with determination. \u201cI swear on the name of Dark Cloud Sword Belross, Swordmaster of the royal palace. I will\u2026avenge the undeserved deaths of Your Highness\u2019 subordinates.\u201dThe girl definitely wasn\u2019t an altruist; she actually was quite a greedy person. But the knights served her so loyally because she cherished and loved her people with everything that she had. As such, she had the vassals\u2019 love even though she was part beast and was the least powerful among her siblings due to the lack of support. Furthermore, Belross became part of her personal order, which only had about 20 people, even though he had the extraordinary title of a Swordmaster.\u201cThank you... Sir Belross, thank you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness\u2026 I know it\u2019s hard, but please hold on for a little longer. We are almost at the empire\u2019s border.\u201dThe girl, who was sobbing on the ground, soon calmed down. The trembling in her shoulders slowly went away, and she nodded. Then, she stepped back onto the carriage with the help from her ladies-in-waiting. Her strange but adorable ears twitched. \u201cBut Sir Belross, what do you think that thunder was?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but it was hard for me to tell.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, it is difficult to think that it was a natural thunderstorm. I have never heard of a natural phenomenon where hundreds of lightning bolts fall from the sky.\u201d\u201cWhat if it was caused by someone?\u201d\u201cI think that it might be worth a shot to gather all the sages of the continent.\u201dThe knights began whispering as the carriage started moving along. Everyone, including the people in the carriage and those who were guarding it, saw the thunderstorm. If someone told this story to people at a bar over drinks, they would just think that it was drunk nonsense.\u201cCaptain, what do you think it was?\u201d One of the knights asked Belross.\u201cWe can\u2019t know for sure. But\u2026\u201d The old knight, Belross, stopped mid-sentence, then continued in a quiet voice, \u201cIt seemed like those lightning bolts were aimed at the assassins.\u201d\u201cThe lightning bolts chased someone who was running in panic and turned them into ashes. I\u2019ve never seen a lightning bolt turn someone into ashes. It\u2019s definitely abnormal,\u201d one of the knights pointed out.\u201cThe important thing is that we survived. There are a lot of things to think about, but it can\u2019t be understood with common knowledge. If it is true that a human created that\u2026\u201d Closing his eyes, Belross paused before saying, \u201cI think the ranking for the best mages in the continent will immediately change. Well, a human couldn\u2019t have possibly done this anyways.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They wouldn\u2019t be human, but a dragon, the original possessor of magic, from fairy tales if they could cause this kind of catastrophe,\u201d one of the knights said.The knights\u2019 lighthearted conversation went on for a little while.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d The girl, who was listening to the conversation, let out a short, fatigued sigh on the pillowy sofa. None of the other people seemed to have seen it, so she was the only one who had caught a glimpse; her sense of sight, smell, and hearing were exceptionally good compared to humans and even other beastfolks.\u2018\u2026He had black hair\u2026\u2019\u00a0The girl had seen a man floating in the sky with many purple magic circles around him. \u2018And\u2026he saved us for some reason.\u2019It was true that they had made eye contact for a second. Of course, the girl had kept her mask on, but for some reason it felt like the man had looked her straight in the eyes. It had only been for a second, but that was enough to burn that image of him onto her brain.For a moment, the girl\u2019s keen sense of smell caught the man\u2019s scent after the lightning went away. \u2018The scent of dogwood\u2026 It\u2019s faint, but natural and reliable\u2026\u2019\u00a0She squeezed her hand like she was never going to forget this scent, and silently stared at the forest of thunder that she had just escaped from.36. Things That Will Eventually Be Revealed\u201cWould you like to have a drink, Davey, sir?\u201dDavey didn\u2019t know where Yulis was getting all these expensive bottles of liquor from. When Yulis offered a drink with a smile, Davey stared at him with cold eyes. \u2018This guy. I didn\u2019t expect him to like alcohol this much.\u2019\u00a0They had gone through many bottles the day before, and yet Yulis was asking again.\u2018How could he ask again? This isn\u2019t okay.\u2019Despite having such thoughts, Davey said firmly, \u201cOf course. It\u2019s shabby, but please come in.\u201d He could never resist a bottle of liquor that wasn\u2019t bitter and had a nice, deep taste to it.Search tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w for the original.-You should be thankful for not getting intoxicated to the point where you can\u2019t hold yourself up. If that happens, I\u2019ll kick your butt and wake you up\u2026When Davey invited Yulis in while trying to ignore the last part of Perserque\u2019s mumbling, Winley and Baris, who had been patiently waiting behind him, peeked out and giggled. They had been pretty busy with settling the territory\u2019s remaining business, but had taken a break and showed up.\u201cWhere is Baron Gorneo?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cHe feels uncomfortable with such a gathering. He might be feeling a little responsible for this incident, which was clearly the fault of the Coalition for Disease Control, and he was part of it.\u201dDavey didn\u2019t ask further. \u2018I should respect his wishes if that is what he wants.\u2019Baris had made a big decision to accept the remaining people of the coalition, even though they were nothing but criminals who had killed more than three hundred innocent residents.\u201cThey are victims, too. And I\u2019m quite interested about Baron Gorneo\u2019s dedication.\u201d Baris spoke calmly.Winley scoffed. \u201cHeh! How are you going to live life if you\u2019re that kind?\u201d\u201cWhat about you? I wish you would just shut your mouth.\u201d\u201cWhat? Hey!!\u201d Winley screamed, but soon lowered her head because of Davey and Yulis. She avoided their gaze and carefully took a sip of her wine.\u2018You guys are drinking now that you are adults.\u2019\u201cNow that you are adults, you\u2019ll be going to the royal palace after this birthday,\u201d Davey said.\u201cLooking at how things are going at the capital, I\u2019d like to stay silent about that for a while.\u201d Baris chuckled, then stared at Davey. \u201cBig Brother.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cMay I ask you a question?\u201dThe trio looked like they wanted the answer to their questions.Davey had stayed quiet about it for too long. It was possible that he had done something related to magic or swordsmanship, but Yulis, Winley, and Baris probably couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around it. He was a Swordmaster who could use [Aura Blade], and he had the fighting skills to face a Swordmaster head-on without his sword. Not only that, but he also had a stigmata and possessed knowledge of medicine that he had learned from God knows where. Finally, he had also used magic above the 5th circle that transported Winley and Yulis to the Ordem Territory.Was this a power that someone this young could have? Davey could confidently say \u2018NO\u2019 since he had gone down that road before. It would be difficult to possess these powers if he hadn\u2019t spent a twisted thousand years in the Hall.Even Illyna, the genius of the century who had learned swordsmanship when she had begun learning how to read and write, hadn\u2019t even been close to reaching Swordmaster at the age of seventeen. The fact that Davey, who was only seventeen and had spent a third of his life in a coma, could easily reach this level when even Yulis, who was called the greatest prodigy of the continent, barely reached the Master level[1] in his thirties\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t be strange if they asked if a monster was wearing the husk of Davey.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Davey let out a hum.\u201cStop it, stupid! You\u2019re being rude to Big Brother. Are you interrogating him or something?\u201d Winley shouted at Baris.\u201cHey! You were curious, too.\u201dIt seemed that Winley was equally curious, but she just kept that to herself.\u201cActually\u2026 If it\u2019s not a nuisance, may I ask as well?\u201d Yulis glanced at Davey with a wide smile.1. Just a recap, Yulis is at the Entry-master level. \u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He added, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time believing the nonverbal casting, even after seeing it with my own eyes. Also\u2026 I can only feel the mana of an ordinary person or less from you, sir.\u201dYulis was most curious about the nonverbal casting, which was a theoretically impossible system. Davey thought it was at least a relief that they didn\u2019t think the hundreds of lightning bolts that fell on the forest were his doing, since that was just a different level of power entirely.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Davey hummed, then chuckled. He stared at his glass, swirling his wine. \u201cI worked hard.\u201dWinley, Baris, and Yulis were dumbfounded.\u201cPardon?\u201d Yulis asked.\u201cI worked incredibly hard in that short time.\u201dDavey was not lying to the bewildered trio. His time in the Hall had been short; to be honest, even a thousand years were not enough for him to train and understand everything. He had trained from morning to night without rest, and he would even wake up in the middle of the night thinking about his progress. A goblin would laugh at how much effort Davey had put in when he was someone that had detested the heroes\u2019 harsh training. However, the three people seemed to have taken his words in a completely different way.\u201cOh\u2026 Haha! For you to have achieved all that in less than a year is imposs\u2026\u201d Baris teased. He and the others thought that Davey had gotten to this standard from training after he had woken from his coma.\u201cThere are a lot of things that haven\u2019t been proven in the world, Baris.\u201d\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I never said that I did it in a year.\u201dBaris went silent after realizing that Davey had finally given him a serious answer from years of knowing him.\u2018Man, darn these quick-witted kids!\u2019-You know that the quick-witted kid is one of the only people you truly trust, right?\u2018Be quiet.\u2019When you're just trying to make great content at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.Davey couldn\u2019t tell them anything about the Hall. All he could tell them was that he worked hard, even if others protested in disbelief; he could only do the same even when answering his significant other. The only person that knew the truth\u2026-Yawn\u2026\u2026Was this cute student of Ares. Perserque laid down on Davey\u2019s knee like she was in bed and yawned.\u201cYou can only feel the mana of an ordinary person or less from me,\u201d Davey said to Baris.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, how am I using a highly dense [Aura Blade]?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cI will tell you everything when it becomes possible.\u201d\u201cIt must be that way if you say so, Big Brother.\u201d Baris laughed heartily, as if his complicated thoughts had been resolved. \u201cHaha. I\u2019m sorry Class-5 Yulis, but I am just going to believe what he is saying.\u201d\u201cWell, I have no reason to dig up what Sir Davey doesn\u2019t want to speak about, nor do I have the right to.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d Davey thanked Yulis.\u201cBut can you tell me one thing?\u201d Yulis looked motivated.At the same time, Winley put down her glass and stared at Davey. She realized what Yulis was going to ask.\u201cDo you think that\u2026 I can also cast nonverbally?\u201dNonverbal casting was a dream to most mages. Asking someone about their training and achievements was rude, but Yulis still couldn\u2019t help himself. He wanted to know how it was possible with a mage who had a similar circle level, and not someone with an extremely high circle.\u2018Since I am indebted to him, I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to tell him. It\u2019s not anything related to the Hall as well.\u2019\u201cIf you are willing to throw away all the mana circles you have,\u201d Davey told Yulis.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe chances of success are about 10%. There will be a rebound if you fail.\u201d\u201cRebound?\u201d\u201cYour brain will burn. Turn to ashes.\u201dDavey had never seen it happen, but he just believed it to be true. He had heard about this conclusion from the four women who had created it.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you an assignment. Try casting a buff magic spell that you can currently use, like [Strength], five times over.\u201dLife drained out of Yulis\u2019 face as he heard Davey. \u201cI\u2026don\u2019t think I can do that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a 1 in 10 chance that you will succeed if you can do that.\u201dOne should at least be able to cast a spell eight times over if they wanted to give it a try.-What kind of lunatic casts a spell eight times over? I\u2019m telling you that you are the abnormal one.Yulis smiled.It wasn\u2019t easy; from the beginning, Davey thought that creating the type of mana circle that he had was actually harder than making a mana loop of the 9th circle.\u201cI guess everything has a price.\u201dOne\u2019s life would always be more valuable, no matter what.* * *When one problem went away, another appeared.\u201cHmph!\u201dHearing a pouty voice, Davey smiled bitterly. \u201cRed Ribbon, are you still mad?\u201d\u201cPip!!\u201d The adorable red-haired little girl who was pouting and displaying her anger was none other than Red Ribbon. She was already cute, but she was now puffing up her cheeks, which made her look even more adorable. If Davey could, he would\u2026\u201cRed Ribbon, peekaboo!\u201d Davey teased.\u201cGiggle!... H\u2014Hmph!\u201dHowever, Davey couldn\u2019t do this because he had to maintain his face.Just like what had happened with Caldeiras, weapons with an ego that had their own mana would become quite exhausted when their powers were used rapidly. Although Caldeiras was able to handle it since he had grown stronger from being alive for quite a long time, it seemed Red Ribbon, who was only about a month old, couldn\u2019t tolerate the level of exhaustion caused by the amount of mana Davey had used.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Blue Ribbon rubbed her head against Red Ribbon\u2019s back as she hugged the latter, and groaned for Red Ribbon to stop. However, Red Ribbon didn\u2019t budge.\u201cIt\u2019s really good. You\u2019re not going to have some?\u201dRed Ribbon, who had her eyes shut, slightly opened her eyes and glanced at the cookie Davey was quietly shaking in front of her face. But she turned away. She slightly opened her eyes again to glance at the cookie but turned away once more. It was exactly how children acted to show that they were mad: she wanted to eat the cookie, but she wouldn\u2019t because she was mad.Davey felt lightheaded from how cute Red Ribbon looked while she was trying to decide between her desire to eat the cookie and the anger that she felt. The problem was that he wasn\u2019t good with children. Davey put on a bright smile as he shook the cookie. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, then I should eat it all, right?\u201d\u201cOoh\u2026 Hm\u2026\u201d As expected, Red Ribbon, who was trying to disregard the cookie, looked at the cookie with desire in her eyes. However, she still wasn\u2019t willing to budge. \u201cEe\u2026 Woo\u2026\u201dNot knowing what to do, Red Ribbon groaned, and then\u2026 \u201cWahh!!!\u201d She began crying from anger as well as sadness.-You idiot. What are you doing with a child?\u201cOh no\u2026\u201dPerserque hugged Red Ribbon and comforted her. The little girl trembled and began crying even harder. Unlike her usual soft expression, Perserque looked at Davey from the corner of her eye.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Davey stared at Perserque, dumbfounded. Even though she squinted and glared at him, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re able to get bigger?\u201dUsually, Perserque was small enough to be able to sit on Davey\u2019s head or shoulder, but she wasn\u2019t that small anymore; she was short and frail, but she definitely looked like a normal girl.-How difficult did you think it was to transform a nonexistent body made only of demonic force?Perhaps energy forms were able to interact with each other. It seemed like Red Ribbon was able to see and hear Perserque since her own body was also made of energy.-It\u2019s okay.Red Ribbon looked up at Perserque, who was patting her back and comforting her, with teary eyes. \u201cMama\u2026\u201d-M\u2014Mom?!A faint light began spreading as Red Ribbon hugged Perserque, who was shouting in shock. Red Ribbon wasn\u2019t going to let go, yelling, \u201cWahh!! Mama! Mama! I don\u2019t like Dada!\u201dIt was said that crying was contagious in children; perhaps that was why Blue Ribbon started crying and hugging Perserque once Red Ribbon burst into tears again.\u201cWahh!!\u201d\u201cHwahh!!\u201d\u201cI made them cry,\u201d Davey said playfully.Perserque glared at Davey from the corner of her eye.-It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s alright! Don\u2019t worry, Mom\u2019s here!Perserque was the former Demon Lord\u2026 She was quite quick. Demons were known as extremely evil beings in ancient books, but to be honest, one would see that the debate between complete good and evil was completely useless. This was especially true when the person, creature, or demon had emotions.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026 I have more cookies,\u201d Davey teased.\u201cHmph!\u201d-I think you would be so amazing if you sometimes just shut your mouth, which only brings about disaster, Davey.Poor Davey\u2026 The nutty aroma of the cookie in his mouth felt bitter, since he was left speechless.37. From A Place That Couldn\u2019t Be SeenThis luxurious and grand palace was greater than most kingdoms, and it was known as the Dragon\u2019s Palace. This was the enormous royal palace where the emperor of the Lyndis Empire, the most powerful kingdom in the east, resided.In the Tionis continent, there were three large empires and one Holy Empire. There was the Contas Empire, the largest kingdom in the west, which was symbolized by a scorpion with three tails, and the Pallan Empire, the continent\u2019s strongest and long-standing empire that was founded by the Sword Lord\u2019s descendants. Finally, there was the Valchas Empire, the Holy Empire in the east that served the Goddess of Wine Freyja, and the Lyndis Empire, which was symbolized by a two-headed dragon. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the continent\u2019s power was in the hands of these four kingdoms. Furthermore, the Lyndis Empire was no different from an alliance that encompassed the many countries that existed in the east.And Deorte El Lyndis, the current emperor of the Lyndis Empire, was silently shooting arrows in the palace\u2019s garden that only royalty could enter. Shh\u2026. Crack!! The target was a few hundred meters away, but he kept pulling his bowstring. Every time his hand left the string, his arrow cut through the wind and struck the thick, wooden target without fail.\u201cYour Majesty, you are going to tire yourself. Why don\u2019t you go rest for the rest of the day?\u201dDeorte, the emperor of the Lyndis Empire, heard a voice calling out to him. He put down his bow for a moment and coldly smiled at the man who approached him. \u201cWould you like to compete?\u201d\u201cHaha, I would never be able to recover from shame if I were to compete with you in bowmanship, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou are quite a crybaby for someone who is to lead the Lyndis Empire as the future emperor.\u201dThere was a strong sense of boredom and weariness in Emperor Deorte, who spoke calmly. Although he looked like an elderly man over the age of seventy, his physique was as tough and muscular as someone who had been training for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, a huge amount of mana became concentrated onto the arrow. It cut through the air and was lodged in the ground after destroying the sturdy target.\u201cAmazing as always, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cTsk. Did you think I became a master from fooling around?\u201d\u201cIt is difficult even for regular masters to leave an [Aura Blade] on a projectile that easily.\u201dHe was the crown prince, and the eldest son who had been by Deorte\u2019s side for a long time. The man knew very well that Emperor Deorte El Lyndis, the commander of the Lyndis Empire, was one of the strongest among the Swordmasters.\u201cAlright. I don\u2019t think you came to me for small talk. Is there something you want to say?\u201d Deorte asked, never taking his eyes off the destroyed target.\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d The crown prince raised his bow. Then, he familiarly loaded his bow and said quietly, \u201cA member of the Echo Guild came to me with information.\u201d\u201cWas there any progress?\u201d\u201cThere is good news and mediocre news; which would you like to hear first?\u201d\u201cHa, you know how to tease your father.\u201dThe crown prince giggled at Deorte. He replied, \u201cAt least it\u2019s a relief that it\u2019s not bad news.\u201d\u201cWell, then tell me the mediocre news first.\u201d\u201cCount Lington and Count Colio have died. Apparently, they were beheaded on the spot after their clear inhuman acts were revealed.\u201d\u201cTsk\u2026\u201dCount Lington was part of the Coalition for Disease Control, and Count Colio was Deorte\u2019s subordinate whom he had allowed into the coalition by using Colio\u2019s physical disabilities as an excuse.\u201cAfter deliberately spreading a disease in the Ordem Territory, a territory on the outskirts of the Rowane Kingdom, they independently carried out unvalidated human experiments for treatment purposes.\u201dTo be honest, the commoners\u2019 lives weren't valued by the nobility and royalty in this world. It meant that no one could say anything even if an ill-tempered noble were to cut off a commoner\u2019s head because they were in his way. However, this was different.\u201cIt is the same for a man who left his desires to madness. Alright, who did they say killed them?\u201d\u201cThe First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom.\u201d\u201cAh, the newly emerging adept greenhorn.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dOf course, Emperor Deorte was sharp enough to know that Count Lington was dangerous, but he had still supported him despite knowing that fact.\u201cI am just saying, but there is no need for His Majesty to feel any guilt about\u2026\u201d\u201cHa, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to become the emperor if I was scared so easily,\u201d Deorte said. The crown prince understood this fact very well, so Deorte just went on to ask, \u201cWell, then what is the good news?\u201d\u201cAccording to the report sent by Baron Gorneo, who studied \u2018Blood of the Demon\u2019 with Count Lington, a cure\u2026has been developed. And it was developed not by Baron Gorneo or Count Lington, but the First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Emperor Deorte\u2019s eyebrow twitched slightly. \u201cThat is not just any good news.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWithout much reaction, Deorte asked, \u201cThere is no false information about the treatment, yes?\u201d\u201cThey say that it has been confirmed, and some of the Ordem Territory\u2019s residents are beginning to recover,\u201d the crown prince replied.\u201cThe prince of the Rowane Kingdom\u2026 How very interesting. There may be some people who will try and pick on the Rowane Kingdom\u2019s greenhorn because of this.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWe cannot disregard someone that has brought such great news. Do as you wish with the ones who try to do something.\u201dFind the original at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cShould we formally invite him to the royal palace sometime?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 That\u2019s not a terrible idea. If he has achieved such an accomplishment, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to set up a marriage with one of the members of the royal palace.\u201dWhen the crown prince silently lowered his head as he listened to Deorte, they could see a few knights and ladies-in-waiting moving through the quiet garden with a little girl. The girl\u2019s glittering blue hair was down, but the rest of her was strangely covered up. With a full-face mask and a pair of gloves, she was covering every inch of her skin.The girl, who was cautiously looking around as if being chased by something, carefully approached the two after seeing them. Then, she spoke in a quavering voice, \u201cI\u2026 I meet the two-headed dragon of the empire\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s alright. Stop.\u201d Deorte interrupted the girl, who flinched in response. A heavy silence surrounded the garden. If someone saw them, it would almost seem like Deorte absolutely despised her.There were certainly such rumors. The Lyndis Empire still tended to ostracize beastfolks, but the youngest princess was part beastfolk. She still received glares and looks of despise, but her royal status shielded her from most. Of course, that was the public\u2019s perception. The truth was actually a little different\u2026\u201cWhy are you not calling me Father again?\u201d Deorte asked.\u201cTh\u2026 That is\u2026\u201dIn truth, the Emperor of Lyndis didn\u2019t like having his youngest daughter leave the palace because he adored her too much. However, rumors about the emperor detesting Aeria had also spread in the royal palace; perhaps it was because Deorte\u2019s love was over the top.Aeria carefully backed away. \u201cOthers are looking, and if someone were to see that you are talking to a lowly beastfolk like me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Lowly?\u201d Deorte\u2019s expression turned serious as he cut her off.\u201cTh\u2026 That is\u2026\u201d Aeria stuttered.\u201cAlberth.\u201d\u201cShould I get rid of them?\u201d Alberth spoke with a creepy smile, as if he had thrown his poise and solemnity out of the window.\u201cMake sure to find them,\u201d Deorte commanded.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou may crush them into pieces so that they can never recover. How dare they say something like this to royalty? They are quite brave.\u201d\u201cF\u2014Father!\u201d Aeria flailed in surprise. She grabbed Deorte\u2019s clothes while blurting out \u2018Father\u2019 instead of \u2018Your Majesty\u2019. She cried out, \u201cYou cannot do that\u2026 Because of me\u2026\u201dWhen Alberth and Deorte turned to her, Aeria desperately shook her head and rambled on. Even her ears kept twitching from the panic she felt. Looking at her response, Deorte only said firmly, \u201cYou are my beloved daughter. It\u2019s unsurprising to destroy the entire family of someone who dares to speak about this empire\u2019s daughter like that.\u201d\u201cI... It\u2019s fine. It will only damage your reputation if you act because of me\u2026\u201d Aeria let out a short sigh. She couldn\u2019t hide her bewilderment. She then said to Deorte, \u201cSo, please pretend you didn\u2019t hear anything. Will you\u2026promise me?\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026 Okay, I promise. Alberth.\u201d\u201cI will take care of them quietly.\u201d\u201cF\u2014Father!\u201dDespite Aeria\u2019s shocked response, Deorte\u2019s expression was more determined than ever. \u201cAeria, you are my daughter; the daughter of Deorte El Lyndis, the emperor of the Lyndis Empire. No one can call you lowly!\u201d\u201cB\u2014But\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about me, you don\u2019t have to. It seems like you became worrisome while you were at the Holy Empire. Now, I have no intention of forgiving anyone who looks down on you.\u201dAeria glanced at Alberth, her much older brother, when she saw Deorte being unwilling to back down. However, she realized that Alberth had no intention of taking her side. \u201cSigh\u2026\u201d In the end, she was the one who had to give up, since she had something more important than that.Deorte stared at Aeria in confusion, because she had backed down easier than expected. He quickly asked, \u201cDo you have something you want to say?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 That is, actually\u2026\u201d Aeria had a hard time forming a sentence, since she was preoccupied with her thoughts.Alberth and Deorte\u2019s expressions softened slightly, since they figured that Aeria was going to ask for something. However, they froze like statues when they heard what she had to say next.\u201cThe promise that you will help me be with the person I love\u2026 When my disease is healed\u2026 Is that still v\u2014valid?\u201dAlthough they couldn\u2019t see Aeria\u2019s face, they knew exactly what she was talking about, since they had grown used to her appearance and dressing by now. The first to snap out of it was Alberth, who said, \u201cA\u2014Aeria? Are you saying\u2026\u201d\u201cHe saved me on the way back to the empire. Although I don\u2019t even know his name\u2026\u201dThen, Deorte made a bold decision after observing Aeria\u2019s demeanor. He said, \u201cAlberth. What is the most important piece of knowledge of the royalty of the Lyndis Empire?\u201d\u201cIt is that\u2026a person who cannot protect their own will not succeed in anything else.\u201d\u201cI think a bug has latched onto our flower.\u201d\u201cN\u2014No!!\u201d Aeria shouted loudly, almost as if she was screaming.Of course, the two didn\u2019t know that the man whom Aeria El Lyndis was talking about was the same person who had developed the disease\u2019s cure.* * *About a week had passed. Most of the patients were able to beat the disease, since the Ordem Territory had accelerated the eradication of the \u2018Melting Acceleration Virus\u2019 in the meantime. Of course, there were some patients who had died, but it was a relief that the numbers were curbed. Although, it seemed like a lot of people were calling Davey by the cringey title of \u2018saint\u2019.Known as a small mana gate, this was the continent\u2019s secret treasure that could transport a small number of people for a fixed distance. Unlike a regular one, this was portable and had its own charging function. A problem was that it took about a week to recharge once it was used, but being able to instantly teleport to a place that would take days to travel by foot was a huge advantage.\u201cHaha\u2026 My apologies. It\u2019s not done charging yet,\u201d Yulis apologized.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem; we can just travel slowly while we take in the surroundings. Especially since the view around the Ordem Territory is nice.\u201dThe idea wasn\u2019t too bad; Davey had hit it big in his huge business, but he didn\u2019t want to live a busy life. He desired a leisurely life, so a life of being overloaded with work was not the kind of life he wanted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cBig Brother! It\u2019s ready!\u201dDavey saw Winley wave from inside a carriage, which wasn\u2019t luxurious, but large enough for them to travel comfortably. Normally, it would be right for only Yulis and Davey to return to the Red Tower branch in the Heins Territory, since they had business to take care of. But with Baris\u2019 request, they had decided that it would be best for Winley to be under Davey\u2019s protection for the time being.Of course, Winley\u2019s absence should have stressed Baris out, since he would have to take care of the territory all by himself. However, he had strongly encouraged her to go with Davey for some reason.\u201cWe won\u2019t be moving fast, but we should arrive in about three days,\u201d Winley said.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cThe scenery is really beautiful on the way there! So, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Winley trailed off. She widened her eyes when she spotted someone standing behind her. She exclaimed, \u201cPortna?!\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026 Thank\u2026you, really,\u201d Portna said gratefully.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cNot just me, but everyone who was exposed to the disease will be forever grateful.\u201d Portna came across as rather severe, but she tried her best to express her gratitude as much as possible. \u201cI will use my life that His Highness has saved to protect Princess Winley.\u201dDavey patted Portna on the shoulder as she bowed and expressed her gratitude. He said with a nod, \u201cAll that matters is that you lived. Value your life dearly if you want to thank me.\u201d\u201cI will take that to heart.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, it is time to go.\u201dThe moment Yulis was about to speak after examining the carriage\u2026Bzz\u2026 Buzz\u2026 The communication crystal in Davey\u2019s pocket buzzed from an incoming call.\u201cAmy?\u201d Davey raised the crystal to see Amy, who was formerly his personal lady-in-waiting and was now learning to manage the territory in his place.-Y\u2014Your Highness!!... T\u2014The territory!Davey stared at Amy blankly as he listened to what she had to say. He muttered, \u201cWhat?\u201d38. A Petty Encounter.Witnessing Amy\u2019s big fuss, Davey was lost in thought.\u201cBig Brother?\u201dNo one else could hear Amy, because the crystal functioned like Davey was on headphones. Still, it made his thoughts needlessly complicated.\u201cWhy do you think Baris sent me too?\u201d Winley asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Prince Baris is wise and honest, just like Sir Davey. I cannot discern everything with my narrow opinion, but\u2026 Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s just for you to relax for a while?\u201d Yulis gave a soft smile.Winley slowly nodded.However, that was not the case.[I\u2019m sorry, Big Brother, but can I leave Winley to you for the time being? I think you will be able to protect her better than someone like me.][I didn\u2019t tell her, and the story hasn\u2019t spread in the territory yet, either. However\u2026the whereabouts of some children at the orphanage are unclear. This definitely happened after this incident.]Search bit.ly/3iBfjkV for the original.Apart from understanding the situation, Baris had the worry of an older brother to keep his younger sister safe. This was not related to Count Lington, either.-I think that incident is related to it somehow.While Davey was just thinking, Perserque floated up to his face with a cute smile. She dusted off her light, twirling in front of him with elegant clothes.-Something similar happened at the dwarf village of the Yellowstone Tribe.\u2018And at the Heins Territory as well.\u2019Davey was just investigating at this point, so he couldn\u2019t say anything for sure. But it could be said that whoever was doing this was intentionally targeting children and taking them away. There was definitely something fishy about this. \u2018Should I be considering dark mages who take kids to use as sacrifices?\u2019Well, there were some cult-like branches of dark magic that required a young child\u2019s fresh blood in order to summon the Demon Lord.-That\u2019s probably not the case. Dark mages are violent but not stupid. As such, they would be extremely cautious if they were to kidnap a child to use as a sacrifice. They wouldn\u2019t act this visibly.Dark mages wouldn\u2019t be called the continent\u2019s legendary beings if they were people who would act so publicly. Thinking about this fact, Davey pondered, \u2018So, either the rumor is false, or something else is going on. It hasn\u2019t been proven that the children have gone missing. It\u2019s just a suspicion right now.\u2019As a result, Baris thought that Winley would only bother him in this investigation and what was going on outside the territory. Winley wasn\u2019t bothersome, but Baris couldn\u2019t stop worrying about his sister who was a walking disaster. Ultimately, he had chosen to send her with Davey, the safer option, so there wouldn\u2019t be any problems.Baris could\u2019ve just asked Davey for help regarding the investigation, but he showed a desperate effort to solve things on his own. He was doing the same with Count Lington\u2019s incident too.Lions dropped their babies off from cliffs; it didn\u2019t really resonate with Davey all that much, but it wouldn't be right for him to overprotect Baris who was trying to succeed on his own. And there was also a need to investigate other perspectives, since this situation hadn\u2019t only happened in the Ordem Territory. It was happening in other places like the Yellowstone Tribe and the Heins Territory too.\u201cI want to go as late as possible,\u201d Davey mumbled.\u201cIs there a problem at the territory?\u201d Yulis, who was silently looking at Winley, asked when he heard Davey.\u201cApparently, someone that I don\u2019t really want to see is there.\u201dAlthough he appreciated their aesthetic appearance, Davey definitely wasn\u2019t too fond of their presence. His intuition told him that they had come to see him with the full knowledge of what had happened. It wasn\u2019t difficult to get rid of them, but he had a feeling that that wasn\u2019t their only goal. However, above all else\u2026 \u2018I really don\u2019t want to see Caldeiras again.\u2019-She is the type of person to grab you by the neck as soon as she sees you.Caldeiras, the divine sword, was probably so mad at Davey that she was gritting her teeth and waiting for the chance to jump at him. Like Davey did with Red Ribbon, Davey had also drained Caldeiras of all her holy power to use the final 9th level holy magic.Davey\u2019s bitter smile didn\u2019t go away.* * *Time crawled at the pace of their carriage, which was traveling like a snail.\u201cIt\u2019s true! At that time, Big brother was climbing a tree when\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, Sir Davey was quite peculiar from a young age.\u201d\u201cRight? Hehe.\u201dDavey didn\u2019t know what made Winley so delighted, but she was cutely chattering about the time she and Davey used to play together as children. Davey simply stayed silent.-Hm\u2026 You also had a time where you roamed around that freely?Davey was carefree, and everything in the world seemed so wonderful at that time. He then asked Perserque, \u2018How am I like now, then?\u2019-You seem like the owner of an arcade, staring at little children who are trying their best at the games with the little pocket money they have. You aren\u2019t helping, even though you have a master key that can endlessly restart the games.Perserque should just say that Davey looked like he had a dark secret.\u2018What is that?\u2019Perserque\u2019s comparison was quite something, as she had read part of Davey\u2019s memory.-Honestly, you are not normal.\u2018Do I seem that way?\u2019\u00a0Davey asked the question, but it was one that even Davey himself found it hard to answer.-There is a clear difference when you compare your way of life to someone who only has one shot at life and is afraid of the unknown afterlife.Perserque clearly pointed out what was off about Davey. He felt slightly attacked, thinking, \u2018Have you ever heard that you shouldn\u2019t criticize people?\u2019-Sometimes blunt words are the only way to wake someone up.Perserque roamed around, laughing as if she was mocking Davey. He wanted to grab her from the air, but he just swallowed his anger. He didn\u2019t want to attract any attention.Neigh!! That was when their horse suddenly stopped in its tracks just when the rest of them were admiring the view from the quiet carriage.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dWinley slowly opened the window, since she was surprised by the sudden jolt. She saw the baffled coachman not knowing what to do.\u201cW\u2014Who are you? How dare you block the path? Do you know who is on this carriage?!\u201d The coachman shouted nervously at the people who were standing in the way. They didn\u2019t seem like bandits, who usually appeared deep in the forest.The men had a high-quality horse with a glistening coat, and they were wearing strong and distinguished pieces of armor. Davey could tell that they were a formal knight order. They didn\u2019t seem like any knight order from a small territory, but looked to be knights of great power.Thud\u2026\u00a0One of the knights got off his horse and slowly approached the carriage. Then, he quietly bowed his head.The man looked to be in his thirties or forties. He had a short, neat beard, and quietly introduced himself as he took off his helmet. \u201cPlease forgive our insolence. My name is Duris, the Captain of the Red Dragon Knights.\u201d\u201cThe Red Dragon Knights\u2026 No way!\u201d The first to recognize them, Yulis widened his eyes in shock.\u201cWhy is Princess Illyna\u2019s escort here?\u201d Winley asked. Both Yulis and herself had such reactions because they didn\u2019t know who was waiting for Davey here at the Heins Territory.\u201cWe have come out to escort you so that nothing goes wrong on your way back. Please forgive our insolence if you were offended,\u201d Duris explained. He was nothing but respectful.Davey was actually a little surprised by Duris\u2019 uncomfortably respectful manners. \u2018I find people like that very uncomfortable. Royal Attendant Bernile looks cold, but he\u2019s actually a cheesy grandpa too.\u2019\u00a0Davey was already sick of their attitude of setting such clear hierarchical boundaries.\u201cTo be honest, we don\u2019t really need any escort\u2026 But the Red Dragon Knights are too strong for us to ignore your consideration.\u201d Yulis asked for Davey\u2019s opinion as he chuckled.Davey was planning to use this time to relax so that he would arrive as late as possible, but it seemed like this woman had read his mind. He groaned inwardly. \u2018This is why I don\u2019t like quick-witted kids.\u2019-The contractor of Caldeiras is the same age as you.\u2018Still a kid.\u2019Princess Illyna was the most desired bride in the entire continent and was absolutely beautiful, but Davey\u2019s judgment about her was unfortunate.-What a bummer. I really did enjoy relaxing and taking in the view.Perserque\u2019s voice seemed too bright to think that she was really bummed.* * *To be honest, Davey had run away from the Duchy of Felicity and had left all the bothersome details to Princess Illyna. If it had been the other way around, he probably would\u2019ve gone to find her right away and shake her in the air. It seemed that she had tolerated it for quite a while, since they were only meeting now.\u201cPrincess Illyna of the Pallan Empire is requesting to see you.\u201dSimply put, Princess Illyna could only be described as a big shot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough the Heins Territory was an up-and-coming territory, it was too early for the territory to hold a value great enough for someone from an empire, especially the apple of the Pallan Empire\u2019s eye, to visit. After all, the Pallan Empire was the most powerful empire in the continent.To be exact, there were various merchant companies, wizard towers, and schools of alchemy who had set up divisions in the Heins Territory, but that was it. No one of great standing had come to the territory.Of course, Yulis could be considered an exception, but the visit of Illyna de Pallan in the territory was certainly enough for news to spread. She was none other than the doted daughter of the strongest empire\u2019s emperor. Most other nobles and royalty of other kingdoms would\u2019ve made a big fuss and gotten ready to greet her right away. Her visit was like the division commander suddenly coming to the ordinary soldiers\u2019 tents.In fact, people were saying that Davey had no choice but to agree to Princess Illyna\u2019s sudden visit. Thinking about this, Davey nodded to himself. \u2018It might not be a bad idea to jump on the bandwagon if that\u2019s how it\u2019s going.\u2019\u201cA request\u2026\u201dSearch tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w for the original.\u201cWhat should I do? Should I lead her into the drawing room?\u201d There was a hint of anxiety in Amy\u2019s question.Davey wasn\u2019t sure why Amy was nervous, but he had already made his decision. While pushing up her red horn-rimmed glasses, Amy just waited for his order as if she knew what he was going to say. Davey then said, \u201cDecline.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Pardon?\u201d Amy looked dumbfounded for a moment.\u2018What. Why?\u2019Davey knew how signifcant it was that Princess Illyna had come all the way here, and he knew how great her presence was; however, that wasn\u2019t a reason for him to meet her unconditionally.Looking confused, Amy silently bowed her head and left the room; it seemed like she still remembered that Davey didn\u2019t like to say things twice.* * *-You. Are you not afraid of the consequences?Princess Illyna was triggered when Davey had refused her request.Davey declined once more, then declined again and again. They kept requesting and declining back and forth, like they were trying to see who was the more stubborn one. Both sides had thrown their courtesy towards each other out the window and were just competing to see who was more persistent.Although Davey was the one who started it, Princess Illyna was also being petty and had chosen to play dirty. Thanks to that, the people who were suffering weren\u2019t them, but the people stuck in the middle.Davey did hear that the Red Dragon Knights, Illyna\u2019s personal knight order, were fuming because he had refused Princess Illyna\u2019s request to visit. Regardless, he chose to ignore them. \u2018They aren\u2019t causing trouble since they aren\u2019t idiots.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m not denying her for no reason,\u201d Davey told Perserque.-No way\u2026 Are you increasing the territory\u2019s value even in a situation like this?Perserque looked sick of it.\u201cLet\u2019s act hard to get while we\u2019re at it.\u201dThere was something called noise marketing. The visitor was none other than the precious princess of the most powerful empire in the continent; there was no better advertisement for the territory than this. It was even better in the Heins Territory, since lots of information circulated from the large number of intelligence guilds and merchant companies based here.-Life is not a game. You are not scared of anything, really\u2026 How are you so unafraid when there\u2019s no way the other person will act as you think?It wasn\u2019t like Davey didn\u2019t know what Perserque was trying to say. He shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay because it\u2019s that Princess.\u201d\u2018Although it\u2019s just my guess for now.\u2019Davey didn\u2019t worry about the consequences or aftermath when he chose to do something; he was just cautious before making up his mind. Actually, this trait of his may cause the people around him to dislike him. It was the worst possible decision to make in this world where everyone conspired against everyone, but he chose to move forward rather than retreat.The competition between persistence and stubbornness went on for a few days; it didn\u2019t become a huge problem, just like Davey had expected, since Princess Illyna probably didn\u2019t want that either.At last, Princess Illyna was the first to wave the white flag. Did she just go back? Well, not exactly. Growing impatient from the continuous rejection, Princess Illyna chose to\u2026\u201cHey, Prince Davey.\u201d\u201cDo princesses of empires learn how to jump over the wall nowadays?\u201dPrincess Illyna chose to jump over the wall. She put on a bright smile when Davey asked in bewilderment. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t we have a lot to talk about with each other?\u201d Her smile was dazzling, since she was one of the most beautiful women on the continent. But strangely, it seemed slightly off this time.\u201cDon\u2019t we?\u201d Princess Illyna asked again.The princess of the most powerful country had persistently requested to meet an ordinary prince of a small, insignificant kingdom, and the prince had been blatantly denying her request for no reason. It had been a petty competition of stubbornness that would make people think that they were joking around with each other.Princess Illyna hadn\u2019t been able to hide her shock, so she ended up waving the white flag and then following through in the most outstanding way possible.\u201cHm, a lot to talk about\u2026\u201d Davey pretended to think about it, as if clueless about what Princess Illyna was talking about.The princess smiled cutely as she stood on the windowsill. Her rich blond hair and hairpin, which was pinned on the back of her head, stood out against the night sky. They shone so brightly. She asked, \u201cWe don\u2019t? Are you sure about that?\u201d\u201cCome down from there first. The wind is cold.\u201dPrincess Illyna quickly looked around before entering the room. She was in an elegant and refined short dress, blushing with a slight frown on her face. It was as if she had remembered something as soon as she heard Davey. Then, she slowly came down from the windowsill while trying to pull down her dress.\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to think that we are having a rendezvous,\u201d Davey teased.\u201cI\u2019m afraid to even hear that in my dreams.\u201d Illyna snapped with a bright smile.\u2018Ouch, a scratch! It seems like she\u2019s quite mad.\u2019\u00a0Davey appreciated the smile of a beautiful woman, but he didn\u2019t really want Princess Illyna\u2019s anger. Of course, aside from being selfishly beautiful, he felt like he was dealing with a cute younger sister rather than a possible romantic interest. Princess Illyna had a young face, and she was also short, after all.\u201cSeriously, I didn\u2019t know how difficult it would be to get a moment of your time, right, Prince Davey? It\u2019s funny that I\u2019m saying this, but it wouldn't even be this difficult to meet a king,\u201d Illyna pointed out.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s give and take, right?\u201d Davey responded.\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor going around the territory that I\u2019m doing anything and everything to meet you.\u201d\u201cI was aiming for that,\u201d Davey said playfully.Illyna picked up her teacup with a straight face. \u201cDid you do that to raise the value of the territory\u2026\u201d She looked sick of Davey, now realizing why he had constantly refused her request. \u201cI know that it\u2019s a little arrogant for me to say this, but don\u2019t you think you are too fearless?\u201d\u201cI am quite courageous.\u201d Davey smiled.Princess Illyna clicked her tongue.\u2018She clicked her tongue?\u2019-That Illyna girl can be quite rude at times\u2026Princess Illyna did not know of Perserque\u2019s existence; however, Perserque had observed Princess Illyna for a long time through Caldeiras.-Don\u2019t tease her too much, Davey. She has a kind heart.Perserque pulled Davey\u2019s ear and whispered. It seemed that she had some affection toward the princess.\u2018It\u2019s ticklish, man.\u2019-Giggle.Davey glared at Perserque, who was backing away with a soft smile. He then glanced at Illyna. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s stop here as both of us have done wrong. It seems like you have a lot you want to talk about if you jumped the wall in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cI grew impatient because of\u00a0someone. First, I want to thank you.\u201d Princess Illyna put her hand on her chest and bowed. \u201cI am indebted to you for my life. I thought that I should make that clear.\u201dDavey hadn\u2019t really taken action to save Princess Illyna, since he had only thought about Winley at that time. But he did end up saving the princess too, so he didn\u2019t explain himself to Princess Illyna.\u201cAnd I was able to awaken Caldeiras thanks to you.\u201d Although she was the contractor, Princess Illyna was just Caldeiras\u2019s master. She hadn\u2019t been able to materialize her into a sword yet. However, she was able to do that after the swordsmanship tournament at the Duchy of Felicity. There were probably a few reasons, but either it was because her level had increased after that incident, or\u2026[Davey!!! Damn you!!]\u2018Or it became less difficult as Caldeiras\u2019s power became weaker.\u2019-You\u2019re quick.Princess Illyna\u2019s brooch began to shine even before she could say anything; the light took on the form of a little girl and charged toward Davey. She looked to be around six years old; her appearance was a mix of green and silver like Perserque, but they were different in many ways. If Perserque had a soft and cheeky cuteness, this girl had the cuteness like a young child.With an angry face, the small girl grabbed Davey\u2019s neck and shook it, ignoring the fact that she was an energy form.[Because of you! Do you know that all of this is because of you?!]\u201cCaldeiras.\u201d Illyna tried to stop the figure of Caldeiras who was screaming with tears in her eyes by pulling her back, but Caldeiras held onto Davey\u2019s neck for a long time and didn\u2019t think about letting go.Although he normally would\u2019ve plucked Caldeiras off, Davey just silently put up with her tantrum. Besides, it was true that Davey had stabbed her in the back.[Do you know how long I was unconscious?!]\u201cSure, did you sleep well?\u201dAs Davey patted and stroked her head, Caldeiras clenched her jaw.[You should\u2019ve at least told me before you were going to use my mana!!]How could there be time to tell her when people were dying by the minute? Caldeiras probably knew this as well; however, the reason she wanted to see Davey was probably not because of the holy magic. It was true that she took a hit from the loss, but she was a divine sword that had been through a lot.[Per\u2026 Where is Per\u2026]Unsurprisingly, Caldeiras couldn\u2019t see Perserque. The only beings who could see Perserque were Davey, and Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon, who were contracted to his soul.\u201cYou can\u2019t see her?\u201d[\u2026]\u201cShe\u2019s doing well. Perserque came to me when the stigmata formed unexpectedly. We\u2019re companions.\u201dCaldeiras glared at Davey with tears in his eyes.[Per! Per! He didn\u2019t do anything bad to you, right?! You\u2019re okay?! Right?! Answer me! Please\u2026]As Caldeiras shouted mournfully into space, there was a worry and yearning in her voice that made it difficult to think that they were once adversaries. It seemed like she was worrying if Perserque was alright, and whether Perserque was really with Davey and not anywhere else.-Davey.After silently staring at Caldeiras for a while, Perserque called out to Davey.-Can you\u2026lend me some of your mana?\u2018Of course.\u2019Perserque smiled brightly as soon as Davey agreed. Then, she floated both herself and Caldeiras up into the air. She put her forehead against Caldeiras\u2019s. Whoosh\u2026 At that moment, a large amount of mana began escaping from Davey, but he didn\u2019t want to disturb Perserque. He knew that she was using this as a way to get in touch with Caldeiras.\u201cC\u2014Caldeiras?\u201d Princess Illyna widened her eyes when Caldeiras suddenly became quiet and floated up into the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLet\u2019s leave them be, since they are doing something important.\u201d As he had no intentions of interrupting a touching reunion, Davey stopped Illyna and smiled at her.Maybe it was a good thing that Caldeiras hadn\u2019t mentioned Perserque to Illyna. Since the princess had shown an extreme hatred for vampires, it could\u2019ve caused unnecessary problems if Illyna knew that Perserque was the former Demon Lord.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d Illyna slowly nodded with suspicion. She was uncertain of the situation, so she just agreed for now. She went on to address Davey. \u201cThen, let\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I have a lot of questions to ask you. However, you are not kind enough to answer everything.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t completely true, but Davey said nothing. After a moment, he said, \u201cWell, I do feel a little guilty, so I\u2019ll answer sincerely.\u201d\u201cSo, who are you exactly?\u201d Illyna asked Davey.\u201cI am Davey O\u2019Rowane, the First Prince of the Rowane Kingdom and the legitimate child of Queen Lennie Alishad.\u201d\u201cWhat I am asking is\u2026\u201d Illyna let out a sigh.\u2018I would\u2019ve answered you if you asked properly.\u2019Princess Illyna clenched her jaw out of frustration and stared at Davey, who glanced over while trying to hold in his laughter. She said, \u201cSigh\u2026 Well, alright.\u201d Then, she smiled coldly as if another thought had popped into her head. Strangely, it was different from the elegance and refined appearance she had shown when they had first met.\u201cI\u2019ll lure you out slowly\u2026 I have a lot of time\u2026\u201d With a calm murmur, Princess Illyna put down the bundle of cloth that she held onto when she first came in.\u201cIs that the sword that you used then?\u201d Davey asked, referring to the large sword that Princess Illyna had used before. It would be difficult for ordinary people to swing it, but she needed a sword that heavy to be able to use Sword Lord Ares\u2019 [Longsword]. Although, Davey was using something else in place of the weight since he had risen to quite a high level.\u201cIt\u2019s a little different. This is my usual sword.\u201d Illyna looked Davey in the eye with an unwavering gaze. There was a sense of thirst and yearning in her expression. \u201cI won\u2019t beat around the bush. Teach me the [Longsword] of the Sword Lord.\u201d\u201cCan I decline?\u201d\u201cI will keep asking.\u201d\u201cWhat if I keep declining?\u201d\u201cI have a way of keeping you.\u201d Illyna smiled brightly. Then, she pulled out some papers from her chest.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Davey frowned while skimming through the documents.An eerie smile appeared on Illyna\u2019s face. \u201cAn offer of engagement. I don\u2019t know about you, but the royal palace will react differently. I am determined to get what I want; I have thrown away my dignity and everything else for this. I\u2019m prepared to play dirty if I have to. Do you want to fight?\u201d-You. You thought about it for a moment, didn\u2019t you?\u2018It\u2019s your imagination.\u2019-Don\u2019t toy with me.\u2018\u2026\u2019Princess Illyna\u2019s declaration clearly showed her crazy determination. She was also quite obsessed over the sword, almost in a slightly twisted way. She went on, \u201cI will formally send this to the Rowane Kingdom if you keep avoiding me. Father vowed that he would give permission to anyone I choose, even if they are a slave. However, if they were the seigneur of the up-and-coming Heins Territory\u2026\u201dPrincess Illyna spoke truthfully. She was serious about sending the offer of engagement to the royal palace if Davey kept avoiding her.\u201cThen, what are you going to do if they accept? I think you don\u2019t value yourself enough.\u201d Davey revealed a bitter smile.Princess Illyna\u2019s bright smile never faltered. She still looked as cute and beautiful as ever. \u201cOh my, I\u2019m not against it if it is someone as skilled, capable, and wealthy as you.\u201dDavey instinctively felt that Illyna wasn\u2019t someone open to reason. He clicked his tongue and pointed at the window. \u201cTsk. Let\u2019s not say anything we don\u2019t actually mean. So, let\u2019s have a more productive conversation the next time we see each other.\u201dWhen Davey calmly told her to get out, Princess Illyna glared at him silently. Then, she got up from her seat, slammed her hand on the table, and walked over to him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d Then, she stared at Davey with determination.Davey clicked his tongue at her obsession.\u201cI have a bad personality and I\u2019m stubborn. So, I don\u2019t hide in the back like other girls and walk on eggshells,\u201d Illyna said. She grabbed Davey and quickly pulled him towards her with a bright smile. She declared, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see who is more stubborn.\u201d39. Decepticon Fleet Prototype, Megatron.Illyna was obstinate and pushy; there were a lot of words to describe her, most of which suited her and her steely determination. Conversely, Davey was also just letting her do whatever she wanted because her blatant declaration of her goal was rather amusing.\u201cAren\u2019t you busy?\u201d Davey, who was writing a few calculations for an experiment after finishing a few small tasks around the territory, asked. He stared at Illyna, who was writing on a bunch of documents and putting them inside her magic pouch before sipping her tea.A floral scent faintly spread around the room as Illyna\u2019s bright, honey-like hair swayed in the wind. Davey couldn\u2019t help but sigh in admiration, looking at how she organized her documents with such familiarity. He looked at her petite, feminine physique despite having trained in swordsmanship and her glistening eyes.\u201cI am busy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this here. They say that people need to be in close proximity with each other to grow close.\u201dDavey scoffed at Princess Illyna\u2019s confident answer.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! Do you know anyone who does their work in some other man\u2019s office?\u201d Winley asked in bewilderment, but her question went unanswered.\u201cOh my, what do you mean \u2018some other man\u2019, Princess Winley? I heard friends often do this. In fact, Duke Orba, the minister of the empire, visits Count Perdoom\u2019s place quite often,\u201d Illyna pointed out.\u201cEek! I don\u2019t understand when Big Brother became your friend, Princess Illyna!\u201dIllyna quickly put all the signed documents away and savored her tea one sip at a time. She looked amused by how Winley was anxiously yelling like a child who was about to lose her favorite toy. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s stop with all this work.\u201d\u201cEek!\u201d Winley stared at Illyna in bewilderment, realizing that the princess was unreasonable.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cMore than that, I\u2019m curious as to why Class-5 Yulis is here.\u201d Illyna asked a very aggressive question, with a harsher tone than usual.Yulis smiled. He looked at the princess like he was looking at a grumpy younger sibling. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem since Sir Davey and I are friends.\u201d\u201cSince when?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026. I don\u2019t know since when.\u201dIllyna immediately stared at Davey. She demanded, \u201cAnd yet you don\u2019t even want to be involved with me? What did I do wrong?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I thought that I would create a lot of enemies if I were to befriend you.\u201d Davey shrugged.\u201cEek! I\u2019m fine! Let\u2019s be friends! And speak informally!\u201d Illyna said.It was a battle between three\u2026 no, four: Winley, who had her claws out toward Illyna, Yulis, the youngest elder of the Red Tower who was chuckling at the amusing situation, and Princess Illyna, who was complaining about how they were being cheap and not including her.Princess Illyna was trying to get close to Davey in any way she pleased, but Davey liked her character. He wouldn\u2019t have agreed to meet her in the first place if her personality seemed twisted, even if she was the emperor of the Pallan Empire.Unexpectedly, Davey was living however he wanted after he had regained some of his power. He was very aware of this fact himself.-You act like this despite knowing that fact?Perserque, who was sitting on Davey\u2019s shoulder and yawning, giggled while pulling his ear.-Hm? Tell me, or I will put my entire arm inside your ear.\u2018That\u2019s terrifying. Please don\u2019t do that even in my dreams.\u2019\u201cNow that I think about it, you two look quite close, Princess Illyna and Yulis. Do you know each other?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? The story about them is quite famous.\u201dFor a moment, Davey was intrigued by Winley\u2019s revelation. Although she was tomboyish, she was a princess, so she had gone to quite a few informal social events before her actual debut. Because of that, she knew what was going on in the world.\u201cWasn\u2019t there news about an arranged engagement? I know about it since I\u2019ve heard about the rumors,\u201d Winley said.\u2018Aha. No wonder Winley\u2019s hostile towards her from the beginning.\u2019 Davey nodded to himself. To Winley, Princess Illyna was a woman rumored to be engaged to a man she liked. Davey thought, \u2018She has a reason to be wary of her.\u2019-Stupid\u2026[Huh? Is he an idiot?]After he was done mumbling to himself, Davey could hear Perserque and the cheeky Caldeiras talking. He just ignored them.Winley looked like a small cat that was hissing at its enemy, and Illyna just looked like a calm fox.\u201cAnyways, don\u2019t you have things to do at the division of the Red Tower, Yulis?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing for me to do there, honestly. I actually have things to do with Prince Davey here right now. Perhaps something about magic,\u201d Yulis said.Although it was phrased strangely, Yulis was very interested in the nonverbal casting Davey had performed out of the several unbelievable magic spells he had shown. One wrong move and Davey would receive all the attention of those insanely inquisitive mages, and he absolutely did not want that. However, Yulis was keeping quiet like he wanted to be considerate of Davey. Davey was beginning to feel a little grateful for how considerate and thoughtful Yulis was.Knock knock.\u201cI have gotten everything you asked for and moved them into the storage in the basement, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cOh, they\u2019re finally here? Good work.\u201dYulis, Illyna, and the growling Winley all glanced at Amy, who peeked into the room and reported to Davey.Amy had now officially taken on the management of the territory in place of Davey, but she was still wearing her lady-in-waiting uniform. Of course, the material and color of her clothes were different, and she had on some accessories to show the status difference, but there was no way of knowing why Royal Attendant Bernile had allowed that when he was always meticulous and rational.\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026not a lady-in-waiting?\u201d Illyna cautiously mumbled after Amy went away. Her presence had caught Amy off-guard.This novel is available on bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cAmy is Big Brother\u2019s personal lady-in-waiting,\u201d Winley said.\u201cNow she is the alternate manager of the estate. She has received the title of a baron,\u201d Davey revealed.\u201cReally?\u201d Winley widened her eyes in surprise, since it was a hundred times harder for women to receive a title compared to men in this world.\u201cOutstanding.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably difficult for the royal palace to think about these things, since that place is chaotic right now.\u201dThe political fight between the royalists, led by Marquie Peiltris, and the nobility, led by Duke Bariatta, was currently at its climax.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where are you going?\u201d Yulis asked Davey.\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201dIt was usually the type of thing that alchemists would go crazy over, but it should be interesting enough for a mage as well. Yulis got up from his seat without hiding his excitement. He knew that Davey was going to show him something amazing again.\u201cW\u2014What is it? Take me too!\u201d Sticking to them like glue, Princess Illyna spoke briskly and followed along. She probably wouldn\u2019t understand even if she saw it, but it wouldn\u2019t be a big problem since it would still be entertaining to watch.* * *The seigneur\u2019s palace where Davey resided was a very old building. It was where Queen Lennie Alishad, Davey\u2019s mother, had lived when she was younger. This was also the home of the Alishad family, his mother\u2019s ancestors. However, Eighth Elder Goulda was shocked at how the building was about to collapse from being abandoned for a long time and began building a new one\u2026 And that was when Davey had arrived.\u201cOh! Wise Teacher! You have arrived!\u201d Goulda said to Davey.\u201cIt\u2019s become much taller in the meantime.\u201d\u201cAhem! I still have the instinctive precision of my race, even though my skills are nothing compared to yours.\u201dEverything about the new seigneur\u2019s palace was different from the old one, starting with its size. A lot of materials were being used, and Davey had bought a lot of magic equipment to help with building the place. The construction pace was no joke, thanks to the large number of craftsmen and workers.\u201cI created seven floors, since there\u2019s a basement as well. Do you like it?\u201d Goulda asked.\u201cOf course, I do. Honestly, I\u2019m thankful that you are helping me.\u201d Davey nodded.\u201cHahahaha! Your business is the Yellowstone Tribe\u2019s business as well! Ah, that grandpa Golgouda has asked how you are doing.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Elder Golgouda?\u201d\u201cHe said that the sacred item is in its final stages.\u201dThe Primordial Inferno was the dwarves\u2019 sacred item and spiritual anchor that had protected them for over three thousand years. Davey had crafted the skeleton of it, but the rest had been left up to the dwarves. It seemed like everything was going so well thanks to Davey\u2019s huge contribution to the completion of the sacred item that they had been struggling with. It was just a matter of time before the Halo of Fire was finished.\u201cD\u2014Dwarves! Now that I think of it, I saw a few around the territory.\u201dDwarves were known for staying in their villages, so people usually knew of their existence but had never seen one in person. Of course, there were some dwarves who had left the village because there were oddballs among them as well, but they were like extremely rare natural monuments. They were unlike elves, who had hidden their entire existence.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m seeing one in person, too\u2026\u201dWinley, Yulis, and Illyna stared at Goulda in fascination. Looking at them, Goulda asked, \u201cHm? Who are these people here?\u201d He was a dwarf, so human titles meant nothing to him.\u201cThey are my guests. And this is Winley, my younger sister.\u201d\u201cH\u2014Hello. My name is Winley O\u2019Rowane,\u201d Winley greeted.\u201cOh! Is this not the person you complimented so much?\u201d Goulda waddled over and laughed heartily as he held Winley\u2019s hand. He exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve heard so many good things about you that my ears were about to fall off, Princess Winley! You are one beautiful human!\u201d\u201cAh... Haha\u2026 Th\u2014Thank you.\u201d Winley looked back and forth between Davey and Goulda, then blushed.\u201cAnd these people?\u201d Goulda asked.\u201cThis is the elder of the Red Tower and the princess of the Pallan Empire,\u201d Davey replied.\u201cHm\u2026 Important people. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter to me anyways! Pahahaha!\u201d\u201cGroan\u2026 This is the first time I\u2019ve felt insignificant.\u201d Princess Illyna, who was completely out of the picture, complained quietly about how everyone was treating her coldly.\u201cAhem! This is not the time. Should I inform you about the current situation?\u201d Goulda asked Davey.\u201cThat\u2019s alright. I just heard that the materials have arrived in the workshop. They are in the basement.\u201d\u201cAh, those giant god warriors. Alright. I will get that to them.\u201d\u201cThank you. Don\u2019t overwork yourself. The Heins Territory has a healthy work environment, alright.\u201d\u201cThe people of the Yellowstone Tribe are nothing without our strength! Hey, you people! Didn\u2019t you have some blood soup?! Hurry up and move so that we can show them who we are!\u201dYulis chuckled as he watched Goulda walk away while waving his hand with a hearty laugh. Yulis commented, \u201cAmazing. It feels like a tornado has hit me.\u201d\u2018Dwarves do speak in amazing volumes.\u2019A person who had never seen a dwarf before could be tired out by Goulda as he spoke at a much higher volume than most dwarves.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Davey nodded toward the trio. After watching the workers running around and working, he visited the finished first floor and walked to the staircase leading to the basement.\u201cIt\u2019s huge\u2026 It\u2019s not going to collapse, right?\u201d Illyna asked like she was nervous, but\u2026\u201cHeh, they are dwarves. Do you think this building made by dwarves would be faulty?\u201d Winley raised an eyebrow.\u201cTh\u2014That\u2019s true.\u201d Princess Illyna forcibly nodded in agreement.The group went down to the basement, and they saw a large corridor, which shone brightly from the magic stones embedded in the wall.-A huge amount of money went into making this. People usually call this \u2018spending money like water\u2019\u2026\u2018A huge personal workshop is any craftsman\u2019s dream; don\u2019t insult it like that.\u2019Davey did spend a lot of money on the workshop, but he had no regrets. The inside, which was brightly lit with magic stones, was over ten meters tall and was quite large as well.\u201cBut how is it possible to build something like this?\u201d Princess Illyna murmured anxiously. It was true that something this extreme would collapse if it were built with normal skills.\u201cNothing is impossible if there is alchemy, magic, and the crafting ability of dwarves.\u201dThere was an automatically reproducing magic circle and an automatically restoring magic circle. The intensity was brought up, the impact lessened, and it was earthquake-resistant. On top of that, it was pretty deep down as well; so, it was a natural bunker\u2026 Davey felt flattered as his confidence shot up through the roof.-Tsk.Drrr!! As Davey activated the switch for the firmly shut door, a green marble slowly appeared with the smooth sound of gear wheels turning.-Opening Decepticon Fleet, Containment Workshop.Davey felt people flinch as an even-toned voice came out from the marble as if someone had recorded it. It was originally a magic recording device, but it was good enough to be used for making announcements and such.\u201cMan, a futuristic workshop. It excites me no matter how many times I hear it.\u201d Davey grinned.-Don\u2019t people call that putting on airs?There was no rule that a craftsman couldn\u2019t work hard as well as put his entire soul into it; everything was possible.* * *Whrr!!\u00a0It was an automatic workshop that took up the entire enormous space. It was as big as a hall. There were various bottles and papers on the several tables that were pushed up against the wall, and there were unorganized tools that were being used on one side of the shop. Drrr!! Drr!\u00a0Perhaps there were things to improve on after the door had fully opened to reveal what was within.Winley, Yulis, and Illyna couldn\u2019t pick their jaws up from the floor at the parts that were moving busily.\u2018Well, it\u2019s difficult to see a space this bewildering even if they were a mage or the princess of an empire.\u2019Davey had put quite some thought into this place, and it was created with his desires in mind. There wasn\u2019t really anything that astonishing in terms of efficiency, but this blueprint and creation was a very good try.-Whoosh\u2026-The workshop is now open.Another voice recording was heard. It was a simple system that Davey had created so that a magic recording device was activated every time the doors opened and closed, but it was quite nice. Of course, it was spending money like water because a magic recording device wasn\u2019t cheap, but\u2026\u2018Who\u2019s going to stop me when I\u2019m spending money on my hobbies?\u2019\u00a0This was Davey\u2019s thought.\u201cOh my\u2026 I\u2019ve seen all kinds of workshops, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is amazing\u2026\u201dThe three people were truly astonished by the workshop. They looked around in intrigue and fascination.\u201cOh! Wise Teacher! You\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cWe were waiting for you!\u201dAs the door fully opened and closed, a couple of dwarves who were working greeted Davey and waddled towards them. Goulda was originally responsible for managing this place, but he was busy with other tasks as well.\u201cYes, I heard that the materials have arrived,\u201d Davey said to the dwarves.\u201cAhem! Yes, we were just about to start working on making the coat. Do you want to have a look?\u201d One of the dwarf craftsmen proudly pointed to the large object that was covered with a cloth.\u201cSir Davey, what\u2026is that?\u201d Yulis asked.\u201cA guardian.\u201d\u201cA guardian\u2026golem?\u201d Yulis murmured to himself as he tried to figure out what Davey meant. Upon realization, his eyed widened in surprise.Golems were giant warriors made from hardened clay or iron, and were exceptional weapons created by a magic circle from a mage and the skills of an alchemist. They were so outstanding that some countries even utilized small armies of golems during wars.\u201cThose are class-1 golems! The fee to maintain them is about half a territory\u2019s profit\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it that expensive?\u201dThey didn\u2019t cost a lot of money since Davey had left out all the unnecessary labor and had recycled them. Where did he get the materials to recycle? The enchanted golems that were guarding the carrier of the curse had become parts of this golem. All he did was a little remodeling, reinforcing, and adjusting.The dwarf took the cloth away to reveal a huge figure. At first glance, it seemed more like a statue made of a special metal rather than a golem.\u201cHm? Isn\u2019t that just a statue?\u201d Yulis asked.\u201cI agree. Big Brother?\u201d Winley asked.\u201cWe haven\u2019t painted it or named it. You should be the one to name it, Wise Teacher.\u201d\u201cRight. Let\u2019s call it \u2018Megatron Prototype\u2019.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying name! You are quite good at naming things, too!\u201d The dwarf giggled and used a ladder to climb on top of the statue. He then added, \u201cWe have put some layers of armor on it, but we\u2019ve just left it for now as we haven\u2019t been able to test it yet.\u201dDavey quietly climbed toward the top of the statue. Placing his hand on the golem\u2019s head, he released his mana. It began to change as his mana connected with the statue.Whirr!! Clunk! Clunk!\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dA quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.\u201cThat thing\u2026is a golem?\u201dDavey could hear the bewildered voices of Yulis and Illyna. The statue\u2019s transformation\u2014a bunch of cracks spreading across its surface\u2014was going to be difficult to forget.Clunk!! Clunk!!\u00a0At last, each of the metal pieces that had been covering the parts moved, and it transformed into the form of a human.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe golem looked very human-like, but its skeleton and body were made of unknown stones and metals. Whirr!! Pshh!!\u00a0Letting out steam as it transformed, the golem slowly began moving and fully stood up. It was much larger than when Davey first saw it, like it had initially been squished up or something. Furthermore, it didn\u2019t have a monolithic structure that was specialized for defending and attacking; it really moved like a human.To be honest, Davey wouldn\u2019t have been able to make this golem if he didn\u2019t have the base of the golem to work with; it was impossible to create a movement this fluid and agile with the current existing knowledge. He didn\u2019t understand how the hell the structure of the golems that protected the ancient ruins were created, but their movements were very strong, agile, and fluid. Davey struggled to understand this fact better as well.This Megatron prototype was the OP model that had overcome most of the disadvantages about golems that existed. It wasn\u2019t unusual that there was only one as of right now.Davey quietly mumbled at the golem that silently stood with glowing blue eyes. \u201cAttention.\u201dClunk!! There was no answer, but the golem with glowing blue eyes stood straight up with a fluid movement.\u201cAt ease.\u201dClunk!!\u201cTurn around.\u201dThud!\u201cShout for five seconds.\u201dClunk!\u201cRoar!!!\u201dDavey felt satisfaction as the golem perfectly obeyed him and did exactly as he ordered.\u201cIt is the recording magic stone that you gave us. It should be perfect for fear or a morale boost,\u201d one of the dwarves said.\u201cIs the other thing I asked for also ready?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cOh, that? It\u2019s not yet complete, but it shouldn\u2019t have a problem as it progresses further.\u201dDavey slowly nodded. Then, he ordered, \u201cInterception mode.\u201dClunk! Clunk!! The golem put its gigantic hands on the ground and slightly bent down. At the same time, some strange-looking things popped out from its back and began lining up.\u201cTh\u2014That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI asked you for a simple interception system, but you made me an ultimate weapon?\u201d\u201cHahaha! All we do is smelt and hammer according to the blueprint we\u2019re given. As you wished, there are two magic stone batteries for single shots. There are four continuous energy batteries, although they are less powerful!\u201d the dwarf proudly shouted. \u201cHow is it? I have equipped it with everything you said so that it can proceed.\u201d\u201cMost aerial monsters will turn to ashes even before they can approach us.\u201dDavey heard gasps from all over.\u201cOh my\u2026 A golem that can execute other complex orders other than the first order\u2026 And its fluid movement and a rechargeable magic battery\u2026 Sir Davey, what on earth did you make?!\u201dThis novel is available on bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cRight. Are you thinking of going to war?!\u201dDavey slowly nodded at the bewildering questions. This golem was something that lots of mages and alchemists would go wild over if it was revealed to the public. Although there were still improvements to be made, it was still quite a good prototype considering the basic abilities and the fact it could follow orders. Davey smiled at the two people who were staring at him in shock. \u201cWar? What are you talking about when we live in peace? It is only a guardian to protect the territory.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s a little violent, but\u2026\u2019\u00a0Davey had no intention of cutting back money and resources on protecting his home.Winley, Yulis, and Illyna just chuckled hollowly. It was like they had given up on Davey\u2019s easygoing attitude.* * *It would be rude not to test out something once it was completed.\u201cI will grant you one wish if you battle with it just once. I\u2019ll do it if it\u2019s not something like teaching you the swordsmanship of the Sword Lord,\u201d Davey said to Illyna.\u201cA\u2014Alright. But that might break.\u201d Illyna spoke confidently while she dragged her large sword on the ground.\u201cIf it breaks, it was only just that good. Swing as much as you\u2019d like.\u201d Davey wasn\u2019t lying; if the golem was to break without being able to do anything against Illyna, it was a failure for it to be that mediocre.\u2018Why was I saying this?\u2019It was natural for Davey to have such a perspective, especially when considering the enchanted golem\u2019s basic skeleton or its destructive force. The Megatron prototype was an early model that had seven of the magic stones that were responsible for operating the enchanted golems. Although he acted like this, he had very high expectations for it.-It\u2019s still going to be difficult to beat a Swordmaster.\u2018Little drops make the mighty ocean, if there is room for improvement, of course.\u2019A Master at a transcendent level wasn\u2019t common.Clunk!! Illyna pulled out her large sword as she watched the Megatron, which got into position after transforming into battle form. It looked like the machine parts were spinning together. It seemed like Caldeiras was desperately trying to get Illyna to use her, but Davey wouldn\u2019t be able to judge the golem properly if the divine sword helped out.\u201cHm\u2026 It looks quite expensive\u2026\u201d Illyna commented.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201dIllyna\u2019s eyes glistened as Davey answered without a doubt. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t regret it.\u201dBoom!! Illyna, who showed a strong obsession over battling, struck first. A blue mana surrounded her sword and body as she crushed the ground in an instant. At the same time, the Megatron prototype\u2019s blue eyes shone and a sword came out from its wrist to point toward the ground.* * *The battle ended with Illyna\u2019s complete defeat.\u201cThis is unbelievable!!\u201dAlthough one of the Megatron\u2019s arms was on the ground and half its body was crushed, Davey smiled in satisfaction as he watched Illyna scream while pinned down onto the ground. She was rendered immobile. In the end, the prototype had destroyed her defense with its berserker-like charges and overpowered her.\u201cWhat kind of golem is this strong?!\u201d Illyna, who was screaming, clenched her jaw as Davey grinned. The golem was so strong that Illyna, who was the greatest swordsman of the next generation to use the Sword Lord\u2019s swordsmanship, would\u2019ve been knocked out if she had let her guard down even for just a second.\u201cHuff\u2026 Puff\u2026\u00a0It shoots if I get away from it\u2026 It strikes back if I get near it\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d-But its efficiency is lacking despite you putting seven of those extraordinary magic stones.Davey agreed silently at Perserque\u2019s detailed observation. He commented quietly, \u201cAncient humans wouldn\u2019t have just used one magic stone if simply having more was better.\u201dHaving a big fuel tank didn\u2019t mean that a car would be faster; the important thing was the engine\u2019s power. Davey knew very well that it would just become more burdensome if the fuel tank got bigger for no good reason.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot I have to work on,\u201d Davey declared.Watching the dwarves quickly run over and load the parts into their wagons, Davey slowly walked toward Illyna, who was wheezing on the ground. \u2018Well, I never expected her to look like a beautiful painting even in this situation. How selfish.\u2019\u201cGood work,\u201d Davey said to Illyna.\u201cHuff\u2026 Puff\u2026 An automatic barrier\u2026 Huff\u2026 What kind of golem\u2026\u201d\u201c[Hard Shield], the 3rd circle magic spell is just the basics, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWhen Davey spoke so matter-of-factly, Illyna pounded on her chest with her fist in frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s unbelievable! What kind of golem can use magic that\u2019s above the 3rd circle?! Are you trying to make a weapon to destroy the entire continent?\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s the least it should do, considering it has a magic stone embedded in it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no use in talking to you\u2026\u201dYulis\u2019 eyes shone brightly as he cast a wind magic spell on Illyna, who murmured like she was tired of Davey. He called out, \u201cSir Davey.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Bummer.\u201d\u2018How dare you desire a magic stone.\u2019\u00a0Davey remembered the way Yulis was staring at the magic stone, the nucleus of the golem, from a little while ago. He was slightly worried that Yulis, who was still staring at it while holding back his greed, was going to run away with the magic stone if he didn\u2019t keep an eye on it.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that I would lose to a lump of metal\u2026\u201d Illyna muttered. The victory would\u2019ve been hers if she had used the divine sword, which was basically her other half, but this battle was just a conditional one.Davey had gathered useful data; he did want to do it himself, but he wouldn\u2019t have been able to properly gather data like that. What he needed was combat data regarding different methods and skill levels. However, it was quite bothersome to go and look for someone as talented as Illyna, so the battle between her and the Megatron was a huge gain for him.\u201cPhew\u2026 I feel like it was a little unfair. So, you\u2019re granting me one wish as you promised, right?\u201d Illyna asked Davey cautiously, as if she was speaking to a fraud.\u201cIf it\u2019s not about teaching you swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll think about it for a little bit.\u201d Illyna sighed. \u201cAnd\u2026 That thing\u2026 Are you going to make more of them?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of making about five more as the prototype is now complete.\u201dIllyna pointed at Megatron, the fighting enchanted golem that was shut down and motionless, while slurring the end of her words. \u201cCan you give me one in the future?\u201d She asked Davey.\u201cDo you know how much those cost?\u201dIt was difficult to put a value to the labor, magic stone, and the ancient magic circles that were put into creating the golems.\u201cI didn\u2019t say that I wanted them for free.\u201d\u201cSo, are you saying that you\u2019re going to buy them\u2026? Or something like that?\u201dWhen Davey asked in bewilderment, Illyna tilted her head. Her cold gaze turned innocent and pierced right through Davey. She stated, \u201cI have a lot of money.\u201dIt was weird because it was true. Then, Davey put on a big smile and answered Illyna without hesitation. \u201cYou probably can\u2019t buy it even with your wealth, Princess Illyna. And they\u2019re not for sale.\u201d\u2018She\u2019s filled with greed.\u201940. The Way That Seigneur Shows His GenerosityThe creation of the Megatrons, the early models of the Decepticon Fleet, the golem army that was going to be the guardians of the territory, was the result of Davey\u2019s work during the spare time he had in between developing the territory. The golems became extraordinary beings as he put all of his desires into them. Its power was similar to an enchanted golem, but its ability to last a long time, variety, and its ability to use magic however it wanted, were definitely advantageous.It was when Davey was analyzing the intricate magic circle, which looked to be created by an ancient mage, with [Re-fix Curse], the magic spell he used before to trace the curse in the territory when Perserque and him began speaking.\u2018Nothing else is wrong\u2026but it lacks combat data.\u2019-But it\u2019s even crazier to bring this unbelievable thing out into the world.\u2018What should I do\u2026\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cDid you jump over the wall again?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cWe decided to be friends, right? I came here because the royal attendant said that you would be here.\u201d\u201cI can see right through your offer to be friends. Do I have to accept?\u201d\u201c\u2026You can\u2019t say yes to me?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t, but\u2026\u201dIllyna wasn\u2019t someone who would cause problems for Davey if they were to become friends. He had a better understanding of her personality from seeing her for the past few days.\u201cAnd\u2026 It looks like Caldeiras wants to meet her friend, too\u2026\u201dAfter seeing Illyna trail off and show him Caldeiras, who was wrapped up in a cloth, Davey could see Perserque, who was asleep on the crafting table, rubbing her eyes with a tired expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAnyways, what brings you here this late at night?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cJust\u2026to talk.\u201d-She\u2019s lying. She can\u2019t hide her anxiety.Perserque quietly muttered while staring at Illyna with sleepy eyes.Since even her status window in front of Davey showed that she was here because of something else, it seemed like Illyna was consumed with that thought.Bleep.-Name: Illyna de Pallan.-Age: 17.-Title: Master of the Divine Sword; First Flower of the Five Beauties.-Notes: Contracted to the Divine Sword; apple of the Pallan Empire\u2019s eye; member of the Last Wisp.-Current Emotion: Confusion; in thought.It was a perfectly normal status window, but there was one thing that caught Davey\u2019s eye. \u2018The Last Wisp\u2026\u2019\u00a0He thought that Illyna had brought an interesting story.\u201cWell, talking isn\u2019t something difficult to do. Sit and wait for a little bit, and I\u2019ll bring out some tea.\u201d After he spoke, only the sound of Davey\u2019s footsteps resonated through the empty and quiet workshop.* * *\u201cThat golem\u2026 The world is going to be flipped upside down if it is revealed,\u201d Illyna said.Only be flipped upside down? It would be a relief if it wasn\u2019t viewed as a dangerous weapon. A golem that was able to carry out complex orders and execute high-level combat was no different from a bomb.Illyna smiled bitterly while staring at the Megatron prototype, which was independently moving part of its body on one side of the quiet workshop. She muttered, \u201cI tried so hard\u2026 Yet I couldn\u2019t beat one golem.\u201d\u201cYou are not weak. That thing is just monstrously strong,\u201d Davey replied.Davey wasn\u2019t lying; the Megatron\u2019s nucleus was made of several magic stones, which were on another level compared to mana stones. Furthermore, the main skeleton was made of a unique stone that was seemingly created from an ancient mage. If positioned the right way, enchanted golems could potentially be more powerful than a Master; it was amazing that a swordswoman only at the Expert level was able to hold out against it.However, Illyna seemed to be quite humiliated by the loss. Unlike humans, who wouldn\u2019t be able to fight properly from the pain if their arm was cut off, the Megatron was a golem that couldn\u2019t feel pain. It was natural that she couldn\u2019t beat it. The Megatron also needed a lot of data, but it seemed like this woman also needed it.\u201cExperience is what matters. Let\u2019s go out,\u201d Davey said to Illyna.\u201cTo\u2026where?\u201dDavey wanted to be nosy just this one time, since he saw how Illyna was feeling very down. \u201cThe weather is perfect for a night stroll.\u201dIllyna stood up and followed Davey with a blank expression.* * *\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you weren\u2019t going to teach me swordsmanship?\u201d Illyna asked Davey.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose something important if I just leave it like this. I also feel like I should at least maintain it, since I need to be able to face him without shame,\u201d Davey replied.Illyna was the one who was known to use the Sword Lord\u2019s swordsmanship, and although the world didn\u2019t know, Davey knew that fact well. As someone who had learned [Longsword] from the Sword Lord, for it to gradually be lost and be regarded as a worthless piece of junk\u2026 It didn\u2019t make him happy. Then, it might be a good idea to find someone to take the hit.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Illyna mumbled.\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t want to?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cN\u2014No! I want to!\u201d Surprised, Illyna quickly shook her head and looked down at her sword with excitement. Her heart fluttered. Her sword, Divine Sword Caldeiras, was subtly shining in a white silver light.Compared to Illyna, who was holding a divine sword, Davey had nothing but a wooden sword. It was a significant enough penalty that it wouldn\u2019t be strange if others yelled at him to stop being ridiculous, but it didn\u2019t matter in this case.\u201cEven if I told you to hold a real sword instead of a wooden one\u2026 It would probably just be an absurd amount of arrogance.\u201d Illyna realized the difference between herself and Davey.-You are unexpectedly friendly. You help her while you pretend not to.\u2018I\u2019m just drawing the line before it gets troublesome.\u2019\u00a0Since Illyna had helped him once before\u2014although it wasn\u2019t necessary\u2014Davey was just repaying her. Davey chuckled and lightly criticized Perserque.This novel is available on bit.ly/3iBfjkV.Then, Davey pointed his wooden sword and quietly said, \u201cI will give you the advantage of having the first attack. Come.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then\u2026 Thank you.\u201d Illyna\u2019s expression turned serious as soon as she stopped talking.Shshshsh\u2026\u00a0At the same time, Illyna exuded a blue energy. An ordinary person at the Expert level wouldn\u2019t have been able to breathe as the heavy flow of mana filled the air. Boom!!! Then, she charged toward Davey like a cannonball.Like flowing water, Davey swiftly moved and rushed straight toward Illyna\u2019s powerful dive. Illyna quickly judged that there was a clear difference between Davey\u2019s extremely weighted strike and his swift, fluid strike, so she channeled an even stronger energy into her sword.Still, Davey did not dodge the attack; instead, he suddenly accelerated his sword like he had flipped a switch while shooting up from the ground. Clang!!! A loud clashing sound resonated through the surroundings. Illyna bounced off the sword like a ball as she reflexively turned her body and blocked the attack with Caldeiras.\u201cYour strength\u2026\u201d Then, Illyna flinched slightly and ran her hand down her waist. Although she did have unbelievably fast reflexes, since she was very gifted, she wasn\u2019t able to completely block the additional hit.\u201cYour [Longsword] is much lighter than I expected,\u201d Davey taunted Illyna, who had a solemn expression.Illyna\u2019s forceful attacks began as the energy from her body quivered intensely. Like an avalanche, her threatening mana came over Davey every time she swung her sword. Davey could clearly see that if he was going to dodge every attack, Illyna was going to block his path so that he couldn\u2019t avoid them.Crash!! Boom!! With a series of explosions, which could not be thought to have come from a wooden and a divine sword, the nearby ground was crushed into fragments. Even though it was a collision between an [Aura] that was the most advanced in the Expert level and another of a similar level, the power that came from the collision surpassed any regular battle.Boom!! Boom!!\u00a0Davey could feel a great force in each of Illyna\u2019s attacks, which she bombarded him with. Illyna was freely utilizing the weight shift of the Sword Lord\u2019s [Longsword], which meant each slash had great strength. Boom!! The ground Davey stood on was crushed to pieces with one strike from her sword. There was a clear difference between her strength with the divine sword and without.\u2018The Megatron wouldn\u2019t have been able to last very long.\u2019The Megatron had only won because Illyna had used a regular sword. If she had Caldeiras, the golem would\u2019ve already been cut up into pieces.Davey only showed Illyna one thing from beginning to end; if she was going to attack using [Longsword], the Sword Lord\u2019s sword technique, he had no choice but to counter her with the same move.[Transcendental Longsword, Rock Split]Davey swiftly moved his wooden sword and accelerated it with a sudden surge of power just as it was about to touch Illyna\u2019s sword. One of his talents was to evade his opponent\u2019s sword; although she was gifted, it would be difficult for Illyna to react to it since she hadn\u2019t even reached \u2018Master\u2019 yet.At the same time, Davey\u2019s sword hit Caldeiras away, then rotated 360 degrees like it was slashing the ground, and hit Illyna\u2019s waist once again. As he swung, the path of his sword made an imprint on the grass.\u201cAgh!!\u201d Illyna groaned.\u201cGive up?\u201d Davey asked.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have even come to you if I was going to give up after this much!!\u201d Illyna began attacking again, even harder than before. She was persistent even though the earlier hit would've been pretty painful\u2026 The force of her attacks broke everything around her, but she seemed to become more depressed as the sparring continued.A fluid and swift sword motion would block Illyna\u2019s sword and counterattack her just when she thought she was going to land a hit. Her straightforward and destructive sword technique was constantly blocked by Davey\u2019s flowy sword technique. She grew more anxious as the battle went on to defy her expectations, and it felt like Davey was just teasing her.Clang!! As Davey tried to put distance between Illyna and himself after hitting away her sword, Illyna bolted like a cannonball and blocked his path. At the same time, she grabbed Caldeiras in the opposite way as it was rotating from the impact of Davey hitting it away. She then charged in without hesitation before attacking with a surprising move.[Trascendental Longsword, Mountain Split]\u2018Wow.\u2019 Davey couldn\u2019t help but be astonished by Illyna\u2019s choice. The attack she used when Davey slightly let down his guard was the same technique he had used when he had slashed Shari, the vampire lady-in-waiting, at the Duchy of Felicity\u2014although Illyna\u2019s attack was much weaker than his.Illyna breathed hard with Caldeiras planted in the ground. She had caused an explosion that was incomparably larger than the ones before. \u201cThis must have\u2026done something\u2026\u201d Illyna wheezed.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good.\u201dHowever, Illyna\u2019s hopes were completely destroyed as Davey stood behind her while poking her waist with his wooden sword. She frowned terribly as he grinned widely.-That [Landing Technique of a Thousand Weights]\u2026 It was definitely the one you used. Did she learn it by watching it once?\u201cShe\u2019s crazy talented. Unbelievable.\u201d-Are you one to say that\u2026\u2018I am just able to learn a wide variety of things; I can\u2019t just watch a\u00a0move\u00a0and use it\u00a0in a real\u00a0battle like that,\u2019\u00a0Davey thought. It had taken him ten years just to be able to imitate the original form of that sword technique.Illyna clenched her jaw while crying in fury; perhaps it was because the ultimate attack that she had used her greatest might to execute had been blocked so easily. \u201cI gave my everything for this opportunity\u2026 It can\u2019t end with nothing!\u201dDavey realized the concern and worry Illyna had as she shouted in a fit. Then, he immediately charged toward her as soon as he reached that conclusion. The moment Illyna opened her eyes wide, unable to react in any way, Davey mumbled quietly as he suddenly accelerated his wooden sword, which was moving fluidly like water, in seconds and slashed right above her head. \u201cWatch carefully, and don\u2019t miss it.\u201d\u201cWhat? Kyak!\u201d[Divine Union][Transcendental Sword, Giant Tree Slashing]Crack!! The destructive force of the instantly accelerated sword was beyond imagination. Unlike the impact of other moves, which only destroyed little parts at a time, one strike of this blew away everything and left giant claw marks dozens of meters away.\u201cNow, what did you learn?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cA fluid sword technique\u2026 I couldn\u2019t defend against it at all, even when it was the same thing\u2026\u201d Illyna seemed confused because the weaknesses of the swordsmanship she was learning had been explicitly revealed. Although she was feeling that way as well, she was probably denying it because of the title the [Longsword] had.\u201cWere you\u2026trying to tell me that the [Longsword] was a sword technique full of weak spots?\u201d Illyna\u2019s confused shouting rang throughout the surroundings. Her voice was teary and filled with sorrow and shame. \u201cWere you telling me that the [Longsword] was an old and useless sword technique\u2026\u201dTo others, it could look like Davey had teased Illyna by using a sword technique that was highly effective against the [Longsword] technique she used since she was able to make zero valid hits with her sword.\u201cPicked the least effective sword technique\u2026\u201dTears rolled down Illyna\u2019s face in fury as Davey, who couldn\u2019t help but sigh, approached her. He said, \u201cI told you to watch carefully.\u201dThump!!\u201cKyak?!\u201d Illyna opened her eyes wide and screamed as Davey suddenly thumped her on the forehead.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a sword technique that fits everyone.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat also includes the Sword Lord\u2019s swordsmanship.\u201dHow could a sword technique that fit everyone perfectly exist when people, even twins, were so different from each other?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Max Level Hero has Returned!CH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll show you what you missed one more time. I\u2019ll do it slowly,\u201d Davey told Illyna. Then, he picked up an extra wooden sword and swung forcefully toward the ground without hesitation. It was a strike that had amazing strength and precision.Boom!! The weighted swing disappeared after crushing the ground. It was the basic slash of [Longsword], the destruction-oriented sword technique of the Sword Lord that Illyna was using.Then, Davey swung his sword one more time. The move was more fluid and light than the one before, which had been heavily focused on destruction. The difference in destructive power was apparent even from the flow of the air. Of course, Davey wouldn\u2019t have gone out of his way to show Illyna examples if this was just it\u2026The moment the swift sword swing reached a certain position, an extreme amount of weight was instantly put on the sword tip as Davey\u2019s wrist trembled slightly. Booom!!! Like before, an enormous crater was left on the ground as a powerful shock accompanied a huge explosion. The first and second slashes both showed the same level of destruction.\u201cSee the difference between the two slashes?\u201d Davey asked. He and Illyna were now speaking informally, since they no longer cared about formalities. He was also sincerely giving her advice.Illyna was completely shocked. She asked, \u201cHow\u2026could the destructive force be the same?\u201d The [Longsword] she knew was a weight-oriented sword technique that emphasized destructive power and range, like the light [Landing Technique of a Thousand Weights], [Horizontal Slash], [Upward Slash], etcetera.\u201cNo way! Even if the technique of the Sword Lord was lost, I know that [Longsword] is a technique that increases the destructive power by putting an immense weight on the sword! It\u2019s impossible for the path of the sword to be that fluid!\u201d Just as Illyna said, the [Longsword] of the Sword Lord was structured in a way that made it impossible for it to be as fluid as the technique Davey had just shown. She then added, \u201cIsn\u2019t the [Longsword] a technique that excludes any artistry and focuses solely on destructive power?! But for a technique that slow and fluid to have the same level of power\u2026!\u201dThis level of power couldn\u2019t normally be used, since it was a destructive force that could only be brought out by abandoning all artistry. Since it was a power that required a sacrifice, it would be greedy for a sword technique with artistry to expect the same level of power as the [Longsword].\u201cHm, should I call it \u2018zero-to-one hundred\u2019? It\u2019s the time it takes for the speed to get to the fastest speed possible.\u201d\u201cZero\u2026to one hundred?\u201d\u201cSimply put, it\u2019s the time it takes for a carriage to reach its fastest speed. Do you at least have an idea of what that means?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Illyna nodded like she had realized something from what Davey had said.\u2018Zero-to-one hundred\u2019 usually referred to the time it took for a car to reach a speed of one hundred kilometers per hour from zero, although Davey referred to it as the speed of a carriage since cars didn\u2019t exist here.Support us at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cYou probably know that a weight-based impact requires you to swing a sword for a certain distance, right?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cThat\u2019s how the [Longsword] works.\u201dIt brought out an incredible strength by exerting an overwhelming amount of weight on a simple slash.\u201cThen, have you tried altering the speed at which the weight reaches its highest limit?\u201d\u201cWhat does\u2026\u201d\u201cThe weight that is used in [Longsword] is similar to gravity, but it is actually just extremely concentrated mana imitating it. It\u2019s not gravity.\u201dLabeling it as mana was just for imagination purposes. The weight that brought the destructive power to [Longsword] wasn\u2019t gravity, but a temporary strength made of mana; the \u2018zero-to-one hundred\u2019 delay that it had was completely unrelated to the laws of physics, meaning that the speed of \u2018zero-to-one hundred\u2019 could change at any time depending on the mastery level.Illyna\u2019s eyes opened wide as Davey spoke; she had understood what he was saying like the clever girl she was.Without hesitation, Davey threw the wooden sword he was holding on the ground. \u201cThe advantage to [Longsword] is its destructive and annihilative power, but it definitely has its disadvantages like that it becomes an extremely unstable sword that is only focused on destruction if one hasn\u2019t mastered it completely. Now, I\u2019ll give you a hint.\u201dIllyna looked at Davey in surprise. Davey then went on to say, \u201cSetting Sword Lord Ares aside since he was dumb enough to change directions while exerting an extreme amount of gravity, why do you think this technique had just disappeared and become lost?\u201d\u2018Of course. It would\u2019ve gone to the next generation without them understanding the full mechanism of it since they would\u2019ve been just merely imitating it.\u2019It would\u2019ve been passed on as the greatest sword technique since its destructive power was the best out of any other.It seemed like Illyna, who was sitting while staring into space, hadn\u2019t fully understood what Davey was saying. She would probably be able to overcome the barrier of Master if she were to understand it and be enlightened by even just a part of it.\u201cThe groundwork\u2026 I think I got it. Thank you\u2026\u201d With her head down and tears in her eyes, Illyna slowly spoke like she had organized some of her thoughts. Although it was just one piece of advice, it seemed like she had instinctively felt how huge the help was.-You are thoughtful in unexpected ways.\u2018Eh\u2026 I didn\u2019t do anything.\u2019Illyna slowly turned her gaze to Davey, who stayed silent. Then, she faintly smiled as she gripped onto Caldeiras.\u201cAnyways, you look like you have urgent business,\u201d Davey pointed out.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom what I see, you look like you\u2019re being chased by something.\u201d\u201cTh\u2014There\u2019s nothing like that!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like everything is going to be ruined because I heard it. I think it\u2019s wise to speak up when you have the chance.\u201dIllyna\u2019s gaze shook in confusion. However, she carefully opened her mouth like she had come to a decision. \u201cYou\u2026are a very kind person\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like my ears only have a certain number of things I can listen to. All I am doing is listening.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Could you become my partner by chance?\u201dIt was a comment that could bring about a very big misunderstanding, depending on how it was understood by the other party.* * *\u201cI need your help.\u201d Illyna approached Davey while quietly speaking.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that the princess of the strongest empire in the continent needs help. Aren\u2019t there a few Swordmasters that will move with just one word of yours?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t borrow their power\u2026 It would be against the rules, since only people under the age of twenty can participate.\u201d After, Illyna slowly began telling Davey the secret she had been hiding.Illyna, the princess of the Pallan Empire, was preparing for a test of a certain organization. In the test, several teams of two would try to reach a goal while competing. The problem was that two people including her had to take the test together, but her partner had gone missing for some unknown reason.\u201cSo, you need someone to help you because your test partner is missing?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cI searched for them desperately, but they vanished. It\u2019s like they evaporated into thin air. I need someone who could help me if I can\u2019t get stronger.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Get help from the others taking the test\u2026 Ah, no. I can see them conspire all the way from here.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the details, but I definitely need a partner to take the test.\u201dDavey thought hard about what Illyna said. She had hidden the organization she was a part of; it was definitely an organization that the royalty of an ordinary kingdom or even the royalty of an empire wouldn\u2019t know, but he could analyze what kind of organization it was with \u2018Check Information\u2019.The Last Wisp: the final piece. It had several names, but the name that showed up on the status window was familiar to him as well. The name might\u2019ve stuck with him for longer because he had heard it from Bow Lord Apollo who usually never told stories about his past.It was when Daphne had called Davey over to have drinks because she had gotten her hands on some good liquor. Apollo had came to see Daphne, and the latter was passed out like usual, so he happened to tell the story after becoming needlessly sentimental.[What? Stories about the past? Well, alright. It\u2019s nice to tell them once in a while. Let me ask you one thing: who do you think protects the people?]\u2018The militia? Royal guard? Or knights\u2026\u2019[That\u2019s right, since intelligent beings naturally form a group, and a country is inevitably created. That\u2019s the same for any being, whether it be humans or elves or dwarves. Then, who do you think protects the continent from unknown threats?]Davey thought that it was nonsense when he first heard it; however, he was able to quickly understand it. Catastrophes or threats that would bring chaos to the world just with its existence would have had to be dealt with secretly.[That\u2019s when the Last Wisp was founded. They are an alliance of knights called the Final Piece. Well, there aren\u2019t many that use swords although they are a knight order.]At that time, Davey had listened to him, forgetting about his usual aversion toward him as Apollo told the story more calmly than expected.[They all have different names, but they\u2019ve connected amongst each other in the great bond of the Last Wisp and have secretly taken care of the things that were a threat to the continent. You know that the continent was oddly peaceful after that Sword Lord slashed the Demon Lord, right? They\u2019re the reason why.]\u2018What are you talking about?\u2019[Simply put\u2026 What should I say? I guess it could be said that they are heroes that foster the talented, or a knight order that cultivates warriors.]Davey wasn\u2019t confused for long since the answer to his question was revealed as the pieces of the story gradually began fitting together.The strong beings who had some recognition couldn\u2019t recklessly become involved with them, and their main targets were the young generation that would be responsible for the future. Illyna was learning and growing her power as a member of the secret knight order. There was no way of knowing why she was part of an organization that was dangerous and had no prestige, but it was true that it was quite intriguing.\u201cIt\u2019s funny, right? You can forget about what I said today. I learned something huge today because of you.\u201d A little timidly, Illyna got up and brushed off her short skirt. \u201cLet\u2019s go back inside. I won\u2019t forget your help.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dTo be honest, Illyna\u2019s request wasn\u2019t worth considering since the work of the secret knight order would still be dangerous even though one wasn\u2019t officially a member. Of course, Davey could help if she was someone he was very fond of, but he had only gotten to know her for a few days. It seemed like she had just put it out there because she also knew that. However, he felt like there was a different possibility other than the ordinary thoughts that popped into his head.-If the organization is really like you said, they will definitely go against unknown dangers. The level of danger would increase drastically. This is unbelievab\u2026\u2018Wait\u2026 Wow, this is nice.\u2019Perserque\u2019s eyes opened wide as she heard Davey.-D\u2014Davey?\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat test. I'll do it. I\u2019ll give you all the help you need.\u201dIt was actually Illyna who was surprised by Davey\u2019s breezy answer. She stared at him in confusion and looked like she couldn\u2019t understand him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The main work of the organization that you\u2019re part of is hunting down rare and dangerous evil beasts, right?\u201d\u201cHow\u2026\u201d\u201cIt should be connected to the Zone of Evil that normally can\u2019t be entered, and there are probably various types of people if it is so secretive that you can\u2019t even tell me the name of it. Is that right?\u201d\u201cY\u2014Yes!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough for me.\u201dSince Davey couldn\u2019t input the data himself, he needed people who were at about the same skill level as Illyna. And various data would also be collected if it was against unusual and rare evil beasts. \u2018It\u2019s a chance to gather a large amount of data! I can\u2019t miss it.\u2019-\u2026Your head is filled with thoughts about nothing but the development of your territory\u2026The golem would be strengthened, and therefore, the territory\u2019s defense would be enhanced. Davey\u2019s position in the palace would then become more powerful and so would his right to speak. The chance that there would be forceful intervention even if he did whatever he wanted would decrease\u2026 This was only a golden opportunity to be able to gather various data about the gifted at once. And if the Last Wisp was what he thought it was, he needed ties to it.\u201cI will help you in the way I want. Doesn\u2019t matter, right?\u201d Davey asked.Search tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w for the original.* * *\u201cWhat a catch.\u201d Davey couldn\u2019t help but laugh.-Davey, you know that Last Wisp is the name of a secret organization. If you get involved with them, there will inevitably be limitations\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s why this is the better choice.\u201d Davey stood up with confidence and answered while tweaking the magic circle that formed the Megatron.-The better?\u201cYeah. Unfortunately, this guy\u2026\u201dClang clang!! The golem\u2019s metal plates rang loudly as if showing off their presence.\u201cHe can\u2019t come out into the world yet. Neither can the magic stone, the magic circle that forms it, nor the arrangement.\u201dA golem like the Megatron was completely different from the harvest of moon grass or a stigmata; it would be a weapon for war at the Master level if it were to be made exactly how it was reformed right now. There would be problems, big and small, regarding this unique enchanted golem like the Megatron in this continent if it were to be made\u2026 It wasn\u2019t for no reason that nuclear weapons were a problem on Earth. A golem with amazing power, which could be used however one wanted and almost work forever if the exterior plates were maintained well, was that much more dangerous. Either Davey had to become powerful enough so that he would at least be fine even if someone interfered with him, or he had to have some foundation first.\u201cShould I go around in public to find people so that I can gather data? I can never do that, so I\u2019m going to use them.\u201dAlthough most of the members of the Last Wisp, the organization Illyna was part of, were all over the debutante age, they were mostly still kids. However, their talent was no different from the kids Davey had seen at the Duchy of Felicity before; the Last Wisp didn\u2019t discriminate between slaves and royalty if they had talent. And since there were a variety of people there, if Davey could collect data from them\u2026-The combat data should almost be complete.What Davey wanted was not a complete set of data, but one that had variety. It was different from the situation at the Hall of Heroes, where the heroes who had lots of experience would create a temporary opponent to combat. Not only that\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s at least a possibility that it might encounter a rare evil beast.\u201dAnd even if they were to be shocked by the existence of the Megatron, the organization would be the ones in trouble if they spoke about it without being careful.\u2018Killing two birds with one stone. It\u2019s the icing on the cake.\u2019-Sigh\u2026 Davey, it might be good for you, but you are not considering your safety\u2026\u201cIs there a problem?\u201dPerserque flinched at Davey\u2019s question.\u201cHm\u2026 Dada\u2026\u201dDavey picked up Red Ribbon, who was reaching her arms toward him while rubbing her sleepy eyes, and lightly pinched her cheeks.\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t.\u201dAn unknown danger? Whatever it was, it was something that Davey had met at least once. This was unless they were talking about a transcendental summoned beast or a demonic beast.* * *Perhaps Illyna was actually bewildered by Davey saying yes so easily, or she felt empty in spirit, because she left the territory with all of her strength drained. She simply told Davey that she was going to leave in two weeks.Depending on how one saw it, two weeks could be considered a short or long period of time. But it was long enough for someone as capable as Davey to get other things done in the meantime.\u201cApparently, A was the first to hit. Then, the accident became much larger when B pulled out a weapon in the heat of the moment. It seems like the cause\u2026was just a simple teasing\u2026\u201d\u201cA case of assault right now? Lock them both up. Next.\u201d\u201cTwo women have requested a verdict regarding one child\u2026 They are both stating that they are the child\u2019s biological mother.\u201d\u201cTell them that we\u2019ll split the child into two and give it to them. The person who gives up should be their biological mother. Next.\u201d\u201c\u2026Should I really tell them that?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m lying. Ask the Academy of Alchemy since they said to contact them if there was anything they could help with.\u201d\u201cThe Petroad Merchant Company has sent a gift. They say that they want to buy a large amount of undeveloped land\u2026\u201d\u201cProperty speculation in times like this? Cut them out. Next.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a report from Captain Monmider. He says that they have found a goblin village\u2026\u201d\u201cI selected a few royal guards yesterday and they\u2019ve dealt with it, so pass. Next.\u201dPerhaps Davey making immediate decisions without taking his eyes off the papers in his hand was funny, because the girl who was preparing some tea in the corner let out a giggle.\u201cAhem!!\u201dOf course, the girl lowered her head in surprise when Royal Attendant Bernile cleared his throat uncomfortably. The blue-haired girl wearing a maid uniform became flustered, realizing her insolence. She looked like an ordinary girl, but for some reason, she had a freshness similar to the mask-wearing girl Davey had seen in the forest.\u2018Hm, this is the scent of an advanced elementalist!\u2019Even an elementalist\u2019s scent of mana was different from other beings.\u2018Maids nowadays even bond with high-level spirits; they are so talented. And they\u2019re not even human.\u2019\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Your Highness!\u201d The girl shouted.\u201cI haven\u2019t trained her well. What are you all doing?! Get her out of here immediately!\u201d Bernile shouted.\u201cNo, people need to laugh once in a while. Don\u2019t be so strict about this kind of thing,\u201d Davey said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bernile apologized to Davey.Although the girl looked like she was quite flustered, to Davey, she was seemingly enjoying this situation. Her personality leaned towards a more laid-back vibe.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Royal Attendant Bernile. Speaking of which, let\u2019s get some snacks. You need to eat to do anything. Efficiency should increase once we get some sugar into our system. Find some places that sell desserts in the city.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201dThe existing residents were adapting well, but it was pretty hectic right now because of the needless complaints and demands from the new residents. Davey was treating them quite well, but of course, haters would emerge as the population grew.Davey immediately dealt with potential problems and managed the territory. Soon, the two weeks he had promised Illyna passed by quicker than he had expected.* * *Baron Gorneo was headed to the Lyndis Empire for business regarding the Coalition for Disease Control. The content of the message from him was very unexpected.-It seems they were lucky. Apparently, there were assassins who attacked the carriage of the Lyndis Empire\u2019s royalty.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d-The problem is that it was in the Ordem Territory. I don\u2019t know what happened there, but it seems that the investigation sort of fell through. All the assassins were burnt without leaving a trace from the large thunderstorms that fell on the entire forest.\u201cAn investigation\u2026\u201d\u2018Sorry. I was the one who actually did that.\u2019Davey was expecting the person in the carriage to be royalty, but he didn\u2019t expect them to be the royalty of the Lyndis Empire. It seemed like Baron Gorneo was saying that a big war could\u2019ve happened. It was just a completely coincidental and unexpected gain.-Actually, I came here to treat Princess Aeria El Lyndis, the youngest princess of the Lyndis Empire. And I will do my best to spread news about your accomplishments throughout the continent after the treatment.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d-No, your accomplishments must be recognized. Your Highness, you don\u2019t know how significant your accomplishment was.\u2018I\u2019m telling you that all it\u2019s going to incite is wariness and won\u2019t be a gain at all\u2026\u2019There was no good in forcing it since just keeping quiet for now would be more beneficial in the future. However, it didn\u2019t seem that Gorneo was determined to let the world know about his accomplishments. As Gorneo held pride in medicine, he probably couldn\u2019t budge about this.When Davey sighed after ending his call with Gorneo, the silent window burst open. A blond girl familiarly busted in through the window and smiled playfully. She called out, \u201cDavey!\u201d\u201c\u2026Royal guard!!\u201d\u201cN\u2014No!\u201d Illyna, who was sitting on the window as usual, turned pale as Davey called for a guard without hesitation. Then, she hurried inside and covered Davey\u2019s mouth like that was the only thing she thought to do. \u201cWhat if a rumor spreads?! Are you trying to make me live alone forever?\u201dA rumor could definitely spread about this. Princess Illyna, the precious treasure of the Pallan Empire, was secretly coming to the office of Davey, the seigneur of the Heins Territory. An official visit wouldn\u2019t matter, but a secret one was an entirely different situation. That alone was enough for the big mouths to talk and spread lies. Illyna\u2019s actions were still a little reckless even if the rights of women weren\u2019t too bad in this world.\u201cAnd yet, you still jump the fence in the light of day and come through the office window?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cBut I told you several times that I cannot openly come here.\u201d\u201cWhat if I blabber out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be a real shame, right?\u201dGrind.\u2018It\u2019s such a struggle to control your temper, right?\u2019It only took a short period of time for Davey to realize that Illyna had a nasty personality unlike the elegant and wise image that was known to the public. He even saw her lady-in-waiting try to stop her with a terrified expression almost reflexively whenever she would criticize something.\u2018It was Lily. Or was it Linda?\u2019Davey felt horrified that the connection between talent and a nasty personality was being validated.Two weeks after accepting her request, Illyna had persistently asked Davey if there was anything he needed. She seemingly thought that she was indebted to him. To be honest, Davey\u2019s decision was more for himself than her, but she didn\u2019t seem to care; she was just showing her gratitude for Davey granting her request.\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m asking. You can decline, even right now.\u201d Illyna told Davey.\u201cLet\u2019s check one thing beforehand.\u201d When Illyna looked puzzled at his statement, Davey continued, \u201cThat secret knight order. The fact that it\u2019s not known to the public means that it can conceal information very well; is it possible for you to just take anyone you want to the test?\u201dIllyna pulled out a small artifact and slowly nodded. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019m thinking of using the chance I have.\u201d\u201cChance?\u201d Davey asked.Illyna simply nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And so, if one becomes a member, whether as an official unit or trainee, they are allowed to bring one person in as a student. Of course, one would have to become a member first... But the problem goes away if you just falsely report their death later on.\u201d Illyna went on to say that she was going to use the one and only chance she had on Davey.Even an idiot would know how important this particular opportunity was. Of course, that wasn\u2019t any of Davey\u2019s business. Also, there was nothing stopping Davey now as his questions had all been answered. He took his magic pouch, which was filled with only the necessary tools, and grabbed a fist-sized cube from his office desk.\u201cThat is?\u201d Illyna asked.\u201cMegatron MK2.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the guardian golem you fought.\u201dIllyna stared at the cube in Davey\u2019s hand in bewilderment, but soon nodded in understanding. Artifacts that had expansion or shrinking spells were commonly seen, after all.\u201cWe have a lot to do. Let\u2019s go right away since we have nothing else to prepare,\u201d Davey said.Illyna put her magic artifact on the ground and hesitantly put out her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use a transportation artifact, but we have to have at least some physical contact so that we don\u2019t go to some random place.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dIllyna coughed awkwardly as she grabbed Davey\u2019s fingers. She was a little embarrassed. Then, she murmured the activation phrase, \u201cThen\u2026 Crystal Warp, activate.\u201dWhoosh!!! The artifact Illyna used was a little different from a small mala gate; it was an artifact that transported the activator to a certain place regardless of the distance, but there was no way to know the exact details.-It\u2019s a system that can\u2019t be tracked. It\u2019s quite good.They wouldn\u2019t have to worry about someone following them if they used something like this.As a wave of mana quickly spread and enveloped both Davey and Illyna, the surroundings changed completely with a bright light.* * *The first thing Davey saw after the bright light disappeared was an enormous forest. He commented, \u201cIs the grass not able to grow because the trees are so tall?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a disastrous forest that was as dense as a jungle, so he could still see what was ahead. However, the bushes and trees weren\u2019t growing properly because of the giant trees over hundreds of meters tall that covered the sky.\u201cThis is?\u201d Davey asked Illyna.\u201cThe Pandora Region, which is located in the northern part of the central continent. And this is the large northern forest in the central continent right underneath it.\u201d\u2018We flew quite a long distance at once, didn\u2019t we?\u2019The Rowane Kingdom was a small kingdom between the Valchas and Lyndis Empire, two large countries that were near the Lahtma Mountains, which was the largest mountain range in the east. Davey could tell how effective Illyna\u2019s magic artifact was from how they were able to teleport a distance that was much larger than the size of the Rowane Kingdom at once.\u201cIt would take a month to get here on foot. It would take weeks by carriage, and it wouldn\u2019t have been easy to get here by land since the area has a boundary around it,\u201d Illyna explained.Davey silently looked around the forest. The forest was quite dark because of the trees covering the sky, but there was still a faint blue light surrounding the place. It was perhaps because of the fluorescent grass.\u201cThe Last Wisp that I am part of\u2026 So, the name of the secret knight order is Alpha Reinforcements. We usually detect and take care of dangers that come from the Pandora Region,\u201d Illyna explained.\u201cIs the thing that you are looking for in the Pandora Region?\u201d Davey asked.Illyna bitterly smiled. \u201cNo. It\u2019s that I will be able to go to different regions if I become an official knight of Alpha Reinforcements\u2026 I need that authority. There are places that even royalty cannot enter.\u201dDavey had no need to think about why Illyna was so desperately going after the authority and power to freely enter secret regions however she wanted.-That child lost her mother to a vampire, Davey. She is probably desperate to find traces of them.\u2018So is that why she would lose her cool as soon as she sees a vampire?\u2019The position of the queen was vacant in the Pallan Empire.\u201cI have to pass this test,\u201d Illyna quietly mumbled as if she was motivating herself.\u201cI think we have to get rid of those first,\u201d Davey said. However, it seemed like the enemies had no intention of waiting for Illyna to stop worrying. When Davey had felt their presence, the enemies began appearing one by one from the other side of the forest. Davey let out a light gasp after realizing what the enemies were. \u201cMutant wolves.\u201dEvil beasts could commonly be seen in other regions, but it was still difficult to see ones like that. Mutant wolves, which had strange tentacles on their bare, hairless bodies, were quite small, but had lethal poison on their teeth and claws. On top of that, they were also fast and agile. They weren\u2019t an easy opponent for ordinary people, since they always inflicted fatal injuries.\u201cI\u2019ll get rid\u2026\u201d Illyna spoke but was interrupted by Davey.\u201cWait.\u201d\u2018How dare you try to take this experience away from me?\u2019\u00a0Davey stopped Illyna, who put her hand on her brooch to activate Caldeiras, and put on a mask that covered half of his face. Then, he threw the cube on the ground. The reason why he was here and why he had accepted Illyna\u2019s ridiculous request was right here: to collect combat data about rare opponents. So\u2026\u201cThe golem must be the focus in every battle!\u201dIllyna kept her silence while glancing at Davey with mixed emotions.\u201cNow, it\u2019s your first battle.\u201dAs soon as the cube fell onto the ground, it began growing larger with a bright light. Its shape was different from before, looking more like a weird-looking carriage. However, there was no sign of a device that would secure it to horses, and the shape itself was different from an ordinary carriage.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Illyna asked.\u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s the dream of any craftsman. I\u2019m thinking of adding the ability to fly in the future.\u201d\u201cSeriously, I feel like all the knowledge I know is being overturned\u2026\u201dAs Davey lightly snapped his fingers, the large carriage slowly began transforming. Starting with the surface\u2019s deformation, numerous parts started to activate. Clunk!! Clunk!!\u00a0Then, with elaborate movements, an enormous metal giant began boasting its presence.-The efficiency of the magic stone became much higher. The newly created magic circle definitely helped.Thanks to finding its flaws after the battle with Illyna and fixing them, the current version of Megatron was much stronger than before. Davey couldn\u2019t deny the fact that he had put a lot of effort into Megatron, since it was the first piece of work he and Perserque had collaborated on.After its silver plates surrounded it, Megatron fully turned into a human-like form as soon as it twisted its waist. With shining blue eyes, it stood upright as if trying to overpower the mutant wolves. It was natural for beasts, normal or evil, to be wary about beings bigger than them.-Grr\u2026Surprised by the metal giant\u2019s sudden appearance, the mutant wolves backed away a little with a low growl.\u201cLet\u2019s clean up, Megatron.\u201d[Waiting for a command].\u201cActivate annihilation mode. We move as we erase all the evil beasts in the attack range.\u201d[Command accepted. Target confirmed. Starting activation...]A recorded deep voice came out from Megatron\u2019s head once Davey gave it a command. Clunk!!! At the same time, the armor on both its arms began moving simultaneously and fixed its position. It held a large shield that was enchanted with a 3rd circle [Hard Shield] in one hand and a horrifying object popped out of its other hand.Buzz! Whirrr!!!! The life drained out of Illyna\u2019s face as the terrifying gears began spinning fast. She stammered, \u201cW\u2014What\u2019s that\u2026\u201dClunk!! Boom!!!! With its heavy weight, Megatron began stomping around the surroundings. Like a large tin can, it roamed around.* * *Vrrrr!!![Activation of main weapon complete. Quickly annihilating the enemy.]Megatron was cutting up the mutant wolves in a frenzy. No, to be more accurate, it was ripping them apart. The armor, which was enchanted with a shield spell, was blocking the wolves\u2019 attacks, and the chainsaw on its other hand was shredding every one of them into pieces.Flustered by Megatron\u2019s destructive attacks, the mutant wolves were backing away. Unfortunately for them, their retreat was meaningless, because a staff embedded with a mini magic stone would pop out from Megatron\u2019s wrist armor and shoot a light purple ray of energy to burn them to a crisp as soon as they tried to get away.Megatron wasn\u2019t very strong, but it was very efficient in guarding and ranged attacks because the lethality was quite high.\u201cWhat\u2026did you do in the two weeks that\u2026\u201d Illyna muttered\u201cHm, the electric chainsaw lives up to its name. It\u2019s a great method of communication.\u201d Davey called it an electric chainsaw even though it was actually mana.\u201cDo you intend to communicate in the first place?!\u201d\u201cLook at them whining and begging for mercy!\u201d Davey shouted sternly.Illyna looked horrified. She mumbled as she was at a loss for words. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy\u2026\u201dMost mana stones could not handle Megatron\u2019s output since it required a large amount of mana; however, considering the limit of its fuel tank\u2014the biggest advantage of Megatron\u2014was immensely high, this couldn\u2019t really be thought of as a waste.Illyna could really feel that the golem\u2019s combat power had become about twenty to thirty percent more threatening than when it had battled with her.If the wolves rushed toward Megatron and blocked its shield, it would unhesitantly throw away its shield and pull out another electric chainsaw. It would drop and roll onto the floor, then shake away any mutant wolves that were on its body and rip those that were within its reach\u2026 Megatron was just a reckless berserker as it attacked the mutant wolves. Furthermore, the mutant wolves were at a huge disadvantage against the golem, which was immune to poison.The mutant wolf\u2019s strongest advantage was its deadly poison, which was responsible for the damage of its attacks. However, the outcome was so predictable since their opponent was a lifeless tin can.Preoccupied with Megatron, Illyna couldn\u2019t take her eyes off it. She watched it violently swing its electric saw; because of that, she didn\u2019t notice a mutant wolf cautiously approaching her. As such, it charged toward her daringly\u2026But it was smashed to the ground by Davey\u2019s hand. Crack!! The mutant wolf fell to the ground in silence. Its skull was crushed by a strong force.When you're just trying to make great content at bit.ly/3iBfjkV.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Illyna said.\u201cDon\u2019t space out and follow me. Someone\u2019s going to have to lead the way.\u201dA look of shock began surfacing on Illyna\u2019s face. Davey didn\u2019t read her thoughts, but he could guess her thoughts just from her expression alone.\u201cIs it going to be okay to just leave it\u2026 No, to just leave that destruction weapon to evolve\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Alpha Reinforcements, the Secret Knight Order\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Davey murmured seriously as he followed Megatron, which was marching forward while ripping up whatever came at it.\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s not enough?!\u201d Illyna screamed.Perserque also looked fed up with the aftermath of the golem she had helped create.-I think so, too. It\u2019s too plain!\u201cIs it the appearance? Or should we add some music?\u201dA picture came into mind as Davey gave it a little bit of thought. \u2018A guardian swinging an electric chainsaw, an exceptional method of communication, while blasting rock music.\u2019\u201cMan! It\u2019s invigorating!\u201dAlthough it was actually a magic-made enchanted golem rather than a robot, its appearance was no different from a transformer robot that was made with greed.\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d Illyna asked in bewilderment when she spotted Davey\u2019s wild, hungry gaze. Davey didn\u2019t hear her question, though.The evil beasts hiding in the surroundings were charging toward them, rumbling the ground and roaring fiercely. However, they were all going to be victims of the electric chainsaw.-Whine!Screams rang out from all over the place when the evil beasts were being ripped to shreds. Megatron stomped on a retreating mutant wolf\u2019s head before storing its weapon away. Then, it looked around with its shining blue eyes.[Extermination of all evil beasts in the current terrain confirmed.]The addition of an enchanted mithril alloy metal sheet was clearly effective. Although the mithril alloy sheet wasn\u2019t attached to the golem during its battle with Illyna, the sheet\u2019s effect during its latest alteration was clear.\u201cAre there any other monsters around here that are stronger than the mutant wolf?\u201d Davey asked.\u201c\u2026At least not around here. There are a lot of them because the mutant wolves have a high reproductive rate. The knight order is getting rid of them regularly, but they sometimes show up like that.\u201dLike Illyna said, this area was the region of the Alpha Reinforcements, the secret knight order she was part of. They wouldn\u2019t have let evil beasts run wild like this unless they had lost their sense of responsibility.\u201cI heard that evil beasts that aren\u2019t transcendental but are incomparably stronger than mutant wolves exist in the Pandora Region located above this place,\u201d Illyna explained.\u201cTranscendental?\u201d\u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t seen one in person, but they are said to be the strongest and most superior beings among the evil beasts in the Pandora Region. Apparently, they are strong enough to easily rip a Swordmaster apart,\u201d Illyna said bitterly.\u201cOf course, we won\u2019t have to go up against them. That\u2019s not the job of the trainees, but the job of the official knight order\u2019s extraordinary members.\u201dDavey just nodded as Illyna spoke calmly. Then, he addressed the golem, \u201cMegatron, resting mode.\u201d[Command accepted. Entering resting mode.]Clunk!! Drr! Clunk!!\u00a0As Megatron, which was walking in front of them while still on guard, turned into a large carriage, Davey opened the door without hesitation and glanced at Illyna.\u201cWh\u2014What?\u201d\u201cGet on. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone around, and it\u2019s going to take forever to walk there.\u201dAlthough she looked confused, Illyna couldn\u2019t hide her fascination as she got on the carrier. \u201cOh my\u2026 Expansion\u2026magic? The cost to expand a space for a normal living thing to get in is astronomical\u2026\u201d She stared at Davey with suspicion while murmuring in shock. It was natural, since the inside of the carriage felt much bigger than how it looked from the outside.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the end of this golem if it gets destroyed? How much money did you spend on it?\u201d Illyna asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not a true hobby if you are stingy with spending money on it.\u201dIllyna squinted at Davey.-Davey, I think I know what she is thinking.\u2018What is it?\u2019-Chuckle\u2026 This lunatic is going all out now that he\u2019s getting his hands on some money!\u2018\u2026\u2019\u00a0Davey wanted to deny it, but he could clearly see what Illyna would think if she actually showed her true personality. Expansion magic was an advanced magic spell\u2026 But it was just a tedious job if one had practical and theoretical knowledge. There was no way he would\u2019ve given the wizard tower a lot of money and asked them to work on it; it would\u2019ve been so inefficient. Davey was feeling quite frustrated.* * *Davey and Illyna did not meet any other evil beasts, including mutant wolves, after the first time. Perhaps it was because they had cleared the forest that once. It was a shame for Davey, since he had to collect more data, but it seemed like it was a good thing for Illyna, who didn\u2019t want to run into any more problems.\u2018The forest\u2019s arrangement of mana is a mess.\u2019-It\u2019s not becoming organized at all.Davey frowned when he looked outside the carriage, which was moving silently. As if something was interfering, he wasn\u2019t able to control the mana he usually spread around his body. There seemed to be some sort of static\u2026 Furthermore, he only felt static in his mana when he was using it to explore the surroundings. This was difficult even for Davey, who was usually able to detect things pretty easily, to deal with.-This is like\u2026\u2018A large-scale barrier.\u2019It was safe to assume that Davey\u2019s prediction was right.\u201cThis forest has a large-scale barrier that interferes with detection to hide the base of Alpha Reinforcements. So, it\u2019s difficult for people to feel presences with their mana even if they are right beside each other, unless it\u2019s a specific person.\u201dDavey turned his head as Illyna explained. She chuckled as she glanced out the carriage window.\u201cI was very bewildered when I first came here. It\u2019s instinctual to spread mana and be wary of your surroundings, but there was static for some reason. So, I was wondering if the flow of mana was different in this forest!\u201d There was a faint smile on Illyna\u2019s face as if she found this conversation quite delightful. \u201cI learned that most of the Last Wisp, including Alpha Reinforcements, cast a barrier like this near their base after I became a member. I think the detection-interfering barrier is surrounding most of this forest.\u201d\u201cThen, the opposite case?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026is fixed with this.\u201d Illyna showed Davey her hand with a big smile. There were two rings on her pale, beautiful hands. One ring had an emblem that showed that she was the royalty of the Pallan Empire, and the other was a unique, amber-colored ring. She went on to explain, \u201cIt\u2019s an artifact that makes me immune to the barrier\u2019s effects. I don\u2019t know a lot about magic since I only studied swords, but I heard that the person who is wearing it remains unaffected because it interferes with some special wave.\u201dDavey was quite intrigued by her explanation, as it was quite a fresh idea. He hadn\u2019t tried it himself, but it seemed with a try.\u201cHm, a ring\u2026\u201d\u201cThe teachers provide it if one becomes a member.\u201d\u201cTeachers?\u201d\u201cWell, seniors, to be exact. It\u2019s the same for any organization, but a secret knight order has to be maintained in a special way; however, I guess it\u2019s impossible to always bring in perfect individuals. So, they recruit gifted children and teach them. I joined a little lat\u2026\u201dBoom!!!\u201cKyah!!\u201dThat was when the carriage shook with a sudden sound, and Illyna fell toward Davey. She frowned and groaned in pain, forgetting the fact that she was in Davey\u2019s arms from the sudden shaking.\u201cOuch\u2026 What is\u2026\u201dClick! The carriage door opened wide, then a blue-haired boy barged in with a cold expression.\u201cSio?!\u201dWe are bit.ly/3iBfjkV, find us on google.\u201cIllyna\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d Surprised by the situation, Illyna shouted in anger. She completely forgot that she had fallen into Davey\u2019s arms after losing her balance.\u201cWe exclude intruders. Illyna, what are you doing by letting in an outsider?\u201d Sio asked in a frosty, cold voice. Along with his cold expression, small bullets of ice, which had already been cast, quivered as they pointed toward Davey and Illyna. The icy bullets were ready to strike at any moment.\u201cEven if he is an outsider, you don\u2019t have the authority to do this.\u201d\u201cYou have no right to question me right now. Currently, you clearly violated the rules, and as such, you are subject to punishment.\u201d As soon as Sio stopped speaking, a black-haired boy of a similar age slowly began walking toward the carriage.\u201cThere\u2019s no one else around, Sio,\u201d Illyna said.\u201c\u2026I guess you weren\u2019t that stupid. You would\u2019ve been executed right here if you brought others.\u201d\u201cStop kidding yourself. Who do you think you are to punish another member?\u201d Illyna stood up while guarding Davey with one hand and opened her other hand. At the same time, her brooch began floating toward her hand with a bright light. The brooch started transforming into a large, white silver-colored sword.\u201cEverything is for Alpha Reinforcements,\u201d Sio simply stated.\u201cStop kidding yourself. Your actions are clearly an overreach of power. I will make you pay if you don\u2019t get rid of your magic and retreat right now.\u201d\u201cThis is no place for a human other than a member.\u201d\u201cI brought him here.\u201d Illyna looked furious, growling.Peeeeeep~ That was when a bird\u2019s unique chirping was heard.\u201cIt\u2019s a command to return, Sio. It\u2019s telling us to bring Illyna and the civilian,\u201d the black-haired boy said.\u201c\u2026\u201d Sio clicked his tongue in irritation and glared at Davey. \u201cConsider yourself lucky.\u201dDavey was at a loss, surprised by the situation. Illyna held his hand tightly when he tried to do something once Sio backed away after threatening him. Then, she smiled bitterly and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m baffled at the situation, too.\u201dDavey didn\u2019t expect Illyna to explain this situation properly. It was clear that this had been out of her expectations. \u201cKilling aura,\u201d Davey commented with a smile. He stared at Sio, who was leaving the carriage without hesitation.\u201cWhat?\u201d Sio said.\u201cBe careful of your killing aura. There are no second chances.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The moment Sio tried to talk back as Davey smiled\u2026\u201cSio, we protect mankind; we didn\u2019t become members to point swords at them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe black-haired boy stopped Sio, and their conflict came to an end.* * *After about thirty minutes of following the two boys who were accompanying them like they were criminals, Illyna and Davey stopped upon reaching a High Palace.-Wow\u2026 I wanted this kind of thing!Davey didn\u2019t know why Perserque was excited, but seeing her look around in delight made him quite elated as well. \u2018It looks like a pretty old design.\u2019-That\u2019s right! This is an architectural design that existed in my time period!Excitement was unusual for her, but Perserque flew all over the place. Normally, Davey would\u2019ve said something about how she had lost her usual calmness and was making a fuss, but she looked so delighted that he couldn\u2019t say anything. It was a relief that he was the only person who could see her.Technically, Red Ribbon and Blue Ribbon could see Perserque as well, but they were asleep in their sheaths on Davey\u2019s waist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She called out, \u201cDavey\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s managed quite well.\u201dUnlike Davey, who had already shaken it off, Illyna was feeling both shocked and sorry. She mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect such an extreme response\u2026\u201dCreakk!!! The thick door made of black wood slowly opened as Sio Howl, who was leading Davey and Illyna, pushed it. Soon, they could see the large hall of the faintly shining palace.\u201cI\u2019m going to take Davey with me to the dorm. I\u2019ll report it myself,\u201d Illyna said.\u201cNo, you follow me. And Treve.\u201d Sio, walking in front of Davey, looked at him with cold eyes. \u201cLead the civilian to the outside lodging. An order was given to not let him out until a verdict is reached about this situation.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Treve silently looked up at Davey like he wasn\u2019t going to compromise one bit. Unlike Sio, who was similar in height to Davey, the boy named Treve was on the shorter side. He then warned, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to use force.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to use force?\u201dA quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.\u201cI can kill someone with a word. But don\u2019t worry; I don\u2019t often use it on humans.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dTreve looked a little confused as Davey\u2019s smile widened.* * *[The Special Ones? They are like people with superpowers from what you know from your past life. To be honest, it\u2019s difficult to see them as human\u2026 if you analyze them. They are not born from humans.][How do you fight against one if you meet them as an opponent? Well, a manifestation-type Special One wouldn\u2019t matter.][A mental-type? Do you think you have something like that, you lunatic? Have you seen that crazy God of Mages come under a mental magic spell?]\u201cHere.\u201d Treve led Davey to a small room along the High Palace\u2019s perimeters, then lightly knocked on the door with his staff. The door opened smoothly like a ripple of water.\u201cIllusionists are hard to come by.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCan I ask where you are from?\u201dTreve\u2019s expression slightly stiffened when he heard Davey\u2019s question. However, he left the room immediately as if he had shaken it off.\u2018The opportunity to solve the mystery of the century has disappeared!\u2019\u00a0Davey didn\u2019t know who brought it here or when, but he could see a tray with delicious-smelling bread and milk. Although the boys were both very cold, if the boy named Sio Howl was hostile to everyone and everything, this boy named Treve seemed like he didn\u2019t care about anything that was going on around him.Davey wolfed down a piece of bread and laid down on his bed while closing his eyes. He automatically smiled as he felt the soft and cozy feeling of the bed. \u2018Hm. Ergonomics.\u2019It seemed like Davey had fallen asleep as drowsiness took over him, relaxing on the bed with his eyes closed. He could see two boys silently staring at him when he opened his eyes after feeling a faint presence. He asked, \u201cIs it time?\u201d\u201c\u2026Follow me. The teachers are calling.\u201d As Sio spoke, Illusionist Treve\u2019s hand blinked in the air. With a weak power, a sturdy rope appeared from thin air and tied Davey up. It was clearly different from magic.\u201cThat rope is an illusion, but it will feel real to you. Don\u2019t try to get out of it too hard since you might get hurt.\u201dDavey looked at his arms in intrigue when Treve explained emotionlessly. He began wondering if the power of an illusionist, which affected one\u2019s senses by showing them an illusion with a unique power, would work on a nonliving golem. Unlike talismans, the power of illusionists was completely unknown. And even Davey couldn\u2019t judge whether it would work on a golem that had no will.* * *Davey arrived at a room on the palace\u2019s top floors that seemed like a reception room as he followed Sio and Treve. However, the inside looked more like a hearing hall than a reception room or office.\u201cI have brought him here,\u201d Sio reported while bowing his head as the large doors opened.Davey could see a lot of eyes as he looked around. There were various looks, such as curiosity, intrigue, wariness, and surprise, but he didn\u2019t really care about them.There were three people sitting at the large table in front of him: a woman in a robe, a large man, and a regular-sized man with two swords on his back. And there was Illyna, who was standing alone in the middle as if being interrogated, and a few who were watching.\u201cI will check once again, Trainee Illyna de Pallan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe large man opened his mouth to speak after Illyna answered calmly. \u201cYou violated your oath and brought an outsider to the base of Alpha Reinforcements. Do you agree?\u201d\u201cThat's because!\u201d\u201cOnly answer the question.\u201dIllyna clicked her tongue at the stern voice. \u201cYes.\u201dThe boys and girls who were watching Illyna looked surprised. Then, the woman beside the large man spoke up. \u201cNo matter the rank a member of the knight order holds in the continent, we cannot allow the violation of the oath. Do you agree?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to see. Punishment for Trainee Illyna, and we will erase the memory of that boy at a certain time. We will consider execution for the maintenance of confidentiality if he fights back,\u201d the regular-sized man spoke up after the woman to try to wrap up the situation.\u201cBefore that, I will say something.\u201d Illyna still looked confident as she continued, \u201cThe rules clearly stated that outsiders couldn\u2019t be brought in.\u201dEveryone went silent, listening to Illyna speak. Davey sat back and watched the situation as it was quite amusing. Whether he liked it or not, Illyna was now his friend. It would actually be wise for him to step up when she was really in a predicament. Then, at least, she wouldn\u2019t needlessly be put on the spot.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWhat if they aren\u2019t an outsider?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying that I am going to use my right.\u201dThe three people in front of Illyna buzzed as she spoke boldly.\u201cWhat you are saying is that you will bring in a student, a right that is only given to you once in your lifetime?\u201d\u201cYes, that is the reason why I brought Davey here. Teachers, you tried to take away my right to take the test, but I am determined to take it.\u201d\u201cThe whereabouts of your partner, Sharan Selim, are still being investigated. It is reckless\u2026\u201d\u201cI have given it a lot of thought. And about the incident with Sharan Selim.\u201dSomeone frowned at Illyna\u2019s cold words.\u201cBut you are still a trainee. Who are you going to teach? How could you do something this reckless? And you can only bring in a student once. Can you really trust him? And are you confident that you can teach him?\u201d The woman asked. Unlike how cold she was before, her tone now seemed to be more worried.Staring directly at the woman, Illyna answered firmly. The assumed premise that Illyna was going to be the teacher was already wrong.\u201cThat is not important, Teacher Sylia. The important thing is that I used my right, and Davey fits the criteria. Although, I don\u2019t know why you are being overly wary about him.\u201d Illyna slurred the end of her words. \u201cThe policy of Alpha Reinforcements is to protect mankind. This isn\u2019t right.\u201d\u201cIllyna! Watch your words! Are you saying we have to accept that unknown person with your sophistry!!\u201d That was when Sio Howl, the blue-haired boy who was standing, shouted toward Illyna with great anger.\u201cThat\u2019s not for you to decide. Don\u2019t overstep, Sio Howl.\u201d\u201cHonorable Teacher! This is nonsense. Her logic seems to be right, but it contains two pieces of error!\u201d\u201cI never allowed you to speak, Sio Howl.\u201dThe large man spoke sternly, but Sio still shouted without thinking to stop. \u201cWe do not even know if he has a sense of mission! Furthermore, we do not know if he has talent or some worthwhile thing to see!\u201d\u201cSio Howl!\u201dSio ignored Illyna\u2019s shouting. He went on, \u201cMana can\u2019t even be felt from him. According to the rules of Alpha Reinforcements, only those who can prove their talent in front of more than two teachers can enter as a trainee! However, he is nothing but an ordinary being.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be strange to think this was her plan to leak information from Alpha Reinf\u2026\u201dClang!! Illyna came down from the podium and put her sword to Sio\u2019s neck.\u201cNot everything can be done with words, Sio Howl. Shut your mouth because I don\u2019t want to see you, a fellow trainee, die no matter how nasty your personality is.\u201d\u201cYou think someone like you can slash me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant. You think you\u2019re all that because you received the blessing of mana? And your premise is wrong since I never said I would slash you.\u201d\u201cHa! Then, are you saying that person, who I can\u2019t even feel an ounce of mana from, is going to run wild?!\u201dDavey thought he was watching a soap opera, observing Illyna and Sio's fight.-The blessing of mana\u2026 It must be a huge honor for a mage.As Davey turned his glance over from the two, he saw the three people staring at him from the table. Those who were called Teachers were all extraordinary people. It seemed like extremely skilled people were selected as they had to teach others.\u2018One elementalist and two swordsmen.\u2019-They are all above Master in terms of their skills. I guess I understand since it is a secret knight order, but\u2026Not everyone could be a Master. These people who were called Teachers were probably outstanding knights among the members as well.\u201cOrder!! This is a trial! Trainee Illyna! Trainee Sio! I will order you to leave if you disturb this court one more time!\u201dIllyna clicked her tongue after the woman shouted at her. Then, Sio glanced at Davey with a cold expression and walked away with a look of despise.-You are quite good at holding yourself back.\u2018It can be solved when the opportunity presents itself.\u2019\u201cHowever, it seems like Sio is right.\u201d Then, the normal-sized man spoke quietly. \u201cIt is unknown where that boy is from, but his mana is quite ordinary.\u201dIt seemed like even they could only feel an extremely small part of Davey\u2019s mana; although, it was better than those who couldn\u2019t feel it at all.\u201cIllyna de Pallan. Do you have anything to say about this?\u201d\u201cI can vouch for his power\u2026!\u201d Illyna shouted.\u201cIsn\u2019t that to your standards?\u201d\u201cTeacher!\u201d\u201cLike Sio said, we cannot feel any sense of a gift from that person. And it doesn\u2019t seem like he has a sense of mission either. As such, your request is denied.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without being able to hide her frustration, her eyes were red like she was going to cry at any minute.\u201cThe verdict\u2026\u201d\u201cWait! He is definitely an alchem\u2026!\u201d Illyna shouted.\u201cWait.\u201dThe woman was about to give the verdict when Davey slowly raised his hand and stepped up to interfere. A dramatic skit was bound to become boring if it continued for a long time. He said, \u201cFirst, let\u2019s set the premise.\u201d\u201cBe careful of your words, outsider!\u201d Sio shouted. The young man was more hot-tempered than he looked.\u201cStop! Alright, outsider. I\u2019ll allow you to speak.\u201d Of course, one of the Teachers interrupted Sio.\u201cI don\u2019t know the situation here, nor do I really understand that sense of mission that you guys talk about.\u201dEveryone started buzzing as Davey spoke.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it inevitable?\u201dEveryone went silent.\u201cYou hid yourselves in the basement and your activities are all done in secret; it\u2019s wrong to expect someone new to know about the sense of mission of such an organization in the first place. Or\u2026\u201dIllyna sighed. It was like she was thinking, \u2018There he goes again.\u2019\u201cDid you secretly wish for people to know about your sacrifice?\u201d\u201cYou dare insult the knight order?!\u201d\u201cSio Howl! Watch your words!\u201dDavey knew this was not at all how Illyna had intended for the situation to go, but it looked like they were going to discuss armchair theories all day long if he left the situation alone. He pointed out, \u201cThen, what you should be doing is finding seedlings that have potential, not ones that have already been refined. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cSo, are you saying that you are a seedling that has the potential to succeed?\u201d\u201cThe Alpha Reinforcements\u2019s sense of mission will naturally be absorbed if the knight order truly maintains their noble will.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!!\u201dPerhaps Davey\u2019s words had triggered the large man, who was keeping his silence. The man began laughing loudly, and he drew everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Right. You are right!\u201d\u201cTeacher Boris!!\u201d\u201cSio, stop!! Did you not hear my warning?\u201d\u201cT\u2026 That is\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright. What is your name?\u201d Boris asked.\u201cDavey. Davey O\u2019Rowane\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think you have the talent to become part of the secret knight order of Alpha Reinforcements?\u201dDavey chuckled at his question as soon as he heard it.\u201cWhat use would it be to repeat it a hundred times over? However, I would like to believe that Alpha Reinforcements isn\u2019t a narrow-minded organization that comforts themselves based on the amount of mana.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI sort of had a fantasy about this place; it would be a little disappointing if it were to be false.\u201dIt was true that Davey had quite a good impression about this secret knight order thanks to the stories he had heard about the Last Wisp from Bow Lord Apollo.\u201c\u2026I concede. However, can you show us that talent right now?\u201d Boris asked.A quick look at bit.ly/3iBfjkV will leave you more fulfilled.\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about talent like that mage who completely lacks any EQ\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The expression of Sio Howl, the blue-haired boy, grew extremely cold.\u201cWouldn\u2019t you know if you compared us side by side?\u201dDavey didn\u2019t care about causality or the relationship between people of this organization; he was only interested in helping Illyna take the test and gathering data at the secret knight order. That was enough for him.The three Teachers exchanged glances like they understood what Davey had meant, and they decided to grant Illyna\u2019s request. The questioning was over.* * *What was the standard for judging talent? This wasn\u2019t a place where there were only sword-wielding knights or mages; as it was a place for similarly aged children who all had unique talents to gather, the standard for judging talent wasn\u2019t that great.\u201cThe Teachers told me to go easy on you, but expect no mercy from me, outsider,\u201d Sio spoke coldly while raising his staff.Davey did not reply. He recalled that Sio dared to attack Megatron as well as released his killing aura. Killing aura was part of the energy of emotion that came out when one desired to kill someone. He thought that he needed to let Sio know that he should also expect to die if he desired to kill someone as well. Of course, Davey had to control his level of power since his plan would go to waste if he killed Sio.\u201cIllyna! That person's mana is weak like an ordinary person.\u201d\u201cYeah. Even if he has a plan\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Shayir, Fendyr. Thank you for your concern, but\u2026\u201d With a sigh, Illyna mumbled to herself so quietly that no one else could hear her. She watched the enormous empty lot in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m actually scared about how that lunatic will crush Sio.\u201dHolding a cube that contained a compressed version of Megatron in one hand, and a normal wooden sword in the other, Davey stared at the blue-haired Sio calmly.Sio was a so-called genius who had unique abilities that were rare for a mage who had received the blessing of mana. He was extremely hostile to Davey like his pride had been hurt. Then, he smiled coldly as Davey lightly tossed the cube in his hand as a crowd of people watched. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have the first move. I don\u2019t know what kind of trick you are going to play when you barely have any mana but try your best.\u201dDavey threw the cube into the air without hesitation and uttered a simple order. \u201cMegatron, an order.\u201d[Command accepted. Waiting.]\u201cPull out electric chainsaw.\u201d[Command confirmed. Activating.]Clang!! Clunk! Vroom!! Whirr!!\u00a0The atmosphere froze when the Megatron turned into a giant warrior and pulled out an enormous electric chainsaw.\u201cLet\u2019s calm down a bit and have a talk.\u201d\u2018With the amazing method of communication in the Megatron\u2019s hand.\u201942. You Are in the Palm of My HandThe golem\u2019s metal parts began twisting and turning once again. It soon transformed into a form of a giant warrior. Whir!! Whirrr!! Then, the electric sword, which had an amazing appearance and sound, overwhelmed everyone with its great roar.\u201cDavey! Don\u2019t kill him no matter how angry you are!\u201d Illyna shouted in horror. She knew about the abnormal destructive power the Megatron\u2019s electric chainsaw possessed, but Davey ignored her and just stared at Sio Howl, the boy in front of him.\u201cA go\u2026lem? You\u2026 You were a golem controller?\u201d Sio asked.A cold, terrifying aura surrounded the space as the gigantic Megatron roared loudly, boasting its greatness. Mana began flowing into its body.\u201cNo wonder I could only feel a weak mana from you. You\u2019re trying to play a worthless trick and only rely on that lump of metal\u2026\u201d Sio began releasing his mana at once. He quietly expressed his anger toward Megatron as if he had some weird sense of pride.Crack!![Release]At the same time, several sharp ice crystals appeared in the air and flew toward Davey and Megatron without mercy. It was a rapid attack that normal people wouldn\u2019t have been able to react to as each crystal was like an arrow from a bow gun.The merit of the ones who had received the blessing of mana was quite significant; ordinary people had to recite quite a long spell in order to cast magic unless they were as gifted as Yulis. However, those with the blessing of mana were able to overrule that notion; it meant that they could minimize the reciting without even trying. Not only that, but their bodies also absorbed a certain amount of mana, and the same amount of mana showed an unbelievable level of efficiency if used by them. It was a little similar to the level of Absorption where one was able to feel the will of their mana and resonate with it in that sense.Clang clang clang clang!! Clang!! Maybe it was because the shards were coming at not only Megatron but at Davey as well that the golem, which was showing its great presence with its enormous size, stepped in front of Davey and prevented the attacks from reaching him. It seemed he didn\u2019t have to worry about killing Sio since he had lowered its output of power to the minimum.\u2018He is going to bleed a little though.\u2019\u201cHm, the reaction speed of the automatic protection system has become a little slower due to the low temperature.\u201d Davey noted.Clang!! Clang! Sio was attacking with the intent to seriously injure Davey, but the latter was more interested in testing the power of Megatron or data collection.Relaxed, Davey pulled out a small chart and began checking things off as he watched the Megatron deflect all of Sio\u2019s attacks.\u201cI think there\u2019s a need to reinforce the chest armor. The reaction speed is going to get slower if I don\u2019t minimize the plates on the shoulders.\u201d-You\u2019re going to have to look at the efficiency as well. It has such great output, but the division of power is all off.Like Davey, Perserque was also just analyzing the output of Megatron with no regard for the fact that he was being attacked.\u201cUghh!!\u201d Perhaps Sio couldn\u2019t hold in his anger; his eyes glistened eerily when he created a big, long spear of glass while continuing to fly ice shards toward them.[Freeze]Megatron, which was boasting its great presence with its enormous size, stepped in front of Davey and prevented the attacks from reaching him. Crack!! At the same time, the Megatron began freezing as its feet started becoming frosty.[Ice Spear, Smash]Sio\u2019s large ice spear flew toward the Megatron as it began freezing up.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ve done enough to experiment with the defense. Do it up to here and start attacking back moderately.\u201d[Command accepted.]As if it had just stood around and watched until now, Megatron shook off the ice by releasing a blue-colored mana from his entire body. He grabbed the ice spear with his free hand and threw it far away.\u201cWhat?!\u201d The crowd exclaimed in shock, but Davey didn\u2019t take his eyes off Megatron.Boom!! Boom!! With a speed unfitting for its gigantic size, Megatron rapidly charged toward Sio with his electric chainsaw like it was going to cut him into pieces. Sio created a wall of ice by quickly uttering a spell and flew back.Whirrr!! Cruck!!\u201cHuh?! Th\u2026 This crazy golem!! Are you trying to kill someone?\u201d Sio shouted.\u201cAre you going to fight against an enemy like that? With your life on the line?\u201d\u201cDamn you!\u201d Even though he was cursing, Sio looked extremely pale because the psychopath Megatron had charged at him like it was going to shred him up while ignoring his attacks. A giant metal golem attacking with unbelievable movements was an attack that Sio had never imagined.Boom!! Boom!!\u201cShriek!\u00a0W\u2026 What is that terrifying weapon?!\u201d Some of the people who were watching the battle from afar screamed with pale faces while shaking Illyna\u2019s arm. The chainsaw definitely had power, but it had a way of inciting fear instinctively.However, it seemed like Sio had some talent contrasting to his personality. Even while desperately jumping all over the place and dodging attacks, he didn\u2019t stop striking back at the Megatron and attacking Davey. Megatron had to stop momentarily and step in front of Davey to protect him because of that, but this was all part of his experiment: the reflex test. Sio created an opportunity to escape by attacking Davey if he was in danger, and he struck back after figuring out the delay time that occurred between its large movements. It couldn\u2019t be said that Sio was exceptional, but his battle experience was definitely more advanced than the mages of wizard towers who stayed in their towers all day.-Still, he is lacking compared to that kid, Yulis.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it also be a problem if he was better than Yulis?\u2019Yulis was still one of the greatest genius mages of this continent, and it was just that his capabilities had just been undervalued a little; there was no way someone as gifted as he would be common, even if the kids here were all talented.\u201cAhh!!\u201d Sio\u2019s blood ran cold as his one mistake almost cost him an arm. He could probably recover from it, but he didn\u2019t want to experience getting his arm chopped off by that strange and terrifying weapon.Even while Sio was running all over the place and dodging attacks, he still showed hostility toward Davey; he was quite an unwavering person.Davey wondered if his method of communication was too rough.\u2018Frost?\u2019Davey chuckled as he felt something unexpected in the air. He organized his data while observing Sio and Megatron.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
