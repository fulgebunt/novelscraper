In fact, I even thought that I was close to the main character.However, after I became a high school student and met that guy, I realized that I was just a mob character.When I met Ryoma Ryuzaki, I was reminded that I was a minor character due to my meeting with the \u2026\u2026 harem-like protagonist.And I became a mob character.I ended up living an boring school life, where I couldn\u2019t tell a story, and I was always absent-minded in the corner of the classroom.Today, too, I was looking at the girls I used to love from the corner of the classroom.\u201cHey, Ryoma Onii-chan? Let\u2019s go buy a swimsuit together.\u201dA small girl with black hair tied in two pigtails was sitting on Ryuzaki\u2019s lap. She was my younger stepsister.Our birthdays were only a few months apart, but I was born a few months earlier than she was, so I was her older stepbrother. Since my parents remarried when I was very young, we have been like brother and sister.My stepsister, Azusa Nakayama, who used to be very fond of me, was completely obsessed with Ryuzaki. It was heartbreaking to see her trying so hard to get his attention.Come to think of it, a while ago, she used to spoil me like that \u2026\u2026, but lately we don\u2019t talk much anymore, and I was a little sad.\u201d It\u2019s only May. Isn\u2019t it too early for swimsuits?\u201d\u201cWhat? But I want Ryoma to see me in a swimsuit. \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I want to see it!\u201dRyuzaki is laughing while patting Azusa\u2019s head. Azusa was also smiling happily.They were making out in the middle of the classroom even though it was break time. Azusa was a shy girl, so she wasn\u2019t really good at drawing attention. But because she loves Ryuzaki, she\u2019s pampering him like that, regardless of whether it\u2019s in public or not.It was terribly painful to see that.\u201cBut it\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?\u3000It\u2019s a little early, but you can at least look at it.\u201dThe one who leaned forward in defiance of Azusa was a beautiful young girl with long black hair. She\u2019s a childhood friend of mine.Yuzuki Hojo. She\u2019s small in stature, but has a nice body and is popular with all the boys at school.She is popular with all the boys at school. \u201cActually, my \u2026\u2026 breasts have gotten a little bigger,\u201d she said. That\u2019s why the swimsuit I bought last year doesn\u2019t fit \u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u3000Hmmm, the swimsuit is \u2026\u2026 that\u2019s a big deal.\u201dYuzuki must have had a complex about her large breasts. However, in an attempt to be liked by Ryuzaki, even if only a little, she makes comments that emphasize her breasts.It was a painful experience for me to see her trying to change herself to be loved by the person she loves.\u201cRyu-kun\u2019s lewd. You really want to see a girl in a swimsuit, don\u2019t you? If that\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t you just tell me honestly that you want to see it? \u266a\u201dThe one poking Ryuzaki\u2019s cheek with excitement was a girl with bright blonde hair that looked good on her. She was my best friend.Asakura Kirari. She was a gal, or rather, a girl with an overall flamboyant atmosphere. Her breasts weren\u2019t as big as Yuzuki\u2019s, but she wore her school uniform loosely, so you could see a little of her chest. Her skirt was also too short, and for a high school boy in his adolescence, it was a sight for their eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to tell us ~ \u266a Look, Ryu-kun \u2026 Be honest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I want to see it. I want to see a girl in her swimsuit!\u201d\u201cHmm? Do you want to see my breasts? If so, I can show you.\u201dWith that said, Kirari deliberately bent forward and showed her chest to Tatsuzaki.\u00a0I\u2019m sure Tatsuzaki can see even the intimate parts \u2026 I can\u2019t see it from my perspective, but since he had a dirty look on his face, I figured it all out.\u2026\u2026 Until high school, she was a more mature girl. To be precise, until the day of my high school entrance ceremony, she kept her black hair in a bun. She also wore glasses, and was a normal girl who wore her school uniform properly. She and I were pretty much on the same page, and we chatted a lot. \u2026\u2026 When she met Ryuzaki at the entrance ceremony and learned that he liked flashy girls, she completely changed her image.\u2026\u2026 When I see Kirari abandoning her old self to become the type of person the person she loves likes, it still makes my heart ache. That girl I once liked was nowhere to be found.(\u2026 Damn it.)I clench my fists under my desk.In the past, until I became a high school student, it was me who was in the position of \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki.I was on good terms with those three people, and I should have been with them all the I thought I was good friends with the three of them and was always with them, but \u2026\u2026 now I\u2019m completely out of the loop.I\u2019ve always thought of myself as a protagonist.I had a cute stepsister, a beautiful childhood friend, and a good and charming best friend. I thought I was going to have a great time with the three of them in high school.But reality is cruel.At the entrance ceremony of my high school, Ryuzaki stole everything from me.The three guys that I liked have become completely obsessed with Ryoma Ryuzaki. In addition, to add to the annoyance, \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki seems to be a \u201charem protagonist,\u201d and there are many more girls around him.In addition to the three, there are a number of other girls in class, such as the small girl who looks like a small animal, the senior student council president, and the leader of the kendo club in the same year.And even now, in addition to the three of them, there is one more member of the Ryuzaki harem.\u201cThis is why I\u2019m going to go look at swimsuits after school. \u2026\u2026 Would you like to go too, Shiho?Ryuzaki turned around and looked back. In the seat directly behind him sat a girl named Shiho Shimotsuki, a childhood friend of his who seemed to be the oldest member of the Ryuzaki harem.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dShe had probably been sleeping with her head down for a long time, but when Ryuzaki called out to her, she looked up as if she was bored. She seems to have Scandinavian blood and her lightly pigmented hair is very beautiful.She is a fragile, or rather \u2026\u2026 delicate, transparent girl, like glasswork.It is not an exaggeration to say that she is the bestlooking girl in the school. She is Ryuzaki\u2019s childhood friend. I wonder how lucky he is with women.\u201cWere you asleep again? You always look sleepy, Shiho.He seemed to be trying to pet her, but she gave him a slight look of disgust and lightly brushed his hand away.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026what?\u201dThen she asked him what he wanted with a blank expression.I\u2019m not sure if she doesn\u2019t talk much or not. She is usually very quiet and never speaks until she is spoken to by others.Even when she is spoken to by her childhood friend, Ryuzaki, she only says the bare minimum like this.It seems that Ryuzaki really loves her.Perhaps more than the three girls I love, \u2026\u2026 or any of the other girls, Ryuzaki is probably more in love with Shimotsuki.In fact, he even went out of his way to ask her to go shopping with him now.Usually, Ryuzaki doesn\u2019t ask girls out on his own. He is always passive, with the exception of Shimotsuki. She was the only one that Ryuzaki always asked out.But Shimotsuki\u2019s answer is always the same.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 no.\u201dTwo sounds were uttered and she dropped her face down again. She buried her face in her arm pillow and went to sleep.I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, but I strongly felt her intention, not to go.\u201cReally? Then I\u2019ll ask you out again some other time, okay?\u201dI guess Ryuzaki is used to being rejected. He immediately turned his face back and returned to his conversation the other three.Watching these scenes from the corner of the classroom was the daily life of \u2026\u2026 me, Kotaro Nakayama.It\u2019s been about a month since I entered high school.I\u2019ve been spending my days like this since I first encountered Ryuzaki.I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel lonely.The people I loved so much were crazy about someone else. It was too painful to even try to look good.When I became a high school student, I realized that I was not the main character.\u3000Apparently, I was a \u201cmob character\u201d.A minor role in the story, unable to create any story. Or perhaps I was a tool to make the characters more appealing.I must have played a supporting role for Ryoma Ryuzaki.I\u2019 m just a tool to explain that the hero Ryoma is attractive enough to make the three heroines \u2026\u2026 Azusa, Yuzuki and Kirari fall in love with him, who were trapped by the false hero called me.I wanted to have a \u2026\u2026 girlfriend.I wanted to make the person I loved happy and have them make me happy.But it\u2019s unlikely to be possible again.I\u2019m not going to be able to do that again, because the girls I loved have already fallen in love with someone other than me.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My childhood friend, Yuzuki, and my best friend, Kirari, all went shopping with Ryuzaki. In addition, they were going to try on swimsuits. \u2026\u2026 The thought of Ryuzaki seeing the three of them in their swimsuits was enough to damage my brain.Well, I\u2019m not in a position to be jealous anymore.This is probably the resentment of an ugly mob character. I really can\u2019t get over the fact that Ryuzaki is able to do things that I couldn\u2019t do. I guess that\u2019s what they call a \u2018harem protagonist\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201dWhen I came home, I was alone, of course.My parents are away on vacation, so I\u2019m living with my stepsister, Azusa. Until a while ago, I was always with Azusa. I\u2019m sure we loved each other as a single family, but after meeting \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki, Azusa became obsessed with him and began to despise me.You can\u2019t blame her for that.It\u2019s not unreasonable for high school students in their adolescence to become obsessed with someone they love.It\u2019s my fault.If I couldn\u2019t keep Azusa\u2019s heart intact, I shouldn\u2019t be so rude as to wish for something else.Now that I\u2019m free, what should I do?I had a math assignment to complete, so I headed to my room to get it done.\u2026\u2026 I used to study together with my best friend Kirari.The night before the exam, we were both on the verge of passing, so we stayed up all night studying hard. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of our hands high-fiving after passing the exam.Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to interact with her again.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh, I forgot my textbook.\u201dI wondered if it was because I was thinking about something negative.The bad things come in waves, and to my surprise, my math textbook was not in my bag. I was in trouble. \u2026\u2026 The printouts for the assignment were quite difficult, so I couldn\u2019t do it without the textbook.In a situation like this, it would usually be easier to borrow it from my neighbor Yuzuki or my stepsister Azusa, but we haven\u2019t been talking much lately, so it was awkward.It couldn\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s a bit far, but I\u2019ll go to the school to pick it up.That\u2019s what I thought and went outside. I walked to the nearest bus stop and was about to take the bus, when I realized that I had left my wallet at home.(Forget it. Let\u2019s just walk. \u2026\u2026)I was already tired. I know it would be faster to go home to get my wallet, but I was in the mood to walk, so I decided to walk.My school, Hakuun Daini High School, is about an hour\u2019s walk away. I could have walked there, but by the time I got there, it would be already past 5pm.(It\u2019ll be past 6:00 p.m. when I get home. \u2026\u2026)What should I eat this evening?In the past, my childhood friend Yuzuki would come over to my house to make dinner, but that hasn\u2019t been the case lately. My stepsister, Azusa, seems to be staying at Ryuzaki\u2019s house and treating him to dinner, and I\u2019m eating alone more often than not.I\u2019ve been eating alone more and more. Well, I guess I should just eat something. At worst, I wouldn\u2019t die even if I didn\u2019t eat.With that in mind, I headed for the classroom. Most of the students were already gone. The only ones who were left were those who were doing club activities.(I wonder if Azusa and the others are having fun right now. \u2026\u2026)While thinking about this, I opened the door to the classroom.I thought there would be no one there, but there was a girl inside \u2026\u2026.(Eh? Shimotsuki \u2026?)The seat right behind Ryoma Ryuzaki.There, a white-haired girl was lying face down, breathing in her sleep.\u201cNnya\u2026\u2026 fumuu.\u201dShiho Shimotsuki is asleep, breathing a cute tune.I wondered if she was sleeping soundly. She was talking faintly in her sleep.(What should I do, \u2026\u2026?\u3000Should I wake her up?)For the time being, I will take out the math textbook from my seat.I was hoping that Shimotsuki would sense my presence and wake up, but she was fast asleep.I wondered if I should just pretend I hadn\u2019t seen anything and go home.\u3000 From the way Shimotsuki has reacted so far, it seems that she does not like to be woken up. Even when it was her childhood friend Ryuzaki, her reaction to being woken up was not good.Well, I don\u2019t really know what she is thinking because she is always expressionless.(Well, it doesn\u2019t matter if people hate me. I\u2019m a mob character anyway.)Rather than being hated, I felt guilty about leaving her like this and going home.If Shimotsuki continues to doze off, and returns home late, and is attacked by a suspicious person,\u2026\u2026, I feel unnecessary worry.This is how cute this Shiho Shimotsuki girl looks.She has such good looks that even Ryuzaki, who is not in need of a woman, can\u2019t help but admire her.Probably, it would be better to go home while there is still daylight as much as possible.That\u2019s what I thought, so I decided to wake up Shimotsuki, ready to be hated.\u201cHey. School is over.\u201dI tried to be low-key at first.However, Shimotsuki remains asleep.\u201cMuhehe \u2026\u201dI wonder if she\u2019 s having a very happy dream. She has a lazy smile on her face. I was a little nervous to see her smile, which I don\u2019t usually see.(Damn, I feel kind of bad for looking at her. \u2026\u2026)I wasn\u2019t trying to look at her, but I felt guilty for seeing her sleeping face. I reached out my hand to wake her up quickly, but then I remembered what happened earlier and stopped.(Come to think of it, Shimotsuki wasn\u2019t very good at being touched, was she? \u2026\u2026)When Ryuzaki tried to pat her head, she didn\u2019t like it and brushed his hand away.I think she\u2019s not very good at being touched. Even her childhood friend Ryuzaki was rejected by her, so she must be really bad at it.Thinking this, I decided to shake the desk lightly.As I shook it, I called out to her.\u201cHey. If you don\u2019t get up soon, the sun will set.\u201dThis time, I tried to shout a little harder. That was all I could do, and it seemed that I had finally succeeded in reaching Shimotsuki\u2019s consciousness.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Huh?\u201dAt the same time as her distracted voice leaked out, she slowly looked up.She was about to drool, but then she must have remembered that she was at school.\u201cWhat?\u201dShe hurriedly covered her mouth and looked at me.Her face was a little \u2026\u2026 red, unlike her usual expressionless face.\u201cDid you \u2026\u2026 see that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lend you my \u2026\u2026 handkerchief.\u201dI offered her a handkerchief from my pocket, which she hurriedly took and wiped her mouth.\u201cOh, thank you \u2026\u2026 I showed you something embarrassing.\u201dShe looked away, perhaps embarrassed.As I watched her, I was taken aback.(This is the first time I\u2019ve seen Shimotsuki speak more than a few words. \u2026\u2026!)Apparently, something was wrong with her \u2026\u2026, or rather, she seemed different from usual.In the past, she was unresponsive and uncommunicative in front of Ryuzaki, but now she seems a little different.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you up so suddenly.\u3000But it\u2019s after school. \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026? \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for having you wake me up.\u201dShimotsuki bows her head obediently.The gesture was so unexpected that I was stunned once again.I didn\u2019t expect to be thanked.\u201c\u2018\u2026\u2026?\u3000What\u2019s up with you? You look surprised.\u201dNo, because \u2026\u2026 I always thought of you as a quiet girl, but it turns out you\u2019re not.\u201cYou have a funny face. You look like my dad, who laughs when he\u2019s fed steak in bed. Mom loves him so much that she makes him too much food in the morning, doesn\u2019t she? Can\u2019t you just put yourself in my place and let me get along with you? \u2026\u2026\u201dShiho Shimotsuki is much more talkative than I expected.That\u2019s what was so strange\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I tend to sleep too much at school. \u2026 I mean, it\u2019s boring, isn\u2019t it?\u3000There\u2019s nothing to do but sleep. But at home, I stay up late, you know? I enjoy a lot of TV, anime, online games, and so on.\u201dShiho Shimotsuki, whom I had thought to be a quiet person, was very talkative and told me many things even though I hadn\u2019t asked her.\u201cBut if I come home late, my mom and dad will be worried. I know I\u201dm already in high school, so I don\u201dt think a 6 p.m. curfew is a very acceptable time for me. \u2026\u2026 I wish they\u201dd leave me to my own devices. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeah, yeah. \u2026\u2026 Yeah, maybe.\u201dIn the classroom after school, a beautiful white-haired girl is looking at me, smiling and laughing. I felt as if I was dreaming.\u201cOh, you never told me why. Hey, why are you surprised? Did I do something to surprise you? If so, I would like to apologize, but it would be strange to apologize without knowing the reason.\u201cYes, there\u2019s no need to apologize, but \u2026\u2026 you\u2019re always so quiet, I didn\u2019t expect you to talk so much.\u201dI told her how I honestly felt.But she\u2019s flabbergasted.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Quiet?\u201dHer face looked like she was asking, \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t talk much?\u201d. So I continued my explanation\u201cWell, I\u2019m your classmate, so I see you every once in a while. \u2026\u2026 Most of the time, you\u2019re asleep, and when you do talk, it\u2019s just one word, so I assumed you didn\u2019t talk much. \u2026\u2026 I thought you were quiet.\u201dMaybe she doesn\u2019t know me.She doesn\u2019t recognize me because I\u2019 m a mob character and I\u2019m always in a fog of people. So, I figured that she was confused by the fact that a complete stranger knew who she was, but that seemed to be only my negative thoughts.\u201d I know you\u2019re my classmate, I know you\u2019re number 25, Kotaro Nakayama, and I know that like me you don\u2019t have any friends and you\u2019re always in a daze.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dI was surprised.I was most surprised that such a cute girl knew such a simple guy like me. But she laughed good-naturedly and patted me on the chest.\u201cOh, are you making fun of me? I\u2019m not that stupid. \u2026\u2026 \u00a0I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve always wanted to try this. I don\u2019t have any friends, so I\u2019ve been longing for this kind of playfulness.\u201dThe poke on my chest made me a little nervous.And more than anything, seeing that quiet, icy beauty smiling with a red face like a tomato made me feel embarrassed.Shiho Shimotsuki was perhaps a little excited.\u201cIt\u2019s fun to chat with you like this. Today is a wonderful day. \u2026\u2026 I was sleeping and Nakayama-kun spoke to me. I\u2019m not very good at talking to people, so I waited for a long time, you know?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u2026..\u201d\u201cHow about \u2026\u2026 Naka-chan then? Oh, no. She looks like an idol from a fleet game. Nakayama-kun doesn\u2019t look like an idol, so how about \u2026\u2026 Can I call you Happy Taro-kun? Hmm, that sounds like a snack of cabbage.I\u2019ve never seen a girl think of a nickname with such joy.I also think I\u2019ve never seen anyone talk so quickly at once.I also thought it was quite rare for the conversation to go off on a tangent in so many different directions.\u201cIsn\u2019t Shimotsuki \u2026\u2026 supposed to be a quiet person?\u201dBack to the topic at hand. She knew me. If that was the case, why was she upset when I said she was quiet?She gave me a better explanation than what I was looking for.\u201cI\u2019m not a quiet person.\u3000I\u2019m not a quiet person. \u2026\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t have any friends, so I just don\u2019t get a chance to talk to anyone. I\u2019m also a little shy\u2026\u2026, but I love chatting with people like this. It\u2019s rude to call me a quiet .\u201dShe poked me on my chest again. I think it\u2019s a bit misdirected to call it joking around. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s probably true that she didn\u2019t have any friends.This girl\u2019s talk was too one-sided.She said so many things in rapid succession that I didn\u2019t have time to interrupt her.If that\u2019s the case, why was she so quiet in front of \u2026\u2026 that guy?\u201cBut Ryuzaki talks to you a lot, why haven\u2019t you talked to him so far? I\u2019ve watched you from time to time, but I\u2019ve never seen you talking to Ryuzaki.\u201dI forcefully insert the topic into our conversation. I had to do that, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been able to end Shimotsuki\u2019s speech.And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to ask her.\u2026\u2026 She told me why she was so talkative only in front of me.\u201cRyoma Ryuzaki\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment I mentioned that name, the color disappeared from Shimotsuki\u2019s face.She reverted back to the transparent and cold girl that I always see, and said this in an emotionless voice.\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m really not fond of that guy. He talks to me a lot, he\u2019s been next to me since I was little, and he\u2019s creepy.\u201d\u201cEh !?\u201dThe reason seemed to be simple.The main character of the popular and harem protagonist, Ryuuzaki, probably liked his childhood friend, Shiho Shimotsuki, who hated \u2026\u2026 him.\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of those who cheat on others. I like boys who are straightforward and honest. \u2026\u2026 I like boys who are naive, quiet, and kind enough to listen to me.\u201dFurthermore, he was messing up.I see \u2026 she hates people who unfaithful.If so, it seems that Ryuzaki\u2019s feelings will never be rewarded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She is a very vocal girl.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a coincidence that we went to the same high school. I never consciously wanted to go to the same school as him. I don\u2019t know if he had any other options.\u3000It\u2019s creepy, he always asked me where I\u2019m planning to go to high school, it\u2019s like he\u2019s stalking me.\u201dNo, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a stalker. \u2026\u2026 I think Ryuzaki likes Shimotsuki.I was curious to see how she would react if I told her that, but I thought that was indeed unfortunate.By the way, it\u2019s not Ryuzaki. It was Shimotsuki who was pitiful.\u201cFate is awful. I have the right to choose, but why does it keep trying to get to me like that? \u2026\u2026 Ugh, I feel a shiver run down my spine. I don\u2019t like the sound of his voice. \u2026\u2026 It sounds like an insensitive, self-centered person who can\u2019t perceive the feelings of others.\u201dI know it sounds harsh, but it seems that she understands the true nature of Ryuzaki because they are literally childhood friends connected by their decaying relationship.It is true that he is insensitive. Especially when it comes to love, he\u2019s very unaware of it. Even when my stepsister, childhood friend or former best friend like him, he can\u2019t read their feelings. I think he\u2019s dense and dull.That\u2019s what Shimotsuki doesn\u2019t seem to like about him.\u201cPeople who use such a tone hurt a lot of people. But that\u2019s not a problem that can be dismissed as being dull, and I think it also requires a greater effort to understand the feelings of others. \u2026\u2026 Ugh, that gives me the chills. If he liked me, I\u2019d have to carry the grief of all the other girls. It\u2019s hard, and I feel like crying when I think of all those girls who won\u2019t get their reward.\u201dShimotsuki held her arms together and rubbed them as if she was really cold.Yeah \u2026\u2026, after all, Ryuzaki might like you, right? I can\u2019t say that. I felt that if I said it, Shimotsuki would probably have a stroke.I think that\u2019s how much she dislikes Ryuzaki.\u201cSo, although we\u2019re childhood friends, we\u2019re just acquaintances, okay? Pfft. Oh, that was just how I show my anger. My mom says it\u2019s \u2018cute\u2019 when I do it like this, but I wonder if she\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think it works very well.\u201d\u2026\u2026 She\u2019 s very talkative.She was so quiet in front of Ryuzaki, still it was surprising.\u201d You were just being unsociable because you\u2019re not fond of Ryuzaki, but the real Shimotsuki is like this.\u201dI was surprised, but I couldn\u2019t help but understand.I\u2019m not a fan of Ryuzaki either. It\u2019s a personal grudge, because the people I loved were taken away from me, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strictly the same feeling as Shimotsuki.But if that\u2019s the case,\u2026\u2026, then there was still a question.\u201cThen why did you show your true colors to someone like me?\u3000I don\u2019t think I\u2019m someone who\u2019s attractive enough to be liked by Shimotsuki.\u201dWhy did it have to be me?I just happened to be in the classroom after school. It was a shame to show the real Shimotsuki to such a person.Why did they give me a special look to this loser who was such a mob character and couldn\u2019t even hold together the hearts of the people who he loved \u2026\u2026?Seeing me in such a negative mood, Shimotsuki smiled happily.Apparently, there is a good reason\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was born with good hearing, so I can usually tell by the sound of a \u2026\u2026 person\u2019s voice or heartbeat what kind of feelings they are having. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like Ryuzaki-kun. The sound he makes is dull and harmless, just background noise.\u201dShimotsuki\u2019s ears twitched, as if she had a nerve connection. She continued to talk, showing off her impressive skills in a low-key way.\u201cIn this respect, your sound is very delicate. I can hear the sound of sadness, pain and sorrow. At the same time, I also hear a strange sound like strong grudge. Ummm, that\u2019s a strange sound. It\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s interesting how they all work together in harmony to create these sounds.\u201dShe shuffled her feet and closed her eyes to listen.She closed her eyes and listened, as if she was checking my sound.I\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity to talk to you like this for a long time. \u2026\u2026 Wow, Nakayama-kun is just what I expected. He participates in a lot of my chatter \u2026.I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a bad match.\u201d\u2026\u2026 She\u2019 s saying a lot of complicated things.In short, this girl\u2026\u201cYou mean you like me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the best way to sum it up.\u3000It would be more pleasant to say that we seemed to have good chemistry.\u201dApparently, that\u2019s what she meant.When I heard those words, I \u2026\u2026 became aware of a swirling dark emotion in my chest.(The childhood friend that Ryuzaki likes, likes me\u2026\u2026!)It\u2019s as though I succeeded in getting back at him.A wicked feeling boiled up in my chest. I know I shouldn\u2019t think like that, but I couldn\u2019t help it.It was as if I had taken away the loved one of the person, who had taken away the people I loved.I felt such a sensation, and at the same time, I felt pity for myself for thinking such a thing.I\u2019m sure the girls hated me for having such a personality,\u2026\u2026 and as I was thinking about such strange things, Shimotsuki unexpectedly put her hand on my chest.\u201cYeah and \u2026\u2026 Nakayama, you sound so weird sometimes. I hear a sound that is riddled with self-loathing, or rather \u2026\u2026 that makes me want to cry when I hear it. It\u2019s like a kitten purring desperately in a cardboard box on a rainy day.\u201dI wondered if she was checking the sound of my heart.The touch of her thin, small fingers make me feel a little nervous.Seeing me like that, she laughed again.\u201cI have a habit of wanting to cheer up people who are sad. Nakayama-kun looks like you\u2019 re in a lot of pain. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019d be happy to cheer you up, even if only a little. It\u2019s not a problem. I grew up with a wonderful mom and dad who loved me a lot, so I\u2019m full of love. If I keep getting so much, God will get angry, so I\u2019ll share some of it with you.\u201dI was taken aback by Shimotsuki\u2019s smiling face as she said this.I thought she was a girl with a unique view of the world.But there is also a feeling of joy in being liked by such a girl\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to get back at Ryuzaki, but it\u2019s pure joy.\u201cI\u2019d also like to make friends with you, talk to you, play games with you, if you\u2019d like. I\u2019ve been so lonely and I\u2019m starving for friends. Also, sometimes they make you have a partner in class or something. I\u2019m not good at that either, and I need help.\u201d\u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot \u2026\u2026 going on here.\u201dRather, I feel that there is more going on here.But I couldn\u2019t be happier if such a wonderful girl would be my friend.\u201cI look forward to working with you from now on, Nakayama-kun.\u201dShimotsuki innocently reached out her hand to me.I\u2019m not sure if I should grab her hand or not\u2026\u2026, but by then Shimotsuki had already grabbed my hand forcefully.\u201cIt\u2019s so rude to hesitate.\u201dWhen I saw her cheeks puff out, I couldn\u2019t help but relax.\u201cSorry. Pleased to be with you.\u201dI said, and shook her hand tightly.That\u2019s how I made a friend.The person I was meeting, was the person I grew to love, \u2026. the person I love\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s time like this if you\u2019re crazy about chatting \u2026 It\u2019s almost dark, and it might be very dangerous for a girl to walk alone during this time. By the way, my friend Nakayama. What do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, what do you think?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking if I should be allowed to go home alone at a time like this. Do you think Nakayama-kun, a reasonable boy who just became my friend, will leave me, a beautiful girl, go home alone?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home \u2026\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t ignore such a blatant demand for a walk home.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t you hate it, if someone saw you walking alone with me?\u201dI thought to myself, \u201cIf I\u2019m such a mob character, I won\u2019t be able to balance the cute heroine, Shimotsuki.\u201d That\u2019s what I thought, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter to her.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you think I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t understand why you are so negative when all I want to do is go home with my friends. Do you want me to comfort you? Alright, good boy, why don\u2019t you come home with me?\u201dShimotsuki stands up and pats me on the head.No, wait a minute \u2026 I don\u2019t want that.I mean.This person looked like she didn\u2019t want Ryuzaki to pat her head, but I wonder if it\u2019s okay for her to pat me. \u2026\u2026 No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like the act of being patted, it\u2019s simply that she doesn\u2019t want to be touched, because she doesn\u2019t like Ryuzaki.This girl seems to have a weakness for Ryuzaki.I thought it was kind of rare to have a childhood friend heroine who rejects the popular and harem-oriented hero.Normally, the heroine would take the initiative to become a member of the harem.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve always wanted to go home with my friends like this. It\u2019s so nice to be a student. \u2026\u2026 Hey, what do you want to talk about? I have a lot of hobbies, even though I may look like this.\u3000I like games, anime, TV, anything. Ah, but, you know, no comics and novels, okay? I\u2019m not very good at reading and writing.\u201dAs she leads me on her way, she continues to speak in rapid succession.I\u2019m not sure if this is really a conversation, but it\u2019s interesting to hear what kind of things Shimotsuki is interested in.Surprisingly, she likes subcultures. No, it\u2019s not surprising. It seems that hobbies that used to be called otaku a long time ago are becoming more common nowadays.\u201cBut first, you know what? It\u2019s a little strange to call you \u201cNakayama-kun\u201d when you\u2019re my friend. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s more convenient to have a nickname. What do you think? Do you have any suggestions, Nakayama-kun?\u201dAnd it seems that Shimotsuki is obsessed with nicknames.For her, a friend seems to mean a person who calls someone by a particular nickname.\u201cHmmm, what should we do?\u201dWe walked out of the school gate and down the street.Speaking of which, where does Shimotsuki live? I don\u2019t know where she lives, but since I said I\u2019d walk her home, I\u2019ll have to follow her home, wherever she goes.I\u2019ll be alone when I get home anyway.I don\u2019t have to worry about the time.\u201cI think anything is fine.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what. Nakayama-kun is so unaffected. \u2026\u2026 He\u2019s just like me when Ryuzaki-kun is next to me. You can\u2019t be that boring, okay? Meh.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That would mean that Shimotsuki is a boring person, is that okay with you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m a very boring person in front of Ryuzaki-kun, but I think it\u2019s a little strange that he talks to me like that. What\u2019s so good about a girl like me who\u2019 s unsociable and doesn\u2019t talk? Is it the face? Then why doesn\u2019t he just thank my mom and dad for giving me those genes instead of me?\u201dI think you\u2019re missing the point a little.Maybe she has a disease that kills her if she doesn\u2019t talk to me all the time. We talked the whole way home. It was strange because she seemed to be enjoying talking even though I was only giving her a few cues in between.But it seems that Shimotsuki just likes to talk, not that she\u2019 s good at it.Since then, we\u2019ve been going off on too many off-topic conversations and haven\u2019t been able to talk about the main topic. In the end, we couldn\u2019t even decide on a nickname.\u201cOh? It looks like we\u2019 ve already arrived at my house. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019 s so much fun to chat with friends. The always boring way home went by so fast and I think I got a little excited. Thank you for keeping me company, Nakayama-kun.\u201dSmiling, she shook my hand one last time.She said she was shaking hands with me, but this girl seemed to be very close to her friends. It was unexpected and made me nervous.\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. See you tomorrow \u2026\u201dWith a final wave, she walked into the house.The Shimotsuki family was a house like any other. I thought she might have come from a rich family because of her out-of-this-world appearance, but she seemed more normal than I thought.\u201cI should go back too \u2026\u2026.\u201dShimotsuki\u2019s house was quite close to the school.It\u2019s only about fifteen minutes away and since it\u2019s in the same direction as my house, I can walk straight home.I was already used to walking home alone.Today, thanks to Shimotsuki\u2026\u2026, my walk was easier than usual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come to think of it, are the Shimotsuki family neighbors of the Ryuzaki family? Maybe I passed by them yesterday when I was walking Shimotsuki home?Well, so what?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dI prepare for the morning in silence. I haven\u2019t eaten breakfast lately. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to prepare it myself.It\u2019s times like this that I realize how much I appreciate my parents. My parents were out of town on a business trip, but I wanted to see them for the first time in a long time.Maybe I\u2019m starving for the warmth of someone.In the past, there were girls who were close to me. My stepsister, Azusa, my childhood friend, Yuuki and my best friend, Kirari, \u2026\u2026, I thought we had a good relationship, but it seems I was wrong.My life changed completely when the girls found someone they liked.They\u2019 re at the age where they fall in love. It\u2019s understandable that they would be obsessed with someone, but the fact that he\u2019s the harem protagonist, Ryuzaki Ryoma, is a little troubling.This is not even jealousy \u2026\u2026, it\u2019s just resentment.It\u2019s also a grudge, almost like the sad backstabbing of a mob character who can\u2019t even be jealous.\u201cHuh \u2026\u2026 school, let\u2019s go.\u201dThere\u2019s no point in being alone and aimless.I left the house a little early. I took the bus to the school.But today was not my lucky day.Just as I arrived at the school, I came across Ryuzaki flirting with his harem members.I was on my way from the school gate to the school building.The girls were flirting without regard to the fact that they were being watched by others.I wish I didn\u2019t have to be the one to see it.\u201cGet Ryoma\u2019s right hand!\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s not fair. Then I\u2019ll take his left hand!\u201d\u201d Eh~? Where would I get one? Then, your back!\u201d\u201cHey, this is heavy! I can\u2019 t walk!\u201dI felt like my brain was going to melt just by looking \u2026\u2026I would have loved to have that done to me, but \u2026\u2026 that dream never came true. Looking back, the girls were not very outgoing with me. Maybe they were just hanging out with me due to habit, and I didn\u2019t really feel special to them.I felt like my brain would get messed up if I kept looking at them, so I walked quickly past them.I got pretty close to them, but they didn\u2019t notice me. \u2026\u2026 I was very sad about that.I guess I\u2019ve become a mob character to them.I am one of the many others, a part of the background, an existence that doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m there or not.When I realize this, I feel a sense of emptiness.Just when I was about to become negative, I thought, \u201cI\u2019m just a piece of trash who can\u2019t make anything out of my life. \u2026\u2026\u201dI arrived at the classroom and took a seat.As if she had been waiting for that moment, a girl walked up to me.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe transparent silvery-white hair fluttered. She was so beautiful that I had the illusion that particles were dancing in her path, \u2026\u2026 drawing gentle lines.\u201cOh, good morning, \u2026\u2026 good morning!\u201dThe only thing is that she seems to be acting a bit suspicious.She was so talkative yesterday, but her mouth doesn\u2019t seem to be working so well today.\u201cOh, good morning \u2026\u2026, what\u2019s up?\u201dI called out to Shimotsuki as she came up to me, leaving behind her lovely footsteps.(TLN: ( \u30fb\u25c7\u30fb)\uff1f)She looks around and puts her face close to my ear.I get a close-up of her beautiful face and I almost backed away.I was sitting on a chair so I could only lean back, but Shimotsuki moved closer as if to say that it didn\u2019t matter.Then she said in a quiet voice.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m shy. I\u2019m just too nervous to talk in front of other people. \u2026\u2026. I\u2019m just a little cautious.

Shimotsuki is a shy person, huh?\u201dI see. So that\u2019s why she can\u2019t talk loudly and behaves suspiciously.Well, she\u2019s never going to admit it. She was shaking her head, as if she really didn\u2019t want to be thought of as shy.\u201c\u201dNo, no, no, it\u2019s different!\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t persuade her, because I couldn\u2019t properly express myself.The talkative Shiho-chan seems to be very shy\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, no matter how hard she tried, no matter how many excuses she made, she still looked shy.I think she is a bit of a shy person, or perhaps a introvert.And from what I heard yesterday, she seems to have very keen hearing. She has a good ear, right?\u3000Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s so concerned about the presence of others.It was when, I was thinking about that.At last, the Ryuzaki group, who had been flirting outside the school building, seemed to have arrived at the classroom.\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been feeling your breasts for a while now, you know?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re touching, right?

Tell me who\u2019s the best?\u201d\u201cWho is the best, \u2026 I can\u2019t decide\u2013\u201cThat\u2019s when it happened.Ryuzaki\u2019s gaze turned to me. I think he was looking for Shimotsuki. It\u2019s always Shimotsuki that he\u2019s chasing with his eyes.And Ryuzaki saw it.Shiho Shimotsuki, his childhood friend, with her face close to my ear.\u201cWhat!?\u201dEven though he hadn\u2019t finished his conversation with Azusa and the others, he walked right up to us.His eyes were intense as he stared at me. The hostility in his eyes was so blatant that it baffled me.\u201cOh, hey, Shiho? What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s rare to see you awake, since you\u2019re usually asleep all the time. If there\u2019s something wrong, I\u2019ll help you.\u201dHe seemed to be in a rush, angry, or upset.In response to Ryuzaki, who spoke to her with such an attitude, Shimotsuki \u2026\u2026 instantly erased the color from her expression.After all, she seems to be extremely uncomfortable with Ryuzaki.Just by talking to him, the lovely face that she had been showing me until a moment ago suddenly turned cold.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 not really.\u201dThen she said only one word and turned away.She was back to the quiet, ice-like Shimotsuki I had always seen.However, the insensitive Ryuzaki doesn\u2019t understand Shimotsuki\u2019s feelings.With his usual smug attitude, he is trying to impose his one-sided good will.\u201cHow can there not be something? It\u2019s unusual for Shiho to talk to strangers. \u2026\u2026 Look, when you\u2019re in trouble, it\u2019s better to turn to someone who knows, right? Don\u2019t be shy.\u201dRyuzaki tried to touch Shimotsuki\u2019s shoulder in a friendly manner.However, she stepped back as if rejecting him.It seemed like she was hiding behind me.Then, naturally, I would have to face Ryuzaki.\u201d Uh, \u2026\u2026? I\u2019m sorry. My childhood friend Shiho seems to have caused you trouble.\u201dThen Ryuzaki looked at me with his head tilted.The look on his face was like, \u201cWas there a guy like this in my class?\u201d. He looked as if he wanted to say that.Such an attitude made me feel as if my mind was turning cloudy and black. \u2026\u2026 Such an image struck me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s been over a month since the entrance ceremony, and you don\u2019t even know your fellow classmate\u2019s names?\u201dMy voice became agitated.I couldn\u2019t control myself. I\u2019m sure I\u2019 m trying to stab Ryuzaki to death with the barbs of my words.I was about to say something I shouldn\u2019t have, when I couldn\u2019t control my frustration.\u201cI know you, don\u2019t I? You\u2019re Ryoma Ryuzaki, right? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s good-looking, gets good grades, cooks well, and has lots of friends.\u201dI know the protagonist-sama, because I\u2019 m a mob character.Or rather, he\u2019s my classmate. I know his name regardless of whether he\u2019s a protagonist or a mob character.We\u2019re on equal footing, he and I. We\u2019re the same people, freshmen in high school.\u201cCan you at least remember their names? It\u2019s rude to your classmates,\u201d I nearly said something I wouldn\u2019t have said under normal circumstances.It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to pick a fight with him.But I feel like saying something unnecessary to this guy.That\u2019s how much I dislike Ryuzaki.But the one who stopped me from doing so was that girl.\u201cHai!\u201dAs if to step in between us.Despite her obvious shyness, it was Shimotsuki, who was standing next to me watching the scene, who mustered up the courage to speak up loudly.She seemed to have noticed that something was wrong with me.She interrupted me and then squeezed something into my hand.\u201cI\u2019ll give this back, okay?\u201dWhat she gave me was the handkerchief I had lent her yesterday.I remembered, that I had lent it to her because she was drooling in her sleep.\u3000 Then she said something to me in my ear.\u201cCalm down. You\u2019ll get miserable, if you act like that. Here, I\u2019ll share my feelings with you. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll see you later, okay?\u201dWith that, she went back to her seat.Watching her go, I clutched the handkerchief and \u2026\u2026 felt the faint warmth of Shimotsuki. The warmth soothed my rough heart.Through the handkerchief, I felt as if her kind feelings were flowing into my body. \u2026\u2026That\u2019s right. There\u2019s nothing to be solved by venting my frustration.It\u201ds not like I can get anything by being angry here.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Uh, what do you mean?\u201dI guess he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Ryuzaki was looking at me and Shimotsuki alternately with a puzzled look on his face.I was about to get annoyed again when I saw his face, but I took a small breath and regained my composure.Yeah, I\u2019m okay. There\u2019s no point in fighting here.I\u2019m just a mob character anyway. It\u2019s not like anything is going to change if I stand up to the protagonist.So, as usual, I\u2019ll just play it off.With a fuzzy smile, I\u2019ll become a part of the \u2026\u2026 background like a mob character.And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all right, because my feelings for the people I loved will never be reciprocated.\u201cI lent her my handkerchief yesterday. I just got that back, nothing special.\u201dI say something appropriate and shrug my shoulders.Then, this time, I spoke a little more firmly.\u201cMy name is Kotaro Nakayama. I\u2019m a part of the same class as Ryuzaki. \u2026\u2026 It would be great, if you could remember me.\u201dI proclaimed this and glared at Ryuzaki.It was at this moment that he finally recognized my existence.He glared back at me strongly.\u201cOh, I memorized it\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you, Nakayama.\u201dWith that, Ryuzaki went back to his seat. I looked at his back and took a breath.It was a close call, and I almost exploded.It\u2019s very misplaced to get angry with Ryuzaki in the first place.I\u2019m just a loser.I should have been a mob character and kept quiet.Besides, I almost caused trouble for Shimotsuki.I\u2019ll have to thank her later for helping me out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I guess the reason she came to me in the morning was to return my handkerchief. She doesn\u2019t talk to me unless she has something to say.My seat was at the back of the class on the hallway side, and Shimotsuki\u2019s seat was at the back by the window. Right in front of her was Ryuzaki, with Azusa and Yuuki sitting around him.The so-called protagonist\u2019s seat was occupied by Shimotsuki. Well, I think Ryuzaki is more of a protagonist than Shimotsuki, but it seems the rule was not triggered by the seat change.Anyway, I guess Shimotsuki and Ryuzaki really do have a rotten relationship. It\u2019s strange that their seats are so close to each other.However, Shimotsuki is not very good at talking to Ryuzaki, so she sleeps face down all the time to prevent him from talking to her too much.That\u2019s why Shimotsuki didn\u2019t have a chance to talk to me in class this morning.However, I am concerned about the fact that she keeps glancing at me \u2026\u2026 like she wants to say something, but she doesn\u2019t come to me, so I don\u2019t really understand.As I was tilting my head, I was unexpectedly spoken to by a boy sitting next to me. His name was Souma Hanagishi. He was a classmate and an acquaintance that I only talked to once in a while. With a curious look on his face, he handed me a piece of paper.\u201cNakayama, it came from someone nearby. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s rather refreshing to get a letter in high school, isn\u2019t it?\u201dDuring math class, Hanagishi speaks to me in a whisper so that the teacher standing at the lectern won\u2019t notice. What is the letter? I had no idea, so I accepted the letter, expressing my gratitude.I took out the paper contained in a cute letterhead.On it, \u201cDear Nakayama-kun\u201d was written in cute round characters like an elementary school student.Or rather, I\u2019m curious about the hiragana. \u2026\u2026 Since it is a name that uses only kanji learned in elementary school, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult.While thinking about this, I read through the words inside.There was something like this written on it.\u201cGood Morning, Lunch, let\u2019s eat. From \u201cYour Friend\u201d.\u201d\u2026\u2026 I see. The sender is Shimotsuki. She was the only friend I had in this class, so I knew right away.But it was hmmm \u2026\u2026 strange that she was a high school student but her writing was poor or \u2026\u2026 strange. She doesn\u2019t use kanji robustly, and her sentence structure is just weird. The round characters are cute, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t feel any intelligence.But I understood what she was trying to say.She asked me to have lunch with her.Of course I agreed. I usually just eat the pastries I bought, at my seat during my lunch break, so it was no problem.The only problem is how to reply. \u2026\u2026 Should I send a letter to her as well?But, as I thought, exchanging letters at this age is embarrassing.I wondered if there was any way I could tell her. I looked at Shimotsuki. Then I saw her glancing at me.She had her head on her hands, making it look like she was concentrating on the class, but her eyes were looking at me every few seconds. Because of this, I was also making eye contact with the students seated between me and Shimotsuki, but every time I did, they immediately looked away, which made me very suspicious of their behavior.\u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki may look perfect, but she\u2019 s pretty clumsy in some ways. I feel that there are a lot of things that are quite wrong with her, in terms of human interaction at least.Well, it is convenient, if she is looking at me.(Okay)I made a sign with my index finger and thumb and gave the \u201cOK\u201d sign.A few seconds later, Shimotsuki looked at me, so I guess she got the message.As proof, Shimotsuki\u2019s expression clearly brightened, so I was sure she got the message. She usually doesn\u2019t talk much, but I think she easily shows her emotions in her expressions.She was obviously happy to be eating lunch with me. \u2026\u2026 She was cute, after all and I was happy to see her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that she\u2019 s getting shy, and she\u2019s too nervous to speak.It\u2019s quite unusual to be shy just because of the presence of others.Perhaps as a countermeasure, Shimotsuki suddenly offered me a note. I reflexively accepted the note, which read, \u201cFollow me.\u201dIt seems she had prepared it in advance. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s kind of cute.\u201cOkay.\u201dI nodded and Shimotsuki snickered a little smugly. She looked like she could easily communicate without talking to me.I guess she\u2019 s already acquired a taste for the art of writing letters. I am sure I will be receiving many more letters like this in the future.And so, I followed Shimotsuki.Her footsteps sounded very light, perhaps due to the low coefficient of gravity she was subjected to. Her steps were fast, and if I wasn\u2019t careful, I might lose her, so I followed carefully.What I found was a place where there was no sign of anyone at all.A corner behind the school building. It was a blind spot and I was surprised that such a place existed.\u201cThis is my secret place, you know? You see, it\u2019s completely empty. I always eat my lunch here. I\u2019ve always wanted to have lunch here with my friends one day. \u2026\u2026 One of my dreams has come true.\u201dWhen the two of us were alone, Shimotsuki became instantly talkative. I am grateful that she explains things to me before I ask.\u201cIt\u2019s a quiet place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI know, right? I have been alone since I was born. I\u2019m good at finding places where there are no people. The only place I can eat lunch more quietly than here is in the teachers\u2019 restroom.\u201dHowever, I was a little afraid that I could sense the darkness of Shimotsuki in every word she said.She seemed innocent enough, but she might be carrying a lot of dark traits.\u201cThe toilet is not a place to eat food, though.\u201dWith a wry smile, I tried to open the bag of buns I had bought that morning.However, I couldn\u2019t eat it yet due to the fact that Shimotsuki was staring at me like she wanted to say something.\u201cHmm? Hey? Huh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShe was staring at me so much that I couldn\u2019t help but ask her why.As if she\u2019d been waiting for that moment, Shimotsuki began to speak vigorously.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Hey, Nakayama-kun, you talk to me when I talk to you, but why did you pretend to be someone else in the classroom?\u3000I was really looking forward to it, you know?\u3000I was expecting you to come up to me every break time and talk to me while wagging your tail like a puppy, but all you do is mope around like a koala. It\u2019s like I\u2019m the only one who likes you. It\u2019s unfair as a friend. I want you to talk to me more in class and I want you to love me as a friend.\u201dIt seems that she was dissatisfied with my attitude in the classroom.I want to apologize for that. But before that, I want to say something.\u201cLove is \u2026\u2026 a heavy word.\u201dIt was like a lover. And it is quite a heavy type.I think Shimotsuki is asking too much of our friendship. I really wanted to be a little more casual with her.\u201cAfter I spoke to you this morning, I suddenly realized. I thought, \u201d What?\u201d. So, I waited for you, but you didn\u2019t talk to me. I wrote you a note. That\u2019s okay, because it was very fun, but you have to be more active, okay? I\u2019m a very lonely person.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u2026\u2026\u201dI was expecting her to be quiet and unemotional like ice, but when I saw her, I realized that she was very human.\u201cI\u2019m not very good at writing, so it was really hard for me. \u2026\u2026 Well, the letter was more fun than I expected, so I\u2019ll keep doing it, okay?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the cause of that elementary school-like note was Shimotsuki\u2019s language skills. Come to think of it, yesterday she said that she can\u2019t read manga or novels because they have weird sentences in them. \u2026\u2026 Hmm?\u3000Could it be that this girl is quite a little silly?\u201dI\u2019ve always assumed that because she looks good, she\u2019s also smart. I sensed that she reeked of clumsiness.\u201cBut it\u2019s great that you can say you\u2019re sorry. I forgive you. From now on, you have to be more patient with me, okay? You\u2019re my friend, so you have to talk to me a lot, okay? Okay, that\u2019s enough. Lecture over.\u201dAnd it seems I was being lectured.I see, this is the reason why I felt like, I was being watched in class. I guess she wanted to lecture me the whole time. \u2026\u2026 After finishing her various comments, Shimotsuki looked very refreshed.The quiet girl may be a troublesome and annoying person.Yet, I found that part of her attractive, which made me wonder\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m starving. School is boring and dull, but lunch is the only thing that\u2019s really nice.\u201dNo, I\u2019m not feeling sad about it.It seemed to Shimotsuki that I was. She rubbed my back in a comforting way. I feel like I\u2019m being treated like a child. \u2026\u2026 Oh well.\u201cShall we sit down? Oh, maybe you\u2019re too germophobic to sit outside? If that\u2019s the case, you can stand, but I\u2019ll have to keep looking up and my neck will get tired.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll sit down.\u201dThe back of the school building is deserted. Shimotsuki sits down on a step. I sat down next to her, with a good distance between us.The distance between us is about one meter. I thought this was the kind of distance between me and Shimotsuki, but \u2026\u2026 it seems to be a little too far.\u201c\u201dHey, hey, look at this. Don\u2019t you think my bento looks delicious?\u201dShe approached me at once.The distance between us was only about 10 centimeters.(Isn\u2019t this close?)We are so close that our bodies touch when we move. But that seems to be how Shimotsuki feels about the distance between her and her friends. She was not aware of the closeness at all and continued talking as if it was natural.\u201cMy mom is very good at cooking, and without any favoritism from our family, it\u2019s really delicious. \u2026\u2026 Oh, would you like to try some egg rolls? We make it sweet, but even if Nakayama-kun is a picky eater, he will find it delicious. That\u2019s how good my mom is at cooking. Here you go. Don\u2019t be shy, okay? Ahh.\u201dThis time, she offered me an egg roll with her chopsticks like a lover.\u201cWhat? Hmm?\u201dWe\u2019re friends, right?It\u2019s not like we\u2019re dating in Shimotsuki\u2019s mind, is it?I\u2019ve never confessed or been confessed to anyone in my memory, though I\u2019m flattered by that.If that\u2019s the case, then what is this closeness?It seems like Shimotsuki adores me to the point where I can\u2019t really understand her concept of a friend.It\u2019s only been two days since we became friends, but \u2026\u2026 I wonder if this girl was really starving for a friend.If that was the case, I felt a little self-conscious about turning her down.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to eat it? It\u2019s so good. \u2026\u2026\u201dThen, when she gave me a sad look, I couldn\u2019t reject her.\u201cYes, thank you. \u2026\u2026\u201dSo I ate the egg roll she offered me.It tasted \u2026\u2026 good, I think. To be honest, I didn\u2019t really understand it. I think I was confused because it was the first time I had ever been approached like this.\u201cHow is it? Is it good? Isn\u2019t my mom amazing?\u201dI just nodded my head as Shimotsuki asked for my opinion.\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing. It tastes delicious.\u201d\u201d I know, right? There\u2019s nothing my mom can\u2019t cook. She loves my dad so much that she always puts a lot of effort into cooking for him. And I get to reap the benefits of that, too, which makes me very happy.\u201dShimotsuki seems to be more pleased when her mother is praised than she is when she is praised herself.She must be a kind girl who loves her family. Knowing this side of her makes her even more attractive to me. That\u2019s why I was embarrassed to have acted like a lover with such a girl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She talks vividly about what she felt and how she feels about trivial things.Maybe that\u2019s why I never get tired of listening to her.I was thinking that it would not be a bad idea to continue to listen to Shimotsuki until the very end of the lunch break\u2026\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Shimotsuki shut her mouth.Her small ears twitched, and then she instantly lost her expression.With a transparent complexion, Shimotsuki whispered in a low voice.\u201cThere\u2019s a disgusting sound. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s the sound I hate the most in this world.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what she was talking about at the time.A dozen or so seconds later, I saw the person who had come to us and realized the reason for her statement.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ryoma Oni-chan. I didn\u2019t mean to call you here. \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter though? It\u2019s still in the middle of lunch, so please hurry up, okay? I want to eat the bento that Yuzuki made for me, it\u2019s delicious.\u201dTwo people, a guy and a girl, suddenly arrived at the back of the school building. They didn\u2019t seem to have noticed us sitting in the corner yet and they were facing each other, trying to talk about something.They were people I knew well.One was my stepsister, Azusa Nakayama.The other was someone I disliked, someone Shimotsuki had a deep dislike for.\u201cRyoma Ryuzaki \u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but mutter his name.He has black hair, black eyes, and a medium build, not much different from me in terms of features. However, he has an overwhelmingly gorgeous appearance and aura. It\u2019s an aura that only a person with absolute confidence in himself can produce.\u201cHmm? Why is Nakayama here \u2026\u2026, hey!\u201dAnd then he looked at us and as soon as he knew she was there, his expression changed.\u201cShiho \u2026\u2026, what are you doing with Nakayama? Just the two of you, what\u2019s going on?\u201dIt was probably because Shiho Shimotsuki, whom he liked, was sitting side-by-side with a guy.The girl liked by Ryuzaki, who has always been liked by women, is alone with a guy who is as insignificant as a mob character. I\u2019m sure a lot of emotions must be bubbling up in him.\u201cThe timing is bad. \u2026\u2026 Haha, boring.\u201dAs soon as Ryuzaki recognized us, Shimotsuki sighed.She let out a disgusted sounding voice that they couldn\u2019t hear and quickly began to put her own lunch away.\u201cNakayama-kun, shall we go back?\u3000I don\u2019t want to hear the sound of that guy.\u201dYeah, you\u2019re right.I want to go back too\u2026\u2026, but I don\u2019t think Ryuzaki will be satisfied with that.And perhaps it is Shimotsuki, not me, who will be questioned after returning from this.As proof of this, Ryuzaki was looking straight at Shimotsuki.He looked like he wanted to ask something.That\u2019s just too pathetic.Shiho Shimotsuki is a girl who doesn\u2019t like Ryuzaki.She\u2019s very emotional and loves to talk, but she hates him so much that when he\u2019s next to her, she turns into a mute girl as cold as ice.I don\u2019t want to burden her too much.I don\u2019t want her to have a hard time just because she became my friend.So, I shook my head.\u201cNo, Ryuzaki wants to talk to me, so I\u2019ll stay here at \u2026\u2026. Go ahead and leave.\u201dWhen I told her that, Shimotsuki\u2019s eyes widened slightly.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Sometimes, Nakayama, you make me wonder. You seem like a normal boy, but you sound unusual. \u2026\u2026 Ummm, that\u2019s nice. I\u2019m going back first. I\u2019ll see you later and we can chat a lot, okay?\u201dThen, after a lot of words spoken in a quiet voice, Shimotsuki stood up.\u201cOh, hey. Shiho, what are you whispering about? I told you before that if you ever need help, I\u2019m here to help. \u2026\u2026 Hey, Shiho?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShimotsuki passed by Ryuzaki in silence.She walked away without even looking at him.And after that, only me, Ryuzaki \u2026\u2026 and my stepsister Azusa remained.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What have you been doing with Shiho!?\u201dRyuzaki yelled at me like he was about to grab me by the chest.I guess he\u2019s upset. His face, which is usually full of composure and a wry smile, is distorted with confusion. Seeing this, I felt a dark emotion rising up in me.It seems I am not a very friendly person. I found it interesting that Ryuzaki was so upset.I\u2019m aware of it, but I can\u2019t resist it. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to be able to control myself now that I don\u2019t have Shimotsuki next to me\u2026\u2026.\u201cShiho is weak, you know. She\u2019s so sickly that she gets sick if she doesn\u2019t sleep all the time, even at school. \u2026\u2026 Maybe you brought her outside!\u201d\u2026\u2026 sickly and weak?I\u2019ve never heard of that.I\u2019ve been friends with Shimotsuki for two days now and I\u2019ve never seen her show any signs of being sickly.In fact, she seems to be quite healthy.She said that the reason she sleeps at school is because she is bored and at home she would rather stay up all night playing games or something. \u2026\u2026 What does that mean?(Maybe that\u2019s what this guy thinks?)Ryuzaki probably doesn\u2019t know Shimotsuki very well.It\u2019s not surprising if you look at her attitude. She was cold towards Ryuzaki at all times and would not speak to him. \u2026\u2026 I feel that Ryuzaki has made up his own mind that she is sickly and weak.\u201cEh, let\u2019s see. \u2026\u2026\u201dAnd Azusa was cowering behind Ryuzaki.A few moments ago, she looked somewhat tense\u2026\u2026 yet determined, and now she looks confused.Since I am her stepbrother, I can tell by the expression on her face what kind of feelings my sister is having.She must have been trying to tell Ryuzaki something important.She called him out to the back of the school building where there was no one around.I think she was trying to confess \u2026\u2026 or something similarly serious.No, you don\u2019t need to be a stepbrother to know this.Being called to the back of the school building is the perfect situation for a confession. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that it\u2019s a common practice.But Ryuzaki doesn\u2019t notice it.He\u2019s a bit dull and unaware of love.\u2026\u2026 Although my sister no longer has any connection with me.I knew it was a shame that her determination was not rewarded, so I couldn\u2019t help but offer her a helping hand.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you two all of a sudden?\u3000Why did you come to the back of the school building, where there is no one around? \u2026\u2026 Were you planning to talk about something important?\u201dNot to Ryuzaki.I looked at Azusa and called out to her.She looks at me with wide eyes.But she quickly looks away. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s pretending to be someone else.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was called away by Azusa. \u2026\u2026 That can wait. Don\u2019t change the subject, explain to me what you were doing with Shiho.\u201dBut Ryuzaki is insensitive in every way.He didn\u2019t seem to be aware of Azusa\u2019s feelings in the slightest.I despised the pure thoughts of that girl.It\u2019s still hard for me as a family member.As an older brother, it is natural for me to hope that Azusa\u2019s feelings will at least be rewarded.\u201cNothing, of course not. Nakayama-san, if you have something to say, why don\u2019t you say it clearly? If I\u2019m in your way, I\u2019ll go away.\u201d\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s still hard for me to call Azusa, Nakayama-san, though.But I promised her that before. She doesn\u2019t want people to know that she\u2019s actually my sister. Because the ideal Onii-chan for her is not me, but Ryuzaki.\u201cOh, uh, \u2026\u2026.\u201dBut Azusa is still a bit shy.She is a quiet girl at heart, so it must have taken a lot of courage for her to decide to confess.I think it was really great that she overcame that and called him.When I thought about Azusa\u2019s feelings, my heart ached.It\u2019s a feeling that won\u2019t be directed at me anymore, but \u2026\u2026 at least, I hope that she will be happy.In the past, I was the \u201d Onii-chan \u201c.However, that thought never seemed to reach Ryuzaki\u2026\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re making a scene. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Azusa. Can you give me a moment alone with him? If you have something to say, I will listen to you later.\u201dIn this way, Ryuzaki dismisses the thoughts of the girl.Due to his insensitivity, he has no malicious intent. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s malicious.Not realizing it is evil.It\u2019s just laziness to not realize that there is so much affection coming from them.This is the reason why I hated Ryuzaki after all.\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019ll see you later, Ryoma Onii-chan.\u201dAnd even as Azusa quietly retreated as she was told, anger boiled over.Is that what she wants?Is that the extent of Azusa\u2019s feelings?She was so excited to tell me that she had found someone he liked, and then she cut me out of her life for the sake of that person. \u2026\u2026 And now she\u2019s retreating?I want to scream.She should have told him clearly how she felt.But I couldn\u2019t say that because I had so many happy memories with Azusa.I never wanted to see her crying face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSo all I could do was look at her in silence.\u2026\u2026 Oh, I see.I used to think of myself as a protagonist, but \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not.I can\u2019t be so selfish as to ignore the feelings of such a pure girl.No, I don\u2019t want to do it. \u2026\u2026 I would rather be a mob character than hurt a nice girl like that with the excuse of being insensitive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m not in a position to be helpful to her anymore.Kotaro Nakayama is no more than Azusa Nakayama\u2019s older brother in the family register.Nothing more, nothing less. I can\u2019t do anything about her love life.So, for now, let\u2019s concentrate on what\u2019s in front of me.I had to get rid of Ryuzaki as soon as possible, so as not to bother Shimotsuki.\u201cWe can talk in peace when we\u2019re alone. Don\u2019t be shy. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time for you to tell me? Tell me why you were alone with Shiho.\u201dIt seems that the protagonist has a strong attachment to his childhood friend.If this was a story, the main heroine is probably Shimotsuki.Those girls I liked so much are subheroines.\u201cYou want to know? I mean, it\u2019s her private life, remember? Are you sure you want to pry into it?\u201dTo be honest, I felt like I was being a little pushy.I felt reluctant to say too much when he questioned me so persistently.Why does he want to know so much about Shimotsuki?He was generous enough to tell me that he had no reason whatsoever to be concerned.\u201cI\u2019m her childhood friend, you know. I have a duty to protect her, because she\u2019s sickly and weak. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m the only one who can help Shiho, because I\u2019m her childhood friend.\u201dIt was like he was talking to himself.I felt a chill when Ryuzaki talked about something so grandiose.(Do you really have to be such a protagonist to feel good?)This arrogant, smug, selfish thought made me angry.Shimotsuki is weak? Is Ryuzaki the only one who can help her?It\u2019s so misguided. She\u2019s not that weak of a girl.She\u2019s a normal girl who can speak her mind and express her feelings clearly.At the very least, I can say with confidence that she is not the kind of person who can\u2019t live properly without the help of others.What can I say? \u2026\u2026 Honestly, I was afraid of Ryuzaki.The protagonist may seem normal, but he\u2019s anything but normal.This guy is insane.If I were to argue with him and get suspicious, and if Shimotsuki were to follow me around \u2026\u2026, I would be horrified.Now, I felt like I finally understood her feelings.I really \u2026\u2026 did not want to have much to do with Ryuzaki, I thought.\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since childhood\u2026\u2026, and it\u2019s my job to protect her from bad boys. Shiho is too kind and timid to express her opinion, but \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll do it for her.\u201dAnd Ryuzaki seems to think I\u2019m a bad boy.\u201cShe likes to be by herself. Don\u2019t make her go out with you for your own reasons. \u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t take advantage of her kindness, okay? As a childhood friend of Shiho\u2019s, I\u2019ll give you some advice.\u201dI wonder if protecting her means to attack her.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to make assumptions about Shimotsuki\u2019s personality and ideology without permission and to exclude others just based on assumptions.How could he do this?No matter how much of a mob character I am, doesn\u2019t he think it\u2019s rude?No, the most rude thing is not towards me.Doesn\u2019t he feel sorry for Shimotsuki?(\u2026\u2026 I bet he doesn\u2019t think that way.)How could Ryuzaki think of such a thing as normal?Because he is the \u201d protagonist \u201c.Everything can and has been forgiven on that basis alone, because he is an opportunistic and extraterritorial being\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that Ryuzaki should be concerned about.\u201dI hesitate and let my thoughts wander.The reason why I am hesitating to give a definite answer is because depending on the answer, I might get in trouble with Shimotsuki.For example, let\u2019s say I told him the whole truth.Suppose Shimotsuki explained that she really didn\u2019t like Ryuzaki and was only having lunch with me because we had become friends.A normal person would back off when they realize that they are disliked.But Ryuzaki is no ordinary person. He is a \u201d protagonist \u201c.\u2018She doesn\u2019t like me? No, Shiho just doesn\u2019t know the real me! If she gets to know the real me, she\u2019ll like me! So let\u2019s try to approach her more!\u2019It\u2019s not surprising that such a thought process was formed.Ryuzaki is that type of protagonist.Usually, he\u2019s slow and indecisive.But when he is determined, he will go straight for it.The protagonist is a creature that gets more motivated the more he or she is pushed.Oh, I\u2019m spiteful.It was one-sided, and the pressure that seemed to be trying to fill in the other person\u2019s thoughts was making it difficult to breathe.I\u2019m sure that Shimotsuki, the target of this pressure, will suffer even more than me.That\u2019s why I can\u2019t tell him the truth. Shimotsuki rejects Ryuzaki like that.She called me a friend even though I was just a plain, ordinary mob character.She saw the value in me and admired me.I\u2019m very happy about that, but on the other hand, I don\u2019t have anything to give back to her, so I actually feel a little guilty.There was nothing I could do to make her happy.At least, I wanted to be careful not to cause her any trouble.\u201cNothing? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re alone with her in a deserted place like this. \u2026\u2026 Are you hiding something about Shiho from me? Is there anything bothering you, that you can\u2019t tell me about?\u201dWhat do I say?What should I say to the protagonist who is so delusional that he can\u2019t see what\u2019s best for himself?\u201cMaybe Shiho\u2019s asking you for advice so she doesn\u2019t bother me? If so, please tell her. \u2026\u2026 We are childhood friends and I don\u2019t care if she bothers me. If you\u2019re not telling me, it\u2019s all right! Just tell me exactly what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ll do the talking!\u201dHow can he think of something so convenient?If I say something badly, it might put a heavy burden on Shimotsuki.Perhaps Ryuzaki is in a hurry.I think he\u2019s also concerned about me in a corner of his mind.Maybe Shiho Shimotsuki\u2019s special someone is me and he\u2019s getting anxious.That\u2019s why he\u2019s searching hard for a reason.He is looking for a convenient reason to convince himself.If that\u2019s the case, then I have to erase it.I need to erase my existence from his mind.As long as I\u2019m not there, Shimotsuki can go back to her normal life.For Ryuzaki, as a childhood friend who is sickly and likes to be alone, she can spend her time without much interference.Yes, that\u2019s right.All I have to do is erase my presence from Ryuzaki\u2019s mind.I\u2019m good at that. It\u2019s a simple thing to do, because the only advantage of being a mob character is that you don\u2019t have much of a presence\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you try to seduce Shiho?\u201d\u201cNo, because she\u2019s so cute. \u2026\u2026 It was hard to say, but yeah. I somehow managed to ask her to have lunch with me. Shimotsuki-san is kind and \u2026\u2026 reluctant, but she ate lunch with me.\u201dAs soon as I said that, Ryuzaki relaxed, as if he was at once relieved.\u201cWhat, that\u2019s what you mean. \u2026\u2026 You were just a challenger.\u201d\u201cHeh. Well, I didn\u2019t make any progress in the end! But since there is such a beautiful girl in my class, I wanted to give it a try. \u2026\u2026 I called her here and tried to hit on her somehow, but then Ryuzaki came. It made Shimotsuki-san go crazy, so she left.\u201dI put a smile on my face.The pain that prickles in my heart is probably due to the fact that I still have some pride left from mistakenly thinking that I was once the protagonist.I don\u2019t need that.I\u2019ll just be a mob character.I don\u2019t mind throwing away anything that disturbs Shimotsuki.\u2013Flirt.\u2013Heckle him.\u2013Wag my tail.Just act like a pathetic high school boy.Be a nameless character that makes Ryuzaki feel like he\u2019s insignificant.\u201cWell, maybe that was a rejection. \u2026\u2026 There\u2019s nothing I can do about it, Shimotsuki-san has a high standard! But I\u2019m not giving up. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll try again, again and again!\u201dI\u2019ll pretend to be foolish.I play the part of a pathetic clown who falls in love with an ungrateful woman.Seeing me like this, Ryuzaki was clearly distracted.\u201cSo \u2026\u2026 you called her here and created a situation where the two of you are alone. I misunderstood, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right, there\u2019s no way Shiho would hide anything from me. \u2026\u2026 We\u2019re childhood friends, so it\u2019s only natural.\u201dThen, he conveniently complimented the setup.This is the arrogance and weakness of the protagonist.I was relieved at first that I was able to deceive him so easily.Then, I decided to set up a strategy so that I would not be bothered by Shimotsuki in the future.\u201cYour childhood friend is strong! But I\u2019m not going to lose either. \u2026\u2026 Someday, I\u2019m going to get along with Shimotsuki-san somehow!\u201dI played the role of a cheerful and stupid boy.This should make Ryuzaki think that I\u2019m just a mob character trying hard to get her attention, even if I\u2019m talking to Shimotsuki in the future.\u201cWatch me! I can do it too if I try!\u201dI must have looked like a hothead. Ryuzaki laughed, clearly dismissive.\u201cHuh. \u2026\u2026 Well, good luck with that. Shiho is a girl with a lot of difficulties, so I think it\u2019s probably impossible. The only person who understands her is me, her childhood friend.\u201dHe seemed to be in a good mood.Ryuzaki smiled refreshingly and held out his hand to me.\u201cI was wrong about you, Nakayama. You\u2019re a pretty funny guy. \u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s be friends from now on.\u201d\u2026\u2026 What was funny about that?Does he think it\u2019s funny that I am a mob character and I\u2019m messing with the main heroine?He thinks me and him are friends?You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dIt didn\u2019t work.No matter how hard I tried to pretend, I couldn\u2019t.No matter how much I fool myself, no matter how foolish I play myself, \u2026\u2026 there is one feeling I can\u2019t lie about, no matter how hard I try.\u2013I hate you, Ryuzaki.Of course, I\u2019m not going to say that I hate him from the bottom of my heart.I immediately smiled fondly at him, since saying that much would defeat the purpose of eliminating my presence as a mob character.\u201cBecause you\u2019re my biggest rival! If I take advantage of my position as Ryuzaki\u2019s friend, I\u2019ll never be able to get along with Shimotsuki-san. I know I can\u2019t win, but let me try!\u201dI gave him a good reason.Then Ryuzaki, who looked puzzled for a moment, seemed to be relieved.\u201cI was surprised when you suddenly glared at me. \u2026\u2026 If that\u2019s the case, I guess I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m not going to be your friend, but I\u2019ll be glad to work with you from now on!\u201dRyuzaki said nodding his head. He probably recognized that I was just a small fish.I think I\u2019ve succeeded in fooling him somehow.Now Ryuzaki will not get involved with Shimotsuki.\u201cSo, I\u2019m going back to class. And Nakayama, make sure you\u2019re not late, okay?\u201dWith those words, Ryuzaki finally left.After making sure that he was gone, I slowly exhaled.\u201cPhew. \u2026\u2026\u201dI sat down and clenched my fists as I collapsed on the spot.\u201cHuh!\u201dI slammed into the ground and let my anger out.\u201c\u2026\u2026 That hurt.\u201dI looked at my bloodied fist and regained some composure.I flattered him. I humbled myself to the main character. It was still frustrating, but \u2026\u2026, well, it\u2019s okay.\u201cI am a mob character. I don\u2019t need to feel emotions.\u201dI muttered sarcastically and forced myself to laugh.I don\u2019t need to look in the mirror to know, I\u2019m sure the smile I\u2019m wearing right now is so distorted, it\u2019s unbearable to look at.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just after lunch and I was motivated to sleep, so the string of numbers on the blackboard did not enter my mind at all.(The title might be \u2026\u2026, I guess. \u201cHe\u2019s a Harem Protagonist, but he only loves his silent Childhood Friend\u2026\u201d?)It\u2019s a terrible title. I can\u2019t help but chuckle at my lack of imagination.But if I were to summarize the truth, it would be something like that.The story is about a harem protagonist, Ryuzaki, who is tempted by all kinds of girls, but loves only his \u2026\u2026 childhood friend with all his heart.His childhood friend, who is sickly, quiet, and loves to be alone, doesn\u2019t even open up to Ryuzaki at first, but they gradually become friends. \u2026\u2026 Eventually, he confesses, \u201cI love you more than any other girl!\u201d.

She seems to be the main heroine, unfortunately.Even the other harem members are probably just sub-characters to him.(\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s so unrewarding.)Even those girls that I loved can only stand in the corner of the story? If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m really sad that I was cut off.They are not even sub-characters, but mob characters, I guess that\u2019s more appropriate.It\u2019s no wonder, since mobs don\u2019t have any human rights. \u2026\u2026 Or maybe they don\u2019t care about me now.A mob character who thought he was the protagonist is nothing but a pathetic clown. It\u2019s not right to try to reward someone for being so miserable that it\u2019s difficult to even laugh at them.But I do have a wish, at least for \u2026\u2026 one thing.(Please, \u2026\u2026 let just one person be happy.)The least I could pray for was that their efforts as subheroines would be rewarded, even if only a little.It is not uncommon for a subheroine to surpass the main heroine in a story.It doesn\u2019t matter what the reason is, whether it\u2019s because they became popular, the author liked them or the story flowed the way it had to \u2026\u2026.My stepsister Azusa, my childhood friend Yuzuki, and my best friend Kirari \u2026\u2026, at least one of them, should be rewarded.There are not only three harem members, and there are many others, but \u2026\u2026 no, the number is constantly increasing and the protagonist is an outrageous womanizer, making every girl he meets fall in love with him, one after another, so the competition will be high.He is such a ridiculous hero that even within the sub-heroines, there are fierce fights. As a mob character \u2026\u2026, no, as a normal human being, I don\u2019t understand why anyone would fall in love with a guy like that.Isn\u2019t it strange to keep thinking about something when there is little chance of it being rewarded? They can\u2019t be so blinded by love that they can\u2019t help it if they fall in love.But maybe that\u2019s normal for these girls \u2026\u2026.That\u2019s how much they fell in love with someone. Compared to them, I\u2019ve probably only ever had casual love, so maybe I don\u2019t understand it.Even though they know they will be unhappy, they can\u2019t help but fall in love. If that\u2019s the case, I want them to do their best.I want them to win happiness with their own hands.That was the best I can do as a mob character\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Studying was something I could manage if I crammed all night before the test. Thanks to this, I got a slightly lower than average grade, which is a result that is indescribably mob-like, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t change who I am.Now, it\u2019s after school.Yesterday, I became friends with Shimotsuki after school\u2026\u2026. Just because we\u2019re friends doesn\u2019t mean we have to stay together after school.Besides, I now have Ryuzaki\u2019s eyes on me.After lunch, he seemed to be at least relieved by my statement, but he kept his guard up and kept glancing at me to see what I was up to.Fortunately, the shy Shimotsuki didn\u2019t talk to me, so I think my suspicions were probably confirmed\u2026\u2026. If I stay too close to her, I might get Shimotsuki in trouble.I decided to leave as soon as I could.In fact, I wanted to say a few words to Shimotsuki, but Ryuzaki was flirting with his harem members and wouldn\u2019t leave the classroom, so I had no choice but to leave in silence.If we were friends, this would be about as good as it gets.If I\u2019m not careful, Shimotsuki will quickly close the distance between us, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t touch her. I have to be docile like a mob and not get carried away.I told myself that and headed home.I boarded a bus at the nearest bus stop and arrived near my house in about 20 minutes. I got off the bus and walked for another few minutes. When I finally reached home, I turned over to get my keys out of my bag\u2026\u2026. That\u2019s when it happened.\u201cWho is it? The clue is your friend, a girl. Hmmm, can you guess? You want more clues? I don\u2019t blame you, my favorite food is the food my mom makes. Yeah, if I give you this many hints, you\u2019ll figure it out, right?\u201dFrom behind me, small hands cover my eyes.The darkness confused me for a moment, but I was relieved when I heard the voice and immediately knew who it was.\u201cWhat is it, Shimotsuki\u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki!\u201dHowever, my relief was short-lived.Immediately I realized that this situation was unusual.\u201cI\u2019m Shiho Shimotsuki, a 16-year-old girl. I\u2019ve always dreamed of being able to say this. It\u2019s one of the top 100 things on my list of things I want to do when I have a friend. I\u2019m glad my dream came true.\u201dI wondered if the top 100 could really be this special.Maybe there are quite a few items on the \u201clist of things I want to do when I make friends\u201d \u2026\u2026 I was also curious about that, but I guess I need to ask something first.\u201cWhy are you here \u2026\u2026?\u201dThis place, of course, is not at school.It\u2019s my house, 20 minutes away by bus and almost an hour away by foot.I couldn\u2019t understand why Shimotsuki, a character I was supposed to encounter only at school, was in such a place.Why would she be here?When I asked her the reason, the light suddenly disappeared from her eyes.Her black eyes, in contrast to her silvery-white hair, were filled with a darkness that seemed to absorb all colors.\u201cEh? You\u2019re my friend, but you left without saying goodbye. \u2026\u2026 There were many things I wanted to do after school, but you left on your own, so I followed you. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re my friend or not. I\u2019m going to make myself at home with Nakayama-kun to get back at you. I\u2019m not going to let you turn me down.\u201d\u2026\u2026 Until a few days ago, I thought she was like an emotionless doll.This girl was quite talkative and emotional.Shimotsuki: \u2026\u2026 Sorry. I\u2019m sorry to feel this way about my friend. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s just a little hectic. The silent girl seems to have a bit of a yandere side\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no sign of her, which was a little scary.\u201cSo, may I come in? Oh, are your parents here? I\u2019d like to say hello to them. I\u2019m not \u2026\u2026 shy when it comes to people around my parent\u2019s age! I\u2019m a little nervous in front of people, but I can talk to people around my mom and dad\u2019s age just fine, you know?\u201dShe said she\u2019s shy.Anyway, she seems to be polite. The way she speaks, her gestures and her attitude all have a certain elegance to them. \u2026\u2026 Her parents seem to have taken good care of her and she probably had a good upbringing.The more I learn about Shiho Shimotsuki, the more attractive she becomes.It\u2019s rare to find a person with such deep feelings.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. My parents are both on a business trip overseas.\u201dWell, they\u2019re not here, so there\u2019s no need to worry about it.I unlocked the door and invited her in.\u201cWell, that\u2019s \u2026\u2026 very disappointing. I would have loved to have seen Nakayama\u2019s mom and dad. I would have liked to have seen your childhood albums and talked with you about the past.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d enjoy looking at my albums, \u2026\u2026 and please don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201dIt\u2019s as strange as ever.It\u2019s really boring to look at my albums as a mob character.But Shimotsuki is very curious.She\u2019s itching to know more about me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you. Hmm, I see. \u2026\u2026 You were born and raised here, weren\u2019t you? It\u2019s a little bit bigger than our house. But it\u2019s nice to have a house this big where you can see your family.\u201dShimotsuki looked around the house, looking curious.Really, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to see since it\u2019s just a typical house.Anyway, I welcomed her to the living room instead of my room. As for me, I thought I\u2019d just serve her some tea and sweets and chat with her over some random food. \u2026\u2026 But it looks like that was a failure.\u201cHuh? Why don\u2019t you take me to your room, Nakayama-kun? I\u2019m your friend. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s a common practice to invite friends, who come to visit you to your room. Do you know anything about the world, Nakayama-kun? You\u2019re a strange person.\u201dShe looked at me with a puzzled look on her face, like she was speaking common sense.No, that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not common sense to force your way into the home of a person of the opposite sex on the second day after becoming friends and moreover, it\u2019s a mystery why she wants to go to my room. I think it\u2019s better to be more \u2026\u2026 cautious.Shimotsuki has a rather defenseless side to her. I don\u2019t know why she trusts me so much, when she is usually so cautious and gets nervous at the mere presence of others.Yeah, that\u2019s right.What\u2019s even stranger is the fact that she\u2019s so curious about me.I wonder if it\u2019s because it\u2019s always been in the corner of my mind.Since it was a good opportunity, I couldn\u2019t help but ask her.\u201cMy room is really not that interesting, you know. I mean, I\u2019m a boring person myself. \u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little weird that you want to know about this mob character?\u201dShimotsuki\u2019s mouth widened at my words.Her face was like that of an annoying person who talks about the universe while inviting people to join a mysterious religion.\u201cMob characters? Nakayama-kun? What do you mean? I don\u2019t know what you mean. \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a mob character. I\u2019ve never found you boring or dull. It\u2019s a strange thing to say. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve shown so many signs of affection and yet Nakayama still doesn\u2019t get it.\u201dThen she sighed and smiled.With an adorable smile that seemed to make everyone who saw her happy, Shimotsuki said this.\u201cYou\u2019re special to me. Don\u2019t be sad about being a mob character. It\u2019s not bad to be humble, but you shouldn\u2019t be so humble. Don\u2019t be sad about denying who you are. \u2026\u2026 It hurts me, your friend.\u201d\u2013That was the first time I had heard that.He acknowledged me as one of the many others and said that I was \u201cspecial\u201d.Rather than being happy, I think it would be more accurate to say that I was \u2026\u2026 surprised.So, to this girl, I was special.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And how can I not be special when I\u2019m her only friend \u2026\u2026?\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking for a while that you\u2019re too insecure about yourself. \u2026\u2026 You\u2019re always so scared and reserved with me, aren\u2019t you? You are my friend, so you should be more relaxed. It makes me a little sad.\u201dShimotsuki looked unusually dissatisfied.Her eyes are wide and her cheeks are puffed out.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to be cute even in these situations.\u201cSorry, sorry \u2026\u2026.\u201dI can\u2019t argue with her. I can barely manage to apologize.The reason was that Shimotsuki was so cute that I couldn\u2019t help but admire her.Oh, I see. \u2026\u2026 I understand why the protagonist loves this girl so much that he goes crazy.She is just too cute.It\u2019s not just the face. No, of course, I think her face is top-notch.What\u2019s more, this girl has an attractive personality. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s been loved and raised, or maybe it\u2019s because she has a very soft atmosphere. \u2026\u2026 I feel very comfortable being next to her.I\u2019ve never seen a girl like her before.I can say with confidence that she is a unique person.I\u2019m sure the main character understands this. He may be cold, but I\u2019m sure Ryuzaki has instinctively smelled Shimotsuki\u2019s charm.The main character\u2019s eyes must be of good quality.I thought that because I had been involved with so many girls, I was even more aware of Shimotsuki\u2019s charms.\u201cI have a little bit of what is commonly referred to as \u201cshyness\u201d. Just a little, really. You see, in my previous life, I was a territorial little animal, and I get nervous when other people look at me, you know?\u201dShimotsuki continues to talk.The talkative girl continued to sing in her lovely voice until I stopped her.The words were directed only at me, a special person. \u2026\u2026 Now, I just wanted to listen to them.The main heroine\u2019s consciousness could be monopolized by me, a mob character, for now.I was very happy about that.\u201cBut the strange thing is that Nakayama-kun is the only one who doesn\u2019t get nervous. \u2026\u2026 I wondered that from the first time I saw you. No, not when I saw you, but when I heard you. I have a good hearing. \u2026\u2026 The sounds that ooze out of you are so interesting that I get carried away.\u201dAs usual, Shimotsuki talks about things with a unique worldview.It was difficult to understand everything she said. But I tried my best to understand what she said.\u201cSo, now that we\u2019ve become friends, I want to know more and more about you, Nakayama. The more I get to know you, the more the tone changes. \u2026\u2026 Every time I talk to you, touch you, or smile at you, the tone echoes. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Tone?\u201d\u201cYeah, tone. It\u2019s like a musical instrument. You can\u2019t make a sound by yourself, but if you have a player, you can make beautiful music, right? It\u2019s almost like that. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m your musician. Right now, anyway, I\u2019m trying to figure out what you sound like.\u201dThen she pecked me on the cheek.She smiles innocently, as if she were a child playing a prank.\u201cI want to touch you more. I want to talk to you more. I want to know more about you and get to know you better. \u2026\u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m your friend. You are the only one who is special to me. You have to understand that, right?\u201d\u2026\u2026 I see. That\u2019s the reason for her closeness to me.It\u2019s hard to believe, but \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki seems to have a strong interest in me.To be honest, I didn\u2019t understand half of what she said. Especially the part about the \u201ctone\u201d, there were few parts that I could relate to, and it almost confused me.But I guess I didn\u2019t need to worry about that.Anyway, Shimotsuki thinks of me as \u2018special\u2019.\u201cYeah.

So when she asked to see my room, I couldn\u2019t refuse.She really seemed to be looking forward to seeing my room, and her steps were light and fluffy. She looked as if she was almost dancing.\u201cEtiquette? I don\u2019t know. \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t watch a lot of anime.\u201d\u201cEh? Nakayama-kun, are you insane?

That was just a joke. If it were possible, I would have liked Nakayama-kun to make a comeback saying, `I\u2019m not dead yet,\u2019 but I\u2019ll give you a pass. I also like comedy shows, so I know a lot about them.\u201dThis girl has quite a lot of interests.And she is the type of person who mistakenly thinks she is an expert in a field just because she has heard about it.Yeah, \u2026\u2026 Well, it wasn\u2019t very interesting, whether it was the comedy or the jokes. Shimotsuki is pretty clumsy, so the quality of everything she does is surprisingly low.And so, we arrive at my room.The reason why we\u2019ve been talking so idly is because I\u2019ve been slowing down.I was hoping that maybe Shimotsuki would change her mind, but she was still determined to get into my room.\u201cSo this is it, huh? Okay, I\u2019m coming in! Now, I\u2019ll give you the answer \u2026\u2026 The first thing you should do when you first go to a boy\u2019s room is to look for a naughty book! I\u2019ve been wanting to try this since it\u2019s a standard anime rule!\u201dShimotsuki enters the room with great enthusiasm.Perhaps she\u2019s getting excited, but her voice has been loud since a while ago.Since we were in a situation where it was just the two of us, of course her shyness was not triggered.Maybe it was because she was so shy, but now she was also loud.\u201cNow, where could it be! Under the bed? Or in the back of a drawer? Maybe in a closet? I saw a movie about a treasure hunter the other day, so I\u2019m probably pretty good at treasure hunting. There\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t find!\u201dWith that, Shimotsuki starts rummaging through my room.I watched her absentmindedly.Normally, I might be in a panic, but \u2026\u2026 unfortunately, no such interesting events happen to me.Because I don\u2019t have any hobbies.In the first place, I don\u2019t like anything.The truth is that I don\u2019t really know much about naughty books either.Perhaps it is the nature of a sad mob character, but \u2026\u2026 I have no personality.It\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a set of principles or assertions that can be called a personality\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s a bit meta, but that\u2019s how it is.So, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint her, but \u2026\u2026 no matter how hard she looked, there was nothing interesting in this room.\u201cUm, Shimotsuki? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have any naughty books, okay?\u201dSorry, but I\u2019ll make sure to let her know.\u201cI don\u2019t have any hobbies or preferences, so I don\u2019t \u2026\u2026 have any of those tastes or entertainment items.\u201dAs I said this, I felt a little ashamed of myself.I can\u2019t even be normal, I\u2019m just a mob character, I thought.Looking at this room from a bird\u2019s eye view, I can clearly see that I have no personality.The only furniture in the room is a bed, a study desk, a closet, and a shelf.The room was equipped with a set of study tools, a change of clothes, bedding, a few things for later use, and no entertainment items.I don\u2019t think a plain room is an appropriate place for Shimotsuki to be.Somehow, I wanted to leave the room. I felt that it was not appropriate for a nice girl like Shimotsuki to be in such a place.However, Shimotsuki laughed at me for being so sneaky.\u201cMmm, I see. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I cannot make any promises. I was looking forward to it, but it can\u2019t be helped. Nakayama-kun is a very strange boy, not having any hobbies. I\u2019m getting more and more curious and excited.\u201dIn front of me, Shimotsuki never lets her expression fade.She affirmed the parts of me that I thought were bad, as if they were part of my charm.She was like an angel.\u201cThen I\u2019ll teach you lots of \u2018fun\u2019. I\u2019ll be your hobby teacher\u2026\u2026. Wow, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ve been playing by myself for so long that I\u2019m starving for a friend to play with, and I think it\u2019s a win-win for both of us!\u201dTeaching your hobbies \u2026\u2026, doesn\u2019t that mean you just want to play together?For a moment, I thought so, but I was very grateful for the offer.I wondered if even a colorless mob character like me could be colored.If I, a mob character, could have a personality, \u2026\u2026 I thought, that would be a very, very good thing.If I could establish my own existence and stand on the stage of the story in a position where I am not a mob character.Maybe then I\u2019ll be able to look at \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki in a much different light.To be honest, I\u2019m afraid to be in the position of being her friend right now.I wish I could be brave enough to say \u201cI like you\u201d to her more as an equal, for example\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let me play here.\u201dShe was saying a lot of things, but it looked like she just wanted to play games with a friend.\u201cI\u2019m your hobby teacher, Nakayama-kun. It\u2019s nothing personal, you know. It\u2019s just that my gaming time is set at one hour at home, so it\u2019s not too hard to sneak out at night and play games under the covers, you know?\u201dI was surprised that there was a kid in high school who was still doing such elementary school stuff.From what I\u2019ve heard, Shimotsuki\u2019s parents really love their daughter, but they are a little \u2026\u2026 overprotective. The deadline is 6 p.m., and she\u2019s only allowed to play games for an hour.But it\u2019s not as bad as the abandonment of my family.My father and mother both do their job as parents, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that they don\u2019t care about their children, but in terms of the level of love they show, I think it\u2019s a little low compared to other parents.Even now, they travel abroad without their children.It is still better to be loved than not to be loved. Shimotsuki also seems to love her parents, but even with that \u2026\u2026, I think she needs a little change of pace.I thought it would not be a bad idea to let her use this house for that purpose.It would be the least I could do to repay Shimotsuki for her kindness.\u201cPlease feel free to use this house. It\u2019s an ordinary house, though.\u201dShimotsuki nodded, and her expression brightened.I felt embarrassed when she looked at me with such a happy expression.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here? No, I have Nakayama-kun in this house. I\u2019m very happy with that. You can\u2019t play a console game in the room because you have to connect it to a screen, right? I\u2019ll bring one tomorrow.\u201dThere is something about me, or \u2026\u2026 something that makes me feel so special, she\u2019s a strange girl after all.It was during one of these conversations.\u201c\u2026\u2026? Hmm? Hmmm?\u201dSuddenly, Shimotsuki\u2019s ears twitched.Then she suddenly looked unhappy and turned her gaze on me.\u201cNakayama-kun is \u2026\u2026 the type of person who can attract girls, isn\u2019t he?\u201dThe words, unusually separated by a single line, were nonsensical.At first, I was confused because I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying\u2026\u2026, and then I heard the sound of the front door opening.\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201dA quiet voice echoed through the house.It seems that my stepsister, Azusa, has come home.That\u2019s unusual. \u2026\u2026 Didn\u2019t she go to Ryuzaki\u2019s house today?And hearing her voice, Shimotsuki looked like she was going to cry a little.\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re bringing a girl into your home instead of me, your friend. \u2026\u2026 This is what you call cheating, right? Nakayama-kun\u2019s naughty! You\u2019re a fool if you have me in your life and you\u2019re messing around with other girls.\u201dThen, after hearing what she just said, I finally realized why Shimotsuki was in a bad mood.She has good hearing, so she must have heard Azusa\u2019s footsteps outside. And probably sensed that the girl was coming to the house. Then Shimotsuki, who is a bit possessive, probably means that \u2026\u2026 the flame of jealousy was kindled.In other words, this is \u2026\u2026\u201cYa, jealous?\u201dI ask, fearfully.She then puffed up her cheeks in an obvious way.Her cheeks looked like mochi.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m jealous. I\u2019m so jealous, I\u2019m turning into a mochi.\u201dEven if you say so, I\u2019m a little confused\u2026\u2026.Because the one who just came back to this house is my family.She\u2019s my stepsister, even though we\u2019re not related by blood, so I wanted to give her a pass for counting her as the opposite sex\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because next to my room on the second floor, there is a room with a name plate hung with the name \u201cAzusa\u201d, and the laundry on the balcony that can be seen from the living room window belongs to Azusa. If she wasn\u2019t so clueless, I\u2019m sure she would have realized that there were other family members.Could it be that Shimotsuki didn\u2019t see anything other than me? Is it possible that she was so infatuated with me that she couldn\u2019t see \u2026\u2026? I\u2019m a mob character, but I\u2019m being extremely arrogant.Well, Shimotsuki is a pretty clumsy person, so it\u2019s not surprising that she didn\u2019t notice.I\u2019ll be careful not to make too many strange mistakes.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Huh? Is there a visitor here?\u201dOn the other hand, when Azusa came back, she seemed to have sensed that there was a visitor when she saw Shimotsuki\u2019s shoes at the entrance. She came straight to the living room and appeared.A girl with a childish face and twin-tails of black hair appears.And as soon as Azusa and Shimotsuki recognized each other, their eyes widened.\u201cEh? Why are you here, Shimotsuki-san?\u201dAzusa\u2019s question was natural.It\u2019s not surprising that she would be surprised to find Shimotsuki, who is only supposed to be at school, at her house.\u201cNa, na, na \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-kun, aaah!\u201dThen again, Azusa\u2019s appearance must have been unexpected for Shimotsuki as well.The unexpected appearance of a person from her own class, a classmate in fact, triggered her shyness to a spectacular degree.She instantly became nervous and chewed on her words. Still, she seemed to have something to say, so she put her face close to my ear and whispered to me.\u201cWow, you cheated on me with a girl whose breasts are only slightly larger than mine? I wish you would have at least cheated on me with a girl with bigger breasts. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s true that I\u2019m smaller than her, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much difference. Besides, it\u2019s not my fault that I\u2019m tiny, it\u2019s my mom and dad\u2019s genes, and that\u2019s terrible.\u201dNo, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re upset about. \u2026\u2026 If I kept up with Shimotsuki\u2019s pace, I wouldn\u2019t be able to clear up the misunderstanding any time soon, so I forced myself to start the conversation.\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you. Azusa is my stepsister. \u2026\u2026 See, we have the same last name, right? That\u2019s because we\u2019re actually brother and sister. Well, we\u2019re the same age and I just have an earlier birthday than her\u2026\u201dI told this to Shimotsuki first, and then turned my attention to Azusa. She was looking at me and Shimotsuki alternately with a curious look on her face.\u201cBrother, \u2026\u2026 what does this mean?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m actually friends with Shimotsuki, so I invited her over to \u2026\u2026 our house? Yeah, anyway, she came over and we had a chat. I\u2019m sorry for startling you.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say that she was not invited, or that she was stalking me, so I\u2019ll be vague.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026, I didn\u2019t know that. It\u2019s kind of surprising.\u201dAzusa was puzzled. Yes, I know how you feel. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s surprising that a person like me has a friendship with Shimotsuki.Well, it\u2019s a little late for that. It was no use thinking about it too much.Besides, the explanation probably cleared up Shimotsuki\u2019s misunderstanding.\u201cWe\u2019re siblings, so it\u2019s not cheating or anything. Do you understand?\u201dThis time, I spoke into Shimotsuki\u2019s ear and told her clearly.No, there is no such thing as cheating in a friendship, but just to be sure, I told her.But Shimotsuki looked unconvinced.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re stepsiblings. \u2026\u2026 Ugh, it\u2019s the standard heroine in anime. How can you not fall in love with a girl who\u2019s been under the same roof with you for so long? I\u2019ve been a loser since the beginning. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s so hard. I\u2019d like to kill Nakayama-kun and make him mine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201dI don\u2019t want you to kill me, please.No, it\u2019s probably a joke. I really wanted it to be a joke.\u201cWhat can I say? \u2026\u2026 Maybe you\u2019re wrong, but we\u2019re really just brother and sister, okay? I\u2019m not in love with her, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing to say something like this.But if Shimotsuki didn\u2019t seem to cheer up unless I said this, I managed to squeeze out a sound.\u201cThe only friend I have is Shimotsuki, so \u2026\u2026 Azusa is just my sister.\u201dReally, Azusa is nothing more than a little sister.It\u2019s not more or less than that.To Azusa, I am nothing more than her brother.Moreover, there is a clear rule that it\u2019s \u2018only inside the house\u2019.If we step out of the house, we will only be brother and sister in the family register.Since we made that promise, I don\u2019t think our relationship will progress any further.There may have been a time when we cared for each other a little more\u2026\u2026, but we no longer have that kind of relationship.\u201cHo, really?\u3000Your stepsister doesn\u2019t like you! This is what reality is all about. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m surprised. I\u2019ve never heard of it before. Yeah, I see. \u2026\u2026 If that\u2019s the case, I haven\u2019t lost yet. I\u2019m glad.\u201dAnd as soon as Shimotsuki realized her mistake, she looked very happy.I had a little trouble reacting to such a blatant show of favoritism.Could it be that \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki is looking at me as a romantic interest?Is that why she gets jealous when I get along with other girls?Shimotsuki is so thoughtful that I almost misunderstood something like that.I wish she\u2019d pay a little more attention to the mobs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was restless and fidgety like a borrowed cat.Her shyness seems to have kicked in.I guess she became uncomfortable. She seemed to have decided to leave as soon as possible.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. \u2026\u2026 Bye-bye, Nakayama-kun. Thank you for today, it was fun. Oh, but you can\u2019t flirt with other girls just because I\u2019m going to be gone, okay? Promise!\u201dWith these words in my ear, she leaves the scene.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Eh!\u201dBut she didn\u2019t feel comfortable walking past Azusa in silence. Her face turned red, but she bowed to Azusa.\u201cAh, yeah. Thank you. \u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Azusa also bowed lightly, Shimotsuki smiled awkwardly and then ran to the door.Only Azusa and I remained behind.It was a rare occasion when my stepsister came home, and she was gazing towards the doorway as if she was following the back of Shimotsuki.\u201c\u2026 I think this is the first time I\u2019ve seen Shimotsuki-san with a face like that.\u201dI think Azusa must have a strong impression that Shimotsuki is quiet.I\u2019ve always thought of her as an expressionless, icy girl, but when she shows me her blushing, impatient face, it\u2019s understandable that I\u2019m confused.\u201cI\u2019ve never really been involved with her because she doesn\u2019t talk to me all the time and Ryoma said that Shiho prefers to be alone. \u2026\u2026 Older brother, you are close with her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u2026 I guess so.\u201dI scratched my cheek and said a few words back to my stepsister.To be honest, I wasn\u2019t as comfortable as Shimotsuki, but I was uncomfortable too. Thanks to this, I couldn\u2019t even sit down on the sofa and just stood there.It was the first time we had talked as brother and sister in several days.We promised each other before that we would be \u201cstrangers\u201d outside the house.\u00a0After the high school entrance ceremony, right after Azusa met Ryuzaki,\u2026\u2026 she made up her mind to \u201clove Ryuzaki single-mindedly\u201d and parted ways with me.She thought that if she had a relationship with another man, she would never be able to catch up with the distant Ryuzaki.[\u201cThe ideal Onii-chan that Azusa was looking for is probably not Onii-chan. I think Ryoma-san is the real Onii-chan for Azusa.\u201d]It\u2019s only been about two months since she said that.It feels like a lot of time has passed since then.Since then, we promised to act as brother and sister only inside our house.The relationship between Azusa and I has become so weak that she asked me to call her \u201cNakayama-san\u201d as if we were strangers outside the house.But then again, Azusa might have been a little uncomfortable with the idea. \u2026\u2026 She started to hate seeing me and started to stay at Ryuzaki\u2019s house.It seems that she stays over almost every day and is spoiled by her favorite \u201cRyoma Onii-chan\u201d.So I didn\u2019t expect her to come home today.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It\u2019s unusual for you to come home.\u201dCould it be that she\u2019s not feeling well?If that\u2019s the case, I was worried that she should be resting \u2026\u2026, but apparently that\u2019s not the reason.\u201cI\u2019m fine \u2026\u2026, but I just wasn\u2019t in the mood today. That\u2019s why I came home. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, did I disturb you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 No, this is Azusa\u2019s house too, so don\u2019t hesitate.\u201dYou don\u2019t need to worry about it.I\u2019m just a fake who couldn\u2019t be your ideal \u201cOnii-chan\u201d, but I\u2019m still a part of the family\u2026\u201cIf you ever have a hard time, please let me know. If there\u2019s anything I can do to help, I\u2019ll lend a hand.\u201dThe person I once loved is now far away.And now she\u2019s falling in love with someone who isn\u2019t me, and she\u2019s going to devote her life to that person.I\u2019ll never be able to make her happy again.I can only act as an older brother within the confines of our home\u2026\u2026, but at least inside the house, I want her to spend her time as a younger sister without being bossy.But I guess Azusa herself doesn\u2019t want that.She shook her head slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t deserve to be spoiled by you anymore. \u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve always been so nice to me.\u201dShe seems to have made up her mind a long time ago.It seems that she has made up her mind to cut off all other men except Ryuzaki and give her all to him.\u2026\u2026 Oh, I can\u2019t look at her.I can\u2019t even look at her directly because she is my sister.How painful it is.It\u2019s really a sad feeling to watch.

When I look at them, I feel so painful that it makes my heart ache.They express their feelings of love in such a straightforward way, but the person in question is completely oblivious to it, using \u201cinsensitivity\u201d as an excuse, and their feelings are always in vain.It\u2019s \u2026\u2026 really, really pitiful that her love is trampled on, her efforts don\u2019t produce results, and yet she continues to be devoted to him.It\u2019s as if they only exist to satisfy the protagonist\u2019s need for approval.I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201c\u2026\u2026 By the way, you were about to confess your love today behind the school building. The timing wasn\u2019t right, though.\u201dI have one thing in mind for why Azusa suddenly came home today. When I was eating lunch with Shimotsuki during lunch break, \u2026\u2026 Azusa had called Ryuzaki to the back of the school building.And at that time, Azusa was trying to confess her feelings\u2026\u2026, I assume.\u201cYeah \u2026 I was trying to be brave and tell him how I feel about him\u2026\u2026, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to have the energy to be brave anymore.She smiled fondly with a sad expression.In the end, Azusa was not able to confess her feelings \u2026\u2026 because she encountered us at the wrong time.And unfortunately, it was Shimotsuki, whom Ryuzaki was most obsessed with, that he encountered. So Azusa\u2019s courage was trampled upon and put on the back burner.She seemed to be severely depressed by it.\u201cSo, is it possible that the person who was with you at that time was Shimotsuki-san? \u2026\u2026 I was dying of nervousness, so I didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201dAfter all this time, she seems to have remembered that Shimotsuki was there.She was that nervous.\u201cRyoma Oni-chan, when it comes to Shimotsuki-san, he can\u2019t see anything else\u2026\u2026. Haha, I knew I couldn\u2019t win.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Haha, you can\u2019t.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but curse at her.I almost shouted at my sister, because she was so painful to me.There is no value in unrequited love.It\u2019s not like Azusa\u2019s love is even a lost love. He\u2019s not even aware of her feelings, she\u2019s just being trampled on.It\u2019s not a beautiful story. It\u2019s just painful.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What? What did you say? Your voice is too quiet, I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201dAzusa says she didn\u2019t hear.But her face looked so sad that I couldn\u2019t \u2026\u2026 watch it.\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, so don\u2019t say anything.\u201dI don\u2019t say it out loud, but I think she knows it.I don\u2019t have to say it, but she knows it. She knows that this is not a problem that can be solved with a friendly smile, and she is still trying to cover it up.So she pretends not to hear me.She takes my words and tries her best to hide her pathetic self.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dOh, no.With that look on her face, I couldn\u2019t say anything.I\u2019m not in a position to lecture her anymore.I am not someone who is close enough to Azusa to interfere in her life.This is the path that Azusa has chosen.No matter how unhappy she was, no matter how much she was hurt, she wanted it all, so I couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dSo I played it off.As a mob character, I replied nonchalantly as an emotionless doll.I can only do so much \u2026\u2026 as a mob\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My voice was dying due to the fact that I usually don\u2019t talk at all.I was going to finish the conversation and go to my room to rest.\u201cBut I\u2019m surprised that you and Shimotsuki-san are such good friends. \u2026\u2026 I wonder if Ryoma Onii-chan knows about this.\u201dWhen Azusa suddenly said that, I couldn\u2019t help but widen my eyes.Bad \u2026 Yes, it might have been a bad idea for Azusa to know about my involvement with Shimotsuki.Because Azusa likes Ryuzaki. But Ryuzaki likes Shimotsuki. \u2026\u2026 In other words, Shimotsuki is a love rival for Azusa.The fact that the girl is on good terms with everyone except Ryuzaki means that Azusa and the other subheroines will be the ones to benefit.Although Ryuzaki\u2019s feelings will not be rewarded, there will be a battle for the vacant position of the main heroine.However, in the current situation where Shimotsuki is not attached to anyone, the truce is such that it is impossible to even start a war.For the sub-heroines to be rewarded, Shimotsuki is an obstacle in their way.Therefore, it is not surprising that the girls want to eliminate the absolute main heroine, Shimotsuki.In fact, it is more natural for them to want her to disappear.For example, Azusa may be hoping that if she gets together with a guy other than Ryuzaki\u2026\u2026.(That was a rather bad move, since that\u2019s not \u2026\u2026 the kind of protagonist who becomes more fiery the more adversities he faces.)However, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t go the way the subheroine wants.In fact, I think the absolute stronghold of Shimotsuki will become stronger.Ryoma Ryuzaki is the protagonist.When he is cornered and has no other choice, that is when he shows his true strength.I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll start a fierce attack on Shimotsuki. He will not pay attention to the other sub-heroines, and will become passionate about developing a straightforward romantic comedy.From a meta point of view, I think that\u2019s probably what will happen.And when that happens, the person who will be the most unhappy \u2026\u2026 is Shimotsuki.I would never allow someone I hated to follow her around just because she became friends with me.So I got impatient.\u201cAzusa, wait a minute!\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but grab Azusa\u2019s shoulder. It was the first time in a long time that I had touched my stepsister\u2019s shoulder, and it was so small and slender that I felt like it might break if I put a little pressure on it.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with \u2026\u2026? You suddenly \u2026\u2026 startled me.\u201dI\u2019m sorry for startling you, but I\u2019ll apologize later.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t tell Ryuzaki about \u2026\u2026 me and Shimotsuki, okay?\u201dI desperately begged her.I know I look pathetic, but I have to stop this, even if I have to beg.\u201cI know it\u2019s not convenient for Azusa. \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki is your love rival, and I understand that it\u2019s more beneficial for her to get together with a guy who isn\u2019t Ryuzaki. But please, \u2026\u2026 please don\u2019t tell Ryuzaki. I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help you.\u201dI was so desperate that I thought about getting down on my knees.Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m in a hurry, but my speech is pretty messed up. It came out of nowhere, and Azusa still seemed surprised, her eyes rounded.I continued with my words to her.\u201cShimotsuki shouldn\u2019t get involved with Ryuzaki. \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t want to hurt that girl, please. I know I\u2019m asking Azusa to take a loss\u2026\u2026. Still, please, please.\u201dI begged her to let us go.In the end, I lowered my posture to get down on my knees,\u2026\u2026but Azusa stopped me from doing so.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you get emotional before. \u2026\u2026 I was surprised. You\u2019re a human being too, huh, Oni-chan?\u201dThen she smiled gently at me.\u201cYeah, okay. I won\u2019t tell. \u2026\u2026 I promise. I won\u2019t tell anyone, so don\u2019t look like you\u2019re about to cry.\u201dAnd unexpectedly, she readily agreed.It would be a loss for her, but she didn\u2019t seem to care about that.\u201cAzusa wants Ryoma Onii-chan to like her, fair and square \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think I want to be loved in return after Shimotsuki-san is a bust, okay? I\u2019m not going to use \u2026\u2026 any sneaky tricks because I want to winover Shimotsuki-san fair and square.\u201dShe declared in a clear voice.Even though she knew she was going to lose out, she was going to stick to her principles.I genuinely thought that was a wonderful thing about her\u2026\u2026.This may be the difference between a \u201csub character\u201d and a \u201cmob character\u201d.Unlike the mob characters who can\u2019t be anything, she has a solid character, \u201cAzusa Nakayama\u201d.I found her to be very charming.\u201cAnd also, \u2026\u2026 you tried to help Azusa in the back of the school building, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m glad you said, \u201cI think you have something to say.\u201d \u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t make use of that support, but you still tried to be nice to this terrible sister.\u201dThen she clenched her fists.As if to give herself a boost, she gives a big push.\u201cI\u2019m not going to bother you. \u2026\u2026 Azusa loves Ryoma Onii-chan, after all.\u201dThen Azusa, who had been depressed earlier, smiled as if she had regained her energy.She had a lovely, friendly smile that was unique to Azusa.\u201cI\u2019m going to do my best to be as good as Shimotsuki-san! I can not afford to be depressed. \u2026\u2026 Azusa is going to visit Ryoma Onii-chan now. I\u2019m going to spoil him a lot and charm him!\u201dShe made a strong declaration and walked away from me.Watching my stepsister\u2019s back, I laughed a little.\u201cYeah, good luck \u2026\u2026.\u201dThe only thing I can do now is cheer her on.I still want Azusa to be rewarded for her feelings.I\u2019m a fake, but I\u2019m still \u201cOnii-chan\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s the rainy season, and the gloomy heat is uncomfortable.My friend Shimotsuki was at my house with the fan all to herself.It\u2019s been about a week since we became friends.For the past few days, Shimotsuki has been visiting my house after school.\u201cListen, listen. I asked my mom and dad for a 7pm curfew!\u3000Now you can have more time to play with Nakayama-kun, okay? Hey, are you happy? By the way, I\u2019m very happy.\u201dIt was yesterday when I heard that news.It\u2019s not that my house and Shimotsuki\u2019s house are not close to each other. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s strange that she came all the way on the bus.It was strange that she wanted to meet me. \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki was a strange girl, as usual.And today she is at home again. She sat hugging the fan in the living room and gave me a mischievous smile.\u201cIs it hot? Hey, Nakayama-kun, are you hot by any chance?\u3000Are you troubled because I\u2019m stealing the breeze from the fan?\u3000That\u2019s too bad. If you want me to share the fan\u2019s breeze, I\u2019d like some ice cream from your freezer.\u201d\u201cNegotiating \u2026\u2026 is more like blackmail.\u201dIt\u2019s my house, and standing in front of my fan, so wanting ice cream is a strange bargain.\u201cWhat do you want, \u2026\u2026 chocolate or vanilla?\u201d\u201cChocolate!\u201dWell, I\u2019m giving it to her.I had bought this ice cream in anticipation of her arrival. But I didn\u2019t expect her to already know what was in the freezer. \u2026\u2026 I guess she saw it without permission. No, I\u2019m not mad at her, but I thought she was being very free.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. \u2026\u2026 I wonder if in a little while it will be too hot to be fooled by ice cream? That\u2019s what summer is all about\u2026\u2026. Isn\u2019t summer always about the beach? What do you do then?\u3000I want to see a video game with marine fields, or a movie where sharks eat people in the ocean, or a cartoon where people go to the ocean.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 So you don\u2019t want to go to ocean in person?\u201dI found this out after we became friends.Shimotsuki is a perfect indoor person. She doesn\u2019t really like outdoor hobbies.\u201cIt\u2019s because it burns my skin. \u2026\u2026 See, I always wear cardigans, don\u2019t I? It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s summer or not, it\u2019s not for fashion. If I get even the slightest exposure to the sun, I\u2019ll turn red, so I have to take care of myself, okay?\u201dShimotsuki always wears a gray cardigan. It\u2019s a little large, and only her fingertips are showing where her hands used to be. I had always thought it was a fashion statement, but apparently there was a good reason.Speaking of which, Shimotsuki wears knee socks every day and keeps her skirt long. That\u2019s why her legs are hardly exposed. She seems to be taking very careful measures to prevent sunburns.\u201cBut I really want to take it off because it\u2019s so hot. \u2026\u2026 In the classroom, my seat is by the window, right? I don\u2019t like it when the sun shines in class. There\u2019s that guy right in front of me. \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-kun\u2019s seat is a little far away, and I\u2019m sick of it. But that ends today.\u201dInstantly excited, Shimotsuki threw the chocolate ice cream into her mouth at once. I wonder if the coldness doesn\u2019t give her a headache. \u2026\u2026 She walked up to me, sniffling.\u201cNakayama-kun, this is a secret \u2026\u2026, but tomorrow, our class will have a seat change. I was asked by our homeroom teacher, Suzuki-san, to create a lottery \u2026\u2026 and he said, \u2018I trust you, Shimotsuki-san will not cheat\u2019.\u201d\u201cOh, \u2026\u2026 really?\u201dOur class changes seats once a month. Every time this happens, a lottery is created, and this time it seems that Shimotsuki has been put in charge of it.\u201cBut I have one concern. But I have one concern, and that\u2019s that my childhood friend Ryuzaki-kun always sits near my seat. \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t intend to, but he\u2019s always in my sight. It\u2019s in. Is that what they call a rotten friendship? Please don\u2019t do this to me.\u201dIt seems that the relationship of childhood friends can twist the concept of probability.Shimotsuki, who spoke in a disgusted tone, must have had quite a hard time so far.\u201cSo, in order to break this bond, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve decided to go rogue this time. It\u2019s not necessary to always be together just because you are childhood friends with someone. It\u2019s not a special relationship, just an old acquaintance, and it\u2019s time to move on, right?\u201d\u201cAh, \u2026\u2026 injustice.\u201dThe way to break the rotten relationship between childhood friends was by force.\u201cSo, Nakayama-kun, please help me, okay? I want you, my friend, to sit near me. \u2026\u2026 If I have any trouble in class, I want you to help me, and I want to help you. Ummm, that\u2019s nice. \u2026\u2026 Boring school life can finally be fun!\u201dWith a sparkle in her eyes, Shimotsuki begins to talk about injustice.She didn\u2019t want to be seated too close to Ryuzaki.\u2026.. The truth is, we shouldn\u2019t be cheating, but I guess we have no choice.I suppose that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like that guy.It\u2019s time for God to separate the fate of the childhood friends who are connected by a rotten fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most of the classmates don\u2019t seem to be interested in it.It is only in primary schools, or just barely in middle school, that people get excited about changing seats.If you\u2019re in high school, you don\u2019t care where your seat is. No, actually, they may care about the opposite sex nearby, but they are not old enough to show it.So the classroom in the morning is quiet as usual\u2026\u2026, but after they came, it became noisy at once.\u201cRyoma Onii-chan, today is the day for changing seats. It would be nice if we could sit near each other again!\u201d\u201cHaha \u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t sleep last night because I had a stomachache. I wish I could be closer to you, Ryoma-san.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ryoma, if I leave you, don\u2019t forget me, okay?\u201dRyoma Ryuzaki\u2019s group arrived in the classroom and immediately made a fuss about changing seats.My stepsister, Azusa, my childhood friend, Yuzuki, and my former best friend, Kirari, look worried. Currently, the three of them have an advantageous position in the Ryuzaki harem. They want to maintain that advantage.They are in the same class, sit close to each other, and have a close relationship \u2026\u2026, so for now they are one step ahead of the other harem members, but if they lose that advantage even a little and the balance of power is lost, they will quickly fall down the rankings.If they are not careful, another heroine will take their place. It\u2019s just a matter of changing seats, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not worried.Well, Ryuzaki is so insensitive that he doesn\u2019t notice such things.\u201cOh dear, calm down. Don\u2019t make too much noise over a mere seat change.\u201dAs usual, he smiles and says he can\u2019t help it.He doesn\u2019t care what the girls think. The hero is not concerned about his seat \u2026\u2026, and no matter which seat he takes, the heroine is always nearby. No wonder.In this year\u2019s second grade class, which I belong to, most of the girls are corrupted by Ryuzaki.All of the girls have some sort of interest in him, and they\u2019re all looking for opportunities to get to know him.It\u2019s probably because he doesn\u2019t have a problem with women that he can say such annoying lines as, \u201cOh dear.\u201d no matter what the harem members say to him.But \u2026\u2026 there is one girl in particular who is special to Ryuzaki.The girl hadn\u2019t come to school yet. Her seat was right behind Ryuzaki\u2019s, and she was his childhood friend.Her name is Shiho Shimotsuki.She is a girl with strikingly transparent silvery-white hair.\u201cWell, the seats may change, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m with Shiho. I\u2019ve known her since she was a little girl, so we have a connection. As long as I can be there for her and protect her, I don\u2019t care where we sit.\u201dThe protagonist says boldly.He is so proud of his position as a childhood friend that he has no doubt that he can get the results he wants without any effort.He doesn\u2019t think about the feelings of the other girls who have heard him say that, he just says things that make him happy.He\u2019s still the protagonist, as usual.\u201c\u201d\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201d\u201dThe three girls have a little bit of a sad expression on their face when they hear those words. It\u2019s not too late for Ryuzaki to be obsessed with Shimotsuki, but I guess he\u2019s damaged.However, only one \u2026\u2026 my stepsister, Azusa, was able to get back on her feet quickly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Hmm?\u201dI was looking at them blankly, when suddenly Azusa looked at me and smiled.A week ago, after encountering Shimotsuki at home, \u2026\u2026 Azusa seemed to become a little stronger.I had the impression that her heroine status had improved.Even now, she has a sturdy smile on her face.\u201cEh~? It\u2019s terrible, Ryuzaki Onii-chan is okay with leaving Azusa? If you say anywhere is fine, it makes me sad \u2026\u2026 gusu gusu.\u201dCrying, Azusa hugged Ryuzaki from behind as he sat in his chair.\u201cOh, come on, it\u2019s too much. \u2026\u2026 Okay, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve said such horrible things, but I want to be with Azusa and everyone else.\u201dHe even uses this moment to his advantage and indulges himself well.\u2026\u2026 As always, though, it\u2019s a sight that almost breaks my mind.Well, anyway. I cheered her on in my heart.That\u2019s good, Azusa. You can take advantage of these opportunities to improve your reputation.After this, there will be a big opportunity \u2026\u2026 for you to never miss it?When Ryuzaki is broken off from his childhood friend by the power of injustice, he is sure to be shocked.If Azusa can take advantage of his heartbreak, she will be one step ahead of the other heroines.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that the rotten connection of childhood friends is holding them together.In order to break this bond, Shimotsuki seems to have decided to go rogue this time.She must have decided that she couldn\u2019t let this opportunity to create a lottery pass her by.Yesterday, she said something like this.\u201cI stuck the lottery tickets on the top four corners of the lottery box. This should be a perfect solution for Ryuzaki-kun!\u201dThe contents of the fraud are as follows.Let\u2019s say the classroom is divided into four sections and Ryuzaki sits in the back left seat. At that time, I was asked to take the lottery ticket from the upper right front side of the lottery box.It seems that each of the four corners of the lottery box has two lottery tickets attached to the top. The lottery on the top of the right rear of the box is linked to the lottery on the right rear of the classroom, and so on.\u201cIf you win the lottery, make sure you get rid of all the lottery tickets in the other corners. It\u2019s only lightly glued on, so it\u2019ll come off easily and they probably won\u2019t even notice.\u201d\u2026\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t think anyone would think that I would cheat in such a seat change, and I don\u2019t think they would find out.Even if they found out, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. The homeroom teacher, Suzuki-sensei, would probably be stunned at best.It\u2019s only Shimotsuki who does so much for a mere seat change.But it\u2019s a scary thing that she has to do something like this to break the rotten relationship with her childhood friend.As soon as I was thinking about this, the morning class started.\u201cHi, everyone, good morning. \u2026\u2026 Oops, Shiho Shimotsuki, you\u2019re just in time! You\u2019re actually out of time, but it\u2019s only for a few seconds, so I\u2019ll let you off the hook~.\u201dJust as the teacher arrived, Shimotsuki arrived at about the same time. In her hand, she is holding a box that seems to contain lottery tickets.Unusually, she was just in time today.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe bowed her head apologetically, though she was too shy to raise her voice. Her face is expressionless, so at first glance she looks unconcerned, but I know she\u2019s actually just nervous and her expression is tense.Now that I\u2019ve gotten to know her better, I can tell a lot more about her.Shimotsuki is neither emotionless nor unsociable, she is simply a clumsy person who is very shy and has difficulty with human relations.\u201cOkay, so let\u2019s switch seats right away. Shimotsuki-san, did you make the lottery?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Yes.\u201dWhen Suzuki-sensei called out to her, Shimotsuki held out the box she was carrying.\u201cYes, thank you. Then, come and get it in the order of your attendance number~.\u201dSuzuki-sensei started to change the seats without thinking that she was being cheated on. Our attendance numbers are determined by address, not by alphabetical order, so I was supposed to draw my number after Ryuzaki.\u201cShiho, what\u2019s wrong? You were almost late, did something happen?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Nothing.\u201dRyuzaki was still engaging with Shimotsuki, but she seemed annoyed. She was staring at the blackboard without even looking at him.\u201cIf you need anything, just let me know. We\u2019re childhood friends, so don\u2019t be shy. We\u2019re changing seats today, but we\u2019re always close to each other anyway. \u2026\u2026 I wonder\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEven though he laughed briskly, Shimotsuki made a face of ignorance.She really doesn\u2019t seem to like it. \u2026\u2026 I wonder if she\u2019s holding back because it\u2019s only until today.And I\u2019m also looking forward to seeing Ryuzaki\u2019s face when he finds out that he can\u2019t be near Shimotsuki.\u201cYes, Ryuzaki-san, please come and draw the lottery.\u201d\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019m coming, Suzuki-chan.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m a teacher, but you can\u2019t call me chan~\u201dRyuzaki drew a lottery. As I watched to see where he would be, he wrote his number in the center seat.The power of fate is unbelievable.Though they couldn\u2019t sit next to each other due to irregularities, he took a seat as close to Shimotsuki as possible. In the center, it would be the closest place to the four corners.(I wonder what would happen in that case?)Shimotsuki, being the creator of the lottery, is supposed to be the last to draw the lottery. This may be an anti-cheating measure \u2026\u2026, so it\u2019s okay for me to choose.I think I\u2019ll take the back right seat anyway.That\u2019s where my seat is now. It should be good because the sun won\u2019t shine on her here.\u201cThen \u2026. Nakagawa \u2026\u2026. Nakayama \u2026\u2026?\u201dSuzuki-sensei called out my name. She\u2019s my homeroom teacher, but she doesn\u2019t remember me because I\u2019m so shadowy. I\u2019m used to teachers not remembering me, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it.I went to the front and put my hand into the lottery box on the podium.I took one of the lots on the upper right rear side and then removed the lots from the three remaining corners.(Not good\u2026\u2026. took longer than I thought.)They probably thought I was messing around.However, Suzuki-sensei was smiling and laughing, so it was fortunate that people didn\u2019t think I was cheating.\u201cOh my? Did you really look forward to the seat change?\u201d\u2026.. You\u2019re mistaken, but that\u2019s okay.\u201cYes. That\u2019s how it is.\u201dI said the words nonchalantly and showed the teacher my lottery ticket.Of course, the location was shifted to the right back of the classroom, no \u2026\u2026, but one next to it. So, if everything goes according to plan, it looks like Shimotsuki will be sitting in my current seat.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Hmm?\u201dThe only thing that stuck out to me was the dubious look on Ryuzaki\u2019s face.Well, I guess he doesn\u2019t know. Let\u2019s hope so.\u201cOkay. Lastly, Shimotsuki-san, here you go~\u201dThen Shimotsuki drew the ticket.Even though it was the last one, there were still three seats available since there were absentees. One of them is next to Ryuzaki, and if something goes wrong, Shimotsuki will again be bound by a rotten relationship. \u2026\u2026 This time, it seems that the power of cheating has won.\u201cYes, right in the back. Then, subtract the absentees and \u2026\u2026. that is it?\u201dShimotsuki came next to me.\u201cWhat !?\u201dIt was Ryuzaki who was the most surprised at that time.His eyes widened and he stared at the blackboard as he leaned forward.\u201cWell, seriously\u2026\u2026!\u201dI almost laughed as I watched the astonishment in his eyes.Oh, no. \u2026\u2026 I can feel myself getting uglier and uglier. But a black emotion filled my heart and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Don\u2019t think that everything is going to be the way you want it to be, okay?It seems that the main heroine hates you more than you think\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was one position off from the back of the class on the hallway side. And in the far corner, Shimotsuki.In other words, she\u2019s sitting in the same seat I was sitting in a while ago.\u201cI\u2019m so glad\u2026\u2026 I was afraid I\u2019d end up next to him again.\u201dMuttering in a small voice, Shimotsuki dropped down as if exhausted.She put her cheek on the desk and stared at me.\u201cThe plan worked. Thank you.\u201dShimotsuki thanked me in a small voice, and I shook my head, telling her not to worry about it.I can do anything for her. No matter how much trouble she gives me, no matter how unreasonable she is, I would gladly give my life for her if it would make her happy.That\u2019s the extent of Shimotsuki\u2019s existence to me.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026\u201dBut she looks somewhat awkward.It seems like she has a lot to say, but when she opens her mouth, it\u2019s only faintly audible, and she breaks off her words unusually quickly.She usually strings together sentences as if she were rambling, so she doesn\u2019t seem to be in the right frame of mind.I wondered what the reason was.I was curious, but the class started and the chatter soon ended.The Japanese class had started, so I opened my textbook and turned my gaze toward the blackboard.Then, Ryuzaki, who was naturally in the center of the room, came into view and \u2026\u2026 to my surprise, our eyes met.(What\u2019s wrong with him!? Glaring at me so much, are you jealous of \u2026\u2026 the mob?)Inwardly, black emotions were swirling in my mind, but I was careful not to let them show on my face.I made a show of pouting, as if I were some kind of optimistic mob character.Ryuzaki clicks his tongue at me. He turned his gaze away and looked forward. You can\u2019t keep looking behind you because you\u2019re in class. \u2026\u2026 Thank goodness I was in the back seat, or I would have had to keep an eye on him.To be honest, I try to avoid talking to Shimotsuki in front of Ryuzaki.To him, I had to be a good-natured mob character. I want to be just a stage prop, a dog in an unrequited love affair, not even a trigger for the progress of the story. It\u2019s safer for Shimotsuki.But now that we\u2019re sitting next to each other in the classroom, we\u2019ll naturally have more opportunities to chat. \u2026\u2026 That\u2019s a problem if Ryuzaki sees us, I thought.Suddenly, I was offered a notebook from next to me.(\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this?)I took it reflexively, but I was confused because I couldn\u2019t understand why.There was nothing to see on the plain brown notebook. There was nothing written on the cover, so I didn\u2019t know what it was about.I looked at the person who had given it to me, not knowing why she had given it to me.Shimotsuki, who was right next to me, laughed mischievously and gestured for me to open the notebook.What in the world is this?I open the first page. On the first page, there was written the following.\u201cShiho and Nakayama-kun\u2019s Diary\u201d\u2026\u2026 What? You\u2019re in elementary school???I didn\u2019t expect to have to do an exchange diary when I was in high school, so I was a little suspicious that Shimotsuki wasn\u2019t actually in elementary school.No, well, I know that\u2019s not possible.Although her body is thin and small, Shimotsuki is a definite high school student.In other words, she simply wants to have an exchange diary.\u201cTo Nakayama-kun. In my previous life, I was a small animal with a strong sense of identity, so I can\u2019t talk well in public. That\u2019s why I came up with the idea \u2026\u2026. That\u2019s right, if we can\u2019t talk, why don\u2019t we write a diary like this? I thought.\u201dI read through the text.Perhaps it was because she had decided to start a diary in a serious way, but compared to her last random letter, she seemed to be trying harder to use kanji. However, the number of strokes and the fact that she didn\u2019t seem to know any difficult kanji made it look like an elementary school composition.However, I could feel her feelings.She was too nervous to speak well in the presence of others, but she still wanted to communicate with me, so she came up with the idea of an exchange diary.\u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t believe there are such pure girls out there.I thought she was like a elementary school student, but \u2026\u2026 that\u2019s not a bad thing.It\u2019s the innocence that keeps you as innocent as a child even when you\u2019re in high school that makes men\u2019 hearts flutter.I am sure that Shimotsuki has never been stained with any one particular color.She is colorless, transparent and \u2026\u2026, which makes you desire to dye her with your own colors.There is a certain charm about her that makes me desire to have her heart all to myself.I wonder if that is why Ryuzaki is also captivated by Shimotsuki.That\u2019s how much of a demonic charm she seems to have.If I hadn\u2019t been aware that I was a mob character, I would have been in danger.I might have misunderstood and become strongly conscious of Shimotsuki as a member of the opposite sex.That would have been unreasonable.Just being friends is enough, but a relationship beyond that is \u2026\u2026 aspired to, but there was also a sense of resignation that it was still impossible.At least, I\u2019m afraid to remain a mob character.So I won\u2019t be misunderstood. I picked up the mechanical pencil, eliminating all feelings except those of a friend.\u201cAll right. Pleasure to work with you.\u201dI wrote a short, single sentence and returned the note to Shimotsuki.She took it with an excited look on her face, but her lips twitched in frustration, as if she was disappointed.Maybe she wanted me to write something longer. No, was it too plain?\u2026\u2026 Well, no matter. I can continue to keep the diary while trying to figure out what kind of text would satisfy Shimotsuki.But this is good.I thought this was a good idea, because I could communicate with Shimotsuki without worrying about Ryuzaki\u2019s eyes\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like a baby bird left behind in the nest.And since Shimotsuki is shy and doesn\u2019t talk much in class, I don\u2019t think it makes a difference whether I\u2019m there or not.I think \u2026\u2026, but maybe it\u2019s different for Shimotsuki.Apparently, she seems to be at ease just knowing that I am next to her.She looks at me all the time, and when our eyes meet, she smiles at me. \u2026\u2026 An unexpected smile is bad for the heart because it makes me nervous.I still can\u2019t get used to it because I have no idea why she misses me so much.She really is a strange girl.I finished my business while thinking about that.I wonder if the reason I\u2019m walking so fast is because I\u2019m subconsciously trying not to keep Shimotsuki waiting.I was thinking of returning to the classroom as soon as possible, but on the way \u2026\u2026, I was interrupted.\u201cHey. Nakayama, do you have a minute?\u201dThe one leaning against the wall in the hallway was Ryoma Ryuzaki, the protagonist.Do you have a minute? It was a formal question, but he didn\u2019t care about my answer. He didn\u2019t even wait for an answer, he just came at me.\u201cDid you do something during the seat change? To my eyes, it looked like you were cheating.\u201dI knew he suspected it.I was expecting to be questioned like this, since I had seen the suspicious look on his face during the lottery.I was already prepared to fake it.That\u2019s why I laughed in a funny way. I tried to play the role of a good-natured mob, trying to play it off.\u201cWhat are you talking about? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t because I was upset that I didn\u2019t hesitate to say something.It was a trap to mislead Ryuzaki\u2019s perception.\u201cYou\u2019re hiding something, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re chewing on your words a lot.\u201dHe clenched his fists and took another step closer to me.\u00a0He grabbed me by the chest as hard as he could.He was quick to show his hands. \u2026\u2026 That\u2019s how annoyed he was.The protagonist is obnoxious.\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll be honest with you, \u2026\u2026, so please forgive me~.\u201dLike a dog that has been bitten, I show a slumped posture.I was worried that I was overacting, but Ryuzaki was not calm and did not seem to notice the difference.\u201cTell me quickly. What did you do?\u201dOkay, he\u2019s saying it well.While laughing inwardly, I made a troubled expression on my face and said the answer I had prepared in advance.\u201cI was just cheating on the lottery. \u2026\u2026 If I didn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get close to Shimotsuki-san, whom I adore.\u201dHalf of it is true, half of it is a lie.It\u2019s not really my fault, but \u2026\u2026 I wanted to make sure that Ryuzaki knew that this cheating was planned by me.To make Ryuzaki realize that this is \u2018just a miserable mob character\u2019 struggling painfully.\u201cBut, Shimotsuki-san is always so naive that it hasn\u2019t worked out so well\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt the same time, I casually pretended that it was a failure to make Ryuzaki feel less jealous.It will make the protagonist feel much better.\u201cOh, I see. You cheated after all, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done something clever. \u2026.. Shiho is a serious person, she doesn\u2019t like that kind of thing. You can\u2019t get people to like you stupidly for cheating.\u201dThis seems to have taken some of the frustration away.With a sigh, Ryuzaki let me go.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a tip, okay?\u201dHe then gave me the advice that a protagonist should appreciate.\u201cThere have been many men who have fallen in love with Shiho like you. \u2026\u2026 All of them have been crushed. I\u2019m not sure what to say. She\u2019s not interested in other people. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the type who only opens up to the person she\u2019s married to. So don\u2019t be too pushy.\u201dI almost laughed at that statement.(Shimotsuki is serious? Not interested in others? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. \u2026\u2026)She\u2019s quite the prankster.She often teases me and laughs at me like a little devil.And it\u2019s not that she\u2019s not interested in other people.It\u2019s just that she\u2019s too shy to chat with others.And yet, Ryuzaki\u2019s misconception of Shimotsuki was a little scary, as he misunderstood her in a way that suited him.\u201cYou\u2019d better give up on Shiho. This is for your own good. \u2026\u2026 Taking on a reckless challenge is not a bad idea, but you\u2019d better step aside before you get too hurt.\u201dWith serious good intentions, the protagonist-sama gives me unnecessary fuss.I wanted to say this out loud to Ryuzaki.It\u2019s none of your business\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think we need air conditioning by now, but our school seems to be reluctant to pay the electricity bill, so we haven\u2019t turned it on yet.Instead, the windows are fully open to let the air flow in. However, it didn\u2019t make much of a difference to me as all that came in was a lukewarm breeze.\u201cShiho had been popular since elementary school. A lot of guys confessed to her, but she turned them all down. \u2026\u2026 They didn\u2019t even take her seriously. She\u2019s that kind of girl. \u2026\u2026 She\u2019s serious, she\u2019s strong, and she\u2019s determined to only let her heart go out to the person she\u2019s going to marry when she grows up.\u201dI walked up to the open window, listening to the protagonist\u2019s appreciative speech.Frowning at the lukewarm breeze, I wiped the sweat from my forehead.I heard that in the past, schools tried to keep the air conditioner off as much as possible, but recently, more and more schools are turning it on to prevent heat stroke. I wish my school would follow their example.\u2026\u2026 No, maybe this is set up so that the protagonist can cause an event.That\u2019s it. It is a kind of promise that the uniforms of sweaty female students are transparent. The main character has a good time with it, and the girls seen aren\u2019t too happy about it, so it creates a good situation \u2026\u2026.I remember that my best friend Kirari used to read light novels to get along with me because she liked them.I neither liked nor disliked them, so I\u2019m not passionate enough to call it a hobby, but Kirari seemed to enjoy it when we talked about them\u2026.., and that made me happy.I wonder who Kirari is talking to about it now?\u2026\u2026 No, she\u2019s not talking to anyone anymore, is she?Ryuzaki told me that he likes girls with flashy colors, so so I dyed my own hair and pretended to be a flashy girl to fit the bill.That\u2019s why I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t even told Ryuzaki that she likes light novels.\u201cHey, are you listening to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh, yeah. I\u2019m listening.\u201dOops, I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I\u2019ve been in a daze, so I haven\u2019t really thought about it. But it didn\u2019t seem to be worth it, so what was the problem?In any case, he was just showing off the information about how much he knew about Shimotsuki.And it\u2019s a wrong understanding, so I\u2019m just confused when it\u2019s told to me.\u201cIn short, I should give up on Shimotsuki, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Even I, a childhood friend, took a long time to get along with her. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s impossible for a guy who just suddenly became a classmate.\u201dYeah, I think so too. It\u2019s unheard of for the main heroine to find specialness in a mere mob character, isn\u2019t it?Shimotsuki really is a strange girl. I agree with that, but I think \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki probably doesn\u2019t get along with her, you know?\u201cI\u2019ve just been lucky. It\u2019s like we\u2019re childhood friends and we\u2019re specially close to each other. \u2026\u2026 Looking at you, it kind of hurts my heart. You should not have a painful love.\u201dThe fact that they are childhood friends makes the equation that they are close. \u2026\u2026 The relationship of childhood friends seems to be the absolute solution for the protagonist.\u201cI\u2019ll take it or leave it. That\u2019s my motto, hit and miss!\u201dActing like an optimistic person was tiring, but I had to go along with Ryuzaki until he was satisfied. It is not possible for a mob character to not go along with the protagonist\u2019s wishes.\u201cI\u2019m worried about you because you might really break, but are you really that stupid \u2026\u2026? Do you know that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. What\u2019s the matter? You\u2019ve been saying that since before \u2026\u2026, does Ryuzaki like Shimotsuki-san? Oh, by the way, you haven\u2019t made that clear yet!\u3000As your rival, I\u2019m curious about that, so tell me.\u201dOh, I think I did a good job of acting that one.It\u2019s the kind of line you\u2019d expect to hear from a mob character who\u2019s merely a dog.And yet, I can ask him what I\u2019m really interested in.In the past, I\u2019ve been somewhat aware that Ryuzaki has a liking for Shimotsuki, but he has never mentioned it to me \u2026\u2026 clearly.No matter what happens, it won\u2019t change the outcome, and I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing it.I already know that he likes Shimotsuki. From what he has said and done so far, he seems to be absolutely aware of it. So, the only difference is whether or not he is expressing those feelings.That\u2019s why I want to know what kind of response he will give.It\u2019s not like he\u2019s the kind of person who would just say, \u201cI love her\u201d \u2026\u2026.Because he is the protagonist with a harem attitude.Indecisiveness is his patent.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I like her, but she\u2019s my \u2026\u2026 childhood friend, so it\u2019s only natural that we be together. She\u2019s like my sister, my family\u2026\u2026, and I have to make her happy. So I\u2019d say I like her, but not exactly like you like her\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat?When I saw Ryuzaki\u2019s sluggishness, I had a concern.I thought for sure that Ryuzaki liked Shimotsuki.(Does this guy \u2026\u2026 really like Shimotsuki?)I felt that it was not a normal feeling of love.If I were to compare it to that, it would be like having a pet.It\u2019s natural to take care of her, it\u2019s natural to protect her, and therefore she has the right to have her tail between her legs. I felt a chill down my spine, thinking that this is the kind of twisted love.(So this is what the \u2026\u2026 harem route is like.)I had thought that Ryuzaki was the protagonist of a story in which he had a harem mentality but loved one girl.But he\u2019s not. Isn\u2019t this guy trying to go the harem route after loving Shimotsuki with all his heart?I almost got goosebumps at such a horrifying prospect.A sentence I had seen before flashed through my mind.The protagonist in the story had said.\u201cI like all of you! But each one of you has a different form of \u2018love,\u2019 so you\u2019re equal!\u201dOne heroine loved as the opposite sex.Another heroine loved as a friend.Another heroine loved as a benefactor.Other heroines loved as family.So he can love them all equally.He will make everyone happy.He wanted everyone to be loved only by him \u2013 I remembered such an arrogant story.Originally, I wondered if Shimotsuki would have been a part of it.I think she was framed as a childhood friend, and was added to the harem.But to call it \u201clove\u201d, I think the form is too distorted.That\u2019s not love.It\u2019s just selfishness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is the only time I\u2019ll overlook your cheating.\u201dHe must have finished what he wanted to say.It seems that Ryuzaki is finally ready to let me go.\u201cShiho and I have known each other since childhood, so we were supposed to be next to each other again this time\u2026. I\u2019m going to pretend that this time I\u2019ve been beaten. You\u2019re pretty good at this.\u201dHow can someone say that from that viewpoint of the top?\u2026\u2026 No, it\u2019s not unnatural because he\u2019s actually the top.He\u2019s the protagonist, and I\u2019m a mob character, so the hierarchy of our positions is clear.The reason why I get annoyed every time is simply because I hate Ryuzaki.I still hate Ryuzaki.I have the same feelings for Ryuzaki as Shimotsuki.\u201cOh, oh. Thank you for letting me off the hook this time. It\u2019s not very promising, but I\u2019m not giving up.\u201dHowever, if I were to argue or retort, the conversation with Ryuzaki would continue.So I gave him a bland reply and broke off the conversation.Thanks to this, Ryuzaki seemed to be satisfied.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the classroom.\u201dAfter saying that, he turned his back on me and walked into the classroom.He headed towards the center of the room where he had taken his new seat. The protagonist\u2019s opportunism is very frightening because the sub-heroines are surrounding him tightly.The sub-heroines seem to be relieved to be near Ryuzaki safely.Even now, I\u2019m even more jealous of him than usual when he comes back. Of course, Azusa, Yuzuki and Kirari were among them.I\u2019m sure that if I hadn\u2019t cheated, Shimotsuki would have been among them. I\u2019m glad that didn\u2019t happen\u2026\u2026, but yes, her seat was in the corner.(Maybe she heard us talking\u2026\u2026.?)Shimotsuki has a keen sense of hearing.It is very likely that she heard our conversation because she is sensitive to sound.(Not good. \u2026\u2026 I let my guard down.)What if she heard our conversation?I have no idea what kind of feelings Shimotsuki will have. Will she be dismayed, angry, sad, or happy? \u2026\u2026 Hopefully, not too negative.With this in mind, I returned to the classroom.The first thing I did was to check on Shimotsuki. She was in her seat, holding both ears.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Ugh.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but call out to her. But Shimotsuki didn\u2019t seem to hear anything, she didn\u2019t even notice me.I had no choice but to wave my hand in front of her to make my presence known.Instantly, she looked at me and her expression brightened.\u201cNakayama-kun. You\u2019re late. I was waiting for you \u2026\u2026. Here, let\u2019s do the diary.\u201dThe fact that she doesn\u2019t talk much and her voice is very low is probably due to the fact that her classmates are around her.As usual, she\u2019s shy. Her voice is so low that I can only hear her if I\u2019m sitting next to her.\u201cOkay, but \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki, did you by any chance hear our conversation earlier?\u201dShe wanted to do an exchange diary, but I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019ll have to wait.What I was curious about was whether or not she had heard the conversation between me and Ryuzaki.When I asked her about it, Shimotsuki made a blatantly disgusted face.\u201cI know that Nakayama-kun was chatting with that person just now. But I don\u2019t want to hear just the sound of that man, so I basically cover my ears when I hear his voice. So I didn\u2019t hear the conversation.\u201d\u201cIf you weren\u2019t listening \u2026\u2026, that\u2019s okay.\u201dAnyway, she seems to be uncomfortable with Ryuzaki.Speaking of which, she covered her ears earlier and \u2026\u2026 probably isn\u2019t even lying to me. In front of me, Shimotsuki\u2019s emotions show on her face and are easy to understand. I can even tell if she\u2019s lying or not.\u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. Let\u2019s keep a diary. Here, I\u2019ve been working hard on my writing. Read it, read it.\u201dShimotsuki pushed the diary to me.Hmm, what can I say, \u2026\u2026 too much, I felt like she was not interested in Ryuzaki.\u201cDon\u2019t you care about what Ryuzaki is talking about?\u201dI don\u2019t like Ryuzaki either, but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t like him that I\u2019m curious about what he\u2019s up to. If Shimotsuki disliked him as well, she could have overheard the conversation.I was curious, so I asked her frankly.Then she said with a puzzled look on her face.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking me that. \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t really care what he says.\u201dShe looked deeply uninterested.She looked at me as if she was in a physics class, and finally realized something.Shimotsuki and I don\u2019t hate Ryuzaki in the same way.In fact, I\u2019m the only one who hates Ryuzaki.Shimotsuki is completely \u201cindifferent\u201d to that guy.In a way, that\u2019s even crueler than the feeling of dislike.There is a saying that the opposite of love is indifference.Besides, a romantic comedy that starts with a big dislike is a standard story. If Shimotsuki had disliked Ryuzaki, there might have been such a development.However, Shimotsuki is not interested in Ryuzaki. Probably, she neither likes nor dislikes him, but just concentrates her feelings of \u201cdislike\u201d.If Ryuzaki knew that, what would he think?Wouldn\u2019t he break down and give up? \u2026\u2026 No, well, that\u2019s not likely.Because that guy is the protagonist.He is the one who will never give up until he is tied to the main heroine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Good morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ah, yes. Good morning.\u201dWhen I came to school in the morning, he started to talk to me.But that doesn\u2019t mean that Ryuzaki and I have become friends. If anything, Ryuzaki seems to be wary of me.That\u2019s it. It\u2019s like a security guard who dares to greet a suspicious person.\u201cI\u2019m always watching you.\u201dI felt as if I was being told that, and I was sick of it.Well, fortunately, I think he still recognizes me as a \u2018mob character\u2019 for now, so there is no danger.It\u2019s also unfortunate that Shimotsuki is shy and keeps quiet in the classroom. Our interactions are basically in the diary, and we don\u2019t have any open conversations at all.I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to talk a lot, but if she does, Ryuzaki will witness it and will probably become very conscious of me.If he becomes even more hostile than he already is, I won\u2019t be able to remain a mob character. I\u2019ll become a character that opposes the main character, and that guy might try to fight me.If that happens, the main heroine, Shimotsuki, will be in trouble. It\u2019s not what I want.\u2026\u2026 I wonder if I should keep my distance a bit.I think I\u2019ve become too friendly with Shimotsuki. This made Ryuzaki wary of her, and it didn\u2019t seem like a good idea.I don\u2019t want Shimotsuki to feel sad because of me.That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for me to remove my presence as a mob character. It was a natural thing to do since it was a minor role that did not affect the progress of the story.That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking.But she still would not allow me to do so.\u201cHey, hey, Nakayama-kun. Do you think studying will be useful in the future?\u3000No, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be useful. There\u2019s no such thing as equations, and thinking about numbers in terms of a, b, x, y, variables? It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to think of numbers in terms of a, b, x, y, and henceforth.\u201dIt was after school.The midterm exams are coming up soon, and even the study-phobic Shimotsuki seems to have finally gotten in the mood to buckle down. It was already a little late since it was three days before the exam, but she was studying.The place was my house.No, \u2026\u2026 I know it\u2019s not good. I\u2019ve become too intimate with her and I suggested that we study at my house for the exam. But Shimotsuki didn\u2019t want that.\u201cI don\u2019t study at home. But my mom will scold me if I\u2019m too silly, so I want to study. \u2026\u2026 My dad doesn\u2019t scold me, but I still want him to praise me. So, please, \u2026\u2026 study with me.\u201dShe\u2019s the type of person who can\u2019t concentrate when she\u2019s alone.She said that there were too many temptations in her room.\u201cAlso, it would be nice if you could \u2026\u2026 teach me. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, but I\u2019m in the bottom half of the class and I\u2019m so dumb that even I\u2019m surprised, so please take care of me!\u201dI\u2019m not that smart either, my grades are a little below average.But compared to me, Shimotsuki\u2019s grades are totally low.She is quite a clumsy girl.She looks perfect, and her tone and gestures are elegant, giving off the vibe that she\u2019s intelligent, but what\u2019s inside \u2026\u2026 is quite interesting.She is a heroine in her own right, with her own unique character. When she asked me to do something for her, there was no way I could say no as I was only a mob character.That\u2019s why Shimotsuki was at my house for the entire exam period.\u2026\u2026 I still feel like we\u2019re getting too close.After school, Ryuzaki doesn\u2019t interfere with Shimotsuki, so so far the secret meeting between her and I hasn\u2019t been exposed.But I was scared that he might find out by chance.This makes him seem like an interloper.I think I am a little too obvious for a mob character.I hope nothing happens \u2026My life as a mob character is slowly starting to fall apart.When the midterm exams are over, our school starts an overnight training program.It is an important event in the school romantic comedy.This is the time when the protagonist plays the most active role and the story starts to move rapidly.To be honest, I was worried about whether I would be able to remain a mob character at that time\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I got a 32 on my math test. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m so happy I\u2019m going to cry. My mom and dad were so happy, and they praised me so much! Yesterday, they made my favorite hamburger steak. I was so happy. \u2026\u2026 This is all thanks to you, Nakayama-kun. Thank you!\u201dAfter school, Shimotsuki came to my house and smiled with tears in her eyes.It seems that she was very happy to have avoided a red mark.She was so happy that she grabbed my hand and started shaking it around. It may have been a handshake, but \u2026\u2026 please don\u2019t do skinship unexpectedly. I\u2019m so nervous, it\u2019s bad for my heart.\u201cYou\u2019re a great friend, Nakayama-kun. \u2026\u2026 Thank you so much for helping me with my brain, which is not absorbing like a torn up sponge. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t remember things well, okay?\u201d\u201cNo \u2026. It\u2019s just that Shimotsuki worked so hard, and your efforts properly showed in the results. Congratulations.\u201dMy help was really minimal.It seems that Shimotsuki is a proper \u201ccan do anything\u201d girl. You can say that it is natural that the efforts are reflected in the results, since she is the main heroine.I\u2019m a little jealous of that, because I\u2019m a mob character whose efforts don\u2019t lead to results.\u2026\u2026 There was a time when I studied hard to catch up with my smart childhood friend Yuzuki, even if only a little. At that time, I thought I was the protagonist, and if I studied hard, I was sure I could catch up.But the results were not so good. In hindsight, I can\u2019t blame myself for that since I was a mob character. It is because the value of the character remains the same no matter how you do it that the character is cast as a mob.\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m finally free from my studies. That\u2019s very good, but \u2026\u2026 we have to have an overnight program this time, don\u2019t we? Ugh, I don\u2019t want to stay in a place other than my home and Nakayama\u2019s home\u2026\u2026.\u201dShimotsuki, who is an indoor person, seems to be dreading the existence of the overnight program.For her, it would be one disaster after another.\u201cUgh, \u2026\u2026, this is going to remind me of something bad. I\u2019ve always been in the same group with him. When I was in junior high school, I had a fever because I hated the school trip so much. If it weren\u2019t for Nakayama-kun, I\u2019m sure I would catch a cold this time too.\u201dI wonder if colds can be manipulated at will.Well, no. I think she meant that she would take a normal day off.It seems that she and Ryuzaki have always been connected through their rotten relationship.But this time, she\u2019s not going to take a day off.The reason is.\u201cIf Nakayama-kun were present, I might be able to enjoy the overnight learning program a little more. \u2026\u2026 But it doesn\u2019t mean that we will definitely be in the same group. \u2026\u2026 Oh, I\u2019m still worried. I think I\u2019m going to be very bored without you.\u201dBecause I\u2019m there.It\u2019s still strange that Shimotsuki trusts me so much.But if she was relying on me, I wanted to help her as much as I could.\u201cI\u2019ll try my best to be in the group with you.\u201dMaybe Ryuzaki will try to bring Shimotsuki into the group. And since I\u2019m a hindrance to him, he probably won\u2019t let me join the group.If that happens, we\u2019ll be separated.I hoped, along with Shimotsuki, that we could be in the same group \u2026\u2026.But our fears were unfounded.The next day, during the class period, we had to decide on the groups for the overnight learning program.At that moment, to my surprise, Ryuzaki approached me.\u201cHey, Nakayama. You haven\u2019t decided on a group, have you? If so, why don\u2019t you join my group?\u201d\u2013I was taken by surprise.I hadn\u2019t expected him to invite me.Maybe this was a turning point in the story.Is it possible that the most important part of the story, the beginning, middle and end, is about to begin?If so, it was \u2026\u2026 very scary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019d like to include you in the group, so let\u2019s talk.\u201dRyuzaki, who was sitting in his seat, beckoned me over.I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect to be asked to join the group.To be honest, I wanted to refuse, but if I did, I would be disbelieved.A mob character should not be able to defy the will of the main character.As soon as I rebelled, Ryuzaki would become more aware of me\u2026\u2026, which was not convenient.It\u2019s no use, I\u2019ll just do as he says.\u201cAll right.\u201dI stood up from my seat and headed for the center of the classroom where Ryuzaki\u2019s seat was.\u201cMuu \u2026\u201dI can\u2019t help but notice that Shimotsuki looks at me and puffs out her cheeks in frustration. She and I have recently agreed to be in a group together. I want to make her wish come true as much as possible, but I\u2019m not sure how it will turn out.For the overnight learning program, we were supposed to form groups of four boys and four girls each, for a total of eight people.I\u2019m a mob character, so I only have Shimotsuki as a friend. So there was no one else who I could form a group with.That\u2019s why I should have been grateful for Ryuzaki\u2019s invitation.However, I don\u2019t like this guy.I don\u2019t want to be in a group with him, but \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not in a position to stand up to the protagonist head on, so it\u2019s hard to answer.Ideally, Shimotsuki and I would be together and Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s group would be somewhere else. \u2026\u2026 It seems that Shimotsuki and I didn\u2019t have the human skills to do that.\u201cIt looks like most of the other groups have already decided. You are the only one left, right? Our group needs one more person, so come on.\u201dThat\u2019s what he\u2019s saying on the surface, but I can\u2019t help feeling that there\u2019s more to it.Otherwise, there is no reason for Ryuzaki to invite me. I\u2019m sure he has some idea of what he\u2019s doing and is trying to get me to join the group.I don\u2019t want to do what Ryuzaki wants. \u2026\u2026 No, no, no. There is no reason to refuse. It seems that you can\u2019t go against the words of the protagonist. \u2026\u2026 I guess this is the fate of mob characters.I\u2019m sorry, Shimotsuki.It\u2019s going to be difficult to fulfill your ideal.But there is still a chance to avoid the worst.At the very least, Shimotsuki should not be in the same group as Ryuzaki.I don\u2019t care what happens to me as long as that girl doesn\u2019t feel bad. \u2026\u2026 Well, what should I do?\u201cWhat are you confused about?\u3000\u2026\u2026 Oh, I see. Do you hate it when Shiho isn\u2019t around?\u201dI\u2019ve got Ryuzaki mistakenly thinking that \u2018I favor Shimotsuki\u2019.I thought about how I could use that to my advantage and get away with it.\u201cThat\u2019s true. \u2026\u2026 But I don\u2019t like the idea of Shimotsuki-san being with you, my rival. Hmm, that\u2019s right! Let\u2019s put Shimotsuki-san in a separate group for equality. This time, why don\u2019t we develop a friendship between men without worrying about the opposite sex?\u201dActing as the same nimble mob character as ever, I tried to keep Shimotsuki out of Ryuzaki\u2019s clutches somehow.But it was impossible.\u201cI\u2019m going to invite Shiho to join the group this time. I\u2019ve just asked Azusa and the others to invite her.\u201dHe grinned and gave me a fearless smile.I turned around in a huff and before I knew it, Azusa and the others were talking to Shimotsuki.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them for getting along with a guy, right? And since you\u2019re my rival, \u2026\u2026 let\u2019s play fair and square, shall we?\u3000You\u2019ve been acting suspiciously for a while now. It\u2019s time for me to stop being satisfied with being just a childhood friend.\u201dThat declaration sent a chill down my spine.No matter what I say, the story won\u2019t stop now. The mob characters don\u2019t have the power to interrupt the story.So the only hope left was for Shimotsuki to refuse the invitation.\u201cRyoma Onii-chan, I got Shimotsuki-san\u2019s consent too~\u201dI was almost nodding my head when I heard Azusa\u2019s report when she came back.What a surprise, Shimotsuki seems to have accepted the invitation even though Ryuzaki is there.I can\u2019t stop it.The story accelerates.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, Azusa, Yuzuki, and Kirari, the girls in Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s harem, will be with us.And it seems that Shimotsuki has joined the rest of us.Why did she join the group when she had said she was not good with Ryuzaki so much?Could it be that she didn\u2019t know that she was going to be in a group with Ryuzaki?I was so worried that I couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cHey, did you like our overnight learning group?\u201dIt was after school.As usual, she came to my house and nodded her head as she ate the cake I offered her as a snack.\u201cYes.\u201dShe seemed to be busy munching on the cake and was just moving her mouth without saying anything else. I felt a little impatient, since she was usually so chatty that she would explain things to me without even asking.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay? The group that Shimotsuki belonged to also has \u2026\u2026 that guy, you know? Do you know that Ryuzaki will also be working as part of the same group?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dShe nodded again, and this time began to gulp down her juice.I wondered if she didn\u2019t mind being in a group with Ryuzaki.She is carefree and relaxed enough to enjoy a good snack.She had always had such a hard time with Ryuzaki, but her \u2026\u2026 natural attitude seemed unnatural in contrast.\u201cDon\u2019t you hate it?\u201dYou can\u2019t get what you want out of a roundabout question.So I asked her frankly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it painful to be with Ryuzaki?\u201dShimotsuki, who had finally finished his snack time, smiled and answered my question.\u201cNo? Because it\u2019s more painful not to be with you than to be with someone I\u2019m not fond of.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was a surprise.\u2013The pure words hit my heart.The reason was simple.In Shimotsuki\u2019s mind, I probably have a bigger impact than Ryuzaki.She\u2019s become so fond of me that she can paint over the feeling of being uncomfortable with him.I can\u2019t get used to such words of affirmation no matter how many times I hear them.If there hadn\u2019t been someone to give me such special words, I would have felt much happier.I feel like it\u2019s not fair.I feel like a fool for worrying so much about it.\u201cNakayama-kun, I\u2019m sure the overnight learning program won\u2019t be fun, but \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to being with you. I hope I can make at least one memory with you. I\u2019m so nervous that I\u2019m going to have some weird fantasies.\u201d\u2013What kind of weird fantasies?If I hear that now, I have a feeling that the relationship between Shimotsuki and I will change dramatically.If I were the protagonist of the story, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist asking that question.But I\u2019m a mob character.I\u2019m not good enough for her. I have no personality, no character, and am just a symbol.Shimotsuki is too good for such a person.That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t step out of my comfort zone.\u201cLet\u2019s make some memories\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe words I finally managed to reply were bland and ordinary.It was probably not the words that Shimotsuki was really looking for.However, she is still pleased.\u201cYes! I hope it will be wonderful \u2026\u2026. Ehehehe.\u201dThe smile on her face was a little different from her usual smile \u2013 it had a hint of color to it.If I were to use a literary analogy, it would be \u2026\u2026 something like this.It was a lovely smile, like that of a maiden in love.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We were told that we would be able to sleep in the accommodations there.The main thing to do was to socialize.Suzuki-sensei, the homeroom teacher, explained that the purpose of the trip was to help the students get to know their classmates better once they had learned their names and faces.Outdoor cooking, recreational activities, a test of courage, and a campfire were all planned for now.The school may think that the students will be happy, but for someone like me, who doesn\u2019t have many friends and isn\u2019t very active in socializing, it\u2019s quite a pain.Shimotsuki, who is an indoor person, seemed to feel the same way as I did, and didn\u2019t look too happy when the day arrived.\u201cI\u2019m so depressed that I would have caught a cold and fallen asleep if it weren\u2019t for Nakayama-kun.\u201dThe students were to meet in the schoolyard, so we were outside.We were dressed in the school\u2019s designated school uniform. It\u2019s a dark blue jersey, and it\u2019s plain, but when Shimotsuki wears it, it makes any outfit look good.Moreover, today she was wearing a straw hat, probably to protect herself from the sun. It\u2019s a mystery why she chose to wear a straw hat instead of a regular cap, but it looks good on her, so it\u2019s not a problem.Compared to the other girls around her, she looked so cute today that she seemed to sparkle and shine.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staring and \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t speak.\u201dHer speech was lower than usual, probably because she was nervous. Shimotsuki\u2019s inability to speak well is endearing in its own way, though.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026. Oh, by the way, the seats on the bus are in order of attendance, right? Does that mean you\u2019ll be next to that person?\u201dIn our school, attendance numbers are not determined by alphabetical order, but by the order of address. So, Shimotsuki and Ryuzaki are neighbors.I guess she hates that and can\u2019t help it.She laughed elegantly and said.\u201cOh. I have a constitution that makes me prone to bus sickness. \u2026\u2026 So I\u2019ll have to move my seat so I don\u2019t vomit on the person next to me. Yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to ask Suzuki-sensei to help me.\u201dShimotsuki runs off with a thud. What\u2019s the setting? \u2026\u2026 She just put it on. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how much she hates being next to Ryuzaki.I wonder if the lightness of her footsteps is due to her weight. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s as if she has angel wings.\u2026\u2026 No, this is a hallucination.Lately, Shimotsuki has been looking unusually cute. The more I get to know her, the more I become infatuated with her charms.I feel like she\u2019s going to become a deity in a little while.So it seems that Shimotsuki was able to escape from being next to Ryuzaki after asking Suzuki-sensei for help. When she boarded the bus, she sat in the first single seat in the front.Now, who will be sitting in the empty seat?Recently, looking at the situation of the Ryuzaki harem, it seems that my stepsister Azusa is one step ahead of the rest\u2026\u2026, and I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t miss such a chance.Azusa has the same address as me, and our attendance numbers are next to each other, but I think I may be the only one seated there on the \u2026\u2026 bus.I thought that would be good because it would help me relax.\u201cOh, I thought you were \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-kun, you\u2019re sitting next to me today. If possible, I\u2019d like to sit by the window.\u201dUnexpectedly, Azusa came next to me.I was surprised to see that the seat next to Ryuzaki is now available\u2026\u2026. She was so aggressive that she would be the first to sit down if she had been around recently.\u201c\u2026\u2026 The seat next to Ryuzaki is empty?\u201dI wondered if maybe she hadn\u2019t noticed, but how could Azusa not know about Ryuzaki?\u201cI know. But not today. I was in the mood to talk to Nakayama-kun. In fact, for Azusa \u2026\u2026, I\u2019m making a very serious decision this time.\u201dAs Azusa bent down to sit down, I, who was sitting by the window, shifted one position and gave up my seat.\u00a0Although I said myself that we don\u2019t behave as brother and sister outside the house, \u2026\u2026 it seems that it is my sister who unconsciously says that she wants to be near the window at times like this.And me, who listens to her selfishness without any resistance, must have the habit of being an older brother ingrained in my body.I was thinking about such unimportant things, so I was very surprised by Azusa\u2019s comment.\u201cI\u2019m going to confess to \u2026\u2026 Ryoma Onii-chan.\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 !?\u201dI opened my eyes and went rigid.It seems that the time has finally come for the relationship between the Ryuzaki harem to become complicated.I\u2019m sure that Azusa\u2019s confession will be the catalyst for a fierce battle in the Ryuzaki harem.This is it. It\u2019s a preliminary preparation to make the story more exciting in the future.It was an unmistakable \u201cforeshadowing\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leaving the residential area, we headed towards the mountains where there was more and more nature. On the bus, Suzuki-sensei was trying her best to keep the students occupied by imitating a guide.\u201cIn fact, Sensei had a blind date the other day! I\u2019m thirty-two years old, and my parents are insisting that I get married soon. But since I want to marry a nice guy who looks like a prince on a white horse, I don\u2019t want to get into trouble with an arranged marriage.~\u201dHowever, Suzuki-sensei\u2019s talk was not interesting, so the boredom was not overcome. My classmates were chatting among themselves. No one was listening to what Suzuki-sensei was saying.Suddenly, I looked at the front of the bus and saw Shimotsuki sitting at the very front. There was only one seat, and it was for one person. She was leaning against the window, not moving a muscle. She was probably asleep.Then again, no one sat next to Ryuzaki after all. Unlike Azusa, the other members of the Ryuzaki harem were still keeping each other in check, which is why they seemed to have fallen into a state of rigidity. If someone sits down, it will be a problem for them, so they decided not to sit.\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s sad that I\u2019m all alone. \u2026\u2026. But I don\u2019t need friends, because being alone proves how strong a person is.\u201dEven when he is alone, he is always noisy. As usual, the heroines around us giggled when they heard this comment.Although he says he\u2019s a loner, he still has harem members, so he\u2019s in a luxurious situation. Well, I guess he\u2019s just a little fashionable.\u2013And so the bus ride continued.In the middle of it, Azusa next to me started talking to me in a quiet voice.\u201cRyoma Onii-chan seems to be having fun. Maybe it\u2019s because Shimotsuki-san is joining us\u2026. Ryoma Onii-chan said that Shimotsuki-san was sickly, so she generally didn\u2019t participate in these events, right?\u201d\u2026\u2026 That seems to be the way it is in Ryuzaki\u2019s mind.In fact, I heard that she was only skipping it because she didn\u2019t want to be around Ryuzaki, who she didn\u2019t like, but I\u2019ll keep that to myself.\u201cThis is a secret. \u2026\u2026 The truth is, Shimotsuki-san wasn\u2019t even planning on going to this one. When I asked her to join a group, she refused at first. She said, \u201cI\u2019m not really good at this kind of thing.\u201d\u201dI remember that Azusa and others persuaded Shimotsuki to join the group.\u201cBut when I told her that she could be in a group with you, she said yes. I\u2019ve never told Ryoma Onii-chan about this, so it\u2019s a secret.\u201d\u2026\u2026 Oh, so that\u2019s how it was.I was surprised that she accepted the invitation so easily, but I finally understood why.It seems that Azusa knew that we were on good terms, and that\u2019s why she used my presence as an excuse to persuade Shimotsuki.\u201cI was surprised that I was able to convince her more easily than I thought. \u2026\u2026 And Ryoma Onii-chan was happy, so it was kind of complicated.\u201dAzusa smiled dryly.I was impressed by her friendly smile, but since she became involved with Ryuzaki, that smile has become cloudy more often. I\u2019m sorry to report that.\u201cSo, Azusa also thought that she could not be defeated. \u2026\u2026 If things continue as they are, I will always be defeated by Shimotsuki-san, so I decided to confess during this overnight learning program.\u201dFinally, she got right to the point.The reason why she suddenly decided to confess was because of \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki\u2019s presence.\u201cAnd there is a jinx that says if you confess your love to someone at a campfire, you will definitely succeed. So I\u2019m going to try my best to believe in the jinx, even though it\u2019s only a \u2026\u2026 comforting thought.\u201d\u2026\u2026 A jinx, huh.They are excellent stage sets for moving the story along.Jinxes are persuasive and often used as a rationale to change a stagnant relationship.In Ryuzaki\u2019s story, too, the jinx seems to be a major turning point.I wonder what will happen \u2026\u2026. I am very anxious about the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the protagonist has someone else in his heart. So he refuses Azusa\u2019s confession, saying that he can\u2019t have a relationship with her.Then, finally, the insensitive and perceptive protagonist awakens.He said it was the end of being satisfied with a normal childhood friend. \u2026\u2026 If nothing else, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever confess.Because the harem protagonist is always three things when it comes to love: insensitive, indecisive, and sloppy. He would not have been able to confess or even express his love for her.However, Azusa\u2019s confession inspires the protagonist to say, \u201cI can\u2019t be a coward.\u201d He must be thinking, \u201cSince I rejected Azusa\u2019s confession, it would be disrespectful to Azusa if I don\u2019t confess to Shiho!\u201dAnd yet, the rejected Azusa says, \u201cI\u2019ve only been rejected once. I won\u2019t give up on you until you fall in love with me someday.\u201d, suggesting that there will be a change in their relationship in the future.This is how the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki ends.He is finally united with his childhood friend Shimotsuki, and the story has a happy ending.However, this is only the end of the first volume.I assumed that there would be a continuation to Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy.Because there are still many foreshadowing lines that have yet to be resolved.There is still the story of that guy\u2019s harem members.That\u2019s why in the first volume, the protagonist, who is in love with the pure love of his life, is attracted by the charm of the subheroines, who become more present in the second volume. The main heroine who finished her role in the first volume becomes a convenient yes-man for the protagonist and tolerates other girls from the position of \u201cregular wife\u201d in the second volume onward.In this way, Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s story is finally complete.With the catharsis of a harem ending, the story concludes with thunderous applause.\u2013I imagined such a disgusting story.If it were to follow the template, it would be a story like this.However, the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki had only one \u2026\u2026 element of uncertainty.That is the main heroine, Shimotsuki.She is in the position of the main heroine, but she is not even slightly interested in the protagonist.Because of this, the story is getting complicated.The story is about to deviate from the standard template, and instead, a bizarre development is about to begin.In addition to the main characters and sub characters, there was another piece on the board.That was me, the mob character.Can a mob character stay a mob character forever?Even the narrator, me, didn\u2019t know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ryuzaki was excited as he looked around the interior.It seems that this guy has a personality that enjoys such events.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, the excitement of the male members, except for Ryuzaki, was low.That\u2019s understandable. The other three guys were quiet because they were mob characters.After all, Ryuzaki doesn\u2019t have any male friends.He\u2019s popular with the opposite sex like a harem protagonist, but he\u2019s so popular that he\u2019s shunned by the boys.Because of this, the members of the group were like a collection of leftovers.\u201cNakayama, \u2026\u2026 and the other two, please take care tonight, okay?\u201dI\u2019m an exception, but of course Ryuuzaki doesn\u2019t seem to remember the names of the mob characters. The other two are Hanagishi and Ikura. \u2026\u2026 Hey, you\u2019re too disinterested in anything but women.It\u2019s been two and a half months since the entrance ceremony. I think it\u2019s polite to at least remember your classmates\u2019 names.\u2026\u2026 Well, there\u2019s no way the protagonist has such a sensible personality. If he was too normal, he wouldn\u2019t have any character, so it was no use.\u201cThank you. Let\u2019s go to the square! I\u2019m so hungry~!\u201dAt any rate, ignoring the protagonist would offend him, so I\u2019ll just go along with the conversation. I said something that was typical of a stupid, looseheaded mob character.\u201cYeah, I guess so. The girls are waiting\u2026\u2026. They\u2019re going to be pissed if I\u2019m late.\u201dRyuzaki grinned and walked out of the room. Hanagishi and Ikura followed behind him with vague expressions.I made the same vague expression and followed behind Ryuzaki.In the plaza of the nature park, there is a kitchen and a cooking area. We were going to use them to make curry today.The ingredients and cooking utensils were already in the kitchen.After we gathered as a class and took a roll call, we were finally divided into groups and started cooking outdoors.\u201cSo we\u2019re going to start cooking outdoors\u2026\u2026. If anyone here has any cooking experience, please raise your hand.\u201dThe person in charge of the cooking was Yuzuki Hojo, my childhood friend.Her beautiful long black hair was now tied into a single bun. She seemed to have prepared her own apron and headband, so she was all set.She is a really good cook. She seemed confident and motivated.\u201cI wanted to ask someone who was used to working with knives to help me. \u2026\u2026 Hmmm\u2026 I think the only ones with experience are me and Ryoma-san.\u201dThe only one who raised his hand was Ryuzaki. It is a mystery to me why so many protagonists are the type that can cook.\u2026\u2026 Oh, I get it. Many of them are without parents, and they are given the setting of being good cooks to mean that they are independent.If you think about it, it\u2019s easy. Well, I\u2019m a mob character, so even if I didn\u2019t have parents, I wouldn\u2019t be able to cook.\u201cI can cook, too, but not as well as Yuzuki, you know. Don\u2019t rely on me too much, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m pissed off because you\u2019re better than me while saying that.\u201dI don\u2019t care about the conversational events that only make the protagonist feel good about being affirmed, so I\u2019ll skip them.\u201cSo let\u2019s divide up the work, shall we? Azusa-san, would you please rinse the rice? Kirari-san, please arrange the plates. Ryoma-san, please work with me on cutting and seasoning the food.\u201d\u201cOkay, got it. Hmm, what? There\u2019s only one knife. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll borrow one more from Suzuki-chan.\u201dAfter saying that, Ryuzaki once again left the scene.It seems that he is motivated.\u201cThen \u2026\u201dAnd then, one by one, Yuuzuki gave each of us a role in turn.When it was my turn, her eyes widened, as if she had noticed my presence for the first time.\u201cOh \u2026\u2026, Kotaro-san, you were here as well, weren\u2019t you?\u201dYes, I was here.I\u2019m sure she did\u2019t notice because she was preoccupied with the protagonist, but I was here too.\u2026\u2026 We used to be so close that we were together all the time.I guess that was a long time ago too. Now she and I were complete strangers.\u201cWell, Kotaro-san, can you be in charge of \u2026\u2026 the fire?\u201d\u201cYeah, I understand.\u201dWell, I don\u2019t feel anything for Yuzuki now either.Since I had already made up my mind, I was able to finish the conversation without being particularly conscious of it.\u201cSo, all that\u2019s left is \u2026\u2026 Shiho-san. Can I ask Shiho-san to peel the vegetables for me?\u201dAs she said this, Yuzuki handed Shimotsuki the peeler.However, although Shimotsuki is a girl who has the air of being able to do anything, she is surprisingly a clumsy girl who can\u2019t do anything.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Huu?\u201dShe looked at me as if she had never heard of a vegetable having a peel. I don\u2019t think she even knew what a peeler did.\u201cYes, peel them, please. Here you go.\u201dShe probably didn\u2019t think that Shimotsuki was clumsy. Yuzuki handed her a carrot.Shimotsuki took it, but couldn\u2019t seem to figure out how to do it\u2026\u2026. She held the peeler in her right hand and the carrot in her left and tilted her head.Then, I don\u2019t know what she was thinking \u2026\u2026, but suddenly she started to beat the carrot with the peeler. She\u2019s using it like a blunt instrument, what is she doing?\u201c\u2026\u2026Shh, Shiho-san? Um, could it be that you don\u2019t know how to use the \u2026\u2026 peeler?\u201dIt seems that Yuzuki has indeed noticed. She looked at Shimotsuki with a puzzled look on her face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Peeler?\u201dHer head tilted back. This gesture seems to have made Yuzuki realize \u2026\u2026 that she cannot have a conversation with Shimotsuki about food.\u201cI was surprised. I thought you seemed to be able to do everything\u2026\u2026. Well, you\u2019re only human, so you have your weaknesses. Well, then, can I ask you to work with \u2026\u2026 Kotaro-san on the fire?\u201dThat\u2019s why Shimotsuki had to work with me.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Yes, I understand. Ufufu \u266a\u201dAnd Shimotsuki was instantly in a good mood. She handed the peeler and carrot back to Yuzuki and walked over to me with light steps.\u201cThank goodness I can be with \u2026\u2026 you, Nakayama-kun! I\u2019m glad I can\u2019t cook. You know, our kitchen is reserved for my mom. I\u2019m an eater when it comes to food.\u201dAs she said this, she pinched my jersey.She was trying to get my attention by tugging on it like a child, like she was playing a prank.\u201cNakayama-kun, how do you light a fire? Oh, I get it! You rub a wooden board around with a stick, right? I saw it on a survival show the other day. I\u2019ve always wanted to try that, so I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026. No. I think they provide us with igniters and lighters.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Hmmm\u2026 Pee-rah\u2026 and a lot of unfamiliar words in the overnight learning program. I don\u2019t like studying, so I don\u2019t want to use my head too much.\u201dIt was a normal conversation as usual.But Shimotsuki was clearly closer to me.We\u2019ve been close for a while, but today we\u2019re so close that we\u2019re almost touching.I didn\u2019t know what to do as she leaned in closer than usual.I couldn\u2019t cover it up anymore.This distance is no longer the distance between the main heroine and a mob character.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fire, only to \u2026\u2026 ugh.\u201d It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m afraid of my comedic talent. \u2026\u2026!\u201dI guess she was pretty confident about her skills.She looked pretty smug.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Ummm\u2026\u201dTo be honest, I had trouble responding.I had heard it before, and if anything, the joke wasn\u2019t even funny, so my cheeks tensed up. I wondered if I should laugh at her, so I ended up with an expression that I couldn\u2019t really understand.\u201cOh, what? Isn\u2019t it funny? Or did Nakayama-kun not understand this joke? Well, the sound of a horse is \u2018hi-heen,\u2019 right? I combined it with the word \u201cfire\u201d. Also, you want to cry because you were burned by fire by mistake, right? I also added the sound of a \u2018squeal\u2019 to it.\u201dI\u2019m sorry to say that she\u2019s trying her best to explain, but that\u2019s not the point.Maybe this is it. \u2026\u2026 Maybe I should tell her how I honestly feel.I don\u2019t want to contradict Shimotsuki too much, but I think it\u2019s good for friends to tell others what they can\u2019t do.That\u2019s why I said it clearly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2026 it was dull.\u201d\u201c\u2026 !!!!\u201dThen Shimotsuki instantly puffed up her cheeks and stood up vigorously. She looked like a blowfish.\u201cSilly, silly, silly. You have no sense of humor if you can\u2019t understand my best comedy. If a professional comedian were to listen to it, he or she would probably burst out laughing. You can\u2019t help it, Nakayama-kun\u2026\u2026\u201dShe seemed to be unhappy, but it was strange because Shimotsuki seemed to be enjoying herself somehow.\u201cWhat a surprise. I\u2019ve always dreamed of fighting with my friends like this. \u2026\u2026 I think it\u2019s like number 200 on my list of things I want to do with my friends. And friends can get along better after a fight like this, right? I\u2019m so glad I got to be friends with Nakayama-kun. \u266a \u201cIt\u2019s not a fight, but more of a joke, but if she called it a fight, then it was a fight.I let it slide.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh, what? Why don\u2019t you say anything? I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re really depressed because you think I\u2019m mad at you? I\u2019m just kidding, Nakayama-kun. \u2026\u2026 Okay, okay, I\u2019m not mad at you, so don\u2019t be scared. Come on.\u201d\u2026\u2026 And yet, the distance between us is as close as ever.In addition, I suddenly noticed that Shimotsuki has been touching me a lot lately.I think it\u2019s called skinship\u2026\u2026, and she\u2019s still trying to act like a big sister and pat my head, but she\u2019s too short to reach for my head, so I\u2019m forced to pat her back.There were many things I wanted to say to her.But her gestures were so cute that I was too embarrassed to say anything back.\u201cI\u2019m not depressed\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s all I managed to say. But Shimotsuki smiled mischievously and poked me on the cheek.\u201cHuh? But your face is red. Is it possible that you\u2019re embarrassed? You\u2019re turning red from being stroked by your sister, aren\u2019t you? Oh my god, Nakayama-kun has a cute side too. \u2026\u2026 It makes me want to tease you even more.\u201dPlease don\u2019t do that.Even I\u2019m not used to being teased by a ridiculously cute girl like Shimotsuki. When a girl like that teases me, I get too embarrassed to do anything about it.\u201cOh, please, take it easy on me.\u201dWhen I raised my hands in surrender, Shimotsuki smiled softly.The smile that seems to make everyone who sees it happy makes me admire it again.\u201cEhehe ~\u201dI\u2019ve never seen such a cute girl in my life.She was like a concentrated version of \u201ccute\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shimotsuki was trying to tease me for some reason, but I managed to get her to stay behind, saying I was scared to leave the fire out of my sight.Her presence was unsettling in a good way. I left her alone for a bit and repressed my exuberant feelings.Mob characters don\u2019t need any extra emotions. I have to keep my cool.And even though Shimotsuki had gotten the better of me earlier, \u2026\u2026 there were other people around. They were all working, so they didn\u2019t see us, but it was still dangerous.If Ryuzaki sees me and Shimotsuki getting along, we\u2019ll be in big trouble. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll be careful.I told myself that, and went back to the kitchen.There, I saw the protagonist.\u201cHuh? Was Shiho in charge of the fire? Oh, it\u2019s burning well. You\u2019re doing great.\u201dI wondered if he had finished preparing the food. He was holding a pot and was about to heat it up.Before that, it seems that he is trying to have a lovey-dovey time with the main heroine, but he looks very annoyed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Nothing.\u201dShe had such a soft smile on her face just a few minutes ago, but now she was a beautiful woman of ice. She turned her head away with a pout and became expressionless.\u201cHahaha. Shiho is always so humble. \u2026\u2026 But let me praise you once in a while, okay? Thank you for the fire.\u201dRyuzaki was trying to get Shimotsuki\u2019s attention somehow. He is trying to pat her head, as he always does to his harem members. He probably thinks that since the harem members are happy when he does that, Shimotsuki will have the same reaction.But that\u2019s only because it\u2019s done by someone you like, not by someone you\u2019re not interested in.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201dShimotsuki\u2019s expression tightened, and she dodged Ryuzaki\u2019s hand.Next, she looked around as if searching for something\u2026\u2026, and when she spotted me, she immediately ran over to me and got behind me.It\u2019s as if she was trying to hide from Ryuzaki.\u201c\u2026\u2026What? Why is Nakayama \u2026\u2026!\u201dThis is not good. Ryuzaki is upset.He was dismayed by Shimotsuki\u2019s blatant attitude and the fact that she hid behind me.If this is the case, the relationship between Shimotsuki and me might be questioned\u2026\u2026. I sensed this and immediately followed up.\u201cOh, I was in charge of the fire, too! Hey, Ryuzaki \u2026\u2026 is terrible. I worked hard too, so it\u2019s not fair to only praise her.\u201dIt was a spur-of-the-moment thing to do, but I played the role of a good-natured mob character.I think I was a little bitter in my statement, but Ryuzaki still seems to have a lot of pride in himself, and even this much was easily dismissed.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh, I see. So you wanted to say that \u2026\u2026 Shiho was kind enough to set fire to the fire with Nakayama? So, you didn\u2019t want one person to be praised. \u2026\u2026 Hahaha. I\u2019m not sure what to say. But you surprised me. I thought you hated me.\u201dAs usual, he interpreted it in his own convenient way.However, since it was an incoherent statement, Shimotsuki is likely to say something back. I look at her, wishing in my heart that she would not say anything at this point if possible\u2026..\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dFortunately for me, Shimotsuki, who is behind me, had covered her ears and turned away.As usual, she seems to be trying to avoid hearing Ryuzaki\u2019s sounds.Then she probably didn\u2019t even hear what that guy said. Good \u2026\u2026, this way I can still mislead him about the relationship between me and Shimotsuki.But as Shimotsuki\u2019s attitude toward me became more intimate, I realized that it was slowly starting to be difficult.And even Ryuzaki would not always be able to interpret things in a convenient way.\u201cAha. I was surprised \u2026 I was surprised \u2026\u2026 to see you hiding behind Nakayama to get away from me\u2026. It\u2019s as if you like Nakayama, isn\u2019t it? No, I don\u2019t think so. Shiho is a strong girl, and she\u2019s not interested in love right now.\u201dAlthough she is desperately trying to convince herself, Ryuzaki\u2019s anxiety is oozing out in every word he says.Maybe, just maybe, little by little\u2026\u2026Ryuzaki may also be beginning to sense Shimotsuki\u2019s true feelings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Shimotsuki-san Likes the Mob (WN)CH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Protagonist is getting pushed further and further into a cornerWe finished making the curry and had lunch as a group.At times like this, you can tell what kind of character is being cast by where people sit in their seats.First of all, the person who sits in the first seat is, surprisingly, not our protagonist.\u201c\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201c\u201dIt was Hanagishi and Ikura, who were smiling vaguely the whole time.If they have something to do, or if you talk to them, they\u2019ll chat normally, but basically they don\u2019t say anything and just go with the flow.So, when it was time to eat curry, they would naturally take the first seat at the back of the table.Incidentally, another pattern is to sit in the last seat left. In other words, the mob characters are either the first or the last to sit down, and they have no will of their own.Well, the \u2026\u2026 tables are not really seats in a restaurant, but just outdoor tables and chairs, so there is no such thing as a superior or inferior seat.For the sake of convenience, let\u2019s say the one in the back is the superior seat.Since I\u2019m also a mob character, I try to follow Hanagishi and Ikura.However, there was a girl who interrupted me and prevented me from doing so.Of course, it was the main heroine, Shiho Shimotsuki.\u201cI\u2019d like you to wait for a moment \u2026\u2026 before you sit down.\u201dShe\u2019s picking at my clothes a bit with an impatient look on her face.I\u2019d like to sit down as soon as possible because I\u2019ve already \u2026\u2026 got a bowl of curry and rice in my hand.\u201cPlease, Nakayama-kun. \u2026\u2026 At times like this, that person always comes to sit next to me, so let me use Nakayama-kun as a barrier?\u201d\u2026\u2026 Oh, I see.The main heroine does not like to sit next to the protagonist.It is true that if the seat is to be decided naturally, it will be as it should be.However, Shimotsuki was resisting that fate.\u201cHere, sit down too, Ryoma Onii-chan. Let\u2019s eat together.\u201dIn the meantime, the protagonist who had been serving the food finally arrived.Then, Azusa, who was one step ahead of the other sub-heroines, was the first to try to get a seat next to RyuzakiAzusa sits next to Hanagishi and pulls Ryuzaki next to her.\u201cHey, don\u2019t drag me. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll sit down even if you don\u2019t tell me to.\u201dRyuzaki chuckled as usual and sat down as he was prompted. Next to him, of course, sat Azusa.However, there was still a seat next to him on the other side, so Kirari took that seat.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll sit on this side ~\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026.When I was putting away the dishes, I couldn\u2019t sit next to Ryoma\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s not fair.\u201dWith Azusa on the right and Kirari on the left, there was only one seat left for Yuuki to sit in, directly across from him. She sighed and sat down facing Ryuzaki.And well, Shimotsuki was relieved as the subheroine filled the surrounding area like this.\u201cPhew, that was good\u2026\u2026. Well, Nakayama-kun, why don\u2019t you sit down?\u201dPrompted, next to Yuzuki.No, but \u2026\u2026 please remember carefully. Now, the seats look like this.Hanagishi, Azusa, Ryuzaki, Kirari.Ikura, vacant, Yuuki, vacant.Yes, the seat next to Ikura is vacant, so if we think in terms of character, I should be able to fit in there.But Shimotsuki didn\u2019t want to do that.\u201c\u2026 Do you really want to eat your meal with the cute face of your stepsister Nakayama in front of you? No, you can\u2019t do that!\u201dBy the way, this girl had a yandere temperament.She doesn\u2019t show any signs of it at all because I never talked to other girls, but it\u2019s a little scary because it comes on unexpectedly.Of course, I couldn\u2019t say no, so the seating ended up like this.Hanagishi, Azusa, Ryuzaki, Kirari.Ikura, vacant, Yuzuki, Shimotsuki, and me.\u2026\u2026 The seat next to Ikura\u2019s is empty.It\u2019s not natural, so the members of the group are glancing at me.Among them, Ryuzaki\u2019s gaze was particularly striking.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Hey, Nakayama? You must be lonely if you\u2019re at the end of the line. There\u2019s a seat available over here, so come on over.\u201dHe\u2019s wary of me.He finds it annoying that the main heroine is always messing around with the mob character.\u201cI\u2019m sure Shiho finds it annoying too. It\u2019s rude to forcefully approach a weak-minded girl. \u2026\u2026 Come on. If you don\u2019t like it, you have to say so.\u201dIn Ryuzaki\u2019s mind, I probably forced myself to sit next to Shimotsuki. That\u2019s why he has been lecturing me, which is the protagonist\u2019s specialty.The protagonist is usually kind, but sometimes he can be harsh. The heroine\u2019s cheeks blush as she thinks, \u201cHe\u2019s really thinking about me, isn\u2019t he?\u201d.But apparently, this time the \u201cpromise\u201d didn\u2019t flow that way.Because Shimotsuki seemed to be \u2026\u2026 very uncomfortable.\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u2013For the first time, I think.It was the first time I had seen her respond to a serious question.Usually, she would either cover her ears to avoid hearing Ryuzaki\u2019s sounds, or she would just reply with a few words when he spoke to her.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for him to annoy me.\u201dThe second sentence was spoken.Her normally expressionless face was clearly unhappy. Her lips were tightly pressed together and she was staring at Ryuzaki as if she was glaring at him.That\u2019s how much Shimotsuki couldn\u2019t forgive him for what he just said.I\u2019m sure she really cares about me.\u2013Annoyance is not a joke.It\u2019s a straightforward attitude, as if to assert that.In response to this, Ryuuzaki was very upset \u2026\u2026.\u201cWell, if you want \u2026\u2026 Shiho, that\u2019s fine\u2026\u2026. Well, I\u2019m sorry? I might have misunderstood you.\u201dRyuzaki smiles sluggishly, sweating unpleasantly.Clearly, that guy was being pushed into a corner.Now, hardship was coming to the protagonist.\u2026\u2026 Normally, I might have looked at that and thought, \u201cSuck it up.\u201dIt would have been a dark feeling inside me.But I couldn\u2019t think of that now.Because this is just a \u201cvalley\u201d to create a peak of the story.It happens all the time.In order to emphasize the most exciting scene at the end of the story, it is a common practice to put the main character in a tight spot right before it.The protagonist and the main heroine have a falling out, which raises the reader\u2019s sense of danger by flashing a red light on their relationship.But that\u2019s just a prelude.It\u2019s all just a preview for the big comeback that the protagonist will make.Have we finally reached this point?The story is finally coming to an end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is the curry good? I\u2019m pretty confident about it.\u201dRyuzaki, who was rejected by Shimotsuki earlier, is trying his best to get her attention.Although they are a little apart, he is trying his best to talk to her.But she just keeps responding in a casual manner.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Yes, it is.\u201dShe nodded and took a small mouthful of curry.It was delicious, but I remembered that her mother was a very good cook.Whenever we ate \u2026\u2026 lunch together, Shimotsuki would share her side dishes with me, and the taste of the food was incredible.Even an amateur can tell that Shimotsuki\u2019s mother is a very good cook.Compared to that, Ryuzaki\u2019s and Yuzuki\u2019s cooking is not so good. Of course, this curry is delicious to me, but the reason why Shimotsuki doesn\u2019t move her expression much is because she knows the taste of a better curry.Her interest is clearly not in cooking.Shimotsuki\u2019s interest was, how can I put it, \u2026\u2026 quite a bit of it was focused on me.I\u2019m embarrassed to say it myself, but I have to say it.Because she\u2019s been messing with me frequently since a while ago.\u201c\u2026!?\u201dI shook my body with a jolt.I was suddenly poked in the side of my head, and my body almost jumped reflexively.\u201cUfufu \u266a\u201dEven though she is a high school student, she can do things like an elementary school student and look so happy about it\u2026\u2026. She must really want to be noticed.Fortunately, my voice didn\u2019t come out, so I thought no one would notice,\u2026\u2026 but Ryuzaki was looking right at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah?\u201dOh, no.He looked as if his soul had been drained by the shock.In a state of abandonment, Ryuzaki had dropped the spoon he was holding.Ryuzaki must be despairing in his heart.His cute childhood friend, whom he thought was his only, is opening up to another man, and laughing at him.Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy has become quite a hard act to follow.It\u2019s a development that is sure to stir up controversy among readers.(TLN: Damn right.)The purity of the heroine is an important factor in gaining popularity. In this respect, Shimotsuki, who cheats on her lover with another man, is disqualified as a heroine.However, not all heroines of romantic comedies love only the protagonist. In some cases, the protagonist and the main heroine both like different people.It\u2019s not strange that Ryuzaki would make a comeback from here.That\u2019s why I was worried.It would be nice if he would simply give up here\u2026\u2026. No, how could he?There is no way that a person who can be broken down like this can be a protagonist.I\u2019m sure Ryuzaki will struggle from here.If he takes the high road, he will get Shimotsuki back from me, get another heroine, and later on, Shimotsuki will say, \u201cI don\u2019t deserve to be loved by you, but thank you for loving me.\u201d to tickle the protagonist\u2019s desire for approval.I\u2019m sure that readers who enjoy Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy also have a lot of hate for Shimotsuki, who once loved another man. As a punishment to get rid of it, she has to accept Ryuzaki\u2019s dating other girls \u2013 and if that happens, the harem may become more convincing.Such a scenario popped into my mind.My turn is not over yet. \u2026\u2026 The longer it goes on, the more I\u2019m afraid that the protagonist will awaken in reaction.At that time, Ryuzaki will surely become a monster beyond my imagination.There is no more terrifying existence than a completed harem protagonist.Everything will be taken care of with expediency, problems will be solved in a way that suits the protagonist, everything will be a favorable wind for the protagonist, and the ending will be one of happiness.And the one that the protagonist sees as a danger is me, a mob character.\u3000 There\u2019s no way I can stand up to him\u2026\u2026. What will become of this character, me?I was really afraid of that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t think any of my classmates would remember how I played.That\u2019s what I thought.\u201cI can\u2019t. My stomach hurts. Nakayama-kun, didn\u2019t you say, \u201cGuhe.\u201d when you were hit? I was listening to you correctly, you know. I\u2019ve been laughing my ass off about it for a while now.\u201dShimotsuki seemed to have been watching it perfectly.Something seemed to have hit the nail on the head, and she was laughing hysterically.It seemed to be very funny to her.I don\u2019t know what to say. \u2026\u2026 This girl really watches me closely.I think that\u2019s why she can notice the funny parts and laugh heartily at them.\u201cOh, I laughed\u2026\u2026. It kind of cheered me up.\u201dIn the shade of a tree in the corner of the square, Shimotsuki is leaning against a tree.It was mid-June, and the rainy season was about to end. The weather was very nice today, so she was trying to avoid getting sunburned. She was wearing a jersey jacket the whole time.I guess it\u2019s just too hot. Her cheeks were reddening faintly.\u201cHmm \u2026 I\u2019m going to try my best to play dodgeball, since Nakayama-kun made me laugh a lot. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see. I\u2019m going to teach Nakayama-kun, who was terrible at it, how to play dodgeball.\u201dWhen the boys finished, it was the turn of the girls\u2019 team, and Shimotsuki stood up with vigor. I\u2019m not sure where this baseless confidence is coming from\u2026\u2026, but I\u2019m sure you can guess what she\u2019s capable of.\u201cHigi!\u201dIt was right after the dodgeball game started.I thought Shimotsuki walked sideways like a crab with a nimble step, but the ball hit her in the face as hard as it could and blew her away.\u201cShiho!?\u201dIt was such a catastrophe that Ryuzaki, who was watching, shouted out.I was watching from the side, and I was puzzled. It\u2019s not a laughing matter\u2026\u2026, but I wonder if she\u2019ll be okay.The shade of the trees in the corner was a little far from the area where the competition was taking place.As I watched her with narrowed eyes, she came out of the area, half-crying. She seemed to have been knocked out by one ball.\u201cWell, Shiho? Here, towel \u2026\u2026, are you hurt?As expected of the protagonist. He quickly rushes to the main heroine\u2019s rescue and tries to help her.But she walked straight to me first, of course.It\u2019s as if she didn\u2019t even see Ryuzaki\u2026\u2026.\u201cWait, Shiho \u2026\u2026?\u201dShimotsuki didn\u2019t seem to hear him when he called out to her, crying her eyes out.It\u2019s not Ryuzaki that she\u2019s looking for now.\u201cUgh \u2026\u2026, Nakayama-kun? Where are you? Please answer me. I got hit on the front of my nose, so I can\u2019t see anything through my tears\u2026\u2026. So, will you comfort me a lot? If you can, will you also stroke my head and say \u2018Pain, pain, go away\u2019 like my dad does to my mom?\u201dI was the one who asked for it.And it\u2019s a lot more demanding and a little too hard.Well, \u2026\u2026 you are spoiled to your heart\u2019s content.Originally, this position would have been held by Ryuzaki.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Damn.\u201dFrom a little distance away, he was glaring at me in frustration.The obvious hostility in his gaze made me feel uncomfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Um, do I have to do that \u2026\u2026 thing~?\u201dCould it be that this girl is really in elementary school?The infantilized Shimotsuki is a handful. I was embarrassed to do that.\u201cMmm, Nakayama-kun is such a cheapskate\u2026\u2026 You could at least give me a pat on the back. So, will you support me? Will you tell me to do my best?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s about it. \u2026.. Um, hang in there. Shimotsuki, don\u2019t let the pain get to you.\u201dWhat the hell am I being made to do?I doubted that cheering her up would have any effect, but I was surprised when Shimotsuki stopped crying as soon as I cheered her up.\u201cWhew, \u2026\u2026 I feel calmer now. I was in pain earlier and felt like I was going to die, but Nakayama-kun cheered me on and I was able to endure it. Am I getting stronger again? Oh no, I didn\u2019t want to get any stronger.\u201dNo, Shimotsuki is weak. She\u2019s probably close to the weakest, so don\u2019t worry.As usual, she is a clunker. I think she caught the ball in her face because she is not good at sports.Even so, she was blown away a lot. Thanks to this, her jacket was dirty and her face was covered with dust.\u201cYour face and clothes are dirty. Do you have a change of clothes?\u201dWhen I asked her, Shimotsuki smiled and shook her head.\u201cI don\u2019t have any. So can you lend me a towel and a jersey? I told you before that I\u2019m sensitive to the sun and need to wear long sleeves, didn\u2019t I? If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m sure my friend Nakayama-kun wouldn\u2019t refuse.\u201dIt seems that she decided to rob me.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What if I told you I was sweating a little and would prefer to decline if possible?\u201d\u201cNo? It\u2019s a refusal to say no.\u201dIt seems she\u2019s already decided to take it from me. She took off her dirty jersey, exposing her pure white arms.They were really white, probably because they hadn\u2019t been exposed to the sun at all. I couldn\u2019t help but look away from her because she looked so innocent.Maybe it was because they were usually hidden, but I felt a little nervous.I felt like it would be a bad idea to leave her exposed.So, I had no choice but to take off my jersey.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Here you go.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dI held it out to her, and she snatched it from me.Then, with a mischievous smile, she pulled it on and zipped it up tightly.Since she\u2019s small by nature, my jersey was too big for her. It was as long as a dress. The sleeves were so long that they could be folded over.I think it would be better to get a jersey that fits a little better.Maybe the teachers have a spare one, shall I check? I was about to ask \u2026\u2026\u201cHehehe~. Nakayama-kun\u2019s clothes smell like \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-kun. I think it\u2019s not bad at all, Kun Kun. No, it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s even better\u2026\u2026. My mom also has a smell fetish, and I think I finally understand her feelings.\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t say anything, because Shimotsuki looked so satisfied.She continues to tickle my fancy.\u201cHere, can I borrow your towel too? My towel is dirty and needs to be washed\u2026\u2026. Yes, if I don\u2019t wrap it around my neck, I\u2019ll get sunburned. But when I\u2019m like this, it\u2019s like I\u2019m being hugged by Nakayama-kun, and it makes me kind of nervous\u266a\u201dNow, Shimotsuki\u2019s cheeks are red, is it because of a sunburn?Or maybe she\u2019s \u2026\u2026 embarrassed?\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhen I see that side of her, I still get nervous.I really wonder why this girl is so cute.And \u2026\u2026 what is Ryuuzaki thinking as he stares at this scene?(He\u2019s been staring at me since a while ago\u2026\u2026. Give me a break!)Shimotsuki still didn\u2019t notice, but from my angle, I could see Ryuzaki.He was looking at me and Shimotsuki from a distance with a face that looked like it was about to cry.Right in front of him, the girl he likes is flirting with another man\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m sure his heart is torn up inside.It seems that the story is still getting ready to enter its climax.It seems that Ryuzaki\u2019s suffering will continue for a little while longer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that she really wanted to be entertained.Ryuzaki kept his eyes on Shimotsuki. He occasionally checked on her, but he never took his eyes off her, not even for a moment.He must be in a lot of conflict and anguish. Hopefully, he will stay as he is for a long time, but since he is the \u2026\u2026 protagonist, that is not possible.When will he start his big comeback?I\u2019ve been on the lookout for it.However, the time did not come easily.It was now nighttime. There were only two things left on the schedule for today.A test of courage and a campfire.It was the perfect event to set the story in motion.\u201d \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-kun, I\u2019m a little bit not good with ghosts, so I\u2019m just going to pretend I\u2019m not feeling well and rest. Are the teachers insane to make us walk through the woods at night like this? It\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of them, you know. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m not very good at it.\u201dThat said, Shimotsuki cheated on her test of courage.\u2026\u2026 I wonder if that girl is the main heroine.A test of courage is a great place for a heroine to be active.She can hug the protagonist while saying, \u201cOoh, I\u2019m scared.\u201d and close the distance between them both physically and mentally while having a romantic encounter.But for Shimotsuki, who has already deviated from the main route and is heading for the outer route, such a promise would have no effect. She is tearing up her story as she pleases.That\u2019s why I decided to test my courage without Shimotsuki.\u201cHey, Ryoma-san, I\u2019m afraid of \u2026\u2026 ghosts, can you stay with me?\u201d\u201cYeah, \u2026\u2026 okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of ghosts either, but don\u2019t ever leave me!\u201d\u201cYeah, \u2026\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ryoma Onii-chan, help me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, the Ryuzaki harem was trying to flirt with the protagonist as much as they could.However, it was unlikely to be a meaningful event because Ryuzaki himself was not paying attention.I\u2019m sure his mind was full of thoughts about Shimotsuki.No matter what Azusa and the others do to him, he doesn\u2019t react well.\u201cRyoma Onii-chan \u2026?\u201dAzusa and the others are also looking at Ryuzaki with a worried look.As expected, even the harem members seemed to have noticed that something was wrong with Ryuzaki.So, the test of courage event ended easily without much excitement.Finally, there was a campfire, but \u2026\u2026 before that, the protagonist started talking to me, a mob character.It\u2019s almost the end of the story. \u2026\u2026 Normally, a mob character should have finished his role by now. But the protagonist seemed to have something to say to me.\u201cNakayama \u2026\u2026, when did you and Shiho started getting along?\u201dAfter the test of courage, the executive officers of the overnight learning program were preparing for the campfire.I was bored, so I was sitting in an inconspicuous position, when Ryuuzaki unexpectedly came to talk to me.This is the place where I spent noon with Shimotsuki at the recreational event. She seems to be good at finding inconspicuous places, and this is a pretty good place.In addition, I\u2019m not much of a standout, so it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll just happen to see me and talk to me \u2026\u2026. Perhaps Ryuzaki had taken the trouble to look for me.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen Shiho look so happy\u2026\u2026, even though she was not interested in others. She\u2019s always alone, and she doesn\u2019t even get along with me because she likes it that way\u2026\u2026. What the hell did you do to her?\u201dI wonder if he\u2019s really cornered.The protagonist is groaning.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOn the other hand, I didn\u2019t know what to say.As usual, I wanted to say something like a biting dog mob character, but I couldn\u2019t think of any words.But I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, because it was impossible for a mob character to be involved in such an important scene.\u201cHey, say something\u2026\u2026 You got to be friends with my childhood friend.\u3000You\u2019re the only one who can see the smile on her face\u2026\u2026. You should be more proud of yourself. Mock me for being a loser despite being a childhood friend!\u201dRyuzaki was sneering and spitting out his emotions.I, on the other hand, could only stare at him blankly.I wondered if I should agitate him.Should I make fun of him?Should I deny him?Should I deceive him?Should I affirm it?Various options are whirling around in my mind.But I can\u2019t see the way forward. I don\u2019t know which answer is the right one.I guess this is the limit of a mob character.Up until now, I\u2019ve managed to keep my head down, but \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t have the power to change the narrative. I just happened to be on the playing board at the whim of Shimotsuki.As such, I couldn\u2019t think of any way to deal with this protagonist.If I had to choose something more than this, I would no longer be a mob character.The clown who had once mistakenly thought he was the protagonist was supposed to have given up everything by pretending that he was a mob character.When he was betrayed by his childhood friend, his stepsister, his best friend, and all the people he loved, this was the reason why he desperately wanted to convince himself somehow.\u201cI\u2019m a mob character, so what can I do?\u201dSince then, I\u2019ve been telling myself that I can\u2019t be the protagonist because I\u2019m a mob character.\u201cDamn\u2026\u2026, no words for a loser? You don\u2019t even have me in your sights anymore, do you? I feel like a fool for being satisfied with the childhood friend I had \u2026..\u201dRyuzaki\u2019s wailing disappeared into the night forest.He punched a tree trunk in frustration and then walked away.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, I couldn\u2019t say anything.After all \u2026\u2026, Kotaro Nakayama is a mob character.If I had been able to say something back to Ryuzaki here, I might have been able to intervene in the story.It is possible that I could have broken out of my shell as a mob character and become something else.But if I had been able to do that, I probably wouldn\u2019t have become a mob character in the first place.\u201cYou\u2019re a loser\u2026\u2026, you say that a lot.\u201dAs I look out at the forest where Ryuzaki disappeared, I can\u2019t help but remember the past.\u201cThe loser is not you, it\u2019s \u2026\u2026 me.\u201dI used to think that I was the protagonist, that I was the one at that time\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For the next three years, I spent time with Azusa as if we were real siblings.So the three of them were very special to me.I had such \u2026\u2026 special feelings for them that I was sure that one of them would be my life partner in the future and we would spend the rest of our lives together.I was close to three such attractive people.It\u2019s an unusual fortune.I\u2019m sure I could be mistaken for the protagonist\u2013and I think I could be.It\u2019s not that there was anything special about the three of them.Yuzuki just happened to live in my neighborhood, Kirari just happened to be my classmate, and Azusa just happened to be the child of someone my mother remarried.There was no fateful encounter, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that the three of them were special. And I thought that the three of them must have seen me as special, too.But that was my mistake.(TLN: OMG FINALLY!???)It wasn\u2019t \u201cfate\u201d that brought me together with these girls, it was just a coincidence.It seems that to them, I was just a stranger.In other words, I was the only one who had special feelings for them.At the entrance ceremony of the high school, the moment the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki, the harem protagonist, began, I realized my mistake.Congratulations, the three of them had been discovered by Ryoma Ryuzaki.They met him, and for the first time, they met the \u201creal\u201d protagonist.And at the same time, they realized.They realized that I was the first \u201cprotagonist\u201d.\u201cOnii-chan \u2026 Well, maybe Azusa\u2019s real Onii-chan might be Ryoma Onii-chan.\u201dThat\u2019s what my stepsister told me, and I lost the significance of being a brother.\u201cKotaro-san \u2026\u2026 I think I may have met my destiny. For the first time, I\u2019ve met someone I want to give my all to.\u201dThat\u2019s what my childhood friend told me, and I was no longer even a good friend of hers. She became obsessed with Ryuzaki and eventually started to forget about me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ko-kun. There\u2019s someone I\u2019ve fallen in love with. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make him like me\u2026\u2026. Even if it kills the me I\u2019ve always been, I want to be the person he likes.\u201dMy best friend Kirari sacrificed even her own personality to be liked by Ryuzaki. She dyed her hair, put in colored contacts, changed her tone of voice, and twisted her personality.She was no longer Kirari Asakura, my best friend. She became Asakura-san, a complete stranger.In other words, I lost the three people who were special to me at the same time.It was an unbelievable fall for the protagonist.It\u2019s a cruel ending, even for the sake of the story.\u2026\u2026 I was not really in love with them.If I had to say whether I liked them or not, I liked them, but I didn\u2019t have any ulterior motives for them or anything like that.I didn\u2019t think of them as special because they were girls, because they were cute, or because I wanted to go out with them.It was just that they were important to me and I felt special.I wanted to get to know them better if I could.If I may be so bold as to say that it would be ideal if I could go out with any one of the three \u2026\u2026 people.However, in the worst case scenario, if they marry someone who isn\u2019t \u2026\u2026 me, that\u2019s fine, as long as they\u2019re happy.However, even having such thoughts seemed to be a hindrance to the girls\u2026\u2026, and my existence has been painted with the color of Ryuzaki.It\u2019s not possible to be the protagonist like this.That\u2019s why I thought of myself like this.I\u2019m like a mob character.When I thought about it that way, I felt a lot better.I was hurt because I had mistakenly thought I was the protagonist, but once I accepted that I was a mob character, I was able to relax.Even if I was betrayed, disappointed, or had my expectations lowered, it was all inevitable.Because I\u2019m a mob character, it\u2019s only natural.That\u2019s how I came to recognize myself as a mob character.I\u2019ve come to think of everything from a meta perspective, and I\u2019ve forced myself to accept my lack of rewards.But if I\u2019m being honest, \u2026\u2026 I wanted to be a protagonist, too.I didn\u2019t become a mob character because I wanted to.Ryuzaki\u2026\u2026, so you\u2019re not a loser.The loser is me.The pathetic mob character who mistook himself for the protagonist, if not a loser?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had finally ignited, and there was a cheerful roar of excitement.Ryuzaki was not in the place where the light was.The protagonist is still hiding in the shadows.The one who will give him a helping hand is probably \u2026\u2026 her.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I guess Ryoma Onii-chan didn\u2019t know, after all.\u201dIt was my stepsister, Azusa, who popped up from the shadows.Apparently, she was listening in on the conversation between me and Ryuzaki.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop\u2026\u2026 But I saw that Ryoma was acting strange, so I kept an eye on him. Then suddenly the two of you started talking\u2026\u2026. I ended up listening in.\u201dShe looked apologetic, but this was an unavoidable consequence of the situation.And \u2026\u2026 in the story, Azusa had to know about Ryuzaki\u2019s agony.This is because the subheroines are the only ones who can save the protagonist.They are always willing to draw the short straw.They are always willing to sacrifice themselves to make the people they love happy.This is the reason why \u2026\u2026 Azusa looked so pained when she thought about Ryuzaki.\u201cRyoma Onii-chan looked like he was going to cry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a face like that before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the face of Ryoma Onii-chan, the man Azusa fell in love with.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cSo, Azusa \u2026\u2026 cannot leave it alone.\u201dIf that\u2019s the case, just go after him.Just ignore me as usual and do what you want.And yet, she\u2019s stomping her feet.She hesitated and looked at me as if she wanted something from me.\u201cBut Onii-chan, \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t muster up the courage.\u201dA trembling voice echoed.Even though she\u2019s a stepsister, the sound of my precious sister\u2019s tears \u2026\u2026 still hurts my heart.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s only at times like this that you go back to being my sister.\u201dIt\u2019s not fair.It\u2019s not fair that you cut me off, saying that I\u2019m not the ideal brother, but only when it\u2019s convenient, you ask for help like that.\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u2026, but this is the last time. Onii-chan, please \u2026\u2026 push me forward? Even though I\u2019m such a useless sister\u2026\u2026, please give me the courage to get hurt\u2026\u2026.\u201dI knew this girl knew what she was talking about.Now she understands \u2026\u2026 that she will be very hurt.This is because Azusa, of all people, \u2026\u2026 is about to confess her feelings to Ryuzaki right now.Even if she told him her feelings at this time, it would definitely fail.This is because Ryuzaki is preoccupied with Shimotsuki and is hurting from the loss of his childhood friend, but Azusa can not tolerate Ryuzaki, who is in pain\u2026This is why she is trying to heal Ryuzaki with a drug called \u201cconfession\u201d.I\u2019m sure Azusa thinks it\u2019s okay if she gets rejected as a result\u2026\u2026.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 If that is the path Azusa has chosen.\u201dAs a brother, I want to stop it.I don\u2019t want my precious little sister to get hurt.But this is the path that she has chosen.That\u2019s what it means to fall in love with Ryoma Ryuzaki, the \u2026\u2026 harem-minded protagonist.So there\u2019s only one thing I can do.\u201cGood luck. Azusa was my cute little sister, so \u2026\u2026 it\u2019s okay. If it\u2019s Azusa, maybe Ryuzaki will be okay with it? Because Azusa is cute.\u201dI gave her the best I could, which was only comforting.But family is a strange thing. \u2026\u2026 Even casual words can make your heart feel lighter than you imagined.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes, thank you. You\u2019re right, Azusa is cute. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dThen, Azusa smiled.It had been a long time since I had seen a friendly smile up close, and it was still cute.\u201cYes, \u2026\u2026, well, if you can, please don\u2019t watch Azusa shatter herself, okay? I think it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t see \u2026\u2026 I think it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t look at \u2026\u2026. Because Onii-chan is kind \u2026\u2026.\u201dBut the smile instantly clouded over, and a dry smile of empty energy stuck to it.It\u2019s the kind of look I don\u2019t like from Azusa.\u201cThen, I\u2019m off.\u201dThen, Azusa followed after Ryuzaki.The little back was walking slowly, as if it wanted me to follow it, despite the words.\u2026\u2026 Oh, I get it.Azusa, Onii-chan is watching you.So, do your best\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You weren\u2019t looking well, so I chased after you. Did that \u2026\u2026 something happen to you?\u201dI had to hide myself from view a little farther away to get a better look.Ryuzaki was still nodding off with a pathetic look on his face, even though Azusa had come to see him.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing, is it?\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s nothing!\u201dI guess he has no room in his heart. Ryuzaki, who is usually kind to the sub-heroines, is yelling at her.It seems that the sound of a man yelling is more frightening to women and children than we can imagine.But Azusa was unfazed as she stared at Ryuzaki.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ryoma Onii-chan, you look very uncool right now.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dAzusa\u2019s voice was firm and strong.Ryuzaki glared at her in anger, but Azusa did not flinch at all.\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Shimotsuki-san doesn\u2019t like you when you look like that.\u201dRyuzaki was severely unnerved by these words.\u201cWhy are you talking about Shiho \u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI know, I know. I didn\u2019t need to be told that Ryoma Onii-chan was in love with Shimotsuki-san, I was aware of it. Because Azusa had been looking at Ryoma Onii-chan for a long time, you know? You\u2019ve been thinking about her all the time. How can I not understand~!\u201dAnd finally, it began.The biggest and saddest scene of the sub-heroines opens now \u2026\u2026.\u201cBecause Azusa loves Ryoma Onii-chan.\u201d\u2013At last, Azusa confessed.Even the most insensitive of protagonists would not be able to misunderstand something when it is said so clearly.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What? What did you say?\u201dBut then again, \u2026\u2026 the protagonist also had the skill of hearing loss.Thanks to this, he can trample on the affections of the sub-heroines without them noticing his thoughts.But that skill seems to be useless now.\u201cI said I love you \u2026\u2026, not as a friend, of course. I love you as a boy. I want to spend all my time with you, Ryoma Onii-chan. I want to go on dates with you, I want to touch you, I want you to touch me, and I want to make out with you. I want you to give me everything you have. That\u2019s how much I love you!\u201dWithout the slightest room for doubt, Azusa blurted out her feelings of \u201cI love you\u201d.Even the most insensitive of protagonists can\u2019t pretend not to notice when someone says something like that.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh, you\u2019re kidding, right? I can\u2019t believe \u2026\u2026 Azusa likes me. \u2026\u2026 You must be joking, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious. I love you, Ryoma Onii-chan. \u2026\u2026 If you can\u2019t hear me, I\u2019ll tell you as many times as you want. If you don\u2019t believe me, I can give you a hundred reasons why I like you. So, believe me, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not kidding, listen to me. Accept Azusa\u2019s feelings. \u2026\u2026 Let me at least say I love you!\u201dAzusa\u2019s pure feelings echoed in the forest at night.In the distance, I could faintly hear the voices of my classmates. Maybe the campfire is about to start\u2026\u2026. Little by little, it\u2019s getting noisier.On the other hand, things were getting more and more exciting here too.When the protagonist heard Azusa\u2019s words, he slowly raised his head.\u201cSo, it\u2019s true\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to see you now. But I don\u2019t want to see Ryoma Onii-chan\u2019s face right now. \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t want to see his face when he\u2019s whimpering and miserable. Azusa\u2019s favorite Ryoma Onii-chan has a much better face, you know? Even though Azusa tried her best to approach you, you were still trying to look cool by saying, \u201cOh dear.\u201d \u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know how many times I wanted to punch you.\u201d\u2026\u2026 Honestly, I want to cover my ears.I can see where this is going.It\u2019s like a farce. It\u2019s a terrible game, and it\u2019s not even funny.Although she said a lot of things, what Azusa wanted to convey was just one point, \u201cI like Ryuzaki.\u201dAnd Ryuzaki, thanks to being told over and over again, seems to have finally come to realize this.\u201cSo, don\u2019t be depressed, okay? You can still be Azusa\u2019s favorite Ryoma Onii-chan. \u2026\u2026 You love Shimotsuki-san, don\u2019t you? If so, it would be a shame to give up, wouldn\u2019t it? Azusa\u2019s favorite Ryoma Onii-chan is a very weak man, but when he wants to do something \u2026\u2026, he does it.\u201dThat affirmation becomes a medicine.This is a great way to energize the protagonist who has lost his confidence.\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\u2026. I haven\u2019t done anything yet. I haven\u2019t even told Shiho how I feel about her, and it\u2019s \u2026\u2026 disgraceful to give up and slump over.\u201dThe voice of the protagonist, who had been sullen until a moment ago, regained its strength.\u201cIt\u2019s not like this is me. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m much cooler now that Azusa likes me. \u2026\u2026 So, yeah. I\u2019m going to confess properly!\u201dFinally, the time had come.The harem protagonist\u2019s biggest flaw, has been eliminated by the subheroine\u2019s confession.This is the unique \u201cawakening\u201d of the protagonist.No one can stop him now.The story is only going to rise. Every wind that blows from now on will be a tailwind for the protagonist, and he will become the rightful owner of opportunism.\u201cAzusa\u2026\u2026Thank you for loving me like this. I\u2019ll try my best to be the Ryoma Ryuzaki that you love.\u201d\u201cYeah \u2026 I love the cool Ryoma Onii-chan the most.\u201dAnd once awakened, the subheroine is no longer \u2018useful\u2019.\u201c\u2026 But I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t accept \u2026\u2026 Azusa\u2019s confession because I have someone I like.\u201dAnd so, Azusa was rejected.Even though she had tried so hard to confess, her \u2026\u2026 feelings were easily trampled upon.This is a natural result.There was no way she could confess to Ryuzaki, who was troubled about Shimotsuki, and have him accept her confession.Even so, Azusa wanted to cheer up Ryuzaki.Even though she knew she would be rejected \u2026\u2026 and hurt, she kept her \u2018love\u2019 to herself.\u201cI see\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 but it can\u2019t be helped. The campfire is about to start, you know. If you\u2019ve decided to confess your love, you\u2019d better go now. There\u2019s a jinx that says if you confess your love at the campfire, you\u2019ll succeed.\u201d\u201cReally? If that\u2019s true, then \u2026\u2026 it\u2019s good timing. Thank you for letting me know. Azusa, you\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d\u2013It is a sin to be insensitive.It\u2019s \u2026\u2026 very cruel to hurt someone so easily without malice.I think Azusa had reached her limit.\u201cYes, yes. Then hurry up and go! Make sure you tell her how you feel\u2026\u2026 Bye bye, Ryoma Onii-chan.\u201dShe pushed Ryuzaki\u2019s back and made him go to the square.\u201cHey, okay, you don\u2019t have to push \u2026\u2026, I\u2019ll go. Totally \u2026\u2026 Azusa loves to touch me, doesn\u2019t she? I\u2019m glad you did, thank you \u2026\u2026 so I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dAnd then Ryuzaki left the place.At that moment, Azusa slumped down as if she had lost her mind.\u201cHey, Onii-chan? You\u2019re here anyway, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m here.\u201dShe called out to me, so I showed my face.But she didn\u2019t look at me, she turned her head down.The sight was so painful that it \u2026\u2026 made my heart ache.\u201cAzusa, you did your best, right? You don\u2019t have to hold back anymore, do you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes. No need to hold back anymore. Azusa is a strong girl.\u201dI hope it makes her feel better. I know it\u2019s naive of me to think that, but I can\u2019t help but say kind words to her.My stepsister, who once cut me off, \u2026\u2026 is still family to me.She was in too much pain to look at her now.\u201cUhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!\u201dImmediately, Azusa began to cry.She did not wipe her tears, but continued to cry painfully, shedding large tears.\u201cI loved you so much. \u2026\u2026 This was my first love\u2026why won\u2019t you love me back, Ryoma Onii-chan? I loved you so much, so much\u2026\u2026!!\u201dThere was nothing I could do about the sad wailing.The only thing I could do was to be there for her.We were no longer close enough for me to hug her.The truth is, of course I want to comfort her. I want to comfort Azusa, who is in pain.But I can\u2019t do that.I could not, and would not, be the ideal Onii-chan that Azusa envisioned, so I have no right to \u2026\u2026 hug her.This is the result of the choices that Azusa has made.Now, the only person who can comfort Azusa is \u2026\u2026 her acknowledged \u201creal Onii-chan\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll meet again someday, if \u2026\u2026 Azusa is a good girl.\u201dSomewhere in her heart, she must have understood that her brother was dead.But she refused to acknowledge it. She stubbornly continued to wait for her brother\u2019s return.Even as a high school student, she still wore her hair in twin tails, as she did in elementary school, probably to make her brother recognize her.Then one day, \u2026\u2026 Azusa\u2019s father decided to remarry. The other person had a stepson, a boy.That\u2019s me.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Are you my Onii-chan?\u201dI still vividly remember the first time I met her.I was in the first year of junior high school at the time, and I too was confused by the sudden arrival of a family member my age.So, I couldn\u2019t really think about her question.I asked her when her birthday was, because I thought it would determine if she was my older or younger sibling \u2026\u2026.And she shook her head, because mine was slightly earlier.\u201cYeah, I guess you could say I\u2019m your Onii-chan.\u201dWhen I told her that, Azusa instantly started to cry.\u201cGusuu \u2026 I\u2019ve been waiting for you all this time.\u00a0Welcome back, Onii-chan! \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do with my stepsister who hugged me while saying that.It was right after that that I heard everything from her father.\u201cAzusa has been waiting for her brother\u2019s return.\u201dI thought I knew that.She knew that she would never see him again, but she pretended not to notice and put her brother\u2019s image on mine.But I couldn\u2019t stand to see Azusa like that, so \u2026\u2026 I pretended to be her brother.At the time, I didn\u2019t think of myself as a mob character, so I was proud that I could save Azusa.Thus, even though we were the same age, we started to spend time together as brother and sister.When we first became brother and sister, Azusa seemed to be very happy every day. She walked behind me all the time and crawled into my bed at night.To be honest, I was happy.I couldn\u2019t help but think how cute my little sister was, how much she missed me.If she wanted, I could be her \u201cOnii-chan\u201d forever.I loved Azusa so much that I even thought about it.But it seems that I was the only one who thought so.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dIf I think back, I think Azusa had a puzzled look on her face even then.She suddenly looked at me and tilted her head, \u201cHuh?\u201dIt was as if she had realized that I was not the \u201cOnii-chan\u201d who she was waiting for to come home.The feeling of discomfort must have been getting stronger day by day.And finally, on the day of the entrance ceremony, \u2026\u2026 she met that guy.Ryoma Ryuzaki.At first glance, Azusa seems to have realized that I am a fake.Because Ryuzaki looks a lot like Azusa\u2019s own brother.I was surprised when I saw the album. I wondered if there was anyone in the world who looked so much like him.In other words, she had finally found her \u201cideal Onii-chan\u201d.Ryuzaki, who resembled her own brother, had instantly stolen her heart.And I, who was a failure, was cut down.\u201cAzusa\u2019s real Onii-chan might be Ryoma Onii-chan.\u201dThe parting words were abrupt.I lost my precious sister before I had a chance to sort out my feelings.Because she wanted Ryuzaki to look back at her, she only talked to me inside the house and called me \u201cNakayama-kun\u201d outside. I was only her brother in the family register, and I could only act as her brother in the limited situation of inside the house, and I became distant from Azusa.Throwing everything away, Azusa single-mindedly pursued Ryuzaki.Eventually, her thoughts turned to love as a member of the opposite sex instead of love for her brother \u2026\u2026 and this completed her as a harem member.She really is the epitome of a subheroine.As a subheroine, she loved Ryuzaki, as a subheroine, she devoted herself to Ryuzaki, as a subheroine, she encouraged Ryuzaki, and as a subheroine, she fell in vain.It was an utterly \u2026\u2026 disgusting romantic comedy.In the end, what did she get out of it?Did you get the \u201cideal Onii-chan\u201d you\u2019ve been seeking with all your heart?Azusa\u2026\u2026 you didn\u2019t get any reward.You just fell down hurt, crying, and in pain.It really was painful to watch\u2014\u201cHigu, Ugu \u2026 Ua\u201dShe is still crying after being rejected by Ryuzaki.Azusa\u2019s sobbing voice was echoing in the forest at night.I can\u2019t hug her like that.I\u2019ve been disqualified from being her big brother, and I\u2019m now just her older brother in the family register.I\u2019m not even related to her by blood, and I\u2019m almost a stranger to her out there.It\u2019s impossible for me to comfort her or heal her.Azusa has gone beyond my reach.But \u2026\u2026, family is still family.There is an inseparable bond with this girl.That\u2019s why I tend to be lenient with her.\u201c\u2026\u2026I know it\u2019s very, very painful right now.\u201dI send words to the sobbing girl.It was a shout out from me, as much as I could.\u201cAzusa will be able to get over this pain. You\u2019ll be able to think about things from a different perspective when you do\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\u2013You\u2019re not done yet.\u2013Get up.\u2013Use the pain and sorrow as sustenance and take a leap forward.That is the only way for Azusa to be happy.The only way for a subheroine who loves a harem protagonist to be rewarded is to overcome a lot of pain, compromise, and accept.If you don\u2019t like it, give up.I want you to be a normal girl, fall in love with a normal boy, and be satisfied with normal happiness.However, Azusa is a girl who is not satisfied with such \u201cnormal\u201d.I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get over this pain.\u201cGood luck. I\u2019m rooting for you\u2026\u2026. Onii-chan will always be watching over you.\u201d\u201c\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201dI don\u2019t know what Azusa is feeling as she is still crying.Now there\u2019s nothing more I can do.\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go now. When you stop crying, come back.\u201dI gave her a final gentle pat on the shoulder and turned my back on Azusa.This is the end of the story of the subheroine.Whether or not Azusa will be able to come back to the table in the future is up to \u2026\u2026 her.If she does, she will probably have matured and become a stronger subheroine.Maybe she\u2019ll become so attractive that she\u2019ll take the main heroine\u2019s place.Let\u2019s hope so.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Now, what should I do?\u201dFinally, I\u2019m going to have to face it.What should I do about the awakened protagonist?At last, the story comes to a climax\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where have you been? I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201dWhen I returned to the plaza, Ryuzaki spoke to me as if he had been waiting for me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier. I got a little emotional \u2026\u2026 and showed my disgraceful side.\u201dI don\u2019t know if I should apologize. I didn\u2019t have anything to say in response, so I shrugged my shoulders and looked toward the square.The preparations for the campfire must have been finished.A large flame rises from the center of the square wooden structure. The wavering smoke drifted in the wind and disappeared.Everyone was watching the flames.According to the schedule, a light entertainment was to be held after this.There was a simple stage set up in the square where they were going to perform comedy, songs, and dances.Everyone seemed to be in a good mood. It was noisier than usual, and I wanted to cover my ears.Unfortunately, I\u2019m not in the mood to enjoy it.In the first place, I don\u2019t know if I would have enjoyed a campfire under normal circumstances\u2026\u2026, but at least now I wanted to be alone and sleep.When I think of Azusa, I feel like my heart is going to burst.But I can\u2019t let that happen, because this is where the real battle begins.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dI don\u2019t need to play the role of a dog anymore. The relationship between me and Shimotsuki was already known, so I said something emotionless as usual.\u201cYeah, there\u2019s something I want to tell you. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve decided to confess to Shiho. I thought I\u2019d tell you.\u201d\u2026\u2026 Oh, no.I already know, since I was eavesdropping earlier.It\u2019s not like I\u2019m surprised now. So I nodded, expressionless.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026? I was expecting more reaction from you\u2026\u2026. As expected, you can afford it. Do you think you\u2019ve already got Shiho? The game is not over yet.\u201dBut the protagonist is perverse.Without malice, he moves the story in a way that suits him.\u201cIt is true that you and Shiho are good friends. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t jealous. \u2026\u2026 But you haven\u2019t confessed to her yet, have you? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re officially dating, is it? If that\u2019s the case, then there must be a chance for me, too.\u201dRyuuzaki then clenched his fists in an attempt to inspire himself.\u201cYou\u2019ve made me realize something. I was satisfied with just being childhood friends with Shiho. I\u2019ve been thinking that if we could just be next to each other that would be enough, even if we didn\u2019t become lovers. But that\u2019s not good enough\u2026\u2026. No other man would leave a girl as wonderful as Shiho aside.\u201dAs usual, Ryuzaki\u2019s words were self-indulgent.He was not thinking about Shimotsuki in the slightest, he was just looking for a result that would make him feel good.\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m \u2026\u2026 scared to confess. I\u2019m so nervous I think I\u2019m going to throw up\u2026\u2026. There is someone who likes me like this. If you\u2019re a man who can\u2019t confess your love to someone, it\u2019s disrespectful to that person\u2026\u2026. I have to be a cool Ryuzaki Ryoma.\u201dThe protagonist\u2019s monologue is as incomprehensible as ever, and it makes my head hurt.However, I have one question.\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201dI don\u2019t get it.What do you want from this mob character?Do you think I\u2019m going to give you a push?It\u2019s ridiculous\u2026\u2026. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to support you.\u2026\u2026 Well, I\u2019m sure Ryuzaki didn\u2019t mean to say that either.\u201cBecause you\u2019re my rival. This is a declaration of war.\u201dRyuzaki smiled fearlessly and turned his back on me.He seemed to be satisfied with his one-sided conversation.\u201cIt\u2019s more anticlimactic than I thought. I thought you would be more emotional, but Nakayama is a guy I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s boring.\u201dIt seems that the fiery protagonist overestimated his rival.Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Unlike you, I\u2019m a mob character.I\u2019m not in a position to intervene in the story.So, if possible, I don\u2019t want you to get involved in anything, but I can\u2019t say that when I think about \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki.After this, she will be confessed to.Moreover, by a person who is very bad at it, she is told that he likes her.I want to help her somehow.But I can\u2019t stop Ryuzaki from confessing his love to her\u2026\u2026.

There were also some people who didn\u2019t observe the entertainment but instead chatted with their friends or flirted with their loved ones.\u2026\u2026 Indeed, this atmosphere is perfect for a confession.The main light source was the flames of the campfire, and other lighting was minimal and a bit dim\u2026\u2026. Because it was hard to see, the distance between people naturally narrowed. The unusual space gives courage to men and women in love. The unrealistic space may also make the confessor more excited than usual.Analyzing the situation, it seems that the probability of success is higher than confessing on an ordinary day when nothing is going on.It was a situation that convinced me that a jinx had been created.(Maybe Ryuzaki will call Shimotsuki when he confesses\u2026\u2026 But first, I have to find her.)I want to stay close to Shimotsuki for now.I didn\u2019t know what to do, but as long as I could be there, I could always help.If I could do everything in my power to somehow get through Ryuzaki\u2019s confession, that was fine.However, my biggest concern was that the protagonist\u2019s opportunism would be triggered and Shimotsuki would be driven into a corner.I have no idea what kind of convenience will come into play, though.Anyway, I\u2019m afraid that the situation will turn out to be convenient for Ryuzaki. If something happens that twists \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki\u2019s will, which is unlikely, Ryuzaki\u2019s confession might be successful.This is an unrealistic assumption, but since Ryuzaki is the protagonist, I knew that anything could happen.So anyway, I hurried to meet up with Shimotsuki, but even after looking around the square, I couldn\u2019t find her\u2026.(There are quite a lot of blind spots that I can\u2019t see\u2026\u2026.)The visibility is worse than I thought. It is also awkward because there are couples making out everywhere.Her silvery-white hair stands out, so if she were here, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be able to spot her right away\u2026\u2026. Maybe she\u2019s already asleep?If so, that would have been a relief\u2026\u2026, but it seems I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.(Oh, there she is!)I found Shimotsuki just as the entertainment was about to end.I think it was about an hour or so. When the students had finished their performance, I spotted the silver hair in front of the stage.Apparently, Shimotsuki had also come. I wondered if it was a bad time, or if she had just arrived\u2026\u2026. Well, if I could join her, that would be fine.That\u2019s what I thought, and I started walking towards her.But there were so many people in front of the stage that I couldn\u2019t make my way to the front. It took me a while.Meanwhile, she was looking around as if she was looking for someone.And as soon as her eyes met mine, her face lit up and she tried to run over to me\u2026\u2026. Just then, I saw.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the annual \u201cConfession Time\u201d! It seems to have produced many couples so far, so if you are a boy or a girl in love, this is the time to show your courage! Is there anyone out there?\u201dImmediately after the host said that.The person who suddenly came on stage was the protagonist.\u201cI\u2019m Ryoma Ryuzaki, class 1, year 2. There\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been in love with since I was a child. Today, let me confess my love to that person.\u201dWith a microphone in his hand, Ryuzaki spoke up proudly, a look of determination on his face.\u201c\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u201dSuddenly, there was silence.The moment he stepped out onto the stage, I felt the place suddenly quieten down.Everyone\u2019s attention was on Ryuzaki.He was quite a celebrity. He is so popular that he is recognized not only by jealous boys, but even by girls who have little to do with him.However, although he is such a guy, he has never fallen in love with anyone in particular. That\u2019s why the people around him were wondering, \u201cWho is he going to date?\u201d. I guess they were wondering what was going on\u2026\u2026. The mystery was finally being solved now.It\u2019s no wonder everyone is paying attention.And that \u201cattention\u201d was the \u2026\u2026 concept she was least comfortable with.\u201cShiho! I have something to tell you\u2026\u2026. Please, will you listen to me?\u201dThe one who was called out by name was of course Shiho Shimotsuki, Ryuzaki\u2019s childhood friend.Ryuzaki is staring at her in front of the stage. The people around her are all looking at her at the same time.A lot of eyes, and the consciousness of others, were focused on the little girl, Shiho Shimotsuki.\u201c\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015!\u201dEven from a distance, I could tell.Shimotsuki\u2019s expression was tense and strained.I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t notice the change in Shimotsuki because she is always expressionless in front of Ryuzaki. He is reaching out gently \u2026\u2026 and I am sure he does not know what he has done.As usual, the protagonist only thinks about himself.They don\u2019t seem to understand that Shimotsuki is now so uncomfortable that she can\u2019t speak.(No way, this is how you\u2019re going to confess\u2026\u2026.)I clenched my fists at the unexpected situation.See, it happened after all. A convenient scene for the protagonist has arrived.If you think about it, surely \u2026\u2026 this situation is the only option for Shimotsuki\u2019s confession to end in a good outcome. The opportunism is firmly in effect.Shiho Shimotsuki is not very good with Ryuzaki as she should be, so the chances of a successful confession are close to zero.But with so many people watching, can Shimotsuki really speak up?No, she can\u2019t. She was shy and sensitive to the presence of others, but there was no way she could express herself in this situation with so many people watching her.\u201cDamn.\u201dI bite my lip at the worst confession I\u2019ve ever heard.I can\u2019t meet up with Shimotsuki anymore.The story is now entering its peak.There\u2019s no way for a mob character to intervene in this confession.That\u2019s why all I could do was look at the protagonist as usual\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m sure she would have firmly refused to go on stage.But she couldn\u2019t say anything, so she went up on stage as she was led by the people around her.Everyone seemed to be excited about Ryuzaki\u2019s confession.The whole place was already dominated by Ryoma Ryuzaki.\u201cGo for it! \u201cShow us who you are!\u201d \u201cShow us your strength! \u201cYou can do it, Ryuzaki-kun!\u201dThey were cheering him on as he plucked up the courage to confess his feelings.That\u2019s why everyone is oblivious.They don\u2019t understand how frightened Shimotsuki is right now\u2026\u2026, how nervous she is, how she\u2019s shaking herself, how she\u2019s about to cry.Because she is the girl who was confessed to by Ryoma Ryuzaki.There is no way that the heroine, who was given such good fortune, would not like it.(This is the worst\u2026\u2026)I clench my fists. My fingernails dig into my skin and it hurts, but it helps me keep my cool.Think. What can I do \u2026\u2026 to save Shimotsuki?How can I help that nice girl who thinks I\u2019m special\u2026\u2026?(If Ryuzaki confesses his love to her\u2026\u2026)I\u2019m sure Shimotsuki can\u2019t refuse.No, she should not be able to say anything. The only thing she can do is to keep quiet, kill her emotions, and endure the situation.If she does, it will eventually be interpreted in a way that is convenient for Ryuzaki.\u201cCan\u2019t you give me an answer that quickly? If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll confess again sometime. But you have to know that I love you. Maybe you don\u2019t like me yet, but I\u2019ll try my best to make you like \u2026\u2026 me someday.\u201dWhat a way to suggest that the relationship would progress in the sequel.This is impossible.I can\u2019t accept this.Because Shimotsuki is not very good with Ryuzaki.No matter how hard she tries in the future, she will never be able to like Ryuzaki.That\u2019s how much she doesn\u2019t even care about that guy.Well, \u2026\u2026 it\u2019s the reason why the story chose this stage.In order to prevent the protagonist from being rejected, the story is trying to extend itself with the most convenient situation.If this continues, Shimotsuki will remain the main heroine forever.I\u2019m still not going to allow Ryuzaki to approach her, make her feel bad, and spend her days in pain. \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u2013I want to help.\u2013If I could, I would protect her.I think strongly in my heart.Shimotsuki is a benefactor to me.I had no confidence in myself, I was constantly denying myself, and to top it off, I was so self-loathing that I described myself as a \u201cmob character\u201d.Thanks to her, I\u2019ve been really enjoying every day recently.It was a relief to know that there was someone who would accept me like this \u2026\u2026.\u201cDon\u2019t say sad things about mob characters.\u201dThat\u2019s what she once said to me to cheer me up.I don\u2019t think I can express in words how much those words encouraged me. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m sure that for Shimotsuki, Kotaro Nakayama is not just a mob character.As proof of this, \u2026\u2026 she is still looking at me with eyes that seem to cling to me.And then her lips moved as if to appeal for something.\u201cNakayama-kun, \u2026\u2026 please help me.\u201dI thought I heard a voice.No, it was an auditory hallucination. Shimotsuki is in a situation where she cannot say a word\u2026\u2026, but just by the movement of her lips, I knew what she was saying.I\u2019ve been with her for a while now.I can at least tell what she\u2019s thinking by looking at her face.\u201cHelp me.\u201dThe moment I sensed her intentions, I felt something flare up inside me.\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201dI nodded, and moved my heavy body forcibly.I\u2019m done with being a mob character \u2026\u2026.I\u2019ll do anything for Shimotsuki.I can even stand up to the protagonist.In order to do that, I can\u2019t stay as a mob character.\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious! You think you can get away with this kind of confession \u2026\u2026!?\u201dI raise my voice loudly and ruin the atmosphere of the place.Of course, the source of the voice was \u2026\u2026 me.I\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019m in the middle of a good story, but \u2026\u2026, my protagonist, let me interrupt your story.Ryuzaki Ryoma. I\u2019m not going to allow you to have a happy ending.Do you know that there is a bad ending to a story?Ryuzaki, I won\u2019t let your wish come true.For that purpose, I\u2019ll block your romantic comedy not as a \u201cmob character\u201d but as a \u2026\u2026 \u201cvillain\u201d\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The air in the place was completely chilled by what I had said.I am aware that I said something out of place.However, my days of being a casual observer, being carried away by the flow of events, reading the atmosphere, are over.I can\u2019t protect Shimotsuki if I remain a mob character.To protect her, \u2026\u2026 I can do anything.It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m a villain or not.I felt like I could be the heel that destroys the story.\u201cRyuzaki. You\u2019re a real coward, you know that? You\u2019re really annoying to watch. You declared war on me, didn\u2019t you? If that\u2019s the case, then give me a fair fight! Confessing under such circumstances really disgusts me.\u201dSlowly, I made my way towards the stage.A while ago, the crowd was in the way and I couldn\u2019t move forward, but now everyone was making way for me, so it was easy to walk.Everyone was looking at me.They looked at me with puzzled, suspicious, curious, and confused faces.\u201cWho is this?\u201dThey probably didn\u2019t even recognize me.It was only natural, since I was a mob character.But today, at \u2026\u2026 this moment, they will recognize who I am.That\u2019s how far I\u2019ve come.\u201cNakayama \u2026\u2026, don\u2019t interrupt me. I\u2019m about to confess my feelings to Shiho. What\u2019s wrong with you all of a sudden?\u3000Are you in a hurry? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in a hurry because you were caught off guard by the fact that you won and then I did something bold like this.\u201dRyuzaki, on the other hand, is missing the point.Panicked? In a hurry? Me, for you?I\u2019m long past that stage.I\u2019ve never thought of you as an enemy.Because Ryuzaki \u2026\u2026 you haven\u2019t even reached the battle stage.I\u2019m not sure how you can say that when you\u2019ve already lost the battle.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Why would you confess under such circumstances? You love Shimotsuki, didn\u2019t you? You really love her, don\u2019t you? If so, that\u2019s impossible.\u201dI get up on stage and glare straight at Ryuzaki.It seems that he can\u2019t hide his annoyance with me either. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s annoyed that I\u2019ve interrupted his show.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about. It doesn\u2019t matter when or under what circumstances I confess, does it? \u00a0What I did in front of everyone was to show her that I was that serious.\u201d\u201cHaha. \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki is always all about himself, isn\u2019t he? You\u2019re so self-absorbed, you don\u2019t even think about the other person, you can only come up with things that make you feel good.\u201dAs if to explode the emotion of \u201cI hate you\u201d that I had been suppressing in my mind for a long time.I vented my emotions as much as I could.\u201cSo, you always hurt others. Can\u2019t you see what your beloved person is looking like right now \u2026\u2026?\u201dThen I embraced Shimotsuki\u2019s shoulders.Her face was pale and she was biting her lip tightly, but as soon as \u2026\u2026 I hugged her, she started to spill large tears.\u201c\u2014-Eh?\u201dSeeing the tears, Ryuzaki finally seemed to realize.How much Shimotsuki had hated this situation.\u201cShiho? Hey, why are you crying \u2026\u2026?\u201dIt\u2019s so heartbreaking to see such a lovely girl shedding tears.Not to mention Ryuzaki, myself, and everyone else in the \u2026\u2026 audience were also watching with pain in our eyes.At this moment, the flow of events changed.At first, there was an air of bewilderment at the intrusion of a foreigner like me, but \u2026\u2026 it soon turned to sympathy for Shimotsuki.And at the same time, it also leads to the affirmation of my existence.\u201cIs confession a spectacle for Ryuzaki? For example, don\u2019t you ever assume that the girl you are confessing to is a very timid and shy girl who gets scared just by the \u2026\u2026 presence of others?\u201dAttention gathers .Everyone perceives me, and they are leaning forward to hear what I have to say next.As if to speak to them as well, I strung my words together.\u201cShimotsuki is that kind of girl\u2026\u2026. So don\u2019t do this to her. How can you be a childhood friend and not know that? How can this girl be serious when you confess to her like a spectacle?\u201dI won\u2019t allow you to be insensitive.I\u2019m not going to let you get away with opportunism.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That \u2026 um.\u201dAs soon as I hugged her, Shimotsuki suddenly regained her vigor, as if the time that had stopped had begun to move.As if the thread of tension that had been taut had been cut, \u2026\u2026 Shimotsuki became weak, leaned against me, and then began to spill large tears.In order to reassure her, I gently rubbed her back.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. Here, take a deep breath. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take care of everything else. Here, take a handkerchief. You\u2019ve got tears and snot all over your face. You\u2019re going to be okay\u2026\u2026 Stay behind me, okay?\u201dShimotsuki was desperately trying to say something, but she was in such an unstable state that she couldn\u2019t get the words out.In order to calm her down, I handed her a handkerchief and spoke gently to her.Seeing this, Ryuzaki seemed to reaffirm his failure.\u201cShiho is shy? Is she timid? No, no, no, no, that\u2019s not \u2026\u2026 possible. This is because Shiho is a quiet, solitary person who likes to be alone and has no interest in other people\u2026\u2026, so she didn\u2019t even look at me, and she hated talking to other people. She\u2019s not that kind of girl, is she \u2026\u2026?\u201dHe was still trying to hang on to his misconception.He doesn\u2019t want to believe it.But that statement is not convincing.Shimotsuki\u2019s tears and attitude proved that everything Ryuzaki had said was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d.\u201c\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re always interpreting things to suit yourself like that. I\u2019m not sure what to say. Does she like to be alone?\u3000Not interested in others? It\u2019s not like that\u2026\u2026. She\u2019s talkative, she\u2019s longed for friends, and she\u2019s always been curious about others. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s too timid and shy to get the courage to take the first step.\u201dAt this point, I\u2019d like to correct all the misunderstandings.I denied all the facts that had been conveniently interpreted by Ryuzaki.\u201cThen why were you so cold to me!? If you were interested in other people, if you wanted a friend, if you wanted to have a chat, I was there! Why didn\u2019t Shiho accept me, her childhood friend, the one who knew her better than anyone else!\u201dStill defeated, I felt that he still didn\u2019t understand Shimotsuki when she objected to him.You don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, do you?\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s a given.\u201dSuddenly, a smile appeared on my face.I can see it in myself. I\u2019m sure I have a very distorted and ugly smile on my face right now.But I couldn\u2019t control my emotions.I was enjoying the sight of Ryuzaki, whom I hated, getting all upset.This is exactly the kind of villain I want to be.A villain who destroys the story might be a good fit for me.I wanted Ryuzaki to get hurt more and more.I said clearly in a voice that everyone could hear.\u201cShimotsuki didn\u2019t like Ryuzaki. \u2026.. Why didn\u2019t you notice? How can you not understand when she\u2019s so cold and unresponsive when you talk to her, and when she looks so depressed just being next to you?\u201dAt last, I said it.Shiho Shimotsuki is not fond of Ryoma Ryuzaki.That the protagonist was nothing more than a stranger to the main heroine.I blurted it out with all my emotions.In response to that truth, Ryuzaki shook his head as if to say \u2026\u2026 it\u2019s impossible, then staggered back and leaned against the stage wall like he was bumping into it.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible\u2026\u2026, because I\u2019m Shiho\u2019s childhood friend.\u201d\u201c\u2013Just because you\u2019ve known each other since childhood doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s why you\u2019re close. For Shimotsuki, you are just a stranger that she has known since childhood\u2026\u2026 You need to accept that fact.\u201dIf I had to describe it, I would say that it is like a verbal knife that cuts you to shreds.One-sidedly throwing out emotions and hurting the person named Ryoma Ryuzaki.Even the protagonist, as expected, was still hurt by those \u201ctruths\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a lie!!\u201dHe shouted, glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.But that stare was only for a moment. \u2026\u2026 Every time he looked at me, he would be shocked by the reality of what he saw.Now, behind me is Shimotsuki, who has shrunk down to hide behind my back.When you see her like that, you\u2019ll understand exactly how much she adores me.\u201cDamn \u2026\u2026 damn! I\u2019m the one who met her first! I was the first one to like her\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t take Shiho away from me\u2026\u2026. Damn it.\u201dThe sore loser\u2019s words echoed through the quiet audience.Such a Ryuzaki was so \u2026\u2026 uncool that it was hard to watch.Now, the Warriors\u2019 time is over. I\u2019m sorry, Ryuzaki \u2026\u2026, but I\u2019m going to let your story \u201cfall apart\u201d at this point.I\u2019m sorry to say that right after your awakening, you\u2019ll have to go back to being a bum.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Originally, the story was supposed to have a happy ending.Surely, Ryoma Ryuzaki would have been able to make a great leap forward after the turning point of today. Starting with the main heroine, Shimotsuki, he would have been able to capture the sub-heroines in the sequel one after another, whose relationships are still vague at the moment.However, the one who interfered with this guy was a person who was only a mob character.Kotaro Nakayama.In other words, I was the only miscalculation for Ryoma Ryuzaki.I couldn\u2019t be anything else, but thanks to Shimotsuki, I got a role. In the name of her, I acted as a villain for the protagonist and blamed him.And so, the story fell apart.The harem story of Ryoma Ryuzaki, which had managed to hold its shape until halfway through the story, was destroyed by a different person, \u2026\u2026 me.\u201cWhy you? How did you become Shiho\u2019s \u201cspecial one\u201d when you are such a plain and inconspicuous mob? Nakayama, you\u2019re nothing special, but \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m definitely more deserving of Shiho.\u201dYou can deny it, but it won\u2019t change the outcome.Now it\u2019s me next to Shimotsuki, and it\u2019s Ryuzaki who made her cry.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Shiho look back at me too? \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve always liked Shiho, so I\u2019ve always held back, even when other girls have tempted me. I\u2019ve had a lot of emotional turmoil, but I\u2019ve always had Shiho\u2019s face in my mind, and I\u2019ve held back. Only Shiho was special to me\u2026\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t take it any longer and \u2026\u2026 couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the words.\u201cHahaha, \u2026\u2026 what\u2019s that? I knew it. You\u2019re always thinking of yourself, aren\u2019t you? Did you put up with the other girls\u2019 temptations? Shimotsuki was the only one who was special? Yeah, you really are a coward, Ryuzaki. The truth is, you were just scared, right?\u3000You just didn\u2019t have the courage to face the feelings of the other girls, using Shimotsuki as an excuse, right?\u201dI didn\u2019t say these words because I was playing a villain. It was something I\u2019ve always thought about.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. I really feel sorry for the girls who like you. \u2026\u2026 I feel sorry for them from the side. They\u2019re trying so hard to tell you that they love you. They\u2019ve been very blatant about how much they love you, but you just keep pretending to ignore it. You betray their feelings, trample on them, kick them to the ground, and make no effort to reciprocate. You\u2019re so naive? That\u2019s bullshit.\u201dMy stepsister\u2019s face appeared in my mind.I\u2019m not going to forgive this guy for hurting my precious family.\u201cI don\u2019t care what other girls say. Even though other girls have confessed to me, I still love Shiho! So I have to make this confession successful, but if I don\u2019t \u2026\u2026, I won\u2019t be able to face that girl who confessed to me.\u201dWhat an arrogant person you are!The pathetic clown who was fumbling around in his position as the protagonist was hilarious.\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t make me laugh any more\u2026\u2026. If you want to repay her confession, all you had to do was accept the girl, right? Don\u2019t talk about turning her down as if it\u2019s a beautiful thing. Don\u2019t talk about how you hurt her as if it\u2019s a good thing. You can\u2019t face her? You can\u2019t face the girl you\u2019ve been talking about!\u201dI wished he would stop using Azusa as an excuse to say stupid things.\u201cStop using her as an excuse. Don\u2019t burden her any more. \u2026\u2026 That\u2019s the only \u2018atonement\u2019 you can make.\u201dAzusa\u2019s confession was the medicine that healed Ryuzaki.But it was not a medicine to cure, but a \u201cdoping\u201d that only increased \u2026\u2026.Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s illness has not been cured.He is a \u201closer\u201d from the bottom of his heart.He only thinks about himself, but he always looks to others for the reason. This time, he didn\u2019t do it voluntarily because he wanted to confess his feelings to Shimotsuki. He just used it as an excuse for rejecting Azusa\u2019s confession.He\u2019s really a stupid person.\u201cYou have to realize that. What did she look like when you rejected her confession? Did she smile? Did she really look like that? \u2026\u2026 Didn\u2019t she look like she was about to cry, like Shimotsuki just now?\u201dI still have Azusa\u2019s crying face stuck in my mind.I will never be able to forget that painful image again.\u201cStop looking away from what you don\u2019t want to see. Don\u2019t forget, Ryuzaki, that there is a girl who was hurt because of you. If you are really, truly happy with her confession, please don\u2019t \u2026\u2026 smear her with more mud.\u201dI\u2019m begging you, don\u2019t hurt Azusa any more.I\u2019m sure my heartfelt words \u2026\u2026 did not reach Ryuzaki.No matter what I say, there is no way the protagonist-sama will twist his thoughts with my words.But for the sake of the subheroine who adores that guy\u2026\u2026, the protagonist will be able to accept his mistakes.\u201c\u2026\u201dI\u2019m sure he knows that too.He remembered that Azusa had looked like she was about to cry.That\u2019s why Ryuzaki could only nod, unable to say anything.This is the end of the protagonist\u2019s awakening.The doping effect of Azusa\u2019s confession has worn off, and he\u2019s just the same old loser.Now, it\u2019s time to end it.Ryuzaki Ryoma\u2026\u2026, I\u2019m sick of your stupid story\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you wipe the runny nose properly?\u201dThen, I turn my attention to Shimotsuki, who has probably calmed down over time.\u2026\u2026 I really don\u2019t want to take advantage of her, though.However, I really need Shimotsuki\u2019s help to settle this situation.I have to make a clean break with the protagonist who refuses to give up.I have to end his story by confessing my feelings and ending up with Shimotsuki.So I faced Shimotsuki.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Hmm.\u201dPerhaps it was because she had carefully rubbed her nose and eyes, but Shimotsuki\u2019s face was even more swollen than usual. However, she wasn\u2019t as distraught as before. She seems to have calmed down somehow, so she\u2019s probably fine now.All that was left was for me to confess.With this, I can finally save Shimotsuki.With that thought, I tried to finish everything.\u201cShimotsuki. Listen, \u2026\u2026 I think you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u2026.. But the girl Shimotsuki Shiho, unlike Ryoma Ryuzaki, is a fine main heroine.It\u2019s not just a weak girl who can be saved.As soon as she realized what I was going to say, she suddenly changed her color.\u201cNo!\u201dShe shook her head and stared at me with swollen eyes, as if in anger.She is a shy girl, sensitive to the presence of others, and basically a clumsy girl, but she is also a shy person who is strong only in front of those who \u2026\u2026 she has forgiven.So the girl next to me was \u2026\u2026 very strong.\u201cNakayama-kun, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m fine now. So don\u2019t push yourself any further, okay? You don\u2019t have to get hurt anymore\u2026\u2026. Thank you for helping me. I have more courage. So let\u2019s talk about it later, okay?\u201d\u2013I won\u2019t forgive you.\u2013I don\u2019t want you to confess now.I felt as if I was being told that, and I choked up.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh, is that so? Then yeah. Okay, but \u2026\u2026\u201dAre you sure you\u2019re okay?I was worried about Shimotsuki, but she seemed to be fine, just like she said she would be.\u201cRyuzaki-kun. I understand how you feel. I\u2019m sorry that I misled you\u2026\u2026. So, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll apologize to you first. After that, please listen to me?\u201dShimotsuki is facing Ryuzaki.For the first time in this story, perhaps, the main heroine\u2019s true feelings were about to be told to the protagonist.\u201cSh, Shiho, \u2026\u2026?\u201dRyuzaki was scared.However, he is looking at Shimotsuki with somewhat expectant eyes.She has yet to say anything to him.So, there is a slight possibility of a major upset, as if to say so.However, there is no way that the outcast heroine, Shimotsuki, would approve of such a development in the story.\u201cI\u2019ve never been very good at you. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t told you before\u2026\u2026. I haven\u2019t liked you much for a long time. Yeah, so \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki-kun. I can\u2019t reciprocate your feelings.\u201dShe puts an end to it with her own hands.It was a slightly different ending than the one I had envisioned.What I had envisioned was that I would confess and go out with Shimotsuki to end Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s love, but \u2026\u2026 she cut off Ryuzaki\u2019s feelings with her own words.\u201c\u2014-!\u201dIf he were told, Ryuzaki would have no choice but to accept it.His love ended without any reward.The story of Ryoma Ryuzaki came to an end without producing anything.That it ended not with a happy ending, but with a bad ending.It seems that all Ryuzaki could do was accept it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout saying a word, he got off the stage.He wandered off in the direction of nowhere.There was no one left to chase after Ryuzaki.Although Azusa chased after him earlier and encouraged him.Even the other subheroines seemed to think that it would be difficult to save Ryoma Ryuzaki now.This is the end of the road for harem protagonists. As a result of betraying his feelings, trampling on them, and pretending not to notice them, \u2026\u2026 he lost all affection for him.\u2026\u2026 And so the romantic comedy of Ryoma Ryuzaki ended.The harem romantic comedy closes with the result that it is a waste of time, with no catharsis at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She asked me to follow her, so I did so, and before I knew it, we were alone.Perhaps it is a storeroom. There are several prefabricated buildings that look like warehouses set up around it. In such a place, Shimotsuki was quietly breathing.\u201cI never thought it would come to this. \u2026\u2026 I just wanted to chat with Nakayama-kun over the campfire, but how did I get caught up in something so strange?\u201dIn the moonlight, she was covering her face with her hands to hide her reddened face.\u201cUgh \u2026\u2026 hey, now I\u2019m ugly, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019ve been crying so much that my eyes and nose feel funny. I am so embarrassed that Nakayama-kun can see my face like this. If possible, I would like you to close your eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s not weird. Shimotsuki is always so cute.\u201dPerhaps because I am distracted, my mouth is quicker than usual.I end up saying the word \u2018cute,\u2019 which I usually try not to say too often.\u201cNyu\u2026\u2026, no, no, don\u2019t say that. Now my cheeks will turn bright red\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m going to be as red as a boiled octopus. Nakayama, are you really so mean?\u201dShe said that, but she didn\u2019t seem to be completely full of it. Her cheeks were loosening happily.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not true. Nakayama-kun is very kind\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s impossible for him to be mean. I mean, you saved me. Thank you so much.\u201dSaying this, Shimotsuki rubs up against me.She rubbed her body against me as if to pamper me, and I felt closer to her than usual. Our skin is touching, and her slightly hot body heat stimulates my heart. My heart is beating hard, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of her charm.\u201cMy mind was blank at that moment\u2026\u2026 and I didn\u2019t know what to do, my body couldn\u2019t move as fast as I wanted it to. I\u2019m not very good at public appearances\u2026\u2026 so I was afraid of the way people were looking at me. I had so many different sounds echoing in my head that I felt like I was going to freeze in a panic.\u201dSo Shimotsuki could not say anything.Even when Ryuzaki confessed his feelings to her, she was unable to convey her intentions clearly.That is probably how much she was suffering from that situation.She is much more sensitive to sound than usual, and perhaps she picks up on other people\u2019s sounds easily. That may be why she senses the presence of \u201cothers\u201d more strongly than an ordinary person like me.If so, then at that time when she was in the state of being a freak show, Shimotsuki must have been really suffering.\u201cBut when I heard Nakayama-kun\u2019s voice, I was no longer afraid at all. Because you were next to me \u2026\u2026, the things I was afraid of became less scary. That\u2019s why I owe you, Nakayama-kun. Thank you for helping me.\u201dA sincere smile is directed at me.For such a person who was only a mob character, Shimotsuki gives me a special look.No, this girl does not think of me as a mob character.\u201cNakayama-kun is my own personal hero.\u201d\u2013Once upon a time, there was a boy who was loved by no one and betrayed by everyone.He lost everything, thought of himself as a mob character, and was a boring person who just went with the flow\u2026\u2026. He met a girl and his life changed.(Is this \u2026\u2026 happiness?)Warm, tender feelings fill my heart.I was so happy to hear Shimotsuki\u2019s words that I almost cried my eyes out\u2026Thank you is my line.Thank you for accepting me.Thank you for choosing me.Thank you \u2026\u2026 for making me the protagonist \u2026\u2026.Thank you very much\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hey, you can\u2019t do that out of the blue. \u2026\u2026 What if I get too nervous and collapse? Nakayama-kun is a person who can\u2019t help it anymore. \u2026.. uhehe\u201dAlthough she denies it in words, Shimotsuki seems happy.She said no, but on the contrary, she was holding on to me, so I couldn\u2019t get away even if I tried.\u201c\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201c\u201dFor a while, we embraced each other in silence.Then, she was the first to break the silence.\u201cNakayama-kun?

Nakayama-kun, is your answer what you really sincerely think? Hey, Nakayama-kun, \u2026\u2026 do you understand what it means to like another person?\u201d\u2014 I was at a loss for words at that statement.In response to Shimotsuki\u2019s question, I \u2026\u2026 thought carefully about myself again.I like her. That is a feeling that is not false.But I wonder if what Shimotsuki means by \u201clike\u201d and what I think of as \u201clike\u201d are really the same thing.\u201cNakayama-kun, you hate yourself, don\u2019t you? You don\u2019t seem very sure of yourself. So you don\u2019t love yourself. How can you love another person in such a state? Do you \u2026\u2026 really, really like me?\u201d\u2026\u2026 Oh, yes.I certainly hate myself.I don\u2019t love myself like that.I wonder if the words \u201cI like you\u201d are really worth it when you say them in such a state.Do my words have any weight?\u201cI like you more than you know, okay? I will never be satisfied with a mere \u2018I like you\u2019.\u201d\u2013I see.Finally, I realized what Shimotsuki was trying to say.Her thoughts far exceed my imagination.So, it sounded like Shimotsuki was asking me to be more mindful of \u2018my feelings\u2019 and that\u2019s what she was saying.\u201cI like you because you like me \u2013 that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been compromised. I want you to know me better. I want you to understand my feelings more. And, you know, I want you to like me more \u2026\u2026.\u201dNot a passive \u2018like\u2019.I am looking for a girl named Shiho Shimotsuki for active \u2018liking\u2019.\u201cSo I\u2019ll wait for you. Nakayama-kun, I will watch by your side until you come to like yourself \u2026\u2026 and learn to like me even more. So, I don\u2019t need your confession yet.\u201dThen, Shimotsuki stood up tall.She put her hand around my neck and lightly touched her lips to my cheek this time.\u201cI\u2019ve never been so in love with someone before. So, if you can, \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-kun, I hope you love me as much as I love you.\u201d\u2013Oh, I see.Finally, I get it.I\u2019ve been a mob character until now, and now I\u2019m the protagonist only for\u2026\u2026 Shiho Shimotsuki.In other words, the story had not yet begun.The story so far was just a prequel.From here, the romantic comedy between me and Shiho Shimotsuki would finally begin.\u201cYes, I do\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ll love you more and more. I promise\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Shimotsuki.\u201dIf that\u2019s the case.I\u2019m done calling her a stranger.\u201c\u2013Shiho. I\u2019m going to take care of you from now on.\u201dFor the first time, I call her name and hug her again.It\u2019s not that this is radical behavior. If you think about it in a normal way, it\u2019s just a light expression of affection\u2026\u2026 but even just this made her so happy that she jumped up and down.\u201cUfufu \u2026 I\u2019m so glad you finally called me \u2026\u2026.. I was so stubborn, you know. I was so determined to have you call me by my name someday that I kept calling you \u2018Nakayama-kun\u2019 in a lonely way, you know? But you don\u2019t have to put up with me anymore.\u201dShe smiled happily and hugged me again.\u201cKotaro!

I\u2019m not sure how much I would have liked it if Shiho hadn\u2019t been involved in it.But, well, \u2026\u2026 Ryoma Ryuzaki, the protagonist, \u2026\u2026 may have fallen down.However, the love of the sub-heroines is genuine. The girls who are trying to support Ryoma Ryuzaki are starting to make their mark.Among them, my former childhood friend Yuzuki and my former best friend Kirari are trying their best to cheer Ryuzaki up. Or maybe it\u2019s one of them who will be the next true heroine, I wonder.But Azusa is no longer there.She has been out of the harem ever since Ryuzaki rejected her.She is now absent from school and dawdling around the house.As a brother, I am worried about her, but she is getting a little better these days and her appetite is returning. Perhaps she will be able to return to school soon.It may be hard for her now, but she will be able to laugh again someday. Until then, I wanted to take my time and wait for her.\u2013such is the way it is, though there are a few changes.But my days are very full.Because that girl who is quiet in front of everyone becomes very talkative only in front of \u2026\u2026 me, and she expresses her love to me in an explicit way.\u201cHey, Kotaro-kun. Let me make you an \u2018ahhh\u2019? Oh, you\u2019re embarrassed? No. Do you think it\u2019s okay if I sulk? If I sulk, I get angry with my cheeks flattened like a squirrel, you know? I wonder if it\u2019s okay to be a little ugly. Don\u2019t you want me to be a very \u2018cute\u2019 Shiho-chan at all times?\u201dAt lunchtime, while eating lunch together, she talks one way or the other.I felt that she talked more often than before, probably due to her increased love for me.But of course, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it.In fact, I wanted to talk more and more.\u201cShiho is always cute, it\u2019s okay.\u201dAnd I, too, have been all about listening, but lately I\u2019ve been trying to get the words out myself.I try to express what I am thinking and feeling.When I do this, Shiho is very happy.\u201cCute? Oh my gosh, ughhhh \u2026\u2026 What, Kotaro-kun, you are becoming very good at talking. Do you think that praising me like that is going to improve my mood?\u3000It\u2019s totally \u2026\u2026 right, so you\u2019re not wrong, but it\u2019s kind of annoying because it\u2019s like you think I\u2019m a bit of a snob..\u201dShiho is the type of person who gets embarrassed when you compliment her.She is an easy girl to understand because her attitude is obvious that she is pleased, although her words give off an air of slight reluctance.(What fun\u2026\u2026.)Looking at her, my cheeks naturally relax.Thanks to Shiho, my once gray days have turned colorful.Shiho is very talkative, which is a big plus for me, since I used to be a mob character.That really made me happy.\u2026\u2026 Now, the romantic comedy between me and Shiho starts here.It will probably be a bad one, not very good as a finished product.There are no peaks and valleys in this story, only parallel lines of \u201chappiness\u201d.But I think that\u2019s fine.I don\u2019t want to see Shiho crying anymore.Because Shiho is the cutest when she is smiling.(Part 1, Complete)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the shadow of a prefab shed that looked like a warehouse, I was nodding off, hiding myself.I was shocked that my childhood friend, my first love, had rejected me.I was also frustrated that the person I loved had been taken away from me by Nakayama, an ordinary man with no special qualities.I felt miserable.I wanted to heal myself as much as possible and I was left alone\u2026.. Fate is cruel.That\u2019s when those guys came.The ones who came to avoid being seen were Shiho and Nakayama.They didn\u2019t notice me.They probably only saw each other.The scene at that time was very shocking.Shiho was staring at Nakayama with a bright red face.She had always been expressionless, but now she looked like a maiden in love and was hugging Nakayama.Shiho could only see Nakayama.She used to be sensitive to the presence of others, she used to notice me wherever I was and look at me, but \u2026\u2026 now, she was so absorbed in Nakayama that she could not perceive me hiding.And they were whispering their love to each other.Since there was a little distance between us, I could not hear what they were saying to each other. However, the word \u201clove\u201d was interspersed throughout their words, so they must have become lovers.As proof, Shiho kissed Nakayama on the cheek.I could not forget that scene even after hours had passed\u2026.\u201cWhy \u2026 why \u2026\u2026 is it Nakayama?\u201dA moaning voice leaks out. I am alone in my room, so I am not talking to anyone. This is just me talking to myself.The truth is, I wanted to scream.If I opened the window and raised my voice, I am sure it would be heard in Shiho\u2019s room right in front of me.Her room is very close. It is only about a meter away from my window. So, if I wanted to see her, I could see her anytime I wanted to.I was closer to Shiho than anyone else.She was my childhood friend and the first person I fell in love with. I wanted to remain the person she loved for a long time to come\u2026\u2026.!\u2018I\u2019m not good with you.\u2019When Shiho said that to me, I didn\u2019t know what was going on anymore.I can\u2019t say it myself, but there are a lot of girls around me. So I guess I\u2019m not the uncool one by any means.At least compared to Nakayama, there is no reason to lose.Nakayama is more ordinary and boring than me. There is nothing that Nakayama has that I don\u2019t.So why \u2026\u2026?\u201cIf Nakayama is good enough for you, why not me? Am I really that much of a loser? Shiho \u2026\u2026 tell me, what am I missing \u2026\u2026 damn it.\u201dI don\u2019t know what Nakayama has that I don\u2019t.I don\u2019t know why Nakayama is good and I am bad.\u2026\u2026I always thought I was just an average person.I have no special qualities, but there is nothing wrong with me, and I am proud that I am not someone to be disliked.As proof of this, there were many girls who became friends with me.Moreover, some of them even confessed their feelings to me. I thought I was not a bad person\u2026\u2026!\u201cI don\u2019t get it anymore\u2026\u2026.\u201dNodding, I close my eyes.My confidence is gone.I didn\u2019t know how to treat the girls who talked to me.I was afraid that no matter what I said, they would hate me like Shiho does.Oh dear, \u2026\u2026 what a despicable person I am.Because of Shiho, I will never be able to be confident in myself again.Huh, that\u2019s boring.This is just like a mob character.It\u2019s so stupid.I\u2019m just me. I don\u2019t want to be a mob character even if it kills me.I want to make him pay back.I want to show Nakayama, the guy who ridiculed me, that I can win.I want to show him how superior I am.I want to show him that people like me are not people to be made fun of by people like him.Someday, I want to somehow show him \u2026\u2026 how it\u2019s done.That\u2019s what I strongly thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that she is no longer satisfied with ordinary \u201clike\u201d so she made a request of me.\u201cWill you love me more and more?\u201dUntil then, Shiho is willing to wait, apparently.If I love myself, and then I love Shiho more, \u2026\u2026 then I\u2019m sure we can have the kind of relationship we want.I \u2026\u2026 honestly appreciated the suggestion.After all, as a former self-proclaimed mob character, my self-esteem is inexplicably low. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to be able to get into a relationship with her.I wonder if it\u2019s okay for me to love her.I wonder if we are not in harmony with each other.Will I not be able to make Shiho happy?If I\u2019m not careful, I can easily become anxious.I knew Shiho would not be amused by that.Therefore, I want to love her with pride and dignity.In order to do so, I have to gain a firm confidence in myself.Therefore, I needed time.Fortunately, Shiho said she would wait patiently for me, so I decided to allow her to enjoy her feelings for now.During the summer vacation, in a normal romantic comedy, we would have gone to the beach or mountains, camped, stayed at each other\u2019s houses, and many other events, but since Shiho \u2026\u2026 is an excessive indoor person and has a curfew of 19:00 in her family circumstances, such big events did not happen.Basically, she would come to my house around noon, hang out, and leave in the evening. She continued this kind of life for the rest of the summer vacation.I was happy that we could be together all the time, but since things were going on like that, there was no progress in our relationship.As I thought, a romantic comedy with me as the main character is a bad idea.If it were normal, readers would not allow such a dull development.Well, that\u2019s just how I am, so I don\u2019t have anything to think about now.\u2013And so, the second semester began.September. When I arrived at the classroom, I suddenly saw Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s back.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSince the overnight learning program, that guy has become very quiet.He has been silent all the time, lost in thought, as if pondering something.He is not so much flirting with the members of his harem, which he prides himself on, and he is no longer \u2026\u2026 like a protagonist.Perhaps that guy has really fallen apart?Has being dumped by Shiho made him apathetic, ignoring the goodwill of other girls?If so, \u2026\u2026 well, that\u2019s one result.If he is apathetic by stepping on the goodwill of others and pretending to be a miserable protagonist, then he should just keep on doing so.If Ryuzaki has fallen from his harem protagonist status,\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s fine and dandy.But still, that\u2019s not going to happen.Because sometimes that guy glares at me. The strong hatred seems to be getting stronger day by day.If there is a trigger, \u2026\u2026 or something will happen again.That\u2019s what it looks like.\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want anything to happen if possible.It\u2019s a pain in the ass and I don\u2019t want Shiho to get hurt again.Hopefully, I don\u2019t want another event to happen.I want Ryoma Ryuzaki to end his school life lonely as a fallen former protagonist.That\u2019s what I thought, but it seems that Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s story is not over yet.\u201cYes, yes, yes! Is everyone out of the summer vacation mood? If you haven\u2019t, please do so! Now, without further ado, let me introduce you to a new student \u2026\u2026\u201dAt the same time as Suzuki sensei\u2019s words, which had been high-spirited since this morning, a strange girl student entered the classroom.\u201cHello\u266a I\u2019m Mary! I\u2019m from United States but I speak Japanese, so please be friends with me!\u201dA flashy, blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl enters the classroom.At the same time, everyone in the classroom must have thought:Cute \u2013 and.The atmosphere may be similar to Shiho.Most of the boys are gawking at the girl who has an out-of-the-ordinary appearance.A girl so cute that even girls are fawning over her has transferred to the school.And what a girl she is \u2013 she fell for that guy as soon as she transferred to the school.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201dMary suddenly stares at a certain point.At the tip of her gaze was \u2026\u2026 Ryoma Ryuzaki.\u201cI met you this morning! You\u2019re the one who saved me, aren\u2019t you!?\u201dI don\u2019t see any other human being anymore.When I saw her running up to Ryoma Ryuzaki, \u2026\u2026 I had a bad feeling.(Is this supposed to be a \u2026\u2026 leverage?)Adding a heroine in a sequel to keep the story from getting stuck is a common method of \u201cleveraging\u201d.It seems that Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s story is also going to be \u201cleveraged\u201d.What this suggests is that Ryoma Ryuzaki will be back on the stage again.His story is not over yet.(Haha \u2026\u2026 please don\u2019t get me involved in this again.)I pray in my heart, but that will not be the case.Because I am the \u201cvillain\u201d in Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s story.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She seems to have mastered it perfectly by watching anime when she was a child.Her blonde hair, blue eyes, and slightly curly hair make her a Western-style beauty, and her cheerful personality is also unique and not found in Japanese people.The girl who clearly radiates an unusual atmosphere would not fit into the framework of a mob character or sub-character, no matter how you look at her.She may be a leveraged main character.My prediction was right on target.\u201cHmmm, your name is Ryoma, isn\u2019t it? Thank you for this morning\u2026you saved me from losing my family\u266a. Well, he\u2019s a dog, but he\u2019s with me all the time, so he\u2019s like family!\u201dThis was shortly after she had finished introducing herself in the morning.Mary\u2019s seat would normally have been the last one available, but to my surprise she eagerly requested to be next to Ryuzaki.Ryuzaki\u2019s seat is in the center of the classroom, surrounded by harem members.Suzuki sensei gave priority to Mary, who had just transferred to the school, and asked her to occupy the seat of one of the harem members.Of course, none of the harem members were willing to move out of the way, \u2026\u2026 but the one who got the short end of the stick was that girl with the same hair color as Mary.\u201cWhat shall we do? Oh, yeah! Hey, blonde girl, give me your seat, will you? I think you might be a bit of a distraction because of your personality.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dDyeing her hair blonde is Kirari Asakura. A former best friend of mine, she looked dissatisfied with Mary\u2019s words.\u201cWhy me?\u201d\u201cBecause Ryoma\u2019s eyes would glaze over! Besides, dark hair is the best for a Japanese person, but you are forced to dye your hair, so blonde hair doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\u201cHuh!? Why should I be told such a thing by you, whom I have never met before?\u201dKirari\u2019s words are also correct.However, Mary probably had no bad intentions at all. She was laughing and berating Kiraly with a cheerful smile.\u201cNihihihi. Did I make you angry? Well, well, calm down, that you should~.\u201dPerhaps because it is just after the appearance \u2026\u2026, the tone is not stable. Although her character is somewhat unstable, she has a role as a new heroine and tends to be favored by the protagonist.\u201cKirari, calm down. She just transferred to a new school and I\u2019m sure Mary is anxious about it. \u2026\u2026 Sorry, but can you give it up here, please?\u201dHe demonstrates the \u201ckindness\u201d that is unique to the protagonist and that does not separate anyone.But that is also a cruel thought, not giving preferential treatment to the girl who has been by his side all this time.Kirari looked shocked.\u201cThat \u2026\u2026 is okay with you, Ryu-kun? You mean you don\u2019t want me, you want this woman? Well, okay then\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t even know Ryu-kun anymore.\u201dKirari turns away in a huff and gets up from her seat. With a rough gesture, she took her bags and headed for the seat where Mary was originally supposed to sit.\u2026\u2026 Apparently, the pecking order of the harem heroines had changed a bit.\u201cThank you, pouty girl \u266a, but if you\u2019re too angry, you\u2019ll ruin your pretty face!\u201dI don\u2019t know who they think they offended.What a \u2026\u2026 girl with a strong character, I thought.I feel a free and radical thought that she is willing to do anything to get closer to Ryuzaki.New characters like this are always disruptive to the story.If it were a classic story, she would show her ability as a villain without regret.However, Ryuzaki\u2019s current romantic comedy is moving in an outside-the-box direction.That is why I felt that the tricky Mary was given such a role that she dared to \u2026\u2026 return the path back to the classic.As proof, Ryuzaki\u2019s expression, which had been dark all along, brightened a bit.\u201cMary, sorry. Kirari looks kind like that, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get to know her a little better in a little while.\u201dHe despises the sub heroine and is crazy about the new heroine.\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch with you, okay? If you need any help, don\u2019t hesitate to let me know. I\u2019m here to help Mary.\u201dRyuzaki smiles briskly and holds out his hand.Mary gave him a big smile and then \u2026\u2026 unexpectedly hugged him with all her might.\u201cHey, Mary!?\u201dRyuzaki was surprised, but as if to say it doesn\u2019t matter, she kisses that guy on the cheek this time!Then, a little red-faced, she giggled again.\u201cNihihihi~. This is the Western way of greeting. The Japanese style is good, but I like this one!\u201d\u2026.. Wow, this is strong.I almost can\u2019t stop thinking about her.That new character is swinging in a very strong direction.Or, I felt such a strong personality that she could take the main heroine\u2019s place \u2026\u2026 in an instant.Because of Mary, the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki is about to be set in motion once again.Huh, I wish \u2026\u2026 I had a break.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Shimotsuki-san Likes the Mob (WN)CH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPerfect HeroineMeanwhile, that girl who used to be the main heroine seems to have skipped school early in the new semester.(Shiho \u2026\u2026 I knew you couldn\u2019t get up\u2026\u2026.)I knew what to expect.She had completely lost her rhythm during the summer vacation, and it seems that she repeatedly went to bed in the morning and woke up at noon. I guess that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t sleep well last night\u2026\u2026, but when I thought that she was sleeping with an adorable face, I felt relaxed.I think that her parents usually educate her well at times like this \u2026\u2026. She seems to be doted on so much that they don\u2019t seem to get angry at her at all. That\u2019s probably why she can skip school with confidence.Even though a new heroine has appeared at school and is showing signs of turmoil, she is still going at her own pace as usual. She has retired from being the main heroine and is taking it easy on the outside of the story.That is not, by any means, a bad thing.That girl has a life now where she is no longer pushed around by Ryuzaki.Hopefully, she will stay that way forever.Then, after the summer break, there was one more empty seat left in the classroom. The seat right next to Ryoma Ryuzaki, where Azusa would normally be sitting, has been covered with dust for a long time.Azusa had been gradually recovering after the overnight learning program, but it seems that \u2026\u2026 she couldn\u2019t get over Ryuzaki after all. She really doesn\u2019t want to go to school, so she tends to stay at home these days.I hope one day she will get better, but \u2026\u2026 there is not much I can do for her. So I\u2019m going to be patient and watch over her.After all, as for Azusa\u2019s problem, it is something she has to overcome on her own. I understand that she was shocked when she was dumped by Ryuzaki. But it was Azusa\u2019s decision to fall in love with him, so it is not a matter for me, a bystander, to interfere.(\u2026\u2026 What will she do now when she finds out that a new heroine has appeared?)Will Azusa return to the story of Ryoma Ryuzaki?Or will she get off the stage already and return to being an ordinary girl?Whichever she chooses, I am sure it will be difficult for her to find true happiness.Well, as an older brother, I can at least support her as much as I can. Until then, I will wait and see.\u2013And so the new semester has begun.The new heroine, who was introduced to Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy, had a character so broken that it twisted the story.\u201cNi-hi-hihi. Ryoma, come to my house sometime. It\u2019s a big place, so we can play a lot!\u201dI analyzed Mary\u2019s characterization based on the information scattered throughout the conversation.First of all, it seems that her parents are quite rich. Her house seems to be a mansion.Then, she showed \u2026\u2026 extraordinary athletic ability during physical education class.\u201cIn America, you can\u2019t run away from bullets unless you run this fast. \u2606\u201dShe easily defeated the men\u2019s track team in the short-distance race, despite making a joke that I am not sure if it was an American joke or not, and she is the fastest out of the bunch.Then, at the end of the summer vacation, she easily got a perfect score in a Japanese quiz.\u201cHAHAHA! I mastered the Japanese language by watching Japanese anime!\u201dNo, no, no, no, no, no\u2026\u2026. Can you learn classical grammar or something like that from anime? \u2026\u2026I was a bit nervous, but after observing her for a day, I found out what type of heroine she is.\uff08She is a perfect heroine.)She is the type of heroine who is set up to be perfect in every way and would normally have no interest in boys. However, the protagonist-sama is the only one who is special, and she falls in love only with him \u2013 and that\u2019s the way it goes.The protagonist must feel great to be loved by such an amazing heroine.She is the complete opposite of the clumsy heroine Shiho.So, how do we move on from here?As of now, I\u2019m not even on the fringes of the story. As before, I was just one of the many others, like a mob character.If I could, I would like to stay in this position.But that would never happen.I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be involved in the story as well, just not yet as a villain.I\u2019m very anxious for that time to come, but \u2026\u2026 well, let\u2019s just forget about it for now.The story is still unfolding slowly.If that were the case, I would have enjoyed \u2026\u2026 this peace and tranquility a little \u2026\u2026 longer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe I came to a wrong house???\u201cUmmm\u2026. Surprise! I\u2019m a sleepyhead at school, but when I play with Kotaro-kun, I always act five minutes early, which is very healthy. See, Kotaro-kun? You can like me even more.\u201d\u201cShe came \u2026\u2026 not five minutes ago, but two hours ago. Onii-chan, she\u2019s in my way. She ate Azusa\u2019s snack without permission.\u201d\u2026\u2026 No, I think about it calmly, this is still my house.The proof was Azusa. She seems to have a grudge against Shiho and is patting her on the back.Ah, I see. So that\u2019s how it is.Shiho gave up going to school because she overslept, but it seems she made it to my house.And since she arrived early, it seems that Azusa, who had no choice but to stay at home, was taking care of her.\u201cAzusa-nyan, I, you know, \u2026\u2026 thought of you, and I gave you a snack, didn\u2019t I? Because if you eat sweets all the time, you\u2019ll get fat. I had no choice, so I took in the calories for you, but can\u2019t you even say thank you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care if I get fat. I can\u2019t do without sweets\u2026\u2026, stop calling Azusa \u2018Azusa-nyan\u2019!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. Because it\u2019s the same name as my favorite anime character. That girl was called Azusa too, so why not just call you Azusa-nyan? Why does it make you mad when it\u2019s an honor?\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u2026 Onii-chan, do something about her. She\u2019 s your friend, isn\u2019t she!? Take good care of her.\u201d\u2026.. And yet, the two of them have become good friends.Shiho was in my house all summer vacation. And since Azusa was also home all the time after the incident with Ryuzaki, they naturally had more opportunities to see each other. As a result, Shiho became less shy and more friendly with Azusa.Well, Azusa seems to be a little annoying, but it seems that two people of the same age somehow get along quite well. Shiho also seems to be very happy to have her first same-sex friend and is persistently involved with her.\u201cI think you should learn to be a little more reserved, Shimotsuki-san. This is not only Onii-chan\u2019s house, but also Azusa\u2019s house, you know. So, show more respect to the homeowner! Pay more attention to Azusa!\u201d\u201cAzusa-nyan? I already told you not to call me that. I feel so lonely\u2026\u2026. Why don\u2019t you feel free to call me \u2018Onee-chan\u2019? You might become my sister-in-law, so you need to start practicing now, okay?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t call you \u201cOnee-chan\u201d casually. In the first place, we are classmates and Azusa\u2019s birthday is earlier than yours, so if anything, I\u2019m the one who should be called \u2018Onee-chan\u2019!\u201dSorry to interrupt your friendly chatting, but I think it\u2019s time for me to take off my shoes.I couldn\u2019t even go inside the house because of the two of them blocking the entrance.\u201cUfufu. But Azusa-nyan is your sister role, isn\u2019t she?\u3000Then I think I should be the Onee-chan\u2026\u2026 Oh, and be careful not to spoil Kotaro-kun too much, okay? He is mine and mine alone, so I forbid even my sister to treat him casually.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the ass. Onii-chan, she\u2019s very annoying! There\u2019s a hint of yandere, and I feel like I shouldn\u2019t get too friendly with this person!\u201d\u2026..Sorry, Azusa. It\u2019s too late.Maybe I can\u2019t stay away from Shiho anymore. Or rather, I feel like Shiho won\u2019t let me go.Not that we\u2019re dating yet, and so far we\u2019ve settled on being good friends. \u2026\u2026 Still, Shiho\u2019s restraint is amazing. I was in such a bad mood just because I accepted some coins from a female clerk at a convenience store.\u201cMmmm. It\u2019s not fair of you to immediately rely on Kotaro-kun like that. It\u2019s not fair of you to make the most of your position as a younger sister\u2026\u2026, but, well, you\u2019re my younger sister too,\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Well, I guess I can forgive you for that much, can\u2019 t I?\u201d\u201cAzusa is not relying on Onii-chan. Even now, I\u2019m just complaining a little, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re close or anything.\u201d\u201cTsundere!? Kotaro-kun, I wonder if your sister has the tsundere attribute as well. This is not cute incarnate\u2026\u2026. Okay, I get it. I lose. I\u2019ll allow you to spoil Kotaro-kun for a little bit\u2026\u2026. How open-minded am I, indeed? Does this make Kotaro-kun more likable again?\u201dNo, it\u2019s too narrow.Shiho \u2026\u2026 your heart is probably narrower than a teacup.Because even though Azusa and I are siblings, we are reluctant to even have a normal conversation.This girl is still heavy with love.But, well, \u2026\u2026 I may not be ready for that either, as I find that kind of thing cute\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m so impressed that you could go to school even though it\u2019s the end of the summer vacation\u266a\u2026\u2026. Yeah, great job! I even forgot that we had school, but Kotaro-kun is so determined.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I think if anything, Shiho is the one being lazy.\u201dI\u2019m not really normal, but please don\u2019t give me credit for this.The clumsy girl is always and everywhere clumsy.

Did you get it?\u201dAs soon as we arrived at the living room, Azusa, sitting on the sofa, held out one hand and demanded snacks. She has been craving a lot of sweet things lately. I guess it\u2019s a stress reliever, but I think it\u2019s not so good for her umm\u2026\u2026 body, so I wanted her to moderate it.\u201cI did buy some, in case you\u2019re interested \u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 \u266a thanks \u2026\u2026\u2026 wow\u2026 Why is it like surume (dried squid) or vinegared kelp? I don\u2019t drink alcohol, so I don\u2019t need these snacks.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve eaten too many sweets, as expected \u2026\u2026. If you\u2019re hungry, eat your food properly.\u201d\u201cMmm \u2026\u2026 can\u2019t argue with that.\u201dDespite what she was saying, Azusa was chomping down on a small piece of surume. She looked like a small animal nibbling on a nut.\u2013And, watching the series of exchanges as a brother and sister like that, Shiho suddenly squeezed my hand.Her cheeks were swollen like a balloon.\u201cNo cheating!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 This is out too?\u201dWe just went shopping and the conversation was normal for siblings, but in Shiho\u2019s perception, it was classified as cheating.\u201cI mean, I wonder if Azusa-nyan is trying to show me how much of a sister she is by pretending to have the privilege of being a little sister to poke and prod Onii-chan \u2026\u2026. Wow, I could make Kotaro-kun lick my feet if I wanted too!\u201d\u201cWhy are you competing with me? Onii-chan, she\u2019s kind of competing with Azusa!?\u201d\u201cLook! There, there, there, there! I\u2019ll turn to you again in a minute! That\u2019s not fair\u2026\u2026. Well, I can\u2019t lose. Decided, Kotaro-kun? I\u2019m your sister today, too. I\u2019m going to show Azusa-nyan how different we are.\u201d\u201cWhy!? Hey, why is she making an enemy of Azusa!? Onii-chan doesn\u2019t belong to Azusa, nor is he exclusive to her.\u201d\u2026.. Sorry, Azusa.Shiho is just a bit, affectionate, so yeah\u2026\u2026 probably sees Azusa as a rival.Well, as you can imagine, even I didn\u2019t expect her to compete with my real sister for sisterhood.Sorry, but you\u2019re going to have to hang out with me for a bit.I\u2019m sure Shiho will be satisfied with a little bit of sisterly fun\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A sister lives to be spoiled by her brother, so there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Oh, I envy you\u2026\u2026 And by the way, Kotaro-kun? I\u2019m going to be your little sister now, so take care of me, okay?\u201dI don\u2019t want to be flattered.Well, Shiho is a bit of a weakling, but she\u2019s the type of person who gets a little carried away with people she lets her mind wander, so even if I told her I didn\u2019t want to, she wouldn\u2019t be convinced.Yeah, so I guess I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201cAzusa, I\u2019ll accompany you for a bit. Shiho, no offense, either.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too soft on her! Look at that smug look on her face! Stop making that face, it\u2019s disgusting!\u201d\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Kotaro-kun is on my side no matter what. I\u2019m going to be your little sister like that, okay? Azusa-nyan, is your position \u2026\u2026? Well, what do you say in a situation like this?\u201dMaybe \u2018threatened\u2019?It seems like she\u2019s trying to force herself to use difficult words and is not quite sure what she wants to say.\u201cAnyway! That\u2019s why, from now on, I am Kotaro-kun\u2019s younger sister\u266a. I want you to call me by my nickname like my family. Shi-chan.\u201d\u201cYeah, nice meeting you\u2026\u2026. Shi-chan?\u201d\u2026.. I\u2019m kind of embarrassed.But Shiho is very pleased with herself.She sat down next to Azusa, laughing happily.\u201cKotaro Onii-chan, please clean my ears.\u201dAnd the demands are too hard from the very first move.\u201cWait a minute! My sister wouldn\u2019t do that! I don\u2019t want people to get the wrong idea that my sister is this kind of creature.\u201d\u201cWell, is that so? I always thought we would be doing this all the time\u2026\u2026. What a pity. I imagined a life of snuggling at night, waking up together in the morning, sitting on your lap during the day, and being spoiled all the time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s not true, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, Onii-chan!?\u201dHmmm.Azusa, looking a little impatient, asked me to agree.It\u2019s true that such things don\u2019t happen these days, though.Thinking back to my junior high school days, I felt that Shiho\u2019s fantasy was not far off the mark.\u201c\u2026\u2026You know, a few years ago, we slept together.\u201dI am not good at lying, so I told the truth.When I did so, Azusa\u2019s face turned bright red, and then Shiho looked pale.\u201cNo, no, no. At that time, I was young, or rather, I was just a child, but I had no other intention.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. I had never been cuddled before either, but I guess she was taking advantage of her position as a younger sister to get all the spoils! No, he\u2019s my personal treasure, and you can\u2019t touch him anytime in the past, present, or future.\u201dJealous of past deeds too? \u2026\u2026 Well, I can\u2019t help it. Shiho is just being affectionate, so let\u2019s give up.\u201cI want to be your only sister. I will be your sister, Kotaro-kun, so you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m sure I can make the most of my sisterhood better than she can.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026. Onii-chan, she\u2019s absolutely crazy! As a family member, let me tell you, you probably shouldn\u2019t get married or anything\u2026\u2026 Onii-chan, one day you\u2019ll be locked up in a basement with a collar!\u201dThat\u2019s not true \u2013 and the fact that I can\u2019t say that is also a charm of Shiho.If that happens, well, \u2026\u2026 yeah. It\u2019s just that it can\u2019t be helped.\u201cThen it will happen.\u201d\u201cI knew you were too soft on her! Azusa doesn\u2019t like it!\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see Onii-chan killed because he was loved so much that he turned into a skeleton!\u201d\u201cUfufu. I\u2019m so happy to hear that. I think I can love you to the bone, Kotaro-kun.\u201d\u201cLook! You heard that, right! She\u2019s definitely going to make a mistake someday. Azusa warned you, right? I don\u2019t know you two anymore, okay?\u201d\u2013And so it has been since the summer break.Shiho and Azusa are somehow able to communicate with each other, or \u2026\u2026 they are so open to each other that they can complain without hesitation to each other.Thanks to this, Azusa has recovered enough to be able to speak out loud like she does now.To be honest\u2026\u2026, right after the overnight learning program \u2026\u2026, it was so painful that I couldn\u2019t even look at her, so compared to that time, Azusa is so much brighter now.After all, as her older brother, I want this girl to be happy.Although I was once cut off, I couldn\u2019t hate her enough to cut her off as a brother and sister.Whether that is right or wrong, I still can\u2019t give an answer to that question.But one thing I could say was that I was glad to see Azusa back on her feet again\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

See you tomorrow?\u3000Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go to school tomorrow. And Azusa-chan, see you tomorrow, okay? Today was fun. Thanks for chatting with me.\u201dShiho looked more satisfied than usual as she left, perhaps satisfied with her typhoon-like rampage.I waved her off and saw Azusa slumped on the sofa looking tired.\u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u2026 tired.\u201dShe seemed to be exhausted from accompanying Shiho and doing a lot of tugging and pulling.\u201cThanks for your hard work.\u201dTo show my appreciation, I take a can of juice out of the refrigerator and hand it to her.After accepting it, Azusa\u2019s eyes widened as if she suddenly realized something.\u201cOh, maybe \u2026\u2026 this kind of thing is called being \u2018spoiled\u2019?\u201dApparently, she was not aware of it. Maybe she noticed it because she was conscious of it when Shiho pointed it out to her.\u2026\u2026 Well, she has been a sister since birth \u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Being kind to her brother was probably a normal part of her daily life.She probably took it for granted that her brother would be kind to her.Or when he bought her sweets.Or when he would listen to her requests.Comforting her when she felt down.For Azusa, perhaps it was just a normal routine.And Shiho was jealous of those things.Azusa seems to have finally realized that.\u201cI see \u2026\u2026 Azusa\u2019s \u2018Onii-chan\u2019 has always been Onii-chan\u2026\u2026.\u201dLooking somewhere far away, she mumbles a few words.Then she put her canned juice on the table and looked straight at me this time.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAbruptly, Azusa bows her head.Her words were tinged with regret.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that you might not be my Onii-chan\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2013No, no, no.There\u2019s no need to apologize, Azusa \u2026\u2026.I\u2019m not your ideal \u201cOnii-chan\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for a while now, but your ideal \u2018Onii-chan\u2019 is nobody else. Of course it\u2019s not me, and it\u2019s not Ryuzaki either\u2026\u2026.The \u2018Onii-chan\u2019 Azusa is looking for is no longer available anywhere. You know that, right?\u201dIn the past, Azusa lost her own brother.Because she was unable to accept this and continued to search for \u201cOnii-chan,\u201d various distortions were created.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yeah, I know. Onii-chan is not \u2018Onii-chan\u2019. Of course, it\u2019s not Ryoma Onii-chan \u2026\u2026. Ryoma-kun? And no. Azusa\u2019s ideal Onii-chan is nowhere to be found.\u201dShe looks sad, but she is not downcast, she is looking forward and facing reality.Perhaps it is thanks to the fact that she has been alone for so long these days.She seems a little more mature or \u2026\u2026 calm and able to think things through than before.\u201cBut you see, it\u2019s different. Azusa is, you know, I\u2019m not apologizing in the sense that I want you to forgive me or anything like that\u2026\u2026. Just let me apologize for betraying your feelings, Onii-chan? You don\u2019t have to forgive. This is a clean slate\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u2013Oh, I see.I was worried about her, but it seems Azusa has already sorted out a lot of her thoughts.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said such terrible things.\u201dIt\u2019s not that she wants me to forgive her.Merely apologizing because she has done something wrong.\u201cAlso, thank you for being the \u2018Onii-chan\u2019 to this awful little sister of yours.\u201dOnce again, Azusa bows profoundly.Her sincere attitude made my cheeks loose.\u201cThere is no such thing as a person who doesn\u2019t make mistakes. And since Azusa and I are still immature teenagers, we make a lot of mistakes\u2026\u2026.\u201dSo the important thing is obviously not to apologize for your failures.I think the most important thing is to properly take the next step forward, using this failure as a source of inspiration.\u201cAzusa, you also need to properly think about where your \u201chappiness\u201d lies, okay? Don\u2019t be tied down by \u2018Onii-chan\u2019 and do your best \u2026\u2026 to make sure you get what you really want.\u201dIt means growing up.And to be grateful.Maybe that\u2019s what it means to be an adult\u2026\u2026. So, as an older brother, I was genuinely happy to see my sister grow up.\u201cI told you before, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019ll be watching over you the whole time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I told her this, Azusa\u2019s eyes suddenly became moist.But she rubbed her eyes and looked at me stoutly, trying not to cry.She doesn\u2019t break down and cry like she did when she was once dumped by Ryuzaki\u2026.Azusa is stronger now, and she\u2019s okay.\u201cOnii-chan, \u2026\u2026 Azusa, I\u2019m going to cut my hair. Do I have scissors?\u201dThen she \u2013 untied the hair string that she had tied into twin-tails.Her hair had always been the same since she was a little girl, but that seems to be the case until today.\u201cEeeeee!\u201dWith a buzz, she snips off a long strand of hair.Because she cut it herself, it is unbalanced. However, Azusa looked very refreshed.\u201cI\u2019m going to go try to get some sleep. I\u2019ll be fine now. \u2026\u2026 Azusa will go to school tomorrow, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Then you might want to adjust your hair a little more, okay? You look like a child sitting on a throne.\u201dThe slicked-back bangs and slicked-back hair remind one of a childish girl.It looks good on her, but, well\u2026\u2026, it\u2019s a little unbalanced, but since she cut it herself, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201cThen, Onii-chan do something about it?\u201dWith that said, she now tries to throw all the responsibility to me.She seems to have made up her mind, but she won\u2019t stop indulging herself in the house.\u201cI\u2019ll try \u2026\u2026, but don\u2019t get your hopes up, okay?\u201dWell, it can\u2019t be helped. No matter what they do to us, no matter how badly they treat us, the bond of brother and sister is not easily broken.Me and Azusa will always be brother and sister. That\u2019s why she will always continue to do \u2026\u2026 this way and rely on me for anything.I accepted it as I always do. I have to say, when Azusa gets spoiled by me, I can\u2019t help but accept it.Because there is no Onii-chan who can refuse a request from his sister.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wonder if something is wrong with Azusa.\u3000Isn\u2019t there something wrong with my hair?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It looks like a Kokeshi doll, but that\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?\u201dIn the end, I could not get rid of the image of being a zashiki child. I did my best to balance her hair, but I was no more skilled than that.\u201cUgh \u2026\u2026 you\u2019re so bad at this!\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you go to a hairdresser? It\u2019s your fault for leaving it up to me.\u201d\u201cI mean, it was a hassle to go out \u2026\u2026\u201dIt must have been a little over two months.It seems that Azusa has become a perfect indoor person due to the adverse effects of being a shut-in.\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018Nakayama-kun\u2019 when I\u2019m out here? I thought I was disqualified from being an Onii-chan?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I\u2019m really sorry about that. Onii-chan \u2026\u2026 whew!\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t cry, I\u2019m just kidding.\u201dI guess she really regrets it.Well, at that time, she was forced to play the character of a subheroine that only the protagonist-sama could see. I feel like she\u2019s going crazy, but I don\u2019t blame her.It\u2019s not that Azusa has suddenly changed. She has always been this kind of sister.However, I will interpret it in a good way as \u2026\u2026 that she had become cold to the people around her \u2026\u2026 because of the narrowing of her vision under the influence of the protagonist-sama \u2026\u2026.In fact, after she stopped being involved with Ryuzaki, Azusa\u2019s horizons have broadened as if the poison had been drained out of her.The fact that she has become friends with Shiho without disrespecting me is also a good thing.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Okay. Onii-chan, thanks for coming to school with me. You gave me the courage to do it! Well, Azusa\u2019s going ahead of you, okay?\u201dBut we walked together only as far as the school gate.From there, she waved at me and started running.That part of her seemed to be another growth.I\u2019m sure she would have really wanted to be with me, and it would have been upsetting not to have a presence by her side to help her if something happened to her.But instead of relying on me, she started going on her own.That seems to be a statement of intent, in other words, \u2018I can handle my own problems at school\u2019.As such, what I\u2019m trying to say is that \u2026\u2026 we don\u2019t seem to have to worry too much about Ryuzaki\u2019s case.However, the most important thing to remember is that I should watch over Azusa as I always do.With this in mind, I headed to the classroom late for Azusa.And when I entered the classroom \u2013 at that time, Azusa was already in the middle of being involved in Ryuzaki\u2019s story.\u201cAzusa!? I\u2019m so glad you finally came to school\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ve been worried about you because you haven\u2019t responded to my calls, okay? And by the way, you suddenly have a different haircut \u2026\u2026 what\u2019s going on?\u201dRyuzaki welcomed Azusa as soon as she arrived.Next to him, Mary, a new character, is also there.\u201cOH! KOKESHI! Cute! Nihihihi, this girl might be good.\u201dShe seemed to like Azusa very much, who now looks just like a kokeshi doll. She hugs her lovingly.On the other hand, Azusa, who was hugged by a stranger, was a little confused.\u201cHi, it\u2019s been a while. I was just resting because I wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I\u2019m fine \u2026\u2026 now. Who is it? Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Mary\u266a, a new student who transferred yesterday.\u3000Feel free to call me Mary Onee-chan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh, I don\u2019t want a Onee-chan.\u201dApparently Shiho has made Azusa allergic to Onee-chan. She blatantly dislikes Mary\u2019s offer.\u201cIyan~. Even when she\u2019s tsun-tsun, she\u2019s so cute.\u201dSuch Azusa must have been attractive. Mary-san was melting.Then, Mary-san\u2019s voluptuous breasts were crushed against Azusa. Seeing this, Ryuzaki\u2019s nose was stretched out.It seems that Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy has already started.Ryuzaki had been in low spirits lately, but perhaps due to Mary\u2019s influence, he was returning to his usual self.The protagonist, who has become a little more active, is also very active with Azusa.\u201cAre you feeling all right now? Damn, you had me worried there\u2026\u2026. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better! Come over to my house again and let\u2019s have dinner together!\u201dSoon, Azusa is about to get involved in Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy again.Although she has been rejected before, \u2026\u2026 however, Azusa is in a more advantageous position than the other harem members in that she has confessed her feelings.Ryuzaki must also like Azusa for confessing to him. As proof of this, Azusa\u2019s seat, which has been dormant for a long time, is still right next to Ryuzaki\u2019s.Just the other day, when Mary asked to sit next to Ryuzaki, he asked Kirari, not Azusa, to move out of the way. He must have such strong feelings for Azusa.But \u2026\u2026 Azusa is no longer the same Azusa that Ryuzaki knows and loves.\u201cOh, by the way, Mary-chan is in this seat. \u2026\u2026 Azusa is over here, right? If so, what about Kirari-chan?\u201dShe had a broader perspective on things, after all.She is firmly aware that Kirari\u2019s seat is not there.\u201cOh, about that. Mary just transferred to a new school, so she\u2019s going to need a lot of help, right? I\u2019m supposed to take that role, so I\u2019m sorry Kirari had to switch seats for a bit.\u201dOf course, Ryuzaki, who sees nothing wrong with that, explains it matter-of-factly.But for Azusa, who was a subheroine, she must have realized how cruel that was.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Kirari-chan, you look sad.\u201dMuttering.Azusa looked at Kirari with a pained expression as she pretended not to hear her from a seat away.\u201cEh? Excuse me?\u201dWell, the deaf and insensitive protagonist did not hear such words.\u201cKirari-chan!\u201dAzusa also seemed to understand that talking to Ryuzaki was not going to get her anywhere.She ended the conversation early and headed toward Kirari, who was at a distance.Then she said something like this\u201cLet\u2019s trade seats. Azusa is more comfortable in the back, may we?\u201dThe proposal was clearly not in Azusa\u2019s favor.If the seats are moved away from each other here, the advantage of being in an advantageous position in the Ryuzaki harem will not be demonstrated. Even though the protagonist-sama had gone to the trouble of caring for her, Azusa was about to give up that weapon herself.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Eh?\u201dKirari is also taken aback, as if bewildered.That is understandable. Because what she just said was \u2026\u2026 like Azusa was trying to get out of the harem.(I see. Azusa has already made up her mind\u2026\u2026)I\u2019ve always wondered what she would do, though.After her failed confession, Azusa seems to have decided \u2026\u2026 to stop being a convenient heroine for Ryuzaki.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Especially for heroines in harem romantic comedies, it is more advantageous to be as close to the protagonist as possible, so it is only natural that they should be seated next to each other.After all, the more heroines there are, the fewer appearances they make. In order to make your presence felt, the difference between winning and losing depends on how well you can interact with the protagonist in casual, everyday situations.So, in a sense, the \u201cseat change\u201d is a battle for the girls.\u201cAzusa. Did you feel sorry for me? Then don\u2019t do it\u2026\u2026. It will make me more miserable than I already am.\u201dKirari seems to be so frustrated at being so far from her seat that she can\u2019t honestly accept the suggestion. Clearly, she rejects it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Ah.\u201dAzusa, timid at heart, was put off by these strong emotions.She looks at me as if asking for help.I can\u2019t help her blatantly at school, though.But, well\u2026\u2026 it would be nice if I could just move around a bit and approach Azusa.I don\u2019t \u2026\u2026 do anything, but I can just be there for her.With that excuse, I casually approached Azusa and Kirari. Since I was originally a mob character, my presence was quite small. Kirari, Ryuzaki, and Mary didn\u2019t seem to mind my moving around.That is very convenient.(Keep up the good work!)I give a shout out in my heart.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Phew.\u201dPerhaps she got the message, Azusa glanced at me and relaxed her tense expression.One deep breath in between. Then she looked at Kirari again and continued her words, defeated.\u201cIt\u2019s not pity. You know that \u2026\u2026 Azusa confessed her feelings, right?\u201dAzusa\u2019s voice is so quiet that only Kirari can hear her.Thanks to her proximity, I can hear her, but Mary and Ryuzaki, who are a little further away, probably can\u2019t.\u201c\u2026.. I know, in case you\u2019re wondering.\u201d\u201cThen you know I was dumped, right?\u201d\u201cUmmm, yeah\u2026\u2026 what the hell? What\u2019s your point?\u201dAzusa is no longer timid.Rather, Kirari looked more puzzled and strong-willed.\u201cSo it\u2019s a little awkward for me to be in that seat, \u2026\u2026 Azusa no longer bothers you \u2026\u2026? We promised to fight fair and square, but \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t do my best anymore.\u201dAzusa laughs with a powerless smile.With those words, Kirari finally understood what she was trying to say.\u201cWait, that\u2019s \u2026\u2026 really okay!? It would be a waste to give up just because of one failed attempt after working so hard until now! Azu-chan, \u2026\u2026 can you be satisfied with such an outcome?\u201dThe subheroines have a bond with each other because they have been warriors who have fought each other all their lives.That is why Kirari looked more frustrated than before. No, she looked angry.Kirari\u2019s emotional voice, unlike Azusa\u2019s, echoed loudly in the classroom.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on!? Hey, Kirari \u2026\u2026 Azusa is sick, so don\u2019t be too hard on her.\u201dThe words sounded as if they were fighting, and Ryuzaki immediately interrupted to intercede.But even so, Kirari seems to be unable to stop.\u201cShut up! Ryu-kun, shut up.\u201dKirari is so sad for Azusa that she yells at her beloved Ryuzaki.\u201cAzu-chan, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to ask you one more time, are you sure you want to do this? Does this mean you\u2019re satisfied?\u201dIt\u2019s as if \u2026\u2026 Azusa has a future self to lament over.Kirari looked sad.But Azusa\u2019s answer did not change.\u201cYes. It\u2019s okay \u2026\u2026 Kirari-chan, hang in there. I can\u2019t share your feelings anymore, but I\u2019ll be rooting for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2013!\u201dKirari suddenly looks like she is about to cry at the healthy yell.But it was only for a moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Right. Then, I\u2019ll be grateful and ask you to give up your seat. Thank you, Azu-chan, \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll do my best. I\u2019m not going to end up like you.\u201dThis time, in a quiet voice.After replying in a volume that was just loud enough to reach Ryuzaki, Kirari took her luggage and headed for Azusa\u2019s seat.\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026 sorry.\u201dAt her back, Azusa was laughing and apologizing with a sad face, but Kirari did not look back anymore.\u201cOh, hey! Kirari, what were you talking about? Your voice was so low, I couldn\u2019t really hear you\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd the hard-of-hearing protagonist apparently couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, as he should have.I had to strain my ears \u2026\u2026 No, I just had to concentrate a little and I could have heard him, even though his voice was loud enough to be audible.That\u2019s why you\u2019re no good.(Damn \u2026\u2026 you\u2019re getting on my nerves.)In my mind, my language spills out.The arrogant way of easily stepping on the feelings of the girls who so plainly tell you how much they love you is terribly offensive.Now, the heroine who loved you just got off the stage, you know?They\u2019ve already given up on being happy in your romantic comedy and walked out of the story.And yet, to be able to say that he doesn\u2019t notice because he is insensitive is \u2026\u2026 really arrogant of you, protagonist-sama\u2026\u2026.I really think so.I hate this guy after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I like cereal, don\u2019t you?Thus, one girl left the harem members.Will this be the first retiree in Ryoma Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAzusa is sitting at the very back by the window \u2013 the so-called protagonist\u2019s seat \u2013 and looks downcast and depressed.She was trying her best to talk back to Kirari earlier, but she must be tired now.Good job \u2026\u2026 Azusa did a great job.I agree wholeheartedly. If I could, I would call out to him and help him. But if I talk to Azusa here, she will be conscious of Ryuzaki.Since the incident at the overnight learning program, he never speaks to me, but he has become blatantly conscious of me. When I suddenly notice him, he is staring at me, and to be honest, it is uncomfortable.Right now, the person Azusa most does not want to be seen by me is probably Ryuzaki himself.So all I could do was watch from a little distance.\u201cHey, Kirari \u2026\u2026, what were you talking with Azusa about\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s none of Ryu-kun\u2019s business.\u201d\u201cOh my, \u2026\u2026 I would have loved to play more with Kokeshi-chan.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not satisfied with me?\u201d\u2026\u2026 Well, Ryuzaki\u2019s group is a little rough around the edges, so Azusa will probably be fine.With that in mind, I returned to my seat.But I still couldn\u2019t help but be concerned about the depressed Azusa.Just then, it was time.\u201cOh, good morning.\u201dSuddenly, I received a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and there was Shiho, who had arrived at school just in time to be late.She was probably worried about the way her classmates were looking at her, since it had been a long time since she had been to school\u2026\u2026. She is acting suspiciously and is not speaking properly.She was still the same shy, pompous girl.She was in such a good mood at my house, but it is a huge gap.\u201cSleepy, sleepy, quiet.\u201dHmmm\u2026I see.[\u201cI didn\u2019t oversleep, isn\u2019t that great?\u201d]Translated, it would probably be something like this.\u201c\u2026\u2026 How did you manage to get up? Shiho is so awesome.\u201dShe seemed to want praise, so I sent her a word of praise, and immediately she was in a good mood.\u201cUfufu \u266a\u201dPutting her hand over her mouth and smiling elegantly, she sat down.The corner on the corridor side is already becoming her permanent position.It seems that Suzuki-sensei had appreciated Shiho\u2019s work in creating the raffle for the seat change, and she continues to do so now. Since then, she has been cheating all around. The fact that we have been in the same seat since June, next to each other, and separated from Ryuzaki is the result of Shiho\u2019s deviousness, not luck.This deviousness is also her charm. Shiho is as cute as ever.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201dShe talked to me for a bit and \u2026\u2026 no, I didn\u2019t talk to her, but apparently Shiho\u2019s awkwardness has eased somewhat because of the communication. She was able to speak properly in my ear.\u201cI\u2019m a Onee-chan, I\u2019m going to go say hi to my sister.\u201dAfter uttering the words with a damp breath, Shiho gets up from her seat and goes to Azusa.\u201cHugu.\u201dOh, she fell down. Now she looks at me with tears in her eyes. No, I can\u2019t help it if they see me. \u2026\u2026 I wonder if I should do something. I made a clenched fist to encourage her to do her best for now, and Shiho gave a small nod and stood up again. I felt like I was cheering for a toddler walking for the first time.\u2013Shiho is a special child after all.I really feel that way when I look at her.Because, although a serious air was prevailing until a while ago, a comical wind was flowing in after her arrival.It was as if the dark sky had somehow become brighter.I feel such a dazzling morning glow from Shiho.And it seemed to warm even Azusa\u2019s cold heart.\u201cWait, what? What a sudden earful. \u2026\u2026 What? Good morning? That\u2019s it? Not that there is anything else I want to talk about. \u2026\u2026 No, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s not like I want to spoil you or anything! I mean, you\u2019re not a Onee-chan, Shimotsuki-san!\u201dAzusa, who had been depressed, cheerfully raises her voice.Her face looked somewhat disgusted, but \u2026\u2026 it was so much brighter than the depressed expression she had earlier.I get it. Azusa must feel very saved by Shiho now.I used to be depressed all the time. I hated myself as a mob character and kept looking down.Shiho was there for me at that time. She talked to me a lot and shared her energy with me.It was a few months ago, but I haven\u2019t forgotten the feelings I had at that time.Shiho breaks the serious mood. Whenever I talk to her, my mind becomes more positive.So I am sure Azusa will be fine too.(Thank you, Shiho \u2026\u2026)In my heart, I send my thanks.You cheered up Azusa and made me feel better.How could she be such a good girl?There is no way a sane upbringing could have led to such a lovely human being.Where did Shiho Shimotsuki\u2019s charm come from?I was a little curious about that, too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe the episode is about who she is and how she loves Ryuzaki.How the story will turn out this time, though, is still hard to predict.For now, if I\u2019m not going to be in the show, I should take a good rest and not think about that guy.Maybe now is the time for Shiho and I to move forward with our romantic comedy.If there is someone reading my story \u2026\u2026.Please forgive me for the slow pace of progress and the flat story with no peaks and valleys\u2026.(TLN: -___- )\u201cKotaro-kun. Will you come over to my house today?\u201dIt was after school.As usual, I was walking home with Shiho to the bus stop when she suddenly made such a suggestion.\u201cActually, my dad won a judo tournament, so my mom is cooking a feast for him. The three of us can\u2019t eat all of it, so I\u2019d love it if you could help, too, Kotaro-kun. How about it? You always let me play at your house, so can I return the favor once in a while?\u201d\u2026.. That\u2019s not a fair way to ask.I couldn\u2019t say no to that innocent smile.Azusa often tells me that \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m basically lenient when it comes to \u2026\u2026 Shiho.I tended to allow this girl to do whatever she wanted.The \u2026\u2026 truth is, it\u2019s a little scary. Shiho is definitely doting on me, and I could be seen in a bad light as a man who messed with their daughter.I don\u2019t want her family to reject me. If possible, I need a little more time.But I feel it would be a shame to let this opportunity pass me by. I was curious to know what kind of parents Shiho was raised by.What kind of parents would the parents of such a wonderful girl be like?I was also curious about that \u2013 so I ended up accepting her offer.\u201cReally!? I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re coming\u266a! I really wanted to invite you earlier, but Kotaro-kun is such a self-denying jerk, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be willing to come. So I\u2019m glad I was finally able to invite you!\u201d\u2026\u2026Well, well, aside from the fact that I\u2019m a jerk\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the evening or so. And, you must invite Azu-chan, too, okay? She seems to want to be spoiled by her Onee-chan, so I have no choice but to bother her.\u201d\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll invite Azusa, too.\u201dAfter exchanging such conversation, I returned home at once.When I got home, Azusa was already in the living room eating sweets, so I immediately told her that we had been invited to Shiho\u2019s house.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. I don\u2019t want a onee-chan! To Shimotsuki-san, \u201cPoo!\u201d I\u2019ll tell them that, okay?\u201dShe had a tremendous rejection of Shiho.\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re not in \u2026\u2026 elementary school, you know.Hmmm, oh well.Azusa has become a recluse lately and probably doesn\u2019t want to go outside.That\u2019s why I decided to leave her behind this time.I had no choice but to go to Shiho\u2019s house alone. I know her house because I have been there once. I walked her home when I met her for the first time. Of course, I didn\u2019t go inside.Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t seen her house since then.\u201c\u2026 Fu.\u201dThe time was just after 18:00. As I arrive, I take a deep breath and then ring the intercom.The front door opened immediately.\u201cHi there, good evening.\u201dAnd then, the one who appeared \u2013 a beautiful woman with silver hair.\u201c\u2026\u201dI gasp.At first glance, I knew.This is Shiho\u2019s mother, \u2026\u2026 and like her, her looks are out of the ordinary.\u201cAre you the Kotaro-kun that Shi-chan was talking about?\u201dShiho\u2019s mother speaks kindly to me as I am nervous.Then she gives me a small smile.\u201cNice to meet you, my name is Satsuki Shimotsuki. I\u2019m Shi-chan\u2019s mother\u2026\u2026. Come on in, why don\u2019t you come on up? Shi-chan is waiting for you inside, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThat being said, I couldn\u2019t say anything for a while.As a man, you can\u2019t help but be transfixed.I couldn\u2019t help but surrender to her presence, as if she were so different from me.I know this because I am a born mob character.This person used to be a main heroine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hair that bounced as she walked was so beautiful.Compared to Shiho\u2019s hair, the silver was a little darker?Her long hair was lightly wavy, and the hairstyle suited her well. She looked like a model, \u2026\u2026 but she was wearing a Bear Mark apron \u2026\u2026, which made her look less flashy.But still, \u2026\u2026 she looks very young. It would not be out of place if someone said she was a high school student.I think the person in front of me now is really attractive as a woman.For a few seconds, when she invites me into her house and leads me into the living room.Just by looking at her back for that long, she was so beautiful that a normal human being would not be able to have normal feelings about her.That much charm would send chills down your spine.Shiho\u2019s mother was so inhuman that I wondered if she was really a human being.Her name, it seems, is Satsuki. It is strange that her name is Japanese, even though she looks so un-Japanese.\u201c\u2026Hmm? Staring so hard, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dPerhaps it was because I was staring too hard.She seemed bothered by my gaze and stopped to look back.Her blue eyes stared at me, and my body tensed up.The beauty, which reminded me of a Western doll, made me want to run away from her.\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s nothing\u2026.\u201dI look away and take a step back.I unconsciously tried to keep my distance.Seeing me like that, Shiho\u2019s mother \u2013 Satsuki-san rounded her eyes as if she was a little surprised.\u201cOh, dear? Hmmm\u2026I see\u2026\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s my daughter indeed. Looks like you\u2019ve brought an interesting person with you.\u201dI wonder how I appeared in her eyes.Satsuki-san gave me a curious look and gently tapped my shoulder.\u201cI wonder if Kotaro is not good with me? It would be sad if you were so wary of me.\u201d\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not the case\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not good with her.Of course it\u2019s impossible for me to dislike her.But I\u2019m kind of \u2026\u2026 in awe. I doubt if it\u2019s really allowed for me to talk to this person.\u201cI see. Kotaro doesn\u2019t hate me, he hates himself, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe unexpected words made my heart jump.It was right on the mark. I was at a loss for words because I had clearly been hit by a certainty.It is true that I have low self-esteem.I always put in the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m nothing, but\u2026\u201d and it makes me feel downhearted.Satsuki recognized this in our first meeting.\u201cHow did you \u2026\u2026 know?\u201d\u201cSmell, maybe? I am naturally sensitive to smell. So, I\u2019m kind of sensitive to the other person\u2019s emotions? I\u2019m sorry, that was a weird thing to say.\u201d\u2026\u2026 No, I understand.Somehow, I understood what Satsuki meant.Shiho also often says, \u2018I have a good hearing\u2019.Perhaps that unusual sense is inherited from her mother.She even once described Ryuzaki as \u2018not good at it because it sounds disgusting\u2019. In the same way, Satsuki may be able to get an impression of someone by their smell.\u201cMost people, when they see me, smell a little funny, \u2026\u2026 and you don\u2019t, so I was surprised.\u201d\u2026.. Oh, that\u2019s what you mean.You looked surprised earlier, so I wondered what was going on, but I was relieved to see that it wasn\u2019t for any \u2026\u2026 significant reason.In other words, Satsuki is too beautiful.This is only a prediction, but \u2026\u2026 probably, if a normal person sees Satsuki, he/she will be first and foremost stimulated emotionally.If you are a man, your ulterior motive will be stimulated.If you are a woman, you may feel jealousy.That\u2019s how out of the ordinary she is.However, due to my own lowly nature and my former mob character, I did not have the sexual disposition to have an ulterior motive.So I was not lustful, nor jealous and disgusted, but simply overwhelmed by her presence.Well, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m an amazing person because I just have no personality.\u201cFrom Kotaro, I can smell the scent of a modest person, \u2026\u2026 a nice person, so he should have more confidence in himself.\u201dBut Satsuki-san appreciated me for that.\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of boy Shi-chan likes. \u2026\u2026 My husband smells wonderful, too, but he may have a different charm.\u201dThen she smiled, this time with an innocent smile.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dNot good. I felt out of place and broke out in a cold sweat.I knew that someone like me would be too intimidated to talk to Satsuki-san.\u3000 And to have her smile at me \u2013 I felt like that shouldn\u2019t be the case.If such a person was at school with me, I would be horrified just thinking about it. I\u2019m sure many boys have fallen in love and been crushed.\uff08I wonder if Shiho\u2019s out-of-this-world charm is inherited from her.)I finally understand how the beauty and magical charm that drove that harem-minded protagonist crazy came about \u2013 and why.Satsuki-san\u2019s blood makes the clunker of a woman, Shiho, the main heroine.If you think about it, Shiho is a little \u2026\u2026, no, a lot too clumsy to be the main heroine.Study, exercise, housework, conversation, etc. \u2026\u2026 Shiho has too many genres she is not good at for a main heroine.Under normal circumstances, Shiho would be a sub heroine in the \u201d attractive \u201d category at best. But Satsuki\u2019s blood pushes her to be a main heroine.But \u2013 then a question came to my mind.(Then why is Shiho so approachable?)I\u2019m sorry Satsuki-san, but \u2026\u2026 she is so beautiful that just standing in front of me, I feel as if my dirtiness is highlighted.So she is not an easy person to relate to.Of course, that is not to say that she is unfriendly. She has a soft atmosphere and does not give off a cold impression at all. But I feel a bit intimidated.Yet, Shiho didn\u2019t make me nervous from the first meeting.How can I say \u2026\u2026 Shiho is a little strange even as a normal heroine.She is \u201cspecial\u201d.I thought about it and couldn\u2019t figure out why, but shortly after \u2026\u2026, I showed up in the living room and it all worked out.\u201cYes, come in. It\u2019s our living room\u2026\u2026. And that\u2019s my husband. \u266a\u201dImmediately, Satsuki-san\u2019s voice rises. She had been calm earlier, but as soon as she opened the door to the living room, her intensity rose.Perhaps it was \u2013 the bulky man sitting on the sofa was the reason.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Oh? You\u2019re here already? Welcome \u2026\u2026 Kotaro, right? My daughter is always indebted to you.\u201dI was taken aback by the sight of that colossal, well-rounded person.(This is the person \u2026\u2026 who made Shiho \u2018special\u2019!)\u2013Gentle.\u2013Warm.\u2013Soft.\u2013Reassuring.\u2013Calm.The expression, the voice, the gaze, the gestures, the body shape, the atmosphere \u2026\u2026 everything was just gentle.Absolutely, it was this person.The reason why Shiho is so friendly is because of him.I have never seen such a person.Just by being around him, I felt such warmth that I naturally relaxed \u2026\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kotaro-kun, I hope you will not be too nervous today and take it easy.\u201d\u2013I think it is wrong using this kind of expression for an older man.Somehow, I thought he was a cute uncle.He was an ordinary-looking man with dark hair and dark eyes. If I had been a child, I would have definitely poked his tummy.If I were to use a metaphor, it would be a balloon.It is round, fluffy, and very soothing to look at.Such a person seems to be Shiho\u2019s father.I wonder how old he is.He looks young or middle-aged, but I think it could be taken either way.Satsuki is quite youthful, so he looks older relatively speaking. It seems like they are pretty far apart in age \u2026\u2026 Hmmm, I wasn\u2019t sure.Well, I don\u2019t really care about age.They love each other and are married.

Let\u2019s have a little chat, man to man. Oh, I don\u2019t mean that in a weird way, okay? I\u2019m not so hot-blooded that I would say that you can\u2019t touch my daughter.\u201dShaking his plump belly, Itsuki-san laughs.\u201cI see. Kotaro, do you hear that? He is not a very hot-blooded man. But he is not cold-blooded either, okay Don\u2019t get that part wrong, okay?\u201dSeeing him like this, Satsuki was entranced.The calm atmosphere she had earlier had blown away somewhere, and she looked like a little girl who had met the prince of her dreams.\u201cOh \u2026\u2026, maybe. Whenever I ask you, you must be happy that Kotaro is here, right?\u3000You know, we wanted to have a son, too~.\u201d\u201cOf course. Well, we don\u2019t know yet whether Kotaro-kun will be our son or not, so let\u2019s not say anything that will put pressure on him. \u2026\u2026 Sorry, Kotaro-kun. I hope you don\u2019t have to worry about anything today.\u201dHis beaming smile almost relaxed my body.Perhaps because I was quite nervous in front of Satsuki, I almost collapsed at the gap. As it was, I sat down on the sofa opposite of Itsuki-san.\u201cI\u2019m going to check on Shi-chan, so you two can chat, okay?\u201d\u201cI understand. Phew, now we can finally have a man-to-man conversation.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026. I\u2019m disturbing you, aren\u2019t I? Hmmm \u2026\u2026 remember me later.\u201d\u2026\u2026They get along so well. You can tell from every word they speak that they both care about each other.It was the ideal way to be a married couple.To be honest, I am also quite concerned about them.Satsuki-san and Itsuki-san\u2026\u2026 come to think of it, they have similar names, but I wonder if there is a reason for that. I\u2019m sure they would tell me if I asked them, but we\u2019ve never met before and I don\u2019t want to go into it too much.Itsuki-san seems kind, though, so I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be a jerk about it.It seems a little different to take advantage of that kindness.This is only our first meeting\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a chance to have a deeper conversation at a later date.There is more to do today than that.That is to let them know about me.It\u2019s only natural, since I\u2019m friends with their daughter Shiho.As a parent, you must be wondering what kind of person your daughter\u2019s friend is.\u201cSo, Kotaro-kun\u2026\u201dImmediately, Itsuki-san is trying to ask about me.I don\u2019t want to give a bad impression as much as possible, but there is no point in lying, so I will answer truthfully\u2013that\u2019s what I thought and braced myself for it.However, Itsuki-san was \u2026\u2026 kind, after all.\u201cKotaro-kun, what kind of food do you like?\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhen he asked me, I was out of the loop.I had expected to be asked about hobbies, grades, future dreams, \u2026\u2026 and other such status information, but what Itsuki-san wanted to know was something trivial.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t like food? Sorry, Uncle loves to eat, so we tend to talk about food all the time.\u201d\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t dislike it. Let\u2019s see, \u2026\u2026 I think egg rolls are delicious.\u201dWhat I was remembering was the egg rolls from the bento that Shiho and I would share at lunchtime. All of Satsuki\u2019s homemade dishes are delicious, but I think the egg rolls that are always included are somehow the best.\u201cOh, we are on the same page. Uncle likes egg rolls, too. Then there is fried chicken, curry, meat, fish, vegetables, carbohydrates, and noodles.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that all of it?\u201d\u201cOh, yes, I do. I don\u2019t have likes and dislikes, that\u2019s what\u2019s good about being an uncle.\u201dI guess it\u2019s \u2026\u2026.It\u2019s a very relaxing conversation.The good-natured smile, the gentle tone of his voice, and the rounded visuals make me feel naturally relaxed.\u201cKotaro-kun, do you like to study? My daughter seems to hate it, but you don\u2019t have to work too hard, right It\u2019s worse for your health if you push yourself too hard.\u201d\u201cI wonder if you like playing games or not? My daughter seems to love it, and I can get her to play with me, but I can\u2019t keep up with the youngsters\u2019 sensibilities \u2026\u2026, so lately you\u2019ve been playing with her, and it\u2019s been a big help.\u201d\u201cKotaro, do you like the heat? Uncle hates it because he has this look. I\u2019m always in my fat, so it\u2019s too hot for me in the summer. It\u2019s almost fall, so it\u2019s finally time for uncle.\u201d\u2013Every conversation I had with Itsuki-san was like this.This person, it seems, is not really interested in my status, position, or standing.What he wanted to know was the \u2018humanity\u2019 of \u2026\u2026 me.He is especially interested in \u2018what I like\u2019. Thanks to this, I was forced to think only about what I like, which naturally made me feel more cheerful.He is a strange person, \u2026\u2026 really.I feel comfortable and pleasant to be with him. It goes beyond the level of friendliness and so on.He is just so kind.Anyway, warm.He was inclusive enough to convince me that it was because he was that kind of person that he was loved by the main heroine, \u2026\u2026 Satsuki-san.Surely, the romantic comedy could not have been framed as ordinary.Satsuki is such a demanding main heroine. She is so complete as a character that even Ryuzaki, let alone me, could not intervene in her romantic comedy.The man who loved her and made her happy was Itsuki-san.What kind of a person is he?I think there is more to him than just being kind.I wanted to know that, too.Someday, when I\u2019m able to \u201clove\u201d that girl, the main heroine, with my \u2026\u2026 heart in my \u2026\u2026 chest, I\u2019d like to use her as a reference\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s so good about this girl who is so unsociable and doesn\u2019t talk much? Is it her face? Then why didn\u2019t he thank my mom and dad for giving me the genes, instead of me?\u201d]Looking back, I guess this was the solution.Shiho\u2019s attractiveness is strongly influenced by her father and mother.I had always wondered.Shiho is so cute, but she doesn\u2019t boast about it. No, she understands that she is cute, but I get the feeling that she doesn\u2019t consider it her strong point.Likewise, she didn\u2019t care about that at all, even though she is a special main heroine.Perhaps it\u2019s because it\u2019s a \u2018given\u2019.She didn\u2019t get it through hard work. She was just born with it, so she probably wouldn\u2019t be very happy if someone complimented her on it.No matter how \u2018cute\u2019 Ryuzaki thinks she is, it\u2019s because of her father and mother, so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s getting recognition for it.She doesn\u2019t feel as if she is loved by the protagonist, because she didn\u2019t want to be the main heroine.If that\u2019s the way I\u2019m thinking \u2013 it kind of makes sense that Shiho chose me.The friend, Kotaro Nakayama, is a \u2018friend\u2019 she has acquired with her own hands.Regardless of factors such as facial attractiveness or the fact that she is the main heroine, I became her friend.I think that made me \u201cspecial\u201d to Shiho.(Shiho must have grown up to be such a nice girl because her wonderful parents gave her lots of love and affection.)I felt I understood one more thing about Shiho.Her charm attracted me even more.[\u201cDo you want to know more about me? You\u2019re going to love me more and more, okay?\u201d]Once, when I tried to confess my feelings, she told me that she didn\u2019t want to be lighthearted.I\u2019ve been with Shiho ever since, but as \u2026\u2026 she wanted me to, I\u2019ve been loving her more and more.The story is still monotonous, though.In a normal romantic comedy, there would have been a clash between Shiho\u2019s parents and me, but Shimotsuki\u2019s parents accepted me kindly.Thanks to that, my conflicted moments never came at all.The romantic comedy with Shiho continued to be a happy affair.\u201cOh, Kotaro-kun! Sorry I\u2019m late, okay? You know what, I helped with the dishes today, too, right? I asked my mom to help me and I did my best, so eat a lot, okay? Or do you want me to feed you? I\u2019m going to \u2018Ahhh\u2019 you just like Mom does to Dad, okay?\u201d\u2026\u2026 See, this is how she still does it now, giving me a nice smile\u2026\u2026.While I was talking with Itsuki-san in the living room, Shiho finally came to me after all the preparations.\u201cOh? Were you talking to my dad? Ummm, isn\u2019t my dad wonderful? Oh, did you talk to Mom, too? My mom is a little shy, so she gets nervous when she meets new people. So, please tolerate her, okay?\u201d\u2026\u2026 No, she wasn\u2019t any clunkier than Shiho, though\u2026\u2026I did get the impression that she was fearful when I first met her, but her expression softened a lot after she joined with Itsuki-san. Satsuki is a genuine main heroine, so she will inevitably not be able to be her usual self except in front of her main character, and I don\u2019t blame her.\u201cShiho is right that you two are very nice people.\u201dWhen I honestly told them this, Shiho\u2019s cheeks immediately relaxed.With a big smile on her face, she jumped up and down happily.\u201cYes! Ehehe~!\u201dShiho is as pleased as if it were her own to receive compliments about her parents.She was still cute, after all\u2013she was such a sweetheart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are currently on a business trip overseas, leaving me and Azusa behind.They do the bare minimum for us, and we have never had any financial difficulties, so I am grateful to them. But I would be lying if I said I don\u2019t feel lonely sometimes.(Maybe I should bring Azusa with me next time.)I would love for her to come. I am sure Itsuki and Satsuki would accept Azusa kindly.\u2013I was thinking about that as I headed back home.After saying goodbye to Shiho and her parents, I was walking alone in the night.The time was 8:30 p.m. Since it was a little late, Satsuki offered to drive me home, but I declined.I felt like walking.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026.\u201dI take a breath and inhale the slightly cooler air. I cooled my burning body and caught my breath.September. It is almost the time for autumn to arrive. It used to be hot even at this time of the day not long ago, but recently it has become more comfortable.The temperature is just right for relaxing without thinking about anything.So I walked around in a daze. Well, it\u2019s not a big distance since I only have to walk to the bus stop. I soon arrived at the nearest bus stop and sat down on a bench to wait.\u2013And just then, I saw something.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Hmm?\u201dA black limousine, looking very expensive, slowly passed in front of me.The car looked out of place in the quiet residential area. I had only seen them on TV, so I was looking at it, thinking how amazing it was. \u2026\u2026About ten meters ahead, the limousine stopped.Then a man in a suit comes out of the driver\u2019s seat. He was a classy-looking old man who opened the back passenger door with a relaxed gesture.And out of it came a beautiful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl.\u201cSeriously?\u2026\u2026\u201dI was struck by the Western-style beauty, with her well-built body and striking aura of cleverness.There is no doubt about it. She was Mary, the new heroine.I never expected to meet her.\u201cHello\u266a\u2026 What a coincidence on a night like this, right?\u201dAnd she was talking to me.\u201cEh? Ummm\u2026..\u201dThe unexpected event makes me falter in my response.Because I have no contact with her. We have never exchanged a single word at school, but she suddenly spoke to me\u2026.. It is natural to be surprised.Seeing me like that, Mary laughed.\u2019\u201cOh, no? Is it that surprising that I spoke to you? Or are you surprised because you didn\u2019t think \u2026\u2026 I recognized your existence? But we\u2019re classmates, so isn\u2019t it obvious that I should at least remember your name and face?\u201dMary, who shrugged her shoulders, looked a little different than she did when she was in front of \u2026\u2026 Ryuzaki.She looks a lot more innocent when she\u2019s in contact with that guy. She exudes a \u201cforeign girl\u2019s\u201d air of generosity and innocence, but she didn\u2019t look so much like that now.\u201cAnd \u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve been wondering about you. \u2026\u2026. Hey, Kotaro?\u201dName, called.The new heroine, who had quickly appeared as the new heroine and is currently the closest to the protagonist, recognizes my presence.That was very eerie.\u201cI\u2019m just saying, since we\u2019re here, why don\u2019t I give you a ride? I\u2019ll drop you off?\u201d\u2013I knew that Ryuzaki\u2019s story would not leave me alone.The new heroine\u2019s forceful appearance and her implied lines made me sigh.I really don\u2019t want to be with her, but I\u2019m sure \u2026\u2026the story won\u2019t let me.I\u2019ve been the villain for Ryoma Ryuzaki ever since the overnight learning program incident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was uncomfortable for a commoner by nature.\u201cWhy was Kotaro in such a place? Your house isn\u2019t around here, is it?\u201dThe car drives off slowly.Mary huddled close to me and spoke to me.I don\u2019t think I should bother sitting next to her since it\u2019s such a big car, \u2026\u2026 and if I got too friendly with other girls, that cute little girl would get jealous, so I kept a good distance from her.About two seats apart, then I answer her question.\u201cI was visiting my friend Shiho \u2026\u2026 Shiho Shimotsuki\u2019s house. My house is indeed a bit far from here, \u2026\u2026 but how do you know that?\u201dNow it\u2019s my turn to return a question.It is inexplicable. Mary, who had been acting as if she didn\u2019t know anything about me, had identified not only my name but also my address. That was eerie.\u201cWhat if I told you that I have a thirst for knowledge?\u201d\u201cI would reply, [\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d].\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not very perceptive, are you? I mean, it\u2019s uncomfortable to not know something, so I make an effort to know everything\u2026\u2026. See, my parents are the only people who have money, which means their daughter, me, can use it to do a lot of things.\u201dShe gives a twisted answer, yet roundabout way.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that \u2026\u2026 you know the personal information of someone as humble as me? I take it that you\u2019re interpreting that to mean that you\u2019ve looked into \u2026\u2026 in a dirty, paid-for way that\u2019s hard to talk about\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\u201cWell? I didn\u2019t say that much, but if you want to think so, I won\u2019t deny it. Anyway, the process may be different, but the result is the same. Maybe I know more about Kotaro than you think I do?\u201dWith that, Mary crossed her legs.Her school uniform was unchanged, but her short skirt revealed her firm thighs. If I were Ryuzaki, I would have turned up my nose at this sight, but for me, with my low sexual appetite, it was of no importance.I immediately removed my eyes from her thighs.Seeing this, Mary was somehow nodding her head.\u201cHeh, \u2026\u2026 Kotaro is not interested in a girl\u2019s body? I think a normal boy would be a little more delirious now that he can be alone with me.\u201d(TLN: Hoes mad.)\u201c\u2026 Didn\u2019t you know that? You know more about me than I think you do, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe so, maybe not. So I\u2019ll just pretend that I just found out that Kotaro can\u2019t get through to me in a colorful way, okay?\u201dWhat a \u2026\u2026 choice of words you\u2019ve been making since a while ago, all you do is make smoke screens.She was a much brighter and more innocent character at school, very jolly and foreign, but I didn\u2019t quite recognize her now.Is this the real Mary?Is that overly bright, noisy, high-strung character that she plays in front of Ryuzaki a lie?\u201cHihi. You\u2019re surprised, aren\u2019t you \u2026\u2026 No, you\u2019re confused, aren\u2019t you? Was Kotaro mistaken about me? What kind of person did you think I was? Well, I won\u2019t tell you the correct answer yet, but I will give you a hint. I am not what you think I am.\u201dDoes that mean that Mary I have in mind isn\u2019t really Mary or is she?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tell me all your principles, thoughts, ideas, philosophies, theories, everything? And will you satisfy my thirst for knowledge? Otherwise, I can\u2019t stand it. I might be tempted to do something that would tickle Ryoma\u2019s jealousy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Does that mean you\u2019re going to talk to me at school and have Ryuzaki see that you\u2019re doing it?\u201d\u201cYes? For example, I wonder if I could hug or something in front of \u2026\u2026 Ryoma? I\u2019m sure Ryoma would be uncomfortable if I did that. He might say, \u201cYou took away my love again,\u201d right?\u201d\u2013Oh, s**t.This person seems to know more about me than I know about her.\u201cHuman \u2026\u2026 everyone has a background. There are origins. There are relationships that accompany them. The more we know about them, the more we can understand the causes and effects of actions. You can see the process of the results of the process of the creation\u2026\u2026. A little literary way to describe it would be \u2018the story.\u2019?\u201d\u201cThe Story \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a story. When I transferred to a new school, I looked up my classmates. I didn\u2019t want to live a boring school life, so I looked for elements that would make it interesting. As a result, I found \u2026\u2026 Ryoma and Kotaro.\u201dThen Mary laughed.Her smile was the opposite of Shiho\u2019s innocent and adorable smile, cunning and twisted.\u201cI want to twist the story of you two.\u201dThen she approaches me, leaning forward.She leans her weight on me, and when I felt the softness of Mary\u2019s body, I \u2026\u2026 unexpectedly felt a sense of disgust.\u201cPssst!\u201dPushing away, I distance myself from Mary again.But I\u2019m already backed into the corner, and I can\u2019t back away any further.So I couldn\u2019t escape Mary\u2019s nasty smile.\u201cThat\u2019s why \u2026\u2026 we need to talk more, okay?

Mary is not just a new character.She is still in the position of a tricky story crasher. That was to be expected. \u2026\u2026 But she was more twisted than I expected.I would classify people like this as \u2018hedonists\u2019.As long as they enjoy themselves, they don\u2019t care about others\u2026\u2026 Such twisted character sent chills down my spine\u2026\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shiho is not very good at getting to the point, and sometimes I don\u2019t understand what she is trying to say, but I have never felt that I don\u2019t enjoy talking with her.Mary, however, speaks logic. I don\u2019t enjoy talking to her because of her tone of explaining what is going on, how things are going on, and why things are the way they are \u2026\u2026. I understand what she is trying to say, but I don\u2019t feel good listening to her.She is the complete opposite of a talkative, soft-spoken person, but that\u2019s why I felt that her ugly side stood out.\u201c\u2026..

I just want to know everything I need to know.\u201d\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t care what I want?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, then maybe you\u2019re right. Well, look, \u2026\u2026 where do you think this limo is headed?\u3000I wonder if it really is Kotaro\u2019s house?\u3000Let\u2019s say, for example, that I am offended and have you dismissed from the car. Would Kotaro really know where he would be at that time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Threats?\u201dI huffed and looked out the window to see what was going on.However, I don\u2019t know what principles were at work, but I couldn\u2019t see the scenery outside at all.This means I don\u2019t know where I am.For example, \u2026\u2026 if I was dropped off deep in the mountains where I don\u2019t know where, \u2026\u2026 I was scared in general. No, that\u2019s not going to happen, but Mary would do something like that without a care in the world.\u201cThis car is specially made, you know? You see, sometimes I am in a mood where I don\u2019t want to look at the scenery outside, so I turn the switch off. Then I can\u2019t see out the window. It\u2019s called dimming film, have you heard of it?\u201d\u2013No.Don\u2019t resist, your instincts tell you.This person is not good. She is dangerous. She\u2019s a hedonist who is happy as long as she\u2019s enjoying things, so there\u2019s no point in resisting her. After all, she is the type of person who gets what she wants by any means necessary.But if you think about it the other way around, she must also be the type who gets bored quickly once she gets to know what she wants to know. She\u2019ll let it go soon enough then.Refusing in vain will only prolong the time. If that was the case, I decided to be mature about it.\u201cI get it. What do you want to know? If possible, I\u2019d like you to hurry up and let me go home.\u201d\u201cHmm? You\u2019re very understanding. Yes, you have a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation, after all. Well, I like this kind of conversation because it\u2019s enjoyable, so I don\u2019t mind if we keep it up forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Mature up, so don\u2019t torment me too much.\u201dShe raises her hands in surrender.As she did so, Mary took a satisfied breath and this time put her feet on the counter table.\u201cNi-hi-hihi. Yes, that\u2019s the kind of attitude you need to have. \u2026\u2026 As long as you\u2019re mature and do what I say, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201dThen she asked me a lot of questions.\u201cDo you have any family?\u201d Siblings?\u201d \u201cWhat are your grades?\u201d \u201cWhat are your dreams for the future?\u201d \u201cWhen was your first love?\u201d \u201cWhat is your type?\u201d \u201cWho are your friends?\u201d \u201cWho is your closest friend?\u201d \u201cConversely, who do you dislike?\u201d\u2013And so on.She asked questions to confirm even information that she probably would have known beforehand.By doing so, she is probing my background \u2013 my backbone.She is trying to accurately construct the story of a person named Kotaro Nakayama down to the smallest detail.And after listening to all the information, the following is what she had to say.\u201cYou are a complete \u2018mob character\u2019. Kotaro\u2019s past is boring. It\u2019s mundane and boring.\u201dI am \u2026\u2026 aware of this, so it wasn\u2019t a shock to me.That\u2019s why the line Shiho said to me, \u201cKotaro-kun is special.\u201d comes to my mind.It was strange because thinking about that adorable little girl somehow made my cheeks loosen up and I was surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You were a mob character because you were emotionless like that, weren\u2019t you?\u201dAbsolutely right. I had nothing to say in reply, so I just shrugged my shoulders without refuting her.\u201cI see. Kotaro is a mob character after all. \u2026\u2026 but that\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting. Is it because of Shiho, after all?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak that name.\u201dHer name came out unexpectedly, and my emotions were unintentionally riled up.\u201cI don\u2019t care how you treat me. I don\u2019t care how much you abuse me. I don\u2019t care how you toy with me, Mary. But not Shiho. If you\u2019re thinking of involving her in way \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to act in a way that Mary-san won\u2019t enjoy, okay?\u201dShe glares at me and spits out her words in a strong tone of voice.But I guess it is not intimidating to Mary. She continued to laugh with an aloof look on her face.\u201cYiyan~n, don\u2019t get mad at me! I\u2019m scared \u2026\u2026 but don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t want to make an enemy of you, and maybe \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t even make Shiho do what I want, so it\u2019s okay. I have no intention of involving her. Because it\u2019s boring.\u201dMaybe the tricky thing about \u2026\u2026 Mary is that she\u2019s not just a hedonist.She is a perfect human being, hungry for knowledge. And she is someone who can use that information for her own pleasure.So I guess she knew that Shiho was not the person she wanted to be. When she is involved, the story twists and turns. Shiho was the main heroine because she is such a powerful character.\u201cI like people who dance in my hands. If I can play with mediocre mob characters, or a protagonist who thinks nothing of the world like an animal, or other such pawns, I\u2019ll be happy enough.\u201d\u201cYou have a bad personality.\u201d\u201cYou know what? How many years do you think I\u2019ve been doing this? I\u2019ve been doing this for 17 years now, so I know my way around.\u201dMary knows her \u201cshare\u201d.She plays only within her means and avoids making mistakes.She is cunning in that way, and that is why it was hard to do.\u201cThe protagonist and the mob character \u2026\u2026 are in a situation where two people who would normally have little to do with each other are at odds with each other, which is interesting. Let\u2019s make the most of it. It would be more fun to have more conflict. I\u2019d like to see \u2026\u2026 a mob character ridiculing the main character.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s fun?\u201dI don\u2019t understand.Is it fun to tell a story where the mob characters just ridicule the main character?Who would want to see such a backward-looking work that produces nothing?Mary Parker is distorted, after all.She is distorted.\u201cOh, yes. There are many types of stories. Cinderella stories in which the lower class rise to power, good and evil in which justice defeats great evil, harem romantic comedies in which the characters are simply loved by the heros \u2026\u2026. There are too many to explain, but what do you think is the genre that I like best?\u201dMary speaks.\u201cI like stories like this, where a privileged person falls and is trampled by someone he \u2026\u2026 looked down on. I guess the general framework is a revenge type of story. After watching it, I always think to myself, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before\u201d. I always end my stories with this one phrase, in the best lingering, cathartic way possible.\u201dWith her feverishly raised cheeks, her eyes glowing like a dreaming maiden, she said in a woozy tone.\u201cSuck it up.\u201dThose words signaled the opening of the show.\u201cI want to make a story like that. I\u2019m sure Kotaro and Ryoma will make a great story. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to it. I\u2019m really excited.\u201dNow, it begins.A twisted romantic comedy in which I was the villain and Ryoma Ryuzaki was the protagonist was about to \u2026\u2026 start up again\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s make this one about the protagonist being defeated and beaten by a mob character that he looked down upon.\u201dShe is a hedonist who will do anything for fun.I have to say that the story requested is a bit skewed.\u201cThe protagonist, who is blessed with everything, is favored by numerous girls. It\u2019s a so-called harem-type romantic comedy. One day, he finally decides to love a heroine.\u201d\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think that this story is going to be very interesting because it has a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2026\u2026.Well, let\u2019s listen to the end of the story at first.\u201cOh, you think I\u2019m a temptress? You prefer something more unconventional? But it\u2019s hard to play with such a typical protagonist. At least allow me to start off in a conventional way.\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, I have no complaints.\u201dShe still talks in a very indirect way.Her tone of explanation, as if she were making fun of the other person, was a bit annoying, but I guess that is Mary\u2019s way of speaking. I was careful not to let my mind wander too much and urged her to continue.\u201cIn the process of loving one heroine, he might dump other subheroines. But I don\u2019t like such a story where even the thoughts of such girls are used and the protagonist-kun is united with the heroine he loves \u2013 that kind of story.\u201d\u2026\u2026Yeah, that\u2019s right.Mary, who is a twisted woman, would never enjoy a romantic comedy that fits into a typical framework.\u201cBut the heroine who made the protagonist fall in love with her actually had another boy she liked. The other person is, to his surprise, a mob character. The story ends with the protagonist grieving because the mob character he looked down upon has stolen the person he loves\u2026and it\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Early?\u201dI can\u2019t help but interject with those words.She had been telling a story that felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all along, but I didn\u2019t know the rest of the story.\u201cOh, it\u2019s early. If we end here, it will be the same as before, right? It\u2019s not a good idea to repeat the same thing over and over again.\u201dI thought the story was very familiar, but it seems that she knew what she was talking about.She knows everything. I\u2019m sure she knows what happened at the overnight learning program.\u201cThis is not enough of the \u201cSuck it up\u201d that I want.\u00a0 The main character should be unhappy and the mob characters should be happy.\u201d\u201cIn what way?\u201d\u201cI think it would make the contrast between the two stand out even more if you switched their positions.\u3000For example, not only the heroine, but also the subheroine who was rejected by the protagonist, who also falls in love with the protagonist? No, it\u2019s not enough. Maybe it would be nice to have a mob character become the harem protagonist.\u201dMary really seems to love that kind of story.She had chosen her words in a somewhat staged manner, but only now did I feel she was speaking her honest thoughts.\u2018When everything he should have had is taken away from him, the boy who was the harem protagonist finally realizes. He realizes how badly he had treated the heroines, how much they loved him, and how blessed he was. \u2026\u2026 Yeah, okay! So he lives the rest of his life alone and lonely, regretting his actions. I\u2019d like to see the protagonist beaten down like that. \u2026\u2026 Oh, I can\u2019t resist! This is good. I\u2019m a pretty good \u201ccreator\u201d, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u2026\u2026 Or maybe that would be interesting if it were a fictional story, though.But the fact that she is trying to do it in reality is still eerie.\u201cThe cast is already set, you know?\u3000The main protagonist is, of course, Ryoma. The mob character is Kotaro. The heroine will be \u2026\u2026 bold, but I\u2019ll do it. As for the subheroine who gets dumped, Yuzuki \u2026\u2026 would be too weak-willed, so Kirari would be good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Casting, huh? The story is quite memorable, but will I have to do the same thing again?\u201dApparently, Mary is going to follow the plot from just the other time and repeat it.\u201cYes. But since romantic comedies are all about love and not being loved, it\u2019s inevitable that the stories will be of the same type. \u2026\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not really interested in the process. The main part of my \u2018originality\u2019 will be how the main character falls.\u201dAfter all, it seems that Mary just wants to see Ryuzaki fall.\u201cAre you worried? Don\u2019t worry, I am a good creator and I can move perfectly well as an actor. There is nothing I can\u2019t do.\u201dThere is nothing that she has not been able to do.The reason why these arrogant words are so persuasive is because she is a \u201cperfect heroine\u201d.\u201d \u2026\u2026 Creator, huh?\u201dI almost laughed when Mary called herself that.She doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of it\u2026\u2026, but I still don\u2019t see her as a creator.She is also a \u201csubheroine\u201d.Since she calls herself such a creator, I think it\u2019s no wonder she thought it was hilarious\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m not making fun of you. It\u2019s just that it was a little funny.\u201dI hurriedly tried to make things right, but Mary\u2019s face instantly turned sour.She seemed to be annoyed that I was making fun of her plot.\u201cWhat? If you have something to complain about, why don\u2019t you just say so? I\u2019m a forgiving person, so I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d\u201cNo, no, I have nothing to complain about. You can do whatever you want \u2026\u2026, but I\u2019ll give you some advice.\u201dI\u2019m a \u2018mob character\u2019 at heart, so no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t stop the actions of the primary characters, the Mary\u2019s. I can\u2019t stop them from doing what they do.The only story I can touch is the story of that girl who made me her main character.But that girl doesn\u2019t appear in this story. So I will probably be moved as Mary wants me to be.Exactly like dancing in the palm of her hand.But there is something that Mary is mistaken about.That is that \u2026\u2026 Ryoma Ryuzaki is more of a \u201cprotagonist\u201d than she thinks.And one more thing. This time, apparently, Kirari is going to play the role that Azusa did, but I wondered if it would really work the way she wanted it to.That girl has a strong core. Even if she was rejected by Ryuzaki, I don\u2019t think she would lose heart. And it\u2019s impossible for her to like me\u2026\u2026.\u201cI don\u2019t think you should underestimate the characters. I think Ryuzaki and Kirari are tougher than you think, Mary.\u201dI advised her, just in case.But Mary laughed it off with a snicker.\u201cHAHAHA! I\u2019m not that incompetent that I can\u2019t manipulate someone of that caliber, you know? I have already investigated the past of those two, and I know what kind of thoughts they had and what kind of stories they had. So there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t do what I want.\u201d\u201cI see. Well, if you think so, Mary, that\u2019s fine. But what can I say \u2026\u2026 sorry, but I think Mary\u2019s scenario is going to fall apart soon, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Why?\u201dOh, she got angry.She always looked down on me, but what she said just now really irked me. Her expression was grim.I guess she\u2019s that confident in herself, but \u2026\u2026 unfortunately, I\u2019m certain \u2026..She is, apparently, following the romantic comedy that unfolded between me and Ryuzaki last time.She\u2019s not interested in the process and probably doesn\u2019t have enough passion to put in the time and effort there. She decided to follow the precedent and use a template, but \u2026\u2026 it didn\u2019t seem like it would work.Because there is a big difference between then and now.It\u2019s the casting of the main heroine.\u201cCan a character like Mary be the main heroine?\u201dLast time, Shiho was in that position.She was an outsider, but she had enough character to be the main heroine.But Mary, unfortunately, does not seem to be in that class.\u201cYou\u2019re just a subheroine who came out for the sake of power, so why not be as happy as you can be?\u201dIt\u2019s kind of hilarious.It\u2019s like I used to be, thinking I was the main character even though I was a mob character.That\u2019s why I laughed earlier.I felt sorry for Mary, who was trying to play a role that was not appropriate for herself.\u201cHmm? I don\u2019t know\u2026well, it\u2019s fine. You\u2019d know it when you see it, and there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ll be watching you all the time, dancing in your palm.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Kotaro, you don\u2019t resist, do you? Aren\u2019t you dissatisfied with being moved as I want you to be moved?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll say you\u2019re going to get Shiho involved this time if I resist, right? I\u2019m not going to be able to do that. I\u2019ll be Mary\u2019s toy.\u201dWell, \u2026\u2026 yeah.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in me messing around with it, and I\u2019m not going to resist.Because I\u2019m sure Mary will go down on her own, and I\u2019ll just have to watch her do it.\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll get what you want, okay? At best, just go for it.\u201dThe words, which were rough for me, came out of my mouth on their own.I was surprised at myself.\u2026\u2026Oh, I see. Maybe I\u2019m angry.Because Mary said she was the main heroine.In other words, she thinks she is the same level as Shiho.That\u2019s impossible.Because Shiho is so much more charming than Mary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sub-characters have different significances, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything odd about that.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Huh. Mob characters who understand the story like that are kind of a nuisance.\u201dMary sighs exaggeratedly.Then she hit the switch on her hand and lifted the filter on the window that was blocking the view outside.\u201cAh, my house.\u201dAnd what I saw was my familiar home.It seems that the car had stopped before I knew it. \u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t tell because the shaking was so small. It\u2019s a rich people\u2019s car indeed.\u201cI\u2019m glad you dropped me off. Thank goodness it wasn\u2019t in the mountains.\u201d\u201cI wanted to leave you somewhere, you know? Kotaro is good at making me unpleasant.\u201d\u201cThanks for that.\u201dI wonder. This feeling that I am conversing with a superior person is very creepy.I decided to get out of the car as quickly as possible, because continuing this conversation would only make both of us feel bad.\u201cThank you very much for the ride.\u201dThe elderly man who was probably driving opened the door for me, and I bowed lightly to him and thanked him. He smiled gently and slowly bowed to me as he saw me off.\u201cHurry home, Grandpa. I\u2019m tired, okay?\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dMary said something very ladylike.When I looked back as I was leaving, she was no longer looking at me. The man called she \u201cGrandpa\u201d closes the door to the back seat and walks back to the driver\u2019s seat. Then the limo starts moving again.After making sure they were left, I opened the front door.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m home.\u201dMy voice was tinged with fatigue.I was tired from the conversation with Mary.I was feeling a little thirsty, probably because I had lost some of my nervousness. I went to the kitchen to get something to drink, but on the way, Azusa, who was in the living room, called out to me.\u201cOnii-chan, welcome back.\u201d\u201cAh, un\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m home.\u201dThat\u2019s unusual. She usually doesn\u2019t welcome me back when I come home.Although I was fiddling with my phone, my consciousness was fully focused on this.\u201cHow was it at Shimotsuki-san\u2019s house?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you care?\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to go, but to ask questions as soon as I got home, I wonder if \u2026\u2026 Azusa really wanted to go too?\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s just that the food looked so good.\u201dSaying that, she shows me the screen of her phone she was holding.What is it? I looked at it and there was a picture of the food I had just eaten at Shiho\u2019s house.\u201cShimotsuki-san bragged to me \u2026\u2026 ugh, if she showed me something like this, of course I\u2019d regret it. I should have ignored the self-proclaimed Onee-chan and just gone to eat dinner \u2026\u2026.\u201dOh, that reminds me, Azusa and Shiho have each other\u2019s contact information.The two must be pretty much on the same page. They seemed to message each other frequently, and their message conversation seemed to have a large amount of history lined up.Whatever the case may be, they are good friends.Their touching, humorous relationship was comforting to me.I feel like their interactions are filled with tender emotions.It was not a frivolous conversation like the one Mary and I had.(I knew it. So cute.)Maybe it was because I was talking to a twisted person with a twisted personality earlier.Thinking about the two of them, I felt as if my tainted mind was being purified\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Next time, let\u2019s go with Azusa, too, shall we? Shiho\u2019s parents are nice people, so you don\u2019t have to be too shy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not shy. I\u2019m not Shimotsuki-san!\u201dShe is trying to fight back, but this girl has a tendency to act like a shy cat outside of the house.Of course, not as shy as Shiho, but I think it would be classified as shy.\u2013Kasha.What was that?I think I heard some kind of shutter clicking sound.\u201cAzusa, what did you do?\u201dWhen I asked her out of curiosity, she answered while fiddling with her phone.\u201cShe requested a picture of Onii-chan in return for a picture of her cooking, so I was taking one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Have you got my permission?\u201d\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t want it?\u201dNo, I wouldn\u2019t have refused if you\u2019d told me, but \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m kind of baffled.\u201cHuh. Onii-chan\u2019s pictures keep piling up in my folder. \u2026\u2026Shimotsuki-san, why do you love Onii-chan so much? She begs me every day, and it\u2019s a little annoying.\u201d\u201cWell, you took pictures of me every day \u2026\u2026?\u201dAnd I was surprised there, too, that they exchanged messages every day.I knew they were good friends.\u201cShe\u2019s so sulky. If Azusa ignored her messages, she would send me long messages, you know? And she\u2019d say things like, \u2018I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re the first person other than my parents to register my contact information, so don\u2019t ignore me.\u2019 \u2026\u2026 Her love is too heavy for Azusa to bear.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but loosen my cheeks at their interactions.The filthy exchange I had just had with Mary-san is being purged away.Shiho makes me smile even when she is not here.Maybe that\u2019s what the main heroine has and the subheroine doesn\u2019t.Whether she is present or not, she has an overwhelming presence.Even if she does nothing, she influences the hearts of others.Like Mary, you can\u2019t change others with flimsy words.But Shiho can.Because she is \u2018special\u2019.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Onii-chan, why don\u2019t you get a smartphone soon?\u3000You\u2019re her friend, so she should take good care of you.\u201d\u201cA smartphone, huh? \u2026\u2026 Hmmm, what should I do?\u201dI didn\u2019t have one because I didn\u2019t have anyone I could contact before.Shiho also told me to \u2018buy it soon,\u2019 so I might as well get it ready.\u201cYou\u2019re going to be using it a lot in the future anyway, so you might as well get it as soon as possible. \u2026\u2026 haha. Azusa wonders if Shimotsuki-san will be bothering you for a long time to come.\u201dAnd you\u2019re not honest, even though you\u2019re somehow feeling satisfied.But, well, yeah. I was convinced that I will use it a lot in the future.Because I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get to know Shiho better and better in the future.\u201cHey, Onii-chan? Is Shimotsuki-san really going to be an Onee-chan? If possible, I\u2019d like a more mature Onee-chan.\u201d\u2026\u2026I\u2019m not sure about that.I\u2019m not mature enough to think that far into the future yet.If \u2026\u2026 I and Shiho were to be together forever.Maybe then, she will be the real \u201cOnee-chan\u201d for Azusa\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Calling herself a creator, she had a lot of things in place to create the story she wanted.A week has passed since she spoke with me in the limousine.By this time, she had already firmly earned her position as the heroine closest to Ryuzaki.\u201cG\u2019morning, Ryoma! I\u2019ll give you a good morning hug!\u201d\u201cHey, hey, \u2026\u2026, I guessed \u2026\u2026 right.\u201d\u201cYou guessed right!\u201dIn the morning, as soon as she arrived at school, she started flirting with Ryuzaki. She was taking advantage of her own blessed body to sprinkle a bit of romantic appeal on him.\u201cUhehe \u2026\u2026 well, that\u2019s fine. Oh dear, this is a Western greeting, so I had no choice. Yeah, I\u2019m irresistible, aren\u2019t I!\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, Ryoma\u2019s ecchi~!\u201dShe calls herself a great actor, and she\u2019s quite a good one.She was blatantly pushing her b*****s against the protagonist-sama, making him delirious. It is a common service scene, but when she does it with her fleshy body, it also has a strong effect.Perhaps, in terms of b****t size, she may be even bigger than Yuzuki. Such is Mary\u2019s s*x appeal, and Ryuzaki was stretching his nose.What\u2019s so good about that \u2026\u2026?I don\u2019t really understand it for mob characters. To begin with, I have never lusted after another person, so perhaps I am missing something as a living being?It makes me somewhat uneasy. In the morning, while idly watching Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy from my seat, I thought about my nature.I know whether a woman is cute or not, but whether she is \u2026\u2026 erotic or not is another matter.I let my thoughts run through my head.I\u2019m not excited about Mary\u2019s or Yuzuki\u2019s b*****s. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think much of Azusa\u2019s b*****s, which are relatively small. Then, when I think of Kirari\u2019s b*****s, which are somewhere in the middle, I still don\u2019t think anything of them.Is it not a matter of size?For example, how about \u2026\u2026 Shiho\u2019s b*****s, then?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Huh~!?\u201dI try to imagine. But suddenly my head got hot and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.Oh, no. I felt like my brain would probably explode if I imagined any more.Well, I guess this is what it means.Shiho may be really special to me.(I see. Ryuzaki can have the same feelings for all girls that I have for Shiho.)The protagonist seems to be quite greedy.Well, there is a saying, \u2018I prefer a hero\u2019s color\u2019 and in a sense, it may be similar to the fate of the protagonist.Nevertheless, I would still have to say that Mary is still a masterful actor, having made a rapid approach to Ryuzaki in only a short period of time, just one week.Because she has surpassed Yuzuki and Kirari, who are in a relatively dominant position among the harem members.In just one week, she has surpassed the two who met at the entrance ceremony and have been standing next to Ryuzaki ever since. She is now a strong candidate to be a regular heroine.She is in a position similar to that of Shiho in the previous installment.I guess we can say that she is right in line with the plot.\u201cHAHAHA! Ryoma, shall I give you a kiss? It\u2019s just another greeting, so don\u2019t be shy, okay?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little \u2026\u2026, but thank you. I\u2019m very happy that we\u2019re such good friends.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not really in love with Ryoma, you know!\u201d\u2013I was surprised that Ryuzaki is doing so well.He had been so depressed since the overnight learning program.No matter how much Yuzuki, Kirari, and the rest of the harem members encouraged him, he remained depressed.But thanks to Mary, he is now completely back to normal.(Perhaps Ryuzaki is comparing Shiho to Mary?)Their personalities and appearances are completely different, though.In terms of presence alone, they are in close proximity. Shiho is much more dominant in terms of magnitude, but Mary also has her own unique atmosphere.I felt that Ryuzaki was overlapping Shiho\u2019s aspects with Mary\u2019s inhuman charm.That is probably why Ryuzaki is happy to be acknowledged by her. In truth, Mary-san is doing what he wanted Shiho to say or do.(\u2026\u2026 Ewww\u2026)That said, I wonder what kind of face Ryuzaki will make when he finds out it was an act?Maybe he will experience a sense of despair that he can\u2019t bear.\u2026\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t like that guy, so I don\u2019t feel sorry for him.If he were a normal protagonist, he would probably just break down and never get up again.That\u2019s why I\u2019m interested.Is Ryuzaki\u2019s character as a protagonist really normal, \u2026\u2026 or abnormal?And can he break up Mary\u2019s fantasy of a rogue romantic comedy?I was a little concerned about that part \u2014 a little bit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If we think in terms of origins and endings, we are now about at the beginning of the \u201csucceeding\u201d clause, right?It\u2019s about time to start the preliminary preparations for the \u201cturning\u201d clause.\u201cYes, yes, yes, yes. Well then, everyone, it\u2019s time to start preparing for the festival~!\u201dToday, the entire afternoon class was LHR.The first discussion for the festival to be held in mid-October is said to be taking place.\u201cYou can do whatever you want as long as you keep moderation in mind, so think what you want, okay? Then, I think I\u2019ll leave the rest of the proceedings to the class president~? Niou-san, I\u2019ll leave the rest to you~.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, I understand.\u201dAt Suzuki-sensei\u2019s words, the class president, Futako Niou, stands at the lectern.The class president, whose trademark is her glasses and pigtails, began without hesitation.\u201cThen, those who have any ideas, please raise your hands.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201dAnd the first to raise her hand was Mary.\u201cI think a maid cafe is a good idea! If we entertain our customers with several maids, I\u2019m sure they will pay us well. In return, if we charge extra for drinks as part of the entertainment fee, we can make a lot of money!\u201d\u201cNo, I reject that idea. The most important thing to remember is that it\u2019s not a maid cafe, but a bar. Please maintain moderation as a high school student.\u201d\u201cOH\u2026\u2026I understand!!\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t use that language, either. Also, isn\u2019t it a little strange for you, a woman, to mention that?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?Part of the exchange was unclear, but anyway, the maid cafe seemed to be rejected.\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d\u201c\u2026. Are you the only one in this class? I appreciate all your suggestions, but \u2026\u2026 you should learn to be a little more reserved.\u201dMary is very energetic.She is always cheerful at school, but she seems especially energetic now.\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m looking forward to the festival! You see, I love it~!\u201d\u2026.. Is that really true?Knowing that she has a dark side, I could not honestly accept her words.But Niou-san, the president, who has no idea what her other side is, seems to have believed her words.\u201cHmm. \u2026\u2026 I see. Well then, I stand corrected. Shall we work hard to make the festival a wonderful memory for Mary Parker?\u201d\u2014 With these words, the classmates who seemed to have been less than enthusiastic all at once looked at each other. The majority of them, who had thought it was none of their business, were probably inspired by Mary\u2019s cheerfulness.Ah, so that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do. \u2026\u2026 She may be trying to make the festival an \u2018event\u2019 of the story.So, because she inevitably needs the cooperation of her classmates to do so, she dared to choose words that would inspire.She calls herself a creator, so she is quite a schemer.\u201cThen again, do you have any suggestions\u2026\u2026?\u201dNiou\u2019s question brought up a number of hands, not only Mary\u2019s this time. The members of the class, their morale raised, were ready to work as one for the festival.Then, a number of ideas were raised.Restaurant, cinema, haunted house, maze, fortune-telling, etc\u2026\u2026. The ideas were narrowed down by majority vote.Finally, the final choice was\u2026\u201cWell, then, it\u2019s decided. The second class of the first year will be doing a \u201cplay\u201d this time. I ask for everyone\u2019s cooperation.\u201dWith Niou-san\u2019s words, the big event of the year was decided.(Theater, or \u2026\u2026)I don\u2019t know. I have a bad feeling about this.No, calm down. I\u2019m just a mob character. \u2026\u2026 If I think about it normally, I should be assigned to a behind-the-scenes job.I\u2019m not optimistic enough to think that I\u2019ll be okay because I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be pushed into a low-profile position.\uff08Mary\u2019s going to try something, isn\u2019t she?)Though we have never spoken since our conversation in the limousine.I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll bring me into the picture soon.I am the villain and the antagonist in Ryuzaki\u2019s romantic comedy.Using this conflict structure, Mary is trying to create a romantic comedy of sorts.How could she not take advantage of the big event that is the cultural festival\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At her words, Niou-san, the class president who was running the event, nodded his head expressionlessly.\u201cI see. Then, what shall we do? The famous ones are \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d, \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d, \u201cThe Three Little Pigs\u201d, \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d and so on. We could make a tragedy into a comedy, and vice versa, and it might even be funny.\u201d\u2026.. Hmm?Niou-san, perhaps she likes fairy tales?The tone of her speech was smooth and she was very talkative.\u201cBut I especially recommend \u2018Cinderella\u2019. I think it\u2019s the most beautiful story in the world. \u2026\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s just my personal opinion.\u201dPerhaps after she finished saying it, she realized she was talking too fast. Niou-san\u2019s face was red.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got a little excited. Now, please think about it a little \u2026\u2026 and you may consult with the people around you \u2026\u2026. I\u2019m going to go wash my face for a bit.\u201dSeemingly feeling somewhat embarrassed, Niou-san walked out of the classroom like she was trying to escape. After seeing her off with a smiling face, our classmates began discussing what to perform.\u201cSuyaa \u2026\u2026 Muuu? Huh? Mom \u2026\u2026 what do I do now \u2026\u2026?\u201dAnd if you thought Shiho was quiet earlier, she seemed to be sleeping soundly. I wondered if she woke up because of the noise around her.\u201cI\u2019m not your mom, though.\u201d\u201cEh? Oh, hey, different \u2026\u2026!\u201dRecently, Shiho has been able to talk a little more in the classroom. She is still whispering, but she is able to be loud enough that I can hear her well when she is seated next to me.The exchange diary is going on because we\u2019re doing it in class, but thanks to \u2026\u2026 my grades are going down too, so I\u2019d rather not do that one if possible.\u201cKohon. Kotaro-kun, what are you doing now? We had lunch and I was just relaxing and before I knew it, I fell asleep. So I don\u2019t know anything\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe fell asleep because she got sleepy after eating lunch, just like a toddler.I thought she was a girl who was always on her guard, but lately she\u2019s been especially clumsy. Maybe she feels safe because I\u2019m next to her at school.I\u2019m glad to see that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for her to doze off.\u201cDon\u2019t just play games at night, you need to get some sleep, okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like my mother. Instead, why don\u2019t you tell me what you are doing? Why are there fairy tales on the blackboard? I like the Three Little Pigs the best. It\u2019s funny because the little piggy gets eaten.\u201dThis girl is very dark to find the fun in that.\u201cYou know, we have a school festival in a month, right? We\u2019ve decided to put on a play in our class. We\u2019re in the process of deciding on the theme for the play.\u201d\u201cA play! That\u2019s wonderful\u266a! I\u2019d like to see Kotaro-kun play the role of the eldest pig and be the first one to get eaten. I can\u2019t wait to see Kotaro-kun in a panic when his straw house gets blown down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be the one to perform\u2026\u201d\u201cEh\u2026.? I wanted to watch.\u201dWhile I was dodging such conversation, Niou-san came back.Her face, which had been slightly red earlier, was now back to its original expressionless state.\u201cThank you for your patience. I think the consultation should be over by now, so please be quiet. So, first of all, are there any other plays you would like to try?\u201dAt that time, again, the first to raise her hand was \u2026\u2026 Mary, after all.\u201cYes! I want to do \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019.\u201dI almost gasped when I heard the title.The story seemed to be the kind of story that \u2026\u2026 Mary would like.All I know is the famous Disney version, so maybe it\u2019s a different story in the original. \u2026\u2026 No, I think it\u2019s probably the famous one that Mary wants to do.\u201cIt\u2019s also hmm \u2026\u2026 good. It\u2019s a story that originated in France and has been made into an animated children\u2019s movie, so I\u2019m sure you all know the plot.\u201dNiou-san was also enthusiastic.And Mary\u2019s comments had a strong influence. So everyone\u2019s reaction was positive.(I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a battle for one beautiful girl between a former prince who turned into a beast and a handsome egotistical bastard\u2026\u2026.)Well, I\u2019m supposed to be behind the scenes, so I\u2019m not complaining about anything.But I had a bad feeling about it somehow, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable.If possible, I\u2019d be happy if this premonition was unfounded, but \u2026\u2026.\u201cI would now like to take a majority vote. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to read it out, and you can raise your hand to the one you think is good.\u201dThen, the list was narrowed down.In the end, the majority vote went to \u2026\u2026 \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ugh, I wanted to see the little piggy cry.\u201d\u201cNo, Shiho was the only one who wanted to do that, so we couldn\u2019t have done it anyway.\u201dEven though her shyness is gradually improving, she still becomes quiet when I\u2019m not around.I gave her a hearty encouragement, hoping that someday she would be able to behave openly in front of others.Shiho, hang in there. You can do it \u2013 and this makes me sound like a parent.\u2026\u2026 Well, that\u2019s beside the point.\u201cNow then, about the casting, \u2026\u2026 the only things that can be decided in time are the main actors and the person in charge of the script. First, let\u2019s decide who will be in charge of the script, which will take the most time. Does anyone have a preference?\u201dNiou-san asked, but no one\u2019s hand went up. My guess was that Mary would do it, but she was not interested in scriptwriting.She seems to want to enjoy the real world and is not interested in the fictional world.\u201cIs anyone out there? If not, I\u2019ll \u2026\u2026. Maybe I can write it.\u201d\u201cOh, great!\u201dOne of our classmates exclaimed in admiration.It seems that Niou-san likes stories after all. Of course, not in a warped sense like Mary, but in a pure sense.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a great script, but I\u2019ll give it all I can. I\u2019m applying to study literature and art at university, so it will be a good opportunity for me to get a good record.\u201dHer tone was calm, but her red face made it obvious that she was just trying to be tactful.\u201cThen does anyone want to play the main heroine, the Beauty, and the Beast and \u2026\u2026 the handsome hunter\u2026..\u201dAt the same time she said these words, Mary raised her hand in high spirits.She was so enthusiastic that I could tell she had been waiting for it.\u201cYes, yes! I want to play the Beauty!\u201dEveryone laughed at her cheerful remark. I am sure that they see a cheerful beautiful woman in their eyes. \u2026\u2026 I know that it is a calculated act, and it is only creepy to me, because I see the other side of her.\u201cThe Beauty, \u2026\u2026 who else would like to act?\u201dBut it was not an instant decision.The Niou-san is turning her somewhat meaningful gaze in our direction.No, not exactly to me, but to Shiho next to me.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Wakame s-seeweed\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t notice my gaze, though she was muttering something unintelligible to me.Well, I understand what Niou-san is trying to say.Because when it comes to beautiful women in this class, the first name that comes to mind is \u201cShiho Shimotsuki\u201d. Mary is also a beautiful woman, but she doesn\u2019t get along with \u2026\u2026 anyone, and Shiho has the image of being a \u201chigh peak\u201d.So, she is the most suitable for the role of the Beauty. \u2026\u2026 However, her classmates probably know that it is impossible.People would have seen Shiho crying on stage during the overnight program.So they would understand that she can\u2019t be an actor in a play.\u201cNo? Then, Mary, please play the Beauty.\u201dSoon the main heroine was decided.Two more roles remained to be cast. The two remaining roles are that of the beast and the handsome hunter. \u2026\u2026 If you think about it in that order, the role of the beast is likely to be played by Ryuzaki.Since he is the main character, it was obvious that he would be the main character in the play as well.\u2013I was expecting that.\u201cYes, yes, yes! Can I recommend someone?\u201dA disturbing hand went up.That hand, of course, belonged to Mary.\u201cI nominate \u2026\u2026 Kotaro for the role of the Beast!\u201d\u2026.. Really?The class was in a stir at this unexpected statement.\u201cKotaro, you mean \u2026\u2026 Nakayama? What, indeed, that\u2019s \u2026\u2026 quite different, isn\u2019t it?\u201dEveryone was puzzled. No, I understand how they feel. I am sure I am more bewildered than everyone else.\u201cHuh!? Mary, why\u2026\u2026 that guy?\u201dNo, let me correct you.It was Ryuzaki who was the most puzzled, not me.His favorite heroine had mentioned the name of a man he hated. I am sure he is not at peace with himself.\u201cBut you don\u2019t like this kind of thing, do you Ryoma? Oh, maybe you wanted to play a role in a play? Then Ryoma should be the main character!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to do it, but I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re recommending him over \u2026\u2026 anyone else.\u201dYou are absolutely right.Ryuzaki\u2019s statement is absolutely correct. However, \u2026\u2026 Mary smiled a weird smile in response to his words.Forgetting to act, she said.\u201cBecause \u2026\u2026 that\u2019s more \u2018interesting\u2019, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2013Oh, I see.This was, after all, the scenario that Mary had drawn up.We would put on a play at the school festival.And she wants me to be the main character and Ryuzaki to be the villain.As if to \u201cforeshadow\u201d a relationship that would later come into existence\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If there is anyone who wants to, please raise your hand.\u201dWhen Niou-san, the class president, asked this, none of the other classmates raised their hands. It is likely that they are not comfortable going up on the stage.If things had gone the way they were supposed to, the main character would have reacted, \u201cOh dear, I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I had no choice.\u201d. but that didn\u2019t happen because of Mary\u2019s comment.\u201cIf Ryoma would have played the main character, I would have been fine with that. But it\u2019s not right for Kotaro to play the role of the hunter who is good-looking, right? Because Kotaro is not handsome! Then I think the handsome Ryoma would be better!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you say so, \u2026\u2026 but\u2026\u201dMary said something like that and tried not to break the heroine\u2019s position, but it was obvious that she was trying to make me the main character.\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t look good in the lead role.\u201dRyuzaki looks reluctant. That\u2019s understandable, \u2026\u2026 because for once, Ryuzaki\u2019s words are right.Because it doesn\u2019t suit me to be the main character\u2026\u2026.Now, what about Mary?In the scenario she envisions, I should be the main character.But my classmates, including Ryuzaki, refuse to accept that. The impact of the story is not strong enough to make me the main character.\u201cOh dear\u2026\u2026. haha.\u201dMary seems to have noticed the atmosphere.Was it a failure? I sigh.\u2026.. I still think she\u2019s a little underwhelmed.I don\u2019t feel that Mary has the power to change the story.After all, she is a subheroine with leverage. If she can\u2019t make me the main character here, it means that there was already a breakdown in her plot.If that was the case, there would be no more incidents to worry about in the future.After all, this was the extent of it. Mary, I\u2019m sorry to say that your story seems to be ending without even an opening chapter.\u201cHmm, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t really care who does it, but \u2026\u2026 there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone else who wants to do it, so can we have a majority vote? If you don\u2019t mind the two people who have been recommended.\u201d\u2026..I really don\u2019t want to go on stage, though.But since I had decided not to resist Mary, all I could do was nod.\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\u201cTch \u2026\u2026 say no. Then I can play the main role.\u201dEven Ryuzaki, who sees me as an enemy, accepted the recommendation without denial.\u201cI want to know the consensus. Who do you think should play the leading role? Raise your hands, please.\u201dThis time, the names of me and Ryuzaki were written on the blackboard.Well, objectively speaking, I think Ryuzaki is the best choice. I was looking at the scene with a complacent and optimistic \u2026\u2026 feeling that I wouldn\u2019t get any votes.\u201cSo, first of all \u2026\u2026, what do you think of \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-san?\u201dNo one responded to that question.Everyone looked around, but no one wanted to raise their hand.\u201cMuuu\u2026..\u201dMary also raised her eyebrows unwillingly. Even if she raised her hand in this air, no one would follow suit. That is the limit of a subheroine.\u201cKuku \u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dRyuzaki was also snickering at me. I was uncomfortable with the look of triumph on his face, but there was no point in getting angry at every little thing, so I looked away and ignored him.Well, I\u2019m just like that, or so I thought.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dA small, timid, but beautiful voice echoed through the classroom.\u201c\u201d\u201d\u2026..Eh?\u201d\u201d\u201dEveryone was stunned to hear her voice.Of course, she was looking at me and her expression was tense like she was nervous \u2026\u2026 but she didn\u2019t retreat.\u201cI do.\u201dThis time, she mustered up the courage to raise her hand.Thanks to the quietness of the classroom, her voice was clearly audible.(\u2026\u2026 I wonder about that courage\u2026\u2026.)Of course, the one who raised her hand \u2013 our main heroine.\u201cUgh \u2026\u2026.\u201dShiho voted for me.Earlier she said she wanted \u201cThe Three Little Pigs,\u201d but she couldn\u2019t muster up the courage to raise her hand. But now she raises her hand to support me.I\u2019m glad she\u2019s doing her best for me, but \u2026\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at her unexpected support.(I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t think anything of it \u2026\u2026 but it\u2019s kind of bad timing.)Shiho\u2019s declaration is a bit bad for the process.Because she is the main heroine.Unlike Mary, she is a girl whose existence is valuable. Her influence was not comparable to Mary\u2019s.\u201c\u201d\u201d\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201d\u201dSeveral people raised their hands as if following Shiho\u2019s lead.And this created a chain of events, as classmates began to raise their hands one after another.(Mary, good for you \u2026\u2026, you were apparently lucky.)I thought for sure that the story was going to fall apart in the beginning.But it seems that the main heroine\u2019s one comment seems to have somehow restored the plot\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone has a weakness in a certain category. It is very difficult to face them, and it requires a very strong will.It is human nature to want to unconditionally cheer on people who are trying their best, no matter what their personalities are.And Shiho is the main heroine. There was no way that everyone would not cheer her on.Therefore, hands went up one after another.Perhaps some of the votes came from neutrals who were happy with either one. There may have been people who succumbed to peer pressure, raising their hands because everyone else raised theirs.But it was unmistakably \u201cShiho\u201d who created the trigger.\u201cEh\u2026!\u201dRyuzaki looks frustrated. He\u2019s glaring at me, but I can\u2019t say anything, probably because of the action Shiho took.I didn\u2019t do anything. She just did her best.But that may have been uncomfortable for Ryuzaki. Because he is the one who wanted to be chosen by Shiho, but was not chosen.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dMary, on the other hand, also had a complicated expression on her face.She was smart enough to realize that she would have failed if the situation had gone the way it was supposed to. That is why she must be acutely aware of the significance of the main heroine\u2019s move to overturn the board.She can change the flow of the situation, but she cannot create it.That is the limitation of the sub-heroine.(Glad it went in the right direction this time, Mary \u2026\u2026, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen next time, okay?)As for me, though, I wanted her plot to fall apart.But it\u2019s inevitable. Shiho wanted me to play the leading role.Then there was no way I could refuse.\u201cI understand. You don\u2019t even need to count\u2026\u2026. Nakayama-san, please play the Beast.\u201dAnd Niou-san, the sole remaining neutral person in the classroom, proceeded with the meeting in an unobtrusive manner.As the referee, she only verbalizes the facts. But that is also a merciless sentence against Ryuzaki.\u201cI would like you to play the role of the hunter, Ryuzaki-san.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Damn.\u201dIn the end, it seems that I was cast as per Mary\u2019s intentions.I wasn\u2019t supposed to be the star of the show.(It\u2019s a gory story\u2026\u2026.)This is something of brute force.Even if Mary-san had tried all kinds of tricks, it was going to be impossible, but Shiho\u2019s influence is still amazing.And once again I feel \u2026\u2026 glad that a girl like that has the courage to do this for me.Such a charming girl is trying to support me with her devotion.How could any man not be happy about that?(Well, I\u2019m not confident \u2026.)To be honest, I\u2019m not sure I could play the lead role.It\u2019s a fictional story, so it\u2019s still better, but that didn\u2019t mean I thought I could perform admirably.But I\u2019ll do my best.Shiho did her best. \u2026\u2026 Now it\u2019s my turn\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was nice to get out of the school, but Shiho, who was still slow on her feet, asked for a break, so we stopped at a nearby park. I asked her to sit on a bench and catch her breath.\u201cYou did something unusual and unfamiliar\u2026\u2026. How could you raise your hand in a situation like that when you\u2019re so shy?\u201dIn the silence of the classroom, the voice she put out to gather her courage was trembling, but it had the power to make everyone\u2019s hearts tremble as well.Thanks to that, I became the central character.\u201cI\u2019m not shy. I was a rabbit in a previous life, so I have a strong sense of territoriality. See, my ears are floppy, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s a remnant of being a rabbit, you know.\u201dShe said and wiggled her ears.She is cute, but why does she stubbornly refuse to admit her shyness?I think Shiho\u2019s cute point is that she is stubborn in a strange way.\u201cRabbit \u2026\u2026 I wonder what it would taste like if I ate one of those \u2026\u2026?\u201dI felt somewhat distracted. I felt silly for worrying about so many things, so I sat down next to Shiho. Then she started patting me on the shoulder.\u201cNo, no. Rabbit is not food. \u2026\u2026 I wonder if Kotaro-kun doesn\u2019t have a human heart?\u3000Oh, but rabbits are counted as \u2018animals,\u2019 and maybe they taste like birds\u2026\u2026.!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re drooling\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh no. I\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201dThe change of heart is too quick.And while it\u2019s cute to see her fidgeting in embarrassment, please don\u2019t try to wipe your mouth with my uniform.\u201cHere\u2019s a handkerchief.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dCome to think of it, I\u2019ve lent her a handkerchief before. Thinking back to that time, the relationship between me and Shiho has come a long way.\u201cI really appreciate your hard work, \u2026\u2026. But you didn\u2019t have to try so hard, okay?\u201dLooking closer, I see that her body is still trembling.She must have pushed herself very hard. Shiho is that sensitive to people\u2019s consciousness.So why did Shiho try so hard?She told me the reason.\u201cBecause I wanted to see Kotaro-kun\u2019s big day\u2026\u2026, and I was kind of nervous when I thought that you, the wonderful Kotaro-kun, would show me something cool. So I did my best to help you in any way I could.\u201dAfter all, this girl wasn\u2019t thinking too deeply about things.She just showed her tender affection for me with her actions.I guess Mary and Ryuzaki are not important to Shiho.She is thinking about me anyway.She has special feelings only for me.That really \u2026\u2026 made me happy.\u201cThank you.\u201dI genuinely think so.Thank you for loving me like this.That thought moved my body.I gently held her trembling hand. I held it tightly so as not to break it, yet not to let it go.\u201cEh? Um, hmm??? Kotaro-kun? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dShiho was also puzzled by the sudden grip on her hand.It\u2019s not surprising. The reason is that I\u2019ve never touched her before.Whenever we had skinship, Shiho always took the lead.I was always passive and couldn\u2019t do anything, but today \u2026\u2026 I was finally able to touch her myself.Because I was always in self-denial, I was convinced that Shiho was \u2018not the right person for me to touch,\u2019 so I was reluctant to do so.But finally\u2026\u2026 I, too, have grown up, it seems.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair of \u2026\u2026 you to do that all of a sudden. I\u2019m so nervous, my hands are going to shake even more.\u201d\u201cOh, really? Then, um\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut she was still embarrassed and shy.As expected, I thought it was too sudden and tried to let go, but Shiho didn\u2019t want to do that\u2026\u2026.\u201cNo. You made me tremble so much, so\u2026. will you take responsibility and hold my hand until I stop trembling?\u201dShe smiles charmingly and at the same time squeezes my hand even tighter.That smile always saves my life.Really, this girl is so cute\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the timing was so opportune, I decided to sign up for a smart phone contract and came to a nearby shopping mall where there was a specialized store.However, I didn\u2019t think I would be able to sign the contract since my parents were not there, but I thought I would talk to the clerk beforehand.My and Azusa\u2019s parents are very busy people. I think they would be present if I asked them to, but I can\u2019t hold them up for a long time. Therefore, I wanted to prepare in advance so that the contract could be signed in as little time as possible.\u201c\u2026 I see. I don\u2019t know.\u201dBut I don\u2019t know. No, I could understand the details of the contract, but I really didn\u2019t know which model would be good for me.In the end, I spent a meaningless time just listening to the explanation from the clerk.Maybe I should not have come here alone.Should I ask Shiho and Azusa to come over this time?\u3000Those two are often poking around on their phones and probably know a lot about them.That\u2019s why I was going to leave right away, but \u2026\u2026 I suddenly remembered that I was going to play the main character \u2026\u2026, and I stopped in my tracks.(Should I at least know the story?)I saw the movie when I was a little kid, so I kind of know what it\u2019s about. But come to think of it, I\u2019ve never seen that story in written form.Since I was supposed to play the main role, I should at least know the details of the story.I thought better of it and headed for the bookstore as soon as possible.At times like this, shopping malls with a variety of stores are convenient. You can get various things done at the same time. \u2026\u2026 Oh, I also remembered that Azusa had said, \u2018Get me something sweet to eat\u2019. Maybe buy some doughnuts or something.I searched for the book with a lot of thoughts in my head.Beauty and the Beast is a famous story, but all I could find were picture books adapted for children.I had no choice, but it was okay. It would be better to have a picture book than not to have a book at all. \u2026\u2026 And Shiho might be able to understand the story better if she had a picture book.And I was in the middle of it, picking up a picture book and heading for the cash register.\u201c\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201dI bumped into a familiar face.The encounter may have been convenient in a way.She has been a little bit absent from the story because of my lack of involvement with her, but she has an important position in the story.So, by digging deeper into her character here, I can make it easier to use her in future developments.\u201cThat\u2019s very unusual of you, isn\u2019t it, Ko-kun?\u201dI was a little surprised when she spoke to me in a friendly manner.She had been my friend in the past, and her attitude was friendly, as if we were still friends.But I couldn\u2019t talk to her like I used to.\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u2026, it\u2019s been a long time, Kirari.\u201d\u2013How many months it has been since we have spoken to each other?Perhaps it\u2019s no wonder that I felt awkward talking to her for the first time since the entrance ceremony.Kirari was laughing at me.\u201cHuh? We see each other every day at school. What are you talking about? Nyahaha!\u201dKirari is a gal-like girl with dyed blond hair and blue colored contacts. Her school uniform is also loosely worn, and I noticed that it shows a little of her cleavage.When I see her like that, I can\u2019t help but remember the past.Until junior high school, she had black hair. And she tied it in a bun on top of her head and wore glasses. She was a neat and tidy girl who wore her school uniform properly, but now \u2026\u2026 there is no more trace of her.I saw the girl in front of me, the girl I once thought was my best friend.But for the life of me, I couldn\u2019t believe that the girl of the past and the girl of the present were the same person\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a story about a simple boy like you who gets a lot of girls.\u201d\u201cWould you like to read this one, too? Another story about an unassuming boy who goes to another world and becomes very powerful.\u201d\u201cRead that one, too. It\u2019s a romantic comedy about a plain boy and a plain girl who flirt freely with each other.\u201dI don\u2019t think she really wanted a friend.Maybe she just wanted to talk about her favorite works.From that time on, I had no initiative and just did what I was told to do, but that seemed to be convenient for her. I was forced to read, learn, and understand various works. I would listen to Kirari\u2019s thoughts and impressions, and sometimes I would even discuss them with her.Thanks to her, I became more knowledgeable about the structure of stories. Perhaps because of this, I have come to perceive the real world in this way.Kirari had a great influence on my thinking, which led me to this kind of \u2018grounded\u2019 thinking.She was such a \u201cspecial\u201d person for me in junior high school.She once said to me.I will never forget it. It was the winter of my junior high school graduation ceremony.\u201cThanks for being a good friend to me, Ko-kun. Thanks to you, I\u2019ve come to think that talking to other people isn\u2019t so bad. You are my closest friend, my best friend.\u201d\u2013I was so happy.I was uncharacteristically excited that she thought of me not only as a friend, but as her best friend.Perhaps my feelings at the time were as close to \u201clove\u201d as I could get.I liked the way she talked.Her voice was quiet and calm, but not distinctive, and I could listen to it forever.I also liked her hairstyle.She wore her black hair tied up in a bun, and I appreciated it because I could recognize her from a distance just by her silhouette.I also liked her glasses.They were a little too big for her, and they shifted easily, so she would often adjust them with a single nudge. I remember how adorable that gesture was.I also liked her personality.I liked the way she was not concerned about being part of a crowd, but was very confident on her own and did not flatter others.I also liked the way she enjoyed her hobbies.When she was reading, Kirari was more emotional than usual. When she read each sentence, she would express her happiness or sadness, and when she finished reading all of the sentences, she would cry or laugh hysterically.Of course, the people around her looked at her strangely, but Kirari was always herself, no matter what they thought.I also liked her innocent atmosphere, which was in contrast to her sparkling name, Kirari, because of the gap between the two.But she is no longer the girl I liked.At the entrance ceremony of high school, she met Ryoma Ryuzaki and \u2026\u2026 she killed herself.\u201cKo-kun, I\u2019m sorry, okay? I have someone I like. I\u2019ll do anything to make him like me \u2026\u2026 because I want to be the person he likes, even if it kills the person I\u2019ve been.\u201dPerhaps this was the first time Kirari had sought out another person.Thinking back, I was not the one she wanted.I just happened to start talking to her, but I didn\u2019t have any feelings of liking or disliking her, I guessed at that time.And so Kirari changed herself.She took Ryuzaki\u2019s comment that he liked girls with flashy hair color seriously and dyed her beautiful black hair blonde. She changed her tone of voice to match her hair color, twisted her personality, and simply changed herself into the kind of girl that Ryuzaki would like.Because of this, my former friend \u201cKirari Asakura\u201d died.(Kirari \u2026\u2026 is that really that\u2019s the way it should have been?)Even if Ryuzaki liked the Kirari of today.Would that really mean that Kirari is loved?If you\u2019re going to change yourself so much, why \u2026\u2026 not just be Kirari? If Kirari is no longer Kirari, who in the world will you be \u2026\u2026?That\u2019s what \u2026\u2026 I think.Seeing Kirari who has lost herself makes me feel very sad.For example, who will Kirari become after this romance ends without Ryuzaki loving her\u2026\u2026?Maybe she doesn\u2019t even know the answer to that question\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t it too soon to say goodbye? You\u2019re my friend, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re feeling lonely~.\u201dShe clasped my shoulders in a friendly manner.\u2026\u2026 I was surprised. Apparently, I\u2019m still in the \u2018friend\u2019 category in Kirari\u2019s mind.\u201c\u2026.. Lonely?\u201dWe hadn\u2019t exchanged a single conversation since the entrance ceremony, but she didn\u2019t seem to care too much.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? Because we\u2019ve known each other since middle school~\u201dBut Kirari smiles without malice.She really seems to think of me as a friend.(Really, I doubt she thinks anything of me.)Maybe Kirari can\u2019t predict my emotions.As someone who has always lived on her own, I always thought she was the type of person who didn\u2019t have much empathy for others, but \u2026\u2026 I guess it went as far as this \u2026\u2026.I guess I am nothing more than a friend to Kirari.I was just a convenient person to talk to when we were in junior high school.\u201cWell, yeah. We\u2019ve known each other since middle school.\u201dHowever, I had no feelings for Kirari to get angry at her now either.I didn\u2019t even feel bad enough to be stubborn and refuse, so I decided to make light conversation and brush it off.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right\u266a\u2026 I have fond memories\u2026. We talked a lot in junior high school, didn\u2019t we? I was reading a lot of romance novels and stuff. When I think about it now, I was a little embarrassed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be ashamed of. Don\u2019t you read anymore?\u201d\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a gal now, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m a novelist, is there? I mean, I don\u2019t even read books at all~?\u201d\u201cThen why are you in a bookstore?\u201dAt the same time as I asked that question, Kirari\u2019s smile suddenly disappeared.\u201cI wonder why \u2026\u2026.\u201dProbably something happened. Well, I\u2019m not interested enough to ask, so let\u2019s pay the bill first.Just as it was my turn, I bought the picture book.And when I left the bookstore, Kirari followed behind me.\u201c\u2026 Ah, it\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d \u2026\u2026. Oh, I see, I remember Ko-kun starring in the play. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re studying? Hmm, that\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s normal. You aren\u2019t buying anything, Kirari? I\u2019m going home.\u201dA little persistent.I want her to let me go, but she continues to follow me.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u2026 sorry, I lied. Actually, I was going to buy one. Today, Ryu-kun was so preoccupied with Mary that he didn\u2019t give me much time to do anything. \u2026\u2026 I was so upset that I was remembering the old days too. I was thinking of reading a novel for the first time in a long time, but then I changed my mind because Ko-kun was there.\u201d\u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t ask her about it.But since she explained it to me, I understood most of what was going on.As per Mary\u2019s plot, Kirari seems to be steadily being forced out of her position. I\u2019m sure that she has become lonely because she is no longer in Ryuzaki\u2019s favor.So now she is trying to cling to the past.Like when she was in junior high school, she is trying to tell herself that she is fine on her own.But Kirari is no longer the Kirari of that time.She is no longer okay being alone.That\u2019s why she is trying to rely on me this time.She is trying to fill the loneliness that Ryuzaki can\u2019t fill with me.Seeing her like that made me sad.When we were in middle school, she was so cool to be so firm on her own.\u201cWell, \u2026\u2026 novels, you loved them so much \u2026\u2026, but you don\u2019t read them anymore. Kirari has \u2026\u2026 changed a lot.\u201dIt\u2019s not just her hobbies and tastes that have changed, though.I didn\u2019t have any special feelings for her that I wanted to tell her about, so I dared to blur it out.Then Kirari laughed again.It was as if we were in middle school, using \u2026\u2026 me to chat.\u201cNyahaha. Well, I\u2019m aware that I\u2019ve changed, but if you \u2026\u2026 say that, Ko-kun is pretty changed too, no?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Me?\u201dI tilt my head back at those words.I wonder if Kirari knows me well enough to talk about my changes.That made me wonder.What kind of person was I from Kirari\u2019s point of view?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like a robot? Like, if you talk to it, it will answer you, but if you don\u2019t do anything, it won\u2019t budge?\u201d\u2026. Like a robot, huh?Come to think of it, I think Azusa said something similar to me before.As I recall, that was when Ryuzaki had not yet found out about the relationship between me and Shiho.When I asked Azusa to keep our relationship a secret, she said to me.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Onii-chan so emotional before\u2026\u2026 I was surprised. Onii-chan was a human being, too.\u201dUntil that moment, Azusa had also thought that I was inhuman.And Kirari seemed to feel the same way.\u201cI thought we were pretty good friends, you know?\u3000But when we became high school students, you ignored me like I was a stranger. \u2026\u2026I wondered if I was someone who had a relationship with you that wasn\u2019t that big of a deal to you.\u201d\u201cIs that so \u2026\u2026\u201dI see. It certainly makes sense now that it is said.Until I met Shiho, I was a person without initiative. I was just like a robot, unable to move spontaneously.I think I hardly ever spoke to her, let alone showed any emotion.Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that I had no feelings.\u201cBut recently you have become very lively and \u2026\u2026 easy to understand. You looked like such a jerk when you saw me just now, remember?\u201dWhat, she noticed?Kirari seemed to know that I didn\u2019t seem to want to talk much. But she still wanted to talk to me.\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling it ever since the overnight learning program, but Ko-kun has changed so much. So, you are the same as me. \u2026\u2026 You fell in love and changed as a human being. Right? You changed for Shiho Shimotsuki, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no denying her words.As I silently walk through the mall, I consider her words.Maybe I am just like Kirari.I changed myself for Shiho, too.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Ko-kun, who was unsociable, uncommunicative, and emotionless, would \u2026\u2026 become such a wonderful person.\u201d-Why is she saying that now?What is she trying to say now by making such a statement that hints at something?\u201cI\u2019m so frustrated because I couldn\u2019t make a difference. Once again, I think Shiho Shimotsuki is amazing. \u2026\u2026 Ryu-kun, Ko-kun, and everyone else loves that girl.\u201dSaying this, she unexpectedly grabbed my arm.As if to catch me trying to escape, she gripped it tightly \u2026\u2026 with such force that it hurt.\u201cI wasn\u2019t good enough?\u201d\u2026\u2026 Or maybe those words weren\u2019t just said to me.She let out her emotions as if she were saying them to Ryuzaki as well.\u201cAm I and Shiho Shimotsuki really that different?\u201dWhat was the right answer to that question?\u201cSo I can\u2019t even be a substitute? Hey, Ko-kun\u2026\u2026 I didn\u2019t have to be the best. If I am loved, I can change myself as much as I want. If he doesn\u2019t love me, I\u2019ll try to be more like Shiho Shimotsuki. But why didn\u2019t \u2026\u2026 Ryu-kun and Ko-kun turn their heads towards me?\u201dThe wailing unintentionally overflowed with emotion.I shake off Kirari\u2019s hand and glare at her.I hated Kirari for denying herself so much.It was like looking at the old me, \u2026\u2026 awful and uncomfortable.\u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dWhy can\u2019t I understand?Why does Kirari always, always have a biased point of view on things?\u201cDon\u2019t flatter me. \u2026\u2026 Hey, Kirari, what the hell do you want? Is being loved all you want? Looking at you now, it makes me really sad. \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s true that I\u2019ve changed, and so have you. But the way Kirari has changed is not right. Growth is not the only kind of change. \u2026\u2026 Degeneration is also a change.\u201dI\u2019m sorry to Kirari.But I can say this clearly.\u201cYou were cooler before. Now you\u2019re just a slacker who just wants attention and doesn\u2019t want to get it for herself. \u2026\u2026 Where is the you, that I used to like?\u201dSad.I just can\u2019t stand to see my former best friend who has become nothing more than a flatterer.Me and Kirari are the same?No, no. My change is \u2018growth\u2019, but Kirari\u2019s change is \u2018degeneration\u2019.I don\u2019t want us to be the same.\u201cJust because Ryuzaki doesn\u2019t look at you, now you want to depend on me?\u201dI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not your guardian. I am not your blood relative, nor am I your family. Of course, I am not a saint who can love people unconditionally.For example, if Kirari were my family \u2026\u2026, if she were my sister.I would have loved that part of her as well. No matter how bad she might have been, no matter what she might have done or said to me, I would have accepted it, and I would have made a firm decision to accept it.But Kirari is a stranger.My back is not wide enough to carry the weight of someone else\u2019s life.\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not the same guy I was in middle school anymore. \u2026\u2026 I can\u2019t give, even if you ask me to.\u201dBecause I have someone to whom I want to give my all.I can\u2019t save Kirari by betraying her.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t make me \u2026\u2026 more disappointed.\u201dIt was just the best I could do.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat did Kirari think of those words?I didn\u2019t really know what Kirari was thinking as she stared at me in silence.Just like I used to be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It tasted fishy, and it tasted like blood.Apparently, I had unconsciously bitten my lip.So that\u2019s how strong the anger toward Kirari was.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s as if there is mud in my heart.I felt a sick feeling all over my body, like when you step on a snake\u2019s nest, and suddenly stopped.I turned around somehow, but Kirari was no longer there.After all, she had said whatever she wanted to me, but in the end, she didn\u2019t argue with me.Kirari in junior high school would have said things more clearly.I feel even worse when it\u2019s \u2026\u2026 that one-sided.It\u2019s not that I wanted to hurt her.We are former best friends, but now we are strangers. It would have been fine if we could live separate lives from each other.But Kirari tried to interfere in a strange way, so I said what I wanted to say.I regret that very much.I wonder if there wasn\u2019t another option.I could have muddled the waters, let the situation pass, or even made it go away peacefully\u2026 Regret is running around in my head.Just then, I saw her face this time, and I was already in a bad mood.\u201cHee-hee. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re in a good mood.\u201d\u201cAlbeit a bit distorted.\u201dThere was a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes.She was not an impostor like Kirari.She was a real, Western-style beauty.\u201cWhy are you here? Are you stalking me?\u201dMary was leaning against a lamppost, looking at me like she was waiting for me.\u201cYes. Because Kirari was acting independently today, wasn\u2019t she? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen how lonely she looked because I monopolized Ryoma\u2019s feelings, right? At times like that, it\u2019s easy to show weakness. \u2026\u2026 For example, she might try to get back together with her ex-best friend \u2026.I thought so.\u201dI see\u2026\u2026.It seems that both Kirari and I were dancing in Mary\u2019s palms.\u201cThe lighter the frame, the better it spins. It spins and spins so much that it is pleasant \u2026\u2026, isn\u2019t it? But because it is light, it doesn\u2019t last long. It soon runs out of power and falls over. And then I will crush it.\u201dMary squeezed my hand.It was as if she was squeezing me like Kirari.\u201cSee? It\u2019s just like my scenario. The subheroine, the hero, and the antagonist have all been mangled into a nice mess.\u201dMary looked like a true creator as she said this with a proud expression on her face. It is the nature of creators to become talkative when it comes to their work.\u201cKirari is already doing what I want, isn\u2019t she?\u3000Ryoma turned his back on her, leaving Kotaro as the only person to hang on to. You\u2019re not the kind of person who can hold your own, so you\u2019ll probably end up accepting her, won\u2019t you? I wonder what Kotaro will do when that happens?\u201dIt\u2019s \u2026\u2026 frustrating, but Mary is seeing right through me.I wonder if I, with my weak initiative due to my lack of self-confidence, \u2026\u2026 can really continue to reject Kirari.\u201cWhat\u2019s with the \u201cDon\u2019t think you can get what you want\u201d look? After all, the story is going the way I want it to go.\u201dMary was sneering at me with a triumphant look on her face.I couldn\u2019t say anything in response to her words.(Damn it!)I poisoned my heart.After all, were Ryuzaki and Kirari not as great characters as I thought they were?Will the story go on like this, being made good by the likes of Mary-san?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Slowly, but with a steady rhythm.Late September. The remnants of the summer vacation had worn off and the script for the play \u2026\u2026 was finally completed.In LHR, the preparation time for the festival, Niou-san, who was in charge of the script, gathered the actors and handed out the scripts.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m a little late. The assumption was that we wanted to do the reading and so on in the last week, but reading \u2026\u2026 and writing are quite different. Quite a bit, it took up a lot of my time.\u201dThe apologetic voice was tinged with exhaustion.\u201cThere are only three weeks left until the festival. It\u2019s going to be a busy schedule, but I\u2019m sure all the actors will do their best. I apologize for the inconvenience, especially to the three main characters.\u201dNiou-san lowers her head as she fixes the position of her glasses.Of course, I don\u2019t blame her. After all, she has made it into this product, so of course I have no complaints.\u201cNo, no~! I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience!\u201d\u201cMary, you can\u2019t say that, okay? It\u2019s outrageous and disturbing.\u201dMary-san is still being a doofus at school as usual.Ryuzaki gave her a sharp look, and then this time she spoke kindly to Niou-san.\u201cThank you so much for your help this time. I can count on you, Futako. You are indeed the class president\u2026. Once again, I have a lot of respect for you. Don\u2019t worry about being late.\u201dRyuzaki is still calling out to girls.It must be the habit of the harem protagonist to hit on girls without regard.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be forgiven for not being on time. I don\u2019t like that kind of compromise, so please be careful what you say. Also, I don\u2019t think you should call me by my first name. It\u2019s too casual for someone of the opposite gender.\u201dHowever, Niou-san is unusually the type of character who is not influenced by Ryuzaki. Perhaps the only one, she is in a neutral position.Perhaps that is why the harem protagonist-sama\u2019s charm was not working. Ryuzaki chuckles and shrugs.\u201cGood grief, Futako is always cold to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Enough\u2026 Um, so could you please check the story? And if there are any misspellings or omissions, please point them out to me. Also, if there is anything wrong with the dialogue or the story, please don\u2019t hesitate to tell me.\u201dWith that being said, I turned the page.The synopsis of the story was almost the same as that of the movie I was familiar with.A man is turned into a beast by an evil witch. He must find his \u201ctrue love\u201d or the spell cast on him will not be broken. Since then, the Beast has been searching for true love.Ten years have passed since then.Meanwhile, a beautiful woman with a good reputation in town is being courted by a handsome, popular, but vulgar and egotistical hunter. She is a quiet girl who likes to read and fantasize. She is not fond of people like the hunter and is fed up with his advances.One day, the beautiful girl wandered into the forest and was captured by the beast. The beast forcefully presses her to \u2018love him\u2019 but she firmly rejects him.Since then, the beautiful woman has been confined to an old castle deep in the forest. At first, Beauty cries all the time, but it is a mysterious place with talking furniture. They comforted her, and she gradually got better.However, the beast\u2019s courtship continued. Regardless of Beauty\u2019s refusal, the Beast was pressing her daily to love him.Seeing Beauty not giving in to his threats, the Beast became attracted to her strong heart. Beauty also comes to know and love the Beast\u2019s gentle nature. The two are drawn to each other\u2026 One day, the hunter, who was looking for Beauty, rides into the castle.The hunter and the Beast fight, and the Beast is victorious. The Beast, though mortally wounded, drove the hunter off a cliff. But the life of the Beast was about to disappear.At that moment, Beauty conveyed her love to the Beast. She cried out not to disappear and kissed him \u2026 and lo and behold, the Beast returned to his human form. He was cured of his injuries and became a healthy young man, and he and Beauty were finally united.He has finally found his true love and the spell is broken.From then on, the two lead a peaceful life together. Surrounded by talking furniture, they love each other forever\u2026\u2013And then I read that.I tilted my head a little.\u201cWhat? I thought the Beast was a prince\u2026\u201dI understand that some details are different from the original story due to time constraints.But there was a big discrepancy.The Beast was originally supposed to be a handsome prince. After the Beast\u2019s spell was broken, I think they became a beautiful and well-matched couple.\u201c\u2026\u2026I like the Cinderella story.\u201dHowever, it seems that Niou-san intentionally intended to add that kind of setting to the story.\u201cThe young man who is bewitched as the Beast is a poor boy who just wandered into an old castle where a wicked witch used to live \u2013 that\u2019s how it\u2019s set up. He becomes a beast by accident, but thanks to the magic, he meets a beautiful woman and becomes happy\u2026 Isn\u2019t that so wonderful? At the very least, I think it\u2019s much more romantic than a story about a well-endowed prince who just takes a beautiful woman as his wife.\u201dCome to think of it, I think Niou-san once said that \u2018Cinderella is the most beautiful story in the world\u2019. So she was influenced by it to the fullest.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, but I thought \u2026\u2026 Nakayama-san being a handsome prince was a bit much to ask.\u201d\u2026She has a point.I see, so she took my image into consideration too.\u201cNihihihi. I think it\u2019s good, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s as if he really is Kotaro!\u201dMary was pleased when she read the synopsis.So the main character is like me \u2026\u2026? Well, when you put it that way, you might be right.I, too, am a person who was originally discovered by Shiho, who has a different status.The opposite gender, but \u2026\u2026 maybe the same as Cinderella, who discovered\u2026.. Prince Charming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
