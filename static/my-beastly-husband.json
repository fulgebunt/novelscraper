His long slender fingers were placed on her sensitive pink pearl and was in constant\u00a0motion, moving in a rhythmic fashion. A loud slushing sound could be heard, along with his tired panting and her breathless moaning.\"Produce more water baby, I'm thirsty.\" He smacked her bum several times, ushering her to get wetter.\"Nuuu\u2026nuuuuu\u2026\"\u00a0she covered her mouth with her delicate hands in an attempt to restrain her moans. She felt as though she was being sucked dry. His tongue was moving\u00a0left and right,\u00a0exploring her deepest regions. It gave\u00a0rise to a numbing sensation that spread through her entire being, causing her to produce even more juice.\"Nooo\u2026. plea\u2026se.. stop..I'm begging you\u2026 it hurts!\" she begged as he stuck a finger into her behind all of a sudden.She yelped and wriggled, trying to squeeze his finger out\u00a0of her.\u00a0 Her essence was rapidly drying up due to the sudden pain.When QieErXi realized\u00a0that she was not as lubricated as he would like, he looked up with a hint of dissatisfaction in his eyes.He lowered his body onto hers and began kissing her lips. Even though\u00a0her core region lacked moisture, her mouth had an abundance of it.MoSha's tongue was held hostage by his lips as he sucked on her tongue vigorously.Her core region and behind were ravished\u00a0by\u00a0one\u00a0finger each.Even though\u00a0it was painful, she dared not infuriate him in\u00a0fear that he would get frustrated and treat her\u00a0in an even rougher manner. All she could do was clench onto the piece of fabric beneath her as she surrendered herself to him.After feeling that she was adequately aroused, he pulled his fingers out of her\u00a0and sticker\u00a0them into her mouth, commanding\u00a0her to lick them cleanly.When she\u00a0was done licking, he withdrew his finger, grabbed her by\u00a0the waist\u00a0and flipped her over, allowing her to straddle him. He held her hand gently and slowly led\u00a0her over\u00a0to his burning rod. He urged her to use her womanhood to swallow his manhood whole.Mosha knew\u00a0that there was\u00a0no escape for her. Beastmen possess an extremely strong libido\u00a0and would definitely not stop before\u00a0she fainted\u00a0from climaxing.Moreover, he was huge. For him\u00a0to enter her entirely, difficult would be an understatement.When she slept\u00a0with him for the first time, her entrance was torn, causing her immense\u00a0pain. To the extent that she had to lie in bed to recuperate for one entire week.That entire week, he did not lay a\u00a0finger on her. However, ever since\u00a0that incident, he made sure she did the job of sending his \"little brother\" into her \"little sister\" herself, in fear that the incident might repeat itself again.Even so, he was still too huge for her and every time he entered, she could barely endure it.Looking back into his crazed\u00a0eyes that were turning red now, she knew\u00a0that he was at his limit and she could delay no more. He was\u00a0filled to the brim\u00a0with\u00a0pent up sexual frustration\u00a0and was losing his patience. If she dilly dallied any longer, she would be the one subjected to suffering the brunt of his \"attack\".Gritting her teeth, she grabbed onto his \"little brother\" and sent his \"head\" into her.\u00a0She placed\u00a0her hand over\u00a0her mouth as she dealt with the pain and sat down\u00a0slowly onto him\u2026Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

This made things even worse and after a relatively long period of time, only one third of his rod had passed the entrance, leaving the remaining two third hanging outside. At this moment, QieErXi's endurance was at its limit and his eyes were turning bloodshot. He grabbed onto her slender waist and pressed her down forcefully. \"Plop\" finally most of his \"little brother\" made it past the entrance.\"Ahhh\u2026\" Mosha arched her back and let out a long moan. Her delicate fingered were clenched into a ball of fist and her nails sunk into her flesh. It was too painful. Being tormented by him like this every night didn't improve her immunity as she still felt such pain when doing the deed.But he wasn't done. Before she could catch a breath, he turned her around and pressed her below him. He lifted her leg, placed it on shoulder and cruelly pushed himself into her in one swift movement.Alas, everything has enter as he let out a satisfied groan.At this moment, Mosha was already unable to make any sound. All she could do was grabbed onto that piece of animal fabric beneath her as she arched her back to make it past this heart wrenching pain. Her crevice was hit by him and his entire\"head was already inside. Even though this is was not the first time he entered her, however the pain experienced almost made her past out.Unwilling to wait for Mosha to get accustomed to his size, QieErXi was itching to get on with it as he started thirsting inside her. Every thrust ruthlessly penetrated her innermost core. Mosha's knuckles were twisted white as she tilted her head upwards, and curved her lower back while constantly being thrusted. The strength he used was so large that she was being pushed upwards with every thrust, only to be pulled back down again. This motion was repeated with increasing force, causing her to tremble as he charged around violently inside of her. At times, he would pierce right into the most unbearable spot in her body, causing her to shiver uncontrollably.It has been a month since Mosha first came to this world filled with beastmen.Ever since she was thrown to QieMoXi to be his mate, she was most afraid of the arrival of nighttime.In the day, QiMoXi would at least be considerate of her, giving her whatever she wanted. However, once they were in bed during the night, he would transform into a totally different person. Repeatedly tormenting her ferociously, without a care for her feelings and resistance.Mosha was an orphan, she grew up in the orphanage without her parents, thus she craved having a family of her own. Witnessing her fiance and best friend cheating in her house, on her bed made her world collapse.Mosha ran out of her house after witnessing that scene, not knowing how long she had ran, she found herself at the edge of a cliff. Wanting to end her life, she jumped down the cliff. However, for some reason, she did not die. When she awoken, she realised that she was in a different world.Using a week's time, she figured out that she was in another world. It was a world where beastmen roam free. There were no men or women here. As long as one was able to transform into a beast, he would be male. Those not able to transform were female. On a side note, the 'females here possessed male genitals. It could be said that this was an entirely different world and she was the only oddity.The person who saved her was a beastmen from the lion tribe. The elders from the tribe took out several animal skins, saying she looked similar to the images of the female on it. The female depicted on the animal skin possess the strongest ability to propagate. Hence they insisted that she be the mate of the leader of the tribe. The leader was QieErXi, the strongest and most valiant white lion in the tribe. Together, they shall breed the strongest offspring.Initially, QieErXi had already chosen his mate all that was left is the ceremony. However, for the future of the tribe, breeding the strongest offspring was a must. Thus he could only give up on his original choice and instead choose Mosha as his mate. Mosha on the other hand, was in no position to reject this offer. For the sake of her survival, she could only accept it.Their relationship was neither that of resentment or love.One could say that even though QiErXi treated her well, he did not love her. The only bane was how rough he was. Mosha had no idea if he had always been that way or that he was treating her as such due to his dissatisfaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mosha was half-kneeling and half-lying on the bed as he entered her and moved his hands over to her snow white chest and started kneading vigorously.\"Ahh\u2026 ahhhh\" Mosha's vision blurred as she tightened her grip on the animal skin below .\"En\u2026you're still so tight after so long, how are we going to have children? Are you going to crush my child! Or is it because I'm not working hard enough? When are you going to be able to accommodate me?\" Qie Er Xi asked as he nibbled her earlobe. Down below, he thrust into her vigorously, increasing the deepness of his thrust.\"No\u2026Qie Er Xi\u2026Don't\u2026 lighter\u2026 lighter\" How long is he going to last? This way, she might die. Mosha was flustered and kept shaking her head as tears streamed down her face.Unsure of how long it has been, Mosha didn't even have the strength left to moan. She was pressed down by his body as she whimpered softly. On the other hand, Qie Er Xi got fiercer as he battled and once again, he flipped her over and placed a cushion under her waist, for easier entry.He slowly pulled out till his \"little brother's\" head left before suddenly thrustingin. Feeling her tighten unconsciously due to his entry, his hot steel rod was clasped so comfortably by her. This made him become rougher with every thrust, while she felt like her body was falling apart.Under his rough handling, Mosha orgasmed uncountable times while he came twice. However, he refused to let her go. Looking at her twitching abdomen, he playfully pressed onto her abdomen.Because of his size, when he entered Mosha fully, she felt bloated and uncomfortable. Moreover, he shot two loads and plugged the entrance, not allowing any liquid to leak out. His large hands were pressing onto her abdomen while his rod kept squeezing inwards.Mosha felt like she was going to explode. Unable to bear it any longer, she cried out loud. Her slender legs were also thrashing in midair.\"Hurts\u2026my stomach hurts\u2026 Qie Er Xi please\u2026please\u2026\" Mosha's face was soaked in tears as she twitched while begging him.\"Ennn\u2026\" Qie Er Xi was sucked so comfortably by her that his waist went numb. He gave a low growl and once again plunged deeply into her, his burning rod sprayed energetically as she sobbed and shivered. Under extreme joy and pain, she fainted.When Mosha woke up, Qie Er Xi was nowhere to be found, looking at the bright sun outside, she knew that he had brought his tribesmen out to hunt again. Whenever the weather was good, they would always hunt and she had already gotten used to it by now.Taking a deep breath, mentally preparing herself, she used both her arms to support her aching body.\"Wuu\u2026\" She felt something flow out of her lower body. She quickly pulled over the animal skin on the side to stop the leakage. Bending her waist and holding the animal skin, she moved carefully over to the bathroom, taking one \u00a0step at a time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After travelling to and fro several times, Mosha was dead tired. She finally managed to fill the bathtub. Removing the animal hide that she was currently wearing, she entered and sat in the bathtub.\u201cShhhsss, it\u2019s cold.\u201d Mosha shivered. Even though it was already spring, and the weather was getting hotter, bathing in cold water was tough for Mosha. But there was no other choice. She had to make a fire if she wanted hot water. The pot used came from the shells of animals and it wasn\u2019t big. If she wanted to boil a pail of hot water using those shells, she had to boil the water several times. Besides, if she\u2019s finally done with the last bit of water, the water she boil at the start would have already gone cold.Mosha took a simple bath and cleaned her *ahem* by sticking her fingers in to remove the leftover juices.Her lady bits were swollen. To the extent whereby just touching it would feel like she had been stabs by countless needles. Enduring the ache and pain, she completed her bath and exited the bathtub feeling shivering. She took out the anti-inflammatory cream given by the tribe\u2019s doctor, Ka Rui Da and applied it. Looking at the small amount of cream left in the wooden box, she sighed. Looks like she will have to get more of it.She was embarrassed at how fast she used the cream. She went through the entire box in a few days. However, every time Qie Er Xi did it, it would hurt. If she did not apply the cream, the swelling would not subside in time and when night came, it is just going to be unendurable for her.When she was done applying the cream, she took out a clothing from the closet. To be exact, it was an animal hide with three holes for the head and arms. That piece of \u2018clothing\u2019 was stuffy and ugly. All the other tribesmen just tied a piece of animal hide on their waist. However, she was not able to do that. With a lack of better idea currently, all she could do was come up \u00a0with this.Mosha took the animal skin that was on the bed and the animal skin she had just taken off, and soaked them in the bathtub. After washing, she took them out to dry on the huge rock outside their hut.Returning to their hut, she ate two fruits for breakfast and headed out to work. \u2018Females\u2019 here didn\u2019t need to hunt however they were expected to look for fruits and herbs.Although the tribesmen think that she was too small, delicate and weak thus they didn\u2019t request for her to work, Mosha did not want to leech off them. Therefore, she would still collect herbs and pick seeds.The plants here were not entirely new to Mosha. Most of them existed in her previous world. She wanted to look for paddy and cotton and bring some of their seeds back to the tribe. That way, even when winter comes, even if they do not hunt, they would at least have something to eat.After dressing herself properly, Mosha carried a rattan basket and walked out. The village was rather empty now. The males had gone out to hunt while the females had gone out to collect fruits. All that was left was some females, kids and injured males.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5Chapter 5Just when Mosha walked to the entrance of the tribe, her name was called out.\u201cMosha, where\u2019re you going?\u201dShe turned around, the person who called her was Rui En, a male member of the tribe. Mosha had heard that it was Rui En who rescued her and brought her back to the tribe. Seeing his injured arm, she felt guilty. After all, it was him who had saved her and, yet she didn\u2019t even bother thanking him properly.When Mosha had just woken up, she was badly shocked. Busy accepting the atrocities of her new home, thanking her benefactor did not even cross her mind. After that, she was thrown to Qie Er Xi to be his partner. Subsequently, getting injured on their first night, she rested in bed for the following week. It had only been a few days since she recovered, and she was busy looking for seeds. Thus, she forgot about her benefactor and threw him to the back of her mind.Mosha looked at Rui En with a guilty expression and said \u201cRui En, thank you for saving me, how\u2019s your injury?\u201dHearing this, Rui En laughed \u201cthis is nothing, there\u2019s no need for thanks. Let me tell you a secret. Actually, my arm had healed long ago, I\u2019m just pretending to be injured so that I can slack off. Please don\u2019t tell the others.\u201dMosha laughed and looked at his handsome and cute face that was paired with a set of golden eyes that looks like a half-moon. She had to admit that he was really gorgeous. If she had not seen him transform, she would not believe that he was a beast-man.Speaking of which, Qie Er Xi was rather handsome too. Just that he had never smiled so gently at her. No, it could be said that he had never smiled at her before. When they were together, they only did two things. It was either \u2018that\u2019 or eating.Looking at Mosha\u2019s sadden expression, Rui En worriedly asked \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong? Did Qie Er Xi bully you?\u201dRui En knew that Qie Er Xi had previously chosen a partner. However, due to the pressure exerted by the elders, he was forced to choose Mosha. Even if Qie Er Xi was displeased, it was not unexpected. However, he did not think that Qie Er Xi was tasteless enough to bully a female. If Qie Er Xi really did do so, he would unhesitatingly snatch Mosha away from him. Although Mosha looked different from the other \u2018females\u2019 in the tribe, she had an adorable and pitiful look, which made him want to embrace and protect her in his arms.\u201cNo, no, he treats me really well.\u201d Mosha hid her loneliness and flashed a smile. Qie Er Xi was her husband, as the saying goes \u2018you cannot wash your dirty linen in public\u2019. Regardless of how he treated her, she did not want outsiders to know.Looking at the forced smile on Mosha\u2019s face, Rui En was certain that his assumption was right. He was secretly determined to have a good talk with Qie Er Xi when he returned. Since Mosha had already become Qie Er Xi\u2019s partner, he should treat her well.Making his decision, he smiled to Mosha and said, \u201cyou have not told me where you\u2019re heading.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking of walking around to familiarize myself with the area and in the meantime, look for some wild fruit seeds.\u201d Mosha replied honestly.\u201cIf that\u2019s so, let me accompany you. I\u2019ve nothing to do anyway. Besides, I could bring you around, to familiarize yourself with the area.\u201d Rui En laughed and invited himself along.\u201cReally? That\u2019s great! Thanks, Rui En.\u201d \u00a0Hearing that Rui En was willing to bring her around, Mosha was elated. After all, this was her first time leaving the village and she was afraid.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so courteous, protecting and caring for females is the duty of males.\u201d Rui En patted his chest with an exaggerated action.This made Mosha laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With Rui En leading the way, Mosha managed to gather a tidy number of wild berries in no time. However she was unable to find what she was really looking for.Dumbass! Mosha scolded herself. It's spring now, that type of seeds can only be found in autumn. What was I thinking?Tugging on Rui En's sleeves, she stopped his search.When he tilted his head to look at her, she asked, \"Are there any plants that produce a soft and fluffy material?\"Rui En thought for a moment before looking around. He gestured to a small plant and said \"that must be it\". We call those white dumplings. Its fruits are white, soft and fluffy. The birds love putting those in their nests.Mosha was elated. That must be the cotton plant! Although she has never seen one before, based on Rui En's description, that must be it.She hurriedly knelt down and dug a cluster of the plants up together with the surrounding soil and carefully place it into her basket.Rui En got curious at her actions and questioned \"why are you digging them? They can't be eaten!\"Without lifting her head, Mosha answered proudly \"I'm not consuming them. I'm making clothes out of them. When I succeed, I'll make a set for you too.\"What was the difference between clothes and beast-skin skirt? Rui En had no clue. Even so, his heart\u00a0 warmed up when Mosha said she would make a set of clothes for him. Rui En was determined to dig up all the 'white dumplings' he comes across when hunting later on.After Mosha was done with the 'white dumplings', her gaze fell onto a patch of sweet potatoes.\"Sweet potatoes! They actually have them here.\" She recognized them after having planted uncountable numbers of them at the orphanage.After Mosha dug them up, she hurried back to the tribe to have breakfast. Her rattan basket was filled to the brim. Satisfied with their bountiful harvest, the duo went back merrily.Because they hadn't gone far, they reached the tribe after a short walk. Not having eaten breakfast, Mosha's stomach started growling. Being thoughtful of Rui En's injury, she offered him breakfast at her place. Both of them entered the hut and Mosha proceeded to cook up a pot of bone soup seasoned with some berries.While Mosha was keeping herself busy, Rui En sat in a corner and observed Mosha. He couldn't help but feel a tiny bit jealous of Er Xi. How was he deserving of Mosha when he hadn't done anything. It was obviously him who brought Mosha back. How did Mosha ended up being given to Er Xi?The meal was prepared in no time and Mosha served a bowl of soup to Rui En. After having a sip, Rui En muttered \"Un. It's delicious, really delicious.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So eat more. We got more here. Try some soup, will you?\u201d Moussa felt satisfied when she saw that he liked to eat what she had made. Chelsea\u00a0had never eaten anything she cooked. She wanted to cook for him, but he gave her no opportunity.\u201cYes. You know, it tastes great. I never thought the soup made with the bones would be such a good one. We used to throw those out. That was a waste.\u201dRyan was amazed. He never expected her to have that kind of talent when she was too small. But she made the food so delectable.\u201cHehehe. If you like it, visit often. I\u2019ll make it for you.\u201d Moussa felt so relaxed with him as opposed to the pressure of being with Chelseae.\u201cWell, I shall come again and again. Don\u2019t be angry with me and throw me out. \u201d Ryan was very pleased to answer her invitation.They both had a good time at lunch. After eating, Moussa then plowed the ground in the yard with the help of Ryan and planted all the seedlings she brought home.She had never planted it before, so she didn\u2019t know if it would survive. But once planted, there was hope. She was also careful to water the seedlings.Shortly after that, Chelsea\u00a0came back from the hunt. He brought the prey back into the storage area. When he went out, there were two people behind the house talking and laughing about something. He walked with a gloomy face. Looking at the green seedlings on the ground, he frowned and asked, \u201cWhat are these?\u201dMoussa flinched and subconsciously took a step back. She responded in a small voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a white dango. I wanted to grow them myself to see if they could live.\u201dChelsea\u00a0felt that she feared him. He didn\u2019t feel very comfortable. One minute ago, he saw her with Ryan laughing and joking. So how did she turn into a different person as soon as she saw him?Ryan could see everything and could not help but say to Chelsea, \u201cHey, you\u2019re back.\u00a0 There\u2019s something I need to tell you. Let\u2019s go to my place for one minute.\u201dChelsea\u00a0glanced at Moussa and nodded to go with him.When Moussa saw that both men had departed, she entered the house in silence. It was dark, and he had returned. Her nightmare was going to start again. She was beginning to feel scared.Chelsea\u00a0was not long gone, but his face did not look good. He started roasting without speaking a word. Seeing that he was not in good spirits, Moussa did not dare to provoke him. So she sat quietly and watched him busy.Chelsea\u00a0soon finished roasting. He saw that there was still leftover bone stock in the pot at one end. He was like, \u201cWhat is that?\u201dNot expecting him to speak to her out of the blue, Moussa was startled. Then she reacted and realized what he was asking. She responded in a hushed voice, \u201cIt\u2019s a soup made from bones. I made it when Ryan was here for lunch.\u201dChelsea\u2019s face became even more gloomy. He picked up one spoonful and tried it. He never expected it to be good, so he took out two bowls. Chelsea\u00a0gave one to Moussa and a slice of roasted meat. She took the roasted meat and slowly ate it into little bites.They didn\u2019t have any entertainment there. So, after dinner, he would soon put her back to bed and do whatever shameful and painful things he could. That was her biggest fear.So now she just had to delay as long as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She dared not resist and allowed him to undress her.However, Chelsea\u00a0did not immediately jump at her as he did every day. Instead, he removed his clothes and lay down beside her. He took her hand and carried it to his already hardened baton. He ordered, \u201cTouch it, and lick it.\u201dMoussa looked timidly at the enormous dark crimson stem. He told her to lick it, but she\u2019d never licked it before. Plus, she was feeling a little dirty.Seeing her hesitation, Chelsea\u00a0frowned in displeasure. Then he pressed her head towards his crotch and urged, \u201cCome on.\u201d\u201cNo-\u201c, she opened her mouth to reject. When she did, Chelsea\u00a0took advantage of it to enter. With Moussa\u2019s head stuck, she couldn\u2019t get away. All she could do was hold the disgusting feeling in her mouth. But it was not possible to control the amount of saliva produced.\u201cLick it with your tongue! Don\u2019t just hold it.\u201dWhen she refused to cooperate, Chelsea\u00a0lost patience and slapped her in the ass.\u201cWu wu wu \u2026\u201dMoussa knelt on the bed and wrapped her mouth around his huge shaft. She was struggling with how hard it was to swallow him. Her tongue even licked on it once or twice from time to time.He kept her head down. He controlled the pumping rate and kept squeezing, suffocating Moussa in tears.He finally got his release when Moussa felt like she was on the verge of suffocation. But he pressed her head and did not let her escape, spurting a load into her mouth.Moussa swallowed it forcefully, but it was too much. She couldn\u2019t keep up with him and was choking. Chelsea\u00a0finally let her go. Moussa dropped to the side of the bed and coughed violently.But Chelsea\u00a0didn\u2019t know how to feel sorry for her, or he just wanted her to feel bad. When Moussa\u2019s cough eased a little, he turned her over, separated her legs, and bent over to lick and kiss her flower.Chelsea\u00a0seemed to love the nectar coming out of her flower. He sucked on it every night for a long time. Moussa got used to it and could no longer wait until he sucked it. After all, that was the only thing that didn\u2019t hurt and felt good.But Chelsea\u00a0was a little different tonight as he sucked for only a short time. He made her come once and then stopped. Then he held her and sat her up and let her guide herself into the hot rod.Sensing that he was different tonight, she didn\u2019t dare dawdle for fear of annoying him again.Holding his hot cane, she sat on it.\u201cAh \u2026\u201dAlthough she was controlling the situation, she cried out in pain from the extreme pain of having her flower stretched to the limit. Her body shuddered. She knew it wasn\u2019t over yet, because there was still some of his hot rod left outside.Sure enough. Just as soon as the last wave of pain had passed, Chelsea\u00a0grabbed her waist and pressed her down. Then he pushed up and at last reached the end.\u201cMmmm ..\u201d Again, her womb\u2019s entrance was pierced. It was so unbearable that Moussa opened her mouth and bit him on the shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stepped back a little and pushed hard. Moussa received a few blows and then loosened up, feeling like she was about to be knocked apart by him. She quickly hugged his neck and hung on to him.Little by little, she no longer had the strength to cling to his neck. She moaned softly and slipped down. Chelsea\u00a0smacked her on the ass a few times to comfort her. But eventually, she got soft again.Chelsea\u00a0ran out of patience and put a finger in her ass again. \u201cAh!\u201d Moussa moved upward in pain but was pulled back again by Chelseae. The hardness in her flower and the finger in her ass came and went viciously at once.\u201cChelsea. It hurts. Please. Please. Take it out\u2014Wu wu wu. Moussa suffered so much that she could no longer bear it and wept while begging. She was afraid he might notice her chrysanthemum, although their female here used it. But she was too small, and he was too big. She\u2019d be dead if he broke in.Chelsea\u00a0ignored her cries and slammed his way into her flower with no technique. His fingers went from one to two in her ass.\u201cAhhh! Ah!.\u201dMoussa screamed several times. Her head was thrown back. With the rhythm of his in and out, she mindlessly rocked to the beat. Moussa thought she was going to die. Chelsea\u2019s lower body went in and out dozens of times. Finally, he came and roared.He put Moussa down and made her turn around. She turned her back on him and sobbed.Chelsea\u00a0pressed himself to her from behind. He put his finger in her ass again and poked it up.\u201cNo!\u201dMoussa cried aloud. She got up and pushed him.\u201cChelsea. It hurts. Don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move. It\u2019s because it hurts that I\u2019m stretching you.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s other hand was holding her waist down to keep her from moving.\u201cDon\u2019t. Chelsea. Don\u2019t. I\u2019ll die. Don\u2019t .\u201d Moussa cried even louder. It was like she\u2019d been crying lately out of fear.Chelsea\u00a0was distracted by her crying and pulled his fingers out. He turned her around and asked with a deep voice. \u201cWhat are you crying? I didn\u2019t satisfy you?\u201d\u201cNo. No.\u201d Moussa hastily shook her head and denied it.\u201cDid I mistreat you?\u201d Chelsea\u00a0asked again. Today, Ryan reminded him to be good to her. Did she tell Ryan something?\u201cNo. No. You\u2019ve been very good to me.\u201d In this world, having food and shelter should be good enough. Moussa responded without thinking.\u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d Chelsea\u00a0raised his eyebrows in confusion. To be fair, he really wasn\u2019t too happy with his partner. She couldn\u2019t bear any weight on her shoulders, her hands, and she was small and couldn\u2019t climb trees. Maybe even gathering wild fruit was an issue.But he could handle the whole thing. He was strong enough to support both of them, so it didn\u2019t matter if she hadn\u2019t done something. The point was that she was too weak to satisfy him in bed.Whenever he got excited, she fainted \u2014 what a disappointment.The only good thing about her, when he saw her, was that her body was smooth and fragrant and that she was very comfortable to hold. She also had two holes down there that he could enter. Unfortunately, the back one was too tight, and his size could not get in. He wanted to stretch it, but she never stopped crying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Moussa said in a very aggrieved manner. \u201cBecause you are in pain. This is why I\u2019m stretching you out.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for the concern that she was in too much pain and didn\u2019t want to hurt her, he would have gone right in without making an effort. He should be considered thoughtful, no? Chelsea\u00a0didn\u2019t understand what she was crying about. The females of their tribe rarely cry.\u201cHmm.\u201d Moussa felt beaten by meeting someone you couldn\u2019t reason with. She had to take his hand and beg softly, \u201cChelsea. Please. Just leave it be. Please.\u201dChelsea\u00a0watched her for a while and told her, \u201cI shall not touch you for a moment. I will go back when it has loosened a little.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Moussa realized he didn\u2019t give up. She wanted to go on begging for it. When she opened her mouth, he made out with her.A pair of large hands also gripped her thighs at the same time, spreading them wide apart. He pulled her, smashing his sugarcane into her flower.\u201cAhhh. Don\u2019t.\u201dMoussa felt that Chelsea\u00a0wanted to tear her apart and get his entire length inside her. The tearing sensation and strength of the impact pushed her to scream.Chelsea\u00a0felt as if he was being squeezed tightly. That flower\u2019s inner walls squirmed and sucked him in.Chelsea\u00a0moaned in comfort as he pounded into her like a jackhammer.\u00a0 He hit deep inside her again and again without pity. While enjoying her earlobe, he said excitedly, \u201cYou suck so bad and still, say no? You mustn\u2019t faint tonight. I will let you loose, and let you loose!\u201dMoussa gripped the animal skin underneath her. She was afraid that he would knock her out. The flower was already red and puffed up below. It was swallowing his huge object with difficulty, and her flesh was already numb with pain.\u201cGently. Please. Gently. That is too deep. Ah!\u201dEven though Moussa knew that no matter how hard she begged, he couldn\u2019t really be gentle, but she couldn\u2019t help but beg for it, and her little hand unconsciously pressed on her mouth.Hearing the moans coming out of her small mouth, Chelsea\u00a0became even more enthusiastic. He lifted one of her legs over his shoulder and reached down with his big hand, parting her petals that kept twitching so that he could get deeper inside.\u201cAh!\u201dMoussa couldn\u2019t describe what it felt like anymore. It was like Chelsea\u00a0was piercing her entire body. She was about to pass out again. If she did, it was fine, and then the torture would end.Unfortunately, Chelsea\u00a0hadn\u2019t had enough. Seeing that she was about to pass out again, he smirked and pushed two fingers into her ass.\u201cMmmm.\u201dThe pain under her body was so intense that Moussa came to her senses. Her flower also grew tighter with pain.\u201cMmmm.\u201dChelsea\u00a0moaned, feeling on the point of reaching the peak while she squeezed him. After a dozen of quick in-and-out strokes, he buried his hot rod into the deepest part of her and roared as he came. His warm fluid did not end at its canal but went directly into the womb and its inner walls.\u201cAh!\u201dMoussa received a surge of stimulus and came hard.Chelsea\u00a0picked her up to calm her breathing. After the release, his shank became flaccid. He didn\u2019t hold it but plugged it in her wet and slippery flower. The two fingers inside her ass started to move and turn, slowly opening the tight entry.Moussa snapped out of the afterglow of her climax in pain and fear.\u00a0 But she didn\u2019t dare move because his hot rod was still inside her. If she moved, she\u2019d probably give him another boost.\u201cChelsea. Don\u2019t. Please. Please.\u201dMoussa gripped the animal skin beneath her and begged him pitifully with tears streaming down her face.Chelsea\u00a0was fed up with her crying, his fingers were forcefully pushed inside, and he growled. \u201cWhy are you crying? The moment I touch you, you say that you do not want it. If you don\u2019t want me to feel it, then who else is allowed? I\u2019m telling you, I am your male. The two holes here are for me to play with and enjoy. So you could give me children. These are your obligations. Why do you have to cry? Look at which female like you that when the male touch her, says no?They want the male to have the good physical strength to have more of this.\u201dMoussa did not know what to say. She only shook her head, choking in tears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He helped Moussa put on her clothes and picked her up, then walked out.Moussa did not know where he was going to take her. Anyway, as long as Chelsea\u00a0didn\u2019t toss her on the bed. But it was already dark outside, and you could clearly hear the roar of wild animals.Moussa clung to Chelsea\u2019s neck in fear. Is he tired of her and wanted to throw her out?\u201cChelsea, I.\u201dMoussa was just about to beg him not to throw her away when he covered her mouth to keep her from making a sound.Moussa then noticed that he had taken her outside the window of someone\u2019s house.Since the window was not closed, they could clearly hear the people\u2019s noise inside the room.\u201cAh give me! Give me more attention! Ah so good! Come again, dear! Yes, eat me and tear me!\u201dMoussa was shocked to hear a hoarse male voice shouting frantically. She didn\u2019t have to look to know what was going on in the room. She never thought Chelsea\u00a0would bring her to eavesdrop on someone else\u2019s business.Following that were familiar sounds of banging bodies with ambiguous gasps. There was also the sound of climax.Moussa blushed at the sounds. She struggled in his arms and wanted him to take her away.Chelsea\u2019s hands tighten around her waist to stop her from struggling and forced her to listen further.\u201cBaby, do you want to cut me off? You\u2019re so tight. Relax, relax, relax. Do you feel good, baby? Do you feel good when I bang you like this? Do you want me to do it more?\u201dAfter a while, another more wild sound came from inside the room.\u201cSander, Ah! Faster and harder! Bang all of me! You are so intense! I love you so much.Ah!\u201dMoussa could not listen to it anymore. She covered her ears with her hands.Chelsea\u00a0got so fired up himself that he picked up Moussa and left as quickly as he could.They just stepped into their house. Before they could return to the bed, Chelsea\u00a0held her against the door. He ripped off his animal skin skirt, pulled her clothes up, snug between her legs, and pushed in hard.\u201cMmm,\u201d Moussa muffled a moan. It was good that she was still wet enough from his previous entry. He then went in so hard that it did not hurt her too much. Perhaps she was already used to such pain.This never-before-tried position stimulated Chelsea\u2019s beast. He kissed her almost like a bite while riding her legs, relentlessly pushing in, pulling out, and pushing in again.The door behind Moussa slammed back against her and made a loud rattling sound. Moussa\u2019s back rubbed with the rough door, but a strange feeling of pleasure rose. Moussa\u2019s heart tightened. Could she be a legendary masochist? After being treated by him like this, she could still experience a strange feeling of pleasure after getting used to it.\u201cAh!\u201d Chelsea\u2019s fierce upward thrusts brought her back to her senses.\u201cBeg me to go harder! Beg me to rip you apart and eat you. Say that.\u201dChelsea\u00a0quenched his thirst a little and forced her to say what other females would tell if they had been submissive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was so humiliating that she could not say it, but the situation in front of her did not allow her to refuse.Moussa gritted her teeth, clung to his shoulders, and panted in his ear, saying intermittently. \u201cChelsea. Please. Harder. Please tear me apart. Eat me. Ahhh!\u201dChelsea was so happy to hear her. He pinned her down and started a series of thrusts. At the same time, he was imitating the beastman named Sander, gasping in her ear and saying all the dirty words.\u201cBaby. You\u2019re so tight. Baby. Relax, baby. Baby. Your little hole down there seems to have countless little mouths sucking me. I want to bang your hole. Baby \u2026\u201dMoussa got excited by his whispered soft words and the mighty blows underneath her body. Her body tingled, and she felt the pain of her walls being stretched open didn\u2019t seem so unbearable anymore.She didn\u2019t know if that female beast influenced her, but she suddenly felt that having a strong male seemed good too. At least it could give her a sense of security so that she would no longer be afraid in the dark. As for the unbearable pain he was giving her, she should get used to it over time. She didn\u2019t know how long it took, but Chelsea was finally satisfied and released her.Moussa felt that her entire lower body was numb from his efforts, and she could not feel it. Chelsea was in a position where the two were joined together and carried her back to the bed.Moussa saw that he had no intention of pulling out his softened wand. She knew he still wanted to, but she was already too sore and weak to bear it.After thinking about it, she took the initiative to move closer to him and said softly and warmly, \u201cChelsea. How are you? You\u2019re so good. I am so weak and sore from you. Can you take it out and let me rest?\u201dShe hoped Chelsea would take it.The expression on Chelsea\u2019s face really softened as he gently pulled himself out and put his hands on her waist, massaging her.\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d Chelsea\u2019s gentle tone was unexpected, causing Moussa\u2019s eyes to redden again.\u201cWhy are you crying again?\u201d Chelsea frowned impatiently. He was tired of seeing her shed tears.Moussa shook her head and sniffled, hooked her arm around his neck, and smiled gently. She took the initiative to kiss him on the lips and said, \u201cChelsea. Thank you.\u201d It was the first time he made her feel warm since she came to this other world.Looking at her sweet smile, Chelsea suddenly felt that something was pounding fast. He was embarrassed and hugged her and held her head in his arms. He said in a muffled voice, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Moussa smiled and nodded. Suddenly it seemed to her that Chelsea was not as cold as he appeared to be. She squirmed in his arms, trying to find a more comfortable position.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Chelsea stopped her after a couple of moves. At the same time, she felt a hard object between her legs, and it was getting bigger and bigger. Moussa, of course, knew what it was. She was so scared that she froze and didn\u2019t dare to move.Chelsea grunted and hugged her closer. He wanted to roll over and crush her underneath him and make it all happen. But thinking about her sweet smile and that thank you, he forced himself to hold back.Patting her back, he said patiently. \u201cDon\u2019t move around. Go to sleep.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Seeing that he did not mean to torment her, Moussa breathed a sigh of relief. The corner of her mouth was curved, and she slept in his arms.It was the first time that Moussa fell asleep smiling since she came to this other world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing that it was almost daylight, Chelsea couldn\u2019t help but roll over and pin Moussa below him. He reached out and explored the wetness of her vag and held himself slowly inside. Knowing that she was swollen, he didn\u2019t dare to enter the whole thing. He stopped at the deepest part and started to pull out and push in on a smaller level.\u201cMmm.\u201d Moussa woke up in a daze and saw clearly that the person pressing her was Chelsea. She felt her p*ssy being pushed up to the maximum, and then he slowly pulled out. It was accompanied by a tingling wave of electricity that stimulated her to twist her waist and clamp him involuntarily.Seeing her awake, Chelsea pounded her roguishly. Each time he pulled out, only the head was left. On the other hand, when he entered, he suddenly plunged heavily inside her cervix.\u201cAh! Gently,\u201d the intense stimulation caused Moussa to scream and raise her waist, contracting herself to clamp him hard.\u201cMmmm.\u201d Chelsea muffled a grunt caused by her clamping. He withdrew himself and pumped lightly at her entrance.When Moussa stopped being so tight, Chelsea suddenly pushed himself hard into her entrance.\u201cUh!\u201d Moussa got tormented by him in such a way that she was going crazy, desperately twisting herself, not knowing whether to tighten or loosen.Chelsea watched her so helpless and crazy. He seemed to enjoy playing and always hit her hard when she was not expecting it.After a few times of the successive hard ins and outs, Moussa kept screaming and shaking. Her mouth opened slightly, and she let out a long moan and came.Chelsea also could not hold back and come deep inside her. Pressing her down, Chelsea checked the sky. He had to get up for breakfast and get ready to go hunting.He was not finished with her. He kissed and kneaded her for a while before he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going out hunting. You sleep again. When you wake up, get up and eat your meal. I\u2019ll put it on the table for you.\u201dAchieving his desire, he grew talkative.Moussa opened her sleepy eyes and listened to his instructions. She felt warm in her heart. Turning to him, she kissed him again on the lips and whispered, \u201cBe safe.\u201dAfter thinking about it and shyly turning around, she softly added, \u201cCome back early.\u201d That seemed to be the first time she wanted him to come back early.Chelsea\u2019s heart warmed at her words. He suddenly felt that having such a partner did not seem so bad.He calmed down and tugged the animal skin next to him, and put it over her. He was afraid that if he didn\u2019t get out of bed, he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the house today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She slept well, hummed a song, got up from bed, showered, washed clothes, and cleaned up the house. Although her body was still very sore, Moussa couldn\u2019t help but feel good.She ate the slices of fruits that Chelsea had left for her in a hurry, took care of herself, and went to the back of the house with a small bucket to water the seedlings one by one.While watering, she looked up and saw Ryan approaching from a distance.Moussa smiled at him when he came closer and said, \u201cRyan, good morning.\u201dRyan gave her an exaggerated smile and said, \u201cHow could it be early? It\u2019s almost noon.\u201dMoussa blushed at that. Chelsea tired her early in the morning, causing her to get up late.But Ryan quickly changed the subject and asked, \u201cDo you want to go out to pick wild fruits and seedlings today? I\u2019m free to go with you.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Moussa readily agreed and went back to the house to get a basket and set off with him.The two had a good time talking and laughing all the way. Moussa also had a good yield, picking many wild fruits and also found seedlings that looked like corns.Somehow, the day had gotten dark before the two realized. Both of them hurriedly went to the village.Fortunately, Ryan did not dare to lead her too far away. The two people soon returned to the village and saw a vague figure walking around at the village entrance from afar.As they were walking toward the village, Moussa recognized Chelsea and rushed to him quickly. She ran to his side and pulled his arm with excitement, and said, \u201cChelsea, look, look! I dug corn, oh! If I grow it alive, we will have corn to eat in the autumn. Roasted corn and boiled corn are very delicious.\u201dSeeing her excited little flushed face and shining eyes like the stars in the sky, Chelsea\u2019s worry and anger of not seeing her after returning home suddenly disappeared into thin air.Patting her hand, he also smiled.But after his eyes fell on the slowly approaching Ryan, his smile dimmed. Looking at his still hoisted arm, he spoke with apparent disinterest, \u201cRyan, thank you for protecting my partner for me. Also, how is the wound on your arm?\u201dRyan grinned and said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost healed.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Chelsea nodded and said, \u201cThen you can take everyone out hunting starting tomorrow. I will take a few days off to show Moussa the territory.\u201dRyan\u2019s eyes darkened and then nodded in agreement.Chelsea saw him agree and dropped the sentence, \u201cThen we are leaving, you also go back to rest early.\u201d After saying that, he took Moussa\u2019s small hand and walked in their house\u2019s direction.After returning to their house, Moussa noticed that Chelsea seemed angry. After their relationship improved somewhat, she was not so afraid of him anymore. She did not want to give up on her work like that.So she gathered her courage, hugged his waist from behind, and asked softly, \u201cChelsea, are you angry?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he turned around and took her in his arms. He lowered his head and kissed her fiercely.Chelsea thoroughly cleaned each of her teeth, then the sensitive surface of her upper mouth. His tongue fiercely and aggressively swiped her back and forth.When he had had enough, he pulled out her soft tongue and sucked it vigorously, causing her tongue to ache.Moussa was hardly breathing, and her hands were hammering and pushing him. But Chelsea was not moved at all and held her tongue. He sucked it hard until he felt the little person in his arms getting softer and softer before Chelsea let her go.Pressing his forehead against hers, he ordered in an angry tone, \u201cIn the future, you can\u2019t go out alone. Neither can you go out with another male?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Moussa nodded obediently and mentally muttered, \u201cHe is not jealous, right?\u201dSeeing that she agreed, Chelsea cooled his anger and sat down on the wooden stool with her in his arms. He sliced the roasted meat into pieces and fed it to her mouth.It was the first time he fed her. Moussa was so flattered that she ate two slices in his hands and followed his example. She took a piece from the table and fed it to his mouth, saying shyly, \u201cYou eat too.\u201dChelsea looked at her. He seemed happy with the corners of his mouth hooked and ate the slice in her hand. Then he picked a portion to feed Moussa.\u201cChelsea, I\u2019m full. You can have it.\u201d Moussa turned her head to the side and refused.\u201cEat more. You\u2019re too skinny.\u201d Chelsea turned her head over and forced her to eat another piece.\u201cChelsea, I really can\u2019t eat anymore. My body is so tired.\u201d When he tried to feed her, Moussa refused to open her mouth.Chelsea frowned in displeasure, saying, \u201cThe reason is that you eat too little. You do not have the physical strength and always pass out in the middle. Be good, eat more so I won\u2019t have to struggle for it.\u201d\u201cYou. You.\u201d Moussa froze for a moment before reacting to what he said. Her face turned red. He actually brought out that kind of thing casually. She really did not know what to say.Chelsea took the opportunity to feed her two more pieces and stopped only when she was about to vomit. He then quickly filled his stomach.Then he carried her to the bed. At that moment, Moussa realized what he wanted to do and squirmed in his arms. She refused, \u201cChelsea, wait, wait a minute. I have not planted the corn seedlings yet.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll plant them tomorrow.\u201d Chelsea only wanted to put her under his body and ravish her. He didn\u2019t care about the seedlings. His mind had been on it for a whole day.\u201cNo, if you plant it tomorrow, it will die.\u201d He placed Moussa on the bed. She squirmed desperately and refused to let him take off her clothes.Chelsea got tired of her squirming, so he ripped her clothes off and threw them aside. Then he jumped on her and pinned her under his body so she couldn\u2019t move.\u201cChelsea\u2026\u201d Moussa was so anxious that her voice sounded like she was about to cry.Seeing that she was about to cry again, Chelsea compromised helplessly. \u201cLet me come once, and then I\u2019ll go help you plant. This is okay, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Moussa finally put her mind at ease and nodded docilely.However, her calmness was obviously somewhat early because she had forgotten that it was not easy to get Chelsea to come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t let go of any skin, especially the two red dots of her bosom, which were swollen and hardened by his nibbling. Then he moved downward when he was satisfied.Moussa leaned her head to the side, trembling and moaning under Chelsea\u2019s nibbles.Chelsea made his way down to the long-awaited nether regions. He pulled her legs apart and leaned down to nibble gently and aggressively on the side of her petals, tasting the delicate skin there.\u201cHuh?\u201d Chelsea seemed to have found a new toy. He reached out and flicked on the small ball hidden in the crevice.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa screamed and moaned at the sudden sensation.Chelsea leaned down happily and sucked the ball into his mouth, nibbling and playing with it.\u201cAh! Don\u2019t!\u201d Moussa couldn\u2019t bear the overwhelming sensation and tried to twist her waist to avoid it.As soon as she moved, she was held back by Chelsea. He turned her upside down and supported her body.He noticed that his hard-on was right where her mouth was. Thus, on a whim, he grabbed her hand and put it over his hard-on, ordering, \u201cHold it, open your mouth and take it in.\u201d\u201cMmm\u201d Moussa looked at the huge object in her hand, and bad memories of last night came flooding back. She hesitated to do anything.\u201cCome on.\u201d Chelsea nibbled on her small ball, urging her.Moussa closed her eyes and opened her mouth. She first captured the thick head and then slowly swallowed the thick and majestic object.\u201cMmmm,\u201d Chelsea moaned in comfort at the tight and exquisite experience. He knew she couldn\u2019t swallow the whole thing and didn\u2019t force her. He left her alone and allowed her to be there.He only intensified his sucking activity. One of his hands crept towards her arsehole, and the other finger entered her entrance simultaneously.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d His fingers entered her behind and her entrance. Moussa raised her upper back in pain, trying to avoid it, and spat out the stiff member in her mouth.Chelsea was dissatisfied and bit her small ball. Then he turned her up and said with a smirk, \u201cIf the upper mouth is not willing to accommodate it, then let\u2019s change it to the lower mouth.\u201d Then he moved again.He lifted her waist, and his thick, hard, and long rod slowly entered his huge head into her entrance from where his fingers were holding it open. He paused for a moment and then slammed it fast and hard into her sensitive flesh that had been just played with by his fingers. The violent force allowed the huge head to hit the deepest spot at once. And then, with another powerful thrust, the huge head pierced Moussa\u2019s cervix.\u201cAh ah ah!\u201d Moussa could not help but arch her body because of the intense stimulation and the pain. But she buried herself deeper into Chelsea\u2019s arms, making it more convenient for him to taste her cherry red mouth.Chelsea\u2019s rigid member repeatedly pierced in and out, and Moussa\u2019s belly cramped and writhed a few times. She lay back on the bed, trembling and breathless. She let Chelsea enter her fiercely one after another.\u201cBaby, you are so tight. It makes me so comfortable to be wrung by you. Are you satisfied with me, hmm?\u201d Chelsea growled in pleasure.\u201cSo. Comfortable. Well. Gently. Too deep. Mmm.\u201d Moussa looked enchanted and agreed with him.\u201cDo you like me or not? Speak up, and I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d Chelsea enjoyed looking at her shyness but had to say something like that.\u201cLike, like, ah! Please. Gently.\u201d There was no need to be ashamed of anything. She wanted him to be gentle, so she said what he wanted her to say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He entered deeper, hitting her sensitive inner walls and driving her more furiously upward.\u201cAh ah ah!\u201d Moussa\u2019s entire body stiffened. Her thin white legs unconsciously opened up, and she used all her strength to push him away, even if it made him pull out a little.But her strength could not beat Chelsea\u2019s, even a little bit. The more she pushed him away, the harder he was grinding against her sensitive flesh.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa let out a long moan. She was in the throes of both pain and pleasure and reached her limit.A hot torrent drenched Chelsea\u2019s. He almost lost his guard when he pulled out and started a new round of pounding.She was amid her climax. She was trembling, twitching, tightening, and being stretched wide open by his ferocious pumping.Moussa\u2019s state of mind was drifting, but her body was involuntarily gyrating to match his. She kept moaning, making Chelsea\u2019s blood boil even more.Finally, after a series of high-speed pumping, Chelsea reached the deepest part of her body and went in hard.\u201cAhh!\u201d Moussa was so turned on that she raised her waist and came again. Then she fell helplessly on the bed and panted heavily.As her sanity gradually returned, Moussa remembered her corn seedlings. She pushed Chelsea, who was still on top of her and was unwilling to get up. She whispered, \u201cPull out. You promised to help me plant the corn.\u201dChelsea sighed helplessly and rolled over to pull out his softened member. How could that little thing be so annoying that she could not forget her corn at such a time?He took the animal skin skirt beside him and got a piece of clothing from the dresser. He threw it to Moussa because he tore the one she had before and probably couldn\u2019t wear it.Moussa reluctantly sat up, put on the cloth, and saw him walking out. She called him quickly, \u201cWait. I want to take a bath.\u201d\u201cWhat bath. Hurry up, and then we can continue.\u201d Chelsea said impatiently.Moussa blushed at his words. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll get something out of me. I want to take a bath. You go get water for me so I can finish soon.\u201dSeeing her persistence, Chelsea reluctantly changed direction and went to help her get bathwater.Moussa slowly stepped off the bed with her aching body and walked hunched towards the bathroom.Seeing that he had already made the bathwater, she slowly climbed in and was shocked by the cold bathwater. It was so cold.When she looked up, she saw that Chelsea was still standing nearby watching her. She was a little embarrassed and turned her head to the side and said, \u201cYou go out first. I\u2019ll finish washing soon.\u201dChelsea did not say anything but suddenly yanked the animal skin skirt. He jumped into the tub behind her.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa was startled. The water in the tub overflowed because of his large figure\u2019s entry.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Moussa asked in confusion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, he was concerned that she would be cold if she used the cold water for bathing. However, his fingers\u2019 position made her quickly lose being moved. She squirmed and tried to avoid him, \u201cHmm. No.\u201d\u201cBe good. I\u2019ll help you wash and make sure you won\u2019t be cold.\u201d Chelsea laughed and hugged her from behind. One of his hands pinched the sensitive little ball in her flower and gently pulled and played with it. His other hand was on one side of her snowy peak, and he kneaded it vigorously into various shapes.\u201cUh! Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t.\u201d Moussa was given a dual approach to excite her. Her eyes gradually became dazed, and her waist and hips writhed not to escape but to cater. His two big hands grabbed her snowy peaks. She tried to stop him, but her small hands did not have any strength.Chelsea was satisfied that he slowly slipped his middle finger into her tight entrance and pumped it fast.Moussa was taken for a ride by the pleasure that kept piling up inside her body. Her face became more and more flushed, and her charming and seductive mouth kept on moaning.Seeing how tempting she was, Chelsea couldn\u2019t resist and withdrew his fingers from her hole. He raised one of her legs to the maximum angle.He aimed the head of his big member towards the narrow hole, then thrust out his waist to forcefully stretched her tight canal to the end.\u201cMmm. It hurts. Chelsea. Gently. It is too deep. Ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa snapped out of her euphoria and slapped his big hand in an attempt to slow him down.\u201cBaby, it is more enjoyable when it is deeper. Look at how tight you are below. It is more enjoyable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Chelsea just thought she was shy. He removed his hand from her snowy peak and pressed her against the tub\u2019s wall. All at once, he entered deeper and deeper like an iron wedge.\u201cAh! Chelsea. It hurts you. Slow. Slow. Slow. Ah ah ah!\u201d His aggressive movements spilled water out of the tub. Moussa\u2019s voice became weaker and weaker, gradually turning into unconscious moans.Chelsea seemed hungry for her and continued pounding her. Every time he stabbed her womb\u2019s door, he made her shiver, moan, and scream.\u201cAhhh!\u201d Chelsea was finally satisfied and roared as he shot a stream of hot fluid into her flower.After the passion, Moussa leaned weakly against him. She gasped and let him use his fingers to expel some of the fluid from her flower.Chelsea was in a good mood and carried her out of the tub. He kissed her sweaty face and asked, \u201cAre you still cold?\u201dMoussa glanced at him in annoyance and did not answer.Chelsea pretended to be surprised and asked, \u201cWhat? Are you still cold? Then let\u2019s do it again?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re annoying.\u201d Moussa did not know where the courage came from, but she got all worked up and pinched him on his waist.Chelsea did not get angry and even laughed out loud.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was impressed that he looked a bit like Sesshomaru, especially when he wasn\u2019t smiling. Even the color of his hair was similar. But she still liked to see him smile, and it felt so warm. It seemed good to have such a strong, powerful and handsome beast husband.Moussa decided to settle down and make the best of this cross-world marriage. After all, her original world had left her heart dead, and she didn\u2019t want to go back.So she mustered up the courage to take his hand around her waist and said softly, \u201cYou look good when you smile. Will you smile more often in the future?\u201dChelsea froze, then nodded. He kissed her on the cheek and took the clothes to help her put them on. Then he got a torch and went with her with him to the backyard to plant corns.However, how could he plant corns? He came close to trampling on the white dangos that Moussa had successfully grown.Moussa gasped, pushed him aside, and told him to just stand with the torch. She did the rest herself.Chelsea wanted to help, but his strength was too great. He almost got the seedlings planted next to him by digging a hole. Moussa glared at him twice before he reluctantly stepped aside and became a torch stake.Moussa planted the corn seedlings quickly. She rubbed her sore back and stood up. After patting the soil on her hands, Moussa thoughtlessly looked up and suddenly found many stars in the sky. The stars were so bright that she could see them.Moussa ran excitedly to Chelsea\u2019s side. She pulled his arm and pointed to the stars in the sky, and said, \u201cLook, there are so many stars in the sky. Oh, you can see them in plain sight. They are big and bright.\u201d In her world, the stars had become a luxury to see in the city\u2019s night sky.Chelsea looked up, uninterested. He really didn\u2019t know what was so beautiful about the stars; he could see them every night. He just wanted to push her back into bed and pound her to sleep.\u201cChelsea, Chelsea, you take me to a higher place to see the stars, okay?\u201d Moussa begged as she shook his arm.Although Chelsea was unwilling, he could not bear to refuse her because she was so excited.So he nodded, extinguished the torch in his hand, and carried her outside the village. Not long after, he found a big and thick tree. He transformed into his animal form and let Moussa on his back. He then jumped and found a thick tree and stopped. He had Moussa seated on the tree.He wanted to turn into a human form, but Moussa stopped him.\u201cChelsea, do not turn into a human form, okay. You are so comfy to hug now.\u201d Moussa rarely saw him in animal form. She was shocked the first time she saw him, but she was no longer afraid now. Instead, she felt that he was more dangerous in human form.\u201cHum,\u201d the beast-shaped Chelsea hummed in response and obediently lay down beside her so that she could play. Anyway, she was outside now and refused to let him do anything. And certain things could happen not only in human form but also in animal form. He was more fierce in beast form but afraid of breaking her. The elders did not allow it for the time being. However, they wanted them to produce the next strongest generation. She had to get used to it sooner or later.Moussa did not know what Chelsea was thinking at the moment. If she knew, she would not be in the mood to look at the stars anymore. That would scare her to fall directly from the tree.Moussa played with Chelsea\u2019s silvery-white fur for a while, then comfortably rested her head on him. She lay on the tree and watched the stars. There was no one talking, and she was getting sleepy, so she yawned and fell asleep.Seeing that she did not make a sound at all, Chelsea realized that she was already sleeping there. Seeing that she was sleeping soundly, Chelsea couldn\u2019t bear to wake her up. His tail pulled her into his embrace, and he held her like that until dawn. After all, they were outside the village, and there were wild animals at any time. All the more so because he was carrying a female who could not defend herself. For some reason, the more he spent time with this little thing, the softer his heart became.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At first, she was shocked, and then she recognized that it was Chelsea. She smiled gently, hugged his huge lion head, and kissed him, \u201cGood morning.\u201dChelsea was tickled by her sleepy look when she just woke up. So he quickly transformed into his human form and pinned her down on a tree and kissed her. He pried her teeth opened rather fiercely and got out her soft tongue as he bit the tip and sucked it hard.In addition, his hand explored and kept pressing on her hole.\u201cMmm.\u201d Moussa realized that they were still outside and on the tree. Therefore, she refused to let him go on, and her tiny hand patted and pushed on his back. After he let her go a little, she gasped and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cRoar.\u201d Chelsea got excited and knew that this was not a good place to do business. Soon there would be hunters passing by, so he snarled and transformed into his animal form. He carried her down from the tree and quickly fled to their home.After entering the house, he put Moussa down and quickly became human. He was about to pounce on her, but Moussa dodged him and did not mention what she had promised to do. On the contrary, she said she was hungry and asked Chelsea to roast for her to eat.Chelsea looked at her grudgingly. However, it was not a thing that a male could do to make a female hungry.So he held back his desire and started a fire for roasting. Moussa sat far away and watched him warily. She was afraid that he could not restrain himself from pouncing on her.Soon, the roasted scent wafted out of the house. After a night of labor, Moussa was a little hungry, and she saw Chelsea put the roasted food on the table. She slowly went to the table.She observed that even if Chelsea wanted to torment her, he would wait until she had eaten enough before starting.So before she had enough to eat, she should be safe. After eating, she would ask Chelsea to take her around to get used to the surroundings. After all, he promised to do so yesterday. According to her understanding of Chelsea these days, he would not go back on it as long as he promised something. He was a lot better than those men in her world who were full of lies.Unfortunately, Moussa\u2019s plans were unsuccessful. No sooner had she approached the table when Chelsea picked her up. He stripped her of her clothes and pulled her legs apart to sit on top of him. He kissed her when she squealed in surprise and took the opportunity to put his hand on her p*ssy and rubbed it.After rubbing it for a while, he was not satisfied and inserted his middle finger into it. He hooked his finger, getting her wetter and wetter. Then he pinched her most sensitive ball back and forth.When he felt she was wet enough, he slowly pushed his hard-on into her entrance.\u201cMmm,\u201d Moussa felt her tight p*ssy slowly being pushed open to the extreme. The intense friction caused her to moan.Chelsea had his entire baton inside, but he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to start. Even if he wanted to, he could not let the female be hungry to satisfy his desires.So, while one hand held her waist, the other hand took the slices from the table and fed them to Moussa.Right now, Moussa\u2019s p*ssy was stuffed to the brim with his huge one. She felt that her womanhood was almost bursting from him, so how could she eat anything?She shook her head and refused. \u201cHmm. Chelsea. I won\u2019t eat. I can\u2019t eat. You can pull out and get some. It\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? Why aren\u2019t you eating anymore?\u201d Chelsea asked as he pushed down heavily her slightly raised body.\u201cUh!\u201d Chelsea\u2019s push caused Moussa\u2019s slightly lifted buttocks to sit back down. It went deeper, causing Moussa to moan.It was a little bit of a relief. Chelsea gave her a look, and it was a clear-cut question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chelsea did not have the patience and bit her mouth. Then he kissed her and forced her to open her mouth and eat.Moussa choked when Chelsea forced-fed a piece to her. She hurriedly opened her mouth to stop him from feeding her, \u201cChelsea, I\u2019m full. I won\u2019t eat anymore.\u201dAlthough Chelsea was not satisfied that she ate too little, her tight walls clamped him, and it was unbearable. He could not care less whether she ate more or less. Since she said she was full, then he had to start.So he stood up, holding her waist. Moussa was unprepared for it, and she leaned back. Her little hands grabbed the edge of the wooden table and laid down on her back. He pulled her up, and so she was half in the air there.Moussa was frightened that she subconsciously wrapped her legs around his waist. Her p*ssy involuntarily tightened her grip on him, causing Chelsea to hum in comfort. He grabbed her two small, snow-white bum and ruthlessly thrust her down from the top.Chelsea originally went into the deep, but now it was easy to get deeper into that stance. Each time, he topped inside her cervix. The inner walls of her womb protruded upward.\u201cGently. Stop. Chelsea. Gently. Ah ah ah ah! I\u2019m going to be torn apart by you! Ah! Gently. Too deep! Mmm\u2026 \u201d Moussa begged him as she clenched herself in pain and fear.\u201cMmm\u2026 \u201d Chelsea was a little pained by her clamping. He grunted, slowed down his movements, vigorously rubbed the white bum, and coaxed her in a low voice. \u201cBaby, relax, relax. You\u2019re squeezing too tight. I can\u2019t move.\u201dAs soon as Moussa heard it, she tightened it even more and thought, \u201cI think it\u2019s better if you can\u2019t move.\u201dChelsea felt that she did not only relax but also tighten even more. He knew she was doing it on purpose.He gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cThis is what you asked for.\u201d He pulled himself out and went in hard, stretching her tight walls regardless of whether it would hurt her.Moussa reaped what she sowed. He held her down and viciously impaled her for a while. The tremendous stimulation caused her eyeballs to roll back, and a wave of spasms swept through her body from the center of her core, accompanied by a hot stream of squirting crescendo.\u201cMmm\u2026 Mmm \u2026\u201d Moussa lost her strength after the climax and fell limp on the wooden table as she moaned. She let him grab her waist to get the most out of her. He kept working on her vigorously, one after the other.Chelsea took a while and seemed dissatisfied that she was so slumped and weak. So he pulled himself out and let her turn around and lie on the wooden table.Then he held her waist and ordered, \u201cHold your bum up and let me in.\u201dMoussa was tired and just wanted to sleep. How could she even make do that? She hummed and rubbed herself on the wooden table and then stopped moving.\u201cGet on it.\u201d Seeing that she refused to cooperate, Chelsea slapped her small bum twice.\u201cHmm.\u201d Moussa felt the pain and raised her bum.\u201cLittle thing, you won\u2019t listen without a spanking.\u201d Pleased, Chelsea parted her cheeks and pushed in hard, thrusting heavily.Moussa was a little sore from the friction of her p*ssy, which brought her back to her senses for a moment. Listening to the constant \u2018plop\u2019 of body slaps and the wet sounds coming from below, Moussa felt ashamed. This was especially true since she was still seductively sticking her arse out and letting him do it.Moussa unconsciously tightened herself, causing Chelsea to growl. He teased, \u201cLittle thing, it is very comfortable, right? It is very comfortable when I do this, right? You are clenching so tightly and also dripping so much water out. I will make you more comfortable. Let me have you here, and you will definitely feel good.\u201dWhile saying so, he put a finger into Moussa\u2019s bunghole and expanded it.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa moaned in pain but did not speak up to stop him. Anyway, he was on a roll. No matter what, even if she begged him, Chelsea wouldn\u2019t stop. As long as he won\u2019t really enter, she\u2019d just let him play.Seeing that she didn\u2019t cry and scream in refusal like usual, Chelsea was in a good mood and picked her up from the wooden table. He turned her head around and kissed her tenderly.Moussa took the opportunity to plead, \u201cChelsea, let\u2019s go back to bed, okay.

He reached out with his hand to keep them joined together and carried Moussa to the bed.Fearing that the animal skin would hurt her delicate skin, he did not put her down. He sat directly on the bed and let her sit on him with her back to him. His two hands went around and grabbed Moussa\u2019s plump chest, kneading them vigorously.\u201cThese two balls are big and soft. They are so comfortable, and our tribe\u2019s females don\u2019t have them.\u201dSuddenly, his lower body slammed upwards. \u201cThis small hole is so tight. It makes me feel good, and so much water can flow out from it. I think I\u2019ve found a treasure.\u201d\u201cMmmm\u2026 \u201d Moussa was all soft in his arms. Hearing his unashamed words of raunchiness, she was both ashamed and happy. The man regarded her as a treasure.A wave of tingling rose from her p*ssy, stimulating her so much that she unconsciously writhed and stretched her waist. In the process, she wrapped the huge object inside her walls even tighter.Chelsea seemed to notice her impatience. He lowered his head and nibbled on her earlobe. He teased, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, little thing? You want it, huh?\u201dMoussa was so ashamed that she turned her head to one side, pursing her lips and refusing to say anything.Chelsea, however, was not anxious to start. He had to tease her to say it herself. He continued to knead her peak with one hand and explored downward with the other, pinching her little ball and grinding it continuously.\u201cAh! Mmm\u2026 \u201d Moussa was thrilled by what he was doing. She was constantly oozing water from her little hole, and it was like countless ants were crawling around the center of her p*ssy. It was obviously very swollen, but it was itchy and unbearable. It was just that he was only inside, and he wouldn\u2019t move.But begging him to move, Moussa could not say it. She could only clench her teeth, propped her hands on his legs, and moved her waist up and down in small increments.\u201cLittle thing.\u201d Without moving for a few moments, Chelsea could not resist the urge. With a low growl, he pulled her down and then pushed himself up at the same time. Amid her cry of surprise, he fiercely pushed his way up.\u201cMmmm ah! Gently, ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa was subjected to repeated upward strokes by his baton and then was vigorously pulled back by him again. The double stimulation left her dazed and confused.\u201cBaby, are you comfortable? Did I make you comfortable, or did you make yourself comfortable, eh?\u201d Chelsea nibbled at the skin on her neck as he moved in and out relentlessly.\u201cComfortable. Um. Gently. You will break me. Ah!\u201d Time and again, her cervix was pushed open, but he wanted to enter deeper as if he wasn\u2019t satisfied. It was so intense that Moussa became afraid that she might be torn in half by him.\u201cHow good do you feel about me? Or do you feel good about yourself? Tell me, and I\u2019ll go easy on you.\u201d Chelsea loved getting dirty words out of her small mouth, so he forced her to say more.\u201cI\u2019m enjoying it! Ah!\u201d Though he had a history of not keeping his word, at the moment, Moussa could no longer think straight. She could only submit to him and said whatever he wanted to hear.\u201cWhere are you comfortable? Say it.\u201d\u201cMy p*ssy! I\u2019m feeling good. Ah ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa shouted shamelessly, trembling and climaxing.\u201cMmm\u2026\u00a0 So much water. So tight.\u201d She strung up Chelsea, something that he could not stand. He quickly made a dozen deep poundings. Then finally, he made a hard push, squeezing his huge head into the narrow womb\u2019s door. As a result, his hot fluid shot forth.Moussa was so stimulated that her eyes went blank, and her body trembled and fainted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew that Chelsea was working on her again. Though his movements were not gentle, he controlled the force and did not go to the deepest. Even so, her p*ssy was already red and swollen from overuse, and she was frowning from the pain.Clutching the animal skin under her, she turned her head to the side, pursed her lips, and let him have his way with her.He would not let her go until he was satisfied. She had already witnessed this herself countless times.She looked around, hoping to divert her attention. She could not resist tightening her walls when she was in pain, and it hurt even more when he hit her hard.However, the sky appeared to have darkened. Staying in bed for a whole day, Moussa had a hard time. He said he wanted to take her out to familiarize herself with the environment, so she was quite moved\u2014a liar. Moussa could not help but feel wronged.All of a sudden, a warm body crushed down. Moussa\u2019s sealed lips were pried open without mercy, dragging out her tongue and sucking it carefully. However, the hard baton was no longer controlled, and it started to infiltrate as much as it could without fail.Moussa was held down and pounded again and again. It was too painful for her to bear. Then her eyes turned red, and she sobbed.\u201cWhy? As soon as you wake up, you have to cry. Earlier, you were shouting that you were enjoying yourself. How did it change as soon as you woke up? Did the water from the lower part of your body become less and flow from the top?\u201d Chelsea asked, frowning as he was a little annoyed by her crying.\u201cYou\u2019re mean.\u201d Moussa sobbed and complained. She did not care if it annoyed him because she felt wronged. She said, \u201cYou promised to take me around to familiarize myself with the environment, but you did not keep your word. You kept me in bed and bullied me for a whole day. I am in pain, and you do not care. The only thing you care about is your satisfaction.\u201dChelsea was stunned by her words that he stopped moving. Concerned, he asked, \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201d Moussa turned her head to ignore him. She also had a temper, okay? She also relied on that he would not do anything to her. Anyway, after these days of getting along, Moussa was no longer afraid of him. She knew that he would not beat her and throw her outside to feed the wild animals. In this other world where there are fewer females, she was quite a treasure after all.Chelsea saw her ignore him. He grumbled at himself and slowly withdrew his still swollen member from her p*ssy.Moussa muffled another cry. She thought he was going to start again, so she turned and glared at him fiercely.\u201cLet me see if I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d Chelsea explained hurriedly.Then he lowered his head, lifted her hips, reached down, and wiped the white stuff from her p*ssy. He scrutinized her, then said in a soft and reassuring voice, \u201cIt is okay. There is no tear, but it is a bit swollen. I\u2019ll help you take a bath and then put some medicine so it won\u2019t hurt again there. Wait a minute.\u201d Then he went off to bed.Moussa was a bit flabbergasted. He was not satisfied yet, so how could he be willing to let her go? It was not quite like his style ah.When she first became his partner, she couldn\u2019t get used to his size and roughness. She cried and cried a lot more on the bed than this, but he ignored her. The more she cried, the harder he was on her.He couldn\u2019t let go of her when she did not satiate his desire yet. The way he was doing it now, did it mean he had started caring instead of just wanting to vent his passion on her? Moussa suddenly became happy, and all her grievances disappeared.Soon Chelsea got the bathwater ready and returned to the bed to carry her to the bathroom. He gently put her into the bathtub.\u201cHmm.\u201d The water in the tub was hot. Moussa was already cold and was surprised to find that the water in the tub was hot.She was grateful and looked at Chelsea, who jumped into the tub and pressed against her back. He kissed her and then put his hands on her waist and massaged her.\u201cMmm. Gently.\u201d Moussa comfortably leaned on Chelsea. She closed her eyes and enjoyed it.The long-awaited hot bath was so comfortable. Although her body was sore, his hands kept massaging her waist, which helped ease the pain.She didn\u2019t know how he managed to boil a big bucket of hot water in such a short time.\u201cChelsea, how did you get so much hot water?\u201dChelsea curled the corner of his mouth and nibbled on her cheek. He teased, \u201cLittle thing, you\u2019re not angry anymore?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She seemed somewhat emboldened and proud. Thinking of a few days ago, Moussa was afraid of him and dared not vent her frustration. It was surprising that she dared to lose her temper with him today.But who asked him to be so fierce to her before? His face was stern all day, and he didn\u2019t even smile. He was also so rude to her. He made her suffer every time, so she should be afraid of him. And now, she found out that he wasn\u2019t so cold, except for being rude in bed. He wouldn\u2019t really do anything to her, so she wasn\u2019t afraid of him anymore.So she slapped his hand and urged, \u201cCome on, how did you do it?\u201dChelsea laughed again and said, \u201cLittle thing, now you\u2019re not afraid of me? How dare you hit me.\u201d\u201cChelsea.\u201d Moussa was ashamed and annoyed by his words that she whimpered in disobedience.Chelsea was snorting and watching her blushing and awkward look. He stopped teasing her, pointed to a large hollow stone standing next to him, and said, \u201cThis stone conducts heat very well. If you light a fire underneath, the water inside will soon be hot, but the outer part of the stone is not very warm, neither shall it burn you. I ran a long way to get it while you were sleeping. I wanted to get some reward and waited for you to wake up. Then I had to take it myself, but I didn\u2019t expect to be wronged by you. I didn\u2019t mean to be untrustworthy and deny taking you out. You were sleeping on your own in the morning, and you\u2019ve been sleeping until now.\u201dMoussa was a little embarrassed by his story. It seemed that she was really wrong to blame him. He carried such a large stone from a faraway place. Although he was mighty, it was not so easy. Also, he hollowed out the area. He must have put in a lot of effort.When she thought about it, Chelsea moved her to tears. She sniffled, took his hand, and said softly, \u201cChelsea, thank you.\u201d\u201cFool, what to thank. Every male has to take care of his female. Just like you must satisfy my needs and give birth to my children.\u201d Chelsea kissed the woman. At the same time, he said that with his rising anaconda below her.Moussa sighed helplessly. She was really at a loss for words. Whenever Chelsea moved her slightly, he always had a way to make her feelings disappear without a trace.\u201cHuh.\u201d She felt a different texture to his hand that made her lower her head and look at it carefully. She saw that there were several blisters on it and her eyes moistened at the corners.He must have gotten it from working on the stone for her. Although his skin was thick, he also got blisters. That meant that the stone was difficult to work on. Of course, it was a stone, and his hands weren\u2019t made of metal.\u201cIt\u2019s all blistered. Does it hurt?\u201d Moussa caressed his big hand and asked with some heartache.Chelsea\u2019s heart warmed. He pulled his hand out of hers, turned her over, and hugged her tightly. He comforted her, \u201cNot at all. Everything will be fine in a few days, but I have a place that hurts badly and needs your help.\u201dHe then put his swollen and uncomfortable hard-on between her legs and rubbed it heavily against the opening of her honey pot a few times.\u201cPervert.\u201d Moussa shamefully hammered him on the mouth.TL Note: Moussa used the word s\u00e8 l\u00e1ng, it has three meanings: lecher, pervert, wolf\u201cI\u2019m not a wolf. I\u2019m a white lion. Are you going to help me or not? I\u2019m dying of pain.\u201d Chelsea countered by rubbing against her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I got it.\u201d Moussa thought he was like a kid asking for candy at the moment, so cute.But he kept rubbing the jumbo in her vajayjay, and it wasn\u2019t so cute anymore. There was no way out. Moussa saw him so uncomfortable and went soft. She sighed and held the jumbo in her hand and sent it to her love tunnel without forgetting to tell him, \u201cYou have to be gentle. I\u2019m still sore.\u201d\u201cMmmm.\u201d Chelsea was not sure if it was because of pleasure or an answering sound. After the big head entered, he pushed his waist into the deepest part of her.\u201cMmm,\u201d Moussa stifled a cry of discomfort. She felt that he did not stop moving but continued to push in. Moussa felt that he did not stop moving and continued to squeeze inside. Seeing that he was going to break open her cervix again, she patted him on the back and yelled, \u201cStop! Do not go in again! It hurts!\u201dChelsea stopped moving, looked down, and bit her on the lips. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, you little thing.\u201dAfter saying that, he moved up quickly but remembered to control the force. He stopped when he reached the deepest part of her.\u201cUh! So tired. Chelsea is too thick. It\u2019s too hard. It\u2019s so much. You\u2019ve gotten bigger. Hmm. Why aren\u2019t you coming yet? Ah!\u201dShe did not know how long it took because the water in the tub had long since cooled. Moussa wrapped her legs around his waist and climbed on top of him. She did not know how many times she had climaxed because of the overflowing juices and his fluid. This time, he seemed to be incredibly long, and Moussa was so sore. Moussa was overwhelmed that she started to complain.\u201cLittle thing, you can be really annoying. You do not let me go too deep, yet I am too thick and want to get me out faster. If you don\u2019t cooperate, I can\u2019t come.\u201d Chelsea panted and bit her, leaving clear teeth marks on her cheeks and nose. He didn\u2019t mean to torment her, but he couldn\u2019t get the whole thing in, and he had to control the force so as not to hurt her. She was so soft and clinging to him. She sucked him in and out, making his desire grow stronger and burning, but he couldn\u2019t come.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to do that.\u201d Moussa was tired. She just wanted him to come faster. Anyway, she had done what she was supposed to do and what she was not supposed to do.Chelsea was happy to hear that. He leveled her, pulled her tiny hand and pressed her already red and swollen p*ssy, and said, \u201cOpen it yourself, let me go in.\u201dShe was shocked to touch her petals. Moussa wanted to withdraw her hand, but he pulled her firmly. She turned her head away and refused to cooperate.Chelsea was shameless, and her shy look made him impatient. He pushed her against the wall of the tub, and his hand, which was on his waist, went down and kept pressing on her arsehole, threatening, \u201cOr you can use this.\u201dMoussa was shocked and glared at him. Her hands moved unwillingly, and she gently opened her p*ssy, fearing that he might get mad and really rush to her bum regardless.Chelsea watched the flower opened. Those pink shamefully squirmed and sucked themselves.He swallowed his saliva as his mouth dried up. He grabbed Moussa\u2019s waist and pushed his meat rod to her hole. Then he ruthlessly went into the end, squeezing it into her love tunnel. He refused to stop and slammed it into the walls of her love tunnel.\u201cUh!\u201d Moussa leaned back in pain, but it made her p*ssy tighter, allowing him to enter deeper. \u201cOuch, it hurts. Go out a little, go out a little.\u201d\u201cBaby, relax, relax. Don\u2019t bite so tight. You\u2019re going to cut me off.\u201d Chelsea felt her p*ssy unconsciously tightened. He took a deep breath and patted her little buttocks for comfort.When she heard that, Moussa retaliated by tightening her love tunnel, trying to squeeze the huge thing out, but she obviously forgot her earlier lesson.\u201cDamn it. Little thing, I want to be gentle with you, but I can\u2019t.\u201d Chelsea gritted his teeth and growled. She provoked the wild beast. His eyes turned scarlet, and he mercilessly pushed in and out. He went straight to the end and kept repeating. Sounds of bodies slamming together with his beastly growl, \u201cLittle thing, you\u2019re so f*cked! F*ck you! You are going to die!\u201d\u201cAh ah ah! Rogue! So painful\u2026 Too deep\u2026 So full\u2026 So painful\u2026 Ah! Gently. Ahh! Ahh!\u201d Moussa tasted the bitterness of opposing him. She felt the impact numbed her entire lower body, and her p*ssy was even more swollen. She would not have provoked him if she had known this, but now it was too late.Chelsea seemed to be no longer listening to her cries and pleas for mercy. He slammed through her again and again, driving his fierce meat into the deepest part of her body without mercy and refusing to stop!It was only a matter of time that Moussa could no longer speak. She could only tilt her head back and open her mouth and cry out silently as if she was going to die in the next second. When Chelsea growled, he shoved his huge end inside her and sprayed it out.It took a while for Moussa to feel alive again. She bit him on the shoulder in frustration and said, \u201cYou want to kill me, bad guy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He kissed her until she was out of breath before he let her go and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who provoked me first. I was trying to be gentle with you.\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Moussa also felt that she was wrong. She did provoke him first, so she changed the subject and said, \u201cIt hurts. You take it out. I want to take a bath.\u201dChelsea pulled out his softened member obediently. The water was already cold, and he was afraid she would get cold. Therefore, Chelsea quickly stuck his fingers into her hole to help her get out the fluid inside. Then he carried her out and wrapped her in animal skin, and put her back on the bed.He also got ointment and gently smeared a layer at her entrance. Looking at the red and swollen p*ssy, he felt somewhat distressed. It looked like he couldn\u2019t touch her tonight.Moussa was tired and didn\u2019t want to move a finger. She lay on the bed, all dizzy and tired, and let him put the ointment on her. Anyway, he had seen everywhere, and she didn\u2019t have to be shy about it.Chelsea helped her with the medicine, roasted, and got the wild fruit to feed her. Moussa only ate a piece throughout the day. She was indeed a little hungry and wasn\u2019t polite to him. Moussa let him feed her until she was full. To be honest, she was a little tired of eating roasted and wild fruit every day, but there was nothing else to eat there. She suddenly remembered that she had not watered the seedlings in her backyard today, so she struggled to get up to water them.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you getting up? It still hurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Chelsea saw that she would get up and hurriedly pushed her down again to keep her from moving.\u201cI have to go water the seedlings I planted. I haven\u2019t watered them yet today.\u201d Moussa patted away his hand on her shoulder and struggled to get up.\u201cOkay, okay, you lie still. I\u2019ll go water your seedlings, okay?\u201d Chelsea couldn\u2019t resist her and gave in.\u201cCan you do it?\u201d Moussa looked at him not quite trustingly. He was powerful, but watering was a thorough job. She was afraid he would trample her seedlings to death.\u201cHow can I not do it? Is it just a matter of watering? What\u2019s so hard about it?\u201d Chelsea was dissatisfied that she looked down on him and assured her.\u201cDo you know how much to pour? You don\u2019t want to pour the whole bucket, do you?\u201d Moussa doubted how he was going to pour the water.\u201cI-\u201d She really asked Chelsea. He originally wanted to pour the whole bucket down. It would be fast for him and save time. However, when she asked, he never had the nerve to say anything in case she would make fun of him.Looking at his thoughtful frowning look, Moussa chuckled. Then she smiled and clicked her tongue. \u201cFortunately, fortunately, I did not listen to you. If not, my hard-won seedlings would have been washed away by you. Well, get my clothes. I have to go and water them myself.\u201dChelsea had no choice but to get her clothes, carry a water bucket with a torch, and follow her to the backyard.Moussa let Chelsea held the torch and stood by while he watched. She first surrounded the seedlings with a circle of soil, then scooped up a bowl of water with a wooden bowl and poured it over. Then she moved on to the next seedling, and so on.Chelsea watched from the side and felt very uncomfortable. So it looked like his little thing was quite capable. He got defeated, and his sense of superiority as a male seemed to have been hit.Moussa finished watering and walked back to him when she saw that his face was not very good. He seemed to be pissed off.So she asked softly, \u201cChelsea, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dChelsea coughed awkwardly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just some lousy grass. You can\u2019t come and water them every day. They grow in the wild when no one waters them, and they grow quite well.\u201dMoussa was stunned and thought about it. Yeah, she hadn\u2019t planted before, so she came to water them every day. There was no need to water more than necessary to kill them, but fortunately, Chelsea reminded her.She was happy and hugged Chelsea\u2019s arm and praised, \u201cHusband, you are amazing. Thanks for reminding me; otherwise, I would have gotten them to die.\u201d No one knew who said that men were like children and needed to be praised by women from time to time. Chelsea was a male beast, but it should also apply.\u201cWhat\u2019s a husband?\u201d After hearing her compliment him, Chelsea was pleased with himself, and the gloom he had just felt disappeared. But what exactly was that \u201dhusband\u201d? Chelsea wondered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s the name of the male partner of our tribe, which the female calls to her male partner.\u201d Moussa forgot for a moment that this world did not have that appellation. She rushed to think of an explanation that he could understand.Chelsea nodded and asked curiously, \u201cWhat should the male call his female partner?\u201d\u201cWife.\u201d Moussa responded.\u201cWife, wife.\u201d Chelsea repeated the words twice and felt good. Then he smiled and said, \u201cI will call you wife from now on. You can no longer call me Chelsea. Just call me husband. Wife and husband are quite interesting. Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d\u201cHusband.\u201d Moussa leaned into his arms obediently and called softly. She suddenly felt that it was not bad to have such a husband. In this different world, one could change one\u2019s life through one\u2019s own hands. At least, the heart was peaceful and quiet without the conflicts of the big city.\u201cWife.\u201d Chelsea, as if compelled, lowered his head and kissed her tenderly. It was not easy to make a rough male beast like him be sweet and affectionate.In the days that followed, the relationship between the two heated up dramatically, and one could say they were inseparable. At night, Chelsea was still very aggressive but also tried to control his strength as much as possible not to hurt Moussa. And Moussa also adapted to his thickness, learned to please him, and gradually began to enjoy the pleasure brought by his thickness alongside the pain.During the day, Chelsea walked her around the village where she could go, telling her where it was safe to go and where it was dangerous for her not to go. He led her around to dig up those strange grasses she described. Knowing that she was tired of roasting, he even went down to the river to catch fish for her to eat.When he returned to the village in the evening, he also took her to visit other beasts\u2019 homes to get to know other female beasts. There was no one to accompany her when he was not in the village.But those female beasts did not seem to like her very much. When they saw her, they were only modest and not very enthusiastic.The friendliest to her was the female beast called Ivy. She had white skin, a pair of bright, clear, light blue, gentle, smiling eyes, and chestnut hair that was soft and shiny.The entire person looked very gentle and soft. Moussa also had a good impression of her, but after hearing him call his partner \u2018Sander,\u2019 Moussa began to be uncomfortable.In her mind, she kept recalling the night she overheard her outside their window, moaning loudly.\u201cSander, ah! Harder! Screw me!\u00a0 Ah! So comfortable! Ah! So hard, you are so strong! I love you so much, ah!\u201dIt was too embarrassing, and Moussa was too bashful to look up at her.Chelsea seemed to understand Moussa\u2019s discomfort, especially after seeing her face blushing. He also guessed that she remembered what happened. So after saying goodbye to Sander and Ivy, he took her little hand and led her home.Chelsea teased her as they walked, \u201cWell, did you remember that night when we eavesdropped outside their window?\u201dMoussa raised her head and looked around cautiously to make sure no one else was around before whispering, \u201cKeep your voice down. It would be bad if they heard you.\u201dChelsea smiled and said comfortingly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, they already know.\u201d\u201cWhat, they knew?\u201d Moussa exclaimed.\u201cYeah, at least Sander knew. The beast\u2019s nose is very sharp. He must have smelled us that night outside his window. But don\u2019t worry, they don\u2019t mind people peeking in. There are always soon-to-be adult beasts watching to learn. It s normal.\u201d Chelsea did not care much.\u201cWhat? How can someone peek? That. That. Did someone peek from outside our window?\u201d Moussa was shocked and turned white. She stopped and asked anxiously.Chelsea originally wanted to say that there were, but looking at her scared pale face, he shook his head and said, \u201cNo, no. If there were, I would have told you.\u201d The truth was that on the first night she became his partner, almost all the soon-to-be adult beasts came to peep. But because she shouted so miserably, those little beasts laughed at him for not being skilled. He fixed them severely, threatening them that whoever came to peep again would be beaten up. So no one came to peep again. However, it appeared that someone came to eavesdrop again recently.Moussa looked at him doubtfully and comforted herself, thinking: if he said there was none, then there was none. Boo-hoo, otherwise, she would have no face to live.Since then, Moussa had developed a good habit. Regardless of how hot the day was, as long as Chelsea wanted to touch her, the first thing to do was close the windows. She was afraid that there were really soon-to-be adult beasts peeking through.When they returned home, Moussa was still uncomfortable inside and refused to let Chelsea touch her. Chelsea was so impatient that he stripped off her clothes and pressed her to the bed until she passed out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And only then he helped her take a good bath and then carried her back to bed for her medicine to continue sleeping. Then he prepared breakfast and ate it to go hunting. He had accompanied her for several days already. It was time for him, the chief of the tribe, to lead the tribe to go hunting.Moussa woke up, and it was almost noon. She rubbed her sore back and got out of bed, scolding Chelsea in a low voice for being a \u2018stinking lion,\u2019 but her heart was still happy.After all, he began to be considerate of her and pampered her. He would boil the bathwater for her in the morning, help her take a bath, administer her medicine, and prepare breakfast for her. Even in her world, few husbands could do that for their wives, right?Moussa changed her clothes and ate breakfast. No, it should be lunch now. She went to the backyard to look at the seedlings she planted. She didn\u2019t know if the soil quality was good there. Anyway, they all grew very strong, tall, and thick. A lot thicker than the ones in her world.Huh, there seemed to be a few more plants than yesterday. Every morning for the past few days, she noticed that there appeared to be more seedlings. At first, she thought she had misremembered them, but then she paid attention to them and found that there were indeed more than the first day.In other words, there should be someone secretly helping her in planting. Without thinking, she knew it must be Ryan. By the way, she hadn\u2019t seen Ryan in the past few days because he had gone hunting with the tribe instead of Chelsea. She was really grateful to him. He went out hunting and still didn\u2019t forget to dig these seedlings back for her. She wanted to thank him properly when she had the chance.After looking around, the village was so quiet that there weren\u2019t many people left. Moussa went back to the house to get a basket and decided to go out independently. She was almost familiar with the environment, so she shouldn\u2019t be lost.Moussa walked around for half a day but did not pick much wild fruit. It was easy when she followed Ryan and Chelsea, but how could it be difficult for her.Suddenly somewhat frustrated, she sat on the rocks under the tree. She rested; she was so tired. There was no one to talk to. How boring.Oh! Moussa\u2019s eyes lit up. She suddenly saw something like an egg in the grass.Moussa rushed over and hugged it with great effort. Haha, it was really an egg and a very big egg. It was great, she could add something to her meal tonight, and she had an egg to eat. In Moussa\u2019s impression, eggs were delicious. It should be the same in this other world, too.Holding the egg happily, she walked back to the house. When she passed by Ryan\u2019s house, she suddenly stopped. Right, she could invite Ryan to her home for dinner and thank him at the same time.With her mind made up, she knocked on Ryan\u2019s door. While knocking, she shouted, \u201cRyan, Ryan.\u201dThe door soon opened. Ryan also seemed to have just returned based on his wet look. The male beasts who went out hunting had a good habit of going to the river to take a bath before returning to the village. It was to wash off the smell of blood, and another reason was to hide the smell and prevent the trapped beasts from seeking revenge.Seeing Moussa standing outside the door, Ryan appeared to be very surprised. He smiled and said, \u201cWhy are you here? Come in and sit down.\u201d\u201cI came to invite you to my house for dinner.\u201d Moussa said as she walked inside and looked at Ryan\u2019s home, a wooden bed, a wooden table, a few wooden stools, a large wooden cabinet, and a few snow-white animal skins hanging on the wall. The layout was similar to theirs, although very simple, but clean.\u201cChelsea sent you?\u201d Hearing that she had come to invite him to dinner, Ryan asked, somewhat doubtful.\u201cNo, I wanted to come. I went out today and found a very large egg, so I thought I\u2019d invite you to eat with me.\u201d Moussa replied, putting down her basket like a treasure and taking the egg out from it.Ryan hooked the corners of his mouth at her words. Chelsea would not be so generous as to invite him to dinner. He hadn\u2019t given him a good look in the past two days, so he was probably jealous.But he was happy that Moussa thought of him. Hearing that she had picked up an egg, he was also excited to come over and look at it.\u201cWatch out.\u201d Ryan shouted. He grabbed the egg in her hand and threw it out. Then he took her to the door and dashed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t know why he threw the egg out of her hand and shouted to be watchful.But she soon knew and saw a bizarre scene from the door which Ryan did not close in a hurry. The eggshell cracked, and a snake-like object crawled out from the cracked gap; its green body crawled out, spitting its long tongue, and then opened its mouth and spat out a thick puddle of sticky liquid.Then the things that got into the liquid began to fume. The green snake spat a corrosive liquid. Moussa was terrified and hid in Ryan\u2019s arms. She shivered, and if Ryan hadn\u2019t let her throw the egg in time, she was afraid the corrosion would have disfigured her.Ryan carried her and jumped back several times to make sure she was safe. Taking advantage of the fact that the green snake was still around, corroding his house, he darted to the fire point, took the torch, and lit the fire around the house. In an instant, the entire wooden house was burning, and the green snake twisted its body wildly and was buried in the fire. Fortunately, every two houses in the village were separated by a good distance, so the fire did not endanger the other houses.It was only Ryan\u2019s house that was destroyed. Moussa\u2019s eyes were red with remorse, and she said tearfully, \u201cRyan, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t know the egg was so dangerous.\u201dRyan smiled at her, took her into his arms, and gently coaxed her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid. I will build the house again. You don\u2019t have to blame yourself. I don\u2019t blame you. Don\u2019t cry. Just be careful from now on. Don\u2019t ever touch anything you haven\u2019t seen before, okay?\u201dMoussa sobbed while nodding, \u201cRyan, I\u2019m so stupid. I wanted to thank you for helping me plant those seedlings, but I didn\u2019t expect to mess up and cause you to lose your house.\u201d\u201cYou saw it-\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Before Ryan could deliver his words, he was interrupted by a loud yell from behind him.Moussa and Ryan were startled and turned around to see that Chelsea was standing behind them in a murderous mood. Ryan hurriedly let go of Moussa and took a step back with some embarrassment.As soon as Moussa saw Chelsea, her tears dropped more than ever. She threw herself into his arms, sobbing and stammering, \u201cChelsea, husband, I was scared to death. A big snake came out of the egg and spat at me. There was smoke everywhere, and I almost died because of that. Woo, thanks to Ryan for saving me, but his house was ruined, and it was my fault.\u201dShe called her husband, Chelsea\u2019s heart was a little more comforted. He brought her into his arms and patted her back to comfort her.But he still didn\u2019t understand her words and looked at Ryan with suspicion.Ryan smiled at him and explained, \u201cShe accidentally picked up the green anaconda\u2019s egg, and it just happened to be hatching. Fortunately, she wasn\u2019t hurt, but she was just a little frightened.\u201d Ryan explained calmly.Chelsea nodded at him and said solemnly, \u201cThanks again, brother.\u201d Then he looked behind him at the house, which was already burning to ashes. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s stay at my house tonight, and I\u2019ll get some males to help you build a new house in the morning.\u201dRyan nodded. The truth was that he didn\u2019t want to hear him say thanks to him at all. Saving her and protecting her was something he did voluntarily, not for him.Even if this was the truth, he still didn\u2019t want to believe it. He smiled bitterly and simply explained the situation to the people gathered, then followed Chelsea and Moussa to their home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She kept crying quietly in Chelsea\u2019s arms and ate very little dinner.She was still sniffling until bedtime. Chelsea coaxed her for a long time, but she still cried endlessly. He was a little annoyed by her crying, so he kissed her directly and dragged out her slippery little tongue, and nibbled on it fiercely.Moussa got breathless by his aggressive action, yet she was afraid of Ryan sleeping nearby them. She didn\u2019t dare to take any heavy movements and only pushed his mouth with her small hands.When Chelsea had enough of kissing, he finally let her go. Moussa raised her head and breathed heavily, and forgot to cry.Chelsea saw that it was a good trick, so he grabbed one of her legs and hung it on the side of his waist, and his hand went down and massaged the girl\u2019s slit between her legs.Moussa was startled and almost cried out in surprise. She bit her lower lip and pushed him with her small hands, and kept twisting her waist to avoid him.However, where could she hide from Chelsea? He grabbed her two restless hands and raised them above her head, holding them down. One leg was pressed against Moussa\u2019s leg so that she could not move.His big hand became more reckless rubbing. His middle finger went inside and started pumping. While doing so, Chelsea kissed further down to her erect red button and kept nibbling on it.Moussa could not move and did not dare to make a sound. She could only bite her lower lip to resist the rising pleasure in the lower body.However, the body\u2019s reaction was often not controlled by willpower. Moussa\u2019s flower flowed water beyond control under Chelsea\u2019s endless pumping. A lot more water flowed, and the sound of splashing kept increasing.Moussa was afraid that Ryan would hear it. She was so ashamed that she was about to cry again, but she didn\u2019t dare to make a sound. She could only shake her head repeatedly and shouted no silently.At that time, a slight snoring sound came from Ryan\u2019s direction, indicating that he was already asleep.Moussa flattened her mouth in aggravation and whispered, \u201cRyan is here. Please don\u2019t do it.\u201dChelsea looked up and kissed her on the lips, saying in a low voice, \u201cHe is already asleep. What are you afraid of? I am thirsty, and your down there is dripping wet. I want to drink.\u201dHe said so and went down to her body, bending her thighs outward to present her whole p*ssy to him. Moussa wanted to close her legs in shame, but he spread them even more.Although it was completely dark and there was no light in the house, he could still see clearly in the darkness, a natural ability of beasts.Chelsea looked at the pink squirming involuntary. He swallowed his saliva and kissed it. He was sucking hard as he pressed his mouth against hers, freeing up a hand to play with her arse.Moussa was getting itchy and uncomfortable. She raised her hands above her head and grabbed the animal skin beneath her, and moved up. As soon as she moved, Chelsea drew her back forcefully, and then he stuffed two fingers into her arse and worked harder.Moussa winced in pain and dared not move again. He sucked her p*ssy and swallowed it with a big mouthful. The sound was so loud that she was frightened, afraid of waking up Ryan. The only way was to beg him softly, \u201cHusband, please, don\u2019t do it. You will wake up Ryan. Tomorrow night, I\u2019ll listen to you. Tomorrow night, you can do whatever you want.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He really wanted to kill her.But she said she would listen to him tomorrow night, and he could do whatever he wanted, which was a great temptation to him.So he raised his head from her p*ssy and pressed himself against her again, confirming, \u201cReally?\u201dMoussa nodded.Chelsea pushed his finger into her chrysanthemum as he wickedly smiled, \u201cThen I\u2019m going to f*ck you here.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll die of pain.\u201d Moussa frowned and begged him.\u201cNo, it\u2019s already loosened up. I can put in three fingers.\u201d Proving that he was right, he inserted another finger into it.Moussa hissed in pain and hurriedly covered her mouth. Deflated, she thought, \u201cForget it. Just let him go in. He is so interested in there. It is only a matter of time before he has to go in.\u201d However, when she thought of the pain, Moussa could not help but wince.Seeing that she did not answer for a long time, Chelsea impatiently urged, \u201cSay it quickly. If not, I am now going to f*ck you in your front hole. You have to keep your voice down. If you shout so loudly, as usual, you will wake him up.\u201dThen he spread her legs, and his big c*ck was on her p*ssy and was about to go inside.Moussa was shocked and quickly stopped him, \u201cNo, I promise, I promise.\u201dChelsea kissed her happily and laughed, \u201cWife, you are an excellent wife. Tomorrow night, your husband will let you experience a lot of pleasure. I won\u2019t go in tonight, but you have to suck me out with this little mouth on top. I\u2019m so swollen I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d He said so while rubbing his c*ck in her p*ssy.Moussa glared at him in anger. He asked her to suck it out for him, so what was the difference between that and putting it in? Then she thought it would make less noise.And so she compromised and went down on him. Moussa appeared to want to please him too. She no longer just held it like she did the last two times, with her tongue refusing to touch it in any way.Her small tongue licked the top a few times, twirling in circles as it rubbed, and the smallmouth opened to its fullest to take in the huge head.\u201cMmmm\u2026 \u201d Chelsea sounded comfortable. He felt her soft mouth wrapped tightly around his huge c*ck. Her tongue was so unskilled that it would sweep around, and occasionally her teeth would bite, causing him some stinging pain.But it was so comfortable, wrapped in her tight little mouth. The feeling was exciting and relaxing.She spent a good time and finally got half of it in, but she couldn\u2019t get the rest in. She had to play with her hand on it.Her tongue kept sliding on the top, imitating the action of pumping in and out. However, her mouth was numb, and Chelsea still didn\u2019t want to come.Moussa got impatient and spat out the whole thing. Then she looked up and complained, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you coming?\u201dMoussa could not keep up with his pace. He made her lose her breath, and she had to push his hand while she whimpered.Hearing her uncomfortable whimpers, Chelsea was upset and quickly made a dozen or so strokes. Then he let her go and quickly pulled himself out and came.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sitting there gasping for air, she was in tears like a poor thing and was glaring at him.Chelsea laughed lightly and pulled the animal skin under to wipe her clean. Then he removed her clothes and cuddled with her to rest. He coaxed softly in her ear, \u201cOkay, baby, do not be angry. I will help you take a bath in the morning.\u201dMoussa glared at him again and retorted in a lowered voice, \u201cThen you cannot seize the opportunity to bully me.\u201d He helped her take a bath every morning for the past few days, but only after he had ruthlessly bullied her in the bathtub.\u201cLittle thing, how is that bullying? You are always screaming that you are enjoying my-\u201c.However, before Chelsea could say anything, Moussa covered his mouth and warned in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201dChelsea did not give in and pulled down her little hand and refuted, \u201cWhere am I talking nonsense? Are you not satisfied with mine?\u201d\u201cYou \u2026 \u201d Moussa was exasperated. The more she didn\u2019t let him talk, the more he spoke. He was too thick-skinned to know what shame was. So she turned around and ignored him.Chelsea insisted and nibbled on her ear, threatening, \u201cSay it, or we\u2019ll try it again.\u201dHe so tormented Moussa that she could only say perfunctorily, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m satisfied. Go to sleep. I\u2019m sleepy.\u201dChelsea was very dissatisfied with her dismissal and bit her on the neck. He said hatefully, \u201cLittle thing, you dare to dismiss me. Let\u2019s see how I will fix you tomorrow night.\u201dMoussa closed her eyes and concentrated, thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s for tomorrow anyway. Let\u2019s leave it for tomorrow.\u201dToday she was drained. After being scared by that green thing, crying all night, and messing around with Chelsea, she was physically and mentally exhausted.With Chelsea around her back and his unique male scent, she suddenly felt so relieved. It was like she was not afraid of anything with him around. It was not long before Moussa fell asleep.She slept sweetly, but there were two who could not sleep peacefully throughout the night.One was Chelsea behind her. Although the desire was temporarily relieved, he was not satisfied. He was busy soothing the little thing in his arms, and he did not have time to think. Now that Moussa was asleep, the scene of her being held in Ryan\u2019s arms in the evening kept playing before his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to wake up the little thing in his arms and pound her to death, but he could not. He knew that Ryan was not asleep. Beasts were sensitive to breathing. If he had been sleeping, his breathing would never have been the same as it was now, nor would he get excited with the sound of Moussa\u2019s whimpers.He did that intentionally just to give Ryan a warning. So he would know clearly that Moussa was already his partner, and all she had was his.But if he had to make love to Moussa in front of Ryan, he really couldn\u2019t do it. He was becoming greedier. He wanted to keep everything about Moussa private and didn\u2019t like to share it with anyone. So he was doomed to be tortured by desire as well as a sleepless night of anger.The other one was, of course, Ryan, who had been pretending to sleep. He was suffering a lot at the moment.In the evening, he had held Moussa firmly in his arms. He simply could not describe that soft feeling. He knew that Chelsea would not be happy to see him, but he just couldn\u2019t let go. When Chelsea invited him to stay at his house for the night, he knew it would be hard for him to see her with Chelsea, but he didn\u2019t hesitate to come along.Every night he would sneak into their backyard and plant the seedlings he had picked up for Moussa during the day. He inadvertently heard Moussa\u2019s moans.\u201cAhhhhh! So hard \u2026 Too deep! So much! So painful! Ah! Gently! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!\u201d\u201cGently\u2026 Ah ah ah! I\u2019m going to die from your c*ck, ah! Gently\u2026 It\u2019s too deep. It hurts! Um!\u201dHe was so thirsty. He couldn\u2019t help but start to fantasize that if he were on top of Moussa, he would not hurt her. He would be very gentle and tender and make her very comfortable.But why was her partner not him? Clearly, it was he who saved her.Tonight he was lying so close to Moussa, smelling her body\u2019s faint scent. Listening to Chelsea forcing her to do that for him, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a reaction, imagining that what she was taking in her small mouth was his.Ryan felt himself going crazy. He was so jealous that he needed all his strength to keep himself from rolling over and pulling Chelsea out for a duel.If he rose at this moment, Moussa would be embarrassed. She would not want him to see how she looked at that moment. He pitied her so much. How could he let her be embarrassed? So he forced himself to hold back.Thus the two beasts, each with their thoughts but both tortured to sleep through the night. When the day was almost up, they were finally tired and fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But when she did, Chelsea woke up and opened his eyes to look at her. Obviously, he was still sleepy.Moussa found his look at the moment very cute. She smiled tenderly at him, then kissed him on the lips and said softly, \u201cYou sleep a little more. I will make a delicious breakfast for you to eat. I will call you when it is ready.\u201dChelsea was indeed too sleepy, so he nodded. He released her hand and let her out of bed, then closed his eyes and went back to sleep.Moussa tiptoed to the bathroom, grabbing another animal skin dress from the closet and walking barefoot. Her shoes had been ripped when she fell off the cliff, and the male beasts here were thick-skinned and did not wear shoes. Female beasts also only wear a kind of shoes made of grass.But Moussa thought it was too bruising to the feet. So inside the house, she did not wear it whenever she could. The good thing was that it was now spring, and it was not cold to walk barefoot on the wooden floor, but not in winter. It looked like she had to make a pair of shoes for herself as soon as possible.Moussa sighed. She had to do a lot of things. Moussa needed to figure out how to make clothes, shoes, food, but Chelsea was always messing with her. She was so busy satisfying his desires these days that she didn\u2019t have time to think about these things. So she had to find a way to keep him in check.She was thinking about it while taking care of herself. The good thing was that Chelsea did not enter last night, so her body was clean. She simply had to wipe her body, wash her face and tidy her hair.There was no toothbrush or toothpaste, so Moussa found a fruit with a similar mint flavor. Moussa bit down, so the mint flavor filled her whole mouth. Then she held it for a while and spat it out. After rinsing her mouth, it was considered as brushing her teeth.After taking care of herself, Moussa started to think about what to do for breakfast. It was really tiresome to eat roasted food all day long.Well, yes, she could stew. They certainly had never eaten something stewed.Moussa thought it was a good idea and excitedly began to move. She went to the storage room first and brought two pieces of some kind of meat. She didn\u2019t know what kind of animal they were, but they were thin and had some tendons.Moussa lived in a simple wooden house that did not have the so-called kitchen. They usually cooked in the room where they slept. For fear of waking them both up today, Moussa lit a fire in the bathroom. She then placed a much larger shell than the one she had before.Moussa was not sure what kind of animal shell was placed on the frame. She boiled water inside, then washed and cut the meat into small pieces using the sharp animal bone. As soon as the water boiled, she put the meat into the pot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she couldn\u2019t name them, she distinguished several kinds of wild fruits and remembered their taste.When it was almost cooked, she took the fruits she found, cut them into small pieces, and threw them into the pot. Then she squeezed the juice of the salty fruits into the pot. There was no salt there, and that dark fruit provided the saltiness. Moussa had tried several times to extract the salt from that fruit without success. So, for the time being, she could only use its juice as a substitute for salt.After boiling again, Moussa used a small wooden spoon to scoop up the soup to try. Forget about it; it was not bad. It tasted like tomato and beef brisket soup, but of course, it was only a bit like that. The seasonings were too different from the original ones, but it was much better than eating roasted meat all day long.The house smelled delicious, at least. It smelled much better than roasting.Chelsea and Ryan were awakened by the aroma and followed the scent with their sleepy eyes.As soon as Chelsea opened the door, he asked, \u201cThat smells good. What did you make?\u201dWhen Moussa saw that they were awake, she smiled and greeted them, \u201cYou\u2019re awake. Hurry up, wash your face and brush your teeth. It\u2019s time to eat.\u201dThe two of them were stunned. They knew about the face washing, but what was the tooth brushing?Moussa saw that the two were stunned, so she handed them the fruit with a mint flavor. For this reason, she called it mint fruit. She instructed, \u201cTake a bite and put it in your mouth.\u201dThe two men did as she instructed, and after a while, Moussa handed them a bowl of water and said, \u201cSpit it out, and then rinse your mouth.\u201dSeeing Chelsea\u2019s embarrassed face, Moussa asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dChelsea said bitterly, \u201cThis fruit is too terrible. I swallowed it directly.\u201d\u201cIdiot, take another bite and hold it.\u201d Moussa scolded with a smile.Chelsea glared at her viciously but complied and took another bite and held it. Then he spat it out and rinsed his mouth.After tasting the flavor, he praised, \u201cI\u2019ve never thought that this is quite pleasant to the mouth.\u201dOn the other side, Ryan also rinsed his mouth. He smiled gently and said to Moussa, \u201cMoussa, you are smart. Amazingly, you can think of such a good idea. My mouth feels so much better.\u201dMoussa felt good in her heart and smiled at Ryan, somewhat embarrassed.The smile on Moussa\u2019s face looked very dazzling to Chelsea, and without even thinking about it, he took her into his arms. Moussa froze for a moment, and out of the corner of her eye, she saw Ryan on the side. A little embarrassed, she pushed him and changed the subject, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and eat. We have to go help Ryan build a house later.\u201dChelsea released her, but his hand was always around her waist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After eating a bowl of stew, he went to the room and served another bowl himself. He only stopped eating until the whole pot was at the bottom, looking at Moussa passionately.Ryan\u2019s way of eating was much more civilized compared to Chelsea\u2019s. Nevertheless, he also ate three or four bowls before stopping, praising the good taste straight from his mouth. Though he wasn\u2019t as blatant as Chelsea, his eyes were burning hot when he looked at Moussa.Moussa was a little embarrassed by the two of them looking at her. But seeing what she had done was eaten clean by them, she had a sense of accomplishment.After a quick cleaning up, she urged them to go out and build the house.Chelsea turned to Ryan and said, \u201cYou first go and gather a few tribesmen, clean up the place, and get some wood back. I will be coming later.\u201dRyan\u2019s eyes darkened, then nodded and walked out.As soon as Ryan walked out of the house, Chelsea pulled Moussa into his arms and kissed her passionately.As he kissed her, he pressed her against the wall, lifted her clothes, and forced her legs apart with his big hands, pushing his fingers into her p*ssy and then pumping his way up.Moussa tried to resist, but he sealed her mouth, and her waist was also suppressed. All she could do was to keep slapping his back with her tiny hands, and her mouth made the sound of ooh\u2019s to protest.But Chelsea didn\u2019t pay attention to her, nor did he stop. He found that she began to leak down there, so he pulled out his fingers and ripped off his animal skin skirt. He was hard for a long time and then pushed his way into the tight place.\u201cMmm.\u201d Moussa was not ready. Although she was wet, apparently not wet enough. A sudden injection of his big one caused Moussa to bite him on the lips.Chelsea was bitten and hissed as he released her lips. Seeing her frowning in pain, he stopped the stabbing action and reached down to massage the sensitive ball below her while cajoling in a low voice, \u201cBaby, relax. Let me in. You\u2019ll be comfortable in a while.\u201dMoussa glared at him angrily, but she knew it was impossible to let him out now. So she had to relax and let him go all the way in. It was her fault for suffering in the end.Chelsea felt her cooperation and smiled. His waist exerted a force, slamming to the very end, and his huge head jabbed inside her cervix.He sighed with pleasure, \u201cBaby, you are so tight and comfortable.\u201dMoussa was made speechless by his rough action. She was tilting her head back and gasping for air.Chelsea, however, could not resist and did not wait for her to adapt. He wrapped her legs around his waist and sprinted vigorously.Ryan got away from the house, but not far enough. The beastmen\u2019s excellent hearing allowed him to clearly hear the sounds of whispering and panting inside the house. There was no need to guess what Chelsea was doing to her.His hands were clenched into fists, almost sinking his nails into them. His mind kept yelling, why? Why was he not Moussa\u2019s partner? He would love to take her into his arms, comfort her, protect her, tenderly call her baby, then let her moan and gasp under him, giving her the ultimate pleasure. But he couldn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t qualified.He really hated himself for not trying to win the position of chief. If he were the chief, he would be the one holding Moussa in his arms right now. Ryan kept telling himself that he could not break them. No, Chelsea was his brother, and he could not betray him.It took a while to calm himself down. He forced himself to leave Chelsea\u2019s house with a heavy step and gather the tribesmen to start working.Since it was daytime, the window was not closed. Therefore, Moussa bit her lips and did not dare to scream. She only could suppress the sound of grunts and hums as his strokes went up and down. The two tender masses in front of her also went up and down with her, making Chelsea\u2019s mouth dry. He could not control his strength and was fierce as if he wanted to squeeze his whole body into her p*ssy.Moussa received more. She could not bear it and begged for mercy, \u201cChelsea. Gently. Ah ah ah! Will break. Be gentle\u2026\u201dHer charming look tickled Chelsea, but his mind suddenly recalled how she was held by Ryan yesterday. He was instantly furious and leaned down to look at her with hatred. \u201cLittle thing, I just want to screw you. How dare you let him hold you. Let me see if I don\u2019t f*ck you to death if you still dare.\u201dThat said, the lower body also seemed to feel the owner\u2019s rage that was slightly sweet and sour and became even thicker. All at once, it stabbed Moussa\u2019s pussy relentlessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew that this was the fire of desire and jealousy that he had been holding in for a night. She hurriedly clung to his neck and ingratiatingly stretched out her little tongue to lick his Adam\u2019s apple, gasping for breath as she licked it. \u201cI don\u2019t dare to do it again, Chelsea. Ah! Spare me \u2026\u2026 from now on. I only let you hold. Ah! Husband \u2026\u2026\u201dWith the phrase \u201conly let you hold,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s heart finally felt more comfortable and asked, \u201cOnly me? To let me f*ck?\u201dMoussa only begged him to cool his anger quickly. No matter what he said, she obediently repeated after, \u201cMm\u2026 Only for you, for you to f*ck.\u201dChelsea was satisfied. Lowering his head to capture her earlobe, he asked, \u201cThen do you feel good with me?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u00a0 Feel good. Chelsea, husband\u2026 You are so good\u2026 So strong \u2026 \u201d Chelsea suddenly hit hard the most sensitive spot inside her p*ssy. She couldn\u2019t control herself and shuddered with Chelsea and came.Chelsea apparently discovered that unusually tiny bulge. He was curious in her trembling climax. She kept on tightening her p*ssy, but he kept on smashing it several times.\u201dAh! Don\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t hit it! Ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa\u2019s body was more sensitive because of the climax. She could not stand that kind of stimulation. She kept shaking her head and screaming, her hands were randomly pushing, and her legs were tighter around his waist. She wanted to move her waist back to avoid him, but somehow she slammed herself back into him and met his blows.Moussa became crazy from the constant overlapping stimulation. She desperately clenched herself, not knowing if she wanted to squeeze him out or to suck deeper. The smooth and soft body squirmed in his arms like a snake.Chelsea couldn\u2019t withstand her extreme tightening and was overwhelmed by her suction. He growled and stabbed her hard again, spurting out against her most sensitive point.After calming down, Chelsea seemed dissatisfied that he was out so soon. He still held her against the wall. His hands were rubbing her buttocks and refusing to take out the softened member.Moussa whimpered and cried for a while. Finally, she calmed down and suddenly remembered that the tribe was still waiting for Chelsea to help Ryan build the house. He even pinned her down and made love in the house.So she pushed him away and urged, \u201cChelsea, the tribesmen are waiting for you to help Ryan build a house. Get it out quickly.\u201dChelsea also knew that he could not delay any longer. Unwilling to pull himself out, he let go of her. While putting on the animal skin skirt, he said in a stern voice, \u201cLittle thing, I\u2019ll clean you up when I get back tonight.\u201d After saying that, he walked out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t do anything. Why should she be cleaned up?Rubbing her sore waist, Moussa slowly stood up and went to the bathroom to rinse herself off. She was ready to go out and see what she could do to help. After all, she was the reason why he burned his house down.After taking two steps, she felt some pain in her belly. She put her hand on it and rubbed it. She was worried if the stinky lion had really broken it. Then it occurred to her that, crap. She seemed to be getting that thing. She always got delayed for a few days every month. There was no calendar in this place, and she barely remembered how long she had been here, but it felt like it.She had forgotten about this kind of thing. What should she do? There were no sanitary napkins, tampons, or anything like that here.In the end, she had no choice but to get a piece of animal skin. She made two holes in it and then slipped her legs into it, pulling it up to her waist. Using the stronger grass, she tied a small lump on the side of the excess part and made a simple panty to wear. This was better than nothing. Although it might not be helpful, it was better than the blood flowing out directly.As soon as Moussa got out, the beastmen had cleaned up the burned remains of Ryan\u2019s house and brought in enough wood.Chelsea and Ryan led the beastmen to stake a few sturdy planks of wood into the ground for a good and secure foundation. Moussa did not dare to go over and disturb him. She saw some females standing next to her, holding buckets of water, bowls of water, and so on. They brought water to the males to drink.Moussa stiffly walked over and greeted them, \u201cHello everyone, my name is Moussa.\u201dSeveral females looked back at her, indifferently nodded at her, and turned away.Moussa was momentarily struck. She awkwardly stood there and did not know what to say.\u201cMoussa, you are also here.\u201d A voice suddenly came from behind Moussa. It made Moussa flinch and turn around to see that it was Ivy.She nodded at her apologetically and said softly, \u201cIvy, hello.\u201dIvy smiled gently while walking to her side and said, \u201cYou still remember my name. I thought you would not remember it after Chelsea only introduced me once.\u201dMoussa smiled at her awkwardly, thinking how could she not remember it? That embarrassing incident really stuck in her mind.Seeing her embarrassment, Ivy changed the subject and said, \u201cIn the future, when you want to go out to pick wild fruits, call me. I\u2019ll go with you. It will be more interesting for two people to be together. I\u2019m bored alone.\u201dMoussa\u2019s eyes lit up in surprise when she heard this and said, \u201cReally? That\u2019s really great. Ivy, thank you.\u201dIvy laughed at her words, \u201cWhat are you thanking me for? it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Although Chelsea specially came to ask her, she was curious about this small female. It made Chelsea especially came to ask her and made Ryan even burned down the house for her. This small figure was not simple at all. The two bravest males of the new generation in the tribe were quite protective of her.Actually, the green python was only just hatched, and its killing power was still feeble. It should not be difficult for Ryan\u2019s skill to finish it off. However, it was impossible to protect her safety fully, so he chose to set his house on fire with the green python. It was really like something Ryan would do.Both of them chatted about one thing or another while the beastmen finished putting up the pilings and came over to rest and drink.When Chelsea saw Moussa, he walked over quickly. Embracing her and kissing her on the lips, he asked in a low voice, \u201cWhy are you out? You\u2019re not tired?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moussa was shy and red-faced and dared not raise her head.Chelsea wrapped his arms around her and began to answer back by saying, \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not supposed to be passionate with my partner. Or are you complaining that Sander isn\u2019t passionate enough for you?\u201dNot picking up on Chelsea\u2019s provocation, the naive Sander put his arm around Ivy and exclaimed, \u201cWas I not enthusiastic enough to satisfy you last night? Then let\u2019s go home now.\u201dThe other beastmen laughed again at his words as Ivy gasped and pinched hard Sander\u2019s waist.Chelsea continued to provoke, \u201cSander, you certainly did not feed her, or else why is she so angry. Look at my Moussa. I filled her to the brim and how well-behaved she is now. It is time to hurry home and start feeding her.\u201d Saying that he also deliberately raised Moussa\u2019s chin. He gave a loud kiss on her lips, causing Moussa to shy away even more and nestle into his arms, refusing to come out. She knew he was doing it on purpose. So even if she was shy, she couldn\u2019t pinch him in public as Ivy did. That would make him lose face.Sander seemed to be really provoked. Ignoring Ivy\u2019s violent struggle and protest, he really carried her and walked home.\u201cSander, you put me down. Sander\u2026 \u201d Ivy was simply infuriated. She was lying on Sander\u2019s shoulder, punching, hitting, and biting him.Moussa was shocked to see that. She withdrew her first impression of Ivy. She was not gentle at all.She must be mad at Sander for not helping her and even helping Chelsea bully her.Moussa pulled Chelsea\u2019s arm and whispered, \u201cIs that okay? They\u2019re not going to fight, are they?\u201dChelsea replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Sander is very strong. Once he banged her in bed, she would not stay angry.\u201dMoussa rushed to cover his mouth to keep him from talking. Looking around, she instantly felt shame. This was really the \u2018beast\u2019 world, and no one would feel embarrassed to talk about this in public. It seemed like she was making a fuss.Chelsea pulled her hand and nibbled it. Then he released her, saying, \u201cWell, you be good and watch on the side. We have to start working.\u201dMoussa hurriedly pulled him, telling him what she just had a flash of light in her head. \u201cChelsea, could you build Ryan\u2019s house a little higher off the ground. If it rains, the water outside won\u2019t get the ground wet, but also to prevent snakes and insects and other things from crawling in.\u201dChelsea thought about it, and the other beastmen also discussed it. After all, they built their house directly on the ground, so it was very stable. If they made the house higher from the ground, as she said, there were so many benefits. But it would not be strong, and it was not convenient to go up and down.Without waiting for Chelsea to speak, Ryan thought for a while before saying, \u201cI think Moussa\u2019s proposal is good. The summer will come soon. The terrain of our village is very high, but if it rains too much, the house will still be in the water. We are all busy pouring water outside the house during the rainy season every year, and it\u2019s hard. If it is secured, we will all build our houses higher than the ground when the rainy season comes. What do you think?\u201dMoussa looked at Ryan gratefully. He was so good that he was willing to use his house as a test, but she would not let him down. The house would be solid. She remembered that one of the ethnic groups built their houses high off the ground in her world.At this point, Chelsea also spoke, \u201cI also think it will work. Now we\u2019ll stake a few more pillars down, a little deeper. Then start building a house half a man\u2019s height above the ground.\u201dWhen the other beastmen heard that the house owner agreed and the chief had spoken, there was nothing more they could say about it, and they took action.Then, at Moussa\u2019s suggestion, the house was divided into several small rooms, with a bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a well-ventilated drying room to air-dry the remaining meat for consumption in the rainy season and winter.A corridor was added around the house, where tables and chairs could be placed to chat about whatever. As for the inconvenience of going up and down, Moussa instructed them to make a wooden ladder.That said, the nails of the beastmen were very sharp. They were usually hidden in the flesh, the same as human nails. They stick out when used. Their long and sharp claws were too convenient to cut up the wood, so they built a wooden house in a short time.Everyone walked up, back and forth several times, and felt it was really entirely secure.Chelsea looked at Ryan\u2019s new house and the remaining woods. He said to the tribe, \u201cAnyway, there is so much wood left. Everyone go and help me build my house again. I\u2019ll treat everyone to lunch.\u201dHearing that Chelsea was also going to rebuild the house, Moussa was thrilled and smiled, saying she wanted everyone to try her cooking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chelsea\u2019s roasting skills were first class in this tribe. Moreover, this unique female also said she would do the cooking. They all couldn\u2019t wait.Chelsea set up a fire directly in the village clearing, and Moussa probably counted a total of twelve males and then a capacity of twelve females who were going to eat. She went home and fetched four shells and set them over the fire, while Ryan helped her fill them with water and helped her carry several pieces of meat. Moussa smiled and took them, cutting them neatly into tiny pieces.At this point, Chelsea also finished the fire and came to see her cutting effort. Ryan, meanwhile, lengthened his long nails, quickly helping her cut everything.Moussa made four pots of stew just like she did in the morning, and Chelsea almost took all the meat stored in the house and roasted them. That should be enough for this beastmen with a large appetite to eat.A little while later, the scent of the stew came out. The beastmen salivated.Finally, when the meat stew was ready, the beastmen did not need to wait. They gathered around the pot and grabbed the meat to eat. Moussa was run over by them, nearly falling to the ground.Thanks to Ryan\u2019s swift hand supporting her, she did not fall. All she wanted to do was thank him when Chelsea pulled her into his arms.Moussa looked up and saw that his face was not very good. She knew he was back to being petty, so she quickly pushed him aside and coached him in a low voice, \u201cHusband, don\u2019t be like that. Ryan only saw I was going to fall, so he helped me out. Do you wish to see me fall?\u201dChelsea was a little embarrassed when she said that. His eyes were all over the place, and he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dMoussa inwardly spat, \u201cOh, you did not say anything. You didn\u2019t say anything last night either, but when you remembered, you were jealous, and you tormented me.\u201dWhile she could not say these things, she was still coaxing Chelsea to be more effective. In a soft voice, \u201cI knew my husband is the most broad-minded. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t worry about something so insignificant.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s.\u201d Chelsea was so proud to hear her praise that he couldn\u2019t show it in his heart even though he really cared.Ryan watched from afar as the two kissed each other. Clenching his hands into fists, he bit his lips hard. Using the pain on his lips to keep himself awake, he reluctantly withdrew his gaze and got the food with the others.By the time the two of them walked back to eat, the meat and stew were all gone. It was good that Ryan had saved some for them in advance.Moussa and Chelsea quickly sat down to eat lunch. Chelsea took a few males to demolish the house and piled up the wood, leaving a few females with Moussa to clean up the dishes. Moussa somehow felt that they looked at her differently. She was not sure if she was too sensitive.After cleaning up for a while, Moussa could not name a female who suddenly came over to talk. \u201cMoussa, your pot of meat is delicious. Could you teach me that?\u201dThe other female also gathered around, scrambling to be the first to yell, \u201cI also want to learn. I also want to learn. Please teach me too.\u201dMoussa froze for a moment. It was pretty goosebumpy to think that several big men with shy and excited faces gathered around her to learn how to cook meat.But as soon as she thought that they were females in this other world, she desperately hypnotized herself that they were females. They were females but just a little stronger. She must not discriminate against them. She must not discriminate against them.As a result, the corners of her mouth trembled, and she pulled out a forced smile and responded, \u201cIt\u2019s actually straightforward. First, wash the meat and cut it into small pieces. Then boil the water, and put the meat into the pot. Add some sweet and sour fruit and stew it together.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you need.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty easy.\u201d\u201cHow many fruits should be added?\u201dA few females asked as they worked while dragging Moussa around asking questions.Moussa was very patient in explaining to them one by one until the dishes were cleaned. Moussa had gotten very warm with several females and gradually got used to these purely male faces appearing shy, delicate, and other feminine expressions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t expect to find someone as strong as him to ask for her opinion first, which was really not easy.She quickly crouched down with a branch to draw her ideas to him. The village had a lot of space available, and it was okay to build more houses. There should be a bathroom, a kitchen, a storage room, a large living room, and two bedrooms.What happened last night must not happen again. Moussa was not averse to having a baby for him right now. However, she was a bit worried that the two of them might have weirdly shaped babies. Besides, they could use it in the future when they have a baby.Chelsea remembered them all. Because of the experience of building a house for Ryan, they were very skilled in creating a better one this time!The beastmen toured inside and outside and went home to rest, leaving Moussa and Chelsea to make further improvements to their house.Moussa looked at their new house and was excited. Also, Chelsea used the remaining wood and hollowed out the middle into a reclining chair and made some closets, storage cabinets, and so on.It had been busy until it was almost dark before the furnishings were added neatly. Feeling a little tired, the two worked on the division of labor. Moussa made dinner, and Chelsea boiled the bathwater.The food was done, and the bathwater was almost boiled. Two people hurriedly ate, and Moussa then went to take a bath.Well, \u2018it\u2019 hadn\u2019t arrived yet, so she hurriedly took off her clothes and entered the bathtub. Taking off the panties and looking at them, it was clean. Mmm, she was tired all day. Taking a hot bath was really comfortable.After soaking for a while, she felt the water overflowing, and then a warm body leaned over.There was no need to guess. It must be Chelsea. Moussa sighed and complained, \u201cI told you to wash later, right? Why did you come and rush after me again.\u201d\u201cI just like to wash with you.\u201dChelsea said while lowering his head and nibbling on her neck. His hands also roamed around her body.\u201cHmm. Chelsea, I\u2019m tired, not tonight, okay?\u201d Moussa said while avoiding him.\u201cLittle thing, you want to play a rogue. Don\u2019t forget what you promised me last night. You have to listen to me tonight and do whatever I want.\u201d Saying so, he poked his long middle finger into Moussa\u2019s p*ssy.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa exclaimed. She pushed herself upward to the edge of the barrel and was pulled back by Chelsea\u2019s large hands. His arms were wrapped around her, and he stroked her vigorously.It was only then that Moussa remembered that she had been forced to promise last night. She couldn\u2019t help but secretly scream. She regretted it. How could she have agreed to it on impulse last night?Chelsea rubbed her buttocks with his hardened c*ck while taking her earlobe and ambiguously declared, \u201cI\u2019ll penetrate your front hole first, to make you feel good, and then f*ck your behind. I\u2019ll make you feel good tonight.\u201dMoussa was nervous and had forgotten to be shy. She didn\u2019t know if it was exciting. She only knew that she would definitely die of pain if he really let her into her *sshole with that size.Moussa hadn\u2019t come up with how to do well when Chelsea had already pulled out his fingers from her p*ssy. Then, he parted her legs to the maximum and held his huge glans, slowly squeezing into her pussy. Seeing her pussy wrapping the glans around the whole thing, he thrust his waist and ferociously pushed to the end.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa screamed from the sudden pain stimulation.Chelsea stopped her body, teasing, \u201cLittle thing, I am not fully inside yet, and you are screaming so loud. Does it feel good? Hmm?\u201dAs soon as he said that, he pushed the large glans past the opening of her cervix and squeezed it in.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa screamed again, contracting herself violently, trying to push his rod out. Her sensitive body was about to have an explosion and could not withstand such intense stimulation from him.Chelsea didn\u2019t wait for her scream to stop and started thrusting fast.Moussa survived the initial pain. Pursing her lips, she tried to relax her body and grunted as he moved in and out quickly.Suddenly, she felt a terrible pain in her belly, and there seemed to be some special sticky fluid flowing out. Moussa screamed, \u201cOh no, why didn\u2019t you come early and then come late? How come you picked this time to visit?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stop. Stop. I don\u2019t feel good. Stop.\u201dAt this point, Chelsea already saw red. How could he stop? Hearing her plea, he thought she was trying to bluff again.So he took her more forcefully into his arms. His lower part of the body controlled the strength a little. Chelsea lowered his head and nibbled on her shoulder, and said, \u201cLittle thing, I have not come out once. How do you want to cheat again?\u201d\u201cNo, Chelsea. I\u2019m uncomfortable. You\u2026 quickly. Stop. No!\u00a0 Ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa didn\u2019t know how to explain her physical condition to him, but she couldn\u2019t move because he controlled her. so she shook her head desperately and shouted no.Chelsea did not believe that she was really uncomfortable. She was just fine. How could she say that she was uncomfortable? So, he banged her hard again.\u201cA!\u201d Moussa moaned in pain as more fluid flowed out from down there in response to the stimulation.\u201cYou \u2026\u2026 stop \u2026\u2026 blood \u2026\u2026 bleeding.\u201dChelsea was shocked at the words. He looked carefully, and indeed even the bathwater had changed color.He freaked out by this and hurriedly drew himself out. He carried Moussa back to the bed and pried open her p*ssy to check for her. There was no tear at the entrance, and that meant she was bleeding inside.Watching the hole still dripping with scarlet liquid, Chelsea panicked and pulled over an animal skin skirt while rushing outside.\u201cHey, Chelsea, where are you going?\u201d Moussa shouted after him, but he did not look back and rushed out.Guess he went to the village healer Karida right away. That would be embarrassing. She wanted to get up and go after him, but she was still bleeding down there. She rushed to the bathroom, rinsed off, then put on her homemade panties and then put on her clothes.As soon as she reached the door, Chelsea dragged Karida inside like a gust of wind.Seeing her standing in the doorway, he shouted anxiously, \u201cWhy did you get off the bed?\u201d Then he picked her up and carried her back to bed.Karida followed him to the bed. His face did not look very good. Moussa also inadvertently saw his animal skin skirt and Chelsea\u2019s, supported by something underneath. It was not difficult to guess that Chelsea had interrupted something good in his house. It was no wonder that his face was so unsightly.Karida pressed Moussa\u2019s stomach over the clothes and looked under her eyes. As for the bleeding there, Chelsea would not let him see anything. Then he asked Moussa a few questions, such as whether it hurts or not here, where it felt pain, and so on.Moussa told him that it did not hurt, and Karida finally said he could not do anything about it. He threw Chelsea a pile of herbs to stop the bleeding and turned around to go away.Chelsea wanted to bring him back, but Moussa stopped him and said she was okay.But Chelsea refused to believe. How could she be okay after bleeding so much, and she kept on bleeding.Knowing that Karida was really unable to help, Chelsea had to mash the herbs to stop the bleeding, then yanked off Moussa\u2019s homemade panties to smear them on her p*ssy.\u201cNo. No, Chelsea. I\u2019m really fine. No need to apply those herbs. It\u2019ll be fine in a few days.\u201d Moussa desperately avoided his hand to keep him from applying it in.\u201cWife, behave. It will stop the bleeding. You\u2019ll die if you keep bleeding like this. What will I do if you die? It\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s my fault for hurting you.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s voice got choked up at the end.Moussa felt her face as if it had been struck by a drop of warm water. Did Chelsea cry? She looked up to see him, but Chelsea had one hand over her eyes. The other hand took advantage of her, and she was no longer struggling when he applied the herbs in.Moussa grunted and felt the entry of a foreign object in her p*ssy. She knew that he had put the medicine in.She thought, \u201cNever mind. He wants to apply it, then let him do it. As long as he can rest easy.\u201d She wanted to explain that it was her body\u2019s natural process, but he was careful with her. His tears even fell because he could not let her die. It was selfish not to tell him. Moussa wanted him to keep taking care of her so carefully. And this way, her *sshole could escape a disaster tonight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was afraid that she would never wake up once she slept. From time to time, he would look at her p*ssy to see if it was still bleeding.Moussa was already sleepy when the day dawned, but Chelsea would not let her sleep. Moussa then swore and promised to sleep only for a while and wake up in a bit. Chelsea saw that her p*ssy did not seem to be bleeding anymore, so he let her take a nap.And he kept an eye on her, watching her breathing.Moussa comfortably slept and woke up in a daze. Right after she moved, she felt a sudden surge of blood below her and cried out, \u201cOh no.\u201dAs expected, Chelsea, who had been watching the situation of her p*ssy, immediately found that she began to bleed again. Moreover, a lot of blood came out, so he was scared and rushed to bring a basin of water to help her clean, and then applied the hemostatic herbs.However, these things won\u2019t work at all. Although Moussa knew it wouldn\u2019t work, she didn\u2019t tell him last night. Now that he was so nervous, she didn\u2019t dare to tell him the truth. She screamed in her heart that something was wrong. If this happened every month for a few days, he would have noticed that something was wrong, and then how would she explain it?Chelsea also did not go hunting to guard her day and night. He cleaned her from time to time and gave her medicine for three days. During this period, some other tribesmen heard that Moussa was sick and wanted to visit, but they were all yelled out by Chelsea. Only Karida was allowed to come in and check her body every day before leaving various herbs.He never left, feeding and sleeping with her. One time when Moussa fell asleep from exhaustion, she woke up with a wet face. She didn\u2019t know if it was her own sweat or Chelsea\u2019s tears. She was touched and worried. She was touched that he cared about her and worried that he would be furious if he knew the truth.The good thing was that Moussa\u2019s period was finally over, and no more blood came out of her p*ssy. Chelsea then let go of his worries and fell asleep tired. However, even if he went to sleep, he slept restlessly and woke up from time to time to make sure that Moussa was still lying safely by his side.Moussa somewhat blamed herself for scaring him. So she actively wrapped her arms around his waist and whispered in his ear to comfort him, \u201cChelsea, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not going to die. You can sleep without worrying. Don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dChelsea seems to have heard her comfort and slept peacefully. He did not wake up repeatedly.The following day, Chelsea got up early. He first checked Moussa\u2019s hole and saw that she did not continue to bleed before putting his mind at ease.He had not gone hunting for many days, and his family\u2019s meat stock was almost eaten. And if he did not go out hunting, they would have to go hungry. He told Moussa not to get out of bed, not allowing her to move around. He also did not feel at ease and asked Ivy to take care of her before hunting.Moussa got a big headache from his fussiness, and there was no way to say it. The only thing she could do was promise him that she would lie in bed and let Ivy take care of her. But she had been lying in bed for several days and was really uncomfortable.Ivy adamantly carried out Chelsea\u2019s orders, refusing to let her out of bed no matter what. Since she could not get out of bed, she had to settle for something she could do in bed. Moussa asked Ivy to help her find a very thin animal bone and then drilled a small hole in a section. The other end was sharpened, making a large needle.Then she asked her to find some animal skin straps that were used to tie things up. It took a lot of effort to finally thread the animal straps into the eye of the needle.Then she put the skins together and made a pair of animal skin boots, which were not very beautiful but could barely be worn. On another whim, Moussa asked Ivy to help her find two pieces of light wood. She wanted to wait for Chelsea to come back and use his nails to make two holes on the top to make a clog.Ivy looked at the soft and warm animal skin boots she made and wanted to learn how to make them. She asked Moussa to teach her. Though Moussa felt ashamed to see a big man with a needle sewing, she patiently taught her how to make a pair.Ivy seemed excited and ran home to get a variety of colors of animal skin to let Moussa help. One pair of white, gray, black, and red animal skin boots were made. Not to mention that these few pairs were made by the two, the craftsmanship was much better. It was not only sturdy but also good-looking. Moussa also purposely cut some white wool to make a small white ball. It was sewn at the toe of the animal skin boots, which immediately became playful and cute.Ivy was walking back and forth in the house excitedly wearing the animal skin boots when Chelsea returned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hugging the newly made animal skin boots, she ran home with great enthusiasm.Chelsea put his prey into the storage room today and washed his hands. He walked three or two steps to the bed and lifted Moussa\u2019s clothes to check the situation of her p*ssy. Moussa was so ashamed that she hurriedly pulled down her clothes and blocked it from him.She said, \u201cChelsea, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t make a fuss, okay?\u201dChelsea ignored her and took her hand away, forcing a check to make sure she was okay. After that, he found something else to care about and picked up the animal skin boots she made and asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201cThese are animal skin boots. They are warm on your feet in winter. I had forgotten about them until you said so. I want to make a pair of wooden clogs.\u201d Moussa excitedly pulled him and asked him to help.Chelsea didn\u2019t know what \u2018clogs\u2019 meant, but he did as he was told. Moussa took the wooden block with a good hole and fixed it with animal straps to make it look like clogs, and then excitedly wore it and walked around on the ground twice. The clogs weren\u2019t very comfortable, but at least they didn\u2019t hurt her feet, which made Moussa very satisfied.She wanted to make a pair for Chelsea, but he refused. He carried her to bed and let her lie down, and then he went to make their dinner.After the two had eaten dinner, Chelsea hugged her and lay on the bed together, chatting with each other. Chelsea told her what prey he had seen today when he went out hunting, and what he had fought back, what beast\u2019s meat was delicious, and what beast\u2019s flesh was hard and challenging.Moussa was actually not interested in these. Listening to him, she yawned and wondered why he was so talkative today. He usually couldn\u2019t wait to make his way to her after dinner, but today seemed a bit unusual.Still haven\u2019t come up with a reason; Moussa nestled in his arms and fell asleep.Moussa was allowed to get out of bed in the following days but could not go out of the village. She was only allowed inside the village.Chelsea left early and returned late every day. He worked very hard in hunting plenty of meat back and stocked it to meet the arrival of the rainy season.What gave Moussa headaches was that he would hold her every night to introduce her to various beasts\u2019 habits until she fell asleep. It was the only thing that stopped him from touching her.He was afraid of hurting her again. In the past, he worked on her every night. She thought it would be good if he didn\u2019t touch her. However, now that he really didn\u2019t touch her, she felt empty again and unsure of her heart.Moussa blushed and rubbed herself in his arms. Since he did not take the initiative, she took the initiative. Her hands slowly drew circles on his chest.Chelsea\u2019s breathing got faster. Moussa secretly smiled that this time he could not help it.Unexpectedly, Chelsea suddenly said, \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019m sleepy.\u201d Then he released her and turned his back to her.Moussa looked a bit dumbfounded. However, she had already done this, so she couldn\u2019t give up halfway.So she took the initiative to go over and hug him from behind, calling out seductively, \u201cHusband.\u201dChelsea got excited as she was. He turned around and pressed her, kissed and nibbled on her lips, and slid his hands between her legs, and rubbed her p*ssy.Moussa, who thought she had done well, softened her body and took the initiative to stick out her smooth tongue and tangled it with his.Chelsea\u2019s breathing became more and more rapid, yet he suddenly released her and sat up.Moussa opened her eyes in confusion and looked at him in a \u201chuh?\u201dChelsea looked at her small wet mouth, and the opening between her legs was gradually spitting fluid from a particular place. His eyes darkened. He loudly gulped and then forced himself to look away.\u201cIt\u2019s too hot. I\u2019ll go out to cool off.\u201d He was getting out of bed while saying that.Moussa was startled and hurriedly hugged him from behind, exclaiming, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201dChelsea tried to take her hands off his waist, but she was hugging him too tightly. He did not dare to use too much force for fear of hurting her and finally had to compromise.He coaxed, \u201cMoussa, baby, you\u2019re a good girl. Please let go of me. I can\u2019t hold back.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t hold back. I am letting you\u2026\u00a0 enjoy yourself. Why are you holding back?\u201d Moussa refused to follow suit. The more she spoke, the more her voice lowered, and at the end, it almost became a mosquito hum. Her face was red, and she did not dare to lift it up even when she was on his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But the thought of having so much blood for those three days, continuously flowing out of her body, made him scared again.Shaking his head, he refused, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll hurt you. I can\u2019t control the force once I\u2019m in there. No, absolutely not. That kind of mistake I won\u2019t make again.\u201dWhen he was still blaming himself, she couldn\u2019t take it, so she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m like that a few days a month. You didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201dChelsea froze for half a second and forcefully removed her hands. Grabbing her wrists, he turned around and glared at her, \u201cWhat do you mean by that? Explain to me clearly.\u201dMoussa cowered in fear, finally realizing what she had said on impulse. It was too late to regret, so she had to explain. \u201cI am different from your females here. I bleed from the inside a few days every month. It\u2019s normal and won\u2019t kill me.\u201dMoussa said while carefully watching his face. But Chelsea\u2019s face became even darker, and his eyes were glaring at her with anger. He suddenly flung her arm away, and Moussa was unprepared for it. This made her crawl on the bed, with her weight unstable.Chelsea grabbed her and held her in place, and with the force of his hands, her clothes were torn into pieces.Before she could react to what was happening, he pulled her legs apart and pushed in hard. Without mercy, he thrust into her cervix without pause.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa was not yet well-wet. He started to thrust intensely, and that dry, violent friction, making Moussa have the illusion of being torn apart forcibly.Moussa couldn\u2019t stand it and cried, \u201cChelsea.. ah! Gently. Please. Oooh. It hurts too much. Ah!\u201d\u201cYou lied to me. You lied to me. You think I\u2019ll still believe you! Liar, liar!\u201d Without any skill, he kept a fierce force on her. He stretched her legs as far as they would go, rampaging in and out, pounding into her womb every time, making Moussa\u2019s pussy tremble with pain. She tightened and sloshed water over and over again.\u201cNo! Chelsea. I am not. Deliberately. Ah ah! To lie to you. You listen to me. Ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa was in pain, holding the animal skin beneath her with a death grip. She wanted to explain to him, but Chelsea stimulated her with a deep pounding and moaned loudly.Chelsea waited for her moaning to end. When she was lying helplessly on the bed panting, he sneered and said, \u201cIs it good? It\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it, with all that water coming out.\u201dMoussa no longer had the strength to speak, only lying there whimpering.\u201cI\u2019ll make you feel better,\u201d Chelsea said as he grabbed Moussa\u2019s waist, making her kneel on the bed, with her ass lifted up to provide him with easy access. As he did so, he pushed his middle finger into Moussa\u2019s *sshole and began to thrust.Realizing that he was furious, Moussa relaxed ingratiatingly and let him enter deeper, hoping that satisfying his lust would slightly offset some of his anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She came with a screaming climax and then fell helplessly on the bed.Chelsea withdrew his still hard rod as she climaxed.The number of fingers in her ass increased from one to two. After a few quick thrusts to get her used to it, he used two fingers to spread her ass hole and pushed the huge head inside.Moussa shuddered in pain and unconsciously tightened her *sshole. Chelsea tried a few times but couldn\u2019t squeeze it in.So, he inserted his fingers into her p*ssy, pulled out some nectar, and wiped it into her *sshole for lubrication.He also rubbed his c*ck in her p*ssy to get more nectar before using his hand to shove it again into her *ss.The intense pain brought Moussa back from her climax, and felt something much thicker than a finger trying to squeeze into her *sshole.Sensing what he was trying to do, Moussa started to crawl forward as she cried out in terror.\u201cNo, Chelsea. No, I\u2019ll die. No.\u201dChelsea\u2019s face became even darker as he watched the tip of his c*ck, which had easily squeezed into her *ss, come out again. His anger was great that he pulled the remaining animal straps next to Moussa and flipped her over. Then he grabbed her hands, raised them above her head, and tied them firmly to the bedpost.Then he grabbed her legs and pressed them hard to her chest, tying them to the post, respectively. After that, Moussa\u2019s whole body was pushed into a downed \u2018U\u2019 and couldn\u2019t move.Seeing that she could no longer squirm, Chelsea became satisfied. He parted her buttocks by force and pushed the nectar-filled meat stick into her *sshole.\u201cAh! Chelsea. It hurts. It hurts. Please spare me. Can\u2019t get in. Oooh. Hurts me. Can\u2019t get in.\u00a0 Ah!\u201d\u00a0 Her waist was sore from being folded and, her *sshole was also on fire, being torn hard. These two pains overlapped and made her cry out unbearably.Chelsea simply ignored her cries and pushed the large glans in a little. Then he rotated it back and forth and went it inside. After grinding for a while, he finally inserted the entire glans into it.Then with a hard push on his waist, he inserted a third of the way in amidst Moussa\u2019s wails.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d A stinging pain caused Moussa\u2019s face to whiten. Her cold sweat came out, and she couldn\u2019t say the words to beg for mercy. It was as if one breath could drive the pain even worse in her *sshole. After wailing, she bit her lips to death as if this could relieve her pain. The lower lip was already bleeding from her bite, yet she refused to let go.Chelsea stayed still inside her for a while and felt that she did not tighten up so much. It was only then that he withdrew a little bit. With both hands holding her waist and holding her in place, he pushed hard again. One-third of him went in with a \u201cpoof.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa felt her intestinal wall had been jacked up by him. She passed out of intense pain.Chelsea\u2019s c*ck was wrapped differently from the tightness of her p*ssy. The intense contraction felt like it was going to strangle his c*ck inside. By the time he was about to reach climax, the ultimate pleasure had made him not care if the little person beneath him fainted or not and started thrusting hard.Moussa was awakened by a sharp pain. Her hands were still tied above her head, but her feet had been released.Chelsea was on top of her, panting heavily, looking satisfied after the release.She felt a burning pain underneath her, and her *sshole was still swollen. Something that didn\u2019t belong to her was still stuffed inside.Her *sshole was definitely injured. It was strange for her not to be hurt by his big thing entering so rudely. Moussa suddenly felt so aggrieved. She knew she was wrong. She should have not told him the truth and let him worry to death. It was right for him to be angry with her, but he should not treat her like this even if he was angry.There was no mercy without the slightest sentiment as if she was just a tool for lust. This made her feel very sad.When she first became his partner, he had also treated her like this. She was not as sad as she was now. At that time, she did not have the slightest feeling for him and obeyed him just to survive in this alien world. However, now was different. She had developed something special for him, so she wanted him to give the same response. For him to vent without the slightest feeling like this simply broke her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he found that she was awake, he went over and nibbled on her lips while one hand cupped the softness of her breasts and kneaded them vigorously. The other hand went underneath her and pinched her sensitive little ball of flesh, and pulled it.Moussa was stimulated by his three-pronged approach and involuntarily twisted her waist to avoid. No more than a few moves before she felt the c*ck stuffed in her *sshole slowly hardening again. Moussa was too scared to move again, whimpering and letting him play with it.Chelsea had enough of playing and felt that his c*ck underneath was hard enough. He sat up, held her waist, withdrew a little, and then stabbed it hard. His movements were rough, as if he wanted to pierce her completely and rammed inside her without mercy.Moussa felt her body, again and again, was torn open, closed, torn open again, and closed again. The pain was so terrible that her mind began to go blank, and her body began to tremble nonstop. Moussa bit her lower lip and cried silently. She refused to open her mouth to beg him. Even if she begged him, it might not work. Besides, he was like a beast completely controlled by desire at the moment.Chelsea\u2019s in and out was smoother and faster because of the lubrication of the first cum. He kept pushing Moussa towards the head of the bed, and then he pulled her back, pinned her waist to the bed, and slammed her even harder.The sound of flesh on flesh echoed clearly throughout the room, intermittently resounding with Moussa\u2019s painful whimpers. It stimulated Chelsea more wildly, thrusting furiously. His hard and hot c*ck rubbed violently against her tight and delicate inner walls.After an unknown period, Moussa felt like his ferocious thrusting movements had no end. She was forced to take his huge shaft in her *sshole, and her waist suffered from his violent impact. She was numb to the point of no sensation. Only when he rammed into the depths, the burning and tingling sensation coming from the inner walls make her mouth moan uncontrollably. \u201cAh! Mmmm. Ah!\u201dChelsea was strangled by her tight asshole, and he could not take it any longer. After a dozen more hard strokes of in and out, his body shook violently, and he finally came out.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa was stimulated by his cum. He shot the hot liquid into the depths. She passed out suddenly, unable to bear it anymore.After a moment of panting on top of her, he pulled his softened c*ck out of her asshole. Although he was reluctant, he was afraid that he would really kill her if he came again.Even if it had softened, the c*ck was still huge as soon as it was pulled out of Moussa\u2019s *sshole. There was blood mixed with dirty white fluid that immediately gushed out of the red and swollen hole.Chelsea pulled over the animal skin and wiped the hole. It was already torn by several small cracks. He was afraid that the inside was also torn skin.He wanted to clean and apply medicine for her, but as soon as he thought of her deception, he turned away and ignored her.The next day, Moussa slept until noon. When she opened her eyes, Chelsea was gone, and her body hurt like a car had run over her. This was especially true for a particular part of her body, which was so painful that she wanted to shed tears.She was familiar with this feeling. She had experienced it once before. She had spent a week in bed to recover and everything from last night slowly came back to haunt her. It was sad and upsetting that Chelsea had done that to her. She thought she would be happy with him, but she didn\u2019t expect that it would end in a flash.She was feeling sad when she heard a knock on the door. Moussa was shocked and hurriedly pulled over the animal skin next to her to cover herself tightly. She pursed her lips and kept quiet, hoping that the person outside the door would think that no one was in the house and leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can I come in?\u201d It was Ryan\u2019s voice.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t come in.\u201d Moussa could not move now, and she did not want him to see her in a mess.There was a moment of silence outside the door, and then came Ryan\u2019s gentle voice. \u201cMoussa, I know you are hurt. Don\u2019t be afraid, I can help you. Believe me.\u201d Followed by the sound of the door pushing and entering the room.Moussa closed her eyes in despair. Her tears flowed uncontrollably from the corners of her eyes. It was as if no one could see her sorry state as long as she closed her eyes and could see nothing.Ryan slowly walked to her, putting the pounded herbs he had just picked this morning to the bedside. He reached out his hand to touch her forehead. Thankfully, she did not have a fever and gently wiped away the teardrops at the corners of her eyes. He softly soothed her, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Moussa. Don\u2019t be afraid. I will help you.\u201dAfter saying this, he got up and went to the bathroom to help her boil the bathwater. Then, together with the animal skin on her body, he carried her into the bathroom and put her into the bathtub. He smelled the strong scent of post-mating on her body and knew that she must need to clean up now. She certainly would not want his help, so he took her clothes and herbs and put them aside, then turned around and said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside the door. You can clean yourself. The clothes and medicine I have placed next to you. After you have finished washing and smearing it, then call me. \u201dFrom the beginning to the end, Moussa closed her eyes. When she heard the sound of the door closing, she opened her eyes and looked at the clothes and herbs placed next to her. Her tears flowed uncontrollably, and her heart was filled with gratitude to Ryan. Why couldn\u2019t Chelsea be as gentle and considerate as Ryan?Moussa took a hot bath and felt more comfortable. She carefully applied to the affected area the herbs that Ryan brought. Because the wound was in that place, it was not very convenient to use the medicine. One slight movement caused the injury to be pulled, and it hurt Moussa a lot. Finally finished, she heard Ryan saying outside the door, \u201cMoussa, are you done? I\u2019m coming in.\u201dMoussa hurriedly stood up and answered, \u201cYes.\u201dRyan pushed the door in and gently held her up by the waist, and carried her back to the bed.\u201cThanks.\u201d Moussa pursed her lips, turning her head to the side to say thank you softly. He could bring herbs to see her when she needed help the most. He must have known what Chelsea had done to her. While she did not know how he knew, perhaps she screamed too miserably last night and was overheard by him, thus inferring it.But either way, she was sure he knew, which made her feel embarrassed and unsure how to face him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. It\u2019s all my fault. I saved you in the first place but then failed to protect you properly. I made you get hurt three times. It\u2019s me who should apologize. I\u2019m sorry, Moussa. I\u2019m sorry that I failed to protect you.\u201d Ryan grabbed her hand and said with immense guilt.\u201cNo, no. If you had not saved me, I would have died. Besides, you have saved me several times. I can\u2019t thank you enough. How could I blame you? You have not wronged me.\u201d Moussa did not know that he had such thoughts. She shook her head and explained hurriedly.Ryan looked at her for some time and said with great determination, \u201cMoussa if I say, I\u2026 \u201d Here, he paused.Turning his head to the side, he took a deep breath and then said, \u201cWould you like to\u2026.\u201dBefore finishing, someone outside the house could suddenly be heard approaching at a fast pace. Probably Chelsea came back. He didn\u2019t know why he came back so early today, but he quickly let go of Moussa\u2019s hand and stood up. He didn\u2019t want to start a head-on confrontation with him yet, and he didn\u2019t want to cause Moussa to be misunderstood by him.Moussa was confused by his words. She did not know if he was asking her if she wanted to do something. She was about to ask when she heard the sound of the door being pushed open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The room also smelled faintly of medicine, so he guessed that Ryan had come to bring medicine to Moussa. However, when he thought that she was injured in that kind of place, and he might have helped her with medication, he felt a surge of fire and suppressed it. He asked in a hostile tone, \u201cRyan, why are you back so early? \u201dFrom the corner of his eye, Ryan caught sight of the bloodstains on the animal skin lying on the bed. He was so distressed that he could not kill Chelsea. Ryan also seemed to be holding back his anger and also did not have a bright face, saying, \u201cI came to see if Moussa had recovered, but I did not expect her to be more injured.\u201d\u201cShe is my partner. I will take care of her if she is injured.\u201d Chelsea did not like his tone of unconcealed concern for Moussa. Displeased, he said that.\u201cA responsible male should take good care of his female. How could he let his female get hurt twice? If you can\u2019t take good care of her, then step aside and give a more worthy person a chance.\u201d Hearing that he still refused to admit his mistake, Ryan could no longer suppress his anger and did not care about the consequences. The words in his heart came out in his mouth.\u201cHuh!\u201d Chelsea looked at him and sneered, \u201cTo step aside and give a more worthy person a chance. Don\u2019t even think about it. She is already my partner. She is destined to be my partner only. Even if I mistreat her, she can never leave me. I advise you to mind your own business and go back to your house.\u201d Chelsea clenched his fist and strongly suppressed the fire in his heart. If it were not for the fact that he grew up with him, he would really like to beat him up hard.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ryan was so angry that he could not speak. He clenched his fist and wanted to punch him.\u201cRyan, thank you for bringing the herbs to see me. I have been much better. You go home first.\u201d Moussa looked at the two men who seemed to be fighting with swords. She hurriedly spoke up to stop them.Ryan looked at Moussa. He took a deep breath, forcing down the fire, and nodded to her. \u201cThen you take care of your injuries. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dAfter saying this, he did not even look at Chelsea and slammed the door and went out.After Ryan left, the room immediately became quiet. After some time, Chelsea snorted coldly and stood at the edge of the bed, looking down at her. He mocked, \u201cWhy? Am I not good enough for you? Got your eye on Ryan?\u201dMoussa was sad that Chelsea had treated her like a venting tool last night. She understood that he was probably mad last night and thought she would forgive him if he would apologize to her today.But she didn\u2019t expect to wait for him and talk about her like she was his property. Now that he said that again, Moussa was also furious and said out of turn, \u201cYes, I do fancy Ryan. He\u2019s gentler than you, more considerate than you, more-\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d Moussa had not finished speaking when Chelsea punched the bedboard beside her. The bedboard was broken out by him with a \u2018bang.\u2019\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa screamed in fear. As soon as the scream ended, Chelsea\u2019s cold, hellish voice came to her ears. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to regret it now. You\u2019re already my partner. You\u2019re destined to spend your life only letting me. If you want someone else to f*ck you, unless I\u2019m dead, you won\u2019t be able to do it.\u201d After that, Chelsea also slammed the door and went out.Moussa was left alone on the messy bed, quietly weeping. She did not mean to say that. She was just too angry. How could he be so heartless to her?\u201cAh!\u201d bellowed a miserable cry. Sander became the tenth beastmen to be knocked out.Today, Chelsea was very unusual to gather everyone over to practice hunting skills. Although males often got together to practice hunting skills, he seemed to be too brave today. He had knocked out ten beastmen in a row, and then no one was willing to come forward to compete with him.\u201cLogue, come on.\u201d Chelsea saw no one was willing to go forward to compete with him, so he called out a name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chelsea frowned, a little annoyed.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Amidst the roar of laughter, Ryan parted the crowd and walked out.Chelsea saw that it was him and his anger surged. Without saying a word, both of them took the form of a beast. The white and golden figures become entangled in a battle of roars, the sound of crushing, scratches, and bites. These two, rather than say that the two beasts did not have the slightest skill, they fought only by instinct.The crowd of onlookers also found something wrong. The two beasts did not seem to be in competition rather more like a fight to vent their anger.This was too shocking. The male was more aggressive by nature. Before reaching adulthood, they could not control their temper well, and fights and brawls were common.But Chelsea never bothered to fight with people. He only needed that cold stare, and that unruffled aura was enough to intimidate opponents. Whereas Ryan could be said to be the best male in the tribe because of his gentle nature. He never fought with people. Who would have thought that these two, who never fought, even started fighting after adulthood?The crowd discussed, guessing why they fought, but no one came forward to pull them apart. After all, they feared Chelsea and Ryan\u2019s sharp claws. Even if Ryan was usually quite gentle, if he really fought, it was estimated that no one in the tribe except Chelsea was his opponent.The crowd was nervous and didn\u2019t know what to do when they saw Chelsea\u2019s body prowling around and turning around with a sharp front claw to catch Ryan.Ryan did not dodge to meet him head-on. It appeared that he wanted to come to a dead-end with him. Everyone looked alarmed but could not stop it. They were in a state of anxiety, and suddenly a cloud of powder was raised around the two. As the powder dispersed, they saw that both had been on the ground and could not move.\u201cWhat are you fighting for so long as an adult?\u201d Karida went up to one and kicked him, then laughed and left. He muttered, \u201cStinky Chelsea, who told you to spoil my good time. I will let you want to move, but you can\u2019t budge. Ryan, you can not blame me. Oh! You should blame Chelsea because you are implicated by him. I gave you some paralyzing powder to calm down, hahaha.\u201d\u201cHoo \u2026\u2026\u201d All the beastmen breathed a long one. How could they have forgotten about Karida, who enjoyed sending some paralyzing powder to the two beasts when they fought ferociously to calm down. But they really did not expect him to have the guts to use it on Chelsea and took the opportunity to kick him.He was famous in the tribe for his revenge.Chelsea and Ryan at present have been paralyzed all over. Neither could move, and both were a little embarrassed and did not look at each other. Inside their hearts, they hissed, \u201cKarida, you wait for me.\u201dThe following day, the males got up to hunt, but Chelsea and Ryan were still in the middle of the village on the open space. The beastmen secretly smacked their lips as to how much paralyzing powder Karida used. The two beasts could not move yet. But nobody dared to go up to mess with them. Now both beasts were definitely mad, and it would be too bad if they accidentally became a punching bag. The beastmen took a detour to go out hunting.After some time, the females went out of the village to pick wild fruits. The two beasts were still lying there, and most of the females with partners had heard about the fight between the two. Many were curious last night and sneaked in to see the two beasts and did not think that the two beasts were still lying there after a night. They shouted playfully and gathered around to point their fingers. They were not afraid of Chelsea and Ryan, anyway. The males simply could not hurt them, so they got unscrupulous.In particular, Ivy was the happiest, thinking that her grudge towards Chelsea the other day was finally avenged. She ran happily to Moussa\u2019s house to gossip with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moussa had trouble moving, so she could not get up to cook and had no dinner. Moussa was starving all day, and her body was still suffering. So she was sad and miserable. She kept crying on her bed and ended up sleeping when she was exhausted.She was in bed in the morning when Ivy woke her up. She heard her enthusiastic chatter, and after a long time, she finally understood what had happened.She anxiously asked, \u201cIs Ryan alright? Is he wounded or something?\u201dEven though Ivy was a little confused why Moussa didn\u2019t care if Chelsea was hurt, she first asked Ryan, but she still answered truthfully. \u201cYes, he\u2019s not injured, but now he\u2019s paralyzed and unable to move.\u201dMoussa let go when she heard this and choked back in the middle. Even if she was angry, she could not refrain from asking with concern. \u201cThen Chelsea, is he injured?\u201dIvy shook her head and said, \u201cAlso fine.\u201d Only then did she realize in hindsight that something was wrong.Amazingly, there was a big cracked hole in the bed near Moussa. At first glance, it was fist-sized, and the animal skin on the bed was also bloodstained. A potent sperm odor was also present. Moussa seemed to be wounded as well and could not move, lying there.All these things, coupled with the fact that Chelsea and Ryan fought, followed by Moussa\u2019s concern for Ryan\u2019s injury, made Ivy think of a very absurd story in her mind.Ivy was shocked by her own thoughts. She swallowed hard and asked in a shaky voice, \u201cMoussa, you were not with Ryan when Chelsea saw you, are you?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Moussa was a little confused about what she was talking about.Ivy looked at her disheveled appearance and couldn\u2019t help but yell anxiously, \u201cWas it when Ryan f*cked you and Chelsea saw it?\u201d She could think of no other reason for Chelsea and Ryan to fight, as well as the large hole in the bed and the sperm mixed with blood.\u201cYou. Cough \u2026\u2026\u201d Moussa was shocked to hear that. She was just about to open her mouth to explain when she accidentally choked on her saliva and coughed. When she coughed, the wound on her *sshole was stretched, and she hissed in pain. The pain caused her to gasp.Ivy saw her coughing and gasping, thinking she was weak. The disapproval was very much on her words. \u201cI said, Moussa, oh, how could you do this? Chelsea is so good to you. How dare you betray him? Is Chelsea unable to satisfy you in bed?\u201d Ivy asked suspiciously. But how could Chelsea look very powerful? He didn\u2019t look like he couldn\u2019t do it in bed.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hearing such a thing, Moussa almost choked to death with shame and annoyance and thundered, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Ryan and I are just friends. We did not do anything.\u201d\u201cSo, this is Chelsea\u2019s?\u201d Ivy asked as she frowned, pointing with some disbelief at the remaining traces on the animal skin.Moussa followed her gaze and turned her head to look. With great shame, she pulled over the animal skin full of marks and hid it under her body, giving a few inaudible \u2018en.\u2019\u201cNo,\u201d Ivy exclaimed. She asked, somewhat incredulously, \u201cYou\u2019ve been partners for so long before he touched you?\u201d Then she smiled to herself. She looked just like her when Sander f*cked her for the first time. She couldn\u2019t move and lay in bed for a few days. Thinking about it, it wasn\u2019t right. Moussa had just become Chelsea\u2019s partner when she lay in bed for a week. Chelsea was brave, and she didn\u2019t know that this new, delicate-looking female couldn\u2019t stand him.Moussa howled in her heart. How Ivy asked for the root of the matter made her explain how she had two holes down there. Chelsea only touched the back one, whereas the front one was almost broken by his penetration.Ivy saw Moussa\u2019s face red with shame. She pursed her lips and refused to answer. Although Ivy thought nothing was embarrassing about this kind of thing. On the other hand, Moussa was not willing to say it, so it was fine. So she changed the subject and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with this big hole in the bed? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because Chelsea f*cked you too aggressively and accidentally done it.\u201d\u201cYou \u2026\u201d Although Moussa knew nothing was taboo with the way beastmen spoke, she was still a bit uncomfortable with such a blunt way of asking. She hesitated for a while before stammering, \u201cI made him angry. So he bullied me hard, hurt me, and did not apologize. I was angry, so I said some angry words. He punched a big hole in the bed in anger, and that\u2019s it.\u201dWhat she said was too vague. Ivy thought about it for a while and figured out what was happening but was sure that the two had a fight.Therefore, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to care too much. It is common for partners to quarrel and argue. If you satisfy him in bed, he will definitely be submissive to you. By the way, Chelsea didn\u2019t come back all night. You haven\u2019t eaten yet, right?\u201dAlthough Moussa was furious and did not want to meet him or something, it was useless to mention this to Ivy. She would not understand, and she was indeed a little hungry, so she nodded and said \u201cyes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moussa thanked her and ate without ceremony.Ivy waited for her to finish eating, helped her clean up, and then excused herself to pick wild fruits.Moussa had eaten enough. Looking at the mess on the bed, she felt the sharp pain in her *sshole. The more Moussa thought about it, the more aggrieved Moussa was. She teared up and sobbed again.When Chelsea returned, Moussa hurriedly wiped her tears and turned her head away, pretending to sleep.Chelsea smelled the roasted meat in the house. He guessed that Ivy had just been here and knew she had eaten, so he was relieved.Without saying a word, he picked her up and put her on the bed in the other room.He did not speak, and Moussa ignored him as well, keeping her eyes closed and pretending to sleep.Chelsea looked at her and sighed softly. Then he repaired the broken bed, took out the animal skins ravaged on it, and washed and sun-dried them.After leaving enough food and herbs to stop the pain and bleeding at Moussa\u2019s bedside, he turned around and went out hunting.The rainy season was coming soon. Chelsea had to hunt more prey and store it back to safely survive the rainy season.For the next few days, the two remained in a cold war. Chelsea did not talk to Moussa. Moussa also ignored him. When he went to bed at night, Chelsea tried to take her into his arms, but Moussa broke away and rolled to the corner of the bed with her back to him.Chelsea also turned around with his back to her in anger. The two of them went to sleep with their backs against each other for several days. When Moussa\u2019s injuries were almost healed, and she could move about, she simply moved to another room. Chelsea was so angry that he nearly destroyed all the furniture in the house, but he silently cleaned it up again the next day.He was angry but did not force Moussa to go back and live in one room. Moussa refused to come out of her room when Chelsea came back, causing him to kick in the door and bring her out for dinner.Moussa quickly swallowed a piece of meat and then returned to her room. Chelsea looked at the closed door in front of him. He gnashed his teeth but told himself that she was a fragile female and could not lose his temper with her, which would hurt her. If he hurt her, it would hurt him.The two had been at a standstill until the rainy season was about to arrive. According to the customary practice, every year before the rainy season, every tribe with a serious shortage of females would hold a three-day welcoming party to accommodate the arrival of the tribe with more females, that was, the fox tribe. The welcoming party was full of tricks to make more females stay in the village and spend the rainy season with them. It would give more opportunities to have contact with the females to win their hearts.This year was no exception. Before the rainy season arrived, the people began to prepare for the arrival of the foxes. As the season approached, the village became increasingly bustling, especially for those males who had reached adulthood without a partner or were about to reach maturity. They spent days following males who already had partners to get tips on how to draw the attention of the females.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Beastly HusbandCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Fox tribe\u2019s females arrived as expected. The Fox tribe\u2019s chief brought a total of a dozen females. They set up a big fire in the middle of the village, surrounding it with small fires one after another, on which they roasted all kinds of meat. The males also learned Moussa\u2019s stew and set up a large shell on top of the fire to make one.The females from the Fox tribe, from the same tribe of foxes, came out Logue\u2019s partner, Dees, and Karida\u2019s partner, Laka, was responsible for leading them from fire to fire. They would stop for each fire and let the male show his enthusiasm by presenting his food and gifts to the female he preferred.In this way, the females were fed and received a lot of gifts of rare fruits and rare beasts\u2019 teeth. There were so many different kinds of gifts. Anyway, as long as they could show their physical fitness and skills, the males were excited to do it.The first cycle was the time for the males to express their good feelings to the females. The next was the time for the females to express their good feelings to the males. If the female had a good impression of any male, she could give him the gift he brought, wild fruit or a small flower. If the male accepted the present, the two could become partners and be sent directly to the cave for the mating ceremony! It was fine anyway, as long as she could express her feelings.Typically, very few females would show their affection to the males on the first day unless they had come to the welcoming party before winter and already had a target. Dees and Laka gave all their efforts promoting the benefits of the males of their tribe to the females. They encouraged them to go forward and show their affection.All of a sudden, a female came forward. Shyly pulling Dees\u2019 arm, she asked in a whisper, \u201cDees, how come I haven\u2019t seen Chelsea? Is he not in the village today?\u201d She spent the whole winter in the lion tribe and was very fond of Chelsea. It was a pity that she was not an adult at that time and had planned to meet him at the welcoming party. It was strange that she had walked around but had not seen him.Dees had some difficulty and looked at Laka. She pulled her aside and whispered, \u201cPhilo, in fact, there are many better males than Chelsea in our tribe. You should check them out and learn more.\u201dPhilo asked anxiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Chelsea? Did something happen to him?\u201dDees shook her head and said, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t have an accident, but he already has a partner.\u201dPhilo froze and shook her head incredulously, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. This is impossible. He wasn\u2019t even of age last winter, and we agreed to meet at the welcoming party before the rainy season. He wouldn\u2019t partner with another female.\u201d\u201cPhilo, calm down and listen to me. Ryan suddenly rescued a female from outside this spring. The elders of the tribe said she had the best reproductive ability and could produce the most powerful males and females with the most reproductive capacity. For the sake of breeding the most powerful next-generation, Chelsea was forced to partner with her. Chelsea is also helpless after being forced to do so.\u201d Dees patted her hand comfortingly.Philo was silent for a while and asked quietly, \u201cThe female who can reproduce best, she\u2019s different from us?\u201dDees puffed her lips in the opposite direction and said with disdain, \u201cCheck it out for yourself. The one standing right next to Ivy. The little one has been Chelsea\u2019s partner for so long, but I haven\u2019t seen her picking wild fruit. Instead, she brought in a green python egg, which prompted Ryan to burn down his house. In terms of reproductive capacity and so on, I haven\u2019t heard anything about pregnancy. I guess if there is no news again next spring, the elders should throw her out. If she cannot work and has no reproductive ability, she has been brought up for nothing.\u201dDees was dissatisfied with the elders saying that Moussa had the best breeding ability and so on. As if they, the females, were inferior to her. She complained casually to Philo.However, the person who said it had no intention whatsoever but the person who heard it had the will. Looking at Moussa\u2019s weak appearance, Philo\u2019s dead heart came to life again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Holding a basket of carefully prepared fruit, she slowly walked to Ryan. She said very shyly, \u201cRyan, this is for you.\u201dRyan initially did not want to come to the welcoming party, but the tribesmen dragged him to build a fire because he did not have a partner. He also casually roasted some of the most common meat to deal with the matter. It was surprising that a female came to show her affection for him.If he did not know Moussa and did not fall for her, then perhaps he would accept the female named Mela. Anyway, every female was similar, and who became his partner would be the same. However, now that Moussa was in his heart, he could not resist comparing the female to her.Her skin was not as white or smooth as hers. She smelled differently from Moussa and seemed pretty strong compared to Moussa\u2019s softness when held.He couldn\u2019t accept such a female, especially since he really didn\u2019t want to hold her or f*ck her.\u201cSorry.\u201d Ryan did not take the fruit basket in her hand and was sorry to say.Mela froze at the sound of his voice. Looking at the fruit basket in her hand, she was at a loss, followed by an uproar from the crowd of beastmen. Some males would refuse the females\u2019 goodwill, which happened only once in a hundred years.Mela froze for some time and finally cried out with an embarrassing cry of disbelief. Dees and Laka rushed forward to hug her and softly comforted her. After glaring hard at Ryan, they left with the crying Mela and the females that had no intention of showing their interest.The males complained to Ryan, but Ryan didn\u2019t retort. He only smiled good-naturedly.But at this time, another female was successful. Her chosen male carried her on his shoulder and went to the cave to perform the mating ceremony.The crowd cheered and watched them enter the cave and then scattered.Some curious soon-to-be adults squatted outside others\u2019 windows to watch.Moussa was originally with Ivy to see the event. Still, she did not expect Ivy to pull her to the window to eavesdrop.Together with the eavesdropping beastmen who saw them, they did not seem to feel anything wrong. They had even taken the initiative to give way and let them have the frontest position. Moussa\u2019s face flushed with shame and wanted to break away from Ivy\u2019s hand. However, the clutch was so tight that she couldn\u2019t break free, and she didn\u2019t dare to struggle hard for fear of being heard by the couple in the room, which would be even more embarrassing.In a short time, moans and groans came out of the room. Moussa blushed and lowered her head. She didn\u2019t want to hear it, but the sound was going to her ears, so she had no choice but to listen.Ivy was dissatisfied that she kept her head down. Pulling her up, she whispered in her ear, \u201cHurry up and take a look. You will learn from the female of the Fox tribe. They are imposing in that respect, and you should learn how to use them on Chelsea to make sure he is satisfied with you.\u201dMoussa suddenly felt like her face was on fire. She could not stay any longer and broke away from her and ran home with her face covered. Geez, Ivy actually wanted her to peek at two men in action. While she was curious about how the two men were doing this, but letting her watch, especially with so many people watching together? Oooh, she felt so embarrassed.Moussa ran all the way back to the house. After pushing open the door, she heard voices talking inside and looked up to see Chelsea and a strange beastman in a conversation.Chelsea and the strange beastman fell silent at the same time when they saw her enter.Moussa froze for a moment. This strange beastman should be a female from the Fox tribe. She may not name many of the beastmen in the village, but she still got familiar with them after so many days. She must be from the Fox tribe since she had never seen this beastman before.Out of politeness, Moussa smiled at her and introduced herself, \u201cHello, my name is Moussa.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Philo from the Fox Tribe, and I lived in the village all winter last year.\u201d She then peeked at Chelsea for a moment and said somewhat shyly, \u201cI owe it to Chelsea for taking care of me. Today I brought some fruits to thank him.\u201d While saying that, Philo raised the fruits in her hand.But then she said, \u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t take it. Moussa, please accept it for him, okay?\u201d And she passed them to Moussa\u2019s hand.\u201cOh, thank you then.\u201d Moussa accepted them smoothly.Philo smiled happily when she saw Moussa accepted it. At the same time, Chelsea glared at her fiercely before turning his head away, sulking.Moussa was baffled when he glared at her. This was just fruits, so she took it. It wasn\u2019t anything valuable.When she was thinking it over, Philo came and deliberately took out fruit from the basket and told Moussa, \u201cMoussa, try this. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cHmm, okay, Thanks.\u201d Moussa nonchalantly accepted it and rubbed it on her clothes before taking a bite. Living in this different world, she had been influenced by this unrestrained beastmen without making a fuss. Anyway, pesticides did not exist here, and the fruits were not washed nor dirty.\u201cWell, it\u2019s really yummy.\u201d That fruit was really not the same as those she usually ate. It was very juicy but also had a sweet and sour taste which was very tasty. Moussa could not help but praise it when she got a bite. \u201cThank you, Philo.\u201dHowever, she found that Philo\u2019s expression was a bit stiff after saying that.Moussa looked at the fruit in her hand and wondered if she was not eating it the right way. But the skin of this fruit was very thin, not like the kind you need to peel to eat! However, she found that Philo\u2019s expression was a bit stiff after saying that.Somewhat puzzled, she looked at Philo and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something not right?\u201dThe fruit that Philo specially handed to Moussa was a challenging kind to pick. Being able to pick it was a great honor for a female, and she was expecting Moussa to be amazed. But Philo didn\u2019t expect that Moussa would eat it without saying a thing about it. For a moment, she was a bit overwhelmed by her reaction, and when she heard Moussa\u2019s question, she shook her head a bit awkwardly and said, \u201cNothing. I have to go back, or they would be worried. Moussa, Chelsea, see you tomorrow!\u201d Then she walked out quickly.\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d Moussa waved her hand at her back. She was confused with her sudden departure. Did she do something to frighten her?As she was thinking about it, she heard Chelsea\u2019s low voice saying, \u201cFool.\u201dMoussa looked up and glared at him before walking towards her room with the fruit basket in her arms. She slammed the door shut in front of him and leaned against it, cursing silently at the fruit basket, \u201cYou\u2019re the fool. Chelsea is a big fool and an *sshole.\u201dChelsea stared at it with burning eyes from outside the door that could burn a hole through it.He wanted to drag out the little person behind the door, who had been distracting him all day and shake her awake to ask her what she really wanted.He just took two steps forward and forced himself to stop. He desperately told himself to hold back, not to lose his temper, and not to have a fit with Moussa. She already considered him as not as gentle and considerate as Ryan. If he lost his temper again, what if she really left him and ran to Ryan? There was no history of such a case in the tribe, but the elders of the tribe valued her so much. They might really agree if she proposed to change her partner.Chelsea wanted to kill someone when he thought of Moussa, naked, underneath Ryan\u2019s body, crying and moaning. No, he could not allow Moussa to be with another. No one could be with her. So he had to find a way to make Moussa change her mind about him as soon as possible.Wasn\u2019t it just being gentle and considerate, huh? He didn\u2019t believe he would lose to Ryan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moussa instantly jumped into his arms, crying, \u201cRyan, Ryan, you can\u2019t choose someone else as your partner. Not allowed.\u201dRyan froze for a moment upon hearing this. He then smiled happily and patted her back, saying softly, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Moussa. Don\u2019t cry. I won\u2019t choose anyone else because I only have you in my heart. Are you willing to be with me? We can leave this village together and go live somewhere else.\u201d At last, he asked what he had not spoken about that day.Moussa raised her head to look at him as she nodded in response while weeping. Saying, \u201cI am willing. I am willing.\u201dRyan was so excited that he lowered his head and kissed her lips, which he had longed for. He dragged out her wet, slippery tongue and tasted it in his mouth. It was as sweet as he imagined.As he kissed, Ryan\u2019s breathing became ragged, and he felt a stream of heat going straight to his lower abdomen. Ryan gasped and let her go as he rubbed his already raging hard d*ck against her body, whispering, \u201cMoussa, I want you. Can I?\u201dMoussa shyly nestled into his arms and gave a muffled \u201cmmm.\u201dGetting her permission, Ryan excitedly picked her up by the waist. He gently put her on the bed, then removed her clothes. Ryan tugged off his animal skin skirt and gently pressed down on her. Then he kissed her along her collarbone, moving his palms passionately on her body. It finally moved to her breasts, which made him curious yet hungry for the two full globes. The kneading pressure was exploratory.Feeling her breasts\u2019 soft and bouncy touch, Ryan was excited and wanted to moan out loud. It was so wonderful.He could not help but lower his head and take the red buds of her breasts, licking them carefully.Moussa clung to his muscular body. Her eyes were lost as she whimpered, craving for more.Ryan gradually grew unsatisfied with that kind of touch. The raging hard d*ck beneath him urged him to pound hard.Ryan spread her legs wide open with one hand and felt around. He knew that her body was different from other females in the tribe. The elders explained it to them by pointing to the paintings on the animal skins, but the theory was different from reality. It took him a while to find the hole he could access. To his delight, he pushed his middle finger in with a poof and quickly inserted it.\u201cMmmm!\u201d Moussa grunted in discomfort at the sudden entry of a foreign object. She gasped and murmured, \u201cBe gentle, Ryan.\u201dRyan slowed down the in-and-out speed and felt the pleasure of his finger being wrapped tightly. He wondered how small the hole was that a finger was wrapped around it and how his huge one could be inserted.Then his heart turned sour when he was reminded that Chelsea had already been inside her many times. He was about the same size there as him. Since Chelsea could get in, Ryan must be able to do the same. Thinking of this, he withdrew his finger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He kneaded her breasts with his large hands, and his passionate lips and tongue nibbled at the nape of her neck, murmuring her name, Moussa, Moussa. His voice had turned husky with lust.As he called out again and again, as his passionate call, his d*ck kept pumping faster and faster.\u201cMoussa, are you satisfied? Tell me if you\u2019re feeling good?\u201dThe intense jealousy made him unable to resist exerting more force, to ruthlessly bang hard one at a time inside her tight p*ssy.\u201cAhh. It feels good. It feels good, Ryan. Ah! Gently. Gently. So deep. I\u2019m gonna break inside. You. Ah!\u201d Moussa was rocked back and forth with his thrusting. She threw her head back and moaned loudly.\u201cTell me who is more comforting to you. Me or Chelsea, tell me, tell me!\u201d In contrast to his usual gentle manner, Ryan tightened his hands around her waist and frantically pushed as hard as he could into her p*ssy. It was as if he wanted to break all the way through before he was satisfied.\u201cAh ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa could not bear him and screamed loudly as she clutched the animal skin underneath.

Without further ado, he had her legs spread wider. He vigorously squeezed her buttocks as he charged at full speed.With his crazy thrusts in and out, he was building up more and more pleasure, progressively reaching the peak.\u201cAh!\u201d Ryan roared and shot his load. When he had calmed down a bit, he called her tenderly, \u201cMoussa, baby. You\u2019re so good. I\u2019m so happy.\u201dWhile calling, he turned his head to kiss her. But when he looked at Moussa\u2019s figure, what he was holding tightly in his arms was actually the bundle of animal skin. In disbelief, he looked down and found that his flaccid d*ck was wrapped around the animal skin. The pile was sticky and full of the whitish fluid he shot during his climax.Dismayed, he turned over and lay on his side. He couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly. So this was just his wishful dream. Moussa did not come to him since that day. She could not have cared less if he had chosen someone else as his partner. She had never had him in her heart since the beginning. He should not have given up on her, but he was not reconciled to it. Why did Chelsea treat her like that, yet she preferred to stay by his side and refuse to step towards him? As long as she was willing to step towards him, he would betray Chelsea and the whole village for her and take her to live elsewhere, but \u2026\u2026Ryan was lying in bed with his eyes open, waiting for dawn. Inside, he was tormented. Who could tell him what he should do in the end?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It contained several fruits that she said were delicious yesterday. She picked it up and looked around. Chelsea had gone out hunting, so could it be that he deliberately went to collect it for her, just because she said it was delicious yesterday? Moussa was a little unsure of her guess. Then she remembered that he had called her a fool yesterday and had not given her a good look these days.Moussa was very puzzled by Chelsea\u2019s behavior and did not dare to accept the fruits. She placed the basket on the table and went out to find Ivy to pick wild fruits and herbs.When Ivy and Moussa were about to leave the village, they happened to run into Philo and Mela, who also wanted to pick wild fruits. So the case of two people walking together turned into four people.Moussa recognized Mela as the female whom Ryan had refused yesterday at the welcoming event. However, looking at her today, she appeared to have not yet come out of the shadow of yesterday\u2019s rejection. Keeping the courtesy of not disclosing people\u2019s shortcomings, Moussa and Ivy did not mention yesterday\u2019s incident. They listened to Philo\u2019s enthusiastic questions to Moussa on the way. Moussa was somewhat tired in dealing with the matter. Fortunately, Ivy did not dare to take them too far from the village, so the four of them stopped to start picking wild fruits.Ivy, Philo, and the depressed Mela were of the physically fit type. It was easy for them to climb a tree and pick the fruit.Moussa was scared of the tree\u2019s height and did not bother to climb up the tree. She went to the nearby grass to find some herbs and familiar seedlings to pick.On the way back to the village, Philo was very \u2018kind\u2019 to share what she had picked that Moussa hadn\u2019t. Moussa politely declined because there were only two people at home anyway. Chelsea had already stored enough fruits, and she couldn\u2019t eat them if she took them back.When they heard Moussa say this, Philo and Mela had a flash of contempt in their eyes towards Moussa, but they quickly covered it up.Philo also pretended to be envious and said, \u201cMoussa, Chelsea is really good to you.\u201dMoussa smiled bitterly and didn\u2019t say anything. He was good to her. If that incident had not happened before, she would have believed that Chelsea was not bad to her. However, once Moussa remembered what he did to her, she did not know whether Chelsea was good or bad.Later in the evening, the welcoming event continued as usual. Tonight was even livelier than last night, with the males competing in a two-by-two hunting contest, somewhat similar to a martial arts competition.Chelsea also appeared and watched the competition, but he did not stand by Moussa\u2019s side. Still, he stood in a place with Philo talking and laughing. Ivy felt strange when she saw it. Something must have happened between Chelsea and Moussa. Chelsea was glued to Moussa in the past. She had a tough time because she teased him a few times in the past. It was surprising that Chelsea ignored Moussa today and talked to Philo.It seemed necessary to remind Moussa, so she pulled Moussa a little to whisper, \u201cMoussa, did you and Chelsea quarrel? Why does no one care about anyone?\u201dMoussa\u2019s eyes darkened for a while did not speak. Ivy could not stand the way she looked like, so she reminded, \u201cWell, you know. You should pay more attention to that Philo. Last winter, she lived in the village and had a good relationship with Chelsea. I think she would have become Chelsea\u2019s partner if you had not appeared.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Moussa was surprised that her mouth widened. No wonder she felt that Philo looked at Chelsea differently. It was Chelsea\u2019s ex-girlfriend. No, it was an ex-boyfriend. The appellation was too weird. Forgive her. She really couldn\u2019t imagine a man would be her love rival. Oh God, she thought she had adapted well, but she didn\u2019t expect to be a bit bothered again now.Moussa felt different when she looked again at Chelsea and Philo. It was as if she had seen her husband openly pulling the strings with his ex-girlfriend. She wanted to go up and slap him twice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Through the tribe\u2019s efforts, eight females from the fox tribe, including Philo, were willing to stay through the rainy season. This was the most number of females over the years. There was also a male who had successfully found a partner on the first day of the welcoming event, which was really a cause for celebration.It started to become cloudy and rainy all day. The males did not go out hunting and dug up drains around the village. After happily sending off the fox chief and the rest of the females, the rainy season came in the next two days.While digging a lot of drains, but with the heavy rain, the land still pooled water. The wooden floor of the house had water soaking through, and only then did they see the advantage of Chelsea and Ryan\u2019s house. They had their home built very high from the ground, so the floor did not get soaked. Those beastmen cried out in regret. Why did they not listen to Moussa\u2019s idea of building the house higher from the ground? This would have prevented them from having their house flooded now. Although they previously were this way, it was still enviable to see the two places had dry floors. They all shouted that after the rainy season, their houses must be rebuilt.Philo came to Chelsea suddenly and said pitifully, \u201cChelsea, can I temporarily live in your house? That house arranged for me is flooded past the floor. I have been stepping on it all day, and my feet are soaked. Look.\u201d Saying that she also raised her feet, which had been blistered white, for Chelsea to see to gain sympathy.Chelsea mulled it over. If she came to live at his place, it would be not good. However, if she stayed here, the little thing would have to move back to live in the same bed with him. He hadn\u2019t touched her for a long time, and the thought of it made his blood boil.Seeing that Chelsea was hesitant, Philo begged again, \u201cChelsea, please. There are two rooms in your house. I\u2019ll just stay in that one, and I promise not to disturb you and Moussa.\u201dChelsea finally nodded and said, \u201cAll right then. You can go pack your things and move over here later.\u201dPhilo nodded happily and ran back to pack up her things.Moussa, who had been trying to sew a cloak with the animal skin in her room, heard their conversation clearly. She was so angry that her body shivered. She was so damned mad.In her original world, she was betrayed by her fianc\u00e9 and best friend. When she came to this different world, she had to watch her husband, a beastman, flirting with a man in her home? This male mistress was too arrogant to enter the house, and the b*stard Chelsea said yes.Moussa felt a sudden tightness in her chest as if she could not catch her breath. So she put on her waterproof animal skin boots and opened the door to rush out.Seeing Moussa rushing out with a bad countenance, Chelsea was startled and rushed out after her. He breathed a sigh of relief only then when he saw her running into Ivy\u2019s house and returned to their house to move all of Moussa\u2019s things back to their room.Ivy and Sander were having a good time when they saw Moussa suddenly rushing in crying. Ivy hurriedly pushed Sander away and pulled Moussa over to ask worriedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d At the same time, she pulled a piece of animal skin to help her wipe the rain on her body.Moussa originally planned to find Ivy to talk to. After all, the only people who were good to her in this different world were her and Ryan. Ryan hadn\u2019t come to her since that day, and she hadn\u2019t taken the initiative to find him. For all intents and purposes, it was still a little awkward to see him again.But when she came to Ivy\u2019s place and saw that Sander was there, she couldn\u2019t say anything out loud, so she lowered her head and sobbed.Ivy noticed that she was uncomfortable and gave Sander a wink to shoo him away.When Sander went out, Ivy then eagerly asked, \u201cWell, now it\u2019s just the two of us. You hurry up and tell me what\u2019s wrong with you. All this crying and not saying anything is killing me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She skipped the part about Ryan. After all, the matter was between her and Chelsea, and she didn\u2019t want to involve Ryan.After hearing this, Ivy frowned in disapproval and said, \u201cMoussa, this time, you really did a little too much. You know, when Chelsea was very young, his parents were out on a trip and accidentally ran into a large-scale beast attack. Both were wounded and managed to escape back to the village. I did not know where the injuries were, but it was hard to stop the bleeding, and it kept flowing without stopping. And thus died within two days. The villagers helped him grow up.From then on, he has been afraid of seeing bleeding. The way you lied to him, he must have gotten angry at you and hurt you. He is definitely regretting it now, but he just can\u2019t find the face to apologize to you. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have let you fool around and get what separation. I tell you, the males\u2019 desire is extreme all the time. In this case, he must have been suffering a lot by not letting him touch you all day long. That fox is taking advantage of it. I think the fox has not given up on Chelsea. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be trying to live in your house. You have to hurry back, make peace with Chelsea, and then take him to bed where he can eat his fill. Make that stinky fox watch.\u201d Ivy said as she pushed Moussa out.Moussa was still a little disoriented when Ivy pushed her out. The cold rain outside suddenly sobered her up a bit.She really did not expect Chelsea\u2019s life would be so tragic. Although she also grew up without parents, he witnessed his parents bleeding to death. He must have suffered more than she did. With this in mind, she was not angry with Chelsea anymore but felt hurt for him. But heartbreaks were heartbreaks, but a lesson should be taught. He even blatantly brought his ex-boyfriend home, so no matter what, he had to be taught a lesson.So Moussa first went to Karida to ask for some things before going home.As soon as she entered the door, she saw Chelsea and Philo were cooking dinner. One person handed, and one received with quite a tacit understanding. Moussa felt sour at heart as she thought about it.When Philo saw that Moussa was back, she greeted her warmly, \u201cMoussa, you\u2019re back! Hang on a minute. We\u2019ll eat soon.\u201dMoussa said, \u201cOh,\u201d indicating that she knew, and then turned around. She muttered in a dissatisfied voice, \u201cShameless, not even thinking of who is the master of this house.\u201dAlthough Moussa\u2019s voice was small, Chelsea\u2019s excellent hearing could hear it clearly. The undisguised jealousy in her tone made Chelsea tug the corners of his lips. Looking at her dripping wet, he was afraid she would catch a cold and get sick, so he left the dinner to Philo alone and turned to the bathroom to boil bath water for Moussa.Moussa went back to their room and grabbed a change of clothes to take a bath and wash her hair in the bathroom. She just pushed open the bathroom door and saw Chelsea squatting there boiling water. She frowned in confusion if he was helping her boil the bathwater.He had been putting some strange fruits on her doorstep every morning for the past few days, and now he was helping her boil the bathwater. Was this another attempt to make peace with her? But he still wouldn\u2019t talk to her, and it didn\u2019t seem like he was trying to make peace with her. This confused Moussa.When Chelsea saw her come in, he stood up awkwardly and touched the temperature of the water. When he felt it was almost right, he extinguished the fire and poured the hot water into the tub. Then, without speaking, he turned around and went out.Moussa stared at the door and waited for someone to come back in. She figured it should be for her, so she took off her clothes and took a hot bath comfortably.After she had washed and gone out, Chelsea and Philo had already prepared dinner. When Philo saw her come out, she greeted her enthusiastically to come over for dinner.Moussa was displeased that she acted as if she was the master of the house and she was a guest. She couldn\u2019t attack her on the spot, but she wouldn\u2019t let her get too carried away.Moussa walked to Chelsea\u2019s side and sat down. Chelsea was surprised that she was willing to sit so close to him and happily cut a piece of meat and put it in her bowl. So she smiled lightly and nodded.Moussa moved closer to him and took his arm, saying, \u201cDear, can you help me cut it into small pieces? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll choke if it\u2019s too big.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A look of surprise flashed in his eyes when she called him \u2018dear\u2019 for the first time. It seemed that he had done the right thing by letting Philo live in the house.Then, he quickly and diligently helped her cut the meat in the bowl into small pieces and then picked up a bit and fed it to her. Moussa smiled, ate it, and reciprocated by picking up a piece and serving it to Chelsea.Philo watched the two fed each other so sweetly. She was jealous and was not in the mood to enjoy the delicious food in the bowl. After a few quick bites, she said she was full and went back to her room.When Moussa saw her leave, she was not in the mood to perform any affection. She took her bowl and stood up to sit at the farthest position from him. She didn\u2019t even look at him and lowered her head to eat her dinner.When she suddenly became cold again, Chelsea realized that she had just intentionally cozied up to him to get on Philo\u2019s nerves. He thought she was so enthusiastic about him because she was afraid he would be taken away from her.He could not help but glare at her. Moussa did not care whether he was glaring at her or not. She was eating as she pleased and was thinking about how to fix him tonight.The two finished eating after a while. Chelsea got up and simply tidied things up. Seeing her dilly-dallying without the intention of going to bed, Chelsea was anxious. Looking at the sky getting dark, he thought he could hug Moussa soon and was really itching to do so. Yet, he did not dare to rush for fear of upsetting her. The only choice was to lie down on the bed first and pretend to sleep.After waiting for a while with his eyes closed, he finally waited until Moussa slowly climbed and curled up on the other side of the bed, far away from him.Chelsea chuckled secretly and hooked her into his arms with one big hand.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa was about to scream with her mouth open when Chelsea kissed her, swallowing all her screams into her stomach.After a long time of hunger, Chelsea once again kissed the lips he had longed for and immediately felt his body was hot and unbearable. Something underneath him was instantly swollen and stiff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he was about to get his way, Moussa was distraught. So her small hand went down and grabbed his hardness resting on her waist and held it hard.\u201cMmm \u2026\u2026\u201d Chelsea muffled a grunt. Moussa kept up her efforts on his huge hardness, and she felt his pressure on her weaken.So she whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t press on me. I want to be on top.\u201dWhen Chelsea saw that she didn\u2019t refuse his advances and even used her small hand to actively work on his hardness, he moaned in comfort. Hearing her say she wanted to be on top, he didn\u2019t think twice before rolling over with her and letting her sit on top of him.She grinned. As Moussa sped up her hand\u2019s pace in pleasing him, she took out the powder she had just hidden under the animal skin, which she had asked for from Karida. The powder was in a small pouch made of animal skin. Then, she held her breath as she opened it with one hand and sprinkled it on Chelsea when he was panting with his mouth open in comfort.Chelsea was unprepared and breathed in a reasonable amount. By the time he realized something was wrong and had to hold his breath, his body had already started to go numb, and he couldn\u2019t move.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Moussa unexpectedly used paralyzing powder on him. Chelsea was shocked and stared at Moussa with some incredulity as he asked. But even his tongue began to be disobedient.Moussa ignored him. After making sure he really couldn\u2019t move his body, she got up to open the doors and windows. Then she covered her mouth and nose with one hand and cleaned up the powder on the bed with the water-soaked animal skin with the other. She did not want to accidentally touch the powder left behind, making herself unable to move.After Moussa finished cleaning up everything, she closed the window again. Then she climbed on the bed, pressed on top of him, lowered her head, and nibbled on his lips. Her hands didn\u2019t stay idle, playing with the sensitive two points on his chest with one hand.\u201cMmmm.\u201d Chelsea could feel an electric current hitting his lower abdomen, and his swollen hardness became even more unbearable. He wanted to roll over and crush her underneath him, rushing ruthlessly into her tight p*ssy. However, he could only stare at her with his eyes burning.Moussa was amused by the impatient expression on his face. She sat upon his belly and gently rubbed her buttocks against his hardness, asking mischievously, \u201cIt\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it? You want to get in, don\u2019t you?\u201dChelsea was going crazy with her torture but couldn\u2019t make any sound. He could only express his longing with burning eyes and whimpering sounds like a trapped animal.\u201cOh yeah, I forgot you can\u2019t talk right now.\u201d Moussa gloated and laughed, \u201cHow about this. I\u2019ll ask you a question. If it\u2019s an affirmative answer, you blink twice. If not, blink once. If you answer to my satisfaction, maybe I\u2019ll make you feel good. You hear me?\u201d She said and deliberately put her hand behind her back and bounced it on his hardness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only wished that she would give him a good time.Seeing how cooperative he was, Moussa leaned down and kissed him on the lips, praising, \u201cSuch a good boy.\u201d\u201cOooh.\u201d Chelsea made a complex nasal sound urging her to hurry up. He was about to explode from holding it in.Moussa coughed and said sternly, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t like Philo living here. You\u2019ll have her move out tomorrow, do you agree?\u201dChelsea blinked twice again without thinking. Philo or whatever was now totally out of his consideration.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good.\u201d Moussa nodded in satisfaction and then said, \u201cIn the future, you are not allowed to see Philo alone, nor a talk to her, nor smile at her.\u201d After some thought, she added, \u201cNo other females are allowed either. You can only have one partner in this life, do you agree?\u201dChelsea blinked twice more and made a nasal \u201cmmmm\u201d sound. He couldn\u2019t stand how she had so many questions.Moussa slapped him on the face and snapped, \u201cWhat are you yelling about? Answer the question properly, or you\u2019ll be ready to stay here all night.\u201dA night like this? He might die of pain in that case. Chelsea blinked his eyes quickly to say no.Moussa ignored him. After a moment\u2019s reflection, she said apologetically, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to lie to you about the bleeding. I\u2019m sorry, will you accept my apology?\u201d\u201cAccept, accept. Just please do me a favor\u201d, Chelsea hissed in his heart and hurriedly blinked twice.Moussa was relieved to see his acceptance and then said, \u201cThen you can\u2019t be mean to me in the future. You can\u2019t hurt me anymore. Also, when we do something like that, if I say no, you can\u2019t do it either. You have to stop right away, do you promise?\u201dHe could promise not to be mean and not to hurt her, but if she said no, he would have to stop. If she said no every time, wouldn\u2019t he have to stop every time he got halfway through? Chelsea had a lot to say about this one.When Moussa saw that he was hesitant about it, she reached behind her again and grabbed his stiffness, threatening, \u201cPromise or not?\u201dYes, yes, Chelsea immediately blinked twice. Yes was a yes. As for whether to do it or not, that would depend on the situation.\u201cHmm.\u201d Moussa nodded in satisfaction, and only then did she notice that he was sweating profusely and looked like he was having a hard time holding back.When she felt the hardness and swelling in her hand, she couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201cIt\u2019s really not good to be hard like this.\u201d The thought made her feel distressed.Therefore, she obediently raised her waist, and her little hand grasped his hardness and sent it to her p*ssy.\u201cOooh.\u201d Chelsea was excited to see that she was willing to give him a good deal of pleasure and whimpered.\u201cMmmm. So good,\u201d Moussa aligned his huge tip to her p*ssy and then slowly sat down. However, after spending some time on the job, she only swallowed a third of it. Moussa was uncomfortable and complained. So she lay on top of him and refused to move anymore.\u201cOooh.\u201d Chelsea was stuck there with her not getting enough. It was also uncomfortably tight. He really hated this feeling of weakness and could only whimper and urge her to hurry up.\u201cI know, I know. Taking a break!\u201d Although Moussa said so, she still pushed to sit down slowly until she reached the opening of her womb. Although part of his d*ck remained outside, she refused to go down at all.After panting, she twisted her waist and began to move up and down in small increments.Although Chelsea was not satisfied with her slow movement, he could not move now and had to endure the growing fire of desire due to her slow grinding pace.\u201cAh ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa rode a wooden horse-like for a while, and somehow her body\u2019s most sensitive point was rubbed hard. Moussa was stimulated by the intense sensation. She threw back her head and let out a long moan as she clenched herself to climax.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Another stream of hot fluid washed over Chelsea\u2019s rock-hard d*ck, and her convulsing inner walls tightened around him like a million little mouths sucking.Chelsea\u2019s heart was itching to get underneath her. He couldn\u2019t wait to get her underneath him and thrust her hard, and f*ck her p*ssy through and through.But he couldn\u2019t do anything right now. His d*ck, wrapped tightly around Moussa\u2019s, was swollen and starting to hurt.\u201cOooh.\u201d Chelsea urged her to move faster. He hadn\u2019t come out once yet, and he was about to explode.However, Moussa was too tired to move. She raised her waist and guided his still up-standing member out. Then Moussa pulled up one of his arms and laid down in a comfortable position. She nuzzled against him and closed her eyes.\u201cMmm. Mmm. Oooo.\u201d Chelsea saw that she had actually gotten his c*ck out, leaving him alone. He let out another \u201coooh\u201d nasal sound in agitation.\u201cBe good. Be quiet.\u201d Moussa closed her eyes and patted him soothingly on the chest, muttering, \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. Let me rest first before I do it.\u201d And then she fell asleep.\u201cOooh.\u201d Listening to her even breathing, he knew she was asleep. Chelsea wanted to cry. She did it on purpose. On purpose to fix him! Oh Lord, he was so uncomfortable that she left him alone to sleep.\u201cLittle thing, you wait for me. When I can move, see how I clean you up.\u201d Chelsea vowed in his heart that when he could move, he would have to torment her for three days and three nights.He had his bloodshot eyes open, and his crotch was swollen to the point of uncomfortable hardness until sunrise.\u201cHmm.\u201d Moussa comfortably slept. She woke up, stretched, and suddenly her arm was blocked by an unknown object.Moussa turned her head to see that it was Chelsea. So everything from last night slowly came crashing into her.Seeing that his crotch was still erect and his red eyes shone murderously, she screamed crap. She didn\u2019t even satisfy him last night and fell asleep. For sure, he suffered a lot from that night. Oops! She had no idea if he could move, would he strangle her?After thinking about it, the more scared Moussa was. She hurriedly got up, dressed carelessly, put on her animal skin boots, and fled in a flash.\u201cIvy, help! Help!\u201d Moussa shouted and rushed into Ivy\u2019s house. She happened to see Ivy and Sander both panicking around the animal skin skirt.Moussa guessed that she had probably interrupted someone\u2019s good deed. Moussa blushed, turned around, and wanted to go out. But she had just taken a step out when Ivy pulled her back and asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Directly shouting for help.\u201d\u201cThat. Um \u2026\u2026\u201d Moussa opened her mouth and did not know how to continue. The absurdity of what she did last night really made her unable to talk about it. A moment ago, Moussa was so scared that she did not even think about it and ran to Ivy. But how in the end was she going to tell her?\u201cHey, tell me. It\u2019s killing me.\u201d Ivy saw her start stammering again and stomped her feet.\u201cThat, that \u2026\u2026 Chelsea is going to kill me. Is there anywhere I can hide for a while?\u201d Moussa said \u2018that\u2019 and finally came up with a whole sentence without a clear picture.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ivy and Sander were both taken aback. They looked at each other in disbelief.Secretly, they prayed, \u201cWhat did she do to make Chelsea want to kill her. Did she really\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on, hurry up.\u201d Moussa saw that the two were dumbfounded and did not speak. She urged anxiously. Karida said that the paralyzing effect could only last until the morning. The day had been bright for a while, and the impact of the medicine might have been over. Once Chelsea could move, she was dead.\u201cOkay, okay, okay. Take it easy. Let me think about it.\u201d Seeing that she was really in a hurry, Ivy patted her shoulder and comforted her. Then she frowned and thought about where Chelsea couldn\u2019t find her. But all the beastmen\u2019s sense of smell was very sensitive. If Chelsea was sincere about finding someone, how could there be a place where he couldn\u2019t find her? Unless she hid in another beastman\u2019s place, but that would be too dangerous. Moussa was a female and could be eaten at any time.Ivy thought for a while and had not thought of a good place. Moussa was anxiously going around the room. Sander, who had not spoken, suddenly put his arm around Ivy and said, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. It\u2019s too late.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What to do? Ivy, help me.\u201d Moussa was so anxious that she grabbed Ivy\u2019s arm, shaking it hard.\u201cThe cabinet, the cabinet. You first hide inside the cabinet.\u201d Ivy knew that hiding in the cabinet was only self-delusion. But she was going to throw up if she shook her again, so she casually pointed out a place for her to go.\u201cOh.\u201d Moussa did not think and followed Ivy\u2019s instructions. With no more than three steps, she ran over and climbed into the cabinet to hide.Moussa had just hidden when she heard the sound of \u2018!\u2019 Chelsea broke through the door.He didn\u2019t even look at Ivy and Sander for a second. Then he walked straight to the cabinet, pulled open the door, reached out, and grabbed Moussa, who was scared silly. He carried her over his shoulder and headed out.\u201cAh! Ivy, help!\u201d Moussa returned to her senses and began to struggle and scream.\u201cShut up,\u201d Chelsea said through gritted teeth as he gave her a slap on her small buttocks.\u201cMmm,\u201d Moussa\u2019s buttocks were in pain, but she really did not dare to scream.Chelsea paused at the door and turned to Sander, who was still a bit confused and said coldly, \u201cSander, take care of your partner. I\u2019ll settle this score with you.\u201d After saying this, he carried Moussa and walked out quickly.Yesterday, he thought that Moussa used paralyzing powder on him because Ivy had taught her. Although he could not do anything to Ivy, he would get it back on his partner.\u201cEr,\u201d Sander froze and looked at Ivy in confusion.Ivy hurriedly clarified, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I don\u2019t know anything. I haven\u2019t done anything bad.\u201d Goodness, she was wronged! Yesterday, she persuaded Moussa to make up with Chelsea. If Chelsea didn\u2019t appreciate her, how come he had to find Sander to settle the score with him in the end. What did Moussa do?Sander did not quite believe her and said, \u201cYou did not do anything. Chelsea will let me take good care of you and also find me to settle scores. I don\u2019t care. He wants to clean me up. I\u2019ll get it back on you first, and you won\u2019t get out of bed today.\u201d And with that, Sander pounced on her viciously.\u201cDon\u2019t! Listen to me.\u201d Ivy felt she was really wrong as she tried to explain to Sander while avoiding him.But Sander simply refused to listen and directly pounced her on the bed. He ripped the animal skin skirt from his body and kissed her fiercely. In a short while, Ivy could only let out a moan of ahhhhhh.Ivy\u2019s side was aggrieved, and Moussa\u2019s side was not easy either. Being carried on Chelsea\u2019s shoulders, she was on the verge of vomiting and was afraid that he would take care of her at home. Therefore, her eyes were red, and she softly begged for mercy, \u201cChelsea, I was wrong. I was wrong. Put me down quickly. I\u2019m going to vomit.\u201dChelsea ignored her pleas and carried her into the house. He threw her gently onto the bed and then pounced on her, tearing her clothes and kissing her hungrily.\u201cChelsea, don\u2019t. Don\u2019t tear my clothes. Listen to me.\u201d Moussa avoided his kisses while turning her head and protecting her clothes.\u00a0 Although she did not resist his advances, it was now daylight, and Philo was still in the room.The thought of Philo made Moussa uncomfortable, and she slapped the hand that was rubbing her breasts and snarled, \u201cPhilo is still here. You promised me that she would move out.\u201dChelsea only wanted to put his swollen, and uncomfortable d*ck into her p*ssy and have a good ride. He had no time to think about other things. \u201cYou have to satisfy me first.\u201d He said as he forced her legs apart, pushing his long, slender fingers into her p*ssy and pumping up quickly.\u201cHm,\u201d Moussa muffled a grunt from his poking while twisting her waist, trying to squeeze the foreign object out of her p*ssy while threatening, \u201cYou take it out. If you touch me now, I\u2019ll \u2026 won\u2019t care about you anymore.\u201d After thinking about it, she added, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I say.\u201dChelsea was shocked to hear that he had stopped moving his hand. Although he could have ignored her threat and forced her, along with his bulge underneath urging him to do so, he could not stand to do anything. These days, she refused to pay attention to him, and it really made him uncomfortable.After hesitating, he finally compromised and pulled his finger out, saying with hatred, \u201cLittle thing, you are so annoying.\u201d While saying this, he kissed her lips, dragged out her little tongue, and nibbled on it. He waited until she was about to suffocate before releasing her. Then he took a new dress and threw it at her.After she was dressed, he pulled her and went to gather a few males without partners. Braving the rain, he would give a high house off the ground for those fox females who lived temporarily in the village.Chelsea kept Moussa standing at the door of a beastman\u2019s house to shelter from the rain. He could not leave her sight for fear that she would take the opportunity to run away.The house was soon built. Chelsea immediately asked people to help move Philo and other females\u2019 things in.In this case, Philo had no reason to stay in Chelsea\u2019s house. Reluctantly, she moved into the new house. When she left, she pretended to thank Moussa.Moussa was trembling with fear thinking about how to deal with Chelsea later. After a couple of perfunctory remarks, she did not have the energy to pay attention to her provocations and was pulled home by Chelsea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He lowered his head and kissed her fiercely. His tongue pried open her teeth and swirled around in her mouth, dragging out her tongue and sucking it hard.His hands were not idle as well. With a bit of effort, he destroyed another piece of Moussa\u2019s clothing. Then one hand wrapped around her waist, and one hand went down to squeeze between her legs. When he reached the entrance to her p*ssy, he inserted a finger and quickly pumped it up.\u201cMmm,\u201d Moussa\u2019s lips were blocked by him. A burst of tingling from beneath her body made her involuntarily soften, and her whole body fell on top of him, whimpering.Chelsea could not stand it any longer and pulled his fingers out of her p*ssy. Pulling her legs apart, he held his shaft and pushed it in hard. Then he had her hips and lifted her upward.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa was not wet enough yet. She screamed in pain as he pushed in so eagerly that her p*ssy tightened up even more.\u201cMmm.\u201d Chelsea did not go all the way at that time. He couldn\u2019t move because of her tightness, and it hurt a bit. So he kneaded her buttocks, trying to make her relax while taking her earlobe and coaxing in a low voice, \u201cBaby, relax. Let me go all the way in.\u201dMoussa was actually also pained that he had a hard time holding it in. She just couldn\u2019t stand his eagerness. But now, it was impossible to get him to take it out, so Moussa had to strike him on his chest to relieve her anger. Then she relaxed and let him enter all the way.Chelsea felt she was not that tight anymore. Only then did he withdraw his stick a little and then thrust it forward with a \u2018poof\u2019 to the end.\u201cAh!\u201d Although she was mentally prepared, the feeling of being filled instantly still made Moussa involuntarily scream out.Chelsea seemed rational at the moment. Remembering that he promised not to hurt her, he did not penetrate her cervix. He stopped only at the deepest part of her p*ssy, then withdrew and pushed in again.However, Moussa was still slammed repeatedly against the door panel behind her by his intense strength. The entire of her back rubbed painfully throughout.\u201cChelsea. Back to bed. My back hurts. Mmm.\u201d Moussa did not know how many times he had to do it today before he could be satisfied. So she had to find herself a relatively comfortable place, or else she would be aching all over in the morning.Chelsea obediently carried her back to the bed, then resumed his efforts on her. He was fast in his thrusting.Chelsea had been hungry for a long time and controlled his strength. He could not take advantage of the situation and felt that he could not enjoy the warm and gentle action. He stopped moving for a moment and looked at her, and said, \u201cWife, I am not comfortable like this.\u201dMoussa gave him a blank expression. She knew that his nature would be difficult to change. It would not be natural to become gentle and considerate. However, she was delighted that he was willing to submit himself for her for so many days. He also knew to seek her opinion first.\u00a0 \u00a0 She took a deep breath, tried to relax, and closed her eyes. She said resignedly, \u201cDo what you want.\u201dChelsea was happy to hear that. He lowered his head and gave her a kiss on the lips, praising, \u201cBaby, you\u2019re so good.\u201d After saying that, he lifted one of her legs upon his shoulder. Then he slammed his hard stick, which was in Moussa\u2019s p*ssy, into her cervix as hard as he could.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d The sharp pain of having her cervix opened made Moussa scream as she threw her head back.Chelsea was unable to think straight because of the tightness inside of her. He withdrew his stick and entered again vigorously. His mouth was full of naughty words that made Moussa even more ashamed. \u201cYou\u2019re so tight, baby. Your p*ssy is so tight, I want to f*ck you through and tear you apart. Are you satisfied? Do you feel good when I do this?\u201d\u201cAh! Ah!\u201d Chelsea was totally wild. He couldn\u2019t care less about showing mercy and was ramming inside Moussa on instinct. Moussa couldn\u2019t keep up with his rhythm and was out of breath. He forced her to say those shameful words and tossed her even harder if she didn\u2019t.Moussa continuously withstood his relentless impact. She cried out and moaned helplessly. After gradually getting used to his roughness, the pain was overwhelmed by more intense pleasure. She involuntarily yielded to him and let him have his way.\u201cBeg me to break you! F*ck you through,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s eyes went scarlet as he stared down at the little person he was f*cking who was crying and writhing seductively.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa was knocked out of her senses by the giant pestle in her p*ssy. She cried out submissively, \u201cIt\u2019s so good! Ah! Chelsea, please break me! F*ck me to death! Ahhhhhh! So deep. Gently. Ah!\u201d\u201cLittle thing, I\u2019ll f*ck you through and through!\u201d Chelsea was finally satisfied. He fastened his grip on her thin waist and accelerated the speed of his impaling. After a relentless pounding, Chelsea plunged his stick, which had grown another size, hard into her p*ssy. He rammed the whole length of his flesh into the cervix. He roared and came blasting out.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa shuddered and climaxed due to the burning passion he shot inside her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wrapped his arms around Moussa and placed his hands on her waist to massage her. It took him a while to finally say, \u201cMoussa.\u201dMoussa was nestled in his arms drowsily when she suddenly heard him call her. She answered in a daze, \u201cHmm?\u201dThere was no response. Moussa looked up at him curiously and saw that he was frowning. She didn\u2019t know what he was thinking about. Moussa was a bit surprised that he had been hungry for so long, but he had stopped just once and was thinking about something. Was there something big going on?Moussa was alarmed and asked with concern, \u201cChelsea, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dChelsea\u2019s eyes flickered. Somewhat defeated, he looked away and stammered, \u201cI really can\u2019t seem to be. As. Gentle and considerate as. Him. Will you. En. Dislike me?\u201dMoussa did not hold back a \u2018pfft\u2019 out of happiness. She did not expect him to care about this matter. Deliberately, she teased him, \u201cWill.\u201dWhen he heard that, Chelsea snapped his head around and glared at her fiercely. He roared in anger, \u201cIt\u2019s too late for you to dislike me. You are destined to be my only partner.\u201dMoussa saw his angry look but did not feel afraid. On the contrary, she found it quite cute. Moussa pulled down his neck and kissed him on the lips. She laughed lightly and said, \u201cCome on, husband. Don\u2019t be angry at me. What I said the other day was just an angry remark. While you are not as gentle and considerate as Ryan, you have your own merits. You are more handsome than him, braver than him, and better than him\u2026..\u201dMoussa paused. Well, forgive her. She racked her brains and couldn\u2019t think of anything that this rude beastman had better than Ryan. If she said cute, she could guarantee that Chelsea would instantly toss her back. She had learned a lot about his temper. In fact, she could easily say something about his shortcomings if she did.\u201cBetter than him at what?\u201d She was complimenting him, but she didn\u2019t say anything, and then suddenly she stopped talking about him. Did he only have two advantages? Chelsea urged, unsatisfied.\u201cOh, anyway, you are in my heart that everything is better than him.\u201d Moussa praised against her heart. Fearing that he would continue asking questions, she hurriedly changed the subject. She said, \u201ceven if you are not as good as him in everything, you are my husband. I will not dislike you. Just like how I am not as tall, strong, and good as picking wild fruits like Ivy. Will you dislike me?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Chelsea nodded. A face that was indeed so. Moussa saw that he finally understood. She thought she was done and went back into his arms.Just when she got down, she heard Chelsea saying with regret, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t told me, I wouldn\u2019t have realized that you\u2019re not as tall as Ivy, nor as strong as Ivy, nor as good at picking wild fruits as she is. So, do you consider it a big loss for me, the tribe chief, to find a partner like you?\u201d She dared to say that he was inferior to Ryan in all aspects. He was furious, but he understood what she meant, and his anxious heart finally settled down.\u201cEh?\u201d Moussa sniffed and bit him hard on the chest. She looked up at Chelsea\u2019s \u2018hissing\u2019 gasp. She gritted her teeth and mimicked his tone by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too late for you to dislike me. You\u2019re destined to be my only partner.\u201d Chelsea looked at her tiny teeth and claws. He was tickled, rolled over, and pinned her underneath. Then he lowered his head to kiss her.Moussa opened her mouth and bit him hard on the lips, retorting, \u201cDon\u2019t kiss me if you don\u2019t like me!\u201dChelsea \u2018pfft\u2019 out and quickly kissed her a few more times, causing her to look at him angrily. Then he coaxed in a low voice, \u201cBaby, wife, how can I dislike you? The forest gods gave me a treasure. I like it too much to dislike it.\u201d\u201cHum,\u201d hearing him say so, Moussa\u2019s heart felt sweet. But her mouth still refused to spare him and said, \u201cWho knows whether you really mean it or not. I heard that last winter, you and that female named Philo was very close. I heard that if I had not appeared, you would have chosen that female as your partner. Was there such a thing?\u201d\u201cThis,\u201d Chelsea was a little dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t expect her to ask this question out of the blue. He was a little embarrassed to say, \u201cYou hadn\u2019t shown up yet. If you had, I promise I would have chosen you. \u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I remember when you were forced by the elders to become my partner. You bullied me all the time in the beginning and didn\u2019t give me a favorable attitude. I remember it clearly and don\u2019t try to deny it.\u201d Moussa suddenly remembered the past. The more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she was. The more Moussa thought about it, the angrier Moussa was. Her eyes reddened as she spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did she bring this up again? He was really reluctant to partner with the weak-looking her at that time. Had he known that he would care about her so much one day, he would not have said anything to her at that time.Seeing that Moussa was about to cry again, Chelsea was a bit distressed and softly coaxed, \u201cBaby, it\u2019s all my fault. It\u2019s my fault. Don\u2019t be angry. I won\u2019t bully you in the future. Be good, don\u2019t cry!\u201dMoussa also felt it was not fascinating to rehash old debts, but coaxing her in such a low voice was rare. Therefore, she pretended, \u201cNo bullying me in the future.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. I won\u2019t bully you.\u201d Chelsea nodded in response. In his heart, he secretly added that bullying in bed did not count.\u201cFrom now on, you have to listen to me on everything,\u201d Moussa demanded.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d Chelsea agreed good-naturedly. But secretly, he added, \u201cIn bed, you\u2019ll listen to me.\u201dMoussa was finally satisfied and breathed in her nose. The tears that had accumulated had disappeared without a trace.\u201cLittle thing, are you satisfied?\u201d Chelsea dotingly kissed her nose and teased.Moussa was a little embarrassed and didn\u2019t look at him. Chelsea kissed her again and laughed lightly, \u201cIf you are satisfied, can you feed me now? I am not full yet.\u201d He used his hardened stick to push it between her legs.Moussa sheepishly hammered him and half-heartedly let him spread her legs to slowly put the big stick in.\u201cHiss. Chelsea. You gently. Slow down. It hurts.\u201d Moussa\u2019s p*ssy was red and swollen from Chelsea\u2019s wild thrusts earlier. Even if he slowed down his entry, it still hurt. The pain made her frown.\u201cBe good. Bear it. Soon it will be good!\u201d Chelsea was distressed to see her frowning in pain. However, the swelling underneath his body made him unable to stop, so he had to coo in her earlobe in a low voice.\u201cWhat a moment to be comfortable. You are comfortable, right?\u201d Moussa did not think to mutter a sentence. She gave vent to her anger and bit hard on his shoulder. She wanted to be in pain together and not always feel the pain alone while he was enjoying.\u201cHiss.\u201d Surprised by her bite, Chelsea sucked back a breath. He had thick skin, and this pain was nothing to him. On the contrary, it stimulated him to be more frantic. He pulled out his stick, which had entered two-thirds of her p*ssy, to the entrance and thrust it hard into the end.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa cried out in relief as her p*ssy was stretched to the limit. It seemed like she was feeling both pleasure and pain.\u201cSo tight, baby. Loosen up.\u201d Chelsea gasped, resisting the desire to rampage inside her. He lowered his head and took the tip of one of her n*pples. He nibbled on it, making small, shallow thrusts, and slowly waited for her to get used to it.\u201cAh! Mmm. Ah.\u201d Moussa got weak from his impaling. His rare gentle movements made her p*ssy even wetter, and her whole body softened into a puddle beneath him.\u201cYou feel better? Well, how sweet you sound!\u201d Chelsea felt more and more water flowing from her p*ssy and thought it was time. He pushed his waist up and shoved it in hard. The huge stick was pushed into her cervix before he could stop.\u201cAh!\u201d A kind of illusion to be penetrated made Moussa let out a loud cry. The snow-white softness on her chest also shook violently with it.\u201cScream louder, baby. I love to hear you scream.\u201d Chelsea tightened his grip on her waist. No longer suppressing his desire, Chelsea\u2019s ferocious movements pushed her back and forth. The thick, long stick kept pounding deeper and deeper, bringing out a considerable amount of fluid with each entry and exit, making constant sounds.Every time he pushed hard her p*ssy, she screamed. Her p*ssy was so tight that each thrust required a lot of force to open up the layers of the soft but tight flesh. Every time he pulled out, it was like a million little mouths were sucking hard on his rod. It was such superb enjoyment that Chelsea couldn\u2019t be gentle.\u201cYou are so f*cked, baby. You are so f*cked! You are a very good girl.\u201d Chelsea gradually felt that it was not enough, so he put her legs on his shoulders, roaring furiously with even wilder strokes and thrusts.\u201cAh ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa had been distracted by his manipulation and could not beg for mercy. She shook her head wildly, her small hands clutching the animal skin beneath her as if she would be knocked out if she let go.At the end of the day, Moussa had been tormented and cried out, \u201cChelsea. Spare me. Oooh. I\u2019m dying. Ah!\u201dHer small face was flushed, both legs were wide open, and her eyes were dazed. She helplessly endured Chelsea\u2019s insatiable and fierce thrusts. The sensitive and delicate inner walls of her p*ssy were roughly stretched by his huge glans again and again. The painful and numbing stimulation made her tremble once again.Her p*ssy contracted violently, \u201cAh!\u201d Moussa let out a long moan and arched her body as hard as she could as she came.Chelsea finally couldn\u2019t hold back and roared, shooting off in a rolling stream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Somehow she got upset about it and started to sniffle.Chelsea was startled and hurriedly turned over on her side. Lying on his side, he lifted her chin and asked with concern, \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u201d\u201cYou, take it out!\u201d Moussa shot a glance at him and said indignantly.Chelsea panicked. He got so excited that Chelsea thought he had hurt her again. He hurriedly pulled his stick out. Without his d*ck plugged, white fluid mixed with clear nectar kept flowing out of her p*ssy that Chelsea\u2019s mouth was dry and his soft stick was hard again.However, he also got worried about whether he had hurt her again. He hurriedly pulled the animal skin next to him and wiped it on the entrance of her p*ssy. He scrutinized it to see that it was not torn but red and swollen. He was afraid she would have to eat some pain if his big stick wanted to go in again.After all, he did not want her to be suffering too much. So he held back his desire and cajoled softly as he looked up, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? Your p*ssy down there is not torn. So, where do you feel uncomfortable? Hmm?\u201dMoussa hammered him on the chest and complained, \u201cYou\u2019re just bullying me. You almost killed me just now!\u201dChelsea was happy to hear this. He lowered his head and kissed her several times on the lips, then smugly said, \u201cSo, your husband is courageous, right? You like me to be brave, don\u2019t you?\u201dSeeing his gleeful look, Moussa was itching with hatred. She was almost tossed to death by him, but he didn\u2019t know how much she felt. In fact, he felt proud of himself. Therefore, she pinched him hard on his waist.She said, \u201cYou\u2019re still laughing? You do not know what I feel!\u201d\u201cBaby, you\u2019re wronging me. This is how I feel about you, very hard.\u201d Chelsea licked her earlobe and said lustfully.Moussa saw that he did not have the right attitude. She did not bother to tell him that she was just a little bit bullied and was pretentious and wanted him to coax her. For now, she had calmed down and was feeling a little sleepy.Moussa knocked him a bit and nestled in his arms after calming down. It was then that he said quietly, \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything dangerous in the future. If you get hurt, I\u2019ll be heartbroken.\u201dChelsea could not help getting red-eyed. Tightening his arms around her, he kissed the top of her hair and whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d How long had it been since he had this feeling of being loved? At this moment he felt so happy. So happy that even if he had to die like this, he was willing.So she pushed him away and rolled over. Turning her back on him, she muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re annoying. I don\u2019t care about you.\u201dMoussa ignored him, but Chelsea was insistent. His hands reached her b00bs and played with her softness. His mouth also moved up and blew hot air in her ear, asking ambiguously, \u201cWife, why am I annoying? Is it because you are not satisfied enough? Then let\u2019s do it again, eh?\u201d He also rubbed his hardened stick between her legs.Moussa could not help but want to wail. This male beastman\u2019s physical strength was too much. He had not eaten since this morning, built the house all morning, and then came home and pressed her in bed ruthlessly all afternoon. At this time, he was still so \u2018s*xually\u2019 interested that he would not be tired!On the thought of eating, Moussa also felt a little hungry. She was also early in the morning. While waiting for Chelsea, she ate some food handed to her by other beastmen. After an afternoon of such heavy exercise, it had all been digested.So she grabbed his big hand on her chest and said weakly, \u201cChelsea, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dChelsea right now had his whole mind on her p*ssy. He was full of thoughts about how to coax her to agree to let him in. The sudden statement she made really made him frozen. After thinking for a moment, he also felt that he had gone too far. He hadn\u2019t let her eat in the morning, and it had been a day. She should be hungry, so he hurriedly got up and put on his animal skin skirt while asking softly, \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cI want to eat meat stew and fish soup.\u201d Anyway, she ordered whatever. This way, he would prepare the food, and she could take the opportunity to have a good sleep.Chelsea sighed. He knew that the little thing in bed sincerely wanted to torment him. But instead of feeling troubled, Chelsea felt sweet. He shook his head and smiled and went out in the rain to catch fish for her.She did not know how long it had taken. Moussa was sleeping sweetly when she suddenly heard the sound of the door opening. She woke up in a daze and looked up to see that Chelsea had returned.Chelsea saw that she was looking at him, so he raised his hands, carrying a few fish. Softly saying, \u201cLook at the fish I got back. Wait a while, and then you can eat. You can sleep again, and I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d\u201cMmm .\u201d Moussa rubbed herself in the bed in a daze and closed her eyes, ready to obey and go to sleep.But suddenly, she felt something wrong. She opened her eyes again, and this time she really came to her senses. She got up and ran to Chelsea\u2019s side. She grabbed his bloody right arm and asked, with red eyes and a trembling voice, \u201cHow did you get this?\u201dChelsea hurriedly put down the fish in his hand. He wrapped his uninjured left arm around her and patted her back softly, and comforted her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just that I was accidentally bitten. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine in a couple of days. You go lie down on the bed first. It\u2019s cold on the floor, and you can eat soon.\u201cWhat do you think I should be doing?\u201d Moussa saw that he was so severely injured but still spoke lightly. He didn\u2019t care about his body at all. She was furious and pushed him to the bed to sit down and then ordered, \u201cSit still here. I\u2019ll clean your wound first.\u201d\u2018Pa-la, pa-la\u2019 Looking at the bowl-sized wound on his arm, which was still bleeding out, Moussa\u2019s tears could not stop flowing down. Then she went to get a basin of water and found clean animal skin. She carefully cleaned the wound on his arm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moussa gently pushed him and said, \u201cYou go to bed now and lie down. I\u2019ll cook. You need to eat something to replenish your strength.\u201d He hadn\u2019t eaten anything all day. Without energy, she was afraid he would get a fever later.Chelsea wanted to say no, but Moussa glared at him coldly. He curled his lips and obediently went to lie down on the bed.Moussa quickly made the meal and did not let him get out of bed. She let him lean on the bed and then fed him one spoonful after another.Chelsea was so happy. He didn\u2019t expect to get a slight injury, but he was lucky to have Moussa treat him so carefully. It was beautiful.After dinner, Moussa boiled water and took a bath. Then she helped Chelsea wipe his body. During that time, something kept standing up in his lower body, and the big devil kept humming in her ear, \u201cIt\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard.\u201dMoussa blanked. What a horny lion. He was injured and still thinking about that kind of thing. Nevertheless, seeing that he was injured, Moussa obediently undressed and let him press her underneath with kisses and nibbles.\u201cHiss.\u201d Moussa\u2019s p*ssy was still swollen. He just stuck a finger in, and it hurt her straight.Chelsea frowned. One finger caused her such pain. It appeared that he couldn\u2019t use the front hole tonight. So he pulled out his finger and inserted it into her *sshole instead.Moussa was so shocked that she twisted her waist and refused, \u201cChelsea, no. I can\u2019t do it there.\u201d\u201cYes, baby. I got in there last time. Yes, I can. I promise to be gentle this time. I won\u2019t hurt you. Be good.\u201d Chelsea kissed her brow, again and again, coaxing in a low voice.\u201cDon\u2019t, Chelsea. It hurts.\u201d Remembering the last time he entered, the memory of that painful heartbreak came back to haunt her. It made Moussa frown straight away, but she didn\u2019t dare to struggle hard for fear of touching his wound.\u201cYou will be okay. A few more times, and it won\u2019t hurt anymore. Ivy and the others are using this place. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s good too?\u201d While Chelsea coaxed her, he reached in two fingers and tried to expand it.Here it came again and back to this topic. Moussa thought about it.\u00a0Let the pain come. Maybe it won\u2019t hurt after a few more thrusts, as he said.\u00a0She didn\u2019t want to spoil his fun because she found that as long as he wanted it, she was willing to give it. Even if it really hurt.Moussa no longer struggled and even took the initiative to spread her legs around his waist. She relaxed as much as possible and let him stretch her *sshole.Feeling that Moussa no longer resisted, Chelsea gladly lowered his head and kissed her tenderly. His other hand also went down and touched her p*ssy\u2019s sensitive ball to let some water flow freely. It could lubricate her *sshole.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he flipped her over and got into a kneeling position, raised her ass up high, and then he knelt down between her legs. He slowly pushed his big honey-soaked rod into her *sshole.\u201dAh!\u201d Although he did well enough stretching, the huge thing was completely out of proportion, trying to squeeze hard into her narrow hole. This still made Moussa scream out in pain.\u201cBaby, relax, relax. Just let the head go in. Be a good girl. Just hold on.\u201d Chelsea stroked the big rod with one hand and pushed the glans in harder. One hand was holding her waist to keep her from moving forward while he coaxed softly.Moussa took a deep breath. She closed her eyes and hypnotized herself not to tense up. She had to relax, relax, and let him in.\u201cHuh!\u201d Chelsea finally pushed the huge glans into Moussa\u2019s *sshole and stopped to pant violently.Moussa\u2019s *sshole had already been stretched to the limit. All the folds were stretched out. Moussa clenched the animal skin beneath her, not daring to move. She was afraid that a move would cause her to tear.Her *sshole, entered by a foreign object, began to contract unconsciously, squeezing Chelsea\u2019s rod.\u201cHiss, baby. Don\u2019t tighten it so much. You\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d Chelsea could not help but suck in a breath. His big hand kneaded her white buttocks and spread them outward. He was able to get his rod into a deeper place with a bit of force.\u201cBad man.\u201d Moussa was in pain. Hearing that he did not know how to be considerate and blamed her for strangling too tightly, she could not help but scold quietly.\u201cWhere did I screw up? Is it here? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea resisted the desire to plunge to the bottom. He leaned down and nibbled on her snowy back while gently pushing against the inner wall of her *sshole, trying to relax her.\u201cMmmm.\u201d He was gently working on his hole little by little. Gradually a tingling sensation arose amidst the pain. The stimulation caused Moussa to moan.Because of this tingling, the grip of her inner wall began to relax. Chelsea felt that it was time, and a push of his waist plugged the whole thing in.\u201cAhhhhh! So painful!\u201d The intense friction made Moussa scream. Because there was insufficient fluid to lubricate, her *sshole was not as stretchy as her p*ssy. The entire tunnel was on fire and painful inside as he stretched it hard.\u201cBe good, baby. Bear with it. Bear with it for me.\u201d Chelsea was distressed to hear her cry out in pain and forced himself to stop moving inside her. Then he kept teasing her sensitive spots until she relaxed again. Then he began to grind very gently and slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To make her no longer reject his entry inside, this time, he must make her change her mind. He must be very gentle, very gentle to hurt her.Chelsea was rarely so gentle in sexual matters. Moussa\u2019s *sshole also slowly adapted to the foreign body invasion. It gradually secreted some fluid, and the inner wall was much softer. It no longer strangled his rod to death.\u201cBaby, are you feeling better?\u201d Chelsea increased the rate of in and out. He moved gently on Moussa\u2019s back and kissed her on the neck as he moved in.His rough hands went around from her armpits to the front and dominantly grabbed her jiggling breasts from his impact. He rubbed them vigorously.Moussa was tormented by this tingling and painful sensation. Clutching the animal skin beneath her, she whimpered.\u201cTell me, is this comfortable?\u201d Chelsea relentlessly pursued. Rubbing her breasts, his large hands were getting fiercer and fiercer. He kept changing the angle of his rod in her *sshole and poking at the inner wall.\u201cSo. Comfortable. Mmm.\u201d Moussa had been teased by his almost deep and shallow poking and prodding. It seemed like there was a feather continuously teasing her *sshole. She wanted him to go harder and faster but was too embarrassed to say it out. She could only twist her waist to clamp him impatiently.\u201cAnd how about this?\u201d Chelsea asked as he slammed her hard and fast a few times.\u201cAh,\u201d Moussa moaned in what seemed like comfort and pain. Her *sshole contracted unconsciously.\u201cThat\u2019s good too? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea felt pain from the unconscious tightening of her inner walls and pulled out. He poked shallowly at the opening of her ass, grinding slowly and deliberately.\u201cMmm.\u201d The sudden emptiness felt unbearable. Moussa wriggled her waist and hips more violently and whimpered.\u201cBaby, do you want me to be gentle or go harder? Tell me, baby, tell me!\u201d Chelsea\u2019s voice was low and ambiguous, tempting her.\u201cA little harder. Chelsea, husband. A little harder,\u201d Moussa cried out. She finally threw back her head as she was tortured.\u201cGood, baby. All at your service.\u201d Chelsea roared and pushed in hard. He started to move in and out vigorously.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa shrieked. He slammed her down on the bed, pressing his hips fiercely. Chelsea kept pushing his hideous rod in and out of her *sshole. Moussa\u2019s snow-white ass shoved forward as he slammed it, making Chelsea even more excited. He simply pulled her up from the bed and let her sit on top of him. Then his hands grabbed her waist, lifting and dropping her. He was having a lot of fun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He brought her up and then let go of her. She sat down heavily because of her weight and let his rod enter deep and heavy. Moussa could not stand it after a few strokes. She cried out and begged for mercy: \u201cAh! Husband. Forgive me. Forgive me. I can\u2019t stand it. Oooh. No. No. No. \u201c\u201dThat\u2019s not good enough? Didn\u2019t you just ask me to go a little bit harder, huh? I have not come out once. How to spare you?\u201d Chelsea was soothed by her twisting. Behind her ear, he panted heavily while responding.\u201dGently. Husband. Gently. Ahhhh! \u201d He was so fierce that Moussa felt like she was about to be torn apart by him. She whimpered in fear and pain. Moussa begged for mercy. She brought her small hand down, trying to hold his rod that was pounding ferociously in and out of her ass to slow the force of his pounding.\u201cRoar. Little thing. F*ck you!\u201d Moussa\u2019s small hand held Chelsea\u2019s rod. While moving in and out of her *sshole, her small hand also fondled him. Chelsea was served by her *sshole and small hands at the same time. He pinned her down again and pounded her heavily and deeply a few times. He was somewhat overwhelmed and roared. He moaned and poured all the burning seed into the depths of her *sshole.Moussa also followed it with a powerful convulsion and came.After the passion, Chelsea seemed very satisfied with Moussa\u2019s performance. He lay on her back and refused to get off. He pecked at her back, nibbling and biting as he got excited and made Moussa\u2019s back bruised and battered with marks.After the peak, Moussa was dizzy. Under his constant teasing, she came to her senses again. The moment Moussa moved, her *sshole became painful and uncomfortable. She had an energetic and oversized husband who made her suffer a lot, but she couldn\u2019t help it because she seemed to be in love with him. Helplessly, she sighed and said with some grief, \u201cHusband, you take it out. It is rising again!\u201d One more time and he would have had her killed.Chelsea saw that she had eased up, so he turned her over. Lying on her side, he wrapped his arms around her from behind. Taking her earlobe, he asked ambiguously, \u201cWife, do you feel good when I did your behind ?\u201dMoussa blushed in shame and almost bit her tongue. Although it was not the first time to hear him say such shameless words, she was still not accustomed to it. However, Moussa knew that he would not rest until he got a satisfactory answer.She had no choice but to nod helplessly and give a perfunctory \u201chmm,\u201d hoping he would be satisfied.Chelsea got a satisfactory answer and happily pulled out the softened rod. Then he moved her head, pressed his lips against hers, stuck his tongue into her mouth, and hooked her little tongue into a passionate, fiery kiss.Moussa seemed to be particularly good today. He kissed and caressed her for a long time. The good thing was that Chelsea was concerned about the swollen two holes below her, so Chelsea didn\u2019t put the rod in again. Having kissed enough, he hugged her tightly from behind, and soon they both fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chelsea hugged her from behind, and the two naked bodies were close together, leaving no gap.Moussa felt the body behind her was terribly hot. She was shocked and hurriedly broke out from his arms. She turned around and put her hand on his forehead, which was very hot.Chelsea sure had a fever. He was injured, got drenched in the rain for so long, and returned without knowing how to rest. He tossed her around and pressed her for a while, so it was strange not to have a fever.Chelsea also woke up at the same time she moved. He took her into his arms again and rubbed his head on her neck. He closed his eyes and said lazily, \u201cWife, I am sleepy. Sleep with me again.\u201dMoussa saw him acting like a child, yet he was charming and coquettish. Even though she was angry, she could not bear to scold him. So she gently patted his back and softly coaxed, \u201cHusband, you have a fever. Let go of me first. I\u2019ll go to Karida\u2019s and ask for some medicine for you to take.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to hold you and sleep.\u201d Chelsea did not know if it was because of the fever. Hearing Moussa\u2019s words, not only did he not let go, but he hugged her tighter.Moussa\u2019s thoughts went blank. She had never seen such a capricious side of Chelsea. But he seemed like a child. So cute. She chuckled lightly and continued to coax, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go make something delicious for you to eat, okay? When you\u2019re full, we\u2019ll go back to sleep. Okay?\u201dHad enough food and went back to sleep? Chelsea\u2019s mind was dazed, but a particular part of his body was unconsciously excited when she said this. After analyzing the remaining reason, it seemed that this proposal to eat and sleep was excellent. After eating and having energy, he could do something else before going to sleep. Therefore, he obediently let go of her hand and murmured, \u201cThen you hurry up.\u201d\u201cMm, okay. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d Moussa responded and quickly crawled out of his arms. She carelessly put on her clothes and rushed out, not caring that it was still raining outside.Moussa often visited Karida for medicines, so she was very familiar with his location. She ran all the way and arrived at his door in a short time. She was just about to knock on the door when she heard a scream coming from inside.\u201cAh! Karida, ah! So big. Too exciting. Thrust me to death. Well. Too thick. Hold it up. Mmm.\u201dMoussa was startled and took a step back. Then her face flushed, thinking she knew what was going on inside. If Moussa knocked on the door now and interrupted the lovemaking, Karida would be very angry, right? So she dropped her raised hand and had no choice but to stand outside the door and wait.\u201cAre you feeling good, Laka? Baby, am I screwing you good?\u201d Karida\u2019s low voice sounded out as well.\u201cAh! Ah! So good. Ah. You f*ck me so good. Um. Ah. Dear, deeper \u2026\u2026 then focus.\u201d Hearing Laka\u2019s voice, Moussa could not help but feel shocked. She really could not imagine that the usual so serious Laka, in bed shouting in such a lascivious way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was really like Ivy said. The fox tribe\u2019s females were splendid in bed. Then it occurred to her that men seem to like women screaming loudly in bed. Chelsea also said he enjoyed her screaming loudly. She was so shy; did Chelsea feel unsatisfied with her?Moussa hurriedly patted her hot face to stop herself from considering nonsense. How could she think unashamedly of such things?\u201cPop! Snap! Pop!\u201d\u201d Poof! Plop!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dThe sound of flesh hitting and slapping violently accompanied by Laka\u2019s moans rang out for an unknown period. In the end, Laka was heard screaming, \u201cAhhh! So good. So deep! Karida, ah! I want to be f*cked by you! Ah! \u201dRight after that, there was no sound. Moussa felt that it should be over inside. She hurriedly splashed some rainwater on her face to cool herself down, then knocked lightly on the door a few times. She said softly outside the door, \u201cKarida, this is Moussa. Chelsea has a fever, and I want to ask you for some medicine that can reduce it.\u201dThere was a moment of silence in the room. Then came Karida\u2019s voice, which was still breathing unsteadily, \u201cGot it, you wait.\u201d\u201cYes, okay.\u201d Moussa obediently stepped back and waited outside the door.Karida soon came out and seemed to be in a good mood, showing a lazy expression after satisfying his desire. He handed Moussa a handful of herbs and explained, \u201cPut it in water and boil it, then let him drink the water. After that, let him exercise and sweat. Then put the animal hide over him to sleep, and he will be fine.\u201dLooking at Moussa nodding while attentively remembering, his eyes flashed. He went into the house to get a small wooden box and handed it to Moussa. \u201cMy new formula to reduce swelling and pain. There is an unexpected effect there. You go back and try it.\u201dAfter saying that, he did not care about Moussa\u2019s blushing face. He snapped the door shut and went in.Moussa loudly thanked and ran home, blushing.Then she cooked the meat and then boiled the medicine. She woke up Chelsea, who was still sleeping, fed him the food and the medication.She coaxed him to lie down again. She untied the animal skin on his arm and changed the medicine. She saw that the wound seemed to be healing.After being bullied by him last night, she went straight to sleep, and her hole was full of his stuff. She was ready to go to the bathroom to wash off the sticky stuff. She was in a hurry to get the medicine from Karida and didn\u2019t have time to clean. She felt something coming out when she moved, making her body uncomfortable. But as soon as she turned around, Chelsea pulled her back, \u201cWife, you promised to sleep with me.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, you wait for me. I\u2019ll go wash up and be right back.\u201d Moussa placated nicely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She hummed softly in comfort, rubbing her skin. Moussa did not know if it was because of the water quality. She spent all day in the sun and did not wear any cosmetics, but her skin did not become darker and rougher. On the contrary, it was getting more tender and white, which all women dream of. But in this different world, everything worked effortlessly.She also discovered that her physique was much better. For example, when she first came here, she could barely climb halfway before being too tired. But now, she could quickly go to the top of the mountain. Could it be because the food here was all-natural and unpolluted, so it was particularly nourishing? Moussa was thinking randomly when she heard Chelsea over there urging her to hurry up.Sighing helplessly, she answered and then hurriedly climbed out of the tub. She casually wiped the water on her body and decided to take the ointment Karida had given her. She smeared some on her two holes. She had already reduced the swelling, but it was hard for him not to toss her again with great passion, based on Chelsea\u2019s eager look. Suddenly, she remembered Karida\u2019s words about letting Chelsea exercise and sweat a little. She blushed for a moment. The exercise he said was not for him to do that kind of thing.She no longer bothered to think about it for fear that Chelsea would get out of bed to find her. She hurriedly put on her clothes and went out. As soon as Moussa entered the room, Moussa saw Chelsea getting ready to get out of bed. She hurriedly ran and pushed him back into bed. Then she used the animal skin to cover him tightly.Moussa had no choice but to lie down beside him. Chelsea was delighted, lowered his head to kiss her, and his hands went in from under her clothes to knead her breasts. Chelsea used the opportunity to pull her and refused to let go.Moussa was shocked to feel that the two holes underneath her were so itchy. It seemed like there were millions of ants crawling inside. It was so itchy as well as uncomfortable. She wanted something to stick in and stop the itch. Moussa couldn\u2019t help but stick out her tongue and take the initiative to entwine with him while pushing her waist to rub him.Chelsea felt Moussa\u2019s unusual enthusiasm. A little surprised, he let go of her lips and saw the abnormal flush on her face. He asked worriedly, \u201cWife, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cMmm. Chelsea, I am itchy. I am so itchy inside. Mmm \u2026\u2026 help me, help me!\u201d Moussa rubbed her waist against him as she grabbed his big hand and sent it underneath her.Chelsea frowned and let her pull his hand against the base of her thighs, where it was already wet. Hers was still spitting out water, and Chelsea couldn\u2019t believe that she had gotten wet so quickly. He hadn\u2019t even touched it, and she had gotten wet like this.Moussa saw that he was still dilly-dallying and refused to help her stop the itch. She forcefully closed her legs around his hand and cried impatiently, \u201cChelsea, come in. So itchy. Oooh. Help me. Oooh.\u201d\u201cMoussa, tell me. Did anyone give you something to eat?\u201d Chelsea asked seriously as he pulled his hand out from between her legs to grab her arm. She looked like she had eaten the \u2018love fruit.\u2019 The village strictly forbade feeding \u2018 love fruit \u2018 to females. Only those ill-intentioned males usually trick females into eating the \u2018love fruit\u2019 to copulate with them. It was a very disgraceful means. Who, in the end, dared to give Moussa the \u2018love fruit\u2019? He simply wanted to die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I applied the ointment given by \u2026\u2026 Karida. Oooh. So uncomfortable. Husband, help me.\u201d Moussa also felt that Karida\u2019s s ointment seemed a little off. But she felt a strong wave of itchiness underneath her body, so she had no time to think. All by instinct, she desperately rubbed herself on Chelsea\u2019s body, and her small hands touched him randomly.Chelsea breathed a sigh of relief. Luckily, it was Karida. Probably he and Moussa had somehow offended him again, so he deliberately set them up. He put his finger stained with Moussa\u2019s nectar under his nose and sniffed it, and it really had the smell of \u2018love fruit.\u2019 He was finally relieved.Then he released Moussa\u2019s arm. He stood up, stripped her clothes, and moved his finger downward, poofed into Moussa\u2019s already slippery flower, and teased her still, \u201cBaby, I\u2019m in. What else do you want me to do, tell me?\u201d\u201cOooh. Move. Move.

She gasped, \u201cNo, thrust me hard. Hard. Mmmm \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAll yours, baby!\u201d Chelsea said as he dipped his head and kissed her on the lips before inserting another finger in and thrusting it quickly and harshly into her p*ssy.\u201cAaaaaah,\u201d Moussa moaned in comfort as the itch in hers was relieved.But in a short while, the itch deep in her p*ssy came back. Moussa began to squirm unbearably again.Chelsea stopped pumping his fingers and asked knowingly, \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong with you again? Is it not hard enough?\u201d\u201cInside. It\u2019s itchy inside. Ooooh.\u201d Moussa was in no mood to pay attention to his teasing. She was going crazy with the itchiness buried beneath her.\u201cIt\u2019s itchy inside. What should I do if my fingers can\u2019t reach it? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea simply pulled his fingers out. His huge rod was poking and prodding at the entrance of her flower, refusing to go in.\u201cInsert it in, insert it in. Please, husband. Thrust me hard. Ah! Mmm!\u201d Moussa couldn\u2019t hold back any longer and screamed at the top of her lungs.Chelsea had been waiting for her to say this. Without waiting for her to finish shouting, he pushed forward and plunged in with a poof. Chelsea entered very smoothly because of her overly wet flower. When he was at the deepest point, he pushed again as hard as he could. He drove the huge glans into her cervix.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa screamed in shock the moment he roofed her womb\u2019s opening. But the pain was quickly drowned out by the itch. \u201cHusband, move around\u2026 move around!\u201dChelsea was aroused by her eagerness to get underneath him. He no longer had the heart to tease her and held her waist up. He thrust up quickly, deep and hard, one at a time.Moussa could not take it anymore after a few strokes. Her whole body shuddered, and she clenched up and came. Chelsea almost couldn\u2019t hold back from being strung up by her, so he lowered his head and nibbled on her sweaty little nose. Then he pulled it all out and pushed it in hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was so comfortable that she was screaming straight mmmmhhhh.\u201cLittle thing, are you satisfied? Yes?\u201d Chelsea kept pushing against her with her waist constantly raised, pounding her hard. At the same time, Chelsea didn\u2019t forget to tease her.\u201cComfortable. Mmm. Husband. You\u2019re hitting me so hard. Mmm. Harder! Harder! Ah!\u201d Moussa was completely lost at the moment, gasping for breath and shouting randomly.\u201cDo you good, little thing. Do you good!\u201d Chelsea got more frantic by her encouragement. He picked her up from the bed, threw and pulled her up and down, and filled her hard.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa was a bit overwhelmed. It felt like her womb would be blown through by him, but there was an inexplicable feeling of pleasure that was rising. She couldn\u2019t help but let her waist and legs move to meet his banging. Chelsea felt her response and was even more excited. The more she went into battle, the harder he went in and out. It took a few hundred strokes before he came shooting out.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa\u2019s flower got a hot blast from him and let out a long moan. She collapsed on the bed, exhausted, and didn\u2019t want to move. But before she could catch her breath, the itch in her chrysanthemum was raging again. \u201cChelsea,\u201d Moussa called out to him breathlessly.\u201cHmm?\u201d Chelsea looked up with a happy face and looked at her tenderly.\u201cI am itchy. My behind is itchy.\u201d Moussa was on the verge of tears. The itch that was drilling through her heart had started again.Chelsea was overjoyed to hear it. He kissed her on the lips and laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I\u2019ll stop the itch.\u201d Saying that he pulled his instantly hardened rod out from her p*ssy and then slowly inserted it into Moussa\u2019s chrysanthemum.Therefore, Moussa got a full day spent on the bed with Chelsea to stop the itch. Although Moussa was no longer itchy, Chelsea said that it was necessary to stabilize to prevent a relapse. So he took turns plugging the two holes. Finally, Moussa could not stand it anymore. She fainted, so he finally stopped.Looking at her sweaty little face when she passed out, Chelsea kissed her lovingly. This whole day\u2019s \u2018work\u2019 had him sweating a lot. It was relaxing. He put his hand on his forehead and tried the temperature. It was not hot. The fever had gone down.After thinking about it for a while, he grabbed the animal skin next to Moussa to cover her. Then he put on the animal skin skirt and got up to find Karida to settle the score. Although her rare passionate initiative made him feel good, Karida dared to do bad things to his partner. He still had to find him to settle the score.He soon arrived at Karida\u2019s door. He didn\u2019t care what the people in the house were doing. He stood at the door and shouted, \u201cKarida, come out. I want to see you.\u201dHe seemed to have known that Chelsea was coming and was not surprised. He teased calmly, \u201cYou\u2019re later than I expected. It seems that Moussa has good stamina\u2026 you just made her faint?\u201dChelsea blushed at his words. He coughed and returned to his cold expression, saying in a deep voice, \u201cKarida, aren\u2019t you going too far? How dare you trick Moussa into rubbing the ointment containing the \u2018love fruit\u2019?\u201d\u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t have a good time and came here specifically to accuse me?\u201d Karida looked at him with an evil smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m asking you why you tricked Moussa into rubbing the ointment containing the \u2018love fruit.\u2019\u201d\u201dI just want to let you feel good.\u201d Karida looked like he had done a good deed. The \u2018you should thank me\u2019 look was on his face. \u201cSeeing that you have recently been unsatisfied, I am kind enough to help you out!\u201d\u201dYou,\u201d Chelsea was rendered helpless by him. It was a fact that she didn\u2019t let him enjoy it more, so he threw a line saying, \u201cWho wants you to meddle?\u201d Then he turned around and walked away.\u201cYou\u2019re so heartless. You didn\u2019t even thank me when you got laid, really.\u201d Karida muttered behind him and turned around to go inside.The following day, Moussa was awakened from hunger. She had eaten a meal yesterday, and that much \u2018exercise\u2019 would be strange if she was not hungry.Trying to open her tired eyelids, she felt no place in her body that was not sore. Especially below, it was hot and painful. This feeling was familiar to Moussa, and she could not help but curse in a small voice, \u201cBad guy.\u201d\u201cBaby, who is the bad guy?\u201d Chelsea had long been awake. Seeing that she was still sleeping, he was bored and kissed her body. Suddenly he saw her eyes open and pouted, \u201cBad guy.\u201d He was in a good mood. He put his arm around her from behind and teased her around her earlobe.\u201cHmm,\u201d Moussa stiffened at the sound. She suddenly remembered the rainy season, and Chelsea didn\u2019t even have to go out hunting. All the things yesterday came back to her slowly. Moussa was so ashamed that she wanted to find a hole in the ground. Oh my God, the person who kept rubbing against him and shouting for him to stuff her heavily was really her. Oooh \u2026\u2026 she had no face to meet people.Chelsea saw that she had not spoken for a long time and that her face was shockingly red. He knew that she remembered what happened yesterday and became shy. He liked to see her shy and timid appearance, so he teased, \u201cWhat? Yesterday, you kept pulling me and asked me to do it hard. But now that you are satisfied, you are ignoring me and calling me a bad person. Hmm?\u201d\u201cChelsea \u2026\u2026 please, don\u2019t say it!\u201d Moussa was so ashamed that she buried her face into the animal skin covering the bed and muffled a plea for mercy.\u201cHaha, little thing, you did it all, and you still won\u2019t let me mention it. Huh?\u201d Chelsea was amused at her. He laughed out loud, and his big hands kept moving back and forth on her body, causing Moussa to shyly shudder a little.\u201cDon\u2019t, Chelsea. I\u2019m still in pain.\u201d Feeling his hands moving further and further down, Moussa couldn\u2019t care less about being shy and grabbed his hands to stop him from going down.\u201cOkay, my little baby. Let\u2019s take a bath and eat then, okay?\u201d Chelsea already checked earlier while she was sleeping, and both holes down there were indeed swollen. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have to be so bored.\u201cYeah.\u201d Moussa was too shy to hear him call her little baby dotingly, but she felt good.Chelsea was very good at helping Moussa take a bath. He also helped her apply the ointment to relieve the swelling and pain. Of course, the one without the \u2018love fruit.\u2019 He wanted to get rid of the one containing the love fruit. Still, remembering yesterday\u2019s soulful taste, he really had some reluctance to part with it. He wanted to have another one someday, so he quietly put it away.The two ate their meals. There was nothing to do, so they lay on the bed and chatted. As they talked, Chelsea was out of sorts again. The big hands that kept kneading her body were gradually getting out of control. It was getting increasingly aggressive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could not bear him because the swelling below her had not gone down. It was not good not to know when the rainy season would pass. There was no entertainment here, and Chelsea\u2019s biggest entertainment was bullying her. So she had to think of something quickly, or she would be tossed to death by Chelsea before the rainy season was over.So she stopped Chelsea\u2019s big hands from fumbling around and then softly said, \u201cChelsea, go get Ivy and Sander to come over and play, okay. I\u2019ll teach you guys how to play mahjong.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s mahjong?\u201d Chelsea asked, not understanding.\u201cYou go get them to come over. When they come, I\u2019ll explain it to you together.\u201d Moussa pushed him hard, urging him to hurry up.Chelsea reluctantly got up to call them. Soon Ivy and Sander came. The two were bored, and when they heard that Moussa wanted them to play some kind of mahjong, although they didn\u2019t know what it was, they were both very excited.Seeing the two come, Moussa pulled them and Chelsea together to make a mahjong pair out of wood. Four people sat down to play. Then she explained the rules in detail, taking the fruit as bets.After playing a few rounds, Moussa got depressed. Could it be that the beastmen in this different world was tall in stature and \u2018tall\u2019 in IQ? It was said that a well-developed limb should be simple-minded. However, looking at the fruit piled up around them, she had the least. She came from the civilization of the modern era, which was several thousands of times more civilized than here, so why did she lose the most? It had been quite a long time, and she couldn\u2019t even get a fart. While complaining, she heard another yell over there.\u201cWoo. Yes! Moussa, how many pieces of fruit are you going to give for this one?\u201d Ivy was so excited that she asked the other three for fruits.Oh goodness, there was no justice. Ivy couldn\u2019t calculate how many fruits she won, but she could remember playing with the tiles. Well, even she couldn\u2019t figure how much money she won when she first started learning, but they were learning too fast. Moussa explained the rules once, and they all learned how to play the game. It took her several days to learn, so she wondered if she had a low IQ.Chelsea saw Moussa\u2019s fruit getting fewer, and her face was getting unsightly. He couldn\u2019t help but come out and say, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired. Let\u2019s stop playing here today.\u201dIvy had not played enough, but hearing Chelsea say so was no good to say anything else. They agreed to come back tomorrow to play. Then she dragged Sander home with their trophies.As soon as they left, Chelsea pulled Moussa over and sat her on his lap. Then he pecked her on the lips and teased her in a low voice, \u201cYou lost so much of the family\u2019s fruit to someone else. How do you think I should punish you? Hmm?\u201d\u201cHusband.\u201d Moussa nestled into his arms, somewhat sulking. She took the initiative to wrap her arms around his neck and asked glumly, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201dChelsea went \u2018pfft\u2019 and dropped a kiss until she was panting. Then he put his forehead against hers and whispered, \u201cStupid.\u201dMoussa pinched his neck in discontent and snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re the stupid one. You\u2019re the stupid one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he coaxed her, \u201cI\u2019m stupid, I\u2019m stupid, OK? My wife is the smartest. She can make stew, shoes, and plant seedlings. Who is smarter than my wife? Hmm?\u201d\u201cHmph,\u201d Moussa finally cooled down. Exactly, who was as bright as her? Losing in mahjong only meant that she had bad luck in gambling, and it had nothing to do with her IQ. Moussa consoled herself.Chelsea watched her leaning in his arms. Small and soft, still puffy face, and a very vivid expression. He suddenly felt warm and happy. This should be the feeling of family, right? She moved his heart. He bowed to rub his forehead against hers a few times and asked gently and seriously, \u201cMoussa, give me a baby, okay?\u201d This was the first time he sincerely wanted something from the bottom of his heart, rather than being urged by the tribe\u2019s elders, that she bear a baby for him\u2026 a baby like her.Moussa froze for a moment. There was no need to ask, right? They had made love so often, and without taking any measures, he had been shooting inside. It was only a matter of time before there was a baby. But he was willing to ask her permission, so she felt cherished and valued. Therefore, she nodded shyly.Chelsea was overjoyed to see her nod. He moved to kiss her affectionately. He licked her inch by inch and gradually kissed her further and further down.His hand also took the opportunity to trace his way down, stroking her delicate white thighs, and slowly stopped at the root. Slowly squeezing his fingers in between her closed legs with a bit of force, he kept teasing them. First, he rubbed her sensitive little bulb of flesh. While she trembled lightly, he parted her petals and circled his mouth to tease her. Bit of force, he kept teasing them.\u201cMmm,\u201d Moussa got a little impatient with his teasing. She clamped her legs, wiggled her waist, and rubbed herself against him. The nectar flowed from her and drenched his fingers.\u201cGood girl, spread your legs.\u201d Chelsea loved the impatient expression on her face and kissed her on the lips seductively.Waves of stimulation made Moussa submit to the pleasure. With a dizzy face, she spread her legs wide, inviting his entry.\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Chelsea said as he turned her body around so that she was sitting with her back to him. She leaned back against him, and he could see clearly that her p*ssy was dripping and quivering as soon as he looked down.\u201cBaby, keep your head down.\u201d Then as Moussa ducked her head, he slid his finger inside her, which was already dripping wet. His finger drove in smoothly, opening her tight canal and penetrating it, with the other four fingers clasping and rubbing against her wet, slippery petals.\u201cMmm,\u201d looking down at his fingers going in and out of her made Moussa feel ashamed. Pursing her lips and looking away, she tried to close her thighs, only to have his other hand clasp them and pull them even wider apart.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby, don\u2019t you like to see? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea nibbled her earlobe and asked wickedly. When she pursed her lips and closed her eyes shyly, refusing to answer, he then teased, \u201cYour flower is very fond of my finger. Look how tight it is biting. It\u2019s greedy, isn\u2019t it? Listen to the sound it makes. It\u2019s flowing so much water and wants something bigger to eat, eh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The skin all over her body turned pink with shame. She twisted her waist to escape his teasing, but her p*ssy unconsciously contracted and wrapped tightly around the invading long fingers, overflowing with juice.\u201cHehe,\u201d Looking at her embarrassed yet delicate look, Chelsea laughed lightly. He now liked to tease her more and more, especially hearing her little mouth shouting for him to do her. The taste was many times more exciting than his outright thrusting.\u201cLittle thing, tell me. Do you want a big stick to stick you? If you do not say, there will be nothing.\u201d He said as he pulled his fingers out. His hands went up to cover her snow-white breasts and rubbed and pulled them vigorously.\u201cMmmmm,\u201d A burst of tingling spread from the breasts straight to her lower body. Moussa\u2019s desire was provoked entirely, but he withdrew at this time. The feeling of emptiness in her grew stronger and stronger, forcing Moussa to put aside her modesty and whispered a plea, \u201cChelsea, come in\u2026 please, come in.\u201d\u201cBaby, what do you want to go in? Where to go in? If you don\u2019t tell me, I won\u2019t know.\u201d Chelsea grabbed both of her hard nipples and lifted them upwards. The tingling on the tips of her nipples stimulated Moussa to go even crazier. She whipped her head around and screamed.\u201cGet in here with your big meat stick\u2026 Get inside me\u2026 Husband, hit me hard, please\u2026 hit me hard.\u201d\u201cYes, baby. Watch down as I f*ck you hard.\u201d Chelsea said as he grabbed her slim waist and turned her around, so she was facing him. Then he put his huge rod against hers, easing her into a sitting position.\u201cMmmm,\u201d Moussa was already unbelievably wet. However, once his huge-sized rod entered, she still let out a muffled grunt from the discomfort of being stretched to the max.\u201cLook down, baby. See how I f*ck you.\u201d Chelsea said as he pushed his waist upward and entered at the end.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa screamed as the opening of her womb was opened again. The pain was unavoidable every time he entered, and she had to force herself to adapt as much as possible.However, Chelsea did not give her time to adapt. His hands were tightly holding her waist, guiding her in a series of ups and downs. Sometimes, he would raise his waist to hit her hard when she was going down, causing Moussa to scream.The force of her descent and the force of his upward thrusts overlapped together, allowing his huge d*ck to poke heavily into her womb. The inner walls of her womb felt as if they were getting pierced by him. The fear of being pierced combined with the aching pleasure made Moussa scream before receiving a few blows. She started to sob and beg for mercy.\u201cOooh. Slow. Slow. Slow. Ah! Gently. Chelsea, go to bed. Ah ah! Please, mmm.\u201d\u201cOkay, little thing. Whatever you say.\u201d Chelsea pounded her a few more times. Satisfied to hear her whimpers, he then rose up with her in his arms. Chelsea moved her violently up and down as he walked toward the bed. Before he reached the edge of the bed, Moussa winced and screamed her way to the top.\u201cYou feel great little thing?\u201d Chelsea was caught in her orgasm. Her flower tightened violently that he couldn\u2019t control the force anymore. He pinned her to the bed and started pumping like crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their union kept oozing lustful fluids and making ambiguous noises.\u201cAh! Ah ah! Ah! Ah ah ah!\u201d Moussa\u2019s sweaty little face turned into a wrinkled mess while her little mouth unconsciously screamed loudly in lust. Her naked body shook because of Chelsea\u2019s wild thrusting. The two snow-white masses on her chest also almost flew up, like two bouncing bunnies.\u201cHmm. Slow down. Ah! Ah! Gently. Ah! Ah! Please, husband,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s every entry was as vigorous as if to tear her apart. However, the pleasure from the violent friction inside her walls kept driving her crazy. Under the double stimulation, Moussa became confused, tightening herself and begging for mercy.Chelsea ignored her pleas for mercy. His huge rod was thrusting fiercely inside her, and his eyes turned scarlet with desire.No one could tell how long it had been, but Moussa had already been f*cked by him several times. There was no strength left in her body, and she was completely soft under him. Her cries had turned into feeble whimpers.\u201cUhhh!\u201d Then, he pounded deep, making Moussa\u2019s vision go white as she felt herself coming again.\u201cRoar!\u201d Almost at the same time, Chelsea roared back and shot his load all the way up inside her.Chelsea was satisfied. After pressing on top of her to slow down for a while, he moved to give her sweaty little face small kisses. After kissing her for a time, Moussa felt the rod inside her harden again. She pulled it out and turned her limp body over to a crawling and kneeling position.\u201cTake a break. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d Moussa was unhappy that he was trying to torment her again so soon. She squirmed and refused to cooperate.\u201cSlap.\u201d Chelsea gave her a not-so-gentle two slaps on her little buttocks, warning, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Be a good girl, and keep your butt up. You promised to give me a baby. Be good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired to death. See who will give you a baby.\u201d Moussa mumbled, but she still cooperated by sticking her ass up. She suddenly felt something wrong. How could it be so fluffy? She glanced back in confusion and almost fainted from fear. Chelsea had transformed into a beast, holding the huge thing between her legs, which was several times larger than his human form.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa screamed. She didn\u2019t know where she got the strength, but she rolled to the edge of the bed and then dashed to the floor. She looked at Chelsea, trembling and frightened, shaking her head randomly, \u201cNo, no! No, Chelsea, I don\u2019t want to. If you dare to do it in beast form, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll bite my tongue and kill myself.\u201dOh my God, it was so horrible. Chelsea wanted to use the beast form that Moussa could not accept in any way. Earlier, she compromised and agreed to let him play with her because she loved him, but this was a human beast. Moussa would never agree to anything. If he used force despite her wishes, she would rather die in front of him than be ravaged to death by him.She began to wonder what kind of feelings Chelsea had for her in his heart. He doted on her, loved her, and shed tears because he was worried about her death. But every time she was hurt, it was him who got hurt despite her feelings. Now he didn\u2019t care about her life and death and even wanted to use his beast form to have it with her. Was she a wife in his heart who he could keep for the rest of his life, or was she just a pet for him to give vent to his desires?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He figured that he had been a little impatient. It seemed that the time had not yet come, and Chelsea had to slowly coax her to agree. So he transformed into a human form. He waved at her and softly coaxed, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t need the beast form. Good girl, come here.\u201dMoussa\u2019s heart was all over the place. She didn\u2019t dare to come close, fearing that he was coaxing her to relax her guard. If she hadn\u2019t noticed in time, she would have been forced down by him. Then he would turn into his beast form and move his way in, just like earlier.Chelsea saw she looked guarded. Knowing that she did not believe him, he sighed and assured, \u201cWife, I promise. If you won\u2019t nod and agree to let me use my beast form, I will never use it. It\u2019s OK, come on over. I am so hard.\u201dMoussa heard him say so relaxed her a little. She followed his gaze and saw that his great baton was standing up and trembling slightly.She swallowed unconsciously. That was the size she was struggling to cope with, right? She eyed the distance between Chelsea and her and glanced at the distance between her and the door. There should be a chance to run away.So she ran towards the door while saying, \u201cYou calm down for one night.\u201d\u201cLittle thing, you\u2019re so naughty.\u201d Unfortunately, Moussa had just touched the door when Chelsea caught her back. He picked her up by the waist and threw her back to the bed amidst her shrieks.\u201cI am not!\u201d Moussa was still struggling to get up when Chelsea pounced on her. He flipped her over and seized her tiny hips with his big hands, making her unable to move. The huge burning size rushed into her red and swollen p*ssy without warning.\u201cDon\u2019t! Ah ah!\u201d The sudden impact made Moussa scream out of breath. Her ten fingers tightened their grip on the animal skin beneath her.\u201cIf you won\u2019t let me use the beast form, then you\u2019ll have to do it with me all night.\u201d Chelsea nibbled on her snowy back as he decreed. His lower body sharply slapped the white flesh of her buttocks. Within a few seconds, Moussa\u2019s buttocks were red.\u201cMmm, ah!\u201d Moussa couldn\u2019t speak because of his high-speed banging. She threw back her head and moaned helplessly. Her elbows collapsed from his heavy ramming and couldn\u2019t support her. The two white masses on her chest reddened quickly because of the strong impact and the friction of the animal skin under her.Chelsea really did as he declared. Despite Moussa\u2019s cries and pleas, he tossed her all night long. Finally, Moussa couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The two holes below her were red and swollen due to his efforts, but his rod was still hard and not happy. There was no choice but to offer to use her mouth to help him solve the problem. Chelsea came again in Moussa\u2019s mouth. This was how she was spared.Moussa was nearly knocked back to sleep. Chelsea looked at the little sleeping person in his arms, murmuring something like, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar. You said you want to give me a baby, but you won\u2019t let me use the beast form, you little liar.\u201dAlthough he also wanted to have a baby like her, he was unwilling to force her if she really refused. After all, he was also a little worried that she could not withstand his beast form. However, when he thought that the elders of the tribe wanted to hurry things, it gave him some headache. Now it was okay to say that she was not here for a long time. However, when spring arrived, and her belly was still not moving, the elders would have to discuss their plans. Probably the elders would have to discuss the collective action. Inevitably, there would be another storm.But on second thought, there was nothing more. The big deal would be for Chelsea to stop being the chief of the tribe. If it still wouldn\u2019t work, he would take Moussa to another place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, as the chief of the tribe today, he still had to work for the welfare of the tribe, so he pulled the animal skin on one side to cover Moussa and got up from the bed. He went to the bathroom and freshened up, then opened the door to go out.Since he could not breed a new life for the tribe now, it would be good to help those beastmen who did not have partners. It would be good for them to breed a few more new lives for the tribe so that the elders would not be too much for him.When Moussa woke up, it was already afternoon. She had no idea where Chelsea had gone. She was aching all over her body, and the slightest movement made her want to cry.After a while of dawdling on the bed, she was so hungry that she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, so she reluctantly got up. She couldn\u2019t count how many times she hadn\u2019t eaten. Anyway, since the rainy season, Chelsea had been busy tossing her around, always making her hungry.She grabbed some fruit and ate it, and went to the bathroom to take a shower. She felt alive again.Chelsea was not at home. She looked around and felt a bit empty and wanted to see him right away. Realizing this thought made Moussa\u2019s face flush. How could she be like a young girl who had just fallen in love and felt as if she had not seen him for a while?Although shy, she still could not resist and went out to find him.Fortunately, the rain was not too heavy. There were still a few beastmen moving around outside. Moussa casually asked someone and was told that Chelsea was in the middle of the village open space there.When Moussa arrived, she could not help but be shocked by the scene in front of her. She only got up a little late, but the change was too big.A very tall pavilion was built out of thin air in the middle of the open space between the village. This was not the most surprising to Moussa. What surprised her most was that the younger generation were almost all gathered here. A table of four or five people was playing mahjong.Oh, dear. This was simply a mahjong hall, which really gave her a sense of time and space dislocation.Chelsea was looking down to teach a beastman how to play mahjong when suddenly as if sensing, he turned his head and saw Moussa standing dumbfounded at the door.He hooked the corners of his mouth and then called over to Ivy, instructing at another table. He told her to continue teaching the beastman and walked quickly to Moussa\u2019s side. He took her into his arms and asked softly, \u201cYou\u2019re awake. Have you eaten?\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d Moussa nodded stiffly. Pointing at the whole mess, she asked, somewhat incredulously, \u201cDid you do this?\u201dChelsea looked at her dumbfounded small face. She was so cute that he couldn\u2019t help but give her a deep kiss. Only when she was panting from the kiss did he let her go and look at the excited and smiling faces of the new females. He proudly said, \u201cHow about it. Your husband is smart, right?\u201dMoussa followed his gaze and realized that every new female fox had been accompanied by single males. Most of the males at the table with them were also singles, then it dawned on her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was really clever. If you played with them, you might have gotten attached to them.So, she smiled lightly and praised, \u201cHusband, you are great.\u201dChelsea smiled at her, then bowed his head to rub against her forehead. He urged her to pamper him, \u201cWife, I want a reward. You have to kiss me.\u201dMoussa originally wanted to avoid but caught a glimpse of Philo sitting not far from here looking this way. Therefore, her mind changed, and she stood on tiptoe to give him a kiss on the lips.Chelsea was satisfied. He pulled her to a random table and kicked a losing beastman off, and the two sat down to play.Considering Moussa\u2019s poor gambling luck, Chelsea was in charge. Moussa leaned on him while watching the game. Chelsea grabbed the tiles with one hand and rubbed her waist with the other to massage her. It was a sweet look that made others envious.Moussa felt a little hungry a few moments later. She nibbled a fruit from the pile next to her.Seeing that she had eaten all of his bets, Chelsea laughed lightly and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat, are you hungry?\u201dMoussa nodded. She swallowed the piece of fruit in her mouth and whined, \u201cI wonder who caused me to not eat much in the past two days. I just ate a few fruits today, so how could I not be hungry?\u201dWhen Chelsea heard this, he smiled and said, \u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s my fault. Next time I\u2019ll remember to let you eat. There\u2019s barbecue over there. I\u2019ll go get some for you to eat. You play for me.\u201dHe was about to get up, but Moussa pulled him back and stopped him. \u201cYou take over. I\u2019ll go get it myself.\u201d If she took over, she was afraid of losing all the family\u2019s fruits.Seeing her stand, Chelsea did not insist. Anyway, it was only a few steps, and he could see her when he looked up.No one knew who had thought of this so carefully. A long table was set up against the wall, with many pieces of roasted golden brown meat and water placed on it for the hungry players to take at will.Moussa\u2019s appetite increased after she smelled the roasted meat. She took a wooden bowl from the side, cut off a little bit of each piece, and put it into the bowl. She couldn\u2019t wait to go back to her seat and eat it in big bites. She was starving.After a few bites, she felt a little thirsty. She drank the water next to her and felt something was wrong when she finished drinking. She turned her head to look and saw Ryan standing next to her with his hand still in the cup-handing position.Moussa felt a little embarrassed and put the empty cup back in his hand.Ryan laughed lightly and asked softly, \u201cWant some more?\u201dMoussa shook her head. She pursed her lips and looked at him, not knowing what to say.Ryan laughed sadly at himself, \u201cWhat? You hate me so much that you won\u2019t even say a word to me?\u201d\u201cNo, Ryan, I.\u201d Moussa hurriedly retorted, but halfway through the sentence, she didn\u2019t know how to continue. Moussa was a very traditional woman. Since she had decided that Chelsea was her husband, she wouldn\u2019t take it lightly. Moussa liked Ryan a lot, but only as a friend. Therefore, she did not know how to face Ryan\u2019s feelings for her.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What are you talking about?\u201d Ryan was just about to speak when Chelsea intervened and possessively wrapped Moussa back into his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looks like I need to find a partner soon, too.\u201dThen he made a fist with his right hand and hammered Chelsea on the shoulder, teasing, \u201cChelsea, are you this stingy. You won\u2019t let Moussa talk to me anymore. You see, she\u2019s so scared she won\u2019t say a word to me.\u201dWhen he heard that Moussa did not say a word to him, Chelsea was a little proud. But he did not want him to see his complacency and spoke with an uncertain expression, \u201cI am not that stingy.\u201d Although his heart did not wish Moussa to care for Ryan, he seemed quite petty when the words came out.\u201cI told you that Chelsea is not that stingy. Don\u2019t stop talking to me in the future. I already know your choice, but we\u2019re still friends, right?\u201d It was driving him crazy not seeing her or hearing her voice all these days. As long as he could see her and hear her voice from time to time, he was willing to keep her as a friend.Moussa was relieved to hear that and nodded solemnly, \u201cOf course we are friends\u2026 very good friends.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right!\u201d Ryan smiled and nodded, but behind that smile was full of bitterness.\u201cAre you done eating? Let\u2019s go back. They\u2019re still waiting for us to continue.\u201d Chelsea said and nodded at Ryan, pulling Moussa away.Although Ryan said he only wanted to be friends with Moussa, he was still not dead. He did not like Moussa to be close to him, so he found an excuse to pull Moussa away.Moussa didn\u2019t forget to turn around and smile apologetically at Ryan, who also smiled back. That was enough. She was willing to talk to him and smile at him, and that was enough.The rainy season soon passed. Moussa and Chelsea were sweetly stuck together all day, but she was very wary of Chelsea\u2019s beastly form. Whenever Chelsea pressed her for a good time, she emphasized that \u201cno beastly form \u201ca few times.Chelsea\u2019s strategy to get everyone together to play mahjong was very successful. Only Philo was left among the eight females of the fox tribe. The remaining seven managed to find a partner to stay, which was an unprecedented harvest, and the lion tribe celebrated.When Philo left, Moussa was pleased, but she would not admit that she was jealous. Being jealous of a man was something she was still unable to accept.The end of the rainy season meant that autumn was coming. The village was busy. The males were busy hunting for more games to store up for the winter, and the females were active going out to pick wild fruits and herbs.There were enough wild fruits in the house that Moussa and Chelsea could not eat them all. Piling them together for a long time would be easy to spoil, so Moussa asked Chelsea to make her a big wooden barrel. Then the fruits were put inside and sealed up, thinking that maybe she could make a fruit wine.A major event also happened, that was, Ivy got pregnant. Sander was so happy that he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut all day and strictly forbade Ivy to go out of the village. He also went to Chelsea and asked Moussa to stay with Ivy to relieve her boredom.Moussa was very curious about the matter of Ivy\u2019s pregnancy. Although she knew that this was a male-male world, the man was undoubtedly the one giving birth to the child. However, there was still a big difference between knowing and seeing with one\u2019s own eyes; a man giving birth to a child was really too \u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She really wanted to know where the child was without a uterus, but she didn\u2019t have the heart to ask. In fact, even if she did, Ivy wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to answer.Ivy got embarrassed as she looked at her. She blurted out in shame, \u201cHave you seen enough? Have you looked all morning?\u201d\u201cEr, sorry, sorry.\u201d Moussa returned to her senses awkwardly. She did not mean to be like this, but she was really curious.She hurriedly asked with a smiling face, \u201cIvy, are you hungry? I will make stew for you?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Ivy relaxed on the bed, half squinting eyes and nodding in agreement.Moussa left, thinking, \u201cThis pregnant woman\u2026 no, a pregnant man has to be comfortable. He doesn\u2019t have to do any work. He has this little maid to wait on him.Then she resigned herself to make the stew and went, saying that she did not want to go out to pick wild fruits by herself without Ivy\u2019s company. It was very dull, so she could take advantage of this job of taking care of the pregnant man. It was justified for her not to go out to pick wild fruits.The two of them had a delicious lunch. Ivy was a little sleepy, so she lay down on the bed and fell asleep.Moussa had nothing to do and did not want to sleep with her. She felt uncomfortable lying in a bed with a man who was not Chelsea and thought it was better to go to her small vegetable garden and see how it was growing. Although she knew that he was a female, he was a man in appearance.Moussa could not help but be shocked to see that the small vegetable garden somehow became a large vegetable garden. Moreover, it was clean and neat, not a single weed, and at a glance, it was clear that someone had taken good care of it.Chelsea? No, indeed not him. He stayed by her side as soon as he came back. He didn\u2019t have time to do this, and he wasn\u2019t that meticulous. Then it must be Ryan. Moussa was touched and guilty in her heart. She didn\u2019t expect Ryan to do this for her silently, but she really had nothing to give back.With a sigh, she turned around and went back to the house. She took a beast bone out and carefully dug under the plants, and pulled out several sweet potatoes. To her surprise, the sweet potatoes here were big and many. She didn\u2019t expect that she would succeed in planting them.Moussa was so happy that she rushed back to the house. She took a big basket with her and got all the sweet potatoes out. The entire harvest was two baskets. She saved one basket to plant and took out half of the other basket to prepare for everyone to eat tonight. She also prepared to send some to Ryan. After all, he was the one who contributed the most to this garden.She went to the garden and found something like potatoes, and the corn seemed to be getting ripe. The cotton was also about to bloom. Moussa felt crazy with joy, not realizing that her little garden was also rich.Moussa worked in the small vegetable garden in the afternoon. Looking up to see the sky darkened, she thought the beastmen would be back soon. So she carried a few sweet potatoes and ran to Ryan\u2019s door, standing there waiting for him to return.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His heart moved and suddenly accelerated his steps. When he saw that the small figure was really Moussa, he unconsciously slowed down the speed.She looked like a female standing in front of the house anxiously waiting for her partner returning late. Although he knew it was only his self-deception or just a dream, he still hoped that this dream would be longer. It would be best not to wake up.Moussa was anxiously waiting for Ryan to come back. Although she only came to give him sweet potatoes, the passersby looked at her with strange eyes as if she was doing something terrible behind Chelsea\u2019s back. But Moussa was also a little afraid that Chelsea would catch sight of her. She was cautious. Although he would not say anything, he would bully her harder in bed if he saw her. For every time she was forced, she was miserable.She was still worried when she saw Ryan coming from afar. She was so happy that she ran to him with a smile.Ryan saw her running towards him from a distance and hurriedly vaulted to her. Although he enjoyed the way she ran towards him, he couldn\u2019t let her work hard in the end.Moussa was not prepared for his sudden appearance in front of her. For a moment, she could not stop her steps and ran straight to his arms. Surprised, she took two steps backward, and the sweet potatoes she was holding fell to the ground.Moussa looked embarrassed to see his hand raised in preparation to help her. She was annoyed that she had overreacted.Ryan smiled at her and put his hand down. He said softly, \u201cWatch yourself when you are in a hurry. This is for me.\u201d While saying this, he squatted and picked up the sweet potatoes.Moussa came back to her senses and also squatted to pick the sweet potatoes together. While picking them up, she said excitedly, \u201cRyan, you know what. My small vegetable garden has a lot of sweet potatoes, thanks to you. If you hadn\u2019t helped me take care of it, it would not have grown so well. I came to you with a few. Tell you what, these sweet potatoes, roasted or boiled, are very delicious. \u201d\u201cThank you, Moussa, for bringing these to me.\u201d Ryan stood and received all the sweet potatoes in Moussa\u2019s hand. Then he softly thanked her. In fact, he wanted her to do it for him, but unfortunately, he could not say it because he was not qualified.\u201cOh.\u201d Moussa saw the gentle gaze of his eyes filled with affection. She suddenly felt a little embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to say. She smiled and looked away, but she saw Chelsea standing not far away. He was watching them with a gloomy face.Moussa secretly screamed crap. Really, why was she so unlucky? Moussa wouldn\u2019t do anything bad, but she was caught every time. Although she didn\u2019t do anything bad, Chelsea acted as if she had done something terrible every time.She jumped to his arms and said, \u201cHusband, you are back. Let\u2019s go to Ivy\u2019s house for dinner, okay? I dug up a lot of sweet potatoes in the garden today. I\u2019ll do it for you, okay? I gave some to Ryan just now because he has been helping me take care of the vegetable garden.\u201d Moussa tactfully explained to him what had just happened, hoping he wouldn\u2019t misunderstand.Chelsea did not say anything. He greeted Ryan as usual and then walked home with the prey in one hand and pulled Moussa with the other.Moussa couldn\u2019t tell if Chelsea was angry or not, but she tried to be nice. \u201cHusband, you\u2019ve hunted so much today. It\u2019s great. You\u2019re great.\u201dMoussa praised him, but Chelsea did not talk. He dragged her all the way home, and as soon as he entered the house, the prey was thrown to the ground. He pressed her against the door and kissed her little mouth that had been chattering.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He dragged her all the way home, and as soon as he entered the house, the prey was thrown to the ground. He pressed her against the door and kissed her little mouth that had been chattering \u2026\u2026\u201cMmm. Husband, not. Ah!\u201d Moussa was sweating. Both hands clung to his shoulders, her nails almost dug into Chelsea\u2019s flesh. Her long hair swirled as her body swayed up and down while her hole continued to gobble up Chelsea\u2019s huge thing.\u201cLittle thing, you\u2019d better keep your voice down. Mmm. Otherwise, people passing by will know what we\u2019re doing. Hiss, are you going to strangle me? Relax.\u201d Chelsea smiled wickedly and drew out his huge stick from her hole, thrusting shallowly. Then, while Moussa breathed a sigh of relief, he suddenly pushed in hard.\u201cAhhh!\u201d Moussa was stimulated by his sudden strong attack, screaming involuntarily. Then she remembered his warning and hurriedly pursed her lips to suppress the whimpers. Her body involuntarily spasmed, fingers gripping Chelsea\u2019s shoulders, trying to distract the intense stimulation of her lower body that she could not stand.Unfortunately, her suppressed whimpering stimulated Chelsea\u2019s wild desire. His few remaining senses burned out, and his mind was filled with the thought of f*cking the petite person in front of him to death. He pushed his stick fiercely against Moussa\u2019s hole one after another, making a popping sound.\u201cGently. Chelsea, too deep. You gently. Oooooo.\u201d Moussa was forced to cry in a low voice by his increasingly rough movements. The occasional sound of the beastmen talking from outside the door also made her nervous. Her hole unconsciously contracted and sucked on the bad thing that was rampaging inside and that she loved and hated.Chelsea was stimulated by this clenching and sucking of hers to become even more frantic. Ignoring her pleas for mercy, his stick became even harder. It stretched hers to the limit again and again, as if it would never stop.Just as Moussa was f*cked by him so hard that she arched her body and was about to reach the extreme, she suddenly heard someone shouting outside the door, \u201cMoussa, Ivy said you were going to make sweet potatoes for her to eat and asked you to come over quickly\u2026 are you there?\u201dMoussa was startled. Her whole body froze. Chelsea was also shocked and stopped moving in annoyance. He shouted angrily at the door, \u201cGetaway. Don\u2019t come in.\u201dSander was about to step to the door when Chelsea\u2019s roar startled him. Then he realized that the two people in the house were doing something. Sander scratched his head in embarrassment and hurriedly retreated a few steps. On second thought, he looked back and took a deep breath, and shouted, \u201cChelsea, speed up. Ivy said she was hungry and wanted to eat the sweet potatoes Moussa prepared.\u201d After saying that, he ran away as if he were running away for his life.\u201cMmm.\u201d It was too embarrassing for Sander to find out that she and Chelsea were doing this kind of thing. Annoyed, she bit hard against Chelsea\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHiss,\u201d Chelsea was unprepared and breathed in. He immediately retaliated by viciously hitting her twice.Moussa moaned at his thrusts. She pinched him in shame and annoyance. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d\u201cMy big stick is still hard. How do you want me to go out? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea smiled evilly and used the stick inside Moussa\u2019s to viciously thrust it in and out.\u201cThen. You hurry up, ah! Mmm. Too deep. You gently, ah!\u201d Moussa was held against the door. She couldn\u2019t break free, so she begged him to come out quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As you wish.\u201d Chelsea laughed in response. Then he moved fiercely, as fast as an electric motor. Moussa\u2019s whole body was about to break apart. Her breathing became ragged, her legs were helplessly flailing, and her body was bowed and pushed upward.Chelsea madly thrust a few hundred times, that Moussa moaned less and less, looking like fainting again. Then a violent impact of hot seeds was shot into hers.After the passion, Moussa hung limp on top of Chelsea, whose expression was still a bit sullen. Moussa sighed. This lion was really cautious. After thinking about it, she explained, \u201cHusband, I really only think of Ryan as a friend, so don\u2019t be jealous.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Who\u2019s jealous?\u201d When Chelsea was seen through his heart, he looked down and bit at her sweaty little face, a little annoyed.\u201cYes, yes, yes, you are not jealous. I am talking nonsense, so you can take out that thing of yours now.\u201d Moussa helplessly said, following him, but his awkward look was pretty cute.\u201cWhat is that thing. It\u2019s a big contributor to your happiness. Want to kiss it, eh?\u201d Chelsea was getting hot again from what she said. He teased her by rubbing the two lumps on her chest.\u201cYou. Mmmm. Stinky lion.\u201d Moussa knew what he was up to and hammered him hard. \u201cGet it out. I promised Ivy that I would cook sweet potatoes for her, and she\u2019s waiting.\u201d\u201cThen come back tonight, and you have to kiss it,\u201d Chelsea spoke in a threatening tone, with the intention of not letting her go if she disagreed.\u201cYou,\u201d Moussa blushed and glared at him. He was a lion, full of thoughts of that kind of thing. Although she thought so, she still nodded in a compromised manner.\u201cNot only do you need to kiss it, but you also need to lick it well and suck it,\u201d Chelsea demanded.\u201cOkay, okay, whatever you say. You take it out first.\u201d Moussa felt that he was getting hard again. She was afraid that he would do it again, so she nodded.Seeing that she had agreed, Chelsea then reluctantly pulled out.Without his stick, the white fluid flowed out of hers and slid down her thighs. Moussa hurriedly rushed inside the bathroom with her bowed back, covering herself.Chelsea\u2019s body was hot, and his stick was hard again, so he chased her to the bathroom and pressed her against the wall of the tub, forcing her to have another go.It was already dark when Moussa finally baked the sweet potato and sent it to Ivy to eat. There was no clock here, so Moussa didn\u2019t know how long it had been. But looking at Ivy\u2019s teasing gaze, Moussa couldn\u2019t wait to find a crack in the ground.Ivy took advantage of Chelsea and Sander\u2019s inattention. She whispered in Moussa\u2019s ear and said, \u201cMoussa, Chelsea is very powerful. It lasted so long. You were thrilled to be f*cked, right? Say, how many times did he f*ck you? Three times or four times? It made me starve to death waiting.\u201dOh God, let her die. Moussa was dying of shame. She was so embarrassed because of that lion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they went home together, Moussa was still sulking over what Chelsea had just done to embarrass her. She kept her mouth shut and refused to pay attention to him.Chelsea pulled her over and held her in his arms. He kissed and caressed her for a while, but Moussa was squirming and twisting and refused to cooperate.Chelsea got fired up by her squirming and directly picked her up and threw her on the bed. Then he yanked the animal skin skirt and jumped on the bed with her.He pulled her to sit up, placed her hand on his thick, stiff rod, and laughed evilly as he moved it up and down. \u201cBaby, you promised to kiss it, lick it and suck it to make me cum,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, open your mouth and lick it well.\u201d While saying this, he brought his stick to Moussa\u2019s mouth, rubbing the large glans against Moussa\u2019s lips.Moussa glared at him with grief. He was a lion, but he remembered such things very well.However, looking at his expression of you dare not do it then try, she dared not cheat. Reluctantly, she opened her mouth to envelope the huge thing. Little by little, she carefully licked it.\u201cMmm, so comfortable. Good girl. A bit further back. Slowly, lick all over, um. That\u2019s it.\u201d Chelsea gasped in comfort. He looked down at his huge rod of flesh glistening under her licking. He became more excited, so did his rod of flesh, which had grown another size, making it more difficult for Moussa\u2019s small mouth to contain it.\u201cTake your time, and make your mouth a little bigger. How about we try to take it all in today? What do you think? Roll up your tongue. That\u2019s it. Okay, I\u2019m going in.\u201d Chelsea said, cupping Moussa\u2019s face and slowly inserting his long thick rod into Moussa\u2019s mouth bit by bit.Moussa felt his stick up to her throat. Her mouth was full, her lips and the skin of her cheeks were sore and uncomfortable. The saliva that she couldn\u2019t swallow was trickling out, and the gagging and awful feeling came together, making Moussa feel like reaching out and pushing Chelsea\u2019s waist to get him to pull out.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Baby, is it too deep? What? But you haven\u2019t swallowed the whole thing yet. Come on, take a deep breath and exhale slowly through your nose. That\u2019s right.\u201d Chelsea withdrew a little bit. When she was not so uncomfortable, he slowly pushed in a little bit. Although he was uncomfortable, her mouth was too tight. It was tighter than her flower, and he did not want to hurt her.Moussa slowly inhaled and felt less uncomfortable. She tried to relax her body and let him go deeper little by little.\u201cGood, baby. So good. Feel it. The stick is already inside your esophagus. It\u2019s so comfortable. It\u2019s like a million little hands are dragging it inside. Oh, it\u2019s so comfortable.\u201d Chelsea half-squinted in enjoyment, feeling her constant strangulation.Moussa felt her esophagus burning with pain, but the invasion of the foreign object made her swallow unconsciously, wrapping Chelsea\u2019s rod even tighter.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t clench so tightly. Open your mouth a little more. It\u2019s about to go all the way in. Okay, be good.\u201d Chelsea said as he slowly inserted the entire thick rod into Moussa\u2019s mouth with all his sanity controlling the speed.\u201cMmm,\u201d the feeling of being sick and in pain caused Moussa to struggle, pushing Chelsea\u2019s waist. Sob, she was so uncomfortable! It was so painful that Moussa was dying. However, her mouth was blocked, and she couldn\u2019t say anything. She was not able to say anything, and her tears flowed out uncontrollably.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then all rationality was gone, leaving his body under the control of desire. He began to violently thrust in and out. Each time the large glans hit heavily into Moussa\u2019s esophagus, Moussa\u2019s tears fell more quickly.\u201cSo good. So tight. F*cking you to death. F*cking to loosen your little mouth and make you suck so hard. Sticking it in you!\u201dMoussa\u2019s constantly tightening mouth along with the rapid breathing of a loosening Chelsea\u2019s rod couldn\u2019t make him comfortable. The extinguishing pleasure made Chelsea speed up his thrusts and even yell lascivious words that made Moussa incredibly ashamed.\u201cAh!\u201d Moussa\u2019s hand that kept pushing against his waist accidentally pressed heavily on his scrotum, arousing Chelsea into groaning.\u201cSo exciting, baby. If you want me to come soon, use both hands to hold it and rub it gently. Yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d Under the double stimulation of Moussa\u2019s tiny mouth and small hands, Chelsea felt his lower back and eyes tingling after a dozen more hard thrusts. He pressed Moussa\u2019s head tightly against his rod with both hands. With a violent shake, a stream of hot semen shot all into Moussa\u2019s mouth, which lasted for several minutes.Chelsea did not let his grip on Moussa loose until he had finished cumming. Once he let go, Moussa could not hold her breath any longer and pushed him away. She coughed violently on the side of the bed, and the cloudy white semen mixed with snot and tears all came out. It was a sorry state of affairs as her whole face was a mess.Chelsea was so happy after, but seeing her in such a difficult situation was also painful for him. He hurried down to the floor to get a piece of wet animal skin to help her wipe her face clean and then gave her a cup of water.Moussa took the cup of water and rinsed her mouth. That strange taste in her mouth got washed away. She drank two more mouthfuls and moistened her throat. Only then did she feel alive again. Looking at Chelsea\u2019s handsome face after committing aggression, she was outraged.She pounced on him and pinned him down on the bed. She pinched and scratched and bit him so that his chest and back were scratches and teeth marks.Moussa did not stop until she was panting and too tired to move anymore. She lay on the bed and stared at him with hatred.Chelsea sat up somewhat mournfully. Looking down to examine the bruises on his body, he whined, \u201cWife, you\u2019re getting more and more violent.\u201d\u201cHum!\u201d Moussa grunted. She gave him another vicious glare and turned her head away from him, no longer paying attention.Chelsea caught her vicious glare. The rogue faced her again, rubbing behind her two times, pleading, \u201cWife,\u201d it was not enough to make her look like a spitfire, and it got him hot all over again.\u201cPah!\u201d Moussa slapped hard his big hand that attacked her chest and warned in a somewhat hoarse voice, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me tonight, or I\u2019ll show you.\u201dChelsea saw that she was furious. He retracted his hand and patted her twice, saying, \u201cOkay, no touching, no touching. Sleep, you\u2019ll sleep with me in my arms, okay?\u201dMoussa did not say anything. She relaxed in his arms and slowly fell asleep. Chelsea listened to her breathing that gradually stabilized, and dropped a kiss on her shoulder. As he drifted off to sleep, he curled the corners of his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ivy\u2019s belly gradually grew, and Moussa devoted herself to her vegetable garden every day, in addition to taking care of her.After countless failures, Moussa finally succeeded in spinning a ball of yarn. Although it was not enough to weave a dress, a little goes a long way. Looking at this hard-earned cotton yarn, Moussa was thrilled. She believed that she would be able to successfully make a dress next year before winter came.The weather gradually became colder. The tribe was even busier, leaving early and returning late every day to prepare food for the winter.Chelsea was also busy. Not only did he have to go out hunting, but when he returned, he had to take the males around the village to build the fortification. Because of the lack of food in winter, there were inevitably hungry and crazy beasts that would attack the village.With the first snowfall, winter officially arrived. The village also held the usual welcome party again. This time, because of the strong recommendation of the fox females who stayed behind, as well as the attraction of mahjong, chess, backgammon, and other fun games, almost all of the dozen females from the fox tribe stayed for the winter, causing the males who did not have a partner in the tribe to cheer.However, Moussa was not too comfortable because Philo was also listed. She felt sour in her heart and lost her temper with Chelsea in private. Moreover, Philo had nothing to do to Chelsea\u2019s side. On the contrary, Chelsea took her down on the bed and bullied her. She pinched and bit him violently, but Chelsea\u2019s skin was thick and didn\u2019t matter at all.In fact, Chelsea was not unaware of her little thoughts. But for one thing, Philo often appeared beside him and did not do anything too much. For another, he enjoyed Moussa\u2019s little jealous expression. That was why nothing was said, and she was allowed to act like a little wildcat. When she got tired of it, she was pushed down on the bed. She cried for mercy and no longer had the energy to make trouble.\u201cAh! Husband, you hurry! Ah ah ah!\u201d The hoarse and raspy moans and gasps continuously sound from the big messy bed.Moussa\u2019s soft and white fingers gripped the animal skin beneath her. Her small buttocks buckled upwards, bearing the violent impact behind her. She panted and moaned intermittently because of the violent impact.The blushing and tear-stained face were pressed helplessly against the animal skin beneath her, rubbing in response to the force of the ramming behind her. Her naked body was covered with red and purple hickeys, from her neck to her smooth back, to the roots of her thighs, all of which were marked by bites.The two soft masses on her chest were also covered with finger marks and nibble marks. But the most unbearable thing was between her legs. She was forced to gulp down his huge stick. She was already stretched to the limit, and with each deep withdrawal, white fluid dripped from her onto the white animal skin, which was lewd and seductive.Chelsea held her waist firmly with his two large hands as she sat back while he pushed forward. This position and movement allowed the huge object in his crotch to poke deeper and heavier.With each poke, Moussa, who had already fallen into ecstasy, let out a pitiful sob, \u201cAh! Spare me! Please. Beg. Please. Ah!\u201dChelsea\u2019s wet silver-white hair stuck to his forehead. The original cold-hearted face showed a soothing expression, staring hard at the small person underneath. His eyes had a hot desire that could not be concealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each time he penetrated further, Moussa moaned with pain and pleasure. Her body lost balance because of his violent impact and fell limply on the animal skin beneath her.\u201cLittle thing, still dare to make trouble and not let me touch you? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea crouched over her to nibble on her shoulder, revealing a wicked grin that was full of satisfaction after the conquest.\u201cDon\u2019t dare. Ah! Never dare again. Ah! Spare me, please.\u201d The indescribable pleasure and soreness and pain intertwined, making Moussa completely subdued.\u201cBaby, you\u2019re so good!\u201d After hearing the desired answer, Chelsea gave a dozen more swift thrusts and finally straightened his upper body. He roared and shot a stream of hot liquid inside her.After the passion, Moussa felt very aggrieved. She sobbed and turned away from him. It was clearly his fault. Even if he didn\u2019t apologize and admit his mistake, he used despicable means to force her to beg for mercy.Chelsea watched her sobbing and shaking shoulders. Amused, he wrapped his arms around her from behind and said gently, \u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying? What\u2019s the matter? Hmm?\u201d Moussa ignored him and continued to cry. She didn\u2019t struggle and obediently let him hold her.The more she struggled, the more excited he would be. In the end, it was her who would be unlucky.\u201cOkay, don\u2019t be aggrieved. I\u2019ll take you out for revenge, okay?\u201d Chelsea could not help but curl the corners of his mouth to see her aggrieved look. It seemed that she was bullied a little hard by him just now, and now she felt aggrieved. So he kissed her twice on the shoulder and soothed her.\u201cHmm?\u201d Moussa was stunned at his words. Revenge, revenge for what? She did not have a grudge against anyone. She couldn\u2019t help but look back at him curiously.Chelsea kissed her on the lips and laughed. \u201cCome with me if you want to know.\u201d After saying this, he went down from the bed. He found Moussa\u2019s animal skin cloak, boots, animal skin hat, animal skin gloves, and animal skin knee pads before winter. He helped her put them on one by one and wrapped Moussa up and down in an airtight manner.He got a long animal skin skirt around his lower body, and his upper body was topless. Then he picked up a cloak and put it on his shoulders, and took a net made of animal fibers, and pulled Moussa\u2019s little hand to go outside.Moussa was pulled by him and walked a long way to the frozen river. Chelsea let Moussa sit on the bank of a strong tree branch to wait for him.Then he jumped to the river\u2019s surface and swiped a few times to dig a large hole on the thick ice. Then he threw the net in his hand to the water, quickly collecting it and throwing it to the shore.A dozen fish with hideous faces were struggling for their lives in the net. Moussa let out a small cry of surprise. It turned out that the revenge Chelsea said was to seek revenge on these fish. He really had a grudge.Not a moment later, the fish thrown to the shore out of the water stopped struggling. Chelsea then went over and dumped their bodies out of the net and then started a new round of fishing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moussa was a little sleepy, but he did not stop. It was as if he wanted to kill all the fish in the river before he would stop.Moussa could not stand it anymore, so she sat on a tree branch and said to Chelsea from a distance, \u201cChelsea, that\u2019s enough. It\u2019s too much. We can\u2019t eat it all.\u201d The fish carcasses on the shore were spread out in several layers. It would take a long time to eat them all, and how in the end would they be transported back to the village?Hearing this from her, Chelsea obediently stopped his action. He scurried to the tree branch two or three times. Sitting down next to her, he gasped and said, \u201cIs that enough?\u201d Then he glanced at the shore, then nodded and said, \u201cLooks like a lot. Now you can eat fish soup for as long as you want.\u201dMoussa got those black lines. \u201cThese fish will go bad in a few days. Winter is better. You can freeze them. When spring comes, you can\u2019t put them in.\u201d Without refrigerators here, storing food in hot weather was a major problem.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Chelsea also thought of this problem. In the past, they came back from hunting and ate the leftover parts to avoid spoilage. They would pickle them, but the taste was worse. The fish had to be preserved, which was a little tricky.\u201cRight, I thought of it. Chelsea, we can make a big cold storage. So that in the future, you can always freeze the leftover meat.\u201d A sudden flash of brilliance came to Moussa. Although there was no refrigerator here, so much ice in the river could make an icehouse.After hearing Moussa\u2019s idea, Chelsea thought it was feasible. He said he would do it. First, Chelsea took the shape of a beast and carried Moussa back to the village. Then he summoned his men and divided them into three groups, digging the cellar, transporting the ice, and collecting the fish.Seeing that she had nothing to do, Moussa went to Ivy\u2019s house to chat with her. In addition, check out and study the little baby in her belly.When it was almost dark, Chelsea and Sander came back. Once they entered the house, Moussa ran over, grabbed Chelsea\u2019s arm, and shook it, asking, \u201cHave you finished the ice house?\u201dChelsea reached and pinched her little nose, replying, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all done. Want to go check it out?\u201d\u201cHmm. Wait, let\u2019s eat first. I have everything ready, and when we finish eating, you can show me.\u201dMoussa saw that his face was a bit tired. She knew that he must be exhausted, so she pulled him to sit down at the table and then served him dinner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He fed Ivy the food little by little with a gentle expression.Moussa wondered, \u201cThere is nothing to say about this male to his female. This is just a few months pregnant, but he is so concerned and protective. Even feeding, he is too considerate.\u201dAfter the two finished eating, they came out of Ivy\u2019s house. Chelsea brought Moussa around to the hillside behind the village. It took seven twists and turns to go to a very hidden cave. After moving the big stone at the cave\u2019s mouth, Moussa felt a rush of cold air. She didn\u2019t expect him to choose the location of the ice house here. You must first pass through the village and use the big stone to seal the cave entrance to come here. So it was really safe enough.The further they went, the colder it got. Moussa couldn\u2019t help but shrink into Chelsea\u2019s arms. Chelsea simply wrapped her up in his arms by ripping off the entire cloak.After walking about 50 meters, the cave suddenly widened. Looking up, Moussa saw a circle of ice bricks placed neatly along the cave\u2019s perimeter straight to the top of the cave. The ice bricks were surrounded by a lot of ice troughs in front of ice bricks. The fish Chelsea caught in the morning were frozen inside, and the bottom of the cave was also paved with a thick layer of ice. The area around and underneath was constantly expelling cool air. Wow, what a big ice house! It was also gorgeous and felt like a crystal palace.Moussa liked it. She pulled Chelsea and walked around on the ice. Although Moussa wore animal skin boots under her feet, Moussa still felt the cold soles of her feet. She looked at Chelsea and was jealous that he didn\u2019t feel cold at all with his bare feet. So she put both of her feet on his feet with bad intentions and then wrapped her arms around his waist and let him lead the way.\u201cYou\u2019re a naughty girl.\u201d Chelsea laughed and chided. He doted on her and kissed her.\u201cHmm,\u201d Moussa suddenly felt a chill on her chest. He actually put his hand inside her dress and rubbed her breasts. She struggled in shame.\u201cBaby, I want you. Give me that, okay?\u201d Chelsea let go of her lips and licked the sensitive skin under her ear. With a lust-stained husky voice, he seduced her.Moussa wanted to cry. He was too sexually active. How could he think of that kind of thing whenever he saw her, no matter where he was. Helplessly, she hammered his chest and said. \u201cGo home! Let\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to do it here. I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day,\u201d said Chelsea. Whether she agreed or not, Chelsea kissed her passionately on the ice with force like fire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His one hand was around her waist so she couldn\u2019t move, and his other hand went down and pulled at the little ball of flesh at her flower.Although Moussa was reluctant, her body had already become familiar with his touch. After a few strokes, she became wet, causing Chelsea to mock her softly, \u201cYou\u2019re getting wet so fast. You\u2019re excited here too, aren\u2019t you?\u201dMoussa was so ashamed, but she couldn\u2019t resist his strength. Seeing that he was determined to be here, she simply didn\u2019t struggle anymore. She closed her eyes and acted like an ostrich, letting him toss and turn. She really hated this increasingly sensitive body.\u201cBaby, open your eyes. If you don\u2019t open them, I\u2019ll keep doing it until you do.\u201d Chelsea flipped her over to propped up with her hands on the ice bricks, and her feet spread wide apart. He bullied her from behind, wrapping one hand around her breasts and rubbing her snow-white plumpness as he stuck one hand into her womanhood and worked it up.\u201cMmmm,\u201d Moussa felt weak from his repeated stimulation. Knowing that he always did what he said he would do, she was forced to open her eyes.The moment she opened her eyes, Chelsea withdrew his fingers and said, \u201cBaby, watch how I f*ck you.\u201d Then with a thrust, he pushed in hard from behind.\u201cAh! Hurts,\u201d Chelsea was always impatient to do foreplay. Moussa was not wet enough yet, he rushed in. Moussa shouted in pain when he got in.\u201cGood girl, endure a little.\u201d Hearing her shouting in pain, Chelsea slowed down the speed. He slowly went deeper and deeper.\u201cMmm. Bad, you always \u2026\u2026 make me endure a little. Mmm. Yourself why. Not. Not. Not. Mmm. Hold back,\u201d Moussa complained as she gasped in pain.\u201cBaby, who made you so tempting? I can\u2019t hold back even if I want to. See how l do it.\u201d Chelsea laughed lightly and held Moussa\u2019s head with one hand, forcing her to look directly at the blood-curdling image reflected on the ice brick.The picture was so lustful that Moussa could clearly see her flower trembling slightly as it swallowed his huge member bit by bit.\u201cMmm,\u201d the lewd picture stimulated Moussa. She couldn\u2019t help but moan. Her flower kept flowing again.\u201cBaby, is it nice? You see how gluttonous you are. You actually ate the whole thing.\u201d Chelsea verbally stimulated her while he started thrusting hard.Moussa saw that every time he pulled out, a bright red tender flesh could be rolled out as if countless tiny tentacles were desperately trying to retain him. When he pushed in, they all retracted again. This picture was too exciting. Moussa could not stand it and wanted to turn her head away, but Chelsea held her head to prevent her from moving. She had no choice but to tilt her head back and softly beg him, \u201cDon\u2019t talk, please. Don\u2019t talk!\u201d\u201cOkay, baby, I won\u2019t say anything. Watch carefully and see how I f*ck you, huh?\u201d Chelsea said and started thrusting hard.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Moussa felt her flower was on fire from the friction of his hot rod. She raised her breasts uncomfortably, and her hands, which were propped up on the ice bricks, lost their strength, and her whole body was stuck to the ice bricks.\u201cHiss,\u201d Moussa\u2019s entire upper body was pressed against the ice brick. The cold touch gave her a jolt, and her flower involuntarily tightened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He pulled her up from the ice brick, then pushed her forward even harder. Then he pulled her back again, and so on, making the softness of her breasts keep hitting the ice brick, then leaving and hitting it again.Moussa kept twitching. Her breasts seemed to have been frozen numb. The coldness in her chest and the heat beneath her tortured her viciously at the same time, making her cry out loud, \u201cAhhhhh! Don\u2019t. Chelsea. I can\u2019t stand it, ah! It\u2019s so unbearable. Oooh.\u201d\u201cUnbearable? Baby, where are you uncomfortable? Hmm?\u201d Chelsea asked as he slowed down his movements and withdrew a little, thrusting shallowly at her.\u201cOooh. Chest. So cold,\u201d Moussa said tearfully, sobbing and choking.Chelsea reached out and touched it. It was indeed freezing. Somewhat distressed, he pulled himself out. He turned her over, picked her up, and put her on the floor where the animal skin cloak was laid. Then he spread her legs to the maximum and rammed back in and ground slowly. His entire body was pressed against her, helping her to cover the coldness in her chest.\u201cSo heavy,\u201d Moussa tilted her head and gasped. It was so slow, itchy, and hot down there. She wanted to twist her waist to avoid it, but he pressed down heavily on it so she couldn\u2019t move. It seemed like the air in her lungs was being squeezed out by him.\u201cLittle thing, is it still cold?\u201d Chelsea could not help but ask with a ragged gasp.\u201cNot cold. Ah!\u201d Moussa hadn\u2019t finished speaking when she screamed out in shock from one of his deep thrusts.\u201cThen let\u2019s change positions.\u201d Chelsea sat up and set Moussa\u2019s legs on both of his shoulders. He grabbed her slim waist and rammed it ferociously.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d Chelsea pounded hard and fast, causing Moussa to feel indescribable tingling from deep within. Her body began to tense uncontrollably, and her orgasm hit her rapidly. She shuddered and came hard.\u201cUhhh! Aah!\u201d Moussa screamed in orgasm as Chelsea continued to pound deep, losing her consciousness.The two people\u2019s copulation was accompanied by the sound of plopping and slapping, constantly emanating a unique smell. Moussa\u2019s small buttocks shook violently, and their traces dripped down to the animal skin on the ground. Moussa\u2019s screams became more and more seductive.Chelsea felt that it was not enough. He pressed her legs down again, and Moussa\u2019s whole body was pressed into a V-shape by him.\u201cAh!\u201d The sudden change of position made Moussa wake up slightly. The illusion that her waist was going to be broken made her scream, \u201cDon\u2019t! Ah!\u201dChelsea, at the moment, had been red-eyed. He simply ignored her don\u2019t want to and slammed her into the ice bricks constantly. Moussa\u2019s whole body was squeezed into a tiny ball, and her long white legs flailed carelessly but could not shake him half a point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You are so good. So strong. Oooh! Spare me, ah!\u201d\u201cSo deep, ah! So much, no!\u201d\u201cOooh. Gently, ah! Slow down, please. Husband. Ah ah ah ah!\u201dMoussa whimpered and cried. She shouted all the words she could think of at the moment, but it still didn\u2019t work. Chelsea couldn\u2019t stop the force and pounded her fast and hard. She was so bent and wet, dripping with juice.Eventually, Moussa had no choice but to reach down and grab Chelsea\u2019s lower body, rubbing it gently.Chelsea really did not resist her trick and ruthlessly impaled a few times and came.He then laid Moussa on her back and panted roughly on top of her. When he got over his breath, he then bit Moussa hard on her shoulders. He glared at her fiercely and said through gritted teeth, \u201cYou little devil, you made me come so quickly again.\u201dMoussa\u2019s eyes glittered with tears. She turned her head away and ignored him, but in her heart, she complained. \u201cThat\u2019 s what you call fast? If you had been slower, I would have been killed by you.\u201d There was no clock here, so she didn\u2019t know precisely how long it took him.However, she knew based on the feeling that it would never be less than an hour. Besides, Chelsea was very impatient to do foreplay. Occasionally, on a whim, he would tease her to beg him to enter. However, the rest of the time, he would not do a few minutes of foreplay, and then he would take the gun.Moussa felt that she was being tossed around by him every day, yet she was still healthy and alive. It was a miracle.Chelsea pressed Moussa and kissed her for a while, then helped her put her clothes back on and carried her out. Although he wanted to do it again, this place was really too cold. He was worried about Moussa\u2019s weak body and afraid that she could not stand it, so he had to give up.Moussa comfortably nestled in Chelsea\u2019s arms and let him carry her all the way home. She was not lazy and didn\u2019t want to walk, but she was too weak to do it.When she got home, Chelsea was afraid that Moussa would get cold and boiled water for her to take a hot bath. He also made hot soup and coaxed her to drink a big bowl of it.Moussa was angry with him for forcing her into the cold room despite her wishes. Although she cooperated, at most half-heartedly, she was uncomfortable and did not want to be pretentious. Who let him retaliate that strong?
