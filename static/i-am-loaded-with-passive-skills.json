    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1\u201cDarn it!\u201d16When Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes again, he found that everything had changed.3The only things he could see were a ceiling covered in spider webs, a small wooden table cloaked in dust, a candle stub that had been fully burnt, as well as a black sword that had a powerful spiritual aura.7This room\u2019s d\u00e9cor was drastically different from that of his hospital ward.5Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and searched his memory. He remembered that he had finally kicked the bucket after optimistically battling with his illness for three years.21The pain had ended. He had waved his hands and bade farewell to the heavens. However, he\u2019d still felt indignant.Why did other people have such vibrant lives, and yet he had to be confined to the hospital ward after nine years of compulsory education?18School and hospital. Those were painful words for people, yet those two things had taken up his entire life.9As for now\u2026He looked around at his foreign yet familiar surroundings, then pinched himself all over. However, he didn\u2019t really feel any pain.3\u201cDid God take pity on me? Did I cross over to another world without pain?\u201d7Xu Xiaoshou shifted his gaze to the bronze mirror on the table and saw a new, yet just as handsome face.23He looked like an 18-year-old teenager with a pale complexion. He looked as though he hadn\u2019t been in the sun for a long time. He had a tall nose that separated the few freckles on both sides of his face, and his lips were dry and cracked.9\u201cNot bad. I\u2019ll look better after I get a little tanner and eat a little more. Especially these few freckles\u2026\u201d9Xu Xiaoshou puckered his lips and rubbed the dead skin on his lips away. He searched back through his memories, trying to find out why he was so withered and scrawny.4This person had been an outer yard disciple of the Tiansang Spirit Palace. Unfortunately, he only had average talent. He had entered the spirit palace for three years, yet had only reached Level Three of the ten levels of spiritual cultivation. He had engaged in death seclusion for one month, determined to achieve a breakthrough to deal with the Windcloud Competition.14He\u2019d rather die than not succeed!2In the end, he had died\u202630Xu Xiaoshou shook his head with pity. This person had known that he wouldn\u2019t be able to break through to Level Four. He had been subjected to mockery and sarcasm these last three years and had gotten the heart to die.15He had only used the death seclusion this time as a reason and an excuse to follow through with his plan.It was a different world and a different set of troubles. Xu Xiaoshou had been tortured physically, while this person had been ravaged mentally.3Both of their lives were pitiful.\u201cHowever, since I\u2019ve been given this chance, I will never be defeated by the rumors and slander,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself. He continued to drudge up fragments of memory, and his expression turned dark.9As it turned out, the Windcloud Competition was equivalent to a year-end exam. This person had placed last for two years. He would have to pack up and leave the Tiansang Spirit Palace if he lost again this year.2It was no wonder that he had engaged in death seclusion. It looked like he\u2019d had no other choice\u20263Xu Xiaoshou was put in a predicament. Why had he been put in such a stressful situation the moment he\u2019d crossed over to this world? A year-end exam? And elimination, no less, if he ranked last?11As a person who had experienced exams before, he was most terrified of them. This was especially so since he lacked both soft and hard power at the moment.6More terrifyingly, there was no dark technology in this world, so he couldn\u2019t cheat\u20268His thoughts were running wild. He nearly finished retrieving all his memories. Then, his soul shook and he seemed to have fully fused with this body.The next second, a black wheel appeared in his mind.5\u201c\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought.\u201cSo there is dark technology in this world?\u201d14He quickly looked into his mind and closely examined the black wheel.2The black wheel was rather simple in design. It looked like a product from a roadside stall and didn\u2019t look particularly valuable. Xu Xiaoshou severely doubted that this piece of dark technology had been placed here just to appease him.The base of the wheel was split into two sections, one gold and the other red.1Interestingly, the gold section occupied ninety percent of the wheel\u2019s area, while the red section only occupied a small sector.\u201cThat\u2019s too unfair\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou silently cursed. According to what he\u2019d learned in the past, the diminished red sector usually had the best stuff.5However, the gold section was marked with the words \u201cActive System,\u201d while the words \u201cPassive System\u201d were on the red section.10\u201cActive and Passive?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned puzzled. From a gaming perspective, active techniques were naturally better than passive techniques. After all, how was he going to kill enemies with just passive skills alone?40He might not even be able to kill wild monsters!Could it be that the black wheel thought that my previous life was too pitiful and thus expanded the area of the \u201cActive System\u201d as a reward?2Xu Xiaoshou became excited. That must be the case!1\u201cIt\u2019s a wheel with a conscience. We don\u2019t see this too often!\u201d9He was elated. He wanted to search for something that looked like a start button, but couldn\u2019t find anything.In his mind, there was nothing else other than this simple wheel.Was the wheel supposed to be activated manually?He looked at the shabby black wheel, afraid that he would damage it if he wasn\u2019t careful. However, it seemed like he had no other choice but to activate it by force.1Xu Xiaoshou looked at the needle on the wheel. It was long and slender. It looked like it couldn\u2019t withstand a gust of wind.He gave it a try. He used his will to gently push the needle. The wheel shook and looked like it was about to move.\u2026 Then nothing.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d2The wheel had only looked like it\u2019d been about to move. In the end, the needle didn\u2019t budge an inch. Xu Xiaoshou felt that the person who had made this wheel hadn\u2019t put too much thought into it.2It was all right that the wheel looked shabby, but it wasn\u2019t even greased. How was he going to use it?1He exerted a little more force with his will. The needle seemed to tilt to the side. However, it still felt like it was resisting him. He needed to use more force!Xu Xiaoshou used even more force. The long slender needle tilted to the side even more this time. He thought that this probably wasn\u2019t good and lessened the amount of strength he used. In the end, the needle couldn\u2019t bear the heavy load and broke\u20264It broke?It broke!4Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned dark. As it turned out, the wheel didn\u2019t just look shabby. It was truly shabby!The needle had been pointing toward the edge of the gold section. However, now that it\u2019d broken, it immediately fell toward the red section that was outside the edge of the gold section.1Red\u2026 Passive System?Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face turned from black to purple. It wasn\u2019t right to play with people like that. Who had made this wheel? It was an evil device.He suddenly had a thought. Could it be that the wheel wasn\u2019t activated by pushing the needle but by spinning the wheel?36\u201cGroan\u2026 It can\u2019t be, right?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s face turned red. He experimentally prodded the wheel under the needle. Indeed, the wheel started to turn smoothly and didn\u2019t look like it needed to be greased.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes lazily rolled into the back of his head and he staggered backward and fell onto the bed.4The next second, he leapt off the bed, desperately wanting to pick up the broken needle with his will. He wanted to seize the opportunity to place the needle onto the gold section before the black wheel could react.2He didn\u2019t expect the black wheel to come to its senses after his foul play. The wheel immediately disappeared.1A line of words appeared:\u201c[Passive System] activated, downloading\u2026\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou wanted to cry. However, he could only go with the flow and accept it.7The words disappeared, and a small red interface took its place. Xu Xiaoshou looked over, harboring a sliver of hope.1There was only one section in the interface. In the section was a line of large words.Fundamental Passive Skill.The section looked familiarly shabby and simple.Breathing Technique (Acquired Lv. 1).18Xu Xiaoshou immediately fell back onto the bed. His pale complexion suddenly turned red. His blood was coursing through his veins. He was angry and furious.1Darn it. Breathing Technique? Do I really need you to teach me that?14Even a baby knew how to breathe!14Xu Xiaoshou had harbored some hope for this Passive System. Maybe there would be a godly twist that would shock him.9At that moment, he completely slipped into despair. It really was passive. Breathing\u2026Breathing, darn it!4He was so angry that he involuntarily took a few more breaths. However, he suddenly sensed the spiritual energy in his body start to stir violently.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was immensely shocked. His cultivation level was only Spiritual Cultivation Level Three. There shouldn\u2019t be such a violent stir in his spiritual energy unless he was about to achieve a breakthrough. Could it be that he was about to achieve a breakthrough?2He quickly sat down cross-legged. He was just about to do something when he saw his spiritual energy become a cocoon and envelop his entire body. A wonderful stream of energy rose and broke through its restraints like a fish slipping back into the ocean.The formless waves released ripples in the air around him and even cleared off the dust on the table.2\u201cI, I achieved a breakthrough?\u201d18Xu Xiaoshon looked lost. This person had been unable to advance, even after he\u2019d engaged in death seclusion for a month, yet he had now achieved a breakthrough because he was furious and had taken a few more breaths of air?2Something was wrong\u2026Breathing?There was a sparkle in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes. \u201cBreathing Technique?\u201dCould it be that the Breathing Technique was similar to a martial arts technique, where his every breath allowed him to take in the spiritual energy in the surroundings for his use?14\u201cMy\u2026 I\u2019ve found a treasure!\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou had thought that he\u2019d messed up and was stuck with a lousy system. He didn\u2019t expect it to be a great system. He seriously pondered the word \u201cPassive\u201d and had an epiphany.\u201cPassive breathing?\u201d1\u201cPassive training?\u201d6He observed his body as he breathed. Indeed, he realized that a shred of spiritual energy from the surroundings would be taken into his sea of energy with his every breath.It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough!He\u2019d reached a standstill in his cultivation, which meant that his few breaths of spiritual energy had made the difference and given him the success he needed!2Xu Xiaoshou felt a wave of passion. The diminished section of the wheel really always had the good stuff.He would\u2019ve had to go through the process of training if he\u2019d gotten a powerful technique that he had to actively cultivate.1However, this Breathing Technique allowed him to even skip the process of training. What did that mean?6Xu Xiaoshou flicked his sleeves and pushed back the long hair on his forehead. There was a suave expression on his face.4\u201cI, Xu Xiaoshou, will become invincible, even if I don\u2019t move a muscle!\u201d12Unfortunately, no one was there to witness how suave he was. Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was a bit of a pity.8He once again looked toward the red interface and felt a different emotion.\u201cBreathing Technique (Acquired Lv. 1).\u201dHis gaze moved toward the words in the brackets. Xu Xiaoshou instinctively muttered, \u201cAcquired\u2026 Lv. 1\u2026\u201dThat must mean that it could be leveled up. So what did he need to level up this skill?He quickly noticed the lower portion of the interface. There was a small line of words there that he\u2019d missed just now, as he\u2019d been too agitated.\u201cPassive Points: 0.\u201d4Xu Xiaoshou stroked his chin. Passive Points?That was probably what he needed to level up his skills. However, how could he gain Passive Points?14The summer night was always accompanied by the songs of cicadas and the buzzing of mosquitoes. Xu Xiaoshou slipped into deep thought. The room became completely quiet.He suddenly felt an itch on his forearm and instinctively slapped toward the area. He saw a bloody mark on his palm when he lifted his hand.\u201cDarned mosquito!\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt that this room needed a deep cleaning. After all, he hadn\u2019t cleaned the place in over a month. But he suddenly froze the next second, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry.All he saw was a notification bar that had appeared at the bottom of the red interface.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d50Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2There was dew on the plants and fog covering the morning sun, which was rising in the east.The Spiritual Cultivators of the Tiansang Spirit Palace had long been awake and were taking in spiritual energy in various places. Some of them were on trees, some in pavilions, some in their friends\u2019 yards\u20262Leaves rustled. Spirit magpies chirped. Everything was serene and wonderful.However, two sneaky figures were shifting along on a quiet, meandering path. One of them was tall and burly, while the other was short and stout.The tall figure was a muscular man. He had a burlap sack in his hands, and his back was hunched as he looked from side to side. It was obvious that he was going to do something bad.4By his side was a shorter teenager who only reached the tall man\u2019s neck. He had a longsword sheathed at his waist, and there was an excited expression on his face.1\u201cSenior Liu, why were we chosen for the mission of corpse collecting? Don\u2019t the elders of the outer yard usually deal with this?\u201d the shorter teenager, Zhou Zuo, asked.\u201cNaturally, it was orchestrated. Do you think this opportunity fell into your lap by chance?\u201d The muscular man, Liu Zhen, looked around him. When he realized that no one was paying any attention to them, he heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cI heard that Boss Wen gave them a large number of Spirit Crystals.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d Zhou Zuo squinted, then rubbed his hands together and lowered his voice. \u201cThen whose corpse are we collecting?\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2019s!\u201d Liu Zhen walked as he said, \u201cI heard that he engaged in death seclusion in an attempt to break through Level Three for this Windcloud Competition. If we count the time, today should be his last day. He hasn\u2019t come out for a long time, which means that he must\u2019ve died.\u201d2\u201cLevel Three?\u201d Zhou Zuo looked at him in shock. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s cultivation level wasn\u2019t much higher than his. \u201cWhat kind of treasures could a Level Three have? We might as well let him die on his own!\u201d\u201cWhat do you know!?\u201d Liu Zhen scolded him. \u201cThat Xu Xiaoshou was in the spirit palace for nearly three years. If nothing else, his yard alone is worth thousands of Spirit Crystals.\u201d\u201cWow, he\u2019s that rich?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I also heard that he has a ninth-grade spirit spiritual sword.\u201dZhou Zuo\u2019s eyes nearly fell out of his sockets when he heard this. \u201cNinth grade spiritual sword?\u201d\u201cLower your volume!\u201d Liu Zhen said, afraid that someone might\u2019ve heard his shocked exclamation. He looked around at the dissatisfied gazes of the people around them, then scolded the top of his partner\u2019s head again. Was this lad not afraid that the people around them would hear him shouting so loudly?1The two of them chatted as they walked along the meandering path before finally coming to a quiet yard. The yard was enveloped in a large array.Liu Zhen, who had been leading the way, suddenly stopped in his tracks.\u201cIt\u2019s quite far away\u2026 Oh my!\u201dZhou Zuo, who was walking behind him, slammed into Liu Zhen\u2019s back. He rubbed his forehead in pain and grumbled, \u201cSenior Liu, why did you suddenly stop\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t see what was ahead of them because he was shorter. He walked around him and suddenly understood why Liu Zhen had suddenly stopped in his tracks.A dozen people were sitting cross-legged in front of the yard.They weren\u2019t speaking. They were all sitting there silently and cultivating. The scene looked incredibly harmonious.\u201cWhy are there so many people?\u201dZhou Zuo was confused. He raised his head and looked at Liu Zhen. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Boss Wen obtained this opportunity by spending a great deal of Spirit Crystals?\u201d he asked doubtfully.1He slammed his palm onto the top of Zhou Zuo\u2019s head when he said this. Liu Zhen was so angry he couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell? All of these people got smart!\u201d1\u201cDarn it. They could\u2019ve picked somewhere else to train, but instead they chose to come here. The information must\u2019ve been leaked!\u201d1Zhou Zuo rubbed his head, a bitter expression on his face. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t vent your anger on me,\u201d he thought.1The dozen people who were sitting cross-legged in front of the yard noticed that somebody else had come. They couldn\u2019t help but be happy. All of them started chattering.\u201cYo, someone else has come. They\u2019re a little late. The sun\u2019s already rising from the east.\u201d\u201cThat must be Liu Zhen. Who\u2019s the person beside him? He must be new. Did he come to witness the action?\u201d\u201cHey, Liu Zhen, you\u2019re too negligent. I came before the sun rose, and there were already people here\u2026\u201d\u201cTch, I came last night.\u201d\u201cI came the day before!\u201d\u201cI came three days ago!\u201d11A commotion broke out in front of the yard. Liu Zhen didn\u2019t know if they were boasting or not. In the end, someone claimed that they\u2019d been here for a month, and everyone instantly turned to look at that person in awe.5Liu Zhen felt dizzy and said furiously, \u201cWhat are you guys here for?!\u201d\u201cHey, Liu Zhen. We can\u2019t say.\u201d\u201cBut if you must know, we\u2019re here for the ninth grade spiritual sword.\u201dZhou Zuo nearly burst out laughing. Did everyone know the information? Hehe. And Liu Zhen had told him to keep quiet.He glanced at Liu Zhen and swallowed the words he\u2019d been about to say. Liu Zhen\u2019s expression was dark, as if he\u2019d just eaten a string of firecrackers and was going to explode the next second.Liu Zhen felt like his lungs were about to explode. Boss Wen had spent a great deal of Spirit Crystals to obtain this information. Why was it so cheap?The people in their camp wouldn\u2019t have leaked this information, so had all of these people bribed the elder?The person just now had said he couldn\u2019t say\u2026Darn it. Which elder would be so immoral as to sell a piece of information to so many people!?6He couldn\u2019t voice what he\u2019d wanted to say. It felt like there was something stuck in his throat. The two of them stood still in front of the path. Awkwardness seemed to hang in the air like a crying crow.The people in front of the yard seemed to have experienced this many times. They expertly patted the ground.\u201cLiu Zhen, come over and have a seat.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stand on ceremony. Just treat this as your own yard.\u201d1\u201cHaha!\u201d Zhou Zuo couldn\u2019t help but erupt into laughter.Liu Zhen pushed him onto the ground with a slap, then walked over, looking dejected. He stopped halfway in shock when he looked at the yard again.He saw the formless barrier that enveloped the yard start to ripple. The next moment, the barrier split open and revealed the door of the yard.The crowd that was sitting cross-legged in front of the yard also noticed this transformation. They all turned to look. Some of them looked at the color of the sky and noticed that something was off.\u201cWhat time is it? Didn\u2019t they say that the array would only be dispelled at noon?\u201d\u201cWho dispelled the array? No one here knows how to dispel arrays. Was it you, Liu Zhen?\u201dLiu Zhen nearly ran forward to slam the person onto the ground. He was so far away from the yard. How could he have dispelled the array?Also, who are you to call my name like a friend? We\u2019re not close! I don\u2019t know you.1Liu Zhen was speechless at this group of people, who were acting friendly with him. However, now was not the time to get caught up in this. He focused his attention on the door of the yard in front of him.Creak!The door was pushed open. A tall, slender figure carrying a black sword was leaning by the door, his eyes sleepy.\u201cWhy are you so noisy this early in the morning? Are you trying to prevent me from sleeping?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was irritated. He\u2019d wanted to train last night but had suddenly had a thought: he breathed when he slept, and breathing meant training\u202611Thus, he\u2019d lain down to go to bed!He hadn\u2019t expected another mosquito to appear after he\u2019d just killed one. And then three more had appeared after that!1Tormented by the mosquitoes, he hadn\u2019t been able to sleep. He\u2019d toiled the entire night before finally falling asleep, only to be jolted awake by the noise early in the morning!1Even though there was a soundproof array around the yard, it wasn\u2019t a high-level array.This group of people had gotten louder and louder, and their voices had drifted into his room like a buzzing mosquito.2Unable to tolerate it any longer, he had grabbed his sword and gotten out of bed.Xu Xiaoshou had been in the outer yard for three years and understood what this group of people was thinking. Thinking that he\u2019d died, they wanted to seize the opportunity to collect his corpse and profit off of it!1Unfortunately for them, while he had died, another him had risen and taken his place.7He leaned by the door and looked around him, then said in a mocking tone, \u201cPeople, why are you crowding around my door so early in the morning? I don\u2019t want to buy breakfast!\u201dAll of the people looked toward the swordsman leaning by the door. They were all shocked.Xu Xiaoshou?He\u2019d achieved a breakthrough and come out of his seclusion?It\u2019s well understood that you can\u2019t get far without natural talent. Xu Xiaoshou had spent the last three years telling everyone that he was born to be stuck at Level Three. How could he have achieved a breakthrough just by engaging in death seclusion?What kind of luck did he have!?\u201cXu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t die?\u201d\u201cWhat happened? You\u2026 You broke through to Level Four?\u201dXu Xiaoshou had wanted to speak, but he suddenly saw the notification panel in his mind update.\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +12.\u201d17Xu Xiaoshou was elated. He had spent the last night being frustrated over how he had to attract mosquitoes with the fragrant smell of his flesh to increase his Passive Points. Now, it looked like\u20262It wasn\u2019t just being attacked that gained him Passive Points. Being doubted did it too.7Could it be that any passive words or actions would increase his Passive Points?2With the points he\u2019d just earned, and the one\u2019s he\u2019d gained from being assaulted six times by mosquitoes last night, he now had 18 Passive Points.4But, he had been bitten many times last night, yet each time had only given him +1 Passive Point, so why was it \u201c+12\u201d for being doubted?Xu Xiaoshou was confused. He looked at people present and counted. There were seventeen people.Could it be that twelve people within the group doubted that he\u2019d broken through to Level Four?Zhou Zuo finally got to Liu Zhen\u2019s side and asked softly, \u201cThis is Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was elated. His hearing was great. Out of all these corpse collectors, there was a person who didn\u2019t even know whose corpse they\u2019d come to collect?He walked out of the yard with his black sword in hand. The group of people moved back.Xu Xiaoshou had spent all of his Spirit Crystals to purchase the ninth grade spiritual sword to show how determined he was to undergo death seclusion.2The name of the sword was \u201cHiding Pain,\u201d meaning that he hid his pain and suffering. He\u2019d been determined to die along with the sword if he was unable to achieve a breakthrough.9Now that he had succeeded in breaking through to Level Four, he had the ninth grade spiritual sword combined with the White Cloud Sword Technique that he had spent three years cultivating\u2026 Even though he had only learned one stroke, he might stand a chance against this group of people in front of him.8The person with the highest cultivation level out of the people that had come here was Liu Zhen, who was Spiritual Cultivation Level Five. The high-level bosses woudn\u2019t come out in person to collect his corpse. They had too high of status.1The group of people instinctively retreated when they saw Xu Xiaoshou come out of his seclusion.One person holding a sword had shocked the entire group.\u201cTo think that you would try to collect my corpse. Mine. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s. Why did your bosses not come personally?!\u201dIn both cultivation and experience, Xu Xiaoshou, who had been in the outer yard for three years, was considered an elder. He\u2019d been here long enough to be called a senior.4How else would he have the assets to own a small yard and a spiritual sword.The people who were more powerful than him had reached the Innate Stage and headed into the inner yard. Some of the so-called bosses who had remained in the outer yard had followed behind him some years ago.1Thus, no one dared to talk back when he spoke. Even Liu Zhen, who was one level higher than him, remained silent when he saw the spiritual glow circulating the black sword on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shoulder.1\u201cScram, go back to where you came from!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou waved his arms like he was chasing ducks away.The group hadn\u2019t expected Xu Xiaoshou to immediately take the initiative the moment he came out to crush their spirits. They resentfully turned to leave, none of them daring to mutter another word.\u201cSenior Liu, are we going to leave just like that?\u201d Zhou Zuo asked cautiously.Liu Zhen looked at Xu Xiaoshou. Even though he was indignant, it wasn\u2019t like he could charge forward and kill him before dragging his corpse away, right?Personal battles were forbidden in the spirit palace, and even if they weren\u2019t, he doubted whether or not he\u2019d be able to defeat Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he sighed, then left with the group.\u201cWait!\u201dXu Xiaoshou suddenly called out from behind them, as if he\u2019d just remembered something.Everyone in the group turned around, confused. They saw Xu Xiaoshou pierce his sword into the ground and shout, \u201cYou guys come and go as you please. Do you really think that I don\u2019t have a temper?\u201d9Everyone got angry. They had wasted hours of their time waiting here and hadn\u2019t managed to get anything. They had already turned around to leave. What else did Xu Xiaoshou want?\u201cWhat can you do about it?\u201d Liu Zhen knitted his brows and asked. Xu Xiaoshou wouldn\u2019t be able to defend himself if this group of people surrounded and attacked him. Had he become insane after his death seclusion and wanted to fight all seventeen of them by himself?2He saw Xu Xiaoshou snicker. \u201cNothing. Don\u2019t get too agitated. I was just asking a question.\u201dThe group was silent. Xu Xiaoshou said with a jovial expression, \u201cI said that I\u2019ve broken through to Level Four. Do you believe me?\u201dEveryone froze when they heard his question. He\u2019d stopped everyone to ask such a stupid question? However, in order to leave this place, all of them played along.\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cWe do, we do!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve reached Level Four. You sure are impressive, Senior Xu. So can we leave now?\u201dXu Xiaoshou froze. Why were they reacting this way?\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Doubt me. Please doubt me as you please!\u201d he screamed internally. He had effortfully come up with an idea to gain Passive Points, yet no one was playing along with him.3He glanced at the group of people who were growing impatient and wanted to leave, then suddenly had a burst of inspiration. He picked up his sword and stood up straight, then said casually, \u201cI won\u2019t hide it from all of you. Actually, I\u2019ve already broken through to Level Five\u2026\u201d4\u201cHow could that be?\u201d\u201cHehe, Senior Xu, you must be joking\u2026\u201dEveryone voiced their thoughts. They weren\u2019t blind. It was as clear as day that he had the aura of a Level Four, yet he was trying to say that he was a Level Five?He was lying through his teeth. He sure was impressive.\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +15.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was elated. So that was what he had to do?He saw that there were only 15 points, which meant that there were two people who believed him? Were they dumb?3\u201cHehe, actually, I\u2019ve already broken through to Level Six\u2026\u201d???\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +17.\u201dGreat. This was a group of people that would be useful for collecting Passive Points.Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll stop pretending and tell you the truth. Actually, I\u2019m already Level Seven\u2026\u201dThe group felt the veins in their foreheads bulge. Was this Xu Xiaoshou using them for his amusement or was he doing this for another reason?2\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +13.\u201d5Hey, why did his points go down?Xu Xiaoshou was only paying attention to the notification panel in his mind and didn\u2019t notice the expressions on their faces. He immediately added, \u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019ll stop joking. I\u2019ve already reached Level Eigh\u2026\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, you\u2019ve gone too far!\u201d\u201cYou can kill us, but don\u2019t humiliate us!\u201d2\u201cAttack, brothers!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was shocked. He came to his senses and saw the seventeen furious faces in front of him. He immediately moved back into the yard and closed the door, then instantly activated the array.4My obedient friends, I only asked a few questions. Why did you have to blow up as if you\u2019d just eaten a string of explosives!?6Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Xu Xiaoshou really was rich.He had a small pond of spirit fishes, a fake mountain, and a few tall spirit trees in his yard.6Xu Xiaoshou had wanted to go back to sleep after he closed the door. However, he noticed that a new section had appeared in the red interface in his mind: Store.He shifted his gaze down to the text beneath it. Passive Points: 64.5Xu Xiaoshou was elated. He had earned a lot of Passive Points just now. Could it be that he had only unlocked the store when his Passive Points had reached two digits?He tapped into the store. The store was empty save for a red gift box.\u201cPassive Gift Box (Purchase: 10 Passive Points).\u201d8Xu Xiaoshou had tried to upgrade his skills with his Passive Points last night but hadn\u2019t been able to figure out how to do it. He realized now that the Passive Points were used to purchase items.Without thinking too much, he immediately tapped to purchase the gift box. He tore the gift box open and the notification panel refreshed.\u201cSkill Point +10.\u201d1\u201cPassive Key +3.\u201d2At the same time, the store shook as a red wheel appeared. This wheel was a size smaller than the black wheel from last time. Also, the surface of the wheel was obscured by a layer of gray fog. He couldn\u2019t see its contents.The corners of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s mouth involuntarily twitched when he saw the wheel, and his eyes dulled. He immediately recalled the needle that he had broken the last time.Two other gray items appeared within the store section.\u201cSkill Point (Purchase: 1000 Passive Points).\u201d2\u201cPassive Key (Purchase: 1000 Passive Points).\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou was startled when he saw these two notifications. It was that expensive?Had he just purchased 10,000 Passive Points worth of items just with 10 Passive Points just now?4\u201cWow!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes widened. He realized that the gift box was equivalent to a bundle for new players that didn\u2019t measure up to his level. It might as well have been free!1It felt great!\u201cPassive Key\u2026 That must be used to activate this wheel, right?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou deliberated. Had the wheel upgraded itself after being ravaged the last time? It was no longer activated manually?1He didn\u2019t have to think too hard about the Skill Points. Those were definitely used for upgrading his passive skills.\u201cSo do I upgrade the Breathing Technique?\u201d he thought to himself. But Xu Xiaoshou quickly tossed that idea to the side. \u201cLet me try the Passive Key first. I might be able to obtain other passive skills.\u201d2The Windcloud Competition of the outer yard would be held in three days. It was a competition for the bosses who wanted to place in the top 100 of the Windcloud Scoreboard. However, to Xu Xiaoshou, it was an elimination exam.He might be able to continue training in the Tiansang Spirit Palace if he obtained a decent passive skill from this red wheel. He wouldn\u2019t have a place to stay if he were really ousted out of the Spirit Palace.Xu Xiaoshou inserted the key into the small hole at the base of the red wheel. The fog above his head became even thicker. He couldn\u2019t see a thing.\u201cGive me a chance. Give me something that can instantly make me stronger!\u201d2After he turned the key, Xu Xiaoshou placed his hands together and started to pray, \u201cI don\u2019t want techniques. I don\u2019t want techniques. They can\u2019t help me for the time being\u2026\u201dThe gray fog billowed. Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know what was going on within the fog, but the notification panel soon refreshed.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d it read.3Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned black. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d he thought. \u201cWould I really have better luck next time?\u201d2Couldn\u2019t they have come up with something that an average person could use? Why was the system always so evil? It was just like the needle from the previous wheel!Xu Xiaoshou finished venting internally. He still had two keys. Xu Xiaoshou inserted another key and then shouted like a maniac, \u201cGo! RNGesus!\u201d14The gray fog billowed. Xu Xiaoshou looked at the notification panel expectantly.\u201cOne extra key!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cHey, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d he thought. \u201cI spent one key to get one key and nothing else? Are they just toying with me?\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes back as far as they\u2019d go. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re Mr. Big Shot or something? One extra key?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not amused!\u201d3He had used two keys and had two keys left.Xu Xiaoshou could no longer stand such torture. He inserted one key and stopped looking at the notification panel. He estimated that sufficient time had passed and saw that the key had vanished. He then pushed his last key fiercely into the hole.\u201cNothing good, nothing good\u2026\u201d he muttered, trying to jinx it as he stole glances at the notification bar.\u201cObtained an Extended Passive Skill: Strengthen!\u201d1\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201dJinxing himself had worked!Xu Xiaoshou slapped himself on the thigh when he looked at the line of text. He\u2019d finally gotten something good.However, after he read the sentence more closely\u2026\u201cStrengthen?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was so flabbergasted he almost vomited blood.1Why not just say I\u2019m scrawny while you\u2019re at it?3\u201cOh? Maybe it\u2019s not what I think?\u201dXu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered that the Breathing Technique he\u2019d gotten the other time also had an unassuming name, yet had a marvelous effect. Perhaps Strengthen would also have an unexpected effect?\u201cLet\u2019s hope so!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou collected himself and looked at the red interface. He noticed that the interface had changed again.One, Fundamental Passive Skills.Two, Extended Passive Skills.Three, Store.\u201cThere\u2019s an extra Extended Passive Skills tab?\u201d He looked again at the notification panel and realized that Strengthen was an Extended Passive Skill. It belonged to a different category than the Breathing Technique.1\u201cThe classification is quite detailed\u2026\u201dHe tapped open the tab and saw a small line of text at the bottom: Strengthen (Acquired Lv. 1).3\u201cCould it be a technique that will strengthen my body?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou pinched his arm. His arm hadn\u2019t become more muscular because of the appearance of the passive skill.Could it be that its level wasn\u2019t high enough?Xu Xiaoshou was conflicted. He still had ten Passive Points. What should he use them on?3The Breathing Technique was a fundamental technique and naturally worth leveling up. However, it took a long time to accumulate its effects. He had only managed to achieve a breakthrough yesterday because he already had a strong foundation.On the other hand, Strengthen, if it was as he guessed, was a passive skill that would strengthen his physical body. It was undoubtedly a more suitable choice for leveling up at this moment.He would have a fighting chance at the Windcloud Competition if his body could be enhanced. At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t be eliminated.After weighing the options, Xu Xiaoshou ultimately decided to use his Skill Points on Strengthen. What if there was a miracle?3He used his Skill Points in the interface. The notification panel immediately got updated.\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 2).\u201dXu Xiaoshou constantly monitored his body for changes. He didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion or not, but he felt that he now had more strength, but the transformation wasn\u2019t apparent. He continued tapping on the skill level on the panel.3\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 3).\u201d\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 4).\u201d\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 5).\u201dThe transformation was much more obvious this time. Xu Xiaoshou felt his muscles bulge slightly, and he no longer looked scrawny.3\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was elated. He punched the ground, and there was a dull thud from the impact. He\u2019d created a slight indention in the ground.2\u201cThat\u2019s great. It\u2019s obvious that my strength has increased. Could the Acquired Stage of the passive skill be equivalent to the ten levels of Spiritual Cultivation of Spiritual Cultivators?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou murmured to himself.There were ten levels of Spiritual Cultivation when Spiritual Cultivators first started their training. After those ten levels was the Innate Stage.1Thus, the first ten levels of Spiritual Cultivation was called the Acquired Stage. No problem there. The technique was only an Acquired Lv. 5 right now, yet it had such power. He\u2019d be able to break a few rib bones if he punched a person!1If it was as he thought and the levels of the technique were equivalent to the levels of a Spiritual Cultivator, wouldn\u2019t his body reach the Innate stage if he put all of his Skill Points into the technique?\u201cOh, wow!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou felt a wave of passion. It was more difficult for the physical body to reach the Innate Stage than to reach the Innate Stage in Spiritual Cultivation!He had wanted to split the Skill Points evenly between the two techniques. However, he now decided to put all of his Skill Points into Strengthen. He wanted to see what kind of effect it would have.17\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 6).\u201d\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 7).\u201d\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 8).\u201dHis body\u2019s power continuously skyrocketed. Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he\u2019d taken drugs. He felt like he had infinite energy.1But after his muscles had reached a size that could be considered muscular for the average person, his muscles no longer bulged and started to tone instead, becoming perfectly defined.4Xu Xiaoshou took off his shirt, revealing a beautiful, toned body underneath.11Boom!He shattered the ground with a punch!3It was powerful enough to rival a Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight fighter!1Xu Xiaoshou was in awe. \u201cToo powerful. This is too powerful!\u201dHe should be able to rank within the first few hundred of the Windcloud Scoreboard just with that fist alone. It was more than enough for him to avoid elimination!There was a glimmer in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes. He wasn\u2019t going to stop here. He still had three Skill Points, go!7\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 9).\u201d\u201cStrengthen (Acquired Lv. 10).\u201d\u201cStrengthen (Innate Lv. 1).\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s mind turned blank with bliss after he saw the last line of text, \u201cInnate, to think that it\u2019s really innate!\u201dEvery inch of muscle in his body started to twitch violently. The next moment, his muscles expelled sticky black impurities that smelled immensely foul.2Xu Xiaoshou looked up and let out a long howl, giving himself a fierce slap.6Pow!He wasn\u2019t dreaming!He punched the ground. With a thud, a palm-sized crater appeared, and web-like cracks spread out from the crater\u2019s center for a few inches.6That was just half his power!1Xu Xiaoshou was dazed. He had only used half of his power. If he were to punch someone\u2019s head at full power\u2026Hehe.4Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Windcloud Competition might be very interesting\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Late in the morning.A constant stream of people walked in and out of the Spiritual Affairs Division. This was the place where the Tiansang Spirit Palace dealt with the miscellaneous matters of outer yard disciples from. It was a massive place with 108 counters.1\u201cGood morning, Senior.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Senior Xu.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Senio\u2026 Good afternoon?\u201d3Xu Xiaoshou walked over with his sword behind his back. He saw people that he knew as well as people that he didn\u2019t. Anyway, he was the most senior person here and didn\u2019t have to greet anyone. All he had to do was nod.Entering the Spiritual Affairs Division was like entering a wet market. It was loud and rowdy.3Most of the people here had come to register for the Windcloud Competition. After all, not registering for the competition was equivalent to forfeiting.Anyone who forfeited for three years would be ousted from the palace. Of course, anyone ranked last for three years would also be ousted from the palace.4A small minority of people didn\u2019t want to participate in the competition and embarrass themselves. Thus, they had come over to submit their application to enter the mortal world as an executive. They planned to live day by day until they died.1All 108 counters were occupied. Xu Xiaoshou walked toward counter number one. There was no one there.1\u201cIndeed!\u201dAccording to his memories, rest of the counters were managed by outer yard disciples who had enough experience. Only counter number one was managed by the elder of the Spiritual Affairs Division, Qiao Qianzhi.Elder Qiao was good in every regard except that he constantly lectured anyone he talked to. Thus, the rest of the people would rather join the queue than interact with him.2Xu Xiaoshou was on rather good terms with this elder, mainly because he had reached the limits of his potential, so Elder Qiao couldn\u2019t be bothered to lecture him anymore.1After all, he was a man who was unable to break through to Level Four even after putting in 120% of his effort.Xu Xiaoshou entered the booth. Elder Xiao was nodding off. Xu Xiaoshou sneakily walked over, then rapped the table with his knuckles. \u201cWake up!\u201d5Elder Qiao, who was leaning back in his chair, his mouth slightly open, jumped in shock. He didn\u2019t even bother to wipe the drool from the corner of his mouth before slapping at whoever was in front of him. Xu Xiaoshou nimbly crouched down to avoid the attack. \u201cEasy!\u201d he warned.\u201cOh, it\u2019s you. Xiaoshou\u2026 Hm, Xu Xiaoshou?\u201dElder Qiao became wide awake when he saw who had come. There was a look of shock on his face. \u201cWeren\u2019t you in death seclusion? You didn\u2019t die?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned dark. What, it\u2019s not possible that I could\u2019ve achieved a breakthrough? You expected me to become a corpse?\u201cI died. I\u2019m now a zombie!\u201d he said in an unfriendly tone.3Elder Qiao gave him a friendly smile. He pointed to the people outside and said, \u201cYou\u2019re also prepared to leave the palace to become an executive in the mortal world?\u201dXu Xiaoshou returned his sarcasm. \u201cBecome an executive? Why, is it not good to make it in the top ten spots of the Windcloud Scoreboard?\u201d\u201cYes, but how can you with your abilities?\u201d Elder Qiao suddenly clutched his belly and burst out laughing, his body trembling violently.It was incredibly boring in the outer yard. Only Xu Xiaoshou dared to talk to him like this. It was only in front of Xu Xiaoshou that he would set aside his pride and laugh freely.1\u201cGot mocked. Passive Point +1.\u201d5Mocked?He\u2019d just opened a whole new can of worms!Xu Xiaoshou snickered. It seemed like it was as he\u2019d expected. As long as he was passive enough, he\u2019d gain an endless stream of Passive Points.2\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t believe that my abilities have improved by leaps and bounds after my death seclusion?\u201dElder Qiao had wiped off his drool with a napkin and was just about to rinse his mouth, but when Xu Xiaoshou asked this, he couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cGot suspected. Passive Point +1.\u201d3Xu Xiaoshou was happy. He continued to flick his sleeves and said with a stern expression, \u201cI won\u2019t keep anything from you. I\u2019ve already broken through to the Innate stage!\u201d3\u201cPuuu!\u201d Elder Qiao spat out his water.He looked at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s serious expression and could no longer hold it in. His demon-like laugh reverberated around the Spiritual Affairs Division. \u201cHAHAHAHA\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore, Xu Xiaoshou. Your expression\u2026 You\u2019re really funny.\u201d He grabbed the napkin that he\u2019d used to wipe his drool with and blotted away his tears.2\u201cGot praised. Passive Point +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.Praised?What kind of praise was that? That was sarcasm. This system must be broken. Where had it gotten \u201cpraised\u201d from?6Outside, some of the disciples heard Elder Qiao\u2019s demonic laugh. They craned their necks to look over to try and see what was going on.\u201cMy God, whose laughter was that? It\u2019s so demon-like!\u201d\u201cLower your voice. Don\u2019t you recognize Elder Qiao\u2019s laugh? Do you want to be lectured?\u201d\u201cWho managed to amuse Elder Qiao? I\u2019m impressed.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s have a look.\u201dThey were all curious and no longer cared about queueing up. After all, processing their applications as a group wasn\u2019t against the rules. Thus, all of them snuck over to the room where counter number one was.\u201cHng\u2026 It\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou? Wasn\u2019t he in death seclusion?\u201d\u201cWow, you\u2019re sure out of the loop. I heard that he broke through to Level Four and has come out of seclusion!\u201d\u201cTsk tsk. It looks like you are too. I heard yesterday that he reached Level Five.\u201d\u201cNonsense. I heard that he reached Level Seven.\u201d\u201cLevel Eight!\u201d1\u201cHe said that he was Innate while he was inside\u2026\u201d a weak voice said, and the room slipped into silence. They all turned to look at the person who\u2019d spoken.\u201cAs if we\u2019d believe you!\u201d they said.Elder Qiao saw the mob of people outside the door and became furious. He realized that his laugh had attracted all these people\u2019s attention. He immediately walked out of the room and shouted, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Go and tend to your registration!\u201d\u201cHehe, don\u2019t be angry, Elder Qiao!\u201d The group quickly waved their hands and scattered like birds.Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the room, was extremely elated. He looked at the continuous stream of updates in his notification panel.\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +42.\u201d4\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +31.\u201d1\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +16.\u201d1\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +3.\u201d3There were a few hundred people in the Spiritual Affairs Division, and a few dozen of them had come to see what was going on. He had gained more Passive Points from the Elder Qiao\u2019s laugh than all the Passive Points he\u2019d gained in the past combined.The first wave of Passive Points must have come from the onlookers. The notifications after that must have been from word spreading. Or were they from the second wave of doubt?1Xu Xiaoshou realized that every person could only give him one Passive Point during a single event. There was only one condition he had to fulfill if he wanted to obtain more Passive Points.A large number of people!He started daydreaming. Wouldn\u2019t he be able to instantly gain 10000 Passive Points if he shouted: \u201cI\u2019m an Innate stage expert\u201d in a crowd of 10000 people?8Groan. He might also be regarded as a lunatic and be beaten to death. Though, his scenario also seemed plausible.1Elder Qiao closed the door and returned to his chair. \u201cWhy do you have a stupid smile on your face?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t! It\u2019s nothing!\u201dXu Xiaoshou came to his senses and said, \u201cI forgot to talk about the issue at hand. I\u2019m here to register for the Windcloud Competition.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of embarrassing yourself?\u201dElder Qiao spoke as he took out a green token from the drawer. He placed it near his forehead and put in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s details.Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. The elder didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cI\u2019m really at the Innate stage! Why would I be afraid of embarrassing myself!\u201d he thought.He sighed. It couldn\u2019t be helped. The life of a genius came with slander and doubt.9\u201cSpiritual Cultivation Level Four?\u201d Elder Qiao asked.Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and decided not to bother talking back. He nodded.2\u201cHere!\u201dAfter he received the green token from Elder Qiao, Xu Xiaoshou placed it on his forehead and quickly read the details within.Xu Xiaoshou, Spiritual Cultivation Level Four, Group 12, Serial Number: 1130.Over a thousand people\u2026Xu Xiaoshou was still shocked even though he had expected this.There were always over a thousand participants during the annual Windcloud Competition. Anybody who was an outer yard disciple would have to participate in the competition, regardless if they had been training in the outer sect for one, two, or three years.The person who was ranked last would be subjected to a trial by the elders of the spirit palace. Those who didn\u2019t have an impressive showing would usually be sent away immediately.Elder Qiao had played a large part in Xu Xiaoshou being able to stay in the spirit palace for so long.2However, Elder Qiao wouldn\u2019t be able to protect Xu Xiaoshou forever. If Xu Xiaoshou was to rank last for the third year in a row, he wouldn\u2019t be able to save him.However, it seemed like this would no longer be a problem!Xu Xiaoshou kept the token and raised an eyebrow at Elder Qiao. He rubbed his palms together and said, \u201cElder Qiao, where are my Spirit Crystals\u2026\u201dHis first motive for coming here was to register for the competition. His second was to take back the funding he needed for his training.Counting the previous two months, he had 20 Spirit Crystals with Elder Qiao that he hadn\u2019t collected. He had become penniless after purchasing Hiding Pain. Even though 20 Spirit Crystals wasn\u2019t a lot, every little bit counted.\u201cYou sure are as smart as a whip when it comes to this type of thing,\u201d Elder Qiao scolded him, smiling.He took out 20 Spirit Crystals from the drawer. He waved his hand again and produced a pill bottle, then placed it on the table with the Spirit Crystals.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. Anyone who took up a position at the Spiritual Affairs Division was famous for being stingy. Elder Qiao was especially known for this. Why would he give him an extra bottle of pills?2\u201cThis is a personal gift from me to you. Don\u2019t tell the others!\u201d Elder Qiao said sternly. He pushed the Spirit Crystals and pill bottle toward him, and his expression suddenly turned melancholy. \u201cI might not be able to see you again in the future\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart warmed. He quickly put away the items, then smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if I\u2019m ousted out of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, I\u2019ll come back and visit you!\u201d\u201cHeh!\u201d Elder Qiao was happy. \u201cWould you be able to come in?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They can\u2019t kick me out.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope so!\u201dElder Qiao was a little melancholy as he watched Xu Xiaoshou walk out of the Spiritual Affairs Division smiling. He knitted his brows and murmured to himself, \u201cTo think that that lad would be able to achieve a breakthrough. What a miracle.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t look like he knows that I was the one who sold the others the information.

    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Xu Xiaoshou scrolled through the red interface in his head.Passive Points: 148.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough\u2026\u201dEven though it was much more than what he\u2019d had in the past, he still had a long way to go to amass the 1000 Passive Points needed to purchase the Skill Point.9Currently, he was able to obtain Passive Points when he got attacked, doubted, or mocked. These were things that could only happen if he interacted with people.2In other words, if he wanted to obtain even more Passive Points, all he needed to do was head into the middle of a large crowd and wreak havoc!6\u201cIt\u2019s like the system\u2019s pushing me into becoming a clown. I feel like a villain\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou cursed silently.17He would have to cause a scene and make a fool of himself. Then, someone would step forward and fiercely stomp him into the ground to become the main character of the show.3Xu Xiaoshou shivered at the thought. \u201cDarn it. That\u2019s too passive for my taste!\u201d3Thinking about the word \u201cpassive,\u201d he remembered the Passive System, and then recalled the black wheel. In that instant, he felt as though everything had been arranged by fate.2\u201cForget that. I should think harder about how to get stronger these next three days!\u201dEven though his physical body had reached the Innate Stage, his cultivation level was still at Level Four. He might not be able to achieve victory if he encountered high-level battle maniacs.He shook his head and stopped his thoughts from wandering. He took out the pill bottle that Elder Qiao had given him. Three Spiritual Cultivation Pills quietly lay in the bottle.These Spiritual Cultivation Pills were extremely valuable. Each of the pills was several times more valuable than the 20 Spirit Crystals he\u2019d gotten. When had Elder Qiao become so generous?7Xu Xiaoshou started deliberating. He had two main cultivation methods at the moment. The first was the Acquired-level Spiritual Cultivation Method that he had used in the past.This cultivation method was extremely slow, even when supplemented by Spirit Crystals. The method had a less than 1% absorption rate of Spirit Crystals, which was a waste of resources.The second method was the Breathing Technique. This was one of the system\u2019s fundamental passive skills. Even though he hadn\u2019t invested any of his Skill Points in the technique, he might be able to achieve an unexpected effect.\u201cLet\u2019s first try it with the Spirit Crystals!\u201dXu Xiaoshou kept the pill bottle and whipped out a Spirit Crystal. He then was at a loss for what to do next.So\u2026 How do I cultivate with that method?9The Breathing Technique was a passive skill. He didn\u2019t even know how the skill worked. How was he going to use it to absorb the Spirit Crystal?1Could it be\u2026A strange expression appeared on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face. He had a ridiculous cultivation method in mind.\u201cHuff\u2026\u201d5He took in a deep breath and got a big whiff of the Spirit Crystal in his hand.11\u201cSsss!\u201dIt was a ridiculous idea. He didn\u2019t expect his deep breath to conjure two trails of rich Spiritual Energy from the Spirit Crystal. The trails of energy entered Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expanded nostrils like green snakes.14Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s nose twitched, and he felt as though his soul were being gently caressed by a holy nun. Every inch of his body exploded with pleasure.16A comfortable, luxurious feeling spread over him from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head.\u201cAh~\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but moan. The feeling was wonderful. It was the first time he\u2019d felt like this in his eighteen years of living!16Soon, he came to his senses. He couldn\u2019t help but tremble.\u201cF***!\u201d\u201cThis is training?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so addictive.\u201d32The Spirit Crystal had become significantly smaller. Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. That one breath had caused such an obvious transformation.He investigated his energy reserve and was shocked.His energy reserve was like a crashing tide, each wave higher than the last. There were no signs that he had just advanced a level.He had just achieved a breakthrough and reached Level Four. How had just one breath immediately stabilized his cultivation level?Xu Xiaoshou was elated. This Breathing Technique was so powerful it was scary!5He didn\u2019t have to take the initiative to practice or use any cultivation methods. He didn\u2019t have to repeat his training every day or waste any resources. He would feel comfortable whenever he took a breath. He would gain a level every time he took a breath.\u201cYou\u2019re worth having!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought.\u201cIf I can level the technique up to the Innate Stage, and if there\u2019s a sufficient supply of Spiritual Energy, gaining a level with every breath isn\u2019t completely outside the realm of possibility!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was in a daze. This technique was incredibly powerful!11The Spirit Crystal lasted about ten breaths before it fully disappeared into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s nostrils. At the same time, his level had also skyrocketed.1The cultivation method he\u2019d used in the past absorbed Spirit Crystals at less than 1% efficiency. The Breathing Technique was terrifyingly powerful. It perfectly absorbed the entire crystal without wasting any of it.Comparatively, at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou looked like he was a drunk prawn. He was sprawled over his bed in an odd position. He didn\u2019t even look human.3An addictive cultivation method like that not only took a toll on Spirit Crystals, but also on the body.1\u201cChatter\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s teeth chattered continuously.\u201cHelp, help me up, chatter\u2026 I can still\u2026 train\u2026\u201d7With a thud, the pill bottle fell out of his robes.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body shook violently when he saw the item.7\u2026Xu Xiaoshou became more and more engrossed in his training. Three days quickly passed by.1In the outer yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace. At the Chuyun Platform. There was a sea of people.This place was originally called Chuyun Peak. It was rumored that the vice dean of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Elder Sang, had tempered the Chuyun Peak with flames and burned down half the mountain to create the Chuyun Platform, which could hold tens of thousands of people.The Chuyun Platform had a crater in the middle. Surrounding the crater were rows upon rows of spectator seats. From above, the place looked like a large black bowl silently sitting atop the peak of a mountain.At this moment, there were next to no one in the spectator seats, as almost all of the outer yard disciples had gathered on the Chuyun Platform.An elder carrying a sword on his back was standing in the air. His name was Xiao Qixiu, and he was the Chief Elder of the Tiansang Spirit Palace\u2019s Spiritual Law Division. He was responsible for all the judicial matters in the outer and inner yards and had immense authority.1At this moment, he was the chief judge of the outer yard\u2019s Windcloud Competition.Xiao Qixiu looked at the sky and shouted to quieten down the commotion on the Chuyun Platform after he ascertained that the time was right.\u201cSilence!\u201d4Everyone immediately looked toward him with a fiery gaze. Xiao Qixiu calmly took out a piece of paper from within his robes and recited:\u201cThere were a total of 1782 people who registered for this competition. This is reflected in the serial number on your Windcloud Token.\u201cThe preliminaries will be conducted in small groups elimination-style. There will be 100 people in each group and a total of 18 groups. The groups will be allocated to each of the 18 arenas respectively.\u201d3Xiao Qixiu then took out a purple array token. The array token shone with purple light after it was activated by his spiritual source.The Chuyun Platform under him started shaking, and eighteen supersized arenas slowly appeared. Each one of the arenas was enveloped by a transparent barrier.The people who had been standing on the Chuyun Platform were pushed to the side by the barrier. These people were newcomers who were participating in the Windcloud Competition for the first time.The experienced participants were leaning against the edge of the Chuyun Platform with their arms crossed, as though they were watching a good show.3Eighteen rays of black light descended from the sky and landed onto each of the 18 arenas.Xiao Qixiu announced in a loud voice, \u201cThere will be a professional judge responsible for every arena. If they have to take action to save you, you will be judged as having failed.\u201d\u201cLet me give you a word of caution. Death and injury may be inevitable, but you have to know when to stop.\u201cFurthermore, you must be resolved to die when you step onto that stage. The judges aren\u2019t gods. There\u2019ll be times where even they\u2019re not paying attention. Sometimes they\u2019re dazed, shocked, or just scratching an itch. And during those times, they might not be able to save you.\u201d12A few newcomers became flustered when they heard this. This was a little different from what they had imagined it\u2019d be like.The judges would be in a daze?What kind of joke was that? Weren\u2019t they professionals?2The more experienced participants smiled but didn\u2019t say anything. Elder Xiao\u2019s jokes were always like that. They always made others feel flustered.The experienced participants knew that the executive elders of the Spiritual Law Division were all immensely powerful and stoic. Why would they be in a daze when they were in the arena?Or scratching an itch at that?That was laughable!The corners of Xiao Qixiu\u2019s mouth twitched when he saw most of the newcomers below him start to become flustered. His expression changed a little.This was more like it!1Life was filled with surprises. How could he allow them to step into the arena in peak condition every time?He raised his hands. A long, ancient chime of a clock echoed reverberated from far away, \u201cDong\u2026\u201d1\u201cIt\u2019s noon. The Windcloud Competition will now begin!\u201d\u2026At arena number 12, the judge looked at the people outside the barrier and announced with a cold expression:\u201cThis group battle will be held elimination-style. The last person standing in the arena will be the winner.\u201d\u201cThe top ten people in the group will receive a prize and will move onto the next round of the competition, so please try your best!\u201dHe waved his arms symbolically, then said coldly, \u201cRegister your attendance and enter the arena!\u201d\u201cNumber 1101, Zhou Zuo.\u201dA shorter teenager trembled, then walked over. Liu Zhen, who was behind him, instructed, \u201cTake out your token and press it onto the barrier.\u201dZhou Zuo did as he was told, and was pulled into the arena.\u201cNumber 1102, Liu Zhen.\u201d1Liu Zhen only now realized that they had registered for the competition together and had been given successive serial numbers.1\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNumber 1120, Zhao Xiaosan.\u201dThere was a bitter expression on the teenager\u2019s face, as if he were on his way to his execution.1\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNumber 1130, Xu Xiaoshou.\u201dNo one replied.The judge\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cNumber 1130, Xu Xiaoshou,\u201d he repeated.There was still no reply.It became a little rowdy in the area outside the arena.\u201cDidn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou come out of his seclusion?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I was there to collect his corpse the other day and saw him. He didn\u2019t die!\u201d1\u201cDid he oversleep?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I think I saw him on the way here. He was walking weirdly.\u201d3\u201cMaybe you saw wrong.\u201dThe judge was furious. \u201cNumber 1130, Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d he shouted.Everyone quietened down and looked around. However, they didn\u2019t see Xu Xiaoshou.If Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t show up before time was up, there was nothing else the judge could do other than assume that Xu Xiaoshou had forfeited and skip past him and continue with the next participant.Who was this Xu Xiaoshou? He was really gutsy. He dared to be late for the Windcloud Competition?1\u2026In the spectator seats.Unlike the other arenas, there was an audience in the spectator seats of arena number 12. Three people, at that.One of them was a svelte lady dressed in a red dress. She was leaning lazily back in her chair, showing off her graceful physique. Her glossy red lips moved.3\u201cSister Su, is that the Brother Little Beast that you brought me here to watch? Did you forget to wake him up?\u201d3The younger lady by her side, who was wearing a white shirt, turned red. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Sister Rao!\u201d she cajoled.\u201cBrother Little Beast will definitely come. He must\u2019ve gotten held up by something. This is his last competition. I have to come and watch.\u201dThe lady in white, Su Qianqian, was about fourteen years old. She was a young girl, but she had a giant sword that was even taller than she was. It was now lying horizontally across her lap.7She gently stroked the giant sword on her lap, a nostalgic look in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any friends back when I entered the outer yard. Brother Little Beast helped me out a bunch. It was only because of him that I was able to enter the inner yard in a month.\u201dI didn\u2019t have any friends back when I entered the outer yard\u2026\u201cA month\u2026\u201d Rao Yinyin lowered her head and muttered. She knew that Su Qianqian didn\u2019t mean it, but that only made her words hurt even more!Further away.Elder Qiao squatted on his seat, pulling on his ears. \u201cThat darned Xu Xiaoshou. Where did he run off to!?\u201d he scolded.\u201cDoes he want me to personally oust him from the palace?\u201cHe\u2019s making me so anxious!\u201d\u2026Within the barrier.\u201cFor the last time!\u201d the judge announced, sounding like the Grim Reaper himself. \u201cNumber 1130, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dThe 99 people in the arena, the judge, and the three people outside the arena eagerly looked on.Just where was Xu Xiaoshou?11Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Xu Xiaoshou was on his way. He had one foot facing toward him and the other facing outward. He trudged on, bearing the elements.He had woken up an hour early to rush over to the arena, and he still wasn\u2019t there yet, even after walking for so long. \u201cThat darned Breathing Technique\u2026\u201dAn old man in a straw hat walked past him on crutches. The old man wasn\u2019t walking fast, but he breezed past Xu Xiaoshou.Sometime later, the old man turned back, as if he thought it weird that a young man was walking slower than a tortoise.\u201cYou\u2019re from the outer yard?\u201cLad, are you not going to participate in the Windcloud Competition?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s teeth were chattering. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m on my way!\u201d he stammered.The old man lowered his gaze and looked at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s feet, then smiled meaningfully. \u201cYou can\u2019t overdo things, young man!\u201d4Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned dark. He nearly staggered and fell. All he could do was curse internally, \u201cThat darned Spiritual Cultivation Pill\u2026\u201dThis was all because of the terrifying combination of the Breathing Technique and the Spiritual Cultivation Pill.During these three days of preparation, Xu Xiaoshou had suppressed the high\u2026 a weird sensation, and absorbed the 20 Spirit Crystals. His cultivation level had instantly jumped to the peak of Level Four.He\u2019d ascertained that there were no side effects to such a cultivation method and understood how powerful the Breathing Technique was. Even though its rate of absorption wasn\u2019t fast, he could absorb a large amount of energy in one go.He\u2019d gotten more and more engrossed in his training and had been one step away from reaching Spiritual Cultivation Level Five. How could he stop there?So he\u2019d dragged his trembling body, thinking about how he still had one night before the start of the competition. How could he waste that time?Time was money. Time was life!Thus, he had dug out the Spiritual Cultivation Pill and given it some thought. Afraid that the effects of the pill wouldn\u2019t be enough for him to achieve a breakthrough, he had thus cleared his lungs and taken a deep breath with his nose close to the pill.1That deep breath had caused him a world of trouble!He couldn\u2019t absorb much energy from a palm-sized Spirit Crystal. The Spiritual Cultivation Pill was only the size of a fingernail. With his deep breath, the pill had shrunk to nearly half its original size.What did that mean?Well, ordinarily, 99% of the Spiritual Cultivation Pill\u2019s spiritual energy would be scattered into the surroundings when a Spiritual Cultivator absorbed the pill. Even so, the amount of spiritual energy they absorbed was enough to boost the speed of their cultivation by several times.The Breathing Technique absorbed 100% of the energy\u2026Thus, by the time he had realized that something was off, his body had already been assaulted by a high that had been amplified several hundred times. Who could last against that?8It was no longer a high at that point. It felt more like he\u2019d consumed an explosive.His back went ramrod straight, and his heart suddenly stopped. He immediately became unconscious!7That breath was equivalent to an ordinary person consuming dozens of Spiritual Cultivation Pills. The pill\u2019s powerful effect reflected this.2During his coma, Xu Xiaoshou not only broke through to the next level, but his cultivation level even shot up to the peak of Level Five, and he nearly hit Level Six.When he\u2019d regained consciousness, he\u2019d felt like his body had been through the wringer, and like he was floating on air. His eyes were murky, his teeth chattered\u2026It was as though he\u2019d been\u2026 in a coma.1And he\u2019d only taken a small whiff of the pill, darn it!8He was walking by pushing his right foot forward with his left foot, then stabilizing himself with his right foot.He would fall on his butt if he didn\u2019t get this under control!Xu Xiaoshou quickly consumed the other half of the pill orally and absorbed it using a normal cultivation method. He felt a little better.Even though it was a waste of resources, he had no other choice at this moment. Being able to participate in the competition was the most important thing right now.1\u201cDong\u2026\u201dA long, melancholic ring of a bell broke the silence.Xu Xiaoshou bade his goodbyes to the old man and quickened his footsteps as he walked toward the Chuyun Platform.The old man wearing a straw hat watched Xu Xiaoshou stagger and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be young!\u201d he exclaimed.3\u2026On the Chuyun Platform, at arena number 12.\u201cFor the last time!\u201d\u201cNumber 1130, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dEveryone eagerly craned their necks. A young man carrying a sword behind his back staggered over under the intense sun.\u201cHere\u2026 Wait a moment!\u201d His voice was weak.The young lady in the white shirt in the spectator seats, Su Qianqian, looked incredibly excited. \u201cBrother Little Beast!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201dRao Yinyin was a little curious. However, she became giddy when she saw how the young man was walking. \u201cSister Su, what did you do to him?\u201d22\u201cHuh?\u201dSu Qianqian didn\u2019t understand what she meant. But her face immediately turned red when she looked at Xu Xiaoshou again and saw how he was walking. She clenched her fists and pounded on the chest of the lady in the red dress. \u201cHmph, I\u2019m ignoring you!\u201dFurther away, Elder Qiao also heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cYou\u2019ve finally come, lad\u2026\u201d1\u201cHng, look at how he\u2019s walking. He must have gone to do something bad.\u201d\u2026In the arena.Xu Xiaoshou weakly clasped his hands together before the judge. \u201cSorry. I was held up by something.\u201dHe tightened his legs after speaking.The judge was speechless. \u201cFrom the way you\u2019re acting, people could easily think you were held up because you were doing something bad,\u201d he thought.7At the same time, another ring from the bell echoed out from the horizon.\u201cDong\u2026\u201d1The judge sliced his hand downward. \u201cThe competition starts now!\u201dAs soon as he said this, the scene erupted into activity.Some took advantage of the fact that the people around them were distracted by Xu Xiaoshou to throw them out of the arena. A few people were immediately eliminated.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for death!\u201d4The people who didn\u2019t fall for the surprise attack immediately became furious and engaged in a furious battle with their attacker.Xu Xiaoshou had just entered the arena and was leaning by the edge. He was far away from the battlefield. He became anxious when he saw the number of people on the battlefield gradually dwindle.Those were headcounts!He needed those headcounts for his plan to strike it rich. All of them were Passive Points. How could they eliminate each other like that?\u201cStop!\u201dA forceful shout reverberated throughout the arena. Despite being forceful, his gusto couldn\u2019t hide the weakness in his voice. However, that shout caused everyone in the arena to stop fighting.Everyone was dazed. They turned back to look at Xu Xiaoshou, not understanding why they\u2019d been frightened in their tracks.What did that person want to do? Could it be that he was arrogant because he was a little further away from everyone else?A few people shifted over, wanting to beat Xu Xiaoshou up.The judge was also confused. He didn\u2019t expect this late person to harbor the power of the Innate Stage.He looked at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s level. Spiritual Cultivation Level Five? Hng, was he seeing things?The three people in the spectator seats were also dazed. Elder Qiao was incredibly anxious and didn\u2019t notice anything. He wallowed in his anxiety. \u201cThat Xu Xiaoshou. What does he want to do? Is he not afraid of death?\u201dRao Yinyin turned to look at the young lady. \u201cYour Brother Little Beast sure has a spirit of self-sacrifice. He\u2019s giving up to allow others to advance to the next stage?\u201dSu Qianqian didn\u2019t speak. She grabbed onto the giant sword on her lap tightly, her eyes filled with worry.In the arena, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s legs immediately trembled after he shouted. He quickly covered them with his long sleeves.2He looked around and saw that the most powerful fighter here was only Level Eight. That person shouldn\u2019t be as strong as him.\u201cHow lucky. I didn\u2019t encounter any of the bosses. Otherwise, I might\u2019ve had to end my plan to get rich before I even started,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said to himself.\u201cCough, cough!\u201d He let out a few light coughs to attract everyone\u2019s attention. He then pierced his black sword into the ground of the arena and leaned by the side of the barrier. He forcefully calmed himself down and said:1\u201cLadies and gentleman!\u201cI\u2019ve learned an invincible technique and have a body that\u2019s strong without parallel. As the saying goes, one has to practice what he\u2019s learned after coming out of seclusion\u20261\u201cSo let\u2019s skip the nonsense. I\u2019ll fight all 100 of you alone, come!4\u201cAll of you have been surrounded by me, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d14Everyone in the arena had been a little shocked at being shouted at just now. However, all of them erupted into roaring laughter when they heard Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s words.\u201cFight all 100 of us?\u201d\u201cYou must have forgotten to take a p*ss when you woke up this morning. Haven\u2019t you looked at yourself in a mirror?\u201d1\u201cDo you think we can\u2019t see your trembling legs and chattering teeth? Well, didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re going to fight all 100 of us alone? So what are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cA limp prawn like you fight us? Do you not know your own ability?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked down at his legs. The term \u201climp prawn\u201d was rather apt!He had attracted all their aggression. A wave of shouts entered his ears. Even the judge wanted to have a go at him.3However, it was clear that he was a stoic judge. He forcefully pushed down his desire to battle.1\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +42.\u201d\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +21.\u201dThe notification panel in his mind updated. Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows. Indeed, a place with a lot of people was a great battlefield for Xu Xiaoshou!Good mockery!Please abuse me more!33Xu Xiaoshou was throbbing with the desire to battle. It looked like everyone around him was charging over to attack him. He pointed to the black sword at his side and said, \u201cThis is a ninth-grade spiritual sword. Whoever can defeat me\u2026\u201cHey, why are you fighting over there. Listen to me speak!\u201cHey, hey!\u201cHere, look at me!\u201dHe was halfway through his speech when the crowd thought that he was insane. They ignored him and continued with their battle.Xu Xiaoshou was furious. He hit the few people approaching him to the ground with a few slaps.\u201cAll of you stop!\u201dWhen his furious roar rang out, everyone could once again sense the power of an Innate Stage Fighter, and they all felt intimidated, a chill running down their spines. What was going on? Why had they strangely stopped once again?When they turned their heads again, all they saw was a few people kneeling in front of Xu Xiaoshou, clutching their faces.Level Five, Level Six, Level Seven\u2026What was going on? Why were they kneeling?Everything had happened so fast. Even the people who\u2019d been slapped were confused. \u201cDidn\u2019t I come to beat him up?\u201d they thought. \u201cWhy did my face suddenly hurt before I knelt?The people who had seen everything the most clearly were the three people in the spectator seats.There was a look of shock on Rao Yinyin\u2019s face. She said, startled, \u201cXu Xiaoshou sure is strong. To think that he has such speed and power despite only being Level Five.\u201dSu Qianqian repeatedly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThe judge was confused. He had turned his head and wasn\u2019t paying attention. Why was there another Innate aura? Who was releasing that?!3There were no such experts in his line of sight!As a judge, he felt that he had to put a stop to Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s method of interrupting the competition. Thus, he opened his mouth and said coldly, \u201cCandidate, please do not disrupt the battle. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to take action and make you leave!\u201d\u201cHow am I disrupting the battle?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou countered. \u201cI\u2019m also in the field. I\u2019m a candidate!\u201dThe judge didn\u2019t have a rebuttal. What Xu Xiaoshou said made sense!\u201cHowever, the competition has to continue!\u201d the judge rejoined.Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. \u201cIsn\u2019t the competition still going on!?\u201dHe turned to look at the crowd, his eyes incredibly sincere. \u201cAll I wanted to say was\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll give whoever can break through my defenses with their bare fists this ninth-grade spiritual sword!\u201d4He pulled out the black sword and activated his spiritual strength. A spiritual glow circled the black sword as the sword\u2019s aura spread throughout the surroundings.This has to move them.\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +86.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless. Why did no one believe him?He looked at the judge and tossed him the sword. \u201cYou can be my witness!\u201dThe judge was confused.Did I agree to your request? Why did you toss the sword over to me?\u201cThe responsibility of the judge is to prevent any candidate from being injured or killed,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said before the judge could say anything. \u201cThere\u2019s no rule preventing me from doing this in the arena, right?!\u201dThe judge was speechless.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dSomeone in the crowd suddenly spoke up. \u201cI agree with what Xu Xiaoshou said!\u201d It was a tall man with a cultivation level of Level Seven. However, his eyes were glued to the black sword.\u201cI also agree!\u201d\u201cAgreed!\u201dThe scene changed instantly. A few dozen people stared at the ninth grade spiritual sword, all of them almost drooling.The tall man who was the first to speak looked at Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cIs what you said true?\u201d\u201cYes, truer than anything else in the world!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou immediately said loudly when he saw that someone agreed with him.This group of people would never be moved by something that didn\u2019t interest them. They were all birds from the same feather!1The three people in the spectator seats were taken aback by Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s actions. They looked at the rest of the arenas. The battles there were extremely heated. Each one of them seemed to be a fight to the death.As for arena number 12\u2026 It now looked more like an auction house.The host, Xu Xiaoshou, had captivated the crowd with his devilish words. The auction assistant, the judge, was holding the spiritual sword in hand. A group of people looked at him with hungry eyes.1Rao Yinyin covered her forehead with her palm and sighed, \u201cWhat a weird development!\u201d\u201cBrother Little Beast is so impressive!\u201d Su Qianqian balled her hands into fists.3Elder Qiao was dumbfounded. He picked his jaw up off the floor.\u201cThat lad, just what on earth is he doing!\u201d3Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7The judge looked melancholically up at the sky. This was the first time he had encountered such a difficult candidate.The judge couldn\u2019t stop him. Xu Xiaoshou was a candidate, after all. Even though it was a little crazy to want to fight a hundred people alone, it didn\u2019t go against the rules of the competition.However, if the judge didn\u2019t stop him, he felt that this situation would devolve into a slapstick drama. Would the group-stage competition be reduced to a large-scale casino?1\u201cSo what do you think?\u201dThe judge felt a little giddy when faced with Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s question and the expectant gazes of the other people in the group. He didn\u2019t know what to do with the black sword in his hand.In the air, the chief judge, Xiao Qixiu, noticed what was happening in arena number 12.He couldn\u2019t help but notice what was going on. The rest of the participants had started battling in the other arenas. However, this arena was still silent, as though a class was in session.One person was talking while a group of people listened\u2026Xiao Qixiu smiled and projected his voice over to the arena. \u201cGood, a brazen youth! Agree with his request. Let him suffer a little.\u201dNow that the judge had approval from his superior, he immediately waved his hand and said, \u201cAgreed. Continue the competition!\u201dA glimmer immediately appeared in the tall, muscular man\u2019s eyes. He flew out of the crowd before anybody else could, his eyes greedy.\u201cI have a technique called the Hundred-Step Beast King Fist. Your sword is mine!\u201d1The group behind him, who was still hesitating, suddenly became frustrated when they saw that someone had already taken the initiative to go after Xu Xiaoshou.Indeed, the opportunity always goes to the person who seizes it first. What a waste of such a great sword. The sword had just sat collecting dust in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hands, and now it was being wagered as a bet. It would fall in the hands of a pugilist now.\u201cSenior Liu, do you want to give it a try? Your Great Darkness Calamity Fist\u2026\u201d Zhou Zuo was a little tempted to take action. However, he knew where his strengths lay and didn\u2019t dare to attack.5Liu Zhen hid within the crowd and shook his head slightly. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve also achieved a breakthrough, that Xu Xiaoshou seems to have transformed into something extraordinary. Let\u2019s just observe the situation for the time being.\u201d2Looking at the familiar scene, he remembered how Xu Xiaoshou had made the corpse collectors cower that day he\u2019d come out of his seclusion. Had he really achieved such a great breakthrough after only undergoing one death seclusion?1\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +12.\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know what the crowd was thinking. He looked at the muscular man approaching him with raised fists. The man was laughing into the air, looking incredibly prideful.\u201cHaha, come!\u201dAs soon as he said this, an illusory image of a tiger and an accompanying roar swept over the arena, making everyone tremble. When they came to their senses, they saw a barrage of heavy punches thrown at Xu Xiaoshou in less than a second under the illusory figure.\u201cBoom, boom, boom\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t use any techniques. He put up his bare fists, intending to take on the Hundred-Step Beast King Fist, a spiritual technique at the peak of the Acquired Stage, with his naked fists!1The spectators instantly erupted into exclamations.\u201cHis bare fists?\u201d\u201cHe must be mad!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the source of his confidence? He wants to take on Qiu Wei\u2019s Hundred-Step Beast King Fist alone?\u201d\u201cHng, doesn\u2019t that Xu Xiaoshou only know that one White Cloud Sword Technique? I heard that he only managed to learn the first stroke after practicing it for three years\u2026\u201d5The crowd saw the four fists hit each other, and the sound of fists clashing rang out hundreds of times over, shaking the eardrums of everyone present.Everyone saw Xu Xiaoshou, who was under the barrage of Qiu Wei\u2019s fists, striking back indiscriminately. All of his punches landed on thin air. On the other hand, the muscular man got out several tens of punches with every breath, each one of them connecting with Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face.\u201cOh God, how brutal. I can\u2019t look on anymore!\u201d\u201cThat Xu Xiaoshou must have come here to be funny. Does he really not know any fist techniques?\u201dEven the judge was shocked. This person\u2026\u201cAt first I thought he came here to just joke around,\u201d he thought. \u201cThen later I felt that he was a powerful fighter. Now, it seems like he really did come here just to joke around!\u201d2Every punch hit Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face, and he was beaten around so much that he couldn\u2019t tell left from right. He looked like he was about to fall, but he didn\u2019t take a single step backward.He couldn\u2019t move back. He\u2019d exit the arena if he took another step backward.Just as the others had said, Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know any fist techniques. He\u2019d also never heard of the so-called Hundred-Step Beast King Fist.\u201cHowever, why should that affect my combat ability?\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019m strong, so I can be willful!\u201d1The punches that landed on his face only caused him slight pain. In fact, it\u2019d even punched away the weird sensation lingering in his body from yesterday night. The punches didn\u2019t injure him at all!2As the flurry of punches continued to rain down on him, the notification panel in his mind constantly updated itself.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +34.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +46.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +32.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +42.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou was elated. He saw the notification panel update like crazy while he took the fist technique head-on. This fist technique was blasting him with a hundred punches every second. He was loving all the Passive Points he was amassing!9Just as he\u2019d expected, a person who only knew an Acquired-stage fist technique couldn\u2019t break through the defenses of Strengthen at the Innate Stage.Even if the cultivation level of the other party was Level Seven!\u201cAre you helping me scratch my itch?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said, taking advantage of a lull in his opponent\u2019s attack. His mouth was hit by a flurry of punches the next second.The muscular man, Qiu Wei, became increasingly shocked the more he attacked him. He was already starting to feel tired. Why was it that this person didn\u2019t seem to sustain any damage from his punches?\u201cDie!\u201d he shouted in fury when he heard Xu Xiaoshou. His body suddenly turned red and released white smoke. The speed of his fists doubled.2\u201cBlood Ignition Technique?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s gone mad. Qiu Wei has gone mad!\u201dEveryone was captivated by the battle, their blood boiling. The current speed of Qiu Wei\u2019s fists could allow him to rival a Spiritual Cultivation Level Nine fighter!\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +94.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +88.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +102.\u201d2\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was elated. He was completely overcome with joy!The Passive Points continued to skyrocket on the notification panel in his mind. 500, 700, 900, 1000\u2026He shouted as he got hit, constantly goading on Qiu Wei. \u201cYour attacks are great!\u201d1\u201cFaster!\u201cYes, just like that. Keep going!8\u201cIt feels great, oh!\u201d His fists landed on his throat.15The crowd was speechless.The judge was speechless.The spectators were standing quite far away from the battle and couldn\u2019t hear what the two people were saying. However, they were all shocked by the brutal scene.\u201cWill your Brother Little Beast\u2019s head turn into a pig\u2019s?\u201d Rao Yinyin smiled as she asked this.She looked at Su Qianqian. The young lady was staring intently at Qiu Wei, her eyes filled with murderous rage.Rao Yinyin didn\u2019t know what to say.The crowd\u2019s blood was boiling with the desire to take Qiu Wei\u2019s place and be the one to give the brazen Xu Xiaoshou a beating. It only took one of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s fists flying toward someone close by to ignite a large battle.All of them were young and hot-blooded, so they\u2019d naturally become impatient after waiting for such a long time. Furthermore, hearing Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s cries had fueled their bloodlust.A portion of the crowd started fighting each other off to the side, while another portion chose to continue waiting.In actuality, Xu Xiaoshou and Qiu Wei hadn\u2019t been battling for that long at the edge of the arena, but the hundreds of blows they\u2019d exchanged in a matter of seconds had thrilled the spectators.\u201cLook, that Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s legs\u2026 It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s moved from his original position,\u201d a weak voice suddenly came from within the spectating crowd.3Everyone immediately looked at his legs. Indeed, under the fast fists, Xu Xiaoshou was like unanchored duckweed. He was shaking and looked like he was about to fall.He looked a little off-center, but in actuality, he hadn\u2019t moved from his original position.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that possible?\u201d\u201cCould it be like Xu Xiaoshou said and that it\u2019s true that he learned an invincible technique?\u201dThe Level Seven fighter who\u2019d been slapped by Xu Xiaoshou into kneeling just now cradled his face and said indignantly, \u201cI said before that he\u2019s very powerful, but you guys didn\u2019t believe me\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Did you say something just now?\u201dThe Level Seven fighter was speechless.He was a Level Seven fighter, yet he didn\u2019t even seem to exist in this group-stage competition\u2026 That darned Xu Xiaoshou had stolen the show.Through the gaps between the flurry of punches, Xu Xiaoshou accidentally saw that a few battles had broken out in front of him. There went a good number of passive points. He became anxious again.Why are you guys so anxious? Can\u2019t you wait a little before fighting?He felt that he had to change his strategy!Qiu Wei was unleashing a torrent of attacks. He suddenly saw Xu Xiaoshou, who looked like he was about to fall at any second, stand up straight. Xu Xiaoshou said calmly amidst the barrage of punches, \u201cYou\u2019re tired. You need to rest.\u201dThe next moment, an ordinary punch landed on Qiu Wei.1Boom!The air crackled. Qiu Wei was instantly sent flying and crashed into the crowd.\u201cTake a rest. We can fight again later. Wait for me!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou shouted at him from far away.Qiu Wei was immensely useful for farming Passive Points. He must not lose him.Qiu Wei was dumbfounded!\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he thought. \u201cI attacked you for what felt like half a day and tired myself out, yet you didn\u2019t sustain any damage, and you even asked me to take a rest?\u201d1The rest of the people saw Qiu Wei get flown back into the ground from the ordinary punch, and took a few steps back in retreat.Everyone now knew that Xu Xiaoshou had merely been pretending to be weak. He was a terrifying boss with an incredibly powerful body!\u201cMy God, is he really only Level Five?\u201d\u201cHis body is more terrifyingly strong than that of a Level Eight or Level Nine fighter!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of spiritual technique is that? Why have I never heard of it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a spiritual technique,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou laughed calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s Strengthen at the Innate Stage!\u201dThe crowd was speechless.Like we\u2019d believe you! Was Strengthen at the Innate Stage really as powerful as this?5\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +32.\u201dSigh. Why was it that no one believed him when he told the truth!?Xu Xiaoshou waved his hands in frustration.\u201cI was telling you guys the truth,\u201d he thought. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201dHe scanned the crowd and saw the battles happening at the back. \u201cYou guys over there, stop fighting. I\u2019m your opponent!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll fight you!\u201dA man with a nose like a beak flew forward. He was Ye Zhongting and had a cultivation level of Level Eight.1\u201cI have a technique called the Sun Offering Fist,\u201d he shouted crisply. \u201cDo you dare to take it head-on?\u201d6Without waiting for Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s reply, he threw a punch at Xu Xiaoshou. His fist flew at him, blazing with flames and billowing thick clouds of smoke.Sun Offering Fist?Xu Xiaoshou knew of this fist technique. It had to be charged for a long time and emphasized using one strike to neutralize an opponent.He tilted his body to the side to avoid the frontal assault. He chopped his palm down toward the other party\u2019s wrist and took advantage of his opponent being in pain to grab his neck. He then made use of his opponent\u2019s momentum and sent him hurdling out of the arena.Ye Zhongting was speechless.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d he thought. \u201cYou weren\u2019t like that when fighting Qiu Wei just now.\u201d2He nearly started bawling.He was Level Eight. He was a powerful force who was a contender for the number one spot in the group. However, he\u2019d been thrown out of the arena because he\u2019d been careless.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were going to take the attack head-on? You big liar!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought.2He clapped and said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m more interested in fist techniques that can blast me with hundreds of punches in a second. Don\u2019t approach me with a technique like the Sun Offering Fist. Go and fight somewhere else!\u201d1He glanced at the notification panel after he spoke and trembled.Passive Points: 1766.That meant that just Qiu Wei alone had given him over a thousand Passive Points!With that as a precedent, why would he waste his time on a fist technique that could only hit him once?4The crowd looked at Ye Zhongting outside the arena and felt that they were now no longer the hunters but the hunted.\u201cStop!\u201dXu Xiaoshou shouted again. Everyone weirdly stopped fighting. The arena, which had been ablaze with fighting, instantly became deathly quiet.The judge had a few failures on his hands. He was suddenly interrupted halfway through his job. His fury soared!He constantly told himself not to be impulsive. That person was also a candidate\u2026Xu Xiaoshou looked around with a belittling gaze, once again igniting the fury in everyone\u2019s hearts. He then suddenly flicked his sleeves and grabbed his legs, which had largely stopped trembling. He took on a fighting stance.\u201cTime is limited. All of you can attack me at once!\u201d1Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8In the air, Xiao Qixiu, who\u2019d been observing arena number 12 from the start, smiled slightly.The outer yard disciples this year were high-quality candidates. This was the third Innate Stage fighter he had discovered today.This person had an Innate Stage physical body that was incredibly difficult to detect. That was really rare!If not for the two faint consecutive Innate Stage auras that had appeared, even he would have been fooled by the young man called Xu Xiaoshou.That lad really had\u2026 Um, a strange talent.1In the arena.A group of people lost all rationality when they heard Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s words.A mere Spiritual Cultivation Level Five fighter dared to say such insolent words? Just because his body was strong without parallel didn\u2019t mean his body had actually reached the Innate Stage.\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. This lad is really asking for a beating!\u201d\u201cIt looks like just one person won\u2019t satisfy him. Since that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s all join forces and send this limp prawn out of the arena!\u201d1\u201cBrothers, attack!\u201dForty to fifty people pounced forward at the same time. Some of them had their fists raised, some carried swords, while some hid around and prepared to launch sneaky surprise attacks and manueverings\u2026Xu Xiaoshou looked at the forty to fifty murderous people in front of him and trembled. Their dark expressions were rather terrifying.However, he steeled his nerves and charged forward. He roared furiously to boost his courage, \u201cIf you\u2019re a man, use your fists. Those of you who are wielding swords, put them down if you have the guts!\u201dBoom, boom!Mayhem instantly erupted, and Xu Xiaoshou was swarmed by a wave of people. Su Qianqian, who was in the spectator seats, let out a nervous squeal when she saw the scene, and she tightly grabbed onto Rao Yinyin\u2019s rather short red dress.\u201cHe\u2019s quite daring!\u201d Rao Yinyin observed Xu Xiaoshou being clobbered and laughed.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +14.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +16.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe notification panel got updated once again. Xu Xiaoshou charged into the crowd and took on countless punches with his body. He used his fists to sweep the people wielding swords to the side and kicked them out of the arena.He didn\u2019t want to fight anyone using blades, swords, or daggers\u2026\u201cF***,\u201d he thought. \u201cThere are even people using silver needles?\u201d1\u201cGet out of the arena, all of you!\u201cIn my arena, we fight to the death with our fists!3\u201cI can endure thousands of punches, but even an Innate-stage physical body will bleed when slashed by a spiritual weapon, even if it\u2019s one without a grade.\u201cSo all of you are fated to leave the arena!\u201dXu Xiaoshou cleared the arena and expanded the battlefield. At the same time, he experimented with different poses so that he could receive even more punches at the same time.2A human body\u2019s surface area was rather limited. Even if forty to fifty people were charging over toward you, not more than ten people could actually hit you at the same time.However, it was different for Xu Xiaoshou. He pounced, crawled, and leapt the moment a punch landed on him. He tried every possible way to get everyone to hit him.The only thing he needed to pay attention to was protecting his vital areas from being damaged.2\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +11.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +22.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +33.\u201d4The Passive Points reflected in his notifications continued to increase in his mind. It started from the tens and slowly rose to the twenties, then the thirties\u2026Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s technique became more and more refined. At the same time, his attackers became more and more excited as they continued to attack.They couldn\u2019t see the brazen lad. However, for some reason, their punches would always land on that lad\u2019s detestable face every time they threw one out.4Every punch that connected with his flesh felt amazing!It felt really good!1\u201cAm I actually this powerful?\u201d some thought.Some people had even closed their eyes as they were fighting. They felt as though they\u2019d reached an epiphany and become more in tune with the path of cultivation.This is\u2026 what the Innate Stage feels like!Mum, I achieved a breakthrough!1The judge was in a daze. This was a brutal scene!He saw the handsome face of the insolent lad from just now get beaten into a new shape by the people surrounding him.1His caved-in abdomen, his raised forearms, and even his stiff toes were terrifyingly brutalized at every moment.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shoes had fallen off during the beating, as he\u2019d found that he could extend his toes to create more surface area for punches that way.2The judge was dumbfounded. Had those people consumed drugs? Why had they suddenly become so ferocious!?2He saw a person who was Level Three. \u201cWhat is he doing? He\u2019s closing his eyes?\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201cDidn\u2019t his punch hit the air? Why did it coincidentally hit Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shoulder?\u201cThere\u2019s also a Level Two fighter over there\u2026\u201cWhat?\u201cHow could he have persisted and not been thrown out of the arena until now?\u201cMy God!He was nearly sent out of the arena, but Xu Xiaoshou hooked himself back in with his foot.1\u201cHow is that possible?!\u201dThe judge broke down!2The situation felt off the more Xu Xiaoshou fought. Why had the number of people decreased?Xu Xiaoshou clearly looked like he was trying hard to stay in the arena. Even so, the number of people in the arena had gradually dropped from sixty to just over forty.Suddenly, he saw a few figures hiding deep within the shadows. They were picking on the people who had their eyes closed and were experiencing the path of cultivation. Anybody who closed their eyes would definitely be sent flying out of the arena.\u201cDarn them. They dare to attack my Passive Points?!\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou secretly adjusted his posture and slowly closed in on those poisonous tumors before sending them flying out of the arena one by one.These scheming candidates were the first to be sent flying by Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s strange fighting style.All the people who\u2019d been sent flying outside of the arena were dazed. None of them knew how they\u2019d gotten eliminated.In the spectator seats, the young lady, Su Qianqian, had covered her eyes with her hand, not daring to look at the scene. Even Rao Yinyin felt that it was a little over the top.In the arena, the competitors stopped crowding together as they\u2019d had at the start. Instead, they gradually expanded their formation and created a large net.The attackers at every point of the net didn\u2019t have to move too much. All they had to do was send Xu Xiaoshou flying and wait for Xu Xiaoshou to be pushed back to them.The \u201cpitiful\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was like a sandbag. He was sent flying all around the offensive web and hit on every part of his body.1The judge thought that it was about time for him to step in. Even though he felt that Xu Xiaoshou was detestable and wanted to give him a few punches of his own, he was a stoic judge. He had to calmly enforce the rules.Just as he was about to shout for the competitors to stop, he suddenly caught a glimpse of the 'sandbag\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression.What kind of perverted expression was that!?5He had a wide smile, which made him look like he was enjoying the process. He had a comfortable look under his swollen face. He looked incredibly at ease.9It was simply\u2026He didn\u2019t look like someone who was being attacked. Instead, he looked as though he were enjoying a massage\u2026He listened closely and realized that the sandbag was chattering continuously amidst the volley of punches.\u201cIt feels great!\u201cPunch me harder if you have the guts.\u201cFaster. It\u2019s best that you hit me a thousand times in a second!\u201cF***. You can\u2019t kick me there\u2026\u201d12The judge was speechless.24He silently lowered his hand that he\u2019d been about to raise to stop the violence, and decided to keep quiet.1Perhaps he doesn\u2019t need me to get involved\u2026\u201cDong\u2026\u201dThe ancient chime of the clock once again reverberated from the horizon, making everyone jump. Xiao Qixiu\u2019s voice followed: \u201cThere\u2019s an hour left until the end of the group-stage competition!\u201dHe\u2019d made this rule up just now on the spot specially for arena number 12.2That was because the battles in the rest of the seventeen arenas had all ended a long time ago.The battles in the other arenas had all been simple and traditional in style. The most powerful fighters had sat off to the side and meditated while those less powerful cleared the field, indigantly fighting each other until only one was left.A magnificent and brutal battle had only erupted in arena number 12.At this moment, all of the people who\u2019d been sent out of the arena gathered in the spectator seats of arena number 12, even though they could\u2019ve gone back to rest if they\u2019d wanted to.All of them watched the merciless scene with wide eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThe people in arena number 12 are too insane!\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t even see him as human. They\u2019re beating him up like he\u2019s a beast!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019d be fine if they were just surrounding him and beating him up. But why the extreme method? They should give him some respect and not hit his face\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, yes. We\u2019re from the same spirit palace and are bound to encounter each other someday. Tsk tsk!\u201dA weak fighter would often attract the sympathy of the onlookers. Some of the female disciples couldn\u2019t bear to watch the fight any longer and started bawling. They cried as they cheered Xu Xiaoshou on.3\u201cDarn it\u2026 Ah, I wasn\u2019t talking about you\u2026 Xu Xiaoshou, hang in there!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, hang in there!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, you\u2019re the best!\u201d2The cheers spread like wildfire the moment the first one rang out, filling the entire arena.The spectators who didn\u2019t know the reason for the beating voiced their outrage, saying it was unjust. They cheered Xu Xiaoshou on as they furiously looked on at the people who had just been sent flying out of arena number 12.The people who had \u201cvoluntarily exited the arena\u201d felt indignant. \u201cWhy are you guys saying that when you don\u2019t even know the truth? Why don\u2019t you get in the arena?\u201d they thought to themselves.In the arena.Xu Xiaoshou dropped all pretense when he heard that he only had less than an hour left.1He had long drawn the crowd to the edge of the arena while being beaten up. On the surface, this group of people looked like they were dealing a great deal of damage, but they had actually been manipulated by him.This was like taichi. Once the momentum was created, even the attacker wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.4Xu Xiaoshou jumped toward the area outside the arena. All of the attackers followed like moths to a flame, looking shocked as they found themselves leaping out of the arena.2In that instant, the arena fell silent.\u201cMy God!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dEveryone in the spectator seats erupted into exclamations. There must be something wrong with arena number 12. They were fighting like absolute maniacs and now they were jumping out of the arena just because someone else had jumped?Had they been frightened by the cheers and suddenly felt irreversibly ashamed?In the arena.After Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s actions, only four people were left in the arena, excluding the judge.He forcefully dragged over the muscular man who had been the first to attack him. His name was Qiu Wei, right?\u201cThere\u2019s still about half an hour left. I thought about it for a long time and still think that your damage output is the best. Come, let us fight again!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said sincerely.This person\u2019s Hundred-Step Beast King Fist was equivalent to 50 elite soldiers!Qiu Wei turned pale when he heard that. He looked around him and found no friends.An indescribable feeling of fatigue swelled up within him. He retched, then immediately jumped out of the arena.4Xu Xiaoshou was perplexed.The judge could no longer watch. He waved his hand and said, \u201cThe competition has ended!\u201dOff to the side.Liu Zhen let out a deep breath as he watched Xu Xiaoshou, who had destroyed both the minds and bodies of the competitors. He said, rather relaxed, \u201cI told you to wait. I wasn\u2019t wrong, right? We placed in the top ten\u2026\u201d1Zhou Zuo swallowed, his face filled with shock.\u201cBrother Liu.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in the top three!\u201d2Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9\u201cXu Xiaoshou won?\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou won!\u201dThe battle had ended. The barrier fell.The loud cheers coming from the spectator seats startled Xu Xiaoshou. He turned around to take a look. \u201cWow, when did so many people come?\u201d he thought.\u201cAll of the outer yard disciples who were at the Chuyun Platform are here!\u201dMany junior disciples were in tears amongst the spectators. Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know what they were crying about and could only assume that they\u2019d gone insane.\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +324.\u201d\u201cGot respected. Passive Points +1125.\u201d15Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the notification panel and nearly fell to his knees in shock.What was this?He could understand the first wave of doubt that he\u2019d received. After all, Xu Xiaoshou had become the champion of the group-stage competition even though his cultivation level was only Level Five. He would naturally be doubted to some extent.Even though Liu Zhen and Zhou Zuo were also on the stage, anybody with eyes could tell that they had slacked off during the competition. That meant that Xu Xiaoshou was obviously the champion.As for the \u201crespect\u201d he\u2019d gotten after that\u2026He couldn\u2019t really explain that!Also, it seemed like it was the first time this had appeared on the notification panel.Then\u2026Over a thousand Passive Points???Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.He\u2019d been fully concentrated on getting beaten up to earn more Passive Points and hadn\u2019t realized that he\u2019d become a determined individual who\u2019d never give up before turning the tide and achieving glory in the eyes of the spectators!After all, in the eyes of the people who\u2019d come later, he was a living sandbag being beaten up by the other competitors.Those people were beasts. How could they be so heavy-handed with him? Look at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face. It was all green and purple\u2026Oh? Why were his injuries so minor?The judge walked over with a tray in his hand, his face expressionless. The prize was a single ring.Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow. A space ring?1That was a valuable item. He\u2019d never be able to afford such an item, even if he sold both his yard and his black sword.He picked up the ring and pointed toward the judge\u2019s trembling hand. He then said sincerely, \u201cThank you, but you need not be excited for me.\u201dThe judge\u2019s hands trembled even more when he heard this.Do I seem excited? Holding this tray is the only thing keeping me from unleashing my fury.2The judge didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d participated very much at all during the battle, other than interfering with a few battles, which made him feel a great deal of despair.He\u2019d wanted to do his job and fulfill his responsibilities well. However, he\u2019d been forced to stand off to the side and do nothing.1Xu Xiaoshou had fooled him since the beginning. It was only after the battle had ended that he\u2019d realized that Xu Xiaoshou had a darned Innate Stage physical body!\u201cI was wondering where the two auras of an Innate Stage fighter had come from. I didn\u2019t expect it to be him!\u201d he thought.The judge pushed down his emotions and coldly waved his arm. \u201cKeep it up!\u201dThen he turned around to leave.Xu Xiaoshou felt that the judge was acting a little strange. However, he returned the gesture and said to the judge\u2019s receding figure, \u201cI\u2019ll keep working hard!\u201d1The judge\u2019s hand trembled, and the tray flew out of his hands.\u201cOh, my sword!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou shouted behind the judge.1The judge pounced forward to catch the tray he\u2019d thrown. Then he tossed the sword backward without turning his head around.Xu Xiaoshou knitted his brows as he looked at the judge\u2019s back. He couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cHe\u2019s acting so strangely!\u201d2\u2026\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201dEveryone in the spectator seats was shouting. At the beginning, only a few young girls had been shouting, but by the end, the people around them had become so embarrassed that they were being stared at that they\u2019d started shouting along with them.3Xu Xiaoshou felt very embarrassed. He didn\u2019t know why these people were acting so crazy. However, they were shouting his name and all looked very excited. Thus, he waved at the spectators.1\u201cSit down. Don\u2019t stand on formalities.\u201dRao Yinyin stood up and stretched. She pulled down the hem of her dress that the young lady had pulled to the top of her thigh and teased, \u201cYou can go and look for your Brother Little Beast now!\u201dSu Qianqian smiled, revealing the dimples in her cheeks. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. It\u2019s just great that Brother Little Beast doesn\u2019t have to leave the spirit palace now.\u201d\u201cLook at how agitated the girls beside you are. What if they snatch your Brother Little Beast away from you?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about!\u201d Su Qianqian blushed. \u201cThat thought hasn\u2019t crossed my mind.\u201d\u201cOh? Is that so?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ignoring you!\u201dSu Qianqian leapt off her chair, her head accidentally knocking into Rao Yinyin\u2019s chest. She lowered her head and picked up her large sword before running away.4\u201cTsk tsk, how cute\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou noticed the two of them. There weren\u2019t many Innate Stage auras in the area. While his Innate-Stage physical body wasn\u2019t easily detectable, that didn\u2019t mean that the auras of other Innate Stage fighters weren\u2019t.At the very least, their ethereal demeanors were completely different from those of the girls who were screaming his name.\u201cSu Qianqian\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time\u2026\u201dHe was busy looking in the direction the young girl was running when he noticed the girl in the red dress walking behind her suddenly look back at him. She winked at him and smiled.\u201cGot seduced. Passive Points +1.\u201d10Xu Xiaoshou was still a little distracted, but he was so surprised he almost vomited blood when he saw the new notification.1Darn it. Some things should be left unspoken. You don\u2019t always have to announce these things!Broken system!Everyone left.Everyone who\u2019d come was a Spiritual Cultivator. Even though they\u2019d been his fans just now, they\u2019d never do anything out of character.Um, at least in public\u2026Xu Xiaoshou moved to leave, but Elder Qiao appeared before him.\u201cWhat an impressive lad. To think that you were able to turn the tide even after you got beaten up like that. You sure have your methods!\u201d\u201cElder Qiao?\u201dElder Qiao\u2019s expression turned dark. \u201cYou didn\u2019t notice me, did you? All your attention was focused on those two girls?\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said as he walked. \u201cHow could that be? Weren\u2019t you the first to come here?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was relieved. Fortunately for him, he\u2019d made the right guess. He\u2019d also changed his tone so that his words sounded like a statement rather than a question. Elder Qiao didn\u2019t see through his lie.\u201cWhen did you achieve an Innate-stage physical body? You dared to keep it from even me?\u201d Elder Qiao questioned.\u201cWhat? You dare to ask me this question?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt indignant. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you last time that I\u2019ve reached the Innate stage? You didn\u2019t believe me then.\u201dThe last time?Elder Qiao remembered the last time they\u2019d met in the Spiritual Affairs Division and smiled awkwardly. \u201cAt that time\u2026 Only a ghost would\u2019ve believed you!\u201dSeeing that Xu Xiaoshou was about to act up again, he quickly took out a pill bottle and stuffed it into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hands. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been injured!2\u201cHere, I\u2019ll give you this. Go back and tend to your wounds well. I\u2019ll see you next time!\u201d He instantly fled after saying his piece.4Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cDid he have to do that?\u201d he thought. \u201cAll I was going to do was curse a little. I wouldn\u2019t have chewed you out.\u201dHe looked at the pills that Elder Qiao had given him, and felt his heart warm\u2026Oh?Elder Qiao, pills\u2026Xu Xiaoshou suddenly shivered.20\u2026Xu Xiaoshou washed up after returning to his room, then lay down on his soft bed that had been cleaned. He felt comfortable.Even though he had predicted it, actually becoming the champion of the group-stage competition and achieving the best accomplishment he\u2019d had in three years still felt like a dream.All he could say was that the Innate-stage Strengthen was an extremely terrifying technique!In the past, he wouldn\u2019t have lasted even a second under such an attack. However, now, all he had were a few superficial wounds, and his muscles and nerves were a little strained. His injuries were basically non-existent.The swelling and bruising on his face could be healed in just one training session.He thought about the pills that Elder Qiao had given him. He didn\u2019t dare to use them.Xu Xiaoshou took out the champion\u2019s ring and established ownership over it with his blood. He saw that there was a space that was about half the size of a house within the ring, and became elated.There weren\u2019t many things in the ring, only a hundred Spirit Crystals and a bottle of pills. Most of its value came from the ring itself.3Xu Xiaoshou took out the pill bottle and had a look.Spiritual Cultivation Pills\u2026He was shaken. He quickly put the items back, alongside a few of his miscellaneous items.It felt great to have a small storage space everywhere he went.He wasn\u2019t in the habit of wearing rings. Thus, he threaded a piece of string through the ring and made it a necklace.11This was the first victory he\u2019d had in this arduous life. It was very memorable. He had to treasure the ring.2He lay on the bed and adjusted his posture so that he could achieve the greatest comfort.\u201cThen, here comes the main event\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cHow many Passive Points did I gain from being brutally attacked during that pitiful battle?\u201dAside from stealing a few glances at his total Passive Points earlier during the battle, he\u2019d held himself back from looking at the value throughout the battle. He\u2019d tried his best to ignore the number at the bottom of the interface all for this moment!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart beat wildly. He looked at the very bottom of the notification panel in the red interface.He was overcome with happiness, so much so that he felt a \u201cbuzz\u201d in his brain. The notification panel in his mind went dark and then came back on again.His fingers cramped up as he subconsciously counted, \u201cOne, two, three\u2026\u201d\u201cFive\u2026 Five digits!\u201d5Passive Points: 17660.12Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Xu Xiaoshou leapt up off the bed like a spring.17000!He confirmed the number again. It was 17000!\u201cI\u2019ve struck it rich, I\u2019ve struck it rich\u2026\u201d\u201cNot counting the punches that didn\u2019t inflict any damage, 17000 Passive Points means I got punched more than 1000 times if one punch is worth one Passive Point\u2026\u201d9Xu Xiaoshou rubbed the back of his head. \u201cWhat a miserable experience that was!\u201dHe had crossed over to this world, yet he had to sacrifice his body to earn Passive Points\u2026.7How humiliating!However, when he turned his head and looked at the five-digit number again\u2026It felt great!2\u201cCalm down, calm down!\u201dXu Xiaoshou sat on his bed again and forcefully calmed himself down. His hands were trembling he was so agitated.This was just the start. He still didn\u2019t know what he could obtain from the wheel using 17000 Passive Points.This nervous and excited feeling was his favorite.Xu Xiaoshou tapped open the store. The two items on the shelves had already lit up, which meant that he had enough currency to purchase these items.\u201cOh? There\u2019s something new?\u201dHe realized that there was another gray item in the third box.\u201cWhen did this appear?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was curious. He tapped on the option to have a look.\u201cLevel Two Skill Point (Purchase: 5000 Skill Points).\u201d15000?!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes bulged. He only saw the words \u201cLevel Two\u201d preceding it a second later.1The only thing that could fit within the description of \u201cLevel Two\u201d out of his passive skills was the Innate-stage Strengthen.\u201cDoes that mean this Level Two Skill Point is required to level up Strengthen?\u201cDoes an ordinary Skill Point lose its effect on a passive skill that\u2019s reached the Innate Stage? Do all those skills require a Level Two Skill Point to level up?\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou seemed to understand what was going on. However, why was the item grayed out? Why couldn\u2019t he purchase it?1\u201cI have enough Passive Points!\u201c5000 Passive Points into 17000 Passive Points means I should be able to buy three Level Two Skill Points!\u201d2\u201cHmm\u2026\u201cAfter nearly being beaten to death, all I can afford is three Level Two Skill Points.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou felt a little indignant when he thought about it like this.2The new Level Two Skill Point caused him to lapse into thought.\u201cPerhaps the Passive System is correlated with my cultivation level. Could it be that I\u2019ll only be able to purchase the Level Two Skill Point after my cultivation level has increased past the ten levels and into the Innate Stage?\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt that his deduction was valid.If not for this restriction, he could become a saint or a deity just by pumping all of his Skill Points into Strengthen and leveling it up way past the Innate Stage.5But was that possible?According to the Wooden Bucket Theory, a bucket\u2019s capacity was determined by its shortest stave. However, this theory didn\u2019t hold if he only had one long stave.Would a rabbit with a body as strong as a lion be able to defeat a real lion?Hm\u2026Even though it was possible, that scenario probably wouldn\u2019t happen in most circumstances.The rabbit might instinctively run away the moment it encountered the lion.3However, it might trip over itself because of its unnatural physical limitations and send itself into the cavernous jaws of the lion.\u201cThat sounds logical\u2026\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t that conflicted. He didn\u2019t intend to continue leveling Strengthen up anyway. His current Innate-stage physical body was enough.Furthermore, he had a long road ahead of him. He didn\u2019t want to be powerful by depending on just Strengthen alone. He had to expand his skillset.He now had 17000 Passive Points. It was time for him to experience the joy of ten consecutive lucky draws!2\u201cHehe!\u201dXu Xiaoshou rubbed his hands together and purchased ten Passive Keys without hesitation.3Passive Points: 7660.Xu Xiaoshou felt a slight stab of pain in his heart when he saw his Passive Points instantly plummet by 10000. However, he felt a little comforted when he thought about the new skill he might get.Also, he still had over 7000 Passive Points left. He could immediately level any new skill he obtained later to Lv 8 if the skill was powerful enough!1He\u2019d managed to obtain Strengthen in three\u2026 no, four draws the last time, which showed that the odds of obtaining a skill from the wheel were decent.1Xu Xiaoshou followed what he did last time and stuck the ten keys into the red wheel that was covered by fog. He didn\u2019t dare to look at the notification panel while he inserted the keys.The keys vanished one by one as he inserted them into the wheel, and the sound of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s pounding heart was the only thing that could be heard in the quiet room.\u201cHah! RNGesus!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou shouted as the last key vanished, and drew an eight trigram formation in the air before looking at the notification panel.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d6\u201cPuuu!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was so upset he almost vomited blood and fell over.The notification panel had given him five consecutive strikes of despair.\u201cI\u2019ll use my full power!\u201dHis heart was in his throat. But he collected himself and continued looking down the notification panel in despair.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cObtained Extended Passive Skill: Sharpness!\u201d4\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d3Thud!With a thud, the headboard nearly split in half from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s violent strike.One!There\u2019s one!Xu Xiaoshou was excited. He no longer allowed himself the hope of obtaining two skills from this draw, afraid that his heart wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.But he was more afraid of getting \u201cBetter luck next time\u201d ten times in a row. That would send him straight over the edge.Sharpness?1Xu Xiaoshou mulled over the term. What kind of effect would it have?With the two lessons he\u2019d learned from the Breathing Technique and Strengthen, he now knew that the skills he obtained from the Passive System wouldn\u2019t have any awe-inspiring names.But even though their names were incredibly simplistic, all the items from the wheel were incredibly practical, and their names closely matched their effect.Sharpness\u2026What effect would it have?Since this was still an extended passive skill, it should still affect his body rather than have an effect like making the Hiding Pain in his hands sharper.However, which part of his body would become sharper?5Teeth?Hair?Toes?2Xu Xiaoshou looked puzzled. How was this skill useful? Did he draw a dud?He raised his hands and closely examined his fingernails. It seemed\u2026Had his fingernails grown longer?1Or was he just imagining things, sort of like a placebo effect?1Xu Xiaoshou extended all ten of his fingers and stabbed them toward the ground.\u201cSssss!\u201dThe next second, he grinned in pain and shook his hand.1He had pierced four holes into the ground, as well as made a tiny indentation.This\u2026This wasn\u2019t Sharpness!This was Strengthen. It was an effect that came with his Innate Stage physical body!Xu Xiaoshou slipped into deep thought and finally realized a terrifying problem. Could passive skills overlap?This thought nearly made him cry.\u201cDarned system. I spent 10000 Passive Points on this!\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d\u201cThe system wouldn\u2019t be this wicked!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou consoled himself.But when he thought about it\u2026 wouldn\u2019t he be able to draw things like \u201cStrength\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d or \u201cSharp\u201d and \u201cLethality\u201d in the future\u2026?He forced these nightmarish thoughts out of his mind.\u201cIt can\u2019t be like that!\u201d\u201cDefinitely not!\u201dIn that case, there was only one possibility left\u2026Xu Xiaoshou looked at the introduction in the second section.Extended Passive Skill:Strengthen (Innate Lv. 1).Sharpness (Acquired Lv. 1).1\u201cAcquired Lv. 1. That level is too low!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou decidedly told himself.He\u2019d felt the same thing in the past; when Strengthen first appeared, he\u2019d nearly despised it because its level was too low. The technique only showed its terrifying power after it had been leveled up from the acquired state to the innate stage, enabling Xu Xiaoshou, who was only at spiritual cultivation level five, to achieve victory during the group-stage competition.\u201cMaybe the effects of Sharpness will show if I put more points into it.\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou looked at his Passive Points. 7660.\u201cDo I continue spinning the wheel?\u201d\u201cOr should I level up Sharpness?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t I still have one key left?\u201dXu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered that he\u2019d gotten an extra key during his ten consecutive spins, and immediately smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s use that first!\u201dHe inserted the key into the red wheel and fiercely turned it.He saw the key turn into specks of light and disappear, but he didn\u2019t pay much attention to this, as he was too busy thinking about how to utilize Sharpness.The key vanished completely, and Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t able to see the notification panel update before his vision turned black and everything shook.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was startled.

    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Legend had it that there was a sword technique that could move through the heavens\u2014the Seven Swords of the Moving Heavens! When this sword technique suddenly appeared in this world, the most powerful Sword Deity, Old Man You Tu, killed the reigning master of the Holy Divine Palace with seven swords and then went into hiding and became a legend.7Those who came after observed the Seven Swords of the Moving Heavens and created the White Cloud Sword Technique.Of course, the level of this technique was dozens of levels lower than the original.It was merely an ordinary Acquired-stage spiritual technique!The White Cloud Sword Technique was kept in the Tiansang Spirit Palace\u2019s Spiritual Library Division and had a total of thirteen strokes.In the past, Xu Xiaoshou, who\u2019d had average talent then, had put all of his efforts into learning the technique. It\u2019d taken three years for him to finally grasp the first stroke\u2014Fleeting White Clouds!That was the first stroke of a spiritual technique that he\u2019d ever learned. It was also the only stroke he\u2019d ever learned\u2026Yes, more accurately, it was one of thirteen strokes!When the darkness swallowed his mind in blackness, and the world started shaking, Xu Xiaoshou saw Hiding Pain coursing through the clouds, carrying him along.He sliced down with the sword and parted the fleeting white clouds. The clouds then slowly gathered once again.1There was no beginning, nor an end. It was undying.4In that instant, he had countless epiphanies, and an endless number of sword strokes came to mind as he recalled every instance where he had bitterly practiced, holding his sword in the yard at night.1Stab, slice, prod, cleave\u2026Those were the fundamentals. Those strokes and movements had become his instincts through his blood and sweat. He felt those movements naturally come to him at this moment.Xu Xiaoshou looked at the white clouds in front of him and kept his sword.In that instant, the slow-moving glow of a sword suddenly appeared on the horizon. It swept horizontally across the surroundings. It looked slow and carefree, but it arrived in an instant.The clouds were shredded. The sky crumbled to dust.\u201cAh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was jolted awake. He was panting heavily. When he moved, his shirt disintegrated into shreds, just like the clouds in his dream, and fell into his lap.He lowered his head. Hiding Pain was in his hands. It released a crisp hum, seemingly overjoyed.4So\u2026\u201cDarn it, what\u2019s happening?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was utterly confused. All he did was insert the Passive Key into the wheel. The key had disappeared and he\u2019d entered the illusion with the carefree sword will and the clouds, which had even drawn out the most bitter memories that he\u2019d hidden deep within his heart.The White Cloud Sword Technique that he\u2019d only mastered one stroke of out of the thirteen despite practicing it for three years\u2026That was an Acquired-stage sword technique!How unimpressive must one\u2019s talent be to only achieve that after practicing for three years? How could he not be bitter?Xu Xiaoshou calmed himself down. He buried the memories deep down and rushed to look at the notification panel. The Passive Key must\u2019ve had something to do with this incident.A new line had appeared in the notification panel.\u201cObtained an Expertise Passive Skill: Sword Technique Expertise!\u201d7Expertise Passive Skill?Sword Technique Expertise?Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. This was the item that the extra key had given him?\u201cDid I really obtain this passive skill that could possibly be the best passive skill out there? And it\u2019s even a passive skill that appeared with its own special effect?\u201d2\u201cF***!\u201dXu Xiaoshou could no longer stop himself from cursing. Had RNGesus really blessed him?7\u201cSword Technique Expertise\u2026\u201dThe skill\u2019s name made it sound powerful. Its name was a lot better than \u201cStrengthen\u201d or \u201cSharpness.\u201d1Given that the Passive System always used simplistic names, the appearance of a passive skill that had an unordinary name was indicative of how powerful Sword Technique Expertise was.Furthermore\u2026Xu Xiaoshou trembled with excitement when he recalled that scene in the clouds.Could it be that I\u2019ve already mastered the strokes and knowledge of the technique in that illusion?Since what he had were passive skills, the effects often appeared in quiet and unassuming ways. If he hadn\u2019t made the effort to observe the changes, he never would\u2019ve noticed the transformation in his body.The Hiding Pain in his hand was buzzing slightly.It was excited!Xu Xiaoshou could clearly and strongly sense that the non-living Hiding Pain was currently extremely excited. One could even describe it as exhilarated!A thought flashed through Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s mind. \u201cShould I test it out?\u201dThus, he closed his eyes and recalled the sword technique that could shred the clouds to pieces with a mere stroke.His breathing gradually became quiet. He felt himself become light as a feather and float into the air.Ethereal, transparent, serene\u2026What a marvelous feeling.The next moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt like he\u2019d turned into a cloud. He was a fleeting white cloud in a vast painting.While the summer wind blew and the clouds were shredded!Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had to strike now.Thus, he pulled out his sword and subconsciously sliced it through the air. He felt some resistance, but his sword followed the arc he wanted it to and struck down in an instant.It was a carefree strike. The bleak evening wind blew all of the fallen leaves away.1Creak, creak, creak!The scene from the illusion appeared once again. Countless bolts of light from the sword carefully approached yet instantly covered the space in the room.Xu Xiaoshou had moved the sword extremely slowly, yet it seemed to vanish into the horizon in an instant.Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes.Boom!The house, which was made out of redwood, shattered into pieces and fell onto the ground.8Thud, thud, thud!Xu Xiaoshou looked up to see a sky full of redwood fragments. They turned into sawdust and buried him underneath.\u201cF***!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d2\u2026In a narrow, cramped room. There was a round wooden table and three men inside.Xiao Qixiu was sitting up straight. The sword that he carried around on his back was on his knees at this time. He shook his head and said seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t drink alcohol!\u201cYou guys know that a true swordsman would never get drunk on alcohol. They only get drunk on the way of the sword. Drinking alcohol would only mess up my mind and heart. And eventually my sword would no longer be accurate.\u201d4Qiu Qianzhi erupted into laughter, the liquor in his mouth spewing all over the face of the elder sitting in the seat opposite him. He instantly felt embarrassed. \u201cHmph, that was unintentional.\u201dHe turned to look at Xiao Qixiu as he clutched his belly, trying to hold in his laughter. \u201cYou talk as if your sword techniques have improved dramatically because you\u2019ve never drunk alcohol.\u201dXiao Qixiu smiled slightly. \u201cMy techniques have definitely improved\u2026\u201dHe turned to look at the old man who was wiping his face. \u201cDo you plan on staying for long now that you\u2019ve come back, Elder Sang?\u201dThere were still a few blades of grass on the old man\u2019s head. He glared at Qiao Qianzhi, then picked up his glass and downed the liquid within.\u201cI\u2019ll stay for a little longer for the time being!\u201dHe looked at the empty glass and suddenly said, \u201cYou can both be drunk on alcohol and on the way of the sword!\u201d1Xiao Qixiu wanted to say something in rebuttal, but the old man continued, \u201cUnfortunately, you can\u2019t achieve that. Otherwise, the title of the Eighth Sword Deity would already belong to you\u2026\u201dQiao Qianzhi couldn\u2019t hold in his laughter anymore. He roared with laughter. \u201cHAHAHAHA\u2026\u201dXiao Qixiu was speechless.At this moment, the sword on his knees started to buzz and shake violently.The three people looked at each other and all saw the look of shock in each other\u2019s eyes.Xiao Qixiu grabbed his buzzing sword and put his ear to it to have a listen. He saw what was happening nearby in his mind.At the outer yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.The evening wind was blowing slowly. A disciple was taking a stroll with his sword in hand as he reflected on life.Suddenly, the sword in his hand started to grow restless and attempted to free itself from his grip.He was startled. He grabbed onto his sword in a hurry but realized that everyone around him who also trained in the way of the sword had met with the same predicament.\u201cClang\u2026\u201dThe crisp hums of multiple swords sounded, harmoniously connecting as they rang throughout the outer yard.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201dAll of the disciples were dumbfounded.\u201cA sword hum ringing throughout a one-mile area. An Acquired-stage Sword Will?\u201d the old man said calmly.6\u201cYes!\u201dXiao Qixiu nodded and immediately stood up. He exclaimed in shock:\u201cI didn\u2019t expect a disciple from the outer yard to master the Acquired-stage Sword Will. Coupled with the two disciples who reached the Innate Stage in their spiritual cultivation and the one who has an Innate-stage physical body, this batch of disciples is extraordinarily good.\u201d\u201cInnate-stage physical body?\u201dThe old man was shocked. He even put down his cup of wine, as if thinking about something.Suddenly, he changed the topic and said, \u201cI remember the last time such a Sword Will appeared. It was that lass Su Qianqian, right!\u201d\u201cYes, the Innate-stage Sword Will,\u201d he added.Xiao Qixiu looked a little impatient, but he still replied:\u201cYou can\u2019t compare this to Su Qianqian. She\u2019s a bonafide genius, a person who wields one of the 21 famous swords of this continent. Even I\u2019m envious of her.\u201d4\u201cStop putting on an act. Let\u2019s go have a look!\u201d Off to the side, Elder Qiao had also stood up, \u201cYou clearly can no longer suppress your excitement, yet you still force yourself to stay here.\u201dXiao Qixiu awkwardly rubbed the back of his head.The old man smiled and said, \u201cGo!\u201dThe two of them bolted out the door.\u201cTsk tsk\u2026\u201dThe old man still looked calm and collected. It was as if an Acquired-state Sword Will wasn\u2019t enough to interest him.He polished off the remaining wine in the flask, then stood up and put the straw hat behind him on his head. He then grabbed the crutch behind the door and slowly left the room.4Sometime later, he returned to the room. He then closed the door before leaving once again.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Clank!The wooden pieces above Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s head were sent flying.Xu Xiaoshou was lying on the ground naked. He stood up from within his collapsed home, a confused look on his face.\u201cThat is the first stroke of the White Cloud Sword Technique, the Fleeting White Cloud?\u201d\u201cIt must\u2019ve been grossly modified!\u201dHe\u2019d managed to slice the entire building into pieces with one strike. \u201cThis is the White Cloud Sword Technique that I\u2019ve practiced for three years but never dared use?\u201d he thought.2Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t dare to believe it!The execution, path, and movement of the Fleeting White Cloud were similar to before, but its essence had completely changed.The Sword Technique Expertise was rather terrifying.It had given him countless experiences with the way of the sword. Coupled with the fact that Xu Xiaoshou already had a foundation from his sword training, he could instantly convert that experience into practical use.He grabbed a set of clothes from his ring and changed into them. He then walked out of the debris, not knowing what to say for the time being.1He\u2019d only wanted to test out his sword technique. He didn\u2019t mean to destroy his house.However, the house hadn\u2019t been destroyed in vain, as they\u2019d personally gotten to witness the power of his sword technique.He relaxed, and immediately started to feel weak. That stroke had depleted all of the spiritual power in his body.Xu Xiaoshou took out a Spirit Crystal and took a slight whiff of it to recover. His body seemed to have developed resistance after it\u2019d been brutalized by the Spiritual Cultivation Pill the last time.1It was only a tiny whiff. It wouldn\u2019t cause much of a problem.2As his body trembled slightly, Xu Xiaoshou noticed that his energy reserve had increased greatly.\u201cI achieved another breakthrough?\u201dXu Xiaoshou investigated himself thoroughly and ascertained that he had indeed broken through to Level Six. And he hadn\u2019t just reached the beginning stages of Level Six. He had arrived at the peak of Level Six. He was just one step away from Level Seven.2\u201cI unknowingly achieved a breakthrough?\u201d he thought.He remembered the illusion. His cultivation level must\u2019ve risen while reaching an epiphany on the path of cultivation!\u201cThe increase is rather large\u2026\u201d he thought.It\u2019d only taken him three days to reach Level Five. He had then effortfully stabilized his cultivation level after the insane battle during the group-stage competition, as he\u2019d wanted to have a solid transition phase for the time being.However, he had achieved a breakthrough once again!Other cultivators would complain that their progress was too slow, while Xu Xiaoshou was worried that his cultivation level was increasing too fast and that he might not be able to consolidate and solidify his foundation.However, he was clearly overthinking things. Achieving a breakthrough while going through an epiphany naturally meant that he\u2019d become very compatible with the path of cultivation, so how could his foundation be unstable?Advancing only one level during that phenomenon was a rather small increase.A true genius would level up from the Acquired Stage to the Innate Stage when they reached an epiphany!4\u2026Two figures flew over from the horizon. Xu Xiaoshou looked over. This skill of \u201cWalking on the Sky\u201d was something only an Innate-stage expert could accomplish.\u201cXiao Qixiu, Elder Qiao? What are they doing here?\u201d he thought.\u201cThe commotion from that strike wasn\u2019t that loud, was it?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was confused. His yard had a soundproof array, and his strike was incredibly silent. The house might\u2019ve made some sound when collapsing, but why would that alert these two elders?\u201cXu Xiaoshou?\u201d Elder Qiao said in shock when he landed on the ground.\u201cThis is your yard?\u201d Xiao Qixiu looked somewhat doubtful when he saw the young man. Wasn\u2019t this the narcissist from the group-stage competition who\u2019d chosen to be a punching bag despite having an Innate-stage physical body?2\u201cGood evening, Elders.\u201dXu Xiaoshou clasped his hands. He had to show Elder Qiao some respect when outsiders were around. \u201cThis is my yard.\u201dXiao Qixiu closely examined the Sword Will around them and ascertained that the one they\u2019d felt had come from here.Actually, he could\u2019ve realized this just by looking at the house. It had been sliced to such a degree. How could the Sword Will not have come from here?He pointed to the collapsed house and said, \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou hesitated. He did want to keep his technique a secret. However, the situation didn\u2019t allow for this. Thus, he said honestly, \u201cI was practicing a sword technique just now and accidentally sliced the house into such a state.\u201d\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +2.\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cI knew it!\u201d he thought.\u201cI knew that this would happen, even if I spoke the truth!\u201cYou\u2019re looking down on me, Xu Xiaoshou, right? Can\u2019t you just say it straight to my face?!Xiao Qixiu knitted his brows. He almost would\u2019ve believed Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s nonsense if he hadn\u2019t witnessed the young man\u2019s Innate-stage physical body.He knew just how hard an Innate-stage physical body was to achieve. He also knew how hard it was to achieve the Acquired-stage Sword Will.How could these two things come together into the body of a mere Spiritual Cultivation Level Six fighter?2If he had that talent, he wouldn\u2019t have had to stay in the outer yard for three years. He would have reached the Innate Stage and gotten taken into the inner yard a long time ago.Elder Qiao wasn\u2019t so reserved. He took a step forward and slapped Xu Xiaoshou on the head.\u201cOh my, you\u2019re that powerful?\u201cYou should think over your words ahead of time if you want to lie.\u201cI was wrong the last time when I didn\u2019t believe you when you said that you have an Innate-stage physical body. However, if you also claim that you\u2019re the one who achieved the Acquired-stage Sword Will\u2026\u201dThe corners of his lips curled upward. \u201cHehe!\u201dIf this were a different situation, Xu Xiaoshou would\u2019ve argued with Elder Qiao. However, he was now very shocked. Acquired-stage Sword Will?That was what the Sword Technique Expertise gave him? Why hadn\u2019t he noticed that?Hm\u2026Passive skill\u2026It would\u2019ve been weird if he\u2019d noticed that.Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t expect his strike to carry an Acquired-stage Sword Will. It was no wonder that the house had collapsed and these two elders had come to investigate.It was much harder to become a swordsman than a Spiritual Cultivator. The existence of the Acquired-stage Sword Will was a hurdle that countless geniuses couldn\u2019t pass over.However, that clearly didn\u2019t apply to Xu Xiaoshou.Xu Xiaoshou almost wanted to laugh when Elder Qiao doubted him.Elder Qiao had done the same thing when he\u2019d told him about his Innate-stage physical body back at the Spiritual Affairs Division. Hadn\u2019t he obediently come to admit his mistake after the group-stage competition ended?\u201cWhat right does this old fogey have to doubt me?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou laughed to himself.1However, he obviously couldn\u2019t say this out loud. He pointed behind him and said seriously, \u201cThis is my house. Who else could\u2019ve done this but me?\u201d\u201cSigh!\u201dElder Qiao sighed and said in a heartfelt tone, \u201cI know that you\u2019ve become more brazen after coming out of seclusion. It\u2019s all right for the young to be wilful, but there has to be a limit to everything, right?\u201dXu Xiaoshou pouted. \u201cI\u2019m not brazen,\u201d he thought. \u201cI was forced to do this. I\u2019m actually pure and kind.\u201dElder Qiao continued, \u201cSee, now someone that you\u2019ve offended has come to seek revenge. Fortunately, he showed mercy. He only destroyed your house and didn\u2019t take your life, right?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was utterly confused.\u201cWhat kind of imagination is this,\u201d he thought.\u201cDo you have a huge hole in your brain? Or could it be that your entire brain is full of holes?\u201cHe even conjured up an enemy\u2026\u201cI, Xu Xiaoshou, am a cautious and conscientious man. How could I have a mortal enemy?\u201dElder Qiao saw Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shocked expression, and a confident look appeared on his face that seemed to tell Xu Xiaoshou that everything was as he\u2019d expected.\u201cTell me, what swordsman did this\u2026\u201cHng, it\u2019s all right if you\u2019re too embarrassed to say. After all, your house has been destroyed.\u201d\u201cAll right, you need not say his name. All you need to do is point in the direction he headed in, and Elder Xiao and I will go look for him!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was shocked by how Elder Qiao had come up with his own narrative of events and didn\u2019t let him speak.He looked at Xiao Qixiu. Elder Xiao was also a swordsman and should be more dependable. Thus, he shot Elder Xiao a questioning look.Xiao Qixiu nodded slightly and looked like he agreed with the assessment.\u201cWe\u2019ll seek vengeance for your destroyed house in the future.\u201cTell us, where did that swordsman go?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was shocked.These two people would rather believe in the fake enemy that they\u2019d created than believe that he, Xu Xiaoshou, had achieved the Acquired-stage Sword Will?He gripped his Hiding Pain, then pointed it toward his back to signal that he was the one who had destroyed the house with his sword.\u201cTell us!\u201d the two elders encouraged.Xu Xiaoshou gave up. He pointed in a random direction.\u201cKeep at it!\u201d The look in Elder Qiao\u2019s eyes showed that he hadn\u2019t given up on Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cWork hard!\u201d Xiao Qixiu was rather relieved.\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +2.\u201dXu Xiaoshou sat on the ground. He raised his head and looked at the sky. He looked like a deflated ball.2Why did no one believe him? He\u2019d told the truth.7The fleeting clouds in the sky had nothing to say. Only the fallen leaves of the spirit trees in the yard that had been sliced by the energy of the sword echoed his sadness.6\u2026Xu Xiaoshou moved to the guest room. He would publish a mission at the Spiritual Affairs Division tomorrow and get someone to deal with the pile of rubble. It was something that could be solved with a few Spirit Crystals.There was a day for recovery after the group-stage competition. He had to seize the time to get back into tip-top shape.He returned to the red interface in his mind. He still had over 7000 Passive Points.Xu Xiaoshou thought about it. He purchased Skill Points with all of his Passive Points and put it all into Sharpness.10Sword Technique Expertise had given him too much knowledge. He needed to digest it all and shouldn\u2019t rush into leveling the skill up.If his guess was right, Expertise Passive Skills like those would give him a ton of knowledge with every level it increased.1He didn\u2019t plan to level the Sword Technique Expertise up before he fully grasped the Fleeting White Cloud.5As for leveling the Breathing Technique up?One had to be joking. He still wanted to live a few more days!8The Breathing Technique had to remain at Level One before his cultivation level reached the Innate Stage. There was no other reason!5In the notification panel.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSharpness (Acquired Lv. 8).\u201dXu Xiaoshou raised his right hand. His fingernails hadn\u2019t changed, but his fingers had become more slender. They looked surprisingly good.He once again poked his fingers into the ground.Creak!There was no pain!It felt like he was stabbing a piece of tofu with a sword. Even Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s wrist plunged directly into the stone floor. At this moment, his clenched, slender fingers were like blades.12\u201cWow!\u201dIndeed, as he\u2019d expected, the skill\u2019s effects were drastically different now that it\u2019d been leveled up.It was like having two concealed weapons at any given time!2No, they were unconcealed weapons!3They were unconcealed weapons that an enemy couldn\u2019t guard against!Xu Xiaoshou silently stood up. He looked at the small hole in the ground and lapsed into deep thought.2If he changed his fist into a spear when facing an enemy in the future\u20264Tsk tsk!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13At the Chuyun Platform.Two days ago, the platform had been crowded with people and there\u2019d been next to no one in the spectator seats. Today was the complete opposite.The eighteen arenas were still present on the platform. Every seat behind the arenas was occupied. The people in these seats were those who\u2019d been eliminated during the group-stage competition.Only 180 out of over 1700 people had been able to advance to the preliminaries.5An over 90% elimination rate was definitely high!2Xiao Qixiu was still the one standing in the air above the main arena with his sword behind his back. The chief judge made a downward motion with his hands, and the rowdy crowd immediately became quiet.1He calmly took out a piece of paper from within his robes and slowly recited:\u201cCongratulations to you 180 brave warriors for being able to emerge victorious during the group-stage competition and enter the preliminaries.\u201cThe preliminaries this year will still be held in these 18 arenas. The champions of the respective groups will be the master of the arena. Lots will be drawn to determine the opponent they\u2019ll be paired with.\u201dHe took out a blue array token and injected his spiritual source. The array token trembled.In an instant, a large screen appeared above each of the eighteen arenas. The pairing of the competitors would be done through these screens.The crowd became rowdy once again. Xiao Qixiu signaled for them to remain quiet. He still had something to say.\u201cThere are only 64 open slots during the preliminaries. Before the slots are filled up, anybody who can achieve three consecutive victories will advance through the preliminaries.\u201cEveryone will have two chances to challenge the person in the arena. That includes the master of the arena.\u201cOf course, you can start preparing for next year\u2019s competition if you face off against a seeded candidate both times. Alternatively, you can pack up your belongings and leave.\u201dXiao Qixiu chuckled. He folded the piece of paper and tucked it back into his robes.\u201cThe competition starts now!\u201dThe spectators became excited the moment the announcement was made.Compared to the enormous amount of pressure they\u2019d felt before, the spectators who had now dropped out of the competition were all incredibly excited. They cheered on the candidate they were rooting for.\u201cDo your best, First Senior!\u201d\u201cSenior Chao, you have to eliminate First Senior and take first place this year!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, hang in there!\u201d\u201cAhhhh Zhou Zuo, fight for a name for us useless fighters! I love you!\u201d2In the arena, Zhou Zuo was trembling. He could feel his legs shake even though he was just standing there. He\u2019d finally realized that he had gotten through to the preliminaries by doing nothing. It wasn\u2019t a great feeling.He looked around him. Everyone around him had cultivation levels of Level Eight, Level Nine, or even Level Ten. \u201cWhat right do I, Zhou Zuo, a mere Level Three, have to stand amongst these bosses?\u201d he thought.3\u201cSenior Liu, I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201dHe tugged on the corner of Liu Zhen\u2019s shirt. \u201cI might be the first person in the Tiansang Spirit Palace to dare to stand here despite my low cultivation level,\u201d he said, his teeth chattering as he laughed at himself.Liu Zhen took a deep breath. \u201cRelax, you may be the first, but you\u2019re definitely not the only one.\u201dZhou Zuo looked up.Liu Zhen revealed his cultivation level of Level Six and said slowly, \u201cI feel the same.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was the calmest of the lowest-level cultivators in the competition. After all, he didn\u2019t depend on his cultivation level. He could be wilful!3The cheers from the spectator seats were too loud. He covered his ears, unable to stand the insane crowd. \u201cWhy are you telling me to hang in there and make a name for us? Are you sure that you\u2019re not here to curse me?\u201dHe hastened his pace. Xu Xiaoshou wanted to enter arena number 18 and become the master of that arena as soon as possible. He suddenly glanced at the notification panel after passing through the barrier, which blocked out the cheers of the spectators.\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +43.\u201d\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +14.\u201d\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +8.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe notifications appeared one after another. Even though he didn\u2019t get many Passive Points with each update, the stream of Passive Points was pretty consistent.3Xu Xiaoshou had a wooden sword on his back. He involuntarily stopped in his tracks. He then turned back and waved both his arms.\u201cThank you, all of you.\u201d\u201cThank you for your encouragement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll definitely try my best and live up to your expectations. Please give me more encouragement and support!\u201d\u201cI love all of you! Here\u2019s a heart!\u201d2Honestly, he was just giving them a few cheers as a symbolic gesture so that the crowd wouldn\u2019t turn cold. The crowd suddenly panicked when they received such a sleazy reply.\u201cThere must be something wrong with Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cEveryone else has already entered the arena. Why is he still running about outside?\u201d\u201cLook at his foolish expression. Is he really the master of the arena?\u201d\u201cI was wondering the same thing. His cultivation level is only Level Six, two levels lower than mine. How could he be the master of the arena?\u201dXu Xiaoshou checked his notification panel as he ran around the arena. The crowd was too passionate. His Passive Points immediately skyrocketed when he waved his hands.\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +223.\u201d\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +146.\u201d\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +343.\u201dEven though he was being mocked, the crowd did give him a bunch of Passive Points. Xu Xiaoshou felt even better now.\u201cGreat. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re mocking me!\u201d he thought.\u201cMock me some more if you can. Let my points rise even higher!\u201d4With just a little effort, his Passive Points once again reached the four digits. He only had to wave his hands. He didn\u2019t even have to get beaten up. He felt great!The judge paced around in arena number 18.\u201cWhy is that person not here yet?\u201dHe remembered how Xu Xiaoshou had tightly squeezed his legs together the last time and wondered, \u201cDoes he still have something urgent to tend to this time?\u201d He decided to head out of the arena to have a look.He had returned home and summed up his experience after the state he\u2019d been in last time. He felt that he\u2019d been too easily angered by Xu Xiaoshou and had lost his calm.As a judge, that was extremely irrational and inexcusable.So he\u2019d adjusted his frame of mind and returned to a state of zen by the time he\u2019d come to judge these preliminaries.However, that was all blown out of the water when he walked out of the arena to have a look at the situation.What was that lad doing?The competitors in the rest of the arenas had already started drawing lots, but this lad still hadn\u2019t entered the arena to face his competitor yet. He was the master of the arena, yet he was waving and running circles around the Chuyun Platform?The judge was immensely shocked.He\u2019d been angered during the competition the last time. However, this time, he felt like his lungs were about to explode, and the competition hadn\u2019t even started yet!\u201cXu, Xiao, Shou!\u201dXu Xiaoshou abruptly turned his head back around. He looked at the furious judge trying his best to usher him over with a friendly expression.1\u201cHm? The competition\u2019s going to start this soon?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou walked over and arrived before the judge. \u201cAren\u2019t the competitors supposed to have half an hour to regulate their breathing?\u201d\u201cHuh, you sure know the rules quite well!\u201d he thought.The judge\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cYou\u2019re regulating your breathing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He said seriously, \u201cI\u2019m jogging around to warm myself up. Only by first moving my body will I have the strength to compete later.\u201dThe judge trembled. He let out a deep breath and said, \u201cCome in!\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to say a word more to this lad. He turned around and left.Xu Xiaoshou felt that the judge was acting a little strange. However, all he could do was follow him into the arena. As expected, the notification panel fell silent the moment he entered the arena.1What a waste of so many Passive Points!Xu Xiaoshou made an observation. Judging from the situation, he had to be close enough to feel the emotions, words, and actions of the other party for him to obtain any Passive Points.He wouldn\u2019t gain anything if he was separated from the other party by a barrier like this, or if the other party was silently criticizing him from far away.\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was confused.\u201cCould you be even more obvious? There are only the two of us in here, judge!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou secretly thought to himself, when the screen above the barrier started to change.1His name was on the left side and remained unchanged. The right side of the screen was shimmering. Sometime later, what was happening on the right side of the screen came to a stop.\u201cDi Xin\u2019er!\u201dA beautiful lady acknowledged her name and entered the arena. She had a blue spiritual sword behind her back and a cultivation level of Level Eight. She walked over with a bitter look in her eyes.She didn\u2019t want to fight Xu Xiaoshou. That person mainly focused on physical fighting and was incredibly barbaric. If she could, she wanted to spar with another swordsman.That way, she\u2019d be able to gain some experience, even if she was defeated!However, she didn\u2019t have a choice this time. All she could do was give a slight bow after she walked into the arena. \u201cHello, Senior Xu.\u201dShe had only been in the spirit palace for two years and was younger than Xu Xiaoshou. She naturally had to call him \u201cSenior.\u201d\u201cNot good, not good!\u201dXu Xiaoshou secretly thought that the situation wasn\u2019t good when he saw her walk over. Did this girl want to admit defeat?\u201cEven though you might injure me with the sword behind your back,\u201d he thought, \u201cI don\u2019t mind battling you as long as I earn some Passive Points.\u201cBut look at your expression. You\u2019re Level Eight. Your cultivation level is higher than mine. Can\u2019t you be a little more confident?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was afraid that the lady would admit defeat the moment the judge announced the start of the battle. He immediately said:\u201cGiving up and running away before the battle\u2019s even started would be a great disrespect to your opponent and a humiliation to Spiritual Cultivators. If you raise your hands to surrender, it\u2019ll be a black stain on your life!\u201dDi Xin\u2019er froze. This thought had crossed her mind.However, she\u2019d hesitated after thinking about how she only had two chances to fight.When she heard what Xu Xiaoshou said, she accepted reality and decided to put up a good fight.\u201cThank you, Senior Xu. I\u2019ve learned!\u201d\u201cGot appreciated. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou snickered. His expression showed that he hadn\u2019t given up on the girl.3He\u2019d gotten something good before the battle had even started. It was an auspicious sign.The judge\u2019s view of him changed. He didn\u2019t expect Xu Xiaoshou, who frustrated him, to be capable of saying such a thing. It didn\u2019t fit his character.He waved his hand. \u201cBattle, start!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Di Xin\u2019er immediately thrust her sword forward after she finished talking.\u201cWait!\u201dXu Xiaoshou put an arm out to stop her from advancing. \u201cAs the saying goes, a gentleman fights with words, not with his hands. A gentleman fights with his hands, not with his sword!\u201cWhy not do it this way? I won\u2019t use my sword, and you won\u2019t use yours. We\u2019ll both use our fists and brawl it out. How about that?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou set the wooden sword on his back onto the ground as he spoke.1Brawl?Di Xin\u2019er frowned. She knew that Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t mean this and retorted, \u201cI know that you have a ninth-grade spiritual sword by the name of Hiding Pain.\u201dXu Xiaoshou chuckled. He took out Hiding Pain from his ring and set it on the ground.It wasn\u2019t that he was trying to cheat. Yesterday, after training hard and really practicing his sword technique in his yard, he\u2019d realized that it would be better for him to use a wooden sword, which was why he\u2019d been carrying the wooden sword all this time.\u201cI know that you have a powerful body, Senior Xu. However, I only know how to use sword techniques, so let\u2019s battle!\u201d Di Xin\u2019er wasted no words, and thrust her sword at Xu Xiaoshou.Xu Xiaoshou nearly cursed. This lady had tricked him into laying his swords down, and now she was attacking him?1\u201cWomen definitely aren\u2019t to be trusted,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cWhat a liar!\u201d12He hurriedly stood up to avoid the attack. For some reason, he felt that Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s sword was incredibly slow and that she was leaving herself open to attack.\u201cYour sword skills aren\u2019t very refined,\u201d he thought. \u201cTo think that you have a cultivation level of Level Eight.\u201dIn the instant Xu Xiaoshou leaned his body to the side to avoid her attack, he wanted to chop down toward Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s waist using his palm. However, he suddenly remembered the two holes he\u2019d punched in the ground two days ago and immediately clenched his hand into a fist.Di Xin\u2019er quickly reacted. She pulled her sword back and sliced it through the air. Then, she twisted her sword and aimed the blade at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s fist.Her sword would definitely break in two if Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s fist connected with it.\u201cAh!\u201dThe next second, Di Xin\u2019er felt like she\u2019d tripped over something and immediately fell onto the ground.Xu Xiaoshou silently pulled back his left foot, a doubtful look in his eyes.\u201cis this Di Xin\u2019er really at Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight? Why is every one of her strokes predictable?\u201d he thought.5This match would be decided if Xu Xiaoshou picked up his sword and sliced it toward her at this moment. However, how could he do that?It was hard for him to get into a battle. He had to earn a few more Passive Points before it ended.1Di Xin\u2019er seized the opportunity, no longer caring about her image. She rolled on the ground and got out of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s attack radius. Then she stood up, sword in hand.\u201cThat Xu Xiaoshou sure is powerful!\u201d she thought. Xu Xiaoshou sticking out his foot seemed like a stroke of genius to Di Xin\u2019er. \u201cI was careless!\u201dXu Xiaoshou spoke once again when he saw that Di Xin\u2019er had adjusted her frame of mind. \u201cGive it some consideration. Whatever I said just now is true. I wouldn\u2019t lie to you.\u201cNeither of us knows any fist techniques, so our brawl would be fair!\u201dThe spectators had already broke into discussion when they saw how Xu Xiaoshou had used his foot, but when they heard his words, they loudly exclaimed their outrage.1\u201cDespicable!\u201d\u201cThat Xu Xiaoshou is definitely despicable. It\u2019s fine that he used a surprise attack, but why does he insist on a brawl with Di Xin\u2019er?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. How could Senior Di deal with a body as powerful as his?\u201d\u201cIf it were me, I would never agree to his request!\u201dA few female disciples turned red when they heard these words. What kind of crowd was this? They were saying such vicious things.Xu Xiaoshou clearly recognized this problem. He immediately added, \u201cLet\u2019s do this, then. I have an advantage over you because I have a powerful body, so how about I fight you with just one hand\u2026\u201d1When he saw Di Xin\u2019er thrust her sword at him once again, he shouted, \u201cNo hands! No hands!\u201cI\u2019ll fight you with my feet. Let\u2019s brawl!\u201d4\u201cShut up!\u201dEven though she knew that Xu Xiaoshou was intentionally riling her up, she could no longer stand it anymore. A despicable, shameless person like him should be stabbed by a sword.1Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know why this girl had suddenly become so angry. \u201cYou can be angry, but please be more refined with your sword technique. You need not hold back against me.\u201dShe left so many openings that Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know which one to take advantage of.Xu Xiaoshou dodged the attack again, but he didn\u2019t counterattack this time around. Instead, he said sincerely, \u201cGive it some thought. Let\u2019s brawl!\u201dDi Xin\u2019er swiped her sword through the air several times, her face turning red with anger. To think that she had cheered Xu Xiaoshou on in the past. She didn\u2019t expect him to be such a person.\u201cBe careful, Senior Xu!\u201dAfter stabbing thin air a dozen times, Di Xin\u2019er finally realized that Xu Xiaoshou knew some sword techniques and battle movements, so she decided to use her spiritual technique!A pulsing spiritual energy forced Xu Xiaoshou backward. Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s sword suddenly slowed down after she collected herself.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned puzzled. The White Cloud Sword Technique?This lady wanted to fight him using the White Cloud Sword Technique?What kind of a joke was this?Xu Xiaoshou somersaulted and grabbed Hiding Pain. \u201cHm, I shouldn\u2019t injure her\u2026\u201d he thought.He picked up the wooden sword and reacted to Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s Fleeting White Cloud by leaping into the air and maneuvering past the dozens of glowing blades.The crowd was in an uproar.\u201cThat Xu Xiaoshou sure is something. To think that he was able to avoid such an attack. I thought that he\u2019d only be able to take the attack head-on!\u201d\u201cI think that Xu Xiaoshou also knows the White Cloud Sword Technique. I heard that he practiced it for three years, so he might be really familiar with the tricks behind the technique.\u201d\u201cThree years? That lad only managed to master one stroke, the Fleeting White Cloud, in three years!\u201d\u201cWhy is he holding a wooden sword? Doesn\u2019t he have the ninth-grade spiritual sword?\u201dThe spectators looked on in shock as Xu Xiaoshou maneuvered past the web of attacks without getting injured. He shifted from left to right as he faced Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s sword before finally arriving in front of her.Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment, then chose to gently tap on Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s head with his wooden sword, intending to signal that she\u2019d lost.That tap could\u2019ve killed her if he\u2019d decided to wield the spiritual sword instead of his wooden sword. However, the crowd obviously didn\u2019t share the same thinking.\u201cBeast!\u201d\u201cStop it, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cAh, Di Xin\u2019er is mine!\u201d1\u201cDarn you, Xu Xiaoshou. Take the battle seriously! Why are you using a wooden sword!\u201dXu Xiaoshou raised his wooden sword and decided to give her another chance. Since he couldn\u2019t get her to engage in a brawl with him, he could infuriate her and get her to mock him in order to earn Passive Points.1\u201cYour technique is decent!\u201dXu Xiaoshou held his wooden sword the opposite way. \u201cBut you rushed to unleash your web of blades and cast it all in one layer. You lost any way of retaliating the moment your opponent avoided your first attack.\u201dHe looked down with a belittling gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s room for improvement for your Fleeting White Cloud. Keep at it!\u201dHe criticized her area of expertise in the most brazen way possible.A belittling gaze and an arrogant attitude like that made him a great villain!Who could resist becoming eranged and fiercely scolding him!1Xu Xiaoshou felt that no would be able to tolerate what he\u2019d just done. He was very satisfied with his tone.1He didn\u2019t expect Di Xin\u2019er to forget about the sword on her head. She\u2019d started mulling over his words.\u201cWhat Xu Xiaoshou said makes sense,\u201d she thought. \u201cCould it be that his area of expertise doesn\u2019t lie in brawling but in sword techniques?\u201cI heard that he once practiced the White Cloud Sword Technique.\u201dXu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a little awkward. He didn\u2019t know what to do when he saw his opponent freeze. It didn\u2019t feel right to him to just withdraw his sword, but just leaving it there didn\u2019t feel right either.\u201cMiss, we\u2019re in the middle of a battle. Why are you mulling over your cultivation?\u201d he thought.Di Xin\u2019er came to her senses. She raised her head and propped up the wooden sword that Xu Xiaoshou had hit her with. She immediately realized that something was wrong. Why had she slipped into her bad habit again?3This was a battle. She shouldn\u2019t be pondering her technique!1She blushed and put more distance between herself and Xu Xiaoshou. There was a strange look in her eyes. She seemed to want to say something but stopped herself.\u201cGot appreciated. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cIs this lady that innocent? Did she really think that I was giving her pointers?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought.3\u201cAgain!\u201d Di Xin\u2019er ultimately couldn\u2019t find the words to express her gratitude. She twirled her sword around as she moved toward Xu Xiaoshou. It looked like she wanted to engulf Xu Xiaoshou within a vortex of sword energy. \u201cThe second stroke of the White Cloud Technique\u2014Billowing Clouds!\u201dThere was a glimmer in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes. This was a stroke that he hadn\u2019t been able to master even after practicing it for the past three years. To him, this seemed like an opportunity.He prodded his sword toward the vortex Di Xin\u2019er had experimentally created. He then emulated her sword technique and twirled the sword around, using a counteracting force to deflect all of his opponent\u2019s attacks.Di Xin\u2019er froze. She saw her sword get guided toward the side by Xu Xiaoshou while his sword remained on her shoulder. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword stopped for a second before gently tapping her slightly pudgy face.Tap!The sound wasn\u2019t loud. However, everyone in the spectator seats all angrily stood up and voiced their fury.\u201cWhat a beast!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, you won\u2019t die a pretty death if you snatch my Senior Di away from me!\u201d\u201cMove your sword away. Otherwise, I\u2019ll definitely pursue you to the edge of the world!\u201dSome white knights stood on Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s side, but there were also young ladies who had been captivated by both of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s attacks.\u201cAhhh, my heart has melted. Xu Xiaoshou, please tap on me!\u201d15\u201cXu Xiaoshou, fight properly. I forbid you to be this gentle!\u201d4\u201cXu Xiaoshou, you must be insane. You\u2019re flirting with another woman in front of me?\u201d7Xu Xiaoshou felt awkward. He also wanted to have an intense battle but the wooden sword\u2019s offensive capabilities didn\u2019t allow for that. This was the best he could do.Other than tapping on her and hitting her, his wooden sword really couldn\u2019t inflict any damage.4And Di Xin\u2019er wouldn\u2019t be able to last against Hiding Pain!What if he released his Sword Will again and tore this beautiful lady to shreds?Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s face turned completely red. However, she didn\u2019t avert her gaze this time around. Instead, she passionately looked at Xu Xiaoshou.1Xu Xiaoshou froze. \u201cWhat does she mean by that? Does she want an explanation from me?\u201dHe gave it a try. \u201cThat technique should be used as a follow-up to the web of blades from your previous stroke. If you injure your enemy with your web of blades, you can suppress him with the momentum of your sword and achieve victory with a single attack.\u201cHowever, if your enemy manages to avoid your web of blades, you should pull your momentum back and entangle him. In that situation, you should use Billowing Clouds to trap your opponent, stop his attacks, and prepare for your next one.\u201dFor some reason, the other party suddenly looked like she\u2019d an epiphany even though he was talking nonsense.\u201cGot appreciated. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless. He deliberated whether or not to continue earning Passive Points off this lady. Truthfully, he didn\u2019t feel too good about doing that.6Di Xin\u2019er once again put more distance between them and tenderly shouted, \u201cThe third stroke\u2014Within the Cloud and Fog!\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly thrust his sword forward. This time he used a little force and hit Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s wrist with his sword while she was attacking, and the sword in her hand fell onto the ground.Di Xin\u2019er looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock. She had an aggrieved look in her eyes.\u201cCough, cough.\u201dXu Xiaoshou let out a few dry coughs. He couldn\u2019t let this continue. This girl had a strange look in her eyes. Love sparks might fly if they continued this battle.3He pointed his wooden sword at Di Xin\u2019er\u2019s throat. He decided to nip the problem in the bud before any feelings started to develop.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost!\u201dHis tone was arrogant, as he hoped to get a negative reaction from Di Xin\u2019er.Di Xin\u2019er didn\u2019t seem to have noticed anything. Her indignance turned into gratitude. She said with a wide smile on her face, \u201cThank you for your pointers, Senior Xu. There\u2019s a time limit for the preliminaries, so I\u2019ll only be able to learn from you again if I have the opportunity in the future!\u201d\u201cGot appreciated. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know what to say.This girl was hopeless!8Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15\u201cThe battle has ended\u201dThe judge waved his hand and announced Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s victory in the first battle. As soon as he said this, he saw the lad anxiously rush out of the arena even faster than Di Xin\u2019er had.The judge was confused. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked.\u201cHuh?\u201dStartled, Xu Xiaoshou turned back around. \u201cI\u2019m going to rest. Isn\u2019t there half an hour for candidates to rest and recover?\u201dEven though this was his first time attending the preliminaries, he had watched the event the last two years and was very familiar with the rules of the competition.The judge was speechless. Out of all the competitions he\u2019d presided over, he\u2019d never had to deal with a candidate like this.All of the other candidates would either confidently sit in the arena to rest or wave their hands to signal for their next opponent, yet this candidate wanted to run out of the arena?He\u2019d just witnessed this lad engage in a relatively normal battle, which was a rare sight, but now that his battle was over, he was showing his true colors.\u201cWhy do you have to go out? Can\u2019t you rest here?\u201d the judge asked.\u201cIt\u2019s stuffy in here! This lousy place is enveloped by a barrier. There\u2019s nothing in here but you and hot air. Of course I have to go out.\u201d3Xu Xiaoshou felt that what he said was natural enough. However, he couldn\u2019t ignore the judge now that he\u2019d said something. \u201cLet\u2019s go out together,\u201d he said.3The judge was speechless. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that, darn it!\u201d he thought.Xiao Qixiu, who was standing in the air, had a smile on his face. He had also noticed Xu Xiaoshou.More accurately, he had paid special attention to this lad not only because of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Innate-stage physical body, but, more importantly, because he wanted to observe Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword technique.Anyone else might\u2019ve been drawn to Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s unconventional words and actions, but not Xiao Qixiu, who had been drawn to his sword techniques and found that they weren\u2019t as simple as they appeared as he observed the battle from outside the arena.\u201cHe\u2019s also learned the White Cloud Sword Technique?\u201d\u201cDoes that mean he was telling the truth yesterday?\u201dHe and Elder Qiao hadn\u2019t managed to find the swordsman after leaving Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s yard.The swordsman had just achieved the Acquired-stage Sword Will, so he shouldn\u2019t have been able to perfectly hide his aura. However, they hadn\u2019t been able to find him!Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou was really that swordsman?Xiao Qixiu felt that his guess was too ridiculous. Any other person wouldn\u2019t be able to hide their aura, but he thought Xu Xiaoshou was really able to fool a serious swordsman like himself right in front of his face?1There was no way!He turned his gaze to the other arenas. As he\u2019d expected, the other two competitors sent their opponents flying out of the respective arenas at the same time.Xiao Qixiu took out a piece of paper and marked on it as he said, \u201cMo Mo, Zhao Qingteng, three consecutive victories.\u201dXu Xiaoshou heard him say this the moment he left the barrier and was shocked.So fast? Did they even fight?1However, this was understandable. Only they could win so fast.They had ranked first and second last year and were both cultivators at the Innate Stage!He soon stopped caring about the announcement and scanned the spectator seats in hopes of finding Su Qianqian and her friend who had witnessed his battle the other day.But he didn\u2019t find them.The crowd was too large. A lot of people were passionately waving at him.\u201cKeep it up, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cHere, Xu Xiaoshou! I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cWooden sword, that wooden sword. Please pat me with it!\u201d11\u201cXu Xiaoshou, I love you! Ahh, he\u2019s looking over! Ahh, I\u2019m dead!\u201dXu Xiaoshou gave up on his search. It was no big deal. He happily waved his hands and expressed his thanks, and Passive Points appeared on the notification panel in his mind.\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +89.\u201d\u201cGot praised. Passive Points +94.\u201d\u201cGot a love confession. Passive Points +66.\u201d2Love confession?Xu Xiaoshou was startled. What had the system mixed up this time?He felt that this group of people had become even more insane than before the battle. He didn\u2019t know what happened, but he felt like he\u2019d heard the word \u201cwooden sword.\u201dXu Xiaoshou pulled out his wooden sword and pointed it at the spectators.\u201cYou want this?\u201dHis calm, challenging tone coupled with his otherworldly appearance and his body, which was no longer scrawny after being enhanced by Strengthen, made the female disciples in the spectator seats go wild.1\u201cGot a love confession. Passive Points +99.\u201d\u201cGot a love confession. Passive Points +164.\u201d\u201cGot a love confession. Passive Points +323.\u201d1\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +2.\u201d3F***!These people must be mad.Xu Xiaoshou covered his ears and was nearly scared back into the barrier.\u201cCalm down. I can win out!\u201d he thought.\u201cI have to resist this wave of Passive Points. I can do it!\u201d2\u201cXu Xiaoshou, time is up!\u201dThe judge\u2019s angelic voice finally saved him. Xu Xiaoshou quickly scurried back into the barrier, and his surroundings became peaceful again.The screen shimmered, then stopped. The judge shouted the name of his next opponent.\u201cLiu Zhen!\u201dLiu Zhen, who was covering his ears on the Chuyun Platform, was dumbfounded. This\u2026Zhou Zuo walked over from the side. He had already admitted defeat two consecutive times, so he was elated when he saw this scene.\u201cDo your best, Senior Liu. Shed your heavy burden. You can teach him a lesson for Boss Wen while you\u2019re at it. That lad is finished. To think that he dared to tease Senior Di.\u201dLiu Zhen silently walked into the arena.\u201cSo it\u2019s you!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.\u201cEnemies often encounter each other. That\u2019s great. You\u2019re a pugilist, right?\u201cI love fighting pugilists\u2026\u201d he said as he looked at Liu Zhen\u2019s silent expression. His heart suddenly thumped. Did this person also want to admit defeat?\u201cGiving up before the battle is a great disrespect to your opponent. Running away without battling\u2026\u201dLiu Zhen\u2019s expression darkened, and he interrupted Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to admit defeat.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good!\u201cYou\u2019re a real man! Great!\u201dLiu Zhen was speechless.He kept having the feeling that Xu Xiaoshou was putting on an act all to hide his true strength. Reality proved that he\u2019d fooled everyone.Xu Xiaoshou was no longer Level Five when he\u2019d come out of his seclusion. The boastful words he\u2019d threatened people with were true.How else could he have risen to the peak of Level Six in such a short time?Others might not be able to notice his Innate-stage physical body, but Liu Zhen could!

Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe constant updates in the notification panel instantly confused him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought.The judge?Liu Zhen?That\u2019s impossible\u2026Could there be a fourth person in this barrier?Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s pupils dilated. \u201cThis is broad daylight! Don\u2019t scare me!\u201d he thought.\u201cJudge, I suspect that something evil has infiltrated the barrier! Hurry and search for it!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou cried loudly.1The judge slapped a hand to his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he thought. \u201cThis person is acting up again. He only stopped for a little while.\u201dXu Xiaoshou almost cried and laughed at the same time. The notification panel hadn\u2019t stopped updating, but he couldn\u2019t reveal the fact that he had something like the notification panel to the judge.\u201cIt\u2019s true. You have to believe me!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a fourth person in here\u2026 No, it might not be a person!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou pounced forward.The judge\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cGet into position, candidate. Don\u2019t come and hug my leg. Please head back and rest!\u201d\u201cPlease! Head! Back!\u201dLiu Zhen sighed deeply.\u201cHe\u2019s still putting on an act!\u201d\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m an ordinary man who can\u2019t see through you?\u201dHe shook his hands, his gaze landing on the black bag of sand on his forearm. \u201cThis guy is something else. It looks like I\u2019ll have to reveal some of my true powers!\u201d2Boom, boom!He released all of the black bags of sand on his arms, legs, and abdomen, and they fell down on the ground, causing it to cave in slightly.3Liu Zhen\u2019s cultivation level aura constantly climbed: Level Seven, Level Eight, Level Nine\u2026Level Ten!The peak of Spiritual Cultivation!The judge and Xu Xiaoshou looked over at the same time, both dumbfounded. Had this person just been pretending to be weak?Liu Zhen smiled coldly when he saw the shock in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, stop pretending. I\u2019ll use my full powers to defeat you!\u201d\u201cYour methods are useless against me!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought, confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16The judge couldn\u2019t do anything about the strange candidate at his feet. All he could do was wave his hand and say, \u201cBattle, start!\u201d1Liu Zhen raised his fists and charged toward the judge, much to the shock of Xu Xiaoshou.Xu Xiaoshou immediately let go of the judge\u2019s leg. He\u2019d be breaking the rules if he was still messing with the judge after the battle started.He collected himself. He had to be more cautious when facing a Level Ten fighter.Liu Zhen wasn\u2019t as weak as the other candidates in the group-stage competition. Level Ten was already half a step into the Innate Stage, so he couldn\u2019t afford to take this battle lightly.However, even though Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly retaliated against the black-colored fists that rained a flurry of punches down on him, he wasn\u2019t able to defend himself against a single punch and was reduced to being a human sandbag once again.Boom, boom\u2026The familiar sounds rang out again. The people in the spectator seats couldn\u2019t sit still.\u201cHe\u2019s appeared! Sandbag Xu!\u201d3\u201cHe must be sick in the head. He insists on having a brawl every time, but when it\u2019s time to fight, he takes his opponent\u2019s punches to the face.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like that Xu Xiaoshou really knows any fist techniques. Liu Zhen is more powerful than him!\u201dXu Xiaoshou secretly thought that things weren\u2019t looking good. Liu Zhen had dropped all of his pretenses at this time. As he repeatedly got punched, he felt that his body wouldn\u2019t be able to hold out much longer.\u201cWhat kind of fist technique is this?\u201d he thought.\u201cIt\u2019s capable of causing an Innate-stage physical body this much pain?\u201dXu Xiaoshou could only guard his vital areas as he was blasted back by Liu Zhen one step at a time.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +2.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +2.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +2.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought.\u201cI\u2019m only getting two Passive Points for every punch I take? That doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d7Xu Xiaoshou became more startled the more he was hit. The notification panel never made mistakes. Not only was Liu Zhen\u2019s fist technique never-ending, but his every punch inflicted double the damage.He closely examined his body, and sure enough, he found that each of Liu Zhen\u2019s punches had secretly left a trace of black energy in his body.What a sneaky fist technique!He didn\u2019t know what the energy could do. However, it must have some hidden effect if Liu Zhen was secretly leaving it in his body.Xu Xiaoshou became anxious when he saw that he was about to be blasted out of the arena.He\u2019d been careless this time!He should have immediately pulled out his sword. Then he might\u2019ve had a fighting chance. Now that he was being bombarded with punches, he couldn\u2019t even take out his sword from within his ring.\u201cLiu Zhen, give me a chance!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said sincerely.However, Liu Zhen didn\u2019t say anything, instead punching Xu Xiaoshou more fiercely. He knew that Xu Xiaoshou had many sneaky techniques up his sleeves, as he\u2019d watched Xu Xiaoshou become the champion of the group-stage competition, so how could he give Xu Xiaoshou a chance?\u201cDon\u2019t force me!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said fiercely.There were just a few steps left before he\u2019d be forced off the arena!Liu Zhen disregarded his words. His punches ripped through the air, causing the air to crackle.Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t take it any longer. He effortfully extended his hand amidst the flurry of punches, then gathered his spiritual power and stabbed his hand forward.\u201cSharpness!\u201d he thought.\u201cI\u2019ll stab you to death!\u201cEven though I can\u2019t hit you while you\u2019re hitting me, you\u2019ll definitely bleed if you keep punching me.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dSure enough, Liu Zhen let out a startled shock the next second and put some distance between them.It was inevitable that at least one punch out of the flurry Liu Zhen rained down on Xu Xiaoshou would land on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s dagger-like fingers. Liu Zhen wasn\u2019t on the defensive and was caught off guard. His fist felt like it were about to explode it was so painful.Fortunately, he had trained his body in the past. Even though his body wasn\u2019t at the Innate Stage, it was still much stronger than that of an average person. If it wasn\u2019t, his fingers would\u2019ve been torn off from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s attack.\u201cHow could this happen?\u201dLiu Zhen\u2019s eyes were filled with shock. He knew that Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know any fist techniques, so how had he taken out a dagger and injured him under his flurry of punches?The next second, he saw that Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s twisted right finger was covered in blood.His Great Darkness Calamity Fist inflicted double damage with dark energy. There was no way that Xu Xiaoshou was bleeding from one of his attacks, which meant that the blood on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s finger was his.\u201cSo that lad countered my Great Darkness Calamity Fist with his finger?\u201d he thought to himself.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\u201cWhat technique was that?\u201d Liu Zhen asked. His desire to know what had countered his attack won out over his will to revenge.Xu Xiaoshou had been blasted to the edge of the arena by Liu Zhen\u2019s punches and had almost broken his finger. Fortunately, he\u2019d managed to avoid the crisis.He forcefully twisted his finger back to its original position and hissed, \u201cSharpness.\u201d\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cWhy did you ask if you weren\u2019t going to believe me anyway?\u201d\u201cYou might as well not have asked at all!\u201dMany of the people in the spectator seats stood up. All of them were in disbelief\u2026\u201cHow did he get out of that tricky situation? I don\u2019t get it. Why did Liu Zhen suddenly stop?\u201d\u201cLook at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand. It\u2019s bleeding. Is that Liu Zhen\u2019s blood?\u201d\u201cAre you joking? Can\u2019t you see Liu Zhen\u2019s spiritual technique? That\u2019s the Innate-stage Great Darkness Calamity Fist! How could it have been countered by Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s finger?\u201d\u201cWhat? An Innate-stage spiritual technique?\u201dSomeone had managed to identify Liu Zhen\u2019s spiritual technique. Everyone was immediately stunned.An Innate-stage spiritual technique was something that an individual had to be lucky enough to come across. How could an outer yard disciple have had the opportunity to obtain an Innate-stage spiritual technique?Even if he had obtained it, how had Liu Zhen managed to master it?Xu Xiaoshou had deduced that Liu Zhen\u2019s fist technique was a high-level technique. It couldn\u2019t have inflicted that much damage on him otherwise.Liu Zhen\u2019s series of punches had hurt him several times more than all of the attacks he\u2019d gotten hit with during the group-stage competition.That wasn\u2019t even counting the black-colored energy in his body.Xu Xiaoshou was a little flustered. He couldn\u2019t expel the energy from his body. He guessed that the energy would trip him up at the critical moment. Fortunately for him, he had his notification panel. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have known how he\u2019d gotten defeated.He quickly changed his style when he saw Liu Zhen charge over again. He moved as he took out his wooden sword and said, \u201cA gentleman fights with words, not his fists. Let\u2019s not use our fists anymore. Why don\u2019t we spar with wooden swords?5\u201cWe\u2019ll just lightly spar. Don\u2019t be rash.\u201dHis body wouldn\u2019t be able to take it if he had to earn Passive Points from being beaten by Liu Zhen\u2019s fists. Xu Xiaoshou decided to admit that he was weaker.The judge was shocked. What happened to what you said last time during the previous battle? Did you eat your words?The spectators roared with laughter. All of them slapped their thighs.\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. That Xu Xiaoshou is too funny!\u201d\u201cDid he forget that he said that a gentleman uses his fists rather than swords during his last battle? So why did he admit that he\u2019s weaker now when they really got into it with their fists?\u201d\u201cHahaha, Xu Xiaoshou is so naive! I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201dWith a thud, a rush of spiritual power erupted from the ground and blasted Liu Zhen forward. A flurry of fists immediately rained down upon Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cF***, you\u2019re still coming!\u201d3Xu Xiaoshou immediately tucked away his wooden sword and whipped out Hiding Pain. He could no longer hide it. He would definitely be blasted off the arena if Liu Zhen used his technique on him again!\u201cFortunately, I have a trump card.\u201d\u201cFleeting White Cloud!\u201dHe sliced his sword horizontally through the air, and all of the dust in the surroundings was sent flying into the air from the powerful momentum. Even the people in the spectator seats couldn\u2019t help but kneel. They looked on without blinking.\u201cDark Calamity, activate!\u201d2Liu Zhen knew without thinking that Xu Xiaoshou was going to use his ace in the hole, so he made a forceful hand gesture while in the air and ignited the thousands of strokes of dark energy he had left within Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body with his punches just now.Boom!Xu Xiaoshou spat out a mouthful of blood. His eyeballs nearly fell out of their sockets, and all the veins all over his body popped out. One could only imagine how much pain Xu Xiaoshou was in.He knew that his opponent also had a trump card. However, he didn\u2019t expect that trump card to be this powerful!Xu Xiaoshou clenched his teeth hard. He was pouting like a toad and was just short of vomiting blood.Everyone in the spectator seats were shocked. They didn\u2019t expect events to take such a drastic turn for the worse. This battle was incredibly brutal. This was too cruel!\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026 Hang in there!\u201dAll of them cheered for Xu Xiaoshou from the bottom of their hearts. After all, even though Xu Xiaoshou was unconventional and made people hate him, he was the one being beaten to a pulp in this battle.A Level Six being beaten up by a Level Ten would draw pity from anyone!The judge arched his feet and immediately charged over. He couldn\u2019t allow Xu Xiaoshou to be hit by Liu Zhen\u2019s next punch. He would die.He knew just how powerful the Great Darkness Calamity Fist was. The dark energy inflicted by the technique became more terrifying as more and more punches rained down on the opponent. Xu Xiaoshou had taken the brunt of a few thousand punches. The dark energy in his body was enough to cause an Innate-stage expert to explode!Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou had an Innate-stage physical body. The judge rejoiced.Just as he was about to get close to Xu Xiaoshou, who was forcefully trying to hold back from vomiting blood, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly secretly give him a hand signal.He doesn\u2019t need me?The judge\u2019s heart thumped wildly. Logic told him that he should stop the battle. However, for some reason, he chose to believe in Xu Xiaoshou at this moment, and stopped in his tracks.1Everyone had their hearts in their mouths. Liu Zhen\u2019s fist shot upward, straight toward Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s chin.\u201cPuu!\u201dAt the critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou spat out a large mouthful of blood he\u2019d saved in his mouth and instantly covered Liu Zhen\u2019s face with it, blurring his vision.2But what could that accomplish?Everyone in the spectator seats could see the situation clearly. Xu Xiaoshou could no longer avoid the attack. The dark energy had robbed him of the ability to move.\u201cGet out!\u201d Liu Zhen roared furiously.With a thud, his punch landed on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s forehead and sent him flying.1The next second, he felt himself being taken up into the air. What was going on?He rubbed off the blood that was obstructing his vision and realized that Xu Xiaoshou had grabbed onto him with his legs and was bringing him up into the air along with him.There was blood on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s forehead. However, his legs were wrapped tightly around Liu Zhen\u2019s waist like a pincer. They were flying out of the arena together!The sight of the two candidates entangled in the air was rather strange. It felt like time had stopped.He was taking Liu Zhen down with him?Everyone in the spectator seats was shocked. However, they saw Xu Xiaoshou how had actively stepped forward toward Liu Zhen while his forehead was being punched and then took advantage of Liu Zhen being blinded to grab onto him with his legs.He\u2019d first used his blood to blur Liu Zhen\u2019s vision and had then grabbed onto Liu Zhen by wrapping his legs around his waist. Was this a tactic that he had come up with on the fly while he was being punched?Unbelievable!\u201cRelease me!\u201dThe two of them fell straight down. Liu Zhen wanted to punch him again. If he didn\u2019t take action now, he would fall from three meters up in the air. His head was facing the ground. He would definitely be knocked out if he fell!He didn\u2019t have Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body.Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. He maneuvered around Liu Zhen\u2019s body and spun their bodies around, not allowing Liu Zhen to punch him.4During their high-speed revolution, Xu Xiaoshou propped his head against Liu Zhen\u2019s feet and grabbed his ankles. He then released his legs from around Liu Zhen\u2019s waist and made use of the momentum to gain higher ground and threw him fiercely onto the ground.1Boom!Dust flew everywhere. Liu Zhen was the first to hit the ground. He was devastated by the impact.Boom!Dust was sent flying everywhere again, and Xu Xiaoshou fell elegantly on top of Liu Zhen, who was lying on the ground.He spat out a mouthful of blood, then waved to the shocked and speechless spectators as he whispered:\u201cLiu Zhen, you sure are impressive!\u201cLiu Zhen, what fist technique was that?\u201d\u201cLiu Zhen, you\u2019ve taught me never to be careless. I\u2019ll always remember that!\u201dAll of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sarcastic remarks finally made Liu Zhen come back to his senses. He gave up on his 'silence is golden\u201d principle and said, unhappy that he\u2019d been beaten:\u201cGet off of me, darn it!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Clap, clap, clap!Thunderous applause came from the spectator seats. Without a doubt, this battle had been extremely exciting and full of twists and turns!2They\u2019d thought that Xu Xiaoshou wouldn\u2019t be able to last against the continuous barrage of punches from Liu Zhen\u2019s Great Darkness Calamity Fist. They didn\u2019t expect him to counter that technique with just one finger and turn the tide of the battle.They\u2019d thought that Xu Xiaoshou wouldn\u2019t be able to turn the situation around after being severely injured by Great Darkness Calamity Fist. However, he\u2019d unexpectedly taken advantage of his injury to seize the initiative and blur Liu Zhen\u2019s vision with his blood.3More importantly, the two of them had circled in the air at high speeds. Not only had Xui Xiaoshou\u2019s spin made Liu Zhen doubt for his life, but the technique he used in the end had allowed him to maneuver around Liu Zhen and slam him into the ground, showing the full extent of his powerful brawling skills.Xu Xiaoshou, who had initiated this insane battle, had stated that he would\u2019ve been done in if he didn\u2019t have Strengthen.The dark energy of the Great Darkness Calamity Fist was terrifying. Even though he had managed to turn defeat into victory, he had now lost all ability to battle.The judge ran over. \u201cDo you need to rest?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou nodded.The judge took a deep breath, then pointed at Liu Zhen, who was being crushed under Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s weight. \u201cHe needs to rest too.\u201dLiu Zhen had already fainted. He didn\u2019t know if Liu Zhen had fainted because of his fall or because of his anger.1Xu Xiaoshou awkwardly stood up, finally releasing the candidate Liu Zhen. Attendants immediately rushed forward to carry Liu Zhen away.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to go into the barrier to recover?\u201d the judge asked.Xu Xiaoshou stole a glance at the applauding crowd. \u201cWhat a joke,\u201d he thought. \u201cHow could I possibly go into the barrier?\u201dHe shook his head and turned his attention inward.\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +242.\u201d\u201cGot praised. Passive Points +366.\u201dHis notification panel constantly updated. Within half an hour, his Passive Points had surpassed what he\u2019d earned during his past two battles.Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but glance at the lower section of the interface.\u201cPassive Points: 7225.\u201dTsk tsk!Not counting the few points that Di Xin\u2019er had given him, just Liu Zhen alone had given him more than 2000 Passive Points.He had earned the rest of the points from the insane crowd during the time between his battles.This number was still constantly rising.Xu Xiaoshou no longer paid attention to his Passive Points. Instead, he started examining his body.He had been severely injured from the explosion of dark energy. It could be said that he did what he did after the explosion using sheer willpower alone.The tension left his body, and with it the ability to move. It felt painful to even lift his fingers.However, there was still another round left in the preliminaries!Xu Xiaoshou clenched his teeth and sat down on the Chuyun Platform with his back facing the crowd.1He took out a pill bottle. Inside was the tenth-grade recovery spiritual pill that Elder Qiao had given him after the group-stage battle\u2014the Red Gold Pill.\u201cI\u2019ll go all out!\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou seemed as though he were prepared to die. He picked up a Red Gold Pill but didn\u2019t dare to take a big whiff of it. Instead, he took a gentle whiff.In that instant, he felt as though he\u2019d been struck by lightning. His eyes rolled back into his head and he started to tremble violently.4\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201dEveryone in the spectator seats was watching Xu Xiaoshou. At that moment, they saw Xu Xiaoshou suddenly tremble, his back facing them. All of them craned their necks, incredibly curious.\u201cWha\u2019s he doing?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s taking pills? What kind of pill is that? Why are its effects so strong?\u201d\u201cThat must be a poisonous pill. It\u2019s so terrifying!\u201dEveryone saw Xu Xiaoshou, who was seated, suddenly fall backward. His body formed a star-like shape on the Chuyun Platform. He looked like a twitching pile of mud.\u201cWhat did he eat? Why is he shivering like that?\u201d\u201cThat guy must be the trembling type\u2026\u201d5Everyone instantly became confused. Xu Xiaoshou harvested another large wave of doubt while he was unconscious.Even the judge was scared silly. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he thought. \u201cWe just sent Liu Zhen away, and now you\u2019ve collapsed too?\u201cHow old are you? Why do you have to make a judge like me worry so much for you!\u201dHe quickly ran over with the medical team. They felt for Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s pulse while applying pressure on his philtrum.\u201cUhhh\u2026 I\u2019m, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou foamed at the mouth.2\u201cDo you look like you\u2019re fine?\u201d the judge nearly cursed.1\u201cYou have to tell me if you can\u2019t hold on, and I\u2019ll take you to heal your wounds!\u201d The judge tried to press on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s chest to stop him from trembling.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes rolled back as he struggled to sit up. However, he had no strength left in his body. He howled weakly.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t touch me!\u201d\u201cCurrently, I have a\u2026 sensitive constitution. Uhhh\u2026\u201dThe judge was speechless.He silently withdrew his hands from Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cPerhaps he doesn\u2019t need me\u2026\u201d he thought.The spectators were all wondering what was going on. Because Xu Xiaoshou was lying down on the ground, they could see his face, and a few of the spectators who could read lips interpreted the conversation.The spectators were in an uproar.\u201cHe must have taken an aphrodisiac!\u201d3\u201cTaking those things before a competition\u2026 I have to hand it to him!\u201d\u201cSomeone drag him off somewhere and cool him off!\u201d\u201cI strongly request for a drug test. That Xu Xiaoshou must have consumed a banned drug!\u201d2All of these interpretations of the situation gave Xu Xiaoshou countless Passive Points. There was doubt, respect, mockery\u2026The medical personnel who\u2019d taken Xu XiaoShou\u2019s pulse released his hand from around his wrist and said in shock, \u201cHe seems to be fine?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The judge was confused.\u201cI don\u2019t know what medication he took, but its effects are really powerful. His body is recovering at a rapid rate. He\u2019s almost fully healed.\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s almost fully healed?\u201dThe judge pointed at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s convulsing body. \u201cThen what\u2019s that?\u201d2The medical personnel stammered and said, not too sure himself, \u201cPleasure?\u201d10The judge\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cPleasure, my foot!\u201d he thought.2\u201cYou\u2019re useless!\u201dHe thought for a moment, then pried open Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand and saw the Red Gold Pill.\u201cJust this?\u201dHe raised an eyebrow, then took the pill and popped it into his mouth. The medical personnel almost jumped when he saw him do this. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat that!\u201d3\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It isn\u2019t poisonous. If it was, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn\u2019t have dared to consume one, and he wouldn\u2019t be experiencing the effect you described. By taking it, I\u2019ll immediately be able to detect if he consumed banned drugs before the competition or not.\u201dThe judge sat down cross-legged. He circulated the spiritual source in his body, and the pill immediately dissolved into his system.He opened his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought.\u201cIs this really a Red Gold Pill?\u201d1He looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who couldn\u2019t stop trembling, and lapsed into deep thought. \u201cDid we eat the same thing?\u201d he thought.\u201cOr could it be that he really does have a sensitive constitution?\u201dThe judge trembled when he thought about that. The medical personnel was startled.On the ground off to the side, Xu Xiaoshou continued trembling for a while before gradually regaining composure. Because of his experience with the Spiritual Cultivation Pill the previous time, he was actually much better off this time around.1Furthermore, the Red Gold Pill was ultimately a medicine used to treat injuries. The high only came in one wave. It came on fast, but it quickly went away.2He had to admit that while the side effects of the Breathing Technique were great, the effects of the technique were even greater!\u201cI seem to have mostly recovered. I still feel a little pain\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.The explosion of the dark energy left by the Great Darkness Calamity Fist was no laughing matter. His scalp still crawled when he thought about it. He didn\u2019t how he\u2019d been so brave enough to hang on during that battle.1\u201cYes, there was nothing I could do besides try my best to hang on during that battle I think\u2026\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou flailed his arms and legs, forcefully trying to reenergize himself. He still had one more battle. He couldn\u2019t cool down.The judge watched Xu Xiaoshou jump about and occasionally twitch. There was a doubtful look on his face.1\u201cSo that\u2019s the end of the matter?\u201d he thought to himself.Xu Xiaoshou leapt about and looked back, then waved his hands and thanked the spectators that loved him. He expressed his gratitude for their concern before returning to the notification panel in his mind.1\u201cPassive Points: 10220.\u201dTsk tsk, it increased by over 3000 points!\u201cThis is true love!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed as he walked into the barrier once again with trembling legs.He had reached his quota for today. He might\u2019ve even exceeded it.The judge followed behind him like his personal bodyguard. \u201cAre you ready for your next battle?\u201d he asked nonchalantly.\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. Let me rest for a while more. Give me some time, all right!\u201dXu Xiaoshou took out a Spirit Crystal and whiffed it from time to time, trying his best to stay at peak condition.4Even though he had just gone through a rough battle and recovered from a severe injury, he could still use 60 to 70 percent of his powers, which was decent.\u201cAll right!\u201d the judge chuckled. \u201cThen let\u2019s start. There\u2019s no time left anyway.\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked at the judge in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re a dog! Why did you even ask me if I wanted to start if we\u2019re out of time? Do you have to toy with people like that?\u201d1The judge happily infused an array token with his spiritual source and activated the screen, a victorious smirk on his face at having achieved a small victory against Xu Xiaoshou.1The screen shimmered, and a name was selected.\u201cWen Chong!\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked at the judge, dumbfounded. \u201cWen Chong?\u201d he thought. \u201cYou must be messing with me!\u201dThe judge put his hands up as if to say that he had nothing to do with the matter, an innocent look on his face.At the same time, the spectators immediately got into an uproar. The atmosphere had immediately become fired up by that name.\u201cMy God, Wen Chong?!\u201d\u201cThis must\u2019ve been rigged. That Xu Xiaoshou is so pitiful. Someone must\u2019ve pulled this on him!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s just gone through a battle of life and death, but in the end, he won\u2019t even have the chance to rest before he has to face a boss who\u2019s supposed to be the champion of an arena.\u201d\u201cChampion of an arena?\u201d Some people were excited, while others didn\u2019t understand why everyone had suddenly gotten into an uproar. \u201cTell me quickly. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDo you know arena number two? Boss Wen was unlucky and was grouped with Zhao Qingteng during the group-stage competition. He got dominated. Zhao Qingteng became champion while he got second place.\u201d\u201cTsk, so what? Xu Xiaoshou is also a champion!\u201d\u201cZhao Qingteng is ranked second, an Innate-stage expert!\u201d\u201cBoss Wen is ranked second and is half a step into the Innate Stage!\u201d\u201cSss! He\u2019s that strong?\u201d\u201cHehe, do you think that\u2019s all there is to it? No, no, no\u2026 That guy is the mortal enemy of Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dThe person speaking was beating around the bush and whetting the appetite of the people around him.\u201cStop beating around the bush. Tell us quickly!\u201d the people off to the side said, impatient.\u201cDo you know Liu Zhen? The Level Ten who nearly made Xu Xiaoshou explode?!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Everyone nodded.\u201cHe\u2019s Wen Chong\u2019s lackey!\u201d\u201cSsss!\u201d The crowd gasped.\u201cThat\u2019s not all!\u201d The speaker had a proud expression as he continued, \u201cYou know Di Xin\u2019er, right? The girl who got hit on the head twice by Xu Xiaoshou with his wooden sword!\u201d1\u201cYes, yes!\u201dHe revealed the shocking news. \u201cWen Chong\u2019s goddess!\u201d4\u201cOh s***!\u201d\u201cIntense!\u201d\u201cThen Xu Xiaoshou is done for, darn it!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Thud! Thud!There was the sound of heavy footsteps as a young man approached the arena.He had a slender, well-proportioned body, and had thick brows and thin lips. He looked cunning and sinister.He was the person ranked seventh on the Windcloud Scoreboard. The people of the outer yard called him Boss Wen. It was Wen Chong!Xu Xiaoshou felt a powerful aura press against his fist. He knew that Wen Chong had a technique that required charging up. He might not be able to last one move against him if he allowed him to charge up his technique.He took a whiff of the Spirit Crystal in his hand and chuckled slightly. \u201cHello, Junior!\u201dWen Chong staggered he was so furious, and the pressure from his aura dissipated without Xu Xiaoshou having to do anything.Even though his aura was powerful and extraordinary, he was still a junior who had entered the outer yard one year later than Xu Xiaoshou.The crowd had been worried about how Xu Xiaoshou would be able to hold his own against Wen Chong\u2019s powerful aura. They didn\u2019t expect the lad to have an arsenal of devious techniques, each of them marvelously effective.\u201cI\u2019m going to die laughing. I have to hand it to Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d2\u201cMy God, he dares to speak like this in front of Boss Wen. My legs would\u2019ve given out from under me if I were in that situation.\u201d\u201cHaha, how do you think he\u2019s managed to survive until now? Xu Xiaoshou is also rather powerful.\u201dIn the arena, Wen Chong stared at Xu Xiaoshou with hawk-like eyes. \u201cXu Xiaoshou, you\u2019re quite impressive. You dared to touch my person. You must be mentally prepared to die.\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou knew who he was talking about. It was Liu Zhen. Everyone knew that!He was secretly lamenting the situation. Why was he so unlucky? He just defeated the lackey, and now the boss had come without giving him time to recover first!2He couldn\u2019t help himself from turning around and shooting daggers at the judge.Angry, the judge waved his hand and said furiously, \u201cBattle, start!\u201dXu Xiaoshou immediately put distance between them. Wen Chong\u2019s most powerful technique wasn\u2019t his aura. Instead, it was a spiritual technique by the name of \u201cShadow-Splitting Spiritual Technique.\u201d2The technique could conjure up to seven clones at once. This coupled with Wen Chong\u2019s dagger techniques meant that Xu Xiaoshou wouldn\u2019t be able to escape if he was caught in one of his attacks.2Even though the Shadow-Splitting Spiritual Technique was an Acquired-stage technique, its practicality could rival Innate-stage techniques.A cold smile appeared on Wen Chong\u2019s face when he saw Xu Xiaoshou retreat. That was exactly what he wanted him to do.The longer he charged up the Shadow-Splitting Spiritual Technique, the more clones he could conjure at one time. Since Xu Xiaoshou wanted to put more distance between them, he could use this opportunity to stall for time.1Wen Chong laughed coldly after he made a forceful hand gesture. Xu Xiaoshou would definitely die when he summoned his seven clones!The candidates in the arena had still been rather noisy before the battle started. However, now they were deathly silent. It was a different story for the spectators in the spectator seats. They\u2019d never stopped being noisy.\u201cHas Xu Xiaoshou gone insane? Doesn\u2019t he know that Boss Wen\u2019s Shadow-Splitting Spiritual Technique can also be charged? Is he putting distance between them to stall his death?\u201d\u201cI heard that he only knows the White Cloud Sword Technique. Maybe he really doesn\u2019t know about Boss Wen\u2019s technique?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. That lad will be torn into shreds after Boss Wen and his seven clones charge forward at the same time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s not the only one with a ninth-grade spiritual weapon. Other people have one too! Like Boss Wen\u2019s pair of purple daggers. Tsk, tsk. Those are terrifying!\u201d\u201cLook, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s still holding the wooden sword. F***, he, he closed his eyes?\u201dLiu Zhen had woken up after being cared for by the medical personnel. The moment he arrived at his spectator seats, he saw that the battle between the two candidates was about to break out.His pupils dilated, not because of Wen Chong\u2019s Shadow-Splitting Spiritual Technique, but because he saw the familiar sight of Xu Xiaoshou closing his eyes.\u201cThat is\u2026 the sword technique that he didn\u2019t manage to use at the final moments of the last battle?\u201d he thought to himself.\u201cBoth parties are going to reveal their trump cards at the start of the battle? Do they really need to be this restless?\u201dXu Xiaoshou intended to do just that. His body was no longer capable of engaging in a drawn-out battle. Since both the Shadow-Splitting Spiritual Technique and the Fleeting White Cloud needed to be charged, then he was going to decide the battle with one attack!However, to not injure his opponent, Xu Xiaoshou was using the wooden sword!8He was a caring candidate, always thinking about his opponent.2He had tested the wooden sword out yesterday. It had decent offensive capabilities. At the least, it could slice through the bark of a tree.In reality, the strength of Fleeting White Cloud didn\u2019t lie within the weapon but in the Sword Will!On the other side, many illusory figures appeared around Wen Chong. No one dared to breathe. They knew that the battle would be decided in an instant.The judge crouched down. Truth be told, people in this line of work feared these kinds of head-on battles the most.But he wouldn\u2019t be able to determine a winner if he didn\u2019t allow the candidates to duke it out. However, someone might die if he allowed them to cross swords.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dThe judge looked at Xu Xiaoshou and became immensely flustered when he saw his wooden sword, closed eyes, and his gradually fading aura.\u201cTry a little harder!\u201d he thought.\u201cDon\u2019t you have a ninth-grade spiritual sword? Take it out and use it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be able to save you if you last against Wen Chong\u2019s first charged attack!\u201d\u201cBuzz!\u201dThe crisp hum of a sword rang. Everyone grew tense as they looked at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword.Hm, a wooden sword?Were they hearing things?Could it be Wen Chong\u2019s dagger that was trembling?Everyone looked back in unison and saw the glimmer in Wen Chong\u2019s eyes as he charged forward, his body turning into a blur as he shifted and changed position, weaving between his clones to slice his dagger at Xu Xiaoshou.He closed the distance\u2026Half the arena!One meter!Xu Xiaoshou\u2026 still had his eyes closed!Everyone was cursing internally. He was about to die, yet he still hadn\u2019t opened his eyes. His eyes might stay shut forever if he didn\u2019t do something!The judge instantly darted forward. Xu Xiaoshou must\u2019ve gone mad. He was heavily injured and must have given up on the competition!However, just as the two candidates were within inches of each other, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly opened his eyes. No one knew when he had moved the sword in his right hand!This attack was extremely slow, like a fleeting white cloud, and instantly calmed down the restless spectators.\u201cBuzz!\u201dAnother hum of a sword was heard. This time, everyone saw what happened. It was Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s wooden sword that was dancing with joy, not Wen Chong\u2019s dagger.\u201cA wooden sword?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201dEveryone in the spectator seats was waiting for a reaction. However, they didn\u2019t expect themselves to be hit by the attack.\u201cClang\u2026\u201dThis sound caused everyone\u2019s sword to tremble, as if the swords had been drawn by the Sword Will and connected as one.This scene was incredibly familiar. All of the swordsman at the scene involuntarily thought back to the unknown hum of a sword that had spread throughout the outer yard two days ago.Could that have been caused by Xu Xiaoshou?\u201cThis\u2026 How is this possible?\u201d\u201cAm I seeing things?\u201dIn the air, Xiao Qixiu\u2019s eyes widened, and he grabbed onto his sword in shock.Acquired-stage Sword Will?!Was that really from Xu Xiaoshou?!In the arena, after the buzzing sounded, Wen Chong immediately changed his plan of attack. He retreated while he was right under Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s nose, then immediately got his seven clones to guard his front.Clang, clang, clang\u2026The sword glow collided with the purple daggers, and the sound of metal against metal endlessly rang out.Wen Chong was immensely shocked. That lad\u2019s strike had created several hundred sword glows. It was a net of blades that looked extremely slow, but it blocked his opponent\u2019s path of attack and forced him to retreat time after time.\u201cHow could it be?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t that lad train his body? How could he have such a terrifying sword technique?\u201dCreak, creak, creak!Wen Chong\u2019s clones got diced one after the other, and thin sword marks had appeared on Wen Chong\u2019s body. Fresh blood oozed out of his wounds!Outside the arena, Liu Zhen was shocked. This sword technique\u2026He remembered that Xu Xiaoshou had been holding Hiding Pain during their battle. If he hadn\u2019t activated the dark energy explosion to interrupt Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s attack, he would\u2019ve turned into mincemeat.Sure enough, this lad was hiding his true strength, just like he\u2019d expected!In the arena, Wen Chong was forced back to his original position by the sword glows, and was close to being pushed out of the arena.He put away his dagger and brought his arms in front of his chest. A barrier of spiritual energy shot out from within his body and instantly repelled all of the sword glows.\u201cSpirit Surge Barrier!\u201dThe spiritual energy scattered, and Wen Chong\u2019s pupils dilated.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s fringe was swept upward with his forward momentum, and his wooden sword landed on Wen Chong\u2019s throat.\u201cYou lose.\u201dGulp!Wen Chong involuntarily swallowed. As his Adam\u2019s Apple bobbed, a bit of blood oozed from the wound left behind by the sword energy of the wooden sword.His face was covered in blood, but they were all superficial wounds. He was still in peak condition. But he had lost.One sword. One sentence.The person ranked seventh on the Windcloud Scoreboard had been defeated!The wind swept past the arena. It was silent in the spectator seats. The judge turned his head around in a daze.Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his sword and turned around. He had to head back and recover. That sword technique had exhausted all of his spiritual power.His legs were trembling\u2026\u201cTolerate it,\u201d he told himself. \u201cYou cannot fall. So many people are watching. You have to finish the act!\u201d3Wen Chong\u2019s eyes were filled with indignance. Aside from the time they\u2019d spent charging up their attacks, the battle only lasted a few seconds, yet he was defeated?6The person ranked seventh on the Windcloud Scoreboard, Boss Wen of the outer yard, had been defeated!He didn\u2019t look back. Even though he was in the barrier, he still felt like he could hear the crowd\u2019s unfeeling laughter.Even Liu Zhen was able to beat up Xu Xiaoshou in his battle, yet Boss Wen had been defeated in one move!This Xu Xiaoshou had dared to tease Di Xin\u2019er with a wooden sword, yet Boss Wen hadn\u2019t been able to do anything about it when he entered the field.A fierce expression passed over Wen Chong\u2019s face!The purple dagger that he\u2019d tucked within his sleeves radiated a mysterious aura, and Wen Chong\u2019s turned into a blur once again as he charged toward Xu Xiaoshou!3\u201cCareful!\u201d\u201cStop it, Wen Chong!\u201d\u201cThe battle has ended! It\u2019s ended!\u201d the judge roared as he pounced forward. He didn\u2019t expect such an outcome to occur just because he\u2019d been late in announcing the end of the match.Anyone could see that Xu Xiaoshou had won. To think that Wen Chong would take action and launch a surprise attack!He wouldn\u2019t be able to stop Wen Chong\u2019s attack in time!\u201cGot ambushed. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was greedy for Passive Points and was thus always paying some attention to the notification panel. When he saw this notification, he abruptly turned around to retaliate.Creak!Wen Chong\u2019s ninth-grade spiritual dagger fiercely pierced Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shoulder, and blood sprayed everywhere.Creak!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s right hand pierced through Wen Chong\u2019s chest straight to his heart!20Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Xu Xiaoshou froze in shock!1The judge also froze in shock!All of the rowdy, shouting spectators also froze in shock!Even Xiao Qixiu, who was standing in the air, was a little stunned. He had shifted his attention to the other arenas when the battle ended, not expecting to see such a serious turn of events when he turned around again.He remembered the words that he\u2019d said before the competition started: \u201cthere are times when even the judges aren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d Had his words come true?Everyone in the arena froze!The corner of Wen Chong\u2019s lips twitched. He seemed to want to say something, but fresh blood flowed out of his mouth, and his eyes bulged. He froze and couldn\u2019t say anything for the longest time.The ferocity in his eyes had disappeared, completely replaced with disbelief.He lowered his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s arm, which had plunged straight through his chest to his heart. He was only able to see the elbow, which was dyed a stark red by his blood, as the rest was inside his chest.1\u201cHis hand?\u201d he thought.\u201cPierced through my chest?\u201cHow is that possible\u2026\u201dThe veins in the corner of Wen Chong\u2019s eyes popped out from the intense pain.1He looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a quizzical look in his eyes, as if he wanted an answer.Xu Xiaoshou could feel a squeezing sensation around his forearm. Thump thump, thump thump\u2026\u201cSave him!\u201d he roared. He didn\u2019t know whether to pull his hand out or not at the moment.8Why had it come to this?Xu Xiaoshou was flustered. He\u2019d never killed anyone before. But he also hadn\u2019t expected Wen Chong to charge forward and launch a surprise attack.He had instinctually turned around because he trusted the hint given to him by the Passive System. He didn\u2019t expect Wen Chong to run into the tip of his spear because he wanted to kill him.\u201cWhy must you do this!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou roared with fury. He took out a Red Gold Pill and stuffed it into Wen Chong\u2019s mouth. Wen Chong seemed to be shaking his head, but it was so slight that it was almost indiscernible.4His lips were slightly parted. He never once closed them.\u201cEat it!\u201dXu Xiaoshou closed Wen Chong\u2019s mouth with his left hand, trying to get Wen Chong to eat it and absorb the medicine so its effects would kick in. In the end, the pill fell out of Wen Chong\u2019s mouth and onto the ground the moment he took his hand away.Thud, thud\u2026He saw the red and gold-colored pill roll silently away and noticed that something had been lost along with the pill.The judge walked over and pulled Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand out of Wen Chong\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s useless,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201dXu Xiaoshou trembled. Dead?Was even a Spiritual Cultivator\u2019s life this fragile? They\u2019d die from just one stab?The judge couldn\u2019t help but sigh when he saw the state Xu Xiaoshou was in, and he patted his shoulder, seemingly trying to console him.\u201cThis is your first time killing someone?\u201d\u201cGet used to it!\u201d3He pulled out the dagger Wen Chong had left in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shoulder and handed him a pill bottle as compensation for the Red Gold Pill he\u2019d eaten of his earlier.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t your fault. He was wrong for initiating a surprise attack. If someone\u2019s to blame, it\u2019s me for being negligent.\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right. Go back and rest. Leave the rest to me.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was in a daze. He looked at Wen Chong, who was now in the judge\u2019s arms, and silently walked out of the arena, clutching his shoulders.5The spectators saw the melancholic, lost expression on his face, and didn\u2019t dare to cause a loud commotion at the moment.\u201cHe\u2019s really dead?\u201d\u201cI think this is the first death in the outer yard in a decade.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The judges and candidates all knew when to stop during previous competitions. I really didn\u2019t expect that this time\u2026 Boss Wen was too impulsive!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026 My God, I really feel bad for him\u2026\u201dSome people supported Xu Xiaoshou, but they made up the minority. Most of the other spectators were opposed to what he\u2019d done.\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. That Xu Xiaoshou still has such an indignant look after killing someone.\u201d\u201cBoss Wen died such an indignant death! The judge didn\u2019t call the match, so Boss Wen attacked within the parameters of the rules. How could Xu Xiaoshou dare to deal such a lethal blow?\u201d1\u201cI strongly suggest disqualifying Xu Xiaoshou from the competition. Disgusting!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. For him to deal such a lethal blow during a battle between members of the same faction. He\u2019s a beast!\u201dOff to the side, the people who supported Xu Xiaoshou immediately became infuriated and stood up. \u201cNonsense!\u201d they retorted.\u201cAnyone with eyes could see that Wen Chong lost. How would Wen Chong have been able to deal with Xu Xiaoshou if Xu Xiaoshou had been using his spiritual sword? Xu Xiaoshou had already held back!\u201d1\u201cWen Chong\u2019s sneak attack failed and he got stabbed by Xu Xiaoshou instead. Xu Xiaoshou even tried to give him medicine. Did you guys not see Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s rare show of character?\u201dThe people supporting Wen Chong laughed coldly and said, \u201cThe judge didn\u2019t announce the end of the match, so Wen Chong\u2019s attack was within the parameters of the rules. On the other hand, what Xu Xiaoshou did was completely unconscionable!\u201d\u201cUnconscionable my foot, you bootlicker. Come over here!\u201d\u201cWhy? Bite me if you dare!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cOh f***, loosen your jaw\u2026 Loosen your jaw, darn it!\u201d18\u2026Goose Lake.The clear waters reflected the sky, and plump geese played on the clouds reflected in the water.This was a place with splendid scenery in the outer yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace. The area was surrounded by hanging willows, and the lake was encircled by white railings that made a heart shape. The water of the lake was wonderfully clear and speckled with spiritual energy.1The creatures swimming around in the lake were spiritual geese that Elder Qiao reared. Their meat was plump and delicious. Xu Xiaoshou had been lucky enough to try them a few times.On an average day, many people came to Goose Lake to train. However, because of the recent Windcloud Competition, there weren\u2019t many people there, and the area was exceptionally serene.Xu Xiaoshou stood by the railings, his eyes full of despair.1Instead of returning to his yard, he\u2019d gone to the place where he usually practiced his sword techniques.This was the first time he couldn\u2019t feel excited after winning a battle. He didn\u2019t even bother to look at his Passive Points.6He had walked out of the arena and left the Chuyun Platform in a daze, wandering around before arriving at this place.The sun was setting. Xu Xiaoshou had been here for a long time.He tossed a stone into Goose Lake, and the surface of the lake rippled before becoming calm again.\u201cPerhaps this world is also the same. Life is like a stone. No matter how large it is, it doesn\u2019t create much of a ripple after it sinks into Goose Lake!\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou exhaled and touched his right forearm, as if he could once again feel Wen Chong\u2019s final heartbeats.Regret?No!Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t feel a tinge of regret even though he\u2019d accidentally killed Wen Chong. Perhaps a better way to put it was that he\u2019d been prepared for it.Killing another person would become his new normal now that he\u2019d arrived in this world.6Perhaps in the Tiansang Spirit Palace this wasn\u2019t so obvious, but Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t that naive. This was merely the beginning.The reason he was overcome with emotion and felt down was because of his compassion and thoughts about how fragile life was.13Perhaps life wasn\u2019t worth mentioning to the people on this continent. Perhaps he would hold the same view after today.However, the current Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t calm himself down for the longest time.He\u2019d been endlessly tortured in a white patient ward in his previous life. He still harbored the hope to live. It could be said that Xu Xiaoshou saw human life as much more precious than an average person in this world.4But now, he had personally destroyed one of those precious lives.1It was true that he had mentally prepared himself. But who wouldn\u2019t have been shaken at that turn in events?That precious life was Boss Wen. However, in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes, he was just a brother who had some talent and was a little arrogant.5Even though Wen Chong had launched a surprise attack, it was possible that he\u2019d had no intention of killing him.5\u201cIn the end, didn\u2019t he only pierce his dagger into my shoulder?\u201d1\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have killed him?\u201dXu Xiaoshou shook his head and tossed this ridiculous thought out of his mind.Since Wen Chon had dared to take action, he should have been prepared to face the consequences, even if those consequences were unbearable!These words were intended for the dead Wen Chong, but they were also a word of caution for his future self.1Far away, the setting sun was devoured by the mountains on the horizon, and the sky turned dark. Everything became silent again.There was a sudden ripple of spiritual energy at Goose Lake. It shocked all of the plump geese and caused the hanging willows to sway slightly.Xu Xiaoshou breathed heavily. He had unknowingly broken through to Spiritual Cultivation Level Seven.\u201cHah!\u201dHe suddenly grabbed a rock and, with murderous intentions, tossed the rock at the flock of plump geese as if he were venting his frustrations.A wave of water flew in all directions when the rock hit the lake, but it didn\u2019t hit any of the geese.Xu Xiaoshou sighed a sad sigh.Ultimately, he\u2019d still killed someone!6Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Xu Xiaoshou stood next to Goose Lake the entire night.The lake was always surrounded by insects during summer. Right now, a few of the insects that didn\u2019t know their place wanted to use their meager powers to give Xu Xiaoshou some Passive Points.However, their weak stingers could no longer pierce through Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body like before, as he\u2019d since passed into the Innate-stage.It was very cold at dawn. Xu Xiaoshou pulled his robes closer around himself. He had mostly calmed down and was going to leave the place.He turned around and saw a withered face staring at him.1Xu Xiaoshou was startled.This old man looked fine in every regard except the two scary dark circles under his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re from the outer yard?The lips of the old man twitched into a smile as he said, \u201cYoung lad, aren\u2019t you going to watch the Windcloud Competition?\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou staggered backward a few steps, putting some distance between them. He felt that the old man\u2019s voice was rather familiar.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou tried to identify the old man. Wasn\u2019t he the old man he\u2019d come across during his arduous journey on his wobbly legs to the group-stage competition?Was fate pushing them together?The old man chuckled. He placed the straw hat in his hands onto his head, and Xu Xiaoshou instantly recognized him.\u201cElder, you are\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was doubtful. He could attribute one encounter to chance, but two encounters were too much of a coincidence.Had this old man intentionally come looking for him?The old man wearing the straw hat placed his hands behind his back and said, \u201cYou\u2019re missing out. I heard that there are many talents in the recent Windcloud Competition.\u201cThere was a young lad yesterday. I think his name was Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cHe even killed someone. Tsk tsk. These young people sure are brazen!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhy did you have to go and mention that?\u201d he thought. \u201cThe killer is standing right in front of you!\u201dHowever, the old man didn\u2019t seem to recognize him. \u201cThat\u2019s all right though,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not here to find him. I\u2019m here to find you!\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou started to say, but the old man reached a hand out to stop him.\u201cI know you!\u201cOld Xiao and Old Qiao told me that another swordsman who mastered the Acquired-stage Sword Will appeared in the outer yard two days ago.\u201cBut I like you the most!\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re talking a bunch of nonsense!\u201d he thought. \u201cYou mentioned four people, two of whom are me!\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d The old man glared at him, signaling for a young man like him to not be that impatient and allow him to finish saying his piece.\u201cHey hey, you have an Innate-stage physical body. I\u2019m not wrong, am I!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you for a few days now. I looked all around the outer yard but didn\u2019t expect you to be admiring the geese here. You sure live up to the admiration I hold for you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know how to have fun!\u201dXu Xiaoshou secretly rolled his eyes. \u201cHow is that fun? I was thinking about life, not admiring the geese.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to admire about these plump geese? They make for better eating.\u201d\u201cI came here last night and watched you!\u201dThe old man\u2019s words shocked Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cLast night?\u201d he thought. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice you!\u201dHe secretly observed the old man and realized that he couldn\u2019t see his aura. It was as though a normal old man was standing in front of him.But how was that possible?An ordinary old man in the Tiansang Spirit Palace?This person was definitely a boss!He secretly pondered the situation. He didn\u2019t know why such an important person would come looking for him. Was it because of his Innate-stage physical body?Fun, body, secretly observing\u20263Xu Xiaoshou shivered. Why did he feel that something was wrong?2The old man didn\u2019t notice Xu Xiaoshou acting strangely and continued talking with his hands behind his back. \u201cI observed you for an entire night. Good lad, you have great resolve!\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t move an inch even after being bitten by insects and hearing the sinister, eerie howls in the area. You didn\u2019t even look back.\u201d1\u201cI have to admit that you\u2019re a lot like me when I was young!\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou staggered backward. He remembered that he\u2019d frequently felt a chill on his neck during the night, as if someone were breathing behind him\u2026.A person really had been breathing behind him?He suddenly felt scared. He\u2019d felt tired after thinking about life and coming to a critical realization, and he\u2019d dozed off while he was standing. How did he not notice this old man?1Now that he thought about it, his notification panel also hadn\u2019t indicated that there was anything like a surprise attack or a threat. It had failed in its job!\u201cThis can\u2019t do. I honestly have to go back to my yard to sleep in the future.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t stand around outside in the future. Otherwise, I might die without even knowing how!\u201dThe old man couldn\u2019t help but nod with satisfaction. He observed Xu Xiaoshou from head to toe, then suddenly asked, \u201cI\u2019ve talked for so long. Do you have anything you want to say?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was confused.He said with a steely-green expression, \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who stopped me from speaking?\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThink about it again. Did I?\u201dXu Xiaoshou wanted to retort but suddenly thought back to their interaction. The old man only stopped him with his gaze and his hand. He hadn\u2019t said anything.He said in frustration, \u201cI\u2019ve disappointed you, elder!\u201d\u201cThe brazen young murderer that you talked about is me. The one who mastered the Sword Will is also me. The person with the Innate-stage physical body\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s also me!\u201d\u201cAlso, my name is Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dHe paused for a moment, then continued, \u201cI have to attend the Windcloud Competition now, not as a spectator. Goodbye!\u201dEven though he didn\u2019t know why the old man had come, it was best not to offend him. It was best for him to run.\u201cWait!\u201dThe old man grabbed him. He had immense power, and his grip made Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s wrist hurt.\u201cElder, let me go! I wouldn\u2019t taste good! I didn\u2019t even take a shower last night!\u201d2The old man\u2019s eyes twitched. \u201cWhy are you talking about eating? Aren\u2019t pills delicious enough to eat? Why would I eat you?\u201d\u201cGood grief!\u201dHe once again looked Xu Xiaoshou up and down. \u201cAre you really a genius?\u201dXu Xiaoshou glanced at the notification panel and saw that he hadn\u2019t been doubted. He said with a nasal tone, \u201cYou\u2019ve already believed me, so why are you asking me that question?\u201d\u201cGood lad!\u201dThe old man cracked a smile. \u201cYou have such a confident tone. You\u2019re like me. I bet I wouldn\u2019t be wrong if I picked you to win the Windcloud Competition!\u201dHe took out a red seed-like item from his pocket and handed it over to Xu Xiaoshou, \u201cEat it!\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou almost peed his pants. What was that!\u201cThis messed-up old man must be sick in the head,\u201d he thought. \u201cHe caused such a fuss when he suddenly appeared and now he wants me to eat a seed?\u201d\u201cI swear, I, Xu Xiaoshou, will never loiter out here in the future!\u201dMust I have a wretched life! Must I lose my innocence because of a dead Wen Chong?\u201cEat it!\u201d the old man said authoritatively when he saw Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s pleading gaze. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. It might be a little painful, but with your Innate-stage physical body, it\u2019ll be over after you bear with it for a while.\u201d2\u201cI\u2019m begging you to stop talking!\u201d he thought, and almost kneeled. \u201cIt was fine when you didn\u2019t say anything about it, but now that you\u2019ve said this, even the flame of hope in my heart has gone cold!\u201d1He was forced to take the red-colored seed that was about the size of a fingernail, and found that it was unexpectedly hot in his hand.Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He had an Innate-stage physical body. Wouldn\u2019t the seed have dissolved and fallen through an ordinary person\u2019s hand?He glanced at the old man in the straw hat again and noticed that he was looking at him rather expectantly. \u201cEat it! It\u2019s delicious!\u201d2He was definitely an important person, so there was no need for him to use poison or aphrodisiacs to toy around with him\u2026Hm?Xu Xiaoshou felt bitter. Even though he was handsome, he wasn\u2019t so handsome that someone would fall head over heels for him and do anything within their means to get him.1\u201cI\u2019ll go all out!\u201d he thought.\u201cGulp!\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt as though he were consuming poison. He swallowed the seed with a look of despair, then looked to the old man. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\u201cNext?\u201d he asked.\u201cThere is no next!\u201dThe old man let out a wretched laugh, then vanished without a trace.F***!Xu Xiaoshou was about to explode with anger. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cYou give me an unknown item, ask me to eat it, and then leave after I eat it\u2026\u201cYou left!\u201cYou really left!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was manic. He swore that he would immediately use his Fleeting White Cloud if he ever saw the old man again. He would teach him what the words \u201cthere\u2019s no next\u201d really meant!2The next second, Xu Xiaoshou felt his entire face turn red, and his entire body became hot.Even his face was trembling.\u201cI\u2019m finished!\u201cMy body, my body feels strange\u2026\u201cWhat kind of strange sensation is this!?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was shocked. \u201cDid that old man leave to call someone over!?\u201d7\u201cHelp!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not worth it! Help!\u201d2Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21There was no rest time between the preliminary round and the competition between the top 64 contestants.1However, news that Xu Xiaoshou had killed someone had already spread throughout the entire Outer Yard during the night.Most of the people only paid attention to the bosses who were ranked in the top ten of the Windcloud Scoreboard. However, Wu Peng, like a dark horse, had forced people to take notice of him.The advancement competition started at noon the next day.Unlike the preliminary competition, from this point on the Chuyun Platform would no longer be split into 18 different arenas, and one arena master would engage in consecutive duels.This was what everyone was looking forward to.Many people had been frustrated that they\u2019d missed the historic moment of a person being killed in the Outer Yard because they\u2019d been looking at another battle.There was a crowd of people in the spectator seats, and it was incredibly loud.\u201cIt\u2019s here, it\u2019s here. We\u2019ve waited so long to reach this moment.\u201d\u201cSigh, who here hasn\u2019t waited? To think that I missed the first death in the Outer Yard because of the two Innate-stage fighters, Senior Mo and Senior Chao!\u201d\u201cHaha, then you really missed out. What\u2019s so great about seeing the two of them before the advancement competition? Didn\u2019t they finish off all their opponents in one move?\u201d\u201cLet me tell you. Yesterday, Xu Xiaoshou held back his finishing blow while Boss Wen launched a sneak attack at him from behind. In the end, he got stabbed in the chest\u2026 The twists and turns in their fight were so exciting!\u201d\u201cEveryone in the spectator seats was shocked. It was so silent that you could hear a fart.\u201d\u201cUrgh, stop telling me about it. Can\u2019t you see the regretful tears running down my face?\u201dBesides for the spectators who\u2019d come here just to observe the competition, there were spectators present who supported Xu Xiaoshou, as well as those who didn\u2019t like him.However, everyone had had a night to cool down and now showed much more restraint. At the very most, they would glare at each other and feel unhappy whenever Xu Xiaoshou was mentioned.Xiao Qixiu landed in the main arena. Chief Elder Xiao, who had stood in the air for a few consecutive days, finally decided to plant his feet on the ground and honestly host the competition.He didn\u2019t dare fly in the air anymore. He was afraid that his heart wouldn\u2019t be able to take it if he saw another soul rise to the heavens.He expertly took out a piece of paper from his robes, and the spectators immediately fell silent. They were all ears.\u201cI believe that everyone has heard about the death from yesterday\u2026\u201dA glimmer appeared in everyone\u2019s eyes when Xiao Qixiu said this.This matter would\u2019ve silently passed if no one had mentioned it again, so didn\u2019t Xiao Qixiu mentioning it now mean that there were some follow-up matters to deal with?Had a decision been made by the Spiritual Law Division? Was Xu Xiaoshou going to be barred from the competition?Xiao Qixiu surveyed his surroundings. This was the first time he wasn\u2019t reading from the paper. His expression was stern.\u201cHere, I want to remind all of you\u2026\u201cEven though the Tiansang Spirit Palace has provided all of you with a comfortable training environment, I don\u2019t want your wills and minds to weaken.\u201cOne day, the time will come when you will graduate and head out of the palace. However, once you leave the spirit palace, there will definitely be many life or death moments in the Shengshen Continent!\u201cEvery competition is an obstacle in the outside world. You need to give your best effort!\u201cHowever, at the same time, I hope that you maintain a good attitude. This attitude will define your life, your death, your morals. It will be your bottom line.\u201cIf you cross that bottom line, you will eventually reap what you sow.1\u201cBe it if your name is Xu Xiaoshou or Wen Chong!\u201dEveryone slipped into silence.They were all waiting for an outcome. Was Xu Xiaoshou going to be barred from the competition or be judged not guilty and allowed to continue with the contest? No one knew the answer.To these people, speculating about the results of the contests outweighed their regard for human life.However, Xiao Qixiu had been unwilling to comment on the event yesterday. Instead, he made use of this incident to teach everyone a lesson.Didn\u2019t Wen Chong die because he crossed the bottom line and reaped what he\u2019d sown?But whether or not Xu Xiaoshou had crossed the bottom line and intentionally landed the killing blow was also a question.However, there could only be one resolution to this matter.Now that Xiao Qixiu had said this, only time would tell whether Xu Xiaoshou met a good or bad end.In the arena, Chief Elder Xiao felt very comforted when he saw the crowd\u2019s reaction.To a person who had killed many a time like him, someone dying was no longer a big deal to him. He didn\u2019t have to put in that much effort and waste his words on this incident.However, it was different with these young people. If his words only jolted a few of them awake to life\u2019s realities, that was enough to him.It was meaningless for them to act on their momentary courage and hatred, as it would only cause them trouble in the future.Xiao Qixiu was overcome with emotion. In the past, he wouldn\u2019t have said much, but things were different now.After all, he was no longer the brutal killer Xiao Qixiu of the past. He was now a Chief Elder in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.\u201cGreat!\u201dXiao Qixiu shook the piece of paper in his hand and said, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, we shall now talk about the main issue at hand.\u201d\u201cThe battle between the top 64 contestants will now start. The pairings will be drawn on the screen. There will be two people in every group. The time limit of the battle is 30 minutes!\u201d\u201cFight your hearts out today. We will have as many people advance as possible. We have the time!\u201dThe crowd of spectators, who\u2019d still been in deep silence, immediately started to stir at Xiao Qixiu\u2019s words, and the atmosphere gradually livened.Chief Elder Xiao was very satisfied with the crowd\u2019s response, and he immediately waved his hand to signal for the competition to start and make the tense crowd spring into action.\u201cNow, the contest will start\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d a voice hurriedly interrupted him.Everyone was shocked and looked at the person who\u2019d spoken. He dared to interrupt the chief judge? Did he want to die?\u201cXu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cThat person must be ill!\u201d\u201cMy God, it\u2019s already great enough that Elder Xiao didn\u2019t hold him accountable, yet he still wants to provoke him?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s here, he\u2019s here, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s here! As someone who\u2019s paid attention to him since the group stages, I dare say that Xu Xiaoshou isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou if he doesn\u2019t provoke others!\u201dEighteen people dressed in black were sitting sternly in the panel of judges. The 12th judge immediately slumped over when Xu Xiaoshou arrived.\u201cHe\u2019s here. That person is the Xu Xiaoshou I was telling you guys about.\u201d\u201cLook closely. That lad is definitely going to cause trouble!\u201d1\u201cI was tormented by that lad. Come, come, come, I\u2019ll bet one Spirit Crystal. Even Boss Xiao wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his composure in front of him!\u201dA few of the black-robed people beside him started to laugh, their eyes full of shock.\u201cIs he as bad as you say?\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t he only have an Innate-stage physical body and an Acquired-stage Sword Will? I\u2019ve seen many geniuses!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. No matter how much of a genius he is, is he better than Su Qianqian from the Inner Yard?\u201dThe 12th judge shifted his chair and leaned forward. He saw Xu Xiaoshou run to Xiao Qixiu and shook his head slightly.\u201cNo, no, no, that\u2019s all secondary. What\u2019s most terrifying about that lad is how unpredictable he is!\u201d1He paused for a moment, then added, \u201cYou never know what infuriating thing he\u2019ll do next.\u201dEveryone was looking at the arena.Xiao Qixiu\u2019s expression was terrifyingly dark. However, he could do nothing but watch the brazen, anxious young man run toward him.A candidate could request the chief judge to pause the competition under special circumstances.This was within the rules of the Windcloud Competition, though no one had ever done it.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019ll finish you off if you don\u2019t have a special reason for this!\u201d Xiao Qixiu spoke at the top of his voice. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s interruption had made him a little flustered.\u201cSave me, Sir Judge!\u201dThe young man in front of him was flustered, and his face was red. Xiao Qixiu could feel the scorching heat radiating from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body when he came closer to him.Xu Xiaoshou was truly panicking!He didn\u2019t know what the detestable old man had given him. As soon as that red seed had entered his stomach, he\u2019d only felt his body get hotter and hotter. A terrifying, scorching aura had radiated out from the seed, continuously gnawing at his body.He had tried to refine the seed by meditating at Goose Lake to expel the seed from his body.However, the symptoms had only gotten worse the more he\u2019d tried, and the seed had melted!3The scorching aura had seeped into every cell of his body and was continuously burning him.Xu Xiaoshou felt as though he were about to explode.Even his Innate-stage physical body couldn\u2019t tolerate the burning. Several of the meridians in his body had broken. He would die if this continued.2He had wanted to head to the Spiritual Medical Division, but all of the best medical attendants and pharmacists had come to help out in the Windcloud Competition.Thus, he could only come here to look for them.However, how could he easily find those people? Furthermore, he didn\u2019t know if the old man had anything to do with them, so he couldn\u2019t recklessly reveal himself.Thus, Xu Xiaoshou could only use his trump card!Xiao Qixiu looked coldly at the young man. He wanted to see what kind of nonsense Xu Xiaoshou was capable of spouting.Xu Xiaoshou tore his shirt apart and revealed his red flesh.\u201cSave me, Judge!\u201d he howled hysterically.\u201cI took drugs. Please bar me from the competition!\u201d3\u201cI want medical personnel to examine my body. Immediately, right now!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22All of the spectators were stunned. In this day and age, someone was actually requesting to be barred from the competition?Xiao Qixiu\u2019s expression darkened. He had thought that it was a grave matter.Doping?What contestant didn\u2019t consume a few pills before the start of the competition to boost their abilities? There weren\u2019t even rules that prohibited a competitor from using pills to recover their spiritual strength.\u201cNonsense!\u201d\u201cHurry up and get out of the arena!\u201dXiao Qixiu was furious. He nearly drew his sword and thrust it at Xu Xiaoshou.There was a bitter expression on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face. He said, \u201cIf not for the fact that I really took too many drugs, I wouldn\u2019t have to come to look for you. I really need help!\u201dHe looked behind him. There was a bunch of angels in white robes sitting there.Xiao Qixiu frowned. This young man really was anxious. Also, his stark-red body\u2026What was going on here?He knew that Xu Xiaoshou had an Innate-stage physical body, so what kind of item was this that it was capable of making him experience such adverse side effects?\u201cGet over here!\u201d Xiao Qixiu pressed his hand onto Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s chest, and a terrifying scorching energy instantly assaulted him.Creak!He smelled the scent of flesh burning and immediately pulled his hand away. He didn\u2019t have an Innate-stage physical body.The spectators were dumbfounded.\u201cOh f***, just what kind of drugs did Xu Xiaoshou take? To think that it managed to injure Elder Xiao.\u201d\u201cThis is insane. Did he really take drugs? And he dared to come here to turn himself in?\u201d\u201cIf it was really as he said, I would think that he had no other choice. Haha, this is too funny!\u201dEven Xiao Qixiu was startled. He quickly enveloped his palm with his spiritual source to eliminate the scorching aura. However, his palm had already been burned.He had disregarded Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s symptoms and touched him without protecting himself with his spiritual source first. He ended up paying the price for that with a burned hand.\u201cThe Infernal Fire Seed?\u201d\u201cElder Sang must have gone mad,\u201d he murmured to himself. \u201cDidn\u2019t the Infernal Fire Seed once cripple a person with an Innate-stage physical body?\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou nearly peed his pants when he heard this. He fearfully looked at Xiao Qixiu, his eyes full of questions.Xiao Qixiu awkwardly stroked his hand as he realized that Xu Xiaoshou had overheard him muttering to himself. \u201cThat item is great,\u201d he quickly added. \u201cIt\u2019s your good fortune. There\u2019s nothing wrong, there\u2019s nothing wrong\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was about to explode. \u201cWhat do you mean that there\u2019s nothing wrong?\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that it once crippled a person with an Innate-stage physical body?\u201d\u201cI heard everything!\u201d he said slowly.\u201cYou heard wrong!\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d1\u201cSigh!\u201d Xiao Qixiu sighed. He patted Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cGo back and rest. Do your best. Fight through the pain!\u201d\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was gobsmacked.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the answer I was looking for! I want medical attention!\u201d he thought.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be burned and crippled!\u201dXiao Qixiu no longer cared about Xu Xiaoshou. He got him to squat in the corner and announced the start of the competition, then went at his own pace and started drawing the pairings.Everyone in the spectator seats grew interested. What was going on?Xu Xiaoshou had admitted to taking drugs and requested to be barred from the competition, yet the judge had disregarded his claims and wasn\u2019t even going to give Xu Xiaoshou medical attention?\u201cHahaha, this is too funny. What happened here today is a lesson that the evils we bring on ourselves are the hardest to bear!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou is so pitiful. He took drugs and ended up in this state. Bravo!\u201d\u201cPlease give him some medical attention. He\u2019s about to turn into braised meat\u2026 Haha, I can\u2019t hold it in any longer!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s upper body was bare, and he was becoming terrifyingly redder and redder, and there was steam rising from his body.He dejectedly returned to his waiting area.\u201cHow could he be so merciless? He didn\u2019t even get a medical worker to look at me\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou secretly mulled over the situation. He had gained something by coming here. At the very least, he had obtained some critical pieces of information.The Infernal Fire Seed had once crippled a person with an Innate-stage physical body!Also\u2026Elder Sang?He seemed to have heard that name before\u2026Judging from the information that Xiao Qixiu had accidentally revealed, Xiao Qixiu knew about the item he had consumed\u2026 the Infernal Fire Seed?Also, Xiao Qixiu might know the detestable old man.This was the reason why Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t continue with his antics.\u201cThey are partners in crime\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou sat down cross-legged and continued expelling the scorching aura from his body a little at a time. This was all he could do for the time being.However, this terrifying scorching energy gradually seeped into his energy reserve as he refined it.\u201cWon\u2019t it eventually burn my energy reserve?\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt indignant. He had unknowingly got done in by the detestable old man.He suddenly remembered what Xiao Qixiu had said about this being his good fortune.Perhaps that detestable old man had given him the Infernal Fire Seed to get him to successfully refine it?Now that it had come to this, he was no longer hung up on how this item had once crippled a person with an Innate-stage physical body. No one was going to help him, so he had to depend on himself.The screen above the arena flickered. Names were chosen, and two people walked into the arena.The spectators were joyfully shouting. The atmosphere inside the arena was charged with energy.Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, was trying his best to refine the seed. He took out the Red Gold Pill and took a whiff of it from time to time, using the high to neutralize the pain and heal his injured body.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u2026The notification panel in his mind refreshed every second. Xu Xiaoshou was constantly being burned. On an average day, the number of passive points he was gaining would\u2019ve made him happy, but now\u2026Hehe, it had once crippled a person with an Innate-stage physical body.That sentence was like a nightmare, continuously coming back to haunt him.\u201cSigh, do I still have to participate in the competition? What\u2019s going on?Even though he was trying his best to hang in there, his condition was terrible. The meridians in his body were being severed one after the other, then restored time after time by the Red Gold Pill.The pain was unimaginable.\u201cOh, maybe I can dispel this scorching energy through battle?\u201d2Sometime later, Xu Xiaoshou, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, had a stroke of inspiration and abruptly stood up.That idea might work!He looked at the arena. Many pairs had already been drawn, however, his name hadn\u2019t been picked yet.The most eye-catching person in the arena right now was a man in white robes. His expression was cold, and he was wielding an Ice Stream Sword. His attacks turned his opponents into ice sculptures as he sliced his way to victory.\u201cZhao Qingteng, victorious!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes glimmered. Ice?He really wanted the other party to slice him with his sword. He\u2019d feel so comfortable he might explode!However, Zhao Qingteng\u2026He was an Innate-stage fighter!This made him a little nervous.The screen flickered again. Two names appeared in bold on the screen.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cZhang Fei!\u201d2As soon as the announcer\u2019s words fell, the spectators erupted with excitement. This was the second time this had happened. The first time was when the Innate-stage fighter Zhao Qingteng had entered the arena.\u201cHe\u2019s here, he\u2019s here, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cOpen your eyes wide, Sandbag Xu is coming!\u201d\u201cOh? Why is he called Sandbag Xu?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know? Let me tell you, that Xu Xiaoshou\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou immediately flew into the arena from the waiting area and once again ran to Xiao Qixiu. \u201cGive me treatment if I defeat this person!\u201d he pleaded.Xiao Qixiu\u2019s expression turned dark. What kind of candidate was this?\u201cI\u2019m a judge,\u201d he thought. \u201cWho do you take me for? You ran over here to talk to me like this?!\u201dOne of the people from the panel of judges behind Xiao Qixiu was elated. \u201cLook at Boss Xiao. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s only just come up to him, and he\u2019s already starting to get frustrated!\u201dHe was quite happy and observed Xu Xiaoshou with curiosity.\u201cGo back and stand in your corner!\u201d Xiao Qixiu scolded.Xu Xiaoshou pointed to his neck. It was billowing smoke.There was an unpleasant look on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s face as he looked at Xu Xiaoshou. However, he was the judge, so it wasn\u2019t like he could do anything to him.\u201cLook, this area is already burned red. I\u2019m a candidate. I have the right to receive treatment!\u201d\u201cHehe, you did this to yourself before the competition, so it has nothing to do with me!\u201dXiao Qixiu did want to treat Xu Xiaoshou, but even the best medical worker present, much less himself, wouldn\u2019t be able to help him, so all he could do was get Xu Xiaoshou to fight through the pain.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes glimmered when he heard this, and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Since I did this before the competition, it has nothing to do with you, but if I get injured during the competition, you have to treat me!\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201d He nodded hard, then muttered loudly to himself, \u201cFurthermore, according to the rules, you have to restore me to tip-top form!\u201dXiao Qixiu looked really angry now. \u201cScram!\u201cZhang Fei!\u201cWhere are you, Zhang Fei? Hurry and come into the arena!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23In the arena, Xu Xiaoshou looked menacing.There was a manic look in his eyes. He took off his shirt and revealed his chest. His body was stark red, and there was steam rising from his skin. He looked like a living god of war.4\u201cWhere are you, Zhang Fei? Come up here and battle me!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou shouted. He wanted to infuriate Zhang Fei to get him to attack him. That way, Xiao Qixiu would take action and save him when he saw the pitiful scene about to unfold.Of course, the most important thing was removing the Infernal Fire Seed in his body.In the waiting area.Zhang Fei and his friends looked worried.\u201cIn my opinion, you should admit defeat. He\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou. Besides the two Innate-stage fighters, he\u2019s the most notorious dark horse in this competition.\u201dZhang Fei looked a little hesitant. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at him. That guy really has taken drugs. Didn\u2019t you see him when he killed Wen Chong?\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t as manic then as he is now. If you go up the arena, you\u2019ll either be killed or dismembered!\u201dZhang Fei shivered. What his friend said made sense.But\u2026He raised his hand and looked at the bite mark on it. He knitted his brows and said, \u201cI just talked trash about him yesterday. Wouldn\u2019t it be really disgraceful to admit defeat the moment we encounter each other today?\u201d4\u201cIs losing face worse than losing your life?\u201dZhang Fei thought about it, then shook his head and said, \u201cHe might not be able to break through my defenses!\u201dHe shrugged off his friend\u2019s hand and quickly got into the arena.\u201cSigh, what a fool!\u201d A pitiful sigh came from behind Zhang Fei.\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re Zhang Fei?\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked at the tall muscular man. His fists were like bags of sand.Great. It would definitely be a pathetic scene if he got beaten up by this person.Which was the effect he wanted!He glanced smugly at Xiao Qixiu. The chief judge would have to save him if he was faced with the spectator\u2019s skepticism later!As long as the chief judge had to save him, there was no way he could disregard the seed in his body.Zhang Fei clasped his hands. \u201cHello, Senior Xu. The technique that I\u2019ve cultivated is called the Great Metal Bronze Body. My defenses are exceptional, so please don\u2019t hold back.\u201dGreat Metal Bronze Body?Xu Xiaoshou staggered. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a defensive spiritual technique?\u201d he thought. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be beating me up. How could you have cultivated such a technique? You\u2019re not living up to your great physique.\u201dXiao Qixiu instantly snickered. How could he not know what Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s plan was?He waved his hand. \u201cBattle, start!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t good. He had to force the other party to attack. Otherwise, his first plan would be foiled!He made a provocative gesture at Zhang Fei. Then, he got into a loose battle stance and signaled that he wasn\u2019t going to move if his opponent wasn\u2019t going to move.Zhang Fei gave a slight smile. He let out a low grunt and got into the same battle stance. The spiritual strength in his body surged as his skin turned a shade of copper.The battle reached a stalemate.The spectators burst out laughing.\u201cHahaha, I have to hand it to the both of them. This is a competition. What are they doing!\u201d\u201cZhang Fei\u2019s Great Metal Bronze Technique only has one retaliation move at the end. What\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou doing? Doesn\u2019t he have offensive techniques? Attack!\u201d\u201cAttack? Don\u2019t you know he\u2019s called Sandbag Xu? Xu Xiaoshou will only get attacked. He\u2019ll feel itchy all over if he isn\u2019t beaten up!\u201d1\u201cHaha, I can\u2019t take it anymore. We\u2019ll be watching them stay their stances until nightfall at this rate!\u201d1Xiao Qixiu\u2019s expression darkened. He\u2019d been angry more times today than in the entire year combined.All of them, what were they doing?This was a competition!\u201cPlease take note, candidates, that the battle only lasts 30 minutes!\u201dXu Xiaoshou knitted his brows. \u201cThis Zhang Fei has good focus. It looks like he isn\u2019t planning on attacking, so isn\u2019t my first plan foiled?\u201cDo I really have to attack to get rid of the scorching energy in my body?\u201dHe could attack, but he was afraid that his opponent wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it!Xu Xiaoshou turned back to look at Xiao Qixiu. \u201cYou\u2019re really not going to save me?\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d Xiao Qixiu replied with a snicker.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe my attack will kill him?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Zhang Fei.Zhang Fei\u2019s face turned green. He felt his legs go numb, and he fought back the urge to jump out of the arena.\u201cYour beef is with judge Xiao, not me,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy did you drag me into it?\u201dXiao Qixiu\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cThis lad is trying to threaten me?\u201d he thought.\u201cAttack if you please,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Zhang Fei dies, I lose!\u201dZhang Fei felt his legs shake. \u201cD*mn it. I\u2019m not an object you can wager on. I\u2019m a living person!\u201d2The panel of judges was startled.\u201cBoss Qiao\u2019s become furious?!\u201d\u201cDarn it, this Xu Xiaoshou is impressive. To think that he could make Boss Xiao utter those words. I have to hand it to him!\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019ve told you that this Xu Xiaoshou is impressive. However, I\u2019m quite worried about the lad on the other side.\u201d\u201cLevel Nine\u2026 He should be able to take the attack\u2026\u201dIn the arena, Xu Xiaoshou raised his brows slightly when he heard Xiao Qixiu\u2019s words. He wasn\u2019t looking at Zhang Fei. He was looking straight at Xiao Qixiu.\u201cAre you sure?\u201dHe activated the aura of the Infernal Fire Seed in his body, then fiercely punched the ground.Boom!A large crater appeared in the arena, and a scorching energy instantly blasted through the surroundings, burning the area a few meters around the crater pitch-black.\u201cI really took drugs. No one will be able to take this attack!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou flexed his arms to show his muscles.Just that?Xiao Qixiu looked disdainful.Zhang Fei was tired. Seeing how nonchalant Xu Xiaoshou was, as well as how unphased Xia Qixiu was, he could see his pitiful fate.\u201cSave me. Do I continue standing here or not?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s punch had scared him half to death and made everyone\u2019s eyelids twitch.\u201cMy God, that destructive power\u2026\u201d\u201cZhang Fei is too pitiful. He managed to defend his spot for three consecutive battles in the preliminary round, but it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t even exist in front of Xu Xiaoshou.\u201d\u201cPlease take a look at Zhang Fei before you guys continue with your conversation. His legs are trembling!\u201dZhang Fei\u2019s legs were trembling. But it wasn\u2019t just his legs. His voice also trembled as he said, \u201cSenior Xu, please hold back. Don\u2019t take what I said earlier seriously. Just give me a few light taps.\u201dHe muttered, \u201cPlease allow me to save face\u2026\u201dThe spectators burst out laughing. Seeing that Xiao Qixiu was silent, Xu Xiaoshou fiercely charged forward. \u201cEnjoy the last moments of your life!\u201dXiao Qixiu stared at him. Even though he felt that the lad was joking, he had to be prepared if Xu Xiaoshou was serious!Boom!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s punch landed on Zhang Fei\u2019s chest, and a pulsing, scorching energy burst forth, and he felt the high that comes with letting loose.Creak\u2026Zhang Fei\u2019s hair was singed, and even his clothes were a little charred. However, he didn\u2019t move from his position.Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. \u201cTo think that he managed to take his punch at 50% power!\u201d he thought. \u201cHe\u2019s decent!\u201dLetting loose really had an effect. His opponent had a strong defense. Since that was the case, the chief judge need not save him. He should save Zhang Fei!\u201cHuff!\u201dHe took a deep breath, engaging his diaphragm. This would be his first time using his spiritual strength in his attack.A visible scorching aura gathered around his left hand. It looked like his hand was burning with a formless fire, causing the area around it to distort slightly.Zhang Fei\u2019s pupils dilated.\u201cTake it, I have to take it!\u201d he thought. \u201cIt won\u2019t be embarrassing to admit defeat after taking this attack!\u201dXu Xiaoshou calmly said, \u201cOne punch, one palm!\u201dZhang Fei became flustered. He immediately changed his mind. \u201cI admit\u2026\u201dBoom!A beam of light flashed, and Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s punch landed on Zhang Fei\u2019s chest. An explosion was heard in the air, and a visible heatwave spread throughout the surroundings. The stones in the arena were instantly charred and sent flying.The pulsing spiritual strength behind this punch made Xu Xiaoshou feel as though he were slapping a mosquito. He instantly sent Zhang Fei flying.Zhang Fei hadn\u2019t yet finished his sentence when he immediately became unconscious from the impact and was sent flying out of the arena. His body was dragged backward along the ground from the momentum of his fall, creating a deep ravine in the ground.Thud, thud!Sparks flew the moment his body stopped flying backward, and flames erupted over his body.\u201cSave him!\u201d Xiao Qixiu roared.The white-robed angels didn\u2019t need to be told this. They\u2019d already gone over to Zhang Fei the moment he was sent flying. They split the work evenly between themselves and extinguished the fire and tended to Zhang Fei\u2019s wounds.\u201cThat felt great!\u201dXu Xiaoshou took out a Red Gold Pill and sniffed it. He let out a comfortable moan.3He had managed to expel a good amount of the scorching energy in his body from his attack. Even though he still felt miserable, he\u2019d won in terms of letting loose!3He glanced at Chief Judge Xiao, who was glaring at him. \u201cI was holding back,\u201d he said innocently. \u201cHe\u2019d already be dead if I hadn\u2019t.\u201dXiao Qixiu was speechless.The spectators were speechless.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Everyone in the arena gasped.\u201cHe really just used one punch and one palm!\u201d\u201cWhy do I feel so bad for Zhang Fei? But it is a little funny. He used all his effort to get into the top 64, but in the end\u2026\u201d1\u201cIt\u2019s undeniably funny. But this Xu Xiaoshou might be a little too powerful. He\u2019s almost as strong as the people ranked first and second on the scoreboard!\u201d\u201cAfter seeing this, can\u2019t you tell that this person might really have an Innate-stage physical body!?\u201d\u201cInnate-stage physical body?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Someone analyzed the situation a few days ago and said that the probability of that being true is 70%. Now that we just saw that punch and palm, I would think that probability has increased to 90%.\u201dMany people fell silent after hearing this. An Innate-stage physical body was extremely difficult to cultivate, and a person\u2019s efforts might not even yield any results, yet someone had managed to obtain an Innate-stage physical body?\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because Xu Xiaoshou took drugs? Look at the scorching heatwave radiating from his body. He\u2019s already requested to be barred from the competition. Why isn\u2019t the judge doing anything about it?\u201d some people protested out of jealousy, and their words naturally reached Xiao Qixiu\u2019s ears.He disregarded them. He didn\u2019t even care to explain himself.Everyone has their opportunities. Was there a rule against mastering a powerful technique before the competition?Even if there was such a rule, were they going to prohibit someone from training before the competition, achieving a breakthrough during the competition, or improving after reflecting on the competition?This was the case for Xu Xiaoshou. The Infernal Fire Seed that Elder Sang had given him couldn\u2019t even be regarded as an opportunity, as his body might be destroyed if things went wrong.You can obtain an Innate-stage physical body if you have the ability, but someone might use you as the subject for their experiment.Xu Xiaoshou ignored his surroundings and walked back to the waiting area. The competition continued. Thirty-two people out of the original 64 would be advancing. There were still many battles to go. He had more than enough time to rest.While he sniffed at the Red Gold Pill, he paid attention to his notification panel and couldn\u2019t help but be elated.\u201cGot respected. Passive Points +142.\u201d\u201cGot envied. Passive Points +874.\u201d\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +113.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201dThe notifications told him about the emotions he had stirred up rather than the Passive Points he\u2019d gained!\u201cListen, so many people in the spectator seats are saying good things about me!\u201d he thought. \u201cLook, so many people are secretly envious of me. Tsk tsk!\u201dXu Xiaoshou glanced down the notifications.\u201cPassive Points: 42888.\u201d3Clang!He hit his head on the railing, and a wave of mocking laughter came from the spectator seats. The number of Passive Points soared again to 43003.\u201cHow could I have so many?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was stunned. He remembered that he only had a little more than 10000 points after the three battles in the preliminary round. How could his Passive Points have skyrocketed in just one morning?He tried his best to think back but couldn\u2019t recall having done anything to anger anyone.\u201cKilling Wen Chong?\u201cImpossible,\u201d he thought. I was still in the barrier during that time and wouldn\u2019t have received the bulk of the Passive Points then. Even if I had, I imagine it would\u2019ve been several hundred points, or a little more than a thousand at most.\u201cHow could the points have risen by more than 30000!\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou quickly scrolled through the past notifications to take a look. All of the notifications looked objective and realistic. They each gave him a dozen or several hundred points, but no numbers larger than that appeared.\u201cCould the system have made a mistake?\u201d The thought flashed through his mind. However, he quickly discarded the idea. He\u2019d sooner believe that a meteor was falling from the sky.,\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u2026While he was in a daze, the notification panel continued to update every second. It constantly updated. Xu Xiaoshou groggily looked at the notifications, then suddenly slapped himself on the head.\u201cThe Infernal Fire Seed?!\u201d He seemed to understand what was going on now.His body had continuously been burned since dawn, which was when he ate the item. The system must have classified the burn as an attack received per second.Which meant that he\u2019d gotten one Passive Point every second.Getting a Passive Point every second wasn\u2019t very impressive, and Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t pay it any attention.However, those points would really add up as time went on!Xu Xiaoshou did a simple calculation in his head. It must\u2019ve been around seven in the morning when he met that detestable old man. It looked like a little more than three periods had passed.1Xu Xiaoshou started counting on his fingers, then used his toes to continue counting.Three periods was six hours. There were sixty minutes in an hour, sixty seconds in a minute\u2026Over 20000 seconds!2Over 20000 Passive Points!Creak!Xu Xiaoshou exhaled two jets of steam and forgot about the chair he was sitting on. He released the spiritual strength around his buttocks and the heat emanating from his body completely melted the chair.3He fell onto the ground with a thump.An attendant immediately ran over and asked him what happened.In a daze, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand to signal that he wasn\u2019t in any trouble. The attendant was about to leave when Xu Xiaoshou quickly stopped him. \u201cWait, help me calculate how many seconds there are in a day,\u201d he said.\u201cA day?\u201dThe attendant thought for a while, then said, \u201cAround 86400 seconds, I think!\u201dThud!Xu Xiaoshou crushed the cup in his hand. He\u2019d been struggling to get up, but he fell limply onto the ground once again. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cSay it again!\u201dThe attendant looked at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body, which was constantly emitting steam. He didn\u2019t know whether to help him up or not. All he could do was say again, \u201cEighty-six thousand and four hundred!\u201d\u201cGulp!\u201dXu Xiaoshou swallowed. More than 80000?His facial expressions were interesting. One second it was pain, then bliss, then shock, then a silly grin\u2026The attendant didn\u2019t know why Xu Xiaoshou was acting so insane, but then he suddenly remembered the instructions he\u2019d gotten from the panel of judges. He needn\u2019t care about Xu Xiaoshou, no matter what requests he had or what condition he was in. He could just regard Xu Xiaoshou as an idiot.He silently left the waiting area, thinking that the chief judge lived up to his reputation. He knew about everything!Xu Xiaoshou held up the Red Gold Pill and took a deep breath to quell his agitation, and shuddered. After doing this, he noticed that he was about to run out of Red Gold Pills.In just a little more than half a day, he had used up the two bottles of pills Elder Qiao and the previous judge had given him.Xu Xiaoshou thought it was a pity. Those were items that could save his life!However, this proved how powerful the Infernal Fire Seed was.1However, after realizing how valuable the Infernal Fire Seed was, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer in so much pain that he needed to vent. Instead, he started to feel happy.\u201cPain?\u201d he thought.\u201cHehe, it\u2019ll pass in a flash.\u201cA successful man doesn\u2019t become successful without going through immense pain. If I only pay attention to the pain, I won\u2019t experience the bliss that comes after.\u201dHe waved his hand and summoned the attendant once again. \u201cGo and look for Elder Xiao, the chief judge in the arena,\u201d he instructed. \u201cAsk him for some Red Gold Pills. Remember to bring me some.\u201dThe attendant looked at him like he was an idiot.\u201cAre you dreaming?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face was already red, so there was nothing for him to be shy about. He continued, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you the three-sentence technique. Remember it well!\u201d\u201cFirst, if he doesn\u2019t agree, tell him, \u2018you were unwilling to give me medical attention, so you should at least give me some Red Gold Pills. I\u2019m also a candidate. I will not stand for this!'\u201dThe attendant was at his wit\u2019s end. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019d dare to talk to Elder Xiao like this?\u201d he thought. \u201cHe\u2019s the chief elder of the Spiritual Law Division, not a street vendor.1\u201cAnd for free?\u201cKeep dreaming!\u201d\u201cSecond,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou continued, \u201cIf he still doesn\u2019t agree, you can say, \u2018Hehe, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re partners in crime and are experimenting on human bodies.\u2019 Your tone must be firm. You must be fierce!\u201dThe attendant was a little dizzy. \u201cThis Xu Xiaoshou is definitely daring,\u201d he thought. \u201cBe fierce? Have a firm tone? Why don\u2019t you go and die?\u201d\u201cThird, he must have agreed by this point. There\u2019s no way that he\u2019d dismiss the request. You can add a final line, \u2018Since you\u2019re already willing to give me the pills, are you not embarrassed that you\u2019re giving so little? Add a zero to the back!'\u201d1\u201cGo yourself!\u201d the attendant laughed coldly.\u201cGo by myself?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou immediately became unhappy. \u201cI\u2019m a candidate, and you\u2019re an attendant. We each have our jobs to do!\u201cI still have to battle and fight later, so I need to recuperate now. Hurry and head over.\u201cDo your best. Don\u2019t be afraid. He isn\u2019t scary. You have to know that people who hold higher positions than you are more afraid of soiling their reputation. He wouldn\u2019t attack you for no reason.\u201dThe attendant staggered backward. \u201cAre the things you\u2019re asking of me not good reason enough?\u201d he thought.\u201cGo!\u201dXu Xiaoshou waved his hand. The attendant didn\u2019t know how to react momentarily, and could only leave with a bitter expression on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s too hard!\u201d he thought.\u201cI want to change my job!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Xu Xiaoshou immediately returned to the red interface after the attendant left.\u201cSharpness (Acquired Lv. 9)\u201d\u201cSharpness (Acquired Lv. 10)\u201d\u201cSharpness (Innate Lv. 1)1Xu Xiaoshou held a spirit crystal in his mouth and constantly inhaled it. His eyes were unfocused, and there was a blissful, foolish smile on his face.1When he was poor, he\u2019d never dreamed that being rich could make him this happy.He splurged on his techniques since he now had so many Passive Points. However, he only spent 3000 points, which was negligible considering he now had more than 40000 Passive Points.Xu Xiaoshou finally had a second Innate-stage passive skill after Strengthen.As Sharpness reached the Innate-stage, an undulating transparent sheen appeared on the surface of his body. It looked like it could slice through anything. It looked like a glistening treasure, and was extremely splendid.Xu Xiaoshou had a thought. He willed the light to gather in his forearm and transformed his arm into a blade. Then, he sliced his hand down toward the ground.1Creak!A deep crack appeared in the ground, as if a sharp blade had just sliced through it.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes glimmered, and he gathered the light to his toes and swept toward the ground again.\u201cCreak!\u201dHis shoes were torn apart.Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.However, he couldn\u2019t contain his excitement when he saw the sword-like marks under his feet.\u201cIndeed, every passive skill will undergo a huge transformation when it\u2019s raised to the Innate-stage.\u201dHe remembered Strengthen. That passive skill had taken his body into the Innate-stage the moment it reached the Innate-stage. Now, a transparent glow that gave every part of his body extraordinary slicing capabilities had appeared the moment Sharpness reached the Innate-stage.1This was the best weapon for assassins. It was indefensible.He could suddenly kick an opponent during the competition and tear enemies into two\u2026Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but tremble at the thought. That was too terrifying!Because it was a passive skill, there was no casting time or prelude, so how could anyone defend against his attack, even if he used it out in the open?They couldn\u2019t!\u201cYou can defend against my kick to your nether regions, but can you defend against the rest of my attacks?\u201dXu Xiaoshou thought outside the box. He gathered the transparent glow onto his hair, then took out a spirit crystal and threw it up into the air.Thud, thud!His hair swept past the crystal, and the crystal, which was as hard as granite, was reduced to fragments. The pieces hit the ground with a series of thuds.Xu Xiaoshou was dazed. \u201cThat was an unconventional idea. But it worked?\u201dHe felt immense pity for the shattered spirit crystals on the ground. \u201cWhat a waste,\u201d he thought. \u201cI should have tested the passive skill on a piece of rock instead.\u201d5Xu Xiaoshou finally realized how powerful the Passive System really was. Each of his passive skills were spiritual techniques that could be upgraded. Furthermore, he could enhance them without training.1Currently, he had two Innate-stage spiritual skills, and he had another two skills that could be enhanced to the Innate-stage!But this wasn\u2019t the most important thing. More crucially, these were all passive skills. If used well, they were basically active skills that could be instantly cast!\u201cThat\u2019s too terrifying\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou giggled as he exchanged his points for ten Passive Keys. I\u2019ll use 10000 Passive Points for now. I\u2019ll top it off if that\u2019s not enough!Originally, the Fleeting White Clouds was his trump card. However, he\u2019d had to show it before he wanted to because of Wen Chong, and no longer had a finishing move in his arsenal.Having all of his trump cards exposed was a dangerous thing.He had to obtain a passive skill with more destructive capabilities. Otherwise, he might not be able to defeat the two Innate-stage fighters, Mo Mo and Zhao Qingteng, if he encountered them in his upcoming battles.1Xu Xiaoshou had become a little arrogant. At the very least, in his eyes, only the two Innate-stage fighters could be a match for him in the Outer Yard.That was the truth. He\u2019d even defeated powerful people like Wen Chong, Liu Zhen, and Zhang Fei. In the eyes of the crowd, he had the right to compete for the top spot on the scoreboard.Xu Xiaoshou placed the keys into the wheel one by one, feeling really good. He\u2019d feel even better if he got a black screen again.The illusion of the white clouds that the Sword Technique Expertise had given him had more than doubled his powers, and he naturally wanted more.As the last key disappeared, Xu Xiaoshou went through his routine and shouted, \u201cHah! RNGesus bless me!\u201d and then looked expectantly at the notification panel.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d1This\u2026Thump!Xu Xiaoshou fainted, and his eyes rolled back into his head as he fell face-first onto the ground.Another attendant in the waiting area felt that something was off. He had constantly been keeping an eye on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s antics. Xu Xiaoshou had sliced the ground and tossed his hair around, looking like he was having a lot of fun playing by himself, just like a child from the attendant\u2019s family.However, why did he suddenly fall?!This was a grave matter.He quickly ran over and shook Xu Xiaoshou awake. Xu Xiaoshou was dazed when he first woke up, and he fainted again when he saw the notification panel.6\u201cF***!\u201cThe judge was right. This Xu Xiaoshou is a handful!\u201d he thought.As a qualified attendant, he had some medical experience and could tell that Xu Xiaoshou had fainted from mental trauma.But\u2026This was his first time seeing someone make himself faint by tossing his hair around!4Slap, slap, slap!The attendant repeatedly slapped Xu Xiaoshou using his spiritual strength, and finally woke Xu Xiaoshou up again. Xu Xiaoshou, who had just woken up, looked blankly at the attendant, and two rivers of tears flowed down his cheeks.The attendant was flustered. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to you when you were unconscious!\u201d\u201cLeave, I don\u2019t want to see you. Let me have some time alone!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou cried.1The attendant was confused.He turned around and decidedly left.Xu Xiaoshou felt extremely bitter. He had considered the worst-case scenario, but he hadn\u2019t expected it to really happen.\u201cThat was 10000 Passive Points!\u201d\u201cGone just like that. You\u2019re toying with me!\u201cYou didn\u2019t even give me an extra key. You\u2019re cruel, you\u2019re merciless, you\u2019re ridiculous!\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt like his body had been hollowed out, and he no longer had the strength to stand up. He thought about the 30000 points he had left. \u201cShould I level up the Breathing Technique and Sword Technique Expertise?\u201d he thought.2\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe this. I\u2019ll do ten more spins!\u201d13Xu Xiaoshou was someone who would never admit defeat. At least, that was what he thought. Thus, he exchanged his points for ten more keys.\u201cIf I don\u2019t get anything this time, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026\u201cHah!\u201d He exhaled and chose to give in to his fear. He silently inserted the keys until the last one had disappeared.\u201cHah! RN\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou shouted out of habit, but then his voice gradually became softer, and he looked up at the sky without saying anything.\u201cForget it, I can\u2019t get hyped up,\u201d he thought to himself.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cObtained Fundamental Passive Skill: Eternal Vitality!\u201d8\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes shone with greed, and he bounced around with excitement.\u201cLook at that long line that\u2019s so out of place!\u201d1\u201cI! Got! Something!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dHe laughed maniacally at the sky. The Passive Points needed for 20 keys was equivalent to the points needed to level-up two techniques to the Innate-stage. But he\u2019d gotten a new passive skill out of that. Was it worth it?Yes!Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was extremely worth it!He couldn\u2019t level-up his skills if he didn\u2019t have any, but he could slowly amass more points in the future to level-up the skills he\u2019d obtained.Xu Xiaoshou hugged the pillar and bounced around as if he\u2019d gone insane. He raised his head, and his manic laugh spread through the waiting area.2\u201cHe\u2019s gone mad, he\u2019s gone mad!\u201dThe attendant looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was constantly rubbing himself against the pillar, looking like he\u2019d just opened a door to a whole new world.Could someone really get that much happiness from playing by oneself?7\u201cAm I the one who can\u2019t keep up with the times?\u201dHe sighed melancholically as he looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was hugging the pillar. He was extremely worried, as the pillar got a little thinner every time Xu Xiaoshou jumped. What a terrifying situation!2Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Xu Xiaoshou hadn\u2019t accessed the interface in a long time. He opened it and looked at the first section.One, Fundamental Passive Skills:Breathing Technique (Acquired Lv. 1).5Eternal Vitality (Acquired Lv. 1).The new passive skill he\u2019d gotten was in the \u201cFundamental Passive Skill\u201d section, which surprised him a little.He was no longer a newbie that didn\u2019t know anything about the system. While fundamental passive skills weren\u2019t comparatively as functional as extended passive skills, their supportive capabilities were terrifying.This was evident in the Breathing Technique, which belonged to the same category as the new technique.Xu Xiaoshou had never leveled up the Breathing Technique, but not because the skill wasn\u2019t powerful. On the contrary, it was too powerful. The side effects that came with making the technique stronger were a little scary, and Xu Xiaoshou was afraid of them.4\u201cSo will Eternal Vitality also be this powerful?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou mulled over the passive skill\u2019s name. \u201cMy life force will be eternally flowing?\u201d1\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, won\u2019t it be a great help to me?\u201dHe looked into his body at his energy reserve and then focused his attention on the Infernal Fire Seed that was continuously being refined.The seed was only the size of a fingernail, but it harbored a horrifying amount of energy that was impossible to quantify.Xu Xiaoshou would be put through torturous pain as long as this item was inside him. It was releasing a scorching aura every second that was manically eating at his insides.His blood, nerves, bones\u2026Everything, including his cells, was being engulfed by the scorching aura.The surface of his body was blood red, but that only looked terrible. If a person could see inside his body, they\u2019d realize that he was injured all over.Every inch of his muscles had been charred to a crisp, and his meridians had been baked until they severed.However, because of the Breathing Technique\u2019s existence, all he needed to do was take a whiff of a Red Gold Pill whenever his injuries were aggravated to instantly recover, allowing him to last a little longer.Now, he was almost at the end of his supply of Red Gold Pills. He no longer had any to smell. However, when he observed himself now, he saw that his ravaged nerves and bones were slowly recovering on their own.3But their recovery speed couldn\u2019t keep up with the speed at which they were being destroyed. However, his recovery rate had become much faster than that of the average person!Xu Xiaoshou immediately realized that this was the effect of Eternal Vitality.\u201cSo the effect of this new passive skill is accelerating the speed at which my injuries heal?\u201dIt was the best technique he could\u2019ve asked for!Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t hesitate. He still had 20,000 points after spinning the wheel 20 times. Thus, he purchased five Skill Points and dumped it all into the passive skill.\u201cEternal Vitality (Acquired Lv. 6).\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked visibly more refreshed. Vitality coursed through his body, and his injuries were instantly greatly alleviated.\u201cIndeed!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou looked surprised. What a miraculous technique!He once again purchased five Skill Points and used them on the technique.\u201cEternal Vitality (Innate Lv. 1).\u201dA rich life force spread out into the surroundings like a web, and it made the attendant who was constantly glancing at Xu Xiaoshou suddenly more energetic.He was shocked and immediately averted his gaze. However, he now felt like he had unlimited energy and suddenly started to miss home.4If it had this strong of an effect on an outsider, then it probably had an even stronger effect on him. His mouth opened wide in shock as he observed the situation in his body.The destruction speed of the Infernal Fire Seed had been forcefully evened out by the Eternal Vitality. Both effects had reached a stalemate, neither of them surpassing the other.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was stunned. This recovery rate was a little too terrifying!He\u2019d had to use two bottles of Red Gold Pills to counteract half a day\u2019s worth of the Infernal Fire Seed\u2019s effects. That was nearly ten Red Gold Pills.Yet the recovery rate of Eternal Vitality could go toe to toe with the destructive capabilities of the seed. Didn\u2019t that mean he\u2019d no longer have to consume Red Gold Pills to recover from his injuries in the future?2That would save him a lot of resources!Then, the attendant, who was still glancing at Xu Xiaoshou out of curiosity, became mortified when he saw him take out the ninth-grade spiritual sword from within his ring and stab it into his palm.1Puuu!Blood splattered everywhere, and the attendant thought that the situation had taken a turn for the worse.1He\u2019d shaken his head and fainted for no reason, which was bad enough, and now he was starting to mutilate himself?There must be something wrong with that Xu Xiaoshou!Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t care. He looked at the stab wound on his palm. It recovered at a rapid pace and was fully healed in an instant.It didn\u2019t even leave a scar!\u201cOh, f***\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but curse. The Innate-stage Eternal Vitality healed him a lot faster than the Red Gold Pill.Thud, thud, thud!Xu Xiaoshou heard footsteps from far away. He looked over and saw that it was the attendant who\u2019d run off just now.He had ten medicine bottles in his hands, and his face was filled with disbelief. He didn\u2019t expect to obtain the Red Gold Pills from Elder Xiao just by following what Xu Xiaoshou had told him to do. He even managed to obtain ten bottles. It was like a dream.2More importantly, this batch of pills had been given to him for free!Xu Xiaoshou smiled widely. \u201cYou managed to get it. Ten bottles?\u201dThe attendant felt as if he\u2019d just woken up from a dream, and he nodded in a daze.\u201cDid it feel good?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou asked. \u201cTalking like that to the chief elder of the Spiritual Law Division? That must\u2019ve been the highlight of your life, right?\u201dThe attendant nodded profusely.\u201cFeeling good is great. And there\u2019s something for you to feel even better about!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou waved his arm. \u201cYou can have all of those!\u201d2The attendant was dumbfounded. \u201cNo no no, these are your items. I can\u2019t take these!\u201dHe hadn\u2019t come to his senses. Even though he didn\u2019t know what kind of insanity Xu Xiaoshou was under, he had professional standards and would never accept bribes.Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m willing. Keep them!\u201dThe attendant continued shaking his head.\u201cYou really don\u2019t want them?\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou fetched the ten bottles of Red Gold Pills from him and waved at the other attendant, who looked envious. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll give these all to you!\u201dAttendant A was speechless.Attendant B was also speechless.Both of them were completely silent. They looked at each other and saw that they were both trying to suppress their desire.Xu Xiaoshou fought back the desire to laugh. \u201cAll right, there are only the two of you here. No one will notice if you guys split this among yourselves!\u201dThe two of them shook their heads.Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cMust you put a damper on my mood?\u201d he scolded. \u201cTwo bottles for each of you. End of discussion.\u201dThe attendants still wanted to decline, but Xu Xiaoshou took out Hiding Pain and stabbed it into the ground.1\u201cAre you taking it or not?!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dHe secretly gifted four out of the ten bottles he\u2019d received.It couldn\u2019t be helped. These people were too cowardly to accept his gift, so he had to use his sword to force them to accept. Fortunately, with a little bit of force and coercion, he eventually ended up sharing his happiness with the people around him.2After all, these were Red Gold Pills. These were recovery pills that someone might not be able to obtain even if they begged for it. Thus, the two attendants were happy to go against the rules this one time.Of course, they were rather morally upright under normal circumstances. Xu Xiaoshou could vouch for them.Evening was approaching. The 32 people advancing to the next round had finally been determined. According to the rules, they had to determine the top 16 candidates today.Xu Xiaoshou hadn\u2019t finished being happy after giving away the pills when he heard the judge call his name. He immediately left the waiting area and headed toward the arena.His shadow elongated under the setting sun.The two attendants each held a bottle of Red Gold Pills in their hands, feeling that the heavily injured figure returning to the arena looked extraordinarily attractive.1\u201cI never once thought that Xu Xiaoshou was like that.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cGenerous, suave, a cut above the rest.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cEven though he gets a little insane from time to time, it actually makes him look rather cute.\u201d5\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Urgh!\u201d\u201cYes, yes, oh?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27On the Chuyun Platform, in the main arena.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cZhou Tianshen!\u201dTwo tall and slender figures walked over under the light of the setting sun. Zhou Tianshen\u2019s waiting area wasn\u2019t far away from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s. Their eyes met the moment they walked out of their respective waiting areas.Xu Xiaoshou saw that his opponent was carrying a blade that was taller than he was. He also saw the desire to battle in his opponent\u2019s eyes and nodded with satisfaction.It looked like his opponent wasn\u2019t going to admit defeat.That was natural. Whoever won this match would advance to the top 16. Who would give up on that chance?Zhou Tianshen was born with a handsome face. He had practiced the gold domineering blade technique for many years, and was charismatic, which gave him a youthful ferocity. Many female disciples squealed when he walked out.In the arena, he gently stabbed his wide, tall, and golden blade into the ground. Then, he propped both of his hands on the blade\u2019s guard and lifted his head slightly.\u201cAcquired-stage Sword Will, Innate-stage physical body\u2026\u201cXu Xiaoshou, I, Zhou Tianshen, will admit that you\u2019re very powerful!\u201cIn the Outer Yard, you\u2019re the only one who has the right to be ranked below me as rank five on the Windcloud Scoreboard!\u201dThe audience was in an uproar. Several people were overwhelmed by Zhou Tianshen\u2019s cold, arrogant aura.When Zhou Tianshen spoke, he left no room for doubt. Coupled with his abilities as the fighter ranked fourth on the Windcloud Scoreboard, he did seem exceptionally overbearing.Xu Xiaoshou gave a calm smile.For the first time, someone was provoking him first after taking the stage instead of him having to provoke them. It was exceptionally refreshing.Without waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to speak, Zhou Tianshen continued and said, \u201cBut, my target this time is rank one.\u201d\u201cSo, you have to submit to my blade!\u201d1After saying this, Zhou Tianshen pulled out the golden blade from the ground and pointed it at Xu Xiaoshou. A boundless, pulsing Blade Will surged out of his blade.Crack, crack!The Blade Will ravaged the surroundings, and the area around the arena was ripped apart.\u201cAcquired-stage Blade Will!\u201dEveryone in the spectator seats instantly trembled, and all of them had looks of disbelief on their faces.\u201cWhen did Zhou Tianshen learn the Acquired-stage Blade Will? My God!\u201d\u201cJudging from how well he can control it, he must have mastered it more than a year ago. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s in danger this time.\u201cHe could rival an Innate-stage fighter just with this Blade Will. I thought he was boasting when he said he was aiming for the top spot. But now it might\u2026\u201dXiao Qixiu was also startled. This person had hidden his abilities well. No one from the group stage or preliminary stage had forced him to use his full powers?If it weren\u2019t for Xu Xiaoshou being his opponent, he could\u2019ve hidden his Acquired-stage Blade will until after he reached the finals.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s calm smile stiffened. What was going on?An Acquired-stage Blade Will?And he can control it at will?He remembered that his Fleeting White Cloud would instantly deplete his spiritual strength, while his opponent\u20262There was no such possibility!However, he couldn\u2019t lose in terms of spirit, so Xu Xiaoshou twitched his lips into a smile and said, \u201cJunior Zhou, don\u2019t be too overconfident.\u201dZhou Tianshen\u2019s lethal Blade Will suddenly halted, and everyone watching immediately burst out laughing.\u201cHahaha, it looks like Xu Xiaoshou must be one of the oldest people in the Outer Yard!\u201d\u201cOne of the oldest? He is the last of his batch. Those more experienced than him have all already entered the Inner Yard, while those weaker than him wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to the advancement stage!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Then isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou the most senior disciple in the Outer Yard?\u201d1\u201cIn theory, that should be the case. However, in his three years at the Outer Yard, he never once showed his abilities. And he was almost kicked out of the Spirit Palace\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why he suddenly had such a showing. He\u2019s a true dark horse. It\u2019s like his body\u2019s been taken over by someone else!\u201d13\u201cHahaha, you sure are funny. Taken over!\u201d1\u201cIf we think about it that way, even strong fighters like Mo Mo and Zhao Qingteng are considered juniors in front of him\u2026 Haha, I can\u2019t stand it any longer. Look at Zhou Tianshen. His expression\u2019s darkened!\u201dZhou Tianshen\u2019s expression had darkened, but his Blade Will had become much more lethal. Xiao Qixiu saw that the situation had reached its breaking point and immediately waved his arm.\u201cBattle, start!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Zhou Tianshen said coldly while holding his blade horizontally, putting a damper on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s high spirits.The crowd was curious. \u201cWere these candidates negatively influenced by Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d they thought. \u201cWhy are they all acting so strangely?\u201cWhy is he talking instead of fighting?\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to clarify before the battle starts,\u201d Zhou Tianshen said. \u201cEven though Wen Chong was despicable for launching a sneak attack on you yesterday, you shouldn\u2019t have taken his life. You could\u2019ve just lightly punished him, but you took such a merciless approach instead!\u201dHe pointed his blade at Xu Xiaoshou, a righteous look in his eyes. \u201cIn my eyes, you\u2019re a despicable lowlife who\u2019ll never amount to anything great!\u201dXu Xiaoshou wanted to wrap a coat around Zhou Tianshen. He said nonchalantly, \u201cThis is why you wanted to mock me before the battle? To conquer my mind before my body?\u201d1Zhou Tianshen froze. He nearly choked, \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to break your spirit before defeating you. I was merely stating facts!\u201d1\u201cHehe, did you get close to the arena that day? Did you get a good look at the incident?\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou rambled on, \u201cYet you spouted nonsense and slandered me the moment you stepped into the arena. Will you be justified in killing me if I said I intentionally killed Wen Chong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that!\u201dZhou Tianshen was flustered. He shifted from side to side with his blade in hand. His face was red. He seemed to want to say something but didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou shouted, shaking his head. His aura was imposing as he said, \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say next. You\u2019re going to say that I have a glib tongue!\u201d2\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d\u201cHehe, people like you always like to stand on a moral high ground and criticize others, yet you\u2019ve never once thought that your so-called words of justice are the true blades that pierce a person\u2019s heart!\u201dZhou Tianshen repeatedly stepped backward, and his eyes dimmed. His Blade Will had been completely overpowered by Xu Xiaoshou. He fiercely lifted his sword and straightened up his posture. He wasn\u2019t going to talk anymore.\u201cWhy?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou turned the tables and asked, \u201cYou speak when you\u2019re not supposed to and can\u2019t win in an argument against me after speaking. You can\u2019t even outtalk me, and now you want to attack me?\u201dZhou Tianshen held his blade in his hand. He didn\u2019t know whether to attack Xu Xiaoshou or not. He was at a loss, and felt extremely embarrassed.Xu Xiaoshou looked calm on the surface, but he was laughing maniacally on the inside. He\u2019d already guessed that Zhou Tianshen was someone with a one-track mind.He was a person who touted justice and was extremely passionate. He usually only saw things at face value or would frequently be used by other people after being misled. He was so dumb it was cute.Everyone in the spectator seats was shocked. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s words were not only the best reply he could\u2019ve given to yesterday\u2019s events, but it also confused the thoughts of those still suspicious of him.\u201cHng hng, that Xu Xiaoshou is so pitiful. I was wrong about him!\u201d\u201cThat detestable Zhou Tianshen is trash! Shameless! He wants to break Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s mind before defeating him!\u201d\u201cOh, f***! You guys must be mad. Isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s doing the spirit-breaking here Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cMy God, how can he say it like that? I nearly fell for his trick. Fight on, Zhou Tianshen! Don\u2019t be fooled by him! Cleave him with your blade!\u201dIn the arena, Xu Xiaoshou saw that his opponent was hesitating and looked like he was about to admit defeat. He suddenly realized that he had gone a little too far, and he quickly spoke again.\u201cJunior Zhou, even though we can\u2019t always look at things at face value, as a Spiritual Cultivator you must never admit defeat once you step into an arena.\u201cYou have to know this. Giving up before a battle is a great disrespect to one\u2019s opponent, and running away without battling is a humiliation to Spiritual Cultivators. Raising one\u2019s hands to surrender is a black stain on one\u2019s life!\u201dHe flailed his sleeves and looked exceptionally charismatic. His words were spirited.1On the other side, Zhou Tianshen looked like a weight had been lifted from his chest. He grabbed onto his golden blade, his eyes blazing with the desire to battle once again. He clasped his hands and said, \u201cSenior Xu, thank you for the lesson!\u201dXu Xiaoshou nodded slightly, as though he did see Zhou Tianshen as a teachable student.Xiao Qixiu was speechless.2Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Clank\u2026Xu Xiaoshou was almost sent flying backward when the golden domineering blade and Hiding Pain collided for the first time. His spirit power surged in his body, and he almost vomited blood.\u201cThat felt great!\u201d Zhou Tianshen laughed heartily. \u201cLet\u2019s continue!\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked confused. For the first time, he was at a disadvantage in terms of strength with his Innate-stage physical body, and his opponent had even stolen his lines.How detestable!\u201cI can\u2019t take his attacks head-on\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou deliberated. His opponent\u2019s Acquired-stage Blade Will had to be a frontal-assault type technique, so with his weaknesses, he would definitely be defeated if faced with his opponent\u2019s strong suits.He wanted to try fighting Zhou Tianshen with his Innate-stage Sharpen but was afraid he\u2019d be cleaved in two with one strike, so he was forced to abandon the idea.Since that was the case, he could only use his opponent\u2019s blade techniques to test out his Acquired-stage Sword Will.Seeing the other party cleave toward him with brutal force, Xu Xiaoshou held onto Hiding Pain and thought about the countless techniques he\u2019d gained while in the illusion of white clouds.Those were killing techniques that he\u2019d hidden deep inside his mind!The golden blade was directly above Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s head. Xu Xiaoshou slanted his sword to defend against the attack but saw the golden domineering blade slice down along the body of his sword. He flicked his sword, and a fleeting yet weighty force fiercely pushed the golden domineering blade to the side.Whoosh!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword sliced across the air in front of Zhou Tianshen\u2019s throat. Zhou Tianshen abruptly leaned backward, and the sword sliced off a few strands of his hair.Zhou Tianshen followed through with the momentum and rolled on the ground. Then, he waved his domineering blade and caused a rich spiritual power to surge and slashed his blade down toward Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s knee.Clang!Xu Xiaoshou had stabbed Hiding Pain at the ground when he missed his opponent, and the sword accurately stabbed the area where the blade and guard of Zhou Tianshen\u2019s domineering blade connected and let out a loud buzz.The two candidates looked at each other. They saw the passion in each other\u2019s eyes, and could almost see smoke in the air from how heated they were.Xu Xiaoshou flexed his arms and instantly propelled the two of them apart.The crowd cheered after the electrifying first bout, their blood racing with excitement as they observed the battle.\u201cIt\u2019s here. Acquired-stage Blade Will vs Acquired-stage Sword Will!\u201d\u201cMy God, how harrowing. Zhou Tianshen would\u2019ve had his throat sliced open, while Xu Xiaoshou would\u2019ve had his knees severed if they\u2019d been careless. This battle is going to get exciting.\u201d\u201cDefinitely. Furthermore, they\u2019re both extremely quick to react. All advancement battles should be like this. I can\u2019t get used to those one-sided victories.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. These two have only been at it for a few seconds, but they\u2019ve nearly died on several occasions.\u201dThe crowd was still talking excitedly when they saw that Zhou Tianshen was the first to steady his blade. However, he didn\u2019t attack. Instead, he laughed heartily and said, \u201cXu Xiaoshou, witness my Nine Tides!\u201dNine Tides was a blade technique that unleashed a constant stream of cuts, each attack stronger than the last. If Zhou Tianshen managed to get a momentum going, there was no way Xu Xiaoshou would be able to defend against the attack if it was paired with the Acquired-stage Blade Aura that Zhou Tianshen could control at will.He slowly raised his knife vertically, and the strength of his aura increased as he gradually brought the blade up.On the other side, the young man wielding the sword was silent. He immediately closed his eyes, and a mysterious atmosphere seemed to engulf the arena. Even the debris in the air seemed to slow down.This was a starkly different kind of battle. The blade and sword were keeping each other in check.Crack, crack!The arena under their feet gave way under the force of their techniques, and even the barrier started to violently tremble.1The spectators were sitting upright, their fingers laced. Even Xiao Qixiu was concentrating hard on the battle, his eyes squinted.The rising tension reached a breaking point, and even the sky seemed to tremble.The next second, Zhou Tianshen slashed down with his blade, and his Blade Will transformed into a wave and rose and fell as it advanced. On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou abruptly opened his eyes and slowly sliced his sword through the air. His attack was like a cloud in the sky, enveloping the entirety of Zhou Tianshen\u2019s wave.Clang, clang, clang!The crowd held its breath and saw the reality of the situation in the area between the two candidates.Outline of sword and blade clashed wherever the wave and clouds crossed, and the sound of weaponry clashing was endless.\u201cMy God, they\u2019re this powerful?\u201d someone couldn\u2019t help but say.A person to the side immediately scolded, \u201cStop talking. Shut your mouth!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s robes rustled in the wind, and his hands became after-images. His attacks looked like they were slow as fleeting clouds, but in reality, his sword was dancing at a high speed.2Countless sword glows shot out from the body of Hiding Pain. This was Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s first time using the ninth-grade spiritual sword at full power, and his sword was buzzing excitedly with joy as it went all out to show off its strength.However, Xu Xiaoshou still had to dodge from time to time to avoid the blade glows that his body couldn\u2019t handle, but even so, streaks of blood started appearing on his shirt.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHis notification panel constantly updated. Zhou Tianshen\u2019s Blade Will was extremely powerful. Just a scrape from it caused Xu Xiaoshou immense pain, and it left a coursing power behind in the wound, which made it difficult for the average person to recover from the wounds it inflicted.However, Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t display the terrifying regenerative capabilities of Eternal Vitality.2The passive skill would immediately activate whenever a wound opened on his body, and the Blade Will that an average person couldn\u2019t easily get rid of would be healed on the spot.Xu Xiaoshou was elated. He was in awe of the foundational passive skill. Its regenerative capabilities were top-notch.It was different for Zhou Tianshen. He was practically an immobile weapon. He didn\u2019t move an inch, yet he was able to force Xu Xiaoshou back with just a few strokes.\u201cHahaha, Xu Xiaoshou, you\u2019re out of moves, aren\u2019t you?!\u201cOnce the Nine Tides gets going, I, Zhou Tianshen, will be able to defeat even an Innate-stage fighter, much less you and your mere Acquired-stage Sword Will!\u201dThe Blade Will was completely overtaking Xu Xiaoshou, and he and his sword glows were about to be pushed out of the arena.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, hang in there!\u201d\u201cStand your ground! Fight back! You can\u2019t let him push you out of the arena like that!\u201d\u201cHng hng hng, he\u2019s already covered in blood. Xu Xiaoshou, aaahhhh! I feel so bad for him!\u201d\u201cXiaoshou, stop trying to hang on. Come into my arms. I can\u2019t take it any longer. Why is there so much blood?\u201d3Xu Xiaoshou was indeed covered in blood, but it only looked bad.He was trying his best to survive with as little damage as possible under the barrage of blade glows. Thus, the injuries all over his body weren\u2019t fatal, and they didn\u2019t affect his mobility.Furthermore, because Eternal Vitality was constantly activating, Xu Xiaoshou was practically in peak condition.As he used his sword techniques, Xu Xiaoshou turned into a hungry sponge. He made use of the attacks that Zhou Tianshen was sending at him to practice the techniques in his mind, and nearly instantly understood the sword techniques that he\u2019d never used in the past.Seeing that he was about to be pushed out of the arena, Xu Xiaoshou no longer hesitated. He exchanged his Passive Points for two Skill Points and used them on Sword Technique Expertise.\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 2).\u201d\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 3).\u201dIn that instant, his mind was flooded with boundless knowledge. Xu Xiaoshou roared and moved around the flurry of blade glows. With one strike, he swiped away all of the Blade Will, then sprung his sword once again.Boom!An explosion sounded, and the barrier buzzed. Zhou Tianshen was shaken and sent staggering backward, his face filled with shock.The crowd was confused. None of them understood what was going on.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, he\u2026 achieved a breakthrough?\u201d\u201cI think so. To think that he managed to retaliate while being beaten back by the powerful Blade Will. That last Sword Will looked like the second form of the White Cloud Sword Technique, Billowing Clouds!\u201d\u201cBut how do you explain the counterattack after he pulled his sword back? That wasn\u2019t the third stroke of the White Cloud Sword Technique.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 You\u2019re asking me, then who do I ask?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou had achieved a breakthrough. Di Xin\u2019er had taught him this attack.However, he\u2019d never succeeded at using the second stroke of the White Cloud Sword Technique. Just now, in the middle of a tense situation, he\u2019d managed to forcefully tweak the technique and push the White Cloud Sword Technique into a different direction.Even though he\u2019d been introduced to sword techniques with the Fleeting White Clouds, his current techniques were no longer that of the White Cloud Sword Technique.Xiao Qixiu looked startled. That Xu Xiaoshou managed to modify a sword technique with his Sword Will during battle?This wasn\u2019t even something that a master in the arts of the sword would dare to easily try, yet he\u2019d managed to battle like that just with his Sword Will?This was potential of unprecedented proportions!Xu Xiaoshou looked as though he\u2019d been bathed in blood. His clothes had been torn to shreds, revealing his already red body. Even his hair was covered in blood.Even so, he cracked a smile and lifted his sword in invitation. \u201cJunior Zhou, can you go faster? Don\u2019t stop!\u201d3Zhou Tianshen was still angry and in shock from his Nine Tides being countered, and his expression turned fierce when he heard Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s words. He lifted his blade and laughed.\u201cI was thinking the same thing!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29As he said this, the Blade Will that had been ravaging the surroundings was absorbed into his golden domineering blade. Zhou Tianshen loosened his grip, and the domineering blade trembled as it emitted an incandescent brilliance.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s pupils dilated. \u201cThis guy still has some moves up his sleeve?\u201d1He grabbed Hiding Pain, and the once unrestrained ninth-grade spiritual sword whimpered, looking incredibly indignant.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened. He knew his Sword Will\u2019s current level wasn\u2019t high enough for him to be able to withstand Zhou Tianshen\u2019s attacks.Without hesitation, he once again exchanged his Passive Points for three more Skill Points and used them all on the Sword Technique Expertise.\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 6).\u201dIn an instant, his mind was flooded with knowledge once again. He looked at the golden domineering blade Zhou Tianshen was loosely holding in his hand and seemed to understand something.The next second, Xu Xiaoshou slowly gathered his Sword Will back into Hiding Pain, and he loosened his grip as it absorbed the boundless Sword Will into its blade.Zhou Tianshen was confused.The crowd was also dumbfounded when they saw the two candidates get into identical stances.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Xu Xiaoshou also knows Zhou Tianshen\u2019s blade technique?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? Isn\u2019t the move Zhou Tianshen\u2019s using the opening strike of the Innate-stage spiritual technique \u2018Deity Mountain-Lifting Technique,\u2019 so how could Xu Xiaoshou know it?\u201d\u201cCould he be learning the technique on the spot? My God, that\u2019s too creepy.\u201d\u201cLearning an Innate-stage spiritual technique on the spot? Are you kidding?\u201dXu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t know what blade technique Zhou Tianshen was using, and he also couldn\u2019t produce the golden incandescent light that Zhou Tianshen was releasing. However, Zhou Tianshen\u2019s form did give him a stroke of inspiration for his newest attack\u2026\u201cFleeting White Cloud, Two!\u201d\u201cDeity Mountain Lifting Technique!\u201dThe two of them raised their weapons at the same time. As Zhou Tianshen raised his blade, he released a several-meters-tall golden blade glow. It pulsed with murderous intentions and directly ripped the arena apart as it slashed toward Xu Xiaoshou. There was nowhere for Xu Xiaoshou to run.Strangely, Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t release anything when he raised his sword, as if he were merely moving it through the air.The spectators\u2019 jaws dropped, and Xiao Qixiu felt his heart miss a beat.\u201cYou put on such an act for so long only to move your sword?\u201d he thought.2\u201cYou\u2019re going to die!\u201dHe instinctively wanted to charge forward, but then he saw Xu Xiaoshou move his sword slightly when faced with the golden blade glow.He slowly pulled Hiding Pain backward, and a powerful suction transformed the air into a vortex of clouds. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword had casually pulled the lethal golden light to the side.It wasn\u2019t over. Xu Xiaoshou turned and sent the golden light flying back at his opponent.1Zhou Tianshen was dumbfounded. \u201cWhat kind of sorcery is this?\u201d he thought. \u201cTo think that he managed to send my Innate-stage spiritual technique flying back at me!2His technique had almost depleted all of his spiritual strength, so he had no choice but to forcefully release another one of those attacks again. He dispelled the terrifying onslaught of the Deity Mountain-Lifting Technique with an attack of similar power.The two golden glows clashed and made a loud explosion as they turned into countless golden scales and fell to the ground. Amidst the beautiful scene of falling gold, a figure moved toward Zhou Tianshen with his sword in hand.Zhou Tianshen could no longer care about the battle. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword technique was poetic, and there were no openings in his attack.Such a divine sword technique shocked him. It was just as good as the techniques used by his grandfather, who had brought him onto the path of the swordsman when young.\u201cA sword can be used like that?\u201d\u201cWhat about a blade?\u201dHe lapsed into deep thought and forgot that he was in the middle of a battle.Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to forcefully stop his attack. His black sword stopped right before Zhou Tianshen\u2019s forehead. Even so, he still didn\u2019t have full control over his Sword Will. It slightly pierced his opponent\u2019s forehead, causing him to bleed.Zhou Tianshen was still lost in thought!Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. \u201cThis is a battle. Please show your opponent some respect, will you?\u201d he thought.He moved to put away his sword when an immense spiritual strength suddenly rose around Zhou Tianshen\u2019s body and pushed him away.Everyone looked at the sky in shock. An infinite amount of spiritual strength was billowing into the arena and entering Zhou Tianshen\u2019s body. The sound was grand. It sounded like a deity was murmuring into their ears, and it made everyone more alert.\u201cHah!\u201dZhou Tianshen abruptly opened his eyes. His aura had risen from Spiritual Cultivation Level Ten to the Innate-stage, and with his shout, his Blade Will shot into the surroundings and shattered the barrier around the arena.Xu Xiaoshou crawled on the ground, dazed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he wondered. \u201cHe broke through to the Innate-stage while we were fighting?\u201cYou cheated, didn\u2019t you?!\u201dBut he didn\u2019t have time to think about it, and immediately stood up. Zhou Tianshen was already terrifying at Acquired-stage Level Ten. How powerful would he be now that he\u2019d stepped into the Innate-stage?Unexpectedly, Zhou Tianshen put away his sword after shouting and said respectfully, \u201cThank you for holding back, Senior Xu. I was too rash. I could tell that you were a gentleman when you pulled your sword back just now!\u201dXiao Qixiu came to his senses and immediately waved his hand. \u201cThe battle is over. Xu Xiaoshou is the winner!\u201d1Naturally, he knew that Zhou Tianshen wouldn\u2019t have survived, much less achieve a breakthrough, if Xu Xiaoshou hadn\u2019t pulled his sword back just now.Of course, with him keeping an eye on things, that tragedy wouldn\u2019t have happened.2However, victories and defeats are just that\u2014victories and defeats. In a real battle, there was no way an enemy would allow their opponent to achieve a breakthrough. This battle had ended the moment Xu Xiaoshou pulled his sword back.Xu Xiaoshou held his black sword behind his back and smiled. He didn\u2019t comment on what Zhou Tianshen\u2019s said.Zhou Tianshen\u2019s face was red. Before the battle, he\u2019d boldly said that Xu Xiaoshou was a merciless man, and in the end, he was spared by the \u201cmerciless\u201d Xu Xiaoshou. It was undoubtedly a great irony.\u201cGreat!\u201d His eyes flitted around, and he voiced the first thought that came to mind. He nodded heavily at Xu Xiaoshou and said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided. I, Zhou Tianshen, will definitely have you for a friend!\u201d5Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and left the arena. He didn\u2019t want to say anything more to this man with a one-track mind.This battle was the most difficult one he\u2019d had so far in the competition. The battle with Liu Zhen was difficult too, but this battle with Zhou Tianshen was different in the sense that he\u2019d managed to get more out of it.1This was especially so for the cherry on top at the end that was the Fleeting White Cloud Two. Xu Xiaoshou hadn\u2019t even had the time to give the technique a name.It had appeared just like that after his stroke of inspiration, and he\u2019d used it like that. His becoming one with his sword, technique, and will was rather miraculous.1It was as though everything were fated. It was a comfortable feeling.Even he himself was shocked when he\u2019d used the technique. He had to quickly head back home to mull it over.Zhou Tianshen had broken through to the Innate-stage and destroyed the barrier, and Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s notification panel was refreshing like crazy. However, Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t care about these things. All he wanted to do was go over his sword technique.The spectators gave a thunderous applause. Some admired Xu Xiaoshou, some were shocked, however, most of them felt bad for Zhou Tianshen.Everyone in the arena was considering the possibility that the outcome of the competition might\u2019ve been completely different if Zhou Tianshen had managed to come to his senses earlier.The only exception was chief judge Xiao Qixiu. He froze as he watched Xu Xiaoshou leave, unable to say a word.He had announced the end of the competition a little too late just now not because he was waiting for Zhou Tianshen to admit defeat, but because he was truly startled by Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword technique.It was poetic. It was the sword technique of a deity!He had abandoned all thought of spiritual techniques and swordplay and battled purely with his Sword Will, taking his opponent\u2019s attacks with his reactions. Wasn\u2019t this form the most powerful form as described by the Eighth Sword Deity?His eyes were filled with shock. Perhaps even Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t realize just how terrifying battling only with Sword Will really was.However, he did. He saw the makings of someone who would slowly rise to become the most powerful swordsman.3He waved his arms to get the crowd to calm down and activated the screen once again.\u201cThe competition continues!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Goose Lake.Willows surrounded the area, and dense spiritual strength occupied the surroundings.Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t blindly wander around here this time. He held his sword in his hand and closely examined the surroundings. He wanted to meet the old man with the straw hat and dark circles under his eyes again.He was going to make that promise a reality if he saw that old man again.However, unfortunately, he didn\u2019t manage to meet that old man, even after nightfall.Goose Lake was a quiet place and was suitable for training. While he was waiting, Xu Xiaoshou reflected on his insights from using the sword technique in the afternoon.After the appearance of Sword Technique Expertise, his talent for the way of the sword and his understanding of it had been forcibly raised by several levels. At such a high level, his potential for sword techniques also seemed to increase as the level of the passive skill increased.He realized many things after calming down.For example, he\u2019d noticed many openings in his opponent\u2019s sword technique during his battle with Di Xin\u2019er. Back then, he thought that Di Xin\u2019er wasn\u2019t skilled in the way of the sword. However, now that he thought about it, it might\u2019ve been him whose standards had far exceeded that of an average person.Only that person with a one-track mind, uhh, Zhou Tianshen, who had also learned the Acquired-stage Blade Will, could pressure him in these realms that their wills created.Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t have a mentor, so he could only mull over the technique and use his past experiences to understand Sword Will. However, the more he thought about it, the more he felt that purely battling with Sword Will seemed more reasonable and natural than fighting with a spiritual technique.He stroked his chin and slipped into deep thought.\u201cHm\u2026 It was probably an illusion. After all, I only know the first form of the White Cloud Sword Technique, so how could I determine which of the two approaches is stronger!\u201dHe quickly abandoned the thought, even though it had overwhelming potential. He might have continued his research in that direction if a powerful swordsman had come to address his doubts.However, he clearly didn\u2019t have that kind of opportunity.In his dantian, the Infernal Fire Seed was like a suspended sun. It roasted his energy reserves until they were blazing red. In just a day, Xu Xiaoshou felt as though his spiritual strength had been ravaged beyond repair.His scorching spiritual strength would sever his meridians every time he activated it.It was like that even for him, who had an Innate-stage Physical Body. A person with an ordinary body would\u2019ve died within a few seconds if he\u2019d consumed the Infernal Fire Seed.Correspondingly, his offensive capabilities had gotten much stronger. However, he had to injure himself to injure the enemy.\u201cI have to refine this item completely. Otherwise, my cultivation level will be destroyed, even if my physical body is fine with the help of Eternal Vitality,\u201d he thought to himself.He glanced into his mind. Passive Points: 27899.He had used 5000 Passive Points to upgrade Sword Technique Expertise during his battle with Zhou Tianshen in the afternoon, making his reserves dip to 5000 points.4However, after being roasted for three more hours, his Passive Points had once again skyrocketed to over 20000 points. Of course, the passionate crowd had also contributed some of these Passive Points.1The increase in Passive Points was naturally a good thing. However, the feeling of being burned from the inside out was excruciating. Xu Xiaoshou would rather head into the arena and get beaten up by 100 people for half a day than continue feeling like this.Furthermore, he didn\u2019t know what kind of threat this item would have now that it was above his energy reserve.\u201cThat detestable old man\u2026\u201dHe was determined. He was going to fully refine this item tonight.Xu Xiaoshou took out two Red Gold Pills and pinched them in his hands. He thought about it, then purchased five Skill Points and threw them into the Breathing Technique.\u201cBreathing Technique (Acquired Lv. 6).\u201d9Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t notice any change, even after the Breathing Technique leveled-up five times.This was probably the only passive skill that didn\u2019t show any effects after it was upgraded.However, he still instinctively shuddered when he saw the notification. In terms of how scary each of the techniques was, he was most afraid of the Breathing Technique.Originally, he hadn\u2019t planned on upgrading the technique before reaching the Innate-stage. However, he was out of ideas. It\u2019d be bad if the effects of the Red Gold Pills weren\u2019t enough when he refined the Infernal Fire Seed later.Furthermore, his body had developed a resistance to the Red Gold Pills, as he\u2019d been taking the medicine like crazy recently and no longer got that much of a high from them. This was why he dared to raise the level of the Breathing Technique by five in one go.With these preparations made, Xu Xiaoshou tried to activate his spiritual strength for the first time to actively come into contact with the Infernal Fire Seed.Creak\u2026His spiritual strength swarmed up like a tide. However, the spiritual strength got burned when it encountered the immense heat from the Infernal Fire Seed, and only a shred was left by the time it passed it by. Xu Xiaoshou seized the opportunity and used this shred of spiritual energy to draw the energy trapped within the fire seed out.A scorching heat coursed through his body, and Xu Xiaoshou felt like he\u2019d been struck by lightning. He shivered. He\u2019d only drawn out a minute portion of the fire seed\u2019s energy, yet it instantly damaged his nerves and veins beyond recognition.The Eternal Vitality showed its prowess once again, and Xu Xiaoshou was immediately restored to his previous state and didn\u2019t have to use the Red Gold Pill that he\u2019d prepared.1Xu Xiaoshou was bleeding from every orifice and was in immense pain.He drew out the energy from the fire seed and refined it, paying the price for it with the pain he felt from his body being destroyed only to instantly recover. He fused the seed\u2019s energy with his energy reserve and felt his spiritual strength undergo a qualitative change.His ordinary spiritual strength seemed to have a little bit of a fire element to it now.He had a shred of elemental power that was unique to Innate-stage fighters even though he was only at the Acquired-stage. Wouldn\u2019t he be able to beat an Innate-stage fighter as an Acquired-stage fighter if he managed to fully refine the seed?Xu Xiaoshou slipped into deep thought.It seemed like the detestable old man had had good intentions when he got him to swallow this item. His abilities would drastically improve if he managed to refine the Infernal Fire Seed.7Xu Xiaoshou calmed himself down. He felt that the process of refining the seed was too slow!At this rate, it would take him more than two weeks to finally chip away at the Fire Seed.2He had been tortured by the item for the first half of the day. Now that he realized that he could refine the item, Xu Xiaoshou started to grumble about the speed of the process despite the pain.This person really had guts.He was actually able to remain silent, even though he was going through immeasurable pain during the refinement process, something an ordinary person wouldn\u2019t have been able to bear. He could actually clench his teeth and fight past the pain.\u201cHow can I increase the speed\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou touched the blood on his face and looked at the geese playing in the water. He mulled over the question for a while.He currently only had one way to refine the Infernal Fire Seed, which was to refine it using an ordinary training technique. The pain was ever-present, and its speed was extremely slow.However, he used the Breathing Technique during his day-to-day training as a substitute for the ordinary training technique.Since that was the case, could he refine the seed using the Breathing Technique?\u201cBreathing Technique\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou softly muttered to himself, suddenly having a stroke of inspiration.In the past, he\u2019d used this fundamental passive skill as a training technique and to heal his wounds. However, the technique hadn\u2019t introduced itself as a training technique but as the most fundamental passive skill.Perhaps there were other uses for the technique?\u201cBreathing Technique\u2026\u201cBreathing\u2026\u201cBreath\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou slapped himself on the head. If he took the name of the technique literally, his training and healing only required him to use the \u201cinhalation\u201d part of the Breathing Technique. He\u2019d never used the \u201cexhalation\u201d part of the technique.\u201cSince I can use the power of inhalation to breathe in the properties of medicine into my energy reserves, can I use the power of exhalation to expel the energy within the Infernal Fire Seed from my body?\u201d3Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by the idea. However, he felt that it was very possible.He might as well try it!He immediately adjusted his breathing. He took a deep breath and placed all of his attention on the Infernal Fire Seed. He imagined breathing normally, then held the thought of expelling the Infernal Fire Seed in his mind and let out a small breath.1Creak, creak, creak!An immense scorching energy was pulled out from the Infernal Fire Seed and expelled through his bronchial tubes and mouth. The energy passed through his body like lava, making his muscles feel like magma.Xu Xiaoshou immediately coughed out a mouthful of blood, and the scorching energy instantly spewed out of his nose and mouth. During the process, he felt as though his throat had melted, and he nearly died on the spot.1However, he had Eternal Vitality. He quickly picked up the Red Gold Pill in his hand and took a deep breath to stabilize his breathing.\u201cOh, f***!\u201dXu Xiaoshou became flustered a second after he finished taking a whiff of the pill.He saw the Red Gold Pill between his fingers suddenly transform into vapor, and the pure scorching energy that he\u2019d just released once again entered his body through his nose.Under the clear moonlight, on the other side of Goose Lake, the old man wearing a straw hat, who was sitting properly on a willow tree, trembled and nearly fell from his branch.1\u201cDoes that lad want to lose his life?\u201d2\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Half of his body felt like it was frozen in a vault of ice, while the other half felt like it was being dipped into a volcano.Comfort and pain assaulted him at the same time. While his body was being destroyed by the scorching energy, it was doubly restored by the effects of the Red Gold Pill and Eternal Vitality.The extreme energy of fire and ice intertwined as they entered his body. Xu Xiaoshou, who was merely the vessel of the energy, could only feel pain.2\u201cKekeke\u2026\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s teeth chattered. He had completely lost control over the energies. In fact, he could no longer control the Breathing Technique.The energies that were coursing within his body tore past his meridians and instantly entered his energy reserve. His energy reserve sizzled, threatening to rip apart. The pain was enough to make a person go insane.There was a charred smell in the surroundings. The grass Xu Xiaoshou was sitting on instantly died from the heat. Around him, the willow trees gradually changed from a tender green to yellow, then black, and the white jade railings around the lake were covered in a layer of soot.The plump geese ran around in fright, as if the water in the lake was about to cook them alive.In Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body, the scorching energy wanted to continue rampaging after it entered his energy reserves. However, the forceful activation of the Breathing Technique suppressed the scorching energy right after it had started burning again.Xu Xiaoshou took out another Red Gold Pill and took a deep breath. The high instantly suppressed his pain and quickly repaired his ravaged body.1Buzz!A red and gold ripple spread out into the surroundings, and the mud and grass around him were sent flying into the air. The willow trees bent and snapped, and some segments of the white jade railings exploded.Gurgle, gurgle.The water of Goose Lake was almost boiling. Bubbles rose to the surface, and dead fishes floated to the surface. The plump geese that had escaped the crisis gathered at a faraway corner, shivering.The old man wearing a straw hat flew into the air and quickly dived into Goose Lake.Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes. Cold sweat mixed with his blood was dripping down his body. He couldn\u2019t help but pat on his chest.\u201cI survived\u2026?\u201dThe Infernal Fire Seed had become much smaller with his one breath, and his cultivation level had also increased considerably from his original Spiritual Cultivation Level Seven.The scorching energy had been suppressed, and the injuries in his body were recovering at a visible rate. Xu Xiaoshou felt numb and limp.The terrifying regenerative capabilities of Eternal Vitality and the Red Gold Pill that the Red Gold Pill absorbed were being displayed to their fullest.1Xu Xiaoshou wiped off his blood and sweat and noticed that other than his haggard expression and drained energy, his condition was no different from that of an ordinary person.\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d\u201cThis regenerative capability is really strong!\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but shiver when he thought about the pain he\u2019d gone through just now.Above his energy reserve, the Infernal Fire Seed now looked rather indignant. It had gotten much smaller, and its rate of destruction had been completely suppressed by Eternal Vitality.Xu Xiaoshou took a few breaths of fresh air. Seeing that his body was gradually recovering, he clenched his teeth and sat up once again, a determined look in his eyes.So what if it\u2019s painful!He\u2019d been tortured in his previous life. Furthermore, even though this process was extremely painful, the pain was only temporary. Since it would become a threat sooner or later if he left it alone, he might as well tolerate the pain now and completely refine the seed tonight!4He took out a Spiritual Cultivation Pill and inhaled it in one breath, restoring himself to peak condition.With a ferocious look on his face, Xu Xiaoshou once again exhaled a large orb of red energy out of his nose and mouth. Even the air was rippling from the heat. Xu Xiaoshou swallowed the energy along with a Red Gold Pill.Under Goose Lake, the old man held onto his straw hat and looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock. Completely forgetting that he was underwater, he swallowed a few mouthfuls of water on accident.1He\u2019d had an experimental mindset when he first heard that there was a person with an Innate-stage physical body in the Outer Yard and forcibly made the young lad swallow the Infernal Fire Seed into his body.He might be able to create a fire-element genius if he succeeded. If not, it would only cost him a life if he failed. That was no big deal.8However, observing Xu Xiaoshou throughout the day had touched him a little.This person, who wasn\u2019t able to tolerate the pain from the start, had managed to forcefully suppress the pain just with Red Gold Pills later during the day and even get into the arena to battle.The crowd might mock him for taking drugs before the contest because his body was burned red, but he, a person who had also consumed the Infernal Fire Seed, knew how much pain this lad was hiding behind his smiles and jokes.Thus, when this lad tried to extort Xiao Qixiu, he\u2019d taken advantage of the opportunity and lent Xiao Qixiu ten bottles of the Red Gold Pills he\u2019d refined.1He was shocked by the training that the young man was now going through at Goose Lake under the moonlight. That young man had given up a little on refining the seed and was starting to devour the energy in large gulps.\u201cIs he not afraid of death?\u201d he thought.The old man wearing the straw hat couldn\u2019t tolerate it any longer and wanted to stop Xu Xiaoshou. However, he didn\u2019t expect that while he was flying over to him that Xu Xiaoshou would manage to use a unique technique and his immense willpower to fight through the first wave of pain.It didn\u2019t end there. He managed to sit up after just a few breaths\u2026He\u2019s going through it again!\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat kind of monster is he!\u201cDoes he not feel pain?\u201dThe old man was shocked and felt like he\u2019d unintentionally discovered a treasure. Just with his willpower alone, Xu Xiaoshou had immense potential.He was going to get Xu Xiaoshou as his disciple!5The explosions around Goose Lake naturally attracted the attention of the law enforcers from the Spiritual Law Division, and a group of black-robed men soon appeared around the lake.Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t even notice them.\u201cBack down!\u201d The old man suddenly flew out of the lake. His temperature rose and instantly evaporated the moisture on his body. He pressed down on his straw hat. His voice was a little raspy.The law enforcers stopped in their tracks and looked up to see a somewhat withered and ordinary figure under the clear, round moon.However, some of the law enforcers felt the faint scorching energy emanating from that person\u2019s body and were a little shocked.\u201cVice-dean?\u201d1\u201cElder Sang?\u201dThe people in front looked at each other. They didn\u2019t understand what was going on and were a little confused. \u201cWhen did he come\u2026\u201dThe law enforcer leading the group slapped the head of the person who said this, and the law enforcer lowered his head and obeyed the order, quickly leaving.\u201cYes!\u201dThe people behind quickly followed the command, and all of the law enforcers disappeared in a flash.Elder Sang took off his straw hat and stood atop the white jade railings.The night wind ruffled his creased shirt and blew away the few strands of withered grass on his head. The plump geese gathered under his feet and cackled, desperately searching for a sense of safety.However, there was only one man in his large, black eyes.\u201cHah!\u201dElder Sang smiled. It was impossible to know what he was thinking.There was destined to be no peace at Goose Lake that night, and the white jade railing was in desperate need of repair.Because\u2026 the scorching waves that were coming from the young man\u2019s body in the distance had extraordinary destructive capabilities.Boom!Boom!Boom!\u2026Noon the next day the disciples of the Outer Yard lethargically entered the spectator seats.\u201cDarn it, were they renovating the spirit palace last night? The explosions were so noisy. Did you guys hear it?\u201d\u201cIt came from the direction of Goose Lake, right? My yard is near the area. It was extremely noisy. If not for the fact that nothing happened, I\u2019d have thought an enemy had infiltrated the spirit palace.\u201d1\u201cWhat noise? My yard is also near Goose Lake!\u201d\u201cHow did you not hear it? Are you deaf?\u201d\u201cOh, oh, sorry. Now that I think about it, I have a soundproof barrier at home. Sigh, it can\u2019t be helped that I\u2019m rich.\u201d6\u201c\u2026 F*** you!\u201d2Xu Xiaoshou also entered the Chuyun Platform with dark circles under his eyes, looking like another victim of the noise. No one knew that this person was the true culprit.He hurriedly entered the waiting area and finally managed to feel at ease.On an average day, his training usually consisted of sleeping in his yard. He didn\u2019t have to worry about the noise he made disrupting his neighbors because of his soundproof barrier.\u201cHowever, this method instantly backfired when I trained at Goose Lake,\u201d he thought. \u201cI wonder if the noise I made affected my opponent or not\u2026\u201cIf so, that would be great!\u201dThe Infernal Seed had completely disappeared after his full night of refinement, and his cultivation level had also reached the peak of Level Seven.1He could advance if he wanted, but there was no need to.1Through the constant burning, Xu Xiaoshou had even managed to repeatedly consolidate what he\u2019d learned from his past levels.Now that he thought back on it, move people would\u2019ve been moved by the process.2Xiao Qixiu continued the advancement matches for the top 16 candidates as if nothing had happened. Xu Xiaoshou gave the attendant a few instructions, then started to doze off.\u201cI\u2019m so tired!\u201d he thought.He normally trained by breathing in his sleep. However, he\u2019d gone two consecutive days without sleeping. He wasn\u2019t used to it.1He soon fell asleep. In his dreams, an attendant was running toward him with two bottles in his hands. The attendant slapped him on both his cheeks.2\u201cSlap!\u201d\u201cWake up. It\u2019s your turn!\u201d2Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32\u201cGot shocked. Passive Points +1.\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou abruptly sprang up, looked around, and realized that he was in the waiting area. He touched his face and looked indignantly at the attendant. \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201dThe attendant gave him an innocent look, and then gradually started to look confused.Xu Xiaoshou looked at the attendant\u2019s hand. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no pill bottles?\u201d he thought.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to battle!\u201d the attendant said coldly.Only then did Xu Xiaoshou realize that he\u2019d been dreaming before and embarrassedly walked out of the waiting area.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, good luck!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, hang in there!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, champion!\u201dHe was shocked by the crowd\u2019s cheers. The moment he walked out of the waiting area, he saw the entire crowd standing and cheering for him.He froze. Of course, some people had cheered for him in the past, but a lot of people had put him down too. \u201cWhy is everyone cheering so hard for me today?\u201d he thought.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even sleep well\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know that his consecutive victories over the rank-seven Wen Chong and the rank-four Zhou Tianshen, as well as his Acquired-stage Sword Will and Innate-stage physical body, had made him the favorite to win the entire competition.\u201cGot encouraged. Passive Points +442.\u201d\u201cGot cheered for. Passive Points +665.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe notification panel in his mind constantly refreshed, and Xu Xiaoshou happily waved his hands and slowly made his way into the arena.\u201cPassive Points: 44820.\u201d1\u201cPassive Points: 45611.\u201d\u201cPassive Points: 46002.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was smiling so wide that his eyes had narrowed to slits. Even though the process of refining the Infernal Fire Seed last night was arduous, he\u2019d been greatly rewarded for it in the last few hours. It had given him nearly 20000 Passive Points.And his Passive Points were still rising.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, walk faster!\u201d Xiao Qixiu said in an unfriendly tone.Xu Xiaoshou immediately quickened his footsteps, and when he entered the barrier, it was silent and peaceful.He now had a good idea why a barrier was needed during the Windcloud Competition.On the other side of the arena was a girl wearing a pale yellow dress who looked rather delicate. She had a tightly-combed head of hair, and the corners of her eyes were curved upward. She was wielding a soft bone whip and was striking it against the ground with every step she took. She looked extremely energetic.3Li Cenjing, Spiritual Cultivation Level Ten.As usual, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say something, but he didn\u2019t expect the young lady to interrupt him. She said mischievously, \u201cGiving up before the battle is a great disrespect to your opponent. Running away without battling\u20263\u201cOh, what comes after that\u2026\u201cForget it.\u201dLi Cenjing curled up her soft bone whip and tapped her head as she said, \u201cXu Xiaoshou, I\u2019ve seen you battle. You are very impressive!\u201cCan I get your autograph later?\u201d3\u201cGot admired. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou rubbed a hand over his head, embarrassed. He didn\u2019t expect there to be a fan amongst his opponents. He quickly swallowed the sarcastic comment that he\u2019d been about to say and nodded in agreement.Li Cenjing\u2019s expression immediately turned cheerful, and she chuckled.Xiao Qixiu expressionlessly waved his hand. \u201cBattle, start!\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou played the gentleman and signaled for his opponent to attack him first. He didn\u2019t expect Li Cenjing to raise her hand and blink her large eyes.\u201cI admit defeat!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cYou stole my line just now, and now you\u2019re going to admit defeat?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat kind of fan are you? Don\u2019t you know what I really need is Passive Points?\u201dLi Cenjing saw the change in his expression and quickly explained, \u201cZhang Fei is still lying down in the Spiritual Medical Division and can\u2019t even fight in the placement battles. I don\u2019t want to fight you. I want to fight in the placement battles!\u201dXiao Qixiu didn\u2019t even have time to finish swallowing the mouthful of water in his mouth. He hurriedly raised his hand and announced, \u201cThe battle is over. Xu Xiaoshou is the victor!\u201dThe spectators instantly started murmuring amongst themselves. They hadn\u2019t expected someone to give up during a top-16 battle. Wasn\u2019t that the same as giving up on the rewards that were to come?\u201cHow boring. Why didn\u2019t she fight properly? I wanted to see Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s performance!\u201d\u201cI think Li Cenjing is rather wise. She\u2019s only Level Ten. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat the Level Seven Xu Xiaoshou. Conserving her strength now for the placement matches later is quite smart.\u201d\u201cPuu, listen to the nonsense you\u2019re spouting\u2026\u201dLi Cenjing, who\u2019d just admitted defeat, scampered over to Xu Xiaoshou and handed him a spiritual pen. \u201cAutograph!\u201d she said excitedly.1Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cHuff!\u201cHold it in, she\u2019s a fan!\u201d he warned himself.\u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s said gently.Li Cenjing generously extended her hand with her palm facing upward. Her fingers were slender. She said, \u201cOh, here!\u201dShe deviously glanced in the direction of the spectator seats. The crowd seemed to be in an uproar, but the two of them couldn\u2019t hear anything in the arena.Outside, a girl sitting in a front-row seat was manically roaring, \u201cStop it right there, Li Cenjing! Xu Xiaoshou is mine!\u201d1\u201cKekeke!\u201dLi Cenjing shot her friend an ugly look, a smug expression on her face. \u201cHmph, see what happens when you don\u2019t train properly?\u201d she thought. \u201cAll you can do is stay outside and be envious of me.Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t shy. He grabbed her hand. It was soft and warm.He finished his autograph in a few strokes and said, \u201cDon\u2019t admit defeat when you encounter anyone else in the future. It\u2019s very disadvantageous.\u201d1\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s not disadvantageous.\u201dEven though Li Cenjing was usually rather brazen, she couldn\u2019t help but blush when Xu Xiaoshou grabbed her hand in front of all these spectators. She was, after all, only a 16 to 17-year-old teenage girl.6The numb, itchy feeling his skin gave her almost made her pull her hand back, but she fought the impulse and answered softly, \u201cThank you!\u201dThe young lady turned to run after she got the autograph, as if she were escaping.\u201cHey, your spiritual pen\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou immediately called out.3The young lady didn\u2019t even look back. \u201cYou can have it!\u201dXu Xiaoshou glanced at Xiao Qixiu. The middle-aged man was repeatedly shaking his head, his eyes filled with emotion as he thought back on past memories. He didn\u2019t even rush Xu Xiaoshou out of the arena.1All Xu Xiaoshou could do was put the spiritual pen in the ring hanging around his neck.Outside, the girl sitting in the front-row seat went crazy when she saw this. She rushed toward Li Cenjing, who\u2019d just gotten out of the arena, with red eyes. Even the attendants couldn\u2019t stop her in time.\u201cLi Cenjing, today is your death day!\u201d\u201cLook at my otherworldly flying kick!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t. Look, are you still going to kick me?\u201d\u201cHng hng hng, I\u2019m so envious. Chop off your hand and give it to me!\u201d2\u201c\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou walked out of the barrier and glanced at the notification panel. He couldn\u2019t help but feel faint.\u201cGot despised. Passive Points +333.\u201d\u201cGot despised. Passive Points +333.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought.\u201cEven though no blood was drawn, shouldn\u2019t they be praising and encouraging me for winning the battle?\u201cWhat happened to all of you? You were still cheering me on before I got into the arena, and then the next instant you dislike me?\u201cHeh, humans!\u201dXu Xiaoshou forced a smile onto his face and waved at the crowd in an attempt to salvage the situation.\u201cGot despised. Passive Points +886.\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.In the waiting area.Xu Xiaoshou squatted on the resting chair. The atmosphere outside was intense. He could no longer sleep.At this point in the competition, he\u2019d already successfully placed in the top eight.According to the schedule, he still had one battle to fight today, and if he was victorious, he would compete for the championship tomorrow.\u201cWill I become champion\u2026\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t so sure.He might\u2019ve felt more confident of becoming champion if he hadn\u2019t encountered Zhou Tianshen yesterday. Zhou Tianshen, who was at the peak of the Acquired-stage, already had such terrifying battle capabilities, so there was no telling how strong the Innate-stage fighters would be.Xu Xiaoshou twirled the cup in his hands, a little dazed.The Innate Stage was a general title.It consisted of three levels: Origin Court, Occupied Void, and Upper Spirit.After the first ten levels of the Spiritual Cultivation process, a Spiritual Cultivator would gain an understanding of the natural laws and open up an Origin Court near where the deities resided. If successful, they would awaken their Innate Elemental Power. That was the Innate-stage.As for what the Innate Elemental Power was exactly, there was an infinite variety of them, and they differed from person to person.It could be one of the five basic elements, or it could be a concept. For example, the stream of ice that Zhao Qingteng conjured with his sword, or Zhou Tianshen\u2019s Blade Will\u2026What Xu Xiaoshou was afraid of most was this:Even though his passive skills could be used as Innate-stage Spiritual Techniques, they had their limitations.At the very least, he didn\u2019t have the Innate Elemental Power, which meant he didn\u2019t have a strong guarantee to win compared to the true favorites to win the competition.Xu Xiaoshou looked at his energy reserve and couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly.The spiritual strength in his energy reserve was pitch-black and saturated with scorching energy. This was the reward he\u2019d gotten from fighting for his life yesterday night. However, it was still lacking compared to a real Innate Elemental Power.\u201cSigh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou let out a frustrated sigh. He had wanted to use his strength to achieve the top spot during this competition. Now, it looked like his dream was too unrealistic.He looked into his mind again.\u201cPassive Points: 48226.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Xu Xiaoshou currently had five Passive Skills, three of which had reached the Innate-stage. The remaining two were at Level Six and could be leveled-up.If he set aside 10000 Passive Points to have a reserve, he\u2019d still have a whopping 38000 Passive Points that he could use.He had obtained three Passive Keys when he got Eternal Vitality. Thus, Xu Xiaoshou purchased seven keys, intending to make ten consecutive draws with the wheel.He put his palms together and silently prayed for good fortune.The red wheel in the merchant interface was still covered in fog. Xu Xiaoshou placed the keys into the slot one by one.He hesitated a moment, then decided to shout as usual, \u201cRNGesus, bless me!\u201d3Bad luck can be reversed with rituals!This was something Xu Xiaoshou had always believed in.The two attendants in the waiting room heard Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s shout and looked at each other at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s here again!\u201dThe two of them went to the corner, and one of them squatted while the other stood. They silently observed Xu Xiaoshou with looks of curiosity.The squatting attendant hit the attendant above him with his head. \u201cGo prepare the resuscitation equipment.\u201d1\u201cWait, let me have a look too!\u201d\u201cQuickly, what if something happens later?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was squatting on the rest chair, and his gaze fell on the notification panel.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201dThump!Behind the wall, the two attendants looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who seemed petrified in his praying state, fall headfirst onto the ground. They both looked like they\u2019d expected this to happen.The standing attendant immediately turned to retrieve the medicine and equipment, while the other attendant immediately rushed out. While he ran, he thought about whether mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was needed here or not.Xu Xiaoshou, who had fallen to the ground, suddenly turned his head to look at them. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe two attendants pouted and slipped into a daze. The attendant who had put on heatproof gloves and had two bottles of medicine in his hands stopped in his tracks.\u201cYou\u2019re fine?\u201d the two attendants exclaimed in shock.\u201cHehe, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201dXu Xiaoshou laughed coldly. It was getting harder and harder to get anything from the system. He\u2019d been prepared for this. At least this time he didn\u2019t faint from shock.He waved his arm at the two attendants and said, \u201cYou\u2019re making a mountain out of a molehill. Go back first!\u201d\u201cOh, okay!\u201dThe two attendants turned back to look at Xu Xiaoshou every three steps. \u201cHis body doesn\u2019t seem warm today,\u201d they whispered to each other. \u201cSo there\u2019s probably no need to wear heatproof gloves.\u201d1\u201cWho knows. You should keep them on.\u201dXu Xiaoshou watched the two attendants disappear behind the wall, and his expression immediately twisted. He abruptly clutched his heart.\u201cIt\u2019s toying with me!\u201cThis broken system. That\u2019s another 10000 Passive Points down the drain.\u201d1Even though he\u2019d been prepared for the outcome, it still fazed him, as it would anyone.\u201cHehe, two keys for 10000 Passive Points\u2026\u201dHe remembered that the first time he spun the wheel, he\u2019d gotten Sharpness and another key with just three keys, but now?Hmph!Xu Xiaoshou once again purchased eight keys to make it a nice round number, then stabbed one of the keys fiercely into the red wheel\u2019s hole.There are still nine keys\u2026Stab it in again!Continue\u2026\u201cHah! RNGesus bless me!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou roared in fury. He looked furiously at the notification panel, as if concentrating harder would give him better items.\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cObtained Extended Passive Skill: Sense!\u201d5\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201dWith a boom, the rest chair he was sitting on was instantly crushed. Xu Xiaoshou was so excited he lost control of his Innate-stage physical body and hit his head on the ceiling.\u201cIt feels good\u2026 Urgh!\u201dPieces of wooden shrapnel fell onto the ground, and Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face crashed into the ceiling.The two attendants behind the wall looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was propping his hands against the ceiling and trying his best to pull his head out of the hole he\u2019d created, and glanced at each other.1\u201cHe\u2019s generous, but he\u2019s definitely sick in the head.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cAfter all, we took the medicine from him. Let\u2019s repair the chair and the ceiling later. We don\u2019t need him to pay.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cSigh, he\u2019s a decent man. What a pity he\u2019s only half useful\u2026\u201d1\u201cYes, yes!\u201d12Xu Xiaoshou was halfway through pulling his head out of the ceiling when he suddenly stopped moving. The two attendants behind the wall became a little anxious.\u201cHe can\u2019t pull it out?\u201d they thought. \u201cDoes he need help?\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou could naturally pull his head out of the ceiling if he wanted to. He only froze because even though he couldn\u2019t see anything with his head stuck inside the wood, he\u2019d managed to 'see\u201d the two anxious figures of the attendants behind the wall.1More accurately, the faint outline of every figure within a several-mile-radius had appeared inside his mind.5Xu Xiaoshou could even discern the emotions of these two people.This was\u2026\u201cSense!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was elated. This passive skill was too powerful. He could conjure the image of his surroundings in his mind. Not only would this prevent his enemies from assassinating him, but he\u2019d even be able to peep on young girls\u202616Cough, cough.It\u2019s a great technique!\u201cCan you come down?\u201d a concerned voice questioned from below.2The hazy image in his mind told him that the attendants had brought a ladder over. Xu Xiaoshou nearly fainted. This was a trivial matter. Why did they have to bring a ladder?He quickly pulled his head out of the ceiling and jumped down. Then, he waved his hand to signal that they didn\u2019t need to go through all that trouble.The two attendants sighed, feeling exhausted.They\u2019d never encountered such a weird candidate before. He would have bouts of insanity and mutilate himself. He would jump around. He had every devious technique imaginable in his arsenal, and frequently showed off his antics.1The two of them had silently brought out the ladder, and now they were silently taking the ladder back. It was as if they\u2019d lost the ability to talk.\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +2.\u201dXu Xiaoshou hit his head. \u201cThere\u2019s only the two of you here,\u201d he thought. \u201cDo you have to be so obvious?\u201dHe found another chair and squatted on it, then immediately purchased ten Skill Points and used them all on Sense.\u201cSense (Acquired Lv. 2).\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d5\u201cSense (Innate Lv. 1).\u201dThe visual range in his mind expanded to nearly ten meters. This was decent. What shocked Xu Xiaoshou even more was that the image had become much clearer.6Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes, and the formerly mosaic-like image became much clearer. He could even clearly see the two squirmish attendant\u2019s heads against the wall behind him.1Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned around and looked them in the eye.\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cClank!\u201dThe two attendants abruptly pulled their heads back and accidentally knocked each other. They toppled the teapot on the table and whispered to each other in shock, \u201cDoes this Xu Xiaoshou have eyes on the back of his head?\u201d\u201cDarn it, that scared me to death. How did he know that we were looking at him?\u201d\u201cShhh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was startled. Whatever the two attendants were doing and saying\u2026 It was all presented clearly in his mind!In the past, he would\u2019ve noticed the two attendants spying on him. However, he wouldn\u2019t have heard what they were talking about or seen their movements.This situation was akin to him having a surveillance camera in the back of his head that could present the image directly into his mind.2\u201cMy God!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said, as if he\u2019d seen Wen Chong launching another surprise attack on him. However, this time he wouldn\u2019t need to turn his head around. He could just directly kick his foot backward and tear his opponent into two with his Innate-stage Sharpness.3\u201cIt\u2019s another sinister technique\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was very excited.His Passive Points had reduced by 20000 in an instant, but he still had 20000 points left. He clenched his teeth and decided to go all out and purchased nine keys.Along with the key he\u2019d gotten previously, he now had 10 keys left!\u201cI\u2019ve never tried spinning the wheel again after obtaining something. What if I get consecutive skills\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou calmed down his wildly beating heart and carefully slotted the keys into the red wheel.\u201cHah! RNGesus bless me!\u201dMake it rain even harder than last time!\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cBetter luck next time!\u201d\u201cOne extra key!\u201dBoom!Clank!\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe teacups in the two attendants\u2019 hands trembled from the deafening roar behind the wall and almost spilled over.The two of them looked at each other and gulped down their tea. They moved quickly.One of them put on the gloves again and grabbed the medicine. The other pouted as he put up three fingers\u2026Two!One!\u201cCharge!\u201d\u201cSpeed!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s acting up again. Secure him!\u201dThe next second, another fearful voice rang out, \u201cOh f***! What are you guys doing?\u201d\u201cF*** you, shut up!\u201d1\u201cUrgh\u2026\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Xu Xiaoshou was washing his hands.If he hadn\u2019t clasped a hand to his mouth at the critical moment, he would\u2019ve had his first kiss in this life.1\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +2.\u201d\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +2.\u201dThe two attendants were grabbing their bellies and rolling around on the ground in pain. They\u2019d both been kicked by Xu Xiaoshou, and it definitely did not feel good.Of course, these two people, whose bright idea had been to bring a ladder over to try and save him, had limited cultivation levels, so Xu Xiaoshou knew to hold back.Boom!At this moment, an explosion was heard from the main arena. A spiritual tree had crashed through the barrier and was growing toward the sky. It tossed a muscular figure out of the arena.2\u201cThe battle is over, Mu Zixi is victorious!\u201dThe crowd was in an uproar. The sudden rapid growth of a spiritual tree had shocked them.\u201cOh! My honey, that\u2019s too incredible! Inn\u2026 Innate?\u201d1\u201cTo think that Junior Mu is also an Innate-stage fighter. She\u2019s only been in the spirit palace for a year, right? And these are the abilities of someone who\u2019s just entered the Windcloud Competition for the first time?\u201d\u201cGenius\u2026 No, demon!\u201d\u201cRen Chong is so pitiful. He\u2019s Level Ten and has a Lesser Forged Body, but can only end his journey in the top eight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so tall, he must\u2019ve been sent flying ten meters up\u2026 Oh f***, Ren Chong is falling. There\u2019s someone on the ground right where he\u2019s going to fall. Is that\u2026 Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d1\u201cCareful!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was gently rubbing the back of his palm to get rid of the stains when a black dot suddenly barged into his mind that\u2026 seemed to be coming from the sky?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought.To think that it destroyed the mini barrier around the waiting room!\u201cGot ambushed. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou cackled. He was no longer the Xu Xiaoshou of the past.With a backhand grab, Xu Xiaoshou grabbed onto something that felt like a watermelon. It was also a little spiky. He took a closer look at what he\u2019d caught\u20261Oh f***!It was a human head!Xu Xiaoshou was startled. He quickly loosened his grip and reflexively struck it with his knee.Boom!A dull thud rang out, and Ren Chong was once again sent flying high up into the air. This time, Xu Xiaoshou had forgotten to hold back and might have even used more force because of his shock.The crowd helplessly looked on as Ren Chong fell from heaven to hell, then from hell back to the mortal world before slamming onto the ground and spitting out a mouthful of blood. The crowd burst out laughing.\u201cHaha, I can\u2019t take it anymore. Why did Ren Chong run into Xu Xiaoshou of all people? What kind of sins did he commit in the past? Xu Xiaoshou has an Innate-stage physical body. Wouldn\u2019t getting kneed by Xu Xiaoshou break all of his ribs?\u201d2\u201cWhat a pitiful man. He was beaten up twice in one battle.\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2019s reaction time was great just now. It looks like he learned a retaliation technique after getting ambushed by Boss Wen the last time. He can pierce a person\u2019s heart or grab their head now. Tsk tsk!\u201dThe spectators were chattering amongst themselves, and Xu Xiaoshou gained a few Passive Points now that the barrier had been broken.\u201cGot admired. Passive Points +32.\u201d4\u201cGot praised. Passive Points +17.\u201dMedical personnel quickly ran past Xu Xiaoshou. They didn\u2019t forget to glare at him before leaving, as if he were the one who\u2019d made Ren Chong faint.\u201cGot despised. Passive Points +4.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt indignant. He\u2019d been in the middle of washing his hands, and then trouble fell toward him from the sky. Who knew that it was a man!It was lucky he didn\u2019t crush the watermelon in his hands just now.\u201cGot hated. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot hated. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot hated. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe notification panel was updated with a few lines, and Xu Xiaoshou became a little confused. He only gained one point with every notification. This rapid refresh rate\u2026He abruptly looked in the direction Ren Chong had fallen. Indeed, Ren Chong had been resuscitated by the medical attendants and was glaring at him, a spiteful look on his face.\u201cOh wow!\u201d he thought.\u201cYou were sent flying out of the arena and even tried to ambush me, and now you\u2019re blaming me?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened. He flicked off the water on his hands and quickly walked over to him.\u201cGot suspected. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot suspected. Passive Points +1.\u201dRen Chong\u2019s gaze started to waver. \u201cXu Xiaoshou is walking over here\u2026\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat does he want to do?\u201dThe two attendants behind Xu Xiaoshou saw that something was off. They understood Xu Xiaoshou all too well.They quickly rushed forward to stop him. \u201cWhat do you want to do? Don\u2019t be rash!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s injured. He\u2019s a patient!\u201d\u201cI can sense that he resents me,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou snarled.Ren Chong became flustered. \u201cHow did you sense that so well?\u201d he thought to himself.He quickly grabbed onto the medical attendant\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t save me for now. Xu Xiaoshou\u2026 He\u2019s walking over!\u201dThe four medical attendants looked at Xu Xiaoshou at the same time, a murderous look in their eyes. Xu Xiaoshou forced a smile and said, \u201cHehe, it\u2019s fine, I was merely concerned and wanted to see if this man had gotten crippled or not.\u201d\u201cNo need for your concern. I\u2019m good!\u201d Ren Chong shivered. He grabbed tightly onto the medical attendant\u2019s hand and bitterly pleaded, \u201cI request for a change of location for my treatment!\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou warmly laughed.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cZhao Qingteng!\u201dXiao Qixiu\u2019s voice suddenly rang out, interrupting the small incident in the waiting room. The pairing had been completed.The crowd fell silent after the names were announced. Then, a collective gasp was heard. Everyone was filled with anticipation for this battle.Xu Xiaoshou froze. Zhao Qingteng?Rank two of the Windcloud Scoreboard?An Innate-stage fighter?\u201cIs it finally here?\u201d He sighed melancholically, but he already knew that he\u2019d likely encounter an innate-stage fighter in his battle for a spot in the top four.\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +1.\u201dThe notification panel got updated constantly again, and Xu Xiaoshou instinctively looked at Ren Chong. Sure enough, the man had a gloating look on his face.Who could tolerate that?He was resenting and mocking him. How far was he going to go?\u201cSo what if it\u2019s Zhao Qingteng,\u201d he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s guaranteed to win against me, so why is he mocking me?\u201dXu Xiaoshou tossed the attendant\u2019s hand to the side and charged forward.\u201cOh f***, Xu Xiaoshou, what are you doing!\u201d Ren Chong was flustered.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, stop!\u201d The medical personnel quickly dodged to the side, afraid that they\u2019d be hit by an Innate-stage physical body. \u201cThis is a casualty. What are you trying to do?\u201dRen Chong looked fearfully at the four white-robed angels. They ran away?1\u201cTake me with you!\u201dXu Xiaoshou picked up Ren Chong, who\u2019d lost the ability to move, a look of self-blame and regret on his face.\u201cWhatever your name is, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have hit you. But it\u2019s all right. I know how to connect bones. And I also have a lot of Red Gold Pills, so I can guarantee that you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said, his tone somewhat nasal, as he felt toward Ren Chong\u2019s rib bone.\u201cOh f***, don\u2019t touch me!\u201d\u201cSave me. Where are the medical personnel? Don\u2019t leave me here alone! Take me with you!\u201d\u201cSss~\u201d\u201cAhhhh\u2026\u201dThe medical personnel huddled with the waiting area attendants, and they all trembled when they saw Xu Xiaoshou attempt to connect Ren Chong\u2019s bones while taking out a pill.He must be a demon!\u2026A young lad wearing a pale green silk robe walked down the main arena. She had exquisite features that looked as though they were carved from jade. She was rather cute.7Her long ponytail shook as she looked around, as if searching for a target. Then, she skipped toward Xu Xiaoshou and reached out to pat him on his head.\u201cXu Xiaoshou, Elder Xiao is calling for you.\u201dXu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cWait a moment. I\u2019m connecting his bones!\u201dThe young lady tilted her head, extremely curious.She saw Xu Xiaoshou manically pressing on Ren Chong\u2019s wounds while letting him sniff on a pill and was startled by the act. She pointed at Ren Chong and said, \u201cHe\u2019s dying!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The Red Gold Pill is regulating his breathing. He won\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re letting him sniff the pill instead of eating it? What use is there in that?\u201dXu Xiaoshou froze when he heard these words. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he thought. \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t seem to have the Breathing Technique\u2026\u201d3Blood was foaming from Ren Chong\u2019s mouth, and his eyes had rolled into the back of his head. He looked like he was halfway to the afterlife. Xu Xiaoshou quickly fed him the pill.3Naturally, he managed to connect Ren Chong\u2019s bones. It turned out he had the skills after all. However, he couldn\u2019t do much about Ren Chong\u2019s pain.\u201cXu Xiaoshou! Get up here!\u201d Xiao Qixiu\u2019s furious roar assaulted his ears.Xu Xiaoshou trembled, and he turned around to see the delicate appearance of the green-robed lady. She was the person who had called him earlier.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201cMu Zixi.\u201dThe green-robed lady tilted her head. She was very friendly. \u201cHello, Xu Xiaoshou.\u201d\u201cOh-oh.\u201dXu Xiaoshou had no time to waste, and quickly ran toward the arena. \u201cHello! Goodbye!\u201d1Mu Zixi was speechless.\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +1.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35The battle for a spot in the top four. The third match.Zhao Qingteng stood with his sword slanted downward. He was looking up into the sky. He seemed proud and cold.The air seemed to become colder just from him standing there. There were even snowflakes falling around him.Xu Xiaoshou poked his head into the barrier and shivered. The temperature inside the arena was many times colder than the temperature outside.\u201cIs this the Innate Elemental Power?\u201d he thought to himself. He already knew that Zhao Qingteng had ice elemental abilities. However, he only truly realized how terrifying an Innate-stage fighter was now that he was facing one in the flesh.Zhao Qingteng was affecting nature with his powers. How was that not terrifying!?There was an adjustment period after the candidates entered the arena. Xiao Qixiu took rather good care of Xu Xiaoshou. Even though this lad was always very tardy, Xiao Qixiu still gave him the time he needed to prepare.Xu Xiaoshou extended his hand, and the snowflakes in the air landed on his palm. It looked silent and elegant.The crowd was smitten. A light snow was falling on the three men in the arena, and the sceen looked like something right out of a painting.\u201cJudge, he\u2019s cheating.\u201dThe crowd was still immersed in the picturesque scene when Xu Xiaoshou suddenly pointed at Zhao Qingteng on the other side and said in fury, \u201cThe battle hasn\u2019t started yet, and he\u2019s already influencing the environment. That isn\u2019t fair!\u201dThe snow in the air seemed to stop somewhat, and Zhao Qingteng finally looked at Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cGot mocked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cOh my!\u201d he thought.\u201cYou\u2019re mocking me?\u201dXu Xiaoshou indignantly glared back at Zhao Qingteng. \u201cWho\u2019s afraid of who?\u201d he thought.Xiao Qixiu knitted his brows. What Xu Xiaoshou said made sense. However, in the middle of a battle, who would care about this little bit of snow?\u201cWhat do you want me to do about it?\u201dXu Xiaoshou chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m a little cold. Get him to stop the snow!\u201dHe was acting a little over the top, but he wasn\u2019t taking this match lightly.Who knew what kind of abilities these snowflakes had? Maybe Zhao Qinteng could sense his opponents\u2019 positions when the snowflakes touched them, or maybe he was charging up for a powerful move\u2026Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t so careless as to give an Innate-stage fighter an advantage when he was battling one. Didn\u2019t that mean that he\u2019d already lost half the battle?The crowd was a little displeased when they saw this. Some of the spectators agreed with Xu Xiaoshou, seeing that he was acting out of caution, but most of them thought that Xu Xiaoshou was being too nitpicky.It was just a few pieces of snow. Did he have to do that?\u201cI can\u2019t stop it,\u201d Zhao Qingteng said, his voice icy.\u201cThat\u2019s not good\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands and said, \u201cYou specialize in casting techniques at long range, while I specialize in close-range combat. On top of that, you\u2019re cheating. So how will we go about fighting each other?\u201dEven an arrogant person like Zhao Qingteng couldn\u2019t help the corners of his mouth from twitching at being repeatedly accused of \u201ccheating.\u201d\u201dWhat exactly do you want to do?\u201d he asked.1\u201cWhy not open the barrier and get the sun to shine on us?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou suggested.Xiao Qixiu staggered. \u201cGet the sun to shine on us?\u201d he thought. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get the thousands of spectators to watch you sunbathe?\u201d\u201cLetting the sun shine on us is impossible. Since you\u2019re suggesting a close-range battle, how about we close the distance a little?\u201d Xiao Qixiu inquisitively glanced at Zhao Qingteng.Zhao Qingteng nodded. Xu Xiaoshou was elated and thought, \u201cHe took the bait!\u201d\u201cHow much is a little?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou continued asking.Xiao Qixiu could no longer tolerate this lad. He was pushing it!\u201cAny distance you like.\u201d Zhao Qingteng\u2019s gaze turned cold, and he continued saying in a weighty tone, \u201cThe spectators outside are waiting. Let\u2019s start soon!\u201d\u201cAny distance?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow.In a flash, he arrived in front of Zhao Qingteng. Their noses were almost touching.\u201cIs this distance alright?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou exhaled.Zhao Qingteng was scared by the sudden increase in temperature. His pale skin became a little redder. He felt his heart thump wildly, and staggered backward a few steps, hesitating for a long while\u20263\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201dThe spectators were going insane. A few female disciples were repeatedly shouting \u201cno.\u201d5Zhao Qingteng\u2019s abilities and cold attitude made him the poster boy for the phrase \u201carrogant and cold.\u201d He was the white knight in the hearts of every female disciple in the Outer Yard.If this were any other match, many people would\u2019ve been in support of Xu Xiaoshou. However, since Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s opponent was Zhao Qingteng, all of the supporters had rallied to his side.\u201cGet away. Who permitted you to get close to my Brother Qingteng?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t agree to his request. Hng hng hng, Brother Qingteng, quickly put some distance between you.\u201d\u201cOh my, so things can be done this way. I\u2019ve learned! I\u2019m going to train well. I want to get that close to Brother Qingteng\u2026\u201dThe two candidates in the arena were within one step of each other and were staring deeply into each other\u2019s eyes.Xiao Qixiu raised his hand at an opportune moment. \u201cBattle, start!\u201dAs soon as he announced this, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s jovial expression immediately disappeared, and with a serious face, he landed a punch on Zhao Qingteng\u2019s body amidst the falling snow.Boom!Ice shrapnel exploded everywhere. Xu Xiaoshou had hit something solid, but he could tell that he didn\u2019t hit Zhao Qingteng.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dA clone, teleportation, or substitution technique?1Many thoughts instantly flashed through Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s mind. Within the radius of Sense, he saw the snow behind him move, and Zhao Qingteng appeared behind him.2Zhao Qingteng, who had just appeared, didn\u2019t attack right away. Instead, he chose to put some distance between them.He raised a finger to indicate something, then calmly said, \u201cYou fight decently.\u201d\u201cGot praised. Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt as though he\u2019d just been mocked. He was completely clueless as to how Zhao Qingteng had left. The fake Zhao Qingteng that he\u2019d punched had transformed into an ice sculpture under the falling snow and shattered.It was incredibly mysterious\u2026Xu Xiaoshou also pretended to be nonchalant. \u201cYou also hide well. I\u2019m guessing that it has nothing to do with this snow. Otherwise, you\u2019d really be cheating.\u201dZhao Qingteng was stoic. Xu Xiaoshou secretly felt that it was a waste. His face was so expressionless he couldn\u2019t read his next move.He stared at Zhao Qingteng as if nothing was happening as he started expanding the radius of Sense to its maximum, and the formation and fall of every snowflake clearly appeared in his mind.His instincts told him that he couldn\u2019t disregard the snow.This was snow that only appeared when he was battling Zhao Qingteng. He\u2019d never seen Zhao Qingteng use this technique in the past.Zhao Qingteng\u2019s blue Ice Stream Sword had an extraordinarily wide blade. Zhao Qingteng slowly lifted it, and the snow in the air seemed to tremble slightly.Xu Xiaoshou took out Hiding Pain. He knew that close-range combat would be impossible unless he could dispel Zhao Qingteng\u2019s technique.At the Innate Origin Court Level, Zhao Qingteng\u2019s spiritual strength would\u2019ve already evolved to become a spiritual source. Zhao Qingteng injected his spiritual source into the Ice Stream Sword, and the sword crackled as ice crystals formed on the blade.Whoosh!A blade sliced through the air, and an icy chill assaulted Xu Xiaoshou. He decided to tilt his body to the side to avoid the attack.The chilly air didn\u2019t touch his body, but it released a terrifying frost when it near him, and the cold severely limited his movements.1Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why no one could avoid Zhao Qingteng\u2019s Ice Stream Strike.\u201cSss~\u201dXu Xiaoshou shivered. His body was so numb that he could no longer hold onto his sword. He had no way of blocking the second sword aura, so all he could do was barely lift Hiding Pain.There was no collision, no explosion\u2026Under the shocked gazes of the spectators, Xu Xiaoshou got turned into an ice sculpture.\u201cOh f***! Even Xu Xiaoshou met the same fate. He got frozen in just two attacks?\u201d1\u201cZhao Qingteng is too strong. He used the Ice Stream Strike against all of his opponents, but Xu Xiaoshou has an Innate-stage physical body, so\u2026 Ice Stream Two Strikes?\u201d2\u201cIs there such a big difference between the ten levels of Spiritual Cultivation and the Innate-stage?\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded\u2026\u201dZhao Qingteng\u2019s expression was still nonchalant. He struck with his sword as if he were facing the rest of his opponents. It was just that Xu Xiaoshou was equivalent to two people.However, the other party did have an Innate-stage physical body. Perhaps his Ice Stream Spiritual Source that could freeze the body of a Spiritual Cultivation Level Ten fighter to death might not be able to freeze Xu Xiaoshou to death\u2026Zhao Qingteng glanced at Xiao Qixiu. He saw that he had no intention of moving to save his opponent and became sure of his conjecture.He was going to continue attacking!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Zhao Qingteng didn\u2019t approach Xu Xiaoshou. Instead, he lifted his Ice Stream Sword and looked up as he muttered, \u201cGalaxy!\u201d\u201cWhoosh\u2026\u201dThe snow on the ground instantly floated and swirled up into the air before shattering to become a sword aura.Zhao Qingteng\u2019s attack seemed to tear open the galaxy, and it sliced toward Xu Xiaoshou amidst the hovering snow.The sword behind Xiao Qixiu\u2019s back trembled, and the judge looked startled.Acquired-stage Sword Will!To think that it was an Acquired-stage Sword Will!5In the previous battle, there was Zhou Tianshen\u2019s Acquired-stage Blade Will, and now there was Zhao Qingteng\u2019s Acquired-stage Sword Will.\u201cIs this Xu Xiaoshou the key to unlocking the secrets of winning?\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cHow does he expose all of his opponents\u2019 trump cards?\u201dZhou Tianshen hugged his sword while sitting in the spectator seats, looking worried.To think that it was a Sword Will!\u201cFaced with a Sword Will, how can Xu Xiaoshou, who\u2019s trapped within an ice sculpture, defend himself?\u201cIs Xu Xiaoshou, who defeated me, about to be taken down by Zhao Qingteng in three moves?\u201cThen won\u2019t I be\u2026He hit himself hard on the head, no longer able to sit still.On the other side, Mu Ziqi grabbed her pigtails. She was standing on a chair in the waiting room, craning her neck to see how strong Xu Xiaoshou, who hadn\u2019t cared to greet her, really was.1In the end, she saw that he\u2019d become an ice sculpture the moment the battle started.Elder Qiao sat silently in the spectator seats. This was the second time he\u2019d come to watch Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s battle, and it was also the second time he\u2019d felt that he should go and console Xu Xiaoshou after the battle.1Under the crowd\u2019s gaze, the galaxy-like sword aura sliced the target into two.The sword aura flashed past the arena, and the ice sculpture immediately exploded.However, the crowd was shocked to find that the ice sculpture hadn\u2019t been cut by the Sword Will. Instead, an arm had sliced out from inside the ice sculpture, breaking it from the inside.Zhao Qingteng\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAn arm?\u201d he thought.The arm had a transparent glow about it, as if the flesh of the arm had a spiritual quality and was made out of treasures. The arm grabbed onto the fiercely approaching sword aura.Everyone was shocked. It grabbed the attack?Clang\u2026A piercing sound rang out. Xu Xiaoshou looked as though he\u2019d just been reborn, and jumped out of the ice sculpture.He somersaulted in the air, then tossed the Galaxy Sword Aura back at Zhao Qingteng!\u201cOh f***!\u201dZhou Tianshen, who was outside the arena, was shocked, and his eyes almost bulged out of their sockets. This scene was extremely familiar.In their battle, Xu Xiaoshou had reversed his Deity Mountain-Lifting Technique with his sword technique, which had ultimately led to his defeat.In just the one day he hadn\u2019t seen Xu Xiaoshou, he didn\u2019t expect him to now be able to reverse his opponent\u2019s techniques without even using his sword.\u201cGrabbed onto a sword aura with his bare hands?\u201d he thought, incredulous.\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201dXu Xiaoshou knelt weakly onto the ground and trembled as he slowly expelled the chilly energy in his body.Fleeting White Cloud Two: Modified Sword Style!3That\u2019s right. This was the Sword Will attack that he\u2019d learned during his battle with Zhou Tianshen yesterday. It was just that Xu Xiaoshou had executed it with his Glow of Sharpness.1He gathered the transparent glow on his arm and turned it into a blade. Its sharpness was comparable to that of Hiding Pain.Snow fell in the arena. The crowd was dumbfounded.It would\u2019ve been fine if Xu Xiaoshou had used his sword. However, Xu Xiaoshou had grabbed onto the sword aura with his bare hands, which shocked everyone beyond belief. Even Zhao Qingteng was unable to react for a moment.The sword attack sliced toward Zhao Qingteng, and Zhao Qingteng narrowly managed to avoid it. The Galaxy Sword Aura blasted onto the barrier instead, causing it to ripple, and the barrier was almost torn apart.\u201cTerrifying!\u201dEveryone was shocked and couldn\u2019t believe that Xu Xiaoshou had been able to grab onto such a ferocious attack. At the same time, the Innate-stage physical body rose in their estimations.There was frost on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face, and his lips had turned purple. He\u2019d clearly been severely frozen. However, the wound on his palm that he\u2019d gotten from the sword aura made him feel wide awake.The scorching energy in his energy reserve spread through his body and quickly dispelled the cold, which was a pleasant surprise.\u201cI\u2019ll take his life now that he\u2019s weakened!\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t let the opportunity to launch consecutive attacks slip by. He immediately grabbed onto Hiding Pain after throwing the sword aura out.A moment later, he gracefully sliced his sword through the air, and his Sword Will immediately pressed onto the surroundings.Fleeting White Cloud One: Sword Web Style!He\u2019d thought up these names for two attacks while frozen, and during that time he\u2019d also thought about how to use them!He, Xu Xiaoshou, knew more than just close-range combat.Zhao Qingteng had just avoided his own Galaxy Sword Aura when he saw the web of swords pressing toward him. He immediately sliced forward with his Ice Stream Sword, and the clashing of swords rang out in the arena as they hit.Creak, creak, creak!Streaks of red blood appeared on Zhao Qingteng\u2019s white robes.The reality was that Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Sword Will had become more powerful after refining it over the course of his battles.Even though Zhao Qingteng also had an Acquired-stage Sword Will, he couldn\u2019t defend against Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s intensive barrage of attacks.The next second, Zhao Qingteng gave up resisting, and the web of swords sliced past his body. Zhao Qingteng\u2019s ice sculpture appeared once again, and it instantly crumbled from the attacks of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword.It appeared!The unknown substitution technique!Xu Xiaoshou had been prepared for this. His Sense had constantly been concentrating on the movements of the snow. Sure enough, he saw some of the snow in one area abnormally stagnate.It\u2019s there!The crowd watched in shock as Xu Xiaoshou shot a palm toward the air beside him, and they grew so anxious that they almost cursed at Xu Xiaoshou.However, the next instant, Zhao Qingteng appeared where Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm had struck!\u201cOh, God!\u201dThe crowd became confused at that moment. What was going on?Xu Xiaoshou had hit Zhao Qingteng. One of them was willing to attack, while the other was willing to get hit?2Zhao Qingteng\u2019s expression changed. He knew that his opponent had seen through his Snow Traversing Technique with his attack just now.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s ability to analyze the battle was terrifying!Caught off guard, Zhao Qingteng couldn\u2019t even lift his Ice Stream Sword. All he could do was meet Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm with his own.Xu Xiaoshou snickered.He twisted his right palm and made the Glow of Sharpness circle it. His palm instantly transformed into a claw as it pierced fiercely into Zhao Qingteng\u2019s comparatively tender palm.Rip!Blood sprayed into the air. Zhao Qingteng had already conjured an ice mirror so their palms would collide, thus defending himself against the attack. However, how would that stop the Innate-stage Sharpness?The claw directly ripped apart the ice mirror and left five bloody holes in Zhao Qingteng\u2019s palm!Xu Xiaoshou finally understood the difference between a palm strike and a claw attack. Now that his Sinister Skeletal Claw had landed, his opponent would be left with one finger if he pulled his hand back.His opponent would be left with his shortest finger!However, Xu Xiaoshou held back. It was just a thought. He didn\u2019t really do it.Even so, Zhao Qingteng\u2019s face contorted with pain, and his body instantly disappeared.This time, he didn\u2019t dare be careless. He immediately shifted his body to the furthest point away from Xu Xiaoshou. Xu Xiaoshou naturally couldn\u2019t catch up to him.\u201cThere really was a problem with this snow\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou chuckled. He turned to look at Xiao Qixiu. \u201cI already told you that he was cheating, but you didn\u2019t believe me. If it was me, I would\u2019ve immediately judged that he\u2019d lost.\u201dXiao Qixiu pouted but didn\u2019t say anything.The crowd was shocked. To think that Xu Xiaoshou was the first one to make Zhao Qingteng bleed during the Windcloud Competition. No one had expected this.\u201cSo Zhao Qingteng\u2019s teleportation technique was really done through moving around in the snow as Xu Xiaoshou said?\u201d1The spectators all had odd looks on their faces. If that were the case, then Zhao Qingteng really had cheated.No one would\u2019ve thought it inappropriate if Zhao Qingteng had made the snow fall before the battle started to add to his charisma. In fact, they would\u2019ve even been envious of his ability.But, because the snow was connected to a technique that required charging up or a technique that was done in secret, his actions sparked the crowd\u2019s ire.At that moment, people started switching sides. It was clear that Zhao Qingteng\u2019s actions didn\u2019t sit well with them.\u201cDo your best, Xu Xiaoshou! I know that you\u2019re the best.\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, defeat Zhao Qingteng and I\u2019ll bear you a child!\u201d9\u201cXu Xiaoshou! Ahhh, you\u2019re so handsome!\u201dZhou Tianshen looked over in shock, only now realizing that he had unknowingly left the arena to observe the battle. Was the crowd always so fierce?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37In the arena.After using the Snow Traversing Technique to shift his position, Zhao Qingteng didn\u2019t stop at all. While Xu Xiaoshou was speaking, he crossed his palms and instantly made a dozen hand gestures.3Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt that the situation had taken a turn for the worse.It was undoubtedly a powerful attack. Zhao Qingteng had taken advantage of the split second he was distracted.\u201cLiu Zhen, I\u2019ve disappointed you. I\u2019ve committed the grave taboo of underestimating my opponent!\u201d he thought.He immediately flew forward. Unfortunately, they were too far apart for him to close in on his opponent in time.Xu Xiaoshou took a whiff of a spirit crystal and recovered a little of his spiritual strength. Then, he gracefully slashed his sword outward.1Sword Web Style!Zhao Qingteng disregarded the sudden assault of the sword web and shot his blood palm toward the air.\u201cFormless Great Cold!\u201dHe only picked up his Ice Stream Sword to defend against the sword web after he was done doing this.Zhao Qingteng\u2019s flesh got cut open amidst the barrage of attacks.Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t even imagine just how terrifying the attack Zhao Qingteng wanted to complete even at the risk of death was. A second later, the snow within his Sense was awakened by the spiritual seal in the air, and they slowly rose into the air.1The crowd rubbed their eyes. There\u2019d already been a thick layer of accumulation on the ground, but now the inside of the barrier had become completely white after the snow was awakened. They couldn\u2019t even see the figures inside the arena.\u201cChi!\u201d Zhao Qingteng cried out, and the sword aura in the area sliced through the air.In that instant, every snowflake exploded with a stern sword aura, as though tens of thousands of swords had risen into the air.Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. This Zhao Qingteng was vicious!As it turned out, Zhao Qingteng had caused the falling snow at the start not only to facilitate his Snow Traversing Technique, but also lay the foundation for this Formless Great Cold.The entire sky was covered with snowflakes that contained sword aura. With Zhao Qingteng\u2019s command, the snowflakes intertwined and created a boundless sword glow within the barrier.Not only did the attack instantly crumble Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s barrier, but it even penetrated his Innate-stage physical body.Xiao Qixiu\u2019s expression turned grave. Even though this terrifying Innate-stage spiritual technique was called the Formless Great Cold, every piece of falling snow had taken the form of a lethal sword with the intention of killing him!1Would Xu Xiaoshou be able to survive against this technique?2The crowd suddenly saw blood spraying outward at a point within the snowy-white barrier.That was where Xu Xiaoshou was!Xu Xiaoshou clenched his teeth tightly. He\u2019d even closed his eyes. If he hadn\u2019t, even his eyeballs would\u2019ve been pierced through by the Sword Will-infused snowflakes.Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!Every snowflake was like a tiny sword that was sharp without parallel. Even his Innate-stage physical body couldn\u2019t defend against the attack, and countless bloody holes instantly appeared on his body.Xiao Qixiu was ready to take action. He would definitely be the first to take action the moment Xu Xiaoshou showed any inclination of giving up.Zhao Qingteng panted. He had used all of his trump cards. This technique had expended a great amount of his spiritual source, but Xu Xiaoshou could still stand the attack?Was an Innate-stage physical body really that strong?He clenched his teeth and flew forward. He shot his palm toward Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cIs he mad?\u201dWhy would Zhao Qingteng choose to engage in close combat when the situation was very much in his favor? Wasn\u2019t he afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would turn the situation around when he got close?\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d Someone suddenly stood up. \u201cThat\u2019s the Dark Ice Sealing Palm! That\u2019s a spiritual technique at the peak of the Innate-stage. Xu Xiaoshou is done for!\u201d\u201cDark Ice Sealing Palm?\u201dEven Elder Qiao was shocked. He knew that this spiritual technique could even be ranked amongst the top few in the Inner Yard.He clutched onto his sleeves tightly. Xu Xiaoshou was in grave danger!Furthermore, Xu Xiaoshou was still doing battle against the Sword Will-infused snowflakes and couldn\u2019t tell his left from right. The Eternal Vitality had been activated to its fullest extent and was constantly restoring his body.Penetrated, repaired\u2026Repaired, penetrated\u2026The pain Xu Xiaoshou was going through now was comparable to that which he\u2019d gone through when refining the Infernal Fire Seed.1\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThousands of notifications immediately appeared in his notification panel, which showed how insane the barrage of attacks of the Sword Will-infused snowflakes was!1Xu Xiaoshou was holding on by sheer willpower alone. His Sense told him that Zhao Qingteng was attacking him with a palm. He finally had no choice but to use his Skill Points.\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 7).\u201d\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 8).\u201dA large stream of information instantly flooded into his brain. Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have found a way to break apart the technique.He fought back the pain he was feeling and raised Hiding Pain. Then, he infused his immense Sword Will into the blade of his sword. He was risking it all on this attack!Whoosh!Hiding Pain rapidly sliced through the air, and the blade of the sword erupted in flames. However, Zhao Qingteng had been prepared for this. He tilted his head, and the spiritual sword only pierced into his shoulder!The sword kept flying forward from the momentum, and it pierced through the barrier and flew toward the horizon under the crowd\u2019s stunned gaze.The crowd no longer had time to care about the spiritual sword. Zhao Qingteng continued pushing his palm forward despite the pain radiating from the wound in his shoulder.On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou\u2026He was all out of moves!\u201cDark Ice Sealing Palm!\u201dBoom!As the cry fell, the Sword Will-infused snowflakes that were assaulting Xu Xiaoshou at a rapid rate suddenly stopped.The area in front of Zhao Qingteng, which included the area where Xu Xiaoshou was in as well as the arena behind him, immediately got frozen in ice under Zhao Qingteng\u2019s terrifying palm.Half the arena had gotten frozen in ice!2The crowd was silent. It was a block of ice that was larger than a house. It was too startling.The crowd froze.Then, the crowd realized in shock that the attack wasn\u2019t over!They saw Zhao Qingteng finally heave a sigh of relief. He was covered in blood. He brought his hands together and shouted, \u201cSeal!\u201dBoom!A soft explosion rang out. Under the crowd\u2019s incredulous gaze, the block of ice that occupied the larger half of the arena rapidly shrunk, tightening around Xu Xiaoshou.Finally, the ice block stopped at Xu Xiaoshou, who had his hands raised in the air.\u201cOh f***!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes almost bulged out of their sockets!For such a large block of ice to instantly become this small. Wouldn\u2019t the density of the ice cause anyone who was sealed inside to become an ice fossil?Was there any chance of survival? Zhao Qingteng might\u2019ve been too heavy-handed!Was Xu Xiaoshou dead?Xiao Qixiu took a deep breath. He sensed that something bad had happened.The saying still rang true. What judges feared the most were techniques that decided the battle in a split second.If he saved Xu Xiaoshou, it would be the same as prematurely helping Xu Xiaoshou admit defeat. Xu Xiaoshou wouldn\u2019t thank him for that. However, if just looked on from the side, he\u2019d be helplessly looking on as the candidate welcomed his death. What was he to do in this situation?He could only slowly raise his hand. \u201cThe battle is ove\u2026\u201dWhoosh!At that moment, the sound of something tearing through the air rang out and interrupted Xiao Qixiu\u2019s words.Everyone looked at the sky, confused. They saw Hiding Pain, which had pierced through Zhao Qingteng\u2019s shoulder and vanished into the horizon from the momentum, fly back toward the arena at supersonic speeds.Zhao Qingteng looked back in fear to see the black dot instantly enlargen as it flew at him and pierced through his chest, landing fiercly into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s ice sculpture.1\u201cPuuu!\u201dZhao Qingteng\u2019s body arched over, and he abruptly spat out a mouthful of blood that contained pieces of his organs.1Xiao Qixiu had been slow to charge forward to stop the sword, as he didn\u2019t expect the sword to come back.Hiding Pain had stabbed into the ice sculpture and was buzzing excitedly, filled with a spiritual quality.Xiao Qixiu\u2019s eyes were filled with shock. This is\u2026Sword Telepathy?To think that Xu Xiaoshou had touched the doors of the Innate-stage Sword Will!Outside the arena, Zhou Tianshen excitedly stood up. He looked at Hiding Pain, which was trembling constantly, and felt his body burn with fighting spirit.That sword technique was too powerful!It was too powerful!It was ten times more powerful than Xu Xiaoshou was yesterday!Elder Qiao froze. He\u2019d never expected that after just a Death Seclusion, Xu Xiaoshou would improve so drastically in just the few days he hadn\u2019t seen him!This was unimaginable!In a waiting area not far away, an attendant was helping Mu Zixi, who had fallen from her chair, up onto a new chair. This green-robed lady\u2019s mouth had turned into an \u201co\u201d shape, and she\u2019d almost pulled out her pigtails.Crack, crack!The ice sculpture cracked under the sword\u2019s trembling.The wounds on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body had been frozen, and he felt like even his soul was trembling.The only reason why he could still hold onto his last breath was because Eternal Vitality was too powerful!He walked out of the ice sculpture with trembling lips, and his body helpless slumped onto the ground.\u201cWhat kind of sword technique is that!\u201d Zhao Qingteng looked incredibly indignant.Xu Xiaoshou trembled as he slowly exhaled a breath of chilly energy.\u201cThe White Cloud Sword Technique.\u201d\u201cGot doubted.

    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Thud!Zhao Qingteng\u2019s knees buckled, and he fell face-first onto the ground, unconscious.Hiding Paid had pierced completely through his chest, leaving behind a would as large as a fist. His blood flowed down him like a waterfall, instantly dying the arena red.4\u201cHelp him!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou immediately shouted at Xiao Qixiu when he saw how dumbfounded everyone was.The judge waved his arm, and medical personnel immediately charged into the arena and surrounded both Xu Xiaoshou and Zhao Qingteng.Xu Xiaoshou saw the four familiar faces around him. Weren\u2019t these people the ones who\u2019d saved the big watermelon during the previous match?\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Save Zhao Qingteng first!\u201dXu Xiaoshou grew anxious when he saw the medical personnel fiddle with their bags and grab their scalpels, and quickly pointed to the other side. \u201cHe has a hole in him. And he\u2019s an Innate-stage fighter. He\u2019s more important.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re important too!\u201d the medical attendant said with honor.2It was their job to save people, if the person they had to save was sick in the head.\u201cGot concerned for. Passive Points +4.\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked a little hesitant when he saw them start threading their needles.Saving people was naturally a good thing. However, the problem was he didn\u2019t need saving!During the battle with Zhao Qingteng, only the Formless Great Cold and the Dark Ice Sealing Palm had really dealt any damage to him.However, those attacks had already passed!The Sword Will-infused snowflakes created by the former had stabbed into him and basically turned him into a beehive. However, because of Eternal Vitality, he only sustained superficial damage, and his injuries healed almost instantaneously after the Sword Will-infused snowflakes stopped raining down on him.The latter attack had instantly compressed him into a block of ice. An average person\u2019s soul might\u2019ve even gotten frozen by the attack. However, he\u2019d just consumed the Infernal Fire Seed, and he also had an Innate-stage physical body as well as Eternal Vitality\u2026Truthfully speaking, the damage inflicted onto him by the Dark Ice Sealing Palm was lesser than that of the Formless Great Cold.\u201cI really don\u2019t need it\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said weakly.The four medical attendants glared at him. \u201cWho here didn\u2019t see you get beaten half to death?\u201d they thought. \u201cLook at your clothes. They\u2019re all dyed red!\u201cLook at your face. It\u2019s covered in patches of green and blue. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been quite severely frozen.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou gave up resisting, and the medical attendants raised their needles and scalpels and immediately touched Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body.\u201cGot doubted. Passive Points +4.\u201dThe next instant, the medical attendants all stopped what they were doing at the same time and looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dHow was this possible?This person must be a monster. Zhao Qingteng\u2019s barrage of attacks just now only did this little damage to him?Furthermore, the life force emanating from his body was never-ending, which was ridiculous. It was even more ridiculous than him consuming a Red Gold Pill.There was nothing to treat him for!Even though he was bleeding all over\u2026How could this be\u2026Could the Innate-stage physical body really be this powerful?Xu Xiaoshou spread his arms and stood up. Even though the surface of his body was still purple from being frozen, he\u2019d recovered his mobility during this brief period of time.\u201cI already told you that I didn\u2019t need treatment, but you guys didn\u2019t believe me!\u201dXu Xiaoshou pointed at Zhao Qingteng. \u201cGo and save him quickly. Hiding Pain should have avoided his vital areas, so he won\u2019t die from this.\u201d2The four medical attendants were extremely hesitant. After being shocked by Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Innate-stage physical body, they were clearly at a loss for what to do.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth. That person didn\u2019t even deal any damage to me during our battle!\u201cGo and save him quickly!At the same time, the medical personnel on the other side had completed their treatment, and all of them got excited.\u201cHe\u2019s awake!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 Oh?\u201dThe crowd wasn\u2019t excited for long. Zhao Qingteng\u2019s expression suddenly darkened after he woke up, and he fainted once again.\u201cGot cursed. Passive Points +1.\u201dThe four medical personnel on the other side glared at Xu Xiaoshou, their eyes filled with murderous rage.\u201cGot attacked. Passive Points +4.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u2026\u201cGot admired. Passive Points +666.\u201d2\u201cGot admired. Passive Points +888.\u201d1As expected, Xu Xiaoshou received several notifications in the notification panel the moment he stepped out of the barrier.Xu Xiaoshou saw the crowd rise to applaud him, and he happily waved his hands in reply.\u201cOh?\u201dHe suddenly saw Elder Qiao and Zhou Tianshen. The both of them were giving him a thumbs-up, and they almost charged down to give him a warm hug.\u201cGot praised. Passive Points +2.\u201dFortunately, this was the third match, so the spectators weren\u2019t allowed to come down to the arena. Otherwise, there would\u2019ve been a manly hug.3Xu Xiaoshou smiled at them in reply. However, he was filled with confusion on the inside.He could understand why Elder Qiao would come and watch his match and encourage him. But why was Zhou Tianshen here?Had he become a fan after their battle?Xu Xiaoshou returned to the waiting area. Even though it was already late in the day, Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t immediately return to his manor.After the arena was cleaned up, Xiao Qixiu no longer had to draw names, as there were only two contestants left in the battle for the top four.Mo Mo!3An Innate-stage expert!The person ranked first on the Windcloud Scoreboard!In terms of ability, she was undoubtedly the strongest disciple in the Outer Yard!Xu Xiaoshou had stayed behind, as he wanted to observe Junior Mo, who he had a high chance of facing in tomorrow\u2019s battle.In the arena, Mo Mo was dressed in a green robe, and her skin was fairer than snow.She had a small bronze furnace in her hands that was burning purple sandalwood. Mo Mo, being an Innate-stage fighter who had a pure, ethereal demeanor, completely eclipsed her opponent.1Xu Xiaoshou was looking forward to the match.However, there was no excitement or thrills from the moment the match started. In just a few seconds, Mo Mo\u2019s opponent, who was at Level Ten, was sent flying out of the arena in two strokes.Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.That darned Innate-stage fighter!He angrily turned around and left the waiting area.\u2026The path forked in two in the forest. One led to Goose Lake while the other led to his manor.The former represented mystery and the unknown, while the latter represented comfort and relaxation.Xu Xiaoshou chose the latter without hesitation.What a joke. He\u2019d just spent a great deal of effort to resolve the ordeal involving the Infernal Fire Seed, so why would he go to Goose Lake? To eat another seed?5He wouldn\u2019t do it even if he wanted to die. It was too painful!Xu Xiaoshou returned to his manor and lay down on his bed after taking a shower, and an indescribable sense of comfort washed over him.Xu Xiaoshou took out a Spiritual Cultivation Pill and took a whiff.\u201cSss~\u201dIt was double the pleasure!The upgraded Breathing Technique had been strengthened, and he inhaled the entire pill in one breath. Fortunately, he\u2019d already been trying his best to resist the high.Even so, he still slipped into a daze from the sudden rush. Then, a wave of spiritual strength coursed through his body, and the tides of his energy reserve rose.His body trembled\u2026He had broken through\u2026Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight!Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.He\u2019d spent a great deal of effort to suppress his cultivation level after he finished refining the Infernal Fire Seed yesterday. In the end, he\u2019d stopped paying attention for a moment and achieved a breakthrough\u2026\u201cForget it. Let it be fast.\u201d\u201cPerhaps my speed is nothing in front of true geniuses,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou consoled himself and stopped caring about the situation. After all, he could consolidate his cultivation level even while sleeping.He willed the notification panel to appear in his mind.Passive Points: 18882.\u201cHm, it\u2019s a little less than it was before.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was a little disappointed, even though he\u2019d somewhat expected such a result.Without the Infernal Fire Seed giving him a Passive Point every second, he\u2019d only gained roughly 4000 to 5000 Passive Points from the thousand-man crowd during his match.And that was even after getting hit by Zhao Qingteng\u2019s Formless Great Cold. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve gotten 1000 to 2000 fewer Passive Points.\u201cThe Infernal Fire Seed\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou started to miss that item. However, the fire seed was a time bomb that could go off at any moment, so it was best not to think about it\u2026However, perhaps he might be able to control it\u2026Xu Xiaoshou stroked his chin as he deliberated, then finally did away with that bold thought.Rather than think about the Infernal Fire Seed, he might as well mull over what intentions that detestable old man had had when he got him to swallow the item.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Nighttime.Stars dotted the sky.Xu Xiaoshou had only slept until the middle of the night before waking up again.He didn\u2019t wake up because he was nervous about the semi-finals tomorrow. Definitely not!He grabbed his sword and stepped into the yard.He silently stood in the yard. The wind was quiet amidst the cicadas and frogs, and Xu Xiaoshou was even quieter.\u201cNow is a good time to practice my sword techniques\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou thought back to the sword techniques that he\u2019d learned over the last few days.Sword Technique Expertise was completely unlike his other passive skills. It wasn\u2019t at all like Strengthen or Sharpness, which had directly granted him new abilities. Instead, Sword Technique Expertise gave him insight into other abilities.Xu Xiaoshou had to consolidate these insights on his own.He slowly closed his eyes.At this moment, everything in the yard seemed to tremble slightly.The fake mountain, the spiritual pool, the newly-built house\u20262He thought back to Zhao Qingteng\u2019s Formless Great Cold, which was the technique that had made the greatest impression on him during the entire tournament.But not just because of how powerful or high-level the technique was.It\u2019d made a deep impression on him because it was the first time he\u2019d seen someone separate their Sword Will from their body and imbued it into snowflakes.This way of using Sword Will had widened his horizons.Yes, he was secretly learning his opponent\u2019s technique now.He was stealing Zhao Qingteng\u2019s Formless Great Cold.Even though he couldn\u2019t conjure snow, would he be able to imbue his Sword Will into other natural objects since Zhao Qingteng could imbue his into the snow?The wind blew past him, and Xu Xiaoshou seemed to become one with his surroundings. The pebbles on the ground started to tremble violently.1Patter!Patter!Xu Xiaoshou abruptly opened his eyes. The pebbles suddenly rose into the air as if they were floating snow, and his Sword Will soared.\u201cHah!\u201dHe slashed his sword forward. The scene of a crashing snowy mountain appeared in his mind, as though his attack had severed the environment!Within his field of vision, the pebbles vibrated violently before crashing onto the ground.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cThat\u2019s all??\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened. Why was it so different from what he\u2019d imagined?\u201cHuff!\u201d\u201cFortunately, no one saw that\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cOtherwise, I would\u2019ve embarrassed myself.\u201d2He calmed himself down slightly and realized that it wasn\u2019t easy to secretly learn from someone.However, this kind of sword technique that could imbue natural objects with his Sword Will seemed to have a lot of potential.\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s also a way to battle with Sword Will\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou lifted his sword and paced around, his thoughts running wild under the dark sky.This kind of training method felt similar to the time when he\u2019d mulled over how to battle without using spiritual techniques and fight purely using his Sword Will.\u201cMove according to your heart\u2019s desires? Move as one with the sword?\u201dAn image appeared in his mind. Multiple opponents were falling as fallen leaves rose into the air. It was then replaced with the image of a strike of a sword gathering tens of thousands of swords back to the source.What kind of imagery would he reach if he continued on this path?Xu Xiaoshou was a little moved. He knew that he didn\u2019t have great talent. After three years, he\u2019d only managed to learn one stroke from the White Cloud Sword Technique.2However, he\u2019d gained a better understanding of the Sword Will following the appearance of the Sword Technique Expertise.Since that was the case, couldn\u2019t he try walking down this path?The mainstream method of a swordsman was to pair his Sword Will with spiritual techniques to unleash terrifying damage output.However, what Xu Xiaoshou thought to do was to battle purely using his Sword Will.This was a path that was destined to be different from the rest. He didn\u2019t know if he would ultimately stray from the correct path or forge his own style within the mainstream.\u201cSigh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou shook his head. The latter was too difficult. He should take it one step at a time!\u201cLet me first think about how I should approach the semi-final tomorrow\u2026\u201dHis Innate-stage physical body had been exposed to the world. Everyone knew about it. He would lose half the initiative if his opponent put distance between them.Only Hiding Pain could turn the tide of the battle in his favor tomorrow\u2026Xu Xiaoshou had an odd look on his face. Why does the topic always return to my Sword Will no matter what I think about?He fell into deep thought.He\u2019d managed to create many different patterns of Fleeting White Clouds after the technique was magnified by his Sword Will.Sword Web Style, Modified Sword Style, Reverse Sword Style\u2026The former two felt natural. It was the natural application of his Sword Will. As for the Reverse Sword Style\u2026Xu Xiaoshou looked at Hiding Pain in his hand.This style had been the result of a stroke of inspiration in the middle of a crisis during his battle with Zhao Qingteng. It was more about combining his Sword Will with the sword itself.During that time, he felt that Hiding Pain had come alive!\u201cSword Telepathy?\u201dThat also seemed like a way of imbuing Sword Will into another object. However, Hiding Pain was closer to him, which was why it worked.Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had an idea: he could imbue Hiding Pain with his Sword Will and launch a counterattack. However, was that all he\u2019d be able to do?No!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes flashed. If he could perfectly control Hiding Pain with his Sword Will, wouldn\u2019t he master the legendary Sword Soaring Technique?!Even\u2026Flying on a sword?!2Flying was something only an Innate-stage fighter could do. He was only Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight. Wouldn\u2019t the crowd be extremely startled if he managed to fly on his sword?\u201cLet\u2019s try it out!\u201dXu Xiaoshou recalled his battle in the afternoon and infused his Sword Will into the blade of Hiding Pain.\u201cBuzz\u2026\u201dA long howl was heard, and Hiding Pain started to tremble slightly.Xu Xiaoshou was startled. The black sword in his hand didn\u2019t feel like an inanimate object. It seemed to have some form of spiritual intelligence.\u201cGreat!\u201d he thought.\u201cThis means I\u2019ve already developed a relationship with it.\u201dXu Xiaoshou tossed Hiding Pain and pointed upward with two fingers.\u201cRise!\u201dHe seemed to see a vision of the black sword soaring in the air, but the sword behaved like an ordinary sword and fell onto the ground after he threw it.Clank, clank, clank!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression was dark as charcoal. The black sword constantly struggled on the ground, as if it\u2019d been forcibly used by someone.\u201cThat\u2019s not right,\u201d he thought. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this in the afternoon!\u201d\u201cCould it be that I didn\u2019t throw it with enough force?\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou picked up the sword and once again imbued it with his Sword Will. Then, he fiercely tossed the sword.Whoosh!Flames surrounded the body of the sword as it shot toward the horizon!Xu Xiaoshou cheered. Sometime later, he sensed the excited Sword Will again and immediately summoned his sword back to him.With a whoosh, a black dot appeared on the horizon, fiercely slashing toward Xu Xiaoshou.Xu Xiaoshou was startled. He wasn\u2019t encapsulated within an ice sculpture. Wouldn\u2019t he become a second Zhao Qingteng if he got hit by the sword?Thinking about this, he quickly jumped, wanting to stand on the sword\u2019s blade and fly into the air.In the end, Hiding Pain was too fast. It slipped past under his legs and instantly tripped him.Boom!Clang!The two of them fell onto the ground at the same time, and the surroundings became dead silent.\u201cDarn it, I don\u2019t believe this!\u201d\u201cAgain!\u201dXu Xiaoshou tried out the technique again. He was definitely going to master the legendary Sword Soaring Technique tonight!In the end\u2026Boom!Clang!\u201cWe continue!\u201dBoom!Clang!\u2026Stubbornness is a kind of poison. The night sky troubled Xu Xiaoshou.Sometime later, when Xu Xiaoshou threw the sword again, he finally realized that the black sword wasn\u2019t psychic.The only time the sword became truly excited was when it flew to its limits and was called back by Xu Xiaoshou.In other words, the \u201cReverse\u201d in the Reverse Sword Style meant that the black sword was only truly psychic during the reversal process.This made Xu Xiaoshou fall silent for a long while as he tried to understand what the difference between throwing the sword and having it return was.But he couldn\u2019t figure out the reason.\u201cThis darned Reverse Sword Style\u2026\u201d\u201cI should\u2019ve called it the Sword Soaring Technique!\u201dXu Xiaoshou decided to skip the throwing the sword step, and pointed the tip of the sword toward himself and imbued it with Sword Will.\u201cBuzz!\u201dThe body of the sword immediately started to get excited, and Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt the life within the sword.He turned the sword around and pointed it toward the sky.\u201cBuzz\u2026\u201dThe life force reduced to just a sliver.He turned it again.\u201cBuzz!\u201dHe turned it again.\u201cBuzz\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cWhat kind of principle is this?\u201d he thought. \u201cIt only has spiritual intelligence when it\u2019s aimed at me?1\u201cI think you want to kill your master!\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t believe this and continued turning the sword around.\u201cBuzz!\u201d\u201cBuzz\u2026\u201d\u201cBuzz!\u201d\u201cBuzz\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened, and he angrily tossed Hiding Pain. \u201cDarn it,\u201d he thought. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this sword!\u201dWhoosh!The black sword once again flew toward him.Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.Cursed others.

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Oh My, Did I See A Deity?Chapter 40: Oh My, Did I See A Deity?Noon the next day.The Tiansang Spirit Palace ushered in its yearly hot event. The champion of the Windcloud Competition was going to be determined today.Not only were the disciples and elders of the Outer Yard here to watch the match, but even a few Inner Yard disciples who had the time also came to have a look at the battles.The crowd\u2019s emotions were so high they were about to explode.The people who\u2019d come early to reserve seats saw the influential figures of the spirit palace in front of them.To the left were the elders of the Spiritual Affairs Division, Spiritual Medical Division, and Spiritual Military Division\u2026There were also a few unknown people who rarely showed themselves. They were elders who looked like elders but weren\u2019t really elders\u2026To the right were the people ranked in the top hundred, top ten, and top five of the Windcloud Scoreboard\u2026These were all people who had lorded over the arena with unparalleled authority since the very start. They were all now sitting in the spectator seats, obediently waiting for the competition to start.A female disciple had come to reserve a seat last night. Currently, Zhao Qingteng was sitting to her left and Zhou Tianshen to her right.She cupped her face and looked around her, then fainted from bliss.The people around her were so envious that their eyes almost fell out of their sockets.\u201cWow, she fainted. Send her for treatment quickly. I\u2019ll take care of her seat for her.\u201d\u201cMy God, who are these people. Senior Du, Senior Ling\u2026 They\u2019re all ranked within the top ten of the Windcloud Scoreboard!\u201d\u201cQuick, look! That\u2019s the Inner Yard\u2019s\u2026 Su Qianqian?\u201d\u201cWhere? Where?\u201dThe exclamation immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention. The Inner Yard\u2019s Su Qianqian was a legendary figure in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.She was the most powerful genius of the Su family in the Tiansang Prefecture of this era. She broke through to the Innate Stage when she was thirteen, and when she was fourteen she acquired the Innate-stage Sword Will. She wielded one of the twenty-one most famous swords in the continent: the Epitaph of City Snow. She was the personal disciple of the Spiritual Law Division\u2019s Xiao Qixiu\u2026Any one of these titles would cause an average person to tremble, but someone with all of them was sitting right before their eyes!Su Qianqian was dressed in white exercise gear, and her snow-colored giant sword was lying horizontally across her thighs. She was swinging her feet from side to side, unfazed by the crowd.She looked around but ultimately pouted in disappointment, as she didn\u2019t find Brother Little Beast, who she wanted to see.\u201cHow unfortunate we can\u2019t see the senior from the Inner Yard. I heard that she adores Su Qianqian and is always by her side.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Senior Rao is my goddess. Not only does she have an otherworldly appearance and impressive figure, but her abilities are also the cream of the crop. It\u2019s a pity that we cannot witness her splendor. Sigh!\u201d\u201cOh, I think I\u2019ve seen the person you\u2019re talking about. She came during the group stages\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must be dreaming. How would Senior Rao have time to come walk around in the Outer Yard? You must have dreamt it!\u201d\u201cI really saw her!\u201d\u201cTsk~\u201dThe crowd huddled together to look at the scene before them, constantly pointing out famous people from the Inner Yard that they recognized and whispering to each other.To them, this was a rare scene not regularly seen, even during the past year.It was only because the Outer Yard had a lot of break-out talents this year, with four Innate-stage fighters and Xu Xiaoshou, that many of the people from the Inner Yard had come to watch the match.\u201cOh God, it\u2019s Zhang Xinxiong! He\u2019s one of the Inner Yard Thirty-Three, a living boss!\u201d\u201cInner Yard Thirty-Three? Oh my, where, where?!\u201dThe crowd hurriedly looked around. They looked in the speaker\u2019s direction and saw a man with an overbearing aura not far away.Zhang Xinxiong looked 27 to 28 years old and had a full beard. He looked extremely masculine.He was very tall. He was a head taller than the rest of the crowd, even though he was sitting.He was dressed simply in a light-colored shirt with a jacket draped over his shoulders.Even so, under the sunlight, everyone could still see the alarming outline of his muscles hiding underneath his shirt.\u201cMy God, he\u2019s too handsome. He\u2019s a true man!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in love, I\u2019m in love!\u201dThis famous person from the Inner Yard didn\u2019t sit in the front row. Instead, he sat near the middle of the spectator seats. Beside him was Liu Zhen, who had been severely injured by Xu Xiaoshou in the past.Liu Zhen was also a burly man, but he looked like a tiny bird sitting beside Zhang Xinxiong.\u201cThe person who killed Ah Chong, Xu Xiaoshou. Which one is him?\u201d Zhang Xinxiong asked.\u201cLet me find him\u2026\u201d Liu Zhen respectfully replied. His gaze swept past several of the waiting areas before he finally shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s come.\u201d\u201cHah, he sure is calm. Is he going to arrive last\u2026\u201dZhang Xinxiong laughed lightly. There was no emotion in his voice, but the people around him felt that there was something strange here.Ah Chong\u2026That wasn\u2019t a name someone in an ordinary relationship with Wen Chong would call him.\u201cI heard that Boss Wen knew someone from the Inner Yard. Could that person be Zhang Xinxiong?\u201d\u201cI think so. If that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou in trouble? He killed Wen Chong!\u201d\u201cMy God, I seem to have seen Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s doomsday\u2026\u201dA ripple spread through the crowd after just one sentence. Everyone lowered their voices and discussed the situation.\u201cYou can\u2019t say it like that. Zhang Xinxiong is one of the Inner Yard Thirty-Three. Why would he attack a Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight fighter? Wouldn\u2019t that sully his status?\u201d\u201cHowever, being marked isn\u2019t a good feeling!\u201d\u201cYou think too much. Even if Xu Xiaoshou managed to become the champion, he might not be able to enter the Inner Yard because of his cultivation level.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, he still has to fight Mu Zixi and Senior Mo. Just getting into the top three would be decent.\u201d\u201cBut he has an Innate-stage physical body!\u201d\u201cSo what if he has an Innate-stage physical body? Is there a future in that? You\u2019ve seen an Innate-stage physical body, but have you seen a Master-stage physical body?\u201dThe crowd fell silent.The level above the Innate Stage was the Master Stage. There was a sliver of hope for a Spiritual Cultivator to reach the level where they could open up sects and schools. As for the physical body\u2026It was too difficult!Some might not have even heard of it, much less seen it!In the panel of judges.Xiao Qixiu gulped the contents of his cup down and flew into the arena, instantly attracting the crowd\u2019s attention.\u201cThe time has arrived. The semi-finals will start now!\u201dHe activated the array token with his spiritual source, and the screen flickered, then froze. Two names in stark red were printed across the middle of the screen.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cMu Zixi!\u201dThe crowd instantly erupted into exclamations.The first match of the semi-finals was already a battle between fighters with Innate-stage abilities, which was something everyone was looking forward to.One of them had broken through to the Innate Stage despite only being in the spirit palace for a year. Her potential was almost as high as Su Qianqian\u2019s.The other had an Innate-stage physical body and had defeated Zhao Qingteng yesterday, which proved that he had the ability to stand up against Innate-stage fighters!The doors of the waiting room were opened. Mu Zixi was dressed in pale green. She skipped toward the stage, as if she wasn\u2019t at all worried about the battle that was to come.Every step she took oozed youthful vitality, and the crowd couldn\u2019t help but like her.\u201cShe sure lives up to her reputation as Junior Mu. An Innate-stage fighter\u2026 is always so dependable!\u201dThe crowd looked at the other side. That was Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s waiting area.Thud!The doors opened.Two attendants steeled their nerves and walked out. They spread their arms open to signal that Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t there.The crowd was dumbfounded.\u201cWhy is it those two people? Where\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cOh, my God! Why did that guy disappear again!\u201d\u201cWhy is he always this tardy during important events. It\u2019s already the semi-finals. Can he not make us worry\u2026\u201d\u201cHey you, where did Xu Xiaoshou go?\u201dThe two attendants were dazed. \u201cDon\u2019t ask us,\u201d they thought.They\u2019d arrived at the waiting area early to wait, but the candidate didn\u2019t show.They sent people to look for him in his yard but only saw many sword marks on the ground and didn\u2019t manage to find him.Just where did Xu Xiaoshou go?Xiao Qixiu\u2019s expression darkened. He wanted to scream again.Suddenly, the sword behind his back trembled. He abruptly turned around and looked at the horizon.The crowd also noticed this, and all of them raised their heads.They saw a sword glow coming from far away. It was as if a sword deity had descended upon this world. On the sword was a figure whose robes were swaying in the wind.That clean, pure demeanor. That otherworldly form\u2026\u201cOh God, did I just see a deity?\u201d they thought.No\u2026Everyone looked more closely, and their eyes almost fell out of their skulls.Oh my!Xu Xiaoshou???Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: I\u2019m About to AttackChapter 41: I\u2019m About to AttackAt that moment, anyone would agree that Xu Xiaoshou really looked like some deity who had descended to the mortal world and fall in love with him.To start with, he had impeccable looks and sported a regal air. The way he was standing holding a sword behind his back at that moment made a lot of girls fall for him.\u201cOh man, I\u2019m done for. Xu Xiaoshou is so cute!\u201d\u201cGo to h*ll! Xu Xiaoshou is mine!\u201dSome of the girls were falling head over heels for him, but there were even more who had questions about him.\u201cD*mn, he sure knows how to make an entrance. Why is someone at Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight wielding a sword anyway?\u201d\u201cYeah, indeed. Isn\u2019t flying an ability only available at the Innate Stage? Did Xu Xiaoshou really get to that stage in just a single night?\u201d\u201cImpossible. Just look at his aura. That\u2019s an eight right there.\u201d\u201cWait, why is this guy\u2026 flying so slow?\u201dOne of them mentioned this and everyone else slowly recovered from the awe that Xu Xiaoshou had inspired in them. All of them had puzzled looks on their faces.Being able to ride one\u2019s sword and fly was indeed splendid, yet the speed at which he was flying\u2026Gosh, I can walk faster than you can fly!If it wasn\u2019t for the wind blowing so strong today, his clothes wouldn\u2019t even be billowing.Xu Xiaoshou simply flew at such a leisurely speed with his back to everyone else, as if only by moving at such slow speeds could he fully display his current state of mind.\u201cJust wait for it\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy does he have his back facing us?\u201d someone else asked.Everyone had initially thought that Xu Xiaoshou was simply making an entrance and putting on airs, but then they discovered that something was off.Not only was the kid flying excruciatingly slow, but the whole time he was flying his butt was facing everyone else.It was as if he couldn\u2019t fly without facing backwards.Mu Zixi, who was in the ring, curiously looked up and blinked her eyes at his antics. She felt as if Xu Xiaoshou was there to jest.\u201cWon\u2019t you\u2026 get dizzy from flying backwards?\u201dXu Xiaoshou, who was on his black sword, slowly turned his head around while casting \u201cHiding Pain,\u201d doing his best to smile as he waved at the crowd.His neck felt sore, as if he hadn\u2019t slept right the night before.Which was the reason why he was flying backwards and was flying so slow\u2026Deep down, Xu Xiaoshou was howling and shouting. He wanted to fly forward and zip about like a bolt of lightning.But this stupid sword technique just wouldn\u2019t let him!He had worked on it for one whole night and found that the stupid black sword was only sapient when the tip of the blade was facing him.He didn\u2019t know the reason why he could no longer control the sword as soon as the tip was facing away from him. He tried hundreds of times before finally deciding to give up.After that, he finally managed to stand on the black sword, wanting to just fly out of his place, when he shot right back into his room instead.He was utterly baffled by how that particular Sword Soaring Technique worked backwards instead and had no choice but to turn around and fly with Hiding Pain activated.It took him over two hours to fly out of his place all the way to Chuyun Peak.Those two hours had taught him that there was yet another type of sickness brought about by disorientation.Sword-sickness.Bluurggghh.He fought the urge to throw up and waved as though nothing had happened to the people around him.While the process was nothing short of excruciating, the reward was indeed very, very lucrative.Impressed, Passive Points +664.Impressed, Passive Points +882.Envied, Passive Points +441.Envied, Passive Points +261.\u2026That process of flying got him over 4000 Passive Points, and those points were taking those from his brothers and sisters in training whom he met along the way.But of course, those were previous records.What was shown on the Information Bar at the moment was\u2026Suspected, Passive Points +563.Ridiculed, Passive Points +446.Belittled, Passive Points +337.\u2026Yeah, the points shot by over 2000 all of a sudden.As for the details\u2026\u201cWhatever, so long as I still keep earning Passive Points, I guess,\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou kept up his fa\u00e7ade as best he could while ignoring the earlier half of what was showing on the lines in the Information Bar.Below.Xiao Qixiu was feeling rather dizzy watching Xu Xiaoshou and didn\u2019t know what to say about him.He had almost shouted for the kid to get down as soon as he saw him in the first place.Yet, when he took a closer look, he\u2019d realized that the kid had only acquired bits of Sword Telepathy the day before and was surprised that the kid had actually learned how to use it in just a single night.That\u2019s a genius right there!He had only seen such a level of talent before in Su Qianqian.The way the technique was put to use was nonetheless baffling\u2026But still, a Sword Soaring Technique used backwards was still a Sword Soaring Technique, no?Yet, he also realized that Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t getting off of the sword after flying for quite a while and had actually taken to waving at the crowd instead.\u201cOh boy, you\u2019re not telling me that the kid doesn\u2019t even know that he\u2019s in the first match!\u201d he thought.Xiao Qixiu had finally had enough and shouted, \u201cXu Xiaoshou, you get down here and get on with the match already!\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked below him and was startled. His sword wobbled.\u201cMy gosh, I\u2019m flying so d*mn high!\u201d he thought.\u201cComing, coming right up\u2026\u201dThe audience was having a good laugh. Fights aside, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be able to bring joy to all around him every time he showed up.\u201cOh my god, I thought that dude was so d*mn surreal flying on a sword! Yet, he\u2019s flying backwards instead. Hahahahaha.\u201d\u201cD*mn, you\u2019re not telling me that he doesn\u2019t even know how to tell his way around? Man, my stomach is hurting so bad now.\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, go for it! You\u2019re almost at the barrier, steady yourself!\u201dEncouraged, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou grinned, realizing that someone was actually cheering him on. He got excited and sped up at the barrier right away.Crash!Clang, clang!That nightmarish noise that he\u2019d heard over and over throughout the night was there yet again.Due to having accelerated like that, he smacked right into the barrier all sprawled out. The black sword dropped to the ground after bashing against the barrier.Ridiculed, Passive Points +224.Ridiculed, Passive Points +446.Ridiculed, Passive Points +654.Xu Xiaoshou, \u201c\u2026\u201d.Mu Zixi, who was down there, grabbed her pigtails as she looked up at the scene and almost burst out laughing.She saw him slowly sliding down from the barrier from midair and shouted, \u201cWindcloud Token!\u201d\u201cHow are you going to get inside without the token?\u201d\u201cHey, you hear me out there?\u2026\u201dThere was no doubt that he could hear her from inside the ring. Even if he couldn\u2019t hear her, there were still a lot of people in the audience shouting the exact same thing.It was only then that he awkwardly fished the token out of the ring hanging around his neck and got inside the barrier.He finally sighed in relief after seeing the lines of ridicule in the Information Bar stop appearing.\u201cI was really in over my head,\u201d he thought.\u201cI\u2019d better make sure to master flying on a sword before ever doing this again.\u201dXiao Qixiu glared at Xu Xiaoshou, who gave him an apologetic look before turning around and saying to Mu Zixi, \u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201d\u201cOh my, you\u2019re so hilarious!\u201dComplimented, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, you\u2019re telling me that you couldn\u2019t see that she was laughing at me?\u201d he thought.\u201cGet ready!\u201dXiao Qixiu raised his right hand. Everyone immediately stopped joking around and became serious.This was the semi-finals after all. Despite the rather hilarious entrance, the match itself would nonetheless be spectacular and have many things that everyone could learn from.The audience all became quiet.\u201cThe match begins!\u201dXu Xiaoshou immediately became serious, manipulating sword will at his fingers and blasting beams of the sword at Mu Zixi.He charged at her right after blasting said beams.Mu Zixi was totally unfazed by the incoming blasts. She flung her pigtails backward and grinned right away.\u201cBe careful, Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cI\u2019m about to attack.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Violent GirlChapter 42: Violent GirlXu Xiaoshou saw the girl\u2019s hands, which she\u2019d been clenching, immediately extend right after she said this, and massive blasts of pitch-black particles came at him.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s spiritual energy inside burst right away, deflecting the pitch-black particles, and then he realized something.\u201cSeeds?\u201d he thought. \u201cThere\u2019s actually someone weird enough to fight using seeds?\u201dHe was puzzled and looked at the seeds spread all over the floor.\u201cWait, hold on.\u201cInnate\u2026 wood elemental?\u201dHe turned his attention to Mu Zixi again and seemed to once again recall that towering ancient tree that had shot a huge watermelon to the field.\u201cSeeds, ancient tree\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s pupils contracted as he came to realize something.\u201cPrecisely.\u201dMu Zixi seemed to know what he was thinking. She narrowed her eyes and grinned before clapping.\u201cLittle trees, get him!\u201dGo go go!Tens of ancient trees shot into the air in the blink of an eye and tried to blast him out of the barrier of the arena.Pfft!Blood sprayed in midair.He felt his lower body shiver. The trees were so forceful they almost broke his spine and killed him on the spot.\u201cDamn, that was unexpected\u2026\u201d he thought.He groaned in pain in midair. No one would have expected something like that to happen at the very start.People usually fought using blades of some sort, yet that little girl used seeds instead.\u201cInnate-level trees. That impact\u2026 d*mn, that\u2019s terrifying!\u201dHe managed to somehow get in control of his body while still in the air and scrambled to summon the black sword to get away riding the blade.However, a thick vine unexpectedly shot into the air and wrapped around him before pulling him down hard.\u201cSh**!\u201d he cursed right then and there. That was a weakness of fighting up close: one could be caught in their opponent\u2019s combos right away.Before he could even react, he felt his vision go black.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d he thought.He was completely confused.\u2026Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t realize what was happening due to being caught in the middle of the action, but the spectators well knew what was going on.As soon as he was sent flying, a massive array beneath him immediately shifted, making space right in the center.Then, a thick vine immediately emerged out of a tree and dragged him into that ancient tree\u2019s array.\u201cEverything is going as planned,\u201d Mu Zixi thought to herself. She clenched her fists, shaking hard.A booming rumble was heard as the trunks crashed into each other and twisted into a single entity, leaving only the crown swaying elegantly about.The arena was silent.The spectators\u2019 eyes twitched as they seemed to clearly hear the sound of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s bones snapping.\u201cGosh, the girl is really going overboard.\u201d\u201cOh heavens, she smiles like an angel, but she sure as h*ll doesn\u2019t fight with the mercy of one\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk, I never knew you were like this, Sister Mu\u2026 umm, no, Demon Mu!\u201dThe ancient trees were crushed and twisted into a single entity, forming a single super tree formed from over a dozen trees mashed together. Everyone felt that Xu Xiaoshou was doomed and had become sustenance for the tree.\u201cHehehe.\u201dMu Zixi seemed to smile even brighter. She found the tree of incredible thickness very cute.She then turned around and ran, coming to the edge of the barrier.\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d everyone present thought, puzzled. Even Xiao Qixiu\u2019s pupils contracted. He sensed that something terrible was about to happen.\u201cHeh!\u201dThe girl continued flashing that beaming smile of hers as she clapped her hands. Then she shouted in a cute voice, \u201cExplode!\u201dThe arena was silent for a moment.Booooom!A massive mushroom cloud rose into the sky.The tree exploded, immediately leaving a crater behind in the arena. The explosion was so massive that it even sent Xiao Qixiu, who was caught off guard, flying from the shockwave.He quickly defended his body with spiritual source and steadied himself as he hovered midair.Hsssss.Everyone turned to look at the arena again. The middle-aged man and the audience gasped when they saw what had happened.The tree that had wrapped around Xu Xiaoshou had been reduced to dust after the explosion, shooting everywhere.However, the dust had quickly taken root after landing, coalescing into massive amounts of seeds before sprouting.\u201cOh man\u2026 she really is trying hard to kill whoever she\u2019s fighting.\u201d\u201cMy gosh, does she need to be that violent? Even if Xu Xiaoshou survives this, will he be able to take the next attack?\u201dMu Zixi, who had just finished her explosive art in the ring, frowned slightly.Knowing that her regular attacks wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat someone with an Innate-level physique, she\u2019d really brought her best to the fight.She\u2019d taken it to such a degree that she\u2019d even feared for her own safety when bringing about that last explosion.Yet she was still able to sense through the seed that she\u2019d secretly planted into him that the man was still alive.\u201cHe\u2019s not dead?\u201d she thought.\u201cIs this Xu Xiaoshou a cockroach or something?\u201dShe was secretly frustrated, as she was able to sense through that very seed she\u2019d planted that the lifeforce in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body was still brimming.\u201cHmm, maybe I could try that trick next.\u201dThe mushroom cloud finally dissipated altogether, and it was thanks to her not daring to get close for the time being that he was actually able to recover for quite a bit through Eternal Vitality.But still, he was all covered in blood and many of his bones were broken.That explosion was definitely more effective than what Liu Zhen had done back then. It was fortunate that the explosion hadn\u2019t taken place from the inside out, as he wouldn\u2019t have been able to even stand after that.\u201cThat innate something is really something\u2026\u201dFirst there was Zhao Qingteng\u2019s icy sword, and now there was Mu Zixi\u2019s ancient trees. Xu Xiaoshou really envied such innate elemental powers, as they were just too powerful.He thought that if he had such powers, he wouldn\u2019t have been restricted to fighting up close and personal.There were only so many ranged attacks one could do, so he refrained from charging at her right away, choosing to stand his ground instead.Both of them were at a stalemate, and the audience was getting impatient.\u201cIs that Xu Xiaoshou really an idiot or something? Why isn\u2019t he attacking? Is he like waiting for the trees to sprout again?\u201dOn the surface, both indeed looked like they had stopped moving altogether, yet the seeds spread by that explosion had all landed, covering the entire ring.One could even say that Mu Zixi had all the advantage of terrain she needed at that moment.Barrier of the Wood Element.\u201cEat this, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dMu Zixi was in no mood to wait for long. She clapped her hands again, and the seeds cracked, sending trees shooting upwards.Go go go!Ancient trees shot out from the ground in all directions. It was no longer just a dozen or so trees in the ring. One could easily tell with one glance that there were over one hundred trees in the arena.Worse still, that number was still growing.The audience didn\u2019t dare to look at what was about to happen next. If another explosion happened, Xu Xiaoshou would definitely lose his limbs, even with an Innate-level physique.He might even lose his head from the explosion.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou took out a scabbard?\u201dEveryone turned to look at him, feeling curious.As the trees kept shooting up to the sky, Xu Xiaoshou moved as if he had eyes all over his body. His body flashed as he zipped in and out between the trees, moving as if he were a monkey.He actually took out a scabbard after landing on a narrow spot on the ground that wasn\u2019t covered in seeds.\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said. The girl gave this warning to him each time she attacked him, so he now saw it fit to return the favor.As soon as he finished saying this, all the seeds on the ground and the trees which had taken form all began to tremble as if they were running out of control.He closed his eyes, and right then and there he felt as if he\u2019d returned to the day before.The garden is vast, and where shall the sword will go?Mu Zixi opened her eyes wide. She was puzzled as to why she was unable to tell where all the sword will around her was coming from.\u201cFrom Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword?\u201d she thought.\u201cOr the seeds on the ground?\u201cOr\u2026\u201cMe?\u201dMu Zixi sensed how ridiculous her thoughts had become, yet she was actually able to sense the sword will rising from above her head.\u201cAm I actually Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s sword?\u201dThe girl shook her head, flapping her pigtails about as she dispelled that ridiculous thought from her mind.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Xu Xiaoshou BloomedChapter 43: Xu Xiaoshou BloomedIn midair.Xiao Qixiu was thoroughly shocked. He\u2019d thought the kid\u2019s \u201cSword Soaring Technique in Reverse\u201d was already the greatest out of what Xu Xiaoshou had acquired, not realizing that said technique was but the beginning.\u201cWho was it who taught him \u2018All Things are Swords\u2019?\u201d he thought.\u201cWho in Tiansang Spirit Palace is more capable with a sword than me?\u201cFurthermore\u2026\u201cI understand how \u2018All Things are Swords\u2019 is at work now, but how is it possible that even Mu Zixi is emanating sword will? Just what the hell is happening right now?\u201cDo you even realize that she\u2019s human, kid?\u201dFrom Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s perspective, anything and anyone could indeed be a vessel for \u201cAll Things are Swords,\u201d but then again, he was still only half-way through his research.Using his Spiritual Energy, he expelled the seed Mu Zixi had secretly planted in him, causing a startled expression to appear on her face, as she knew that her cover was blown.Things around them continued to rumble. While Xu Xiaoshou was in a serene state, he was nonetheless all wrapped up by the trees.While everyone was still anxiously waiting, he silently sheathed Hiding Pain in its scabbard.And all the sword will around them dissipated all at once.He seemed to have given up resisting and was letting the trees grow into a forest.The audience was baffled.\u201cWhat the hell? That\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cI thought he was prepping for some ultimate move, yet there wasn\u2019t even a single fart in the end.\u201d\u201cHe gave up just like that? Well, good for him, I guess. Sister Mu may just go easy\u2026\u201dMu Zixi go easy?What kind of a joke was that?The girl saw Xu Xiaoshou sheath his sword and knew right away that something was off, yet she was unable to place what exactly was wrong. As such, she simply took the initiative to strike first.\u201cHere I come!\u201dShe clapped her hands again, and over one hundred trees throughout the entire ring immediately rushed at Xu Xiaoshou.Some in the audience had already closed their eyes, not wanting to see Xu Xiaoshou be reduced to mush.Xu Xiaoshou was actually still utterly unfazed in the face of the howling, towering trees rushing at him.He simply waited with his aura being still. He unsheathed his sword an inch before returning it to its sheath.\u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d\u201cDid he unsheathe his blade?\u201d\u201cDid he just put his blade back?\u201dDespite being surrounded by the trees, there were still some who were able to see his movements through whatever gaps were left between the trees, and they were all very curious.The very next second, all of the trees stopped moving, and a rumbling sound was heard. Mu Zixi was sent flying by a tree shooting up from beneath her.Everyone was puzzled. What just happened?Did Mu Zixi just go crazy all of a sudden?Was that a misfire?In the front row of the audience, Su Qianqian leaned forward and craned her neck, her eyes filled with wonder.Others might not have seen what happened, but she, as someone with innate sword will, had clearly sensed it all.The moment Xu Xiaoshou unsheathed his sword an inch, the blade immediately cut several falling leaves in half.That was some utterly terrifying swordplay at work.First, the All Things are Swords, then his will being given form, before all that ambient sword will returned to the scabbard.He had unleashed a terrifying circular cutting power the instant he unsheathed his sword an inch.As expected, the roots of all the trees that had suddenly been stopped in their tracks were cut down. After remaining in place for a brief moment, the remains of the trees nonetheless came crashing into each other above him due to inertia.Boom!Yet another massive mushroom cloud was seen.Despite the one hundred trees all over the place at that moment, the mushroom cloud formed at that moment was an order of magnitude below the one before.Hsssss.It was only then that the audience realized that Xu Xiaoshou had actually cut down every single one of those trees with just one inch of his sword unsheathed.\u201cOh heavens, this\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a frightening rate of progress we\u2019re seeing in Xu Xiaoshou here. That move was just awesome!\u201d\u201cWuwuwu, that move alone was enough to make me fall in love with him.\u201dLeaves fell all over the ring in shredded pieces.Xu Xiaoshou unsheathed his sword and stood at the then pockmarked ring. The air of awesomeness that he was basking in was enough to daze anyone within sight.But, despite having turned the tables in his favor in such a splendid fashion, he was frowning.He\u2019d performed that move with flying colors and was very satisfied with his own performance. He saw no reason why Mu Zixi would discover all that sword will he\u2019d hidden so well.Yet, just to evade that move, she opted to shot herself out of range with a tree instead\u2026Why?Mu Zixi, who was hovering in midair at the moment, was still reeling from the shock, her heart continuing to race.She wondered if she would\u2019ve been decapitated if it hadn\u2019t been for that seed she\u2019d secretly planted in Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cD*mn you, Xu Xiaoshou. You dared pull something like that\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, my turn for something big next.\u201dShe threw a seed into the air above her. It burst in midair and immediately propelled her forward, sending her flying at Xu Xiaoshou.The corners of Zhao Qingteng\u2019s mouth twitched. This girl was really bold. Was him getting his chest pierced not enough of a lesson for her?Everyone was puzzled by what was happening. Another one who dared to close in on Xu Xiaoshou?To them, such a move was nothing less than a death wish.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes glittered. Close combat, eh? Perfect.The ground beneath him crumbled as he launched a punch at her, but the other party\u2019s counterattack baffled him.Mu Zixi was actually clenching her fist and throwing a punch at him as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the brat?\u201d he thought.\u201cIs she getting high from the fight or something?\u201dHowever, there was no mercy to be had in the match.Despite the possibility of rendering her arm totally useless if his punch connected, he nonetheless put all of his might behind the attack, seeing no need to go easy at all.Poof, poof, poof.The expected sound of bones cracking wasn\u2019t heard. Just when the punches were about to connect, the girl\u2019s punch dissolved into a mass of vines that coiled all over Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body.Forearms, shoulders, then everywhere else\u2026All of her body dissolved into vines and wrapped all around him.Xu Xiaoshou felt like he\u2019d punched cotton. It dissipated the force of his impact and sent him hurtling into the mass of vines instead.\u201cHehe, over here.\u201dHe heard the voice of the little girl behind him, and he turned around in fright, finding to his surprise that the mass of vines coiled all around him had materialized into a human shape behind him.\u201cMu Zixi!\u201d he thought.\u201cIs she a snake?\u201cHow did she manage to get behind me?\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201dXu Xiaoshou used all his power to try and push her away, but to no avail.Hmmphh.He then felt a sharp pain in his kidneys. He glanced below and saw that her legs had turned into thorns and were stabbing into his midsection.\u201cSh**! Don\u2019t do anyth\u2026 arrghh!\u201dIt was when he wanted to pull the thorns away that he found his shoulder joints had been pierced by roots, robbing him of any control he had over his arms and making them lay completely still.\u201cYou parasite! Get off me!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou panicked. He found this wretched way of combat utterly disgusting.The only part of his body he could still move at the moment was his head, so he turned around and bit, but he missed the mark altogether.\u201cYou dare say that I\u2019m a parasite, huh?\u201dMu Zixi was angered. She then pouted and said, \u201cBloom, then.\u201dPoof!A red flower emerged from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s head and swayed about, looking alluring.\u201cHahaha!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou bloomed!\u201d\u201cOh heavens, why is this so funny? Isn\u2019t this a battle? Can\u2019t you two be a little more serious?\u201dThe audience erupted into laughter. Su Qianqian, who had been worried sick before the battle, had to cover her mouth to contain her laughter.While everyone else was having a good laugh, Xu Xiaoshou was panicking, as his entire body had been paralyzed.He was completely dumbfounded.\u201cWhen did another seed get into my body?\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd why wasn\u2019t I able to detect it?\u201cStealth at its finest indeed!\u201dIt was bad enough that he had a flower blooming above his head. Worse still, that flower was continuously injecting paralytic toxins into his body, preventing him from moving at all.By this point, he was basically meat on a cutting board.He was confident that he had never underestimated his opponent. He\u2019d even put that Blade-draw Technique he had developed the night before to good use. Yet, even still, his opponent had rendered him completely immobile all the same.\u201cGosh, the girl is really d*mn frightening,\u201d he thought.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Passive VictoryChapter 44: Passive VictoryThe fight was a deadlock.Xu Xiaoshou, who had a flower coming out of his head, stood on the ground, not moving at all.Mu Zixi, who was right behind him, had her legs stabbed into his midsection while her hands pierced through his shoulders. Her head with the pigtails was the only part of her body she could move.Under the crowd\u2019s stunned gaze, she took a whiff of Xu Xiashou\u2019s aura.Ohhhh.\u201cThat\u2019s the taste I\u2019ve been looking for!\u201d she moaned, looking as if she were high.That burst of vibrant life force that had been around since the start was very enticing to her, and she\u2019d finally gotten her hands on him after doing all she could.Who could resist it? Literally no one.\u201cYum, here I go!\u201dSh**!Xu Xiaoshou felt a shiver run down his spine when he heard that. Despite being unable to see what was happening, he could nonetheless imagine what was going on.Noooooo.Chomp!Mu Zixi bared her shinny canines and bit hard into the artery in his neck.The spectators were all stunned and gasped at what she was doing.\u201cH*ll, is it alright to do that?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the referee going to do something about it?\u201dXiao Qixiu didn\u2019t want to think about what was about to happen, but Xu Xiaoshou shot him a look.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he thought.\u201cIs he telling me to leave him be?\u201cOr is he telling me to save him?\u201cWhatever. Mu Zixi should know what she\u2019s doing, and that kid, he needs a lesson anyway.\u201dHe saw the satisfied look on the girl\u2019s face and was able to sense the spike in her lifeforce in a short period of them.Tsk, tsk.Xiao Qixiu had had enough of it and decided to save Xu Xiaoshou.But he was stunned when he saw the look on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face.Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cWhy does he look like he\u2019s enjoying this too, eh?\u201d he thought.\u2026He had indeed panicked in the beginning, as anyone would\u2019ve at a vampire stabbing them in their kidneys. But he had quickly calmed himself down, realizing that Mu Zixi was actually sucking more on his lifeforce than his blood.If he hadn\u2019t already been paralyzed, the high almost would have had him moaning too.But if there was one thing that he had more of than anyone else, it was lifeforce.Eternal Vitality at the innate level meant that his lifeforce was practically inexhaustible. Lifeforce would burst from within as soon as he was injured\u2014an effect deemed more insane than taking drugs.As such, he watched how his lifeforce was sapped one second and then completely refilled the next.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that such energies couldn\u2019t leak out of the body, he would probably have even more left than what he had.It was then that she noticed that something was off and wondered why the lifeforce in this guy just kept flowing without end.If he were an average being, he would\u2019ve already been rendered a dried corpse.Yet, to tell her to stop at such a moment\u2026That would be asking for the impossible.Her face was all red, as if she were drunk, and she was sucking on the lifeforce as hard as she could with a look that suggested that she was completely hooked.There was just no stopping it.It was worth noting that such a raging, vibrant lifeforce was utterly irresistible to Mu Zixi, who was of the wood element.Some among the audience noticed that something wasn\u2019t right and wondered if something terrible would happen if she just kept sucking like that.\u201cWhat the hell is Sister Mu sucking at? Is it really just lifeforce? Is it possible for someone to have that much lifeforce?\u201dSome in the audience were frightened and wondered if Xu Xiaoshou would immediately be reduced to ash when Mu Zixi finally stopped.\u201cWait, no. Take a look at his face. That kid\u2019s lifeforce seems practically limitless\u2026\u201d\u201cBut well, how is this possible? Can someone with an Innate-level physique really be that powerful? Gosh, what a monster!\u201d\u201cHufff\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess you could get an Innate-level body and find out for yourself\u2026\u201dSomeone then pointed at the ring and yelled, \u201cLook! Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s moving!\u201dXu Xiaoshou had indeed regained some level of mobility.As time passed, he could sense that the girl behind him had evidently gotten drunk, because that \u201cflower of paralysis\u201d on his head wasn\u2019t working so well anymore.Xu Xiaoshou kept quiet and did his best to wrestle control of his body back.It didn\u2019t take long for him to begin moving his head slightly.\u201cCalm down,\u201d he thought. \u201cThink. I can\u2019t let her find out.\u201dXu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes, and a smirk appeared on his face.The Glow of Sharpness coalesced on his hair, which ended up enabling him to cut that red flower down after vibrating his head for a tiny bit.\u201cD*mn, why is the flower gone already?\u201dThe spectators, who were far away, were obviously unable to see it, as even Xiao Qixiu, who was airborne at the moment, was unable to see the exact moment the flower dropped.Yet everyone was able to see that Mu Zixi was finished.It was obvious that the girl had gotten addicted. Her eyes were narrowed to slits as she sucked away, her teeth still sunken into his neck.Xu Xiaoshou had managed to wrestle basic control of his body back, yet his shoulders and kidneys were still pinned, so he didn\u2019t dare to do anything rash just yet.The Glow of Sharpness was put to work again as he sent it to those four parts and then shook.Swoop.All four thick vines that were lodged inside his body were immediately cut down.He quickly twisted around, grabbing at Mu Zixi\u2019s neck, and had her controlled from behind.\u201cUhh, let me go. I wanna suck more!\u201dShe looked dazed\u2014a testament that her will had been all but washed away by that raging lifeforce. She flailed about, grabbing his hand, and was about to bite again.He grabbed at her chin with his left hand right away and tilted her head high.\u201cMmm, wet me woo\u2026\u201d\u201cSuu\u2026\u201d\u201cGooo\u2026\u201d Mu Zixi mumbled in a dreamy state.Requested, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018What do you mean \u2018requested?\u2019\u201d he thought. \u201cShe\u2019s been sucking my blood this whole time!\u201dHe then looked up at Xiao Qixiu, trying to ask what was going on with her.The look on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s face was just as puzzled as his. \u201cShouldn\u2019t Mu Zixi be attacking now?\u201d he thought. \u201cHow come the tables got turned all of a sudden just like that?The one sucking was dazed while the one being sucked on was puzzled.Does Xu Xiaoshou have some kind of poison in him?This was the first time he\u2019d seen someone\u2019s passive ability bagging said someone a win.He then waved his hand and said, \u201cThe battle is o\u2026\u201dMu Zixi came to her senses all of a sudden and shouted, \u201cHold on!\u201d Then she shook her head slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she thought. \u201cWhy am I the one being pinned by Xu Xiaoshou instead? What just happened?\u201dThe girl looked like someone who\u2019d just gotten sober, and she turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou with a puzzled look on her face.\u201cLet me go!\u201dXu Xiaoshou stared at her and thought for several seconds before covering her mouth all of a sudden.\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cMmmmm!\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201d\u201cMmmmm!\u201d\u201cYou wanna talk?\u201dChomp. Mu Zixi bit him again.Sh**, oww! He then yanked her hair upward and yelled, \u201cAre you a dog or something?\u201dHe hoisted her up and charged to the edge of the ring.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe only thing in her eyes by this time was panic, and countless vines shot out of her body all of a sudden.Xu Xiaoshou smirked. \u201cYou kidding me?\u201d he thought. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now. Or do you think this Innate-level physique of mine is just for show?\u201dHe then strangled her with his right hand.Cough, cough.Mu Zixi was immediately choked by her own spit, causing the vines to break off.\u201cWeettt meee\u2026\u201dBoom!He then threw the biting girl over the ring without a second thought, then walked away with great strides.Then he wiped the drool off of his neck and smelled it, his face twisting into a grimace.\u201cGosh, that stinks!\u201dMu Zixi glared at him with teary eyes and almost climbed into the ring.Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1,+1,+1,+1,+1\u2026Xiao Qixiu waved his hand, a rather tired look on his face.\u201cThe battle is over. The winner is Xu Xiaoshou.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: He\u2019s HopelessChapter 45: He\u2019s Hopeless\u201cWait, he won? Just like that?\u201dThe audience was utterly confused, and even some of the fighters from the Inner Yard were puzzled by what they saw.It was probably the most puzzling win in the history of the Outer Yard fights.The one who\u2019d lost was just as puzzled as the one who\u2019d won.\u201cThe first half of the fight was splendid, so why did things take a weird turn in the second half?\u201d\u201cYou done asking? It\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou, that\u2019s why. An outcome like that is actually pretty normal as far as Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s concerned\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha, I\u2019ve watched all of the matches with him in it, and boy, the match isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s if the outcome isn\u2019t anything less than weird.\u201d\u201cYeah, but this is the semi-finals\u2026\u201dSome still found the outcome totally unbelievable and were wondering why the semi-finals, which had been nothing short of utterly intense the past years, had ended so messily today.Doubted, Passive Points +664.Doubted, Passive Points +121.No one knew what to think about the match.Spectators aside, even Xu Xiaoshou himself was baffled by the whole deal.He actually had to attribute his victory to that bite from Mu Zixi. Otherwise, who was to say what the final outcome would\u2019ve been.If it hadn\u2019t been for that greedy bite from her, causing her to be paralyzed long enough for him to throw her off of the ring, he might\u2019ve been the one to bite the dust.But then again, like it or not, that was reality.He straightened up, then gestured at the crowd as he walked, feeling very pleased with himself as he checked on the Passive Points he earned from all the doubt cast on him.Very nice.The barrier shut out information from the outside once he walked into the waiting area, yet lines kept popping up all the same.Doubted, Passive Points +2.Doubted, Passive Points +2.\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou glanced at the two staff, who were standing frozen in place, and flashed an awkward grin.Walking forward with a win, leaving the question marks behind in the dust\u2026The man who\u2019d gotten into the finals thanks to his passive skills got into his changing area, where he washed himself and his clothes of all that dirt and bloodstains before returning to the chair to meditate.Xu Xiaoshou took out a piece of Spirit Crystal and sniffed it, thinking back on the fight.He had to admit that Mu Zixi was indeed powerful.This was a girl who\u2019d opened his eyes to other avenues of combat. He was thoroughly impressed by different ways combat could take place at Innate levels.\u201cZhao Qingteng, Mu Zixi\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I guess Zhou Tianshen could count,\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou started looking forward the growth he would experience after getting to the Innate Stage.In his mind, he imagined that he probably would no longer be limited by those passive skills and could truly shine and beat countless others out there.\u201cBut then again,\u201d he thought, \u201cI\u2019m probably limited because I wasn\u2019t able to collect more useful passive skills because I didn\u2019t have enough time.\u201dHis eyes narrowed as he figured that it\u2019d been too short of a time since he acquired the Passive Skill System.Despite having earned Passive Points in a frenzy the whole time, he hadn\u2019t been able to get more than six Passive Skills, which had barely managed to get him to the finals. That had definitely been hard work.His level and number of skills could possibly get higher if he were to be given more time, so much so that he\u2019d be okay with not gaining any Innate Elemental Powers.Xu Xiaoshou nodded furiously. \u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201dThe two staff members stuck close to the corner of a wall and whispered among themselves, \u201cThere he goes again\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was exasperated by the two\u2019s antics.\u201cYou guys really have no idea that I\u2019ve gained Sense eh?\u201d he thought.\u201cHmph.\u201dHe turned around and took out a Spiritual Cultivation Pill, took a deep whiff, and rapidly recovered.The best plan he had at the moment was actually to head out and watch Mo Mo fight, but his injuries from fighting Mu Zixi were rather grievous.While Eternal Vitality alone was capable of healing his injuries, it would still take time. As such, he simply closed his eyes, shutting the outside world out, and devoted his energies to recovery.A staff member came over and woke him up a while later.\u201cThe match is on?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dThe staff member then handed him a letter. \u201cThis is from Elder Qiao.\u201dHis eyebrows twitched. What was so important that it needed to be delivered in a letter?\u201cWell, makes sense, I guess,\u201d he thought. \u201cElder Qiao\u2019s probably watching the battle now and couldn\u2019t come here personally, so he had to send a letter. It probably only got to me because an elder delivered it.\u201dHe then tore the envelope open. There were only two words on it:Sealing Technique.Woff.Spiritual Energies burst and burned the letter, and he lapsed into deep thought.\u201cWhat does \u2018Sealing Technique\u2019 mean?\u201d he wondered.\u201cDoes this have anything to do with my fight with Mo Mo in the finals?\u201d\u201cThe only thing that would have anything to do with this are the upcoming finals, and there\u2019s no doubt that my next opponent will be Mo Mo.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, I don\u2019t think anyone has seen what that Outer Yard big sister can actually do\u2026\u201d\u201cShe threw everyone she fought out of the ring with just several strikes. Does that have something to do with \u2018Sealing Technique\u2019 here?\u201d\u201cIs that some kind of Innate Elemental Power as well?\u201d\u201cHow does this sealing thing work by the way? Sealing one\u2019s Spiritual Energy?\u201dThat letter had apparently brought him more questions than answers, so he simply stopped thinking about it altogether.If it was something that worked by sealing Spiritual Energy, then the technique would technically not be of any use against him.He\u2019d hardly ever used Spiritual Energy in all of his fights so far, with the exception of the four moves of the Fleeting White Clouds.Even if he were to be short on Spiritual Energy, he could easily take out a Spiritual Cultivation Pill and bring the fight to a standstill for half a second, which would give him enough time to recover. So he saw no need for concern.\u201cCall me when the final match is on,\u201d he said to the staff member, and closed his eyes again to work on his sword will.The staff member agreed to it and sat down to have tea again.However, before the staff member could pick up the cup, it started shaking, and sword will rose all of a sudden, causing the tea inside to spill.The two staff members looked at each other, speechless.Cursed, Passive Points +2.The corners of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s mouth lifted upward slightly as he closed his eyes to train, causing the cup to shake even harder.Cursed, Passive Points +2, +2, +2, +2\u2026Whack!At the edge of the ring, Mo Mo launched a palm attack and sent her stout opponent flying out of the ring. Xiao Qixiu\u2019s voice was then heard.The audience was in awe. Everyone had suprised looks on their faces, yet, at the same time, they found the outcome reasonable.\u201cYet another show of slapping her opponent out of the ring with her left hand alone. Gosh, Sister Mo really\u2026 is just too powerful.\u201d\u201cYeah, even in the semifinals no one was able to corner her well enough to make her use her right hand that\u2019s cradling that bronze cauldron. That is really something indeed.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s in that pot anyway? I\u2019ve never seen her use it for anything.\u201d\u201cNo idea. Probably just something to keep her right hand from doing anything else, just to give her opponents hope\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 she\u2019s indeed powerful. I wonder if Xu Xiaoshou will be able to force her to use both of her hands\u2026\u201dMo Mo stood in the ring with her white garb billowing.Strictly-speaking, she had features so plain that she looked nothing more than ordinairy.Yet, due to all of those achievements of hers, no one could afford to ignore her.Zhang Xinxiong had a funny look on his face as he tilted his head and said, \u201cThis Mo Mo girl is formidable. If I were at the same early stage of Innate Origin Court Level as her, I probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to beat her.\u201dHe then paused and added, \u201cDrawing the fight out, that is.\u201dLiu Zhen was surprised.He spoke so highly of some girl who was so plain-looking, yet during the fight between Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Xizi, he hadn\u2019t said a word.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that if we were to fight Sister Mo, we\u2019d have to end it quickly?\u201dZhang Xinxiong nodded and answered, \u201cDefinitely. Every attack of hers comes with some special effect capable of decreasing her opponent\u2019s powers. It\u2019s a rather strange ability. I\u2019m not quite sure what it is.\u201d\u201cSome Innate Elemental Power that she possesses, I guess?\u201d\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201dLiu Zhen was rendered silent, wondering what kind of a special ability it could be.The most awakened powers among the fighters at Innate Stage was the power of the five elements. The more extraordinary such elements turned out to be, the more difficult said opponent would be.But then again, the prerequisite was that the possessor of such powers was familiar with their uses. Otherwise, it\u2019d simply be better to pray that one would acquire one of the mainstream five instead.Mo Mo was one such genius out of the ordinary. That eerie ability of hers to reduce her opponent\u2019s powers, coupled with her agile moves, enabled her to reign supreme as soon as the fight was drawn out.Liu Zhen recalled the battle in the breakout match with Xu Xiaoshou and said, \u201cBrother Xiong, what do you think of the upcoming final match?\u201d\u201cInnate Level Physique eh\u2026\u201dZhang Xinxiong shook his head as he recalled the hilarious figure of Xu Xiaoshou riding on his sword backwards, and giggled.He was unable to fathom just how someone like that had been able to make it to the final fight.He wondered if that kid was probably one of those so-called \u201clucky ones.\u201dHe shook his head slowly and said, \u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026 he\u2019s hopeless.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: The Terrifying Right HandChapter 46: The Terrifying Right HandXu Xiaoshou was stunned.In the first round, he\u2019d had to fight multiple opponents. During the preliminary round, he\u2019d had to take down both Liu Zhen, a Level 10 cultivator, and Wen Chong, who ranked seventh on the Windcloud Board. Then, in the advancement round, he\u2019d been pitted against Zhou Tianshen, who was but a step away from breaking through to the Innate Stage, and Zhao Qingteng, who had reached the Innate Stage\u2026Even more, it\u2019d turned out that Zhou Tianshen had an Acquired-stage Blade Will, and Zhao Qingteng, an Acquired-stage Sword Will!In the mid-finals, he\u2019d had to face off with the \u201cparasite\u201d and \u201cvampire\u201d Mu Zixi\u2026In fighting his way through the Windcloud Competition, he\u2019d had to overcome arduous obstacles and take down powerful foes. The hardships he\u2019d endured had been immense, and the labors he\u2019d suffered arduous.Xu Xiaoshou was convinced that he was the most unfortunate man in this world.\u201cLook at Mo Mo,\u201d he thought. \u201cShe only needed one hand to fight all her matches.\u201d\u201cWhat a heart-breaking, despairing juxtaposition\u2026\u201dFeeling a sudden coolness on his cheek, Xu Xiaoshou slowly woke up and saw a helpful attendant cleaning his face for him. He was moved by the gesture.\u201cIs it time for the finals?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the attendant briefly replied, flinging the rag back into his basin. His eyes followed Xu Xiaoshou as the latter strode into the distance.\u201cHow laid-back must a person be to catch a nap right before the finals?\u201d he thought.\u201cImpressed, Passive Points +1.\u201dSuddenly, Xu Xiaoshou whirled around and gave the attendant a fright. The latter shoved his basin behind his back and hid the rag from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s view.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked bemused. He summoned Hiding Pain and then, with his back toward the door, leaped into the air.The black sword slowly glided through the air. Atop the blade stood a man who looked every bit the young and dashing gentleman.The attendant stared in silence.\u201cCursed, Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cWhy does the young man have to turn away from his sword before jumping onto it?\u201d he thought. \u201cCouldn\u2019t he have gotten onto it the normal way?\u201cDoesn\u2019t he know he might give someone the wrong idea by looking at them like that?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was incredulous. Had he just been cursed for no reason at all?He had a niggling feeling that there was something wrong with the two attendants in his waiting area. It was all right though. After this round, he probably wouldn\u2019t ever see them again.He waved goodbye to the two losers who had only managed to grant him two Passive Points.\u2026 \u2026\u201cRidiculed, Passive Points +449.\u201d\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +224.\u201d\u201cImpressed, Passive Points +3.\u201dXu Xiaoshou cheered up as soon as he stepped out of the waiting area. With the Windcloud Token in one hand, he vigorously turned his head from side to side, displaying his sincerest smile to all.Where the crowds were, there lay his battleground.Look at those Passive\u2026 \u2026Hmm?How come only three people were impressed with him?These mere mortals who couldn\u2019t even fly\u2014what gave them the right to ridicule him?At the thought, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s black sword rose further into the heavens, as if complying with his desire to put a greater distance between himself and those mere mortals.\u201cRidiculed, Passive Points +541.\u201d\u201cRidiculed, Passive Points +623.\u201dHmm?This was an unexpected boon.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes shone with glee as he rose further into the heavens.\u201cRidiculed, Passive Points +777.\u201dThat was incredible\u2026One more time!\u201cRidiculed, Passive Points +864.\u201dNot bad. Not bad at all!Keep this up\u2026\u201cOuch!\u201dSuddenly, he felt something bump against the top of his head\u2026They were in the skies. Had he just gotten himself into an aviation accident?Xu Xiaoshou looked up.The look on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s face was as dark as a storm cloud. His right hand gripped the long sword behind his back as he said in a deadpan voice, as if he were speaking to a dead man, \u201cGo on, keep flying. Don\u2019t worry, you can go much higher than that.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s the esteemed and venerable judge himself!\u201d he thought, nearly dying from fright.Heavens!Xu Xiaoshou smiled sheepishly as he plunged back into the barrier.\u201cHahaha! That Xu Xiaoshou! I can\u2019t believe him!\u201dThe spectators nearly fell over with laughter. No one else could drive Elder Xiao as mad as Xu Xiaoshou.On the other side.Mo Mo had not left the arena at all. Instead, she\u2019d rested onstage, naturally witnessing Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s advancement through the tournament.Her lips curled upward into a smile. \u201cXu Xiaoshou, I\u2019ve been watching you since the first round of the tournament. You have a\u2026\u201d She deliberated for a long moment before finally deciding on the appropriate description. \u201cA great sense of humor.\u201d\u201cPraised, Passive Point +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou kept staring at her bronze furnace. To be more precise, he was staring at her right hand, which was cradling the bronze furnace.\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty!\u201dThe unexpected compliment brought a blush to Mo Mo\u2019s cheeks. This was the first time someone had called her pretty to her face.She was deliberating if she should return the compliment when she heard Xu Xiaoshou hastily add, \u201cI meant the bronze furnace.\u201dMo Mo didn\u2019t say a word.Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head then. He had a feeling that he shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty too, of course. Pretty in a different way.\u201dMo Mo remained silent.\u201cCursed, Passive Points +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was incredulous.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought. \u201cI complimented her on her beauty. Why did she curse me?\u201d\u201cWomen!\u201dHe stepped forward, seemingly drawn toward the bronze furnace. He looked as if he would really like to touch it, yet found such a thought inappropriate. Finally, he couldn\u2019t help himself and blurted out, \u201cCan I take a look at that?\u201dMo Mo looked as if she wanted to say something. In the end, she stuck her hand out and handed the bronze furnace over.If someone else had asked, he would have had to keep dreaming, but this guy\u2026Forget it. He had kind of complimented her just now. She was going to take his words as a compliment.A quick look wouldn\u2019t hurt.Having gotten Mo Mo\u2019s permission, Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward and grabbed her right hand with his soft, warm fingers.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dMo Mo yanked her hand away, as if she\u2019d just been shocked by a jolt of electricity, leaving the bronze furnace cradled within Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm.Xu Xiaoshou stared at her in shock. He lowered his eyes, his gaze falling on her right hand. That was when he seemed to realize what had just happened.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That was rude of me. I was simply drawn to the bronze furnace. I didn\u2019t mean to suggest anything else\u2026\u201d he apologized profusely.\u201c\u2026don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dMo Mo sighed in relief and shrugged slightly. The young man looked really earnest. It had probably been an accident.The spectators were bewildered by the two contestants\u2019 interactions. Why were they being so polite?They had complimented each other. Their hands had touched. Why didn\u2019t they just hold hands and announce their joint victory as well as the end of the tournament?\u201cWhat are they up to? Why isn\u2019t the fight starting?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? Xu Xiaoshou is allowed his rest. Besides, he\u2019s just taking a look at a bronze furnace. Don\u2019t watch if you\u2019re not willing to wait!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so attractive about that bronze furnace?\u201d\u201cHehe, a mystical artefact that never leaves the hands of our number one cultivator on the Windcloud Board? I\u2019d like to have a look at it too!\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t do anything about what those spectators thought or felt. He pretended to seriously study the bronze furnace as his heart raced wildly inside his chest.He was right!His senses had been right!From the moment he stepped into the arena and his Sense enveloped the entire area, he had somehow detected an extraordinary and terrifying power within the barrier.After a long search, he had finally locked onto the bronze furnace resting in Mo Mo\u2019s right hand.But Sense couldn\u2019t discern clearly without physical contact. In order to touch her right hand, he had slowly but surely lured Mo Mo into his trap and finally gotten what he had set out to get.As soon as they touched, he had distinctly felt the power dwelling within Mo Mo\u2019s right hand and how it was many times more powerful than the spiritual energy residing in the rest of her body\u2026It was at least ten times more powerful!And it excluded any other powers that he couldn\u2019t identify.What the hell\u2026What kind of monster was she?Mo Mo had gotten into the finals by only fighting with her left hand!Xu Xiaoshou began to panic. He had a feeling that the opponent before him belonged in an entirely different league incomparable to the likes of Zhao Qingteng and Mu Zixi.He recalled the contents of Elder Qiao\u2019s letter.The Sealing Technique\u2026\u201cThis is scaring me. Does she have an entire arm sealed within her eye or something?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: I\u2019m Not Going to Joke Around Anymore!Chapter 47: I\u2019m Not Going to Joke Around Anymore!Xiao Qixiu raised his right hand above his head, signaling that the two of them could now get into position.Xu Xiaoshou calmly returned the small bronze furnace to Mo Mo before putting a significant distance between the both of them.\u201cAren\u2019t you a close-range fighter?\u201dMo Mo looked baffled as she watched Xu Xiaoshou retreat to the edge of the arena.She pointed to herself. \u201cSo am I,\u201d she said, implying that they could engage in close-range combat.Xu Xiaoshou laughed weakly. Close-range combat?Was she joking?He pulled out his sheath and shoved Hiding Pain into it. Then, after some thought, he unsheathed his sword. \u201cActually, I\u2019m a swordsman.\u201dMo Mo was silent.\u201cYou\u2019re an Innate-stage fighter, and an incredibly powerful one at that. Why don\u2019t you let me go first and have a few stabs at you?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou asked unabashedly.Everyone on the bleachers rolled their eyes. Just look at that. Was that what a decent human being would say?Did he have no shame at all?They didn\u2019t expect Mo Mo to nod.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cHaha, thanks a lot!\u201d After another short pause, Xu Xiaoshou added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep our distance!\u201dXiao Qixiu couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Xu Xiaoshou was really pushing it!He waved his hand. \u201cThe match starts now!\u201dMo Mo extended her hand, inviting Xu Xiaoshou to make the first move.Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He\u2019d thought she was just joking\u2026But she\u2019d kept her word. What an honest woman!He had to teach her a lesson. She had to learn that in this world, honest folks didn\u2019t live long.Xu Xiaoshou shut his eyes, and white clouds slowly started to take shape in the sky. The wind slowed to a whisper, and alongside it was the soft hiss of moving sand.\u201cSword Web Style!\u201dHe focused all his attention on that singular stroke of the blade.The move was an enhanced version of the original Sword Web Style. The beams of light unleashed by the sword no longer cast a two-dimensional web of crisscrossing blades. Instead, these blades of light intersected from all corners to weave a three-dimensional elongated cocoon.Even if his opponent possessed Zhao Qing-Teng\u2019s technique and could appear in another location by switching places with something else, they would still suffer the relentless assault from this web of intersecting blades as long as they didn\u2019t reappear behind him after his teleportation.There was no hint of fear on Mo Mo\u2019s face as she gently inhaled a wisp of sandalwood incense from her bronze furnace.Slowly, she reached out her left hand, and countless afterimages of that very hand instantly appeared.Clank! Clank! Clank!A series of crisp, clear, strange sounds rang out.Every time her left hand tapped on a glowing blade, the latter would vanish into thin air. The hundreds of blades in the web were all intercepted by her!The sight made Xu Xiaoshou cringe.\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cShe isn\u2019t human!\u201cDoes she know the Glow of Sharpness too?\u201dXu Xiaoshou recognized the spiritual technique that Mo Mo had unleashed. It was an ordinary spiritual technique that belonged to the Outer Yard, and was called the \u201cSpirit Snatching Hand.\u201dBut how could someone have attained such mastery over the Spirit Snatching Hand\u2026How could someone\u2019s hand move so quickly that it left afterimages in its wake? In fact, how could anyone catch a blade\u2019s beam with their bare hands?The Spirit Snatching Hand was meant to be a close-range spiritual technique!\u201cMy turn!\u201d Mo Mo\u2019s calves tensed momentarily before she sprung forward.Xu Xiaoshou was weeping with fear inwardly. She had the Sealing Technique. He wasn\u2019t interested in exchanging punches with her at all!Beams of light shot at Mo Mo, but they hardly slowed her down, and she was soon within arm\u2019s length.He mustn\u2019t allow her to touch him!Xu Xiaoshou cranked up Sense to the fullest and brought Hiding Pain into play, displaying for the first time the close-range swordsmanship that he had kept buried deep inside his head.Clank! Clank! Clank!Yet another round of extraordinary clashes rang loudly in the air.Xu Xiaoshou could sense Hiding Pain weaken with every hit that Mo Mo gave. After exchanging a dozen blows, he realized that Hiding Pain was whimpering.Damnit!A look of pain appeared on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face. If they kept this up, his sword might just end up irreparably damaged!\u201cI\u2019ll give you what you want! Close-range combat it is!\u201dHe placed Hiding Pain back in his ring. With a sudden step aside, he dodged an incoming punch, locked his fingers around Mo Mo\u2019s wrist like a vice, and sent his own fist flying at Mo Mo\u2019s chest.Thud!An experienced fighter, Mo Mo had instantly pulled her bronze furnace in front of her chest to block the blow. Regardless, the punch from an Innate Level Physique still managed to send her flying a dozen feet away.\u201cHe did it!\u201d The spectators rose to their feet excitedly.This was the first time they\u2019d seen someone exchange punches with Mo Mo and come out on top. What was even more incredible was how Xu Xiaoshou had driven Mo Mo into fighting with her right hand!\u201cAn Innate Level Physique is truly formidable. Keep it up, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cKeep going while you\u2019re ahead! Clinch the championship with a single shot!\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s not right. Look, Xu Xiaoshou looks terrible\u2026\u201dThe two fighters were standing on opposite sides of the arena. They had somehow put a considerable distance between them.Xu Xiaoshou cradled his fist, looking as if he were suffering from a terrible bout of constipation.There was no doubt that that was the Sealing Technique\u2026They had barely touched. In fact, she hadn\u2019t even hit him. Xu Xiaoshou could sense that a good half of his spiritual strength had been sealed after his punch landed.He would have been fine if that had been the end of it, but he had then realized\u2026\u2026that his physical strength had been sealed as well!In fact, he could no longer cloak his fist in the Glow of Sharpness!Xu Xiaoshou was beginning to panic. They\u2019d only exchanged one hit. If this match were like any other match with any other opponent and they\u2019d exchanged hundreds or even a thousand blows\u2026The seals still would\u2019ve rendered him as helpless as an adult-sized baby!An utterly powerless baby!\u201cHow terrifying! Why does such a horrible Innate Elemental Power exist in the first place?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was silently quaking in his boots.Mo Mo had her head slightly lowered as she cradled her right fist with her left hand. The tear that Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Glow of Sharpness had ripped across her hand was healing at an extraordinary rate.\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d She frowned as she lasped deep into thought.If Xu Xiaoshou had witnessed this sight, he would\u2019ve gasped at how alike they were. In fact, he might\u2019ve even concluded that the speed at which his opponent was healing surpassed his.But he was currently consumed by fear and was cowering like a coward. He chose not to go on the offensive.\u201cI suppose I have no choice but to use my sword\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou turned his gaze inwards, feeling the dying need to level up after their first exchange of blows.Passive Points: 28766.He unsheathed Hiding Pain once more, and his Sword Will flooded the arena, making it shake.\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 9).\u201d\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Acquired Lv. 10).\u201dAn ocean of knowledge flooded his brain. Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he could destroy the entire world with the knowledge that he now possessed.Yet, after scouring through it, he found that there was no way of getting out of his current predicament.\u201cOh man\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and sheathed Hiding Pain, his hand remaining firmly clasped around the hilt of his sword.Mo Mo had pulled her wandering mind back to the present moment. He stared at her with a serious look on his face.\u201cYou\u2019re really powerful!\u201d\u201cSo are you.\u201d Mo Mo smiled softly.\u201cPraised, Passive Point +1.\u201dA serious look came into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to joke around anymore.\u201d\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201dXu Xiaoshou exhaled softly.\u201cSword Technique Expertise (Innate Lv. 1)!\u201d\u2026 \u2026The spectators grew impatient as they watched the two fighters stop their fight once again for a chat.It was then that sudden tremors rippled across the Chuyun Platform and its ten thousand seats. The earth shook, and the mountain swayed.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIs it an earthquake?\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces turned pale as they started to panic. Xiao Qixiu looked puzzled and wary. Before he could say anything to calm everyone down, the sword on his back shot into the sky.The man was shocked.He wasn\u2019t the only one. Sharing in his confusion were the more than two thousand spectators in the crowd. Anyone bearing a sword found their swords humming in unison before sliding out of the sheath of their own will and dashing into the skies, only to hover in mid-air.\u201cClang, clang, clang\u2026\u201dUnder the azure skies, thousands of swords vibrated violently. The piercing whine of their metallic keening threatened to burst everyone\u2019s eardrums.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with Incredulity, and their gazes simultaneously landed on the handsome young man in the arena.His right hand was splayed across the hilt of his sword, and his back was slightly hunched. He was staring unblinkingly at his opponent.The sight sent alarm bells ringing inside Mo Mo\u2019s head. She charged at Xu Xiaoshou with the ferocity of a tiger racing down a mountain.\u201cBoom\u2026\u201dAt that very instant, a terrifying power erupted from Xu Xiaoshou and flung Mo Mo aside.His Sword Will rose with the clouds and surged heavenward. Amidst a cacophony of cracks and crackles, the barrier shattered.The visible, snow-white Sword Will pierced the stratosphere and shot straight into the heavens.Led by the Sword Will, thousands of spiritual swords formed a river of blades in the sky above Xu Xiaoshou, streaming in circles before shooting outwards like fireworks.With a thunderous explosion, swords flew across the skies, crashing from the heavens, and returned to their masters.\u201cHeavens!\u201d\u201cAn Innate-stage Sword Will?\u201dA hot flush reddened Xiao Qixiu\u2019s face while waves of coldness coursed through his body.He stared at the young man in the arena and the storm that his Sword Will had summoned with a look of utter disbelief. Yet, he couldn\u2019t not believe his eyes.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Sword Will had thrown Mo Mo off her earlier charge, viciously tearing into her and transforming her into a bloody, bleeding mess. Mo Mo did not pay any heed to that though. Her eyes were shining brightly as she stared at Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cIs that an Innate-stage Sword Will?\u201dXu Xiaoshou reveled in the terrifying power of his Sword Will and fought against the desire to unsheath his own sword.After a moment of contemplative silence, he nodded slightly.\u201cI guess so.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: The Shackles of Heaven and EarthChapter 48: The Shackles of Heaven and EarthThe Acquired-stage Sword Will could achieve resonance with all swords within a mile. The Innate-stage Sword Will could achieve resonance with all swords within ten miles.When everyone\u2019s swords returned to their sheaths, still resonating, everyone came to realize that they had just witnessed the Innate-stage Sword Will.\u201cHeavens, I\u2019m about to go crazy. Did Xu Xiaoshou attain the Innate-stage Sword Will?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible? He\u2019s making me die with envy!\u201d\u201cHow does this guy keep surprising us like this?\u201dThe spectators were so beside themselves with excitement that some even jumped onto their seats, but they were quickly slapped by the person sitting behind them.\u201cShit, am I dreaming?\u201d The person who\u2019d just smacked another spectator slapped himself on the cheek next before gasping aloud in pain.\u201cA swordsman with an Innate-stage Sword Will appears once every hundred years. Su Qianqian got her Innate-stage Sword Will a year ago, and now Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s got his too?\u201d\u201cIs that for real? What is the world coming to\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gone mad! It\u2019s gone absolutely mad!\u201dIn the arena, the fight had unexpectedly been interrupted by the emergence of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Innate-stage Sword Will. Nevertheless, it still had to go on.Mo Mo didn\u2019t interrupt Xu Xiaoshou as he advanced in level. Of course, if she had, Xiao Qixiu wouldn\u2019t have let her.She was the champion fighter in the Outer Yard, whereas Xu Xiaoshou was an Innate-stage swordsman. It was obvious who was more highly regarded out of the two.Even after the Sword Will emanating from Xu Xiaoshou faded away, the two fighters still didn\u2019t move.Mo Mo was a little puzzled. She hadn\u2019t moved, because she wanted to wait for Xu Xiaoshou to finish leveling up. But Xu Xiaoshou was done leveling up and still hadn\u2019t made a move. What was he up to?\u201cIs he grinning to himself?\u201d Mo Mo stared. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand was still on the hilt of his sword, and a dazed look had settled on his face. He looked like an absolute idiot.Xu Xiaoshou was going mad with glee.He hadn\u2019t expected the Sword Will\u2019s ascent into the heavens to pierce through the barrier. The torrent of points he\u2019d received was unbelievable!\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +674.\u201d\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +1876.\u201d\u201cImpressed, Passive Points +1940.\u201d\u201cImpressed, Passive Points +1120.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dThe slew of Passive Points was a profound narration of the emotional rollercoaster the spectators had experienced as they journeyed from doubt to shock and finally, to inevitable respect.That single breakthrough had raked in nearly ten thousand Passive Points!He had traded a thousand Passive Points for ten thousand Passives Points and vast amounts of knowledge on swordsmanship. He had but three words for the trade: what a bargain!Notifications continued to appear as Xu Xiaoshou lost himself in happy thoughts, although the figures were getting lower\u2026Hmm?Why had everyone begun to view him with suspicion\u2026He broke out of his reverie, turned around, and saw everyone staring at him as they would an idiot.\u201cAre you done?\u201d asked Mo Mo.Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily rendered speechless. Had they\u2026been waiting for him to level up and return to the present?Good god. He had just embarrassed himself!Fortunately, Mo Mo was a decent person and hadn\u2019t sneaked up on him and attacked him.Well, his Information Bar would have notified him of her sneak attack anyway\u2026Xu Xiaoshou exhaled. \u201cI\u2019m done. Let\u2019s continue the fight!\u201dA glint of a blade flashed across Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes just as Mo Mo was about to make her move.\u201cFleeting White Cloud Four: Blade-Draw Technique!\u201dIn the past, he would\u2019ve had to glimpse an inch of his blade before he could unsheath his sword.But now that he had advanced to the Innate Stage, his control over his Sword Will had drastically improved. The speed at which Xu Xiaoshou unsheathed his sword was quicker than the naked eye could see.Dust swept through the air, and when the spectators finally caught a glimpse of the glowing blade, it had already appeared right in front of Mo Mo.Clank!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyelid twitched. It was that sound again.That blade was his Innate-stage Sword Will distilled and condensed, yet somehow Mo Mo had caught it barehanded!Regardless, even though she\u2019d caught the blade with both hands, he was consoled by the sight of her struggling and being driven back by the force of it.But as she slowed down the blade\u2019s advance, she slowly but surely drained the snow-white sword until it lost its luminance.\u201cThat Sealing Technique\u2019s got to be some kind of cheat!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou gasped in shock.He wasn\u2019t going to give Mo Mo the chance to counterattack, though.Blade-Draw Technique!With a flip of his palm, and amidst numerous gasps from the spectators, he sent another white glowing blade slashing at Mo Mo.The latter\u2019s hands were busy. How was she going to block his second blade?Xu Xiaoshou could see victory within his reach. Just to be safe though, he slotted Hiding Pain into its sheath once more.\u201cDear lord, is Xu Xiaoshou mad? Why isn\u2019t he stopping?\u201dXu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t care what the spectators thought. Following the second blade, he got ready to unleash the third.\u201cClink!\u201dA crystalline sound resounded in the air. The sword was out, but he didn\u2019t see a glowing blade at all.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened. He checked his energy reserve and realized that he\u2019d been sucked dry of spiritual strength.\u201cD*mnit!\u201d He raised his fists and charged forward.Meanwhile, on the other end of the arena.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s first blade had driven Mo Mo to the edge of the arena. Seeing that the second blade was about ready to lop her head off the next moment, she suddenly opened her mouth and took a deep breath.\u201cHnn!\u201dShe swallowed the second blade!\u201cClank!\u201dThen, with a smack, she shattered the first blade as well!Everyone got up to their feet in utter disbelief. Xu Xiaoshou jumped, shocked, and the young man, who\u2019d been charging forward with his fists raised, instantly turned tail and ran.\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d he thought.\u201cShe\u2019s a monster!\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even possess an Innate Level Physique, yet she swallowed my Sword Will!\u201cHow did she manage to avoid being cleaved in half from the inside?\u201dMo Mo appeared to be in excruciating pain. Forcibly sealing her opponents\u2019 attacks must be draining for her too.Xu Xiaoshou froze momentarily in the middle of his retreat, as he\u2019d clearly realized this.He charged at Mo Mo again.The crowd was perplexed.\u201cThere must be a flurry of thoughts in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s head right now. So, is he going to make a charge or not?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! Well, I completely understand how he feels\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it were me and I\u2019d just seen my opponent swallow my Innate-stage Sword Will, I\u2019m quite sure I would jump right out of the arena from sheer fright.\u201dXu Xiaoshou had raised his fists and turned around. But it was too late.Mo Mo had recovered from her pangs of agony. She decided not to think about the blade that she had just swallowed and instead began to swiftly form a series of hand seals.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyelids twitched violently at the sight. The last time something like that had happened, he had ended up being riddled with holes by Zhao Qingteng\u2019s Formless Great Cold.Now\u2026Xu Xiaoshou surged forward like a bolt of lightning and threw his fist forward. They were but an inch apart!Mo Mo stared at the face that was barely an inch away from hers before abruptly pulling her face away, putting another inch between the two. She thrust her palms together.\u201cWorld Sealing Chains!\u201dHe had been that close. He had been one step away from determining who died and who lived. Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had missed his chance.He was right\u2026Boom! Boom! Boom!Eruptions thundered in the air as both corners of the skies and the earth split apart. Out of the enormous, gaping black holes black chains as wide as a human head shot out and wrapped around and shackled Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s four limbs.Bam!With a forceful yank that threatened to rip Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s limbs apart, the chains went taut.Xu Xiaoshou thought he was going to be torn apart right there and then. Without his Innate Level Physique, he would become four separate body parts instead of a whole human being!Blood would be flowing unceasingly from his broken and mutilated body\u2026Xu Xiaoshou panicked. He looked around and found himself bound in mid-air by heavy chains that stretched from two sides of the skies as well as the ground. Spreadeagled, he had become a sitting duck.What manner of sorcery was this?Xu Xiao was on the verge of tears. Were Innate-stage spiritual techniques supposed to be this powerful?This was terrifying!Xiao Qixiu frowned. He hadn\u2019t come across such a spiritual technique before, but he was certain that it didn\u2019t belong to the Spiritual Library Division.Mo Mo must have chanced upon it under fortuitous circumstances.Seated amongst the spectators, Zhang Xinxiong appeared solemn. The World Sealing Chains had honestly caught him by surprise. \u201cThis is at least a Master Stage spiritual technique\u2026\u201d\u201cWho exactly is this Mo Mo? Where did she come from?\u201dLiu Zhen was flabbergasted. The Master Stage?A Master Stage spiritual technique was a rare beast hardly seen, even in the Inner Yard!Bound by chains and hanging in mid-air, Xu Xiaoshou struggled to get free. He unleashed the Glow of Sharpness from every part of his body, yet failed to break a single link in the chains.\u201cI\u2019m finished\u2026\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense at all. Why can\u2019t I break this with my Innate-stage Glow of Sharpness?\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt incredibly cold as he hung in mid-air. It was so, so cold\u2026Mo Mo had begun to form her hand seals\u2026\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d cried Xu Xiaoshou inwardly.He was suddenly overcome by the urge to pee\u2026Somebody, save him!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Atmosphere Changed AgainChapter 49: Atmosphere Changed AgainHer jade-like fingers danced as she completed the complicated hand seals, and Xu Xiaoshou felt the temperature of the chains rise.\u201cSmelt!\u201d Mo Mo softly chanted, and lava erupted from the four openings by the sky and quickly flowed down along the chains.\u201cOh my god, is that really okay?\u201dThe audience was dumbfounded. They were all at the Acquired Stage, so none of them could understand an Innate-level battle.If an ordinary Spiritual Cultivation Level 10 were to fight in his place, he\u2019d probably be defeated in an instant!Xu Xiaoshou also felt a little troubled and pleaded, \u201cPlease, spare me!\u201dMo Mo ignored him and further fired up her power. In a flash, the lava covered Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body.\u201cAh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou subconsciously let out a heartwrenching scream, but then realized suddenly that it wasn\u2019t that painful and stopped screaming.What was going on?Why did this sensation give him a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?He suddenly thought of the situation at Goose Lake when he\u2019d tried to cultivate the Infernal Fire Seed. The seed had burned him from the inside. That was the real pain!This lava was invading his body from the outside, and, frankly speaking, it was nothing compared to the Internal Fire Seed. Although it was painful, it wasn\u2019t painful enough to make him cry out in pain. Hence, he immediately regained his cool.At most, it looked really horrifying to be covered in it.Crack.His body was burned through but immediately recovered. This lasted for quite some time in a cyclical fashion. Besides the pain he had to endure, this move actually didn\u2019t deal any substantial damage to Xu Xiaoshou!\u201cHeh, this is no big deal!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was amused, but his reaction made him looked like a masochist, as he was in fact being dealt an extreme sentence of death by burning.Even though he was smiling, the spectators that were present in the arena couldn\u2019t totally relate, and even Xiao Qixiu looked very stern and serious.\u201cHow many challenges has Xu Xiaoshou overcome to reach these heights today? How can he not feel the lava burning him?!\u201d\u201cObjectively speaking, he has my respect. Those who work their way up to acquire the Innate physical body are indeed tenacious and determined monsters.\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026 Xu Xiaoshou really had more than just luck to reach this new height today!\u201dSu Qianqian covered her eyes, as she couldn\u2019t bear to see him suffering. She didn\u2019t dare to open her eyes.Zhang Xinxiong looked indifferent, and it was hard to tell his current emotional state, but he had stopped teasing Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cImpressed, Passive Points +666.\u201d\u201cCared, Passive Points +888.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShocked, Mo Mo stared at him on the ground.Nobody knew better than her how hot this lava could get, yet Xu Xiaoshou took it as if it was an ordinary cold shower.She looked over at Xiao Qixiu, as she couldn\u2019t bear to increase the heat anymore.The judge in the void shook his head. Nobody could stop such a man with true tenacity and perseverance from attaining victory.Xu Xiaoshou was still able to withstand it, so how could he intervene in the battle and stop it abruptly?\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dMo Mo clenched her teeth and doubled the temperature of the lava!A hint of a pitch-black mixture suddenly appeared in the crimson lava, and this muddy liquid instantly flowed into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s clothes.\u201cUgh!\u201dA pained expression finally came over Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face. This sudden increase in temperature surpassed what he had experienced last time.No, he could not let this go on, or he would really die!His eyes darted as he remembered the cultivation method he\u2019d used that day. Why not\u2026Cultivate and incorporate this lava into his body?Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes lit up, and he decided to tolerate the pain to absorb the lava!His chest quaked as a Red Gold Pill emerged. Xu Xiaoshou bit it in one bite and sucked onto it hard.\u201cZzzzzzz.\u201dThat surging hot energy instantly melted Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s mouth and nose, but they were recovered the next moment.Another gush of burning energy had been incorporated into his energy reserve and was completely assimilated.\u201cIt\u2019s doable!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was thrilled and recklessly continued doing this.Everyone was shocked when they saw this. It was\u2026Bloody!The sight made everyone choke up and fall dead silent. In their hearts, everyone couldn\u2019t help but cheer for Xu Xiaoshou.Mo Mo couldn\u2019t bear it anymore.Xu Xiaoshou could bear it, but she as the aggressor couldn\u2019t take it anymore. This was just too cruel.\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I, Mo Mo, do things!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIf World Sealing Chains couldn\u2019t defeat him, must I use that\u2026\u201d Mo Mo subconsciously caressed her right arm.Xu Xiaoshou noticed it!His leg trembled. Lava couldn\u2019t even move him an inch, yet Mo Mo\u2019s subconscious action almost made him kneel.What was she thinking? Breaking the seal?What nonsense!\u201cStop!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou roared angrily.Mo Mo looked up, surprised that he knew what she was thinking.\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be the case\u2026\u201d she thought.\u201cNever mind that. Let\u2019s free him of this suffering soon!\u201dMo Mo\u2019s left hand started making a complicated combination of hand seals.Xu Xiaoshou felt terrible. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t do that,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019m not worthy of that!\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what was sealed within Mo Mo\u2019s right hand, but she was already so incredibly powerful, even with her seal in-tact, so breaking the seal would mean\u2026Things would take a major turn for the worse!\u201cWhat can I do, what can I do\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou started brainstorming, as he had to stop her!His gaze suddenly fell on the four chains that were restricting him\u2026Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes.The next moment, thousands of spiritual swords, that had been sedated just a moment ago, started vibrating again.Xiao Qixiu was shocked. \u201cThis dude\u2026\u201d\u201cHe learned \u2018All Things Are Swords\u2019 just like that?\u201cIs he a monster? He just learned \u201cReverse Sword Subduing\u201d in the afternoon!\u201dRing.Thousands of spiritual swords levitated again, and Xu Xiaoshou breathed out burning air as he controlled every sword\u2019s consciousness.Soon, he felt a special sword aura\u2026It was that uncultivated sword aura that Mo Mo had swallowed just now!Xu Xiaoshou frowned, as he sensed a kind of complicated energy suppressing this sword aura and preventing it from unleashing its power.But\u2026\u201cReverse Sword Style!\u201dXu Xiaoshou pulled suddenly, and Hiding Pain on the ground teleported toward his hand!He abruptly stopped the pulling, and the black sword fell onto the ground.The audience was dumbfounded, confused by his action. However, the next moment, they all saw that something was wrong with Mo Mo.Her left hand, which was making the hand seals, was interrupted. Her face was flushed, and her torso was swelling, as if something was about to burst out of it.\u201cXu! Xiao! Shou!\u201dMo Mo knew right away that he was pulling some tricks and was infuriated. She could only stop making hand seals and start suppressing the sword aura.\u201cHehe!\u201dXu Xiaoshou seemed to have found the solution. \u201cReverse Sword Style!\u201dThe black sword stood up but was interrupted before it could fly, falling to the ground once again.At the same time, Mo Mo\u2019s body quaked momentarily but soon calmed down. She was frowning, and let out a sigh of relief.Luckily, Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t multitask now\u2026However, was that really the case?\u201cReverse Sword Style!\u201dThe black sword stood\u2026\u201cStop!\u201dDang\u2026\u201cUgh!\u201dMo Mo\u2019s body shook again as she looked up, finally realizing something.The audience was still shocked, but they seemed to have realized the same thing\u2026\u201cCan\u2019t it be! Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cOh my god, that\u2019s a little cheap!\u201dXu Xiaoshou also realized something. Heck, not only had he realized it, but he had even come up with the idea!\u201cReverse Sword Style\u2026 Stop!\u201d\u201cReverse Sword Style\u2026 Stop!\u201d\u201cDang!\u201d\u201cDang!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dMo Mo was shocked twice in a row, and she was completely bushing. \u201cXu Xiao\u2026\u201d\u201cReverse Reverse Reverse!\u201d\u201cStop Stop Stop!\u201d\u201cDang Dang Dang!\u201d\u201cUgh Ugh Ugh!\u201dMo Mo\u2019s whole face turned red, even her neck. She was both ashamed and angry at Xu Xiaoshou!\u201cXu\u2026\u201d\u201cReverse Reverse Reverse!\u201d\u201cStop Stop Stop!\u201d\u201cDang Dang Dang!\u201d\u201cUgh Ugh Ugh!\u201dThe finals battle\u2019s atmosphere changed abruptly, and everyone was completely puzzled. Xiao Qiqiu stumbled and fell from the sky.\u201cHa!\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but lose his cool as he listened to Mo Mo\u2019s rhythmic burping, and he finally burst into bloody laughter.\u201cCursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: You\u2019re Leaking GasMo Mo\u2019s spasmodic \u201cugh\u201d and the constant shaking of her body made her looked rather scary.However, she also looked ridiculous at the same time.Xu Xiaoshou believed that he had good control over his emotions and usually wouldn\u2019t burst into laughter, unless he really couldn\u2019t help it.That was equally true for the audience. At first, nobody dared to laugh, as she was the Outer Yard Senior Sister and at the top of the honor roll!However, after Xu Xiaoshou started laughing, it caused a chain reaction.The initial shock disappeared from people\u2019s faces, and they gradually erupted into laughter.\u201cOh my gosh, Xu Xiaoshou, he has my respect. He\u2019s toxic, eh. Hahaha!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m dying of laughter. I\u2019m seeing another side of Senior Sister Mo. She\u2019s so cute!\u201d\u201cHaha, I can\u2019t bear it, really. I\u2019m sorry. Let me laugh first, hahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cHehahehaheheha!!\u201dSuch unique laughter had suddenly taken over the entire battleground. Everyone was stunned.\u201cWhat the heck. Who laughs like that? It\u2019s strange!\u201d\u201cShut up. Look behind you.\u201dThat person turned around and saw Elder Qiao\u2019s expressionless face, and he almost peed his pants.Oh god, he was done for!To his surprise, Elder Qiao pointed at the arena and yelled, \u201cThere he goes again! Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s a psycho, right!\u201d\u201cHehahehaheheha!!\u201d\u201cHa!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dNo one could contain their laughter anymore. Half were laughing at the battle, while the other half was laughing at Elder Qiao, which was a rare occasion, as none of them would usually dare to laugh at him.A new wave of passive points was registered on the information bar. Most were from people respectfully mocking him, but more were from people\u2019s disdain and curses.Xu Xiaoshou was amused. This was the benefit of having no barrier. He could see the updates in real-time, which felt really good.On the other side.Mo Mo had planned on reserving her strength, but after Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s humiliating trick, she was now determined to unleash her right hand.She forced herself to endure the weird feeling in her body and continued to choppily make hand seals, which were actually connecting.\u201cWhat the\u2026 that actually works.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was caught off guard and realized that he couldn\u2019t fool around anymore. If he didn\u2019t treat her seriously, she would definitely kill him here.\u201cReverse Sword Style!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201d Mo Mo endured it and stared at Xu Xiaoshou, her eyes blazing with anger, but her hands didn\u2019t stop making hand seals.However, this time, Xu Xiaoshou also didn\u2019t stop.The black sword swiftly flew over, and right before it penetrated his chest, Xu Xiaoshou used his mind to put it inside the space ring.Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was a genius for thinking of using the ring around his neck.After getting rid of Hiding Pain, which had tried to devour its owner, he now could finally unleash his full potential.\u201cInnate Sword Will fully activate!\u201dMo Mo\u2019s body trembled violently as she felt herself lose control of the sword aura within her body.So Xu Xiaoshou hadn\u2019t exhausted all of his strength?\u201cUgh!\u201dShe finally caved in and vomited a mouthful of blood.With a mouthful of blood, she could no longer suppress the seal, and a sky-shooting sword will started rising from her.Xiao Qixiu, who was standing at the edge of the arena, was numb.\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026\u201cHas he really cultivated the skill \u2018All Things Are Swords\u2019 to the point where he can even forcefully control a human?\u201cWhat kind of a weirdo is he!?\u201dStrictly speaking, Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t controlling a human. He was controlling the sword aura within Mo Mo\u2019s body.It had originally belonged to him and was as dear to him as Hiding Pain, so how could he fail to summon it?After Mo Mo lost control of the sword aura, not only did the sword will rise from her body, but the white Innate sword aura was also released.\u201cTsk!\u201dThe seven apertures on her head and four limbs started releasing a horrifying sword aura. The sharp sword will then immediately cut her, causing her to bleed profusely.Mo Mo had really underestimated him. She didn\u2019t know Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s control of the sword will was so powerful.Usually, people who\u2019d acquired \u201cAll Things Are Sword\u201d would definitely be able to learn Innate Sword Will, but those with Innate Sword Will weren\u2019t guaranteed to learn \u201cAll Things Are Sword!\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a spiritual technique, but a real realization of a state of mind. It was tremendously difficult to get to that.It seemed like Xu Xiaoshou was the only weirdo who\u2019d learned \u201cAll Things Are Sword\u201d while he acquired Innate Sword Will.\u201cTsk!\u201dAs the horrifying sword aura leaked out, Mo Mo was sent flying into the air by the recoil.In the air, their eyes met. One of them was chained up in the void, while the other was literally a portable sword aura projector\u2026The only similarity they shared was that both of their limbs were spread wide, and they were both drenched in blood.\u201cHehe!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve finally gotten a taste of what I feel!\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201d Mo Mo said with much difficulty.\u201cI didn\u2019t chain you up. And, on top of that, you started this first!\u201dXu Xiaoshou blinked and added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me go first?\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d\u201cHehe! That\u2019s my line too!\u201dThe two looked at each other in silence, both with stubborn looks on their faces.Xu Xiaoshou stayed quiet for a while longer before suddenly saying, \u201cJunior Sister Mo, stop struggling. You\u2019re leaking gas\u2026\u201dMo Mo was puzzled for a moment before she became so enranged she felt she might faint.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201cI will kill you!\u201d\u201cThreatened, Passive Points, +1.\u201dThe audience below them erupted into hysterial laughter. Although both of them were in a terrible state, Xu Xiaoshou had made it difficult for the audience to sympathize with them.Blood was spurting out of them!Was their blood infinite!?Mo Mo was hesitant, as she didn\u2019t possess an Innate body. She\u2019d only been able to last until now all thanks to the tremendous life force released from her right hand to heal her.However, she knew that \u201cit\u201d felt tired.\u201cFine!\u201d\u201cI agree that I\u2019ll let you go first!\u201d she said through clenched teeth, and made a hand seal, stopping the lava immediately.\u201cOh!\u201dEternal Vitality insantly healed most of his body, and Xu Xiaoshou moaned with relief.Mo Mo then said, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn!\u201dXu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, enjoying the hard-earned moment of peace.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t control the sword will, actually\u2026\u201dMo Mo: ???\u201cCursed, Passive Points, +1.\u201dShe waved her hand, letting the lava flow again.\u201cWhat the heck. You\u2019re cruel!\u201dXu Xiaoshou seized the moment to thrust his chest out and lift the ring high.Hiding Pain reemerged and started hovering in the sky.When the sword handle was facing his forehead, Xu Xiaoshou used \u201cGlow of Sharpness\u201d and concentrated his power onto his forehead, then banged the sword handle.Klink!The black sword was forcefully fired toward the sky.In the spectator seats, Qing Teng realized\u2026It was the sword that had defeated him that day!Everyone understood Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s intentions, and they all sat up straight to see how the battle would proceed.How could Mo Mo ignore that?However, her body was still releasing sword will, and it was nearly impossible for her to move her hand.Even so, she still started making hand seals.\u201cIt\u2019s too slow\u2026\u201dXiao Qixiu shook his head. Even if Mo Mo had a horrifying ultimate skill up her sleeve, she was constrained by the complicated hand seals.If she were fighting against an ordinary person, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.However, she was facing Xu Xiaoshou the weirdo, who happened to be a talented young man that could capture every detail of the battle!It felt like that night when Hiding Pain had flown to an extremely far distance. Xu Xiaoshou felt excited.\u201cCome!\u201d he thought.\u201cDevour your owner. I\u2019m giving you the chance today!\u201d\u201cReverse Sword Style!\u201dMo Mo didn\u2019t give up, even as the sound of something slicing through the air came from behind her, and Hiding Pain came up and impaled her in the chest!This wasn\u2019t all. Everyone witnessed the black sword continue to thrust forward with Mo Mo on it and pierce cleanly through Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s chest.The world fell dead silent.The void of the finals, four gigantic chains covered in lava, a black sword dripping with blood with two people on it\u2026This sight would probably be etched into the spectators\u2019 minds forever.\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026 He\u2019s really determined\u2026 He really could harm himself\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tearing up. It looks really painful\u2026\u201dIn the void, the chains looked transparent, as if they would disappear at any second.\u201cUgh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou vomited blood on Mo Mo\u2019s head.Pain! It was a heart-piercing pain!However, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop Mo Mo from unleashing her right hand if he hadn\u2019t gone to such lengths.\u201cUgh!\u201dMo Mo also vomited blood on Xu Xiaoshou. She didn\u2019t possess an Innate body, so she passed out on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s chest.Some people\u2019s eyes teared up at the sight, some were bedazzled, but most were stunned.Bang!The chains finally disintegrated, and Xu Xiaoshou hugged Mo Mo, who had lost consciousness and fallen from the void.\u201cBang!\u201dXu Xiaoshou withdrew the black sword and carried Mo Mo in both of his hands, then fed her a red gold pill.\u201cThe battle has ended. The winner is Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Inner Yard OpeningClap clap clap!A huge round of applause!Everyone in the audience had stood up to pay their respects, and none were stingy with their applause, as they\u2019d been completely captivated by the battle.How should they describe this final\u2026It had started out strong and ended with a bang, with Xu Xiaoshou becoming the center of attention.Everyone thought it was a little weird, but as they looked at this young man in the arena drenched in blood, they all felt that with him around, it was no surprise the match had ended with such a heated battle.It was undeniable that this had been an extremely fantastic battle!Xiao Qixiu waved and sent the medical staff to receive Mo Mo from Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hands.The remaining four staff members all awkwardly stared at Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cDo you need any treatment?\u201dThe four familiar faces\u2026Xu Xiaoshou was amused. \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201dHe took off his shirt and rubbed off the dead flesh that had been cooked by the lava, then passed it to them.\u201cSince you guys are here and I don\u2019t have anything nice for you guys, take this as a souvenir!\u201d\u201cCursed, Passive Points. +4.\u201dThe four staff members turned around and immediately left. This time, they didn\u2019t even bother to check out his condition.He really was a monster. How had such horrifying lava not burned him? What a shame.During the battle just now, these four people had been the least worried when they saw the lava appear. When they saw the audience start to feel nervous for Xu Xiaoshou, they\u2019d all thought that the audience knew nothing about him. Then again, if they hadn\u2019t checked his body before, they probably would\u2019ve thought him in danger too.Xiao Qixiu signaled for the crowd to settle down and stop clapping, then smiled and said, \u201cFirst, I would like to congratulate Xu Xiaoshou on winning the Wincloud Competition. To be honest, this was beyond my expectations!\u201dThe spectators all smiled simultaneously, as they\u2019d all thought the same thing.Except for Xu Xiaoshou, who was inwardly cursing this middle-aged old man, his expression dark.\u201cSo you thought I couldn\u2019t win the competition, huh?\u201d he thought.Xiao Qixiu didn\u2019t pay him any mind and added, \u201cI noticed him in the group play-off because he was stirring up trouble. I noticed him once again in the subsequent matches, as he was making even bigger trouble. In the qualifying match\u2026\u201d\u201cHa. Ha.\u201d\u201cI could no longer ignore him. This man almost p*ssed me off!\u201dThe audience burst into laughter, but Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression darkened.Revenge!This middle-aged old man had finally seized an opportunity to tease him!Xiao Qixiu went on. \u201cHowever, Xu Xiaoshou is undeniably a black horse!\u201d\u201cEveryone encounters a turning point in his or her life at some point, be it a setback or an opportunity. It all depends on your own effort to determine if you can overcome your own limitations.\u201dHe was taking such a roundabout way to praise him, and Xu Xiaoshou shyly scratched his head.\u201cEffort?\u201d he thought.\u201cWell, it was okay.\u201d\u201cHowever, after your encouraging speech, I\u2019ll try harder to earn more Passive Points.\u201dXiao Qixiu wasn\u2019t aware that his words were being twisted by someone else. After he gave another round of appraise, he finally ended the post-game commentary.\u201cI hope that in the next cohort, there will still be people who can \u2018impress\u2019 me\u2026\u201cNow to the prize presentation!\u201dHe activated the formation order, and a podium emerged in the arena. There were only ten spots.The staff escorted the top ten contestants to the podium. Although the rest of the people who\u2019d participated in the qualifying matches were also awarded, they couldn\u2019t enjoy being on the podium in this moment of glory.Xu Xiaoshou glanced over and saw many of his subordinates\u2026Cough cough, familiar old friends!Zhao Qingteng, Mu Zixi, Mo Mo\u2026The medical staff was indeed capable, as Mu Mu had regained consciousness and was able to move on her own.Xu Xiaoshou chuckled as these people walked by him, and even waved enthusiastically to greet them.However, he was shocked when he glanced at his information bar.Zhao Qingteng walked by in front of him and said emotionlessly, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cCursed, Passive Points, +1.\u201dMu Zixi passed by, playing with her twin ponytails, and looked away, wrinkling her nose at him.\u201cDespised, Passive Points, +1.\u201dMo Mo walked over, not even looking at him.\u201cIgnored, Passive Points, +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou: ???\u201cHey!\u201d he thought.\u201cAll I did was stab you guys a few times and simply knock each of you out!\u201cWhy are you people so narrow-minded?\u201cYou guys really bear me a grudge, huh?\u201dSince everyone was being like this, Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t bother to wave his hand to greet anyone anymore.Intolerant, shallow, and unbecoming!The staff gave everyone another space ring, which Xu Xiaoshou really loved. This was his second ring.\u201cI\u2019m not going to list out all the other prizes. Just take a look for yourself.\u201dXiao Qixiu turned to face the audience after saying this and raised his voice. \u201cThe top ten of the Windcloud Board each gets a chance to enter Spiritual Library Division to pick his or her spiritual skill.\u201d\u201cThe top three will each be awarded an Innate Pill. If you don\u2019t need it, you can exchange it for other pills of equivalent value!\u201dThe audience was amazed by the prizes, and they all looked envious.The Spiritual Library division was one of the most important divisions in the entire Tiansang Spirit Palace. It contained countless spiritual skills, including the Acquired Stage, Innate Stage, and even Master Stage skills.The Innate Pill was a Grade Eight pill that could increase the chances of evolving to the Innate Stage by thirty percent. This was the dream pill that was highly sought after by everyone!Of course, the top three this year were a little unusual, as Xu Xiaoshou, the champion, was the only person who could use this\u2026The other two had already reached the Innate Stage!Xiao Qixiu felt rather helpless too, as the quality of this cohort was higher than usual, and the Innate Pill, which was usually a popular prize, looked rather pathetic to them this year.Of course, being able to exchange the Innate Pill for other pills of equivalent value was a pretty flexible option.Xu Xiaoshou was pretty thrilled, as his cultivation level wasn\u2019t as high as those monsters.These rewards were indeed timely for him. The Innate Pill would be useful to him, same for the opportunity to enter the Spiritual Library Division to pick a spiritual skill.God knows that he had enrolled into the Spirit Palace for three years and only gotten a chance to enter there to get a White Cloud Sword Technique. Since then, he hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to enter there again.Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou felt sad.Just look at the other contestants. They all had huge reserves of spiritual skills to use. Look at Mo Mo. Her spiritual skill rank was probably higher than the Innate Stage!A poor underdog like him could only rely on his self-invented skills, which were rankless.Hmm?But he had won at last.\u201cHeheh!\u201d At this thought, Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, feeling good about himself.The audience in turn felt conflicted as they watched the prize presentation ceremony being carried out in the arena.At last, Xiao Qixiu smirked and said, \u201cVery well. We\u2019ve finally reached the last segment.\u201cThe opening for Inner Yard!\u201dWhen he said this, people started to discuss enthusiastically.\u201cIt\u2019s finally here! I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment. I wonder how many will make it to the Inner Yard this year!\u201d\u201cIf I remember correctly, Su Qianqian was the only one who made it last year. I think the years before that saw few cohorts with people who made it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The benchmark for qualifying to enter the Inner Yard is too high, but the quality of the students there is really cream of the crop.\u201d\u201cYeah, even with the thirty-three people in the Inner Yard, adding up the others wouldn\u2019t even surpass a hundred people\u2026\u201d\u201cYup!\u201dXiao Qixiu took out a paper from his pocket and read, \u201cFirst Inner Yard Opening, Zhou Tianshen!\u201dZhou Tianshen, who was sitting among the audience, stood up in disbelief and pointed at himself.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYou sure you aren\u2019t mistaken?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52It was understandable that he didn\u2019t believe it.The guy had already been cut down by Xu Xiaoshou when there were thirty-two people left in the match, and thus had long since given up hope. As such, he couldn\u2019t believe that he was actually able to join the Inner Yard.The crowd cheered. Some were envious, some were jealous, but most were just curious.Many were wondering if the bar had been lowered for this year, given the fact that someone ranked below 32 on the Windcloud Board was allowed to join.Xiao Qixiu continued saying, \u201cThe second candidate to join the Inner Yard, Zhao Qingteng.\u201dZhao Qingteng, who was usually cool and aloof, couldn\u2019t help but smirk, his fingers tracing the guard of his Ice Stream Sword.\u201cSecond ne\u2026\u201dThe audience clenched their fists, noting that the record had been broken.\u201cThird candidate to join the Inner Yard, Mu Zixi.\u201d\u201cFourth candidate to join the Inner Yard, Mo Mo.\u201dXiao Qixiu read out two names in a row, causing quite a commotion in the audience.Mu Zixi grabbed her pigtails. She looked very excited, so much so she even hopped once on the spot.Mo Mo, on the other hand, remained cradling the bronze cauldron in her hand. She took a whiff of the incense within, her face deadpan.\u201cThis is awesome!\u201dThe audience was extremely excited, as if their names were the ones that had been called instead.But someone voiced their doubts all of a sudden. \u201cHold on. It looks like only people at the Innate Stage were called\u2026\u201dEveryone was stunned, finding that it was indeed the case.Even Zhou Tianshen, who was outside the 32, was only able to join the Inner Yard due to having broken into Innate Stage in that battle with Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cIn previous years, it seems like only people at the Innate Stage were allowed to join too.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, Xu Xiaoshou would definitely be able to join then, since he has Innate Level Physique\u2026\u201d\u201cNot quite,\u201d someone interjected.\u201cThose with Innate Level Physiques have reached the end of the road. It would be very difficult for them to go further from there. Furthermore, his powers are only at level eight.\u201dEveryone started to feel tense then, as someone with Innate Level Physique making it to Master Stage was virtually unheard of.The reason was simple\u2014training was simply too difficult to achieve further success.That was an unwritten law of sorts, which applied to more than just the Tiansang Spirit Palace; it was something that applied everywhere in the entire Shengshen Continent.Everyone\u2019s gaze fell on Xu Xiaoshou. None had expected the champion to be the one who\u2019d caused the audience the most worry.They wondered if an exception would be made for someone at Acquired Stage to join the Inner Yard.They wondered if the number of candidates allowed to join the Inner Yard would go up to five, which was unprecedented.Everyone started to feel very tense.Xu Xiaoshou was rather intimidated by the looks he received all around, yet the next second, he felt nothing but glee.Anticipated, Passive Points +2130.He took a breath, like he felt nothing at all. But, despite having become the champion, he was nonetheless feeling rather tense.Xiao Qixiu turned his gaze away from the paper, folded it, and put it away. His expression was cold as he said, \u201cFour candidates. That will be all.\u201dDoubted, Passive Points +1869.Doubted, Passive Points +1511.Doubted, Passive Points +1042.\u2026The Information Bar was flooded by such lines, and Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. \u201cI\u2019m not in?\u201d he thought.Even though he\u2019d put on a nonchalant fa\u00e7ade, he was still nonetheless the champion. Even if he hadn\u2019t shown it outright, he\u2019d nonetheless felt for sure deep down that he\u2019d gotten it, yet this was the outcome.That was all?The others on the stage were equally as stunned. The smiles on the faces of the three who\u2019d just been admitted instantly froze.While they wouldn\u2019t openly admit it, they\u2019d all been nonetheless impressed by Xu Xiaoshou, yet here was this baffling outcome.???The audience wasn\u2019t as reserved as the contestants. One after another, the spectators instantly went berserk.\u201cWhat? No more? Four candidates? Are you kidding me?\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou is the champion, man! He is funny, but you could not joke at such a time?\u201d\u201cOh the irony. The champion isn\u2019t admitted into the Inner Yard, and yet the one outside the thirty-two\u2026 hey, let me go! I\u2019m gonna say what I\u2019m gonna say!\u201d\u201cAre you out of your mind? Zhou Tianshen is right behind you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dZhou Tianshen was furious. He immediately rose to his feet and said, \u201cIf this is how it\u2019s going to be, then I, Zhou Tianshen, would like to forfeit my candidacy into the Inner Yard.\u201dHe glared at Xiao Qixiu without a slight hint of fear in his eyes.\u201cWell said. Same goes for me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re in.\u201d\u201cOh, you shut up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXiao Qixiu\u2019s words had set the audience on fire. They were practically boiling with anger.He didn\u2019t say anything to address their protests, and instead walked up to Xu Xiaoshou, looking at the kid without saying anything.\u201cThe kid is still pretending that it doesn\u2019t matter eh?\u201d he thought. \u201cBut\u2026\u201dXiao Qixiu was experienced enough to read all the hidden bitterness on the kid\u2019s face.\u201cThe kid is still just eighteen, after all.\u201d\u201cHuff\u2026\u201d Xiao Qixiu sighed.Xu Xiaoshou backed away, pinching his nose.Xiao Qixiu was baffled.\u201cOh, that little sh**!\u201cThe kid really does know how to put up a fight. And there I was feeling pity for him.\u201dXiao Qixiu stopped sighing and took a great big breath. He clapped Xu Xiaoshou on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou could still stay in the Outer Yard for another year, so as to make a breakthrough into Innate Stage as soon as possible.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was stunned.He had almost forgotten that if he were unable to join the Inner Yard within three years, or stayed at the bottom of the Contest of Wind and Cloud, he would be kicked out of the palace.\u201cSo, that\u2019s to say someone actually spoke on my behalf?\u201d he thought.\u201cWas it this middle-aged guy who did so, or\u2026\u201cElder Qiao?\u201dHe took a look at the audience.Elder Qiao was one of the few who had remained quietly seated in the audience seats. He simply nodded and said nothing.Encouraged, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou felt warm and fuzzy deep down.He was undoubtedly feeling disappointed and dejected.Yet, he didn\u2019t like being pitied, so he just had to do it when he saw the sympathetic look on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s face.At the moment, however, he was truly touched.Xu Xiaoshou sincerely voiced his gratitude. \u201cThank you.\u201d1Xiao Qixiu shook his head and grinned. \u201cYou\u2019d do enough by just sparing me your antics. Your thanks are too much for me.\u201dHe had no idea why this kid, despite being his junior, still managed to get on his nerves with all the antics he pulled.Furthermore, he also seemed to have the subconscious tendency of lowering his status whenever he talked to Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably how Old Qiao feels as well, I guess,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought. He pouted slightly and said nothing in return.Xiao Qixiu then turned around and said loudly, \u201cI hereby announce that the Contest of Wind and Cloud of this year is officially over!\u201d\u201cDismissed!\u201dEveryone in the audience was feeling vexed, but they couldn\u2019t do anything to protest the outcome.They\u2019d witnessed the birth of a dark horse and thought the ending would be utmost spectacular, yet the outcome had been unexpected.The champion was unable to even get a place in the Inner Yard.This would\u2019ve been fine with them if Xu Xiaoshou were an ordinary champion, but he had defeated so many with Innate Elemental Powers, which meant he was anything but ordinary.They wondered if his powers and potential were indeed not worth the Spirit Palace making a one-time exception.\u201cGood work! Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dMany didn\u2019t leave right away and came to encourage him instead. Before long, cheers were coming from all over the place.\u201cXu Xiaoshou! You\u2019re the best! I\u2019ll love you forever!\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou! Hang in there!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEncouraged, Passive Points +663.Encouraged, Passive Points +414.Encouraged, Passive Points +520.\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was touched again seeing the waves of encouragement washing all over him.This was especially so for the line: \u201cXu Xiaoshou! Hang in there!\u201dHe vaguely remembered that that line had come about in the group matches, where he had pretended to be ganged up by over 40 people.\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered in gratitude.The sun set, and the crowd eventually dispersed.Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he responded to those who came up to him just to encourage him, whether he recognized them or not.\u201cDejected?\u201d Elder Qiao came up to him and asked.\u201cYeah.\u201cVery much so.\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked at the sunset while Elder Qiao looked at him.\u201cThis kid\u2026\u201d he thought.Despite having said he was fine to so many people, he was sure being frank with him.\u201cThat\u2019s how it is with life,\u2019 he said. \u201cUps and downs all the time.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and seemed to recall something. \u201cUps and downs, but if you\u2019re lucky\u2026\u201d\u201cYou sure are one hell of an optimist.\u201d Elder Qiao shook his head, then took out two bottles of pills for him before walking into the sunset.\u201cGood work.\u201d\u201cTeach those unflinching old farts a lesson. Make them see that they were wrong.\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou was rather stunned, thinking that there was definitely a lot to swallow in those two lines.He then looked down at the two bottles of pills in his hand.A bottle of Spiritual Cultivation Pills.Another bottle carrying Red Gold Pills.Sunset, Elder Qiao, and pills again\u2026Xu Xiaoshou smiled faintly, finding the scene oddly familiar, yet something was missing.He took out a Spiritual Cultivation Pill and took a whiff.Hsss.The sunset seemed to sway, so much so that even his shadow seemed to shudder.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Chapter 53: Spiritual Library DivisionHe slept soundly all the way until morning.He slept so well that he\u2019d swear it was the best sleep he\u2019d gotten in his entire life so far.There were no mosquitoes around, he didn\u2019t need to worry about matches the next day, and there was no need to wake up to practice swordplay in the middle of the night just to ease all that tension.As for that dull, dreadful ending from the day before, he had completely put it behind him after being dejected for a while.Death was unable to completely do him in, so he thought nothing of that minor setback.\u201cIt\u2019s just the Inner Yard after all,\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m just not ready for it!Urgent knocks were heard at his door again, waking him up. He went over to open the door.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dThe person before him was none other than a staff member from that waiting room who had delivered him the Red Gold Pills from Xiao Qixiu.\u201cPlease be quick. Elder Xiao is waiting for you.\u201d He deliberated for a moment. Then, afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would take his sweet time getting ready, he added, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who hasn\u2019t shown up yet.\u201dToday was the day he would head inside the Spiritual Library Division to pick his spiritual technique. It was already noon, and was indeed getting late.\u201cAlright, lead the way.\u201dXu Xiaoshou simply waved his hand and told the staff to lead the way, as he had nothing to pack anyway.The staff member immediately rushed to get ahead of him.\u201cBy the way, are there any special rules, written or otherwise, that I should know about before getting into the Spiritual Library Division?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou took out a bottle of Red Gold Pills.Again?The staff member was startled, and immediately waved his hand in the negative.\u201cNothing of that sort. Elder Xiao will personally explain the rules when he sees you all.\u201d He pushed the Red Gold Pill bottle back, then drastically lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve already broken the rules once, so I really can\u2019t do this again.\u201dXu Xiaoshou frowned. \u201cTake it!\u201dThe staff member looked like he was about to cry. \u201cThere really are no hidden rules, and even if I took this, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you anything. I\u2019ve never been to the Spiritual Library Division.\u201d\u201cOh, that so?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a bit, realizing that he wouldn\u2019t be able to fish anything out of the other man.The last time he went there was about three years ago, and it actually wasn\u2019t his soul that had been in control then, so he\u2019d forgotten everything.Furthermore, he was rather dumb back then, having picked the \u201cWhite Cloud Sword Techniques,\u201d which he was unable to master more than the first move of, even after practicing for three years.He was determined to be smarter this time.But then again, he had little confidence in his potential and figured that it wouldn\u2019t quite matter what he picked anyway.Sigh.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned dull, and he had no intentions of taking that bottle of Red Gold Pills back.The staff member took a deep breath, as if he were about to make some very, very important decision, and said, \u201cI cannot take this!\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked at the staff member, surprised that he wasn\u2019t actually backing down but was instead glaring at him with his teeth clenched.Shing!Xu Xiaoshou then drew his black sword out of his chest.\u201cTake it.\u201dSigh. The staff member then took the pills and shoved them into his sleeve.\u201cLead the way.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dThe sun was hot, and the leader of the staff members looked up, trying to let the sun dry his tears.\u201cOh, elder,\u201d he sighed inwardly.\u201cIt\u2019s really not my fault. Xu Xiaoshou just insists on bribing me. Wuuuuuuu.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for breaking the rules again\u2026\u201dCursed, Passive Points +1.Impressed, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou was amused, wondering what could\u2019ve possibly caused such ambivalence.\u2026The Spiritual Library Division, Inner Yard.The Inner Yard had a concentration of Spiritual Energy several times that of the Outer Yard, which enabled one to be invigorated as soon as one entered the place.Every disciple who first joined the Tiansang Spirit Palace would get a chance to enter the Spiritual Library Division once. While this was mainly to let them select the techniques they would soon practice, having them experience the difference in Spiritual Energy concentration between the Inner and Outer Yards also served as a way to encourage them to be diligent in their training.Furthermore, it was said that every Inner Yard disciple would get their own private compound, which had an array that, when opened, would increase said concentration by several times over.Private compounds were hard to come by.Not everyone was like Xu Xiaoshou, who\u2019d managed to get himself a private compound when he was still training at the Outer Yard.Some even had to sneak up others\u2019 doors just to train.Xiao Qixiu brought eleven others with him, walking as he talked.\u201cAlthough you\u2019ve all been here before, I\u2019m about to reiterate the rules one more time.\u201d\u201cEach of you can select an Innate-level spiritual technique. Once you\u2019re done, get to registration right away. Be careful not to cause a scene, and fighting inside is absolutely forbidden.\u201dHe turned around and locked eyes with Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cGot it?\u201dExasperated, Xu Xiaoshou asked, \u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201dXiao Qixiu\u2019s expression seemed to say \u201cyou of all people should know why,\u201d and he added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be discreet about his. What I said was meant for you!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.Everyone else around laughed their lungs out.Ridiculed, Passive Points +11.Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt rather exhausted, and he shot a look at Xiao Qixiu that seemed to say, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d Then, he walked to the tail end of the entourage.He then found Zhou Tianshen in the entourage as well, and that piqued his interest.He recalled Xiao Qixiu having said that only the top ten would get a chance to visit the Spiritual Library Division again, but he remembered having eliminated Zhou Tianshen when they were fighting for one of the top thirty-two places.\u201cWait a minute,\u201d he thought.\u201cUnder-the-table deal then?\u201dXu Xiaoshou went up and put an arm around Zhou Tianshen\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhy are you here too?\u201dThe other man wanted to say something but decided not to.Xu Xiaoshou then chuckled. His look seemed to say that he understood, and he dragged the man out of the entourage and whispered, \u201cJust tell me, how did you manage to get here. I swear I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dZhou Tianshen tried to think up a way to go about this.He had taken Xu Xiaoshou to be his friend after that battle, so he felt that he couldn\u2019t do anything to provoke him.However, by the look on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face, he seemed to be urging him to speak the truth, so he had no choice but to be honest with him. \u201cAn opportunity given to me after making it into the Inner Yard.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s smile froze.\u201cOkay, sure!\u201d he thought. \u201cNo problem. My own fault for putting salt in my own wound.\u201d\u201cSo umm\u2026 they all can pick two techniques each?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Zhou Tianshen nodded. \u201cThey can pick one now, and then they can come again to pick another after they master that one.\u201d\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s convoluted,\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and left.\u201cThat middle-aged guy was right. I\u2019m better off not talking at all.\u201dDisturbed, Passive Points +1.He was stunned for a moment, then turned around to see the worried look on Zhou Tianshen\u2019s face, as if he were worried that what he said had hurt him.\u201cThis is one straightforward guy indeed,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou chuckled inwardly.\u2026\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dA building that was three stories tall appeared before their eyes after they took a turn on the winding path.The building looked plain and was sparsely decorated. There weren\u2019t even any carvings to be found on its pillars. Other than the huge crimson pearl that seemed to be emanating heat on the roof, nothing about the building seemed to be out of the ordinary.The plaque hanging above the door said \u201cSpiritual Library Division\u201d in black lettering.The writing looked rustic and magnanimous.It seemed to suggest that it was a good place for studying.Xiao Qixiu took out a reddish-black Elder Token and placed it on the array printed at the door, which then opened it.\u201cGet in there. The first floor contains Acquired-level techniques, the second floor contains Innate-level ones, and no going to the third floor.\u201cYou have six hours to pick your techniques. Don\u2019t get too engrossed, and be mindful of the time allotted. Get to registration once you\u2019re done.\u201dHe then took a look at Xu Xiaoshou and said, \u201cRemember what I said on our way here.\u201dEveryone was having a good laugh again. As the student who was specifically picked on by the \u201cinstructor,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to walk inside with his head hung low.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: 54The Spiritual Library Division was bigger on the inside than it looked on the outside.Xu Xiaoshou scanned the place and found that there were hundreds of shelves around, with every shelf either having jade scrolls or ancient texts on them. There were easily over 1000 Acquired-level spiritual techniques to be found on that one floor alone.\u201cTsk, tsk, this is something.\u201dHe walked to the end along with the crowd and turned, reaching out his hand and touching the first technique.That was a snippet of an ancient text that one could read, yet an array had been installed on it, causing the reader to only be able to read the name and introduction but not the content inside.Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t dwell on this book. He glanced at it, then shook it a bit, but nothing happened.He then shook even harder, and still nothing happened.He put the book down and went for the second book.The result was the same.In contrast, the others in the crowd passed through the first floor and made their way to the stairs leading to the second floor.Xiao Qixiu had made it very clear that the first floor contained Acquired-level techniques, which no one out of the group batted an eye at.It wasn\u2019t every day they were allowed to come inside this place. Given that there were no restrictions on what they could read, they all naturally headed to the second floor.Zhou Tianshen had thought to do the same as them initially, following the rest to the stairs, but when he saw that no one else was behind him when they turned a corner, he stopped instead.\u201cWhere\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou gone to again? Is he still on the first floor picking techniques?\u201dZhou Tianshen was puzzled. He figured that he should advise his friend if that were the case.He peered around the corner and found Xu Xiaoshou doing something at a shelf near the entrance.He took a closer look and missed a step on the stairs, causing him to almost roll down the steps.\u201cSh**!\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s that guy doing?\u201cShaking ancient texts??\u201dZhou Tianshen was completely baffled, thinking that Xu Xiaoshou was definitely very bold.He\u2019d completely forgotten what Elder Xiao had just said as soon as they\u2019d gone inside. The way Xu Xiaoshou was shaking the books, it would only take moments for the caretakers to come and pick a fight with him.Zhou Tianshen was exasperated. He headed back there and stopped Xu Xiaoshou from shaking the books again. \u201cWhat the h*ll are you doing?\u201d\u201cLooking for techniques.\u201d The look on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face seemed to suggest that he\u2019d done nothing wrong.\u201cYou call this looking for techniques?\u201d Zhou Tianshen was so exasperated that his voice raised considerably. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here is ruining the books. You\u2019ll be done for when the caretakers get here!\u201d\u201cQuiet!\u201dXu Xiaoshou then shushed him and said, \u201cYou know nothing, do you? The books are protected by arrays, so there\u2019s no way they could be ruined. You on the other hand, why the h*ll are you being so loud? Looking to get your head chopped off?\u201dZhou Tianshen shrunk back and added, \u201cBut that\u2019s no reason for you to do what you did. Just in case, you know, the books do get ruined.\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t!\u201dXu Xiaoshou waved his hand in dismissal, then stared at him instead. \u201cWhat are you doing here anyway? Shouldn\u2019t you be upstairs looking for Innate-level techniques?\u201dZhou Tianshen was speechless.\u201cSo you did know that the Innate level ones were up there, huh?\u201d he thought. \u201cThen why the h*ll are you shak\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201cHold on.\u201dHe paused all of a sudden and started pondering.\u201cThe guy knows that the good stuff is upstairs, so what is he doing here still?\u201cOh\u2026\u201cI see.\u201dHe recalled the conversation he\u2019d had with Xu Xiaoshou on their way here, and his face lit up with sudden understanding as he asked, \u201cYou have other ways, then?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.\u201cOther ways, yeah, right. I\u2019m trying to find gold in the sands, dude!\u201d\u201cPfftt!\u201d Zhou Tianshen pouted for a bit, then continued, \u201cWhat gold could you find in the first floor, eh? The way I see it, you\u2019re picking sesames in a pile of sh** instead.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand that was shaking the text stopped. He was kind of offended by Zhou Tianshen\u2019s words.\u201cSo what? You know how to go about it then?\u201d he thought.\u201cWhatever. You\u2019ve been here before. Might as well teach you something, then,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou sighed, figuring that these people of foreign worlds were indeed hopeless. However, he figured that it would do no harm to remind a guy who\u2019d been kind enough to come and remind him about some things.He pulled Zhou Tianshen over and pressed the other man\u2019s head low, saying, \u201cListen now. The real deal, the truly powerful techniques, will definitely not be put right in front of you.\u201cOnly by selecting certain texts like me can you seek the lost treasures.\u201dZhou Tianshen looked doubtful, and he retorted, \u201cWhat? You think you can shake treasures out of these old books?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou stretched himself a bit, a mysterious grin on his face. \u201cYou know, the likes of golden pages, ancient maps, pieces of broken scrolls and whatever. They\u2019re often found wedged inside the common ones.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019ve read enough books to tell.\u201dZhou Tianshen saw how confident Xu Xiaoshou was and figured that he might not be lying, but then again\u2026He wondered if such ways that seemed to have come out of nowhere would actually work.\u201cBelieve it or not. Have it your way.\u201dXu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes, tired of explaining. Then he returned to shaking the ancient texts again.Zhou Tianshen looked at Xu Xiaoshou, then shifted his gaze upwards as he thought about something. His gaze was so intense he could\u2019ve seen through into the second floor.He thought for a bit, then found himself reaching for a book on a shelf.\u201cWe have six hours, so I\u2019m going to search for three hours and then head upstairs if I don\u2019t find anything.\u201d\u201cYeah, just like that.\u201dHe nodded in the affirmative and looked at Xu Xiaoshou again. The other man almost looked like he were glowing.While Xu Xiaoshou did look like a lunatic, most of those who were thought to have sense had all been taken out by him. Zhou Tianshen then figured that there was maybe something to what the former had said.That was probably how he\u2019d managed to become champion.Zhou Tianshen\u2019s eyes widened, as he felt he had seemingly discovered a piece of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s secret to success.Swoop, swoop, swoop.He started shaking the books one by one, finding nothing.\u201cI knew it!\u201d he thought. \u201cThat the road to success would be anything but easy!\u201dZhou Tianshen\u2019s eyes lit up.Moving on!Swoop, swoop, swoop.Still nothing.\u201cFailed again, as expected\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat. I guess this is what grandpa meant when he told me about the trials and tribulations one experiences on the road to success.\u201d\u201cThinking could actually enable one to discover shortcuts to success. Now I know why grandpa kept telling me to think more.\u201dA stout kid rubbed his hands and then kept searching the books on the first floor of the library, his eyes seemingly sparkling the whole time.\u2026On the other side.Xu Xiaoshou had already searched several shelves. His Sense told him that Zhou Tianshen was actually searching the places he\u2019d already searched, and he almost fainted at the thought.He walked up to Zhou Tianshen and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already searched the places you\u2019re looking through!\u201d\u201cHey, you might have overlooked something,\u201d Zhou Tianshen answered without looking up. His hands were busy shaking through all the books. No one could stop him from reaching success.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned glum. The other man actually made sense.\u201cBut we don\u2019t have that much time!\u201dHe pointed at the end of the first floor and said, \u201cSearch over there instead. We\u2019ll split up. Remember to share when you find something.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cSeems like a good idea.\u201d Zhou Tianshen stopped doing what he was doing and decided to do as told.\u201cRemember, the weirder the stuff you find, the better. If you happen to find a piece of blank paper, you\u2019re inches away from becoming a god.\u201d\u201cBlank paper?\u201d Zhou Tianshen then looked like he had just realized something and clenched his fists. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t just search the shelves. Look through the dusty corners, and there might be pieces stuffed under the legs of tables and chairs. If you find something, let me have a look first!\u201d\u201cMan\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cYou want to cover that much, eh?\u201dZhou Tianshen was stunned at the thought there might be legendary obscured pieces hidden somewhere.That was the champion for you!He gulped and came to believe all of a sudden that Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s thought patterns would definitely lead him to fame and glory.Xu Xiaoshou saw him walk away and returned to flipping everywhere he could flip, not missing even a single corner.He figured that Zhou Tianshen might not find anything satisfactory, but he was different.Knowing oneself was a precious trait. Xu Xiaoshou knew how rare his potential was from the fact that he\u2019d only been able to master one move, even after practicing the White Cloud Sword Techniques for three years. As such, he knew that he had no hopes of being able to master any of the Innate-level techniques.What he was looking for at the moment were techniques that were practical, yet had few requirements in terms of talent. As for level, he figured that it would be better if it was beneath the Acquired level.As for those powerful techniques, he saw fit to just let the Passive System take care of them.As for broken pieces\u2026He deemed it imperative to find any pieces of those. Although the chances of finding such pieces were low, every book he read had something of that sort.Just in case, man!He turned around to look at Zhou Tianshen. Truth be told, he actually had high hopes for the other man.There was a saying about it, after all.What was it again?Luck favors the dumb?He might just actually run into some rare techniques.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: 55Chapter 55: Third Person on The Treasure HuntOn the second floor of the Spiritual Library Division.The place was different from the first floor, given that there were no shelves. There weren\u2019t even ancient texts or jade scrolls. The only things around were white halos spaced far apart from each other.Every single halo represented an Innate-level spiritual technique, and there were nearly one hundred of them to be found on the floor.Mu Zixi, with a rather bored look on her face, played with her pigtails as she walked past one of the halos.Unlike the others, she had set her sights on something and managed to find what she was looking for right away.It wasn\u2019t every day that they got to enter the library, so she didn\u2019t want to just register her stuff and head out so quickly. Everyone was still inside. It would\u2019ve been boring for her to stay outside all on her own, so she\u2019d stayed inside the library.She scanned her surroundings as she aimlessly walked around.The halos were rather mystical. They would light up immediately once someone entered them, preventing another from getting inside.Mu Zixi walked around and found something wasn\u2019t right. She counted the halos that were lit up.\u201cEight?\u201d\u201cWhy are there only eight halos lit up when there are eleven of us here?\u201d she thought.\u201cWhere are the other three?\u201cWe aren\u2019t allowed to enter the third floor, so are there still people on the first floor, then?\u201dShe frowned, finding this turn of events amusing, and ran all the way downstairs.\u2026Swoop, swoop, swoop.Swoop, swoop, swoop.Rhythmic and minute shaking sounds were heard. Mu Zixi sneaked up on the source of the sounds.\u201cZhou Tianshen?\u201d she thought.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201dMu Zixi was puzzled.She saw the stout kid pick up a book and shake it before returning it to its place and reaching for another one.That wasn\u2019t all. Mu Zixi looked on, finding it scary when he suddenly stopped at a corner and pounced on a dusty box, his eyes lighting up as if he\u2019d found some kind of treasure.He then got up there, pushed the box away, and started fiddling with the dust.He seemed to be having a good time.Mu Zixi was completely baffled, and was feeling a little puzzled at this sight. Who would\u2019ve thought the stout guy would actually enjoy games that were so childish?But this was the Spiritual Library Division. He was here to play games instead of selecting spiritual techniques?\u201cZhou Tianshen!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she yelled at him, arms akimbo.The stout guy, who was busy moving the boxes, was startled, but he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that it was only Mu Zixi.\u201cGosh, you scared me to death. I thought the caretakers were here\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph, so you\u2019re telling me that you can just fool around as long as the caretakers aren\u2019t here?\u201dZhou Tianshen was stunned when he heard this. Then, wiping the sweat from his brow, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not fooling around. I\u2019m looking for techniques!\u201dMu Zixi, amused, watched his blackened hand leave marks behind on his face and said, \u201cLook at your messy face. Since when do people go about looking for techniques like this?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you think.\u201d Zhou Tianshen said, disgruntled. Then he pointed at Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2019s looking for techniques like this too, okay?\u201dXu Xiaoshou?Mu Zixi looked in the direction he was pointing and immediately spotted a lanky figure.However, the sight that greeted them was completely different from what they\u2019d expected.Xu Xiaoshou, who was in his simple white garb, was leaning on a shelf, a book in his hands. He looked dazed, as if he were pondering some big question that was bothering him.The bit of sunlight coming from the windows above shone on the young man\u2019s chiseled face, making the scene look like something out of a painting.Zhou Tiansheng was completely baffled.Mu Zixi got engrossed in the scene for a bit before recalling how Xu Xiaoshou had wiped at his neck, saying that it stank. She then quickly snapped back to reality.She looked at Zhou Tianshen and snickered. \u201cWell, the way you both look for spiritual techniques is definitely really similar.\u201dZhou Tianshen was all quiet as he looked at his blackened hand, then at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s clean face, feeling that he\u2019d been several cheated.\u201cI think I need to explain myself\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need to explain anything. Better get your face washed instead.\u201d\u201cOh? Don\u2019t you wanna know the secret to that guy becoming the champion?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m no\u2026 huh? What did you say? Come again?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019d better just get my face washed.\u201d\u201cWait, hold on. Come here for a bit.\u201d\u2026Xu Xiaoshou naturally wasn\u2019t just acting cool in a sunny place because he\u2019d sensed the two\u2019s conversation and what they were doing.He was actually engrossed by the broken piece he\u2019d found.\u201c10 Sections of the Finger Sword?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou mumbled.He\u2019d actually been able to find quite a number of such broken pieces after searching for two hours. However, all those techniques required certain special elemental traits, and it\u2019d taken him just one look to tell that those weren\u2019t for him.All but the \u201c10 Sections of the Finger Sword,\u201d that is.The technique\u2019s level was unclear, and it didn\u2019t require spiritual strength. All the technique required was sword will and arts of the finger. When fully mastered, one could easily slice a river open with a single attack.It was as if the technique were tailor-made for him.The experience of a transported one was actually d*mn useful!The only thing that concerned him was if the sword finger technique would stack with Glow of Sharpness, yet it was also the part that got him thinking.According to the introduction, it melded sword will with one\u2019s fingers\u2026\u201cNot with any sword-like item, like \u2018All Things are Swords,\u2019 but with one\u2019s own fingers eh?\u201d he thought.This was just like the third way a swordsman could train in the way of the sword, then!The mainstream way of combining a sword with spiritual techniques was one way.Fighting with pure sword will that he created, which he\u2019d had no idea would actually work, was the second way.Yet this \u201c10 Sections of Sword Finger\u201d\u2026Combining sword will with one\u2019s own body?\u201cI guess you can find all manner of weird stuff under the sun\u2026\u201d he thought.He was completely shocked by this wild, unconventional way of thinking. Combining sword will and a sword-like item would produce Sword Telepathy. He wondered what combining sword will and one\u2019s own body would produce.\u201cHold on,\u201d he thought.\u201cSword will is something that gets produced from one\u2019s own training in the first place. Does the \u201ccombining\u201d concept even apply here?\u201cBut wait.\u201cIt says here that it could be done.\u201dHe was completely puzzled by what he was reading.He decided that if he were unable to find anything else, then he would settle for \u201c10 Sections of Sword Finger.\u201dEven if nothing else came out of his training with the technique, such a unique way of training would keep him occupied for a very long time.\u201cHeh, who was it who thought something this weird up? I guess I\u2019ve met my match, and whoever invented this was a genius.\u201dHe tried looking for the name of the creator. Unfortunately, it was a broken piece, and there was no mention of the creator.He packed his stuff and looked at the time. There were still four hours left, which meant he had a lot of time left to explore.So he went back to searching high and low.\u2026Swoop, swoop, swoop.Swoop, swoop, swoop.Mu Zixi rather regretted having bought Zhou Tianshen\u2019s mumbo-jumbo. She was holding two old books in her hands, and her favorite dress was all dirtied. She looked a mess.\u201cZhou Tianshen!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all!\u201d She forcefully shoved a book back onto a shelf.The bang startled him.He stuck his head through a crack in the wall, then said with a disgruntled expression on his face, \u201cOh gosh, miss. Don\u2019t you go scaring people like that! Becoming champion requires sacrifice, alright!\u201dMu Zixi was actually fuming at the moment, yet she laughed out loud when she saw Zhou Tianshen\u2019s face.His face was all blackened, and given that there wasn\u2019t enough light around, she was only able to see his white teeth.Pfft!\u201cI think you really need to wash your face. Hahahaha!\u201d\u201cShh! Keep it down!\u201d Zhou Tianshen shook the piece that he\u2019d managed to find in the crack. It was indeed a page from somewhere. \u201cSee?\u201d\u201cYou found something?\u201d Mu Zixi\u2019s eyes glittered, and she immediately headed over to him.Zhou Tianshen dusted off the page by blowing on it, causing both of them to cough.\u201cAn old image?\u201dThe image was of an old one-armed man lifting a saber while bending backwards, looking very twisted and weird on that tattered, old parchment.Mu Zixi immediately pouted. She could tell from one glance that the technique would fit Zhou Tianshen just right, but would be of no use to her.She was just about to grumble when she turned around and saw that dirtied man staring at that old image, seemingly in some sort of trance.\u201cYou learned something?\u201d She was stunned.\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cWhat Xu Xiaoshou said was true, then? That the treasures are indeed on the first floor?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dMu Zixi found her motivation for finding techniques there again, but then she quickly realized something, which caused her to freeze.Zhou Tianshen was in a trance, Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t around, then\u2026\u201cWho was speaking to me?\u201d she thought.She turned around in fright.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: 56She turned around to see a wrinkled old face underneath a straw hat. On that shriveled face of his, which was doing its best to force a warm smile, there were two massive dark circles underneath his eyes.But the distance between her face and his, which was less than an inch, was more than enough to scare her to death.Mu Zixi was so frightened that she was unable to even make a sound. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head, and her body stiffened before she fell backward onto the ground like a log.Thump.The old man pulled his hat down and watched her fall to the ground, his face deadpan.\u201cHmph, you\u2019ve caused enough trouble, rascal. I bet you would\u2019ve started digging at the walls next if I\u2019d let you keep you doing this.\u201dHe took the books from her hand, dusted them a bit, then put them back on the shelves.He then kicked the girl, who was lying on the ground, to the side. He moved to get ready to take care of the next one, but then frowned all of a sudden.He squatted down and lifted one of her hands.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he muttered in shock.\u201cSuch massive lifeforce\u2026\u201dThe old man was frightened, as he sensed that the lifeforce in her was so dense that it had almost concealed the presence of her wood elemental traits.Furthermore, he also sensed that not only was the suppressed wood elemental powers not dying, but it was also gobbling up that lifeforce as best it could to strengthen itself. This was what shocked him the most.\u201cWhat kind of a physique is this?\u201d\u201cWood element capable of absorbing lifeforce to strengthen itself?\u201dHis eyes glittered, as if he\u2019d come across some rare treasure.Yet, he turned his gaze to the shelf and then back again, obviously struggling inwardly.However, the struggle only lasted for a brief moment before a determined look came back into his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cIf you\u2019d appeared before me earlier, I might have just picked you instead.\u201dAfter coming to this decision, the old man no longer hesitated, and he kicked the girl aside.He lifted his head and squatted beside Zhou Tianshen. Then, he looked at the parchment, and his face twisted.\u201cHe\u2019s stunned?\u201cHow did something like this get out here?\u201cMan, are these few fellows rats or something?\u201dThe stout kid beside him seemed to move, and the old man put his face closer.Zhou Tianshen finally snapped out of the trance he\u2019d fallen under from reading the parchment. His eyes were filled with an excitement so intense that his hands, which were holding the image, couldn\u2019t stop shaking.\u201cSo, you\u2019ve learned quite a bit, eh?\u201d a hallowed voice seemed to say in his mind, and Zhou Tianshen nodded furiously.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot indeed!\u201cWhat Xu Xiaoshou said was true. So long as I keep practicing this blade technique, I\u2019ll be able to get to Innate-level blade will in no time!\u201d\u201cMu Zi\u2026\u201dHis mind was completely occupied by that image, and he was about to wave to Mu Zixi, just to tell her to come to take a look, before he realized that he\u2019d grabbed hold of something.That thing was warm, soft, yet rough.Zhou Tianshen turned around, a suspicious look on his face.An old face!An old face right before his very eyes!He saw a pair of sunken, dark eyes peering at him through his fingers, making him feel as if the reaper himself were staring at him.\u201cHoly sh**!\u201dZhou Tianshen\u2019s eyes lost focus. The shout had barely left his lips before he passed out from this utterly frightening scene.He stiffened, fell backward, knocked again the wall, then dropped to the ground with a thump.\u201cTsk!\u201dThe old man wiped his face and kicked the kid to a corner. \u201cOne more left!\u201d\u2026Swoop, swoop, swoop.Swoop, swoop, swoop.Xu Xiaoshou was doing two things at one time to be more efficient. He was shaking a book in one hand while holding a jade scroll in the other.His movements slowed for a brief moment, yet he didn\u2019t stop altogether.The jabs from those other two in the Information Bar in his mind had been gone for a long time, yet another new information line popped up.Being watched, Passive Point +1.That information made his skin crawl, and a shiver immediately ran down his spine, causing him to almost whip his hand at whatever was watching him.Yet, he held back the urge instead.He then kept telling himself not to act on impulse. Turning around would definitely be the end of him.\u201cWho\u2019s watching me?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou was utterly frightened, yet he continued doing what he was doing with his hands as he yelled deep down.He noted that his Sense hadn\u2019t told him there was anyone around him.\u201cNo, wait,\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat happened to the spiritual energy fluctuations from those two?\u201d\u201cWhy are they gone too?\u201dHe tried hard to shift his focus to the two\u2019s last location, and then saw the both of them passed out on the ground.\u201cSh**!\u201cSomeone got rid of them?\u201cIs the caretaker here?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart thumped furiously in his chest. If the person would just appear before him, he wouldn\u2019t feel so frightened.But the other person was watching him, while he was unable to see them.The fear of the unknown is the most torturous.Xu Xiaoshou carefully blew on the book, then put it back again, pretending to mumble without a care in the world.\u201cMan, I wonder just how many years it\u2019s been since someone last cleaned this place. What\u2019s with all the dust? Can\u2019t help it. Just have to shake all that dust away.\u201dHe stretched backward without turning his head around. \u201cI\u2019ve done enough charity on the first floor. Time to look for my own spiritual technique on the second floor, then.\u201dHe rested his hand on the shelf, then moved his legs. That was when he realized he was no longer in control of his own body.\u201cSh**!\u201d he thought.\u201cMove, d*mn it!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned glum all of a sudden, but he quickly adjusted himself and clapped at his legs.\u201cH*ll, legs got numbed from standing for so long. It\u2019s tiring work indeed.\u201cIt sure is tough being a caretaker of this place and having to take care of so many books every day. I have to say, I\u2019m impressed.\u201dHe was finally able to move his leg, and took a step up. Overjoyed, he rested his hand on the shelf, about to leave.\u201cHeh, you could actually detect my presence. Some progress right there,\u201d a jeering voice came from behind him.\u201cD*mn.\u201dXu Xiaoshou immediately covered his ears. \u201cI\u2019m getting so tired that I\u2019m hearing things now\u2026\u201dWith his legs becoming mobile again, he immediately strode forward, yet he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of being choked by fate itself.\u201cQuit pretending already.\u201cTurn around, now!\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked desolate, as he was forced to turn around. He then saw an old man in a straw hat with dark circles under his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201dHis fear was immediately dispelled and replaced with shock instead.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the old man who forced me to swallow that Infernal Fire Seed back then?\u201d he thought to himself.\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again\u2026\u201d\u201cElder Sang!\u201dHe immediately became furious as he recalled all the pain he\u2019d experienced that day. He was so furious he almost completely forgot the old man\u2019s status.He\u2019d sworn before that if he ever ran into that old man again, he would cut him into pieces. How could he forget him?He took one step backward and pulled Hiding Pain from his chest, then pointed it at the old man.\u201cOne\u2019s gotta live hard and fast, no?\u201d he thought.Whatever was left of Elder Sang\u2019s eyebrows raised when he saw that sword. He looked at the tip and traced the sword all the way back to Xu Xiaoshou without an ounce of emotion.\u201cEh?\u201dHe could only gasp before feeling as if he\u2019d been thrown into an icy hell for a moment, and his body felt cold all of a sudden.\u201cMy gosh!\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201cWhy am I pointing a sword at the caretaker??\u201cAm I crazy or what? He got rid of those two without making a sound! Am I trying to get myself killed?\u201dHe then slowly lifted the sword, twirling it about in the air for a moment before putting it back into the ring and flashing a beaming smile at the old man.\u201cHehe, I\u2019ve been looking at the technique for so long that I\u2019ve found it kind of easy to pick up a thing or two from it. I just feel like I have to play with it for a bit with my sword\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe, hehe\u2026\u201d\u201cSword techniques?\u201d Elder Sang took off his straw hat and took the book he\u2019d just put back. \u201cYou mean this 12 Punches of the Great Barren Lands?\u201dGulp. The smile on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face immediately froze.\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Getting PlayedChapter 57: Getting Played\u201cWhy are you here, sir?\u201dXu Xiaoshou tried his best to steady himself and explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t break any of the books or scrolls, and I didn\u2019t mess up the boxes\u2026\u201d\u201cRelax. I\u2019m not going to do anything to you.\u201d Elder Sang flashed him an amicable smile. \u201cWhat happened to those two was purely incidental. I\u2019m here specifically for you.\u201dXu Xiaoshou panicked even more. He\u2019d rather this old man were here for his head than anything else.What that old man did to him before had been excruciating.He wondered how the old man would deal with him next.\u201cLet me have a look at the technique that you\u2019ve picked.\u201d Elder Sang reached out his hand.Xu Xiaoshou took out the broken piece, wondering what the old man was up to.\u201cTen Sections of the Finger Sword?\u201dElder Sang frowned as soon as he took the piece. \u201cYou picked this thing despite it looking so broken already? You\u2019d be lucky to even get one section out of all ten!\u201dHe took the broken piece and flicked his hand, and an exquisite jade scroll appeared in his grasp.Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat is that old fart up to now?\u201cGive me back my broken piece!\u201d\u201cPretty, right?\u201d Elder Sang snickered.Xu Xiaoshou immediately got a bad feeling inside, but he couldn\u2019t do anything but nod.\u201cNice that you find it pretty. This is something I made specifically for you!\u201d Elder Sang then stuffed the jade scroll into his hand, then gestured with his chin. \u201cTake a look.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t wanna take a look!\u201d he thought.\u201cI want my broken piece back!\u201d\u201cPretty thing indeed.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou grinned as he pressed the jade scroll to his head, then scanned it with his will.\u201cInfernal Heavens?\u201dHis heart almost stopped right then and there at the familiar word.Infernal?He wasn\u2019t about to believe any claims about this thing if it had something to do with that Infernal Fire Seed he\u2019d swallowed back then.Xu Xiaoshou stopped pretending and handed the jade scroll back, saying, \u201cSir, you\u2019ve overestimated me. I really have very little talent, so much so that I was only able to master one move of that White Cloud Sword Technique, even after practicing it for three years. I\u2019m afraid that I wouldn\u2019t be able to master this.\u201dElder Sang waved his hand dismissively.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Talent and potential are not requirements for learning this thing. So long as your physical body is strong enough to resist the burning might of the Infernal Fire Seed, you\u2019ll do fine.\u201dXu Xiaoshou panicked. \u201cThe thing is I don\u2019t want to go through all that!\u201d he thought.\u201cI have the Passive System, man! Why the h*ll would I want to do this to myself?\u201d\u201cI could just slowly earn Passive Points. This thing here is no joke, man! One misstep and I could be reduced to dust!\u201dElder Sang pushed the jade scroll back, grabbed his hand, then sensed for a bit.\u201cHmm, you\u2019ve internalized the Infernal Fire Seed well. You\u2019re already halfway there. I definitely have a good eye.\u201dElder Sang then flipped his hand over, and that familiar scorching hot red seed appeared in his hand, which he immediately stuffed into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand.\u201cRegister this spiritual technique when you head out. Practice it well, and when you\u2019re done, come and look for me here again.\u201d\u201cTo h*ll with you!\u201d he thought.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna see your face anymore!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart almost seized as that terrifying pain and heat from the seed seemed to creep inside him again.He then realized that he couldn\u2019t just roll with whatever life threw at him, that he needed to resist sometimes.\u201cSir, I don\u2019t want to eat this thing\u2026\u201dShuu!Elder Sang flicked his finger and shot another seed into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s throat. Xu Xiaoshou swallowed it with a grunt.\u201cYou can keep this one for later if you don\u2019t want to eat it now. Let\u2019s eat another one instead.\u201d The old man said amicably, squinting at him.He then took out a jade bottle and carefully put the seed in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s hand into it before shoving it back to him and saying, \u201cNo need to hurry. Just take your time.\u201dXu Xiaoshou staggered and fell to the ground, his face drained of color.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d he thought.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna eat any of these!\u201dHe was entirely baffled. This trick had come so suddenly, making him think that the old man was entirely devoid of the air usually present in formidable seniors for having utterly relied on petty tricks.He no longer dared to do anything rash with that seed in his stomach, and maneuvered his qi to quickly stabilize himself.The heat in his body quickly rose, and his entire body became red hot again.He leaned on a bookshelf as steam emanated from his body and that familiar, intense pain came again, almost making him go crazy.Attacked, Passive Points +1.Attacked, Passive Points +1.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe knew there\u2019d be a massive rush of Passive Points, but he wasn\u2019t happy about it.That was the price of pain!No!That was the price of being in h*ll!If he started refining it, the pain would only get a lot more intense.\u201cWasn\u2019t I here to pick my spiritual technique?\u201d he thought. \u201cHow did this happen\u2026\u201dHe looked dazed, as he felt like his soul was leaving his body.Elder Sang, regardless of this, put ten bottles of pills before Xu Xiaoshou, causing the latter\u2019s face to twitch.\u201cRed Gold Pills?\u201d he thought.\u201cTen bottles?\u201cSo, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening\u2026\u201dHe felt as if fate were toying with him.\u201cYou\u2019ll have a bright future ahead of you after you tough through this. Trust me.\u201d The old man rummaged for a bit, then put down yet another bottle of pills.\u201cWork hard!\u201cAnd remember to come and find me again after you\u2019ve mastered it.\u201d After saying this, he disappeared from where he was standing.Encouraged, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou sat where he was, dazed, feeling as if life had lost all meaning.\u201cWhy?\u201d he thought.\u201cI fought so hard and became champion, yet I didn\u2019t get to enter the Inner Yard?\u201d\u201cI finally got a once in a blue moon chance to go into the Spiritual Library Division to pick a spiritual technique, and yet I got played instead?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was unable to find an explanation for it. He felt like the world was out to mess him up.\u201cForget it. Whatever\u2026\u201dHe registered his spiritual technique in a dazed state and left the place.\u2026Back in the Inner Yard.In some spiritual spot.Bubble, bubble.A wine flask, which was made of spiritual silver jade, burned nicely.Lan Xinzi retracted the blue flames in her hand and opened the lid of the flask. The fragrance of wine went everywhere.She took two cups, picked up the flask, and walked with steps as light as a feather to the side of a man training with his eyes closed.\u201cMaster Zhang, this is the Murky Sage Brew that the head of the clan just sent here. How about trying it out for a bit?\u201d she probed.Zhang Xinxiong opened his eyes, coming out of his training state. He looked at the woman before him.He had to admit that Lan Xinzi was an absolute beauty.Her dress flowed like a goddess\u2019s, and her shoulders were barely covered. She didn\u2019t need much makeup to make flowers lose their radiance in her presence.\u201cYour dress fell down. Wear it right.\u201d Zhang Xinxiong looked away.\u201cWhat do you mean? This is how it\u2019s worn\u2026\u201d Lan Xinzi\u2019s lips twitched all of a sudden, and she said slyly, \u201cWell, I have two cups in my hands, and, as you can see, my hands are full, so how about you straighten it for me, then?\u201dZhang Xinxiong took the cups away and gulped the contents down. \u201cStraighten it yourself.\u201dLan Xinzi only rolled her eyes at him, then went on to pour him more wine, saying in his ear, \u201cNews from the clan.\u201d\u201cSpeak properly.\u201d Zhang Xinxiong tilted his head away and frowned. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d\u201cThe thing about Wen Chong getting killed. Did you actually think you could hide it?\u201dLan Xinzi stretched about lazily, putting up quite a show before the man, and continued.\u201cYour second mother would only need to whisper at your father\u2019s ear. You see, more news here now.\u201d She lightly blew on the wine in the cup while casting a glance at the man, looking alluring.Zhang Xinxiong snickered. \u201cWhat does the matter with the Wen family have to do with me?\u201d\u201cThat guy is your cousin!\u201d\u201cJust a good-for-nothing piece of trash.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLan Xinzi was speechless for quite a while.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Get me a Flask, and Kill Someone for Me\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do it yourself, I could kill Xu Xiaoshou for you.\u201d Lan Xinzi shrugged, causing her dress to slip even further down her shoulders.\u201cOne of the thirty-three of the Inner Yard kill one of the Outer Yard disciples who just became the champion of the Contest of Wind and Cloud?\u201d Zhang Xinxiong stared directly at her. \u201cHow would you do that?\u201d\u201cAssassination.\u201d Lan Xinzi raised her chin a little, and a sneering look appeared in her eyes. \u201cYou said it yourself. He\u2019s but an Outer Yard disciple.\u201d\u201cHeh, he\u2019s but an Outer Yard disciple, eh?\u201cKilling Xu Xiaoshou would indeed be simple, but do you really think you could fool the enforcer elder of the Spiritual Law Division so easily?\u201d\u201cKill him today, and you\u2019d be executed tomorrow.\u201d Zhang Xinxiong smirked.\u201cSo you\u2019re worried for me!\u201d Lan Xinzi immediately flashed him a beaming smile.\u201cI just don\u2019t want to have myself cornered over someone like that.\u201d Zhang Xinxiong looked into the distance, a spirited look on his face. \u201cThe Tiansang Prefecture is nothing to me. Dongtianwang City is where the truly strong ones will fight in half a year.\u201dLan Xinzi stared at his chiseled features with yearning in her eyes. Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s mettle, which befitted a supreme overlord whom all submitted to, was what struck her the most.She thought that it was quite a pity that he didn\u2019t fancy her at all.Zhang Xinxiong turned around and looked at her instead, causing her to become flustered, then said in a serious tone, \u201cGet someone to keep a close eye on Xu Xiaoshou. Remember, don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cMy Lord Master Zhang.\u201dLan Xinzi then snickered and asked, \u201cMore wine?\u201d\u201cNo. I need to head out.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cNone of your business.\u201dLan Xinzi\u2019s expression immediately changed, and she slammed the flask down on the table, shouting, \u201cYou\u2019re going to find that b**ch Rao Yinyin, aren\u2019t you?\u201dZhang Xinxiong halted and slowly turned around. The look in his eyes made him look like he was about to eat someone. \u201cSay that one more time.\u201dLan Xinzi backed away and fell on a chair.Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s terrifying aura washed over her like a tsunami when he was angry. Despite being at Upper Spiritual Level just like Zhang Xinxiong, she still was unable to resist.Yet, Lan Zinxi didn\u2019t just back off this time. She immediately stood up and shouted furiously, \u201cYou won\u2019t even be able to get inside her place. You\u2019ve tried over and over. What\u2019s the point in doing it again?\u201dZhang Xinxiong walked up to her with heavy steps. His expression was glum as he pushed her onto a chair and said slowly, \u201cThere are some things that are beyond you.\u201cYou have good talents, and you\u2019re now part of the Inner Yard, so devote yourself to your training and forget about everything else.\u201cKnow your place. You\u2019re but a servant of the Zhang family, a messenger\u2026\u201cAnd nothing more.\u201dLan Xinzi stared at Zhang Xinxiong with a blank look in her eyes until the man was no longer within sight. Then, her stiffened body immediately slumped over, and she felt that her back was drenched in a cold sweat.She then laughed at herself, realizing that the gap between them in terms of level and status was something that could never be filled in that man\u2019s eyes.That fact had remained the same, even after she became one of the thirty-three in the Inner Yard.Crack!She then shattered the flask made of spiritual silver jade by sweeping it to the floor, and the fragrance of Murky Sage Brew immediately filled the entire place.She stared at the pieces on the ground with teary eyes.The very next second, she siphoned spiritual source and dried her eyes.\u201cHe Yuxing!\u201dAt that moment, a man came in from outside the compound. He looked dashing, and wore a sword at his waist. He looked like he\u2019d been waiting for a while.\u201cWhy do you have to do this to yourself?\u201d He Yuxing\u2019s eyes, under those vibrant eyebrows of his, were filled with hurt and pity. He stepped on the wine and started picking up the pieces of the flask.\u201cLeave it be.\u201d Lan Xinzi waved her hand, and blue flames sprouted from the ground, causing him to back away.\u201cThe flask was his, and I broke it.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cGet me one that looks just like it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWill do.\u201d He Yuxing snickered bitterly and turned to look at her, but she was gazing far into the distance.Just as Zhang Xinxiong never saw her as anything more, she too never regarded He Yuxing as anything more.He shook his head to dispel his messy thoughts.\u201cA flask. That\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dLan Xinzi straightened her dress and rose, heading for the door.\u201cKill someone for me.\u201d\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou.\u201d\u2026Asschhuumm!\u201cWho\u2019s talking about me?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought.He rubbed his nose.If he had to name the prettiest girl he\u2019d ever seen so far, it would probably be the woman in the red dress who went to the group matches with Su Qianqian that day. The woman had even shot him a seductive look when she left.\u201cShe\u2019s probably the one thinking about me, eh\u2026\u201cI wonder what her name is\u2026\u201cSigh. I guess being good-looking does come with the perk of being unforgettable.\u201dXu Xiaoshou shifted his focus. He had returned from the Spiritual Library Division and was currently spacing out on his bed.That trip had been nothing short of mystical. He remembered the sympathetic look on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s face when he\u2019d finished registering; the older man had been so sympathetic he\u2019d even offered him words of encouragement when he left.\u201cJudging from Xiao Qixiu\u2019s attitude, that old man may actually be of a higher status. But Xiao Qixiu is already an enforcer elder, no? What could that old man be, then?\u201d\u201cThe dean?\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be right.\u201cThe dean is someone named Ye Xiaotian\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou rolled around on the ground. He was unable to get on the bed, as he would reduce the bed to charred pieces if he were to lose control, and that would be utterly terrifying.The temperature on the surface of his body had already burned the blanket and sheets to cinders.\u201cWhatever. No more thinking about that d*mned old fart. Gets on my nerves every time I think about him\u2026\u201dDue to all that had happened, he had to resign to his fate of becoming a guinea pig of some sort, as the old man seemed to be doing some kind of experiment with him.Objectively speaking, there were pros and cons to it.Xu Xiaoshou took out the jade scroll and pressed it to his forehead, extending his will to learn what was in it again.\u201cInfernal Heavens\u2026\u201dThat was an extremely special type of spiritual technique that didn\u2019t have a grade designation.Yet, from his perspective, things that lacked a grade designation were probably the most formidable types of all.In actual fact, this wasn\u2019t far from the truth. The prerequisite for picking up this skill was to have Innate-level Physique with the addition of a fire elemental treasure\u2014the Infernal Fire Seed.Training this skill was straightforward and simple. So long as one was able to withstand the might of the seed, one would gain the \u201cInfernal Spiritual Source.\u201dHe was very familiar with Spiritual Sources.When one was at Spiritual Cultivation Level 10, absorbing ambient spiritual energy would enable one to cultivate Spiritual Strength at one\u2019s energy reserve. After one had gotten to the Innate Stage, said Spiritual Strength would then become Spiritual Source and would amplify the might within by several times over.That technique, which he was currently training in, would enable one to cultivate the unique Infernal Spiritual Source once one mastered it, regardless of one\u2019s level. It was indeed something fearsome and supreme, yet that was also a testament to the difficulty of acquiring it.Xu Xiaoshou bared his torso as he sat cross-legged on the floor with steam emanating from him all the time.He had actually yet to get into the zone.According to the introduction, the longer the Infernal Fire Seed stayed in one\u2019s body, the more unstable it would become, which fitted his speculations.This thing was indeed a time bomb!He shot a glance at the red interface in his mind.Passive Points: 48662.According to his previous experience, internalizing that thing would require four to six hours, and getting through that stage would earn him a hefty sum in Passive Points.\u201cAlright. Time to eat it up.\u201dXu Xiaoshou steeled himself. While the pain was still there, having been through the process and succeeded once, he deemed that nothing untoward would happen, so long as he was cautious.He even began to look forward to his transformation after the session was successful.The fire elemental Infernal Spiritual Source.That would be akin to having mastered Innate Elemental Powers of fire, man!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Fundamental Transformation of the Breathing TechniqueOver ten bottles of Red Gold Pills were laid before him in a row on the floor. It was quite a splurge.Xu Xiaoshou was ready, and yet he still hesitated nonetheless.Through the use of Breathing Technique, he\u2019d been able to shorten the refining time from about a month to four to six hours.But at that time his Breathing Technique had been at level six.After many trials and errors, he had basically figured out that every single passive skill would be fundamentally transformed after breaking into Innate Level.He wondered if that would enable his Breathing Technique to break through Innate Level and become something he could manipulate.For instance, he would like to be able to control the amount of scorching heat he took in with each breath.Because if that were the case, it would apparently enable him to drastically reduce the pain and risk involved.But what if the thing took a different turn, and instead of enabling him to control amounts, it enabled him to derive pleasure from it?He shuddered at the thought, finding it terrifying.He turned to look at the red interface. There were three technique bars with a total of six passive skills between them, and five were already at the Innate Level.The only one left at the Acquired Level looked out of place.He was somewhat OCD, so this bothered him somewhat.\u201cWhatever. You can\u2019t stop eating because you might choke. I still need it so it can level itself up on its own in the future.\u201dXu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and exchanged his Passive Points for five Skill Points, then immediately dumped them all into Breathing Technique.Breathing Technique (Acquired, level 7).Breathing Technique (Acquired, level 8).Breathing Technique (Acquired, level 9).Breathing Technique (Acquired, level 10).Breathing Technique (Innate, level 1).The Information Bar quickly refreshed, and several messages went by. Xu Xiaoshou felt somewhat better, but the change wasn\u2019t that noticeable.He shuddered when the last message appeared.He felt himself become a spirit-gathering array. Spiritual energy was absorbed, and the surface of his body became misty.Pores all over his skin opened the very next instant, with every inch of his skin absorbing the spiritual mist around him.The more drastic change took place in his nose. He caused two mini tornados to form just from taking a whiff.That bit of spiritual energy that he absorbed in that one instant was able to compensate for a night\u2019s sleep altogether.Xu Xiaoshou felt rather nauseous. His hands, which were splayed on his knees, clenched and his face twisted, as if he were trying to hold something in.Hmm!His body shuddered slightly.Huff!Xu Xiaoshou clenched his teeth.Hah\u2026 Huuuhhh!He struggled to the best of his ability, deeming it imperative that he hold it in.He then leapt and threw a punch.The resulting force of the spiritual energy immediately blew the door to his room open.After exhaling hard, the pores all over his body closed, and he felt as if he\u2019d just weathered a storm that could\u2019ve killed him.\u201cNot bad. It\u2019s alright. Problem\u2019s manageable. Could continue training further in the future.\u201dThe rush that he felt was well over several times what he\u2019d felt before. However, after practicing it a few times, he managed to develop a measure of resistance to it, making the situation manageable.He then took out a Spirit Crystal.He then hesitated and put the thing away, taking out a Spiritual Cultivation Pill instead.\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. The harder I go, the sooner this could end.\u201dHe reached his hand out as far as it would go and pushed his head back as far as he could. Then, he took a light whiff.Voooom!The pill immediately disappeared.He was surprised.He was hardly able to keep himself steady, as he was feeling dizzy, and thought that he\u2019d taken it too far.But he had no time to dwell on it. That terrifying spiritual energy went all the way into his energy reserve through his nose, and the rush spread all over his body.Ohhh.He was only able to keep a stoic face for a second before feeling like he\u2019d melted into a puddle. His legs clamped inside, his wrists turned outside, and he slumped to the ground like mush.Hmmmmm\u2026He spasmed, and there was nothing he could do about it.Xu Xiaoshou wiggled and flapped about on the ground like a dying fish, yet as soon as his body touched the ground, he became a lot more sensitive.\u201cHickkk!\u201d he thought.\u201cHe-help me!\u201d\u2026After a while.He finally returned to normal and looked at the bottle of pills on the ground, still reeling from the shock and terror.He tested sniffing the pills and found that the rush had increased by three to four times from what it\u2019d been back then. He stopped testing it further and thought that it would be more or less the same with the Red Gold Pills.He came to realize something after all of this.Grade 10 pills, like the Spiritual Cultivation Pill and Red Gold Pill, would bring him a higher rush, as the level of his Breathing Technique had increased, yet there was still a limit to it.A pill could only hold so much spiritual energy in it. Being at level eight at the moment, he was no longer at a stage where sucking in a pill or two would bring about a breakthrough.Yeah, that would require over a dozen instead.However, that was beside the point. His progress at making breakthroughs was already deemed high enough, and he had no need to rush.More importantly, he was already able to see the limits of pills at such grades.Even if the pills were stronger, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to get more than five times out of them.Xu Xiaoshou found this range tolerable.But then again, he hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself from talking to ease the rush.He deemed that it would serve as an important piece of information that could serve as a reference for when he went about absorbing other pills in the future.Other than that, he\u2019d also discovered that Breathing Technique at Innate Levels brought about a fundamental change: it enabled him to breathe not only through his nose but through his pores.At the moment, every single pore on his body was breathing the spiritual energy around him.That was something terrifying in itself, as his training rate would spike by more than ten times.His speculation that he would be able to control the amount of whatever he could take in had been realized to a certain extent.He could manipulate the pores all over his body by opening and closing them at will.When he went all out with his training, he would even be able to form spiritual mist around his body. If he were to only breathe through his nose, his training rate would increase to a max of two to three times the usual.\u201cVery well.\u201dHe looked at the six Innate-level passive skills in his mind and smiled with satisfaction.If he were to treat them like spiritual techniques, it would make him a formidable fighter capable of six Innate-level spiritual techniques, and his growth from then on out would be practically limitless.\u201cEverything is set. Just one more thing.\u201cI have to get rid of this thing next.\u201dHe saw the Infernal Fire Seed in his reserve. He\u2019d had enough of its presence, as it prevented him from even sleeping in his own bed.\u201cI don\u2019t give a d*mn that you\u2019re a fire seed,\u201d he thought. \u201cH*ll, you could be a fire walnut for all I care. One way or another, I\u2019m gonna bust you open!\u201dHe took a Red Gold Pill and held his breath.The next second, veins popped out of his forehead, and his neck got all tense.As the pain built up, a faint red mist sprayed from the surface of his body. It was an air of bloodiness, but more importantly, it carried a charred smell with it.That was his new way of using Breathing Technique\u2014letting his body release all that gas in him.A spark of joy flashed in his eye. By letting his body spread the work out instead of letting his nose do it all, his pain was drastically reduced.It got to the point that he didn\u2019t even need the Red Gold Pills. All that pain spread thin was easily repaired by Eternal Vitality right away.Xu Xiaoshou clenched his teeth and said, \u201cGet back here!\u201dHe sucked in with all his might, taking in all that red mist that had just spread out. It was all suppressed by his new Breathing Technique, and all of it went straight to his energy reserve.\u201cBoy, that\u2019s some efficiency indeed.\u201d\u201cThe rate is more than double!\u201dHe remembered that when he\u2019d taken the energy in again before, the scorching energy had burned his meridians for one microcosmic orbit. But at the moment, this process had surprisingly and completely been omitted.\u201cThat\u2019s Innate-level Breathing Technique for you. Perks far outweigh its shortcomings.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Infernal Heavenly FlamesThe Infernal Fire Seed shrunk considerably.And the spiritual power in his reserves noticeably increased.Xu Xiaoshou stopped after he was done with the first round of refinement.The process was far easier than he\u2019d imagined it would be. All of the situations he\u2019d been afraid of happening hadn\u2019t appeared.He was feeling rather disgruntled instead, and wondered if the seed had become weaker.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cSomething is off.\u201dHe solemnly walked out his door, letting the night breeze blow through his clothes as he pressed a finger to his head and looked up at the sky with a rather lonesome expression on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the Infernal Fire Seed has gotten weak. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d\u201cI have become stronger!\u201dWhoooosshh.The cold breeze blew, and it looked like it was about to rain. It was then that he realized what \u201chigh and mighty,\u201d yet alone, felt like.He snapped back to reality after quite a while.Given that the Infernal Fire Seed was no longer a threat to him, he went on to simply hasten his rate of internalization, changing his goal from internalizing the seed to earning Passive Points. But there was also something else.He wanted to finish his training in \u201cInfernal Heavens.\u201dIt was undoubtedly a very powerful spiritual technique, and the no-brainer method of training was just what he was seeking.A determined look came into his eyes again as he sat down cross-legged, resisting the pain as he sprayed red mist all around him again.Absorb!Spray again\u2026Absorb!Spray\u2026\u2026Resilience came in handy at such times. It was something he\u2019d long honed due to his illness back in his past life.So long as it was something he saw to be a goal and there was hope, he would make sure that he succeeded one way or another, regardless of how painful the process would be.As time passed, that seed in his body shrunk again, and the Passive Points in his mind continuously spiked.Passive Points: 43220.Passive Points: 53449.Passive Points: 64122.It was nighttime, and the last bit of scorching heat was absorbed into his energy reserves. Spiritual power raged within him, and seemed to fill him completely.\u201cI did it.\u201dHe opened his eyes, which looked ablaze with heat.He sensed all that raging energy inside him, and that solid feeling of having become stronger was every bit on par with dumping Skill Points into techniques.The Infernal Fire Seed above his energy reserve was completely gone, yet his progress with cultivating Infernal Spiritual Source was still at just 80 to 90 percent.\u201cThat d*mned old fart. Don\u2019t tell me he even got that figured out!\u201dHe then took out a bottle containing another fire seed.His face twisted for a bit, as if he were a kid that still had homework left that needed to be done.\u201cD*mn it!\u201dHe sat down again and quit thinking about rest altogether. He looked up at the sky and decided to get his hands on the Infernal Spiritual Source before the sun rose.He swallowed his third seed and started refining it.The night was quiet, and the breeze gentle. It was drizzling outside.If Elder Sang were present, he probably would\u2019ve been astonished at the frightening resilience demonstrated by Xu Xiaoshou.While he had indeed given the kid the third Infernal Fire Seed, he never would\u2019ve expected the kid to actually internalize two seeds in a single day.It was more a matter of resilience, as only an insane masochist could\u2019ve done this.Poofff.Red mist sprayed, and he got high yet again.Attacked, Passive Points +1.Attacked, Passive Points +1.\u201c\u2026\u201dHis body was scorched again and again, yet with pain came Passive Points.Passive Points: 73322.Passive Points: 81008.\u201c\u2026\u201dTime passed. The misty spiritual strength in his energy reserve gradually became viscous, and the crimson colors gradually diluted into translucency as he neared the precipice.He knew that when his misty spiritual strength finally condensed into a gel state, that would be the sign that he had acquired the Infernal Spiritual Source.There were only bits of the seed left in him, and he breathed out in a frenzy, ignoring his pain altogether, and melded it with his energy reserve.Boom!His energy reserve rumbled, and his spiritual strength became completely condensed, turning into a crimson spiritual source that raged inside his energy reserve.The resulting force was released, and he made his breakthrough.He reached Spiritual Cultivation Level nine.The spiritual source cooled, and the crimson color faded into pure white. Everything became completely silent again.Huufff.He breathed out, his expression one of excitement.He did it!The Infernal Spiritual Source was white, packing massive power and super high temperatures. It could be as still as a mountain yet rumble like thunder.He then attempted to siphon the spiritual source in him. A sliver of it contained several times more heat energy than when it was conjured from mere spiritual power.He wrapped it around the tip of his finger and prod at the ground. His attempt unexpectedly caused the stone ground underneath to melt before his finger even touched it.\u201cMan, this is dope!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was excited. The force of his attack had very noticeably spiked.He wondered what would happen if he added Strengthen and Sharpness to it.Tsk, tsk.He clicked his tongue under his breath. He wondered if he could be considered an absolute genius for having mastered Innate Elemental Power of fire, and acquiring the Infernal Spiritual Source of such fearsome force, while still at the Acquired Stage.\u201cAlright. Time to get to Infernal Heavenly Flames, then.\u201dAccording to the jade scroll, the Infernal Heavens was the next step to go after acquiring Infernal Heavenly Flames.White spiritual source flowed and manifested at the center of his palm, and the temperature in his room spiked all of a sudden.He manipulated the spiritual source with his will and did his best to compress it. He was able to sense fearsome energy being condensed at a single point on his palm.He was sweating profusely. Not daring to let his guard down, he opened his Sense to the fullest and manipulated that bit of energy on his palm with utmost precision.He knew that that bit of energy could explode violently if he wasn\u2019t careful with it, and he had no intention of dying.He manipulated it with extreme precision, and made constant adjustments.That bit of white on his palm became so condensed that it utterly disappeared before long.Puk, puk.He could very clearly hear sparks going off.He took a look at his palm. Nothing could be seen, yet he was able to sense that there was a blob of extremely compressed raging energy there.The Infernal Heavenly Flames had no color. It was completely transparent, with white sparks erupting from it once in a while. It was capable of burning everything.That was how it was written in the jade scroll, and he wondered if any of that was just an exaggeration. He thought for a bit, then took out a piece of Spirit Crystal.The thing was rock solid and had a high energy density. It would serve as a very useful item to experiment with.He held the Spirit Crystal high above his right palm, which had that blob of invisible energy on it. Yet, he hadn\u2019t even released it yet before the crystal started to evaporate.\u201cThe hell\u2026\u201dHe was so surprised that he let go of the crystal.Fzzzz!The crystal fell, and when it was still a few feet away from the palm of his hand, it was completely vaporized, and dense spiritual strength spread all over the place.\u201cHoly sh**!\u201dHe was thoroughly frightened, finding the phenomenon utterly terrifying. The bit of flames in his hand was transparent and yet packed such terrifying heat. He wondered if there was anyone who could defend themselves against it.He willed and absorbed that bit of flames on his palm back into his energy reserve along with all that spiritual energy that the Spirit Crystal had released.Such was the way of his Breathing Technique. It took it all in without wasting even one bit.Haahhh.Xu Xiaoshou groaned comfortably as that bit of energy surged into his body and cured him of the exhaustion he\u2019d felt from working the whole night.He clenched his fists momentarily, finding everything to have worked smoothly. He was only one step away from completing that powerful spiritual technique of his.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: The House is Gone Again\u201cInfernal Heavens!\u201dOne could light up the air with that Invisible Heaven Flames, and then burn everything within one\u2019s vicinity within one\u2019s control.This was the most difficult step illustrated in the jade scroll.The practitioner had to risk their lives finishing all the prerequisites, and then develop a sense of the spirits of all things around them before he could ignite something remotely.Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes and attempted to find that spirit inherent in all things.He opened his eyes the very next second.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he thought.\u201cI\u2019ve finished the parts that require one to \u2018risk one\u2019s life,\u2019 yet why\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this \u2018sense the spirits in all things\u2019 so d*mn easy as well?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even need to use Sense. He could easily perceive the spirit in all things in a fifty-meter radius just by using the sword intent needed to use \u201cAll Things are Swords.\u201dHe caressed his chin and wondered if things were really just that simple.\u201cThat would be improbable. How could the jade scroll be wrong, eh?\u201cThere were also the experiences of two prior practitioners recorded in it. Although I don\u2019t know who they are, they shouldn\u2019t have gotten this part wrong.\u201cThey worked at it for months, so regardless of how much a genius I am, there\u2019s no way I could get it right in just one second, right?\u201dHe shook his head and closed his eyes, extending his senses.He tried using the second way\u2014the Passive Skill: Sense.He opened his eyes again a second later.\u201cGosh, this is strange. Why do I have the illusion that I\u2019ve done it again?\u201dHe cast away his doubts and skipped over the sensing part, getting to the last step recorded in the jade scroll.He condensed the Infernal Spiritual Source inside him, bent over, then sprung hard. From afar, he looked as if he were about to self-destruct.It went without saying that he wouldn\u2019t just explode. The invisible Infernal Heavenly Flames would be released along with the burst, latching onto the spirits in all things.Voom!The shockwave spread all over the place.He then looked around him and saw that nothing had changed.\u201cFailed, as expected eh?\u2026\u201d he thought.He was exasperated, but just when he was about to try again, he heard that familiar sound again.Puk, puk.\u201cSo, umm\u2026\u201cI did it after all?\u201dHe looked around him, and found that everything seemed to be rather hazy\u2014a sign of the Infernal Heavenly Flames at work.He was immediately elated, yet what happened next wiped all that elation away.Crack, crack, crack.Bits of white flames began to dance in the building all around him, and crackling sounds were heard everywhere.He was able to sense their presence, even if they were just sparks lighting up, and the flames covered everything in his place.Unlike usual flames, which just combusted and burned away, his flames exploded as soon as they appeared.The table, the windows, and even that bed which he had been reluctant to sleep on\u2026Everything cracked and then exploded to pieces.White spots then appeared on every single broken piece, and invisible sparks were ignited, burning everything down so completely that not even ash was left behind.\u201cOh my gosh, holy sh**!\u201dHe staggered and almost fell to the ground, but he steeled himself and immediately crawled out of his room.Boooom!Explosions were heard again as soon as he left the building, and the place exploded. Everything was in ruins.Puk, puk, puk.Vague white flames appeared on the broken pieces. There wasn\u2019t even the color or shape of fire to be seen anywhere, yet his place was already completely gone.Drip, drip, drip\u2026It began to drizzle outside, and he felt miserable.He watched everything with a dazed look on his face, and could only feel his heart ache.\u201cThis was a new house. Godd**amnit!\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been that long ago when the Spiritual Affairs Division had issued a mission and he spent a great many Spirit Crystal to build that house of his. But now it was all gone. Just like that.His hair was completely drenched by the rain. Whatever bits of bloodstains that had still been left after training were all washed away, and bloodied water began to pool at his feet.He sensed that his bodily injuries had all healed, yet he still felt a very noticeable pain.He grabbed his chest and fell to the ground.\u201cMy house, I\u2019m very sorry!\u201cI promise that there will be no next time!\u201dHe felt like crying, yet he had no tears to spare. If he\u2019d known this would happen, he would have refined the seeds on his bed.He\u2019d thought that he would get to sleep on the bed sometime in the future. Little had he thought that the eternal farewell would come so quickly.Puk, puk.The house before him was burned until nothing was left. The rain wasn\u2019t heavy enough to extinguish that terrifying Infernal Heavenly Flames of his.This utterly scared Xu Xiaoshou. If it hadn\u2019t been for his meticulous sense, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell that there were invisible flames burning. All he would have seen was the place being quickly burned down to the ground.\u201cNot even ashes left, huh\u2026\u201dHe insisted on staying around until the very last second, and was thoroughly frightened, as there really was nothing left.The place before him was completely barren, without even charred marks suggesting that the place had been burned. It looked like the house had never existed in the first place.\u201cIf I were to throw this onto an enemy\u2026\u201dHe shuddered in the rain, feeling a chill run down his spine.Even he, the practitioner, was terrified.That spiritual technique was nothing short of terrifying.He let the rain falling from above slap him on the face before pointing his finger angrily at the night sky.\u201cYou stupid thing up there! Give me back my house!\u201dFzzzz!As soon as he finished this line, the puddle in his place vaporized in an instant. The drizzle in the night had been rather cool, yet now the air felt scorching all of a sudden.Arrrggghhhh!He shouted at the top of his lungs at the sky. The raindrops, which had yet to fall to the ground, were evaporated while they were still airborne.The young man in the compound stopped doing anything stupid, seemingly stunned by what had just happened. The drizzle in the air mingled with the rising mist, making the place look like some sort of paradise.\u201cMan, this is awesome\u2026\u201dHe clenched his fist, feeling utterly overwhelmed.He had seen scenes like that in hot-blooded anime when he was younger, where one could cause the weather to change just by being angry.Boooom!Streaks of lightning flashed in the pitch-black night sky as thunder rumbled. He was utterly frightened.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault\u2026\u201dHe curled up and ran into an adjacent guest room.\u2026Crack, crack!Infernal Spiritual Source flared, drying his clothes and hair in an instant.Xu Xiaoshou grabbed at his clothes and commented in astonishment, \u201cMan, this is convenient.\u201dHis only regret was that there were still some bloodstains left behind on his clothes from when he\u2019d internalized the seeds. The rain couldn\u2019t get everything off.He grabbed his collar and sniffed, finding a rather mild stink emanating from himself.\u201cSeems like I need to take a bath after all.\u201dHe looked around him and exasperatedly slumped onto a wooden bench.The guest room was cramped, with only a dilapidated wooden bed without even a mattress on it taking over half of the space.The only other things in the room were a small wooden bench and a short table with a corner missing.Such a place naturally didn\u2019t have a private bathroom. Having to wash himself meant that he had to fetch water from the well near the spirit pool in the compound.He started to miss his own house terribly and swore to never act on impulse again.He made it a point that if he were to ever again need to train and test things that he was unsure of, he would do so in the compound instead.Nah, not the compound. Better do it at Goose Lake instead\u2026He recalled the time a while back when he\u2019d trained at Goose Lake and broken the white jade fence around the lake. Yet, the next day, he\u2019d found that it had been miraculously repaired.\u201cSo long as I don\u2019t get caught, that place will really be a free training ground.\u201dHe tapped his fingers on the table, finding it to be a feasible option. He then wondered if he should actually take a bath right then and there.He looked at the night sky. It was still raining out there, and sunrise was around the corner.While a bath was imperative, he deemed that there was something else more solemn and important that needed to be done before he went to wash himself.He rubbed his hands, looking forward to it. Then he saw the red interface in his mind.Passive Points: 81032.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: High SpiritsOver 80 thousand Passive Points!Refining those two Infernal Fire Seeds had alone given him over 40 thousand Passive Points each.Xu Xiaoshuo was utterly baffled. If not for the fact that leaving the seeds in his body would cause him too much pain, he would have liked to be burned for days and nights on end.\u201cBut I\u2019m not a\u2026 well, umm\u2026 masochist\u2026\u201d he thought.One way or another, he was fully capable of pretending to be beaten up by 40 to 50 people while actually enjoying the process, as if he were being given a full-body massage. He had no problem doing this. But then again, this was a lot different from leaving time bombs in his body that would explode at random.\u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that,\u201d he thought.\u201cIt\u2019s just too difficult to pull something like that off, after all.\u201dHe cherished his life very much. He then realized that he could easily trade the points for 50 Passive Keys.That\u2019s right! Fifty Passive Keys!With the two he\u2019d gotten from the previous draw, he now had a total number of 52 Passive Keys.He smirked like an idiot, feeling as if he\u2019d gotten a swelled head.There had been a time when he\u2019d had to be cautious, even when trading for just several such keys, yet at present, he had gotten to the point where he could trade 50 keys without batting an eye.\u201cAll that hard work just for this moment, eh?\u201cAs for why I left 30 thousand Passive Points behind\u2026\u201cWell, people need to have dreams, don\u2019t they?\u201cI remember that I hit a double kill last time. If I were to get a triple kill this time, then convert 30 thousand Passive Points to Skill Points, oh boy, that would be insane\u2026\u201cSix plus three equals nine Innate-level Passive Skills, man!\u201d\u201cHehe, hahahahaha\u2026.\u201dHe started gleefully imagining his future. He got so excited he slammed his hand down on the table, which he almost ended up wrecking due to almost having failed to control his strength.\u201cLet\u2019s get to it.\u201dHis expression turned solemn as his will came above that red wheel. Then he dumped 10 keys into it without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\u201cHah!\u201d\u201cRNGesus bless me!!\u201dThe cramped guest room echoed with the loony young man\u2019s shot. Xu Xiaoshou then pressed his hands together in prayer, acting devout as he took a look at the Information Bar.Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!You got one key!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!\u201cGo**amnit!\u201cOne key out of 10 draws? That\u2019s it?\u201cDamn you\u2026\u201d He clenched his fists, so frustrated he almost made to break something.\u201cOkay, calm down.\u201d\u201cNow\u2019s not the time to get angry, at least not yet. Forty more draws to go, after all.\u201d1He looked like he\u2019d expected this to happen.\u201cThis d*mned System is really getting ridiculous, and the rates are really dropping like nobody\u2019s business. Worse still, the wheel is still covered in grey mist, and I have no idea how this thing works.\u201dHe calmed himself, reminding himself that he was a man with a big heart who could stay unfazed in the midst of a storm.With a boom, the table broke, and Xu Xiaoshou leapt up from his chair.\u201cHah!\u201d\u201cRNGesus bless me!\u201dWithout giving any prior warning, he went on to make 10 more draws, thinking to catch the System by surprise.Thank you for your patronage!You got one key!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!You got one key!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!You got one key!\u201cD*mn you, d*mn you, d*mn you!\u201dHis face immediately turned pale, and he felt cold all over. He looked like he was struggling to even stand.\u201cTwenty draws and only four keys?\u201cDo you have to play me like that?\u201d\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have at least pitied me for having gone through all that pain from refining the seeds?\u201cOkay. Maybe it\u2019s because the room has bad Feng Shui.\u201dHe took a deep breath and opened the door and windows, then stood at a different place inside the room. He felt his mind become a lot clearer.\u201cAlright! Maybe luck will finally come to me after doing this.\u201cOn to the next 10 draws!\u201dHe leaned on the board near the window, pretending to be calm as he looked at the Information Bar.Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Fundamental Passive Skill acquired: High SpiritsThank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Crack!He shuddered when he read these lines and ended up tearing the board away from the window, causing it to be wedged between his waist and the wall.\u201cThere\u2019s finally something!?\u201dHe rubbed his eyes hard, and found that his eyes weren\u2019t playing tricks on him.He\u2019d actually gotten something, but not only that. That something was a Fundamental Passive Skill no less.\u201cThis is awesome!\u201d He drew the piece of board behind him and smacked it out of reflex, reducing it to pieces.Despite doing this, he still was unable to calm himself just yet.That Fundamental Passive Skill that he\u2019d last drawn\u2014Eternal Vitality\u2014was a godlike skill in his eyes. That skill had saved his life more times than he could bother counting.That one skill alone had enabled him to extend his combat duration, refine the fire seeds, and more.It had gotten to the point where he no longer needed Red Gold Pills, and at the moment, he\u2019d gotten yet another Fundamental Passive Skill.\u201cHigh Spirits.\u201cThat\u2019s quite a name,\u201d he thought, pondering what the name could mean.Then he came to a sudden realization.\u201cSpirits, huh?\u201dHe extended his will to observe his entire body, especially his energy reserves.Fundamental Passive Skills would usually appear in his body somewhere, and the name of that skill suggested that it might very well be something for regenerating spiritual source.\u201cJust as expected\u2026\u201d The smile on his face couldn\u2019t have been any brighter.It was just as he\u2019d expected. The spiritual source regeneration rate in his energy reserves had been considerably amplified.Having acquired Infernal Spiritual Source, the nature of his spiritual strength had seen a fundamental transformation, which naturally meant a drastic decrease in the rate of regeneration.That one burst of Infernal Heavens hadn\u2019t just burned his house down. It had drained a considerable portion of his spiritual source.Yet, that vicious spiritual source saw an increase in its natural rate of regeneration, returning to a point comparable to what it\u2019d been before with his spiritual strength.\u201cH*ll, this is really gonna allow me to fight for a very, very long time.\u201dHe recalled his battle with Mo Mo.He recalled that he\u2019d almost been able to win near the middle of the match. The only thing that had prevented him from winning was him not being able to execute the third Blade-draw Technique due to low spiritual power.If he\u2019d had one such Passive Skill back then, he might have actually ended the battle right then and there, which would have prevented all that had happened after that, including being scalded by lava and such.\u201cThis is really one godlike skill, man\u2026\u201d He mumbled to himself.While the rate of regeneration still wasn\u2019t apparent at the moment, there was still room for growth.He continued playing with the pieces in his hand, and his laughter drifted out of the room through the windows and door, becoming a part of the dark night.\u201cBreathing Technique, Eternal Vitality, High Spirits\u2026\u201cAuto-training, HP recovery, MP recovery\u2026\u201cNow that I\u2019ve gathered all three godlike skills, I wonder if anyone will be able to stop me.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help the smirk that came onto his face, making him look like an idiot.He imagined himself charging into an army, his enemies all trying to overwhelm him with superior numbers, only to find after fighting several rounds that his HP and MP were all still full, baffling everyone around, causing them to eventually have no choice but to surrender and give him Passive Points as tribute.This scene kept playing in his mind.\u201cHuh, huh, huh\u2026\u201cHuhh, hahaha\u2026\u201cHahahahahhaha!\u201dHe laughed at the top of his lungs, sounding very arrogant. \u201cNo one can stop me, for I\u2019m now a god!\u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201dHe returned to his usual calm, looking like nothing happened before.He activated his spiritual source, causing the board to spark, then threw the board out into the rain outside.1Hehehe.He gave a sheepish grin. \u201cTwenty more draws to go.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: The Mystics of Drawing. Does it have Anything to do with Poses?\u201cHah!\u201d\u201cRNGesus bless me!\u201d1Xu Xiaoshou continued shouting in the same spot, which he deemed his Feng Shui sweet spot.Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!You got one key!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201dHe read the Information Bar in silence, yet he wasn\u2019t sad.Truth be told, getting just one Fundamental Passive Skill from 50 draws was already quite a bargain, but it still hurt to not get anything more.After all, after getting something once, who wouldn\u2019t want another?\u201cMaybe I should change how I\u2019m standing?\u201cHmm\u2026 no.\u201cIt\u2019s more like luck doesn\u2019t strike the same place twice.\u201dHe looked around the place, pondering what to do next.\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to stand in here!\u201cThis place is really a wreck.\u201dHe looked outside the window, thinking that maybe drawing in the rain would bring him greater luck.But wouldn\u2019t that look a little stupid?\u201cWhatever,\u201d he figured as he climbed over the window and got to the compound.Patter, patter.The rain kept falling.He then swept the floor with a low kick, kicking up quite a bit of the water that had collected on the ground and splashing it into the air.\u201cHah!\u201d\u201cRNGesus bless me!\u201dIn the midst of such a beautiful scene, he clapped his hands together, sucking in all the luck brought by the rain.You got one key!You got one key!Extended Passive Skill acquired: Recoil!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!\u201cHoly sh**!\u201cI really got something!\u201dShocked, he read the Information Bar, and was completely stunned for the moment.\u201cSomething from all first three attempts and now a passive skill?\u201cGosh, could I be any luckier?\u201cOkay, this is getting scary. Does one\u2019s pose really have any effect on the draw?\u201dHe felt like laughing like a maniac again. That passive skill was his second, which meant that he\u2019d scored a double kill.Taking into consideration that the two passive skills hadn\u2019t appeared at once, and considering that it got harder and harder to draw something from the system, he wouldn\u2019t get any luckier than drawing two passive skills in just 50 draws.\u201cRecoil.\u201cSomething of great use once it\u2019s leveled up.\u201dHe could more or less tell what the skill could do from the name alone.\u201cWhen playing a game, one isn\u2019t afraid of running into the enemy\u2019s tank but of the injuries hitting said tank could cause.\u201cNow that I have both \u2018Strengthen\u2019 and \u2018Recoil,\u2019 I\u2019ve just made myself into a literal meat tank.\u201cCoupled with \u2018Sharpness\u2019 and \u2018Sword Technique Expertise\u2019\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll have no problems attacking and defending, and now I could even give anyone attacking me a headache.\u201cThis is dope.\u201d The smirk on his face was so big and bright it twisted his face.\u201cJust who the h*ll could take me on, eh?\u201dHe clenched his fists and hit them together at 30 percent strength.There was a slight boom, and both fists bounced off of each other, just like if they\u2019d just hit some spring invisible to the naked eye.\u201cSomething isn\u2019t right\u2026\u201dHe deliberated for a bit and found that Recoil wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d initially thought.He figured that the effect that he\u2019d expected was more akin to \u201cbacklash,\u201d but Recoil was more about 'shock.\u201dThe recoil effect caused both fists to bounce far from each other, even though he\u2019d used very little force.\u201cThere really are ways one could make good use of this.\u201dHe was more overjoyed than disappointed. Compared to what he\u2019d expected, the Recoil skill would actually be able to do a lot more to catch an enemy off-guard when aptly used.He could just imagine. If his opponent threw a punch at him, he could just puff his chest out a bit, and his opponent would be sent flying uncontrollably. That would surely catch them off-guard.If he were to throw the Sword Web Style at such a moment\u2026\u201cSheeesh!\u201dHe was frightened by what he had in mind, finding what would happen to be terrifying.He then wondered just why his skills would look so disgusting and annoying despite their very hero-like names.Shouldn\u2019t they be skills of a hero?\u2026He finished all 50 draws. Despite not being able to score a triple skill, being able to bag a double skill still made him very pleased with himself.Huh?\u201cWhy are there 10 more keys around?\u201dHe read what was written below the red interface. It was stated very clearly.Passive Keys: 10.He was stunned, but he then recalled having got \u201cyou got one key\u201d many times in that 50 draws.\u201cTake care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves, eh?\u201cHaha, d*mn, really?\u201cTen free draws after 50 draws?\u201dHe was very gleeful. He wiped the rainwater off his face and looked around, then went on to squat on that decorative mountain nearby.\u201cWith my back against a mountain and my front facing water, this has to be a place where ultimate luck flows!\u201cHah!\u201cRNGesus bless me!\u201dHe slammed his hands on the ground, thinking it was a pity an array of any kind didn\u2019t appear, as that might\u2019ve heightened his chances.Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!You got one key!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!He was baffled.\u201cSh**!\u201dTen keys reduced to one. That highly anticipated third kill just wouldn\u2019t happen.He squatted below that fake mountain and read what was below the Information Bar.\u201cThirty thousand Passive Points\u2026\u201cHave to leave 20 thousand for level-ups. This is my capital, and I can\u2019t afford to waste it!\u201cTen thousand more\u2026\u201cOkay, whatever, let\u2019s go!\u201dHe then traded his points for nine more keys, gathering enough for 10 more draws.He thought about leaving 10 thousand more behind, yet given that his skills and levels were already full, there was no need to leave that 10 thousand lying around. As such, he thought it would just be better to put them all into drawing while his luck was still good.He\u2019d made his decision. \u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201dThe 10 draws resulting from the acquisition of Recoil confirmed his conclusion that drawing was a mystical thing that had more or less something to do with how one went about it.\u201cRight. Feng Shui spot, check.\u201dHe then glanced around the place. This was his compound, so there was naturally no one else there.He laid low on the ground on all fours.\u201cWell, this should do it.\u201cBut man, it sure looks embarrassing.\u201cGood thing that there\u2019s no one around.\u201cJust this once\u2026\u201cNo next time!\u201dHe narrowed his eyes and didn\u2019t look around, thinking that doing so would keep people from noticing what he was doing.He also did his best to keep himself hidden under the shadows of that fake mountain, as he thought the place was definitely some powerful spot.He felt for sure that the System not throwing something his way definitely had something to do with his posture.He was feeling so thoroughly embarrassed that he shouted \u201cRNGesus bless me!\u201d inwardly instead of out loud before dumping all ten keys into the wheel.This was how the Information Bar looked like next:Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Thank you for your patronage!Pfftt!He spitted blood right then and there when he saw this, and felt like he was about to pass out. He didn\u2019t think the System would deal him such a fatal blow in the end.All 10 draws and nothing!Not even a single \u201cYou got one key!\u201d\u201cSo, the story has to end in a tragedy forever, eh?\u201dHe wiped something off of his face, not quite sure if it was rainwater or tears, before dejectedly getting up.Passive Points: 21008.His eyes lit up. There were still 1000 points extra, and he wondered if he would score a miracle with just a single draw.He traded the 1000 points for a key and dumped it into the wheel without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Thank you for your patronage!\u2026Boom, boom, boom.Explosions were immediately heard in the compound, and several craters were seen in the ground.\u2026Passive Points: 20008.Passive Points: 8High Spirits (Innate, level 1)Recoil (Innate, level 1)He dusted his hands and nodded with satisfaction. While it might look like he had lost everything in that one night, things were actually the opposite.Eight major passive skills! All eight at Innate levels!\u201cThis is perfect!\u201d He immediately stood up and walked into the room. He was all drenched.\u201cTime to wash up.\u201cAnd head to bed!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Visitors in the Rainy NightFat geese patrolled the lake as the winds blew, and the rain drizzled, creating a hazy mist as two men walked in the night.\u201cHey, Kong, dun ya think that we should be lying in bed with butiful gals?\u201cZe weather, ze weather, makes people sleepy, man\u2026\u201dTwo men in black cloaks were walking along Goose Lake. One with the hood up and one with the hood down.Shao Yi wore his hood tight around his face as he took another mouthful of booze from his gourd then clasped his stomach as he belched.Blurgghh!Feng Kong took a look at the weather. The rainy night was blocking the sunrise, yet first light would come soon nonetheless.\u201cTimes like these are when people are least guarded.\u201dHe focused and leapt far away, advising his partner, \u201cDon\u2019t drink before you kill. It\u2019ll affect your judgment.\u201dShao Yi paused what he was doing with his hands, yet he maintained his speed and kept up with him.\u201cOh, relax. It be fine.\u201cDis no problem. I was about to tell ya to put your hood up. Rain wud get in the way of your sight, you know? That wud get in the way of you killing.\u201dFeng Kong wiped the cold rainwater off his face and said, \u201cThe rain is cold. It wakes me up.\u201dShao Yi clapped his gourd and twitched an eyebrow.\u201cYou see. Difwent people, difwent taste\u2026\u201cI like dwinking, you like rain. We got what we both want. Nice, right?\u201dThe corners of Feng Kong\u2019s mouth twitched. He stayed silent for quite a while before saying, \u201cNo problem with dwin\u2026 drinking. Could you at least speak like a normal person?\u201dPtuih!Noting that his speech was getting affected by that of his partner, Feng Kong decided to just shut up.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Shao Yi was enjoying himself. \u201cYa dun like what ya hear?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWell, I dun like your cold a** face too, looking like a saint or sumfing.\u201dFeng Kong stopped, looking very annoyed.\u201cWhat? Let\u2019s go!\u201d Shao Yi was exasperated.\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d Feng Kong\u2019s tone of voice plummeted, making him sound like some emissary of some icy hell.\u201cI know. We sud go back to sleep!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFeng Kong took a deep breath. His partner must be really drunk.\u201cForget it. No point being petty with him,\u201d he thought. \u201cThere\u2019s still business to take care of.\u201dHe took flight again.Shao Yi tipped his hood back a little with a shaky hand. Even though his face hadn\u2019t been drenched by the rain, it was still drenched in a cold sweat.\u201cHoly sh**, what did I just say? Am I looking to die?\u201cThat guy is Feng Kong, the Bloody Hands man!\u201cGood thing I managed to blow it over. Kong probably won\u2019t kill me after this.\u201dHis partner\u2019s low, icy tone after his slip of the tongue had immediately rendered him sober, and he\u2019d simply decided to play around and play dumb after realizing that he\u2019d said something wrong.The consequences would\u2019ve been disastrous otherwise.Shao Yi wiped all that cold sweat off of his face and adjusted his expression, immediately following after his partner.The rain kept falling, and seemed to have gotten even heavier.The geese at the lake huddled together as they gathered around the jade fence, trying to take shelter from the rain.Well\u2026Nice try, though.\u2026The speed at which the two moved along that winding path slowed considerably.\u201cDis way, right?\u201dShao Yi looked around him, and, truth be told, it had been quite a while since he\u2019d last gone to the Outer Yard. In fact, it\u2019d been such a long time that he almost forgot his way around. It was fortunate that the place had hardly changed. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to somewhat find his way around.He then saw someone in the woods, and was quite surprised.\u201cAre disciples of the Outer Yard so hudwoking? Raining and still working?\u201cWell, back den I stayed in that common house for a year. There were so many people in there and training was just impossible, so I had to come out\u2026\u201cInner Yard is a nice pwace, I hub my own pwace, and gals\u2026\u201dShao Yi reminisced as he continued drinking, totally oblivious to the fact that Feng Kong was getting increasingly annoyed.He took a gulp and went inside an empty compound.The compound was covered with an array, and only rainwater could get inside. There was also a huge field before that barrier, which was huge and could fit many people inside for training.\u201cTsk, rich kid, huh!\u201cBack den, I\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Feng Kong cut him off. \u201cThe target\u2019s right in front of us, and you still wanna yap away? Did you forget what I taught you?\u201dGulp\u2026 Shao Yi scratched his head sheepishly. He opened his mouth to answer the question, then shut up the next moment.He took another gulp to steel himself and added, \u201cKong, just let me do this one, and you stay behind and watch. You dun need to do this in the first pwace, so\u2026\u201dFeng Kong shot him a look, causing Shao Yi to immediately shut up and pretend to zip his mouth shut.\u201cGet going.\u201cBe mindful of how you do it. Get it done with a single hit.\u201dShao Yi nodded, and the gourd in his hand disappeared. He brandished two short swords, which he held in a reverse grip, and hid the blade in his sleeves before walking up to the place.He lifted his hand.Then he knocked on the door.\u2026The skin before him was so supple and had such a nice glow. Even though Xu Xiaoshou was unable to see the face clearly, he no longer cared.He reached out and was about to touch said skin\u2026Dum, dum, dum!When rushed knocks came from the front door.\u201cOh, d*mn you!\u201dThe supple body disappeared before his eyes, and he lunged at it in an attempt to catch it.Crack!Noise was heard from the bed, and he somehow lost his balance, like he\u2019d missed a step, and then fell hard onto the ground.His eyes flew open, his heart still racing. His eyes were full of displeasure.\u201cJust one more step!\u201dDum, dum, dum!The knocking was heard again.He then looked at the door, feeling very, very annoyed.\u201cJust who the h*ll is so damn senseless, huh?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat are they doing showing up at such a time?\u201cAs**ole. Can\u2019t you just let me sleep?\u201cWhy do you wanna get in the way of me sleeping?He put on his shoes and slowly walked to the living room. He put up his spiritual source to serve as an umbrella and shield himself from the rain.He\u2019d just washed himself not too long ago, yet had been waken up by all that noise not long after lying down. He couldn\u2019t afford to get himself drenched.He rubbed his drowsy eyes and walked past the compound before long. He put a hand on the handle.The wind blew and seemed to wake him up. He halted.\u201cHold on!\u201cJust who the h*ll is sick enough to come look for me at such a time?\u201dHe started to become suspicious. He had hardly any friends in the Outer Yard, and had only gone to the library with the staff back in the afternoon the day before. That meant that there was just no reason for anyone to come looking for him.He\u2019d even prepared to give himself a few days off.\u201cStaff members looking for me at such a time?\u201dHe felt that his turn of events was rather ridiculous. As such, he focused and extended his Sense through the barrier to check out what was going on out there.A man wearing a black cloak, his face concealed under the hood, was standing outside. Despite the dark of night, he was still able to clearly make out the man\u2019s expression.The man looked plain, and seemed to behave very courteously, as he didn\u2019t keep banging on the door.Huh?Another one right behind him?\u201cSh**, is this guy sick or what. It\u2019s raining, and he\u2019s already wearing something with a hood, yet he took to revealing his face and standing with his arms crossed in front of his chest?\u201cWhat\u2019s with all this pretense?\u201cWho the h*ll would bother looking at you during the night?\u201dHe sensed that something was off, yet he was unable to place what exactly was wrong.More importantly, he didn\u2019t know either of these two people, and he wondered why they were here in the first place.Furthermore, he wondered why they\u2019d showed up at such a time.The sound of the rain seemed to have gotten louder than before.His hand remained resting on the handle, yet he didn\u2019t just pull the door open, nor did he pull his hand back. His heart rate quickened somewhat as he took a look at the night sky.\u201cA rainy night\u2026\u201cSomeone\u2019s here to kill me?\u201dHe felt his skin crawl, yet he found the thought rather ridiculous. He must\u2019ve read too many novels. Why would someone come to kill him without good reason?He felt that his social life was rather decent and that he had never made any enemies.All three of them were patient. All three of them were quiet. All three of them didn\u2019t move.He sensed that the man outside the door was still courteously waiting.The night was silent again all of a sudden. There was a wooden door, and three figures standing around it.The rain, on the other hand, was loud. It resounded far and wide along with the knocks on the door, and through the noise a familiar song could be heard:\u201cLittle pig, little pig, let me in\u2026\u201cDum, dum, dum.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: You\u2019ve finally Found MeShao Yi frowned.\u201cHe isn\u2019t home?\u201dHe\u2019d been waiting for quite some time now, yet there were no movements from inside. Someone would\u2019ve answered the door by now if there was actually someone home.Being woken up in the middle of the night like that, anyone would have at least been irritable enough to check who was at the door.He looked at the barrier wrapping the wooden door. It was entirely impossible to break through it with sheer force alone, and doing so would definitely cause some noise.But then again, dawn would soon come. He couldn\u2019t just keep waiting.\u201cWhatever,\u201d he thought. \u201cJust do it, then.\u201dHe drew his short swords from his sleeve and was about to attack when another hand pressed his hands down.Feng Kong\u2019s voice pierced right through the barrier.\u201cXiao Qixiu of the Spiritual Law Division here.\u201d\u201cOpen the door.\u201dOn the other side of the door.Xu Xiaoshou was immediately alarmed and wanted nothing more than to just run, but he stopped himself nonetheless.The man mimicked Xiao Qixiu\u2019s voice so well that if his Sense hadn\u2019t told him what the two outside looked like, he would have actually opened the door right then and there.At the moment, the man knocking on the door was holding two short swords.If at this moment Xu Xiaoshou still hadn\u2019t been able to guess what these two outside were up to, he\u2019d be better off dead.\u201cWhat the h*ll is happening?\u201d\u201cWhy are there people here to kill me?\u201dHe was flustered and broke out in a cold sweat. He wracked his brains, yet was unable to find a way out.He extended Sense to its greatest range, yet the two at the door still looked like they were common folk and seemed to have no powers at all.However, he was able to tell that these two were at least at Innate Level, and they were anything but common, even among those at Innate Level.Being at Spiritual Cultivation Level meant that he was able to detect a specific mystical aura signature unique to those at Innate Level, making it easy to tell them apart.These two were well-guarded that it was obvious they were trained in some kind of powers for concealing their powers.It was entirely possible that these two were professional killers.Dread was written all over his face.The spirit place was protected by a massive array, which made it impossible for those outside to get in without permission unless they were exceptionally and unbelievably powerful.He was able to immediately rule that out, judging from the age of those two.As such, there was the question of where such powerful Innate Level fighters could be from.There was only one answer to that question.The Inner Yard.He immediately shuddered all over, wondering why the h*ll someone from the Inner Yard would want to kill him.He wracked his brains looking for a solution, but his neurons felt as if they were dying en masse at the moment, as his brain simply refused to come up with a possible reason behind this.But he knew that if he didn\u2019t make it through the night, this place would be his grave.The harder he wracked his brains, the more afraid he became.According to what he knew, the only one from the last batch who\u2019d joined the Inner Yard was Su Qianqian, and no one else had joined the batch before hers. He knew next to nothing about the batches before that.Yet, that information was more than enough.If those people were truly from the Inner Yard, then they would have already reached Innate Level two to three years ago.\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat kind of a joke is this?\u201cWhat have I done to warrant the two of you coming after my head?\u201cAnd since when have I done anything to offend the two of you?\u201dHe was so terrified that he almost fell to his knees. He extended his Sense at those two after developing some early speculations.\u201cThe one nearest to the door seems to have some bit of Innate presence, yet the one behind him\u2026\u201cSh**!\u201cAt the very least, one is at the peak of Origin Court level, and the other is at Voidness Level or maybe even higher.\u201dHis heart sank right then and there.Even at early and middle sub-levels after breaking into the Innate Stage, there would still be such a large gap between them that even someone at Spiritual Cultivation Level 10 wouldn\u2019t stand a chance at fighting them.Worse still, the two outsides\u2019 cultivation level was far higher than those early and middle sub-levels.The way he saw it, the two standing outside weren\u2019t just Inner Yard fighters; they were reapers coming to claim his life.He wasn\u2019t arrogant enough to think that just because he\u2019d managed to draw two Innate Level passive skills and had acquired Infernal Heavens that he was capable enough to fight against those at Innate levels.He certainly wasn\u2019t about to think that he could fight two of such beings.If he were to do such a thing, it\u2019d be the same as handing his head over on a silver platter.\u201cHow should I go about this?\u201cRunning is impossible. No way I could escape from these two.\u201cBut if I just stay around\u2026\u201dHe gulped, feeling very frustrated. The chances of him dying were so staggeringly high that he felt that he\u2019d reached the end of his journey.\u2026On the other side of the door.The two looked at each other. They basically knew what was going on.Either no one was inside, or their target knew who they were.Although the latter was unlikely, it was nonetheless a possibility.According to intelligence, the champion of the Wind and Cloud Contest from the Outer Yard, despite being known to only be of Spiritual Cultivation Level Eight, had Innate-level physique and Innate Sword Will, so there was no telling what else their target was capable of.\u201cLet\u2019s move!\u201dFeng Kong tilted his head, and Shao Yi\u2019s aura burst right then and there, coalescing raging spiritual source on his short swords. He looked like he was about ready to cleave a mountain.Creak.The barrier parted, and the wooden door opened.\u201cSh**!\u201dShao Yi immediately pulled his aura back, but the attack had such a massive amount of energy in it that cutting it off in the middle almost caused him to spit blood.The two of them looked at each other and saw the cautious look in each other\u2019s eyes. Each immediately put his guard up.Something was definitely wrong!They were professional killers, and Feng Kong had almost been able to get the red hunter token of \u201cthree joss sticks,\u201d which meant he was naturally sensitive to danger. He knew full well that one had to give one\u2019s all, even if one only had to kill an ant.Feng Kong wouldn\u2019t have tagged along on this mission otherwise.\u201cGet inside.\u201dBoth of them cautiously headed into the compound, and the next second, they were stunned by what they saw.The ground\u2026Why were there so many craters inside?Had a war been going on in here?While having one\u2019s own compound among those of the Outer Yard was considered quite an achievement, the quality of such establishments was nonetheless far below that in the Inner Yard. They looked around and felt the place to be rather empty.It seemed that the place was even larger than their own.\u201cNo, hold on.\u201cIt feels like\u2026 Something is missing in here?\u201d Shao Yi thought.He took a look in the adjacent wooden shack to the side and found the place to be rather shabby.\u201cWhy live in such a broken hut? Are you telling me that Xu Xiaoshou could afford a compound, yet not a house?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201cThis is probably the guest room!\u201dShao Yi seemed to recall something as he looked at the side of the shack and found only a huge, empty space.\u201cShouldn\u2019t there be a main house over here? What happened to it?\u201dIt turned out that the empty, vast feeling they\u2019d sensed before was basically due to private compounds found within the spirit palace that basically consisted of a main house and a guest house.Yet, this place, which should have had a main house on it, was vacant.\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201cWhat the h*ll just happened here!?\u201dShao Yi was frightened.Checking out terrain was a necessary skill for any killer, and surveying the terrain was something that they could almost finish in less than a second.Furthermore, Shao Yi seemed to immediately realize something after seeing the odd way things were placed and all the craters on the ground.He wondered if there had been a huge battle fought in the compound.\u201cWho goes there!?\u201d Feng Kong, who was right beside him, shouted. Shao Yi was startled, and he turned around, finding a lean figure standing on top of that fake mountain in the hazy rain in the night.Xu Xiaoshou?No!Not necessarily him. Maybe the other guy from that huge battle.Shao Yi wasn\u2019t the only one speculating this. Feng Kong\u2019s speculation was basically the same. Both of them thought that there was more going on here than what they\u2019d expected.The assassination attempt, which they\u2019d initially thought would be an easy job that they could finish as soon as Xu Xiaoshou opened the door, had become something of an enigma instead. Even after entering this place, they felt that a lot was at play here.That figure on the fake mountain never turned around. He simply hung his head low and sighed eerily. A croaky voice was then heard.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally found me, huh? That\u2019s rather unexpected\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being slow.\u201dThe pupils of the two assassins contracted. They wondered what he meant.\u201cWhat the h*ll\u2026: they thought.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Is He Xu Xiaoshou or Not!?\u201cHe\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d Shao Yi said telepathically. His tone was utterly serious.\u201cHe\u2019s not Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d Feng Kong glared at that figure on top of that fake mountain. \u201cXu Xiaoshou was at level eight. This one is at level nine.\u201d\u201cHe made a breakthrough!\u201d\u201cHehe, is there such a coincidence?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t dare to turn around! His silhouette matches Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s description almost entirely! His level of powers is definitely not at Innate level! He\u2019s wearing white clothes, and no assassin would be stupid enough to wear white!\u201dShao Yi bombarded his partner with all that information, which he knew that Feng Kong would be able to process within a breath\u2019s time. Feng Kong would able to even speculate more than what he put forth.Yet, he deemed it necessary to word his opinion nonetheless. He needed his partner to give him the greenlight.Even if said greenlight would have plunged Shao Yi into a whole lot of trouble in just an instant, it would nonetheless allow Feng Kong to escape.\u201cCould it be truly as simple as it looks?\u201dFeng hesitated. He had to admit that he was stunned.He was frozen in place, even if that man before him had a 99 percent chance of being Xu Xiaoshou.Yet, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what if that wasn\u2019t his target.All the crater on the ground, a main house that was nowhere to be found, and someone was clearly in the compound yet no one answered the door.He wondered what caused all of that.Shao Yi was totally fine having Feng Kong throwing him into the fire and risk it, yet he wondered if he should or could be so cold-blooded.If that man before them was not Xu Xiaoshou, then he would most probably be some terrifying figure who was even more capable than he was at concealing his powers, possibly even some among those 33 from the Inner Yard who had disappeared for a long time.If he were to keep his hands to himself, catching sight of that silhouette would nonetheless allow him to live.If he were to make a move, it would have given that man a reason to end them both right there and then.He wondered if that was a fair price to pay for someone like Xu Xiaoshou.Shao Yi was getting restless, after not hearing anything from his partner.Feng Kong is hesitating!He was stunned to find that his partner was actually hesitating.It was worth noting that hesitation on the job was something terrifying to a professional killer.Booom!Flashes of lightning were seen in the sky and the rain became even heavier.The compound was all silent, with only rustling noises were heard.The man on that fake mountain remained silent, and the two who were puzzled as to what they got themselves into were silent as well. Both parties probably had a lot of questions going on in their minds, yet both parties knew one thing very well.The first one to speak first, loses.\u2026Doubted, Passive Points +1.Doubted, Passive Points +1.Doubted, Passive Points +1.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Information Bar had lines rolling over and over. Hundreds of messages were actually seen in less than a minute.Who is that mysterious guy standing on top of that fake mountain\u2026Do you even need to ask?That\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou, of course!His reason for being dressed in white? He couldn\u2019t get changed in time!Why wouldn\u2019t he turn around? That\u2019s because he\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou!Yet, why did he dare to stand before both of us?Well, that\u2019s because he couldn\u2019t do anything else!Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s legs were actually wobbling at the moment. If the two of them were to attack right away, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to evade in time.Yet, from what he could tell from his earlier observations, those two were\u2026Very patient, meticulous, and wouldn\u2019t act before making sure of things.All of that being signs that they were trained killers.At the same time, both of them were definitely capable of complex thoughts. At the very least, he could tell that the one at the rear was around, forcing both of them to speculate even more.They definitely would speculate more. That\u2019s just how it\u2019d be!It was rather ironic that his compound was in such a state because he was being impudent with testing his attacks before, yet that state of things around was the thing that saved him at the moment.He wondered if he could have them think what he wanted them to think, having them think what he let them think about what they were thinking or not thinking, and then think more on what to think, so as cause them to think even more and then confuse their thinking\u2026Xu Xiaoshou was feeling rather dizzy.He knew very well that he had to think, for that was his only way out of this predicament at the moment.One way or another, the two of them were very smart and very, very highly trained fighters. Fighting such people head on would be akin to throwing eggs at a stone wall. As such, he had to resort to smarts.The question whether he could remain alive would be dependent on how much of his brains that he could use.His strategy was to intimidate them so as to be able to firmly be on the offense, to have them think that he was someone else, based on bits of information that he fed them one way or another.He was doing so as to have them ask themselves.Who is he actually? If he\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou, why would he dare to stand before both of us? What causes the compound to look like this?If he isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou, then he would be someone here to kill Xu Xiaoshou, which explains what happens in the compound. But we ran into him somehow and his powers are far above us, yet why isn\u2019t he killing us to silence us right away?Xu Xiaoshou was feeling himself shaking inside out.He had to keep his identity constantly shifting between the two at all times, so to prevent them from getting an affirmative answer. That was the only way to keep them speculating, and then keep being confused.He wondered if he could really speculate what both of them were thinking without error.That would be impossible.As such, he kept quiet as well, so as to prevent giving his true identity off.He saw that at times, giving possibilities to rule out when dealing with clever people, would bring about unexpected results instead.As such, he simply said some enigmatic sounding things, and that was enough to cause the information in his mind to refresh like crazy. He knew that he partially succeeded in what he was trying to do.Even if his chances of being able to intimidate them into inaction were 99 percent, if they were to try to attack him instead, he would definitely be doomed.As such, he had to think about what to do next.Truth to be told though\u2026He didn\u2019t know what else to do.While he was having his back against them, his Sense allowed him to clearly perceive their facial expression, which served as his greatest weapon at the moment.The silence between both parties continued. All three of them had their own agenda. Both parties were waiting for the other to speak first.The \u2018doubted\u2019 lines in his mind dwindled considerably and he was getting very anxious.Those two assassins were clearly more patient than he imagined, so much so that he was unable to find any way to misdirect them further.This can\u2019t go on any longer. I have to say something. If I wait any longer, it\u2019d be them going on their second round to verify who I am instead.But\u2026 what should I say?He knew that what he was about to say next would determine if he would live or die, and he hesitated.\u201cHeh, so you two are here to kill Xu Xiaoshou as well?\u201d He lowered his voice.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you came late.\u201d The line was enigmatic.What the hell was that?I\u2019m practically telling them that I\u2019ve just killed the guy myself! Gosh, only idiots would do that.\u2026Feng Kong kept his gaze locked on that man on the fake mountain, not letting any bit of information slip past him.Sweat and rainwater drenched the back of his head. He was shivering from inside out.He was still in his belief that the man before them was Xu Xiaoshou, yet despite their steely performance, he wondered why nonetheless.Why is that guy still able to keep himself up like that!?He gave a very subtle look at his partner, who accepted the message right away.Move!\u201cHah?\u201dA sarcastic snicker that was very flighty, yet it stopped Shao Yi from moving nonetheless. The man on that fake mountain then lowered his head and mumbled, \u201cyou\u2019re running out of patience then\u2026\u201dBoth of them were able to hear what he just said, yet the sarcasm in his tone was unmistakable.He acted like he was playing a game of cat and mouse with them, that their fates were sealed and that he simply enjoyed watching his prey struggle.Feng Kong\u2019s pupils contracted and he was shivering all over.He is able to see!That guy hasn\u2019t even turn around yet. Just how is he able to tell that extremely subtle communication between me and Shao Yi?\u201cAre we going to get him or what?\u201d Shao Yi was going crazy.He could an oaf and still be able to tell that both of them were playing psychological games, yet it was a game that he couldn\u2019t be a part of, so he could only wait for Feng Kong\u2019s signal.At present.That signal was lost again.Oh, for the sake of the heavens!Shao Yi was at the edge of going nutsPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Keep GuessingFeng Kong hadn\u2019t yet given Shao Yi an answer when the man on the fake mountain just snickered, his tone utterly cold.\u201cYou wanna run?\u201cYou\u2019ve had your chance\u2026\u201dThe air around them seemed to heat up as these words fell, so much so that even the rainwater started to fizzle and immediately evaporate.Shao Yi was shocked, but it wasn\u2019t what was happening in their surroundings after the man\u2019s words that shocked him. What shocked him was what the man said.\u201cRun?\u201d he thought.\u201cWho the h*ll is trying to run here?\u201cI\u2019m not even thinking of running!\u201cWait, no\u2026\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201dHe then looked at Feng Kong in fright, unable to believe his eyes that his partner, who was usually so confident, was so frightened that he wanted to run.Feng Kong turned to meet his gaze, and Shao Yi was shocked to find that there was a different look in his eyes.\u201cWait, he\u2019s getting scared?\u201dA killer running out of confidence right before the fight. What kind of a fight could there be anymore?Shao Yi, who\u2019d been composed this whole time, was now utterly terrified.\u2026\u201cShao Yi\u2019s getting scared? He\u2019s thinking of running?\u201d This was Feng Kong\u2019s inner thoughts.He turned to look at his partner, and found that the terror in his eyes had grown. He knew right then and there that the situation had gotten completely out of control.\u201cShao Yi is being led on!\u201d he thought.\u201cHe might\u2019ve gotten intimidated, or it could be because of me\u2026\u201cIf it\u2019s the latter, boy, that guy over there really is something.\u201d Feng Kong was feeling unsettled.One way or another, no fight could be had at the moment anymore.The man on the fake mountain was simply too sure of himself and had just the right handle on how to play mind games. The time he\u2019d given the two of them was only enough to unsettle them for a brief moment. It wasn\u2019t enough to give them more time to think.It\u2019d even gotten to the point where he and his partner were now mentally desynchronized.Just when he was figuring out what to do, he caught the man on the fake mountain flap his sleeve, then shroud his hand with fire elemental spiritual source.\u201cSpiritual source?\u201dFeng Kong felt like his soul had practically left his body and like he\u2019d been cast in some icy hell.\u201cSpiritual source!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d Shao Yi\u2019s telepathic message was one of utter, unconcealed terror.Xu Xiaoshou might have been able to immediately make a breakthrough into Spiritual Cultivation Level Nine right after the matches were over, yet regardless of how much of a genius he might be, there was utterly no way that he could then make yet another breakthrough into level 10 right after that and even break into Innate Stage.That man before them, whom they guessed to be at level nine of powers, was actually able to conjure fire elemental spiritual source. That meant that he was definitely someone at Innate Stage who had concealed his powers.He fooled both of us!He definitely isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou!\u201cRun,\u201d Feng Kong lowered his tone and said.Shao Yi immediately retreated and caught up with his partner.\u201cDo you really think you can run away?\u201d the man on the fake mountain chuckled. Both of them felt that everything around them was shaking before they could even get out of the compound, so much so that even rainwater from the sky seemed to be suspended midair, making the scene utterly harrowing.Crack, crack, crack!A vortex was seen on the water collected on the ground. Bubbles popped one after another. The water was actually boiling.Xu Xiaoshou wanted nothing more than to have them run as far as they could. It\u2019d be best if they could run all the way to the ends of the world and never return, yet he had to do something to make sure that they stayed around.If he were to simply stop attacking right after the two of them ran, it would blow his cover.Furthermore, he somehow felt that the cunning one among the two was setting him up by running.He couldn\u2019t afford to give the other party a chance to do something.As such, he had to make a move, yet it couldn\u2019t be something that would make them unable to run away.That was because everything he\u2019d done before was actually just pointless bluffs.He pulled Infernal Heavens on them by heightening the temperature around them, adding to the pressure, to make them mistake him for someone powerful enough to affect the weather whenever he got angry.He then pulled All Things are Swords on them, causing everything around to shake, so as to create a harrowing scene that said \u201cI\u2019m about to hit you\u201d without exposing his sword will.\u201cSo\u2026\u201cWas all that enough to scare them off?\u201dXu Xiaoshou extended the range of his Sense to the limit. His heart was beating so fast that it felt like it was about to leap out of his chest, but it eventually calmed down instead.He saw that the cunning one that wasn\u2019t wearing the hood had halted the other one\u2019s movements right after the both of them had gotten to the door, stopping in place.\u201cMy cover\u2019s blown?\u201d he thought.\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201dHe immediately stiffened.Doubted, Passive Points +1.Doubted, Passive Points +1.\u201c\u2026\u201dLines rolled over and over on his Information Bar again. Something was definitely amiss.He wracked his brains and processed the hundreds of possibilities abound, and was still unable to find the problem.At that moment, he felt his skin crawl.\u2026\u201cHe set me up!\u201cHe was bluffing!\u201d Feng Kong thought.Feng Kong didn\u2019t care for the puzzled look in Shao Yi\u2019s eyes. His mind came back to work yet again.The man on that fake mountain looked terrifying and had managed to make the scene as terrifying as he could. Yet, the most puzzling thing was that he was still trying to scare them, even when they were about to run.But then again, there was one thing that was the most puzzling of all.He still wouldn\u2019t turn around.Feng Kong smirked. \u201cHah! Got you now!\u201dHis act of taking Shao Yi and running was in itself a ruse. The fact that the other man wasn\u2019t doing anything to attack him, who had already slowed down, was a sign that something was amiss.All the doubt he\u2019d had before was immediately dispelled. He could now say with certainty that this man was Xu Xiaoshou.Feng Kong then told his partner telepathically, \u201cShao Yi, keep up with my rhythm, we first\u2026\u201d\u201cHave both of you forgotten that this is my turf?\u201d An eerie voice was heard, cutting off Feng Kong.Vooom!The array in the compound was activated. The barrier shrouded the entire place, and the door snapped shut.Feng Kong got tongue-tied right there and then. He looked at the barrier, which was well within reach, and felt his mind twist into knots.\u201cIsn\u2019t he Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d he thought.According to his judgment, that man was indeed Xu Xiaoshou.Yet, he wondered why that man would dare to trap both of them inside if he were indeed Xu Xiaoshou.Shutting the door after invaders had gotten inside was one surefire way of getting oneself killed.Feng Kong was dumbfounded, and tried his best to think.\u201cCan it be\u2026\u201d\u201cThat he isn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou?\u201cOr that\u2026\u201cHe\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou, but he managed to guess what I guess what he guessed what I guessed?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201cWho the h*ll would go about guessing like that in such a stressful environment?\u201dFeng Kong was completely thrown into disarray. The activation of that array had truly messed up his thoughts.\u201cThere are still ways around this, so long as we umm\u2026 stay focused!\u201d Feng Kong\u2019s eyes were filled with nothing but visible tension.Shao Yi was totally oblivious just how many thoughts were zipping through his partner\u2019s mind in that instant and simply got excited after hearing his partner tell him to keep up.Kong finally regained his composure. \u201cThis is great!\u201d he thought.He immediately asked telepathically, \u201cKong, what do you mean rhythm? You\u2026\u201d\u201cShut the f**k up!\u201d Feng Kong shouted in a rage.Shao Yi was completely dumbfounded, wondering what had just happened.Feng Kong turned his head, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. He had almost been able to streamline his thoughts again, making sense of what that man on the fake mountain was trying to do.Yet, that one line from Shao Yi had trashed everything so badly, that there was simply no recovering his thoughts again.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re done for.\u201dAll that was seen in Feng Kong\u2019s eyes were panic. He had lost it.He\u2019d lost all sense of judgment.Before Feng Kong could process what was going on, the voice behind him came so near that he felt like it was right beside his ear.\u201cTurn around. Look at me.\u201dFeng Kong\u2019s heart almost immediately stopped beating, and he wondered if he knew what he was thinking.That was the only thing that Feng Kong felt sure of\u2014that the man on that fake mountain wouldn\u2019t dare to turn around. That was the only thing that he relied on.Yet, the other man had seen right through him just when he was in a mess.He wondered if that man had actually been able to pinpoint his thoughts all along.Feng Kong wanted to turn around, yet his neck seemed to have stiffened, as he was unable to move at all.After all\u2026To a killer\u2026Being seen meant death.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: HelpShao Yi didn\u2019t think that much. The less one thought, the better one\u2019s life was his motto. He turned around to look at the fake mountain.\u201cHuh?\u201d he thought.\u201cNo one\u2019s around?\u201dHe caught a silhouette in his periphery not far away, causing him to immediately turn around.He saw a man in white clothes with his hair messily draped over his shoulder. His arms were behind his back.This was the man who was standing on that fake mountain.He came to stand right in front of Shao Yi.Shao Yi\u2019s pupils contracted. The man had his head hung low, obscuring his face, yet the clothing he was wearing was noticeably tattered.That man\u2019s clothes seemed to have been torn by a sword, and the exposed skin was all bruised and battered.There were also vague bloodstains on said clothes that had almost all been washed away by the rain.Shao Yi wasn\u2019t stupid. While he was unable to keep up with the terrifying thought processes exhibited by those other two, he still had basic judgment.Judging from the extent of the man\u2019s injuries, gashes from sword attacks, and bruises\u2026Coupled with the fact that Xu Xiaoshou had Innate sword will and Innate Level physique\u2026Shao Yi could tell that the man wasn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou.Yet, the man had fought Xu Xiaoshou.So the real Xu Xiaoshou\u2026Was dead!\u201cWhat th\u2026\u201dThe rain was heavy, and he dared not even turn his head around, so Shao Yi just simply stared at that man in white in the rain, feeling the scene to be rather eerie for some reason.Brrooooom!A rumble of thunder was heard, and the man in white lifted his head all of a sudden.\u201cHoly sh**!\u201dShao Yi was so frightened that he kept backing away from the man until his back hit the wall. \u201cXu Xiaoshou!?\u201d he uttered in fright.\u201cWhat kind of insanity is this?\u201d he thought.He\u2019d just speculated that the man before his eyes wasn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou, yet when the man had looked up, he\u2019d shown a face with features completely identical to Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s.\u201cNow I see why Kong was so scared. Thinking is a frightening thing indeed.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d he shouted.Feng Kong couldn\u2019t help but turn around when he heard Shao Yi\u2019s shout.Lightning flashed across the night sky, and glimmers of silver light were seen on the man in white\u2019s face.Both of them looked at the messy-looking man at the same time and grinned, yet their grins were anything but sincere, as that face before them felt like it belonged to someone else, and everything felt wrong.They felt their skin crawl.This was so d*mn terrifying.Feng Kong was so confused that he lost all his powers of judgment. Even Shao Yi, who had just learned to think, felt like his brain was frying.Was this guy Xu Xiaoshou or not? That was the question that came to each of their minds at almost exactly the same time.\u201cI\u2019m Xu Xiaoshou.\u201dThe man in white seemed to have read their thoughts and grinned again.Oh, they weren\u2019t going to buy that!That crawling feeling became more intense. The two of them looked at each other, and the fear in each other\u2019s eyes was a clear as day.Even if this man was indeed Xu Xiaoshou, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to attack him.The scene was utterly harrowing.\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201dThey each said at almost exactly the same time. Shao Yi held his short sword in reverse grip and cut open the barrier. A rumble was heard as a fissure was torn right there and then.\u201cJust stay behind and rest if you\u2019re tired of playing. What\u2019s the use running anyway?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said coldly.The lines on his Information Bar were no longer refreshing, but that didn\u2019t mean the two had confirmed his identity. On the contrary, he\u2019d finally been able to confuse the two of them.He was Xu Xiaoshou, yet he was not.The fear of the unknown was what struck fear in the minds of those two. As for whether he was actually Xu Xiaoshou or not, that was beside the point.Yeah\u2026To them at least.Although he would\u2019ve very much liked to just let them go, he had to keep playing along.This might just be another one of the guy\u2019s scheming tricks, no?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t afford to take chances.Seeing the two of them getting ready to leave from that fissure in the barrier, he drew the finger blade behind his back and almost turned that eerie smile of his into the real thing, just for the sake of playing along.Blood splattered with the snap of a finger.\u201cInfernal Heavens.\u201dHe did nothing but tilt his head, and invisible fire suddenly burst from Shao Yi\u2019s body. The sound of something burning was heard.In Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes, this spiritual technique of unknown level was his only weapon at the moment. All the others were just too telling, or were used at too far a distance to cause significant damage.Drawing Hiding Pain was definitely out of the question, as there was no way those two wouldn\u2019t recognize the sword.Yes, the only technique he could use now was Infernal Heavens. Terrifying might, yet unknown to anyone.As expected, dread was written all over Shao Yi\u2019s face when that invisible flame began to burn. Shao Yi summoned spiritual source to defend himself, yet the flames burned his spiritual source all the same.He panicked. \u201cWhat the h*ll is this!?\u201dBy then, he\u2019d already come to see the man by the name of Xu Xiaoshou as a living manifestation of terror and malice. He suffered a psychological breakdown as soon as the \u201cghostly flames\u201d began to burn.\u201cShao Yi!\u201dThe fissure in the barrier wasn\u2019t that large, but Feng Kong had already gotten through. After seeing that Shao Yi was still on the other side, he shouted, \u201cRun, I\u2019ll cover you!\u201dShao Yi tried his best to resist the eerie flames on him. To the naked eye, nothing appeared to be wrong with him at the moment, as Infernal Heavenly Flames were completely invisible.\u201cYou know what I mean!\u201d Shao Yi said something puzzling. Xu Xiaoshou then saw the man outside immediately bolt.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he thought.\u201cSome kind of code?\u201dFeng Kong, who was running as fast as he could at the moment, was the only one who knew that Shao Yi was proficient in seven escape techniques, while he, on the other hand, only knew Blood Escape. As such, Shao Yi was the one who covered him whenever things went south during missions.Yet, Shao Yi would quickly catch up before long every time, running before Feng Kong with his wine container, drinking as he shouted at Feng Kong with his weird voice, telling Feng Kong to run faster.Pfft!Feng Kong couldn\u2019t help but snicker at the thought.He was very confident of Shao Yi\u2019s proficiency in escape techniques. The way he saw it, no one could keep up with someone proficient in seven escape techniques.He\u2019d never expected this mission tonight to turn so weird, and he wondered if someone else had been assigned by Brother He to kill Xu Xiaoshou.He could\u2019ve told the both of them!\u201cIt\u2019s okay that he doesn\u2019t trust a lunatic like Shao Yi, but he doesn\u2019t trust me as well?\u201d he thought.\u201cH*ll!\u201d\u2026\u201cSawwy, Kong.\u201d\u201cMaybwe I won be going back dis time\u2026\u201dShao Yi was feeling bitter. He was at the peak of Innate stage, and yet he was utterly incapable of resisting the \u201cghostly flames.\u201dWas this some kind of demonic art?He\u2019d never seen such eerie spiritual technique at work before.The flames seemed like they could burn down just about anything, and it took them mere moments to chew through over half of his spiritual source. He figured that he would be doomed by the time his spiritual source finally ran out.Shao Yi looked at the man in white in the rain and tightened his grip around the short sword in his hand.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he attacking?\u201d he thought.\u201cDoes he wanna see me burn to death?\u201cSome twisted way to enjoy himself\u2026\u201cMaybe, in the eyes of such formidable ones, this bit of power of mine makes me little more than an ant, eh?\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll just keep buying time then.\u201cKong, don\u2019t ever, ever come back\u2026\u201dDoubted, Passive Points +1.Belittled, Passive Points +1.Ridiculed, Passive Points +1.Cursed, Passive Points +1.\u2026Xu Xiaoshou had no idea what the other guy was thinking. He simply kept up his unfazed fa\u00e7ade, trying to make the scene as harrowing as possible.He tried his best to vaporize the rainwater falling from the sky, stirring up vortexes on the ground and shaking the fauna all around them.That was all.He couldn\u2019t afford to attack.Once he did so, the truth of him still being at level nine would be completely exposed.He deemed that he would then be pummeled by that man before him.He knew that despite the man looking stupid, that man was still at the peak of Innate Stage.Xu Xiaoshou was actually panicking deep down.\u201cWhat should I do? What should I do?\u201d he thought.\u201cCan someone at Spiritual Cultivation Level nine beat someone at the peak of Innate Stage?\u201cSomeone help me!\u201cHelp\u2026\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: ExposureCrack, crack, crack\u2026The invisible Infernal Heavenly Flames kept burning, and Shao Yi was visibly struggling.Despite being protected by spiritual source, after being exposed to such scorching power of such a peculiar nature for such a long time, his body had been burned red hot all the same.A faint steam could be seen rising, and there was the smell of burned flesh in the air.\u201cJudging by the time, Kong should be a long way away by now\u2026\u201dShao Yi struggled to keep himself together as he resisted the pain. He had little spiritual source left at the moment, and if he were to stay around any longer, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to run.\u201cThinking that you\u2019ve bought enough time and that it\u2019s time to run, eh?\u201dThat cold voice was heard once again, sending shivers down Shao Yi\u2019s spine.\u201cIs this guy really human?\u201d he thought. \u201cHow is it possible that he always knows what I\u2019m thinking?\u201dXu Xiaoshou kept up his nonchalant fa\u00e7ade. He turned his gaze to the seemingly endless rain, yet his Sense allowed him to observe every muscle in Shao Yi\u2019s body.His observation had gotten so keen that he could know if Shao Yi was about to take a p*ss or a dump from the clenching of his butt muscles.Shao Yi\u2019s spiritual source had almost run out, yet being able to stay behind to cover his partner meant that he must have something up his sleeve.Xu Xiaoshou figured that the man either had some surreal, high-level technique for escaping or had truly thought of staying behind to fight to his death.If it was the former, that would be entirely okay. But if his intention was the latter, Xu Xiaoshou would be in deep trouble.As such, Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to keep encouraging thoughts of running away in the other man through his words.Yet, at the same time, he was also afraid that after escaping the man might find something amiss and then come back with the other one.He\u2019d really be done for if that happened.As such, Xu Xiaoshou made up his mind. Though he would have liked very much for that man to just leave, he knew that the man had to stay behind.The man had to stay behind as a dead body.As for how to go about reducing him to a dead body\u2026Xu Xiaoshou saw that to be quite a problem\u2026\u2026Shao Yi was utterly terrified, yet he was unable to delay any longer. The longer he stayed, the worse his condition would become; he had to leave right away.However, the man spoke again just when he was about to escape.\u201cDo you really that you\u2019re the one buying time here?\u201cI\u2019m buying time as well\u2026\u201dShao Yi\u2019s body stiffened. He wondered what that man was getting at.He wondered if the man had sustained some kind of injury when fighting Xu Xiaoshou before and was recuperating at the moment.Seeing that Shao Yi wasn\u2019t saying anything, Xu Xiaoshou kept talking just to buy more time. \u201cDo you really think your friend can escape?He spouted whatever came to mind. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s going to stay behind tonight. That guy won\u2019t be out there for long.\u201dShao Yi was terrified, and he checked his soul and aura all over, yet was unable to find a mark on him.\u201cImpossubu!\u201d\u201cYou dun even know us. How cud you leave a mark on us?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. First, because of the man\u2019s peculiar accent. And second, because of the mark he was talking about.\u201cWhat mark?\u201d he thought.\u201cThis guy really has one h*ll of an imagination!\u201cWhatever. Better some response than nothing at all. So long as I keep at it, I\u2019ll have no problems delaying the guy.\u201cThe longer he burns, the less spiritual source he\u2019ll have left in him, and I bet he doesn\u2019t have any spiritual techniques like \u2018High Spirits.\u2019\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou continued calmly. \u201cYou think you\u2019re combusting all on your own all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cWhat does he mean?\u201d he thought.\u201cCombusting on my own?\u201dShao Yi\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he suddenly recalled that the man in white had never even touched him, yet he\u2019d immediately ignited with those \u201cghostly flames.\u201dThis guy\u2026Was utterly terrifying!\u201cNo, I can\u2019t stay here any longer,\u201d Shao Yi thought to himself. \u201cIf I stay around, who knows what else will hit me. If I can\u2019t run\u2026\u201cThen instead of just sitting around, I should do something!\u201dXu Xiaoshou, at that moment, was totally oblivious that his attempt at delaying that man had had the opposite effect, and kept droning on. \u201cLet\u2019s play a game\u2026\u201dSwoop!A beam of black light was shot at him, immediately cutting him off mid-sentence.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Sense never stopped. When Shao Yi shot the short sword in his sleeve like a bolt of lightning at him, he simply flicked his finger condescendingly, acting like some really, really powerful warrior.Clang!The work of Recoil coupled with Sharpness deflected the blade, which was tens of meters away, right then and there, and it flew into the wall, getting lodged there.He was completely baffled the next second. Two of his fingers seemed to have gotten plastered together midair, and he couldn\u2019t pull them back.\u201cSh**!\u201d he thought.\u201cD*mn. What have I done? Why did I flick the blade away with my fingers?\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have just doged it instead?\u201cHelp!\u201dShao Yi was also dumbfounded. He\u2019d initially thought of throwing the short sword, finding an opening, and running.Yet, after seeing what happened, both of his legs felt like molten lead had been poured into them, preventing him from moving.His eyes were filled with disbelief, and even his voice became shaky as he said, \u201cI-Innate Level physique?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2019s incorrect.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThat was actually \u201910 Sections of the Finger Sword.\u2019\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201dShao Yi was feeling as if the world were falling down around him, and he was no longer able to think at all.\u201cThis guy is Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d he thought.Yet, how could he be Xu Xiaoshou??But that Innate Level physique\u2026None of the 33 in the Inner Yard had something like that!This was definitely Xu Xiaoshou!Shao Yi felt like his eyes were about to pop out of his sockets and like his brain were about to explode, as he found the revelation utterly unacceptable.If this man were indeed Xu Xiaoshou, then his level of powers were simply that of someone who had just made a breakthrough into Spiritual Cultivation Level Nine, which would make him little more than an insect in Shao Yi\u2019s eyes.\u201cBoth of us actually got played like that for so d*mn long?\u201d he thought.\u201cAnd he actually scared Kong so much that he bolted?\u201dDoubted, Passive Points +1.Doubted, Passive Points +1.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe lines kept popping up on the Information Bar in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep that under wraps for long.He was exasperated that all the effort he\u2019d put into pretending to be bigger than he actually was had all been for naught because of that one flick of the finger. No one would think that he was really just doing such a thing out of habit.One\u2019s habits could really bring about one\u2019s doom.\u201cSorry for lying. I\u2019m Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cYou\u2019re a good person\u2026\u201dShao Yi was fuming. He was so enraged that he was about to suffer internal hemorrhaging.He siphoned his spiritual source and was about to attack, when he found that he had little to spare by then.\u201cYou have no spiritual source left, which means that you won\u2019t be able to beat me.\u201dXu Xiaoshou knew that man\u2019s condition like the back of his own hand and advised, \u201cLeave now and I\u2019ll pretend that you were never here, and I\u2019ll just go back to sleep?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be sleeping in a coffin, because I\u2019m going to make sure you\u2019re dead!\u201d Shao Yi rushed at him with a short sword in his hand.It was frustrating enough being duped and seeing one\u2019s beliefs crumble before one\u2019s eyes, and worse still, Xu Xiaoshou had taunted him like he was all high and mighty, and that was something Shao Yi wasn\u2019t going to take lying down.Berated, Passive Points +1.Nice!Xu Xiaoshou leapt and quickly retreated.He\u2019d been afraid that the man before him would actually cool down and run away just to call his friend.He totally didn\u2019t expect the man to lose his cool so much that he\u2019d choose to fight instead.\u201cEven though a Spiritual Cultivator at the peak of Origin Court level is very powerful, do you seriously think you can fight when you\u2019ve no spiritual source left?\u201cYou really think that that frail body of yours will be of any use?\u201dDespite his thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou was still running as fast as he could.Although it was fun jeering at his enemy, if that man had somehow retained even a bit of spiritual source, it would be enough to take him out.\u201cI can\u2019t afford to give him any chances,\u201d he thought.\u201cI need to make sure that all of his spiritual source is burned away before I can make a move.\u201dPursued, Passive Points +1.\u201cHuh?\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat the h*ll?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Wearing Him Down to Nothing Right Then and ThereThe longer Shao Yi chased after Xu Xiaoshou, the angrier he got. He had come to firmly believe that this man was Xu Xiaoshou.He wondered just how cautious Xu Xiaoshou was for not daring to fight him, even when he was already in such a miserable state.He regretted everything.He thought that he should have just blasted that pretentious idiot down as soon as he\u2019d gotten the chance back then instead of wasting time trying to figure him out.If he had attacked just once, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s cover would have been completely blown.But then again, he was also curious as to just how Xu Xiaoshou had managed to mess that compound up in such a short period of time.There was simply no way anyone would have been able to do that, conventionally speaking.Furthermore, being able to make such a huge mess could also mean that Xu Xiaoshou knew that they were coming before they came, and Shao Yi wondered how that was possible.That kid was only at Spiritual Cultivation level eight or nine, man!Shao Yi shuddered to find that Xu Xiaoshou was already at level nine.That meant that he had also coincidentally made a breakthrough in his training.He became increasingly confused about everything, and wondered just how Xu Xiaoshou had managed to do all of that in such a short period of time.The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.Shao Yi glared at the man before him, who was evidently very good at running, before eventually running out of patience and shouting, \u201cIf you\u2019re a man, stay where you are!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was amused. \u201cYou\u2019re here to kill me and you\u2019re telling me to stop running?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Roll over, put my neck to your sword, and really make it easy for you to kill me?\u201d\u201cCatch me if you can!\u201d he shouted.\u201c\u2026\u201dShao Yi took a deep breath and stopped. He was already at his limit.If it wasn\u2019t for those \u201cghostly flames\u201d burning him, he could have had the kid kneel before him. The flames were just too troublesome. If he were to keep chasing, it would only be a matter of time before his spiritual source was depleted, which meant that he could really just die on the spot.He realized that he had to run.\u201cYou wanna run? H*ll no!\u201dBefore he could manage to turn around and bolt, Xu Xiaoshou, who was running in front of him, turned around and pounced at him with clenched fists.Shao Yi was going crazy. \u201cWhat is wrong with this kid?\u201d\u201cDoes he, like, have eyes on the back of his head?\u201d he thought. \u201cEyes that can read minds, even?\u201dHe wondered just how Xu Xiaoshou was able to read his every move with utter precision.\u201cLet\u2019s go, then!\u201dSeeing Xu Xiaoshou charging at him, Shao Yi immediately summoned his short sword from the wall and waited for the chance to strike.\u201cHuh? You\u2019re not running away now?\u201dXu Xiaoshou stopped, then ran again.Shao Yi: \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d\u201cGodd*mn you!\u201cOh, this kid really knows how to play tricks.\u201dAt that moment, it didn\u2019t just feel like the world was crashing down around him. It felt like death was imminent. He was about to be torn to pieces!At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou stopped and slowly turned around, smirking like a demon as he walked up to Shao Yi.\u201cI\u2019m guessing\u2026 that you\u2019ve run out of spiritual source?\u201dShao Yi\u2019s heart sank. He checked his energy reserve and found that his spiritual source was indeed about to be depleted.\u201cThat as**ole\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cHe\u2019s buying time!\u201dA that moment Shao Yi full realized that despite looking like a lunatic, Xu Xiaoshou was actually wearing him down with the \u201cghost flames,\u201d and he knew that he would definitely be worn down to nothing if the situation continued.\u201cCalm down!\u201d he thought.\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be infuriated.\u201dHe realized that he\u2019d made a fatal mistake that no professional killer should\u2019ve made. He immediately calmed himself down and sneered, \u201cDo you really think you can take me down with your ghost flames?\u201d\u201cWhat else, then?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou slowly walked up to him.Shao Yi chuckled. Had this kid gone crazy? He really didn\u2019t think he could just replenish his spiritual source?He flipped his hand, and a pill appeared on his palm. He looked like he was about to throw into his mouth.Yet, Xu Xiaoshou, who was still walking up to Shao Yi, must\u2019ve predicted this from the start, because he sucked hard, and the pill disappeared, disintegrating into a fine mist that hovered over him.He only took one-tenth of the pill\u2019s power, and let the rest scatter into the air.Shao Yi was completely baffled.Just what kind of demonic art was this?He then took out yet another pill, not believing that Xu Xiaoshou could pull the same trick again, yet despite trying as hard as he could to hold onto the pill, it still took Xu Xiaoshou only one sucking breath to draw all that spiritual energy away.Shao Yi fell to his knees, suddenly feeling as if the world before him had gone dark.Despite being at the peak of Origin Court level, this was his first time feeling like death was imminent, even though he was only fighting an insect who was at Spiritual Cultivation level nine.\u201cThank you for your pills. Anything else?\u201dXu Xiaoshou only shuddered slightly and showed no other signs of wavering.He was controlling the might of Breathing Technique, enabling him to suck in only the right amount of spiritual energy needed.Those weren\u2019t his own pills, and he deemed that it was enough to take just a whiff. The rush of taking in more would cause him to go out of control, and he wasn\u2019t about to give that man who was out to kill him any chances.Crackle, crackle.Shao Yi was evidently unable to resist the terrifying might of the Infernal Heavenly Flames now that his spiritual source was near empty. His face immediately twisted.He knew that he had nowhere to run. His physical body wasn\u2019t all that strong, and his spiritual source was almost gone, making escape impossible.\u201cI just wanna know right now if you really are at Spiritual Cultivation Level nine,\u201d Shao Yi asked disparingly.There was no way he\u2019d believe that Xu Xiaoshou had only that bit of powers. He deemed that the kid had duped everyone from the Outer Yard.Xu Xiaoshou seemd to relax his guard. \u201cOh, conventional powers are not my forte,\u201d he said.Shao Yi hung his head low in silence, gritting his teeth as he resisted the flames, which had almost charred his entire body.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou asked.Shao Yi looked up at him.\u201cWhat level are you at?\u201dShao Yi had been prepared to stay mum or take everything he knew to the grave. He totally didn\u2019t expect Xu Xiaoshou to ask this instead, and he wondered what his level had to do with the assassination attempt.\u201cOrigin Court level. Peak.\u201d Shao Yi didn\u2019t conceal the fact.\u201cPeak at Origin Court level?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou repeated the line and stayed silent for a bit before uttering, \u201cSo weak\u2026\u201dShao Yi was completely baffled.Blood was seeping out of the corners of his eyes and spurting from his mouth. He clenched his fists tight all of a sudden, yet then quickly released them.Oh ho?He was already done for, then?Xu Xiaoshou had long been aware of this from Sense, yet he just kept yapping away. \u201cSo, your friend. He\u2019s at Voidness level?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYour name?\u201d\u201cFeng Jia.\u201d\u201cYour friend\u2019s?\u201d\u201cShao Kong.\u201d\u201cHehe, like I\u2019d buy that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy the f**k did you bother asking then!?\u201d he thought.Shao Yi was so p*ssed he was speechless. His entire body started spasming. The Infernal Heavenly Flames had shrouded his entire body by this point, and he looked like he would be reduced to dust the next second.\u201cAny last words? Spill.\u201dXu Xiaoshou never let his guard down. Despite looking high and mighty, as if death didn\u2019t concern him, he was extremely tense at that moment.\u201cHe\u2019s nearing his end, eh?\u201d he thought.\u201cSelf-destruct?\u201cOr is he gonna teleport out of here?\u201dXu Xiaoshou had no idea what would happen next, yet he\u2019d already inwardly listed out all the possible tricks the man might have up his sleeve, determined not to give that man any chance at escape.Bloody mist burst from Shao Yi as Xu Xiaoshou continued to ponder. All of Shao Yi\u2019s soul and power was amplified in an instant and charged at him with a thrust of his sword.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d Xi Xiaoshou thought.Caught off-guard, he fell back, yet when the two were about to touch each other, a black beam shot out from his chest, punching through the bloody figure.Pfftt!Despite having put his hand up to block it in the nick of time, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s chest was nonetheless pierced by Shao Yi\u2019s short sword.A mysterious force deflected both parties away, and the next sword attack from Shao Yi missed, punching only through the air.Which was where Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart should\u2019ve been.\u201cHow can this be?\u201d Shao Yi\u2019s expression was that of shock.\u201cReverse Sword Style\u201dBefore Shao Yi could get himself together after being sent flying, the sound of a sword slicing through the air was heard, and Hiding Pain shot out and cleanly sliced his head off.Blood sprayed everywhere.The kill was as clean as could be.\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: One MoreA headless body dropped to the ground, splashing water everywhere. There was still a puzzled expression on the now-severed head of Shao Yi.He was thinking, \u201cDidn\u2019t the kid already let his guard down? How was he able to react in time?\u201dHe was thinking, \u201cWhy would a sword shoot out of a person\u2019s chest?\u201dHe was thinking, \u201cThe kid was completely unable to resist even that one attack of mine, so why was I sent flying?\u201dThump.Water splashed as the head bobbed in the puddle.Xu Xiaoshou clenched the muscles in his chest as he rose from the ground. He pulled the sword out of his chest and took a look at the hole there, which almost went straight through him to his back.\u201cSh**, this hurts\u2026\u201dInnate Level Physique, Sharpness, spiritual source shielding. All three of these added together, and still that man had been able to punch a hole right through him.\u201cThe peak of Origin Court level really is insanely powerful!\u201d he noted to himself.The injuries all over his body were almost completely done healing.He waved his head and burned the dead body away, leaving only that head with a puzzled look on its face behind.\u201cPuzzled, huh?\u201cYou should be.\u201cIf you\u2019d been able to figure everything out, I\u2019d be lying on the ground now instead\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was still reeling from shock and fright. If it hadn\u2019t been for Recoil coming into effect at the very last moment, he would have probably suffered yet another stab.If one of his vital organs had been hit, he thought that not even Eternal Vitality would have been able to heal him.He touched his chest. Deep down, he was impressed.\u201cInnate Level Recoil sure is something. The more damaging the opponent\u2019s attack, the further away they\u2019ll be sent flying.\u201dThat meant if anyone out there wasn\u2019t able to kill him with one shot, that first shot would widen the distance between them.And when he apparently had more information than the other, he would definitely be able to buy more time to get prepared, just like with the Reverse Style he\u2019d just pulled.That was simply no way out of such a predicament.Furthermore, with both Eternal Vitality and High Spirits at work, no one would be able to fight a war of attrition against him, so long as his opponent didn\u2019t manage to score a one-hit kill.He rescinded the Infernal Spiritual Source, which was wrecking the place, after High Spirits came to mind. The rain was no longer vaporizing, and was able to fall normally.\u201cThat Fundamental Passive Skill sure is terrifying,\u201d he thought.It had enabled him to maintain the harrowing mood throughout the entire ordeal all on his own, and had even burned that assassin almost to a crisp with the Infernal Heavenly Flames.When he checked on his energy reserve, he found there was only a small bit of spiritual source left.Yet, that bit was regenerating at a rate visible to the naked eye.\u201cWho would be able to withstand something like this, eh\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou mourned his future enemies, as those three major Fundamental Passive Skills of his were utterly insane.Even Breathing Technique had been converted into a method of attack.He wondered just how dejected that man had felt when he\u2019d sucked the pill dry right then and there.He shook his head. His face was drenched by rainwater, which cooled him down somewhat.Peak of Origin Court level\u2026Despite the fact that someone at such a level was very powerful, they were still weaker than what he\u2019d expected.He wondered if that perception had anything to do with the fact that the man he\u2019d fought had only been able to pull one effective attack on him from start to finish.After that battle, he\u2019d become fully aware that the huge gap between himself and those Innate Level veterans wasn\u2019t so big that he couldn\u2019t close it as he was.This made sense. Conventional powers were indeed not his forte. In fact, one could even say that they were his greatest weakness.Yet, conventional wisdom dictated that one\u2019s powers were the basic determining factor that decided how well one could do in combat.This explained the fact why, despite knowing his situation and knowing that he had more up his sleeve, people would nonetheless somehow underestimate him one way or another.He deemed that so long as he could make good use of this, he could bring enemies far stronger than him down all the same.The rain kept falling, and he stood under it in silence, sorting out all the thoughts in his head.Soon, he forcibly suppressed his thoughts and came back to his senses.\u201cThere\u2019s one more\u2026\u201cThe battle may not be over yet.\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked at the ground. The only loot he\u2019d gotten from the battle was two short swords and a head, as he\u2019d burned the rest.Interrogating the man hadn\u2019t been very useful. Even though the man had willingly answered all of his questions, he didn\u2019t dare to believe any of what he\u2019d said.The only thing he knew with certainty was that the man who\u2019d run away was probably of a level higher than the one who\u2019d died.Worse still, that man might come back.He was more inclined to believe that people were cold-blooded, and more so in the case of those two, given that they were killers. There was no certainty that the one who\u2019d run would come back to retrieve his partner.But then again, what if he did?In actual fact, a lot of what-ifs that he\u2019d speculated in that battle had come true. The cunning one who\u2019d run was the truly meticulous and calculative one\u2014the type to fight with their brains.Huff\u2026Xu Xiaoshou exhaled heavily, feeling worn inside and out.Yet, he had to keep alert all the same, as that other man might just be waiting for him to let his guard down.\u201cHow should I go about this?\u201cPre-emptive strike, wait for the assassin to come, or trap him?\u201dIn a split second, dozens of thoughts raced through his head, yet he rejected them all.If he were unable to bear overwhelming force down on that assassin and kill said assassin before he was able to react, then these thoughts would\u2019ve been for nothing.Furthermore, the one who\u2019d escaped was still nonetheless at Voidness Level.That was two whole levels higher than the level he was at.Xu Xiaoshou was exasperated. He wondered who exactly he\u2019d offended to warrant them sending such terrifying assassins at him.Furthermore, according to his experience, the assassins sent at him should\u2019ve only been a little stronger than he was, and he could\u2019ve then used them as stepping stones to facilitate further growth.\u201cThis really isn\u2019t working as it should. How should I go about it, then?He started pondering. If the one who\u2019d escaped were to return, what should he do in order to kill him?Developing powers were out of the question.Innate Level Physique\u2026\u201cYeah, this may be of some use,\u201d he thought.But, when fighting up close and personal, one or the other would definitely end up killed. Too risky.\u201cWell then, that leaves Infernal Heavenly Flames and Innate Sword Will\u2026\u201dHe could afford to splurge with the former, yet he definitely couldn\u2019t use it as his main attack, as it would simply take too much time.As for Innate Sword Will\u2026Xu Xiaoshou wracked his brains. He would be able to win.Only something like that would enable one to kill someone of a higher level, no?Acquired Sword Will could already take on those at Innate Level, so with his sword will now at Innate Level, it wouldn\u2019t be preposterous to think that it could kill someone at Voidness Level.\u201cVery possible indeed.\u201cI can\u2019t afford to get close, yet I have to score a one-hit kill\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBlade-draw!\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201cOnly the fourth style, Blade-draw, that I\u2019ve created would allow me to do that!\u201dHowever, he quickly became dejected again.After making it into Innate Level, the spiritual source it would cause to use that technique was simply too terrifying. That battle with Mo Mo had ended up with him depleting his energy reserve with just two such moves. Useless, then?He guessed that not even High Spirits would allow him to instantly recover from such a splurge.\u201cAnd what if the guy survives after me using that move twice?\u201d he thought. \u201cAm I gonna just fight him barehanded, then?\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s not an option.\u201cI guess that guy probably doesn\u2019t have some Innate Elemental power as ridiculous as Sealing Power right?\u201cNo, no, no. Too dangerous.\u201dXu Xiaoshou shook his head, thinking that unless he had a great deal of spiritual source that he could field in an instant, he would otherwise\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201cHold on!\u201cRecovering large amounts of spiritual source in an instant?\u201cThat seems possible, no?\u201dHe then shuddered, and his legs wobbled, as he came up with this terrifying thought.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: 72Swoop!A short sword sliced through the air, and Xu Xiaoshou caught it.Even though he was using someone else\u2019s spiritual sword, he was still able to use his own Innate Sword Will to execute the Reverse Sword Style.\u201cThe experiment was a success!\u201cWell, this should settle it\u2026\u201dHe clasped the short sword in his hand, and the blade immediately snapped in half.Without an infusion of spiritual source, the spiritual sword was completely unable to resist his Sharpness.He picked up the other short sword and the head on the ground, thought for a moment, then walked out of the door of his place.\u201cWhat would I do if I was the one running away?\u201d He tried to put himself in the assassin\u2019s shoes.\u201cRun!\u201cRun as far as I could and never turn back!\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201cOkay, that seems a little too idealistic.\u201cNow, if I were the one running away and I had to turn back somehow. What would I do?\u201d he asked himself, caressing his chin.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019d most probably check things out from afar using skills similar to Sense, and, if things weren\u2019t in my favor, turn around and run. If things were in my favor, continue moving in with caution.\u201cRegardless of how powerful that guy\u2019s Sense-like skills are, they\u2019re no match to mine. That much was already proven back in that battle in the compound. So, if he were to find somewhere to check things out\u2026\u201dHe peered at that field before his compound and found a winding road before him with two patches of woods on either side of it.\u201cThat\u2019s a really long road. They must\u2019ve taken that road to get to my place.\u201cEven if his sensory powers are indeed very powerful, he\u2019d need to get over halfway inside the woods. If he were to set up an ambush anywhere, this place would be the best choice,\u201d he commented confidently.Clang!He dumped the sword he\u2019d cut in half onto the ground.\u201cIf that guy were here to see this, he\u2019d definitely start panicking.\u201dHe then counted the number of Spiritual Cultivation Pills in his ring. After claiming his reward for becoming champion, he now had tens of bottles left in his ring.\u201cMore than enough.\u201d He then walked into the woods.If that guy didn\u2019t turn around tonight, he would just leave him be. This bit of rain wasn\u2019t that much of a problem.But, if he were to dare turn around\u2026Hmph, they would never be able to go home.\u201cWait\u2026 no,\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat if I just anticipated what he thought, and he anticipated what I\u2019ve anticipated that he thought?\u201dHe felt his skin crawl, finding that to be very possible.He immediately turned around, picked up the broken pieces of the sword, then headed straight into the woods.Every second counts!\u2026Swoop!The sound of something slicing through the air rang out in the rain, and a crimson beam was seen shooting out from the Inner Yard.Feng Kong was filled with uncontrollable rage and indignation.Xu Xiaoshou!That really was Xu Xiaoshou!If it hadn\u2019t been for that far-range telepathic message that Shao Yi sent him before dying, he would have kept waiting at the entrance of the Inner Yard instead.Because of his hesitation and the time he\u2019d spent waiting around, Shao Yi had bit the dust.That guy had killed him!\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have died\u2026\u201d Feng Kong was gritting his teeth so hard that his gums started to bleed. The rage he felt was uncontainable.And when he recalled how Xu Xiaoshou had managed to play them for fools back at the compound, his rage went off the charts.\u201cA puny level niner actually managed to scare me away like this, and then wear down Shao Yi, who was at the peak of Origin Court Level, until he died. This is unforgivable!\u201cYou\u2019d better pray that you can run\u2026\u201d\u201cBut then again, you shall spend the rest of your life living in fear!\u201dFeng Kong was behaving as though he were possessed. His expression was completely twisted as he moved at blitzing speeds. It took him mere moments to go all the way from the Inner Yard to somewhere near Goose Lake.It all looked the same as before. The only difference was that now there was no longer anyone at his side.That was indeed ironic.The rain continued to patter on the surface of the lake, spreading ripples with every drop. The geese and fishes were startled by the terrifying killing intent from Feng Kong, and scattered all over the lake.Bubble, bubble.Several bubbles on the lake popped, and Feng Kong leapt over Goose Lake, then stood on the jade fence.\u201cCalm down!\u201d The rainwater made him come back to his senses, and he calmed his rage.Even though his partner had ended up dead because of his misjudgment, he didn\u2019t see that as any reason to lose his cool.Being a professional killer for years had given him a clear mind, and he steadied himself as he started to think.\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026\u201cThe kid isn\u2019t strong because of his powers. He\u2019s strong because of his thought patterns, which are equal to mine.\u201dThat much had been verified from the psychological game they\u2019d played back in that compound, yet Feng Kong had yet to admit that he\u2019d actually lost in that game.He deemed that he\u2019d only been frightened due to what he\u2019d seen back then, which had given his enemy an advantage to exploit.At the moment, having distanced himself from that game, and now observing it from the outside, he deemed that Xu Xiaoshou had pulled little more than petty tricks.\u201cHe indeed has smarts, yet he lacks the power to back up said smarts. At the end of the day, he\u2019s still just an insect.\u201dDespite this, though, Feng Kong had to take said insect seriously. \u201cIf I were Xu Xiaoshou, how would I get out of such a predicament?\u201cRun!\u201cRun as far as I could, leaving behind that compound altogether.\u201dBut Feng Kong shook his head, knowing that Xu Xiaoshou would never do that. In the first place, Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t escape the Spirit Palace. And even if he did leave the Spirit Palace, he would run into more people after his life.\u201cThe kid is clever. He definitely knows that he could run for the time being, just not for the rest of his life.\u201cSo\u2026 ambush then?\u201dFeng Kong was feeling rather uncertain. He wondered if the kid actually had what it took to pull off an ambush.Yet, he recalled what happened to Shao Yi.That guy had been at the peak of Origin Court Level, and he alone would have been enough to finish the mission.\u201cYet, after I ran\u2026 umm, I got away for mere moments, the kid actually managed to kill Shao Yi.\u201cJust how did he die?\u201dFeng Kong was unable to truly believe any of it. He couldn\u2019t believe that Xu Xiaoshou, even if said kid did have many tricks up his sleeve, a mere level niner, had what it took to kill Shao Yi.Yet, he had to believe the facts at hand.He didn\u2019t dwell on the minor details for long, and simply went on speculating. \u201cIf he does have what it takes to kill me, and he set up an ambush, what would he do?\u201dThe rainy night was all quiet again.As he pondered, his killing intent lessened. The geese on the lake started to cry again, and the lake water bubbled, as if there were fishes blowing bubbles inside.\u201cIf I were Xu Xiaoshou\u2026\u201d Feng Kong tilted his head and frowned. Then, his eyes lit up. \u201cI would deduce my thoughts!\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s how he would do it!\u201cThat guy\u2019s forte is anticipating the thoughts of others. That much was proven back in the compound when he managed to see through all of my plans and tricks.\u201cIf he set up an ambush, he probably thought things through from my angle\u2026\u201dFeng Kong nodded solemnly, feeling that he finally knew what he would be heading into.\u201cHe has no idea what I\u2019m capable of, so he could probably only resort to guesses, and he definitely doesn\u2019t know that I already know who he is right now.\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s say he deduced that I would come back to kill him. He probably wouldn\u2019t anticipate me going all the way to his place to kill him. He\u2019d probably think what I would think. I would take it slow, searching meticulously and checking things out back in the compound\u2026\u201cWith Shao Yi already dead right now, if he\u2019s smart enough he\u2019d know I\u2019d be a sitting duck if I remained back in the compound.\u201cThere\u2019s also only one road leading to that compound. The winding, long road in the woods\u2026\u201dFeng Kong then realized something. \u201cThe woods?\u201cVery possible.\u201cIf I\u2019d gone through with what I planned beforehand, regardless of whether I went all the way or was more cautious, Xu Xiaoshou only would\u2019ve needed to set up an ambush in the woods, and I\u2019d have walked right into it without even thinking of the possibility.\u201cAnd the result\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but shudder at the thought, finding it terrifying.He considered himself lucky for having seen through the situation before making a move. Now there was little else to worry about.Vengeance was seen in Feng Kong\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d initially been out to kill this person because of a mission, but now he had another reason for doing it.To vent his rage.\u201cThe woods, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou, prepare to meet your doom, then.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: You Were So Bad\u2026A storm was brewing, and clouds were gathering.Feng Kong had made up his mind. Thus, without hesitation, off he went with the wind.However, he didn\u2019t expect the tree before him to shake and drop an object after being blown by the wind.Klink Klank!Feng Kong glanced at it indifferently, but when he saw it, he was shocked and almost fell from the sky.\u201cA broken sword?\u201d he thought.\u201cNo, this is\u2026\u201cShao Yi\u2019s sword!\u201dFeng Kong was trembling all over, and his pupils contracted. Although he already knew that Shao Yi had died, seeing the remains of his relics still made him feel tremendously shocked, as if he\u2019d been hit by a tsunami.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201dFeng Kong squeezed through his teeth, deeply aggrieved. He couldn\u2019t help but walk towards the sword, but then something suddenly dawned on him.How could Shao Yi\u2019s sword have dropped here?Could it be that he\u2019d already escaped the courtyard and had run to Goose Lake but still ended up getting aggressively slashed by that Xu Xiaoshou here?If that was the case\u2026Xu Xiaoshou, where art thou?Feng Kong started to become suspicious, as he\u2019d just deduced that Xu Xiaoshou was in the woods, and the scene before him had deeply affected him.Ring!Before he could think further, the broken sword on the ground started to vibrate. Feng Kong thought that this was bad and immediately retreated backward.It was too late!The broken sword exploded suddenly, and a wave of invisible aura instantly spread out.\u201cFire!\u201dFeng Kong was affected in a blink of an eye. Even though his mind was paralyzed from shock, he saw that his body was being burned by an invisible flame.It was an extreme pain!He subconsciously used his spiritual source to guard his body, but his spiritual source also ended up getting burned.\u201cWhat the h*ll is this\u2026\u201dFeng Kong was completely dumbfounded, as he\u2019d never seen invisible flames like this before, but this didn\u2019t stop him from confirming one fact!Xu Xiaoshou was right here at this location!But how was this possible?The area before him was wide and open. Where was Xu Xiaoshou hiding?If he was somewhere in the distance, then how was he able to control this broken sword from afar?\u201cHe must be here!\u201d Feng Kong was knocked back to the white jade railing by the explosion, and he suddenly realized something when he landed on his feet on the ground.\u201cIf he\u2019s not in front of me\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cThen could it be that he\u2019s behind me?\u201cBut I flew by Goose Lake. How is it possible that I didn\u2019t discover him?\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201dHe trembled again all of a sudden and looked over to the surface of the lake with a look of disbelief.Xu Xiaoshou\u2026Was at the bottom of the lake???It seemed that his suspicion was right, as there were bubbles coming off the lake surface, creating splashes. A black shadow then emerged from a water pillar.Feng Kong didn\u2019t have time to turn around, as he\u2019d just come to a halt. He was feeling stiff from switching force, and could only slash at the shadow without thinking.Feng Kong\u2019s bloody hand mercilessly slashed at the black shadow.\u201cSlice!\u201dA crisp sound was immediately heard, and the black shadow was cut in half. At this time, Feng Kong finally saw what the item really was.It was a head!Shao Yi\u2019s head!\u201cAh ah ah!\u201dFeng Kong was sent into hysterics. He\u2026Cut his teammate\u2019s head in half?\u201cXu! Xiao! Shou!\u201d\u201cI will kill you!!!\u201dFeng Kong was consumed by the flame of anger and completely lost his composure. He slashed with his bloody red arms again and threw out two crimson slashes right at the location the head had flown out from.\u201cI, I am here,\u201d a shaky voice came from the other end of the lake. Xu Xiaoshou had shifted his position the moment he threw out the head.Feng Kong looked over suddenly and saw that Xu Xiaoshou was shivering and that his eyes were all white. His legs were bending inward, and, standing on the railing not far away, he looked so frail that he might fall at any moment.However, his right hand was resting on the sword sheath on his left hip. It contained such a jaw-dropping amount of sword will that he went numb looking at him.\u201cInnate Sword Will?\u201dFeng Kong felt his head ache. He was shocked at the incredible level of Innate Sword Will Xu Xiaoshou had.How much energy had he compressed into the sword sheath? If he were to release everything, even an upper spiritual level wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it.Feng Kong suddenly understood how Shao Yi had died.A thick cloud of deadly aura enshrouded him, and he felt a chill go up him from his feet all the way to his head. Without any hesitation, he retreated backward again.\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s too late\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s mouth and teeth were still trembling and chattering, as he had swallowed ten Spiritual Cultivation Pills and compressed the Innate Sword Aura under the lake for more than a quarter of an hour. There was no way this guy could dodge it so easily.Even if Feng Kong were standing in the woods, let alone in close proximity, he still might not be able to dodge it.Xu Xiaoshou bent over slightly, positioning himself lower.\u201cBlade-draw Technique!\u201dHe didn\u2019t draw the sword, but the leaves flew all the same.The willow trees by the lake were completely chopped in half, and a few huge waves were created on the lake. Rain was falling in the woods, and blood was spilling in the sky.\u201cAh!\u201dFeng Kong had nowhere to run as he roared in pain.When he caught a glimpse of the white sword aura, half of his body and an ear was blown away, and the extreme pain almost instantly knocked him out!\u201cDemon!\u201d\u201cThis is a demon!\u201dFeng Kong\u2019s eyes were full of fear, and he completely lost the will to fight.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s fighting strength had nothing to do with his cultivation level. He could fight an upper spiritual level with this sword and maybe even the thirty-three people from the inner yard.The problem was\u2026Why had he waited until now to strike?Why didn\u2019t he do this in the courtyard?Feng Kong was knocked out of his mind, and he started to use his spiritual source to heal himself. If he hadn\u2019t subconsciously tilted his head at the critical moment, it would\u2019ve been cracked open!\u2026\u201cI missed\u2026\u201dOn the other side, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s lips twitched as he stared at the half of Feng Kong\u2019s body that had been cut away, feeling helpless.He had actually screwed up at the final moment due to the pleasant sensation. If not for that, he would have slashed Feng Kong in half, not just a big portion of his body!Even so, he was surprised by his sword.How could it be that strong?It shouldn\u2019t be the case!Even Mo Mo had been able to take the sword barehanded on that day and swallow one more slash. Although he\u2019d done that without the enhancement from ten Spiritual Cultivation Pills, the power between those slashes and this one shouldn\u2019t have been that different.Without much thought, Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his sword again, as he still had some remaining spiritual source.The giant waves on the lake never once subsided, and they actually started raging upward again. The water in the woods was sent into the sky before flowing back to the lake.Feng Kong\u2019s injured body had instincitvely evaded a ray of sword aura, but a second wave of sword aura arrived before he could react.\u201cSlice!\u201dAnother arm was sent flying to the sky.The rainy night was silent as death, and blood was spilled all over the blue sky.The light in Feng Kong\u2019s eyes had gone out. He\u2019d never expected to lose so completely just because of his momentary carelessness.Just because he had wrongly estimated where Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s ambush was it, he\u2019d lost the opportunity to strike first. And now he wouldn\u2019t even be able to use any of his skills before perishing.He stood in the same spot in despair and gave up struggling.He was used to hunting, but now he had become the prey.He had already expected this outcome when he\u2019d chosen to be a killer. The only thing that hadn\u2019t cross his mind was that he would die at the hands of the like of Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this\u2026\u201dFeng Kong was spurting blood. As gaunt as a pillar, he stood still, staring at Xu Xiaoshou with his empty eyes\u2026\u201cHmm?\u201d he thought.\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna execute me? Is he out of spiritual source?\u201dHe saw that Xu Xiaoshou had let go of his sword. Had he decided to let him go alive?Feng Kong was wild with joy, and he turned to leave.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dA blue light flashed before him and instantly impaled his head.Ugh\u2026What the f*ck was that?Feng Kong collapsed. He was still confused as his consciousness slowly dissipated. It wasn\u2019t until the very final moment of his life that he then realized:Shao Yi\u2019s\u2026 sword?But nobody would answer him anymore.Under the sunlight, there wasn\u2019t even a single bone left.\u201cI thought you were good, but I was wrong\u2026\u201cWhen you slashed the head in half, still not realizing the existence of the sword, that was when you lost. Even if you had dodged my \u201cBlade-drawing Technique\u201d later on\u2026\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t even dodge Blade-drawing Technique.Xu Xiaoshou walked by slowly and picked up the sword, then turned to Goose Lake.\u201cYou were so bad\u2026\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: The Night is BeautifulWere they really that bad?Actually, they were doing okay.However, Xu Xiaoshou realized that he had severely overestimated those two because of their strengths.For a real life-and-death battle, the factors that determined survival consisted of more than just one\u2019s cultivation level, unless one were up against two complete idiots.An arena battle was completely different. Factors that determined survival included timing, location, and personal agency\u2026He couldn\u2019t do without any of them.He\u2019d been able to realize their intentions because of Sense, which had also caused him to misjudge their true strengths due to the cultivation level and the accidental geographical changes resulting from the lucky draw. As such, he\u2019d had to make a series of guesses.Of course, it was undeniable that his adaptability had saved his life.Hmm\u2026To be frank, he was just smart!Xu Xiaoshou was a little scared, because if he hadn\u2019t managed to intimidate those two, leading them to initiate the battle first, the end result could\u2019ve been vastly different.Yet again, after this battle, he felt that even if the two of them had stuck together, they still wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat him.\u201cI\u2019m getting a little too cocky\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou patted himself on the head.jStaring at Goose Lake\u2019s misty rain, Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep silence.The first rain he had witnessed in this world had taken two lives away.Including Wenchong, he\u2019d already claimed three lives.As he\u2019d expected, the world he was in now was completely different from the previous world he\u2019d lived in. If he couldn\u2019t adapt well to the rules of survival here, he might be the next one to die.\u201cHmm?\u201d he thought.\u201cWen Chong?\u201cThese two, were they here to seek vengeance for Wen Chong?\u201dXu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered that although he couldn\u2019t be held accountable for the battle in the arena, and that Wen Chong was the one who\u2019d assaulted him first, there was no evidence to suggest that Wen Chong didn\u2019t have companions.It totally made sense that there were people seeking revenge for him after his death!\u201cEr\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was stunned, as he\u2019d just realized that he was at a disadvantage because of his orphan status. He hadn\u2019t at all thought that people would seek revenge for their companions.Looking at it from this perspective, this made sense.Two assassins had been killed today, and he expected there to be more tomorrow\u2026\u201cOh my god, is this a never-ending nightmare!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou hugged his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right!Who were these two?Some mere killers?Could they be?Since they were able to move through the Spirit Palace so freely, they must be a part of the inner palace, which was to say they were a part of them.However, it didn\u2019t make sense to categorize them as Inner Yard disciples. He would\u2019ve bought this at the start, but definitely not now.They were so weak. Could they really be the disciples who had cultivated inside the Inner Yard for more than two years?Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that something was wrong here. Could it be that it wasn\u2019t that they were too weak\u2026But that he was too powerful?\u201cI am really getting too cocky\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou slapped himself again.The only thing he was curious about was if that dull guy could really take his sword skill\u2026\u201cHe\u2019s at least of Voidness Level. He shouldn\u2019t be so weak\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou could declare that even after swallowing ten Spiritual Cultivation Pills, his Blade-draw Technique had indeed strengthened, but not to the point of doubling the power.\u201cHow is it possible that\u2026\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even block it?!\u201cEven Mo Mo could take one sword!\u201cCould it be that Mo Mo was actually stronger than that dude?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou thought.He was dumbfounded, but then he suddenly remembered Mo Mo\u2019s right hand and her mystical sealed power.To his knowledge, nobody but her possessed such an eerie power.Even for the two he\u2019d just fought, he could barely deduce their Innate Elemental power.The first one should be metal element, which was similar to his own Sharpness. All he did was one strike.The second one was most likely blood element, his blood hand\u2026Hmm, he couldn\u2019t even land an effective hit!\u201cSealing Technique\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was thinking vigorously. Perhaps, maybe there were some people out there who were as talented as him!\u201cI\u2019ve got to ask Elder Qiao sometime\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t too bothered, as the world was huge and there were many interesting things. His Innate Level physique was probably a miracle in others\u2019 eyes too.He\u2019d ended up acquiring Innate sword will too\u2026\u201cHeheh!\u201dXu Xiaoshou calmed down. This battle had definitely made him more conscious of his battle capability.He had unknowingly acquired ranged attacks, and it was a very powerful instant cutting skill. After swallowing the pills, it seemed like even the powerful individuals from Voidness Level couldn\u2019t block it.Hmm, except for some special people.Close combat\u2026That was supposed to be his forte, but he had saved it as a last resort tonight and ended up not using it.From the dude\u2019s attack in the courtyard, he could tell that with his Recoil skill, not many people could instantly kill him.So his close combat skills were probably invincible, as he also had the great eight innate passive skills\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion: what doesn\u2019t kill me only makes me stronger.\u201cHmm, and that disgusting Infernal Heavenly Flame\u2026\u201dActually, it should be counted as Infernal Heavens, but it was pure Spiritual skill. Since his cultivation level was stuck, he couldn\u2019t use it at all. It would be pretty lucky to just burn at least one target.The fires could burn a radius of ten thousand miles.\u201cHmm, let\u2019s go back to sleep. Who knows what will come in my dreams.\u201cStill got to cultivate properly!\u201cIf my strength could allow me to thrash around brainlessly, then fighting wouldn\u2019t be so tiring. It\u2019s actually wasting my brain cells\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou stretched and yawned, consumed by endless exhaustion.The night was\u2026He was thoroughly tortured by Infernal Flame Seed, and then experienced a dozen rounds of extreme mood swings. Before he could finish his wet dream, he was abruptly interrupted and had to waste countless brain cells killing two people\u2026It was indeed phenomenal!\u201cBetter go back to sleep, lest there be more troubles.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was about to turn around when the information bar in his brain suddenly updated.Gazed, Passive Points, +1\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was completely stunned and didn\u2019t know whether to turn around or not.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought.\u201cI was only thinking about it. I didn\u2019t say anything out loud, so I didn\u2019t say anything bad!\u201dWhat, now the thoughts in his brain could be manifested automatically?Xu Xiaoshou was terrified. He repeatedly activated Sense but couldn\u2019t sense anyone around him.He swallowed his saliva, and greeted with much difficulty, \u201cElder Sang?\u201dNobody answered.Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy, as he realized that the information bar was a terrifying existence. A random line of words could very well shock him to death.No words could describe his urge to erase the word \u201cgazed\u201d from his dictionary and never see them again.Who could it be?If it wasn\u2019t Elder Sang, then who had the sick hobby of gazing at him?Could it be the third killer?This wasn\u2019t important, but the fact that he could gaze at him without being sensed suggested that this person was of at least Elder Sang\u2019s level!Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t dare to move an inch, so he inched back to the white jade railing and leaned on it. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful\u2026\u201cThe night is beautiful!\u201cThe rain is also beautiful\u2026\u201cSo so so beautiful!\u201dHe tried to enlarge the sensing area and finally discovered a shadowy figure at the end of the road in the direction of the woods.So far?Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and was no longer afraid. He turned around, wanting to get a better look.A pair of pitch-black eyes abruptly appeared in his line of sight.They were as close as a few punches away.\u201cWhat the heck!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart almost leapt out of his throat, and a black sword shot out of his chest.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: I just Wanted to Ask for Directions!The rain was pitter-pattering, and it didn\u2019t seem like it was going to subside anytime soon.Before him stood a masked person covered in black. His whole body was so tightly covered that even his fingers were enveloped by a pair of thick gloves.The only party of him exposed, a pair of eyes, was so murky that it looked like only shades of dusks resided within.If he were to see this pair of eyes again in the future in a sea of people, he wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize them.They belonged to an ordinary person!But could this dude really be an ordinary person?Xu Xiaoshou stared at Hiding Pain, which was stuck between them. In one quick moment, it sprung toward him, and yet he was able to react to it.The sword came extremely close to the masked person\u2019s heart, but he directly stopped it with two fingers.Xu Xiaoshou was completely puzzled.This was a ninth-grade spiritual sword that had cost him thousands of spiritual crystals. On top of that, it also carried a powerful innate sword will with it when it\u2019d sprung at him, yet this man had easily blocked it.And, looking at his next move, it looked like if he were to cross his fingers, the sword would simply break in half.\u201cHey, don\u2019t!\u201dXu Xiaoshou closed the gap between them in a flash and grabbed the masked man\u2019s fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t break it,\u201d he said, a look of shock on his face. \u201cThis is my life. If you break it, who will I cry to?\u201dThe masked person was really shocked. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s reaction was\u2026\u201cHe\u2019s not scared of me?\u201d he thought.\u201cI\u2019m not going to break it. Take your hands off me\u2026\u201cHmm? And your legs too!\u201dHis expression turned serious, although this wasn\u2019t visible to the others, as he was covered in a black rag.But this boy\u2026He had actually encircled him with his arms within such a short moment and now he couldn\u2019t move either of his hands.At the same time, both of his legs had also crawled up on his own thighs, making the lower half of his body unsteady and exposing its instability, making it prone to attacks.That was a very powerful body manipulating technique\u2026A human lock?Was his zodiac sign the octopus?1\u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cI just wanted to ask for directions!\u201dXu Xiaoshou listened to this coarse voice that was like a saw on his ears, and got goosebumps. His eardrums were experiencing hell.Was this a voice of a human? It was so disgusting!However, judging from the voice, the masked man was probably quite old, at least of a middle-aged uncle level.Xu Xiaoshou increased his strength for his human lock. \u201cNo, who the h*ll would ask for directions in such wee hours of the morning?\u201cAnd it\u2019s raining heavily. Are you a psycho!?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe masked man let out a deep sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019d already be dead right now if I wanted to kill you?\u201d\u201cHo!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou laughed coldly. \u201cOr maybe the only reason why I\u2019m alive right now is because I have you locked up like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe masked man was completely p*ssed. What the h*ll was that? He was definitely toxic!\u201cLet go!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou kept quiet for a moment, then he took advantage of the masked man\u2019s momentary relaxation to push the black sword into his heart with his chest.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe masked man\u2019s eyes widened with disbelief and shock.Even with his black mask on, Xu Xiaoshou could smell the blood. After ensuring that he was safe, he finally asked, \u201cOkay, what did you want to ask me?\u201d\u201c???\u201dCursed, Passive point, +1.Spited, Passive Point, +1.Marked, Passive Point, +1.Hoho, he\u2019d been marked?Did that mean the man was planning on killing him someday in the future?Xu Xiaoshou became murderous suddenly and continued to thrust the sword forward to impale the masked man.\u201cHa!\u201dAt this time, his palm felt a painful sensation, and he involuntarily released his fingers. The masked man flicked his finger, and the black sword was sent flying.Bang!Not letting go of the opportunity, the masked man clashed head-on with Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s head, intending to knock him back.However, the next moment he clutched his forehead and moaned instead.\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201cAre you made of iron?!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s legs were still on his thighs, and he immediately bounced back to lock him up. Now the masked man couldn\u2019t even move his head.After doing all this, Xu Xiaoshou felt a little scared.What did this guy do just now? How could he pierce his palm with just two fingers?To be frank, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s body was enhanced with the eight great innate passive skills\u2026This masked uncle felt odd!Xu Xiaoshou glanced over and caught a glimpse of the fading sword will on the tip of his fingers.Sword will?What a weak sword will!If it wasn\u2019t for his highly sensitive Sense, he wouldn\u2019t have even detected it.So here was the question: if this man could pierce through his palm, then why did he feel pain from a headbutt?It was weird. This man was really weird!He wanted to take off the black mask that covered the masked man\u2019s hair but was afraid that he\u2019d be killed for knowing that man\u2019s real identity.This strength of this masked man was a mystery.\u201cIf you don\u2019t belong to Tiansang Spirit Palace, then how did you get in?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou probed.The masked man fell silent and didn\u2019t talk. After a while, he finally let out a cough, which made Xu Xiaoshou realize that he was choking him.He relaxed his grip on the man\u2019s throat.\u201cUgh! Cough cough\u2026\u201dThe masked man declared naturally, \u201cI am!\u201d\u201cCheated, Passive Point, +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was a little speechless. He wanted to laugh but couldn\u2019t.Although this man was shameless, it meant that he\u2019d come in from outside the spirit palace, since he had lied blatantly.So\u2026Xu Xiaoshou was a little panicky. The spirit palace was guarded by a powerful array. The two he\u2019d just killed were probably from within the palace.With their strength, they probably hadn\u2019t entered from the outside.However, this masked man had really come in from the outside? Didn\u2019t that mean he was an expert among experts?But why was he so weak?This didn\u2019t match up with his actual strength.\u201cWho the heck are you\u2026\u201d But Xu Xiaoshou abruptly stopped mid-way through saying this, thinking it could be problematic for him to learn the masked man\u2019s identity, so he changed the question. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cTo ask for directions!\u201d the masked man yelled.\u201cTo heaven?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCursed, Passive Points, +1.\u201dHa, his psychological activity was still abundant!Xu Xiaoshou tightened his grip. \u201cSpit it!\u201d\u201cCough cough! Let go\u2026\u201d The masked man struggled violently, and his two fingers made to project a faint sword will. This startled Xu Xiaoshou, so he let go slightly.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dThe masked man panted heavily and suppressed the desire to attack, telling himself that Xu Xiaoshou was an irrelevant small fry and he shouldn\u2019t startle more people.After resting for a long time, he asked slowly, \u201cThe inner yard, where is it?\u201dXu Xiaoshou: \u201c???\u201d\u201cJust that?\u201dAll this time just to ask where the Inner Yard was?Why didn\u2019t he just say so earlier?!This provoked the masked man again, but he managed to suppress his anger and nodded in response.This was probably the most ridiculous thing that had ever happened to him in his few decades of life. All he\u2019d wanted to do was ask for directions and had ended up injured and even gotten stabbed in the heart instead.And worse still, he\u2019d gotten a sarcastic reply after asking\u2026Frustrating!!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: 76\u201cThe Inner Yard is over there.\u201dXu Xiaoshou pointed in the direction of the Inner Yard with his back facing the man.There were three paths at the corner of the small forest. One lead to his own yard, and another one led to the Outer Yard. It was a straight path that led right to the Chuyun Platform, where the Windcloud Competition took place.The third path led to Goose Lake. By following this path, one could enter the Inner Yard and reach the Spiritual Library Division after turning a corner.\u201cWhy do you want to go to the Inner Yard? Do you intend to steal books there?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously.This man was wrapped from head to toe, and only his eyes were visible. He indeed looked like a thief, or even a robber.However, if he was a thief, he wouldn\u2019t have come here so recklessly without knowing how to get around the place.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something you should know,\u201d the masked man sternly replied.\u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201cBut curiosity killed the cat.\u201d\u201cOh, you go ahead then,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said casually.The masked man asked through gritted teeth, \u201cSo, can you get off of me now?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201dAs a matter of fact, Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t dare to get off his body; but it definitely wasn\u2019t a good idea to continue riding him. At least, he didn\u2019t want to get brought along while this man stole; otherwise, he\u2019d become the man\u2019s accomplice.He forcefully bumped his stomach against the man\u2019s back and a powerful counterforce made the two of them bounce in opposite directions, instantly separating them by dozens of meters.Xu Xiaoshou dashed forward with his head lowered for a long while, but he found there was no commotion behind him and couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised.He turned his head and saw the masked man pull himself up with difficulty by leaning against a tree trunk from a pool of water on the forest path.Xu Xiaoshou, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so weak,\u201d he thought. \u201cHow can you have the courage to be a thief?\u201cDid you really come here from outside of the Spirit Palace?\u201cI suspect that you\u2019re playing me.\u201dThe masked man didn\u2019t pay Xu Xiaoshou any attention. It seemed that in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes, the only reason for his existence was to ask his ordinary inquiries.Yet, after walking toward the Inner Yard for a while, the masked man discovered that Xu Xiaoshou kept on peeking at him clandestinely while curled up underneath the white jade railing, like a thief stealing a bell with his ears covered.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe man halted in his tracks and said with a sigh, \u201cYou fought pretty well earlier; but your sword style was a bit off. You should fix that as soon as possible.\u201dWith arched eyebrows, Xu Xiaoshou realized that his man had witnessed the process of him killing those two men.The thought of killing the man to shut him up once again crossed his mind, but the problem was whether he could beat the man or not.This man was way too weird!\u201cMy sword style was the idea of one of my genius friends. You\u2019re too clueless to understand it,\u201d said Xu Xiaoshou in an attempt to test the man.\u201cYour path has been trodden by too many people before you.\u201d The masked man didn\u2019t stay around and walked straight away.Xu Xiaoshou felt disturbed as he gazed at the man\u2019s receding back.\u201cIs he trying to trick me?\u201d he thought.\u201cOr, has somebody already tried the path of the pure sword will fighting style he\u2019s pursuing right now?\u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201cI\u2019ve merely used the \u2018blade-draw technique.\u2019 How did this man find out about his style?\u201cHis sword will is so weak. How dare he criticize others!\u201cIt\u2019s preposterous!\u201d\u201cMy style was the idea of a genius!\u201d shouted Xu Xiaoshou furiously.The masked man didn\u2019t respond.\u201cRidiculed, passive point, +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and shouted again, \u201cTen Sections of the Finger Sword!\u201dHe expected the man to twist his body or halt in his tracks, but he did none of these things.Xu Xiaoshou watched the man disappear at the end of the path.\u201cI guessed wrong?\u201d he wondered, but wasn\u2019t so sure.The sword technique the man had used earlier to injure him had looked a lot like the Finger Blessed with Sword Will.Yet, that was rather impossible, because he\u2019d just seen the sword technique of Heavenly Horse Traversing in the Sky in the Spiritual Library Division not long ago, so how would someone have started using it already?\u201cMy mind must\u2019ve been playing tricks on me\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou shook his head, trying to shake off such a ridiculous idea, then decided to leave the place.What the man was intending to steal or how he would do it had nothing to do with him as long he didn\u2019t expose the matter of him killing someone, Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.Judging by the man\u2019s temperament, he probably wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about the incident.On the other hand, no one would believe a thief who\u2019d snuck into the Spirit Palace on a rainy night anyway, even if he did tell them that he\u2019d killed someone.Xu Xiaoshou thought the man was quite eccentric and that he might get involved in some kind of serious trouble, so he had no intention of having himself implicated.\u201cI\u2019d better go back to sleep!\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t reappear\u2026\u201cBah! Shut up!\u201dXu Xiaoshou slapped himself on the face and decided to leave after turning around, but he halted in his tracks.He saw the masked man come back from the end of the path, and he looked rather uneasy as he was running.Xu Xiaoshou turned around without a second thought and ran away as fast as his legs could carry him.Because he\u2019d spotted a group of law enforcers from the Spiritual Law Division right on the man\u2019s heels.\u201cIt\u2019s truly too convenient!\u201dThere was no way the law enforcers could\u2019ve discovered the masked man so quickly. The only explanation was that the sound of his fighting earlier was so loud that they\u2019d been drawn by it.Though the assassination of him had occurred before he\u2019d killed the assassins, he had nonetheless killed someone. As such, Xu Xiaoshou felt quite nervous.\u201cHi!\u201dA shadow swept by and blocked Xu Xiaoshou.It was the masked man!How did he move so fast?! Maybe he was playing him.Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t stop his momentum in time and bumped into the masked man, but the man wasn\u2019t knocked flying away. Instead, the man took the opportunity to lift Xu Xiaoshou up and hold him around his waist.\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you, but I need you to stage a show. I\u2019ll let you go after I get out of the Spirit Palace.\u201d The hoarse voice, which sounded like grating sandpaper, rang out again.\u201cI would be a fool to believe you,\u201d he thought.He struggled to get free, but the man unexpectedly pointed one of his fingers at his waist. The formidable sword energy instantly assaulted the interior of his body, breaking his inner energy into pieces.\u201cHmm?\u201d he thought. \u201cHe\u2019s actually quite outstanding since he has such a powerful energy.\u201dThe masked man noticed something and made the sword energy more scattered and frequent, passing through Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s flesh like a great many tiny razors. As a result, even the recovery power of \u201cEternal Vitality\u201d was suppressed.\u201cAttacked, passive point, +1.\u201d\u201cAttacked, passive point, +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe information bar came back to life from its downtime and started to work at once.\u201cPoof!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and lost complete control of his body.His expression darkened. Had he fallen into the tiger\u2019s den after just getting out of the dragon\u2019s den?The man was indeed playing him. The control power of the sword will was too formidable, and was many times more so than his own.Xu Xiaoshou was almost in tears. Why did he always meet opponents of the elder status?Elder Sang was an exception because he was nevertheless a friend. Even though Xu Xiaoshou was often tormented by Elder Sang, their encounters always brought some benefits for him at the same time.Judging by his cultivation of the sword will, this masked man, who\u2019d come out of nowhere, was as powerful as any other masters.\u201cLet go of me.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was startled. This situation felt familiar. Did that mean good luck took turns?\u201cIf you let go of me, I\u2019ll help you get out of the Spirit Palace,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou genuinely promised.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201dXu Xiaoshou: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was so frustrating!Yet, he could do nothing about it.Xu Xiaoshou held his breath. In fact, the pain in his body was tolerable, as he was used to it. However, his body was being restrained by the masked man. He couldn\u2019t move an inch. It was all he could do to move his mouth.Xu Xiaoshou continued tricking the man. \u201cI tell you that you\u2019d better put me down because I know many people. Do you know Qiao Qianzhi, the Elder of the Spiritual Affairs Division\u2026\u201cNo, you don\u2019t know him? It\u2019s okay that you don\u2019t know him. But what about Xiao Qixiu? He\u2019s the Chief Elder of the Spiritual Law Division\u2026\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of him? What about Elder Sang\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou suddenly calmed down and realized that he was using the same threatening words as those used by the villains after they were captured. What he was doing was no different than courting death!Unexpectedly, the masked man paused when he heard Elder Sang\u2019s name mentioned. \u201cDid he come back?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou responded quickly after a jolt.\u201cElder Sang!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know him,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou calmly answered.The masked man: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCursed, passive point, +1.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: The Masked Man\u2019s First StrikeThe masked man moved extremely fast. Even though he had Xu Xiaoshou in a chokehold, this had no effect on his speed.Yet, the law enforcers of the Spirit Law Division were equally capable. They were keeping pace and weren\u2019t that far behind.Goose Lake was rather large, but the masked man crossed it in a few steps.It was just then that a group of law enforcers appeared in front of the two of them. The masked man wasn\u2019t the only one who was stunned. Xu Xiaoshou was also puzzled.He wondered if this group of law enforcers had come over after hearing the noise from his fighting. But it seemed more likely that they\u2019d been planning an ambush on them all along\u2026Well!Perhaps, they hadn\u2019t been drawn by the noise but had been lying in ambush this whole time.Xu Xiaoshou looked at the masked man in surprise, wondering who this man was and why so many law enforcers of the Spirit Law Division had come out to ambush him.Though his fight from earlier had been earth-shattering, it hadn\u2019t interrupted the plans of the Spirit Law Division. No one had bothered to come out to stop him from killing his opponents.Xu Xiaoshou felt unimportant at the moment.It turned out that he wasn\u2019t a part of their plans and that he might have actually disrupted the plans of the Spirit Palace.The masked man stopped in his tracks and turned around. At that moment, many heads could be seen on the other two edges of Goose Lake.Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart go cold as he realized it was true\u2026These law enforcers had been waiting here all along!\u201cAre you the \u2018Saint Servant\u2019 Elder Sang mentioned? We\u2019ve been waiting for you for a few days. You\u2019d better surrender yourself.\u201d Xiao Qixiu walked out from the forest with a long sword on his back while looking sideways at the masked man.\u201cHe has come back\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was probably the only one who could hear the masked man\u2019s whisper. The man suddenly lowered his head and asked, \u201cRascal, do you know Elder Sang?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was almost in tears. He wished he\u2019d minded his mouth. The situation had turned against him. His careless words had put him in a perilous situation now.He looked at Xiao Qixiu and shouted, \u201cMaster Judge, help me. This guy just killed two disciples of the Spirit Palace. I don\u2019t want to be the third!\u201dXiao Qixiu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis lad must think I\u2019m blind,\u201d he thought. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting here for a long time and didn\u2019t see the man kill anyone.\u201dXiao Qixiu didn\u2019t want anything to stand in the way of the more important matter at hand. This evening, he would seize everyone who made trouble and send them to the punishment platform.Despised, passive point, +1.The masked man was puzzled when he heard what Xu Xiaoshou said.He wondered when he\u2019d killed someone. It was obvious that this lad was throwing mud at him with no shame at all.Cursed, passive point, +1.\u201cYou rascal\u2026\u201dAs the masked man made to increase the intensity of his sword energy to make Xu Xiaoshou suffer more, he heard the lad at his waist say, \u201cCalm down. Don\u2019t be witless.\u201cIf you admitt that you killed two people, I\u2019ll guarantee your safe departure from the Spirit Palace.\u201dThe masked man was amused by this remark. What would a lad like him with such a low cultivation level be able to do?Xu Xiaoshou realized his trick wasn\u2019t working and came up with another lie. \u201cI guess you must be a member of an evil\u2026bah, a righteous organization.\u201cAs a matter of fact, I can\u2019t stand this Spirit Palace anymore. They\u2019re all too hypocritical. I\u2019ve wanted to join you guys for a long time now.\u201cYou\u2019ll follow my instructions later since I know a secret passage\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve wanted to join us?\u201d the masked man interrupted him.Xu Xiaoshou was startled. The man seemed to be more interested in this matter than the mention of the secret passage, which was what he should\u2019ve been interested in.He was a bit worried that what he\u2019d said was true and that this man was a member of an evil organization.\u201cThis isn\u2019t that important. What is important is the secret passage\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you really want to join us?\u201d the masked man interrupted him once more.Xu Xiaoshou felt like crying again. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve set my heart on it!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cWen Chong,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said, making up the name without a second thought. \u201cWen as in the phrase \u2018never heard of,\u2019 and Chong as in \u2018recharging money.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018recharging money?\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s recharging Q\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou trailed in the middle of his sentence and waved his hand. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand it no matter how I explained it\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it the \u2018Chong\u2019 as in surfing?\u201d\u201cWhat surfing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou had to admit that he was indeed a bit nervous, but he tried his best to stay calm.\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Ming\u2019 as in being clever.\u201d\u201cOh, \u2018Ming\u2019 as in clever\u2026\u201dThere was a hint of mockery in the masked man\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo your name is Wen Ming?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt like crying. Why did he have to go and behave so badly tonight and make so many mistakes with his choice of words?\u201cMy name is Wen Chong!\u201d he said weakly.The masked man didn\u2019t respond, as Xiao Qixiu had drawn near.The man shook his body a little and flew to a high elevation over Goose Lake. The raindrops seemed to be colder at such a height.Xu Xiaoshou looked down at the shrunken Goose Lake below. The hundreds of law enforcers looked like a thin thread, and he started to feel scared.Even when he was on his sword, he didn\u2019t dare to fly this high. If he fell from such a height, his innate flesh physique would turn into a pile of flesh mud.\u201cYou have to hold me tightly!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou pressed deeper into the masked man\u2019s bosom. At the moment he was very timid.The masked man was amused. The man pulled out his finger that was behind Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s back and hoisted him instead. \u201cIf you stay motionless, you won\u2019t fall.\u201dXu Xiaoshou grew more anxious. Though the pain in his body was gone, he felt considerably less safe.He thought about it and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better put your finger in my back again. I don\u2019t feel safe this way.\u201dThe masked man: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis lad must be mentally challenged!Without a second thought, the masked man put his finger back into Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s back to make him spit out a mouthful of fresh blood with a puff.\u201cD*mn it. You took my words literally!\u201cTake your finger out, quickly. I was just kidding.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt uneasy. This man didn\u2019t behave like a normal person.The masked man pulled his finger out. But before Xu Xiaoshou could feel relief, he found his body was thrown higher in the sky.The whooshing wind almost scared him to death.\u201cHelp me!\u201d\u201cShut up and watch out!\u201d the masked man yelled harshly.Though his eyes were assaulted by the wind and rain and he had a hard time keeping his eyes open, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly Sense his surroundings.He Sensed Xiao Qixiu on the ground reach out his hand, and the long sword on his back tore apart a green path in the night sky as he headed toward the masked man like a shooting star.The sword will contained in the striking sword was equivalent to a violent wild beast. As such, the raindrops in the sky turned into nothingness whereever the sword passed.Xu Xiaoshou now understood why the masked man had thrown him high up in the sky.If the man hadn\u2019t thrown him so far away, Xu Xiaoshou figured that he would have been torn into oblivion like the raindrops turning into smoke before the sword drew near.Yet, the masked man wasn\u2019t affected at all.Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou vaguely heard the masked man\u2019s mocking remark:\u201cAmong those who have dared to attack me, you\u2019re the weakest\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt troubled. This man was truly shameless.He was indeed a showman\u2026Xu Xiaoshou thought his former reckless behavior in the competition arena couldn\u2019t hold a candle to this man.Before Xu Xiaoshou could complain further, his eyes widened the next moment.The masked man didn\u2019t move an inch. All he was doing was staring at the longsword heading his way, a slight sword will still on his body.Yet, the longsword shuddered for no obvious reason and gave out a wailing sound. It seemed that the sword was under tremendous pressure, and it turned around and shot at Xiao Qixiu.Xiao Qixiu was stunned. It was hard for him to fathom why the sword that had been with him for decades would intend to destroy its own master.Unfortunately, Xiao Qixiu didn\u2019t have enough time to reflect on this. The returning longsword traveled faster than the speed of his control.As Xiao Qixiu made to move, the sword energy in his body suddenly exploded, throwing everyone around him onto the ground. At the same time, Xiao Qixiu was confined on the spot by the sword energy.Poo!The longsword passed through Xiao Qixiu\u2019s body.\u201cPuff!\u201dXiao Qixiu\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief as blood poured out from every orifice in his body.Xu Xiaoshou was so horrified his eyeballs almost jumped out of their sockets.The masked man slowly lifted his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou, his cloudy eyes showing a hint of motion.\u201cIf I\u2019m right\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the path of the sword will you are on right now.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: 78Xu Xiaoshou was back in the hands of the masked man again. This time he behaved as amiably as a cat.\u201cWell stop torturing me! I\u2019m not that formidable at all!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said weakly.A hint of a smile appeared in the cloudy eyes of the masked man. The man started to say something, but then he began to cough violently.\u201cCough, cough\u2026puff!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was nervous to hear this coughing sound, and he wondered if the man would accidentally drop him since he was coughing blood.He\u2019d figured out why the masked man was so weak at the moment\u2014employing a powerful strike could also injure one\u2019s body.\u201cWas that move just now \u2018All Things are Swords\u2019?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou asked.The masked man nodded. \u201cThe Innate Level \u2018All Things are Swords.\u2019\u201dXu Xiaoshou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLike I\u2019d believe that,\u201d he thought. \u201cI am innate sword will myself, so I very well know the magnitude of the innateness. Who are you trying to fool?\u201dThe masked man was aware that Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t believe him, but he muttered to himself, \u201cThe true sword will has no level and is not related to the form. It utilizes the assault of the opponent to attack the opponent.\u201cAs long as you master the essence of the sword, nobody will dare to attack you with their swords. It\u2019s because\u2026\u201d\u201cYour sword becomes my sword?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou chimed in.The masked man froze for a moment and didn\u2019t give a definite answer. \u201cIt can be described this way, but\u2026\u201dThe man paused and turned his eyes to the ground below.\u201cThis path has been already trodden too many times by the others. It\u2019s a dead-end. Your sword will is pretty good, so you should give it up as soon as possible.\u201dXu Xiaoshou seemed to see dark spots floating before his eyes.Your sword will is pretty good, so you should give it up as soon as possible\u2026What nonsense this was!\u201cI\u2019ve just started to walk on the path, and you probably haven\u2019t reached the end of your path yet,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said eloquently.He figured he wouldn\u2019t achieve anything if he couldn\u2019t take this path.His talent for cultivation was obvious. It would be better for him to do nothing if he had to learn the spirit technique; at least he could come up to an understanding of \u201cappreciating time\u201d in the end by doing so.The masked man ignored him. There was a commotion below.Xiao Qixiu had lost the ability to fight after being injured by the shooting sword. The law enforcers were all stunned.Even though Elder Sang had warned them that the enemy was a bit strong this time, nobody had expected him to be so powerful.After one strike, Xiao Qixiu, a swordsman in the throne status, had lost the ability to fight back.Their opponent was a bit too powerful.It was then that another person walked out on the forest path. The law enforcers, who\u2019d been anxious, pushed their chests forward and held their heads up high when they saw this person, and they angrily stared at the two people in the sky. It seemed like they\u2019d gotten their spines back.The person walking out was dressed like a young Daoist with white hair and a beard, giving off the aura of a fairy man.The only thing that spoiled this impression was his height.When he stood on the ground, he looked like he only came up to the waist of most men.It could be said that he was as tall as Su Qianqian\u2026Fortunately, he was drifting in the air.\u201cYe Xiaotian\u2026\u201d the masked man murmured, a grim look in his eyes.Xu Xiaoshou was startled to find out that this short man was the legendary Chief of the Inner Yard.Ye Xiaotian drifted to the front of Xiao Qixiu and checked his injury, then he disappeared after pulling the longsword out of Xiao Qixiu\u2019s body.Xu Xiaoshou lifted his head in surprise and saw the white-haired young Daoist right in front of the two of them.Ye Xiaotian inserted one of his hands into the empty space in front of him, and a cloud of mysterious darkness rolled up and down, giving off a horrific power. It seemed like he could pull down the sky with his hand.\u201cThis is called the \u2018Hand of Ripping Heaven,\u2019 which is Ye Xiaotian\u2019s special technique. He can pull down a piece of space and use it to crush his opponent to death,\u201d the masked man explained.Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201cWhat level has this master achieved?\u201cWhy did I get involved in this fight in the first place?\u201d he thought.Those two damned assassins were to blame. He wasn\u2019t sorry that they were dead. He wished they would come back to life again so that he could cut them into pieces a second time to vent his anger.The three of them hovered high in the night sky. The air was quite cold here.Ye Xiaotian didn\u2019t say anything. He stared straight at the masked man with his hand inserted in the empty space. He didn\u2019t seem to pay any attention to Xu Xiaoshou.The masked man muttered to himself, \u201cTo escape from Ye Xiaotian is futile. Usually, the only thing people can do is chitchat about what their last words will be.\u201cThis guy has a rare spatial quality. I heard that he was able to fight against a swordsman a half-step into Master Level as soon as he achieved innateness.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hold a candle to you. You\u2019re innate enough to defeat the masters,\u201d Ye Xiaotian finally spoke. His voice sounded like a tender child\u2019s.\u201cI don\u2019t have such a talent. You must have mistaken me for someone else.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201d There was a hint of coldness in Ye Xiaotian\u2019s childish voice that was unfitting for a child.Listening to the compliments the two men offered each other, Xu Xiaoshou felt dizzy and almost fell down from the sky.What weirdos!Xu Xiaoshou had thought himself rather formidable after cultivating ninth spirit level and killing Origin Court and Occupied Void; but now he\u2019d found out that he was nothing in comparison to these true geniuses.\u201cIs this spatial quality a power of innateness,\u201d he thought. \u201cBut it sounds very horrific!\u201cAnd who is this masked man? What kind of weirdo is he? The Master Chief of the Inner Yard is about to attack, but he still has enough leisure time to talk.\u201cWell?\u201cWhy does this guy explain so much to me?\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt sick as he thought all of this over.\u201cMaster Chief, I\u2019m not with him. You go ahead and fight him, but don\u2019t involve me in your fight!\u201dA hint of a smile appeared in the corners of the masked man\u2019s eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you would like to join us?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou froze, and his face turned white. \u201cSorry to bother you, but please put me down on the ground. I\u2019d like to bid my goodbyes now.\u201dYe Xiaotian turned his attention to the young man at the masked man\u2019s waist. He was surprised that this young lad dared to joke around when he was between two powerful swordsmen.He was definitely very brazen.He was none other than a person who had intervened in the scheme tonight and distracted his own colleagues.Click, click!Cracks appeared in the night sky, and it seemed like the sky would strike down the next moment.As time passed, the right hand Ye Xiaotian had used to insert into the empty space grew stronger, and the breath of death enveloped the two men on the other side.The masked man lifted his head to look at the night sky. The falling raindrops were swallowed by the dark crack, unable to reach him.The masked man laughed gently, \u201cIf you strike, the nine others lying in ambush won\u2019t survive.\u201cWell, adding the one here, there are ten.\u201dBefore Xu Xiaoshou could feel astonished at this, the sound of several explosions below sent nine columns of sword energy up into the sky from the ground.Each sword energy was bound to a white-haired elder. Seeing the elders, who were hung by the sword energy, Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but recall Mo Mo in the arena of the final competition the other day.This scene looked exactly the same!Xu Xiaoshou looked at the masked man in surprise and recalled the remark he\u2019d made: \u201cYour path has been trodden by too many people.\u201d\u201cWhich means he\u2019s been on the path that I\u2019m taking now. But why does he advise me against taking the same path?\u201d he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very powerful.\u201d\u201cAll Things are Swords?\u201d he asked.\u201cYeah,\u201d the masked man nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the Innate Level All Things are Swords.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless, and he wondered why the masked man had emphasized the \u201cInnate Level.\u201d Did he think he hadn\u2019t belittled the others enough?The law enforcers on the ground, on the contrary, were so surprised that their jaws almost dropped to the ground when they saw the nine elders hung high up in the air by the sword energy.\u201cNine elders?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cHow could these elders be sneak-attacked by that masked man all at once? They are none other than the elders!\u201d\u201cThe nine throne level masters are being hung by the sword will alone. This is\u2026. Am I dreaming?\u201d\u201cThese nine elders are the oldest and most qualified in the Inner Yard, and are above the masters!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dumbfounded. \u2018Saint Servant\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cIs he really so powerful?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: The Value of Xu XiaoshouXu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes had been opened.It turned out that this was how the fairies fought each other.With great ease, the masked man had severely injured Xiao Qixiu with one strike of the sword and hung the nine elders in the air with his sword will. Because of the hostage situation, Ye Xiaotian was subdued.Stealing a glance at the nine elders hung in the air, Ye Xiaotian couldn\u2019t help but curse in a low voice, \u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of useless helpers!\u201dIn Elder Sang and Ye Xiaotian\u2019s original plans they\u2019d designed, these old guys weren\u2019t meant to be employed, but they\u2019d insisted on helping out in an attempt to prove the value of their existence.Did they really think it was a piece of cake to capture \u201cSaint Servant?\u201d\u201cClick, click!\u201dYe Xiaotian grew angrier. As a result, a large crack appeared in the space. Before the masked man could respond, Xu Xiaoshou hastened to say, \u201cDon\u2019t be so emotional. Impulse is the devil!\u201dYe Xiaotian: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe masked man: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe nine elders hung in the air looked rather ashamed, but they weren\u2019t very strong-willed by nature and were well-behaved. At the moment, they couldn\u2019t escape the masked man\u2019s long-distance control.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. \u2018Saint Servant\u2019 should be killed by all. Capture him and bring him to the Holy Divine Palace. Doing so will benefit all human beings!\u201d one of the elders said.Hearing this, the masked man\u2019s eyes turned cold. \u201cShould be killed by all? Do I know you? Did I kill your whole family?\u201dAs the masked man waved his hand, the sword energy came out from the endless rain droplets and passed through the body of the elder who\u2019d spoken, turning him into a bloody person.Ye Xiaotian\u2019s eyelids twitched.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Another elder became upset and said sternly, \u201cIf you\u2019re so powerful\u2026\u201d\u201cToo noisy!\u201dThe masked man turned his head toward the speaking elder. All of a sudden, the rain droplets turned into a sword and pierced through the elder, turning him into a second bloody person.Nobody dared to speak now. Besides the seven elders hung in the air, the law enforcers on the ground fell silent as well.There was a hint of mockery in the cloudy eyes of the masked man as he said slowly, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t fail to take care of the others.\u201dHe waved his hand one more time. The rainy swords whizzed in the sky, turning the remaining seven elders into bloody men.Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. This masked man really was brazen\u2026This was reckless! What he was doing was reckless!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Xiaotian couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and was about to act, but the masked man quickly spun his head around and took a step back.\u201cDon\u2019t be so emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cImpulse is the devil!\u201dAnd he added, \u201cI have ten hostages.\u201dYe Xiaotian: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe shot Xu Xiaoshou a stern look.Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. Why was he being stared at? He wasn\u2019t the attacker.More importantly, he couldn\u2019t act on impulse at the moment, Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself. The deaths of those old men weren\u2019t a big deal, and the masked man had allowed him to live this long, so he shouldn\u2019t die.Xu Xiaoshou wanted to complain again but chose to shut up instead when he recalled the masked man\u2019s comment that he was \u201ctoo noisy.\u201dThe masked man glanced at him and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re very interesting. You can speak.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou responded crossly. \u201cYou\u2019d better let me go, like a fart you keep holding in.\u201cYou masters are fighting each other. I\u2019m of no value to you.\u201dThe masked man patted his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t belittle yourself. Actually, you\u2019re quite valuable.\u201d\u201cPraised, passive point, +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou nearly went mad. He had no intention of getting involved, and he had no idea what value he had.He wanted to go back to sleep.And if he couldn\u2019t go back to sleep, he\u2019d like to go back to building his house.But here\u2026He looked down at Goose Lake, which, from this height, was but a dot.It was very high, cold, and scary up here.\u201cWhat on earth do you want?\u201d Ye Xiaotian stared at the masked man, trying his hardest to suppress his anger. He was afraid he might pull down a large patch of sky if he let his emotions get out of control.\u201cAll I want is to take an object. I\u2019ll leave afterward.\u201d\u201cNothing in the Spirit Palace belongs to you!\u201dThe masked man laughed. \u201cThe object I want will be mine.\u201dYe Xiaotian took a deep breath.The masked man raised up the young man in his hand. \u201cThis person is very interesting. Can you give him to me?\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt sick to his stomach.He wasn\u2019t an object! He was a person. He couldn\u2019t be given away.And he had no intention of leaving the Spirit Palace. He\u2019d just won the title of champion and hadn\u2019t left a legacy here yet.Ye Xiaotian glanced at the young man and said, \u201cI can give this person to you, but you have to let the other nine go, and you must promise that you won\u2019t come to the Tiansang Spirit Palace again.\u201dXu Xiaoshou: \u201c? ? ?\u201dThe look in the masked man\u2019s eyes seemed to suggest he was considering this offer.But before the masked man could respond, an angry swear echoed through the heavens and across the earth.\u201cYe Xiaotian, shut your d*mned mouth!\u201dAfter this remark, the sun seemed to become hotter, the rain stopped falling, and the empty space was warped.The accumulated water pools on the ground evaporated in the blink of an eye, and the forest path turned dry and cracked.The horrifying hot atmosphere surrounded the whole area, and the law enforcers around Goose Lake felt horrified, their foreheads breaking out in a cold, warm sweat.An old man holding a conical hat appeared in front of the three of them in the sky. His eyes ringed with dark circles were fixated on Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cElder Sang?\u201dExcept for Xu Xiaoshou, the other two men looked like they\u2019d expected this result.Ye Xiaotian imperceptibly rolled his eyeballs. This guy had finally been forced to come out.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me any more nonsense.\u201dElder Sang pointed at the young man in the hands of the masked man. \u201cThis person has to be given back to me. You can kill the nine others if you want to. After the killing, we can negotiate the next step.\u201dNine elders?Xu Xiaoshou was so moved that tears almost fell from his eyes.He\u2019d thought this old man had a strange, self-centered and desolate personality, but now he found his eyes ringed with dark circles rather amiable.What he\u2019d said was more decent and virtuous than what Ye Xiaotian had said.His stance was different from the Chief of the Inner Yard\u2019s. The Chief of the Inner Yard wanted to give the champion of the Outer Yard away.As Xu Xiaoshou thought about all this, he found that the masked man was holding him more tightly, and he heard a terrifying voice say, \u201cYou\u2019re valuable as I thought.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt his heart tremble. He shot Elder Sang a look that yelled \u201chelp me.\u201dElder Sang looked at Xu Xiaoshou and gave a familiar grin. \u201cRelax. As long as you have a breath left in you, this old man will save you.\u201dSeeing the grin, Xu Xiaoshou instinctively felt concerned. What did this old man have on his mind?Don\u2019t act too recklessly!The masked man retreated as he heard those words.\u201cWant to flee?\u201dThe corners of Elder Sang\u2019s curled up, and he reached out his hand. The retreating masked man stopped moving and started to tremble violently.\u201cInfernal Heavens?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s pupils shrank as he felt a hot energy flow into his own body through the body of the masked man.Boom!The hotness exploded inside his body, and then started to burn fiercely. The pain was one hundred times more painful than what he\u2019d experienced when cultivating the Infernal Fire Seed.\u201cCough, couch!\u201dIt felt like his throat was on fire. The blood in his mouth evaporated before he could even spit it out.His skin cracked, and the water in his body dried up. Xu Xiaoshou sensed that his life was rapidly leaving him, and his vision was going black.Was this the \u201cInfernal Heavens?\u201dThe \u201cBurning People Alive\u201d he employed seemed like mere house-play in comparison\u2026His consciousness grew blurrier and blurrier. In the end, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to hear the slightly panicked voice of the masked man say:\u201cI can give you the lad, but take back the fire!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Where Can One Get a Makeover?He felt himself thrown into the air once again, but this time he landed against a skinny bosom. It felt as if he\u2019d bumped into a skeleton.A magic pill with a strong medicinal flavor landed in his mouth and instantly melted. Xu Xiaoshou completely recovered from his injury.He opened his eyes, a cold sweat on his forehead, and discovered that he was in the bosom of Elder Sang.\u201cHaha, you rascal, this old man didn\u2019t lie to you. As I said, as long as you have a breath left in you, I\u2019ll save you.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt like punching him in the face. He\u2019d had one foot in h*ll just a moment earlier.Save him? More like almost let him get killed!If he\u2019d been a bit slower to act\u2026At that moment, the situation completely changed.The masked man, after throwing Xu Xiaoshou into the air, lost total control of the \u201cRestricting Sword Energy\u201d on the nine elders because of the effect of the \u201cInfernal Heavens.\u201dNobody missed this window of opportunity.\u201cDo it!\u201dThe nine white-haired old men freed themselves from the sword energy and flew away with a whizz. The spiritual source filled the air, causing a few cracks to appear in the empty space.As Elder Sang was giving the magical pill to Xu Xiaoshou, Ye Xiaotian pulled down a piece of space and smashed it at the masked man, no longer able to restrain himself.A large hole appeared in the sky, but it automatically repaired itself.Yet, in the brief moment that the hole was open, Xu Xiaoshou was nearly sucked in by the suction and might\u2019ve been finished if not for Elder Sang pulling him back.\u201cStop!\u201d Elder Sang shouted.Xu Xiaoshou was flabbergasted. Why was Elder Sang trying to stop the attack? This was obviously the best opportunity to attack together.And the power of the \u201cHand of Ripping Heaven\u201d\u2026Xu Xiaoshou swore that it was the most astounding spiritual technique he\u2019d ever witnessed.Nobody paid attention to Elder Sang. Ye Xiaotian\u2019s \u201cHand of Ripping Heaven\u201d had instantaneously appeared in front of the masked man and was bearing down on his head.Bah!The masked man leisurely stuck out one of his fingers. This time Xu Xiaoshou saw it clearly. It was indeed the Finger Blessed with Sword Will, but the move looked rather weak.Yet, the next moment, a flash of white light passed through the pierced space and through the figure of Ye Xiaotian.The expected spilling of blood didn\u2019t occur, as it was only Ye Xiaotian\u2019s afterimage.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe torn space struck down. The empty space turned completely into powders, and a large black hole appeared.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s jaw almost dropped to the ground. How could anyone survive this attack?It wasn\u2019t possible!He lifted his head and sensed that the masked man, who\u2019d been struck by the torn space, was also just an afterimage.A figure appeared in the sky before Ye Xiaotian could steady himself, and two fingers were thrust into his throat.\u201cWhoa!\u201dFresh blood poured out, reddening Ye Xiaotian\u2019s white hair. His eyes were full of astonishment.The masked man materialized in front of Ye Xiaotian and jeered, \u201cYour spatial quality isn\u2019t bad, but your fighting will is a bit weak. I guessed it would be\u2026\u201dThe masked man twisted Ye Xiaotian\u2019s arms behind his back and looked down at the nine elders below. \u201cIf you do anything, he dies,\u201d he said coldly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d one of the elders began, but the masked man ran his two fingers across and one of Ye Xiaotian\u2019s arms fell off into the empty space.\u201cThe same will happen to the speaker.\u201dIt was deadly quiet!At that moment, time seemed to freeze. Nobody dared to breathe loudly, let alone speak. They were all afraid that the Tiansang Spirit Palace would lose its Chief of the Inner Yard if they made a wrong move.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes were full of terror. He tightly clenched his fists, feeling his blood boil.Perhaps this man was indeed a member of an evil organization. However, he\u2019d never witnessed a swordsman suppress a whole arena all on his own before until now.Cultivation master, for him at the moment, was the highest level for cultivation.But he was certain that none of the nine elders was below the Master Level.Including Xiao Qixiu, who had lost the ability to fight, and Ye Xiaotian, who was a hostage at the moment, and Elder Sang, who was holding him, Xu Xiaoshou believed their cultivation levels were certainly higher than Master Level.Yet, all these cultivators together couldn\u2019t even graze the masked man.He was a true swordsman, and indeed reckless!As long as one achieved a high cultivation level, one could definitely enter any inner yard and care less about assassination attempts from the innateness. They would all be rubbish\u2026\u201cPah!\u201dElder Sang slapped Xu Xiaoshou on the head, making him snap out of his dizziness.\u201cWhat are you thinking at such a young age?\u201cDon\u2019t learn from such a person, who will die earlier than the others!\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201dHe uttered an \u201coh\u201d before falling silent, but he had a vague dea brewing in his head.Elder Sang sighed. He was fully aware of what this young man had on his mind.Looking at the masked man, Elder Sang fell silent as well.He was indeed someone who had dominated an era. Therefore, his reappearance had attracted others\u2019 admiration.\u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t you who\u2019d come tonight,\u201d Elder Sang said.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, you would have already caught the person,\u201d the masked man looked at Elder Sang.Elder Sang sighed, \u201cYou take your leave, and I won\u2019t stop you.\u201dThe nine elders were upset, but they couldn\u2019t utter a single word when they saw Ye Xiaotian in pain.Well, what could they do if they didn\u2019t let him go?The Tiansang Spirit Palace was quite big, but not enough.All the members of the palace had come out in order to capture the masked man. The foundation of the palace would be harmed if they kept on fighting.It was evident that the masked man had no intention of leaving. While holding Ye Xiaotian he said, \u201cI just want to take an object. I won\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d\u201cWith this old man here, you won\u2019t be able to take away a blade of grass from the Tiansang Spirit Palace, let alone a sword.\u201d Elder Sang was furious.Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that the masked man wanted to take a sword.What kind of sword was worth the protection from all of the Tiansang Spirit Palace?Xu Xiaoshou was curious, but it was obvious that he couldn\u2019t ask. He knew very well that he shouldn\u2019t joke around in such a serious situation.The masked man flashed a grin. \u201cDo you think you can guard it all the time?\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Elder Sang was so angry that the conical hat over his head seemed to raise up. \u201cThe Tiansang Spirit Palace is my second home. Where would I be but here to guard it?\u201dXu Xiaoshou wanted to ask where his first home was, but he thought better of it and reminded himself that he shouldn\u2019t behave too impishly.The masked man didn\u2019t respond. Then, he suddenly turned to Xu Xiaoshou and said, \u201cGive this lad to me, and I\u2019ll leave without looking back.\u201dXu Xiaoshou: \u201c? ? ?\u201d\u201cD*mn,\u201d he thought. \u201cDidn\u2019t you come here for the sword? So why are you focused on me?\u201cIs this world sick? Everybody focuses on me.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m so outstanding.\u201dElder Sang became furious, as if he\u2019d been rubbed the wrong way. \u201cYou must have a death wish!\u201dIn a split second, the air filled with white smoke, and the empty space warped, as if it were being burned by scorching temperatures.\u201cHahaha!\u201dThe masked man\u2019s laughter alone was very eerie, but coupled with his hoarse voice, the sound could torture one\u2019s soul.\u201cYou\u2019re Wen Ming, right? Wait for me. I\u2019ll be back for you.\u201d The masked man broke through the empty space with his two fingers and disappeared without a trace.Wen Ming?Xu Xiaoshou was startled for a second and then madly nodded his head.\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d he thought.\u201cMy name is Wen Ming, and you must come back to find me!\u201cThe name is also the code. You must remember it right and don\u2019t forget it!\u201d\u201cEven though your name is not the correct one,\u201d the masked man said, \u201cI will remember your face\u2026\u201dAs his voice gradually faded away, Xu Xiaoshou found himself in a daze.\u201cD*mn it!\u201d he thought.\u201cWhy do you also have to remember my face? Just remember my name.\u201d\u201cWho is Wen Ming?\u201d Elder Sang asked with lowered head as he watched the masked man disappear into the horizon.\u201cThat isn\u2019t important!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou wildly waved his hands and hastily said, \u201cWhere can one get a makeover? I\u2019ll be back.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: 81The skies gradually cleared.The rain had stopped some time ago.It might have ceased because of Elder Sang\u2019s Infernal Heavens, which had vaporized the storm clouds entirely, or because of the gaping black hole that Ye Xiaotian had ripped in the skies, devouring everything in sight.Regardless of what they had done, no one could stop the masked stranger from leaving if the latter desired so.The nine founding elders felt slightly disheartened. They had done little tonight.They\u2019d been of no help to anyone but the masked figure, who had used them to keep Ye Xiaotian in check. They\u2019d only contributed the rain and a little sprinkle of their own blood to the fight.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten old.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re old. We can\u2019t deny the truth.\u201dThey sighed heavily. The extent of their injuries was something that they could handle on their own.They immediately departed, vanishing without a trace, knowing very well that prolonging their presence at Goose Lake would only bring them further embarrassment.Just as Ye Xiaotian had predicted, these old fellows were long past the age for battle.Their place was behind the scenes, issuing orders that might be slightly obsolete and not in keeping with the times.Let the new generation of leaders in the Spirit Palace unleash their abilities and prove themselves.The dean of the Inner Yard and representative of the Spirit Palace\u2019s leadership, Ye Xiaotian, held onto his broken arm as he landed on the banks of Goose Lake. Elder Sang grabbed Xu Xiaoshou by the collar and landed on the banks as well.\u201cDean!\u201d\u201cVice Dean!\u201dThe law enforcers around them appeared nervous as they greeted Ye Xiaotian and Elder Sang with the utmost deference.Their greetings startled Xu Xiaoshou.Vice Dean?Elder Sang was a vice dean?He searched his mind, and after piecing together the fragmented memories inside his head, he finally made a connection between them and the old man next to him.He had heard rumors of a vice dean in the Spirit Palace who was away from the palace most of the time and hardly drew anyone\u2019s attention at all.If it weren\u2019t for people mentioning him, no one would\u2019ve remembered that he existed.But it would\u2019ve been impossible for anyone to completely forget that he existed.After all, the Tiansang Spirit Palace had been named after its two founders.The \u201ctian\u201d in Tiansang had been taken from Ye Xiaotian\u2019s name and 'sang\u201d from Elder Sang.In addition, the Outer Yard hosted Windcloud Competition annually at the Chuyun Platform.How had the Chuyun Platform been formed?During the construction of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Vice Dean and Elder Sang had cast Chuyun Peak in fire, melted down half of the peak, and forged a platform that could seat ten thousand people.Grab any Outer Yard disciple, and he or she would be able to recite this tale from heart.\u201cSo he\u2019s the one\u2026\u201dThings had finally clicked.Elder Sang\u2019s eccentric personality had prevented Xu Xiaoshou from piecing everything together sooner.That old man hadn\u2019t displayed the slightest semblance of a man of stature and rank at all.He was an eccentric loner who always did whatever he wanted, getting up to strange and bizarre antics and flagrantly flouting the rules.This could be seen from the way he had forced the Infernal Fire Seed down Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s throat and how he had chosen to attack despite the predicament his allies were in.Xu Xiaoshou recalled the scorching heat that he had experienced at the beginning of the advancement round during the Windcloud Competition and how he had barged into the arena to beg Xiao Qixiu for aid.When the judge had realized that Elder Sang had been the one who had caused Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s predicament, he had appeared reluctant to interfere with the matter, as if he couldn\u2019t afford to offend Elder Sang.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I should\u2019ve realized it sooner.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt distressed. How could this old man be a vice dean?Hold on a second.He should look at it another way\u2014the man was stuck being a vice dean and nothing more because of his personality!Xu Xiaoshou observed the look in the law enforcers\u2019 eyes. Despite Ye Xiaotian\u2019s broken arm, he continued to garner looks of respect.As for Elder Sang\u2026No one dared to look at him at all.The few who dared to sneak a look at him were the younger ones, and their eyes were full of fear.Respect?There wasn\u2019t the slightest hint of it in their eyes.Xiao Qixiu was still resting among the others. The sword had pierced right through him, and he had sustained quite a serious injury from that attack.Xu Xiaoshou had never seen him in such a bad state before.In the past, his impression of Xiao Qixiu was that he was a free-spirited deity adrift in the heavens. Yet, when the fight had broken out\u2026He had completely overturned Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s impression of him.Xu Xiaoshou had caught the look in his eyes when the middle-aged man had been severely injured. Instead of showing weakness, his eyes had gleamed with a strange excitement.\u201cIs he a masochist?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself.Xiao Qixiu got to his feet. Before he could say a word, Elder Sang cut him off with a wave of his arm. \u201cYou may all go now!\u201dThe eyes of every law enforcer fell upon Xiao Qixiu. He waved his arm.\u201cGo!\u201dWhoosh.An area that had been slightly dim became bright and spacious once more as hundreds of men instantly vanished in shockingly simultaneous concert.The sight of such pure efficiency left Xu Xiaoshou in awe.He hurriedly bailed as well.While not as swift as the law enforcers, he wasn\u2019t slow.Elder Sang nearly rolled his eyes when he caught Xu Xiaoshou sneaking off. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201dUpon hearing the exasperated voice from behind him, Xu Xiaoshou felt the vice dean\u2019s grip clamp around his throat and yank him back to where he\u2019d been standing.He stared at the three powerful men before him and felt his legs go weak.Before him stood the Chief Elder of the Spiritual Law Division and the Dean and Vice Dean of the Inner Yard.He had a feeling that he didn\u2019t deserve to be in the same space as these three while they were talking.\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to leave?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou asked meekly. \u201cI\u2019m in a rush. I have to rebuild my house.\u201dThe other three men were silent.\u201cRebuild his house?\u201d they thought.\u201cThe Spirit Palace just survived a crisis, and the first thing he wants to do now that the crisis is over is rebuild his house?\u201d\u201cDid you kill someone?\u201d Xiao Qixiu immediately asked when he realized that Xu Xiaoshou had been dragged back.Xu Xiaoshou panicked.This was why he had tried to run. This was what he had feared!The Outer Yard had rules. One shall not kill their own. He had a feeling that those two fellows had come from the Inner Yard and not the Outer Yard, but that didn\u2019t matter. He was just a nobody from the Outer Yard, after all.The Spiritual Law Division could have him executed for murder!\u201cActually, it\u2019s the masked figure.\u201dXiao Qixiu mercilessly cut him off before he could finish his sentence. \u201cI staked out the entire night. Do you think I\u2019m blind?\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s face fell. \u201cThey tried to kill me first!\u201d\u201cI have no idea what I did to offend them. They were going to kill me. I couldn\u2019t just stand there and do nothing!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019d been watching the whole time, shouldn\u2019t you have shown yourself sooner and stopped them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s two human lives we\u2019re talking about, after all.\u201dXiao Qixiu was dumbfounded.What was going on here?The young man had killed someone. Why was he acting as if he were the one who had just undergone a hardship?Sensing that there appeared to be wiggle room, Xu Xiaoshou added, \u201cI killed in self-defense. I shouldn\u2019t be punished for that.\u201dXiao Qixiu could feel a headache coming on. He gave Elder Sang a look. The message was clear. Elder Sang had given the orders. He should deal with this.Elder Sang smacked Xu Xiaoshou on the head with his palm. \u201cWell done!\u201dWhat did he just say?Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t the only one who was baffled. Similar looks of bewilderment appeared on the faces of the other two men present.The look on Ye Xiaotian\u2019s face darkened. He was the dean of the Inner Yard. How could Elder Sang praise an Outer Yard disciple for killing Inner Yard disciples when he was standing right there?Elder Sang seemed oblivious to the stormy look on Ye Xiaotian\u2019s face and went on talking.\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you. We set this whole thing up a few days ago when I returned to the Spirit Palace.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the people who tried to kill you were two nobodies from the Inner Yard or someone with a higher office. No one would have saved you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the truth. Even I couldn\u2019t have done anything that would\u2019ve affected the plan.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m very glad that you managed to kill those two fellows.\u201dElder Sang\u2019s eyes glimmered brightly. The look of unconcealed approval shot straight to Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019d hoped that you would.\u201dXu Xiaoshou did not say a word. The guesses he\u2019d come up with after finding out about the plan had been right.Did he resent them for what they\u2019d done?Of course.Anyone who had just realized that he or she had been marked as an easy sacrificial pawn naturally would\u2019ve felt resentment upon this discovery.But when he thought about it from another angle, he realized that no one alive would\u2019ve chosen to ruin the greater plan for a small fight between a few insignificant disciples. In fact, he should be grateful that he hadn\u2019t been killed for creating unnecessary trouble.There was really no reasonable cause for anger.He had not warranted sufficient regard because the power that he possessed didn\u2019t command such respect.The same rule applied in this world as it had in others.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: Let Me Tell You a StoryThat was the kind of man Elder Sang was. If he didn\u2019t approve of you, he couldn\u2019t care less if you lived or died.But if he did approve of you, he would regard you as a precious treasure, and he wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to take you away from him.In his eyes, therein lay the difference in worth between the nine founding elders and Xu Xiaoshou\u2026They were worlds apart.He eyed the silent young man, then turned to Xiao Qixiu with his straw hat in hand. \u201cOur plan to capture the masked figure tonight failed. We underestimated his strength. He killed two Inner Yard disciples before escaping with ease.\u201dAfter a slight pause, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll announce to the others.\u201dXiao Qixiu was stupefied. He gave Ye Xiaotian a look.Ye Xiaotian was staring at Elder Sang in astonishment. It appeared that he was still in shock from the old man\u2019s bewildering antics.Elder Sang grinned cheekily. \u201cIf you still want that arm of yours, you should nod and agree.\u201dYe Xiaotian remained silent.He clutched his broken arm. The wound had stopped bleeding, but without an accomplished alchemist, it might not heal. Ye Xiaotian sank into deep contemplation.A long moment later, Xu Xiaoshou watched as the snowy-haired child hovering in midair nodded lightly.\u201cAlright.\u201dXiao Qixiu nodded sullenly as well.Xu Xiaoshou was flabbergasted. The Chief Elder of the Spiritual Law Division, who was renowned for his impartiality, had given in because of a few words from the Elder Sang?Was this the power that authority and status granted?He could die from sheer happiness!Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed when he realized that they were simply going to let go of the fact that he\u2019d killed someone tonight.It made sense. He would\u2019ve had grounds for an argument if it had come to that.Of course, he\u2019d rather avoid having to go through the trouble of doing that in the first place. No sane person would want to be tried by the Spiritual Law Division!Xiao Qixiu didn\u2019t allow his attention to linger on such a small matter. His eyes started to glimmer with a familiar excitement as he stared at Elder Sang.\u201cSo\u2026\u201cAbout that masked figure\u2026\u201dElder Sang eyed the tender skin that had regrown on Xiao Qixiu\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a taste, haven\u2019t you? Why do you ask when you already know the answer?\u201d\u201cIs it really him?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201dThe two men were speaking in riddles and confusing Xu Xiaoshou. His curiosity was piqued. \u201cWho is he?\u201dThree pairs of piercing eyes turned to stare at him, and Xu Xiaoshou slowly inched away from the trio.\u201cYou\u2019re the ones who told me to stay. Sure, keep your gossip to yourself. But why are you ostracizing me\u2026\u201d he protested weakly.The other three men were baffled. What gossip?Elder Sang patted Xu Xiaoshou on the shoulder. \u201cFocus on your cultivation. This isn\u2019t something you should get yourself involved in right now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThat only served to amplify his curiosity. Who was this masked figure?He was obviously a swordsman who had once tried to battle purely with his Sword Will. But\u2026Xu Xiaoshou recalled what the swordsman had said at first. His words of advice had seemed earnest. The journey to battle purely with one\u2019s Sword Will appeared to end in a dead-end.Yet, how could a dead end give one such power?He had taken on the whole Tiansang Spirit Palace alone.Xu Xiaoshou felt an unbearable itch niggling at him. The key to unlocking the puzzle that was confounding him was right in front of him. But no one was willing to let him have it.D*mnit!\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201dElder Sang shook his head and gazed heavenward. The skies had brightened. The air was crisp after the rain.Xiao Qixiu took his leave. Ye Xiaotian wouldn\u2019t stop staring at Xu Xiaoshou. Xu Xiaoshou had no clue why he was looking at him like that.From the air, his childlike voice chimed, \u201cYou are the current champion of the Windcloud Competition.\u201dXu Xiaoshou nodded dumbly. He didn\u2019t know what Ye Xiaotian wanted from him.\u201cYou may join the Inner Yard.\u201dWhat?What was going on?He\u2019d fought tooth and nail and had even gone to h*ll and back to earn himself a place in the Inner Yard, yet failed. Now it turned out all he\u2019d needed to get in was a few words from Ye Xiaotian?Elder Sang rolled his eyes and gave Ye Xiaotian a loud smack on the head. The snowy-haired child glared at him sullenly.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Tell those old geezers that Xu Xiaoshou doesn\u2019t need to join the Inner Yard!\u201d\u201cBut I do!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou moaned inwardly. He was still a little confused though, so he decided to hold his tongue and watch how things played out.The snowy-haired child simply glared at Elder Sang, then left.He left\u2026He simply upped and left\u2026Xu Xiaoshou staggered backward. What did that mean? Did he have a place in the Inner Yard or not?Couldn\u2019t someone just give him a straight answer?The uncertainty was driving him nuts!\u201cYe Xiaotian, be more decisive in the future. How many times have I told you? Never hesitate to break things off when you have to!\u201d Elder Sang hollered at the snowy-haired child as the latter flew away.As a reminder to Elder Sang to not forget about treating his arm, Ye Xiaotian waved the severed limb in the air before disappearing into the distance.Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his gaze. It was then that he realized he was now alone with Elder Sang.He could feel a headache coming on.He was at Goose Lake. With this old geezer. Again.Memories of pain and suffering came flooding back once more.\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll be on my way, then,\u201d he said tentatively.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave yet.\u201dThe creepy smile that usually graced Elder Sang\u2019s face vanished without a trace and was replaced by a solemn look. \u201cLet me tell you a story.\u201dHe walked away. Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and suppressed his terrible urge to run away, then jogged toward the old man.\u201cThe Shengshen Continent is divided into five regions. In the remote central region, the Holy Divine Land, lies the Holy Palace, the holy land for all alchemists in the continent,\u201d said Elder Sang with his hands folded behind his back and a faraway look in his eyes.Xu Xiaoshou nodded. All he knew was that the land that he was standing upon belonged to the eastern region, the Holy Sword Land. A significant number of swordsmen resided in the Holy Sword Land.He knew little about the other four regions of the continent.In fact, he\u2019d never heard of the Holy Palace.\u201cIn the Holy Palace lies a lake. It looks like the Goose Lake before us, but is three times its size.\u201dElder Sang pointed at the Goose Lake that lay beyond the snowy jade rails. A significant share of its waters had been turned into vapor. He said slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Greater Goose Lake.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cThere was a young lad who often appeared at the banks of the Greater Goose Lake. He was around your age, and he enjoyed training next to the lake because it was tranquil and quiet.\u201cOne day, he attained Innate Level Physique.\u201dXu Xiaoshou froze in his tracks. He stared at the silhouette of the old man and his straw hat. A piece of the puzzle was slowly shifting into place.\u201cThe young lad was overjoyed. Not long after that, on a particular night, an old geezer appeared and forced an Infernal Fire Seed down his throat.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The young man resisted eating the seed then.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s face darkened. Was the old man talking about him?Had the old geezer been force-fed an Infernal Fire Seed when he was a young man? Was that why he\u2019d done the same thing to Xu Xiaoshou? As some misguised attempt at vengenance?Xu Xiaoshou continued listening as Elder Sang told his story.\u201cA month later, the young lad\u2019s Innate Level Physique was scorched to the core and ruined beyond repair.\u201cThe old geezer appeared once again and fed him another Infernal Fire Seed. He gave the young lad a third Infernal Fire Seed and the manual to a technique.\u201d\u201cWas it the Infernal Heavens?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists. That young man had been put through a great deal more hardship than Xu Xiaoshou had. He\u2019d been fed another Infernal Fire Seed after his Innate Level Physique had been irreparably damaged. That must have eventually killed him!\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Elder Sang nodded. \u201cThe old geezer said to the young lad, \u2018Do you hate me? If you do, then master this technique so that you can defeat me.\u2019\u201cThe young lad had no other choice. With hatred burning in his heart, he began practicing the technique. He poured everything he had into it. Within a year, he regained his Innate Level Physique.\u201cAfter another three days, he advanced to the Master Stage!\u201d\u201cThat was when he realized that he had shattered the myth that had persisted throughout the continent, the myth that an Innate Level Physique couldn\u2019t break through to the Master Stage.\u201cIt\u2019d taken him only a year to do that.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s jaw dropped. He hadn\u2019t expected the story to unfold in this manner.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: 83\u201cThe end of the story was completely beyond what the young lad had expected. But at that point, even an idiot would have learned something from it.Sang paused momentarily before adding, \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t an idiot. In fact, he was incredibly smart. He was the smartest person that had ever been and would ever be.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.The old man was shameless!\u201cIt was then that the old geezer appeared again.\u201cThe young lad asked him\u2026\u201dSang turned and gave Xu Xiaoshou a look. \u201cWhat do you think he asked him?\u201dXu Xiaoshou scratched his head before looking Sang in the eye. \u201cWhy do you have such dark eyebags?\u201dSang froze momentarily.Then, he blew up.He gave the young man a hard smack on the head. \u201cBe serious!\u201d\u201cBut I am\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say, but he swallowed the words instead. He wasn\u2019t going to joke around. His life was precious.\u201cWhy did you force feed me the Infernal Fire Seed?\u201d he asked.Sang raised one finger. \u201cThat\u2019s the first question.\u201cThe old geezer said he did it because he enjoyed doing it.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyelids twitched, and he suppressed his sudden urge to beat the old man up.He wasn\u2019t the old man\u2019s match. He shouldn\u2019t even try.Sang raised a second finger.Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was the old man\u2019s eccentric way of getting him to ask questions. He stopped asking questions like he were the young lad in the story and instead voiced his own.\u201cDid it ever cross that ugly d*mn geezer\u2019s mind that maybe no one wanted the fortuitous opportunity he was granting and the pain and suffering that came with it?\u201dSang\u2019s lips twitched. They were alone right now. What was the point of throwing shade at him when there was no audience to appreciate the subtlety of his jabs?\u201cMind those unnecessary adjectives of yours!\u201d he scoffed unhappily.\u201cThe old geezer said that men who have no ambition or will to better themselves belong in the secular world. Only those who desire to improve themselves will end up at the Holy Palace.\u201cYou already knew the answer to that question.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was ready to retort when Sang cut him off. \u201cThe young lad agreed. If given another chance, he might have chosen to take the Infernal Fire Seed anyway. But the thought of the pain that he would have to suffer\u2026\u201cWithout the thirst for vengeance, he might not have suffered the process during which his Innate Level Physique was destroyed and then rebuilt, and his subsequent advance to the Master stage.\u201dSang gave Xu Xiaoshou a deliberate look, which only served to baffle Xu Xiaoshou.What was the meaning of this?The old man wouldn\u2019t let him speak, wouldn\u2019t let him ask any questions, and was now putting words into his mouth.He suspected that the old man was trying to brainwash him, and he had the evidence to prove it.But he did kind of grudgingly agree with what the old man said at the end though\u2026Hold on a second.That wasn\u2019t right.The brainwashing had nearly worked!Xu Xiaoshou leveled a murderous glare at the old man to express his disgruntlement.\u201cOne last question.\u201d Sang raised a third finger.The last one?He would have to make it count\u2026Xu Xiaoshou thought for a long moment before slowly saying, \u201cWho was the masked figure?\u201dHis eyes were filled with curiosity.A vein throbbed visibly on Sang\u2019s forehead. He was barely holding himself back.There was something seriously wrong with this young man!He wondered, suddenly, if he had chosen the wrong man.\u201cStop fooling around!\u201d\u201cErm.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou got serious. \u201cWhy me?\u201dSang smoothened his sparse eyebrow and nodded with satisfaction. \u201cNow, that\u2019s the kind of question a normal person would ask.\u201dA solemn expression settled on his face. \u201cI need to be honest with you. The Infernal Heavens is known for having stripped a man of his Innate Level Physique.\u201cWhat it\u2019s not known for is its death count, which has exceeded a hundred deaths.\u201dThe look on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face implied that he\u2019d expected that. Sang hadn\u2019t expected this reaction, and continued talking.\u201cI\u2019ve tried it on a dozen others before you came along. They were prodigies who weren\u2019t from the Spirit Palace. All of them died.\u201cI didn\u2019t harbor much hope for you at first. I was simply giving it a shot. After all, what\u2019s the worst that could happen, I thought.\u201d\u201cAnother man dead. That\u2019s all.\u201dHe glanced at Xu Xiaoshou and caught the look of composure on the young man\u2019s face. He had no idea if the young man was putting up an act.Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t feigning composure. He had gotten used to Sang\u2019s antics. He would\u2019ve been surprised if Sang had said he cared for a nobody he\u2019d never met before.In fact, the old geezer had spoken the truth, which was more than he\u2019d expected from him.\u201cBack to the story,\u201d Sang said. \u201cThe young lad asked the same question. The old geezer replied the same way I did, and more.\u201dAs he went on, he seemed to assume the mannerisms of the character in his story.\u201cThe world is an enormous cage, and everyone is seeking freedom.\u201cEveryone begins as a nobody. When you\u2019re insignificant and small, no one sees the potential in you.\u201cYou strive hard and reach a certain level in life. That is when others discover your potential. But you are still not free then.\u201cYou are still a pawn, a tool that others use to pursue their own freedom. Your life rests in the hands of the person who discovered your potential, not your own.\u201dHe pointed at Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cThat\u2019s who you are right now.\u201dXu Xiaoshou understood what Sang was trying to tell him. The old man went on talking.\u201cYou continue to strive hard and finally free yourself from the shackles of being a pawn. You earn the right to pursue your own freedom. You cultivate and groom your own pawns and successfully unlock the door to the enormous cage.\u201cYou walk out of that world and discover the skies beyond the cage. You think this is freedom. The next moment, you realize that this is just a larger cage.\u201dHe pointed at Goose Lake. The surface of the lake was as smooth as a mirror. Within it was the reflection of the blue skies dappled with white clouds. The calm lake seemed to have taken on a strange quality.\u201cYou\u2019re still trapped. How do you break out?\u201dXu Xiaoshou squatted momentarily, then stood up. A pebble landed in the lake, instantly shattering the pristine skies. \u201cIt\u2019s broken now, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSang was speechless.He had to control himself.He must!\u201cAlright. You\u2019re out now. You look up and see the real sky\u2026\u201d Sang jerked Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s stubborn head upward. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the real sky right now. How do you break out?\u201cEven if you do, you\u2019ll just be greeted with another layer of sky.\u201dXu Xiaoshou nearly choked. It felt terrible. He barely got his words out. \u201cNo infinite regressions allowed!\u201dSang paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cErm, nothing.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou yanked his head down again. He asked confusedly, \u201cYou talk a lot. What are you trying to tell me?\u201dSang clutched Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s head and said slowly, \u201cThat\u2019s just how the world is. It\u2019s filled with malice and danger. You\u2019ll see when you leave the Spirit Palace.\u201cOf those who discover your potential, not every one of them will use you well. You may end up being sacrificed, like the others whom I\u2019ve tested.\u201cThat\u2019s why you should play your part dutifully and be a good pawn when you\u2019ve not yet acquired true and complete power.\u201cAt the very least, you should make sure these folks who discover your potential view you as just a pawn!\u201dXu Xiaoshou froze. Honestly, he seemed to understand what the old man was saying, yet at the same time, he didn\u2019t.He\u2019d already known how terrible the world could be. But the old man had spoken of its dangers as infinite layers of regressions, which was something that he hadn\u2019t yet experienced personally\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll break out of every one of those cages,\u201d he said earnestly.Sang smiled. The wrinkled creases on his face unfolded like the many petals of a blossoming flower. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said then too\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou looked up. \u201cSo you\u2019re the young lad in the story. Is the ugly old geezer your master?\u201dSlap!Sang smacked him again.\u201cWhat ugly old geezer are you talking about?\u201cThat\u2019s your grandmaster you\u2019re talking about!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was dumbstruck.\u201cAt the end of the story, the old geezer said, \u2018I\u2019ve taught you the first lesson. Do you wish to take me as your master?\u2019\u201dSang pulled himself out of his memories and repeated himself. \u201cDo you wish to take me as your master?\u201d\u201cAre you going to be nice to me?\u201d A pitiful look instantly appeared on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face.Sang was rendered speechless.This was hardly the time to fool around!The young man before him fell to his knees before he could yell at him.\u201cMaster, please allow your disciple to pay his respect!\u201dXu Xiaoshou might have harbored some resentment towards the old man in the past, but those sentiments had vanished without a trace after he discovered that mastering the Infernal Heavens required his physical form to be destroyed and then rebuilt.Besides, without Sang\u2019s intervention tonight, he would have ended up being cast aside by Ye Xiaotian or kidnapped by the masked figure.Sang might be a terrifying and eccentric loner, but he had shown genuine concern during his attempt to rescue Xu Xiaoshou. He couldn\u2019t have feigned that.In any case, Sang had made his intentions extremely clear. Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t exactly have a choice.He didn\u2019t receive a response for a long time. When he looked up, it was to the sight of an old face under the brim of a straw hat, all scrunched up, and to eyes that seemed to gleam and ripple with tears.Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily dazed.Behind the old man was the sun, which was steadily rising over the eastern horizon, and with it, a spill of violet light.A tiny stream of faint light fell over the silent old man and youth.Goose Lake stirred awake as the new day dawned. The wind arrived, stirring cicadas and geese into song, streaming down fissures in a wounded earth and brushing against fallen bodies of weeping willows. From a ravaged land blossomed hope for new life.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Got No ConnectionsIn the Inner Yard.Inside one of its residences.Slam!With a hard smack, Zhang Xinxiong sent a flagon to the floor, shattering it into many shards of silver and jade. The fragrance of wine instantly filled the air.He stared furiously at the woman before him. \u201cI told you. The men you sent were supposed to simply keep an eye on Xu Xiaoshou. Look at what happened. Look at what you\u2019ve done.\u201cThey tried to kill him. Alright. I was fine with that. They couldn\u2019t kill him. Fine. They couldn\u2019t escape. Still fine. But did you have to choose that particular time to kill him\u2026\u201cDid you have to attempt an assassination while everyone was watching?\u201cYou might as well have served those men\u2019s heads up on a platter!\u201cDo you really have a functioning brain at all?\u201dLan Xinzi\u2019s strapless dress left her lovely, fair shoulders bare.She proudly stuck her chest out in the face of the man\u2019s furious yelling, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t!\u201dZhang Xinxiong was momentarily rendered speechless.Lan Xinzi eyed the shattered remains of her flagon with a sorrowful look. The flagon had arrived at her residence after a journey through the night. And now, after barely existing for a day, it had met its untimely end at the hands of Zhang Xinxiong.The man probably had no clue that the last flagon had been replaced with a new one.\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d asked Zhang Xinxiong after he\u2019d calmed down. What was done was done. There was nothing to be done about it.\u201cWe didn\u2019t kill him the last time, so we\u2019ll just have to keep trying, I guess.\u201cYour father was the one who assigned this mission. Let me do the job if you\u2019re not interested in getting it done.\u201cBesides, I\u2019m in a foul mood. Killing someone will cheer me up. Everything will work out.\u201d Lan Xinzi didn\u2019t seem to care much about the mission at all.\u201cYou\u2026\u201cWomen!\u201dLan Xinzi was driving Zhang Xinxiong up the wall. She must have been dropped on the head as a child!Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t keep himself cooped up in the Spirit Palace forever.She could have bided her time and waited for him to leave the Spirit Palace. It would have been a piece of cake to have him killed then. Why was she trying to sabotage herself?She had instructed an Inner Yard disciple to kill an Outer Yard disciple. She wasn\u2019t going to be let off easily if the Spiritual Law Division found out about her involvement.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare make another move. Do that and you can forget about ever leaving this house,\u201d threatened Zhang Xinxiong fiercely.Lan Xinzi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cAre you going to imprison me?\u201dZhang Xinxiong was speechless.She was driving him crazy. He thundered, \u201cMake a move and I\u2019ll make sure you never walk again!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThe doors of the residence slid open. A quiet voice drifted in.\u201cDo that and I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t walk again.\u201dZhang Xinxiong turned around. In strode a man with a well-proportioned build and a sword hanging from his waist. His dark unfeeling eyes stared out from beneath a pair of arched eyebrows.\u201cHe Yuxing?\u201dIt dawned on Zhang Xinxiong instantly. \u201cYou were the one who gave Feng Kong his orders.\u201dHe Yuxing nodded.Zhang Xinxiong scoffed and pointed at Lan Xinzi. Derision dripped heavily from his words. \u201cDo you simply do whatever she tells you to? Can\u2019t you think for yourself?\u201d\u201cI like it,\u201d He Yuxing said coolly. His eyes fell on Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s finger. \u201cPut that down or you\u2019ll lose it in a second.\u201dBoom!Zhang Xinxiong instantly blew up. He appeared perfectly still as the floor beneath his feet abruptly sank. A crack appeared in the ground, and the dark jagged line lengthened rapidly as it sped toward the man standing in the doorway.Ping!He Yuxing placed his sword lightly on the ground. The growing fissure splintered into two, branching off sideways instead.With a loud explosion, the towering walls on both sides of the house collapsed, and shattered rocks fell through the crevices in the ground while clouds of dust rose everywhere.Cough! Cough!A sudden hacking cough resounded in the air. Zhang Xinxiong, He Yuxing, and Lan Xinzi turned their eyes toward the collapsed wall and were greeted with the sight of a man dressed in black, squatting on the wall.He was chewing on a blade of leaf and had one hand placed lightly over his mouth and nose. The look in his eyes was that of impudence.\u201cYoung Master Zhang, He the Crazed, the Fair Maiden Lan\u2026you\u2019re all here!\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll need all of you to make a trip to the Spiritual Law Division with me.\u201dThe trio was startled. That was quick. It hadn\u2019t taken the law enforcers much time to come knocking on their door.They were displaying extraordinary efficiency this time.\u201cZhao Xidong, what is the meaning of this?\u201d Zhang Xinxiong frowned.\u201cHah!\u201d Zhao Xidong spat the leaf in his mouth out and snorted.\u201cI\u2019m quite sure you know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t your first time facing trial. If you want to do something bad, either make sure you don\u2019t get caught or don\u2019t even bother hiding the fact that you did it in the first place.\u201dThe mention of a trial made looks of alarm appear on the trio\u2019s faces. Zhang Xinxiong tried to feign composure while protesting his ignorance. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cHah!\u201d Zhao Xidong looked away and laughed. He didn\u2019t attempt to hide the derision in his voice at all. The image of that bizarre young man appeared in his head.As a graduate of the Inner Yard and the former leader of its thirty-three disciples, this was the first time he\u2019d properly donned his judge\u2019s uniform since his graduation and the first time he\u2019d made up his mind to do his job as he should.He had been assigned to arena number 12 during the Outer Yard\u2019s Windcloud Competition, which was where his nightmare had begun.The first round of the competition had been all right. Besides being utterly bored all the time, he hadn\u2019t had much trouble.During the preliminaries, he\u2019d made history by becoming the judge to witness the first historic death in the Windcloud Competition.He\u2019d just stepped out of the Tribunal mere moments ago\u2026The thought of the Tribunal sent shivers down his spine.The sudden chill made him recall the young man who would break out into occasional shivers for no rhyme or reason.\u201cIt\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou. Does that ring any bells?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s out to get you. This time, I have orders from Boss Xiao himself.\u201dXiao Qixiu?Alarm flickered in the trio\u2019s eyes. Why would the Chief Elder of the Spiritual Law Division poke his nose into such a trivial matter? Was he bored out of his mind?That was impossible!There was only one explanation for this. Xu Xiaoshou had connections in the Spirit Palace.But he was just an Outer Yard disciple. What kind of connection could he possibly have with Xiao Qixiu?A deep crease furrowed Lan Xinzi\u2019s brow. She was coming to realize the recklessness of her actions.But she had done a background check on Xu Xiaoshou. He was your average orphan. What kind of connections could he possess?\u201cSo\u2026\u201cAre you going to head for the Tribunal and turn yourself in? Or am I going to have to make you?\u201d Zhao Xidong seemed to be buzzing with anticipation.He Yuxing stepped forward. \u201cI was the one who gave the orders. Show me the evidence you have that proves my guilt and I\u2019ll go with you willingly.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cOtherwise, you should be looking for Feng Kong and Shao Yi.\u201dZhao Xidong slapped his palm against his forehead. That was practically a confession, wasn\u2019t it?He knew there was no way he could reason with the idiot, though. He ignored what He Yuxing said and instead grinned cheekily. \u201cWere you cooped up somewhere training with your sword? You haven\u2019t heard the news, have you?\u201cFeng Kong and Shao Yi are dead.\u201dHe Yuxing arched an eyebrow. Dead?\u201cWas Xu Xiaoshou the one who killed them?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201dHe sheathed his sword and stood at attention. Then, he turned to Lan Xinzi. \u201cThis has nothing to do with you. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201dLan Xinzi\u2019s eyelids twitched. It wouldn\u2019t have had anything to do with her if he\u2019d kept quiet, but he had opened his big mouth. Now, she couldn\u2019t be sure.Zhao Xidong seemed to have something to say, but He Yuxing curtly cut him off.\u201cYou only need one. I\u2019ll do.\u201dThe law enforcer looked past He Yuxing and eyed the two persons standing behind him curiously.Zhang Xinxiong wasn\u2019t going to say a word. He hadn\u2019t done anything, after all.Lan Xinzi was silent. She didn\u2019t say a single word.Well, that was interesting.Zhao Xidong got to his feet, brushed his hands together, and leapt off the collapsed wall.\u201cSure. Follow me, then.\u201dIt was then that a tremor rippled through the house, and everything started to violently shake.The glint of a blade sped through the doorway and past the four persons, ripping a deep fissure in the ground and cleaving the peaceful abode into two.\u201cZhang Xinxiong! Come out right now and meet your death!\u201d A young, sweet voice pierced the air.Zhang Xinxiong, He Yuxing, and Lan Xinzi were dumbstruck.Zhao Xidong was utterly floored.What was going on?Who would dare openly attack someone in the presence of a law enforcer from the Spiritual Law Division?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: 85The huge doors and the towering walls had been ripped apart by the force of the blade. The barriers hadn\u2019t managed to stop the attack at all. Zhang Xinxiong turned around. He could see exactly what was going on outside the house.A dozen Inner Yard disciples with nothing better to do had gathered in the distance and formed a circle around the house. They were squatting or perched on their bums on stools, nibbling on nuts or spitting out seeds as they snacked on fruits\u2026They were clearly bored out of their minds. Nevertheless, these were just ordinary Inner Yard disciples, hardly the Inner Yard Thirty-Three. They weren\u2019t the ones who had openly issued the challenge.His eyes fell on a young woman in a red dress who was slowly making her way toward them. He tore his gaze from her slender, shapely legs and stepped forward. His voice was soft as he asked, \u201cRao Yinyin?\u201dLan Xinzi curled her fingers into fists. This man never usually spoke to her in such a gentle manner.Rao Yinyin smiled sweetly, then shook her head slightly. She reached her hand behind her and pulled.A young girl in white appeared. She barely reached Rao Yinyin\u2019s chest.She scrunched her adorable nose and stabbed her huge white sword into the ground. The blade was enveloped in a threatening Sword Will that showed no signs of receding.Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s face darkened. \u201cSu Qianqian, are you crazy? What are you doing?\u201d\u201cKilling someone!\u201dZhao Xidong tripped over thin air. He stepped forward and grabbed the girl.\u201cYoung lady, please don\u2019t cause a scene. I\u2019m standing right here. Can\u2019t you at least wait for me to be gone before you do anything?\u201dShe was putting him in a terrible spot.She couldn\u2019t simply do whatever she wanted just because she was Boss Xiao\u2019s favorite disciple!Did Boss Xiao know that she was on a rampage?This just wasn\u2019t turning out to be his day. He couldn\u2019t voice his protests, though. Some things were meant to be kept private, destined to languish in the recesses of his mind.Su Qianqian\u2019s eyes lit up when her gaze landed on Zhao Xidong.\u201cBrother Xidong, help me guard the backdoor! Make sure he doesn\u2019t escape!\u201dZhao Xidong\u2019s face darkened. He thundered. \u201cStop fooling around!\u201dThe smile on Su Qianqian\u2019s face dimmed. She pulled a dark red token out. \u201cElder Xiao has issued his orders. Zhang Xinxiong has committed a grievous crime, for which he is to be executed!\u201dSilence descended upon them all.Smash!One of the disciples, who\u2019d been munching on nuts, fell off his stool.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Su Qianqian stole the token so that she could kill someone.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so sure she stole it?\u201d\u201cYou must be new here. Su Qianqian\u2019s done plenty of such things.\u201dZhou Tianshen scratched his head. A huge golden sword was hanging off his back. He hadn\u2019t expected to be seen through that quickly.He\u2019d been passing by when he\u2019d discovered a commotion and had been instinctively drawn towards it.\u201cHonestly, what\u2019s going on? I know the Inner Yard doesn\u2019t forbid fights to the death, but don\u2019t you have to hold your fights in the Ring of Life and Death?\u201d asked Zhou Tianshen.\u201cI knew it. You\u2019re new to the place\u2026\u201dThe disciple picked his stool up, grabbed Zhou Tianshan, and put some distance between them and the house. He whispered in a hushed tone, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of what happened yesterday?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zhou Tianshen asked stupidly. He\u2019d had a restful, dreamless sleep in his new quarters in the Inner Yard. He had absolutely no clue what had happened.He had been distracted by the incredibly rich and nourishing spiritual energies all around him. With the powerful soundproofing array activated, he could sleep through an earthquake.\u201cAre you an idiot? That happens to all newbies, I guess. They sleep like the dead.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI heard that the upper echelons of the Inner Yard set up an ambush at Goose Lake to catch a masked man. They failed, though.\u201dZhou Tianshen was shocked. \u201cIs Zhang Xinxiong the masked man?\u201dThere was a momentary silence.\u201cNo, you idiot!\u201dThe other disciple nearly swallowed the entire fruit, seed and all. He rolled his eyes. \u201cWhile they were busy trying to catch the guy, Feng Kong and his sidekick went to the Outer Yard to kill someone!\u201d\u201cKong Feng? An Inner Yard disciple?\u201d Zhou Tianshen was utterly bewildered. \u201cIs he stupid? Even if he killed his victim successfully, he\u2019d still have the Spiritual Law Division hot on his tail. He won\u2019t escape capture.\u201d\u201cHe failed to make it into the Inner Yard Thirty-Three, so he wanted to make a quick buck before leaving the Spirit Palace for good,\u201d the other disciple scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen plenty like him over the years.\u201dZhou Tianshen carefully considered this. He\u2019d heard that the audition for the Inner Yard Thirty-Three had ended before the Outer Yard\u2019s Windcloud Competition.But he\u2019d only found out about this after entering the Inner Yard.\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with what\u2019s going on now?\u201d Zhou Tianshen was baffled.He stared at the scene unfolding before him. Everyone had known from the moment Su Qianqian pulled out that token that she\u2019d stolen it. But no one had dared to do anything about it without considering the potential consequences.\u201cHeh! It\u2019s got everything to do with it!\u201d The eyes of the disciple lit up. That was the look of a gossip.\u201cI heard that Zhang Xinxiong was the one who sent Feng Kong to kill the Outer Yard disciple. I also heard that their target shares a secret relationship with Su Qianqian.\u201d\u201cLook, she\u2019s come knocking at his door!\u201d\u201cThe Inner Yard seems to be rife with politics,\u201d Zhou Tianshen thought to himself. He couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the person whom Zhang Xinxiong wanted dead.\u201cIs she seeking vengeance, then?\u201d he asked.\u201cVengeance?\u201d The other disciple shook his head. There was a hint of awe in his eyes. \u201cNot at all. Feng Kong and his sidekick ended up being killed by their target\u2026\u201dZhou Tianshen was dumbstruck. An Outer Yard disciple had somehow managed to kill an Inner Yard disciple?\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Who killed them?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again\u2026\u201d The other disciple\u2019s eyes glazed over as he tried to recall the name. Then, he said tentatively, \u201cI heard Su Qianqian call him\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Little Beast?\u201dFor his ineptitude as a gossip, he received a look of scorn from another disciple next to him nibbling on melon seeds. \u201cIt\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou!\u201d the latter said snidely.\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026\u201d Zhou Tianshen pursed his lips. Why did that name sound so familiar?Hold on a minute.\u201cXu Xiaoshou?\u201d His eyes widened suddenly. \u201cWhich Xu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cYou just arrived from the Outer Yard, right? You should know him. He\u2019s the champion of the Windcloud Competition.\u201dZhou Tianshen fell from his stool. He was stupefied.Was it truly him?That guy\u2026How was this possible?Shock and disbelief coursed through him.Zhou Tianshen had put on his best behavior after entering the Inner Yard and had taken every care not to cause offense to anyone important in the Inner Yard.Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, who was still stuck in the Outer Yard, had managed to kill two disciples.This\u2026He truly deserved his title as the champion!Zhou Tianshen grew excited. He had dogged the footsteps of the champion and gotten his hands on the scroll. He had benefited greatly from that.Even though he had now entered the Inner Yard, it appeared that he had to continue dogging the footsteps of this champion!He was confident that he would be rewarded with more pleasant surprises!His eyes gleamed with anticipation as he eyed the scene before him and the stalemate that had arisen because of the appearance of a token.Kill him!His name was Zhang Xinxiong, wasn\u2019t it? He had the guts to mess with the man who was his lighthouse and beacon. He must die!Everyone\u2019s eyes fell on Zhao Xidong. The smart ones knew that he was the one who would decide whether a fight broke out or not.Zhao Xidong\u2019s jaw clenched. He decided that he couldn\u2019t let Su Qianqian do whatever she wanted. Otherwise, he would have to make another trip to the Tribunal.\u201cSu Qianqian, put your weapon away. This matter isn\u2019t as simple as you think it is.\u201dHe pointed at He Yuxing. \u201cHe\u2019s the mastermind behind everything.\u201dSu Qianqian eyed He Yuxing suspiciously. Why would he get himself involved?Was he trying to play the hero and shoulder the blame for Zhang Xinxiong?That couldn\u2019t be right. He Yuxing and Zhang Xinxiong didn\u2019t get along. Besides, he wasn\u2019t acquainted with the Wen family at all. Only the Zhang family would attempt to avenge Wen Chong\u2019s death.\u201cSister Rao?\u201d She stared at the young woman in the red dress with a look of mild puzzlement on her face.Rao Yinyin patted her on the head indulgently. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019re other people in this house too.\u201dSu Qianqian froze momentarily. Her eyes fell on Lan Xinzi\u2026Then, they turned toward Zhang Xinxiong and He Yuxing before realization struck her.\u201cI see!\u201dThe young woman\u2019s lovely face was flushed with fury. She tugged her huge white sword out of the ground. \u201cSo, there\u2019s three of you. Well, none of you will be going anywhere!\u201dThud!Zhao Xidong collapsed onto the ground.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Famed Sword\u201cSu Qianqian, put down the sword!\u201dZhao Xidong\u2019s scolding seemed rather useless to the crowd.That was because Su Qianqian didn\u2019t even bother listening to him after knowing that they were on the same side. She simply called in a subdued tone, \u201cSister Rao.\u201dRao Yinyin knew what that meant. Su Qianqian was about to make a move, and she looked at Zhao Xidong.\u201cEnforcer Zhao\u2026\u201dAn alluring, mesmerizing voice sounded directly in Zhao Xidong\u2019s ears, and for some reason, he was compelled to turn around and look at the woman in the red dress.The very moment their eyes met, Zhao Xidong only felt a rumbling in his mind, and soft, pinkish colors blossomed, making everything look misty.His expression turned strange in that very instant, and he looked seemingly content yet shy.Eventually, he couldn\u2019t help but lunge forward, but only grabbed thin air. He then slumped to the ground, looking very drunk.\u201cSo huge.\u201dZhou Tianshen, who was watching from behind, was completely stunned. \u201cWhat kind of demonic art is this?\u201d he thought.That woman in the red dress had only glanced at him, and he just slumped to the ground just like that?That was an enforcer, man!From what he could tell, the enforcers from the Spiritual Law Division were at least powerful enough to serve as referees in the Wind and Cloud Contest.Zhou Tianshen on the other hand\u2026Was merely someone among the 32 strongest.That comparison made the differences between them glaringly obvious, yet one such powerful law enforcer had just dropped to the ground from one look in the eye.A spectator off to the side who was eating baked seeds, looked on with envy and quipped, \u201cWell, that really is Sister Rao\u2019s \u2018Mesmeric Art\u2019 for you, something capable of taking on any man.\u201d\u201cI heard that it\u2019s a paradise in that illusion. D*mn, I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get the chance to experience that\u2026\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d The one who was biting on the seeds sounded sarcastic and pointed at his bench. \u201cYou\u2019re only fit for daydreaming on a bench!\u201d\u201cAt least I dare to dream. That\u2019s more than what you can do.\u201d\u201cHehe, dream? What\u2019s the use daydreaming? If you dare\u2026\u201dRao Yinyin turned around all of a sudden, causing the two of them to gasp in fright.Zhou Tianshen looked elsewhere, seemingly saying that none of that had anything to do with him.Back in the battle.As soon as Zhao Xidong dropped to the ground, Su Qianqian started dragging her massive sword along the ground, kicking up sparks, as she charged at Zhang Xinxiong.\u201cShe\u2019s actually doing it?\u201d Everyone was stunned.The crowd had initially thought she was just putting up a show, not expecting her to actually make good on her word.Zhang Xinxiong drew a thick, long, black iron stick from his ring and lightly tapped it on the ground, causing the ground to immediately crack.He deemed that if Su Qianqian dared to actually attack him, then he would have nothing to fear.There was a law enforcer present, and he was on the defensive in the first place, which meant that he was always the one with the advantage.As for that girl\u2019s powers\u2026\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhile she is indeed one of the 33 in the Inner Yard, that girl\u2019s only been there for like a year or two, right?\u201cDoes she really think she can take a veteran of five to six years like me on?:Zhang Xinxiong was very tall\u2014nine feet in height\u2014and extraordinarily dashing.Su Qianqian only reached up to his midsection, yet the girl leapt to a height of well over three meters when she was getting near.As soon as that snow-white massive sword was lifted up, terrifying sword will was brought to bear as it came crashing down on him.Zhang Xinxiong was immediately stunned.The way he saw it, that white, massive sword was like a giant tombstone blocking out the sky as it came down on him.A shuddering cold crept into his soul, and boundless fear washed over him. The tombstone got increasingly closer, and there was no running away.\u201cSomething is wrong with the sword\u2026\u201dHe dared to say that Su Qianqian was definitely incapable of bringing such powerful swordplay to bear on him.The only thing about her that was making him feel so much pressure was definitely that white, massive sword she was holding in her hand.So that sword was an heirloom in the Su family, then?The 21st among the famed swords.Epitaph of City Snow.\u201cOpen.\u201d Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s expression was one of weariness, and a bit of bloody light seeped over the black staff. The length of the staff grew exponentially and became as thick as a tree trunk.Given that there was no evading it, he would simply take the attack head-on. Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s forte was sheer power, which meant that he wasn\u2019t about to lose to one such famed sword.The massive sword came crashing down while that black iron trunk stood in its way.A deafening rumble echoed.The few who were involved in the fight were all fine. It was the surrounding crowd that was sent flying instead.Zhou Tianshen was completely stunned. Despite being in midair, his gaze was still fixed on the two who were going at it.The girl in white bringing the sword down looked frail, yet Zhang Xinxiong, who\u2019d just blocked the attack, looked sinister instead.\u201cHah!\u201d Su Qianqian gritted her teeth as she bore down on him with her sword.Boom!The ground exploded, and a crater appeared. Zhang Xinxiong, however\u2026Was still seen standing in the middle of the crater.\u201cIt\u2019s still too early for you to compete with me in terms of strength.\u201dZhang Xinxiong took a sarcastic jab at her, and then intended to make his next move. Su Qianqian, who was right above him, however, wasn\u2019t going to give him the chance. A shout was then heard.\u201cHeavy Tomb!\u201dYet another entity came crashing down from the sky, which was then infused into that white, massive blade.To Zhang Xinxiong, it looked like yet another tombstone was coming crashing down on him.Who the h*ll could take this?He was unable to react before the heavy force of those two tombstones caused his arms to be dislocated.Booooom!The ones involved in the fight quickly retreated, and that crater on the ground spread even further.As soon as Zhou Tianshen dropped to the ground, yet another rumbling energy washed over them, but he wasn\u2019t sent flying this time, as he\u2019d been prepared for it.\u201cSome impact indeed!\u201dHis fighting spirit was high, and he felt his blood boil. He then grabbed the golden domineering blade on his back, feeling that the blade was getting as excited as he was.This was what he sought:One slash that would cleave right through flesh and bones, leaving nothing behind.\u201cWait, something is off,\u201d he thought.\u201cWhere\u2019s Zhang Xinxiong?\u201cWhere is that guy?\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that he was reduced to mush!\u201d he thought.Clang!Two sections of the staff dropped from the sky into that deep crater, and this scene shocked all the spectators around.\u201cHoly sh**! The \u2018Black Shark\u2019 is broken?\u201d\u201cThat thing is a sixth-grade spiritual weapon, no? A Master Level weapon, yet\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually broken?\u201dZhou Tianshen was dumbfounded, and he wondered if that thing really was a sixth-grade spiritual weapon.That golden domineering blade of his was only ninth-grade.His blade wasn\u2019t even at Innate Level.Su Qianqian\u2019s mouth twitched, and she tsked satisfactorily before putting that massive blade of hers back on her back.\u201cConsider that broken stick a lesson to you, then.\u201dShe tilted her head and looked at Lan Xinzi\u2019s back, saying seriously, \u201cif you dare mess with Brother Xiaoshou ever again, someone\u2019s gonna die.\u201dGulp. Everyone around gulped at that moment.That girl still looked cute even when she was being serious, which meant that her words hardly had any weight.Yet, if one were to consider what she just did\u2026Somehow, Lan Xinzi was terrified deep down. She wondered how it was possible for Zhang Xinxiong to be stuck underground like that.\u201cIsn\u2019t this Su Qianqian a little too ridiculous?\u201d she thought.If she\u2019d been in Su Qianqian\u2019s shoes, she would\u2019ve had a hard time taking that one punch, even if Zhang Xinxiong had yet to use his bloodline power. Furthermore, he had fielded the Black Shark.In the end, however, Black Shark broke in two.She wondered if that girl was truly someone who had been in the Inner Yard for a year or two.\u201cSu, Qian, qian!\u201dA voice full of suppressed anger was heard from underground. Zhang Xinxiong shot out of the crater and threw a punch at Su Qianqian, who was walking away.Zhou Tianshen\u2019s eyes flew open, and he couldn\u2019t help but alert her. \u201cLook out!\u201dThe person next to him immediately slapped a hand over Zhou Tianshen\u2019s mouth, trying to muffle his voice.\u201cDo you have a death wish or something? What the hell are you shouting like that for in the middle of a show? You could die, you know!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Knocks on the Door AgainWhoosh!His fist was as quick as the wind, and Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s sudden attack startled all of the spectators around.There was no way that Su Qianqian, who was at Upper Spiritual Level as well, wouldn\u2019t see that attack coming. Yet, she unexpectedly didn\u2019t do anything about it, looking as if she really didn\u2019t notice that an ambush was coming for her.\u201cZhang Xinxiong, you\u2019re so dead!\u201dAll of a sudden, Zhao Xidong\u2019s voice was heard from the side. Zhang Xinxiong was startled, and he turned around.The man, who should\u2019ve still been on the ground, giggling lecherously, had actually gotten to his feet somehow and was now throwing a fist at him.Zhang Xinxiong immediately opened his hand and swatted at Zhao Xidong like a beast swatting at a fly.Zhao Xidong didn\u2019t take the attack and instead parried it, sliding off of Zhang Xinxiong\u2019s wrist.Boom!A rumble was heard, and it was like Zhang Xinxiong was oblivious of everything else as he turned around and closed his hands, which he then cleaved downward.That attack would send Zhao Xidong\u2019s head flying if it were to hit his neck.\u201cYou dare?\u201d Zhao Xidong only glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m the law enforcer!\u201dZhang Xinxiong finally came to his senses after hearing this, and his hands stopped right before the man\u2019s black clothes.There was the sound of clothes billowing, and then there was utter silence.Everyone was relieved to see that a fight with a law enforcer wasn\u2019t going to break out.Yet, they found it to be a pity all the same, and the mood became rather sullen after the fight was abruptly halted.Su Qianqian snickered and said, \u201cBrother Xidong, he\u2019s about to beat me up.\u201d\u201cWhy you!\u201d\u201cYou really thought I didn\u2019t see what you did just because I dropped to the ground?\u201d Zhao Xidong thought.He was extremely furious, yet he glared at Rao Yinyin instead, who was outside the battlefield.He\u2019d never thought that this girl, who had pretty much just kept to herself when she first joined the Inner Yard, would actually able to mesmerize him like that.Rao Yinyin shrugged, and then explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cYeah, sure!\u201d Zhao Xidong rolled his eyes, and then glared at Su Qianqian, feeling extremely furious. \u201cReturn your master\u2019s token at once!\u2019\u201cAlright.\u201d Su Qianqian immediately ran off.\u201cYou still wanna fight?\u201d He turned to look at Zhang Xinxiong again.Fight, you say?Zhang Xinxiong undoubtedly wanted to continue fighting. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t want to after having his Black Shark snapped just like that.\u201cCould I, though?\u201d he thought.Zhao Xidong or not, the presence of any law enforcer alone would make it impossible for a fight to be had.\u201cSo, what about my Black Shark, then?\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat about that sixth-grade spiritual weapon of mine that was just snapped like that, then?\u201dZhang Xinxiong\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits, and were full of extreme anger. Yet, when he took a look at that woman in the red dress, he simply swallowed it down.He picked up the broken sections of his staff and dusted them off before casting a glance at Su Qianqian.\u201cYou did what you did, and that was the price,\u201d Su Qianqian said.Rao Yinyin came over and put herself in front of her to block her. Zhang Xinxiong took a deep breath and said, \u201cAlright, you win.\u201dThis line was actually directed at Rao Yinyin.Rao Yinyin didn\u2019t reply. She simply patted Su Qianqian\u2019s head, and Zhang Xinxiong looked behind him.His place had been cleaved in half by the attack before.\u201cNo need to worry about that. I\u2019ve given an order to the Spiritual Affairs Division, and they\u2019re going to send someone to fix this.\u201dSu Qianqian jerked her head out, paused, and then added, \u201cI\u2019ve paid the required Spirit Crystals.\u201dZhang Xinxiong looked like he was shuddering.The spectators were all baffled.\u201cMy gosh. He actually just swallowed it like that? Boy, Master Zhang really, really has a thing for Sister Rao, then.\u201d\u201cYou can say that again. \u2018He-Lan-Zhang-Rao-Su\u2019, everyone knew that winding line of infatuation after all. You think Sister Rao would spare anyone who did anything to Su Qianqian, eh?\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk, you have a point.\u201dZhou Tianshen scratched his head, puzzled, being totally oblivious to what those people were talking about. The only thing he could say was that the Inner Yard was truly a messy place.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Sister Rao.\u201d Su Qianqian then walked off with the woman in red.Zhao Xidong thought for a bit, but didn\u2019t stop the two of them from walking away.\u201cAlright,\u201d he thought. \u201cConsider this a favor to Big Brother Xiao, then. Just pretend that I didn\u2019t see this.\u201dHis eyes narrowed as he savored the paradise that he was steeped in before turning around to look at He Yuxing, yet he found that the man was staring at the girl\u2019s massive sword instead.That guy sure is crazy\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe Yuxing withdrew his gaze, looking somewhat disappointed. Then he picked up his sword and caught up with Zhao Xidong.\u201cAlright, show\u2019s over.\u201dThe spectators packed up their benches, and all of them left before long.While it was fine to catch a show, the thought of facing off against the 33 of the Inner Yard all alone when said show was over was rather harrowing.Zhou Tianshen was about to leave when he heard someone called out from behind,\u201cYou\u2019re from the Zhou family?\u201dHe turned around to see Zhang Xinxiong looking at him, and he grinned and asked instead, \u201cYou\u2019re from the Zhang family?\u201d\u201cSome guts you\u2019ve got there. Powers need working though.\u201dZhang Xinxiong walked up to Zhou Tianshen and lowered his head to look at him.Zhou Tianshen was already a very tall and stout man, yet when he was in front of Zhang Xinxiong, he was still an entire head shorter nonetheless. Yet, his head remained high, and he didn\u2019t balk at all.\u201cHow is Old Man Zhou doing these days?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s doing very fine. Thanks for the concern.\u201d Zhou Tianshen snickered and added, \u201cSo, you\u2019ve got someone to look at that right arm of yours?\u201dZhang Xinxiong glanced at him but didn\u2019t say anything. He then snickered and walked past Zhou Tianshen.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLan Xinzi immediately followed him.All of a sudden, Zhou Tianshen felt like his feet were stuck to the ground. He shuddered, hardly able to move.An aura that looked like some monster that was almost about to swallow him whole didn\u2019t recede after Zhang Xinxiong left. Instead, the aura seemed to grow even more terrifying, the pressure looming over him and almost choking him.His knees bent, and he looked like he was about to fall on his knees.Boom!Zhou Tianshen\u2019s legs punched through the ground and started bleeding profusely.His entire body became as straight as a javelin.Huff\u2026The crowd had dispersed, and he was the only one left there. His back was drenched by sweat, and he deemed that he had finally made it through.He then uprooted himself from the ground and looked in the direction the two had disappeared. He then clenched his fists.\u201cOne year!\u201d\u2026It was a very cramped guest room.Due to having overworked himself the night before, he was able to sleep on that hard wooden bed like a log.His dreams got exciting.He twisted around, his expression becoming increasingly lewd. His hands could be seen reaching out into the air.Dum, dum, dum!Slow and steady knocks on the door that sounded all too familiar.Due to that ordeal that he had just gone through, he was frightened enough to bolt upright, not even noticing that his dream girl was now gone, and extended his Sense to cover his entire place.\u201cNo one\u2019s inside yet.\u201dHaving rested well, his mental condition had returned to its peak. He sleazily walked to the door.He focused and extended his Sense past the barrier to check out what was going on outside.A petite, frail-looking girl wearing a white dress and carrying a massive sword. She was straightening out her skirts.\u201cSu Qianqian?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was relieved, and silently noted that he\u2019d been too on edge.\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here though?\u201d he thought.He searched his memory as best as he could and recalled a favor that he had done for her.He\u2019d taken care of her as a brother-in-training for about a month, and the girl was accepted into the Inner Yard.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s quite frustrating. Better not think about it,\u201d he thought.\u201cWell, she has the goods, though nowhere near huge.\u201dThe two of them had practically never met since. The Wind and Cloud Contest, when the little girl came to cheer for him, could be considered the last time he\u2019d seen her.\u201cHeh, I guess you could say she\u2019s quite a friend.\u201dThese were the thoughts going through his head when he opened the door.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: 88\u201cBrother Xiaoshou!\u201dAs soon as he opened the door, Su Qianqian leaned forward, grabbing her sleeves, and sweetly called out to him. She didn\u2019t look anything like someone who\u2019d just fought someone.\u201cHey, nice of you to come visit your Brother Xiaoshou, eh?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was also happy to see the little girl before him, yet he nonetheless mercilessly quipped, \u201cAnd there I was thinking that you\u2019d completely forgotten about me after joining the Inner Yard.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Su Qianqian was flustered and immediately added, \u201cI\u2019ve been following what you\u2019ve been doing all the time. I went to see you at the contest, and I was there when you became champion!\u201d\u201cSure, sure\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou took a look at that little girl, who only managed to reach the height of his chest despite being on tip-toe. He couldn\u2019t help but pat her head. It felt just like he\u2019d remembered.The little girl frowned, seemingly displeased that her hairdo was now messed up.\u201cYou\u2019re still that short\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d\u201cUh, umm, I mean, yeah\u2026 are you here to celebrate the fact that I\u2019ve become champion?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou immediately changed the subject.\u201cHmph!\u201d Su Qianqian pouted. \u201cI was, but I no longer am.\u201dAn awkward grin appeared on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face, and he inwardly chastised himself for having blurted out his inner thoughts just like that.That girl was no longer his lackey after all, and at the moment she was his guest, so he saw fit to at least act like a proper host.He waved and said, \u201cCome on in, then.\u201dYet, when he turned around, the unsightliness of his place almost blinded him. All the craters on the ground were still around.He was exasperated. How would he be able to play the host in a place like this?His main house was gone. There was only a bench in his guest room, and he wasn\u2019t about to have the two of them sit on the bed chatting away.\u201cWell\u2026 that seems like a feasible idea nonetheless!\u201d he thought.\u201cBut then again, when you chat, you get thirsty, no? Yet this dump\u2019s reservoir contents are all completely evaporated. Am I gonna have us drink from the pond, which is practically the fishs\u2019 bathwater?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dSu Qianqian noted Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s courtesy, yet he remained stuck in the doorway, not going inside, causing her to halt as well.\u201cWell, Qianqian, I just thought that since it\u2019s been a while since we last met, there\u2019s no point staying cooped in my place. I was just thinking of going outside, so care to join me?\u201dHe didn\u2019t even wait for her to reply. He went on to lock the door and pushed her outside.\u201cOh, sure!\u201d Su Qianqian was completely fine with it. She bit the tip of her finger and yelled in excitement, \u201cHow about Goose Lake, then? It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been there.\u201dXu Xiaoshou almost tripped over and fell flat on the ground.\u201cGoose Lake huh\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cGoose Lake again!\u201cMy gosh, that dump is the place of nightmares!\u201dHe\u2019d just escaped certain death the night before, and that memory was still fresh in his mind, making him reluctant to refresh the memory.But, having been pushed to the front, Su Qianqian was naturally oblivious to Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression, and she simply kept yapping. \u201cI remember how you took me there to practice sword techniques\u2026\u201cOh, right! You kept telling me that I still needed to work on the first move of the White Cloud Sword Techniques, yet when I asked my master about it, he said that I was already doing fine. You have to teach me the second move this time!\u201dSu Qianqian didn\u2019t even need to turn around, as she was already able to stare at Xu Xiaoshou with her huge eyes and that persistent look on her face just by looking up.The corners of his mouth twitched. He would very much like to teach her if possible.\u201cBut with that talent of yours, you managed to learn the first move in less than two hours after I taught you, while that was the only move I managed to master despite working at it for three years. How the h*ll am I gonna teach you more?\u201d he thought.He sighed, and, looking like he knew what he was doing, said, \u201cWell, forget about the White Cloud Sword Techniques. Outdated stuff anyway\u2026 How about I teach you something of higher levels?\u201dSu Qianqian\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. \u201cHigher-level stuff?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou looked confident. \u201cSword Soaring Technique.\u201dSu Qianqian\u2019s lips parted somewhat, and her expression seemed to say \u201cI know this one.\u201d She flipped away and shot that massive sword on her back to the sky, moving fluidly like a dragon swimming in the sky.\u201cLike this?\u201d she turned around and asked.Xu Xiaoshou was completely dumbfounded.\u201cOkay, your Sword Soaring Technique is wayyyy better than mine,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to even teach, then?\u201dYet, he was unable to just throw away his big brother fa\u00e7ade, so he just nodded and said, \u201cDoing fine.\u201cBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m about to teach you. What I\u2019m about to teach you is the legendary \u2018Riding Sword Flight.\u2019\u201dSu Qianqian looked like she\u2019d just realized something, and her expression seemed to say \u201cI know this one too.\u201d Then she leapt and lightly landed on her sword.Her white attire billowed as she zipped about riding her massive sword, looking like some female sword fairy.Xu Xiaoshou was completely dumbfounded again.\u201cSo, I was the one who was holding her back, then?\u201d he thought.\u201cThat girl learned nothing but a single move of the White Cloud Sword Techniques after following me around for a month. How come, after not seeing her for a little more than a year, it seems like she\u2019s learned everything?\u201d\u201cVery well. Nice progress.\u201d He kept himself calm and then said, \u201cBut what I\u2019m about to teach you is nothing so simple as that.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Su Qianqian hopped down from her sword. This was simple?She remembered having worked at it for almost half a day to pick it up.\u201cSo, what is it, then?\u201dXu Xiaoshou wore a mysterious smirk and blurted every single word out slowly: \u201cReverse Sword Subduing!\u201d\u201cReverse Sword Subduing?\u201d Su Qianqian couldn\u2019t help but wonder what that was. She noted that it sounded awesome and that it wasn\u2019t something even her master had brought up before.\u201cWell, I bet you don\u2019t know this one, no?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou looked pleased with himself.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYou wanna learn it? I don\u2019t just teach anyone, you know\u2026\u201d\u201cI wanna learn this!\u201d\u201cAlright. Greet me first, then.\u201d\u201cBrother Xiaoshou!\u201dXu Xiaoshou nodded satisfactorily, and his expression seemed to suggest that he\u2019d found himself a good student. \u201cTo learn \u2018Reverse Sword Subduing,\u2019 we shall first learn the \u2018Reverse Sword Style.\u2019\u201d\u201cHuh? What is \u2018Reverse Sword Style?\u2019\u201d\u201cHehe, here\u2019s the tricky thing about it.\u201d\u201cThis is the supreme technique that your Brother Xiaoshou here personally created after witnessing the \u2018Fleeting White Clouds\u2019 at work. With this technique, I carved my way through the contest, reigning supreme over all, to finally become the champion of the contest!\u201d\u201cYou personally created this?\u201d Su Qianqian\u2019s eyes flew open, her curiosity piqued. It was apparent that she was aware of his emphasis on the move.He\u2026 created his own spiritual technique?That was something only the likes of masters could pull off!\u201cNot that much of a big deal, actually.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou nodded humbly. \u201cI see that you can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s get to it, then.\u201dThe two of them, one tall and one short, drew their own swords at the front of the compound and started to work at it.\u201cWell then, come here. We\u2019ll first turn our swords around\u2026\u201d\u201cUmm, why do we have to do that?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s because\u2026 well umm, I\u2019m not gonna answer something so simple. Put your brains to work for a little bit and think about it.\u201d\u201cWhy? Can\u2019t you sense the sword\u2019s sentience without turning it around?\u201d\u201cNope, you have to turn the sword around. That\u2019s the essence of the move.\u201d\u2026\u201cAlright, I give up. Throw the sword out now and summon it back after you\u2019ve thrown it extremely far\u2026 d*mn, how can you control the direction of its return?\u201d\u201cNo! You have to aim it at yourself!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask. It\u2019s just the essence of how it works.\u201d\u2026Moments later, Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky, feeling exasperated. He wondered if this was what the difference between talent and mediocrity looked like.It\u2019d taken him one whole night back then to finally figure something like this out, yet it\u2019d only taken the little girl a little while to figure it out.See\u2026The girl was already having her sword fly in the reverse direction up in the sky\u2026Su Qianqian was having fun up there. The move had indeed opened up her mind quite a bit, yet it didn\u2019t take long for her to start feeling a little dizzy.\u201cBrother Xiaoshou, why am I feeling dizzy up here?\u201dXu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and suppressed his frustration and the feeling like his heart was in pieces. Then he answered casually, \u201cThat\u2019s something to train your will.\u201cIf you can\u2019t even get over sword-sickness, how are you gonna fight someone in the sky in the future?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: HeatstrokeIt was warm in the afternoon. Two figures were seen slowly flying across the sky, catching people\u2019s attention.\u201cLook, what\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cXu Xiaoshou?\u201d\u201cSeems like him. And Reverse Sword Subduing?\u201dSome people got very excited. Xu Xiaoshou was a huge figure among the ones from the Outer Yard. He was still the champion after all, and his antics never failed to baffle others. As such, there were a lot of people who knew him.\u201cWho is that next to him? The sword is so huge I can\u2019t make out who\u2019s riding it.\u201d\u201cLooks like Su Qianqian from the Inner Yard, but that can\u2019t be right. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. No way Su Qianqian would go on the streets like that with Xu Xiaoshou.\u201d\u201cYeah, you got that right, but I\u2019m surprised she knows \u2018Reverse Sword Subduing\u2019 too. Man, this is something!\u201d\u201cThis is something? Seems dizzying to me\u2026\u201dIn the sky, Su Qianqian was indeed feeling rather dizzy, yet she managed to suppress the motion sickness. \u201cBrother Xiaoshou, why are we flying so slow?\u201dXu Xiaoshou glared at her and said, \u201cSlow? This is steady!\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing wrong with you, it\u2019s that you get too anxious over everything. Steadiness is important, you know?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Su Qianqian listened without objecting to anything.Xu Xiaoshou then glanced at the Information Bar.Envied, Passive Points +32.Envied, Passive Points +4.Envied, Passive Points +122.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is some reward indeed,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy the well would I wanna fly fast, then?\u201dFurthermore, one had to be capable of flying fast in order to do so, and his current speed was pretty much his very limit.His remaining Passive Points had been reduced to single-digits after he finished his drawings, yet having his body encroached by that masked person\u2019s sword aura had enabled him to earn over 1000 Passive Points.But then again, such a way of earning points was nowhere near as comfortable as what he was doing now.\u201cSee? I\u2019ve already managed to earn this much just by flying from my place to Goose Lake. All done simply by taking in bits after bits. Many a little makes a mickle, as they say\u2026 and look, I\u2019m almost at 2000 Passive Points earned already.\u201dXu Xiaoshou felt like he\u2019d just discovered a new way of making money.With the contest over and no safe fights to be had, he deemed that taking a stroll every day from then on out would earn him a number of Passive Points comparable to fighting someone while enabling him to take a breather and relax as well.And, if he happened to do it at peak hours\u2026Hehe. Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was about to salivate.Both of them flew to Goose Lake, and Su Qianqian finally decided to stop playing. She then asked solemnly, \u201cBrother Xiaoshou, was someone trying to kill you last night?\u201dXu Xiaoshou came to his senses, astonished at how quickly news traveled. He wondered if that was the real reason why Su Qianqian had come looking for him.\u201cElder Xiao told you about it?\u201dSu Qianqian shook her head. \u201cMy master doesn\u2019t tell me things like that.\u201d\u201cActually, the reason why I came here, other than to congratulate you, was to tell you to beware of several people from the Inner Yard.\u201d\u201cThose people had something to do with the assassin last night?\u201d He raised his eyebrows.Su Qianqian nodded. \u201cAnd they may also have something to do with more assassins coming your way in the future too.\u201dHis art at controlling his blade, which was actually far from steady, caused him to almost trip when he heard this. He wobbled for a bit before steadying himself yet again.\u201cSo it\u2019s just like what I speculated, then? That was just the beginning.\u201d\u201cWen Chong?\u201d he probed.A look of surprise appeared in Su Qianqian\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou knew?\u201d\u201cI guessed\u2026\u201d His expression then turned glum. The matter had indeed taken a turn for the worst possible direction. \u201cTell me more, then.\u201dSu Qianqian sorted out her thoughts and continued, \u201cYou know anything about the \u2018Inner Yard Thirty-Three?\u2019\u201dXu Xiaoshou nodded, then shook his head. He knew next to nothing at all.She then elaborated, \u201cPer its namesake, the \u2018Inner Yard Thirty-Three\u2019 naturally denotes the 33 most powerful people among the hundred or so from the Inner Yard.\u201cIt\u2019s also a ranking that reshuffles every year, basically right before the Wind and Cloud Contest takes place in the Outer Yard.\u201dXu Xiaoshou nodded. He hadn\u2019t known this.Su Qianqian then continued, \u201cFew disciples join the Inner Yard every year, and some years none get in. Yet, the number of those who fight to become one of the 33 yet fail to remains abundant.\u201cMany among these people fight for many years but still fail to make the cut.\u201cContinuous shocks, seeing their potential run out, basically no longer getting any resources from the Inner Yard, and knowing that they\u2019ll probably be surpassed by some geniuses who just joined the Inner Yard.\u201cAs such, most of these people choose to just leave the spirit palace to seek their fortunes outside.She then paused and looked at Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cSome choose to earn quite a bit of cash before leaving. Then they leave in secret and never return.\u201dXu Xiaoshou realized something by this point.He\u2019d speculated that those two whom he\u2019d clashed against last night were among such people. Now he realized why they\u2019d dared to make a move in the spirit palace as members of the Inner Yard and tried to kill a puny disciple from the Outer Yard.\u201cSo, all of those who are connected with Wen Chong are sending people to kill me just because I killed Wen Chong?\u201d He had enough perspective to get the gist of the issue.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Su Qianqian then tapped her head. \u201cThe assassins are but lackeys, so they don\u2019t matter much. The truly troublesome one is the one behind the scenes.\u201dXu Xiaoshou then wobbled again. \u201cWait, lackeys\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cGosh, you almost scared me to death back there!\u201dHe repeated her last few words. \u201cThe one behind the scenes?\u201dThere was a wary look in her eyes as she continued, \u201cZhang Xinxiong.\u201dThat was a name Xu Xiaoshou had never heard before. He was rather baffled. \u201cHe\u2019s related to Wen Chong in some way?\u201d\u201cYeah, they\u2019re relatives.\u201d\u201cThe young master of Tiansang Prefecture. He has a tall, stout build and is bestowed with the bloodline powers of his family. He joined the Inner Yard five years ago, and his powers are formidable.\u201d\u201cFive years ago?\u201d he thought.\u201cHoly sh**. Who could fight someone like this?\u201dHe was no longer able to keep himself steady, and immediately fell from the sky.It was fortunate that they hadn\u2019t been flying high to begin with. He then knelt on the ground, dusted himself off, and straightened his clothes before waving to Su Qianqian, who was still up in the sky.\u201cCome down and talk. It\u2019s rather chilly up there.\u201dSu Qianqian titled her head and looked at the huge, vibrant sun up there, wondering if it was actually chilly.\u201cIt\u2019s a hot day and there\u2019s no wind to be had since we\u2019re flying so slow. So what do you mean chilly?\u201d she thought.She nonetheless did as she was told and scratched her head for a bit before leaping off of her sword.Xu Xiaoshou then walked up to her as he kept playing with the name \u201cZhang Xinxiong\u201d in his head. Then he asked, \u201cUpper Spiritual Level?\u201dSu Qianqian nodded. \u201cThe peak.\u201dHe staggered.Su Qianqian pondered for a bit and added, \u201cHe was already at the peak of Upper Spiritual Level a year ago. He\u2019s been suppressing his level so he can join the match at Dongtianwang City in half a year.\u201dHis legs gave out from under him, and he quickly grabbed onto the white jade fence to steady himself, preventing him from dropping to the floor.\u201cGood heavens!\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201cAre you telling me that the guy who\u2019s trying to kill me could\u2019ve already reached Master Level if he\u2019d wanted to?\u201cWhat have I done to deserve this?\u201dHe felt like crying on the spot. Wouldn\u2019t someone so powerful feel that they were cheapening themselves for even bothering to get rid of someone like him?Power levels aside, there was a gap between someone of the Inner Yard and Outer Yard, man!\u201cThe ones who came to kill you, their names are Feng Kong and Shao Yi. I\u2019ve asked around, and it seems that they weren\u2019t sent by Zhang Xinxiong.\u201dA hopeful look appeared in his eyes. \u201cThey weren\u2019t?\u201d he thought.\u201cThat\u2019s great news!\u201dYet, what Su Qianqian went on to say shocked him further. \u201cThey were probably sent by He Yuxing, and he probably did so because Lan Xinzi said so, and Lan Xinzi was probably doing it because Zhang Xinxiong said so\u2026\u201cHmm, come to think about it, I guess you could say that Zhang Xinxiong was the one who sent them\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was already feeling rather dizzy. \u201cWho are those two, then?\u201dSu Qianqian then answered, \u201cThey are both of the 33.\u201dThump!He was unable to even steady himself by holding the fence, and he immediately dropped to the ground head-first.Su Qianqian immediately became flustered.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Brother Xiaoshou?\u201cAre you getting heatstroke?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: 90The intelligence that Su Qianqian had given him definitely wasn\u2019t unremarkable.Xu Xiaoshou had learned all of a sudden that his enemy was more than just the likes of Feng Kong and Shao Yi; he had to contend with the likes of the Inner Yard Thirty-three.Worse still, that was how things were in the spirit palace. If he were to go outside, he would probably have to deal with the Zhang and Wen family of Tiansang Prefecture.He felt as if his head were about to split open. He\u2019d never thought that a single match would end up giving him such a massive problem.\u201cThat d*mned Wen Chong is to blame for all of this\u2026\u201d He put his head in his arms and seemed to space out.Su Qianqian looked concerned. Xu Xiaoshou thought for a bit and saw that he had no choice but to put the matter aside.What would come, would come, and he\u2019d have to deal with those problems sooner or later. There might be further trials and tribulations waiting for him as he grew more.\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dAfter assuring Su Qianqian that he was fine, he glanced at the massive sword she was carrying on her back and recalled the masked person from last night and what Elder Sang had said.\u201cDo you mind letting me have a look at your sword?\u201d\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201dWithout any hesitation, Su Qianqian took the sword in her hand before handing it over and saying, \u201cThis thing has its own preference with people and it may not like you.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou put his hand on it, and the blade trembled violently all of a sudden, which caused him to jerk his had back as if he\u2019d been electrocuted. \u201cYeesh, that\u2019s eerie.\u201dSu Qianqian then grinned and continued, \u201cThat\u2019s how sentience works. The more powerful a sword is, the more sentient it is.\u201dHe pondered this, then pulled out Hiding Pain. He said with a grin, \u201cI guess you could say that my sword has sentience as well.\u201dThat immediately piqued her interest. She knew that his black sword was no more than ninth-grade.Could a ninth-grade sword have sentience?\u201cTake a look.\u201dXu Xiaoshou turned his sword around and pointed it at himself. The black sword immediately started trembling, despite the fact that he\u2019d done nothing else than point it in his direction.Vooom!He then turned the sword around, and the trembling diminished.Voom!She was puzzled. The sword\u2019s sentience was peculiar.Doubted, Passive Points +1.\u201cDon\u2019t believe me?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou then snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t get out much, do you?\u201dHe turned the black sword around.Vooom!Voom\u2026Voooom!Voom\u2026She was baffled, not knowing what to make of this. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d she thought.Doubted, Passive Points +16.Doubted, Passive Points +37.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was his turn to be startled. Why had he earned so many Passive Points?He glanced around him and saw that the two of them had caught the attention of everyone who was training nearby.Some among them had already recognized Su Qianqian. The champion of the Outer Yard visiting Goose Lake with Su Qianqian of the Inner Yard was considered huge news.Word had spread like wildfire, and the number of people gathering around had gradually increased.Su Qianqian was unfettered, for she had long gotten used to having people surrounding her and staring at her. Geniuses would attract attention wherever they went, after all.Xu Xiaoshou also wasn\u2019t that uncomfortable, for having more people around meant bagging more Passive Points.He paid no mind to those people and forcibly took the trembling massive sword in his hand.Yet, before he was able to take a good look at it, the sword shot into the air all of a sudden and returned to its scabbard strapped to Su Qianqian\u2019s back.He was completely dumbfounded for a moment. He looked at his Hiding Pain, wishing that his sword could be something more.\u201cJust look at that sword, will you?\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cNow that\u2019s sentience. All you have is a tendency to give your wielder trouble!\u201dSu Qianqian grinned. She pulled the massive sword out again and handed it over to Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cBe good now.\u201dThe sword was just about to tremble again, but when it heard her say this, it quieted down all of a sudden.Xu Xiaoshou was utterly impressed by what he was seeing, and he took a good look at the sword.The entire blade was snow-white, and it was unusually thick and heavy. It was totally different from other large swords in that it was more like a thick piece of tablet.Despite having an Innate Level Physique, he was actually able to feel its weight.\u201cWhat a nice sword,\u201d he complimented. This massive blade in his hand was leaps and bounds better than his Hiding Pain.No. The two couldn\u2019t even be compared in the first place.As he took a good look at the sword, he was able to sense misery and sorrow from the quieted snow-white massive blade.He couldn\u2019t help but be pulled in by it, and he seemed to see a massive gravestone, one that looked like it\u2019d been standing since ancient times, on a vast, boundless swath of wasteland covered in snow that had never seen change for thousands of years.Loneliness and sorrow flooded him.His vision then blurred, and the image disappeared suddenly, leaving only the sword before his eyes.Xu Xiaoshou shook his head for a bit before looking up.Doubted, Passive Points +64.Revered, Passive Points +89.\u201cHuh?\u201d he thought.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201dThen, in his periphery, he saw that Goose Lake was covered with a layer of frost.\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201cIt\u2019s summer now and the sun is hanging high above, man!\u201dHe was gradually called back to his senses by the anxious, concerned voice of Su Qianqian calling out to him, \u201cBrother Xiaoshou?\u201dHowever, it was more the chattering noises from everyone around them that filled his ears.\u201cHoly sh**! Why was there a chill all of a sudden? It felt like my soul was about to be frozen over!\u201d\u201cLook, the lake froze!\u201d\u201cWell, something so peculiar could\u2019ve only come from Xu Xiaoshou. Just what the hell happened?\u201d\u201cIs there anyone knowledgeable enough to enlighten me? I\u2019m so d*mn confused!\u201dNo one replied. They were all puzzled, and Xu Xiaoshou was just as puzzled as they were.Su Qianqian was the only one who was filled with shock. \u201cYou could see it?\u201dShe then realized something all of a sudden. \u201cOh, right. You have Innate Sword Will too.\u201dXu Xiaoshou struggled to hide the roiling shock that he was feeling inside. So, this was what famed swords were like?One look and it could drag people into its world?\u201cEpitaph of City Snow\u2026 a gravestone?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Su Qianqian didn\u2019t deny it.\u201cCould you tell me its story?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou felt that the sword definitely had a story of its own.Su Qianqian then giggled gleefully, not expecting that someone other than her grandfather would like to hear her tell a story.She took the sword over and caressed it. The sword then hummed with pleasure, looking like it was very much enjoying it.\u201cIn ancient times, there was a sword saint named Chengxue.\u201cHe had a very good friend who was also a sword saint. This friend was into the killing arts, and as such, was known as the Killer Sword Saint.\u201cHe succumbed to demonic tendencies one day and accidentally killed Chengxue. The Killer Sword Saint was in pain and regretted it when he came to, so he set Chengxue\u2019s sword up as a gravestone to weather the ages.\u201dXu Xiaoshou waited for quite a bit, but Su Qianqian didn\u2019t continue.\u201cYou\u2019re done?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Su Qianqian then looked up with a puzzled look on her face. \u201cThat\u2019s the story of the Epitaph of City Snow. Did I miss anything?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was feeling rather flustered by this point. Yeah, the story was straightforward and got to the point, but somehow he felt\u2026Shouldn\u2019t there be more to the story than that?What happened to the details?Shouldn\u2019t the death of a sword saint be sorrowful yet epic at the same time?What was she thinking by skimping on the details like that? She couldn\u2019t have told a more simpler story if she\u2019d tried.\u201cNice one.\u201d\u201cSimple and to the point.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but feel impressed, and then asked, \u201cAre there swords more precious than this in the Tiansang Spirit Palace?\u201dSu Qianqian flashed a beaming smile after hearing his compliments. Then she shook her head casually. \u201cNone.\u201d\u201cThink hard and serious. There\u2019s yet another sword more powerful than this one!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said seriously.Su Qianqian\u2019s smile froze, and she tilted her head and pondered this, then answered seriously. \u201cNone.\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dHis heart sank right away. He\u2019d figured that was the case, yet it just couldn\u2019t be.If there were indeed none, then the sword that the masked person was looking for would be none other than Su Qianqian\u2019s Epitaph of City Snow.That guy was someone even those big shots in the Tiansang Spirit Palace couldn\u2019t take out. If he were to set his sights on Su Qianqian, what would become of her?\u201cSh**.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was feeling anxious.Su Qianqian glanced at him, then seemed to realize something. \u201cBrother Xiaoshou, are you concerned about that masked guy from last night?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: 91\u201cHuh? How did you know?\u201dXu Xiaoshou was rather surprised, but when he recalled how quickly Su Qianqian had been able to come to him, he realized that she definitely knew everything.\u201cThat guy came for me last night.\u201d What she said surprised him.He was flabbergasted. \u201cYou already knew he came for you and yet you\u2019re still all smiles?\u201d he thought.However, he was stunned at the same time. He figured that the Tiansang Spirit Palace was actually mobilizing the powers of the entire place just to keep this girl before him safe.Su Qianqian\u2019s expression seemed to say \u201crelax.\u201d She raised her hand and patted his shoulder for a bit to comfort him.\u201cThere are 21 famed swords on the continent. With the exception of those lost ones, all are pretty much protected by certain sword wielders.\u201d\u201cThe previous wielder of Epitaph of City Snow was my grandfather.\u201d\u201cWhen I was young, three waves of assassins would come to my place every night on average, all of them there for the sword. But then again, as expected, all of them were dead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to situations like this.\u201d She looked totally unconcerned.Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. This was the first time he\u2019d heard the little girl talk about such things.Su Qianqian put her hands behind her back, acting like an old person. It was obvious that she was doing an impression of her grandfather.\u201cMy grandfather fell ill when I was 10. Everyone at home started touching the sword, as famed swords pick their next wielder.\u201cEveryone had high hopes for my father, as he\u2019d been preparing for that day for decades.\u201cYet, a year later, it was I who earned its recognition, and I became its wielder when I was 11.\u201dXu Xiaoshou caught the underlying bitterness in the otherwise cheerful tone in which she elaborated her story. He then asked, \u201cThe number of intruders skyrocketed, then?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Su Qianqian nodded, and her eyes reddened. \u201cMy father, he died fighting\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019d been him carrying the sword, he wouldn\u2019t have died. He had prepared for so long\u2026\u201dThe sword then hummed, and the surrounding temperature dropped sharply. Xu Xiaoshou then patted her on the head to comfort her.\u201cEveryone has their own encounters, be they good or bad.\u201cThe sword has chosen you, so you\u2019re destined to bear more on your shoulders. Don\u2019t get saddened over it.\u201dHe was overcome with emotion.Such is the workings of fate. Whether you\u2019re prepared or not, when it comes, it comes.There\u2019s no point dwelling in the past.Whether you can endure and survive it and make it into something that will benefit you is what should occupy your thoughts.The same thing had happened to him and to Su Qianqian.He wondered if the others would catch, dissect, or study him if they ever discovered this thing in his mind or somehow realized that something was off with him.Xu Xiaoshou then shuddered and thought about Elder Sang and that masked man.The pattern was already there!However, the thing in his head was still concealed, in a manner of speaking, and even if someone did detect that something was wrong with him, he could still brush the anomalies over with words like \u201cgenius,\u201d \u201chard work,\u201d or whatnot.Yet things were different with Su Qianqian.The wielders of famed swords\u2026That was an identity that would forever remain known to the public. What she had to face and take on was the greed of the entire world of spiritual cultivation.Perhaps, instead of being called \u201cfate,\u201d this should be called \u201ckarma\u201d instead.Some people were indeed fated from birth to carry certain things on their shoulders.Xu Xiaoshou then hugged the girl to comfort her, but this meant something else in the eyes of the spectators.\u201cSh**! Xu Xiaoshou\u2026 you animal!\u201d\u201cSu Qianqian is still a child! How could you do this to her!?\u201d\u201cNo, Xu Xiaoshou, stop! You\u2019re not a member of the Inner Yard yet! How could you do such a thing to a female disciple of the Inner Yard?\u201d\u201cArrggghh! I wanna be hugged like that too\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou then awkwardly let go of her, and she also blushed.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get to the skies. Those mortals\u2026\u201dHe waved and put the Reverse Sword Subduing to work and took to the skies.Everyone watched as the two of them flew higher and higher. They were all left feeling puzzled.\u201cYou\u2019re dissing us because we can\u2019t fly, huh?\u201d they thought.\u201cD*mn you, Xu Xiaoshou!\u201dCursed, Passive Points +112.Resented, Passive Points +69.\u201c\u2026\u201dBoth of them chatted as they flew, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to almost reach the Inner Yard.Su Qianqian then left. She had fulfilled the goal of her trip\u2014telling her Brother Xiaoshou to beware of the ones from the Inner Yard\u2014after all.The Passive Points accumulated in his mind had already exceeded the 5000 mark by the time he sent her away.He gleefully landed on the ground.He realized that this was definitely quite a way of earning points. Although he wouldn\u2019t have much of any fight to fight in the future, he could still get to the streets to earn points.His being able to fly alone had already earned the envy of a good number of people from the Outer Yard.Because none of them knew how to fly.He thought of something else and stood looking at the gate of the Inner Yard for a long time.Nothing was extraordinary about that gate. It had no barriers, and no one was guarding it, as there was simply no need to.The law had it that disciples of the Outer Yard weren\u2019t allowed inside, and any who was discovered doing so would suffer harsh penalties.Yet, Xu Xiaoshou stepped inside all the same.That one step made him felt like he\u2019d crossed into a different world. The concentration of spiritual energy was very high. But, having upgraded his Breathing Technique to Innate level, it didn\u2019t phase him.Instead, he felt ticklish all over.It felt comfortable yet uncomfortable at the same time.That was the very reason why he was extremely reluctant to upgrade the Breathing Technique, as a change in his living space meant having to get used to everything all over again.However, he deemed that it was important to accept all of it.He clenched his fists and did his best to hang on.Ahh~He still was unable to bear with it.He immediately felt a lot better after he moaned and released his tension.He relaxed, and he recalled the scene when he\u2019d bowed to Elder Sang as his master, the sun rising in the east in the background.It felt dreamy and unreal.Elder Sang lived up to his reputation as an extremely peculiar person. Right after the ritual, the elder had set up rules.First, Xu Xiaoshou was forbidden to call him \u201cmaster.\u201dSecond, he wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone else about the relationship between the two of them.Third, he had to look for Elder Sang once at the Spiritual Library Division within three days.Xu Xiaoshou was completely fine with the first two rules, but it was the third one that was giving him a headache.He started to get restless as soon as he thought of having to see that old fart on his own accord, even though Elder Sang had become his master.Yet, said old fart had made that a rule nonetheless, which spoke volumes of its importance.However, if Xu Xiaoshou were to just do according to his own wishes, hiding in his place to build his house in secret, said old fart would come looking for him and that would be the end of him.\u201cWhatever. The sooner I get it done, the sooner I can put it behind me. I\u2019ll make the order at the Spiritual Affairs Division after I see Elder Sang.\u201dHe quickened his steps as he thought about this, and it took him mere moments to reach that unassuming, rustic three-storied building.The Spiritual Library Division.The barrier had already been opened by the time he got close, and the door was wide open.Xu Xiaoshou was feeling rather impressed. \u201cYou knew I was here without having to see for yourself, huh?\u201d he thought.He steeled himself and walked into the place.There were the familiar shelves as soon as he walked onto the first floor.He touched them as he walked past.\u201cGet to the third floor,\u201d an exasperated voice was heard in his mind.Third floor?Xu Xiaoshou took a book out and shook it for a bit. As expected, there was nothing.He recalled how, the last time he was there, Xiao Qixiu had emphasized that they were not allowed to go to the third floor, which made the third floor very mysterious to him.He\u2019d initially thought that the place held Master Level spiritual techniques, but from the looks of things, he wondered if that was where Elder Sang lived.\u201cWell, a floor reserved specifically for the caretaker doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal,\u201d he thought.Tap, tap, tap.He walked briskly up to the second floor and was immediately attracted by the halos.During his last visit, he was so obedient that he\u2019d stayed on the first floor and hadn\u2019t so much as even batted an eye at the second floor.As such, he totally didn\u2019t expect the place to look like this.No more shelves and only halos instead then\u2026\u201cWhat are these by the way?\u201d he thought.He walked up to them out of curiosity.\u201cThird floor!\u201d the voice in his head firmly rang out again.Xu Xiaoshou was baffled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush, man?\u201d he thought. \u201cLike it\u2019s time for reincarnation on the third floor or what?\u201cThe rules said to look for you in three days.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you let me read the books for two days before that instead?\u201cI\u2019ve been a human in two lives, and this is the only time I\u2019ve been so studious.\u201dIt went without saying that he didn\u2019t dare to say any of this out loud.He quickly walked to the third floor afterward.\u201cComing up now!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: This is an Alchemy Cauldron!\u201cOld man?\u201dHe poked his head around the door of the third floor. He wanted to call said \u201cold man\u201d something else, but didn\u2019t dare to do so.\u201cCome in.\u201dHe then walked inside.\u201cIt\u2019s really cool in here,\u201d was the first thing that came to mind when he walked inside the third floor. It felt completely different from the scorching hot day outside after the rain. The room was so cool that he felt like he was in an air-conditioned room.He looked up.That was a huge red pearl embedded on the top of the third floor. It could also be seen from the outside.It was only then that he understood that the pearl was meant for absorbing heat. The very reason why the third floor was so cool was due to that pearl\u2019s presence.The coolness in the air had a faint fragrance to it.He refocused his sight and saw that there was a super-sized bathtub in the very center of the third floor. It had a very polished exterior and was so big that it could easily accommodate ten people inside of it.It was also so tall that he figured that he wasn\u2019t even half as tall as the tub. A bad feeling washed all over him as he looked at the tub.He wanted very much to just turn around and run, yet he didn\u2019t dare to do so.It was due to his Sense that he saw that Elder Sang was actually sitting cross-legged and hovering midair on the other side of the tub.He scratched his head. What was the old man doing?It was then that he saw the old man pick up a bunch of fauna with high spiritual content and dump them all into the tub.Yeah, over a dozen berries or whatnot as well, with the branches still attached and all.Crackle, crackle.He heard this very familiar sound.Infernal Heavenly Flames? He seemed to realize something.It was only after he did his best to Sense it that he was just barely able to make out the silhouette of a massive bonfire right beneath the bathtub.\u201cJust what kind of Infernal Heavenly Flames is this?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I immediately detect its presence? Gosh, this is horrifying.\u201cBut, well, the fire is just cooking the bathtub without any water in it, so it couldn\u2019t be used for bathing, right?\u201cThe old man is still dumping ingredients into it. Just what is he trying to do here?\u201d\u201cElder Sang?\u201d He called.\u201cShut up and just watch.\u201d Elder Sang\u2019s eyes remained closed, and he was very focused.Xu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but carefully observe what he was doing. He wondered if this was a test of some kind and if he would be quizzed at the end of it.The possibility was high!Bosses love doing weird stuff just to scare people, after all.He was very experienced with such ways of doing things, as he did the exact same thing to scare Su Qianqian.\u201cBut, um\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cWhy does something feel wrong about all this?\u201dHe was able to Sense that all of the fauna was immediately cooked and burned to nothing by the super high temperatures of the Infernal Heavenly Flames as soon as the old man dumped them inside, yet several drops of extracts of some kind remained behind nonetheless.Just how precise did one\u2019s control have to be to be able to do such a thing?Someone could actually extract such condensed energies when using flames as unforgiving as the Infernal Heavenly Flames?Xu Xiaoshou figured that if he were in Elder Sang\u2019s place, he probably would\u2019ve burned the entire library building down, let alone extract the essence of those things.As more and more fauna were dumped into the tub, the amount of extracts accumulating in the tub increased, yet they remained separated.The space inside was so huge that they would never get clumped together.Hold on!The extracts were actually beginning to fuse. Such a huge blob of liquid\u2026Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes flew open. He found the situation to be both wrong yet somewhat familiar.Boooom!A rumble was heard as the bathtub trembled. The blob of liquid, which was somewhat bigger than a head, instantly solidified, turning into a greyish black ball.Crack!The black ball cracked, and a thick herbal fragrance filled the room. He instantly shuddered and almost failed to shut it out and suck all of it in.He covered his nose and mouth, as well as shut all of his pores, right away.Brrooooom.Pills started to pour all over the bathtub and roll over to an opening at the bottom, getting inside a huge bottle that had been attached beforehand.From the sound of it, there were more than ten of them.Xu Xiaoshou was shocked to the core.Alchemy at work here?He looked at the super-sized tub and then at the three legs below the tub, and his jaw almost dropped to the floor as realization dawned on him.A-an alchemy cauldron?Elder Sang opened his eyes and looked at the young man before him, who was inexplicably covering his nose. Then he took out a pill and smelled it.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stink. What are you covering your nose for?\u201d\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s nothing.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou put his hands down and adjusted his posture.\u201cLuckily I didn\u2019t suck it all in,\u201d he thought. \u201cJust an impulse and all those 30 or so pills would have\u2026\u201dHe shuddered at the thought.Elder Sang packed up the pills and asked, \u201cSo, what did you learn?\u201dXu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. His tone was full of nothing but disbelief as he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re doing alchemy here?\u201dElder Sang stopped what he was doing, then gave the young man a disbelieving look. \u201cYou stood there watching for so long and that\u2019s all you were able to tell?\u201d he asked in shock.\u201cI was asking you about the method of alchemy, man!\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat were you looking at all this time, old man?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all, of course!\u201d he quickly added.That one line from Xu Xiaoshou made the old man wearing a conical hat somewhat relieved.He then looked at Xu Xiaoshou with anticipation.The way he saw it, that young man before his eyes was talented, resilient, so excellent in all aspects that he could even be deemed exceptional.While his talents weren\u2019t exceedingly rare, they were nonetheless still very, very rare.Someone who was capable of developing Innate Sword Will couldn\u2019t fail to see what he was doing here.However, Xu Xiaoshou just went on to point at that cauldron before his eyes and declared loudly, \u201cThis is actually an alchemy cauldron!\u201dThump!Clangggg.Elder Sang was caught off-guard and dropped to the ground, knocking over several smaller bottles on the ground and causing the pills to spill all over.\u201cAre you blind? What else could it be but an alchemy cauldron!?\u201d Elder Sang yelled.Xu Xiaoshou immediately shirked back. \u201cBut how would anyone be able to tell that just by looking at it?\u201d he thought. \u201cDo such ginormous and weird alchemy cauldrons even exist in the first place?\u201cIt\u2019s so tall and so big\u2026\u201cForget, I just take it that you have special preferences and you like these types.\u201cBut just take a look at the outside of the cauldron. So white, so smooth\u2026\u201cWhere did you buy such a cauldron in the first place? What made you buy such a thing?\u201cThere isn\u2019t even a single carving on this thing! This is but a super bathtub with three legs on it, okay? Gosh, this is hilarious!Despite his ill thoughts about the cauldron, he didn\u2019t dare to say anything out loud, nonetheless. He simply replied weakly, \u201cI initially thought that this was a bathtub\u2026\u201d\u201cA bathtub?\u201dElder Sang was already fuming by this point.\u201cYou good-for-nothing of a student!\u201d he thought. \u201cAre you trying to p*ss me off to death on the very first day of your lessons?\u201dHe suppressed his anger and took a look at the cauldron. The more he looked at it, the more he found the kid\u2019s description to be apt.Ptuih!\u201cThis is the special cauldron required for us of the Infernal lineage to perform alchemy. We cast away all the unnecessary flamboyance and crafted it using the most heat-resistant rocks.\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve realized the power of the Infernal Heavenly Flames by now. Not even the Spirit Crystals were able to last for a second under its might. If this cauldron had been made out of anything else, it would have melted before the pills were completed.\u201cBy the way, the cauldron may be ugly, yet it would cost over 10 times the price of a cauldron of similar sizes.\u201d Elder Sang felt rather exhausted as he explained.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThat awesome, huh?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Pride was heard in Elder Sang\u2019s tone again.Xu Xiaoshou then touched the wall of the cauldron, feeling impressed that despite the session having ended mere moments ago, its temperatures had completely returned to normal.He then knocked on the cauldron. The clangs were thick and sturdy\u2014a sign that the cauldron was indeed sturdy.He was still wearing an awed expression when he turned around and asked, \u201cI guessdropping such a sturdy cauldron on someone would hurt like h*ll, right?\u201dElder Sang was baffled.He stared at the young man in puzzlement briefly, before the vein in his forehead started to bulge out.\u201cXu Xiaoshou!\u201d\u201cShut the f**k up!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was shocked, and he wondered why the old man was so riled up.Andropause?Requested, Passive Points +1.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Meeting GiftXu Xiaoshou obediently shut his mouth.Why were people these days so prone to anger?Elder Sang glowered at him before picking up the overturned bottle, the pills spilling all over the floor, before packing them inside the bottle. He then pushed the bottle to Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cConsider this a meeting gift.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes widened, and he asked with a puzzled look, \u201cFor me?\u201d\u201cYou see anyone else in the room?\u201d Elder Sang rolled his eyes. \u201c36 Origin Court Pills, fitting the number of heavenly spirits. Quite an auspicious number.\u201d\u201cOrigin Court Pills?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know them?\u201d Elder Sang noted the puzzled look on the kid\u2019s face and then asked, \u201cYou at least know the Spiritual Cultivation Pill, right?\u201d\u201cEvery single major level has a corresponding medicine for speeding up training. The pills are basically the most precious thing in said levels. Spiritual Cultivation Pills are meant for those still in the ten Spiritual Cultivation levels.\u201d\u201cAnd one more thing. Two grades make up one major level. Spiritual Cultivation Pills are considered at Acquired Level, which places them at ninth grade.\u201dXu Xiaoshou then pointed at the bottles on the ground. \u201cSo these are\u2026\u201d\u201cInnate level ones. Seventh-grade.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s jaw almost dropped to the floor.Elder Sang chuckled and said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201dBut before he was able to finish, the young man before him bowed, and his necklace appeared. The bottles on the ground were gone in an instant. \u201cThank you very much!\u201dElder Sang was baffled. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d he thought.\u201cThis kid really is\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd here I was na\u00efve enough to think that he\u2019d actually be reluctant.\u201dHe was definitely na\u00efve to think that.There was just no way Xu Xiaoshou would\u2019ve been reluctant to accept it. He\u2019d simply been shocked earlier. That was all.He\u2019d been shocked to find that seventh-grade pills were actually crafted en masse. Didn\u2019t it cost money to make these things?He felt like he was in a dream.He figured that all the Spiritual Cultivation Pills stockpiled in his ring were worth less than a single Origin Pill.Seventh-grade pills, man\u2026\u201cI only got one single Innate Pill after becoming the champion of the Wind and Cloud Contest, and that thing was just an eighth-grade pill,\u201d he thought to himself.Elder Sang didn\u2019t seem to mind. So long as he had enough ingredients to spare, it would only take him mere hours to cook up more.\u201cThose should last you for quite some time,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, though. Try not to use them before reaching Innate Level. They might overwhelm you.\u201d\u201cBut, hmm, you have Innate Level Physique. Whatever, you figure it out yourself.\u201dHe waved. \u201cCome and get more when you\u2019ve run out.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was stunned.\u201cCome and get more when I\u2019ve run out?\u201d he thought.\u201cSuch extravagance!\u201d\u201cMe likey!\u201dElder Sang saw the greedy look on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cNo need to be surprised. If there\u2019s one thing Alchemists are never lacking in, it\u2019s medicine. It\u2019ll be the same for you one day, so get used to it.\u201dXu Xiaoshou nodded, his face deadpan.Truth be told, he\u2019d had little interest in alchemy before, but Elder Sang prompting him to pick it up had motivated him.\u201cThis is one h*ll of a way to get rich!\u201d he thought.\u201cPassive Points are important, but no way would I skimp out on gaining material wealth!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, those two things seem to go hand in hand anyway.\u201dHe imagined just how many looks of awe and admiration he would receive if he was able to whip out tens of bottles of pills just like that one day in the future.Tsk, tsk!He felt like he was about to salivate.However, it didn\u2019t take him long to realize one key problem\u2014\u201dI don\u2019t actually have much talent. Will I be able to master alchemy?\u201dElder Sang then answered dismissively, \u201cYou don\u2019t actually need to learn much. Your talents are enough for you to master it soon enough.\u201dSomeone capable of developing Innate Sword Will being of inferior talents?Elder Sang chuckled and thought just how pretentious this disciple of his was.Xu Xiaoshou, \u201c\u2026..\u201dHe had no idea why the old man had so much confidence in him, but Elder Sang was a veteran, which meant he definitely saw something in him that he\u2019d never noticed himself.Yeah.That was definitely it!Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s get to it!\u201dElder Sang was pleased to see that his disciple was so motivated. He nodded and added, \u201cBefore we begin, there\u2019s still one more thing.\u201d\u201cAlchemy of the Infernal lineage is different from that of other alchemists, which is something I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware of.\u201d\u201cDue to the overbearing power of the Infernal Heavenly Flames, we\u2019re just as violent and uncaring them with the processes of our alchemy, so much so that you could say that we have no techniques at all. The only thing to be mindful of is precise control of the flames.\u201dXu Xiaoshou gestured that he understood.Earlier, he\u2019d watched as Elder Sang dumped the herbs in such large batches that he didn\u2019t even bother dumping the berries in one by one when performing alchemy.Anyone who wasn\u2019t in the know would\u2019ve wondered if the elder was trying to make soup.Any of the other alchemists would\u2019ve immediately shouted in frustration.But the elder controlled the flames with impeccable precision, which enabled him to instantly separate the ingredients yet cook them all at the same time.This alone allowed him to drastically reduce the time needed for extracting the essences, which also affected the number of pills he could craft in one go.The number was incredibly high.Elder Sang put his hands behind his back and walked to the side of the window before adding sincerely and seriously, \u201cAlchemy is but a side job. It can bring you immense wealth, but remember never to be engrossed in it.\u201d\u201cSpiritual Cultivation training is the main path you need to walk in the future. That much should never, ever change.\u201dHe turned around and stared at Xu Xiaoshou with his dark-circled eyes. \u201cIf your powers are unable to keep up, the better your alchemy gets, and the worse your life will become. Never forget that!\u201dXu Xiaoshou couldn\u2019t help but recall their first lesson when the two of them officially became master and disciple. \u201cThe cage again?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dElder Sang nodded and added, \u201cIf such a thing were to happen, unless you were able to stay hidden, you\u2019d be reduced to a mere tool doing alchemy for some huge cultivation forces out there\u2014meaning, you\u2019d completely lose your freedom.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dXu Xiaoshou shuddered somewhat. What kinds of things had the old man gone through for him to have such in-depth knowledge of the world\u2019s brutal reality?\u201cSo you\u2019re staying hidden now?\u201d he then asked.Elder Sang choked and glared at him in exasperation, yet he didn\u2019t retort. \u201cI roam everywhere so as to keep myself from getting caught.\u201dXu Xiaoshou had only asked it out of a whim, not expecting that there really were some forces out there that truly had their sights set on this old man wearing a conical hat. He became rather flustered.\u201cSo I\u2019m in danger now because you became my master?\u201dElder Sang was baffled.Belittled, Passive Points +1.\u201cAt the level you\u2019re at now, you\u2019re not even fit for becoming a pawn! You\u2019re being afraid for nothing!\u201d Elder Sang realized that he needed nerves of steel to talk to this kid.Ridiculed, Passive Points +1.Xu Xiaoshou patted his chest and sighed in relief instead. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear\u2026\u201dElder Sang touched the huge bathtub and said, \u201cUse this thing for now.\u201d\u201cRemember. Alchemy of the Infernal lineage is overwhelmingly powerful. Alchemists of other lineages might not be able to put up a fight, but not us.\u201d\u201cAlchemy is only a secondary goal. The main goal is to have you hone your control of the Infernal Heavenly Flames to perfection through the process of practicing alchemy so that if you ever run into any powerful enemies, you\u2019ll just see them as pills to be cooked.\u201dXu Xiaoshou\u2019s jaw almost dropped to the floor, and after quite some time, the only thing he was able to get out was, \u201cThis is awesome.\u201dElder Sang threw a ring at him. \u201cWhen you go about extracting the essences later, put all of your focus into controlling the flames. No need to think about anything else.\u201d\u201cYour next goal is to use up all the ingredients in this ring to extract just a single drop of essence.\u201d\u201cThere is a jade scroll, on which is all the common knowledge of alchemy. Remember to check that out first.\u201d\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be off, then. Take your time.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was about to say something else, but Elder Sang disappeared from where he was standing.He looked at the massive tub, feeling speechless.\u201cSo I\u2019m all on my own now?\u201d he thought.\u201cYou let me watch you do it once and then thought I was good to do it all on my own?\u201d\u201cYou really think that I\u2019m some kind of genius?\u201dHe took a look at the ring and immediately slumped to the floor.The number of herbs pilling up like mountains inside it was extremely overwhelming, and he wondered if that many herbs could\u2019ve filled the entire first floor of the library.He realized why the elder would leave him to work at it.If he were to finish using up what was inside the ring, he\u2019d probably master all he needed to master.Xu Xiaoshou was lacking in many things, but tenacity wasn\u2019t one of them. He gritted his teeth and looked at the massive tub.\u201cLet\u2019s get to it!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Explosions, Beginning from AlchemyA purple jade scroll sat quietly atop the pile of grass in the ring.\u201cLooks rather simple\u2026\u201dWhile there was a lot of common alchemical knowledge elaborated in the jade scroll, more of the contents were about techniques for controlling the flames.Xu Xiaoshou opened his hand and compressed the spiritual source on his palm, causing crackling sounds to erupt.If he didn\u2019t have Sense, that bit of invisible flames would\u2019ve been incredibly difficult for him to control.\u201cCompress the flames as much as possible to about ten times its original size, condensing all of the energy at the center. If it explodes, it\u2019ll bring about terrifying damage\u2026\u201d\u201cUmm, the latter part probably isn\u2019t the main point. The main point should be using the energy of the weakened flames on the outer layer to perform alchemy\u2026\u201dHe recalled the contents of the jade scroll and felt rather intimidated.The Infernal Heavenly Flames were simply too overbearing to be used for alchemy in the first place. He had no idea what the founder was thinking when he\u2019d thought to use something so terrifying for alchemical purposes.Failing to control it would cause it to explode\u2026He glanced at the massive red pearl above his head. The jade scroll said that the pearl was capable of absorbing heat energy, which he speculated should be able to withstand explosions as well.\u201cLet\u2019s try it out, then.\u201dUnder the thrall of his will, the flames in his palm no longer spread their energy outwards. Instead, the energy turned inwards, gradually forming a ball about the size of a human head.But, nonetheless, the scorching heat energy leaked outside, and the ball seemed to grow even more reckless.He clenched his teeth and continued to exert his power over it.Puk!A slight crackle was heard as the ball-shaped bundle of flames the size of a human head was condensed even further and reduced to the size of a fist.Terrifying high temperatures spread, causing the space around it to warp. He was thoroughly baffled.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201cShouldn\u2019t the energy be turned to the innermost core? Why is the temperature so high?\u201dHe looked at the ball-shaped thing in his hand with a confused look, then focused and willed it to move. The ball then spun at high speeds.R-Rasengan?\u201cDamn it, no! This is not the direction I should be taking it!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s expression turned glum.According to the jade scroll, if he could collapse that thing into to the size of a fingernail, all the heat energy would turn inward and become an \u201cextreme flame,\u201d with whatever was left forming a layer called the \u201cresidual flame.\u201dThe residual flame, which was of considerably lower temperature, was what was required, as it could be used for alchemy.But that wasn\u2019t all.Not only did one need to keep the residual flame at a suitable temperature throughout the entire process of alchemy, but one also needed to be wary of that extreme flame condensed to the size of a fingernail.A mishap would result in failing the process and killing the user.He looked at that ball in his hand, feeling like he\u2019d gotten himself into trouble. He was already barely able to keep the ball together, even after condensing it to such a size.His forehead started to break out in beads of sweat, but he clenched his teeth and soldiered through. That ball-shaped flame in his hand flickered twice and instantly collapsed into the size of a fingernail.He was able to tell from his Sense that slivers of formless mist were leaking from it, forming an external layer.Residual flames!I did it!He was overjoyed, but his smile froze the next second.That condensed flame in his hand shuddered unstably twice before stopping altogether.\u201cWell, that was close\u2026\u201cWait, no!\u201cThe energy inside is still fluctuating!\u201cI can\u2019t keep it down anymore!\u201dHis pupils contracted, and his hairs stood on end, and he felt a sense of impending death.He looked up at the red pearl above and wondered if he would end up blowing the library up if he were to fail to keep this thing under control.\u201cCan\u2019t wait to see if that happens!\u201dHe went to the window and threw the thing into the sky outside.Boom!An explosive rumble was heard in midair. Raging, majestic and scorching energy rippled out, thoroughly bombing the air above the library.The currents shot up, and in the fluctuations, he was able to see a vague, near undetectable super mushroom cloud forming.\u201cWhat the f**!\u201dXu Xiaoshou was baffled. \u201cYou call this alchemy?\u201cThis is a super attack like no other!\u201cHave I just created yet another terrifying spiritual technique after the four moves of Fleeting White Clouds?\u201cWorse still, this is large area-of-effect damage that would attack anyone indiscriminately.\u201dHe immediately got excited. While it was extremely difficult to keep such a compressed fire seed stable, making it unstable was, on the other hand, as easy as could be.He then checked his energy reserve, finding that the compressed bit of flames of the size of a fingernail had actually drained about 30 percent of his reserves.However, his High Spirits enabled him to regenerate the depleted spiritual source to about 80 percent, and he deemed that his reserve would be full again in a matter of minutes.\u201cHow about going wild for a bit, eh?\u201dHe opened both of his hands, drained about half of his spiritual source, and conjured two balls of formless flames on his hands.Crackle, crackle!Compress, compress even more\u2026Without breaking a sweat, he condensed the flames into a ball the size of a fingernail.However, the energy within was even more raging than the one before, as he no longer bothered to keep them controlled.Swoop!Swoop!He flung his hands, and the two formless bits of flames shot to the skies and rammed into each other.Boooom!The explosive effect was more than just the culmination of the two bits. He was already able to see the protective barrier around the library materializing, seemingly being out to nullify the raging, scorching energies.That was just the aftershock!If he were to throw several of these at the library\u2026\u201cEhem, no, no, no, can\u2019t afford to think like that,\u201d he thought.But just imagine\u2026If he were surrounded by a massive army, yet just casually rose riding his sword and then kept compressing this thing using High Spirits, then threw one out one after another\u2026Would that make him a living bomber, then?Just how much admiration and resentment would he learn from that alone?\u201cOhohoho\u2026\u201dHis eyes narrowed to slits. He\u2019d initially come here to learn to make pills, yet now he seemed to have ended up creating an extremely terrifying attack instead.\u201cRight, I have to name it.\u201d\u201cAll four moves of the Fleeting White Clouds have names, so I couldn\u2019t just call this thing \u2018compressed fire seed,\u2019 right?\u201cIt\u2019s small, it\u2019s condensed from a ball, it\u2019s of fire element\u2026\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll just call it the \u2018Lesser Fireball,\u2019 then! Perfect!\u201dHe then pulled himself away from the window, dusted his hands off with satisfaction, and then looked at that massive tub standing on three legs.\u201cSigh, gone off-course again. Alchemy, get back to alchemy\u2026\u201d\u2026Zhao Xidong had a blade of grass in his mouth as he cradled the back of his head with both hands and leisurely took a stroll.After sending He Yuxing to the Tribunal, he had nothing else to do.As for Su Qianqian carving a place inside the Inner Yard\u2026Well, he guessed that scuffles like that didn\u2019t matter in the Inner Yard so long as no one died. He\u2019d turn a blind eye to it, and the whole thing would blow over.A rumble was heard in the sky at that moment.Boom!A wave of terrifying heat energy exploded in the sky not far away. His pupils contracted.That was\u2026The library!He recalled the case of the masked invader from the previous night and got a bad feeling about things.Booom!An explosion greater than the one before was heard from afar, yet his will allowed him to see that even the barrier protecting the library had materialized.Someone was attacking the library in broad daylight!Just how reckless would one need to be to do such a thing!?He felt very uneasy at that moment. He then took to the skies and shouted,\u201cIntruder!!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: SurroundedSwearing to himself that he would never again deviate from the work at hand, Xu Xiaoshou went back to sit in front of that massive tub and dedicated himself to making alchemy work.\u201cSince I couldn\u2019t control that compressed fire seed the size of a fingernail, I guess I\u2019ll have to resort to the next best thing: using rasen\u2026 ehem, a fireball for doing alchemy.\u201dHe grasped, and a ball-shaped flame appeared on his hand, which he then threw into the tub.It took mere seconds for that milky white tub to turn red hot and the temperature to rise exponentiallyHe then recalled how Elder Sang had dumped the herbs into the tub earlier like they cost nothing. As such, he went on to grab a bunch of herbs from the ring and dumped them into the tub.Fzzzz!All of the herbs were reduced to dust while they were still midair. There was no extract to be had. Not even ash was left!Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.\u201cSure enough, the temperature is too high.\u201cThese are flames capable of outright evaporating spirit crystals, after all.\u201cFurthermore, I lack the prowess of the elder, who was capable of separating the herbs.\u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to do it one by one, then.\u201dHe willed for the flames to be at a level that he could control before compressing.A bundle was thrown inside.Fzzz.\u201cStill won\u2019t do, eh?\u201dHe didn\u2019t continue doing this. He wasn\u2019t impulsive. While the supply of herbs was massive, simply dumping them without a care would be too wasteful, so he needed to come to some other conclusion.Well\u2026There was no conclusion to be had. The temperature of the flames was still too high, after all.\u201cHow should I go about lowering its temperature?\u201dHe stroked his chin and furrowed his brown before suddenly coming to a realization.\u201cIf the temperature is still too high, how about I just suck it up with Breathing Technique, then?\u201cI\u2019m so smart!\u201dHe high-fived himself. Such a way of doing things was workable, as exhalation from Breathing Technique could be used for more than just training.He opened his pores, and the heat was sucked into his body. That ball-shaped flame beneath the tub no longer looked as menacing.He Sensed heat rising and started to sweat all over, but it was still well within his limits.Unlike when he\u2019d refined the Infernal Fire Seed, this little spike in temperature didn\u2019t even manage to cause his Information Bar to pop up with a message saying that he was being attacked.He then threw another bundle into the tub.The next one landed perfectly inside. It hovered in the tub per the effects of the spiritual source, yet it took less than a second for the bundle to be reduced to nothing.Hmm\u2026He stopped what he was doing, finding his method to be unsustainable.He realized that he\u2019d never be able to keep the heat energy he was sucking into his body at a constant rate. The temperature of the flames would always fluctuate. Such temperatures could never be used for alchemy.However, given that he couldn\u2019t do anything else, he had to just keep trying.\u201cPractice makes perfect.\u201cAlchemy is indeed about precision, and that old fart\u2019s right. I could indeed become able to control my powers with precision throughout the process.\u201dHe took out a bundle, but a message popped up in his Information bar before he was able to throw it in the tub.Surrounded, Passive Points +1.\u201cHuh?\u201cSurrounded?\u201dHe was momentarily startled, and checked his surroundings, but found no one to be around.\u201cWait, outside then?\u201cSomeone\u2019s surrounded the library?\u201dHe recalled that masked figure from last night, and his skin crawled. It left him wondering if someone was trying to attack the library in broad daylight.How did they manage to get inside the Tiansang Spirit Palace?He then put the herbs away and took two ball-shaped flames in his hand, getting ready to throw the \u2018Lesser Fireball.\u2019 He sneaked to the window and peeked outside.Sh**!So many of them!Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.A massive number of personnel clad in black stretched as far as the eye could see, completely surrounding the library in three inner layers and three outer layers.\u201cHold on\u2026\u201cBlack attire?\u201cAren\u2019t these people the enforcers from the Spiritual Law Division?\u201dHe was rather exasperated. He pushed the window open and saw someone step out of the group.That person looked rather familiar.That referee from that group match back then?He opened his eyes wide and rubbed them, then looked outside again, immediately meeting the man\u2019s gaze.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dBoth of them uttered at the same time.Zhao Xidong was completely baffled, and he realized that all the plans he\u2019d made were now null and void.Xu Xiaoshou?How could it be him?Wait, no, how did this guy manage to get inside the library?\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he thought. \u201cIsn\u2019t he still a disciple of the Outer Yard? I should say, how dare he sneak inside the Inner Yard.\u201cAnd wait\u2026 the explosions. He had something to do with those too?\u201cImpossible!\u201cThat\u2019s Xu Xiaoshou for you, man!\u201dDoubted, Passive Points +1.Doubted, Passive Points +1.Doubted, Passive Points +1.\u201c\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou was pleased. He looked at the referee without saying anything, yet he kept asking him to say more deep down.\u201cCome on, put that imagination of yours to work.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on inside your head, but I\u2019m not gonna stop you from thinking.\u201cThinking is what enables humans to progress.\u201dZhao Xidong saw that the young man was all silent. He then recalled that said young man had also killed Feng Kong and Shao Yi, as well as the unexpected results of the matches.Was he really the cause of the explosions?He wasn\u2019t the only one who was confused. Every enforcer present was just as confused as he was.A good number of them knew Xu Xiaoshou, not just because of his peculiar performances back in the Wind and Cloud Contest but, more importantly, from that fight last night. That young man was the only one there at Acquired Level training, yet he was the focus of the whole ordeal.Doubted, Passive Points +169Doubted, Passive Points +112Doubted, Passive Points +84\u201c\u2026\u201dAwesome!Xu Xiaoshou stood at the window, clenching his fists a little. Just that one meeting of their eyes had enabled his accumulated points to reach almost 6000.Zhao Xidong was tired of waiting and asked, \u201cYou were the one responsible for that explosion back there?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He supported his chin with both hands as he rested his elbows on the window sill. \u201cRelax. The library is fine. You can all leave.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dEveryone was dumbfounded. It was fine when he wasn\u2019t saying anything! What he said flustered them.Doubted, Passive Points +266.Xu Xiaoshou was pleased. He found that for some reason, every time he told the truth, no one believed him, which meant there was no need for him to lie.\u201cWhy are you in the library, and on the third floor at that?\u201dZhao Xidong was flustered. \u201cThat\u2019s off-limits to you! Get down here at once! It\u2019s already a grave enough offense for a disciple of the Outer Yard to enter the Inner Yard without permission, and you\u2026 you dare to trespass in the library?\u201d\u201cElder Sang summoned me,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou answered.Doubted, Passive Points +266.Everyone immediately doubted this, yet when they recalled that Elder Sang had indeed saved him the previous night, they all of a sudden thought it was indeed possible.Whatever. The Passive Points were in.\u201cWhy did Elder Sang summon you?\u201d Zhao Xidong was curious.\u201cAlchemy.\u201dDoubted, Passive Points +267.Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He saw yet another enforcer come onto the scene, joining the army of point-givers.Zhao Xidong then chuckled out of frustration. \u201cAlchemy, you say?\u201d he thought.\u201cSh**, you think I\u2019m gonna buy that! I can\u2019t believe you actually said Elder Sang summoned you!\u201cFurthermore, is alchemy really something a guy at level nine like you should be doing?\u201cYou don\u2019t even have an Innate Elemental Trait! What are you gonna do alchemy with, huh?Woodfire?\u201cWhat a joke!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s Been Kidnapped!Zhao Xidong couldn\u2019t be bothered wasting time talking to Xu Xiaoshou and running around in circles. The good news was he didn\u2019t understand what the other man was talking about.But this wasn\u2019t Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s problem. It was Zhao Xidong\u2019s.He decided to cut to the chase. \u201cSpill it. What caused the explosion?\u201dXu Xiaoshou lightly tapped his finger on the windowsill, his face emotionless.\u201cAn experiment.\u201dZhao Xidong\u2019s lips twitched. His face darkened, then paled, then darkened again.An experiment? So Xu Xiaoshou was the one who\u2019d caused the explosion, then.\u201cWhat kind of experiment?\u201d Zhao Xidong asked.\u201cAn experiment on Lesser Fireball.\u201dXu Xiaoshou eyed the two fireballs on his palm before quietly extinguishing them. He wasn\u2019t going to need them, after all.Everyone else was stupefied.\u2026a Lesser Fireball?Did Xu Xiaoshou really just tell them that a Lesser Fireball had caused that terrible explosion?Did he think they were idiots?Suspected, Passive Points +275.Zhao Xidong took a deep breath and suppressed the agitation that was bubbling inside him. \u201cGet down here,\u201d he huffed. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201dThey were talking right now, weren\u2019t they?Xu Xiaoshou ignored Zhao Xidong\u2019s orders. He could faintly sense the murderous rage coming from them.He had killed three men, after all.\u201cDoes that mean\u2026you can\u2019t get in?\u201d At that moment, it hit Xu Xiaoshou that this was the Spiritual Library Division. They might be law enforcers, but they probably didn\u2019t have the authority to force their way into the Spiritual Library Division.In fact, they couldn\u2019t have forced their way in if they\u2019d wanted to.The Spiritual Library Division was the foundation upon which the Tiansang Spirit Palace rested. Its security measures could probably keep powerful men like the masked figure out. It wasn\u2019t a place that the average law enforcer could barge into.Elder Sang had let him in, which was how he\u2019d been able to enter the Spiritual Library Division in the first place.\u201cIt was just a small experiment\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou eyed the look of hostility in the men\u2019s eyes and attempted to appease them. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dThe look on Zhao Xidong\u2019s face was absolutely stormy.If this were anyone else, he wouldn\u2019t have been worried. But this was Xu Xiaoshou they were talking about!It was Xu Xiaoshou!An absolute troublemaker!How could he not be worried?\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get down here first\u2026\u201dThese men didn\u2019t seem convinced by Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s words, and they weren\u2019t giving him any Passive Points at all. Xu Xiaoshou lost all desire to continue the conversation.They were preventing him from cultivating his pills and were wasting his precious time.He went back into the room and rummaged around. This was Elder Sang\u2019s private quarters, and it was filled with plenty of stuff that wasn\u2019t exactly valuable or important.\u201cI found it!\u201dIt didn\u2019t take Xu Xiaoshou long to locate a dark red token. This should grant him the necessary authority.He walked back to the window and raised the token. \u201cBy the orders of Elder Sang, you are hereby dismissed!\u201dZhao Xidong stared at the young man. The image of Su Qianqian brandishing the same token popped up in his head. They were cut from the same cloth!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he paused suddenly.Hold on a second.That fellow had been behaving oddly since the beginning, going on about an experiment and playing with the Lesser Fireball\u2026He wouldn\u2019t be joking with them without a reason.That explosion hadn\u2019t been an illusion. It had happened. Pill cultivation couldn\u2019t have led to such a huge explosion.Something wasn\u2019t right.Besides, Xu Xiaoshou was only at Level Nine. He shouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate pills at all!Zhao Xidong\u2019s pupils contracted. Xu Xiaoshou had been trying to tell them something right from the start\u2026That must be it.He hadn\u2019t caused the explosion. Someone else had.Xu Xiaoshou\u2026\u2026was being held captive!His kidnapper was the one who had unleashed that terrible attack!The thought of it was terrifying!Zhao Xidong extended his spiritual senses but failed to identify anything suspicious in the vicinity. His eyes fell on the Spiritual Library Division again.The answer was staring them right in the face.The kidnapper was also in the Spiritual Library Division.In fact, he might be hiding behind Xu Xiaoshou right now, threatening and terrorizing the latter into convincing Zhao Xidong and the others to leave.\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s why Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s desperately trying to send us away\u2026\u201dZhao Xidong was convinced that he was right, and everything else that had been bothering him now made perfect sense.\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +1.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou stared dumbly at Zhao Xidong and wondered what crazy thoughts were going through that man\u2019s head right now.He was rewarded with a series of strange gestures.He stared as Zhao Xidong stuck one finger out, wiggled it, then raised his other hand and placed it behind the first\u2026The man blinked and gave him a questioning look.What did he want? Xu Xiaoshou was baffled.He didn\u2019t understand any of Zhao Xidong\u2019s gestures. As for that blink\u2026\u2026he had no idea what that meant either.That didn\u2019t stop him from blinking back. \u201cLeave right now!\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect a look of dawning realization to appear on Zhao Xidong\u2019s face\u2026What was going on?Zhao Xidong seemed to be staring at his back.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dBefore Xu Xiaoshou could comprehend what was going on, the former judge flicked his wrist. Everyone around him stilled suddenly, then vanished the next moment\u2026What the h*ll was going on?Xu Xiaoshou was utterly bewildered.\u2026He wasn\u2019t the only one who was confused. The majority of the law enforcers who had left also had no idea why Zhao Xidong had issued the order for a retreat.\u201cI thought there was an attack. Why are we leaving?\u201d someone asked.Zhao Xidong seemed to be in a hurry. \u201cHurry up. I need you to find Boss Xiao while I locate Elder Sang. We need the both of them. We have to move quickly if we want to save him!\u201d\u201cSave who?\u201dZhao Xidong came to a stop, then tilted his head and stared at the man who had voiced the question.\u201cHaven\u2019t you realized?\u201cSomeone\u2019s kidnapped Xu Xiaoshou. He\u2019s being held captive!\u201d\u2026Slam!Xu Xiaoshou shut the windows.He walked back to the bathtub, sat down, and ground his teeth in frustration.He should have expected this. As soon as one had the slightest intention to work hard on something, trouble would come knocking at one\u2019s door and attempt to ruin everything.\u201cI can\u2019t be distracted. I have to focus on cultivating my pills!\u201dHe got his herbs out and repeated what he\u2019d done previously, attempting repeatedly to fuse his Breathing Technique with the burning ball of flames.Poof!Poof!Poof\u2026His consecutive failed attempts doused the excitement that had been burning inside him. Xu Xiaoshou wondered if Elder Sang had made a mistake. Perhaps he didn\u2019t have the gift for it.He should have known\u2026He was still the guy who had taken three years to learn the first move of the White Cloud Sword Technique\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true. This probably has something to do with my cultivation level.\u201dXu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t giving up just yet. He wasn\u2019t the sort who gave up that easily.He had acquired Innate Level abilities while his cultivation level was still stuck at the Acquired Stage. While he possessed great power, his control of it was incomplete and flawed.His cultivation level wasn\u2019t up to par. As a result, he couldn\u2019t wield the power he possessed as effortlessly or freely as he should\u2019ve been able to.Xu Xiaoshou fell onto his back and lay down on the floor sullenly. He let his thoughts wander. A red screen appeared in his head.Passive Points: 6442.He had accumulated more than six thousand points\u2026Wouldn\u2019t it be great if he somehow managed to draw a skill that granted him expertise on fire?Xu Xiaoshou was seriously tempted, but then he remembered his increasingly dismal success rate and decided to abandon the idea.He only had six thousand Passive Points. Honestly, the system would devour everything in a single go and still ask for more.He yanked his thoughts back to the present.The rays of the setting sun spilled through the window. As he gazed at the sunset, Xu Xiaoshou could feel his spirits lifting slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I got to unwind and spend time alone with myself\u2026\u201dDuring moments of tranquil solitude, one was often seized by the sudden impulse to do something.Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t thinking when he traded his Passive Points for a Passive Key and slotted the latter in the wheel.With the number of Passive Points that he had right now, he couldn\u2019t level up any skills. It seemed like such a waste to not use them. After all, he might get lucky.He sat up suddenly.He couldn\u2019t see anything.What was going on?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: A Fire in the Spiritual Library Division!Legend had it there was an enormous sacred tree that was rooted in the heavens and grew downward, earthward\u2014the Ashvattha.The laws of the natural world formed the soil from which it drew its nutrients, and the souls of all living creatures were the nourishment it needed to bear fruit.The Ashvattha flowered only once every ninety thousand years, and it bore fruit only once every ninety thousand years.The flesh of the fruit would split wide open, releasing a seed that had the potential to become the next Sun.When Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes, he found himself in a world of scorching red lava. It was a massive world with no end in sight, and it was unbearably hot.The sight of lava bubbling furiously at his feet sent shock coursing through his veins.Before him was a huge, ancient tree hanging upside down with skyward roots and groundward branches.\u201cIs that the Ashvattha?\u201dXu Xiaoshou reeled back in shock, unable to believe his eyes. He was staring at something that belonged in myths and legends.Within a blink of an eye, the sacred tree before him flowered and bore fruit. The fruit shriveled, and its flesh wrinkled, peeling away to reveal a seed.Then, with a soft explosion, a white sun suddenly appeared, was enveloped by a near-invisible shimmer, then plunged to the earth and right inside Xu Xiaoshou.\u201cAh!\u201dWaves of scorching energy flooded his energy reserve, their sheer heat vaporizing the blood in his body. He screamed in agony.Why?How could a mere illusion cause him such pain?It shouldn\u2019t. It hadn\u2019t the last time!He didn\u2019t have time to think at all before he was seized by a sudden revelation. Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes fell shut. When he opened them and gazed upon the world again, he was greeted with the sight of countless red specks of lights hovering in midair.\u201cThe fire element?\u201dHis fingers curled into tight fists. Could it be true?Had his wish been answered?Had he acquired Flame Expertise?Suddenly, he heard the sound of chanting. It was as if the gods themselves were murmuring Sanskrit scriptures into his ear, except these whispers rumbled like deafening thunder, filling his head.Xu Xiaoshou tried to parse the chanting into words, only to realize that his mind had gone completely blank. After a moment\u2019s struggle, he gave up.Out rushed all thoughts and desires, and suddenly, the voice in his head sounded as clear as day.\u201c\u2026the world maketh the cauldron whilst fortune maketh the craft; from yin and yang, firewood for burning, from all things living, iron for smithing\u2026\u201dBoom!Those words struck Xu Xiaoshou like a bolt of lightning. He could hear nothing else after that.Was the voice suggesting that he treat the world as his cauldron and that everything between this heaven and earth could be cultivated?What a terrifying thought!A burst of light suddenly erupted from the lava, and a magical-looking herb floated before Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s eyes.This was the first time he\u2019d laid eyes on such a herb, yet he instantly knew everything about it.\u201cNona-Revival Mustard. An ancient mythical herb. Can be used to revive the dead and regenerate flesh. Extremely spicy. Masks fishy odors well. Can be taken with meat.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was dumbstruck.What the h*ll was going on?A huge black bird flew across the skies, darkening the heavens with its massive shadow. Xu Xiaoshou had never seen such a bird before, yet he instantly knew everything about it.\u201cDivine Black Strix. An ancient mythical monster. Infused with divinity. Delicious. Extremely springy.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was speechless.What the h*ll?The introductory profile to both magical herb and creature had started off fine before going down this strange, descriptive path\u2026The illusory world had appeared so grand and breathtaking. Yet, the sudden appearance of the magical mustard and winged beast had somehow killed the mood.It was then that the Divine Black Strix swooped down on the Nona-Revival Mustard, and Xu Xiaoshou inexplicably reached out his hand\u2026He had no idea why he stuck out his hand. He simply thought that he should\u2026Boom!Invisible Infernal Heavenly Flames shot down from the heavens as the Divine Black Strix clamped its beak shut around the Nona-Revival Mustard. The flames engulfed the divine beast and instantly turned it into dust. A strange fragrance filled the air, and before he knew it, the illusory world started falling apart.\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Xu Xiaoshou was utterly bewildered.The last time he entered the illusory realm, a revelation had seized him, granting him some understanding of swordsmanship. This epiphany had clued him into the kind of Passive Skill he\u2019d gotten then. But this time\u2026Initially, he\u2019d suspected that his new Passive Skill had something to do with fire, but now he wasn\u2019t so sure.The words \u201cextremely spicy\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d popped into his head\u2026They were like demons hounding him. He just couldn\u2019t be rid of them.He immediately looked at the Information Bar.\u201cExpertise Passive Skill acquired: Cooking Expert!\u201dWhat?A look of utter confusion appeared on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s face.Cooking?His eyes widened in disbelief, and his jaw dropped, nearly dislocating his jaw.He\u2019d been spirited away to a magnificent world of molten lava and treated to the sight of the mythical Ashvattha and the birth of a sun. He\u2019d thought that he had hit the jackpot, that he would be rewarded with the Flame Expertise\u2026But instead\u2026\u2026he had acquired culinary skills.What a fine system this was indeed! It was just absolutely fantastic!Xu Xiaoshou fell to his knees with a loud thud, then collapsed into a heap on the floor in a daze, his eyes glazed over.He had waited so long to acquire another Passive Skill only to get this in the end. A lousy skill that wasn\u2019t going to do him any good.\u201cHah! Cooking Expert\u2026\u201dHold on a minute.Something wasn\u2019t right.Why did the floor feel warm?Xu Xiaoshou pulled his thoughts back to the present and sat up. The bathtub had been turned over.He surveyed the room and found it in an utter mess. Its two windows were shattered, as if they\u2019d been blown out by a storm.What was going on?His pupils contracted. He remembered lifting his hand up to summon the sun in his illusion\u2026Had he caused a similar explosion in reality too?Crack! Crack!Xu Xiaoshou unleased Sense upon hearing a familiar sound, and that was when he saw the invisible flames surrounding him.\u201cWhat the h*ll!?\u201d he thought. \u201cDid I set the Spiritual Law Division on fire?Xu Xiaoshou hastily deployed his Breathing Technique and sucked the room clean of fire. He patted his chest and heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cLuckily it\u2019s not that big a\u2026\u201dCrack! Crack!Something sputtered faintly in the distance. Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp prickle. His hair stood on end.He clambered to his feet, then looked down and stared at the floorboards.Were the first and second floors on fire too?\u201cOh my god!\u201dXu Xiaoshou charged downstairs without a second thought.He couldn\u2019t let the place burn.Not when it was filled with manuals of spiritual techniques!He wasn\u2019t ready to die!Somebody, save him!\u2026Meanwhile, outside the Spiritual Library Division.A man dressed in black was hiding in the bushes.Zhao Xidong had assigned him the duty of sentry. He was to keep his eyes on the Spiritual Library Division at all times and inform everyone if he caught sight of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s kidnapper.Yawn\u2026The law enforcer yawned. Honestly, he didn\u2019t see how the kidnapper could\u2019ve sneaked his way into the Spiritual Library Division, but one could never be too careful.His assignment might seem absurd and pointless, but nevertheless, he continued to keep a lookout for anything amiss around the Spiritual Library Division.He felt a sudden rising heat in the air.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHe looked up and stared at the darkening sky. The sun had set. The temperature should be dipping. What was going on?He didn\u2019t have the luxury for leisurely contemplation. The Spiritual Library Division suddenly quaked violently, and the protective barrier around the building lost its cloak of invisibility as it shimmered and rippled angrily.Boom!An explosion louder than the one they had just experienced erupted. The sentry\u2019s face turned pale.He watched as two windows on the third level of the Spiritual Library Division shattered. Shards of splintered wood sprayed into the air while a terrifying, scorching heat surged outward and began to flood the area.The law enforcer was dumbstruck. Had a kidnapper really been hiding in the Spiritual Library Division all along?Was he trying to blow up the Spiritual Library Division?Was he trying to destroy the foundation of the Tiansang Spirit Palace?Crack! Crack!The sound of crackling sputtered all around the law enforcer while grass transformed into scorched earth in a blink of an eye. He was seized by a sharp streak of pain. His spiritual senses instantly unfurled, and he was abruptly greeted by the sight of invisible fire burning all around him.\u201cThere\u2019s been an attack!\u201d he yelled frantically at the top of his voice.It hit him then. This was why Zhao Xidong had been immediately made the leader of their team upon his graduation from the Inner Yard while he was still stuck with sentry duty despite years of service at the Spiritual Law Division.Zhao Xidong now saw what he\u2019d missed.Look!Zhao Xidong had managed to piece everything together from the little that Xu Xiaoshou had said. He, on the other hand, had had to see the Spiritual Law Division blow up with his very own eyes before finally believing what Zhao Xidong had said.Fortunately, Zhao Xidong had already gone to seek reinforcements.It was then that the law enforcer saw, to his horror, the protective barrier around the Spiritual Law Division burning as well.He cried out a second time, his voice filled with panic and fear.\u201cThe Spiritual Library Division\u2019s on fire!\u201d\u201cWe have to put the fire out!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: 98In a small room, around a round wooden table, sat four men.The tip of Xiao Qixiu\u2019s sword rested on the floor. Xiao Qixiu frowned at Elder Sang as his fingers stroked his sword\u2019s hilt. \u201cAre you really going to take Xu Xiaoshou as your disciple?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Elder Sang after taking a sip of wine. \u201cThe fates willed it so. It was decided when he ate the first Infernal Fire Seed and lived. You knew then, didn\u2019t you?\u201dElder Sang was talking about the Windcloud Competition\u2019s preliminaries, when Xu Xiaoshou had barged into the arena and begged Xiao Qixiu to save him.Xiao Qixiu fell silent.He\u2019d been tempted to take Xu Xiaoshou as his disciple when the latter had revealed his Innate Stage Sword Will.But, when he recalled the young man\u2019s eccentric and bizarre antics, as well as the way he spoke, which was absolutely infuriating\u2026He\u2019d concluded that there was every chance that Xu Xiaoshou might turn out to be an absolute disaster and danger to the rest of humankind. He couldn\u2019t give in to impulse and risk that.He hadn\u2019t expected Elder Sang to take the young man as his disciple!\u201cXu Xiaoshou\u2026\u201d he trailed off, deliberating for a long moment before settling on a particular description. \u201c\u2026is quite the character.\u201d\u201cAre you worried?\u201d Elder Sang scratched his head. When he remembered his huge bathtub, his lips twitched.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have character. Anyway, he\u2019s not going to cause any trouble on my watch.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u201dQiao Qianzhi burst into laughter, and he smacked Xiao Qixiu on the shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to make your move before it was too late? Look, someone got ahead of you!\u201dXiao Qixiu snorted. \u201cI have no intention of taking him as my disciple. I\u2019ve got my hands full with Su Qianqian.\u201d\u201cHonestly, Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s not that bad. Why don\u2019t you like him?\u201dQiao Qianzhi tried to recall what he knew of the young man. The memories that came to mind were of a young man, always alone, training with his sword by Goose Lake.Two or three years ago, every time he\u2019d gone to Goose Lake to pick up his fat geese to prepare a good meal, he would see the young lad training diligently.That was how they\u2019d gotten to know each other. He had treated the young man to cooked goose!Qiao Qianzhi gave everyone in the Spiritual Affairs Division a taste of his caustic wit\u2014everyone but Xu Xiaoshou. That was because he knew how hard the young man worked.His diligence and hard work had paid off.After three years of training that had led to little progress in his swordsmanship, Xu Xiaoshou had acquired an Innate Stage Sword Will and clinched the championship in the Windcloud Competition. There was no question that his achievements had everything to do with the hard work that he\u2019d poured into his training!But, if he were being honest,Qiao Qianzhi had watched two of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s matches. His fighting style had become flashier\u2026He was unpredictable and excitable. But one could attribute those qualities of his to his adorable, lively personality!At this thought, Qiao Qianzhi burst into laughter again. What he wouldn\u2019t give to be young again!\u201cHahahahahahaha!\u201d\u201cCome on, let\u2019s drink!\u201d Qiao Qianzhi raised his cup, but Elder Sang was the only one to return his toast. He eyed Ye Xiaotian. Why did the latter look so worried?\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you drinking?\u201dHe understood why Xiao Qixiu didn\u2019t drink. The man was a swordsman. But why was Ye Xiaotian pretending that he couldn\u2019t drink?Ye Xiaotian glanced at him unhappily. A man of few words, he didn\u2019t say anything as he patted his arm.Elder Sang laughed. \u201cHe just got that reattached. He has to stay away from alcohol.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Qiao Qianzhi gave Ye Xiaotian\u2019s arm a hard pinch. \u201cThat\u2019s karma for you!\u201dYe Xiaotian jumped in pain and yanked his arm back. He watched the two men drink. He could still hear the deafening thunder of the two explosions that had gone off in his head. \u201cAre you really sure that everything is alright?\u201dElder Sang grabbed a slice of roasted goose, shoved it into his mouth, and began to chew loudly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. It\u2019s just Xu Xiaoshou cultivating the Infernal Fire Seed. He should be in the middle of refining it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t panic. I\u2019ve done this before. I know how this goes!\u201d\u201cCome on, cheers!\u201dQiao Qianzhi was the only one who raised his cup\u2026Ye Xiaotian stared at the liquid in his own cup, swallowed hard, and resisted the temptation to drink it.Xiao Qixiu was unmoved. Watching them drink was akin to an exercise in strengthening his own willpower.As the rims of two cups collided lightly with each other\u2026Boom!In the small room, whose walls even telepathic communication could not pass, the sound of an explosion rumbled deafeningly like thunder. One could only imagine how loud the explosion would\u2019ve been without the protection of these walls!Ye Xiaotian turned and stared dumbly at Elder Sang. \u201cIs that Xu Xiaoshou cultivating the Infernal Fire Seed too?\u201dElder Sang\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He had a bad feeling about this.Then, he remembered the array protecting the Spiritual Law Division and concluded that everything should be fine. He stubbornly replied to the other man. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s nothing serious\u2026I think.\u201dXiao Qixiu couldn\u2019t sit still any longer. He was the Chief Elder of the Spiritual Law Division. That had sounded like a huge explosion. His men were probably looking for him right now.\u201cI\u2019m going to take a look!\u201dKnock, knock, knock!Someone was urgently pounding on the door.The four men exchanged looks with one another and caught the look of alarm in one another\u2019s eyes. No one would come knocking on the door of this room unless some calamity had struck.Xiao Qixiu rushed towards the door and pulled it open.Standing at the doorway was Zhao Xidong, panting heavily. His eyes fell on the four men in the room. \u201cYou\u2019re all here. That\u2019s great!\u201d\u201cLook at you, all flustered and in a panic!\u201d Xiao Qixiu frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m in a panic\u2026\u201d Zhao Xidong blurted out frantically. \u201cWe\u2019re under attack!\u201dThe other three men in the room instantly rose to their feet. An attack? When the sun had just set and night had barely arrived?Ye Xiaotian and Qiao Qianzhi pulled a token out suddenly. It vibrated incessantly in their hand as messages came flooding in.They extended their spiritual senses and understood immediately what was going on.Zhao Xidong pulled out his token, then. Ye Xiaotian, Qiao Qianzhi, and Xiao Qixiu glanced at the token before reeling back in shock and blurting out in unison, \u201cThe Spiritual Law Division\u2019s on fire?\u201dEveryone stared at Elder Sang. His face had gone white. Just moments ago, he had reassured them that everything was fine and told them not to panic, and now\u2026Had Xu Xiaoshou really gone and landed himself in trouble?Elder Sang\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He couldn\u2019t deny that that was a very real possibility.Ye Xiaotian\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhat about your tokens? Why aren\u2019t you receiving any messages after something so serious has happened?\u201dElder Sang froze. \u201cI usually leave mine in the Spiritual Law Division\u2026\u201dXiao Qixiu stared dumbly at Ye Xiaotian. \u201cI lent mine to someone\u2026\u201dQiao Qianzhi nearly stomped his foot in fury. \u201cWhy are we still talking? We need to get to the Spiritual Law Division immediately and find out what\u2019s going on!\u201dWhooosh!The four men vanished instantly.Elder Qiao went back to the table, squatted on the stool, and grabbed a piece of roasted goose with his chopsticks. He took a bite. It was tasteless. He threw his chopsticks down and dashed out of the room.Slam!A moment later, he ran back and pulled the door shut.\u2026 \u2026\u201cHuff!\u201d\u201cHuff!\u201dSomewhere in the first level of the Spiritual Law Division, Xu Xiaoshou was unleashing his Breathing Technique without restraint. With his every inhalation, he sucked in the Infernal Heavenly Flames that were burning all around him, extinguishing flames everywhere he passed.He had killed the fire on the second floor. But the fire on the first floor was causing him real grief.He had stopped thinking about the pain. All he prayed for was for the fire to stop and for the place to not burn down. He couldn\u2019t afford to think about anything else.He continued breathing in the flames as he silently and desperately uttered his apologies for the grave crime that he had committed.He didn\u2019t do it on purpose!How could he have known that the attack he unleashed in the illusory world would be mirrored in reality too? Something wasn\u2019t right. Everything should have been an illusion.Fortunately, the techniques housed in the Spiritual Law Division were all protected by a defensive barrier. His feeble attack had clearly failed to breach their defenses.As for the shelves\u2026They looked a terrible sight!\u201cSurrounded, Passive Point +1.\u201dHeavens! They weren\u2019t wasting any time at all, were they?Xu Xiaoshou was seized by panic. He was still in the middle of putting out the fire on the first level\u2026Whooosh!His face twitched violently as he sucked in another deep breath. Then, suddenly, he heard something behind him.He turned around to the sight of four pairs of eyes staring right at him.It was Elder Sang, Ye Xiaotian, Xiao Qixiu, and the judge from the first round of the Windcloud Competition\u2026Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s legs turned to jelly.Whooosh!A shadow fell over him. Qiao Qianzhi had silently landed in front of him.Loudly and with some difficulty, Xu Xiaoshou gulped.Somebody, say something!Why wouldn\u2019t anybody say something? The silence was driving him mad with panic\u2026\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Xu Xiaoshou mustered a faint smile on his face and said earnestly, \u201cThis isn\u2019t what you think it is. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s really nothing serious\u2026\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: The Most Dangerous Enemy is the One You Can\u2019t SeeElder Sang\u2019s hands were hidden in his sleeve. He curled his fingers and effortlessly sealed the invisible raging fire away.Elder Qiao was the first to speak. \u201cWhere\u2019s the enemy, Xu Xiaoshou?\u201dWhat enemy?Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. Had the Spirit Palace been infiltrated by yet another enemy? What was going on?Hovering in midair, Ye Xiaotian looked as tall as the rest. He glared at Elder Qiao. They should have let Xu Xiaoshou speak first.If what he said aligned with what they knew, that would mean that there was nothing wrong with him. But they would have a problem on their hands if it didn\u2019t.Speaking first was akin to giving Xu Xiaoshou a chance to weasel out of the precarious spot that he was in right now.Elder Qiao glared back fearlessly.It was clear what Elder Qiao thought about that. Who subjected to the appraising looks of four men would be able to withstand that kind of pressure?Xu Xiaoshou was just a kid!Now that Elder Qiao had spoken, Zhao Xidong naturally no longer restrained himself. \u201cWe communicated via a series of hand signals just now. Didn\u2019t you tell me you were being held hostage by a kidnapper?\u201dHand signals?Xu Xiaoshou was stupefied. What hand signal?When had he ever communicated with Zhao Xidong via a series of hand signals?Xu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t an idiot. He\u2019d managed to learn a great deal of important information from the little the two men had just said. He had half a mind to use the clues that he\u2019d been given and play along. Surely that would enable him to escape the blame for what he\u2019d just done\u2026\u2026wouldn\u2019t it?As his eyes flickered between Elder Qiao and Zhao Xidong, his Sense caught every minute detail of everyone\u2019s reactions.Despite his stern look, Xiao Qixiu was still a familiar face. He could be persuaded as long as Elder Qiao was around.Elder Sang was his master. He might not have said anything yet, but it was clear that they were on the same side.Ye Xiaotian, the snowy-haired child, was the only person whom he\u2019d only met but once. The only impression he had of the child was of his reticence.But Xu Xiaoshou had known right from the start that this was a shrewd man. A man who had the capabilities to assume the role of dean of the Inner Yard wasn\u2019t someone to be trifled with.Besides, he didn\u2019t know him very well. He couldn\u2019t afford to act rashly.Xu Xiaoshou was a man guided by reason. He was very astute and rarely reckless.He might have caused a minor explosion in the Spiritual Law Division, but the damages had been minimal. They had only lost a few hundred bookshelves and many, many tables and chairs\u2026Well, tables and chairs that had looked like they would cost an arm and a leg.If he admitted to his wrongdoing, he would only suffer a monetary loss. But if he tried to hide the fact that he\u2019d caused the explosion, he would lose a moral battle.\u201cThere were no enemies, no intruders, no kidnappers,\u201d Xu Xiaoshou said calmly.\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +5.\u201dXu Xiaoshou froze momentarily.What was going on? He was telling the absolute truth!He wasn\u2019t lying!\u201cAre you playing me for a fool?\u201d Zhao Xidong couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said what was on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cIf there\u2019s no one else in the building, are you saying that you were the one who caused the explosion?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xu Xiaoshou nodded.\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +4.\u201dHmm?Four?Xu Xiaoshou caught the slight curl of Elder Sang\u2019s lips. The old man seemed to have caught onto something. He yanked his straw hat down and kept his silence.That was right.The old man was the one who\u2019d taught him how to refine the Infernal Fire Seed. He was probably the only one who believed what Xu Xiaoshou was saying\u2026\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201dElder Qiao gave Xu Xiaoshou a hard smack on the shoulder. \u201cKid, you don\u2019t have to be afraid. The most powerful warriors in the Tiansang Spirit Palace are standing right before you. If there\u2019s someone trying to threaten you, just tell us. You don\u2019t have to worry at all.\u201dWell\u2026Something about this conversation struck Xu Xiaoshou as vaguely familiar, and he got the feeling that he\u2019d heard it before. He subconsciously looked at Xiao Qixiu.Xiao Qixiu gave him an encouraging look. \u201cNo crime will go unpunished. Sooner or later, justice will be served. Tell us!\u201d\u201cEncouraged, Passive Point +1.\u201dXu Xiaoshou was dumbstruck. Why was he waxing lyrical about justice? He realized why the conversation sounded so familiar.The same conversation had taken place the first time he\u2019d drawn Sword Technique Expertise. These two men had tried tirelessly to make him spill the whereabouts of a person who didn\u2019t exist.He was on the verge of tears. In another place and another time, he might have pointed them in a random direction to get them off his back. But Ye Xiaotian was right there. He dared not act rashly. \u201cI swear, there wasn\u2019t anyone\u2026\u201dElder Sang abruptly cut him off.\u201cJudging from the force of the explosion, the impact must have hit all three levels of the Spiritual Law Division. But the damages appear to be minimal. I\u2019ve looked through our inventory of spiritual techniques. None were lost or damaged. We\u2019re only missing a few miscellaneous items.\u201cHere\u2019s my preliminary assessment: we have an intruder who is at the Master Stage and wields the fire element. But we can\u2019t eliminate the possibility of the intruder suppressing his cultivation level in an attempt to mislead us, so let\u2019s assume that he is at the Sovereign Stage!\u201dYe Xiaotian frowned. Nothing about this matter seemed certain, yet here Elder Sang was drawing a conclusion. Something wasn\u2019t quite right.He didn\u2019t raise his suspicions though. The man had just reattached his arm for him, after all.Meanwhile, listening to what Elder Sang said, Xu Xiaoshou grew increasingly baffled.An intruder?At the Sovereign Stage?Then, something clicked suddenly, and, in an instant, he realized that this was Elder Sang trying to let him off the hook.He knew he\u2019d guessed it correctly when the old man asked sternly the next moment, \u201cWhere did the intruder go?\u201dXu Xiaoshou lifted a trembling finger and pointed in a random direction\u2026Why?Why was he constantly being forced to lie?Elder Sang issued his orders with a second\u2019s hesitation. \u201cZhao Xidong, gather your men and search the grounds. Qiao Qianzhi, Xiao Qixiu, follow the intruder\u2019s trail and track him down. Ye Xiaotian\u2026\u201dHe gave the snowy-haired child a look. Ye Xiaotian stared back at him, a doubtful look on his face.\u201cYou\u2019re going as well! Team up with Xiao Qixiu!\u201d Elder Sang said firmly. One couldn\u2019t tell at all from the look on his face that he was lying. \u201cThis could be the work of the Holy Vassal. We can\u2019t let our guards down!\u201dAll traces of doubt fled from Ye Xiaotian\u2019s mind when he heard the mention of the Holy Vassal. His expression turned solemn.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re trying to draw us away from the Spirit Palace. I\u2019ll hold the fort while you track the intruder down. Let\u2019s move!\u201d Elder Sang said decisively in a tone that brooked no argument.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d the men around him answered in unison before dashing away.Xu Xiaoshou stared dumbly at the old man before him, his heart swelling with awe.That was amazing!With a few words, the old man had handled and dealt with everything. His argument had been sound, leaving no room for any refutation.He was incredible!The look that he gave Elder Sang was filled with open flattery and adoration.The old man took a deep breath. His expression darkened as he stared unblinkingly at Xu Xiaoshou. \u201cI was only away for a short while. Didn\u2019t I tell you to focus on cultivating the Infernal Fire Seed? Look at what you did instead!\u201dXu Xiaoshou knew it. The old man knew everything\u2026Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head sheepishly. He didn\u2019t know what to say.He was as frustrated as Elder Sang was!All he\u2019d wanted to do was cultivate the Infernal Fire Seed too. He hadn\u2019t expected the series of mishaps to befall him!Elder Sang glared at him. Fortunately, little damage had been done and no spiritual techniques had been lost in the fire. Otherwise, this could have been a devastating blunder.\u201cI\u2019ve distracted everyone and sent them away, but you still owe me an explanation. Explain yourself right now, or else\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou could feel his hair stand on end. He felt like he was being hunted by a ferocious beast, and terror rippled through his body.He plastered a weak smile on his face. Flattery wasn\u2019t going to help him now.\u201cI do have an explanation, but I\u2019m not sure if I should say it\u2026\u201dElder Sang grabbed him and dragged him up to the third floor.The array was activated. A barrier slammed down between the space they were residing in and the rest of the world. The old man lifted his straw hat then and finally saw the state that his room was in. He was so shocked he nearly puked blood.The huge bathtub had been flung aside and now lay overturned on the floor. There was a huge dent in the wall that marked the bathtub\u2019s collision with the latter.The rows of bottles and jars that had lined the room neatly were now scattered all over the place, as if a storm had broken into the room and sent them flying.Some of the bottles had been shattered, their pills sprawled across the floor like the pale, naked forms of young girls, hapless and exposed.The panes to his windows were gone. A cool wind breezed into the room. How refreshing indeed!Elder Sang wondered if he had taken a disciple at all.He suspected he had brought home a beast that had then gone on to tear his home down!He was livid. He scrunched his sparse eyebrows and glared murderously at Xu Xiaoshou. Anybody else would have been dead by now.Xu Xiaoshou trembled, then said in a faint, subdued voice. \u201cI was trying to put out the fire just now. I didn\u2019t have time to clean up the mess in the room\u2026\u201d\u201cTo h*ll with that! I want an explanation right now!\u201d thundered Elder Sang.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: : Seeds on All Five FingersAn explanation\u2026Xu Xiaoshou had no explanation for him. He\u2019d been cultivating pills!But he couldn\u2019t tell the old man that. He was clearly livid, and who knew if he could still be reasoned with. What he needed to do right now was to get him to calm down.\u201cDon\u2019t get worked up\u2026\u201dXu Xiaoshou gave the old man a light push. Elder Sang\u2019s eyelids started to twitch violently, and the sight of it nearly made Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s heart stop. \u201cI succeeded!\u201d he hastily added.Elder Sang froze suddenly. \u201cAt what?\u201dAt tricking the old man, obviously\u2026Xu Xiaoshou exhaled a soft sigh of relief. If he\u2019d drawn the Passive Skill of Flame Expertise, he would have confidently declared that he had succeeded in refining the Infernal Fire Seed.But he had acquired the damn Cooking Expert\u2026Alright, he wasn\u2019t going to harp on that anymore. It would only make him cry.\u201cTake a look!\u201dXu Xiaoshou wasn\u2019t sure if this was going to work at all. He laid his palm out flat, and in the middle of his palm, Infernal Heavenly Flames flickered into life.Crackle! Pop!He was seized by a strange feeling. It was as if\u2026\u2026he could feel the excitement that the flames on his palm were feeling.\u201cThere\u2019s something different about this!\u201d Something hit him then. He recalled the scorching heat that he\u2019d awoken to in the illusory realm.Cooking Expert\u2026One needed fire to cook, didn\u2019t they?Fire?He supposed his newly acquired skill did have something to do with fire after all.Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s lips twitched. He couldn\u2019t help but find the entire thing ridiculous\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Elder Sang frowned as he stared at Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm.Xu Xiaoshou gave him a look that said \u201cbe patient.\u201d Then, he pooled his full attention on the fire in his palm. The flames shrank.Pop! Crackle!A fireball spun rapidly in the middle of his palm, releasing waves of heat that distorted the air above the flames.Elder Sang was silent. The extent of compression that Xu Xiaoshou had managed to achieve during his brief absence was impressive.But his progress didn\u2019t explain the last explosion at all.He gave Xu Xiaoshou a look that indicated the latter could move on now.Beads of sweat appeared on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s forehead. He could sense another strange bond unfolding between him and the fireball on his palm. But this\u2026\u2026wasn\u2019t enough!He still had more than five thousand Passive Points.\u201cShould I use them all?\u201d he thought.Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. If Cooking Expert were an Expertise Passive Skill meant for combat, the thought of leveling up the skill with every Passive Point he currently had never would\u2019ve crossed his mind. Instead, he would\u2019ve deliberately timed his leveling up, like he had for Sword Technique Expertise.He was completely talentless. If he tried to learn too many spiritual techniques, he would never progress beyond the first move of the White Cloud Sword Technique.But if he were to level up his skills during battle, the sudden surge of knowledge might lead him to an epiphany and grant him a new technique.That was how he\u2019d acquired the Modified Sword Style and the Blade-draw Technique.This strategy was based on his experience with Expertise Passive Skills, and he\u2019d developed it to acquire more spiritual techniques. He knew that he was exploiting a loophole in the system, but honestly, it worked very well.He lacked talent, so he had to make up for that with a few additional skills.Well, Cooking Expert\u2026\u2026didn\u2019t seem like a name someone would give a skill that was meant for combat.He had no idea if his strategy would work\u2026He saw the sullen look on Elder Sang\u2019s face and had a terrible suspicion that his future would be grim if he didn\u2019t survive his current predicament.\u201cSo be it!\u201dAfter some thought, he decided to trade all his Passive Points for Skill Points and use all of the latter on Cooking Expert.\u201cCooking Expert (Acquired Lv. 6).\u201dA deluge of knowledge instantly flooded his mind. This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had attempted to level up an Expertise Passive Skill five consecutive times. He could feel his mind bending under the weight of all that knowledge.His head was killing him!The fireball in the center of his palm wavered, and Elder Sang\u2019s face involuntarily twitched at the sight.\u201cYou mean you can\u2019t even master control over such a small fireball?\u201dXu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t answer him. His brain was flooded with a sudden torrent of information on an array of ingredients, recipes, and various cooking techniques.\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d His eyes lit up.Simmering, baking, saut\u00e9ing\u2026All kinds of weird trivia popped into his head. But he didn\u2019t care!What did care about was the clear and growing bond between him and the flames burning on his palm. This didn\u2019t feel like a skill that he had recently acquired. It felt as if he\u2019d had it for years.It was as if he had complete mastery over it!Xu Xiaoshou grinned as he stuck his palm out. Before Elder Sang could voice his confusion, he heard a soft pop, then watched as the fireball on Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm expanded and grew to a size that a man could comfortably wrap his arms around.Waves of heat erupted from the fireball, ripping the old man\u2019s straw hat from his head while sending Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s clothes flapping furiously.Elder Sang was blown away. He couldn\u2019t believe the mastery that Xu Xiaoshou had gained over the Infernal Heavenly Flames within his brief absence.But\u2026\u201cI told you to shrink it, not expand it!\u201cWhat\u2019s all that about\u2026\u201d he huffed in annoyance. \u201cHow are you going to cultivate anything with that? That\u2019ll melt the hardiest cauldron!\u201dXu Xiaoshou shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? This is\u2026\u201c\u2026ehem, it\u2019s Saut\u00e9ing!\u201dHe grinned cheekily. With a twist of his fingers, the enormous fireball disappeared and was replaced by a small, quiet flame in the center of his palm.Gone was the furious, wild fire. Like a tamed beast, the flame licked quietly at the center of Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm, burning steadily.He\u2019d had no need to employ his Breathing Technique this time. Instead, he\u2019d relied on his mastery over heat and fire to accomplish the daunting feat that he\u2019d tried and failed to achieve so many times before.So\u2026Simmering!The thought left him caught between laughter and tears.He\u2019d expected Cooking Expert to be a useless skill. In fact, he\u2019d had half a mind to cast aside the irrelevant trivia crowding his brain and only retain the knowledge that gave him mastery over fire. With the latter, it would be the same as achieving his dream of wielding the Flame Expertise. He would be able to do nearly everything that he could possibly do with the Flame Expertise.Yet, the more he thought about it\u2026\u2026the more he realized that Cooking Expert was so much better than Flame Expertise. With the former, he could whip up a meal for himself when he had nothing better to do\u2026Xu Xiaoshou could feel a toothache coming on. D*mn. This was getting ridiculous.Elder Sang was blown away. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Xu Xiaoshou had actually managed to refine the Infernal Fire Seed in the brief period he\u2019d been away.But he\u2019d counted the explosions. There had only been three of them!He had taken an entire day to refine that d*mn thing, and, during the process, had blown himself up numerous times. In fact, his skin had turned brown and cracked by the end of it all while his insides had turned out soft and tender.Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand\u2026\u2026had emerged unscathed, but the Spiritual Law Division had ended up been destroyed.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dElder Sang got a grip on his emotions and said slowly, \u201cSo, that last explosion. Were you the one who caused it?\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter that this young rascal had managed to master the technique of refining an Infernal Fire Seed within such a short period of time. Elder Sang wasn\u2019t convinced that a Level 9 Spirit Cultivator could unleash a power so destructive and immense that even the Spiritual Law Division couldn\u2019t contain it.Xu Xiaoshou started to panic.He wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d blown up the Spiritual Law Division, but there was no way he was going to tell Elder Sang everything that had happened in his illusion.His will over the flame wavered, and the Infernal Fire Seed on his palm flickered unsteadily.\u201cI was testing out my new technique, Lesser Fireball!\u201cLesser Fireball?\u201d Doubt flickered in Elder Sang\u2019s eyes.The fireball resting in Xu Xiaoshou\u2019s palm brimmed with power. Elder Sang could be persuaded to believe that it was powerful enough to breach the Spiritual Law Division\u2019s protective barriers, but how had it managed to blow out his windows?\u201cSuspected, Passive Points +1.\u201dHe knew it\u2026Xu Xiaoshou didn\u2019t spare the old man a single glance as he muttered to himself, \u201cThat\u2019s just for starters.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Elder Sang picked his straw hat off the ground. \u201cAre you saying that you managed to come up with a more powerful move within such a short period of time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Xu Xiaoshou smiled smugly. \u201cIt\u2019s the Seeds on All Five Fingers!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
