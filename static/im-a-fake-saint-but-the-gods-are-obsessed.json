Please make a decision!\u201d\u201cFor the eternal peace of the Empire\u2026!\u201dI sat in the center of the conference hall that resembled the court and stared at them.All the men who came out on behalf of each force were screaming with an agitated face. And the three men representing their own forces were looking up at me. It was like brides waiting for the selection of a spouse for the imperial family.The Prince and Sword Master of the Illide Empire with impressive red hair and red eyes.\u2018Kyle Alexis Illide.\u2019He was sitting in front of the officials of the imperial palace.[Choose me. Otherwise\u2026]Suddenly, when I saw his eyes, I felt like I was hearing hallucinations. Unknowingly, Kyle\u2019s long sword on his waist made my spine shiver.And\u2026 bright blonde, golden eyes, and pretty-looking the High Priest, Reihausd El, who looked like he jumped out of a painting. There were numerous believers sitting nervous behind him.[I\u2019ve prepared a prison just for you. My Goddess.]He twisted his red lips and showed a decadent smile.Finally, Cass Lloyd, the owner of the Lloyd Merchant with dark navy blue eyes that resembled his cold-blooded personality. Behind him were members of the Lloyd Merchant, the largest company in the Empire. It was meaningless to read Cass\u2019 poker face that didn\u2019t show his feelings well.\u201cSaintess\u2026 Please make a decision.\u201dI heard the officials urging me around my ears. And a message of excited Gods was shown in the sparkling blue window in front of me.[God of Art, Mond, preaches about the aesthetic value of Reihausd\u2019s appearance.][God of Destruction, Ciel, argues that only those who are strong like Kyle can win love.][God of Knowledge, Hessed, recites information about expensive buildings owned by Lloyd\u2019s owner.][God of Love, Odyssey, is dancing fan dance excitedly.]It was time to decide a choice I could no longer step back.\u2018How did I end up in this situation?\u2019I sighed and lost in thought.***\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dWhen I opened my mouth slightly and made a sound, a sweet voice that was mine but not exactly mine flowed out. High ceilings with chandeliers and luxurious interior decorations caught my eye.\u201cAre you not feeling well today?\u201d I turned my head to the maid\u2019s voice. \u201cTwo days ago, Saintess suddenly asked for your name\u2026 I\u2019m worried because you seem to be confused.\u201dBrown hair tied in pigtails, face full of freckles, and dark brown eyes that shine under a little torn eyelids. Her name was Annie, and she was an extra among the extras whose name didn\u2019t appear in the original story. At the age of 17, she wore a navy blue made dress with frills.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine now.\u201d I answered as I hoped that my answer wouldn\u2019t be awkward.\u201cShall I prepare your meal? If you\u2019re not feeling well, I\u2019ll call the priest. What if you can\u2019t give a congratulatory speech at His Highness\u2019 birthday banquet?\u201dShe quickly continued to talk in a worried tone. \u201cEven the merchant has prepared the dress that you wanted. How much they say it was\u2026\u201dI was listening to her words without saying anything. If I were the original Ariel, I would\u2019ve jumped and said,\u00a0\u2018No way! I will give the best congratulatory speech. So that he will never forget me!\u2019But I calmed down and uttered, \u201cFirst of all, the meal\u2026 bring it to me. Except for the crappy salad.\u201d\u201cYes, Saintess.\u201d Annie smiled and added a word. \u201cYou also didn\u2019t eat it before, but it\u2019s unexpected.\u201d After a while, she opened the door and disappeared.I woke up slowly after the door was completely closed. Then I approached the full-body mirror. I still couldn\u2019t believe it, that\u2019s why my heart pounded whenever I looked in the mirror.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI think she was about 17 years old. While looking at the young face, I touched the gold hair covering half of my back. Her eyes were a little pale of sapphire color as if they contained the light of the sea, and her skin white and soft. The girl\u2019s face in the mirror was clearly very beautiful. And there was a mysterious atmosphere.But what\u2019s clear is that it\u2019s not my face. And it\u2019s also not the face of the main character in the original story that I remembered.The hair of Camilla, the main character,\u00a0 was brighter platinum, and her eyes were fresh green, like an embedded emerald.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Ariel, right? So I\u2019m Ariel\u2026\u201dI could see the girl in the mirror, that was me, giving a small sigh and clattering her lips.Hence\u2026 How should I explain my situation?[The Return of Saintess Camilla]The piece of work that I read in my previous life was a reverse harem web novel mainly about Saintess Camila, who had a noble character, being courted by three men from different backgrounds. The main characters\u2019 emotional lines dominated the story, and in the process of pushing and pulling, I could feel the catharsis as I saw the three men becoming the four out of love.\u2018It was a little shocking that all three men became Camilla\u2019s husbands.\u2019Still, it wasn\u2019t a bad piece of work for killing time.And I possessed the body of the novel\u2019s character, Ariel, two days ago.Ariel, who was born as a poor daughter of a baron, had lived as if she were an extramarital child because her mother was a servant. Although she had no faith, she had a goal of meeting the young lord of a good family and raising her status. She went to the temple regularly, but she accidentally came to the temple of Elium because she caught the High Priest, Reihausd\u2019s eye.She had been steadily playing the role of a \u2018fake saintess\u2019 since two years ago through a deal with him.The problem was that shel was the villain in the novel.Ariel was a time-limited saintess that was established as a stand-in for the political stability of Prince Kyle and High Priest Reihausd.She was a foolish evil woman who knew that she\u2019d be thrown out when the real thing appeared. Yet she interrupted Camilla with her twisted love for the High Priest, whom she relied on as a guardian, and also Prince Kyle, whom she secretly had a crush on.\u2018Are there really five years left until the real saintess, Camilla, appears?\u2019I thought, biting my lips.[The moment she reached out to Camilla, who forgave her, the three men\u2019s swords headed for her at the same time. And she was killed without a moment to scream.]In the original work, Ariel died like that and gave the readers good riddance.\u2018But I don\u2019t want to die.\u2019In the end, I stayed up all night for two days and tried to organize the situation coolly. And about my life before the possession\u2026That dying moment was still vivid. My body in the past is dead, so there is probably no body to return to. That means I have to live my whole life with Ariel\u2019s body from now on.\u201c\u2026\u201dI alluded to the colorful, large windows. The bright sunlight slightly entered the room. I approached one of the windows and raised the closed window up.\u201cI have no choice but to accept what happened anyway.\u201dI quickly judged and adapted to the situation.The cool wind outside blew through the open gap, causing my long hair to scatter.\u201cBut this isn\u2019t that bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201dBecause I possessed this body by the time before she became the villain.\u201cIf I don\u2019t live as she did, the future can be changed.\u201dFresh air was felt in my nose. It\u2019s a privilege that only the living can feel.At the time when the coldness of death flowed from my fingertips to my heart, I realized that anything was better than dying. The life of a child who was born as an illegitimate child of a rich family and lived with awareness, as soon as she became an adult with money, she became independent and got out of the house, but she died in vain in just a year.Considering my past life, wouldn\u2019t the life of a fake saintess in the novel be better than that?Foolish Ariel died while running around without knowing what it was all about, but I am different from the original one. I\u2019m not interested in the male protagonists who will become another girl\u2019s men or the saintess position.Since there are still five years left, I have to save money and learn how to live in this world.And when Camilla, the real saintess, comes, I\u2019ll calmly give up my seat, leave the temple, and buy a building\u2026 I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life doing things I want to do.As I cleared up my complicated feelings and made future plans, my anxiety seemed to fade a little. It\u2019s just a waste of time to deny the current situation, anyway. Two days of concern was enough.\u201cAriel. Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m Ariel from now on.\u201d I calmed my beating heart and clenched my fist as if I was instilling confidence for a new beginning.But at that very moment.[A shining path lies in you who accepted your new fate.]\u201cWhat is this?\u201dA blue window suddenly appeared in front of me, and a strange text popped up.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I reached out my hand and touched it.But, as if it was only visible to me, my hand lightly poked the window.Then a new text appeared.[The ancient beings who were bored are interested in your excellent adaptability.]\u201cAncient\u2026 beings?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t written in the Korean alphabet, yet maybe because of a buff of possession, I could read the letters.[The ancient beings who were bored are interested in your excellent adaptability.]Even if I read it again, I couldn\u2019t understand what the hell it was talking about.\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201dAfter a while, the translucent window gradually turned transparent and the letters disappeared. I blinked, thinking if I was just dreaming.Knock, knock.I heard knocks from outside, and soon the door opened with the sound of the handle turning.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI thought it was Annie because the silver tray was flashing in the sun, but the one who appeared holding a meal was a man whom I see for the first time.He was very tall and broad-shouldered in a white uniform, his eyes were a little cool, but those golden eyes contained warm light. His hair was as bright as his eyes. If mine was the gold on the sandy beach, then his was a really bright gold as if it was extracted from gold yarn.\u201cAriel.\u201dI was staring at him in awe as he was holding the tray, placing it on the table, and calling me. It was then that I immediately recognized who he was.\u201cI brought a meal.\u201dThe person who always called Camilla by her name even when she became a saintess in the original story.The man who was the top administrator of the temple, which had as much influence as the imperial family in the Empire.\u201cReihausd de El.\u201dThe man who brought Ariel to the temple and made her the fake saintess.His name was sweetly whispered out my lips.\u2018De El\u2019 is a unique title given to a high priest.Hearing what I just said, his golden eyes gleamed, and his red lips slightly formed an arc.\u201cAre you calling me by my name today?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt was then that I remembered that the fake saintess, Ariel, called him by the title, \u2018High Priest\u2019. So I hurriedly took care of what I had just done.It was strange for Ariel, who wasn\u2019t even the real saintess Camilla and knew clearly she was a fake, to call him by his name comfortably.\u201cI apologize, High Priest. I was just spacing out\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to listen to, though?\u201d But he cut me off with a soft voice.When I saw him with a slightly startled look, he smiled and said jokingly.\u201cActually, I had forgotten that I had a name.\u201dA fresh breeze flew through the open window. His shiny gold hair fluttered slightly.\u201cIt\u2019ll be great if you can call me by my name from now on.\u201dI looked at him blankly, and I finally came to my senses long after. I was lost in those bright gold eyes.After thinking for a moment, I opened my mouth.\u201cWhat I just said was a mistake.\u201dIf it were the original Ariel, she would\u2019ve liked it with her eyes sparkling. But I didn\u2019t want to break the wall between me and him.\u201cHow dare I call the name of the High Priest?\u201dI wouldn\u2019t live in the temple for the rest of my life, anyway, and when the real saintess Camilla comes, I won\u2019t be able to see him. That\u2019s why it was better not to cross the line.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs he looked at me with a light smile, he remained silent. After a moment, he said.\u201cAs I said before\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is Ariel\u2019s house now. You can have whatever you want or do anything.\u201dReihausd was a bright and soft man, as described in the novel.\u201cAnything, as long as you understand that freedom comes with responsibility.\u201dBut it was a story about Camilla only.And I wasn\u2019t the real Ariel who might have said,\u00a0\u201cCan I just call you Reihausd without any honorific?\u201d\u201cOf course, High Priest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve often wanted to hear my name from Ariel, but it\u2019s too bad.\u201d A smile hung around his lips, yet I felt a lot of pressure from him.\u201cThank you for bringing me a meal.\u201dI turned around and bowed my head.The High Priest is the only person in this temple who knows that I\u2019m a fake, in order to make the temple life smooth, since I was unpleasant to his eyes so there was barely anything good.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because it has been a few days since I last saw you\u2026\u201dHis feet, who were about to step out, paused before he said something. The Holy Golden looked at me brightly and said.\u201cYou look a little different than usual, Ariel.\u201dWithout panicking, I looked at him with a blank expression that seemed to be the most realistic, and smiled awkwardly.***A few days had passed since then.I sat at my desk and organized some of the things I\u2019ve checked so far.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s 722 years of the Holy Calendar and 82 years of the Imperial Calendar.\u201dIt was 5 years before Camilla, the real saintess, appeared. I was in the Illide Empire, a religious state where monarchy and divinity coexist. 99% of the people believed in God, but the important thing was that it wasn\u2019t a one-body system.There were nine Gods with different titles and names, and many temples were scattered here and there.The God of Justice, Hetuse.The God of Knowledge, Hessed.The God of Love, Odyssey.The God of Art, Mond.The God of Destruction, Ciel.The God of Benevolence, Oman.The God of Death, Kairos.The God of Eternity, Raid.The God of Lies, Bellatrix.The nine of them were Gods like that.If so, the question might arise as to what God this temple and the saintess believe in. When I read the novel, I saw Camilla mentioning some Gods, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what God she was serving. Since the main story was focused on her relationship with the male leads rather than her work as a saintess.I found out that the \u2018temple of Elium\u2019 was a place where not only a single God, but all nine Gods were enshrined. As a result, the temple of Elium was the most special of all temples, and the saintess that was born with high affinity with the nine Gods was a special being.Therefore, it would be right to define the saintess as the overall religious leader of the Empire.Come to think of it, there was also a strange part that I discovered while reading a book in the temple\u2019s library. Only saints can receive oracles, and often a new house of wisdom comes directly from one of the Nine Gods.The magazine [Listen To the Oracles From the 7th Saint] brought to me by the maids described the process of receiving oracles as follows.[The blue light in the form of a rectangle like a curtain came in front of my eyes, and the new words appeared as if they were engraved in my eyes.And while it faded and disappeared, the enchanting prophecy remained as distinct as if it were engraved on my heart.]Since humans can\u2019t understand the language of Gods, it seemed that the oracle came down through this form.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m a fake saintess, anyway.\u201dThe real saintess is Camilla, and I\u2019m only a fake saintess who has to leave after acting for the next 5 years. Oracles also come down occasionally, so I thought there\u2019d be no problem if I didn\u2019t receive them for a few years.\u2018By the way, I don\u2019t think there was a story about oracles in the original story.\u2019I tilted my head and lost in thought.In the original story, there was a scene where Camilla used the \u2018holy\u2019 power, but there was never a description of the oracle.As my thoughts deepened, I shook my head.\u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter to me. Now I\u2019m going to read a book that\u2019ll help me realistically.\u201dI was in the temple\u2019s library, where there were as many books as the imperial palace\u2019s library. The saintess was free to do anything and the temple\u2019s schedule itself was tight, so only few people came and it was perfect for me to hide alone.I wrote down my future plans on an empty paper. The salary statement and real estate books I saw in my previous life were helpful.Its exact name was \u2018Budget for Maintaining Monthly Dignity\u2019, but it was the same as salary, that\u2019s why I decided to call it like that.Saintess\u2019 monthly salary 1,000 franc x 12 months x 5 years = 60,000 francAdditional budget for saintess 10,000 franc per year x 5 years = 50,000 francPrice for a good two-storey store in the capital: large 100,000 franc, medium 70,000 franc, small 50,000 franc.From what I understood, 1 franc seemed to be about 10,000 won in Korea. A unit lower than the franc is a \u2018pin\u2019, and 1 pin is about 100 won.In other words, if I add up the additional budget, I will receive an annual payment of 220 million won.Moreover, three meals a day are provided by the temple, and if I work hard to save money by sticking to the temple, my money will exceed 1 billion won, so it is calculated that I will enjoy a fairly leisurely life even after retirement.\u2018Good!\u2019There were also in-kind offerings from the nobles and privately owned properties, so if I sell them, it\u2019ll be a good amount of money.Before I possessed Ariel, she spent a lot of money as she got her salary, so she only has 300 franc left in the balance, but I\u2019m different.\u2018If I save enough money and buy a good building\u2026\u2019Right at the moment. Suddenly, something blue appeared in front of my eyes.[The ancient beings that were bored are curious as they look at your paper.]I looked at that window and flinchedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She held a silver tray containing fresh fruits and cookies.\u201cSaintess, I brought snacks.\u201dShe brought snacks at the same time every day.\u201cBy any chance, do you see this?\u201d When I pointed at the window and asked, Annie shook her head with a small sigh. As expected, it seemed to be only visible to me.\u201cOur Saintess\u2026 I hope you get well soon.\u201dAnnie seemed to think that I was looking at something in vain because I was sick somewhere.\u201cBecause you\u2019re so weak, there\u2019s a significant obstacle to your saintess\u2019 main job.\u201d She put the tray on the table and shrugged.\u2018It\u2019s strange.\u2019I blinked and thought. There was a strange tone mixed at the end of her voice.And come to think of it, after hearing her words, I remembered that I didn\u2019t do anything other than eat and read books for 3 days.Camilla, the real saintess in the novel, had been busy traveling around temples in various provinces to meet the priests and frequently present the Emperor and Crown Prince.\u2018Maybe I have no official work because I\u2019m not a real saintess.\u2019Being weak would just be an excuse made by the High Priest.\u2018I won\u2019t be able to do what a real saintess has to do, so why I\u2019m stuck in the temple can be explained only with such an excuse.\u2019They arranged a fake saintess because a new saintess didn\u2019t appear after the death of the previous saintess many years ago. It was to prevent public sentiment from becoming confused and to promote political stability.When I was a little lost in thought, I heard Annie\u2019s voice.\u201cAnd\u2026 By the way, Saintess.\u201d I glanced at her. Her brown eyes were shining with strange light. \u201cI said that my younger brother was injured the other day. But it turns out that he\u2019s in debt\u2026 I think I need more help.\u201dI wriggled my eyebrows.\u2018Why is she telling me that?\u2019Annie raised the corners of her lips a little and opened her mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s why, I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe allowance that Saintess gives me every month. I want you to raise it a bit more.\u201dHer eyes were very similar to those whom I had seen in my previous life. People who despised me as an illegitimate child of a wealthy family, but also flirted with me to take advantage of it.Naturally, my lips twisted.\u2018Ha, look at this?\u2019Of course, Ariel who was described in the novel was a wicked woman.However, it was right to say that she was a woman with a pure emotional evil brain rather than a wicked woman who used her brain. She may have looked like a young chick to Annie, who must\u2019ve lived her life as a maid while eating the eyes of her superiors.That\u2019s why she told this nonsense story openly.\u2018But I\u2019m not that Ariel.\u2019\u201cAnnie?\u201dShe replied with a smile.\u201cYes, Saintess.\u201d\u201cHave I been giving you money?\u201dAnnie, who would\u2019ve expected,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d\u00a0raised one of her eyebrows at that sudden question.\u201cWell. Yes. You said you were worried about my brother and gave me a favor\u2026 Why are you asking again all of a sudden?\u201dI crossed my legs as I sat on the chair. Then I lifted my head and looked at Annie with relaxed eyes.\u201cHow much did I give you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s 650 franc a month. I won\u2019t ask much but if you just raise 500 franc\u2026\u201dAnnie seemed to think I asked because I didn\u2019t want to give the money. I stared intently at her without answering. Gradually, I could see Annie\u2019s smiling face twisting awkwardly.Ah, now I seem to know why Ariel had no money in her balance.\u2018A maid\u2019s salary should be less than 200 franc, but she paid more, 650 franc?\u2019Annie even asked for that to be raised.\u201cTurns out I\u2019m a pushover.\u201dI wasn\u2019t exactly talking about me, but Ariel.\u201cA pushover who\u2019s being bullied by a maid. I\u2019m disappointed, though.\u201dHer lips muscles were a little cramped at my words. After a while, she opened her lips with an awkward look.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be in a good mood today, so please think about it a little more and tell me.\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s make it clear now. I can\u2019t give you a penny from now on, Annie.\u201dI cut her off at once.\u201cI mean, of course, I\u2019ll cut off the allowance.\u201dAt those words, Annie\u2019s eyes lit up with embarrassment. She didn\u2019t know I would say this.\u201cIf you\u2019re a saintess\u2019 maid, you\u2019ll get paid enough. Why do you ask me for money?\u201d\u201cB-But!\u201dHer lips trembled.\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your brother\u2019s personal affairs, bring him in front of me.\u201d A relaxed smile formed around my mouth, and Annie was looking at me in disbelief. \u201cI heard that there is a shortage of manpower in the temple stable, so I\u2019ll look at your brother\u2019s condition and tell if he seems useful.\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201d Annie shouted with her eyes wide open.I knew that kind of look very well. The shock you\u2019d feel when you found out that the person you thought of below you was above you. I was tired of seeing many humans with such eyes in my previous life.My mouth was bitter.\u2018I thought it was strange for her to have an oddly disrespectful attitude as a maid, but I was completely considered a pushover.\u2019Ariel was acting like a pushover.\u201cThe saintess must\u2019ve forgotten\u2026\u201dAnnie opened her mouth with shaking eyes moments later.\u201c\u2026You know I know that.\u201dI frowned at the thought of what she meant. And my face hardened at her next words.\u201cThat you\u2019re\u2026 fake.\u201dHer brown eyes were shining with self-confidence.Only then did I notice the strange contempt and ridicule that had been hidden behind her smile. The reason for the allowance of 650 franc a month was all to silence Annie, who knew that Ariel was a fake saintess.\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019Ariel wasn\u2019t a benevolent person to pay for a maid just because she felt sorry for her situation.\u2018She was just stupid enough to tremble with such a sloppy threat.\u2019I clicked my tongue inward.\u201cIf I revealed that the Saintess is a fake\u2026\u201d Annie started threatening me with her eyes.\u201cSure. Just tell.\u201dYet her words were cut off by mine that popped out immediately.\u201cW-What did you say?\u201dA look of even more bewilderment than before appeared on her face.Perhaps until now, when she said she would speak, Ariel quietly comforted Annie and raised her money. At first, it was about 300 or 400 franc. And now she was calling 700 franc.\u201cTell others about it.\u201d\u201cIf I say it, the Saintess\u2026!\u201d\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be punished if I turn out to be a fake. Probably I\u2019ll be executed.\u201dMy calm face seemed to be unbelievable, unlike the way she was trembling so far. I continued to talk while looking at her coldly. Her shoulders trembled at the vivid form of violence in my eyes.\u201cThen, what will happen to the maid who hid her being a fake saintess while receiving 650 franc a month?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHer eyes shook violently at what I said.\u201cI\u2019m still half noble, so I\u2019ll die beautifully, but that won\u2019t happen to a maid.\u201d\u201cS-Saintess!\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you envy me in the guillotine, Annie?\u201dUntil earlier, her eyes were shaking with confidence that she could press me. I straightened my crossed legs and stood up, facing her straight.\u201cAnnie. If you knew I was a fake, you should\u2019ve told them right away.\u201dShe turned pale and took a step back. One of the corners of my lips was twisted.\u201cYou can\u2019t be on the same boat as mine. You\u2019ll risk your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dLife.Only then did Annie seem to realize that she had done something really dangerous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My family has nothing to do with this!\u201dThe situation turned around in an instant.\u201cShouldn\u2019t I listen to your family in person for that?\u201d\u201cS-Saintess!\u201dShe, who threatened me with her eyes, hesitated for a while and knelt down. She looked afraid of her family being harmed.\u201cI think I was too arrogant. Um, you don\u2019t have to give me money anymore. I\u2019m really sorry. I will never do something like this again in the future!\u201dSeeing Annie kneeling in front of me and being afraid, I felt a little relieved.\u2018Stupid Ariel, were you being used and threatened by a child at this level?\u2019But I am different. I had no intention of living my life as a fool in the future.\u201cSaintess\u2026 If you forgive me just once!\u201dAt that time, the door opened without knocking.Startled by the sudden sound, I saw a holy white uniform and bright blonde hair in my sight. Beautiful golden eyes that shine darker today under straight eyebrows.I stared blankly at him as he approached me without saying a word.\u201cHigh Priest\u2026 \u201dAnnie was shivering as she saw the High Priest\u2019s figure, and her face became even paler.And he quickly pulled out a long sword from his waist. For a moment, a thin mist of blood scattered, and Annie, who had her back stretched out, fell to her floor in an instant.It was such a moment that I couldn\u2019t even scream.The dark red blood that spread round the floor was even more unrealistic.Soon he took out a handkerchief and wiped the blade with a dirty expression.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared blankly at him.I couldn\u2019t believe he, someone who used a kind voice towards me, had just killed someone.A person died.And that was also Annie, my direct maid.Of course, she did something really bad, but it was the first time I\u2019d ever seen a person die.I desperately suppressed my throbbing inside.I clenched my trembling fists.He quickly pushed the polished sword into the sheath and looked at me and bit his lips.\u201cDue to the circumstances, I had to dispose of her immediately.\u201dThe surprisingly calm and soft tone made me feel strange.Reihausd\u2019s judgment would be right.Annie knew the truth she shouldn\u2019t have known, and she was a wicked woman who threatened me under the pretext of it, so even if she was interrogated outside, there was no guarantee that it wouldn\u2019t leak again.However, contrary to the objective judgment, this situation was still shocking.I was barely holding onto my sanity, turning pale.Soon after, Reihausd\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you to organize your seat, Saintess.\u201dI turned my gaze to the other side and didn\u2019t open my mouth. Even if I said something to him in this state, it wouldn\u2019t be a proper expression of opinion.High Priest Reihausd turned around after a while.\u201cPlease take a rest.\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask any questions about the situation. And that made me even more anxious.Just like when he killed Annie without asking anything, I fear that one day he\u2019d do that to me too.My heart raced as if it was about to leap through the silence as it went out.The door closed with a small noise, and then I took a deep breath. Then, with both hands, I rested my forehead, where headaches poured in.My body was constantly trembling in the vibrating blood. A blue chat window appeared in the dizzying view.[The ancient beings who were bored are curious about your cleverness.][The ancient beings who were bored are curious about your judgment.][The ancient beings who were bored are curious about your calmness.][The unlock condition of the oracle is getting closer.]I still didn\u2019t know what it meant. My mind got more complicated, so I just closed my eyes.***[Then, what will happen to the maid who hid her being a fake saintess while receiving 650 franc a month?]Ariel\u2019s twisted voice echoed in Reihausd\u2019s ears.He strode into the office with a cold, subdued look.[Wouldn\u2019t you envy me in the guillotine?]On the way, he grabbed the long sword out of his waist and threw it away, then the sword hit the floor and made a crackling sound.Although it was a sword of noble value, he had no intention of reusing a sword stained with dirty blood.A glimmer on Ariel\u2019s face, who was pretending to be calm, hiding her fearful eyes.Did that kid have such wit and courage?\u2018No, if she had that kind of brain in the first place, she would have suffered.\u2019Reihausd frowned when he remembered Ariel\u2019s face, which was often staring into the distance with a gloomy expression as if she was dead.He took off the jacket of his uniform, hung it, and unbuttoned a couple of his shirt\u2019s buttons.The image was visible in his golden eyes, which had a turbid light.God of Art, Mond.Elium is a temple that enshrines all nine gods, and unlike the saintess who worships all gods, the priests, including the High Priest, worshiped different gods.Reihausd\u2019s eyelids, who were gazing at the statue with restrained eyes, fell.***Annie died, and new maids were assigned.Other maids took turns coming in to prevent the same thing as before, and I often confused their names. The maids were especially careful with me, perhaps because they knew that Annie was dead in my room. Every time they made a small mistake, they dropped so much that it felt a little burdensome.And at first, the shock was so severe that my condition, which had been restless for a day, was almost restored.I knew that I was good at adapting, but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m so calm about a person\u2019s death\u2026I felt a little bitter about myself.This isn\u2019t modern time. The values of human life are also different.I know why Reihausd did that.The fact that I\u2019m a fake saintess was a secret that could literally turn the country upside down, and if the truth was revealed, it would be a devastating blow to both the Temple and the Emperor.But I didn\u2019t have the courage to see Reihausd again.The area around my neck became cold for nothing when I remembered the blade of the blood-covered sword he was holding.\u2018I\u2019d better escape a little earlier.\u2019I was going to wait for the real saintess to come, but I felt like my life would be shortened if I did.Annie, who knew I\u2019m a fake saint, also died that way, and there\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t take my life as a fake saintess.In addition, the game dialog that appears often in front of my eyes. It made me feel even more uncomfortable at the beginning of its existence.\u2018What the hell is this?\u2019I started writing the formula again at my desk.The price of a good two-story store on capital: large 100,000 francs, medium 70,000 francs, small 50,000 francsYes, it\u2019ll be too difficult to manage if the building is too big. If I sold the relics, I could buy a medium-sized building worth 70,000 francs.Even with that, my normal life as a landlord wouldn\u2019t be a concern.Since the average monthly salary of commoners is around 1,000 francs, there was no need to worry about making a living even if it wasn\u2019t a building.If I live in a proper disguise, I\u2019m sure Reihausd will forget me in two or three years. In the original story, he was indifferent to Ariel and had a cold personality.\u201cGood. It\u2019s for three years.\u201dI put down the flagpole pen and muttered.The five-year self-reliance plan was reduced to three years. There is no Annie who threatened to take 65% of my monthly salary, so now all you have to do is collect it.Then, suddenly a knock was heard.\u2018Who is it?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt wasn\u2019t long before I woke up from my seat at the sight of the man visible as the door opened. It was Reihausd.Reihausd in a clean white uniform looked bright today.\u2018But, originally, can a High Priest enter the Saintess\u2019 room at any time like this?\u2019I tilted my head and thought.\u201cMay the High Priest be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201dHiding my doubts, I greeted him with the recently learned formal greeting of the Saintess.\u201cThank you, Ariel.\u201dFortunately, he greeted me with a smile as he saw this greeting was correct. He asked as he strode towards me as if he noticed that I was writing something.\u201cAre you studying?\u201dIt was then that I remembered the formula I had written and shrugged my shoulders. Looking at it, he might have noticed my escape plan.\u2018If that was the case\u2026 \u2019Suddenly, the cold light in his dark eyes flashed in my mind, and my back shivered. I quickly turned the note over and shoved him the other paper with something else written on it..\u201cYou came just in time, High Priest.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dA small sense of relief filled me at the sight of him who was puzzled but willingly accepted it. He took the paper I had given him and leaned against the window.Even if it wasn\u2019t for the sunlight pouring in from the window behind him, he was a handsome man whose halo could be seen. It was a man\u2019s line, but the word \u2018beautiful\u2019 suited him. It was hard to believe that he had killed Annie even when I saw him again.\u201cI would like to have the congratulatory speech that\u2019ll be read at His Majesty Kyle\u2019s birthday banquet tomorrow to be reviewed.\u201dSoon it was a chance to see the second male protagonist of this novel. The man Ariel had an unrequited love for.Of course, I have no intention of following the original, but I was still curious about Kyle\u2019s real life.By the way, the congratulatory message I gave to Reihausd now wasn\u2019t written by me, but by Ariel before I joined the body.I\u2019ve never read it properly other than the title [Congratulations on His Highness\u2019 Birthday].He leaned over and began to read it.\u201cHappy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to His Highness\u2019 Crown Prince Kyle, happy birthday to you. The Crown Prince was born to be loved. He\u2019s loved in the life of His Highness the Crown Prince. The love of the Nine Gods that started from the beginning\u2026 \u201dAfter a while, his lips closed.My face got hot.\u2018Ariel\u2026 I knew she had a pure brain, but how could that be this serious?\u2019I thought I was going to die of embarrassment.I was afraid that the calculation formula would be found out, so I made excuses by choosing roughly, but I think it was the wrong choice.\u201cI think it\u2019s too low for the High Priest to review, so I will write it again\u2026 \u201dI spoke hurriedly.\u201cTo say \u2018love\u2019\u2026 \u201dBut Reihausd cut off my flustered words. I blinked at the words that came out of his slightly twisted lips.\u201cDo you love Prince Kyle?\u201dInstead of pointing out the ridiculously childish sentencing of the congratulatory speech, he suddenly asked about my heart for Kyle.I looked at him with a blank expression.He had a halo with his back to the window, that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t see his expression very well, but I could guess that it wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant.\u201cSo, that love\u2026 Uh, it\u2019s not necessarily that kind of love\u2026 \u201dIt was understandable that he was displeased.It seems pathetic that a fake saintess who cannot even perform the duties of a saintess is in unrequited love with the Crown Prince.\u201cJust as God loves humans, I used the idiomatic expression of love as a blessing.\u201dHowever, I grew up in a very difficult environment, so I had a knack for escaping crises and changing words. I quickly wrapped it in idiomatic phrases.\u201cIf Prince Kyle doesn\u2019t take it in a tolerant sense.\u201dBut he continued to speak with a dissatisfied expression on his face.\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201dMy image was reflected in his gold eyes, which seemed unusually dark today.\u2018\u2026Why are you so serious all of a sudden?\u2019I was bewildered because I didn\u2019t know the literature.Ariel\u2019s congratulatory remarks may not be tolerant, but rather a statement that pours out all of her sincerity. But the chance that Prince Kyle would take it seriously was close to zero. Considering the character of Prince Kyle in the original story.\u201cWell. If there is room for misunderstanding by the listener, it should be corrected.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to haggle anyway, so I answered neatly. In fact, even if he hadn\u2019t pointed it out, of course, I was going to fix it. Congratulatory speeches are definitely meant to be read in front of others, but I couldn\u2019t be ashamed to read this.\u201cI thought it was an illusion.\u201dAt my words, he softened his eyes and smiled.\u201cI feel like you have grown a lot these days.\u201dIf it was Ariel who originally wrote a congratulatory message like this, she would have tears in her eyes at his advice on corrections, indicating that she didn\u2019t want to change it.But I wasn\u2019t Ariel.\u201cI will rewrite the congratulatory message and review it.\u201dReihausd handed the paper back to me with his white-gloved hands.\u201cYes. I will be happy to review it again.\u201dI tried to take the paper, thinking I\u2019d rip it off right away as soon as he went.But the moment I accepted it, the paper was slippery and I lost it. The fluttering, upside-down paper landed on the border between the hem of the dress I was wearing and the floor.I hurriedly bent down to pick up the paper when I heard Reihausd\u2019s soft voice.\u201cStay still.\u201dI shuddered at the firm and low voice like a command. Then he slowly bent his knees and waist. As his upper body, which was at least one head taller than me, went down below my chest, I felt a strange feeling.His white-gloved hand quickly reached out to a piece of paper. As his hand touched the paper, the movement of the hem of the dress was felt through the clothes.I stared at his head that was leaning under me, feeling eerie for nothing.He slowly grabbed the paper and lifted his knees and back up again. The shape of his slightly messy hair felt strange.\u201cThank you.\u201dTaking it back, I looked at him for a long time, then Annie\u2019s incident came to mind and I looked away.Soon his voice was heard. Somehow, there was a smile in his voice.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning.\u201d***After an early dinner, I headed to the temple library with the maids.I needed to find a suitable expression or honorific for the Crown Prince\u2019s congratulatory speech, so I was thinking of borrowing some books about the royal family\u2019s rituals and events.\u201cSaintess, it is said that books related to royal events are located at the corner of the third row in the southeast section of the first floor.\u201dAt the words of the maid who came after checking the way with the librarian, I went straight there.All priests, paladins, including saintesses and saints registered in the Temple of Elium are permitted to borrow books.Since Elium was no different than the central temple of the empire, there were many who wanted to become the saints of Elium, and the number of seats didn\u2019t meet the demand.So, in the end, the saints of Elium were selected only by those who were famous among the nobles, and there were some ridiculous situations in which Elium\u2019s saints were a measure of fame.And there are bound to be people who condescend with it.\u201cI am\u2026 an apprentice priestess who worships God.\u201d\u201cJust because you worship a God doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t eat a meal outside, doesn\u2019t it? Besides, you\u2019re not a formal priestess, but an apprentice priestess. I am a saint of Elium.\u201dI stopped walking at the sound I heard. It was the voice of a young woman and the voice of a young man. It was easy to guess what was going on beyond the bookshelf.\u201cI have already eaten. And whether apprenticeship or formal\u2026 Reverence for God is the same.\u201d\u201cHow about a drink or a meal? Don\u2019t refuse too much when I tell you to leave the temple behind for a while and take a look at the world.\u201d\u201cSaint. If you keep insulting me, I\u2019ll have no choice but to officially tell the temple.\u201dI let out a small sigh at the unwelcome situation.To be honest, I was bothered to meddle in the injustice of strangers.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the situation was happening in front of the bookshelf where the books I was borrowing were stocked, and that I had to pick up books as soon as possible to make a congratulatory speech by tomorrow morning.In front of me was a blue-haired apprentice bride with her pale face, and a man in his mid-thirties or so, showing off her power by sticking close to her.And behind him was a book called [A Collection of Congratulatory Messages for the Imperial Banquet].I said with a small sigh.\u201cWould you mind getting out of the way?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe man frowned at the voice which was interrupting him and looked back. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to guess who I was because I was wearing a one-piece dress, not a priestess\u2019 suit.But looking at the two maids of the temple behind me, it seemed that he was contemplating for a moment whether I was a high-ranking priestess or not.I said it once again.\u201cCan\u2019t you hear my words?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dStill, he didn\u2019t budge. I spoke again as I looked at him.\u201cIf you want to meet a woman, go outside, not to the temple.\u201dThen a girl who looked a lot younger than me suddenly appeared and spoke cheekily, but he opened his mouth and frowned, as if he felt somewhat uncomfortable to yell hastily.\u201cI was just sharing here because I wanted to have a conversation with the apprentice priestess, but what are you doing\u2026 \u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like he was the right person to be treated with good words.\u201cThis apprentice priestess doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to talk to you.\u201dAt my words, the apprentice priestess\u2019 eyes shook. She hurriedly opened her lips.\u201cPriestess! This believer is unilaterally harassing me.\u201dShe also urgently asked me for help as if she didn\u2019t even recognize that I was the Saintess.At those words, the man hardened his eyebrows.\u201cTo think that you say harassing. These days, it seems that Elium chooses apprentice priestesses in vain. It\u2019s true that I lied that we were talking to each other.\u201dHe seemed to have gained some courage as I stood still, staring at the covers of the book next to him. He was confident that he could overcome me, even if I was a high-ranking priestess, since he knew a few priests.\u2018Oh, that would be useful, too. [Imperial Banquet Etiquette].\u2019Of course, I was just skimming through the necessary materials.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd to put such an insult on a normal person.\u201dAt the man\u2019s sarcastic remarks, Daisy, the apprentice priestess, glared at the man as if she was soaring in anger.\u201cThe believer just asked me to go out and have a drink!\u201dNevertheless, he was alone with his arms crossed, pretending not to know.After picking the books I needed roughly, I asked him with a light smile on my lips.\u201cExcuse me, but which family are you from?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Hans from the Baron Ragefield family. \u201d\u2018Hm. The Ragefield family.\u2019Judging from the fact that I had no memory of reading it in the book, it wasn\u2019t a famous family in central politics. Hans was a name I had never even heard of.He raised his chin and said to me, \u201cI have revealed my name, so please reveal your name as well. I will put the insults I experienced today, the name of the priestess, and the name of this apprentice priestess in the temple under the name of my family.\u201dThen at that words, the maids behind me interrupted in angry voices.\u201cIt\u2019s rude!\u201d\u201cWho do you think she is!\u201dI raised one hand and silenced the maids. Then, he said, staring straight at the apprentice priestess, who had no idea what to do with an anxious expression as she was wondering if I would be disadvantaged.\u201cSince you\u2019re an apprentice priestess, let me ask you one question.\u201dAt my words, Hans flushed as if he thought I was ignoring him, who was standing in the middle. But I continued to speak without hesitation.\u201cCan you name the three people who have the authority to expel believers from the Temple of Elium?\u201dI could see Hans\u2019 face hardened at the word \u2018expel\u2019.It was because, although he said that he would put silence in the temple, in fact, Baron Ragefield wasn\u2019t in a position to do so.And expulsion!It means that he won\u2019t be able to enter the temple again, and to be expelled from the Temple of Elium was equivalent to being expelled from the mainstream of the capital aristocrats.Besides, if it\u2019s the three people who have the authority to expel\u2026Daisy had a puzzled expression on her face, but soon opened her mouth with a calm voice.\u201cYes, Priestess. Those with the authority to expel are the Chief Priest, the High Priest, and\u2026 the Saintess.\u201dThe Saintess was located at the top of the triangular ranks that made up the Elium Temple.\u2018The Ariel I saw in the book didn\u2019t step out of the temple on her own feet and did something naughty, and in the end, she was expelled by the real Saintess, Camilla.\u2019I opened my mouth, remembering what Camila had said in the original.\u201cThat\u2019s right. A saintess is able to expel people with its authority.\u201dThe man said, \u201cHuh,\u201d and rolled his eyes as if it was nonsense.\u201cWhat kind of strange words are you making fun of me with now? Well, are you going to tell the Saintess to get me expelled? She isn\u2019t such a free perso\u2026 Ha! What you guys don\u2019t know is that I\u2019m really not going to get over this!\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to even think about the possibility that the Saintess was in front of him.Well, I think the plain dress I\u2019m wearing right now was too light for a saintess to wear, so I understand that part.\u2018Since I was said to be not feeling well and had been locked up in the temple, he would\u2019ve never seen my face properly.\u2019However, the hoarse voice that was annoying to listen to more, was unbearably annoying. I strode in front of him and twisted my lips.\u201cI\u2019m also not going to let this go. Sir Hans Ragefield.\u201dAt that moment, the air around the area became chilly as I spoke coldly.\u201cBecause I am that Saintess.\u201dI glared at him and spoke clearly, word by word.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAfter a while, Hans\u2019s face hardened completely, understanding the words.He looked at the maids behind me as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard, but the maids just stared at Hans with exhilarating expressions.\u2018This person is really our Saintess, you know?\u2019Meanwhile, the apprentice priestess Daisy\u2019s eyes widened so much that they couldn\u2019t get any bigger. It must have been quite a shock to her that the Saintess appeared to her as well.Their gaze rested on my blonde hair and then turned to my eyes.And flinch again.Um. As expected, in a priesthood society, it\u2019s best to push ahead with it as a priestess!I really liked his distorted expression.\u201cY-You are\u2026?\u201dHans trembled in disbelief.If there were two mountains of the Empire, one was the Imperial Palace and the other was the Temple of Elium. And the Saintess was like an emperor in Elium.Because of her weakness, she rarely engaged in external activities, but she was still the daughter of a great god.\u201cLet\u2019s formally file a petition with your family through the Holy Knights of the temple.\u201dAt those words, Hans immediately bowed his head to me as if he had just come to his senses.\u201cI apologize! To think that you are the Saintess! I\u2019ve never even dreamed of it!\u201dI\u2019m saying it tastes this good when I use a cape.I looked down at him slowly with a look that asked him to continue talking.\u201cI apologize, I apologize! I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re the Saintess. I have committed a great sin.\u201dThe word \u2018expulsion\u2019 must be floating around in his head right now.Being expelled from Elium is equivalent to being expelled from the aristocratic society, so if there was a son in his family to replace him, he could probably be kicked out of the family.\u201cPlease! Please forgive me. Saintess.\u201dHe forgot his pride and pleaded in front of me.\u201cThere must be something you need to get before my forgiveness.\u201dAt my cold words, he hurriedly shook his head.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dI lifted her finger and pointed at Daisy. Still, he had to make sure what he had to do.\u201cThe victim is her, you know.\u201dAt that, he took a breath.Not to mention the Saintess, she was above him, and she was above his family.However, most of the priestesses are daughters of commoners, and even though she was a priestess of Elium, there were no nobles who volunteered for the priestess unless they were as young as a minor writer.I can\u2019t believe he was begging for forgiveness to an apprentice priestess whom he was trying to seduce into the night\u2019s cradle.From his point of view, it would be absurd.\u201cI-It wasn\u2019t a harrassment\u2026 \u201dAs his vanished self-esteem soared along with resentment, I narrowed my eyes and asked.\u201cAh, my eyes and ears with the Nine Gods are wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThen he hastily bowed his head to the apprentice priestess and begged her forgiveness.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201dDaisy\u2019s black eyes twinkled as if she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d even get an apology.Things seemed to have settled down properly, and I glanced around at the maids and ordered.\u201cBring the [Imperial Banquet Collection] and the [Imperial Banquet Etiquette] book behind that man.\u201dWhen I came to the library to get at least a sniff of what I could do for the maid, I thought it was quite annoying.And at that moment, a blue chat window appeared in front of my eyes again.[The ancient beings who were bored are deeply curious about your justice.][The ancient beings who were bored are deeply curious about your will.][\u2018Oracle\u2019 is unlocked.

It\u2019s not even the opening day of the club.\u201dAt that moment, the blue light of the chat window became darker.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is curious about the \u2018club\u2019.][The God of Love, Odyssey\u2019s eyes are sparkling.][The God of Art, Mond, is drawing a portrait of you.]I touched my forehead at the message that was far from being read.\u2018So, you mean the Gods really are watching me?\u2019Judging from the books I\u2019ve read so far, it seems that the oracle is the Saintess\u2019 unique ability, and that the oracle can be received only when the frequency of a very special divine power is right.But now my oracle didn\u2019t disappear, it was blinking and renewing the conversation.It seemed that they looked very excited, like subscribers who entered a new internet broadcasting channel.\u201cCan\u2019t I turn this off?\u201d I muttered as I looked at the chat window in a confused mind. Then a sparkling window appeared.[Do you want to temporarily disable the <Oracle> feature?(Yes/No)]Oh, it looks like it could be turned off.But the chat window was a chaotic crucible of riots.[The God of Art, Mond, threatens you with your portrait.][The God of Love, Odyssey, is running rampant.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, looks at you with sad eyes.]I was about to click \u2018Yes\u2019, but I put my hand down for a moment and looked at the chat window. Then it became a little quiet.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, reveals his trust in you.]\u2018So this is like\u2026 \u2019It was like the internet was connected after years and they were like people with blood rising up to their necks.\u2018Or those who got a hold on a walkie-talkie on a deserted island and hang on to it.\u2019The blazing eyes seemed to be felt somewhere, and somehow it was a strange feeling.In the end, after thinking about it, I played with the \u2018No\u2019 button of disabling the oracle function.\u201cBut the oracle\u2026\u201dLooking at the blue chat window, I spoke to myself.\u201cWhat are they asking me to do with this?\u201dAfter all, I wasn\u2019t a saintess.It didn\u2019t change anything other than getting the feeling that subscribers were watching my actions one by one. If they gave me about 100,000 franc of money as a sponsorship feature, I could sing a cool song.After a while, a new phrase appeared in the chat window.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, uses \u2018Sensitivity\u2019 on you.]Then, at that moment, letters from hundreds of books began to enter my mind. It had [The Imperial Banquet Recipes] and [A Collection of Congratulatory Messages for the Imperial Banquet] that I hadn\u2019t read yet.However, the flow of knowledge that had been smoothly injected without pain was blocked and a message emerged.[The oracle\u2019s level is low, so it cannot accept \u2018Sensitivity\u2019.]Suddenly, I felt like the knowledge that had entered my head was draining away again.\u201c\u2026\u201dHm. Somehow my self-esteem got hurt.\u2018It sounds like you\u2019re saying it\u2019s unacceptable because my level of knowledge is low.\u2019Still, I knew what the oracle could give me.After a while, a message in the chat window came to mind again.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, \u2018blesses\u2019 you.]And at that moment, I felt that my complicated head was somehow clear. When I look at the covers of stacked books, I feel like the letters are stuck in my head.In this state, even the confidence that you can pass any modern study is soaring.I looked outside and it was getting dark.I opened the book to write a congratulatory speech. The chat window that was shining brightly turned transparent and disappeared when I wasn\u2019t conscious of it.I started moving my hands.Scratch. Scratch.The sound of a pen screeching through the paper began to be heard.I was still embarrassed by the sudden opening of the oracle function, but this\u2026 I thought it was a surprisingly good feature.***The next morning.I came back after taking a bath and was stretching at the moment I heard a knock. When I told whoever that was to come in, the door opened, and Reihausd appeared. He was still so pretty that I wondered why he was so handsome since early morning.[The God of Art, Mond, can\u2019t take his eyes off Reihausd.]The bright gold eyes smiled brightly.\u201cDid you sleep well last night, Ariel?\u201dI smiled softly and nodded my head.\u201cYes. May the High Priest be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201dHe answered me with a smile and came to me.Then he turned and glanced at my desk full of books.\u201cYou seem to have studied a lot since I left yesterday.\u201dI nodded quietly.I did read a lot of books. I have learned something from a few experiences yesterday. If I receive Hessed\u2019s \u2018blessing\u2019, I will have special powers for about three hours. The ability to understand and acquire was greatly increased, and it seemed to return to its original state after a certain amount of time.\u2018It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to get a perfect score on the SAT at this rate.\u2019I thought to myself and continued.\u201cBecause the Saintess\u2019 congratulatory speech should also contain dignity and honor for the temple.\u201dIf a saintess who is no different from the head of the religious world recited the congratulatory remarks she wrote yesterday, people would laugh at the temple in their hearts.Anyway, even while I was a fake saintess, I decided to do my best with the utmost sincerity.My relationship with the male protagonists is also maintained to the extent that they\u2019d think\u00a0\u2018you\u2019re a good person\u2019\u00a0in moderation, neither more nor less.\u2018It\u2019s all a survival strategy.\u2019And although it was sudden, I decided to accept the \u2018oracle\u2019 first in order to accumulate knowledge and deal with the situation here.\u201c\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, at my words, Reihausd closed his mouth for a moment and stared at me. His eyes were mysterious, so I missed it for a while. Mine was too far away from Ariel\u2019s character.\u201cI think I\u2019ve been acting too immature until now.\u201dSo, I decided to attribute the reason for this change to \u2018reflection\u2019.\u201cI don\u2019t know how many years it will be until the real saintess will be found, but I\u2019ll try to become a saint who doesn\u2019t bother you.\u201d I said to him with positive and calm eyes.At that moment, I felt Reihausd\u2019s golden eyes darken a little.\u201cWell, Ariel\u2026 \u201d He whispered my name and looked at me. \u201cI told you. This is your home now.\u201dI tried to smile faintly at his words, which somehow made my spine shiver.Like Annie, who was killed after knowing the secret of a \u2018fake saintess\u2019, does that mean that he won\u2019t let go of my life?The original Ariel had no idea, but it wasn\u2019t easy to ignore this shiny dead flag.A moment of silence passed between the two of us, and he reached out his hand.\u201cSo don\u2019t say things like that.\u201dHe opened his mouth as he looked at my slightly trembling eyes. The faint smile on his lips was somehow vague.\u201cNow, shall we review the newly written congratulatory speech?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I had no idea what his eyes were thinking, and the atmosphere flowing from him brought a series of tensions.A cool breeze blew in through the slightly open window.I could see his long eyelashes fluttering.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a long silence, Reihausd raised his head from the congratulatory speech and looked at me. Somehow, I felt a chill in his eyes. Is there something that I do wrong? When I winced, the chill disappeared like a lie.It was such a fleeting feeling that I thought I might have felt it wrong.He opened his red lips.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s excellent.\u201dIt was definitely a compliment, but I felt uneasy at the sound of his strangely submerged voice.\u201cIs there anything wrong?\u201d\u201cNo. Just\u2026 You\u2019ve grown a lot. Enough to believe that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s writing skills.\u201dI answered without being flustered.\u201cIt\u2019s just a slightly modified version of the sentence I saw in the book.\u201dI also had my own thoughts that I had to act so as not to raise his suspicions. In fact, I could have written it better, but that\u2019s why I copied the book.Reihausd glanced at the [A Collection of Congratulatory Messages for the Imperial Banquet] book to which my fingertips pointed.\u201cI see. In any case, it\u2019s much better than the love letter you wrote last time.\u201dAnyhow, even if it was written with feet, shouldn\u2019t it be better than that?After a while he said with a light smile.\u201cBut there must have been some commotion in the library a while ago.\u201dI stared at him with a subtle tension.It was a bit exaggerated for Hans\u2019 shameless attitude, yet it seemed to have entered Reihausd\u2019s ears.\u201cYes, I stopped by to borrow a book to write a congratulatory speech, and Baron Ragefield\u2019s son made fun of an apprentice priestess. I gave him a little bit of caution as the Saintess.\u201dIt\u2019s better to be honest about these things than to be confused and bewildered.\u201cI think it was a little too much.\u201dAt the end, I added an Ariel-like silly smile.\u201cHe\u2019s been expelled.\u201dBut I caught my breath at Reihausd\u2019s words that followed immediately.\u201cNot only Hans Ragefield, but all the believers of the Ragefield family.\u201dHis eyes were cold, without a single smile.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI was trying to control my expression when I heard his voice.\u201cIf there is any such blasphemous incident in the future, please tell me right away. I\u2019ll take proper action.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, carefully analyzes Reihausd.]After a while, another sentence appeared.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is wary of Reihausd.]He said that all members of the Ragefield family were expelled?The cruel hand that cut Annie without moving his eyebrows came to my mind, which chilled his spine again.\u201c\u2026\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, judges that Reihausd has an impure heart.]And looking at him in that tension, another strange sentence came to mind.[The God of Art, Mond, argues that Reihausd\u2019s external nobility can make up for his inner impurity.]I blinked at the absurd sentence in the tense atmosphere.\u2018No, out of the blue, what else is this?\u2019And then the conversations continued.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, criticizes Mond\u2019s appearanceism.]I opened my eyes as blurry as possible to the sudden crowd of the Gods, making the chat window transparent. It was because it was difficult to manage my expression when I saw these sentences with my cool face.\u201cAre you dizzy?\u201dSuddenly, Reihausd\u2019s voice was heard in the blurred vision.\u201cNo. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201dAs I was thinking about what to say, I suddenly spoke.\u201cI think the High Priest\u2019s determination is amazing.\u201dIn a friendly conversation with the person, I need to maintain a good relationship with.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe stared at me at the words.\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to cut out the rotten parts. There will be entangled interests here and there, and there will be interests involved.\u201d\u201c\u2026Those priests think of me as a dictator, but the Saintess here seems to have a different opinion.\u201dI looked at Reihausd\u2019s words as if he was trying to test me and answered.\u201cI think the High Priest is a fair and just person.\u201dIt was something I could confidently say because I had read the original story.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that way.\u201dReihausd\u2019s eyes widened.He was like a grim reaper to the villain Ariel, but he was a strong shadow and support for Camilla.Although he set up a fake saintess by conspiring with the prince with political intentions, it wasn\u2019t for his personal gain, but to settle the confused public mind in the absence of the saintess.\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know you were going to expel the entire Ragefield family.\u201dIf I weren\u2019t Ariel, the villain.And if he wasn\u2019t one of the three men who will kill Ariel.Maybe I\u2019d admire him a little.I looked at him and smiled softly.He stared at me silently for a long time.His gaze lingered for too long, and when I wondered if I was doing something wrong, he pursed his lips and looked away.\u201cLooks like I took too much of your time.\u201dI didn\u2019t deny it because I wanted him to leave.\u201cHaha.\u201d\u201cI will go out. Enjoy your meal.\u201dReihausd, who immediately spoke to me in a stern tone, left the room.Then I gave strength to my eyes again. The oracle was actively discussing Reihausd.[The God of Art, Mond, shares his views on the golden ratio of the human body.][The God of Love, Odyssey, is seriously listening to Monde\u2019s views.]I put my hand on my forehead.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, preaches that the inside is more important than the outside.][The God of Art, Mond, snorts at Hessed\u2019s words and says that appearance is the most important thing.][The God of Love, Odyssey, insists that there is a man more handsome than Reihausd, so let\u2019s wait a little longer.]\u201cWould you mind having a little constructive conversation?\u201dBut my answer was nothing but an empty echo. After that, the conversation between the Gods continued for a long time.***She no longer blushed or averted her eyes. Didn\u2019t she even look directly at him with clearer eyes?Reihausd hardened his eyebrows and nervously took off his jacket.\u2018What has changed?\u2019Nothing has changed.[Reihausd de El.]It was the first time he heard his full name from those lips.Somehow, it felt so strange that his nerves were getting sensitive.Had her eyes been blue?Even that was the first time he realized it. And that blue light had been following his nerves and bothering him lately.[I think the High Priest is a fair and just person.]A faint smile on his red lips.Was Ariel a woman who could smile like that?Her words, which were always whining or exaggerated, were entering his ears for the first time.She had been around for a long time.\u201c\u2026\u201dReihausd shook his head.The reason he brought Ariel was because she was naive and hustle enough to fit into this fake saintess play.\u2018No matter how much people change\u2026\u2019Then the door to the office swung open, and someone came in angry.\u201cHow can you expel a believer without consulting me!\u201dIt was the Chief Priest, Heinz.His bald head gleamed in the light of the holy stone hanging on the wall. He breathed heavily and stood in front of Reihausd.\u201cI heard what happened to Saintess. No matter how it\u2019s for the Saintess, I\u2019m deceived by the fact that you mentioned expulsion so directly, how can even the High Priest do that!\u201dReihausd stared at Heinz with expressionless eyes.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you expelled a family under the system of association! Priests are absolutely unacceptable.\u201dHis face, as he ran wild on the road, looked ridiculous.\u201cYou are having a big misunderstanding.\u201dReihausd sat in the chair slowly, staring at the other side.Heinz trembled with his fists at the arrogant attitude of the High Priest, who was much younger than him.\u201cThe decisive reason for the Ragefield family\u2019s expulsion\u2026\u201dHis eyes slowly turned to Haynes.Heinz, who met Reihausd\u2019 eyes, felt the boiling anger oxidize.His golden eyes terrifyingly made him feel frightened to live. It was like standing in front of a beast.\u201cBecause they\u2019re having a dirty deal with some rotten high-ranked priests.\u201dHeinz felt his throat clogged.\u201cI\u2019m saying that it\u2019s inside the Temple of Elium.\u201dIt was common for small noble families like Baron Ragefield to pay bribes to the priests of Elium, because it was necessary to stand out from the central aristocratic society through them.And Baron Ragefield was Heinz\u2019s line in Elium.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to cut out the rotten, but someone said it was great.\u201dHe could tell that he was seeing through everything. Reihausd raised the corners of his lips as he saw Heinz hesitated as he suddenly lost his temper.\u201cI\u2019m considering taking root in addition to cutting it out, what do you think, Chief Priest?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if they\u2019re the priests that serve God.\u201dAlthough the Saintess was brought by the High Priest, he had never covered her when the words of dissatisfaction about the Saintess\u2019 negligence came out.However, today\u2019s Reihausd was looking at Heinz with a suffocatingly cold gaze.\u201cI heard something was wrong with the Ares mine. Did they mention that monsters come out and dark energy flows out?\u201d\u201cH-High Priest\u2026!\u201dHeinz\u2019s face hardened.The Ares mine is so far away, and once you start touring, you may not know when you will be able to return to Elium. The environment there is famous for being barren.\u201cI\u2019m too old and weak, so\u2026\u201d\u201cI order the Chief Priest to directly investigate it.\u201d Reihausd\u2019s resolute voice pierced Heinz\u2019s ears.Heinz deeply regretted making a mistake with his mouth.***The day spent as the Saintess has passed moderately.Today, with the blessing of Hessed, I read a book and took a walk in the backyard.The Gods, who had been discussing hard, were silent for a while, even taking a nap. And in the late afternoon, while dressing up with the help of maids for the trip to the Imperial Palace, there was a sudden commotion outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cOne of the apprentice priestess has something to say to the Saintess and whines.\u201d\u201cShe has something to say to me?\u201dBecause I became curious, I told the maid.\u201cBring her. I\u2019ll listen to what she has to say.\u201dAfter a while, following the maids, a familiar apprentice priestess entered.She had dark blue short hair and a dark sky blue clunky dress. She was an apprentice priestess whom I met in the temple library a few days ago.Seeing me surrounded by the maids, the apprentice priestess knelt down on her knees in front of me.\u201cYou seem to be the apprentice priestess I saw last time. You came because you have something to say to me, right?\u201dAt my question, the child raised her head slightly and looked up at me. She must have been around sixteen, and she looked younger than I was here.\u201cI want to serve the Saintess closely.\u201d With that said, I looked into her black eyes for a long time.\u201cAt that time, I couldn\u2019t even say thank you. I\u2019m so grateful\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll receive your thanks well.\u201d I cut off her words and said firmly. \u201cBut with only the maids are enough for me.\u201dOriginally, the Saintess was followed by several priestesses in addition to the maids who took care of her.However, it was obvious why Reihausd didn\u2019t assign any priestess to me.Because I wasn\u2019t a real saint, and there was a risk that the priestesses would find out that I wasn\u2019t. So, unlike the priestesses who worked as believers with divine power, I was assigned a maid who worked for a salary without divine power.\u201cB-But!\u201d\u201cAnd the only reason I helped you back then was that he was covering the front of the bookshelf I needed.\u201d I said in a calm voice.Saying things like, \u2018Thank you for coming.\u2019 wasn\u2019t beneficial to this child.I spoke to the apprentice priestess in a cold, stern voice.\u201cThen will you leave now? As you can see, I\u2019m busy.\u201dBut Daisy still looked at me with eyes that didn\u2019t give up. She had a slight watery look in her eyes.\u201cNevertheless, I want to serve the Saintess.\u201dI let out a small sigh and decided to bite the maids for a moment.\u201cYou know.\u201dAfter all, it was only the two of us left, and I said to her.\u201cThere was a child near me named Annie who had been taking care of me for a long time.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes were looking at me as she knelt down on her floor.It could be seen that she was a qualitatively different child from Annie, but being my direct maid of honor was another matter.\u201cAnd she died a while ago. It\u2019s because she got hit by a sword.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes widened at those words.\u201cWhy do you think she died?\u201dI walked over to Daisy and looked down at her with my chin raised. It\u2019s not my taste to scare a child, but sometimes I have to.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only by playing the wrong tongue in front of me.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes shooked violently at my words. It was clear enough that fear had been planted in her dark eyes.\u201cI killed a skilled maid, but how long will your apprentice\u2019s life last?\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyebrows trembled.I stood up thinking that she would\u2019ve understood if I had done this much. Then I stared at her, expecting Daisy to run away with her tail.But she looked at her floor for a moment, clenching her fists, then suddenly raised her head and looked at me.\u201cEven so, I want to serve the Saintess by your side!\u201dI was taken aback by the child\u2019s words.Did you not understand when I said this could kill you?\u201cGrowing up as an orphan, it was very difficult to protect my own body. Luckily, I even became an apprentice priestess, so I thought I had power, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if he harassed me, I felt like I was going to die because my situation was so miserable that I had no choice but to suffer. I don\u2019t like myself because nothing has changed.\u201dI suddenly remembered my past life.It wasn\u2019t like a fairy tale.\u201cI have never, never really, ever received an apology from another noble. Even if they slapped me in the face first, I should have begged. But the day I got an apology from the believer\u2026 I realized that it was no longer my fault.\u201dHer clenched fists trembled.\u201cFor me at that time, the image of the Saintess was a ray of light for me, and I always wanted\u2026 It was the utopia I wanted to become.\u201dDaisy\u2019s determined eyes were looking up at me.She said, \u201cEven if I become a priestess anyway, I have to live my whole life serving God. If I\u2019m to serve for someone else, I hope that they will be the Saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid to die while taking care of the Saintess because it\u2019s not up to the Saintess\u2019 liking, but\u2026\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes were shining with will.\u201c\u2026I will try not to die.\u201dThe child\u2019s face\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s because it resembled my miserable life in the past when I was trying to survive somehow.A strange feeling filled my chest.\u201cI\u2019m not what you think I am.\u201dI\u2019m just a fake saintess, not a real saintess. Someone who will leave the temple soon.Despite my cold rejection, Daisy opened her mouth with an unchanging will.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the Saintess is.\u201dShe lay down in front of me again.\u201cSo please accept me!\u201dI let out a small sigh as I watched her lie flat on her face that her forehead almost touched her floor.\u2018She\u2019s a priestess.\u2019They\u2019re more educated than maids, and they\u2019re in a better position to have more power.\u201cWhich family are you from?\u201d I asked Daisy.She hurriedly raised her head and answered.\u201cI\u2019m from Viscount Saintcoast family. My parents passed away and I was adopted by my maternal uncle and is listed in the family register.\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, I opened my mouth.\u201cEven if you could endanger your life as well as the existence of your family if you take care of me, will this request change?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dDaisy replied as if she had nothing to think about. She must have been quite educated in the house she was adopted to.After a while, I parted my lips.\u201cThere is no use in regretting later.\u201dShe said she would take it, and there was no reason to stop her further. It\u2019s better for me to have at least a hand I can trust in moderation.\u201cThank you. Saintess!\u201d Daisy bowed her head and shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the coachman stopped the horses, a man in silver armor approached and opened the carriage door.The strong-bodied man then looked at me and bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m Dwayne, the 2nd Holy Knights\u2019 Commander. Today, I will escort the Saintess.\u201d He had brown hair and looked to be in his thirties.\u201cNice to meet you. Dwayne.\u201d After lightly greeting him, I got into the carriage.The inside of the carriage was more comfortable than expected, although it wasn\u2019t as good as the interior of the van.Sitting on the velvet soft seat, I leaned back.Today, I went to the Crown Prince\u2019s twentieth birthday banquet as the representative of the temple. This means that I\u2019m different from ordinary ladies who need an escort from a male partner.The sound of horses\u2019 hooves could be heard from the back of the carriage. The 2nd Holy Knights, including Dwayne, started marching and escorting.The speed of the carriage wasn\u2019t fast, and I looked outside, looking at the route until I left the huge temple.I had never been out of the temple until now, so I was just guessing, but the temple was probably much bigger than I thought.The horse didn\u2019t run, but anyway, it took more than 10 minutes to get out of the temple even at the speed of the carriage.\u2018I\u2019ll probably need a horse when I get out of here.\u2019I quietly added a horse to the plan.There is a stable in the main building and not far from where I live, so I think I should visit it often to learn.As I was thinking that if I had a notebook, I would write down my plan, I stared at the road leading from the end of the temple.As the temple wasn\u2019t located in a remote place, it wasn\u2019t long before a street that looked like a bustling street appeared.People were pouring flowers on both sides of the road, and some of them were praying while watching the carriage I rode.Saintess.A place where everyone is respected and welcomed.God\u2019s representative.And\u2026[The God of Love, Odyssey, is showing off.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, coughs in vain.][The God of Art, Mond, paints this landscape.]I thought about it before, but no matter how much I think about it, they are Gods close to attention seekers.\u201cAre they really Gods?\u201dIt was an awkward sentence structure without a subject, but I couldn\u2019t find more appropriate words.As if the Gods heard my words, the chat window flashed again.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, reveals his uneasy feelings.]\u201cWell, I\u2019m a fake saintess, so who knows if they\u2019re fake gods?\u201dIt was a word that I threw on purpose as if I was provoking them.But at that moment, there was a roar of thunder with a flash of lightning flashing from the sky. There was no rain, but it was a dry thunderbolt.After a while, I opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026Well, that\u2019s enough.\u201dNo further answers appeared in the dialog.Somehow, I remembered the faces of two children who were sulking.\u201cPfft.\u201dI burst out laughing. I felt a little lighter.\u2018Whatever.\u2019I decided to accept their existence.Even if they were Gods, they never reacted to what I was thinking, so they couldn\u2019t hear my thoughts.But when I moved or spoke, they reacted.[The God of Love, Odyssey, wonders what your laughter means.]\u2018I must say that I\u2019m fortunate that they don\u2019t interfere with my thoughts.\u2019As I was immersed in complicated thoughts, the carriage entered the Imperial Palace.A number of magnificently sized buildings similar to or slightly larger than the temple had a reddish-brown exterior that was different from the gray walls of the temple.Crossing the arched bridge, the carriage entered the palace. And passing through countless landscapes, I stopped in front of a magnificent building like the Seoul Arts Center.\u2018So you mean there\u2019s a second male lead over there, right?\u2019I thought, a little bit disheartened.The banquet hall was an exterior that anyone could see was built for performances or banquets.It was getting dark outside, and the banquet was gradually filling up with people.When I got off the carriage, the Paladins lined up and bowed to me. Holding on to the hem of the dress, I walked proudly along the blue carpet.A lot of the eyes of the knights and various nobles were focused on me, but I wasn\u2019t nervous.In my previous life, when I entered my father\u2019s house, the countless contemptuous gazes and harsh words poured out towards me.Compared to the war-like day-to-day, these curious glances rather belonged to the pleasant axis.\u2018Keep your head straight and look straight ahead. Walk with your back straight and your eyes clear.\u2019I had learned to arm myself in order not to look shabby and weak.I walked slowly into the banquet hall without turning my eyes to the ladies and nobles who were shouting at me.The orchestra was playing to lighten the atmosphere of the banquet, and servants carrying trays were walking around, handing out glasses of wine to the nobles.I continued walking along the carpet.And stared at the two thrones at the end of the long carpet.There was the Emperor in his mid-fifties with pale red hair wearing a heavy-looking crown, and the young Empress with blonde hair in her twenties.That man is the Emperor Lauchen Jansen Illide.\u2018And that woman\u2026\u2019I heard that the Empress Rose Elyde, who came three years ago, was the daughter of Count Michael.I saw a man standing next to the throne, dressed in a fine robe and wielding a long sword. He is probably the Crown Prince, the protagonist of this banquet.Even compared to Reihausd, his height, broad shoulders, and solid physique make him indistinguishable.Blood-red hair and deep red eyes like burning flames in sharp eyes.A man who will become the emperor of the empire, a man who is smarter and more sober than anyone else, but he lost his cold heart to the female lead, Camilla.\u2018Kyle Alexis Illide.\u2019Numerous medals on his indigo blue uniform proved his merits.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stood in front of the Emperor, his wife, and the Crown Prince. Then, holding the hem of the dress, I placed one hand on my chest and bowed politely to them.\u201cOn the occasion of the Crown Prince\u2019s twentieth birthday, we send the blessing of Elium to the Imperial Family.\u201d\u201cThank you, Saintess. Raise your head.\u201dI slowly lifted my head when I heard the calm voice of the Emperor.\u201cWith the protection of the Nine Gods, we deliver congratulations from Elium and all the temples.\u201dI glanced at Kyle\u2019s face.Dark and cold eyes, and even the slightly narrowed forehead for some reason as if he was seeing something uncomfortable.Ariel may not have met him once or twice, but I could sense that their relationship wasn\u2019t a good one.\u201cIn the beginning\u2026\u201dI could see his eyebrows wriggle, but I continued.Everyone was looking at me because the blessing of the temple was a very important procedure.\u201cWhen the Lord created our world and His power was divided into nine branches, the splendid power of charity inhabited the Empire, and the Empire of Illide prospered. And the God of Justice chose the Emperor, and the Empire came to power.\u201dLooking into his eyes, I spoke seriously.\u201cThe Crown Prince was born in Ciel\u2019s blessed month. He is wiser than anyone else to assist in government affairs and doesn\u2019t neglect theocracy, so virtue and blessings will bring more splendor to the Empire. We, Elium, are the servants and companions of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor\u2026\u201dHis cold eyes were still profane, but I didn\u2019t care and continued talking.\u201cCongratulations on the birthday of His Highness the Crown Prince, who is the only heir. May the blessing of Ciel, the God of Destruction, and the blessings of the other eight Gods rest upon you.\u201dAfter I finished speaking, I sighed in relief.Fortunately, there didn\u2019t seem to be a single blemish in the congratulatory speech I wrote.\u201cThen, now\u2026 \u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t like his openly cold expression, but I still had to do what I had to do.I bowed my head, turned over my hands, and reached out to ask for his hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe placed one of my hands on mine after a very long time, and the weight of it was transmitted through my palms.His hand was visible in sight.\u00a0Big, manly hands, long fingers, that rested on my hand.I wasn\u2019t used to being in contact with a man I had just met for the first time. However, since this scene was included in the traditional temple salutation ceremony, it could not be omitted.I leaned my head forward and my lips kissed the back of his hand.To be precise, the moment my lips touched, I pushed my lips inward a little so that only the philtrum came in contact.\u00a0In my ears, I heard the applause of the nobles celebrating the blessing of the temple.Oh, how humiliating it is to have to kiss the back of someone\u2019s hand in the presence of so many people.\u2018Why did Ariel want to do this so badly?\u2019After a while, I looked up, and his eyebrows were stiffer.\u2018Excuse me. I feel even worse.\u2019For a moment, his red lips were dangling.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dAnd it was then.Suddenly my vision flashed. I heard a bang and something exploded. Soon, it was filled with people screaming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He reached out one arm and pulled me back behind himA fluttering cape blocked my vision, and the scent of musk permeated through my sense of smell.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201dThe emperor got up and gave orders to the soldiers, and they ran hurriedly.\u201cOh my gosh\u2026\u201dThe empress covered his mouth with his hand and gave a shocked look. I could see a cloud of dust and scattering in front of me.\u201cL-Lightning!\u201d\u201cA thunderbolt struck the statue!\u201dThe circular banquet was half-roofed and half-open, it also was divided from the first emperor\u2019s statue. And when I came in earlier, the statue of the first emperor, who was boasting its dignity with copper, was fragmented and scattered on the floor.\u201cSuddenly, lightning struck from the sky! And the statue became like this!\u201dKyle slowly took his hand off the handle of his sword, thinking that the threat had disappeared.However, the sight in front of me was literally devastating. It was because the statue was shattered as if it had been hit by a bomb.\u201cIs there any injured person?\u201dThe Emperor asked in a heavy voice.The knights looked at the people around the shattered statue of the first emperor, and fortunately there were no injuries.No matter how hard the lightning struck, the copper was still shining red.\u201cHow come something so inauspicious\u2026\u201dThe Empress furrowed her eyebrows and placed her hand on her forehead.\u201cEmpress, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m dizzy. Phew.\u201dSuddenly I thought of something as I muttered a little.\u201c\u2026Hessed, it\u2019s you, right?\u201dAfter a while, a blue chat window appeared in front of her.[The God of Art, Mond, is uncomfortable with your smack.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, denies that it really wasn\u2019t him and just pretends to be struck by lightning.]\u201cHaa\u2026 I didn\u2019t think so.\u201dIt seems that the main culprits behind all this were the Gods.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is feeling unfair.]\u201cWhat do you mean unfair!\u201dI let out a small sigh and put my hand on my forehead.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, has become depressed.][The God of Art, Mond, clicks his tongue while looking at Hesed.]\u201cIt\u2019s an ominous sign.\u201d\u201cIf the first emperor statue is shattered, maybe it means that the Empire will be shattered when the Crown Prince ascends to the throne.\u201dMeanwhile, I could hear the nobles talking in low voices behind me.I looked around my surroundings.Everyone had eyes full of fear at the unexpected situation.And I could see the back of the prince standing with his cool eyes.What is he thinking now as he sees the statue that has been shattered?\u201c\u2026\u201dA strange feeling pierced my chest.Maybe because it was Ariel\u2019s body who liked him.Then, the Empress\u2019 voice was heard again.\u201cI don\u2019t know why God was angry when the Saintess visited and even gave blessing for the first time in a long time.\u201dShe shook her head with her fan open and mixed her sigh as she said.The roaring of the nobles grew louder, and Kyle stood still with his cold eyes shining.Mm. But come to think of it, it seems that the two of them are not on good terms with each other.Well sure enough, how close would he be with his father\u2019s second wife?\u201cIt\u2019s an ignorant request, but Saintess, please pray for the Empire when you come back to the temple.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s voice was heard.All of a sudden, this series of lightning events was becoming a reality as a result of God\u2019s wrath.But I couldn\u2019t get over this situation like this.What if he had a grudge against me because this happened after receiving my congratulatory speech?In the original story, Kyle Alexis played a decisive role in Ariel\u2019s death. I had to keep a good relationship with Kyle to avoid the death route.I opened my mouth as everyone looked at me.\u201cYour Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dHe turned around slowly with his eyebrows hardened, his eyes glaring coldly.\u201cGod expressed His satisfaction.\u201d\u201c\u2026Satisfaction?\u201d Kyle asked with a firm face, as if asking what that meant.In the chilly atmosphere of the hall, my words spread and the atmosphere became quiet as if I had sprayed water.The Empress opened her lips as if that was nonsense.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the meaning of the words of the Saintess.\u201dThe Emperor also added a word.\u201cSaintess. What do that mean?\u201dAn angry expression as if I was fanning a fire.Of course, the banquet had reached this point, and I understood how absurd it was when I said that.But I didn\u2019t care and opened my mouth.\u201cHis Highness was born in Ciel\u2019s month with Ciel\u2019s blessing. Destruction is creation, and destruction is the source of all great things. That\u2019s its mother.\u201dAll people in this world have different gods protecting them depending on the month they were born, but in Kyle\u2019s case, it was Ciel, the God of Destruction. That\u2019s why the congratulatory speech also included Ciel.In other words, the fact that the bronze statue was destroyed by lightning strikes could be a plausible reason that Ciel was satisfied.The omnipotent power that destroys everything!That is the power and blessing of Ciel, the God of Destruction.\u201cW-what such nonsense\u2026\u201dThe Empress\u2019s bewildered voice was heard, but it was buried in the Emperor\u2019s exclamation.\u201cCiel\u2019s blessing! Is that what it looks like in the Saintess\u2019 eyes?\u201dI nodded at the Emperor\u2019s words. Fortunately, as expected, the crowd was easily swept away.\u201cIndeed\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou mean we saw divine power?\u201d\u201cSurely, it is true that His Highness was born on Ciel\u2019s moon. No one was injured too.\u201dPublic opinion quickly changed and the nobles were congratulating Kyle. And at that moment, a strange light seemed to pass through his eyes.\u201cIt seems that Ciel is overjoyed to celebrate Your Highness\u2019 birthday. Your Highness.\u201d\u201cI congratulate you, Your Highness.\u201dThe scene of the bloody banquet warmed up quickly again.The Empress, whose expression wasn\u2019t so good, could be seen rising as if to leave her seat.The atmosphere was buzzing, music was playing, and some old nobles approached and talked to the Emperor.In a quickly disorganized atmosphere, Kyle looked at the Empress with a cool expression and turned to me.\u201cThen enjoy the banquet.\u201dI quickly lowered my gaze a little before he said anything.Now that Hessed has dealt with the situation, it is time for the fake saintess to leave.I bowed my head to him once more and turned back quietly. I felt his gaze on the back of my head.\u201cPhew.\u201dI have to tell the Gods one word at a time to never hit anything with a thunderbolt again. And I thought I should investigate the relationship between the Empress and the Crown Prince.The complicated thoughts made my steps faster, yet Kyle\u2019s sudden voice stopped me.\u201cSaintess.\u201dA loud, low-pitched sound pierced my ears.Standing still, I agonized for a moment.\u2018Should I pretend I didn\u2019t hear it and leave?\u2019But as his footsteps drew closer, my options were diminishing. Soon, I heard a low voice near my ear.\u201cThe banquet has just begun.\u201dIn the original story, Kyle had no interest in Ariel. If anything, it was close to contempt. But today he stopped me as I left.\u201c\u2026\u201dI looked back at him with an awkward expression, and a strong gaze from his deep red eyes caught my eye.Then came a soft voice that I never imagined would come out of his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go and leave me like this, are you?\u201dWhat is this? What else is wrong with him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said that he had no interest in women because he was only interested in swords and politics.Camila was described as the first woman to get his attention.But why is he showing so much interest in me?\u201cSaintess.\u201dWhen I heard his voice, I got a hold of myself.Those red eyes were asking me for an answer.I struggled to understand his intention, and eventually asked back with an awkward expression.\u201cIs there anything you need from me?\u201d It was a small voice only he could hear.He frowned at my words.A cool scent entered the tip of my nose, and his soft voice could be heard in my ears.\u201cYou\u2019re a little weird today.\u201dI was taken aback by his words, but I answered without panicking.\u201cWhat is something weird that you\u2019re talking about?\u201dHis eyebrows twitched at my words.\u201cI\u2019m talking about you conveying the will of God and interpreting the lightning as a blessing.\u201dHe knew I was a fake saintess.It was because actually, he was the main culprit in establishing me as a fake saintess along with Reihausd.Then I heard his cold voice.\u201cYou\u2019ve done a lot of deeds, so you\u2019re done with today\u2019s work, are you not?\u201dIsn\u2019t that a win-win for each other?\u201cIt seems that the atmosphere has changed enough for people to misunderstand.\u201dI spoke calmly to his voice.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve just been living recklessly so far, so I\u2019ve decided to change now.\u201dI used the \u2018reformed character\u2019 skill that I used on Reihausd again.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a moment of silence, his soft voice was heard.\u201cThat\u2019s your resolution, but you haven\u2019t forgotten to explain yourself today, did you?\u201dThe moment I met his dark red eyes, my shoulders flinched.A sudden anxiety flooded my mind when he said something needed to be explained.As I looked at him with unfamiliar eyes, I heard that voice continuously.\u201cThe marriage proposal letter you sent me last time.\u201dAnd at that moment I looked up at him with a look of surprise as I froze. I knew that Ariel in the original had a crush on Prince Kyle. But\u2026\u2018Did she send him a proposal letter?\u2019I couldn\u2019t help but panic because I didn\u2019t know that.He told me. \u201cYou asked for an answer by today.\u201dI was getting dizzy.\u2018Oh, Ariel.\u2019Prince Kyle patted my shoulder and started walking forward. After all, the center of the banquet hall was the dance floor of the nobles, so even if the main character of the banquet was absent for a while, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.I regretted seeing his shoulders getting farther away.\u2018When the statue was struck by lightning, I should\u2019ve just gone back to the temple.\u2019But I have already made a choice, and the time has come to deal with the unexpected actions of Ariel in the past.Anyway, my answer is\u2026Politely decline.Sternly refuse.It will be one of the two.Still, the fact that I shielded him today worked well, so I just hope the result comes out with number one.I clenched my fists and followed him out to the balcony. There was no one on the glass balcony, which was quite spacious.I closed the door to avoid noise from going out.He slowly turned towards me.His red hair, against the moonlight, fluttered in a subtle color. I thought as I looked at his red lips that seemed a little twisted, his expression that didn\u2019t look pleasant at all.It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re already in a \u2018moderately good relationship\u2019, but it\u2019s still a human relationship, isn\u2019t it?I could see him opening his lips with a stiff expression.\u201cI knew that you\u2019re bold and foolhardy, but I never expected you to send such a letter.\u201dLife seemed to flow like an illusion in the bloody eyes that seemed to draw out a sword at any moment.\u2018Ariel\u2026 It\u2019s not a duel letter, it\u2019s a proposal letter, right?\u2019I swallowed my tears inside.\u201cWriting a letter like that, did you have any awareness as the Saintess?\u201dThinking that the answer might be closer to the sword he was wearing, I beat him first.\u201cThe proposal letter was a mistake.\u201dHis eyebrows rose at my words.\u201cMistake?\u201dI don\u2019t know the contents of the proposal letter, but what Ariel would write was no different from the childishness of the congratulatory speech.\u201cWas that a mistake?\u201d\u201cYes. I think I accidentally drank something like alcohol and got drunk.\u201dI couldn\u2019t come up with any more excuses than this in my head.\u201cPerhaps I was drunk and wrote it randomly, and sent it to His Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dI immediately said with a sincere expression of sorry on my face.\u201cI deeply apologize.\u201dI didn\u2019t really feel sorry for something that I didn\u2019t do, but I couldn\u2019t explain in detail that it was what the owner of the body did.\u2018It\u2019s annoying, so let\u2019s do it like this.\u2019\u201cStill, I helped Your Highness earlier, so please let that make up for my mistake.\u201dIn my opinion, this is something I can ask for.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA long silence passed between the two of us.He stared at me for a long time with red eyes mixed with a mysterious light, and then reached out to me.I could feel his hand touching my chin. After a while. My head was raised towards him.\u201c\u2026\u201dI thought that facing him this close was quite awkward. Isn\u2019t it a way that would go well with the main character, Camilla?\u2018I\u2019ll let you go to this extent.\u2019\u201cMistake, I made a mistake.\u201dHe opened his mouth as he looked into my trembling eyes.\u201cIt was pretty specific for a mistake. It\u2019s shocking.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand the contents of the letter, so I just shut my mouth and looked at him. His lips twisted in a strange shape.\u201cIt\u2019ll come right into my hand, and the Empire will be overturned if it\u2019s known that the Saintess has written such a thing.\u201dAnyway, I was slowly starting to get ominous.\u2018What the hell kind of letter Ariel wrote?\u2019Is that something more childish than the congratulatory message I wrote last time?\u201cActually, I can\u2019t remember the contents of the letter.\u201d I forcefully smiled.Then he raised his eyebrows and growled. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201dHis eyes were bloody, and I looked at him with a trembling heart.\u201cWhat you think about me every night, and what kind of love you want to share.\u201d\u201c\u2026I beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cAnd how happy you would be if I accepted your proposal, did you say that you wrote it down in such detail and don\u2019t remember it?\u201dI felt like my brain stopped at that moment.\u201cIt was eight chapters long. I mean that narration.\u201dAriel\u2026 You darn, Ariel!\u2018So, you. Did you write an adult novel in that proposal letter?\u2019What the hell was going on in your head to do that to Kyle!I was dazed and unable to speak for a long time, then barely opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026I, I actually shoved the whole bottle into my throat. So I don\u2019t remember. I apologize.\u201dHearing my words, his eyes grew sharper. Soon he said.\u201cThere are a lot of cases where one drinks and be honest. I\u2019m talking about the basic needs.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very honest. That\u2019s just crazy.\u201dI shook my head, slightly twitching my lips.I don\u2019t know why I should be so ashamed when Ariel was the one who did it, but it was insanely shameful.\u201cSo please pretend that never happened.\u201dI just got you out of the danger of being tarnished by a statue explosion.\u201cI hope you can accept Ciel\u2019s blessing today as part of my apology.\u201dOf course, that also seems to be due to me somehow.\u201cI apologize for bothering you all this time. The same goes for obscene letters such as sexual harassment. Now that I am faithful to my role, there will be no such unfortunate incident again\u2026\u201d\u201cYou.\u201d He interrupted my explanations from time to time. A harsh voice and subtle eyes that make my heart sink. \u201cAre you making fun of me now?\u201dI blinked at that moment. I felt that his gaze was strongly interrogating my true intentions.\u201cYes? Making fun of you?\u201d\u201cWhen I received the letter,\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t sleep for several nights and how\u2026!\u201dKyle cut off what he was saying. I could see his red eyes twinkling with a dangerous light.It was time for Kyle to open his mouth again, growling with a terrifying force.Boom!Suddenly, a roar was heard. Out of a sudden, a big thunderbolt fell on the side of the garden fountain.I heard the sound of the garden fountain rattling loudly with the light, then he frowned and looked away. I had a gut feeling that one of the Gods was doing it to help me, so I quickly pushed him away and ran out of the balcony.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thanks to that, I was the one being shamed for being innocent.\u201cIt would be better to have it sooner.\u201dWhen I recalled Kyle\u2019s stiffened eyebrows and eyes that looked like it could eat me, my spine felt cold.\u2018As I expected, it would be better to advance the escape and self-reliance plan.\u2019Daisy\u2019s eyes that wanted to serve only me came to mind, but I struggled to shake it off.After all, the priests and priestesses are no different from civil servants, but she will be able to live well without me.I took out the schedule I had written down with impatient eyes. I thought I should look for a cheaper store or house.It was about time to go through the real estate books again.\u201c\u2026\u201dSuddenly something came to mind as I paused and stopped my hand.Isn\u2019t there a better way than buying a house with this hard-earned money? And after a while he opened my mouth.\u201cExcuse me, Gods?\u201dThe chat window flashed. It was a signal that the Gods were responding.I smiled and pointed to one of the Gods.\u201cMond. Help me a bit.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, answers your call.]***After a while.I strangled Reihausd in order to participate in a charity art auction.\u201cThis earthenware was donated by Count Balmer. The urn used to hold holy water in the ancient temple of Euros, the number will start from 100 franc.\u201dI was sitting side by side with Dwayne, the saint whom he had attached, and I was wearing a plain dress like an aristocratic lady as I was bothered to be found out as the Saintess.The auction house was putting up the treasured possessions brought by the nobles.\u201c100 franc!\u201d\u201c120 franc!\u201d\u201c150 franc!\u201d\u201c200 franc!\u201d\u201cIs there no more? 200 franc, 200 franc, 200 franc! Sold!\u201d\u2018To. What?\u2019In an instant, a pottery that looked like it was made by an elementary school student was sold for 200 franc.Since 1,000 franc is the cost of living for commoners a year, it is quite a high price.[The God of Art, Mond, clicks his tongue.]A chat window was flashing in front of me.The way I decided to make money was through an \u2018art auction\u2019.Why, doesn\u2019t it often appear on the news? I\u2019m talking about the story of how the item that was sold at a low price at an auction was actually a treasure and became a billionaire.I decided to make good use of this point because the God of the Emotion of Art, no, the God of Art was with me.I\u2019m lucky that the Gods were very interested in me and eager to help me although I don\u2019t know why.After a while, a portrait appeared in a pretty frame, studded with dazzling jewels. It is said that that is the pre-wedding appearance of Princess Eugenia, who passed away 100 years ago.I looked at the chat window because it looked beautiful and luxurious to me, but there was no response.\u201c300 franc!\u201d\u201c500 franc!\u201d\u201c1,000 franc!\u201dThe portrait quickly went up for bid and eventually sold for 2,000 franc.\u2018Ah, I should have bought it!\u2019But it was also a price that I couldn\u2019t buy as I had only 300 francs saved anyway.I tried to hide my bitterness.The next item that came out was a small dagger. The crude-shaped dagger was inside the scabbard, and a little blue light flowed through it. The scabbard and sword handle that looked like they were rusted were proof of the dagger\u2019s age.Then the chat window flashed.[The God of Art, Mond, looks carefully at the sword.]\u2018Oho.\u2019I leaned forward and began to focus on the object.\u201cThis dagger was donated by Marquis Altmer. Created by a foreign artist in a mixture of dragon bone and bronze, it is a simple yet beautiful piece of art that contains the awe of the Gods. Again, this is a noble dagger with dragon bones in it. It\u2019s not easy to see items like this on the auction house.\u201dPeople\u2019s murmurs were heard at the word \u2018dragon bone\u2019. I don\u2019t know, but it was probably a rare and expensive material.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even mix a tenth of it, and they call it all dragon bones.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just by looking at it, the color is not good. What do you mean noble dagger? Tsk, tsk.\u201dA terrifying voice was heard from behind.A special thing called truffle-containing with the addition of 0,0001% percent truffle seems to be happening here as well. That\u2019s why people seem to have lost interest in precious materials.Is that sword really like that?[The God of Art, Mond, looks at the sword with a serious expression.]After a while the auction started again.\u201cI will start from 50 franc.\u201dEven if it is 50 franc, it is by no means a small amount, as it is close to 1 million won if replaced in modern terms.\u201c50 franc!\u201dBut 50 franc came out easily among the crowd. Many aristocrats wanted to show off their wealth at charity auctions.With nervous eyes, I waited until Mond\u2019s verdict came out.\u2018Mond, hurry up!\u2019\u201c50 franc! 50 f\u2026!\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, points out the dagger.]\u201c100 franc!\u201dI hurriedly picked up the plate with 100 franc written on it.People\u2019s eyes turned to me, and some of them smiled. I seemed to be an ignorant girl who wasted money. Even the nobleman who called 50 franc out was smiling and whispering to the person next to him.\u201c100 franc! 100 franc! 100 franc, sold!\u201dFortunately, no one called out more than me. So I was able to win the dagger.I could feel Dwayne looking back at me with a puzzled expression on my happy face.\u2018I\u2019m telling you that I have plans for everything!\u2019I stood up with a triumphant expression on my face.After a while, I paid the price and received the dagger and headed straight for the downtown area.\u201cI have a place I need to stop by. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cYes, I will go with you.\u201d Dwayne replied without saying a word, nodding his head.\u201cMond. This is really expensive, right? It looks cheap.\u201d\u00a0I put my hand to my mouth and covered it, then asked in a low voice.Soon, the chat window flickered and a text came to mind.[The God of Art, Mond, criticizes your eyes with an arrogant expression.]\u201cIf it\u2019s not true, just wait and see.\u201d I muttered to myself and continued walking down the road with the dagger in my hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter passing a few winding alleys, I saw a huge three-story building with a sign saying, \u2018Lloyd\u2019s Merchant\u2019.\u2018Lloyd.\u2019I remembered this name in the original story very well.\u2018Cass Lloyd\u2019 is the name of the empire\u2019s biggest merchant and one of the three male leads of the original story.Because he was the heir to this merchant.It is said that he\u2019s the heir, but he was like a real manager who had already inherited the merchant management from his father, the Great Merchant Owner.Of course, I didn\u2019t come here to meet him.He was the only one of the three male leads who had no contact with Ariel at all, and I had no intention of making that contact.It was just to take advantage of the fact that \u2018Lloyd\u2019s Merchant\u2019 is buying a variety of rare items, and they have a lot of skilled appraisers. Because I had to get the price for this dagger properly.\u201cHow did you get here?\u201dAs I entered the lobby on the first floor of the merchant, the guide asked me politely.\u201cI came here because I have something I want to sell.\u201dI showed the old dagger.\u201cIf you go up the stairs, there is an appraiser, so you can get an appraisal and decide whether to sell it or not.\u201dIt seemed that there was indeed a systematic manual.I went up the stairs he showed me and entered the large room leading to it.Upon entering the room, a turban-wearing appraiser with exotic dark skin was sitting at the desk. I greeted him and handed the dagger.\u201cI want this dagger to be appraised.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to sell it after being appraised, is it fine for me to get 5 franc as an appraisal fee?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201dHe placed the winning dagger in his hand and began to examine it carefully. The dagger held in his crude fingertips looked ordinary no matter how I looked at it, but I decided to trust Mond.\u201c\u2026\u201dThere were several tools on his desk, such as a magnifying glass and a level, which he used to inspect the dagger several times.It was a meticulous observation that was worth 5 franc as an appraisal fee.\u201cIt\u2019s a good item.\u201d Soon his voice was heard.My heart started pounding.I thought that a life-changing opportunity might be right in front of me.The overseas cases I saw on the news flashed through my mind.\u201cThe purity of the dragon bone is quite high.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, shrugs.]I asked, thinking that if I make a lot of money, I should also set up a new Mond statue.\u201cSo how much is the appraised value?\u201dWith the dagger set down on the desk, the appraiser opened his mouth.\u201cThe model year isn\u2019t that old, so the value of a dragon bone is greater than its value as a dagger, and I think we can blow up to 300 franc with this weight.\u201d\u201c300 franc?\u201d I opened my eyes wide and asked.In fact, I would be lying if I said there was no slight disappointment. However, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to come up with a work of art of great value that is life-changing at such a charity auction.Still, 300 franc is not a bad price.\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201dI bought this dagger for 100 franc, so if I sell it for 300 francs, I get 200 franc. The amount of money that was 300 franc became 500 franc when it came out.\u201cI will sell it.\u201d I answered straight away without hesitation.Then the appraiser took a gold coin from the bag next to him and handed it to me. It was a very neat deal.The moment I accepted it, a new blue window appeared.[You have accumulated wealth through the help of God.][The \u2018Shop\u2019 feature has been unlocked.]I wondered what it meant, but there was an appraiser in front and Dwayne behind me, so I pretended I didn\u2019t see it and put the money in my pocket.\u201cGo back.\u201d And I ordered Dwayne.As I was leaving the merchant building, I heard Dwayne\u2019s voice.\u201cHow did you know its worth?\u201d Perhaps in his eyes it would appear that I knew the value of the dagger and acted that way.It was natural for him to be puzzled. Ariel had a complex birth environment, where her mother was a baroness and her father was a servant.Thanks to that, she spent her childhood in the slums without knowing her mother\u2019s face by the family who tried to hide the infidelity, and if Reihausd hadn\u2019t selected her as the Saintess when she was 15, she would be working at a bar by now.\u201cGod told me.\u201d I answered Dwayne with a brazen face.In fact, what I said was also true. It\u2019s because God really told me.[The God of Art, Mond, is satisfied with your sincerity.]\u2018Now the only thing left to do is sweep away valuable auction items with Mond.\u2019I\u2019ll probably do it many times better than just saving money.If I continue to receive help from God, is it a big deal to be tens of times the money I earn?Thinking of the future where I quickly became rich, I smiled contentedly as I walked. The steps back to the temple were very light.***\u201cYou\u2019re here. Saintess.\u201dAs I entered the temple, Daisy in the uniform of an apprentice priestess greeted me with a welcoming smile. Dwayne no longer followed me, and I walked down the hallway with Daisy towards my room.\u201cI received education for five days to serve the Saintess . I have the confidence to do well, so please leave it to me.\u201d She blushed slightly while looking determined.\u201cDaisy, bring me some violet cookies. The tea will be apple tea.\u201dAt my words, Daisy was silent for a moment, then she looked at me and then bowed her head in surprise. Her eyes were twinkling as she raised her head.\u201cI understand. Saintess. I\u2019ll bring it to you right now!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026 thank you!\u201d Daisy seemed happy that I had ordered her something.I smiled, nodded my head, and went into the room alone.\u2018Yeah, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to feel like raising a younger sister.\u2019Soon after, I sat down at my desk where the sun was shining, and the chat window that had been made transparent was made darker.[The \u2018Shop\u2019 feature has been unlocked.]I thought this time, I should know what this is.***If I could summarize what I found out after possessing the fake saintess in this original story, it was as follows.First of all, I had an open function called [Oracle], similar to the principle of Internet broadcasting, and the Gods could enter the oracle and provide training or help.The oracle had a garden, and there were levels. There were probably other Gods besides the three Gods, but it seemed that the garden was full and they couldn\u2019t enter.And among the help they could give, there were \u2018Sensitivity\u2019 and \u2018Blessing\u2019.The ability related to the Gods temporarily rose when \u2018Blessing\u2019 was received because \u2018Sensitivity\u2019 was low in terms of oracle level.Also, I don\u2019t know why, but the Gods of the oracle were all kind to me.To the extent that it was awkward for me, who had never received much favor from others.So, I decided to make money by distinguishing valuable art works as an oracle with the \u2018God of Art, Mond\u2019. Probably, in terms of the game, it\u2019s like receiving a huge buff.And another feature that was unlocked\u2026 \u2018Shop\u2019.I muttered quietly.\u201cShop.\u201dThen, the blue window in front of me shimmered and opened wide.[You can use the Shop function.]Even when I was given an oracle in the form of a game chat window, I was like it\u2019s possible, but to this extent!All games have a feature called \u2018Shop\u2019. It\u2019s also an essential function to buy and sell necessary items.\u201cWow.\u201dA window like the shop page of the game interface appeared in front of my eyes. The currency was franc as expected, and 500 franc appeared on the balance.Most of the items were marked with locks, so I couldn\u2019t even see what they were.A small amount of health potion or divine potion, and a few material items were also seen in the miscellaneous goods category. Such potions and simple ingredients were activated so that even a person with a level one oracle could purchase them.It didn\u2019t look very useful, but because it was sold in a store, it was all endowed with divine power.\u2018Saying it, I would call it [Holy Relic Shop].\u2019I moved my gaze to look around the shop, and then shut down the shop function after a while.There was nothing to buy yet, but as the oracle level rises, I will gradually see useful items. The more buffs that helped me to adapt and live in this unfamiliar place, the better.[As a reward for opening the Shop, you will be given an \u2018All-purpose Pocket\u2019.]And as soon as I closed the shop, another message popped up.I found a red pocket on my hand. It was designed like a lucky bag on New Year\u2019s Day, and it seemed somehow mysterious.When I opened it, another blue window in front of me flickered.Without hesitation, I put my franc in my pocket.All 500 franc were in the small pocket, but from the outside it didn\u2019t look like there was money in it. However, there was a change in the blue window in front of me.[Your Money: 500 franc]Oho, it\u2019s great.Knowing the wallet function, I stared at the window with a satisfied expression.\u2018Let\u2019s run until the day when this wallet is full of my wealth.\u2019[The God of Art, Mond, shakes his head at your material desire.]\u201cYou can\u2019t do this as an accomplice.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, asserts that art can\u2019t be judged by material values.]\u2018You were the most excited one during the auction.\u2019I pouted my lips.But at that moment. A new blue window appeared before my eyes.[The Gods have activated a hidden mission for you through a meeting.][Hidden Mission : Prove your faith through donation.][Reward : ???]It\u2019s a hidden mission.\u2018What is it?\u2019I narrowed my eyes and looked at the message.\u201cMond? Hessed? Odyssey?!\u201d[Are you sure you want to donate all the money in the All-purpose Pocket?(Yes/No)]At those words, I jumped.\u201cWhat?\u201dMy hands were shaking and my lips were dry in an instant.No, I earned all of this money but suddenly you want me to donate them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Translated by lipzoldyckIt was really difficult to get permission from Reihausd to go out. It\u2019s the money I earned as if I was walking on thin ice, but I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re talking about donating!\u201cExcuse me, Gods.\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIsn\u2019t this too much?\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, shuts his mouth firmly.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, looks elsewhere.][The God of Love, Odyssey, pretends not to hear.]I stared at the still floating chat window for a long time.[Are you sure you want to donate all the money in the All-purpose Pocket?(Yes/No)]For a while, I thought about whether I should give up on this hidden mission. As expected, because I felt like money was going to be wasted.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut after a while, I had a thought.\u2018Why are they suddenly asking for a donation?\u2019Is it because the three Gods are tormenting me?No. By now, they have helped me all the way throughout the oracle. Like my guardian deity at every moment.\u2018Then it wouldn\u2019t be bad for me, would it?\u2019They looked a little childish, but they weren\u2019t bad Gods.I made up my mind again.\u2018Yes. After all, I can make money quickly\u2026\u2019\u201cYes.\u201dAs I pointed to \u2018Yes\u2019 with my hand, the red pocket I was holding lit up. And the funds in the inventory were changed to 0 franc.I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment, but I waited for a change.After a while, a new window appeared.[You have demonstrated your sincerity by giving what is most valuable to you in the present.][The three Gods have agreed to unlock your sacred power.][Pure sacred power resides in the body of the one chosen by the Gods.][\u2018Sacred Power\u2019 is unlocked.]A dark golden light shone like the wind around my body and began to spin around. I slowly reached out to the band of gold. It felt warm when the golden light touched my finger. It was like basking in the heat of a fireplace.The golden glow that wrapped around my body several times began to fade.And the fact that it was being absorbed into me could be seen through the skin all over my body. It felt like a warm blanket was rolling over my body.When the brilliance had completely disappeared, a warm aura wafted around my heart.I reached out and looked at my palm.\u2018\u2026Hm? Wait.\u2019It was an empty palm, no different from before. Even the warmth of my heart was gradually cooling down.I muttered in a puzzled voice.\u201cWhat is it, is this right?\u201dAs if everything had been an illusion for a while, the current state was tno different from before.Just when I doubted that they were only taking my 500 franc in the name of a donation, a chat window popped up.[The \u2018God of Love, Odyssey\u2019 congratulates you on the opening of your sacred power and blesses you.][The \u2018God of Knowledge, Hessed\u2019 congratulates you on the opening of your sacred power and blesses you.][The \u2018God of Art, Mond\u2019 congratulates you on the opening of your sacred power and blesses you.]The wind started to blow over me again.The feeling similar to when I received a blessing from Hessed was subtly different.If at that time it felt like the wind was blowing towards me, it would be more accurate to express it as the feeling of being strongly inhaling the wind that is blowing right now. Like a black hole.The wind tangled and the blessings of the Gods surrounded me then flowed into me.Closing my eyes for a moment and tasting the feeling, I raised my eyelashes.First of all, I felt the blessing of Hessed, and my head became very clear as I had experienced before. No, it was clearer than it was back then. I feel smart enough to chew through dozens of books.Next, I felt like my eyes were opening.The interior that I thought was quite luxurious suddenly looks tacky, and I can see the detailed grooves and scratches of the chandelier, which is the blessing of Mond\u2026 Maybe it was close to a side effect. Seeing the dust on the vase feels so annoying.\u2018By the way, didn\u2019t Odyssey also give a blessing?\u2019I felt the energy of blessings in my body again, but I didn\u2019t feel the energy of blessing related to love.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dWell, since I don\u2019t know anyone who loves me and I don\u2019t know love, I thought that the blessing might not be applicable.Anyway, my condition, blessed by the Gods, has risen to the very best.With my head cleared, I opened the thickest dictionary among the mountains of books on my desk. It was to find the \u2018sacred power\u2019 I had seen earlier.I had to find out what it was as it was the ability I had.\u201cI found it.\u201dFortunately, there was a page about sacred power, so I opened it. And I started to read quickly from the first line.[The power that priests use is called divine power, and the power that a saintess uses is called holy power. Because of these terms, it is easy to misunderstand the meaning of sacred power, which is a completely separate term from this concept.Divine power and holy power can be said to be the Gods pouring of power into a small and large bowl of water. The divine power is usually in a small bowl of water for humans, and the holy power is in the large bowl of the saintess who is the only servant of the Gods.However, the sacred power is like connecting a large tube between the Gods and humans, so one can use enormous amounts of power as if it were a God\u2019s agent.And the first and last person in history to use\u00a0 the concept of sacred power was the First Saintess, Bergheritta.]The First Saintess, Bergheritta, who existed 500 years ago, was something I saw in the book at first glance.The Saintess who rebuilt a devastated empire with the First Emperor, wiped the tears of those who lost their home, and raised the orphans with her own hands.Her contribution was great in establishing the theocracy and the monarchy as the two major mountain ranges in the Empire.\u2018But the sacred power\u2026 It\u2019s like a faucet connected to the Gods?\u2019It is said that it was a different kind of power from the \u2018holy power\u2019 used by other saints in general.The water that spills out when I turn on the faucet suddenly came to my mind.\u2018Haha, no way.\u2019I\u2019m a fake saintess.\u2018It\u2019s strange that I, who has to step aside when the real saintess appears, use the immense power of sacred power.\u2019That\u2019s ridiculous.In fact, after possessing Ariel\u2019s body, it has been a series of nonsensical things.It was the moment when I closed the book and opened my hand, which had been soaked with holy power, again with doubtful eyes.Knock, knock, just in time, a knock was heard.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe door opened and Reihausd entered.As always, he was still handsome in his white uniform, a priest\u2019s uniform. His blonde hair was well-groomed, and his presence alone made him look like a divine angel who came down from heaven.But the fear planted after seeing him kill Annie reflexively made my fingertips tremble the moment I saw him.My eyes keep falling on the long sword worn around his waist.\u201cI apologize. I thought you were Daisy.\u201dI apologized to him for being rude. But he stood silently at the door as if my apology hadn\u2019t been heard. without saying anything.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd so a long silence began.Why did he suddenly come into my room?Maybe Dwayne said something to him.It seems like I\u2019m collecting money by selling my auctioned dagger at a high price, or it seems like I\u2019m preparing for a night escape\u2026Since he was a paladin under the High Priest, it was strange not to report to him.The silence grew deeper and deeper. And I was starting to get a little nervous.As Annie\u2019s face, who had been dying without a scream, came to mind, and my eyes fell on the handle of his sword again, he took a step. He then started coming towards me slowly.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs Reihausd stopped in front of me, I looked at him with a slightly nervous expression.I couldn\u2019t analyze what he was thinking in his dark gold eyes, even if Hessed\u2019s blessing had come.After a while he opened his lips.\u201cYou can do it.\u201dI was startled for a moment by the low voice coming from his red lips. As I looked at him with unfamiliar eyes, he spoke again.\u201cSpeak informally.\u201dAt that, I looked at him in amazement.What did this scary man say?However, his complexion was somewhat strange.\u2018\u2026Were Reihausd\u2019s cheeks so red in the first place?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sir Reihausd.\u201d\u201cGet rid of the \u2018sir\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dI was bewildered at his words.\u2018Just call him by name like a friend?\u2019Why is he making such a request when he knows better than anyone that Ariel is the fake saintess he has established?In the original story, Ariel always called him \u2018High Priest\u2019, and, of course, she used it with honorifics.But this situation right now\u2026\u201cNo matter how much I think about it, that a bit\u3161\u201dAt my words, for a moment, I could see his forehead narrowing. Then his expression changed drastically and hardened again.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d He suddenly touched his forehead with his hand. A small voice seemed to come from his mouth.\u201cI made a mistake all of a sudden. Hoo.\u201dHis cheeks were still red, and I could hear rough breathing from his slightly open lips.I asked him with a worried look.\u201cAre you feeling sick?\u201dTaking his hand off his forehead, he said with a strange frown. The disheveled blonde bangs made his troubled eyes look strangely decadent.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s just weird today\u2026 I can\u2019t stand it when I see you\u2026\u201dHis golden eyes shook as he met my eyes. After looking into my eyes for a while, he suddenly looked away.\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but be nervous because his face looked very distressed.Does he have to kill someone every few days?He trembled uncontrollably and spoke to me as if he was in pain with his shining eyes.\u201cBecause I miss you\u2026 No, I\u2019m just here to greet you. As soon as I see you today\u2026 No, it\u2019s the feeling of discomfort inside my head.\u201dA voice that became more husky than usual was heard in my ears. There was strength in his clenched fists.After touching his forehead again, he was a man who seemed to be in agony, but today I felt that the reason that had bound him tightly had loosened to a serious extent.As the High Priest, it seems unlikely that he would drink that much alcohol.\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s feeling sick somewhere.\u201dAfter he left, I muttered as I looked at the closed door.\u201cWill he be okay?\u201dMaybe he has a high fever.Still, there are a lot of priests, so if he\u2019s sick, he will be able to receive medical treatment soon.And then the chat window flashed.[The God of Love, Odyssey, is admiring Reihausd\u2019s spirit, who overcame the \u2018blessing\u2019.]I raised my eyebrows.\u2018What is he talking about?\u2019Reihausd overcame the blessing?And the chat window continued to flash.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, believes that Reihausd\u2019s old and clogged soul can\u2019t reach you.][The God of Art, Mond, still evaluates that Reihausd\u2019s aesthetic value is not bad for him to be your husband.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, has proposed a vote to ban the blessing of the Odyssey.][The God of Love, Odyssey, rejected Hessed\u2019s initiative, claiming that all Gods have the right to bless.]\u201c\u2026\u201dWatching the Gods\u2019 reactions carefully, I frowned.They\u2026 What are they doing now?Although it\u2019s difficult to express them accurately, they were like fathers choosing their son-in-law.Or it seemed like a conversation between three aunts or three uncles.\u201cExcuse me? What are you talking about?\u201dI was dumbfounded to see the three Gods choosing Reihausd as if they were looking for my husband.Then new windows popped up.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, insists that the Crown Prince before is better than Reihausd.][The God of Art, Mond, appreciates Reihausd\u2019s muscles and chastity.]W-Wait.

With her short hair behind her ears, she spoke in a bright voice with a bright smile.\u201cSaintess, I brought you some tea. Freshly baked cookies are also sweet.\u201dThere was a cute plate with apple tea and cookies.\u201cPhew.\u201dI sighed in relief that it wasn\u2019t Reihausd.Daisy, who had put the trays on the table, stopped and looked at me, then she said,\u201cBy the way, Saintess.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI think you have become more beautiful than when I saw you before. Ah, that\u2019s a stupid thing to say. That can\u2019t be true.\u201d Daisy shook her head as if she felt it was absurd to say it herself. \u201cI apologize. I said something useless\u2026 The Saintess was always this beautiful.\u201dAs she said, people couldn\u2019t become prettier in just 10 minutes.\u201cIt\u2019s a special feeling that anyone who sees Saintess today won\u2019t be able to resist you without loving you.\u201dCould it be that the blessing of the Odyssey has something to do with beauty?Even so, Reihausd\u2019s reaction was too strange.Without responding to her pointless words, I said, pointing to the tea with my eyes.\u201cThanks. Anyway, I\u2019ll eat well.\u201d\u201cThank you. Saintess.\u201dAlthough I didn\u2019t know what she was thankful for, Daisy bowed her head. She seemed very happy to have done this.\u201cI\u2019m going to read a book while drinking tea, so go ahead.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand. Call me anytime if you need anything.\u201d Daisy said a word overflowing with her will and left my room.I sip my tea and start rummaging through the encyclopedia again.Fortunately, the aftermath of Hessed\u2019s blessing remained, and my mind was clear.The cookies she brought were sweet and I gradually focused.***At that time.Reihausd strode into the office with a tired, hot look and sat down on an empty chair.Ariel\u2019s face, who was looking at him with her tense expression, was dazzling.And even his own soul, which has reached its limit like water that boils in an instant.His confidence in his own integrity, which he had never denied, was shattered and scattered.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe boiling heat had subsided a little, but the realization he felt as he crossed the limit remained strong in his mind.When did it start?He didn\u2019t even know himself.She was just a lazy, naive kid playing the role of the fake saintess. From what moment did he have an impure lust for the kid?\u201c\u2026\u201dIn his cloudy gold eyes, Mond\u2019s image was visible. Reihausd\u2019s eyelids, who were gazing at the statue with restrained eyes, fell. His thick, closed eyebrows created a dizzying shade under his eyes.\u201cIs this the ordeal you sent me? Or is it the price of my\u2026 ugly sin?\u201dA harsh voice flowed through them, as if he was confessing.\u201cLead an unclean soul to your spirit\u2026\u201dThere was a deep silence in the empty office where he was alone. Soon he opened his mouth again.\u201cPlease rule the sinful flesh with the blessing of purity.\u201dHis eyelids lifted up, revealing his golden eyes that radiated a stylized light. It was dark and empty, and his eyes were burning like longing.The lips, which had paused for a while, twisted in an immoral yet pitiful way.\u201cOtherwise I\u2026\u201dHis eyes shone brightly in the dark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter that day, I spent a few days bored.While borrowing books from the temple library, taking a walk around the temple to figure out the topography, and making plans to make money on my own.In any case, the notification window about the sacred power no longer appeared, and it was around the time when even a precious offering of 500 franc was dwindling.I took Daisy out into the garden to get some fresh air.It was the road I always walked to go to the temple library, but today I wanted to go in a different direction. The weather was nice too.\u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of interest from my colleagues. How envious everyone is to know that we have a saintess. But I didn\u2019t tell you the slightest thing about the Saintess!\u201dDaisy was chattering while she was following me as I moved and looked around the scenery around me.\u201cEven the middle-class senior priests ask me about your food taste. Obviously knowing the temple rules! Of course, I cut them off. So, I want to tell you that even if there are absurd stories about the Saintess spreading around the temple, it will never come out of my mouth.\u201dDaisy was a trustworthy kid, I think, but she was overly timid. She was so overly concerned about things that didn\u2019t even happen.\u201cYes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault, so don\u2019t think that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I mean\u2026\u201d Daisy blurted out her words. \u201cThe Saintess is a really great person, but I\u2019m upset that people don\u2019t know about it.\u201dI knew how Daisy felt.Along with the Imperial Palace, the existence that stands at the top is the temple, the two major mountain ranges of the Empire.A saintess was a divine and authoritative being, like the religious leader of a religious nation.However, Ariel was unable to attend most official events as it was said that she was sick, and she wasn\u2019t as influential and popular as the former saintesses, so a lot of comments were mentioned in the temple.Even though the High Priest, Reihausd, who established the fake saintess, covered all of them up.\u201cIf it\u2019s a greatness that other people need to know, then it\u2019s not great.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes shook at my words.\u201cSo I don\u2019t care what anyone says.\u201dI continued, looking at her.\u201cThat\u2019s why Daisy, don\u2019t worry about it either.\u201dAt my words, she nodded her head with tears in her eyes.She had only been under my direct subordinate for a week, and she seemed to care about my reputation.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for saying something stupid. Saintess.\u201dI smiled softly at her words and started walking forward again.The temple garden was really spacious and decorated with colorful flowers, and I especially liked the special area I was walking in because it was so quiet that ordinary priests could not enter.It was when I was moving slowly, stepping on the rustling leaves of grass.Suddenly I heard a slightly different sound in my ear.As I turned my gaze to the floor, something rustled once more. It was then that I sensed that there was something in the bush and leaned toward it.\u201cAh, Saintess\u2026\u201dAs I opened the bushes, Daisy let out a short sigh. There, a blue bird was wriggling helplessly. Its wing that seemed to be broken was pitiful.It tried to move, yet its wings were drooping again.\u201cIt\u2019s Blue Wing. It\u2019s a rare bird to see, but it\u2019s too bad.\u201dSeeing the bird that seemed to be out of breath at any moment, I unwittingly stretched out my hands and put the bird on the palm of my hand and stood up.\u201cSaintess. It might be dirty.\u201dI could hear Daisy\u2019s voice, but my eyes were on the bird.I remembered the little macaw I had been raising until I died in my last life.\u2018Have you met another owner and lived well?\u2019The bird on the hand tried to flap its wings again, but it seemed not easy, just wriggling.\u2018Poor thing.\u2019As I was thinking and feeling compassion for the bird, I suddenly began to be enveloped in a cloud of light around my hand.I opened my eyes wide as I felt a gentle warmth in my hands as if I was warming up on a stove.I felt a tickling sensation in my palm. And then I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201c\u2026Saintess!\u201dDaisy\u2019s startled voice was heard.The bird, which had been enveloped in the light above my hand, spread its crouched wings after a moment.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI opened my eyes wide.Obviously, the wings that had been broken before were attached, and the messy feathers were flowing to the point of luster.Its eyes, when the light of life was extinguished, lit up as if they had never done so.Chirp, chirp.The bird looked at me with black eyes and was chirping.Perhaps it was an illusion, as if it was thanking me.I stared blankly at the bird, then raised my palm up further.The bird flapped its wings a couple of times and flew away. The bird flew into the air and flew back to the bushes after two or three laps around me.I looked in the direction the bird had disappeared for a while and then saw my empty hand. The weight of the bird was still vivid.\u2018Maybe the light from my hand\u2026 restore the bird?\u2019Then a window popped up.[Do you want to receive a reward for the achievement of using Sacred Power for the first time?(Yes/No)]I first dimmed the window because I knew I didn\u2019t have to choose right away. Then I turned back at the noise.\u201cOh my gosh! Saintess!\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes were sparkling with her ecstatic look that couldn\u2019t be more excited.\u201cThe one I just saw was holy power, wasn\u2019t it? Hetus! Oh my gosh!\u201dFirst, I nodded my head with a calm face.To be more precise, it was a sacred power, not a holy power, but there is no need to distinguish it that difficult.\u201cReally\u2026 It\u2019s a huge honor. To see the Saintess use her holy power right in front of my eyes!\u201dShe was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s just a bird.\u201dOf course, my calm answer wasn\u2019t as loud as my mind and Daisy.It was really the divine power that was unsealed to me.The power that only the First Saintess had\u2026 being unsealed to me, who possessed a fake saintess\u2019 body.Besides, the immense vitality I felt in my hands was truly astonishing.It felt strange to save a dying bird with no hope.\u201cMany priests heal the sick, but it is difficult to completely heal the sick even by memorizing prayers equivalent to a sheet of paper. Indeed, the Saintess\u2019 holy power is different!\u201dWhat I saw in the book was the same as what Daisy was saying now.One of the main functions of a priest was to treat patients.However, unlike the Saintesss who received the protection of many Gods, the priests each enshrined one God, and the divine powers differed according to the attributes of the Gods or the personal abilities of the priests.Even a priest with good power had to pray for more than five minutes to heal a sick person with a broken leg.\u201cBut without any prayer, how can the Saintess!\u201dIn fact, the holy power is only stronger in range and output than the divine power, but prayer was essential to memorize. This is because it\u2019s a power that can only be used by memorizing prayer and asking for God\u2019s permission.\u201cHey, Daisy.\u201d\u201cIt was a dying bird. Oh my gosh, it\u2019s flying and not here right now. I\u2019m talking about the Blue Wing.\u201dI put my hand on her shoulder to calm the excited Daisy. So, I seemed to know roughly how great the sacred power was.Unlike the divine power or holy power that requires prayer, it is the power of God that is exerted just by thinking about it.Maybe it will be overturned\u00a0 when people find out that I have such power.Sacred power is a special ability that was only expressed in the First Saintess.\u201cYou must never tell anyone what you just saw.\u201d\u201cWhat I just saw\u2026 What I just saw is a secret?\u201dDaisy, who had been so excited as if she was flying like a bird earlier, opened her eyes wide.\u201cYes. Never.\u201dI stared at her with a calm, subdued gaze.My mind was confused, but one thing was clear.I\u2019m not the main character of this novel, and if they knew I could use sacred power, the original story would be completely overturned.I possessed a fake saintess who played the role of a villain, but the reason I was relieved was that I knew the content and ending of the original.However, if this overturned the original story, I would have to carve out my destiny in a world where I really don\u2019t know how it will go.The love of the Gods and excessive overspecs I gained as a fake saintess are good.But that doesn\u2019t mean I want to become a real saintess.Because my goal is to hand over this position to the real female lead and to live a normal and happy life.\u201cI understand. Saintess.\u201dDaisy looked at me with shaky eyes and lowered her head.\u201cIf the Saintess orders it, I will never say it.\u201dAlthough she was a little bubbly, she still had enough patience and ability to enter the Temple of Elium, so she didn\u2019t ask for a reason.After a while I started walking again as if nothing had happened.\u201cDaisy, would you like to visit the rose garden?\u201dShe answered my question.\u201cYes, I heard they planted a new kind of rose this time.\u201dLike nothing had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all wild dogs.\u201cI brought them in for quite a bit of money, which was a pity.\u201dThe man\u2019s lips rattled and a boring tone of voice flowed out.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect them to see the Blue Wing as their prey and throw it at me like that.\u201dIt was a clever bird that was difficult to catch and tame, so each bird cost more than a thousand franc.Reihausd, who was sipping tea until a few more winds blew in, set the teacup down on the table.\u201cThey must be trained not to bite their master.\u201dAt Reihausd\u2019s words, the man twisted his lips slightly.\u201cIs there any training like that?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t done it to dogs, but I\u2019ve done it many times.\u201d He smiled softly.\u201cSo was it successful?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 Was it successful\u2026?\u201dReihausd remembered the face of Annie, who had just died in his hands.\u201cAnyway, they\u2019ll never bite again.\u201dHe put it up to help Ariel well, and he dared to climb it.\u201cI see.\u201dCass nodded his head.He had a rough idea of what the end of the dog the High Priest had trained.Because Cass was one of the people who knew the High Priest best in the country.Cass quickly reached out his hand to the teacup and drank the cold tea at once. Its subtle yet delicate taste lingered in the palate.Reihausd, who was staring at him, opened his mouth after a moment.\u201cThank you for obtaining the White Rotunia. Elium will never forget the contribution of Lloyd Merchant.\u201dWhite Rotunia was a rare white rose.\u201cI was just showing a little sincerity as the owner of Lloyd\u2019s Merchant and a believer.\u201dIt is the Elium Festival, where people from all over the continent flock to the Empire.In return for rescuing White Rotunia, Lloyd will be guaranteed privileges during the Elium Festival. During that period all the tops are waiting to taste the special.\u201cWhite Rotunia is a difficult flower, so you will have to hire a dedicated gardener.\u201dWhite Rotunia, a kind of rose, is a precious flower priced at 500 franc per flower, and it wasn\u2019t suitable for the imperial climate.\u201cWe have already built a greenhouse and hired gardeners.\u201dFrom Reihausd\u2019s words, Cass could tell that he was quite prepared to bring White Rotunia.\u2018The High Priest, which has a more dry feeling than the desert, is suddenly a flower.\u2019Cass was curious, yet he decided not to ask.But at that moment.Suddenly there was a rattling sound and something flew in.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt flew at a high speed in an instant then landed on Cass\u2019 shoulder.Reihausd raised an eyebrow, then slightly raised the tip of his lips.\u201cI heard that the dogs threw it, but it looks quite normal.\u201dCass grabbed the bird\u2019s body with his hands and he stared at the bird in disbelief.His forehead was narrowed.He saw the hound biting its wings and hitting the ground several times, and if it had broken that much, it would never be able to fly again.No, flying wasn\u2019t the problem, it was a life that would have been cut in 10 minutes or so.However, the Blue Wing\u2019s wings showed no signs of injury.There was a suspicion that it was another bird, but there was a clear red dot on the crown. That was the reason Cass chose the bird among the Blue Wings. With a little eye-catching.\u201cIt seems that a high-ranking priest with compassion has healed it with divine powers.\u201dCass licked his lips as he looked at the bird in his hand.A slight energy was felt in Blue Wing\u2019s torso.He stared at the bird for a long time, which would crumble if he gave it any strength, and then let it go.The fluttering Blue Wing slid back down on Cass\u2019 shoulder, as if it was trained.\u201cIt appears that the God of Benevolence is looking down at it.\u201dReihausd smiled as he stared at the Blue Wing that sat on Cass\u2019 shoulder.The bird\u2019s condition, as if it had never been hurt, aroused some curiosity in him as well.The owner of Lloyd\u2019s Merchant, Cass threw it on his own the moment it was completely ruined, yet it was able to restore it to that extent in a matter of seconds.As he recalled some priests with exceptionally strong divine power, his gaze suddenly stopped on the other side of the pavilion.Cass looked at Reihausd, and as he sensed the unusual expression on his face, he turned to his gaze.A blonde woman in a snow-white dress was walking through a field of roses in bloom, with a woman behind her who looked like a priestess.Her soft hair that fell on her chest shimmered like gold, and her pale blue eyes were as fresh as if they contained the sea.Cass furrowed his eyebrows when he met her blue eyes head-on.***So, this situation wasn\u2019t very favorable.It was just that I went out for a walk to forget the stuffiness in the temple, but I ran into Reihausd.He seemed to be having tea with a black haired man as the guest.I stopped when I saw him and tried to turn around pretending not to see him.But Reihausd was a little faster.His voice sounded slow.\u201cDid you go out for a walk, Saintess?\u201dSwallowing a small sigh, I had no choice but to approach them.The two men slowly rose from their seats as I climbed the small marble steps and stopped where they were having tea.They both had shades even though they hadn\u2019t turned their backs on the sun.\u2018It feels like there are two movie stars with good bodies and handsome faces.\u2019I looked up at the tall Reihausd and said in a calm voice.\u201cMay the High Priest be blessed by the Nine Gods. And to the guest who has found Elium.\u201dThen he introduced the young man with black hair next to him and said.\u201cThis is Cass Lloyd, the owner of Lloyd\u2019s Merchant. You can call him Marquis Lloyd.\u201d\u2018Cass Lloyd?\u2019Recognizing him in the original story, I was perplexed on the inside, but spoke calmly on the outside.\u201cI see. Nice to meet you, Marquis Lloyd.\u201dBlack hair like a crow, and dark blue eyes. The elegantly handsome nobleman-like face was exactly what I had imagined after reading .\u201cThe glory of the Nine Gods of Elium to the Saintess.\u201dCass greeted me like a perfect gentleman.However, it was different from reading the original story from the female lead\u2019s point of view. Because I\u2019m Ariel, who is now the villain of the original story and the fake saintess.\u201cI welcome you to Elium.\u201dI greeted him with a faint smile and turned my gaze to Reihausd. Fortunately, his complexion looked better than the last time he entered my room.\u201cDid the Saintess come out to see the rose garden?\u201dAlthough his cheeks still seemed to be redder than usual.\u201cIf you had told me beforehand, I would have escorted you.\u201dI was moved by his words.\u201cHow could I do that to the busy High Priest? I was walking around with Daisy. Then, enjoy your tea time\u2026\u201dNow that I had greeted them, it was the moment I spoke out to get out of here.This is just enough time for me to meet the male leads.\u2018A larger portion should be reserved for the female lead.\u2019But then, a priest suddenly ran to Reihausd and whispered something in his ear.My words were cut off, and after a while he spoke to us with a rather firm expression on his face.\u201cThere is a problem with the construction of the west side building, so I think I will have to visit it for a while. It won\u2019t take long.\u201dFrustrated, I opened my mouth, yet Cass spoke faster.\u201cI understand. I will be chatting with the Saintess, so please go there in the meantime.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI wanted to say that I\u2019d go first, but things didn\u2019t go smoothly.Reihausd\u2019s golden eyes turned to me.\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201dI gave up talking and nodded with an uncomfortable look on my face, and he turned around.Eventually, Reihausd and the priest left the room, then I stared at his back for a long time.I didn\u2019t want to meet him, but after meeting him, I didn\u2019t want to let him go, what kind of situation is that, I wonder.Maybe it\u2019s because there was a more difficult man in front of me. That is a man who is rude just like that before becoming a normal male lead.\u201cI think I have to go back to the temple now.\u201dWhen Reihausd went out of sight, I immediately told Cass.I felt like I had been entrusted with a guest, but he didn\u2019t need to be held any longer. Yet as soon as I finished speaking, suddenly a blue bird flew out of nowhere and landed lightly on my shoulder.And I could tell it was the Blue Wing I had healed earlier.\u201cAh!\u201dAs I recognized the Blue Wing and thought about stroking its torso, Cas opened her mouth.\u201cIs that a bird that you know?\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, I nodded. Strictly speaking, it was a bird I discovered today.Then I heard Cass\u2019 voice.\u201cIt\u2019s a highly trained bird that doesn\u2019t go to anyone who is not its owner. It\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve already become acquainted with it.\u201dAt Cass\u2019 words, I looked at him with puzzled eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, this bird. Is it the Marquis\u2019 bird?\u201dHe replied with a dry expression on his face.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I thought it was almost dead, but by any chance, did the Saintess bring it back to life?\u201dI frowned at that casual tone. Because there was a reflex rejection from his words.\u201cI didn\u2019t save it, but you are saying that you threw away a bird that was almost dying?\u201dUnbeknownst to me, the words of criticism came out of nowhere.The heavy weight of the bird sitting on my shoulder was also the weight of life.As depicted in the novel, he was a highly socialized sociopath.He is a man who judges and measures everything in the world only with capital, and has no interest in the feelings and pain of others. His ability to increase and expand capital is truly an art, but other than that, he seriously lacks emotions\u2026 A cold man.Of course, even that kind of personality changed after meeting the female lead, but that would be a long time later.\u201cI decided it wasn\u2019t useful to have a dying bird anyway.\u201dIt was a look without any remorse.After a moment of silence, I spoke to Cass in a calm voice. If I ever blamed this man anyway, he wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201cIf something like that happened next time, it\u2019d be better for you to kill it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe sight of a bird dying in a mess stood out of sight. The shape of the eyes that lost their light and the wings that were painfully severed.\u201cSince it would have been better for the bird.\u201dAt that moment, if it hadn\u2019t been lucky enough for me to discover it at that moment and use the sacred power, it would have been a bird that stopped breathing.Cass\u2019 eyebrows twitched up and there was silence.Even amidst the tight string of tension, I looked straight into his eyes.\u201cDo you mean with my hands?\u201dIt\u2019s a cruel word to come out of the Saintess\u2019 mouth.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a benevolent decision rather than forcing a painful moment onto it without any dreams or hope to go on?\u201dPerhaps that\u2019s why euthanasia exists in modern times.I spoke in a calm tone and then let the Blue Wing that was resting on my shoulder landed on my wrist.Again, I\u2019m not the type of person who is good at dealing with other people\u2019s injustice.But one of the things that even I couldn\u2019t stand was animal cruelty. And it was unacceptable by my standards to throw a dying bird away like that.\u201cI\u2019m glad that this kid is cured anyway.\u201dI stopped speaking and shook my hands, and the Blue Wing that flew away sat down on Cass\u2019 shoulder.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bird that follows the Marquis?\u201dI could feel the dark eyes looking at me. A subtle curiosity flashed in his eyes and then disappeared.After a while, he smiled deeply.\u201cI think it\u2019s surprising.\u201dIt was deep, but the twist that seemed empty somewhere stimulated a strange sense of anxiety.\u201cI mean the Saintess. You\u2019re completely different from the rumors.\u201dIt was a disrespectful remark to hear during our first meeting, but I answered calmly.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of rumor it is, but I\u2019m curious.\u201dThen I continued.\u201cI\u2019ll go into the temple now, then. I hope you have a great time with the High Priest.\u201dI was angry that he had abandoned the bird in such a way, and regretted a little that I had dropped it too much, but he was a person I would never see again anyway.\u201cSee you soon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnd I said goodbye to him inwardly.No, we\u2019ll never see each other again.Nodding his head slightly, he waved his hand as he put on a sculpturally handsome face and a graceful smile on his lips.***I got back to the temple, locked myself in my room, and put my hand on my forehead.My life was too busy with me doing what was necessary, yet I saved the bird and gave Cass unhelpful advice.The answer is Cass is\u2026 a person whom I can\u2019t get involved with.Of course, I have no regrets about saving a bird with the sacred power given to me, but\u2026\u201cAnyway, I need to get out of the temple as soon as possible.\u201dI muttered, and the window that had been made transparent for a moment appeared clearly in my view again.[Do you want to receive a reward for completing the achievement of using Sacred Power for the first time?(Yes/No)]Without further ado, I chose \u2018Yes\u2019.\u2018A reward is always welcomed.\u2019Then new phrases started popping up.[The oracle experience increases as a reward for completing the mission.][\u2018Oracle LV.2\u2019 is opened.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, has entered your oracle.] [Garden 4/4][\u2589\u2589\u2589 \u2589\u2589\u2589, who couldn\u2019t enter the oracle, becomes angry.][\u2589\u2589\u2589 \u2589\u2589\u2589, who couldn\u2019t enter the oracle, sighs.]The level of the oracle has risen. From level 1 to level 2.And another God has entered the oracle?Another conversation came to mind when I looked at the name for a moment and was stunned with a bewildered face.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, congratulates himself on his position in the oracle and blesses you.]At that moment, I felt a strange feeling of a certain wind-like air being sucked through the pit of my stomach.\u2018If it\u2019s Ciel\u2026\u2019It was obviously the God I was referring to cover up the statue explosion at the Crown Prince\u2019s banquet.I tried to hold the back of the chair with my hand with a sense of hope.\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201dNothing happened, and the moment I released my hand, I suddenly heard a terrifying sound.In front of me, my eyes widened in surprise, and a chair split in half was horribly folded.\u2018This book\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a romance-fantasy reverse harem.\u2019It seems that the genre is constantly changing.I was speechless for a long time with my eyes wide open.***Blessings from the Gods usually last for about 3 hours.However, the function of the blessing wasn\u2019t so perfect. Because I can receive the blessing only once a day.\u2018No matter how much the Gods love me, it\u2019s impossible to bless me more than once a day.\u2019I swung the pen lightly between my fingers, deep in thought.In any case, it is undeniable that the \u2018Blessing\u2019 buff is a wonderful feature.And to summarize the effects of the blessings of the gods, it was as follows.The Blessing of Hessed \u2013 Increased ability to absorb knowledgeThe Blessing of Mond \u2013 The view becomes more detailed and the perspective becomes higher.The Blessing of Odyssey \u2013 ?? (Probably a little prettier)Lastly, the blessing of Ciel, a newcomer to the oracle, was destructive enough to be said to be invincible.The chair was broken so that it could no longer be used, and I roughly explained to Daisy that it had fallen down.And I soon asked her to bring me hard peanut fruits, which were twice as strong as a walnut shell.After she left, I gripped a hard peanut fruit with one hand, then its skin shattered and the juices of its fruit were thickly smeared on my hands.I carefully wiped my palms with a handkerchief, and put my hands neatly on the dress.Fortunately, I didn\u2019t destroy everything immediately upon contact, and it didn\u2019t cause any reaction, especially when I touched my own body.I don\u2019t know because I haven\u2019t used it on other people\u2019s bodies, but it\u2019s definitely a threatening ability.\u201cIn a sense, it\u2019s a great blessing.\u201dThe blessings I\u2019ve received so far are wonderful, but I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s the ability to destroy anything I touch.Doesn\u2019t it really look like a superpower in a movie?Even if I went to buy artworks and a monster appeared in the alley, I would be able to protect myself without Dwayne. Of course, if Ciel gives the blessing in a timely manner.It felt like I\u2019m somehow a munchkin (t/n: here it means like an overpowered one) heroine. And with my exclamation, a shy chat window immediately came to mind.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, blushes with satisfaction at your admiration.]Because he is the God of Destruction, I thought of the God like a muscular man, but surprisingly, he seemed like a God with a lot of shyness.Come to think of it, it seemed like a God had come in waiting for the oracle and inflated his cheeks, but was it Ciel?And then, all of a sudden, other phrases popped up in the chat window.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, enchants Ciel.][The God of Love, Odyssey, spreads bad rumors about Ciel.]\u2026Excuse me?I said as I looked at the chat window with puzzled eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you are jealous?\u201dIf they had heard my former voice, they would have heard my voice just before, but the chat window was silent.\u201cOr is it about territoriality?\u201dHow come the Gods can\u2019t be as good as children?And then I muttered as if I wanted them to listen.\u201cThe blessing of Ciel is great, but the blessings of Hessed, Mond, and Odyssey are also really wonderful.\u201dI once watched carefully the solution to jealous children in \u2018My Little One Has Changed\u2019.Find the strengths of the jealous child, praise them, and let them feel better.\u201cOf course. They have been very, very helpful for me.\u201dStill, it was the moment I thought that it wouldn\u2019t work because they weren\u2019t real kids, but soon after, my eyes went crazy with the letters.[The God of Love, Odyssey, excitedly asks if it\u2019s real.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, wonders who is the most helpful one.][The God of Art, Mond, asserts that there is no God more helpful to you than himself.]Oh my gosh, you Gods!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And thanks to its good use, the general knowledge about this place is now well established in my mind.Even if I ran away at night as it is now, I was past the level of embarrassment because I didn\u2019t know where and who I was.It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to earn money as I could use the sacred power to heal someone whenever I want.It is said that there is a profession called \u2018the healer\u2019 who treats common people at a reasonable price, unlike the priests who require expensive donations when going outside and deals mainly with aristocrats.Of course, it\u2019s not possible to use the holy power, they usually use medicinal herbs or folk remedies.\u2018I think I should find a job this way.\u2019While I was making plans for my career for a while, I was constantly looking through books, but Daisy came in after knocking.\u201cSaintess, there is a guest outside.\u201dAt that, I closed the book, blinking my eyes with a puzzled expression.\u201cA guest?\u201dI couldn\u2019t think of a guest who would personally come to me.Ariel, the owner of this body, had no friends. She also didn\u2019t really get along with her family, so I didn\u2019t think they would come.\u201cYes. His Highness the Crown Prince is waiting for you.\u201dThe next words that came out of Daisy\u2019s mouth opened my eyes wide in surprise.Why is the Crown Prince coming to the temple to see me?Our last meeting was still in sight.It still puts me to shame when I think of Ariel\u2019s proposal letter that she wrote to him.That day, I left without saying goodbye.\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well today, tell him to go back. Cough.\u201dThe growling voice was still vivid in my ears.I coughed on purpose as I couldn\u2019t afford to see him again.Then a low voice was heard outside the door.\u201cThe coughing sound is really annoying.\u201dOh no.A man with blazing red hair stood outside the door that opened immediately.I looked at him, speechless in bewilderment.When did he come and stand outside the door?He knocked on the already open door with his fist.\u201cI have no intention of going back.\u201dI stared blankly at him and stood up.\u201cTo His Highness Crown Prince, the blessings of Nine Gods\u2026\u201d\u201cCome out. I\u2019m here for the story you couldn\u2019t finish.\u201dHe hardened his eyebrows, breaking the formality I was about to set up.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, pats you on the shoulder and encourages you.]Ah, come to think of it, Ciel was the guardian deity of the Crown Prince.I blamed Ciel for the statue that was struck and destroyed by Hessed.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, winks at you.]Thinking to myself that I had done something really stupid, I stuttered out after him.Soon, we went out to the backyard together, and as we were walking side by side on the path to the garden, I could feel the glances of the priests and priestesses.\u2018That\u2019s understandable.\u2019It was strange to see the sudden contact between the Crown Prince and the Saintess.The Crown Prince in the original story I know is not the type of person to spend so much time on the fake saintess who is a villain, and in fact, neither do the other male leads.But after walking to a deserted place, he stopped and turned and looked at me for a long time.[The God of Art, Mond, holds his breath.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, prepares a thunderbolt.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, subdues Hessed with quick movements.][The God of Love, Odyssey, observes the two with pounding eyes.]Those guys\u2026 No, I don\u2019t know why the Gods are making this uproar, but I didn\u2019t want the temple to be struck by lightning just in case, so I decided to try a function for the first time.[Do you want to temporarily disable the <Oracle> feature?(Yes/No)]The phrase that had been made transparent in one corner of my invisible field of vision came to mind clearly.[The God of Art, Mond, urgently raises his hand\u2026]When I thought to click the \u2018Yes\u2019 button, all the flashing windows disappeared.\u201cLast time, I was amazed at how well you acted as the Saintess.\u201dI turned my attention away from the vanished window and focused on Kyle\u2019s words.\u201cYour coughing act is bad.\u201dI was heartbroken, but I remained calm and didn\u2019t respond to him.\u201cStop playing with words and talk to the point.\u201dAfter a while he spoke again.\u201cI\u2019ve got something to warn you about, so I looked for you.\u201dHis low voice rang in my ears.The feeling of intimidation from his tall height and broad shoulders, a handsome face like an actor, and the intense gaze that came out of the shapely red eyes were making all my senses sensitive.\u201cThere is information that the Empress\u2019s younger brother, Alberto Michael, is having an internal communication with a person in the temple.\u201dHis red lips twitched once more.\u201cTo find the weakness of the Saintess. A fatal weakness associated with me.\u201dThe confused public sentiment was stabilized by the appearance of the Saintess.Kyle had been using this to stabilize his position two years ago. That was the reason why Kyle and Reihausd conspired with the \u2018fake saintess\u2019.And the still-tempered Empress seemed to smell something related to Kyle and investigate the Saintess.\u2018Besides, I publicly defended him at the last banquet, so\u2026\u2019I looked into his eyes and asked.\u201cDo you have any information about the informant?\u201d\u201cI have none. What is suspicious is that Alberto is now looking for the informant.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that he\u2019s having an internal communication with the informant?\u201dKyle said, raising his eyebrows.\u201cIt seems that something has happened recently to the informant whom he met secretly. That\u2019s why Alberto Michael is running more rampant these days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for us.\u201dKyle shook his head and spoke.\u201cEven if the informant is gone, they won\u2019t remain silent. They\u2019d rather smell it and run away.\u201d\u201cBesides, the informant might have already given them some information. Do you have any idea?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAs a fake saintess, it was a situation I had to be quite wary of.\u201cIf anything suspicious arises, report it without delay.\u201dI nodded.\u201cI understand.\u201dAnd all of a sudden, I thought of what I wanted to say to Kyle the whole time. Now that he came, I decided to be brave.\u201cActually, there is something I would like to ask for Your Highness.\u201dHe was the Crown Prince of the Empire, and he was a warrior who practiced swordsmanship to the limit at a young age. He also was the legitimate heir of the Empire and would rule the continent by pacifying the Empire\u2019s armed forces. Therefore, this kind of distribution is necessary.\u201cLast time, I prevented the deterioration of your reputation, and we are allies, so I thought it might be okay to ask for something like this.\u201dKyle looked at me with a slightly frown.\u201cIs it another proposal?\u201d\u201cYes? No, it\u2019s not! I will never play such a vicious prank again.\u201d I was startled by the words that came out of his mouth and spit it out at a fast pace.\u201cThere is only one thing I want. It\u2019s my life\u2019s guarantee.\u201dAnd he spoke quickly.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a guarantee of life.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t kill me unless I turn my back against Your Highness.\u201dIn the original story, Kyle was terribly cold to Ariel. And he was also the one who wielded his sword relentlessly at Ariel for the sake of the real saintess.Ariel looked at Kyle\u2019s feet as she died, but he turned behind her without helping her.His eyebrows hardened at my words.\u201cDo you think I will kill you?\u201dThe reaction colder than I expected made me nervous, but I answered calmly.\u201cI just want to get a promise. I,\u201dI had already seen Ariel being killed by the three male leads in the original story, but I couldn\u2019t help but be wary of Kyle\u2019s existence.Besides, I\u2019m a fake saintess built for his political stability.I was his weakness, so if the real thing appeared, I had a good reason to be killed.Although Ariel in the original story didn\u2019t consider the dangers of performing the role of a fake saintess and accepted it.\u201cI\u2019m working hard for the political stability of the Crown Prince and the High Priest, so please give me a guarantee of life, if not my retirement age. For the sake of my enthusiasm in the future.\u201dI looked straight at him and said that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he stood before Kyle and said to him.\u201cI remember you had an appointment with me, but I wonder why you are with the Saintess.\u201dThere was a faint smile on his lips, but I could fully sense the subtle twists hidden in his tone of voice.\u201cWell.\u201dKyle answered with cold eyes.\u201cThere was something I couldn\u2019t tell her at the last banquet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. His Highness and I had a little chat about this and that. It\u2019s about the banquet\u2019s food.\u201dI shrugged my shoulders quickly, hiding the contents of the letter just in case. Because the disgrace is enough for Kyle alone.If Reihausd discovered the contents of that absurd letter\u2026\u201c\u2026 It was a food with a lot to say. The vegetables weren\u2019t fresh.\u201dAt my next words, Kyle stared at me with a subtle gaze, then looked away again without saying a word.\u201cThen now, I\u2026\u201dI was reconsidering the timing to say goodbye right away.\u201cNo matter even if it\u2019s Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dBut for a moment, Reihausd opened his mouth with a chilling voice and cut off my words.\u201cThe Saintess is a person of the temple, so I would like you to refrain from meeting her privately.\u201dI looked at him, startled by his words.I could see Kyle\u2019s complexion becoming even colder.No, Reihausd. As it is now, it seems that he knows Kyle is in a good mood.Somehow I felt restless, and stamped my feet.\u201cI also ask the Saintess.\u201dAs soon as Reihausd finished speaking, Kyle spoke to Reihausd in a displeased voice.\u201cSince when did the High Priest have the authority to oversee the Saintess?\u201dIt is said that in the temple, the Saintess was the superior of the High Priest.\u201cIt\u2019s off topic.\u201dReihausd stared intently at Kyle, then opened his mouth.\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m always prepared for emergencies?\u201dIt was a polite but hostile voice.\u201cDuring the defense of the strange phenomenon that occurred at the banquet for Your Highness\u2019 birthday, some nobles of the Imperial Family were paying attention to the Saintess and the temple.\u201dKyle stood silently at Reihausd\u2019s words, and suddenly he grinned. Then he drew his sword, raised it, and pointed the tip of the sword at Reihausd\u2019s neck.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI opened my eyes wide in surprise at the sudden occurrence.The tip of his sword was close to reaching Reihausd\u2019s neck by a few centimeters.If Kyle, the Sword Master, injected even a sword, he would be able to pierce his neck right away.The two men\u2019s eyes met fiercely in the air.I was startled and trembled at the nerves that suddenly flowed so thickly.\u201cIf you\u2019re prepared, you should have considered this situation as well.\u201dKyle, who pointed his sword at Reihausd and licked his lips in a low voice, looked like a dangerous beast.\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m the type of person that can\u2019t let go of a cheeky human being.\u201dEven though the sharp tip of the sword was within walking distance, Reihausd, who stood calmly without showing any sign of fear, was also amazing.\u201cWhether or not we\u2019re close to each other is not for the High Priest to decide. I have come to give the Saintess a warning about the problems that still exist at the banquet.\u201dHe opened his lips and let out in a calm tone of dryness.\u201cI understand what Your Highness means.\u201dAfter a while, Kyle slowly took his sword and shoved it into his sheath.The sound of a sharp blade going into the scabbard made my spine even more chill.\u2018As expected, the temple isn\u2019t a place for people to live\u2026\u2019All I could think of was that I had to get out of here with Mond\u2019s help.\u201cThe Saintess\u2026\u201dI stood blankly for a moment, then I shuddered at Reihausd\u2019s voice and met his gaze.It was hard to believe that a knife had just touched his neck, and he had a calm expression on his face.\u201cYou must be tired, so go in and rest.\u201dIt\u2019s nice to hear that.There was even a relaxed smile on his lips, who had just almost been stabbed with a knife, as if it had never happened.I barely hid my nervousness and nodded my head.***\u201cAt the banquet, the Saintess came forward and defended His Highness the Crown Prince. She said that the God of Destruction had blessed His Highness.\u201dWhen he heard this from Dwayne, Reihausd couldn\u2019t help but frown.Why on earth would she do such a useless thing?He conspired with Kyle and set up Ariel as a fake saintess, but Ariel\u2019s role was over just by sitting in the empty seat of the saintess.There was no need for her to protect Kyle, or to intervene in the perilous situation associated with him.\u2018Ariel, towards Prince Kyle\u2026\u2019As he reached the thought, his chest fell heavily and he felt an unpleasant pain.The word \u2018love\u2019 on Ariel\u2019s first congratulatory speech to Kyle caught his eye.It felt uncomfortable, and as if he was seething with fire.\u2018Though I had guessed, but still.\u2019Her blue eyes, which were looking at him emotionless yet frighteningly at first glance, were good in front of him.And at some point, his sinful body reacted without any countermeasures. As if a vicious curse had been cast, the fever didn\u2019t subside from that day.\u201cUnless you\u2019re testing me.\u201dReihausd stared at the statue of Mond on the table and closed his eyes.He couldn\u2019t be swayed by an unknown wave of radical emotions.\u201cDoes this mean that she\u2019s a really special existence, I wonder.\u201dAnd just then, Dwayne\u2019s voice was heard from behind him.\u201cHis Highness the Crown Prince has come to visit the Saintess. Those two are together right now.\u201dAt that moment, even though there wasn\u2019t a single wind blown, the statue of Mond collapsed.He could hear the sound of rationality and self-control, which had been protected by prayer, being cut off.A deep light began to flicker in Reihausd\u2019s gold eyes. He quickly got up from his seat and left the room with a cold expression on his face.\u201cWhere is the Saintess?\u201d***Daisy asked me, who was just back, with a smile.\u201cDid you have a good chat with His Highness the Crown Prince?\u201dI shook my head, placed my hand on my forehead and sat down on the chair. I felt a few years older in a short time\u201cAh, I think I\u2019m going to die. Why are those two like that?\u201dAs I sighed, she looked puzzled.\u201cDid anything happen? I thought you would be happy to meet His Highness the Crown Prince. The Saintess likes His Highness the Crown Prince, don\u2019t you?\u201dAt those words, I opened my eyes and asked Daisy.\u201cWhere in the world did you hear that?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 There\u2019s no one in the temple who doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one in the temple who doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWhenever His Highness the Crown Prince comes, the Saintess follows him, sings a song about him, and talks about him wherever you go\u2026\u201dMy head was throbbing. I could imagine how helpless Ariel was.She\u2019d even written a letter to Kyle, so she must have talked a lot about Kyle here and there.And, of course, that story would have reached Reihausd\u2019s ears as well.\u201cAbout how much you love Prince Kyle.\u201dIn an instant, his dark golden eyes came to my mind.He must have known the rumors of me floating around in the temple even back then, didn\u2019t he?Suddenly my mind is disturbed with shame.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Daisy asked me with a worried look.Since a saintess can marry and have children, the Crown Prince would be the most prestigious and worthy partner for the Saintess to marry.\u201cDaisy. Do you know a lot of apprentice bridesmaids?\u201dDaisy looked blankly at my question and then nodded his head.\u201cYes. I\u2019m the 76th representative of the apprentice priestess of Elium.\u201dWith that said, I looked into her eyes and asked her.\u201cThen you can spread the word, can\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course. But what\u2026\u201d\u201cThe rumor that the Saintess is a single person who has no intention of dating or getting married.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes widened at my words.\u201cBut\u2026 If you lose your marriage position!\u201dMost of the past saintesses left the temple and got married when the next saintess showed her holy power.Naturally, their husbands were mostly from high-ranking nobles, and they lived with them until their death.Priests were also allowed to marry, but most of the high-ranking priests were single, as they were given preferential treatment for dedicating more to the Gods.Unmarried saintesses usually had more achievements than married saintesses.But Ariel was by no means a plausible saint, and they were all expecting her to get married. The word that the Saintess likes the Crown Prince has also spread widely.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It can be cut off.\u201dI spoke firmly and Daisy nodded her head with a puzzled expression on her face.\u201cI understand. Saintess.\u201d\u201cPlease spread it as widely as possible. The word about the Saintess being celibate.\u201dAgain, my goal was to save a lot of money here, go out, and make a living.\u201cI never plan on dating or getting married here.\u201dI\u2019m saying that I have no intention of riding the bad route in the original story by swearing at Kyle and clinging to Reihausd.\u201cI understand.\u201dAfter a while, Daisy came out.Then I lay down on the bed.\u2018Ha, I\u2019m tired\u2026\u2019I had a lot of work today, so I fell asleep. Eventually, my eyelids closed and deep darkness came over me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Woman.\u201d\u201cGet up now.\u201dI was in a deep sleep when children\u2019s voices echoed in my ears.\u201cThe server is bombed but you\u2019re sleeping now?\u201dI frowned and went back to sleep. But little hands shook my body, so I finally woke up and had to lift my eyelids.\u201cDamn it. The Gods are running rampant. Those crazy brats are pouring lightning.\u201d\u201cHurry, open your eyes!! If the server crashes like this, are you going to take responsibility?\u201dI must have fallen asleep in my room, yet the space I was lying in had a completely different feeling.\u2018Where am I?\u2019Awakened by surprise, I saw the children who woke me up and the unusual space surrounding me now.It was different from the concept of a spaceship that I knew to be described as a spaceship, yet anyhow it was an ultra-modern space with that kind of feeling.It was so huge and dim that it was hard to distinguish the front. Still, blue light was leaking from here and there, so I could tell what was in front of me.I don\u2019t know if I should call it a bed, which was something that was just a bunch of light, but the bed was floating, and the floor was as deep and black as the universe, yet solid.And\u2026 In front of me were a boy and a girl who looked to be six or seven years old, wearing unique long-sleeved clothes, floating and staring at me.\u201cWho are you guys?\u201dAs soon as I saw them, I knew right away that they weren\u2019t humans.Any superhuman beings and this space wouldn\u2019t be the ordinary space I know.\u201cWe are\u2026\u201dThe boy raised his chin and answered me.\u201cThe administrators of this world. A being separated from the ancient Gods.\u201d\u2018The ancient Gods?\u2019I can\u2019t believe he said administrator, what else does he mean by this?I pulled myself together in an unknown situation.\u201cAnd the scout who brought your wandering soul into this world.\u201d\u201cYou said you brought my soul?\u201d\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s easier to understand the term \u2018system\u2019 in your world. We are the administrators, I\u2019m Ren and this is Van.\u201dSeeing me with a bewildered expression on my face, a girl called Van spoke up first.\u201cLeave the details aside, as the situation is.\u201dShe hurriedly held out a white sheet of paper and said.\u201cIf you give me your autograph first, then I\u2019ll get to the point.\u201dThen Ren hurriedly pulled out the paper from behind.\u201cMine, mine too!\u201dAs I looked at the two of them with bewildered eyes, the two children urged me again.\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have time!\u201d\u201cDo it now!\u201dTo my surprise, I was handed two blank sheets of paper from the children.I read it carefully, but there was nothing written that would appear to be a contract sentence.\u2018Well. Wouldn\u2019t it be okay because it\u2019s blank paper?\u2019I felt a little uncomfortable, but since they\u2019re children and it doesn\u2019t seem like something important, I picked up a pen.Van, who received the autograph that I roughly scribbled out his pen, spoke with a dissatisfied expression on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible handwriting. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen such an insincere autograph.\u201d\u201cWhich is better, a wood frame or a steel frame?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take steel, and you\u2019ll take wood. That way we can tell which is whose.\u201dBut the children chattered among themselves without even listening to me.A light came from Ren\u2019s hand, and a thin line frame appeared from the edge of the paper I signed, then soon the paper was neatly placed in the frame.And the two frames floated up and were attached to the space above.\u2018It\u2019s terrible handwriting\u2026\u2019I\u2019m not sincere\u2026 What are you guys doing?\u2018Besides, that autograph was an autograph?\u2019I thought it was some kind of contract, but it must have been like an autograph from a celebrity.\u2018Then why my autograph?\u2019I stared at the children with puzzled eyes.\u201cHmm.\u201dRen, who was still blushing at that time, coughed once and opened his mouth.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get down to business. No matter how much sacred power you have, you won\u2019t be able to stay here as a spirit for a long time.\u201dWith that said, I stretched out my hand.The slightly translucent, glowing thing certainly didn\u2019t look like flesh.\u201cHm. I was sleeping, and you guys brought my spirit body?\u201dVan nodded at my question.\u201cOur direct encounter with the human spirit body doesn\u2019t fit the theory of balance, but this time, we had no choice but to do it.\u201dAnd Ren continued to speak.\u201cBecause the Gods have so much interest in you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re in a lot of trouble.\u201dI was taken aback by their words, so I folded my arms and furrowed my eyebrows.\u201cIf you guys are really the system, I have a lot of questions to ask. Especially about the \u2018interest of the Gods\u2019.\u201dWhen I woke up, I had a lot of questions in addition to the setting that it was a world in a novel.Why I woke up in the body of a fake saintess, and why the Gods are so obsessed with me.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to go back because I\u2019m already dead, but I still don\u2019t want to possess such a role!\u201cBesides, I want to ask about the interests of the Gods.\u201dOf course, it would help me to live in this world.But it was also important to keep down those children\u2019s spirits if they were to negotiate something.\u201cWhy is it that when the oracle has opened, the alarm rings 24 hours a day? I feel like I\u2019m being watched all day.\u201dIt\u2019s not until 24 hours, but when there\u2019s something special going on with the male leads, the oracle just flashes silently.I exaggerated a bit.When I said with a frown, the children looked startled.\u201cIt\u2019s not because of us. That\u2019s how your soul was born\u2026 You also came from another dimension, and if you were born like that, the Gods also\u2026\u201dRen\u2019s face, which had been refuting himself at best, turned bright red.Van, who had been watching, coughed and said.\u201cRen is a snobbish person who cares about looks, so don\u2019t worry about his reaction. The reason the Gods are obsessed\u2026 We\u2019re not on that stage yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe problem is, they\u2019re going crazy right now, and they\u2019re attacking the system with lightning.\u201dSuddenly, there was\u00a0bang, something exploded, and a small vibration was felt on the floor.\u2026Hessed, is it you?I pretended not to know the familiar vibration and asked with a curious look.\u201cWhy are they so mad?\u201d\u201cPhew. Would you like to look back on what you did?\u201dListening to Van, I looked back at my memories before I went to bed.I talked to Daisy about this and that, and before that, I had met Kyle and Reihausd.\u2018And\u2026\u2019Ah, I remember the contents of the window at that moment.[Do you want to temporarily disable the <Oracle> feature?(Yes/No)]Ah, I remember that I had deactivated the oracle for fear of another lightning strike when I was talking with Kyle.I asked them with puzzled eyes.\u201cPerhaps, are they raging like that because I deactivated it?\u201dVan nodded her head with a tired look..Ren, who had erased the redness from his face, opened his mouth.\u201cDeactivation of the oracle is a natural right of the oracle recipient. Well, no one has used that feature until now, and there must have been no Gods who cared about it.\u201d\u201cIf I disable the oracle, the Gods won\u2019t see me?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s a perfect blind. If you press the disable function, the Gods who have lost interest sometimes leave.\u201dVan continued Ren\u2019s words.\u201cBut instead of leaving, there is one more person standing in line, what is that. Of course, the Gods who have entered the oracle are rioting now.\u201dAnyway, it seemed that these kids were in a lot of trouble because I deactivated the oracle.\u201cThey\u2019re attacking us, the system administrators, because we can\u2019t make it work.\u201dI opened my mouth as I stared at the children.\u201cSo, the main point of you bringing my spirit body and ignoring the theory of balance is for me to reopen the oracle?\u201dVan\u2019s eyes fluttered slightly at my words.\u201c\u2026Yeah. Stop making more troubles and open up the oracle. Everything is messed up.\u201dRen was also looking at me with longing eyes.As they say, this is a system and these two are administrators\u2026After thinking for a moment, I opened my mouth.\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t keep the oracle open?\u201dI was confident in negotiating.I was born as a character in a soap opera and inevitably developed my spirit in order to live as I was born as an illegitimate child of a wealthy family.\u201cUgh.\u201dMy question took Ren\u2019s breath away.Van furrowed her eyebrows.\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re not going to open the oracle?\u201d\u201cTo be precise\u2026\u201dI told the two administrators who were only half my height yet had lived a long time.\u201cI\u2019m asking if you can give me an answer I want in exchange for opening the oracle.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAt my direct words, the two children looked at me in surprise.There was a little bit of embarrassment, and moreover a greater interest in those black pupils.Ren, who stared blankly at me, muttered as if it was strange.\u201cHow can the color of the soul be that way when it is neither pure nor good?\u201dVan stopped Ren\u2019s words and opened her mouth.\u201cHow dare you ask us, the administrators of the system, for a price? You have already received a tremendous blessing from the oracle alone\u2026\u201d\u201cWhether it is a blessing or a curse depends on the person who accepts it, right? And I think the need to open the oracle is more for you than me.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, there was a rumble of thunder, and my vision brightened again.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Van said with a wary look in her eyes.\u201c\u2026What do you want to know?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I sat down at my desk and started to do some of the things I had to do.Has it been about half an hour?As soon as I finished what I had planned, I relaxed my stiff neck a little and opened my mouth.\u201cOracle activation.\u201dThen, as if it had been waiting, a window appeared in front of me.[The deactivation of \u2018Oracle\u2019 is canceled.]And soon after, numerous chat windows began to pop up.[The God of Love, Odyssey, is running barefoot.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, grunts at your indifference with his cheeks puffed.][The God of Art, Mond, begins to reattach your broken portrait.]Ah, I put my hand on my forehead and laughed,\u00a0pft.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, quickly retrieves the lightning he was about to strike.]As expected, the lightning was yours, Hessed.\u2018But why is it not the God of Lightning and instead the God of Knowledge?\u2019I tilted my head at the sudden question that came to mind.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, seems to have a lot to say to you.]At that moment, Hessed spoke to me.\u201cPlease put your blessing down.\u201d I said to Hessed without hesitation.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, shakes his head as if it\u2019s impossible.]However, Ciel intervened.There seemed to be sulky Gods.Still, now that I saw that they didn\u2019t leave the oracle, should I say thank you? Should I say it\u2019s boring?\u201cAt that time, there was a situation. Sometimes I also need to protect my privacy.\u201d[The God of Love, Odyssey, wonders what \u2018privacy\u2019 is.]\u201cSo\u2026 I mean, I\u2019m ashamed.\u201d I said with a small sigh.Then the chat window became a fuss.[The God of Love, Odyssey wonders what you\u2019re ashamed of.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, blushes as he looks elsewhere with a sulky look on his face.][The God of Art, Mond, is making goods with your shy expression.]\u2026As expected, I can\u2019t adapt to the Gods\u2019 overreaction.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, nods as you\u2019re still at that age.]Fortunately, the Gods seemed willing to understand. Well, if they didn\u2019t, they would have gone out of the oracle.Ehm, I coughed and continued.\u201cWhen I wash my body or go to the bathroom\u2026 Anyway, I will deactivate the oracle when I need it.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, stands up against your words.][The God of Art, Mond, argues that he has never seen you naked.]\u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep it active on a regular basis, so don\u2019t be violent if the oracle is suddenly deactivated.\u201dIt was a little disrespectful in my words to God, but I spoke strongly.This was also Ren and Van\u2019s wish.\u201cEspecially Hessed. If you continue to abuse using lightning, the oracle will remain closed.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, nods his head with resentful eyes.]No matter how almighty they were, I was in control of this relationship.I was nervous that the future would become unstable if the Gods lost interest and my abilities were exhausted, but these rules were necessary for a long-term win-win.[The God of Love, Odyssey, is dissatisfied with your words.]These human addicts didn\u2019t take it easy, though.I closed my mouth for a moment, then looked at the chat window and smiled.\u201cInstead, I have prepared something for you today.\u201dIn human relationships\u2026 Well, to be precise, it\u2019s not a relationship, but anyway, relationships need carrots. Even if it\u2019s very trivial.I pulled something out of the pocket on the bedside table.No one will refuse a handmade gift just because they can\u2019t spit on a smiling face. Especially if they are beings who have a favor for me.And if the oracle was temporarily closed for me to make a bracelet, it would be easier for them to relieve their anger.\u201cIt\u2019s a small sincerity, but I made it for you.\u201dI said with four bracelets on the palm of my hand.\u201cIt took me all day because I\u2019m so clumsy.\u201dIt was bracelets that I worked hard on for about two hours.It would have been nice to have Mond\u2019s blessing, but since it was my pure skill, the bracelet itself was clunky. Still, the names of the Gods and the shape of a heart carved with great care were drawn on the bracelet.\u201cThank you, as always.\u201dThe chat window was quiet and I felt a little uneasy.\u2018Even if it\u2019s handmade, it\u2019s too simple, isn\u2019t it.\u2019I scratched my head.That moment. Many colors of lights began to surround the bracelets on my hand.From bright white light to yellow light, orange light to blue light.Surrounded by shades of light, they disappeared as if they had never existed, and a chat window began to twinkle in front of my eyes.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, looks at the bracelet carefully and sheds tears of emotion.][The God of Love, Odyssey, puts on the bracelet and turns it around.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, puts on the bracelet and blushes.][The God of Art, Mond, places infinite value on bracelets.]It was like the usual reaction when a daughter who was sent to the kindergarten for the first time made a gift for her mother.I was looking at the chat window with an awkward feeling after the kindergarten\u2019s school play.[The God of Art, Mond, pretends that his bracelet is more sophisticated than Hessed\u2019s.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, attacks Mond, saying he has an ignorant eye.][The God of Love, Odyssey, pretends to stop them as they grab each other\u2019s collar.]It\u2019s almost impossible to know who\u2019s watching who.Anyway, it was clear that my little gift worked.\u2018I succeeded in appeasing the gods\u2026\u2019I remembered a conversation I had with Van and Ren.So what happened was\u2026***\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201dI glared annoyingly at what Van said.\u201cYou said you\u2019d tell me!\u201d\u201cAs the system administrator, there are things I can tell you and things I can\u2019t tell you, and that\u2019s something I can\u2019t say.\u201dVan insisted that she couldn\u2019t tell me why I possessed Ariel.But I\u2019ve only asked the simplest and most essential question.\u2018Why the hell can\u2019t she tell me?\u2019Ren looked at me, who had an angry expression on my face.\u201cYou guys brought me here!\u201dI screamed and stomped my feet.\u201cWe are scouts, but we didn\u2019t choose you out of our will.\u201dBut, as if it was impossible, Van turned her head to the other side and replied sharply. I probably won\u2019t get an answer no matter how much I ask.\u201cThen tell me if I\u2019m really in [The Return of Saintess Camilla].\u201d I took a deep breath and asked.If I don\u2019t know why I possessed this body, I should first know if the fact of possession was true.Van then narrowed his eyebrows at my question.\u201c[The Return of Saint Camilla]?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a novel I read before possessing this body. It is a romance-fantasy novel in which Camila, who has become the saintess, falls in love with three male leads in the Temple of Elium in the Illide Empire, and Ariel is the villain who hates Camilla. In the end, I end up with a bad end\u2026\u201dVan and Ren\u2019s faces hardened at my words.\u201cWas there anything about the Demon Realm?\u201d\u201cNo, that thing was almost nonexistent.\u201dI answered her by tilting my head.I remembered the content of [The Return of Saintess Camilla].Although it was about a saintess, the Demon Realm or Demon King hardly appeared, and the main content was about romance.Ren whispered impatiently to Van.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it must be true, the prophecy.\u201d\u201cThis. What kind of coincidence is this?\u201dI didn\u2019t understand what Van and Ren were saying, so I asked them.\u201cWhat do you mean? Prophecy?\u201dVan rubbed her forehead as if her head was aching.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the details. But\u2026\u201d Van spoke with a little sigh. \u201cWhat you read is probably some kind of prophecy that has crossed over from this side.\u201dMy heart started pounding at the unexpected words.\u201cIf there had been no mention of the Demon Realm, it would have been half of the book of prophecies.\u201dIf so, it would be right to say that I didn\u2019t simply possess a book, instead I read the prophetic books that flowed into the world I originally lived in, died, and entered the body of this villain.\u201cIf it\u2019s a prophecy\u2026 You mean I\u2019m going to die like Ariel in the end?\u201dWhat was more important than anything else was whether or not my life was spared. Usually, prophecies are meant to be fulfilled in the future.\u201cIf you were Ariel, you would live according to the prophecy, but as you, a soul from another world, awaken in her body, your destiny is changing. And the prophecy isn\u2019t the fixed future you\u2019re concerned about\u2026 Well.\u201dVan had a complex expression on his face, and Ren\u2019s expression darkened.\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s someone\u2019s wish. Someone who has the power of prophecy.\u201d\u201cWhat? Who in the world is that?\u201d\u201cSorry. I can\u2019t tell you any more.\u201dVan stopped me.Ren said to me with warm eyes.\u201cBut the important thing is that the prophecies have already been distorted, and now you\u2019re in her place\u2026\u201d\u201cRen, shh. Giving more information could have a negative impact on Ariel\u2019s future.\u201d Van cut off Ren\u2019s words sternly. Then she said to me.\u201cWe\u2019ve answered it all. It\u2019s time to go back.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dThen it was over.When I opened my eyes, I couldn\u2019t see them anymore.When I returned, I was relieved that at least one fact could be confirmed, although my mind was confirmed. It means that I\u2019m changing the future of Ariel I read in the original with my efforts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My pocket was full and it felt reassuring.Dwayne looked at me, who seemed to be in a good mood.The auction that I participated in today was an auction hosted by Count Rosento, and as it turned out, the Count\u2019s son, who was a troublemaker, was pressured to offer some of the artworks he had collected for a long time.It smelled like there\u2019d be more to eat than a charity auction.\u201cMade by the great artist Duke Raymond 300 years ago, this historic candlestick wasn\u2019t a mere candlestick, but rather an ornament, and there are records that it was used to exorcise Princess Yurias, who was being attacked by the devil. This valuable work of art\u2026\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, points to the candlestick made of lead.]I immediately prepared my mind.The auction has started.\u201c100 franc!\u201d\u201c200 franc!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything more than 200 franc? 200, 200, 200 franc sold!\u201dDressed up as a lady of a rural aristocrat with a lot of money and nothing to do, I won several bids.It was said that they had been collecting items since the time of Count Rosento\u2019s grandfather, but they seemed to have provided items that could be disposed of on their own.A garnet necklace, a Mond\u2019s statue, a portrait of the 54th Saintess, and a candlestick made of lead\u2026Among them, the design of the garnet necklace was good enough to be used now despite its age.As I got up with my things in my arms, Dwayne came and helped me.\u201cAre you planning to sell it to the merchant again today?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re short of salary\u2026\u201dThe 1,000 franc I received as a monthly salary couldn\u2019t be short of the one-year living expenses for a commoner family. I\u2019m not the stupid Ariel who paid Annie 650 franc.\u201cThere is a deep meaning that only God knows.\u201dI said to Dwayne with a cool smile. It was a signal that he didn\u2019t need to know more.Dwayne, who was quick-witted, hurriedly lowered his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI quickly moved out of the Count\u2019s mansion. Then, on a regular carriage without the temple mark, I headed to the downtown area where Lloyd\u2019s Merchant was located.It was fun to sit in the carriage and watch the lively life of the people. Someday, when I leave the temple, I was thinking of living a life that is truly life-like. It\u2019s a life where I feel really ordinary and small happiness.After a while, the carriage stopped in an alley near the top, and I got off the wagon and headed towards the merchant building with Dwayne.I went up the stairs I had climbed last time to sell the product and found an appraiser. However, I could see that someone had come before me, and they were having a bit of a fight.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a valuable item, it\u2019s difficult to exchange it with Kronia. I\u2019d rather use money\u2026\u201d\u201cI know for sure that Lloyd\u2019s Merchant has it. The Royalty said they need it, but if you keep on going with this kind of way and after that you get embedded as an object of hatred, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cKronia is an illegal object. Lloyd\u2019s Merchant doesn\u2019t deal with illegality.\u201d\u201cI have to meet the merchant\u2019s owner.\u201dShe was a woman in a black robe, and in her hand, a precious necklace was held.With the Mond\u2019s Blessing buff, in my opinion, it was a platinum necklace that seemed enough to exceed 1,000 franc.By the way\u2026 Kronia?I think I saw it in a book, but I can\u2019t remember it.\u201cThe merchant\u2019s owner is busy. In order to meet him, you have to make a formal inquiry first.\u201d\u201cWhere do you think I\u2019m from! Ha, really. You will regret it later!\u201d\u201cWhere are you from?\u201dAt the question of the relentless appraiser, the woman got angry several times, then turned around and cursed.\u201c\u2026won\u2019t leave Lloyd alone.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand the first word as it was scrambled, but I recognized the woman\u2019s face as she turned.The last time I went to the Imperial Palace to give a congratulatory speech, she was the head maid who was close to Empress Rose.It wasn\u2019t a noticeable face, but it was the woman I remember because she resembled my aunt from my past life.\u201cIf it was Kronia, it would be drugs.\u201d Dwayne muttered after she had left.It was then that I remembered the word \u2018kronia\u2019 I saw in the book.Kronia was a kind of medicinal herb and a substance with strong narcotic properties.It\u2019s also used as a pain reliever, but because it\u2019s often misused as a drug, it couldn\u2019t be handled anywhere other than the temple, and it was a special item that was listed and managed at the temple.One of its characteristics is that it makes the pulse unstable, creates tachycardia, or makes it impossible to catch a pulse like a dead person.\u2018But why did the Empress\u2019 head maid\u2026\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t know which noble\u2019s wife she is, but that family is terrible.\u201dDwayne shrugged his shoulders and clicked his tongue. It seemed that he didn\u2019t know that she was the Empress\u2019 head maid.I was confused in my head for a while, but anyway, I came to sell, so I approached the appraiser.Dwayne placed four objects in line in front of the appraiser, just as I was about to open my mouth.\u201cGood job. Ron.\u201dThe door behind me opened and suddenly a man walked out of it.His low voice was heard again.\u201cBecause I hate being involved in family quarrels.\u201dThe tall man with dark black hair and black eyes paused, found me, and moved his eyebrows.\u201d Ah.\u201dThere was no way I couldn\u2019t remember this man. He was a man I knew, and it was clear that he recognized me too.As I hesitated as to what to do, I saw him raise the corners of his lips.\u201cThis.\u201dMy figure was reflected on the surface of his dark blue eyes.Overcoming the urge to turn, I stood up and looked straight at him.\u201cWhat kind of business did the noble Saintess have for her to come to my merchant?\u201dCass Lloyd\u2019s dangerous lows rang in my ears.The appraiser looked up at me in surprise at his words.I knew this was Lloyd\u2019s Merchant, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d run into him like this.Because I didn\u2019t officially visit with the priests and the priestesses and this place, where I only purchase things after being appraised, wasn\u2019t the place for him, the official successor and real owner of Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.It was an embarrassing situation, but I kept a calm face and said to him.\u201cI\u2019m here to sell some junk.\u201dAt my words, he smirked and strode towards me.\u201cDid you talk to the Saintess yourself?\u201dAs he approached me, he turned his gaze to Dwayne.Knowing his face, Dwayne remained silent and stood still. And the dark-skinned appraiser who was sitting at that time said.\u201cYes. One was sold last time. I didn\u2019t expect you to be the Saintess.\u201dAt the appraiser\u2019s words, Cass looked straight at me.I could feel the curiosity in his blue eyes.\u201cI just came out to get some air. They\u2019re useless to me, but they may be necessary for others, so I\u2019m selling them.\u201d I replied in a tone that seemed like nothing was wrong.Cass, who raised the corner of his lips slightly, lifted the necklace with red garnets from among the objects on the appraiser\u2019s desk between his index and middle fingers.A garnet necklace was wrapped around his hand and drooped.\u201cAre these things you had?\u201dAt that, I nodded my head.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThere were a lot of valuables in the world. There was nothing strange about the Saintess having such things.After all, if the objects were collected by the Count\u2019s grandfather, they would be unknown to the world.Plus, it might be more tiring than I could imagine if it was spread that the Saintess was running a business of buying things at auctions and selling them on the merchant.\u201cThese are my things.\u201dHe looked at the garnet of the necklace for a long time with a deep smile at my words, then turned his gaze to me.\u201cThen I would like to buy this personally.\u201dHe seemed to like the garnet necklace.With a relaxed voice, he shifted his gaze from the necklace to my eyes. And I blinked in surprise at his words.\u201c10,000 franc, how about it?\u201dI hope I didn\u2019t mishear him just now.I asked with a surprised look.\u201c10,000 franc?\u201dThat was almost equivalent to my annual salary.\u2018Is this garnet necklace worth that much?\u201910,000 franc is the cost of living for 10 years for a commoner family who isn\u2019t poor.Yet my admiration was cut short by the words of the appraiser, Ron.\u201cIt costs about 600 franc at a reasonable price, isn\u2019t it too much?\u201dThat\u2019s true. Still, if it\u2019s 600 franc, I bought it for 250 franc, so it\u2019s a whopping 350 franc profit.But Cass, standing in front of me with a garnet necklace, opened his mouth again.\u201cYes, 10,000 franc. That is the price of the necklace I\u2019m offering.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is a great opportunity. Come on, sell it.\u201dDwayne\u2019s voice was heard from behind.It must be a really cool thing to sell a necklace for 10,000 franc that I bought for 250 franc. I don\u2019t know, maybe I could leave the temple a little earlier.But even in this apparently lucky situation, I decided to be cautious.In the original story, I didn\u2019t know about the female protagonist, but for Ariel, he was definitely not a symbol of good luck.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dSeeing the hesitant look on my face, Cass furrowed his eyebrows, as if he had predicted that I would definitely sell it.But, having made up my mind, I reached out to him with a calm expression.\u201cI have changed my mind. I\u2019m not going to sell this necklace.\u201dThere was a heavy silence in the space. I could feel the appraiser and Dwayne looking at me without understanding me.But I didn\u2019t care and told the appraiser.\u201cI\u2019m going to sell you those three things except the necklace.\u201dCass, who was looking through things at first, had never even looked at the other objects.In other words, the other objects will be objects with no repercussions.\u201cDo you really not mind? It\u2019s a pity, you hit it so well.\u201d\u201cYes. I won\u2019t sell the necklace.\u201dThe appraiser meticulously assessed the three items, and Cass placed the garnet necklace on my hand.As I felt the heavy sensation in my hands, I felt relaxed.I\u2019m good at smelling. Especially the smell of danger. The senses in my body were warning me not to sell the necklace.\u201cThis statue of Mond is ambiguous to be called a work of art\u2026 I can\u2019t give you a price. So if I buy the candlestick and the portrait, I can give you up to 1200 franc.\u201dIt cost 900 franc to buy four things, so it\u2019s 300 francs today, right?I handed the statue of Mond to Dwayne and looked at Cass while holding the garnet necklace.What are the thoughts floating in the blue eyes that stare at me without shaking?\u201cHaha.\u201dWhatever it is, I won\u2019t get involved with him.\u201810,000 franc or whatever.\u2019Suddenly, Cass took a step closer to me and stood closer.I looked up at him, who was a little taller than me, and he tilted his head slightly and put his lips to my ear.\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201dAs a low voice rang in my ear, I felt chills on my back.\u201cWith that necklace was an opportunity for me to get to know the Saintess.\u201dI stood still with a calm expression on my face.I was about to say goodbye to him by drawing a line, but he spoke again.\u201cI\u2019m talking about the necklace. In fact, it\u2019s a stolen treasure of the Imperial Family.\u201dAnd at the words I heard, my body stiffened. The hand holding the necklace tightened.This is the stolen treasure of the Imperial Family, he said?\u201cIt was a very noble necklace that the deceased Empress Dowager gave to the Empress. It would be better to keep it and not sell it anywhere. Dispose of it so that no traces remain.\u201dMy heart pounded at the dangerous content that contrasted with his languid voice.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for the advice.\u201dHe raised his body slightly leaning towards me. Then he looked at me and said\u201cI\u2019d like to know more about the Saintess. I missed this opportunity.\u201dThe low voice was so small that only I could hear it.\u201cThen, please come back carefully.\u201dCass looked at me with a faint smile.If he had given me 10,000 franc and I had handed over ownership of this necklace, the necklace would have been my weakness.The Saintess who claims to own the Imperial Family\u2019s belongings and sells them to the merchant. It\u2019s a story that others cannot easily imagine.What does it mean to have a weakness for him who had cold blood?To Cass Lloyd, who in some ways has a crueler heart than Kyle or Reihausd.Suddenly, a phrase from the original story came to my mind.[Lloyd doesn\u2019t make a profitable business at a loss.]That\u2019s what he said to Camilla.As I turned around, I felt terrified by his persistent gaze.***\u201cMond. Why did you choose a stolen treasure?\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, protests that it\u2019s not his concern whether the artwork is stolen or not.]Yes, Mond only distinguishes the value of a work of art and doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s stolen or not. In any case, the garnet necklace was much more expensive than the purchase price.\u201cAnd this statue.\u201dI said, pointing to the statue of Mond on the window sill.\u201cI heard it has no value, but you chose it because it\u2019s your statue, right?\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, looks at the distant mountain with a sharp look on his face.]I let out a small sigh.Still, it was good for interior decoration. Unless I remember the fact that I bought it for 100 franc.In any case, should I say that I am fortunate to have raised an income of 300 franc through this auction?The money I had now totaled 1,300 franc. If I use the art auction well in the future, I will be able to earn more money.However, there is one variable\u2026 It was Cass Lloyd\u2019s presence.He tried to exploit my weakness by spending a whopping 10,000 franc today. But if I sell something that could be my weakness, it\u2019s like going into the tiger\u2019s den by myself.There are other merchants, but they don\u2019t have a systematic system like Lloyd\u2019s.It got really confusing.\u201cI just need to distinguish if it\u2019s not stolen or suspicious\u2026\u201d I sighed and muttered.In the capital, regular art auctions were held once a week, and the nobles occasionally held private or charitable auctions.I took part in every auction.However, contrary to what I had imagined, it was difficult to find a valuable piece of art that wasn\u2019t stolen.The dream of becoming rich quickly was vain, and in the last two weeks I had attended three auctions, I earned only 200 franc.Of course, this was a lot of money, but with only 1,500 franc, it would be difficult to find a house, and even if I go out, it would be difficult to live.\u2018It is difficult to find my house here and there.\u2019If I had known this would happen, I would have run away right after receiving 10,000 franc from Cass.\u201cWhew.\u201dIt was when I opened the door to my room after going out and immersed in complicated thoughts.I opened my eyes wide in surprise at the profile of the man who had entered my room before me.His blonde hair was shining in the light coming through the window.Head looking obliquely to the front, there was a shadow in his gold eyes, and his face looked stiff and tired. His hands were moderately placed on the armrests and legs at an angle. The crisp white uniform had some wrinkles.Soon he found me and turned his head.Reihausd slowly got up from his seat and started walking towards me in stride. His strangely cool eyes and tense atmosphere made my heart race.\u201cMay the High Priest be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201dSoon he arrived in front of me, stopped and stretched out his hand to me.His heavy hand rested on my shoulder, and I looked up at him with trembling eyes.\u201cYou seem to be doing interesting things these days.\u201dI had guessed that the Paladin Dwayne would report my daily life to him. And I was prepared that he would mention this at least once.\u201cMay I ask why are you saving money?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s just a hobby. I enjoy collecting and selling various pieces of art rather than saving money.\u201d I quickly recited the prepared answer.A strangely dangerous tone of voice continued at the end of my words.\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t intend to leave the temple?\u201dThe Saintess is leaving the temple.Reihausd said while showing his cold eyes without even thinking of hiding it.The three male leads in the original work are summarized as follows.He\u2019s a Sword Master stronger than anyone else and had a cold heart, but a man who would gradually exert an exclusive desire on Camilla.The Crown Prince, Kyle Alexis.He has the cold eyes of a merchant who judged human values only with capitalist pragmatism, but after meeting Camilla and experiencing confusion in her values, he realized his feelings for her and went straight ahead.Cass Lloyd.A man whose intimacy with Camilla, the Saintess chosen, as a priest of strong faith, developed into a sunshine-like love, and eventually prayed for her true happiness.The High Priest, Reihausd de El.The three men have in common that they will fall in love with Camilla, but if they have one more thing in common, they\u2019re indifferent to Ariel, the fake saintess.As in all novels, there is no male lead who will be genuinely interested in a villain.So I was convinced that as long as I didn\u2019t get stingy or overbearing with them, I would be able to spend my days peacefully outside of their attention.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut now, Reihausd\u2019s eyes were so faint that I could feel his bloodlust, and I was staring at him with a beating heart.\u2026Is it just my imagination that the original story keeps getting twisted?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll put more soldiers on Dwayne.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2026!\u201d\u201cYour body is precious.\u201d He interrupted me.I don\u2019t know what kind of emotion there was inside the dark gold eyes that met my eyes, but the harsh yet profound feeling I felt in those gazes made me goosebump.Knowing that I\u2019m a fake saintess better than anyone, how could he say such a thing?\u201cI can\u2019t tolerate even a single scratch.\u201dSuddenly I remembered the time when I received the blessing of Odyssey.Since then, Reihausd\u2019s reaction was different from before.\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026 it\u2019s to that extent, though\u2026\u201dI added a silly laugh to the end of my words and shook my head.The words of this man who worried about my body more than me were awkward and strange.\u201cBe careful. Ariel.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, he said with a small smile again.\u201cThen take a rest. I\u2019m leaving.\u201dAfter he left, I put my hand on my chest and calmed it down for a while.Reihausd is weird.\u2018It\u2019s definitely weird. He wasn\u2019t that kind of character.\u2019Now, he had become a man overflowing with a very decadent and dangerous feeling in every word.At that moment, a flashing chat window appeared in front of me.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, speaks to the Odyssey.][The God of Love, Odyssey, complains that the validity of the blessing has already expired, and that it\u2019s not his fault.][The God of Art, Mond, recommends collecting Reihausd aesthetically.]I exhaled as I felt so overwhelmed.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, declares that he will buy a stake in Cass Lloyd.]I put my hand on my forehead for a moment in the thoughtless conversation.\u201cExcuse me. I have no intention of dating, you know.\u201dMy goal from the beginning was to escape and become a self-made person.I had no intention of filming a romance with the three men by becoming the female lead or taking her place.Of course, all three of them are incredibly handsome men, but because I knew they weren\u2019t mine.If I rode the bad route as in the original story, I\u2019d die, but I\u2019m so picky that I didn\u2019t want to die twice.As death was such a deep trauma that I can still vividly feel the feeling of a knife in my stomach.However, the Gods didn\u2019t seem to hear me anymore.[The God of Love, Odyssey, shakes Kyle\u2019s stake in his hand.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, shyly supports Odyssey.]I brushed my hair again. Gods. Are you already buying the male lead stocks?***The day went by quickly, and from the afternoon the temple became lively.This is inevitable because tomorrow is the start of the Elium Rose Festival.During the week-long Rose Festival, the flower garden that Elium boasts is open to the public and a night market is held every night.People from the provinces line up to visit the Temple of Elium, and of course, the schedule of the Saintess, the owner of the temple, is full.But am I not a fake saintess!Reihausd excluded me as if it wasn\u2019t mandatory. He used the excuse that the Saintess\u2019 body is weak.So I was making plans to go out for a while.I\u2019ve been continuing to live shaky days ever since I possessed this body, but shouldn\u2019t there be a time to rest?\u201cBless me. Ciel.\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, shyly blesses you.]One of the common clich\u00e9s in romance-fantasy novels is that the female lead goes out to a festive night market and she gets humiliated.As the male lead saves the female lead who has been in trouble, love sprouts and whatever.But I had no intention of showing any gaps.Ciel\u2019s blessing will last about three hours, within which I will return to the temple. Perhaps if someone thinks I\u2019m easy, it\u2019s them who\u2019re going to suffer.Of course, I didn\u2019t intend to become the King of Destruction who destroyed everything I touched.Because I\u2019ve been accustomed to the blessing and learned how to control the blessing of destruction so that I didn\u2019t break anything with my hand.In other words, I can only destroy what I really want to destroy.\u201cDaisy, are you ready?\u201d\u201cIf the High Priest knew, wouldn\u2019t you need to pay respects?\u201dDaisy was a little anxious, yet she couldn\u2019t erase the curiosity from her eyes.Perhaps there are no priestesses who don\u2019t want to go to the night market during the festival.\u201cHe\u2019s probably busy with guests.\u201dI had been told that we would have guests coming from the Imperial Family and key figures from abroad.Maybe they don\u2019t have time to care about the Saintess, who is alone in her room.[The God of Love, Odyssey, asserts that one\u2019s true love is to be found even without opening one\u2019s eyes.]I turned around once in front of the mirror, ignoring the window that suddenly appeared.I borrowed Daisy\u2019s clothes, and since she\u2019s smaller than me, it felt a little tight, but not bad. Here I braided my hair roughly and I looked like an ordinary commoner.\u201cIt\u2019s just plain clothes, but you\u2019re still so beautiful.\u201dDaisy made a fuss and said. I also thought so the moment I looked in the mirror.Anyway, the fun outing began.***It was the eve of the festival\u2019s opening, but the night market was already as crowded as any other downtown.More than a hundred tents and small stores were open in what would have been just a square, and several lanterns were hung along the tent.The sounds of joyful musical instruments and songs were heard, and the fragrant smell of food was carried in the wind, tickling the tip of my nose.Yes, it was the real life I wanted to enjoy.\u201cSaintess, they\u2019re selling glazed sweets over there. Whoa.\u201dThe place I was led to by Daisy\u2019s hand was piled up with transparent candies. The candies were as clear as real glass, which surprised me.\u201cHow much is a bag?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s 1 franc.\u201dI bought two bags of glass cookies, opened one, and gave it as a gift to Daisy.Daisy received the bag of cookies and her eyes twinkled in excitement.\u201cSainteessss.\u201d\u201cEat it. It\u2019s really sweet.\u201dUnlike the crude snacks eaten at the temple, it was a sweet candy with a high sugar content. It melts when you eat half of it, but it\u2019s highly addictive, so I keep getting my hands on it.We wandered around the night market, taking turns eating candies.Of course, as the times were different from the present, there were no disputes at all.One of them was due to the legend of young people that if they met a mate during the Rose Festival in Elium, they would even get married.\u201cDaisy, you\u2019re still following me, aren\u2019t you?\u201dAt my words, Daisy nodded nervously and hurried her steps. There were about three groups of people talking to me as they wanted me to play with them.Two of the groups went cool with my refusal, one didn\u2019t. So that fat, short guy and the skinny, bald guy are following us all the time.\u201cWhat should we do, Saintess?\u201dDaisy\u2019s complexion didn\u2019t look good when she saw the men persistently following us after a few laps already.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s lure them to a secluded place.\u201dDaisy responded with a look of surprise at my words.\u201cThen what if they try to do something bad!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201dI spoke confidently, and Daisy, although still suspicious, followed me.After a while, as we walked to the dim vacant lot where the furniture was piled up to prepare for the festival, the guys who were following us followed even closely.I stopped in the vacant lot and turned around, and I heard the voices of people laughing.\u201cAre you ready to play a little now? Pretty ones?\u201dThe Pole-like Man shrugged with a muffled voice as if the glass cookie he ate earlier was about to rise.Daisy said as she stopped in front of me with a pale face.\u201cTo whom do you dare act insolently?\u201dAt Daisy\u2019s words, the Fatty made a soft, windy sound. If you put on commoners\u2019 clothes and say something like this, of course, it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201cDaisy, wait a minute.\u201dI lowered Daisy\u2019s arm and walked closer to the Pole-like Man.If nice words don\u2019t work, in the end, violence will be the only answer.\u2018Ciel, have mercy on me.\u2019I reached out and slightly adjusted the power of the blessing weakly, then gently pushed his chest.He was, of course, not afraid of a woman\u2019s non-threatening gestures. And\u2026\u201c\u2026!\u201dNaturally, the man fell to the floor.I\u2019ve experimented with wood several times, so he\u2019s probably still breathing.He might have peed a little, though.\u201cHey! Are you okay? What! Hey! Open your eyes!\u201dWhen the Fragile Man collapsed, the Fatty was startled and slapped the Fragile Man on the cheek, eager to wake him up.But the Fragile Man rolled his eyes, passed out, and couldn\u2019t get up.\u201cGasp. What happened! Did the Saintess do it? You are so amazing!\u201d Daisy\u2019s voice came from behind me.I raised my hand again to make the Fatty faint.But at that moment. I heard a voice I had heard somewhere.\u201cYou\u2019re using great techniques. Saintess.\u201d\u2026Oh. Oh God.As I turned around, I saw Cass Lloyd, who shone with his dark blue eyes, watching me with his arms crossed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was bewildered by his appearance, but I tried not to reveal it.\u201cI only pushed him, but he fainted.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t even light sparkling from my hand, so it was up to me to wrap it around.\u201cIt\u2019s really strange.\u201d I said with an awkward smile.Daisy opened her eyes wide and blinked, but then looked at me and nodded her head, opened her mouth.\u201cWhat the hell is this!\u201dAh, it was an unnatural voice that I would rather not have made.There was an awkward atmosphere, and Cass grinned.I slowly lowered my hands.He didn\u2019t notice anything strange, did he?\u201cYou\u2026\u201dAnd it was then.The Fatty, who had been waking the Pole-like Man, got up in an angry voice and pulled something out of his arms.\u201cThis witch-like woman! What have you done to Brother!\u201dSomething in that fleshy hand gleamed in the moonlight.The moment I recognized that it was a sharp blade, my body stiffened and my flow of thought stopped.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dI thought it was late.Will I die like this?As I stood motionless in the shadow of death that came upon me, I felt a rush of wind and heard the sound of something piercing.\u201cUGH. ARGHH!!\u201dI blinked several times in disbelief in the scene in front of me. Something that looked like a dagger was stuck in the Fatty\u2019s wrist.It pierced through the palm of his hand in an instant, and the sword in his fleshy hand fell to the floor. The fallen sword was dripping with red blood.Cass approached me as I was staring at it in surprise. Then he stretched out his long legs and gracefully kicked the Fatty\u2019s belly.\u201cARGHH!!\u201dThe Fatty who had a sword in his hand screamed in pain and fell to the floor.Does that mean that he sharply hit the moving hand with the sword accurately with a dagger?It was surprising, as I had never seen Cass Lloyd directly use force in the original story.\u201cUghh\u2026\u201dThe Fatty trembled like an aspen leaf, then rolled over and grabbed the wrist on the side that was hit by the dagger and hurriedly ran away.Only the bloodstains that were connected, and the distant ridges that were circled around, told us what had happened here.\u201cOh my.\u201dThe blue eyes of Cass, whose emotions I couldn\u2019t easily read, were staring at me.Soon his lips twitched slightly playfully.\u201cI just threw it, and it hit him.\u201dIt was similar to what I said earlier.Looking at it now, it seems like an 8th grade syndrome, right?I looked at him without a word with a blank expression on my face, and I felt ashamed for nothing.He held out his hand to me, who was still without a word.\u201cYou came to the festival with a lot of effort, but it must be a waste of time to deal with garbage.\u201dHe then said with a small smile.\u201cIt\u2019s only a coincidence that we saw each other at the merchant very often and we met like this, but the Saintess gave me a chance to escort you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt just happened that there is no Paladin.\u201dI glanced at his hands and then his face, then opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t do it today. I came out to see the festival with Daisy.\u201dAnd then I heard Daisy\u2019s voice.\u201cI\u2019m alright. Saintess.\u201dHer innocent eyes twinkled in the dark.Cass Lloyd of Lloyd\u2019s Merchant would be the second-generation conglomerate in Korea\u2019s number 1 business company.He often visited the temple and was close with the High Priest, so many of the priests and priestesses knew his face.\u201cI wondered if you\u2019ve changed your mind about His Highness Prince Kyle, but it turns out there is a reason. No wonder you often went out with Sir Dwayne so often and went to see the owner of the merchant?\u201dDaisy came up to me and whispered in a very low voice.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dHowever, it seems that that child had already interpreted the phrase \u2018seeing each other at the merchant very often\u2019 differently.\u201cI\u2019m really fine. Don\u2019t mind me. Have a good time and see you at the temple, Saintess.\u201dGreeting to me with her eyes wide open and an absurd expression, Daisy pulled herself out of this place.\u201c\u2026Excuse me, it\u2019s not fine for me, though?\u201dBut my words just floated through the air.\u201cShe\u2019s a child who is good at reading the room.\u201dI heard Cass\u2019 voice stopping me from trying to catch Daisy, who had already turned around.For reference, since the last time I deactivated the oracle, even the Gods didn\u2019t interfere with my daily affairs and only added words. They seemed to be paying attention to whether I would deactivate it again.In this case, it would be nice if they could use a mini lightning bolt.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201dI asked him with a sulky look.\u201cThe Marquis must be busy, so is it okay to stay here like this?\u201dHe said, leading me by his side.\u201cYes. I\u2019m very relaxed.\u201dWe entered the street of the night market.The crowd was more crowded than before, and the night deepened, creating a proper night market atmosphere.It was awkward to accompany him, but at the sound of cardinal music and buzzing voices, I began to look around eagerly.\u201cWill it be this crowded all week?\u201dHe answered my question.\u201cOn the fifth day, the tents are all demolished and the vendors leave the streets. Only tourists stay.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cFor the merchants of the capital. If such a big night market is held throughout the festival, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy the specials properly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a way of\u2026 win-win.\u201dHe nodded.A horde of noisy children was running in front of me.\u2018Wherever people live, it\u2019s the same.\u2019I moved slightly to the side to make some way for the children.Then he gently wrapped his arms around my shoulder. I could feel his firm chest touching my inner shoulder and a cool body scent.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAs the children escaped and passed by me, my heart raced for nothing.The festive atmosphere with red lanterns illuminating the night made me feel strange.\u201cIt would be dangerous to walk with children like that\u2026\u201dI muttered, deliberately turning my gaze to the other side.\u201cThey\u2019re orphans.\u201dThen I heard his voice.\u201cOrphans?\u201dHis eyes were drenched in darkness as red as the lamps.\u201cThey either join a burglar\u2019s guild and live on pickpockets or, if they\u2019re lucky, serve as an errand man at the merchant. Those kids seem to be the former.\u201dThose young children looked only six or seven years old, at most, around the upper grades of elementary school.Cass said as he looked at me, who was staring with serious eyes in the direction of the children who were disappearing.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in Gods.\u201dThere was a heavy silence between usMore than 99% of the people of the Empire were believers, and the power of theocracy was so strong that if they didn\u2019t believe in God, they wouldn\u2019t be able to enter mainstream society.Perhaps this is Cass\u2019 secret that only he himself knows.\u2018By the way, can he tell me that?\u2019\u201cBecause there are many things that can\u2019t be explained if there are Gods.\u201dHis eyes, looking straight at me, were dark, thick, and suffocating.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI looked away.His words were shocking, but not wrong.After a while I opened my mouth.\u201cThere are Gods.\u201dThe Saintess can\u2019t deny the Gods.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dI thought for a moment and then continued.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Gods are perfect either. Well, they\u2019re trying.\u201dThe Gods of this place I\u2019ve known so far were like that.Imperfect beings, just as imperfect humans are.Books say that the Gods created beings that resembled them, and it really was. I don\u2019t know if they were like aunts or uncles, but they were like human beings.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAt my words, he looked at me with subtle eyes. It\u2019s like I didn\u2019t expect those words to come out of my mouth.Indeed, it was an awkward word to come out of the mouth of the Saintess who had to preach the omnipotence of the Gods.\u201cThe Gods aren\u2019t perfect\u2026\u201d Cass licked his lips.I went on.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s okay to blame the Gods, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to try as hard as you can to change the world you live in? For the Gods are a little lazy.\u201dAt those words, I could feel him looking at me for a moment.It would sound a bit blasphemous for the Saintess to say.After a moment of silence, I added.\u201cAnd I\u2019m quite acquainted with the Gods, so I\u2019ll tell them to pay attention.\u201dIt was said as a joke, but it was also sincere.\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m the Saintess.\u201dWas it a misunderstanding that his glance looked a little shaky?A faint smile crossed Cass\u2019 lips.\u201cI see.\u201dAs we walked along the road, we finally came to the end of the square.Cass stood in front of me, and he opened his mouth first as I was about to say goodbye.\u201cI was also like that the last time.\u201dHe looked somewhat mysterious as he received the light of a red lamp that was softly shining from behind.\u201cI want to know more about the Saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI stared into his eyes without a word. I didn\u2019t know how to respond to the strange atmosphere, so no words came out.He licked his lips again.\u201cIf I see you, in here.\u201dHis hand tapped his chest.\u201cMy curiosity is rising, you know.\u201dI smiled awkwardly and shook my head.\u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary person.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never met an ordinary person who said they were ordinary.\u201dHis voice rang in my ears.I was caught up in the conversation that seemed to somehow get me involved.\u201cI guess this is how you usually work with women.\u201d\u201cDo I look like such a man?\u201dIt\u2019s an impression that you will fall in love with his cat-like thin eyes.I said to end the conversation.\u201cI\u2019m going to get going. There are many interesting items in the night market, so have a good time.\u201dFortunately, he didn\u2019t stop me from turning around. Instead, I heard his voice behind me.\u201cSee you again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the Empire\u2019s commerce revived\u2026 To be honest, wealth and money are more recognized than titles.\u201d\u201cDaisy.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe moment she was done, I warned Daisy with cool eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m dating someone. But what is your role as the aid priestess?\u201dDaisy\u2019s shoulders flinched and she stopped her hand.\u201cTo support and assist the Saintess\u2026\u201dI said as I brushed off the feathered collar.\u201cYesterday you didn\u2019t fulfill your role. No matter how good your intentions were.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes fluttered at my words.\u201cSaintess.\u201dShe was a smart and good child, but sometimes I needed to draw a clear line. This was the case with all human-to-human relationships.\u201cThat\u2019s why I was disappointed in you yesterday. I\u2019m not even that friendly with him, yet you entrusted me to him.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad relationship, but I said firmly, in case Daisy was thinking in vain.At my words, she opened her eyes wide and bowed her head to beg for forgiveness.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Saintess. I misunderstood. In the future, I won\u2019t leave my seat by making arbitrary judgments. I will never let you down again.\u201dDaisy\u2019s hand twitched.\u201cBy any chance, it\u2019s not that he harmed the Saintess or\u2026 something happened, right?\u201dI got up from my seat and reached out to the depressed child.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that, but now keep this promise in mind.\u201dI beckoned to the child who raised her head.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. It\u2019s almost time.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes lit up again as if they looked normal when I looked at them again.\u201cYes, Saintess. I understand.\u201dAs I walked down the long hallway, the passing priestesses and priests hurriedly bowed their heads to me.\u201cMay you be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201d\u201cMay the Saintess be blessed.\u201dMy steps passed through the grand main building and headed to the balcony of the tower connected to the festival grounds. Daisy stretched out the hem of my long dragging dress.The door to the balcony was guarded by dozens of Paladins in silver armor who bowed their heads when I arrived and opened the door.The bright sunlight poured down on me, and I went straight ahead without hesitation.Looking down, there was a huge crowd of thousands of people looking beyond, roses in full bloom, and three men waiting on the balcony.Reihausd\u2019s hair was as beautiful as gold silk in the sunlight, and so was his golden eyes towards the people of the Empire.He was wearing an embroidered robe that was more colorful than his usual white uniform, and the black he had always worn around his waist was invisible.Kyle was staring at me with red hair and red eyes shining brightly.The dark navy blue uniform giving off a military-like atmosphere created an atmosphere of moderation, but even the eerie and sharp energy of the Sword Master wasn\u2019t hidden.Cass looked at me with blue eyes, whose inside I was unsure of, dressed as neat and free-spirited as any other noble child.The faint smile on his lips reminded me of yesterday.I stood here without hesitation, but it was a strange feeling.There was no place for me, no, Ariel. Not me, but Camilla, the real saintess\u2026[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, blesses those who love knowledge.][The God of Love, Odyssey, blesses those who know how to show love.][The God of Art, Mond, blesses those who love art.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, hesitates and blushes.]Seeing how proud I am, it seems like the right place for me to be.Anyway, with the shouts and cheers of many, I went out to the edge of the balcony.Then, as seen in the illustration in the book, I put my hands together and looked up at the sky.[The God of Art, Mond, points out that the angle of your head needs to be tilted a little further back to achieve a beautiful golden angle.]\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me that kind of advice\u2026\u201dI murmured, and the cries of the people of the Empire grew louder, perhaps as if it was a prayer.\u201cSaintess!\u201d\u201cThe blessing of the Nine Gods!\u201dThe wind blew and rustled the hem of my red dress.Suddenly, I remembered what I had said to Cass.The Gods aren\u2019t so omnipotent. However, when I see blessings given to those who believe in the Gods, they clearly have an interest in humans.It\u2019s up to human beings how the blessings are expressed. Sadly.Having finished the prayer pose, I turned away from the balcony.All three men were staring at me.Reihausd\u2019s face seemed to have turned a little red from the heat, Kyle was more impressed than before, and Cass was smiling secretly.I glanced at them indifferently and backed away.The deafening roar of shouts still continued.Soon after, Reihausd announced the opening of the festival, and Kyle had a brief congratulatory speech on behalf of the Emperor.I stood still and waited until it was over, and I got out of the balcony when their interest in me had slowly faded.I kept pulling out my schedule because I was sick, but it would look strange if I stood all the time.\u201cDaisy.\u201d\u201cYes, Saintess.\u201d\u201cBring me some tea. But now that I\u2019m out, I need to get some air.\u201dSitting on a table chair in the airy terrace close to the backyard, I commanded Daisy.It felt good when the roses bloomed.After all, it\u2019s a place where only people from the temple can enter, so there will be no problem if anyone sees me.Daisy went to pick up the tea and I leaned back against the backrest, admiring the little yard.But were there originally so many white roses in bloom?The flower bed was full of roses I had never seen before, and I got up and went to the yard.The hem of the red dress was drawn to the grass, yet I didn\u2019t care. \u2018Cause it\u2019s mine anywayWhen I reached the rose bed, I leaned forward a little and looked at the rose.It wasn\u2019t just white, it was a subtle white rose mixed with pale pink and purple. The flower buds in the shape of a lily, but shy and pitiful, were very beautiful.As I reached for it, I heard a familiar voice.\u201cWhite Rotunia.\u201dWhen I turned my gaze, Reihausd was standing there.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful flower.\u201dI looked at it in amazement and said.\u201cAre you done already?\u201dHe nodded. Then he came over to me and reached for the flower.The sound of flower stems breaking was heard.He handed me a single White Rotunia that he had broken.I looked into his gold eyes with an awkward expression and accepted the flower. The flower had a strong, pleasant scent.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, but picking flowers is a bit too much.\u201dI made a sorrowful expression as much as possible.Hearing my words, a cool smile formed on his lips for a moment.\u201cIt was the same day I went to pick you up. You told me not to pluck the flowers.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t know about it, but I was listening quietly.And his red lips towards me were sweet again.\u201cBut I\u2026 The only way to get it is to break it. That\u2019s how it is.\u201dHis eyes seemed to have gotten darker.A strange wind blew between us. The stems of the still moist flower somehow felt cool.\u201cBut if you pluck a flower\u2026 Its scent fades quickly.\u201d I said, while looking at the White Rotunia showing off its beautiful figure.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a heartless thing. It\u2019s tough to die and twist quickly.\u201d Reihausd answered with a bitter smile.The wind blew again.It was a fragrant wind mixed with the scent of many flowers.He said as he stared at the rustling flowers.\u201cAs Ariel once said. You wanted to see White Rotunia.\u201d\u201cRotunia for Ariel will bloom all year round in the backyard. When the cold wind starts to blow, we will move it to the greenhouse, so you can see it even in winter.\u201dI looked at Reihausd with a bewildered expression.Surely this doesn\u2019t mean you planted this flower for me, right?\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dAnyway, Ariel seemed to really like this pretty flower.\u201cIf Ariel stayed here all your life, I wouldn\u2019t be picking flowers.\u201dAt his next words, I looked at him with bewildered eyes.He was staring at the roses that fluttered in the air with a cool smile on his lips.\u201cBut if Ariel were to go somewhere, I would have to pick up these flowers one by one and go find you.\u201d\u201cSir Reihausd. I, you don\u2019t have to.\u201dI would be lucky enough to open a store in a two-storey building, but as I remembered the High Priest standing in front of me holding a bunch of Rotunia, I waved my hand .\u201cThe news has arrived.\u201dAnd then I licked my lower lip.\u201cYes?\u201dA moment of silence lingered between us.His golden eyes were swaying even deeper.\u201cIt is said that in the Thiago district, a girl who can manifest holy power has appeared.\u201dHis words took my breath awayA single bent Rotunia in my hand fell to the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking at the map, Thiago and that place were at opposite ends.Somehow it didn\u2019t feel right.Having lost my appetite, I asked Daisy to eat and then opened the shop function.[Holy Relic]Camilla, the original female lead, showed holy power only after she received the \u2018Antonio\u2019s Pendant\u2019 from the God of Eternal, Raid.[Antonio\u2019s Pendant] [1/1][Not available for sale: This item is not supported.]When I turned over the shop, the item was still there.Perhaps the item would be removed from the sales list when Camilla awoke after.Then, who is the girl who has manifested holy power in the Thiago district?\u201cGods, do you know anything about the Saintess of the Thiago district?\u201dI asked the Gods, but they were silent.There were two cases when they didn\u2019t answer my questions.Not even the slightest bit of interest. Or, because of some rules, they shouldn\u2019t answer.\u201cHmm.\u201dAnyway, even if it\u2019s not Camilla, if there\u2019s a girl who has manifested holy power, I will have to vacate my seat and leave the temple sooner than I thought.The White Rotunia that had been broken by Reihausd came to my mind.[It won\u2019t make any difference if that girl comes. Because you\u2019ll be here.]I wondered what was in Reihausd\u2019s head. As he delivered the news, he said that I would continue to be in the temple.\u201cPerhaps, I won\u2019t be imprisoned in a dungeon or something, will I?\u201dI could imagine Reihausd looking at me and smiling happily outside the bars every day while holding a White Rotunia, and somehow my back felt cold.\u201cEy. No way.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, says that your guess is correct.][The God of Art, Mond, tries to shut Hessed\u2019s mouth.][The God of Love, Odyssey, blushes as he talks about the dangerous taste of love.]They were so quiet when I asked questions.Blurring the twinkling window who was making fun of me, I shook my head and erased my thoughts.Still, Reihausd was the High Priest in name, so there is no way.Anyway, it was getting late at night, so I thought it would be better to go to bed.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to sleep well in the noisy atmosphere outside, but I can\u2019t spend two days in the night market soaked in night dew.It was when I slowly reached for the bedding to lie down on the bed.Suddenly, a knock was heard from the window covered by the curtains.\u201cHm? Did I hear it wrong?\u201dBut when I heard the knock again, I got goosebumps.The thought of being on the fourth floor reminded me of a ghost story I heard as a child.I was looking out the window with a lot of tension, when I heard a creaking sound.I was so startled that I was just about to scream, and the curtain opened, revealing a face I had seen before.I looked at him with a puzzled expression and opened my mouth.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dPerhaps because it was dark, his hair and eyes also looked dark.He had taken off his uniform jacket, and he was wearing only a dark red shirt on his solid upper body.His foot, which came in through my window with ease, thumped and hit the floor.He immediately stood up. His red hair that hadn\u2019t been disturbed by the strong wind blowing on the balcony had slightly changed shape and it looked like he had bangs.\u201cHow did you get here\u2026\u201dKyle, who strode toward the surprised me, stood looking at me.I stared at him blankly and blinked.He took one step closer to me with a stiff face. My heart was pounding and there was a sense of tension. Probably because it reminded me of Ariel\u2019s proposal letter.After a moment of silence, he opened his mouth with a confident expression without hesitation.\u201cI\u2019m here to kidnap you.\u201d\u2026Huh?He opened his mouth again to me, who was staring blankly at the sudden words.\u201cYou.\u201dHis low voice reminded me of what happened earlier.\u201cYour eyes are shaking.\u201dWhen I prayed in front of people, I had a lot of thoughts. To be honest, I was also nervous.\u201cLast time, you begged me not to kill you.\u201dHe uttered a harsh voice as if he was quite annoyed and concerned.\u201cThat\u2026 It\u2019s just in case.\u201dBesides, the blessings that the Gods gave to people kept coming up in front of my eyes, so I couldn\u2019t help but tremble as I read them.As I hesitated, Kyle continued.\u201cSo I came to take you.\u201d\u201cYes? I beg your pardon?\u201dSuddenly, I heard someone walking in the hallway outside.He grabbed my wrist, which wasn\u2019t moving as I made a bewildered expression, and pulled me towards him.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI felt my body rise up in an instant, and I was held in his arms in the position of hugging a princess.The sound of footsteps approaching in tension passed my room door and gradually grew farther away.I looked at him in bewilderment, then he started walking through the window he had come in.\u201cW-Wait a minute!\u201dThis is the fourth floor!Unconsciously, I grabbed his neck and hugged him, and the thick scent of musk lingered on the tip of my nose.He put one of his feet on the window sill.\u201cNo way!\u201dIs he crazy?He flew out the window as he hugged me.I could feel the fresh breeze on my skin, and I reflexively crouched close to him.To jump off the fourth floor, how crazy is that.I closed my eyes at the feeling of falling. Soon, the reaction and shock were transmitted to my body.But this shock wasn\u2019t what I had expected.It was just a reaction to the extent that my body shook once.After slowly raising my eyelids in a calming feeling, I saw his silver eyes and the black sky behind them.In the deep silence, for a time that felt far too long, I met his gaze. It was only a few seconds that I realized we had landed safely.I struggled and he put my feet on the ground.\u201cH\u2026 How did you do that?\u201dTo my words, he responded with a calm attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of cake for a Sword Master.\u201dI knew a Sword Master was a monster, but how could he land so easily from the height of four floors?His body seemed to deviate from the laws of physics I knew.\u201cDid you get hurt?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that, but\u2026 It could be a problem if anyone knows that we have gone out like this.\u201dI spoke hurriedly.\u201cI don\u2019t care. If anyone takes this as a problem, I will kill them.\u201dThere was a deep meaning in his firm words. It was probably a reminder of his previous feud with Reihausd.I stood face to face without a word, and he grabbed my wrist as he stared at me. Then he started walking.\u201cFollow me.\u201dHe grew up to be the Crown Prince with an overbearing attitude, and is a man who takes orders for granted.I was dazed, then hurriedly drawn to him, and asked.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201dBut soon after, I had no choice but to keep my mouth shut.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHis voice was cold.\u201cIt\u2019s awkward because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve kidnapped a living person.\u201d\u201cWell. I\u2019ll follow you.\u201dI felt a chill in my spine and followed him into the darkness.About 10 minutes after walking on an unfamiliar road, we came out of the trees and my eyes were opened wide.A vast rose garden was spread out.It was the scenery I had seen from the balcony before, but seeing it up close like this gave me a new feeling.The brightly colored roses of the day were beautiful, but the seductiveness of the roses at night made me speechless for a moment.There may be tens of thousands, or even more. Against the dark night and moon, the buds of roses were covered with clear dew.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like taking a walk when you have a headache.\u201dHis low voice was heard from behind.I turned to him, and his cool red eyes stared at the flower garden.He released my wrist and started walking past me. Not at a fast pace.I walked after him.Unlike the daytime, a cool breeze blew, but it wasn\u2019t cold.\u201cI heard that the real saintess appeared.\u201dI could see the long sword hanging around his waist waving softly to his pace.\u201cYes. I heard so.\u201dI followed him without a word.Not only Reihausd, but also he seemed to have been told the story of Thiago\u2019s girl.I am a fake saintess, so it was natural to believe that a real saintess appeared.As soon as his steps stopped, I looked up at him.His broad shoulders, superior physique, and his back somehow made my chest throb. Maybe it\u2019s because this body belongs to Ariel.\u201cI put it together with Reihausd. Let\u2019s say that your body is too weak to contain holy power, so the Gods have chosen a new saintess.\u201dIt was a story from the original story.The two male leads who had set up a fake saintess tried to do their job moderately and set up the female lead, Camilla, as a new saintess, and Ariel foolishly protested and became angry.But I\u2019m not the stupid Ariel. I wasn\u2019t afraid to leave the temple either.\u201cAlright.\u201d I answered quietly.Then he turned to me.Those dark red eyes were staring at me.\u201cAnd I.\u201dConfused for a moment, I belatedly focused on his voice.When our eyes met again, he licked his lips.\u201cI want to offer you a new seat.\u201dA cool breeze brushed his forehead and ruffled his hair.I stared blankly at him. I could hear the rustling and swaying of the roses.\u201cCome with me to the Imperial Palace.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can you hear me?\u201dKyle, who was sitting at the desk in the office, reviewing the documents, frowned at Sein\u2019s voice.\u201cI heard that the Empress is pregnant, so shouldn\u2019t Your Highness do your duty as an heir?\u201dSein, who has been his friend since childhood, is the son of the Prime Minister, Marquis Nordleton, and these days, he has been nagging Kyle in his ears.\u201cIf you get a son\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to have a younger brother.\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201dKyle stood up from his seat after signing the paperwork with a sour look on his face.\u201cYou\u2019ve refused the courtship of the Duke of Hemingsen, and also the courtship of the Saintess, Your Highness\u2026 Maybe according to popular rumors\u2026?\u201dKyle frowned as if he was offended by Sein, who made an X mark on his chest with his arms.\u201cIt\u2019s not that buggeries don\u2019t have eyes.\u201dSein shouted as he chased after Kyle, who went out.\u201cWhere are you going, Your Highness!\u201dKyle left the stuffy office and headed to the drill hall.A gigantic hall-shaped drill hall made just for the Sword Master. TheEmpress had been arguing that it was a waste of money, but he wasn\u2019t interested in useless warfare.Eventually, he drew his sword from the center of the drill hall, and a chilly wind blew around the sword.The dark energy of the sword was overflowing and wrapped around the sword in the form of a red light.He swung it once, and several scarecrows over there fell off as if they were being cut off by something.\u201c\u2026\u201dKyle put the sword into the scabbard and hardened his face again.A recent event flashed through his mind. To him, who had only walked the perfect path, the embarrassing letter was quite shocking.He knew how men and women copulate, but he couldn\u2019t believe such detailed descriptions, ridiculous postures, and even letters asking how to torment herself.Upon reading the letter, he felt angry and immediately crumpled the letter. For a few days, he was unable to sleep with a strange feeling he had never felt before.And at his birthday banquet.He thought that he should accuse the fake saintess who would come to give a congratulatory speech.Should he just cut off her head?But the moment he saw her, whom he had met again after a few months, Kyle hardened his eyebrows.She was different from the woman he had ever seen.Her eyes were lofty, her figure was dignified, and the way she spoke was quite plausible.He also thought she was pretending to be okay, but he was surprised at her quickness of naming Ciel when the statue exploded.Was she hiding her agility and pretending to be an idiot until now?However, when he brought out the letter, she reacted as stupidly as ever.With her eyes wide open\u2026 Maybe enough to look a little cute.He instinctively furrowed his eyebrows when he thought of \u2018cute\u2019.\u2018What am I thinking about that Ariel?\u2019When he moved his eyebrows again, a knight came with a letter to Kyle.It was a letter from the temple.***\u201cSe\u2026at? If it\u2019s a seat, is it a job position?\u201d I asked him with a puzzled expression.I didn\u2019t just hear it wrong, did I?He looked at me with cold eyes and opened his mouth.\u201cIf you leave the temple anyway, there is nowhere to go.\u201dAnd to that, I replied with an absurd expression.\u201cAre you being considerate in case I\u2019m a wanderer now?\u201dHe stared at me without a word.After a while, I opened my mouth.\u201cI\u2019m preparing myself for how to live after leaving the temple. Your Highness doesn\u2019t have to be so considerate\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the life you\u2019ve always wanted a stable life?\u201dAnd at his sudden words, I stared blankly at him.\u201cI know your background from Reihausd. Even if you go back to your hometown, it seems that things won\u2019t go bright.\u201dEither in my last life or in this life, I\u2019m an unwelcome child out of wedlock.\u201cAs you said, you play the role of a fake saintess for my political stability, so if you come to the Imperial Palace, I\u2019ll treat you so that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201dA low voice rang in my ears.I couldn\u2019t understand him.At this point in time when the Empress had a baby, it was possible to guess that he was feeling a sense of crisis.It may be that he is trying to fill the imperial palace with his people as much as possible for his political stability.But why me?As he said, if the Empress was watching me, I could be his weakness.\u201cYou told me directly that the Empress was paying attention to me.\u201dHe twisted the corners of his lips coolly at my words.The sudden change in his eyes made me feel the tension rising.\u201cI was trying to persuade you without fear.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHis voice echoed in my slightly tensed ears.\u201cThe fact that the Empress pays attention to you means that when you leave the temple, there\u2019s a chance that you will disappear without even a mouse or a bird realizing it.\u201dAs soon as I heard his words, goosebumps came to the back of my neck.This was something I hadn\u2019t thought of.\u201cShe will try to find out my weakness through you.\u201dThere was truth to his words.\u201cBecause no one can openly touch my person. It could also be called a choice for each other.\u201dThe phrase \u2018choice for each other\u2019 felt cool.If I refuse, will Kyle continue to keep the promise of survival I received last time?After a while, I kept his composure and opened my mouth.\u201cGive me time to think.\u201d I said with a calm expression.Going to the Imperial Palace was the first option I wanted to avoid, as well as the risk of getting entangled with Kyle.I wanted to retire from being a saintess and live a quiet life, but I have to be vigilant about getting caught in the Empress\u2019 claws\u2026It was a tragedy.\u201cIt\u2019s because of time.\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s important that I don\u2019t become your weakness, but it\u2019s also an important issue for me.\u201dI thought it would be over when a new saintess appeared and I left the temple, but it seems that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cIt would be good to make a good decision. I don\u2019t want you to be found dead after leaving the temple.\u201dI was skeptical that someone, who was none other than Prince Kyle, offered a job after my retirement, but of course it wasn\u2019t a matter of consideration.Kyle stared at me with his red eyes and opened his mouth.\u201cAnd your safety is also\u2026\u201dThen he turned his head, stiffening his eyebrows.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dAfter he left, I returned to my room with a confused mind and lay down on the bed. Kyle\u2019s words echoed in my mind like hallucinations.\u201cUgh.\u201d[I will come again tomorrow.]What kind of answer should I give?At that moment, the chat window began to flash in my view.[The God of Art, Mond, belittles his intrusion into the house that has no dignity.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, agrees with Mond.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, suddenly bites Mond\u2019s leg.][There is a gang fight.]The Gods were also having a big party in the chat window today.I thought for a moment.Kyle\u2019s words were just assumptions.Besides, I was strong. I couldn\u2019t explain it to Kyle, but there were Gods who struck lightning when I deactivated the oracle\u2026With Ciel\u2019s blessing, I was invincible for at least three hours.\u2018It would be better to refuse him.\u2019If I left the temple, I might be in danger of the Empress, but to be honest, I wasn\u2019t so afraid.What I was really afraid of was the risk of taking a bad route like the original Ariel if I went to the Imperial Palace and got more involved with Kyle.Leaving the temple, but not entering the Imperial Palace.I thought of useful looking relics I saw in <Shop>. Among them, there were things as useful as the Paladins of the temple protecting me.But the problem is that I\u2019m saying no to Kyle, who thinks of me as his \u2018weak point\u2019\u2026My head throbbed as I recalled his bright eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a sharp brown horse.A young man in noble attire was riding on the horse, and even though it was a road crowded with people during the festival, he ran without hesitation.I frowned as I watched the dangerous run.Then, I heard the murmurs of people saying,\u00a0\u201cOoh,\u201d\u00a0And after a while, there was a loud noise as if something was falling apart.The horse ran without stopping and passed in front of my eyes.And I saw people gathering in the place where the horse had passed. I furrowed my eyebrows and focused my attention on it. Screaming voices flowed into my ears.\u201cOh my gosh. I saw the horse hit and trampled on it, but it didn\u2019t stop and passed by.\u201d\u201cIt was Lord Mikhael, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWho else is there other than him? Because his sister is the Empress, there\u2019s nothing in this world that scares him.\u201d\u201cChild. Phew. What should we do? I think his back is completely broken.\u201dI went straight to them with a hardened expression on my face at the word \u2018child\u2019.My heart was beating anxiously.I stopped at the scene of the accident and had no choice but to cover my mouth with both hands.I thought it would be an animal.If any house dog is injured, I can take it in secret and heal it with sacred power. But it was the child who was dying surrounded by murmuring people.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any hope, shouldn\u2019t we tell his parents? Tck, tck.\u201d\u201cWhere are his parents? Just by looking at him, he is a kid from the Burglar\u2019s Guild.\u201dA child of seven or eight years old, dressed in shabby clothes. There were several coins lying around the child.His body was drenched in blood, his legs were protruding bones, and even the area near the vocal cord was injured, so he couldn\u2019t say a word.At that moment, I remembered the faces of the children who had passed by at the night market.A child\u2019s pupil filled only with pain.The moment I saw it, something in my chest jumped violently.\u2018I\u2019m going to save you.\u2019I looked back and shouted loudly.\u201cDwayne. Take a stretcher and take the child to that inn immediately.\u201dIt was too crowded with a lot of people, and I couldn\u2019t concentrate.Dwayne, who had followed me and was unable to speak at the horrific sight in front of him, hesitated.He decided that no matter what he did, a child in such a state couldn\u2019t be saved.\u201cIt\u2019s an order!\u201dI shouted at him loudly, and he was dazed then asked the knights to get a stretcher.\u201cHurry! Hurry up!!\u201dHuman life was very tenacious. Just as I was stabbed that day and felt pain until I died.The Paladins came quickly to find a stretcher, and when the child was put on the stretcher, his blood flowed down.\u201cRent me a room, please. I\u2019ll give you ten times the price.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t rent you a room for a dead\u2026\u201d\u201cThis child isn\u2019t dead. I speak in the name of the Saintess of Elium.\u201dEven with my words, the innkeeper hesitated, and I firmly appointed the innkeeper.\u201cQuick!\u201d\u201cI-I understand!\u201dAfter telling them to leave the child, I told Dwayne and his knights to leave.The child\u2019s pupils were gradually becoming cloudy, and the floor was dripping with his blood.His hands and feet were already green, and it was when death gradually began to seek the child. His breathing was irregular, and the child\u2019s eyelids bled and barely moved.I stretched out my hands and laid them on the child\u2019s chest with a strong desire.As soon as I saw the messed up child earlier, I was convinced of that.That I could save him.My palms began to twirl with warmth.Although the child\u2019s appearance itself was disastrous, I didn\u2019t feel disgusted at all. Only infinite sympathy, regret, and willingness to save a dying life filled my mind.The energy that was circling in my hands began to be sucked into the child\u2019s heart.\u2018It\u2019s weak.\u2019But that energy was smaller than the life force that escaped from the child\u2019s body.I was focused even more.Contrary to me practicing controlling the blessing I received from Ciel, I didn\u2019t have any time to practice the sacred power. As I couldn\u2019t find anyone who was injured.Therefore, I didn\u2019t know in what way my sacred power reached the child as a healing power.\u2018The sacred power is the power of the Gods, and my hand is the faucet.\u2019I concentrated my mind on my hands and tried to pour out the sacred power.I could feel the sacred power overflowing and filling my body, but the sacred power delivered to the child through my hands was at the level of dripping water as if the faucet hadn\u2019t been turned all the way.The child\u2019s life was gradually withering away. Like a broken flower.The bowl was clearly different from the little bird I had saved. The look of a miserable child reminded me of the pain of being stabbed by a knife in my past life.I thought I wanted to live.It hurt so much that it would be better to die, but it\u2019s the natural instinct of a person to have even a feeble life attached to it.\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dIt was when my withered, unloved figure when I was young overlapped with the face of the child.At that moment, I felt something piercing out of my hand, and on the contrary, I felt something being absorbed into me.And then, my stomach that had been stabbed by the knife began to ache.I furrowed my eyebrows and bit my lip.I could feel the passage completely open. However, the healing that came from the sacred power wasn\u2019t one-sided.\u201cUgh.\u201dMy stomach hurt as if the child\u2019s pain had been transmitted to me.The feeling of that day when my skin was pierced with a knife coolly climbed up my spine, and the deep fear that approached the moment of death began to occupy my mind. As if it was asking if I was still going to continue.It wasn\u2019t easy for a person to save someone. Nevertheless, I stretched out my palms and concentrated my mind even more.The child\u2019s heart, which had been slowing irregularly, began to burst with vitality again.The shattered bones adhered and the misaligned bones began to come back.My stomach hurt. It hurt so much that I was in a cold sweat.But I didn\u2019t want to put my hands down. With the stern sense of responsibility that a life is at stake under my hands, and the feeling of encouragement to see the child come out of death.\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dIn my past life, I had been both the victim and the perpetrator.It\u2019s not my fault that I was born an illegitimate child, but my presence has shaken the peace of the family horribly.Everyone pointed at me, hated me, and despised me, so I decided to hate them too.I pushed those who tried to trap me into the abyss, and I did more harm to those who tried to harm me.Monster, vicious thing, such words followed me, but I couldn\u2019t help it. That was the only way I could live.The first and last good deed I did was to be stabbed instead of a friend.\u2018And back then I\u2026\u2019Like a hedgehog, I only knew how to hurt, but I was also a human being\u2026 It was the first time I felt it while saving someone and dying.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe sacred power that was pouring out of my hand thinned and stopped.I slowly withdrew my hands.My eyes fluttered, I felt dizzy, and my body was shaking. And the fully healed child was lying down.The light returned to his eyes, which had been staring blankly into the air, and his hand twitched.\u201cHe\u2026 re is\u2026\u201dA small voice came out of the child. He exerted strength with his hands to the ground and raised his upper body. It\u2019s as smooth as if he was just waking up from sleep.Only torn clothes, red blood on the floor, and a blood-soaked stretcher were awkwardly around the child.\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dThe child looked at me with fearful eyes.A parched body. However, only the vitality in the eyes was clear. I was then able to breathe and be relieved.I saved someone with these hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How old are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ten years old.\u201dHe seemed relieved when I said that I didn\u2019t need money.That image pierced my chest again.The child, who seemed to be at most eight, was ten years old. No wonder his words were so clear.\u201cDid the Gods save me?\u201dThe child asked me, his eyes were sparkling.\u201cNo. I saved you.\u201d I just cut it off and answered.The child looked surprised.\u201cThe Gods supported me through the power, but I saved you.\u201dIn fact, I had a little idea why the Gods couldn\u2019t intervene deeply in human affairs.The weak are slaughtered and the strong survive.War brings tragedy, but the number of human beings decreases and it has a positive effect on other lives.Unless the old dies and the child is born, human life can\u2019t prosper.When filming an animal documentary, just as humans don\u2019t intervene in the life and death of animals, the Gods are, after all, beings on the top of balance.But I was different.I was able to use the sacred power and save the undead.\u201cT-Thank you. Miss.\u201d\u201cAre you a member of the Burglar\u2019s Guild?\u201dI asked the child based on what I had heard earlier.He looked at me and nodded his head.After a while, I pulled out my pocket and handed the boy 10 franc.The child opened his eyes wide and looked at me. In modern terms, it was worth hundreds of thousands of won, which is surprising.\u201cYou can buy clothes with this. Buy meals and eat them. From now on, if a crazy bastard on a horse runs up to you, dodge it quickly.\u201d\u201cYes. But this money\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a free gift. From now on, I\u2019ll hire you.\u201dAt my words, the child made a bewildered expression.I didn\u2019t have to give him useless and worthless money just because he was pitiful. But if it\u2019s something that can help each other in the long run, that\u2019s a different story.\u201cI need information from the Burglar\u2019s Guild. You just need to periodically sell the information I need.\u201dI\u2019ve heard of the Burglar\u2019s Guild in the original story.The Burglar\u2019s Guild, where all personal information of the continent, as well as the Empire, comes and goes.If I can get information from there through this child, it won\u2019t be a loss for me either.\u201cI saved you from dying, so if I do this, will you be able to trust me?\u201dThe child nodded his head.Since I have to leave the temple soon anyway, realistic information from the Burglar\u2019s Guild rather than the limited information about the temple will be helpful.It will also be a protection for those who threaten me. In a world without the internet, no one is as fast as the Burglar\u2019s Guild.\u201cIf it\u2019s information, what do you mean?\u201dI decided to try the child\u2019s usefulness first. Is it reliable?\u201cI have a garnet necklace that the deceased Empress Dowager gave to the Empress. The octagonal red jewel is shining brightly inside the pure gold decoration. I want to find the material of that necklace.\u201dThe child nodded his head with a clear look.\u201cI understand. Thank you for saving me.\u201dAlthough he said thank you, it was realistic for him to hold the money tightly.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting at the third pillar on the east side of the ceremonial hall of the Temple of Elium at noon in three days, so bring the relevant information. You\u2019re a member of the Burglar\u2019s Guild, so you can sneak into the temple, right?\u201d\u201cI understand. miss.\u201d\u201cAnd leave from the window, not the door.\u201dI said, pointing to the inn\u2019s window. It won\u2019t be difficult to get to since it\u2019s on the first floor.The child, half dead, but spared by sacred power, bowed his head to me once more, turned around, and went over the window.\u201cHaa\u2026 Anyway, this blood\u2026\u201dSeeing the messed up floor, I let out a small sigh.After a while, the door opened, and Dwayne, who was standing in front of the door, looked around the room in surprise.The floor was covered with blood, and the child\u2019s figure was nowhere to be seen.\u201cWhere is the child\u2019s body?\u201dDwayne thought he was obviously dead and asked me, and I left the room and ordered Dwayne.\u201cHe\u2019s gone. Please clean up the mess. And today\u2026\u201dI was going to order him not to speak, yet I gave up.Everything that Dwayne saw and heard goes to Reihausd, anyway.Well, he didn\u2019t see me healing the child himself, so I guess there won\u2019t be any trouble.***Returning to the temple after a tiring day, I stood in front of the mirror and rolled up my top. It\u2019s fine now, but I remember feeling the intense pain as if it had been cut with a knife.The moment I poured out all my energy, my whole body trembled at the rushing sensation.And after a while, I found a long, half-moon-shaped scar on my navel reflected in the mirror.It looked more like a kind of tattoo on the skin rather than a rough scar. It was the place where I had been stabbed in the past in my life, and it was the place where I had been hurting like crazy.I felt nothing when I touched it with my index finger.I put my coat back on, walked over to the pile of books, and opened the dictionary right away.No way\u2026 This?I found the \u2018stigma\u2019 and read the description.[The stigma is a mark of the holy power that only appears in Saintesses, proving that they were chosen by the Gods\u2026]Reading it made me faint.Wait a minute. I\u2019m a fake saintess, but what if a stigma appears?And then the chat window started blinking.[You have proved your faith by fully opening your sacred power with extreme patience.][Your stigma has appeared. The Gods\u2019 interest and favor with you increases.][\u2018Oracle LV.3\u2019 is opened.]And in the chat window, a sentence came to my mind.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, has entered your oracle.][Garden 5/5][\u2589\u2589\u2589 \u2589\u2589\u2589, who couldn\u2019t enter the oracle, sighs as the ground is gone.][\u2589\u2589\u2589 \u2589\u2589\u2589, who couldn\u2019t enter the oracle, is spreading the mat.]The stigma that suddenly appeared on my stomach and the fact that the oracle level had risen to 3 made me bewildered.In the meantime, the chat window flashed.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, enters the oracle and looks around.][The God of Love, Odyssey, slowly steps back and makes a fuss.][The God of Art, Mond, shakes his head.]I looked at the sentences that came to mind and put on a puzzled expression.Maybe it\u2019s just my feeling, but it wasn\u2019t an atmosphere where other Gods actively welcome Oman.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, pretends not to know and coughs.]Perhaps there is bullying among the Gods.I looked at the chat window with a shaky expression on my face and said.\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re in the oracle, so I hope everyone is getting along well.\u201d[The God of Benevolence, Oman, seems to be moved by your words.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, confesses that he has bought your share.]At first impression, he seemed like a good rookie. Then another sentence came to mind.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, says that in fact, Oman is the most destructive of the Gods\u2026][The God of Benevolence, Oman, stretches out a gentle hand.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, senses danger and reveals his fangs to Oman.]And it was then.The chat window where the sentence appeared suddenly stopped. It was at the moment when I was worried in my mind that I might be being baptized by other Gods.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is temporarily disabled.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, likes your shoes.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, falls asleep temporarily with tears forming around his eyes.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, pats Ciel\u2019s droopy head, saying that he must be tired.]Something must have happened, but I had no idea what it was.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, winks at you, telling you not to worry.]Anyway, the newcomer of the oracle seems to be adapting well, so that should work, right?Again today, after blurring the peaceful oracle room, I touched the stigma through my clothes.Obviously, she was a fake saintess when I possessed this body, but it seems that I have become a real saintess.\u2018There\u2019s no way.\u2019I shook my head, thinking of the girl coming from Thiago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But he was just engrossed again, paying attention to the prayer.As he slowly turned around after a while, he saw Dwayne\u2019s face, kneeling on one of his knees and waiting.Dwayne\u2019s face was stiffer than usual.He asked him with cool eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dReihausd was such a beautiful man that even a man like him would be mesmerized. But when he met his eyes, he felt a strong sensation that made him shiver.Dwayne opened his mouth, still with a very stiff expression on his face.\u201cThere was something I didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m talking about the Saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dReihausd hardened his eyebrows at those words.\u201cIt\u2019s something that can\u2019t be understood.\u201dDwayne\u2019s lips trembled.It was rare for a Paladin with sword expert-level skills to look so pale.Moments later, Dwayne opened his mouth again.\u201cThe Saintess moved a child, who was almost dying after being hit by a horse in the square, to the inn room and closed the door.\u201dReihausd furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cYou mean the dying child?\u201d\u201cBecause there was no hope\u2026 I thought the Saintess would give her prayers for the last time so that her child could leave in peace\u2026\u201dDwayne remembered what had happened.Blood splattered on the floor and the child disappeared from nowhere. And the Saintess\u2019 hands were full of blood.\u201cThe child is gone.\u201dReihausd raised his eyebrows at those words.Dwayne said he didn\u2019t quite understand.\u201cHow on the earth could this happen!\u201dEven thinking about it again, it was so strange.The body disappeared. the whole thing.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe continued looking at Reihausd.\u201cSo I use my reasoning skills to deduce\u2026\u201dDwayne\u2019s face darkened to the point that it couldn\u2019t get any darker.Reihausd stood still and stared at him.Moments later, he opened his mouth.\u201cI think that the Saintess ate that child.\u201dReihausd frowned, but Dwayne continued.\u201cThere\u2019s no other answer than that.\u201dAt Dwayne\u2019s words, Reihausd raised his hand and pressed it against his forehead.\u201cA monster is pretending to be the Saintess, and in fact, the real Saintess is imprisoned or something like that. I\u2019ve been thinking it\u2019s weird since she\u2019s been attending auctions constantly\u2026 Perhaps that is why a new saintess appeared in Thiago.\u201dReihausd\u2019s lips were moving up and down.\u201cThen we have to get the prison key from that monster.\u201d\u201cRight. To save the Saintess\u2026\u201d\u201cI can do much better than that monster.\u201dDwayne looked at the dangerous glare of Reihausd\u2019s eyes with a bewildered expression.After a while, a small sigh escaped his mouth.\u201cSir Dwayne.\u201dDwayne answered right away.\u201cYes. High Priest.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t plan on going to the Salerium in a hurry, you\u2019d be keep your nonsense to yourself.\u201dDwayne\u2019s shoulders stiffened at the harsh, sullen voice.Salerium means the palace of the God of Death.\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that child was on the verge of death?\u201dAt Reihausd\u2019s questionable remarks, Dwayne nodded violently.\u201cThat\u2019s right. His back was broken and his limbs twisted, making him unable to survive. There was one window in the room, but no bloodstains were seen, and no body of a child had fallen below. If someone showed up and took the body, people would have found out.\u201d\u201cIf the child is healed and walks out the window unharmed.\u201d\u201cIt would be possible to disappear like that.\u201dDwayne said nonsense at that low voice.\u201cNo\u2026 no way. That\u2019s nonsense. Even if the Saintess uses divine power, in that short time\u2026\u201dThere is a history that Bergheritta, the first and strongest of the saintesses, completely brought a dying person back to life within an hour.Reihausd\u2019s eyes swayed.The problem is Ariel\u2026 can\u2019t use power. As she\u2019s not the real one.\u201cI\u2019m going to meet Ariel.\u201d***I made the shop feature appear.Since the oracle level was 3, there were still restrictions on items, but I thought that it was better because there were more items to choose from than when it was at a lower level.The money I have right now is exactly 2,000 franc.And at level 3, I was able to buy various relics.[Mond\u2019s Cup \u2013 If you drink from this cup, you will never get drunk. 250 franc.][The God of Art, Mond, recommends \u2018Mond\u2019s Cup\u2019.]I looked at the chat window with suspicious eyes.The reason why you don\u2019t get drunk when you put alcohol in that cup isn\u2019t because Monde drinks it all, right?It was a reasonable inference.[Ciel\u2019s Ring \u2013 When you wear this ring, the dogs show their closeness to you. 180 franc.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is proud of the ring.]What does Ciel have to do with dogs?I tilted my head.[Oman\u2019s Lash \u2013 When you wield this whip and say a special starter, all the opposite sex will obey you. 570 franc.]\u2026There are all sorts of weird stuff. Is this really a relic store?[Sealing Pendant] [Holy Power Wand] [Sacred Relic of Brilliance]There were also relics worth thousands of franc. Wow, expensive.As I was flipping through miscellaneous relics, I found what I needed.[Hessed\u2019s Bracelet \u2013 Wearing this bracelet will protect you. 340 franc.]I don\u2019t know how much it can protect my body, but I bought it without hesitation.After a while, a crude leather bracelet was placed on my hand and I was occupied with it.I might meet that crazy guy who ran at me with a knife the last time I went to the night market again. And, according to Kyle\u2019s assumption, I might face threats after leaving the temple.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is satisfied with your right decision.][The God of Mercy, Oman, strongly protests against the shop.][The price of \u2018Oman\u2019s Lash\u2019 has been adjusted to 300 franc.]But I\u2019m not going to buy that, though?I shook my head with a strict expression.[Your Money: 1,660 franc]It was when I was satisfied with the bracelet I bought at the store after closing the shop.A knock was heard. Soon after, the door opened and the person who appeared was Reihausd.His beautiful blonde hair appeared pale scarlet in the sunset falling outside the window.\u201cAh. May the High Priest be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201dWithout realizing it, I stared blankly at him, then hurriedly greeted him.He had a slight smile on his lips. He was prettier than Ariel in the mirror. Enough to make me dumbfounded sometimes.\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d\u201cI was just looking at the scenery outside.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say I was shopping, so I just looked around.He stared at me for a moment and then opened his mouth again.\u201cIt would be better to enjoy the scenery outside than to see it through the window.\u201dA low, soft voice sweetly drifted into my ears.\u201cLike it\u2019s better to see Ariel like this in person than secretly.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.

It shines like a lantern.\u201dThe scenery I saw during the day was beautiful, but it was a flower that showed its true value at night.Reihausd looked back at me, staring at them for a while with a slightly startled expression, and smiled faintly.\u201cDo you know the legend about White Rotunia?\u201dAt that, I shook my head.\u201cNo.\u201dAfter coming here and receiving the blessing of Hessed, I have read more than 100 books, but I have never heard of that legend.\u201cIt is said that there was a boy living in Alteion in the Kingdom of Privato, and a fairy named Rotunia.\u201dAs he reached out to the shining rose, I was unintentionally nervous.I fear that his hand will mercilessly pick the flower again.\u201cThe boy surely loved the fairy. But the fairy loved a man other than the boy, and the boy made his wish to the Demon King to have her.\u201dFortunately, his hand only lightly brushed the bud of the rose.His soft voice followed.\u201cThe Demon King told him to put a dying bird on a vine and put it on the roadside with thorn sap. The boy did, and the next day there was Rotunia, hanging on the vine.\u201dA cool night wind blew.I focused on his story.\u201cShe was poisoned by the thorn sap that ruined her wings, and lived with the boy. But she never smiled at the boy. Not even once.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe boy went back to the Demon King and asked how he would make Rotunia laugh, and this time, the Demon King told him to put Rotunia\u2019s broken wing feathers on a vine and poison on it. And the next morning, the man she had loved was trapped and poisoned to death.\u201dMy eyebrows twitched at the strange story.\u201cRotunia smiled at the boy for the first and last time with a very lovely expression. She then died when she kissed the venomous lips of the man she loved for the last time.\u201dI, who was listening to the story blankly, asked as I didn\u2019t understand this story.\u201cThe man she loved died because of the boy\u2026 Yet she smiled?\u201dEven if she ran wild blinded by sadness and hatred.\u201cAnd why did she die? She should\u2019ve killed that shameless bastard first.\u201dReihausd turned to me from the White Rotunia.The darkness in his deep gold eyes swayed as he looked at me radiantly.\u201cTo make him remember and miss that smile he so longed for for the rest of his life.\u201dA low voice flowed into my ears.\u201cTo make him struggle with longing, suffering, and barely breathing.\u201dHe continued.\u201cBecause it\u2019s the greatest punishment ever given to the boy who was madly eager to do so. Maybe greater than death itself.\u201dAt that moment, I got goosebumps.\u201cThe thought of her beautiful smile made the boy unable to eat or swallow water, and it was painful to keep his eyes open, so he stabbed himself in his eyes and blinded them. And the moment he died in his agony, he struggled to grab the white rose that had bloomed from Rotunia\u2019s dead spot.\u201dIt was a bitter obsession and a pitiful revenge.After hearing the story, the white rose that gave off a soft glow looked like the soul of a poor fairy.Reihausd\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThat\u2019s why the flower language of Rotunia is love of ruin.\u201dAfter a while I opened my mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s not love. It\u2019s an obsession, it\u2019s just a crime.\u201dIt\u2019s a legend, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, but I said firmly.The boy is a bastard.\u2018The superb bastard to be beaten to death.\u2019It\u2019s not enough to imprison the fairy, but to kill the man she loved. No matter how the characters were legends, he crossed the line firmly.\u201cIs that so.\u201dReihausd stared at the flower again.His cool gaze, mixed with subtle light, stayed on the white flower buds for a long time.\u201cIt must be an obsession to be greedy for something that needs to be let go.\u201dHis clear voice pierced my ears.\u201cWhy do I even think it\u2019s love?\u201dThe wind blew again, and the clusters of White Rotunia, which gave off a soft glow, rustled.There was a deep emotion in his dark eyes towards that pitiful rose.In a strange atmosphere, my whole body swept over me.\u201cIf you have a bitter heart that you want someone to stay by your side forever, even if you break the wings of whoever you want.\u201dAlthough there was no subject, it was a remark that made me goosebump. Then he looked back at me and said.\u201cHow displeased the Gods must be.\u201dHis low voice rang in my ears. And the moment my shoulder stiffened, a chat window flickered in front of me.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, roars with deep vigilance.][The God of Art, Mond, lays down his infinitely light moral standards.]Without keeping my eyes on him, I stared blankly at the chat window, then flinched my shoulders. His golden eyes were staring at me.It was terribly beautiful in the moonlight which I didn\u2019t know when it appeared.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, encourages you to make him one of your humble slaves with \u2018Oman\u2019s Lash\u2019.]I put on cloudy eyes mode and cleared the chat window.Reihausd\u2019s dangerous remarks were also bewildering, but he seemed to say something strange while I was reading the oracle in front of him.After a while, the chat window disappeared and only Reihausd was visible.He looked at me with an awkward expression and smiled faintly.\u201cForget what I just said.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s silence, I nodded.I want to forget it even if he doesn\u2019t say this.\u2018I have to forget it.\u2019My heart was pounding in confusion.Reihausd, who was a kind and gentle man in the original story, seemed to be hiding a black dragon inside.\u2018Why the hell did this happen?\u2019After a while he spoke again.\u201cI was thinking about how I would react if you were a real saintess, but suddenly I came back with a long story.\u201dAnd at those words, I wiggled my eyebrows.\u201cYes?\u201dA gentle breeze blew again, and the White Rotunia swayed.\u201cThe real saintess, you said. What nonsense are you talking about?\u201d I said to him with an awkward smile.\u201cIt\u2019s Sir Reihausd who made me the fake saintess. Why do you say that when you know it so clearly\u2026\u201dAriel in the original story was just a villain with a crooked family history. She was very far from sacred things, either a saintess or the Gods.He looked at me and opened his mouth.\u201cRemember when Ariel said to me you wanted this flower?\u201dI looked at him with an awkward expression and nodded. It is probably the flower Ariel wanted before I possessed her.Then Reihausd opened his lips and said.\u201cIf I plant that auspicious flower and see it every day, maybe someday it will dwell in me as well.\u201dSince I came here, I have read a lot of books, so I know all sorts of information, but I have never read a botanical encyclopedia.\u201cYou said that if you earnestly wish for something, it will come true.\u201dNaturally, I can\u2019t remember saying such a thing, so I just stood there silently and heard his voice again.\u201cYou know, the reason this white rose costs 500 franc each.\u201d500 franc\u2026 500 franc?I opened my eyes wide at the ridiculous price.\u201cBecause they\u2019re mythical creatures that can read those who have divine power.\u201dMy expression hardened as I looked at the place where a thousand flowers were in bloom.I had a sudden thought.\u201cThat\u2019s why the flower with this tragic legend is unfortunately also called \u2018the Flower Blessed by the Gods\u2019.\u201dReihausd\u2019s voice penetrated into my ears.\u201cPoor Rotunia.\u201dAnd then he reached out to me and put my hand on my shoulder. The weight of his hand is carried with a throbbing weight.As if he was preventing me from running away, he placed his hand on my shoulders and his eyes were fixed on my gaze, standing close to me.Then he twisted his lips and said with a cool expression.\u201cYou said earlier that this flower shines like a lantern.\u201dA low voice pierced my ears.\u201cThe light of Rotunia that appears at night can only be seen with either divine or holy power.\u201dI heard the sound of something crashing in my chest.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dHis gaze, filled with complex emotions, was pointed sharply at me.\u201cAriel.\u201dAh, I messed up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And I\u2019m trying to block such attempts.\u201cThe dream of White Rotunia swaying in the wind with a pure white light.\u201dI knew he wasn\u2019t a man to be deceived by cliche excuses.\u201cThat\u2019s why, for a while, I think it really shines softly.\u201dBut my acting skills were improving day by day.\u201cIt\u2019s the moonlight.\u201dI wish it was a full moon, but the new moon was a little disappointing, yet I put on a sad expression in my own way.His dark eyes were still following me.\u201cAm I mistaken for an excuse made up in a hurry?\u201dReihausd twisted his lips and said.He already knew everything, and for a moment I wondered if I was in his hands.But I answered in the guise of calmness.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a real saintess, so why would I lie?\u201dAriel in the book was jealous and admired the real saintess, Camilla. She would have sacrificed her soul if she could become a real saintess.\u201c\u2026.\u201dReihausd\u2019s eyes steadfastly turned towards me.I added words to avoid his suspicions.\u201cIf you really think that holy power has manifested in me, there\u2019s a way to check.\u201dIn the central temple, there was a huge Holy Sphere, so those with divine power could be read.Now is the time no one can enter the temple annex.This was a kind of adventure for me too, but it was still my last struggle to avoid interrogation of a saintess.\u201cAriel.\u201dAnd after a while he opened his mouth.\u201cI would rather have been mistaken. What you seem like these days is different from before.\u201dThose words made me flinch inside.\u201cWell, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to control myself.\u201dHis golden eyes glowed brightly in the darkness.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time something like this has happened\u2026\u201dWhat is the first time and difficult to control?And why did Reihausd, who was also in charge of warmth in the original story, become such a character full of decadence?\u201cTomorrow morning, before the temple opens, please come to the temple annex.\u201dI thought he had finished talking, but he opened his mouth again and spoke.Cold, dangerous eyes were looking at me.\u201cI\u2019ll have to check it out as Ariel said.\u201dA bell was ringing in my head to signal danger. I already felt a heavy feeling as if I had shackles on my ankle.***After a walk with Reihausd, I returned to my room late and found the window door open.For a moment, Kyle\u2019s words of stopping by tonight came to my mind, and I looked around the room with a chill on my spine.Fortunately, I closed the window, making sure that no one was looking at me. It was quite windy outside, it must have been opened by chance.However, that thought disappeared the moment I saw a paper on the desk.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI picked up the scribbled thing.[You\u2019re not in your room today, so I\u2019ll come tomorrow.]Of course, I could feel it was written by Kyle.Putting down the letter, I raised one hand and touched my forehead. I thought I had to get out of here as soon as possible.\u201cAh\u2026 Rather than that, starting tomorrow.\u201dI reactivated the oracle.[The God of Art, Mond, runs barefoot.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is wagging his tail.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, is curious about your business with Reihausd.]After coughing a couple of times, I looked at the chat window and said:\u201cThe one who will destroy the Holy Sphere in the temple annex before tomorrow morning.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, widens his eyes at your words.]It\u2019s probably something of great value. It is said that there is only one in the Empire.\u201cI will consider the one who does it as a benefactor for the rest of my life. Because this will make me get confined in the end.\u201dThe Holy Sphere was the most accurate tool for measuring divine power or holy power, and according to Reihausd, White Rotunia seemed to temporarily play such a role.\u201cDon\u2019t completely destroy it, but just temporarily disable it.\u201d[The Gods have entered into a serious meeting.]A message I had never seen before appeared.Even in a country that is favored by the Gods, would it be unreasonable to damage the Holy Sphere?The meeting went on for quite some time and I couldn\u2019t wait and lay in bed. And maybe it was because of the stressful routine, I fell asleep without realizing it.\u201cSaintess\u2026 Saintess\u2026!\u201dAt one point, I heard Daisy\u2019s voice in my ear.I frowned and opened my eyes to see the bright sunlight coming through the window.Daisy was stamping her feet with an anxious look.The moment I got up, I noticed that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t auspicious and asked her.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a big problem. I think you should go out and see it.\u201dI had just woken up and wasn\u2019t in a hurry, but I slowly walked out of the room.In various places in the hallway, priests and priestesses could be seen gathering three or three and talking.Daisy led me to the corridor leading to the annex.Then I remembered what I had asked the Gods for last night.Looking at this uproar, it seems that something has happened, but I haven\u2019t figured it out yet.And standing in front of the annex, I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201dThe Temple of Elium was divided into five main areas.The main building, where believers gather every week, and with the size of a soccer stadium, surprised even me from the modern era. Most of the temple functions were attached to this main building.Next, it\u2019s located in a location with good access to all the buildings, including the pavilion where priests and priestesses live, and I was living in the most luxurious and large room here.And there was the sanctuary, a tower where saints receive oracles, and a library that I had visited last time.The last one was an annex that could store holy relics and distinguish divine power and holy power.The annex was clearly on the third floor the last time I saw it, but now only the ruins of the building remain.Many priests were looking at the annex with serious expressions, and Reihausd\u2019s back was seen as he was standing and staring at the annex.\u201cIt happened early in the morning, so no one was hurt, but everyone was shocked.\u201dI looked at the collapsed building with an expression that couldn\u2019t be expressed in words of absurdity, and focused my eyes on the chat window.[The God of Love, Odyssey, insists that everyone worked together, so the share of the \u2018Lifetime Benefactor\u2019 should be 1/N.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, claims that his work was the greatest.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, suddenly swings his lash.]\u201cThis crazy!\u201dI forgot I was outside and screamed.I felt people\u2019s gazes on me, and I covered my mouth with my hand, but my heart was pounding.You\u2019re the Gods and that\u2019s a temple!\u2018Where are there Gods who destroy temples? You bastards!\u2019[The God of Art, Mond, is scratching his head, saying that he doesn\u2019t like it anyway because the annex building is poorly constructed.]Although the purpose of not using the Holy Sphere was achieved, the scale was too large and noisy.[The Gods have entered into a serious meeting.][The Gods have decided on the application of your title of \u2018Lifetime Benefactor\u2019.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, took half the stake, then the God of Knowledge, Hessed, the God of Destruction, Ciel, and the God of Art, Mond, shared a third of the remaining stake.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, protests that it\u2019s unfair and closes his mouth at Oman\u2019s lash.]They were the Gods who bought male leads stock like that, and now they are eager to go to the wrong place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know how long it will take to take it out and restore it.\u201d\u201c\u2026How could this be, if not a natural phenomenon?\u201dI pretended to be a casual face and asked him calmly.In other words, it was more natural for me to avoid suspicion that the building had been completely destroyed than that of destroying a single Holy Sphere\u201cThe majority of opinions are suspicious of the high-ranking magician\u2019s attack.\u201dI opened my eyes wide at the unexpected answer from him.\u201cHigh-ranking magician\u2026 You say?\u201dI knew that it was a worldview in which magic existed, but I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it because there was no wizard male lead\u201cProbably a 9th class, to destroy a building of this size in so many different ways.\u201dHe looked at the collapsed building with cold eyes.\u201cBut there are no 9th-class magicians in the Empire, and there are a lot of things that are ambiguous.\u201dAt his words, I tensed up and flinched my fingertips.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to ask Baron Vester to do it.\u201dHis piercing eyes turned to the wreckage.\u201cI need to know who dared to do this.\u201dAs soon as I heard the word Vester, my head throbbed and I cried.Diego Vester.I forgot him for a moment, the most troublesome villain of the original story.The greatest magician of the Empire who received the title of baron for his achievements, and his real identity was one of the Magic Dukes who ruled the Demon Realm.Ariel in the original story was crazy about her jealousy of Camilla and made a soul-bending contract with Diego Vester.According to the contract, Diego did harm to Camilla, but her power protected her and the three male leads rescued her.That story was about the only \u2018Demon tribe\u2019 related that appeared in the original story.So Diego was\u2026 He was the one person I shouldn\u2019t have met in order not to follow the original story.\u201cI don\u2019t agree with this.\u201dI said to Reihausd with my eyebrows hardened.He looked startled at my words, which hadn\u2019t given any opinion on the matters of the temple until now.\u201cIf we entrusted a request to the magicians about what happened in the temple, how funny would they think of the temple?\u201d99.9% of the people of the Empire believe in the Gods. So, the status of the temple is unquestionably strong.And of the 0.1% of people who don\u2019t believe in God, probably more than half of them are magicians.Those who aren\u2019t wizards will most likely be an unusual figure like Cass Lloyd.\u201cAlthough the Saintess is right, in a situation where we suspect the magician as the culprit, wouldn\u2019t it be better to ask them to catch the culprit themselves?\u201dA meager forty remained at the place where the magician used magic. And like fingerprints, it became the basis for arresting a magician who committed a crime.However, there was no way that forty people would remain in the destruction the Gods had made.\u201cThe magicians are distrustful, but they don\u2019t want to confront the temple.\u201dThe status of the temple in the Empire was almost equal to that of the Imperial Family, and magicians would know how much the honor of a magician in this country would be tarnished if it was revealed that they had done so to the temple.They will probably be eager to search the forty and find the culprit among them.Reihausd was to take advantage of this social situation.\u201cSo, what will you do if the criminal is caught?\u201dIn response to my question, he slightly hardened his fine brows with eyes that didn\u2019t understand my intentions.I continued talking.\u201cWhatever happens, if the culprit is made public, all the people of the Empire will know that the temple annex has been so devastated by a magician. Then the status of the temple will decline.\u201dI could see Reihausd\u2019s golden eyes fluttering a little.\u201cIf a magician comes in and destroys an annex, wouldn\u2019t it affect the security of the temple or even the confidence of the people of the Empire?\u201dMy purpose is to cover this up quietly.And it wasn\u2019t necessary to put a villain like Diego Vester into the temple.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201dAfter a while, Reihausd, who had been silent, opened his mouth. His golden eyes shone darkly.I shuddered at his words, but I looked at him with a calm expression.From the few encounters I\u2019ve had so far, I\u2019ve come to know that Reihausd is a pretty dangerous man.And I had a pretty strong intuition that my ending wouldn\u2019t be good if I was pushed back in that fight.\u201cI was just worried about the status of the temple. Magicians are luxuries, aren\u2019t they? What\u2019s the point of joining the team only in the temple?\u201dI just have to push it into a mode that says I\u2019m more mature than before.The corners of his lips twisted slightly at my words.After a while he opened his mouth without taking his eyes off me.\u201cThe words of the Saintess are also true. We will shut the mouths of the priests and quietly pursue the criminal through the Paladins.\u201dI nodded without making eye contact.\u201cThank you for reflecting on my opinion, Sir Reihausd.\u201dThen I turned around and said.\u201cI\u2019m very tired from seeing the shocking appearance since this morning. I need to rest a little more.\u201d***1,660 franc.I thought seriously about the money I had.\u2018Should I\u2026?\u2019Everything was going in a direction I hadn\u2019t thought of.Since the temple annex with the Holy Sphere has collapsed, there\u2019s no need to measure my power for the time being, so even if I can avoid Reihausd\u2019s investigation, Kyle will come to you tonight.After thinking for a while, I heard a knocking sound.\u201cSaintess. It\u2019s me.\u201dDaisy came in through the door and handed me an envelope.\u201cI have received a letter from the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cA letter?\u201dFrowning my eyebrows, I removed the seal from the envelope and pulled out the paper.The luxurious thick paper was decorated with the Imperial Family pattern.[I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stop by for a while. I\u2019ll visit you when I can afford it.-Kyle Alexis]I can\u2019t believe he wrote such a welcome message on such a uselessly good piece of paper.Kyle, you\u2019re a surprisingly sensible man.I casually put his letter in the drawer.\u2018Yeah, let\u2019s think about escaping a day or two more.\u2019A hasty judgment rarely helps in the long run. The nervousness in my heart has disappeared a bit.\u201cAnd today, a person from the Imperial Family met the high priest.\u201d\u201cFrom the Imperial Family?\u201dWe decided to keep the annex\u2019s affairs a secret, so it\u2019s probably not because of that, and I wondered if it had anything to do with the letter I received from Kyle today.But I didn\u2019t really care what it was .\u201cAh, Daisy.\u201d\u201cYes. Saintess.\u201dI said while thinking about what was just around the corner.\u201cThe temple must have sent a carriage to Thiago.\u201d\u201cThiago?\u201dDaisy was pretty quick with information, and through her I could quickly hear what was going on in the temple.However, the story about the saintess who had newly appeared in Thiago was kept secret except for the high-ranking officials, so she didn\u2019t know.\u201cCan you tell me when the carriage is going to arrive at the temple again?\u201d\u201cYes. I know some coaches, I\u2019ll ask them.\u201dAfter a while, Daisy, who had left to ask a question, came back to the room.\u201cThe carriage left about ten days ago, and considering the length of stay, it would take about fifteen days.\u201dIt was ten days ago.They had already decided to bring her in about a week before Reihausd told me about the girl in Thiago.I had a strange feeling.They\u2019re bringing in a new saintess, so why are they interested in my holy power?I\u2019m saying that a simple holy power measurement will be easy the moment she arrives.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Thiago\u2019s carriage returns, I may leave the temple.\u201dThis child who came under me and trusted only me had a right to hear what was happening.Daisy\u2019s eyes fluttered violently.\u201cWhat do you mean, Saintess?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re smart and quick-witted, so even if a new superior comes along, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cSaintess! No way! Are you going to leave?\u201dI shut my mouth and Daisy shook her head.\u201c\u2026I was also noticing that the Saintess\u2019 heart wasn\u2019t in the temple. But you take me wherever you go. As the Saintess said, I\u2019m smart and quick-witted.\u201dI hardened my eyebrows at Daisy\u2019s words.\u201cAre you just trying to waste the time you\u2019ve spent until you become Elium\u2019s apprentice priestess?\u201dIn modern terms, it\u2019s like she has passed the civil service exam, but she\u2019s following me. That\u2019s absurd.\u201cI entered the temple, but I was struggling because it didn\u2019t fit my aptitude. When I was wandering and suffering, the Saintess gave me your hand and pushed me. So I don\u2019t care.\u201dSeeing Daisy\u2019s bright eyes saying that she would follow me somehow, I felt a bit of regret, wondering if I had said it for nothing.\u201c\u2026I never said I was going to leave 100% percent. I was just talking about the possibilities.\u201dEventually I turned the end of my talk.The idea of running a business with Daisy as an employee came to mind, but I wasn\u2019t convinced enough to change a person\u2019s life.\u201cAnyway, if you leave, I\u2019ll follow you wherever you go. Saintess.\u201dDaisy clenched her fists and shouted resolutely.***Taking a walk as an excuse, I stopped at the third pillar on the east side of the ceremonial hall attached to the main building. Because it was the day I decided to meet the child of the Burglar\u2019s Guild that I saved.The annex collapsed and security was further strengthened, it was doubtful whether the child could come.However, before the doubts could subside, I heard the child\u2019s voice behind my back.\u201cYou were\u2026 the Saintess.\u201dWhen I turned around, I saw the child standing there, dressed in neater clothes than before. Perhaps he bought the clothes with the money I gave him.I smiled softly and opened my mouth calmly.\u201cTurns out you\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\u201cThe Burglar\u2019s Guild\u2019s information is the best in the Empire.\u201dThere was pride in the child\u2019s eyes.\u201cDid you search for what I said?\u201dThe child nodded his head and he immediately opened his mouth.\u201cI know that the garnet necklace that Empress, the mother of Prince Kyle, received from the Empress Dowager was in the hands of Count Rosento.\u201dI asked back, pretending not to know.\u201cCount Rosento?\u201d\u201cYeah. The Count\u2019s grandfather, Hegen Rosento, bought the necklace from stolen goods 30 years ago. But now it has been sold to a woman through an auction and isn\u2019t in his possession. She looks like a noble girl, but she doesn\u2019t show her face in social circles, so we don\u2019t even have information about her in our guild.\u201dI hid my surprise inside and said to the child.\u201cYes. That\u2019s enough.\u201dThe accuracy of the information exceeded expectations.I took 50 franc out of my pocket and handed it to him.[Your Money: 1,610 franc]\u201cThis is the next information request.\u201dIt\u2019s a lot of money, so it\u2019s a little heartbreaking, but there was nothing like money to build trust with each other.\u201cBecause you, too, will need what it takes to dig up information from your superiors.\u201dThe child with money in his inner pocket looked at me with clear eyes.\u201cThis time, find out about a person from the Ares area.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAround evening, Reihausd came to see me. On the other side of the closing door, I saw Dwayne with a shaky expression on his face.After the last outing, for some reason, he seemed reluctant to me, but I didn\u2019t really care.\u201cThe blessings of the Nine Gods\u2026\u201d\u201cAriel.\u201dBefore I could finish my words, he called my name.

For what reason?\u201dI asked him calmly, suppressing some anxiety.The words that came out of his mouth were unexpected.\u201cDo you know that the Empress was in the meeting?\u201dThe face of the Empress, whom I had only seen once, passed by. Compared to the Emperor with a heavy impression, she was a young and beautiful woman. There was a bit of a venomous look on his face when he said.\u2018If the Empress is pregnant\u2026 Won\u2019t that make Kyle\u2019s position even more precarious?\u2019\u201cShe said she wanted to receive the blessing of the Saintess.\u201dAs he continued, I remembered a passage from one of the books I had read.When the immediate Imperial descendant is appointed, they will be blessed by the Saintess.This is because it is believed that most fetuses protected by divine blessing are led to unharmed births, and after the birth, they\u2019re blessed one more time.\u201cSo I have to decide whether I should send you or Thiago\u2019s new saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s my last mission as a fake saintess, so if you send me, I\u2019ll go.\u201dAt my words, Reyhaus looked at me silently with dark eyes and opened his mouth.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t like you going to the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut if you don\u2019t let me go, it\u2019ll be strange.\u201dHis eyes twinkled. As if reason and emotion were fighting fiercely. All in all, it was a really useless fight.His troubled eyes shone even more darkly.\u201cI know how many times Prince Kyle has visited you.\u201dIt was no surprise as his eyes and ears were everywhere.\u201cDo you still like Prince Kyle?\u201dNo, why is the conversation suddenly flowing this way?\u201cSir Reihausd.\u201dI looked at him and said with a firm expression.\u201cPerhaps\u2026 Have you been drinking?\u201dIn this world, it wasn\u2019t a problem for priests to enjoy alcohol in moderation. There was a slight scent of alcohol in the air, but he immediately opened his mouth.\u201cYes.\u201dThen he took a step closer to me.I flinched, still looking straight up at him without backing down.A dangerous light flowed through the golden eyes.\u201cI was comforted by alcohol because things didn\u2019t go as I expected.\u201dHis face was particularly decadent with the dim light behind him rather than the bright incandescent light. Even I was dazzled by those red lips for a moment.\u201cI thought I had dedicated this body to the Gods.\u201dHe lowered his head and placed his forehead on my shoulder. A low voice rang in my ears.\u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t like that. When I see things like this in my head.\u201dAnd a chat window flashed in front of me.[The God of Art, Mond, is delighted and surrenders Reihausd\u2019s body to you.]And I heard his voice again.\u201cAt best, I made a comfortable place for you to live in the basement of the annex after your retirement, which was completely destroyed by the earthquake\u2026\u201dAt that moment, my spine cooled.\u2018Hmm? Living in the basement of the annex?\u2019[The God of Destruction, Ciel, growls.][The God of Art, Mond, talks about the aesthetics of confinement.]Ah, the fact that I shouted to the Gods when I saw the annex collapsed earlier is canceled. Well done, my Gods.\u201cI\u2019m wondering what to do to protect you from the Insidious Prince.\u201dExcuse me, I think you\u2019re the most insidious, though?Before the atmosphere got weird again, I opened my mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Sir Reihausd. I\u2019ll take good care of my well-being. So, go ahead and rest today.\u201dThen he raised his head and looked at me, smiling softly.He was a little crazy, but when he smiled, he looked like an angel that had descended.He deserves to be praised aesthetically by the God of Art, Mond.\u201cAlright. Ariel.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I said too many useless things today. Forget it and go to sleep.\u201dAfter speaking in a soft voice, he returned to his usual footsteps.After he left, I let out the breath I had been holding in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And in a chair a little further away, her younger brother, Alberto Mikhael, was sitting crookedly.\u201cThe boredom is short-lived, Sister. We\u2019ll see something interesting soon.\u201dAt those words, the tip of Ros\u00e9\u2019s lips rose at an angle.\u201cI asked them to send the Saintess as soon as possible under the pretext of miscarriage, so she\u2019ll be here at least within a week, right?\u201dRos\u00e9 remembered the face of the Saintess, Ariel.Prince Kyle\u2019s birthday banquet. At that time, there was an incident that was just right to lower his reputation, and her brazen face protected Kyle, and everything was thwarted.\u2018She\u2019s like a nasty bitch.\u2019\u201cShe\u2019s daring for such a fake thing.\u201dRos\u00e9 said to Alberto with a venomous smile.\u201cI had no idea that you would play such an important role as Count Mikhael\u2019s prodigal son. This sister is very happy. When this is over, I\u2019ll give you a lot of compliments.\u201dAlberto shrugged his shoulders.\u201cThe Saintess and the High Priest would have thought it would be over if they killed a maid who knew the secret. Well, who knows? I didn\u2019t know that girl was into me.\u201dAlberto\u2019s female bias was very strong. He replaced women with the vast background of being the Empress\u2019s younger brother, including Annie, one of the temple maids.Her face was pretty flat, and she was a woman he met for fun sometimes when he went to the temple.But she fell in love with him and started giving him gifts that didn\u2019t fit the theme.She gave him a pair of shoes for 500 franc, thus he asked where the money came from, and she told him a very surprising story.She told a secret that the current saintess is a fake saintess, and that she paid a lot of money in return for closing her eyes to herself who knew it.He could fully guess from Annie\u2019s words that the Saintess was a stupid and naive woman.A few weeks later, Annie disappeared.\u2018It\u2019s unsatisfying, but well.\u2019After hearing the truth from Alberto, Ros\u00e9 was always worried. What would she get from the High Priest using this enormous secret as an excuse?However, at Prince Kyle\u2019s thorny birthday banquet, after seeing the secret moves of the two and the Saintess protecting him, she decided to use this fact for something bigger.If Kyle is involved, it could be a great cause to attack Crown Prince, Kyle.And she took as a witness a servant who knew about Kyle sending a letter to the fake saintess. The servant testified that Ariel had written several letters to Kyle.\u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable that the divine power of the Saintess has disappeared and a new saintess has appeared\u2026\u201dRos\u00e9 hardened her eyebrows and raised the corners of his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s a different story if she was a fake saintess in the first place.\u201dAt her words, Alberto responded with cool eyes.\u201cThe wind and blood will blow in the country.\u201dAnd he went on.\u201cIf things go wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cAlberto.\u201d\u201cYou can put the blame on her and Kyle for your miscarriage.\u201dRos\u00e9 looked down and let out a small sigh.The hands of the maids washing Ros\u00e9\u2019s feet were shaking. They instinctively knew that what they had just heard was not something they should listen to.\u201cThe news that my brother was trampling on people with a horse\u2019s hoof isn\u2019t good for this sister\u2019s prenatal education.\u201dRos\u00e9 raised her hand and ruffled her slightly messy hair behind her ear.\u201cI see that this is how you rebel today.\u201d\u201cE-Empress.\u201dRos\u00e9, who had lifted her foot and pushed a trembling maid straight away, blinked at Alberto.\u201cI got tired. Take care of it yourself.\u201dAt that, Alberto chuckled. Then, in a loud voice, he called his henchmen, the knight commander of Mikhael.Soon, ugly-looking knights came in and dragged the maids out.\u201cThen rest, Sister.\u201dAs if the maids had never been dragged out, Alberto greeted her calmly.The head maid, who came in, bowed to him, took a towel, and wiped Ros\u00e9\u2019s feet.Ros\u00e9 walked with her bare feet on the marble floor to the bed with a canopy. The music good for prenatal education was softly resounding from the small magic music box.***The temple annex went into restoration work. I often stop by to see the restoration work, and the wreckage, now exposed to the ground, has largely disappeared.If they ever find the Holy Sphere buried in the ground, Reihausd might call me right away.In addition to the salary I received recently, the money I secured by going to and from the auction houses several times is now 3,500 franc.I clenched my fists as I recalled a certain relic in <Shop>.It was a little bit difficult for me, but to think that I could go to Lloyd\u2019s Merchant one more time, on the contrary, I just need to hold on for today.\u201cSaintess, the carriage is ready.\u201dDwayne\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dWearing a white lace dress, I gently climbed into the white carriage bearing the Elium pattern.Today was the day I went to the Imperial Palace.Not long after the carriage departed, it passed through the entrance to the Imperial Palace. And soon we stopped in front of the latter, where the Empress lived.As Dwayne escorted me, I got off the carriage. No matter how strong the influence of the temple was, Elium didn\u2019t reach the splendor of the Imperial Palace.The pond, the gorgeous bridge, and the grandeur of the palace seemed like another world.\u2018Whoaa.\u2019I looked at them curiously and entered the building.When I walked down the long corridor and arrived at the Empress\u2019 room, I took a deep breath.And as soon as the door opened, I bowed slightly to greet them.\u201cMay the blessings of the Nine Gods rest upon His Imperial Majesty the Emperor and the Empress.\u201dOn a large bed with a canopy, the Empress leaned unnaturally.The Emperor and Kyle stood around, and next to them, I saw a stranger\u2019s face. He had the same hair color as the Empress, blond hair, and the same eyes.\u2018Hmm? Where did I see him?\u2019It was a face with a strange feeling.\u201cOh, the Saintess is here.\u201dThe Emperor greeted me with a friendly face.\u201cHow have you been?\u201dI smiled lightly and greeted him.But Kyle\u2019s complexion wasn\u2019t that good.It has to be. It\u2019s not good news for Kyle that the Empress is pregnant.It was when I walked lightly to their front.A woman who had been sitting holding the Empress\u2019s wrist and hadn\u2019t been seen abruptly stood up. She was a woman who looked a year or two younger than me, with blue hair and black eyes.She was wearing a white lace dress similar to mine. And she was staring at me with a very static and calm expression.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAs I wiggled my eyebrows, the Empress opened her mouth.\u201cThe blessing was urgent, so I stole the carriage from Thiago in advance. I hope the temple will understand generously.\u201dAt those words, I began to have an ominous feeling.Then the Emperor\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cIt is said that the divine power of a saintess has been newly manifested. It\u2019s uncommon to have two saintesses in a generation, although it\u2019s hard to understand\u2026 Anyway, we need a blessing, so I called her right away.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon\u2026\u201dThe Empress followed.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201dKyle was looking at the Empress with stern eyes.She looked at me with a little sigh.Her face was alluring, but her eyes were young with ferocious poison.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Your Imperial Majesty. In fact, the reason I brought these two saintesses together is because I have recognized the impure and unscrupulous problems that exist, as well as the problem of blessing for our baby.\u201dThe girl from Thiago lowered her eyes down a little.Actually, I didn\u2019t expect this to happen at all.I tried not to be agitated and calmed my mind.\u201cIt\u2019s an unscrupulous matter.\u201d\u201cAh, my head.\u201dThe Empress rested one hand on her forehead and laid back on the bed. I saw her at Kyle\u2019s birthday banquet, but I could guess what kind of character she was.\u201cRos\u00e9, don\u2019t overdo it now and rest. I will investigate the matter.\u201dThe Emperor spoke to her with a worried face.\u201cSister isn\u2019t feeling well due to pregnancy, so may I speak on her behalf?\u201dThere was a voice intervening in the gap. He was an unfamiliar, yet strangely elusive man.The Emperor turned his gaze to him and spoke in a stern voice.\u201cTell me what happened, Sir Mikhael.\u201dIf it\u2019s Mikhael, it\u2019s the same last name as Ros\u00e9\u2019s before her marriage. So he might be her brother.\u2018Alberto Mikhael?\u2019And at that moment, the man who struck down the child of the Burglar\u2019s Guild flashed through my mind.Oh, this punk! Isn\u2019t he that bastard?So\u2026 they\u2019re villain siblings, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What blasphemy is this!\u201d The Emperor roared.That voice resounded in the Empress\u2019 room.A saintess is the leader of the temple, and is second only to the Emperor in the Empire. It is said that although by law she bows her head to the Imperial Family, she\u2019s of a state of dignity equal to that of the Imperial Family.\u201cSaintess. Please understand my brother-in-law\u2019s faults with kindness\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Imperial Majesty. Alberto is right.\u201dAnd then the Empress\u2019 voice was heard from the bed.\u201cWhen I found out, I was devastated.\u201dThe new saintess from Thiago stood beside her without a word, with her head bowed.\u201cIt is said that there was a maid named Annie who had been taking care of the Saintess until last month, and she went to Alberto and confessed her guilt, saying she would tell the truth While Alberto was thinking about whether the country would turn upside down if the truth was revealed, a real saintess appeared in Thiago, and only now I was able to announce it.\u201dHaa, Annie.I furrowed my eyebrows at the sudden appearance of Annie\u2019s name.\u2018So the person inside the temple that the Empress\u2019s younger brother had communicated secretly with was Annie.\u2019That girl plucked 650 franc a month from Ariel for her weakness as she was a fake saintess.\u201cInvestigation with the assistance of the High Priest will reveal that Annie received a considerable sum of money from the Saintess each month in exchange for her silence. She\u2019s missing and we can\u2019t investigate her personally, but she also has a handwritten letter.\u201dAlberto took the letter from the inside and unfolded it. The letter, written in round handwriting, said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s hard to please a fake saintess.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s eyebrows hardened.His gaze slowly turned to me.\u201cWhat do you think of this story, Saintess?\u201dI closed my mouth and walked over to Alberto, reaching out my hand.\u201cWould you give me that letter?\u201dAlberto snorted his nose and he continued to speak to the emperor.His voice reading the letter could be heard nearby.\u201cAnd if you look at it,\u00a0\u2018She asked how to write a letter of proposal to the Crown Prince and I told her. I write obscene words on purpose and tell her that men like these things, but if she follows them straight away, you can tell that she\u2019s a vulgar and stupid woman.\u2019\u00a0This is absolutely absurd for a saintess to do.\u201dAh. Maybe that\u2019s why she wrote such an absurd letter?My head was pounding at the newly revealed truth.At that, the Emperor looked at Kyle and asked.\u201cA letter of proposal? What does that mean?\u201dKyle answered with his cold red eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe person who created the existence of me is Kyle, so you shouldn\u2019t ask him.I shook my head inwardly.Alberto said, biting his tongue.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty. It\u2019s not written in this letter, but Annie once said something like this. The Crown Prince knows that she\u2019s a fake saintess. Wouldn\u2019t that mean that he was clearly an accomplice? Besides, if she\u2019s even proposing, they\u2019re in a normal relationship\u2026\u201d\u201cOh. Alberto.\u201dAnd Ros\u00e9\u2019s tired voice could be heard from the bed like a well-written script.\u201cWhen you talked to me, there was no such thing. How could the Crown Prince be involved in this\u2026\u201d\u201cHer Imperial Majesty, please calm down.\u201dAnd the gentle voice of a \u2018real saintess\u2019.The Emperor\u2019s face was as hard as a stone statue, and doubts about me, who had been listening without a word, slowly filled his eyes.\u201cWhy is there no answer? Saintess.\u201dA thorn-like air was entwining my neck, forcing me to confess something. If it was Ariel, she would have started to tremble with tears and runny nose.But I\u2019m not Ariel. All the voices are true, but in the end they are nothing.My head went cold and I thought of the best option I could make at this moment.\u201cSir Mikhael.\u201dI heard Kyle\u2019s cold voice.\u201cCan you take responsibility for the nonsensical story that came out of your mouth with your life?\u201dAt Kyle\u2019s murderous eyes, Alberto staggered backwards and appealed to the Emperor.\u201cThe Crown Prince is intimidating me.\u201dKyle looked at him with contempt and turned his gaze to the Emperor.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty.\u201dAnd when Kyle finally spoke his words in a low voice to protect me, I arranged everything I had to do from now on. And I opened my mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s just a maid and what not.\u201dAll eyes were focused on me.\u201cWith a delusional letter or something, are you trying to make me a fake saintess?\u201dAlberto\u2019s narrowed eyebrows were troubled.\u201cEven a real saintess has appeared, but she\u2019s still pretending!\u201d\u201cAny proof that that woman is a real saintess?\u201dI asked, raising the tip of my lips at an angle.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAlberto\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cYou sure are very shameless.\u201dRos\u00e9\u2019s edgy voice was heard.I came to one conclusion about them. There is a high probability that even the saintess named Tina is also fake.First of all, she wasn\u2019t \u2018Camilla\u2019, the real saintess in the original story.I wondered if it had changed to something from another area, but her appearance was different from the platinum-haired Camilla.And secondly, if it is revealed that I\u2019m a fake saintess, both the Crown Prince and the High Priest will suffer a devastating blow. Then, on the contrary, this time, even if the Empress sets up a fake saintess, she won\u2019t have anyone in a position to question her.This is the procedure for verifying the power of the Holy Sphere, as long as the documents are decorated appropriately, just like Reihausd did to Ariel.This kid from Thiago seems to have the power, so she\u2019ll do a better job of the \u2018fake saintess\u2019 role than me.\u2018If it\u2019s fake versus fake, there\u2019s no hesitation.\u2019Alberto\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cMiss Tina made a deer walk, in which it was unable to walk because of its broken leg, and opened the eyes of a blind man who couldn\u2019t see. A lot of people in Thiago saw it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYet you\u2019ve never shown your strength under the excuse that you\u2019re weak. It\u2019s clear who the fake saintess is.\u201dI made a small noise,\u00a0\u201cHm,\u201d\u00a0and asked the Empress.\u201cIs the Empress\u2019 opinion the same?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe tip of Ros\u00e9\u2019s thin eyebrows wiggled.No matter what the Empress had prepared, I wasn\u2019t afraid.Because I have them.\u201cAre you sure that woman is a real saintess? Your Imperial Majesty the Empress.\u201dA chat window flashed in front of my eyes.[The God of Art, Mond, criticizes Mikhael\u2019s face.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, caresses the handle of the lash.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is growling.]Alberto hesitated at my unstoppable voice, but I continued speaking without hesitation.\u201cThe expression on her face makes it seem like she\u2019s not confident.\u201dThen the Emperor said:\u201cWhat do you think, Empress?\u201d\u201cYour Imperial Majesty! I\u2026\u201dI could feel the Empress\u2019 gaze with her mouth shut.The Saintess of Thiago, with her anxious eyes shaking next to her, also looked funny now.Annie must have told Alberto about Ariel\u2019s stupidity. He must have judged that this poor plan alone would be enough to drive Ariel.\u2018But what should we do? I\u2019m not Ariel.\u2019Aside from coming out of the temple, I don\u2019t want to die as a scammer.\u201cBring the Imperial pharmacists. It will help us distinguish between fake saintesses.\u201d\u201cI will do as the Saintess says.\u201dThe Emperor readily accepted my offer.\u201cBut, Your Imperial Majesty, if she had made a move in advance\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the Imperial Palace is so weak that she can make a move from outside? Why are you so opposed to it when you haven\u2019t even proposed a way? Sir.\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s words, Alberto was forced to take a step back.In my opinion, the Emperor had an ordinary and blunt face, but he wasn\u2019t that blunt on the inside. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t want to lose Kyle to this.Whether it was the heart of a father who loved his child, or he didn\u2019t want to disturb the balance of power between the Empress and the Crown Prince, he listened to me anyway.If it were revealed that I was a fake saintess, it was clear that Kyle would suffer as well.After a while, four Imperial pharmacists entered. Pharmacists have no power, but they will be adept at all kinds of herbs and plants in the world.\u201cAriel.\u201dKyle\u2019s low voice sounded like a whisper.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dHis red eyes fluttered.I turned my head slightly to look at him and smiled faintly.\u201cLook carefully from now on.\u201dI\u2019ll turn it over for sure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know what Empress Ros\u00e9 whispered in her ear, but her eyes were pretty full of will.I checked something that had been uprooted in a hurry this morning.\u2018I told Dwayne it was for research, but I was actually planning on selling it on the way back to fill up my money.\u2019\u201cWould you close all the curtains? Dimly.\u201dThen Kyle gave the servants a glance, and the Empress\u2019 room quickly became dark.I opened the package and held it. It was a White Rotunia with roots.I saw the Empress narrowing her eyebrows.\u201cI think pharmacists know what this is.\u201dThe pharmacists\u2019 eyes widened. It\u2019s rare to see a beautiful white rose that costs 500 franc each, and has no medicinal efficacy.\u201cAnd in my eyes I see the delicate light of the flower.\u201d\u201cA flower gives off light? What kind of craft is that?\u201dAlberto stopped me, but the pharmacists all agreed with my answer.The heavy gaze of the Emperor was on me.\u201cWhite Rotunia is a flower that shows its light to those who have holy and divine power. It\u2019s a little-known fact, but pharmacists will know.\u201dAlberto looked dissatisfied, yet he couldn\u2019t deny the fact.\u201cAnd the Saintess from Thiago, Miss Tina. If you really have holy power, you will see it in your eyes.\u201dTo my words, she replied with subtle wobbly eyes.\u201cO-Of course.\u201dAlthough she may not have holy power, she must be a woman with a degree of divine power. It\u2019s also pretty strong. So it would have been possible to heal.\u201cPharmacists, grind this flower well into tea, and also prepare a White Sand flower, which is said to have the worst poison in the Empire.\u201dI could see Kyle\u2019s eyebrows hardening at my words.The White Sand flower was a plant that looked like a white rose, and it was a rare plant with a venomous poison in its petals. If you grind the two of them, you probably won\u2019t be able to tell which one is the Rotunia.I continued speaking calmly, indifferently.\u201cRotunia is a mysterious flower, and if you\u2019re a saintess, you can tell which tea is Rotunia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple test.\u201d\u201cSaintess.\u201dThe Emperor opened his mouth.\u201cThen you can tell a fake saintess by choosing Rotunia tea?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI laughed softly.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. Shouldn\u2019t you have the courage to drink and die if you pick the wrong tea? Then the results will be certain.\u201dI could see the face of the Saintess from Thiago hardening at my words.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re not confident, right?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dSaintess Tina from Thiago answered my words without losing.Alberto had a mysterious gaze even though his face was hardened.As far as he knew, Ariel was a fool with no power, so I could see him rolling his head, thinking,\u00a0\u201cWhy is she suggesting this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? Her Imperial Majesty the Empress.\u201dI handed over the decision-making authority of this test to the Empress.Everyone\u2019s eyes focused on the Empress, who was lying obliquely on the bed with one hand on her stomach.\u201cI would like to reveal the truth to the Empress, who is devoting her efforts to uncovering the fake saintess even during her pregnancy. But if it interferes with prenatal education, there is nothing I can do about it.\u201dHer eyebrows twitched at my words.After a while, the red, chapped lips opened.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty. You can do that. Because there is nothing more harmful to prenatal education than a dizzying state of affairs.\u201dAt the words of the Empress, the Emperor nodded his head.\u201cPharmacists, as the Saintess says, prepare two teas with no mistakes, and go out so as not to give a signal by any chance. The positions of the two cups of tea will be chosen by Sir Mikhael, and the two saintesses will have to cover their noses with a cloth and choose which one is Rotunia with only their eyes.\u201dI saw Tina.She had an anxious expression on her face, but she didn\u2019t seem to be shaken by believing in herself with power.\u201cAre you going to risk your life?\u201dAs everyone was busy getting ready, Kyle came up to me and said.His red eyes sank low. He seemed to think this was probably my bluff, guts, or even prepared to die.It was no wonder as Ariel was a fake saintess and he would think she had no talent to see Rotunia.\u201cYour Highness, you can just keep an eye on me quietly.\u201dI said to him with a calm look.His red eyes twinkled a little.As he tried to open his lips, I turned my gaze to meet Alberto, who was staring intently at me.\u2018He\u2019s anxious to catch any weakness.\u2019I raised one corner of my lips and laughed at him, then said to Kyle.\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201dAnd turned my back on him.A heavy gaze was felt on the back of my head.Moments later, a trolley with two cups of tea covered in black cloth entered the dimly lit room.The people in the room were the Emperor and Empress, Kyle and Alberto, the Saintess from Thiago, Tina, and I.The soldiers were waiting outside. In case of emergency.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn an atmosphere of tension, the Emperor glanced at Mikhael, and he placed two glasses under the black cloth on the table.The Emperor himself lifted the cloth over it. The amount of tea in the two glass teacups was the same, and the color was the same.I could see Tina\u2019s eyes fluttering sharply.I said to her calmly.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a choice. Choose first.\u201dAfter looking at the two cups of tea with her pale face for a long time, she looked at the Emperor and said,\u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy!\u201dAt those words, the Emperor hardened his eyebrows.\u201cBoth cups don\u2019t contain Rotunia. Neither of the cups of tea shines!\u201dHer anxious gaze turned to the Empress.The Empress gave her a bewildered look, and she said to the Emperor.\u201cI have to tell the pharmacists to make tea again\u2026\u201dAnd I opened my mouth and hung up.\u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201dHer eyes shook at my voice.\u201cYou\u2019re sure you have the power, right? It shines like this to my eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of trick is this!!\u201dAt my words, Tina lost her reason and became very angry.\u201cUnless you can\u2019t tell the difference because you\u2019re cheating with your power, which is divine power rather than holy power\u2026\u201dI casually picked up one of the glasses.I saw Kyle approaching me with an urgent, hard expression. But sipping it was quicker for me.\u201c\u2026!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes were on me.I frowned a little and stood there for a while.\u201c\u2026Is there any way other than that?\u201dAnd after a while I smiled.\u201cAh, it\u2019s a bit bitter.\u201dAlberto looked as if his eyes were about to pop out at any moment.I murmured calmly.\u201cRotunia is nothing like tea.\u201dKyle was still there, and the Empress\u2019 complexion couldn\u2019t be seen any more.The Saintess from Thiago looked at me and was mesmerized.The Emperor stared at me for a long time before opening his mouth.\u201cPlease choose.\u201dEven if his gaze was directed at me, those words weren\u2019t directed at me. These were the words to Tina, who was standing blankly.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you choose the remaining cup and drink it?\u201dTina was startled by the Emperor\u2019s words with her hands trembling.\u201cS-Something is wrong.\u201dShe said, looking at Alberto and the Empress alternately with her face turned white.\u201cIt\u2019s not like this. There really was no light. That woman must have made a strange move!\u201dBut no one in the room listened to her.She sat down and shook her head as her legs were loosened.\u201cIt can\u2019t be like this. This can\u2019t be!\u201dIt is natural. Even if she had the power, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell which of the two cups of tea was Rotunia.The day I was walking through the flower fields of Rotunia with Reihausd, I noticed that the petals that had been unintentionally opened didn\u2019t give off light.Like a mini light bulb connected to a battery, the petals separated from the roots are crushed and the light is blown away.But I have an assistant who can discern the subtle differences between Rotunia and White Sand powder from a thousand miles away.[The God of Art, Mond, shrugs his shoulders.]Thus, this was a game I had no choice but to win in the first place, whether she was real or fake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is different from what you said. You said you would give me the wealth and honor of Elium\u2026\u201d\u201cYou dirty fake saintess!\u201dAlberto took a teacup from the table and, before anyone could stop him, grabbed her chin and forced it into her slightly gaping lips.\u201cHow dare you deceive me and the Empress!\u201dTea water from the cup dripped into her lips.\u201cSir Mikhael!\u201dKyle shouted and approached Alberto, pulled him off by force and rolled him up.But the cup already clinked and shattered when it hit the floor. And, having already drunk it to some extent, the Fake Saintess from Thiago, Tina, grabbed her neck with two hands.\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201dI furrowed my eyebrows.Although I\u2019m a compulsive accomplice to this fraud, it wasn\u2019t pleasant to watch people die in front of my eyes.The \u2018white\u2019 of White Sand flower was named not because the flower was white, but because people died within a hundred seconds. (t/n: both \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018a hundred\u2019 are called \ubc31 (baek) in korean)\u201cDrag her out!\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s thunderous cry, the door opened and the soldiers entered. And they started dragging out the dying fake saintess.Alberto, whose complexion had turned red, bowed deeply to the Emperor.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty. I didn\u2019t think the saintess I brought from the temple was a fake\u2026 . I deeply apologize.\u201dThe Emperor shouted at Mikhael in an angry voice.\u201cSuch an absurd disrespect is being committed! Besides, you\u2019re blaming the temple for this madness?!\u201dThe Empress was keeping her mouth shut with her tight face.It was funny that her hand flinched every time the Emperor shouted.\u201cQuickly get down on your knees to the Saintess and ask for forgiveness!\u201dAt the Emperor\u2019s words, Alberto put on a bewildered expression, and I twisted the tip of my lips.He grinded his teeth and knelt before me.Since the incumbent Empress couldn\u2019t bow down and apologize, the Emperor was planning to blame Alberto for everything.\u201cPlease forgive me for my disrespect. Saintess.\u201dI leaned slightly down and made eye contact with him.\u2018He\u2019s a madman who hits people with a horse, and he just killed a woman.\u2019How many people are being harmed?\u201cSir Mikhael.\u201dI raised my hand and patted him on the cheek.In the eyes of others, it will look like it was just brought. However, since I used Ciel\u2019s blessing, he must have felt a shock similar to being slapped on the cheek.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI saw him widen his eyes.I whispered to him, still smiling.\u201cJust now, the God of Benevolence has told me to deliver it.\u201dI got up again and smiled softly.\u201cPlease be careful in the future.\u201dA chat window flashed in front of me.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, nods satisfactorily.]Well, it\u2019s not a lie.Then the Emperor\u2019s trembling voice was heard.\u201cToday\u2019s work is on me, not the temple.\u201dI bowed my head slightly to the Emperor and said,\u201cIt must be my fault that they misunderstood because I\u2019m weak.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, pays tribute to your acting skills.]The Emperor paused his words and opened his mouth again.\u201cYou are indeed the spiritual leader of Elium and the people of the Empire. My\u2026\u201dHe immediately placed a hand on Kyle\u2019s shoulder, who was standing next to him.\u201cPlease keep in touch with my son in the future.\u201dI could see Kyle\u2019s eyebrows wriggle at the Emperor\u2019s words.I smiled awkwardly and the emperor continued.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to say it at a place like this, but if the Saintess is really close enough to my son to write a proposal letter, you are welcomed to the Imperial Family.\u201dNot knowing how to respond, Kyle broke the brief silence that followed.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty. The Saintess seems tired today, so I will see her off.\u201dThe Emperor nodded his head.\u201cYes. Do that. And.\u201dThe Emperor continued with an awkward smile.\u201cI\u2019ll give the Saintess royal treasures as gifts for you who came running here, so please wait a little bit.\u201dIt seemed to be a gift to compensate for today\u2019s disrespect.\u2018The price of the White Rotunia root will be fully compensated.\u2019I glanced towards the Empress.She was holding her stomach tight and staring at this side with her piercing eyes.The dark face suited her quite well.***One can only escort someone to the carriage, but Kyle went all the way to get on the carriage. And he offered to take me to the temple.He seemed to have something to say, so I didn\u2019t dare say no.When I was looking at the scenery passing by for a while.\u201cYou must have something to tell me.\u201dHis voice echoed softly inside the carriage.Looking at the scenery of the passing streets, I answered indifferently.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me how I got the Rotunia tea. It\u2019s a trade secret.\u201dOutside, the sun was setting slowly before I knew it.\u201cI have no way to know. Whether it was your intention to deceive Reihausd.\u201dHis piercing eyes touched me.\u201cOr, with what intentions, Reihausd dared to play tricks on me.\u201dThere was a threatening force in his voice.\u201cIf it is true that you\u2019re a fake saintess, even that.\u201d\u201cWhether I\u2019m fake or real, the important thing is that I have been helping Your Highness from the beginning to the present.\u201dI shrugged and answered him.Some of the major reasons they made Ariel the fake saintess were that she was stupid and incapable of betraying, and that she had no family to come and go with.And because the priestesses may one day risk confessing the secret because of their special devotion.Ariel wasn\u2019t a conscientious, pious, and unparalleled person.However, now no one sees me as the Ariel I used to be.I looked at him while maintaining my composure and said in a clear voice.\u201cI\u2019ll never bite you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dHe twisted his lips bitterly at my words, which were claiming that I was harmless. There was a deep curiosity in her red eyes.\u201cAre you asking me to believe you?\u201dI kept my composure and smiled lightly, like a joke.\u201cYour Highness is free to say what you think of me, but it isn\u2019t beneficial to have a clear enemy and focus on other things.\u201dThen he looked out the window again.\u2018Today\u2019s performance seems to have unintentionally drawn Kyle\u2019s interest.\u2019The carriage entered the temple.As I was about to get down with him sitting crooked behind me, his low voice rang in my ear.\u201cAriel.\u201dI paused and turned around, and he grabbed my wrist.His eyes, burning redder than the sunset, fluttered right in front of me. He suddenly came up to me and bowed his torso towards me.\u201cThe offer to come to the Imperial Palace isn\u2019t valid from today, but I plan to find you often.\u201dI stared at him with awkward eyes.No\u2026 Why?\u201cWhether you\u2019re fake or real.\u201dI stared at his shadow on the floor. A low voice pierces my ears.\u201cNow it\u2019s clear that we have the same enemy.\u201dThe thought of the Empress\u2019s ferocious countenance made my mind complicated at the thought that this wouldn\u2019t end here.\u201cTo be honest, this is because of you. You wanted to live quietly, yet.\u201dKyle whispered to me, who spoke like a grimace.\u201cYou\u2019re shameless. If you wanted to live a quiet life, you should\u2019ve rejected the High Priest\u2019s offer in the first place.\u201dI didn\u2019t accept the offer, but I had nothing to say.\u201cWhoever you are, know one thing.\u201dHis intense red eyes were staring at me.His lips twitched again.\u201cAll the lives of those in the same boat with me are mine.\u201dThere was an arrogant confidence in his voice.\u201cNo one dares to harm my person without my permission.\u201dPerhaps because I was surprised by the sudden approach in his eyes, my heart was racing, and my head was complicated.It\u2019s \u2018my person\u2019.I must have entered Kyle\u2019s boundary with this incident.I said, avoiding my gaze.\u201cEven if Your Highness doesn\u2019t protect me, I can protect my body well. So you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dIt was fortunate that I was recognized as a \u2018friend\u2019, but I didn\u2019t want to shorten my life by getting closer.\u201cYou know it\u2019s too late to draw a line.\u201dHe stared at me for a long time with his blazing red eyes.\u201cBesides, do you know that that attitude excites me even more?\u201dHow should I answer that?I avoided his gaze and kept my mouth shut.After a while, he immediately opened the door of the carriage.\u201cI\u2019ll get to the temple soon.\u201dI turned and walked out of the carriage, then Dwayne closed the door of the carriage again.After a while, I took a step forward. Unintentionally, my peaceful daily life was getting more and more cracked.\u201cSaintess, what should I do with these treasures?\u201dDwayne asked me, looking at the treasure chests in the carriage that followed.\u201cHis Imperial Majesty gave them to me personally.\u201dIf I sell it, it will be well over 10,000 franc.\u201cPlease move them to my room.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe sunset was getting darker and dusky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However\u2026\u201dThere was definitely something to be done.\u201cI\u2019m not real. It was just a trick.\u201dAt my words that only he could hear, he looked at me for a long time and then opened his mouth.\u201cBring it, Sir Dwayne.\u201dSir Dwayne suddenly appeared from somewhere in the dark. In his hand was the Holy Sphere the size of an ostrich egg, and he handed it to Reihausd.\u201cDrive away people around us. And Sir, too, please leave your place.\u201dDwayne glanced at the sword handle on Reihausd\u2019s waist, answered.\u201cI will take the order.\u201dMoments later, Reihausd lightly tapped one of the chalice cups displayed in the corridor with his hand.It rolled down to the floor with a sharp sound. Yet he didn\u2019t care and placed the Holy Sphere in its place.The Holy Sphere, which was transparent in Dwayne\u2019s hand, turned blue when Reihausd touched it, and then changed to transparent again when his hand fell.\u201cWe, had something we were going to do last time. Do you remember, Saintess?\u201dHis gaze was towards me.I cautiously stepped out. And one step at a time, I got closer to it.Reihausd was looking at me.I quietly raised my hand. And before touching the Holy Sphere, I looked back at him and asked.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a saintess?\u201dHis eyebrows moved slightly. He didn\u2019t say anything, but I could tell he was suspicious.I stretched out my hand further and placed it on the Holy Sphere.The smooth, cold feeling of the surface was felt through the palm of my hand. And as the inside of the transparent Holy Sphere started to oscillate, it changed into various colors like paint spreading.After a while, when it cleared up again, Reihausd stared at the Holy Sphere for a long time in disbelief.For a long time, a heavy silence fell in the corridor.I looked at him with tense eyes.\u201cHoly power\u2026\u201dReihausd\u2019s lips twitched.Then, in a slow motion, he turned his gaze to me. He had a hard face whose thoughts I had no idea.\u201c\u2026you have none.\u201dEyes that seem to be full of despair and doubt.With a calm expression on my face, I removed my hand from the Holy Sphere. Even though my body was still stiff with tension.The window in front of me was still glimmering.[You purchased the Holy Relic \u2018Pendant of Sealing\u2019.]Although I failed to sell the White Rotunia, I was able to purchase the holy relic \u2018Pendant of Sealing\u2019 at the shop, having received a gift including gold coins from the Emperor.At a whopping 4,000 franc, this pendant had only one effect.When worn, it seals abilities such as holy power, divine power, and mana within the body.And with a certain probability, it cancels out external attacks of holy power, divine power, or mana.Inside, there were \u2018Sealing Holy Stone\u2019 and \u2018Sealing Magic Stone\u2019, which can be used separately.The price of this holy relic, which was supposed to be used when sealing the final Demon King, was really evil, but I had no choice. It was unfair to spend a lot of blood and sweat to prevent a major twist of the original story, though.I wore the pendant as soon as I bought it.\u201cIs it confirmed now?\u201dReihausd stared at me without answering my words.I bowed my head slightly to greet him and turned around.Then his voice was heard.\u201cIn the Imperial Palace\u2026 Did you meet Prince Kyle?\u201dI stopped and answered without looking back at him.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSomeday\u2026\u201dHis voice was low.\u201cAre you thinking of going to him?\u201dI paused for a moment and then looked back at him.His dark golden eyes harbored a dazzling light.\u201cSir Reihausd.\u201dIn the original story, he was never such a character.\u201cI think it\u2019s a little\u2026 too much for me. But thank you for your kindness every time.\u201dI decided to express it openly to him.A long silence passed between us, and Reihausd opened his mouth.\u201cI thought it couldn\u2019t be.\u201dA cold darkness suddenly appeared in his eyes.\u201cBecause Ariel is just a fake saintess.\u201dHe took a step towards me and put his hand on my shoulder.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you leave the temple.\u201dA heavy feeling weighed down on me.\u201cBut since when was it?\u201dHis dangerous voice rang in my ears.\u201cIt felt unpleasant.\u201dThe moment I heard that voice, I froze.\u201cI\u2019m talking about myself.\u201dI thought that maybe he was bringing up a story that shouldn\u2019t be brought up.He licked his red lips.\u201cIt was a body that only responded to prayers to the Gods.\u201d\u2026Does your body only respond when you think of the Gods?It was the moment when I realized that there are 50,000 different sexual orientations in the world, but this guy is a real madman.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, is satisfied with his habit.][The God of Art, Mond, rejoices in his prayers.]Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s praying\u2026I paused at the strange thought that came to my mind. But my thoughts stopped at his next words.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, but I thought you might be one of the two.\u201dNot even a human White Rotunia, he must have felt me differently with his five senses.\u201cIt\u2019s either the Gods.\u201dHis hand rested on my shoulder and lightly brushed my hair.\u201cOr the Saintess.\u201dI could see my twinkling eyes in his gold eyes.Surprisingly, his reasoning was 100% consistent.\u201cBut that can\u2019t be true. You, who used to be a fake saintess, suddenly became real\u2026\u201dHe lifted his hand and shook his head with a bitter smile. And he looked at me as he continued\u201cI would just assume that this peculiar, profane disposition has been cured.\u201dIt was a phrase that left out the phrase,\u00a0\u201cI react to an ordinary human woman.\u201d\u00a0And, heartbreakingly, he was still a beautiful pervert.\u201cThat\u2019s why, you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems to be something special.\u201dFor a moment I hesitated to confess to him that I had sacred power.But I knew it was an unanswered question.Even if I don\u2019t have holy power, I will overcome my peculiar inclinations and become an exceptionally attractive woman, and if I have it, the reason why he\u2019s attracted to me will be justified.\u201cSir Reihausd. So this is\u2026\u201dI rotated my brain to find the right word.\u201cThe balloon effect caused by the craving for a real saintess is something like this. As you suppressed my cravings, you burst into the wrong place.\u201dAt my words, Reihausd moved his eyebrows.\u201cWhen the real saintess appears, you will fall in love so much that you will completely forget about me. I\u2019m not special at all.\u201dMy favorite scene in The Return of the Saintess Camilla was when Reihausd kissed Camilla\u2019s foot, who was sleeping exhausted.With a presence like a goddess, he couldn\u2019t even get close to his beloved, but his pure and sorrowful heart, approaching her feet and kissing her.I liked that part quite a bit.Even though he has the face of an obsessive, exhausted man now, I never doubted that he could change.\u201cAriel.\u201dHe smiled softly.\u201cEvery time you say that, it hurts here.\u201dHis hand pointed to my heart.He was handsome enough for me to exclaim,\u00a0\u201cWow.\u201d\u00a0Isn\u2019t it against the law to make such an expression?I looked at him with a blank expression for a moment, then finally made up my mind and opened my mouth.\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to leave someday. Don\u2019t give me too much.\u201dIt was a bit cold, but it was sincere.It\u2019s a pity that Reihausd\u2019s relationship has ended like this, but I wished him happiness, and I was thinking of leaving this temple someday.\u201cAriel.\u201dI heard his voice, but I turned back and walked down the corridor.His dark gaze lingered on the back of my head.[The God of Art, Mond, condemns your coldness.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, praises you for being sharp.]The opposite reactions of the Gods were floating around in the chat window, but I continued walking, shifting my gaze to another place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A strange ominous feeling engulfed my head.As I turned to the corner, I saw the priests and priestesses were gathered.With a strange intuition, I went through them.\u201cS-Saintess!\u201dThe voices of the maids trembling around could be heard.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe presence of Dwayne, who appeared as perhaps he heard the commotion, was also felt from behind.I pushed out one of the priestesses in front of me, and my face hardened in surprise at the scene unfolding in front of me.My heart was beating like crazy.A memo saying,\u00a0\u201cI paid off today\u2019s debt,\u201d\u00a0was scattered on the floor. Then I saw Daisy who was dying from her severely wounded chest and stomach, dripping blood with every breath she took.There was blood pooling on the floor, and the maids and priestesses were weeping. Two of the priests tried to pour out their divine power, but it was too small an amount.Daisy opened her blood-drenched lips and clapped her mouth.\u201cP-Please be carefu\u2026\u201dWithout hesitation, I took off the pendant and placed my hand on Daisy\u2019s chest. At this moment, any kind of thoughts couldn\u2019t stop me.\u2018It hurts.\u2019It was an unforgettable pain.When I died in my last life, the moment when a sharp blade ripped through my body was an intense memory that made me shudder even while I was sleeping.And Daisy was lying in a mess like me that day.Tears like dew on the corners of her eyes made me lose my temper.Something deep inside my chest swelled up. A warm light formed on my hand that covered her chest, as her blood gushed out, and it wrapped around Daisy\u2019s body.[Even so, I still want to be with the Saintess!]Her words, which she said with her eyes shining, lingered in my ears.Perhaps I really thought of this kid as my real sister. Seeing her messed up looks so painful that my heart was ripped apart.\u2018Help me.\u2019I closed my eyes.All my nerves were focused on my hands.My palms were dripping with Daisy\u2019s lukewarm blood, and at the same time, something warm and powerful reached her from my skin.I felt like I was floating in space. Perhaps it was because of the ring I bought last time, the stigma didn\u2019t hurt painfully, and I felt a dull feeling.It was more comfortable to pour holy power at that moment than to heal the child of the Burglar\u2019s Guild. Perhaps it\u2019s because of my desperate heart that I feel that way relatively.\u2018You have to live. Daisy.\u2019I felt no more blood flowing out of her body.\u2018Just as you chose me, I also chose you.\u2019Daisy\u2019s body, which had been cold, had regained some warmth, but it was still not enough.I concentrated more divine power on my hands.Only the thought of living alone filled my mind. And at some point, suddenly, something stronger came out of my hand like an explosion.When it stopped, I quietly lifted my eyelids.There was no noise in my ears. Because no one was making a sound.\u201c\u2026\u201dDaisy was still lying in front of me, and her clothes were completely soaked in blood.However\u2026 Those black eyes were looking at me. As if she was waking up from a deep sleep, with eyes full of vitality.I took my hand from her chest and placed it on Daisy\u2019s cheek.Her white cheeks were messed with blood, but the warmth was felt in the palm of my hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dDaisy licked her bloody lips.\u201cSainteessss\u2026\u201dA slightly hoarse voice crept into my ear.Tears in the corners of her eyes fell to her ears as she lay down.Something boiled deep inside my chest. It was a storm of emotions, a mixture of joy, conquest, and relief.\u201cNine Gods.\u201d\u201cThe disciple of Elium witnessed a miracle.\u201d\u201cThe Saintess saved a priestess!\u201dAnd, startled by this scene, the priests and priestesses, who stood still as if they were dead rats, all shouted together. Among them, voices were heard muttering prayers in emotional voices.Usually, the divine power of ordinary priests couldn\u2019t save a person who was about to die like this. Even if the High Priest, Reihausd, ran right away, the outcome wouldn\u2019t have been guaranteed.They will surely gossip about witnessing the miracle of the Saintess from today.So\u2026 All my efforts to cover up so far are in vain.But even that wasn\u2019t disappointing.I grabbed Daisy\u2019s hand and lifted her up.Daisy gently grabbed my hand and got up from her seat, as if she was never dying.The cheers of the priests and priestesses grew louder.It was a festival-like atmosphere that suddenly changed, but I hardened my eyebrows and said to them.\u201cTell me what just happened.\u201dThen the atmosphere became quiet as if cold water had been poured, and a maid answered with a trembling voice.\u201cA man in black broke in and attacked Daisy.\u201d\u201cI think he was wearing a mask!\u201dAt that, Dwayne hurriedly rushed out.I could see the Paladins moving behind him.Is it an outside invasion?\u2018Somebody was breaking in from the outside, and towards Daisy.\u2019It was more likely that they had a grudge against me rather than Daisy.But as soon as I thought that no one has a reason to live with a grudge against me, an ugly face came to my mind. His hands, which were clinging on his cheek, were also included.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dHe must have thought that killing the priestess who followed me was just a warning.That damn bastard who sees human life is worth a feather.I was burning my will, saying,\u00a0\u201cIt seems that he didn\u2019t understand it with his cheeks, so he will be completely uprooted.\u201d\u00a0when suddenly, a voice that shouldn\u2019t be heard came from behind.\u201cAriel.\u201dIt was only then that I realized that I had publicly saved Daisy and there was no way to escape.Turning stiffly, Reihausd was standing there.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was absurd to show that I saved Daisy in front of the public after deceiving the Holy Sphere at best.When the High Priest appeared, the atmosphere of everyone became solemn.Even Daisy, who was resurrected from the dead, politely put her hands together in an unusual energy.\u201cWell. That\u2026\u201dI opened my lips, feeling burdened by his eyes pouring towards me. I couldn\u2019t come up with any excuses to make.At that moment, suddenly he got down on one knee and the other knee too.I looked at him in surprise.He lowered his head further and placed his hand on one of my sandals.There was a subtle sensation as his cold touch touched the delicate skin of my feet.He bowed his head.I stood there, not knowing what to do.Reihausd lowered his head deeply and kissed the top of my foot. A tickling sensation rose through my heart as his soft lips touched.My cheeks were burning and my heart was pounding.As he kissed the top of my foot, lifted his lips and slowly raised his back, his blonde hair moved softly.The golden eyes looking up at me had a strange light.It would be embarrassing to get down on his knees and kiss a woman\u2019s feet while his subordinates were watching, but he didn\u2019t seem to care about that.There were light arcs on the corners of his red lips.\u201cThis twist is also welcomed.\u201dHis red lips twitched, and a soft, barely audible voice flowed out.\u201cI was surprised.\u201dI told him, hiding my restlessness and pretending to be calm.\u201cPlease get up.\u201dHe slowly got up.A handsome face was located far above me as he stood.I turned to Daisy without trying to look up at him.\u201cThe thing that just happened\u2026\u201dHis low voice was heard from behind.\u201cWe will investigate it thoroughly.\u201dIt was difficult for me to tell whether the \u2018thing\u2019 he was talking about was that I deceived the Holy Sphere or that Daisy had suffered.However, I didn\u2019t ask and replied with the most comfortable answer.\u201c\u2026Please take care of it.\u201dAfter that, after standing still for a while, I said to Daisy, who was standing stiffly.\u201cYou should take a bath first. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThen, leaving Reihausd and the priests intact, I turned and walked into the hallway.I was tired enough to stagger my legs and was in bad shape, but I gave strength to my stride and walked. Daisy, once wrung out to keep blood from dripping from her clothes, often followed me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s too much!\u201dAt the text that appeared in the chat window, I hurriedly made an X with my hand.But I knew it was already too late.[The God of Love, Odyssey, expresses his disappointment in you.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is trying to memorize a blessing spell, but he looks at you.]\u201cDon\u2019t waste your blessing\u2026 no, your power.\u201dI said a word to the Gods who wish to bestow unnecessary blessings.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, looks at you.]\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, looks at you.]I let out a small sigh.\u201cAlright. Do it.\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, blesses you.]In my body, there was a tiger energy that wasn\u2019t suitable for the rest of the night that had finally come.In the end, after receiving even Ciel\u2019s blessing, I lay down on the bed.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhile thinking of non-nutritive things such as, if I have a bad dream while sleeping, my bed might break.I lay on the bed and stared at the high ceiling.\u2018Around now, Daisy must be washing up hard, right.\u2019I\u2019ve been through a lot today. Didn\u2019t I go to the Imperial Palace and have a fight with Alberto?\u2018Well, it ended with my victory\u2026\u2019Coming back to the temple, someone attacked Daisy.When I think of Daisy, who is still dying, my heart raced.\u2018If she had died\u2026\u2019What I had planned before was unforgivable, but attacking people around me was even more unforgivable.\u201cYou touched the wrong person. Empress.\u201dThere is a saying that the best defense is attack.I didn\u2019t mean to match the beat of someone who meant to mess up my life. And\u2026\u201cUgh\u2026 \u201cThe moment Reihausd\u2019s eyes came to mind, I pulled up the blanket to my face.Now that Thiago\u2019s fake has been revealed with this hand, and I have proven my power in front of everyone, what will happen to me?The next day, I kicked Dwayne out of town, borrowed Daisy\u2019s clothes, and went out into town.It wasn\u2019t for any particular purpose, it was because I didn\u2019t have the confidence to face Reyhaas again right away.I made a request for Daisy.[Tell them I can\u2019t leave my room because I\u2019m sick.]There were street artists playing upbeat music on the street, and there were girls selling fruit.Yes, let\u2019s do some healing while we\u2019re out.As it was the capital of the Empire, there were also people from various countries in various clothes. And the animals I see for the first time.Wearing Daisy\u2019s casual trousers, a neat shirt, and a hat I bought from a kiosk to cover my face, I looked around and found a sign saying \u2018Hegen Building Agency\u2019.I found it, real estate!\u2018My dream! An escape from reality!\u2019I got excited while opening the door and went in.Contrary to what I expected, the inside was like a cafe.Presumably a popular place, ladies in dresses were sitting at the table, and a man with a mustache was eagerly explaining something in front of the ladies.A boy who appeared to be an assistant came out to me.\u201cWelcome to Hegen Building Agency.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cFor what purpose did you come?\u201dI coughed once and then answered naturally.\u201cI came to see a building. It\u2019s a building where I can do things like a flower shop on the first floor and live upstairs. Well, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to buy it right now, but\u2026\u201dWhen I finished my words, the man with a mustache, who was sitting in front of the ladies, turned to me. Then he gestured to the boy.The boy said to me with a puzzled expression.\u201cDid you know the prices of buildings?\u201dI answered.\u201cNo.\u201dAs soon as I finished speaking, the man with a mustache stood up.There was something wrong with his expression.\u201cWe don\u2019t trade in buildings over District 10, so I want you to leave.\u201dAt his words, some of the nobles smiled softly.\u2018It\u2019s District 10.\u2019I\u2019ve definitely heard of it.The capital is divided into 15 districts, with nobles and wealthy people living in District 1 to 3, commoners living in District 4 to 10,I lowered my head a little to see how I dressed.Since I borrowed pants from Daisy, I wasn\u2019t seen as an aristocratic girl.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot. Well, there are customers who come to waste other people\u2019s time on things that don\u2019t have any promises, saying they\u2019ll save money someday to buy a building\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bad idea to call it a building over District 10?\u201d\u201cHoho, the Viscountess\u2019 words are so funny.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. There isn\u2019t any building in District 10 or higher. Hahaha!\u201dThe ladies glanced at me and talked.Those ladies who feel like they\u2019re speculating in real estate are probably the VIPs of this agency, but it made me feel hidden well when I\u2019m being ignored overtly in this outfit.\u201cOh my, ladies. I think what you just said is a little\u2026 rude.\u201dAnd instead of me, I heard a voice pointing out their rudeness.The main character was the youngest-looking woman among the ladies. She was probably in her late twenties, a woman with auburn hair.But is there any conceptual person among them, I wonder.\u201cAh, Countess Yurit.\u201dSeeing that they were all immersed in the words of the woman, the youngest woman seemed to have the strongest influence.The woman called the Countess said in a soft voice.\u201cShe might be a servant who runs an errand for a certain house. She came here because her master asked her to find out about the building, and if she was rudely kicked out in this way\u2026\u201dHaa, it\u2019s getting more and more spectacular.\u201cWhat can a servant see that the noble sends her on errands?\u201dWhen the real estate owner tried to help, other ladies noticed the man.Then the real estate owner stopped talking.\u201cThe Countess is really thoughtful.\u201dThe ladies praised the Countess.\u201cAs expected, the Countess is very merciful to her.\u201d\u201cThis time, you registered a divine in the Temple of Elium, right.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just a literal rudeness.Predict the circumstances of others and sympathize with them. Do these nobles know that all such things are rude?\u201cWhat are you doing, not taking the guest in? Now I\u2019m talking about something important!\u201dThe man with a mustache rattled and smiled at the Countess, then he suddenly yelled at the boy from before.Hm, what should I do with these people?And then the door opened and someone else came in.I had my back against the door, so I couldn\u2019t see who was coming in, but I could see the ladies who glanced around the door, looking surprised.It was the same with the man with a mustache.\u201cOh my! How long has it been, Marquis!\u201dThe man jumped up and bowed his head upright.I furrowed my eyebrows and looked back.There stood a face I knew well.\u2018Cass Lloyd.\u2019Black hair with pomade bangs and a neat outfit. It was a stark contrast to my outfit with dirt stains.\u201cHurry up and get her out of here!\u201dThe man with a mustache spoke in a low voice to the boy who appeared to be his assistant.Then Cass opened his mouth.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dAt that, the man with a mustache looked at him with his puzzled eyes.Cass lifted my hand and kissed me gently on the back of my hand. I could feel the ladies making surprised faces.\u201cLord Marquis\u2026\u201dCass slowly raised his gaze down and met my eyes. His dark blue eyes were strangely sweet.\u201cIt must have been that you had brought salvation to the poor in the most humble part of the city.\u201dHe raised his hand and grabbed my hat. Bright blonde hair was revealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI stared at him with bewildered eyes.After a moment of silence, the Countess opened her mouth.\u201cMarquis Lloyd. Why are you suddenly saying that all of a sudden\u2026\u201d\u201cHegen, where are you wearing your eyes, I wonder.\u201dCass, with his cool expression, spoke straight to him.\u201cYou\u2019re not a believer who doesn\u2019t even recognize the Saintess\u2019 face, are you?\u201dThey quickly found out that I was the Saintess.\u201cGa\u2026 sp? Saintess?\u201dThe man with a mustache looked as if his eyes were about to fall out of it at any moment.I let out a small sigh.The poor customer was neglected at the department store, but she turned out to be the president\u2019s daughter. Is it the feeling of this reversal drama?They also will know.Cass Lloyd isn\u2019t the type of person who likes to joke.\u201cYou seem to have stopped by to find a building for the temple relief project\u2026\u201dCass said, looking into my eyes.\u201cDid Hegen introduce you to a good building?\u201dBut he spoke his words well as if he had put oil on his mouth. With a chic face that doesn\u2019t seem to be flexible.\u201cNo.\u201dI answered with a prickly face.Hegen\u2019s eyes widened when he heard that it was a temple relief project.Elium is the largest temple in the capital, and there are rumors that the assets of the temple are similar to those of the Imperial Palace.If Hegen made the temple a customer, this would be a huge opportunity.\u201cThey say there\u2019s no building. I need to go to another agency.\u201dHegen\u2019s lips trembled at my words.\u201cN-No. That\u2019s not it\u2026 ! S-Saintess!\u201dIt was a little funny to see him trembling in embarrassment because of the words I had spit out.I looked at Hegen with pitiful eyes, and the ladies glanced at him too. The Countess\u2019 face was red. The other ladies were also so startled that they couldn\u2019t even make eye contact and were shaking their hands.\u201cS-Saintess!\u201dHegen knelt down in front of me.\u201cHow dare these dead eyes dare not to know the Saintess\u2026!\u201dThe triangular-shaped eyes that had been raised were lost and trembling.\u201cOh my, why? You said you didn\u2019t deal with buildings in Area 10.\u201dI could have sent it nicely, but I tend to have a grudge.\u201cAh, if I tell the High Priest about today\u2019s event, he might make good use of it in the Mass. The temple relief project is experiencing these difficulties.\u201dHegen\u2019s face turned dark. Perhaps, when the believers find out about this, the Hegen agency will receive a great deal of protest or scorn.\u201cSaintess, please forgive me!\u201d\u201cAre you even asking for forgiveness for saying that there is no building? And\u2026\u201dI said looking at the ladies\u2019 gang.\u201cI need to review the eligibility criteria for the divine of Elium. As you know, there are a lot of nobles who want to become saints, but there are a lot of people with personalities that are not suitable for being a saint in Elium, so we\u2019re struggling with various problems.\u201dThe ladies\u2019 faces turned pale.Becoming a member of Elium means becoming the mainstream noble of the Empire, because what was stamped on a saint was the door to the mainstream nobility.The news that the Ragefield family had been expelled not long ago was no longer a secret.\u201cS-Saintess\u2026\u201d\u201cSaintess. I apologize.\u201dAll the ladies shouted in a panicked voice, but I turned around.At that moment, Cass\u2019 voice was heard.\u201cWould you like to leave?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI answered, grabbing his outstretched hand for the escort.But he stopped while trying to escort me.\u201cAh, but I think we need to stop at the merchant for a while. For today\u2019s relief project, I have left a relief fund of 5,000 franc to deliver to Saintess.Hm, what else is this about?I looked at Cas with puzzled eyes.A faint smile could be seen on his lips. Then I heard Hegen\u2019s voice from behind.\u201cS-Saintess! I will give it to you now.\u201d\u201cMe too, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cSaintess, I will donate for my family as well.\u201dHegen and the ladies were rummaging through their bags.Cass, perhaps\u2026\u201cPlease take it. It\u2019s a small, sincere thing, but please.\u201dAnd they brought me more than 5,000 franc.This is what it meant to say,\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re going to sympathize, give it to me with money,\u201d\u00a0and I pretended to be worried while holding back the smile that popped out around my mouth\u201cPlease use it for the relief project and may Elium forget our blasphemy.\u201dThe unexpected collection made my dark mood well up.It was sad that the 4,000-franc holy relic called the \u2018Pendant of the Seal\u2019, which had left the All-Purpose Pocket empty, was useless, but this collection made my money full.[Your Money: 6,700 franc]I think I\u2019m going to be rich soon, though?***\u201cHegen seemed to be looking forward to the temple relief project.\u201dAs soon as I left the store, Cass raised the corner of his lips and spoke to me.\u201cYes.\u201dI replied insignificantly, remembering Hegen, who had been crouching the whole time and watching me.\u201cThe Saintess didn\u2019t say that you would entrust the business to him. And it\u2019s the money that you got by poking out my feet, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cWell. If the Marquis said so.\u201dI said with a smile.In any case, this money was to be spent on self-help, anyway.\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to take it all by myself, can I give you 10 percent of it?\u201dCass chuckled and gave a cool grin.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dHe\u2019d know that I\u2019m saving money after I sold stuff to Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.\u201cBut since when have you been watching me?\u201dPerhaps it was no coincidence that he stopped by the Hegen Agency.From the moment he saw my unrecognizable back, he knew it was me.\u201cI found you coming out of the temple.\u201dBut his answer was much earlier than I thought.\u201cYes?\u201dI was surprised and asked him.A gust of wind blew and scattered my black hair.\u201cYour face looked complicated. The voices of the priests praising the Saintess were noisy, and that is probably the reason.\u201dCass looked at me and said.I said,\u00a0\u201cAh,\u201d\u00a0while putting my hair behind my ear.\u201cYou heard the news.\u201dA slight smile crept across Cass\u2019 lips.\u201cVery intense power. The priests must be excited because they witnessed such a pure strength that can\u2019t be compared with divine power.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dAt those words, I was deeply embarrassed.\u201cThen it must have been that the Saintess healed my Blue Wing as well.\u201dCass said with a smirk.Those words reminded me of one day. The dying blue bird and the moment I brought it back to life for the first time with the use of divine power, I will probably never forget it for the rest of my life.But at the time, I said no, so he had nothing to say.\u201cI guessed a little.\u201d He turned his gaze to look at the others and continued. \u201cBecause your eyes, which were telling me not to throw it away, but rather kill it, showed a deep contempt for me.\u201dHis dark blue eyes had a monotonous glow.\u201cAs if you saw the condition of the abandoned bird yourself.\u201dI suddenly got curious and asked.\u201cHow is the Blue Wing doing?\u201d\u201cYes. Obviously. The dogs have been retrained not to dare to bite their owners.\u201dThat\u2019s a relief.Then his voice was heard again.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you wanted to hide your divine power?\u201dDivine power.Those two words from his mouth stabbed me in the chest.Obviously, it was like that. I tried to hide my power from both Reihausd and Cass. Because I had to be a fake saintess.And I thought it was good to leave the temple so as not to have a tragic ending like the original story.But since yesterday it has become impossible. Maybe it has been like that since the oracle opened.There was a slight curiosity in his dark blue eyes.\u201cIs that child worthy enough for you to give up your efforts?\u201d Cass asked me with a look as if he didn\u2019t understand.The small smile on his lips was of a primitive kind, aroused solely by interest, like the laughter of a baby who knew no good or evil.\u201cWorth it. It\u2019s a little bitter.\u201dJust because I had divine power, that didn\u2019t mean I could save everyone.\u201cLet it be. And\u2026\u201dI lifted my head, looked straight at Cass, and opened my mouth.\u201cEven if it was someone other than Daisy who was there, if I had the power to save them, I would save them.\u201dIn my past life, I wasn\u2019t a good person who helped others with a warm heart.Of course, I still don\u2019t intend to live like that now.But in a desperate situation where someone\u2019s life was at stake, I had only one choice. Help as best I can. That was all I knew.\u201cEven if it was the Marquis.\u201dIt\u2019s a trivial thing, but I added unnecessary words.Suddenly, a subtle light flashed in his dark blue eyes.After a while he opened his mouth.Cass stared at me for a long time.\u201cYou\u2019re speaking like a saintess.\u201dPerhaps all that matters to him are numbers and scales.Perhaps, in his eyes, I may look strange because I chose the lighter side of the tilted scale.I answered casually.\u201cI don\u2019t know what it means to be a saintess, but I just\u2026 It\u2019s just an act for me.\u201dIf I had watched that child die to hide my divine power, I would have suffered from a sense of loss and nightmares.So saving Daisy was also for me.\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s the way I feel comfortable.\u201dHis gaze suddenly seemed to deepen. Soon, an unexpected smile appeared on his lips.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that your scale is different from mine.\u201dIt could be expressed that way.I looked at him and nodded my head.He smiled brightly at my resolute response. Then he asked me.\u201cToday, do you have more time? Shall we go on a date?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this rate, I\u2019ll eat all of this.\u201dAs expected, it tastes much better than the cake I ate at the temple, whether it\u2019s the truth or not. I\u2019m saying that the tea also tastes good.\u201cYou must have been hungry.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ve eaten, though\u2026\u201d I said as I poked the corner of the piece of cake with my fork. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone have a separate stomach for meals and dessert?\u201dThe sweet cake raised my mood to the highest level of tension.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a sin not to eat this.\u201dAnd I glanced at Cass, who was sitting still without eating.\u201cInstead of 10 percent, I want to have a cup of tea with the Saintess.\u201dAren\u2019t you shivering after saying that kind of thing?\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be in such a good mood so soon.\u201dSeeing him just staring at me while I ate deliciously, I felt like a happy pig alone, so I picked up his fork.\u201cYou said it was a sin. Marquis.\u201dThen I took a piece of cake and gave it to him.\u201cOr are you waiting for me to feed you?\u201dOf course, what I just said was a joke.A faint smile seemed to pass across his lips.Unlike his usual artificial laughter, it\u2019s very natural\u2026?He took my fork and licked his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen other people eat food with such a keen eye.\u201dHis words made my cheeks warm.Did I eat too much? However, it was enough to be formal in the temple, so I didn\u2019t want to pretend to be a Lady until I came out to play in this free outfit.Cass looked at my red cheeks and asked.\u201cAh, is it rude to say that?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s very rude.\u201dI reached out and pushed the fork in his hand. The cake touched his lips.\u201cHurry up.\u201dHe looked at me and smiled again and put the cake in his mouth.The movement of his lips eating the cake, I looked at it blankly for a moment, then I turned my gaze away.Cass\u2019 lips were red as if they were painted. Even though it\u2019s a man\u2019s lips, I think it\u2019s prettier than mine.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s delicious.\u201dHis voice was heard.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, right?\u201d\u201cMany times more than what I ate a few days ago.\u201dDid they even upgrade their toppings in just a few days? I tilted my head.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, drools.][The God of Art, Mond, is looking for a cake recipe.]Yeah, they can\u2019t stand eating shows.He ate all the cake I had served, and asked me after a while.\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you want to know about me?\u201dAfter sipping my tea, I put down my glass and made eye contact with him.\u201cWhether I have something to say\u2026\u201dThose dark blue eyes.What was in those eyes, was it a favor or curiosity, or was it neither?[The God of Benevolence, Oman, wonders what his bed tastes like.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, moves his gaze to that man\u2019s pants.]Perhaps the reason I sometimes have strange thoughts is because of these two Gods.\u201cWell. There isn\u2019t anyt\u2026\u201dNo, it seems like there is?\u201cAh, there is!\u201dIn an instant, a word came to mind.He raised his eyebrows as if he was asking a question, and I opened my mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll pay this for you.\u201dThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking since I came here.\u201cI should buy you this much. With how much money I made.\u201dCass looked at me for a while at my words and then turned his head to the side.There was a smile on his lips.He looked like he was holding back his laughter, and after a while he looked at me and nodded his head.\u201cI always expect nothing from you.\u201dI shrugged at those words that seemed like a joke.\u201cAh. So you wanted to hear this.\u201dLooking into his eyes, I said over and over again.\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll buy you a more expensive one.\u201dThen he smirked and covered his mouth.Was Cass a character who smiled so well since the beginning, or was he a sociopath in the original story?He looked at me happily, as if I was a smile button.No matter what happens in the future, it\u2019s not bad maintaining a good relationship with the male leads as it will reduce the risk to me as well.\u201cI have something to order.\u201dI turned around and called the clerk to order another cake.I found my favorite cake for the first time in a while, I can\u2019t go back like this.\u201cYou seem to have eaten a lot now. Will you have another one?\u201dI answered Cass\u2019 words.\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to bring it to Daisy.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Daisy\u2026\u201dCass clouded the end of his words, as if he was guessing.\u201cShe likes sweet things. She will like it.\u201dIt felt good to think that Daisy would be happy to see the cake.I said with a wide smile.Cass looked at me silently for a long time. And he licked his lips as if he wanted to be heard.\u201c\u2026As expected, I\u2019m jealous too.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dConcentrating on eating the cake, I didn\u2019t understand well, so I asked the question with a puzzled look, but he didn\u2019t answer again.\u2018What is it?\u2019I didn\u2019t really ask again.***Clink.When the glass vase fell to the floor, it shattered and scattered.Alberto was avoiding his gaze with a firm expression, and Rose\u2019s lips, standing with her back to the window, were trembling.Ros\u00e9\u2019s eyes full of poison were filled with criticism and fixed on Alberto. She licked her red lips and let out a sound mixed with rough breathing.\u201cHow the hell are you doing your job?!\u201dAlberto turned his eyes and opened his mouth.\u201cObviously, a girl named Annie said she was a stupid fake saintess\u2026\u201d\u201cYou think that red fox is stupid?\u201dRos\u00e9\u2019s eyes were brimming with life.\u201cWhat nonsense! She knew for sure that the kid from Thiago was fake!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dAlberto said after a moment, his eyes wide open, as if he had remembered something.\u201cYou\u2019re right! I think she used that maid on purpose to get us into her trap!\u201dAlberto grinded his teeth, recalling the humiliating memory of being slapped on the cheek by the Saintess.\u201cTrap?\u201dAt Ros\u00e9\u2019s question, Alberto nodded his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t she close with Prince Kyle!\u201dAlberto\u2019s fist slammed the table.\u201cIt was clear from the beginning that the two of them were working together and were trying to deceive me.\u201d\u201cYou fell for it!\u201dRos\u00e9\u2019s angry voice criticized Alberto.\u201cPerhaps the Saintess has some kind of relationship with Prince Kyle. Before this, whenI installed explosives on the statue to ruin his birthday banquet, didn\u2019t she cover the Crown Prince with blatant lies? After getting rid of Annie, she showed her true colors.\u201dShe could well have been talking about what the Gods said. Last night, Alberto grinded his teeth more than a hundred times, saying he wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.\u201cThe Emperor was also angry with me. He didn\u2019t even look for me this morning!\u201dShe was furious as she put her hand on her slender belly that hadn\u2019t come out.Ever since her pregnancy was announced, every morning the Emperor put his hand on her stomach and went out reciting her favorite verses and songs.But today, even the Emperor\u2019s shadow didn\u2019t enter this room.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty the Empress.\u201dAlberto walked over to her, avoiding the broken glass. And he looked into the eyes that resembled his and said with scorching eyes.\u201cThere won\u2019t be two failures.\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201dRos\u00e9 stared at him coldly.\u201cShe\u2019s the Saintess, but after all a human\u2019s body is weak.\u201dAt Alberto\u2019s words, Ros\u00e9 furrowed her eyebrows.\u201cHow about inviting the Saintess to the Imperial Hunting Festival in 10 days?\u201d\u201cThe Imperial Hunting Festival? Will the Saintess come? To cure the monsters that are hunted? Ha.\u201dRos\u00e9 frowned as if it wasn\u2019t worth hearing, but Alberto continued.\u201cThe Imperial Hunting Festival originated from Hetuse, the God of Justice, and it\u2019s a festival that began with the blessing of the Temple of Ellium from generation to generation. It\u2019s nothing the Saintess can\u2019t participate in.\u201dIn front of a powerful sword, her body is nothing.\u2018There\u2019s no way the Saintess can use force\u2026\u2019The plan will have to be made up gradually, but Alberto\u2019s eyes already shone with anticipation.It\u2019s a saintess hunt, what a wonderful plan.\u201cI will create public opinion in nobility society. They\u2019re going to complain that she has neglected her duties as a saintess until now. So that Elium has no choice but to be concerned.\u201dEven so, the man who was sent to kill the Saintess\u2019 right hand couldn\u2019t even do that and returned in a wreck then was secretly disposed of.\u201cThis time, we\u2019ll have to plan for sure.\u201d\u201cIf possible, we\u2019ll make sure that Prince Kyle can also be sent. Conflict over politics, isn\u2019t it a good topic?\u201dRos\u00e9\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly.\u201cAlright. The Empress sends her an invitation\u2026\u201dAlberto\u2019s gaze reached Ros\u00e9\u2019s stomach.\u201cPlease pay attention to the prenatal care.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you really have to say that?\u201dMy face has been burning since morning. Daisy added fuel to my shame with her blunt words.This was all because of Ciel\u2019s blessing.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, loves your passion.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, blushes as he recalls the broken bed.]\u201cBe quiet.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, not you.\u201dI had a dream last nightI was walking through the forest on horseback, and all of a sudden, bad guys in black appeared and pointed their swords at me.I blocked the sword with my hand, and as soon as it touched my hand, it shattered with the mighty blessing of destruction. Then I beat them up with my bare hands.\u2018Well, they passed out just after I touched them with my hands so it doesn\u2019t matter, but\u2026\u2019Perhaps I was really concentrating on my hands while I was sleeping.When I woke up in the morning, one side of the bed was lying down and the other had a big hole in it.\u201cSaintess. If you toss and turn a little, it might get smashed. Don\u2019t be too shy.\u201dAt my sigh, she smiled brightly. Her body was fine as if nothing had happened two days ago.\u201cHave a meal. The hot soup is getting cold.\u201dI got up and sat Daisy down.\u201cSit down for a second.\u201d\u201cSaintess?\u201dDaisy asked as she sat down with a puzzled look.\u201cYou died and got revived. Do you have to come out and make me uncomfortable because I told you to take a rest until today?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve really gotten better. The Saintess healed me. You also bought me a delicious strawberry mousse cake yesterday.\u201d\u201cEnough. I\u2019ll give you special treatment today, so don\u2019t say no.\u201dI grunted as I held the spoon in Daisy\u2019s hand.Her complexion was as good as if the raid had never occurred, yet I couldn\u2019t help but worry.The surprised Daisy asked as I scooped up the spoon.\u201cWould you like to go for a morning walk in a little while?\u201dAt Daisy\u2019s question, I nodded my head. I\u2019m a bit disturbed, and I\u2019ll have to get some fresh air in the morning.There was a problem I faced apart from what Daisy had been throughI was discovered to have had holy powers, and now I\u2019m treated like a real saintess.The plan of escaping and becoming independent before Camilla appeared was based on the premise that I was a fake saintess who was indifferent to men.Because if a fake saintess vacates the temple, Reihausd won\u2019t search the country for me like a mouse.But now that I\u2019m the only saintess in the Empire, he will probably send all the Paladins to find me.\u2018And that means\u2026\u2019Five years until Camilla appeared.\u2018No, about four years and six months now.\u2019During that time, I\u2019ll be forced to live in the temple, acting as a saintess.The moment Reihausd kissed my foot two days ago, my heart pounded and I felt heavy as if shackles wrapped around my ankles.I put off my headache due to the thoughts for a bit and left the room after eating.Wearing a plain white dress, I started walking down the hallway when I heard a roar.\u201cSaintess.\u201d\u201cI greet the Saintess.\u201d\u201cMay you be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201dWhen I turned my head, three priests bowed their heads in turn and said excitedly.I have often met priests in the hallway, but they have never greeted me so warmly, only mechanically bowing their heads.I nodded my head with an uncomfortable look.Daisy\u2019s shoulders seemed to have lifted up somehow.\u201cI see the daughter of the divine Gods.\u201d\u201cThe glory of the Gods to the Saintess.\u201dAnd when I went out for a walk, the priests that I saw in every section I walked bowed their heads deeply with sparkling eyes.It was definitely a different atmosphere from before. Previously, it was just a formal greeting to the president of the company, now it feels like I\u2019m a celebrity.It was probably because I saved Daisy in front of a lot of people.\u201cToday, you\u2019re beautiful too. Saintess.\u201d\u201cGod bless Elium!\u201dReceiving these excessive glances made me feel burdened inside.\u2018Can\u2019t we just put it in indifference mode like before?\u2019But besides Daisy, there was another group that was excited.[The God of Love, Odyssey, raises his chin and raises the corners of his lips.][The God of Art, Mond, is dissatisfied with the number of jewels in your costume.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, blushes his cheeks red.]\u2026These awful attention seekers were rejoicing with pride at the attention I received.***On the way back to my room, I met Dwayne, who suddenly knelt at me.\u201cSaintess.\u201dI looked at him with a slightly startled look at the man\u2019s sudden movement, who had been slowly avoiding me recently.He bowed his head and said to me.\u201cI apologize I misunderstood the Saintess.\u201dWhat the hell does this mean?I looked at him with puzzled eyes and said.\u201cYou said you misunderstood me?\u201d\u201cT-That the Saintess\u2026 I thought a monster\u2026 hm, hm.\u201dDwayne\u2019s ears turned red, raising his face a little.After a while he shook his head.\u201cAnyway, I will never doubt the holy power of the Saintess again and serve you well.\u201dI don\u2019t know what the flow of his thought was, but I nodded, as he would serve me well anyway.\u201cAh. Have you not found the person who stabbed Daisy that day?\u201dWhen I asked with a dark face, Dwayne said with a hardened face.\u201cYes. I apologize. It seems like it\u2019s a highly trained assassin.\u201d\u201cAn assassin\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, they were attacked quite a bit and it\u2019s going to be pretty hard for them to move for the time being.\u201dThe important thing is that we missed the person who attacked Daisy.I can guess who might have made such a contract.Alberto Mikhael, who believed the words of my late maid, Annie, then was severely beaten up and even got slapped.\u2018He must have thought of killing my entourage and giving me revenge and a warning.\u2019\u201cDwayne, I have a question.\u201d\u201cYes. Please tell me.\u201d\u201cIs the murder contract usually done through the Thief\u2019s Guild?\u201dIn the original story, there was a story about the Thief\u2019s Guild collecting secret information.Dwayne was startled by my straightforward question and then nodded his head with a bewildered look on his face.\u201cI don\u2019t do that myself, but I think it\u2019s worth checking out as it\u2019s a place with a lot of information.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI also have a good informant in the Thief\u2019s Guild, so I thought it might make things easier.\u2018I\u2019ll look into it later.\u2019\u201cSaintess\u2026\u201dThen Daisy made a worried voice next to me.\u201cI\u2019m worried that you\u2019re getting involved in dangerous things because of me.\u201dI continued walking, speaking to her calmly.\u201cIt would cost such a powerful person a huge amount of money to break into the temple and commit murder. Have you ever had a tycoon holding a grudge against you enough for them to kill for that big sum of money?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why, it\u2019s directed at me. Not because of you.\u201dA warning that they will kill me like that next time.They don\u2019t want to be left behind, but so do I.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A story of nobles having doubts about the Saintess\u2019 passive behavior. It was a story that came out ahead of the Hunting Festival.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019ve always been noisy.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cI will participate.\u201dI have a good sense of smell, and always with impure intentions.\u201cWill you be okay?\u201dReihausd asked with an unwilling expression. The role of the temple in the Hunting\u00a0Festival was limited, so there would be no danger, yet he seemed concerned.\u201cI don\u2019t care what other people do, but I think it would be good to think of it as an outing. I get tired of repeating my everyday routine.\u201d\u201cIf so, I understand. I\u2019ll make sure we have enough Paladins.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, I continued.\u201cAnd now that I have become a saintess, I want to receive a business trip allowance.\u201dI saw Reihausd wriggle his eyebrows at my words. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant expression.\u201cI started out as a fake saintess, but now I have a real holy power. So, I\u2019m thinking that my maintenance cost is more than 1,000 franc per month.\u201d\u201cAlthough the budget has been re-established, I would like to ask you to consider allocating an additional budget.\u201dI have looked through the records of the saintesses\u2019 expenditure records so far, and to be honest, it wasn\u2019t a meaningful record to help negotiate wages.Because 30% of the saintesses refused to be paid, saying that they only serve with pure hearts to the Gods.But they were civil servants all their lives, and I\u2019m kind of a contract worker.\u2018I have to pull money when I can!\u2019\u201cNevertheless, please don\u2019t upset me with the allowance for participating in the Imperial events from now on. For your information, I know how much money the temple receives every time a saintess goes to the Imperial Family.\u201dThe Imperial Family paid 10,000 franc to the temple for every visit by a saintess.\u201cStill, don\u2019t you think I\u2019ll be motivated if you give me 30% of it?\u201dA deep smile formed on Reihausd\u2019s lips at my words. And after a while he opened his mouth.\u201cAll right. You\u2019ll be paid 3,000 franc per session. And from next month, we will pay you an additional 500 franc for the monthly maintenance cost.\u201dIt was a surprisingly easy answer.\u2018Should I have sung for more?\u2019I was a little excited at the thought that I could become rich in four and a half years.After all, let\u2019s make a lot of money using the Saintess Buff!\u201cYou seem to have grown a little bit more greedy, but\u2026\u201dReihausd\u2019s voice mixed with laughter continued to be heard.\u201cStill, I\u2019m just glad you don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to leave anytime soon.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t questioned me why I hid my power after it was revealed. But in the strangely softened attitude, I felt a clear pressure.\u201cYeees\u2026\u201dIf his previous gaze seemed like chains binding a person who had to leave\u2026Now it feels like he\u2019s making an iron cage while humming.Just thinking about it made me feel like something was wrong.\u201cThen I will express your intention to participate in the Imperial Palace. But, be careful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Ah, I should write another congratulatory speech for the Hunting Festival.\u201d\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s thought, he spoke again.\u201cDo you have any other plans for the morning?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cNo. Not today.\u201dThen he smiled softly.The halo shone brightly enough to make me forget his exhausting personality.\u201cI\u2019m glad. I wanted to play chess with Ariel for a while.\u201d\u201cChess?\u201d\u201cYou like chess, Ariel.\u201dHe opened the box he had brought and began to put it on the table. I was wondering what it was, but it turned out to be a chessboard.I stared blankly as the chess pieces were put up.\u2018Ah, Ariel loved chess.\u2019But I don\u2019t know anything about chess. Except that the cross-shaped horse is the king.\u201cHow about a chess bet once in a while?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a bet\u2026\u201d\u201cAs long as you can, grant a simple wish.\u201dReihausd presented me with a challenge.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t remember very well, but did we sometimes play chess?\u201d\u201cMaybe five times?\u201d\u201cHow is the record?\u201d\u201cI won four times and Ariel won once.\u201dIn Ariel\u2019s condition before I possessed her, there was a high possibility that Reihausd had never lost.\u201cWhat did I wish for?\u201d\u201cYou kissed me on the cheek\u2026 Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d\u2026You used your wish card to satisfy your very own self-interest, Ariel.\u201cAh. I did. Then what about Sir Reihausd?\u201dI asked, trying to fix the broken expression on my face.\u201cI had Ariel read a book about etiquette. There was a time when I asked you to memorize a hymn\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what will you wish for if you win this time?\u201dHe said in a soft voice with a faint smile.\u201cActually, I prepared a present for you\u2026 I don\u2019t think Ariel would accept it, so I offered a bet.\u201dI asked, not understanding what he was saying.\u201cYour wish is for me to receive a present?\u201dA light darkness loomed within the dark gold eyes of Reihausd who was smiling. At that moment, the back of my neck was chilling.\u201cTo protect Ariel when you go out, I want you to wear a necklace with a tracking function.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get a notification when you\u2019re too out of range.\u201dSo it was no different than saying that I was wearing an electronic necklace.\u201c\u2026 Even so, is it even necessary?\u201d\u201cOf course it is\u201dHe smiled, and I didn\u2019t want to ask any more.\u201cWhat kind of wish does Ariel need?\u201dAfter thinking for a while, I opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t we just not bet on this chess?\u201d***After a while, the fierce chess game was over.\u201cAriel\u2026\u201dReihausd\u2019s cheeks calling out to me were slightly red.\u201cIt\u2019s probably a little bit\u2026\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, rejoices.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, raises the corner of his mouth and fiddles with the lash handle.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, blushes.]I asked with a calm face.\u201cWhy. I won chess.\u201dAt those words, he looked at me in awe.His golden eyes flickered with a weary glam.The choker hung around his white, slender neck. And I held a small crystal ball in my hand, which had his location on the floor plan of the temple blinking inside.This special choker was made by connecting one of the accessories in my drawer to the location-tracking crystal ball of Reihausd.\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d\u201cI should also teach you a lesson.\u201dTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know anything about chess.But I had Hessed, the God of Knowledge. It wasn\u2019t difficult to win even if I didn\u2019t know chess.I moved the chess pieces quickly and accurately. Reihausd, on the other hand, looked bewildered at first, when he was pushed back even though he did his best.\u201cHow did you win?\u201dHe still had a questionable look as he hung the choker on himself in return for losing the bet.I said triumphantly, looking at the choker around his neck with satisfaction.\u201cThe Ghost Chess King.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is in trouble.]Reyhas asked urgently from behind me as I turned around.\u201cHow long do I have to wear this?\u201dI turned my head slightly and smiled.\u201cUntil I say stop.\u201dThen his golden eyes shook.\u201cIt\u2019s like a master and slave\u2026\u201dHe frowned and turned his gaze to the other side.\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t it?\u201dI saw his cheeks turn red again.[The God of Art, Mond, is delighted with the awakening of Reihausd\u2019s new taste.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, actively sells a lash to you.]I tried to ignore the words of the Gods and raised my head, pretending not to know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s surprising for them because it\u2019s a white temple carriage.The moment I waved my hand, the children rejoiced as if they had seen a celebrity.After a while, I turned my head away from the children. As the carriage began to move slowly.And at one point, someone poked an apple in front of the carriage window.I flinched my shoulders in surprise and looked at him.\u201c\u2026Marquis Lloyd?\u201dI opened the window with him holding out an apple with his white gloved hand.I took it in bewilderment while staring at him.If he usually dresses like a wealthy master, today he even wore a jacket and hat, so he looked like a perfect noble.Next to him was a fine brown horse with a mane.\u201cEat it. Because it\u2019s an expensive apple that I bought for 10 franc from the girl selling apples.\u201dI asked, amazed.\u201c10 franc?\u201dEven if that whole apple basket is bought, it won\u2019t cost you 2 franc.Standing in front of my eyes, he is a merchant who never makes a loss.I glanced at the sweet-looking apple, then looked at him again.A faint smile appeared on his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s not expensive if I can live with the favor of the Saintess.\u201dI was a little embarrassed by that lovely smile and turned my gaze to the apple.\u201cAre you going to the Hunting Festival too, Marquis?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHe got on his horse and followed the carriage slowly.\u201cIt must be the Saintess\u2019 first time.\u201dHe seemed to know that Ariel hadn\u2019t attended most of the events so far.\u201cYes. It seems like a bigger event than I thought. Seeing the road slide like this.\u201dAfter a while I heard his voice.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen every year. This year is special.\u201dHe continued, as if he had read my questioning gaze.\u201cIt\u2019s said that since the Empress is pregnant, this year, the attention of the nobles is focused.\u201dThe absolute power of the Empire rested with the Emperor. However, there were two opposing factions under the Emperor: the Imperial faction and the Crown Prince faction.Although many nobles supported Prince Kyle, the Sword Master and All-Powerful Prince, he didn\u2019t seem very interested in power struggles.Even if he renounced his position as Crown Prince, maybe it was because he was one of the top people in the continent just by the name of the Sword Master, and yet he had excellent political skills and was a natural born warrior.On the other hand, the Imperial faction, which was a political faction gathered around Young Count Mikhael, was growing rapidly enough to be compared to the Crown Prince faction.As the Empress is pregnant this time, there is a great possibility that the minority of the Imperial Family would be on an equal footing with the mainstream, the Crown Prince faction.If the baby in the Empress\u2019s womb is a boy.\u201cThe High Priest can\u2019t be seen today.\u201d\u201cAh, he\u2019s welcoming guests from abroad.\u201dIt was the reason he was so busy these days.Instead, in the four carriages behind me, there were three high-ranking priests each. They will heal the royals and nobles who are wounded in the Hunting Festival.\u201cThen can I escort you to the Hunting Festival? I\u2019ll even give you a tour of the hunting grounds.\u201dAt his sudden words, I shook my head and declined. That figure suddenly overlapped with the figure leading me at the night market.\u201cI\u2019ll be guided by Dwayne. And because I\u2019m not in good shape, I\u2019m not attracted to the hunting grounds.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s too bad.\u201dCass\u2019s low voice whispered softly in my ear.\u201cI thought it would be better for me to stay with you and protect you.\u201dI asked him back.\u201cThe Marquis, towards me?\u201dI asked with a smile.Then, suddenly, his voice lowered.\u201cEven if you feel better, don\u2019t enter the hunting grounds. I\u2019m telling you this because I have some ominous information.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you for your concern.\u201dA faint smile crept across Cass\u2019 lips as he looked at me the moment I stared straight at him.\u201cAfter seeing the Saintess\u2019 reaction, you knew it too.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer him.The information about the Thief\u2019s Guild obtained through the child was of great help to me, but there was no reason to reveal it.Soon, the congested road began to be re-opened.As the carriage\u2019s speed increased, and the horse\u2019s walking speed made it difficult to keep pace with each other, he hurried the horse and ran.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll see you at the Hunting Festival.\u201dHis horse, which ran faster than the carriage, gradually passed in front of me.The apple he gave was still in my hand. I picked it up and bit it. I could feel the sweet fruit juice and apple scent on my teeth.***A magnificent tune played by the Imperial Ensemble spread across the mountains.As Dwayne guided me, I walked up the carpet to greet the Emperor and Empress, and gave a brief congratulatory speech.After being greeted by the nobles, I sat down on a large chair a few meters away.Several large tents were visible, and there were hundreds of horses and as many nobles as there were horses. And there were a lot more people in maid outfits that seemed to help them.Just like Cass I saw earlier, the nobles were each wearing stylish activewear. Prince Kyle, who always wore a black uniform, was the same.He had a more aggressive and intense impression than usual, wearing a navy blue combat uniform with a sleek design and a long sword around his waist.He checked his black horse several times, then pulled out a blue blade and looked at it into the sun. Then, with a squeaky sound, he put it into the sheath.Perhaps it was because he was a Sword Master, his sense of intimidation was different even among the numerous nobles and knights.The knights often glanced at Kyle, as if it were felt among them.Perhaps it was no different for the Empress. Unlike the last time, when attention was mainly focused on me, he\u2019s only getting attention because of his giant presence in front of the wild.Putting the sword into his scabbard, he turned his head.Our eyes met head-on. I felt a bit embarrassed and tried to avoid his gaze, yet he strode towards me.His red eyes in broad daylight were more vivid.There was a strange sense of tension.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to me and Kyle.\u201cBlessing of the Saintess.\u201dHe put his hand up and grabbed my hand. Then, immediately, the chat window in front of me flashed.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, blesses you.]A tiger\u2019s energy sprang up all over my body.\u2026Ciel? Why are you blessing me all of a sudden, leaving the male lead behind?Even Ciel was the God who blessed Kyle\u2019s birth month.Reluctantly, I grabbed his hand and kissed the back of his hand. And then, slowly, he took his hand away.\u201cMay the blessings of the Nine Gods rest upon the Crown Prince.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What happened to Adela?!\u201dRaccoon grandpa was the first to scream hearing the news.It was so loud that my attention got diverted from Miru for a while.Raccoon grandpa, who rose from his seat, quickly approached Miru.\u201cHow\u2019s she now?\u201d\u201cHic\u2026 in bed\u2026Hic\u2026Hic\u2026 she was fine in the morning, but suddenly she lost consciousness.\u201d\u201cUgh,\u2026Lagos! You go to Adela\u2019s house first. You haven\u2019t forgotten the first aid methods I told you before, right?\u201d\u201cYes, of course, I remember.\u201d\u201cSihyeon, you take Miru and follow me. I should go to the store to get the medicine.\u201dLeaving the house to Locus and Kroc, the rest began to move as the Raccoon grandpa said.Everyone moved with all their might without thinking that something irreversible could happen a little later.I headed with Raccoon grandpa to his shop with Miru, who was wheezing in my arms.Upon arriving at the store, Raccoon grandpa packed the necessary herbs in his bag with a quick hand gesture I had never seen before.I wanted to help, but I didn\u2019t have any knowledge of herbs, so I had to just stand there without being able to do anything.\u201cAll done. Let\u2019s go to Adela\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cGive me your luggage.\u201dRaccoon grandpa left his luggage with me and hurried.I followed him, taking care of the luggage and Miru in my arms.Soon, we reached the outskirts of the villageAt the end of a slightly narrow and winding road, a wooden fence and a small house appeared.Raccoon grandpa ran into the house without hesitation while panting..I also strode into the house because it was not the time to think about manners.The landscape inside the house hasn\u2019t changed much.But instead of the warm atmosphere from the past, today I felt a bit cold and empty atmosphere.\u201cAdela!\u201dRaccoon grandpa opened the door of Miru\u2019s mother\u2019s room and shouted her name.Lagos was standing by the bedside, and Adela, who was lying down, slowly opened her eyes when she heard the loud cry.\u201cUm\u2026 Uncle Raccoon\u2026you came.\u201dAdela\u2019s voice was not powerful at all, but her pronunciation was clear.\u201cAre you conscious?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 Lagos came, I think I was a little tired.\u201d\u201cUh huh\u2026 that\u2019s good.\u201dAs if her condition wasn\u2019t as bad as he had feared, Raccoon grandpa breathed a sigh of relief with a slightly brighter expression.Adela turned her head and looked at me.\u201cSir. Sihyeon\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve caused trouble for the busy man.\u201d\u201cOh no, it\u2019s alright. I wasn\u2019t that busy today.\u201d\u201cYes. You don\u2019t have to worry about that guy. Don\u2019t think about useless things.\u201dNormally, Lagos might have warned Raccoon grandpa\u2019s way of speaking, but now Adela\u2019s stability was more important than such a trivial problem.\u201cHic, Mama\u2026 are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes dear, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m sorry that I scared you?\u201d\u201cUh. No Mama, I\u2019m fine, too. Hehe.\u201dMiru still trembled, but forcefully stopped her tears and smiled to reassure Adela.I was so proud of that strong heart, but on the other hand, I felt sorry for her.Raccoon grandpa took the medicine he had prepared in advance from his bag and fed it to her.Fortunately, there was a slight return of color on her pale face, as if the medicine had worked.The sound of breathing became stable, and the expression of frowning in pain became much more comfortable.Her rapid improvement relieved the rest of the people a little.Adela, whose condition became better, quickly fell asleep.The rest of us quietly walked out of the room so that she could relax.Raccoon grandpa, who looked at her condition, had a troubled look on his face.Lagos, who also seemed to have felt the same, asked very carefully to Raccoon grandpa.\u201cElder. Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dRaccoon grandpa\u2019s eyes shook for a moment.In that instant, I noticed where his eyes were headed.It was Miru in my arms.When asked by Lagos, he looked at Miru, then, there was a high probability that it wasn\u2019t good news.An ominous foreboding crept into me.Unknowingly, I hugged Miru in my arms.BANGReville appeared with a loud sound of the door opening, which seems to be heard often today.He asked hastily as he approached us.\u201cHow did it go? Is she alright?\u201d\u201cCalm down, Reville. Adela has just gotten better and is resting.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026? So there\u2019s no problem now?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dLagos couldn\u2019t answer the second question, contrary to the first one.Reville bit his lips with anxious eyes.After a while, the tense atmosphere in the house subsided and only the whimpering of Miru was heard, but no one could easily open their mouths.It was Raccoon grandpa, who broke the silence.\u201cFirst of all, Adela\u2019s condition seems to have improved. I\u2019ll have to go back to the store and make more medicine.\u201dHe spoke in a slightly exaggerated voice, looking at Lagos.\u201cDon\u2019t you have a lot of work to do? You don\u2019t have to worry about Adela for the time being. Leave this to Reville and go back with Sihyeon.\u201d\u201cWhat? I\u2019m\u2026.\u201dI was worried about Adela, so I was going to turn it down, but Lagos, who was next to me, interrupted me first.\u201cAll right. My Lord, let\u2019s just do what Elder Raccoon says.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI noticed something in the eyes of Lagos and nodded quietly.\u201cCandy uncle\u2026 are you going?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry Miru. I\u2019m a little busy with work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing that I was leaving, Miru\u2019s cat ears dropped down and she put on a droopy expression.I felt sorry looking at the pitiful appearance, but now I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cMiru, I\u2019m sorry. Instead, I\u2019ll be back as soon as possible after finishing the work. Wait for a little until then.\u201d\u201cYes Miru. I\u2019ll be with you until the lord comes.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Okay.\u201dMiru nodded and I patted her back with a proud expression.Leaving Miru to Reville, we slowly left the house.\u201c\u2026.\u201dWe walked silently along the path past the yard fence.Raccoon grandpa kept looking back toward the house.When the house was no longer visible, Raccoon grandpa sighed deeply.\u201cUghhhhh\u2026\u201dThe emotions in it were so complicated and heavy that just listening to it made my heart feel stuffy.Lagos, who also understood it, carefully opened his mouth.\u201cElder\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re thinking is probably right.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI couldn\u2019t stand the frustration and asked a question in the middle, and Raccoon grandpa answered with a bitter look.\u201cAdela`s physical condition is already at its limit. If we don\u2019t make the cure immediately\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat about the cure you gave her earlier?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an incomplete medicine. It only makes her feel better for a while. It doesn\u2019t cure the underlying disease.\u201d\u201cThen how can you make a complete cure?\u201dRaccoon grandpa stared blankly at the sky.\u201cWhere should I start with\u2026 \u00a0I\u2019ll start from the time I first came to this village.\u201dWhat..?What\u2019s happening all of a sudden?\u201cIt was just a coincidence that I came to this village. I was caught selling fake Spirit energy pills to the nobles and was on the run.\u201d\u201cFake Spirit energy pill?\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying, Elder? I\u2019ve never heard of it before.\u201dAt the unexpected story, our expressions were filled with absurdity.\u201cThis is my first time saying this. I think it\u2019s a very shameful behavior now, but at that time, the income was very good. The old aristocrats were ready to pour sh*t load of money at the mere mention of Spirit energy.\u201d\u201cThen, what happened?\u201d\u201cWhat could have happened? As soon as they found out what I was selling was fake, I was chased. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t get caught by the nobles. I got caught by the mercenaries. They took almost all the money I earned and beat me to the point where I wouldn\u2019t die.\u201dRaccoon grandpa shuddered as if he recalled the memories of that time.\u201cI managed to save my life, but I couldn\u2019t go back to the city. I was forced to wander through the forest with my whole body in tatters. After wandering around for days in the forest with nothing to eat, I fell down\u2026.\u201dHe paused and glanced back.\u201cWhen I woke up, it was that house. The couple who lived there found me and treated me. If they had left me, I would have died in the woods.\u201d\u201cThen the couple\u2026\u201d\u201cAdela\u2019s parents.\u201dThat kind of connection.Lagos opened his eyes wide as if he had never heard of the details.\u201cEven though I was a scammer, I wasn\u2019t bad enough to not feel gratitude towards my benefactors. For the time being, I decided to stay with them until I could repay their favor. Years passed as I stayed in the village like that. By the time I was recognized as part of this village, a beautiful daughter was born between the couple.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Adela?\u201d\u201cYes, the couple smiled happily at the child born after many years of marriage. I was, of course, overjoyed. But our joy didn\u2019t last very long. The baby was suffering from a congenital disease.\u201d\u201cThe baby gradually lost the light of life that was barely given by the world.. But like a destiny, I found a way to cure the baby\u2019s illness. It was a cure that I learned from the elders of my tribe when I was young! Among the medicines I learned, there was a medicine to treat the baby\u2019s illness. But\u2026\u201dRaccoon grandpa looked down at his hands with a bitter look on his face.\u201cA guy who used to make and sell fake Spirit energy pills didn\u2019t have what it takes to make that medicine. After spending all the money I had, I somehow made a medicine, but it was unfinished. I saved the baby\u2019s life, but I couldn\u2019t cure the disease.\u201dHis voice was full of sadness and emptiness.\u201cThen I made up my mind. I decided to repay the favor I owe to the couple by treating the child perfectly, and after that, I decided to leave this village without any regret\u2026.\u201dHearing the story and seeing Raccoon grandpa still staying in the village, meant that he had not yet produced a cure for Adela\u2019s illness.\u201cThen\u2026 Is there no other way, Elder?\u201dLagos asked earnestly as if squeezing out one\u2019s last hope.Raccoon grandpa remained silent for a moment.Lagos and I waited for his answer.\u201cI also almost lost hope in making the cure, but recently a miracle happened.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She will probably become a stumbling block and repercussions for the rest of his life.\u2018By the way, when did she see that I hit a child and even treat him?\u2019Alberto was swearing, but the carriage rattled, making him bite his tongue.\u201cAaaargh!

Aaagh!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until the time when the coachman hurriedly got off the driver\u2019s seat and ran through the window to escape alone, Alberto remembered a plan he had planned.At that moment, the flying arrow shattered the glass of the carriage and narrowly pierced the other wall.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAlberto\u2019s eyes were wide open.The reason for having the Saintess participate in the Hunting Festival was to harm her.They draw Kyle\u2019s attention by saying that a high-grade monster has appeared in a hurry and separates him from the Saintess, and then has the driver that has been bought in advance to drag and bring her in the other direction. After that, it will only be a matter of seconds.\u201cKekeke! You\u2019re here!\u201dThe sound of the carriage\u2019s door slamming was heard along with harsh laughter.Alberto opened his eyes and looked around.

His head also hit something and tingled.A harsh, hoarse voice was heard from above.\u201cYou\u2019re unlucky to meet bandits.\u201dWith his head raised, Alberto looked at them with wide open eyes.About five ugly men in commoners\u2019 clothes were covering their mouths. However, they weren\u2019t bandits. They\u2019re all assassins hired by Alberto.\u201cYew!\u201d (You!)\u201cNice to meet you. Saintess.\u201dHe got into the carriage of the Saintess, wearing her clothes, and was mistaken for her.The sound of a sword being pulled out made his spine tremble.\u201cDon\u2019t be too resentful. Still, you\u2019re the Saintess, so even if you die, God will send you to a better place.\u201d\u201cAi\u2019m nawt da Saintesh! Da Saintesh\u00a0went\u00a0thewe!\u201d (I\u2019m not the Saintess! The Saintess went there!)Alberto was bewildered by this situation and protested while staring intently at them.However, he bit his tongue so hard that blood was oozing from his mouth, and his pronunciation wasn\u2019t right.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe man who looked like the boss furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cI\u00a0saidh\u00a0ai\u2019m nawt da Saintesh, yew bashtardsh! (I said I\u2019m not the Saintess, you bastards!)\u201dThe man holding the knife stopped and furrowed his eyebrows, and the voices of men talking were heard.\u201cThere are rumors that the Saintess is an idiot, it seems to be true.\u201d\u201cI heard she was pretty, yet in reality she has a terrible face.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a face so messed up.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look like a man dressed as a woman? Disgusting.\u201dAlberto was just going crazy.\u201cCwazy bashtardsh, whath\u2019sh wong wihth\u00a0my\u00a0fesh!\u201d\u00a0(Crazy bastards, what\u2019s wrong with my face!)He screamed loudly, but blood was dripping from his mouth.Soon, the boss raised the sword toward him again.Alberto realized. No matter how hard he tried, there would be no chance that those bastards would recognize him.He quickly spread the dirt in his hands on their faces. Then he started running, holding the hem of the dress in both hands.\u201cWhat?! Catch her!\u201dAfter a while, he heard angry men\u2019s voices behind him.***\u201cAh\u2026 My back.\u201dUnlike the main characters in the movie, who can\u2019t stop running all night long, Ariel\u2019s body was far from exercising, that\u2019s why my lower back quickly began to ache.Kyle, who was running alongside me, stopped his horse, and so did I.He got off his horse and reached out to me.I grabbed his hand and hugged him for a little while, then came down. A cool scent lingered on the tip of my nose.\u201cDid the Paladins return nicely?\u201d\u201cI should advise Reihausd to clean the temple.\u201dThe reason we were alone was that the Paladins who had been following us to some extent suddenly started vomiting or grabbing their stomachs.Someone must\u2019ve mixed a drug that caused an upset stomach in their meals today.I didn\u2019t expect this up to now, but Alberto seems to have prepared quite meticulously.Now this place was in the forest, and it was quiet without anyone\u2019s presence. Of those who participated in the Hunting Festival, we probably came the farthest.\u201cIf I had known this would happen, I would have taken a carriage.\u201dKyle licked his lips at my words.\u201cIf you did, you would be playing with troublesome things.\u201dKyle also seemed to have guessed that Alberto or Empress had something in their minds.He quickly removed his cloak and covered the stump of the cut tree.\u201cSit down.\u201dI hesitated for a moment and then sat down on it. I felt like I was going to live when I rested for a while after sitting on top of the shaky horse.\u201cThis is a hunting festival but can you just protect me like this?\u201dHe looked into the distant forest and answered.\u201cDo you want to go alone?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHearing my stern answer, I heard him laugh.I didn\u2019t want to be left alone in the forest teeming with monsters. Besides, I\u2019m the Saintess. The oracle is helpful, but it was still safer to go with Kyle.\u201cI\u2019ll purify the rocks, then bring me back. After that, it\u2019s not too late to enjoy hunting alone, right?\u201dHunting festivals usually last until midnight. A search party is dispatched around midnight for those who can\u2019t come back even at midnight.\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to participate in this hunt.\u201dI asked him with a puzzled expression.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be helpful to show off your bravery by hunting big monsters?\u201d\u201cSometimes you have to take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer my questions. And instead he turned to me and asked.\u201cAre you getting enough rest now?\u201dI\u2019m sure my back hurts less than before. Yet I shook my head.\u201cNo. It hasn\u2019t even been five minutes yet.\u201dI have a quick temper, so please get up already.But unexpected words came out of his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, sit and wait.\u201dThe blade was pulled from his scabbard with a sharp sound. Immediately, a thump was heard in the forest, and the two horses standing there made a sound.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Thump, thump, thump.At that moment, the earth began to vibrate.I couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on, so I just looked in the direction of the sound.After a while, a faint shadow came rushing in and gradually revealed its shape.Something fat, with green skin and about three meters tall, was rushing here.It had a large stone ax in its hand, it was probably a troll.\u2018I feel like if I get hit with that stone ax even once, my whole body is going to break.\u2019I jumped up with a pale face.Neiigghh\u3161Contrary to Kyle\u2019s calm words at that moment, my horse\u2026 No, Alberto\u2019s horse raised its front paws and made a noise, then suddenly started running away in the other direction.\u201cNo! Don\u2019t go!\u201dI hurriedly got up and tried to catch the horse. But the horse had already run away.\u201cI forgot to tell you to hang it up.\u201dKyle, who was looking at the monster with his sword drawn, frowned and said.\u2018I can\u2019t even run away!\u2019Even at this moment, the troll continued to run at great speed.I stood behind him with clenched fists, resisting my instinct to run away at any moment.\u2018Help me!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And, as if by magic, Kyle was back in the place where he was.I couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened.But a few seconds later, the troll fell to the floor.I covered my mouth in surprise.It was bizarre to see it fall to the floor as if its whole body had been cut into pieces, rather than fall because his neck was cut off.Steam was rising from the blade Kyle was holding.Only his horse was watching this scene casually.\u201c\u2026\u201dI got goosebumps rather than being disgusted.[The God of Art, Mond, frowns.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, runs around happily.]All of a sudden, I was touched by the status quo of him being a Sword Master.That troll, turned into chunks of minced meat and slimes, probably won\u2019t know what happened until the moment of its death.His red eyes were still gleaming with terrifying flesh.\u201c \u2026Are you afraid of me?\u201dSuddenly I heard his voice.I looked into his eyes.A monotonous sense of fatigue stood in his red eyes as he looked at the place where the troll had died.A person who thinks it\u2019s trivial to kills something. What kind of life did he lead until this happened?\u201cThe lieutenants advised me. To save my smile while slaughtering. Strange rumors circulate about me among the soldiers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter that, my expression completely hardened. Sometimes I don\u2019t know what kind of face I have.\u201dWith a squeaky sound, Kyle slowly put the sword into the scabbard.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not afraid of Your Highness.\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, I opened my mouth to him. Then I saw him wriggle his eyebrows.\u201cYou seem to have more courage than I thought.\u201dHis self-helpful voice was calm, but somehow his eyes seemed lonely.Is there anyone who dares to approach Kyle with his sword drawn?I couldn\u2019t understand the loneliness and responsibility he had, but I suddenly remembered what I wanted to say.\u201cIf we were enemies, I would never want to meet you, but if you\u2019re an ally, you\u2018re the most reliable person.\u201dI mustered up the courage to speak a little more.He slowly turned his gaze towards me.\u201c\u2026An ally.\u201d\u201cYou just protected me. With that terrifying sword.\u201dIt was a huge troll. If I had been hit by that ax blade, I would have died immediately.\u201c\u2026So don\u2019t treat yourself like a monster. If it\u2019s real monsters, then we\u2019re talking about that.\u201dI pointed to the troll for a moment, then squeaked and looked away again.\u2018It\u2019s terrible to see it again.\u2019Hearing my foolish advice, he stared curiously at the troll for a long time.\u201cAh. Of course, I agree with the advice of the lieutenants. If you smile with a sword in your hand, you will come out in dreams.\u201dHis eyebrows seemed to wrinkle a little at my words, and a deep smile appeared on his lips.\u201cYou\u2019re becoming more rude in your words.\u201d\u201cI believe in your promise to guarantee my life.\u201dImmediately, he shook his head as if he was dumbfounded. There was a deep smile on his lips that I had never seen before.After a while.A challenge was set before us in the order of schedule.\u201cThe horse ran away, and there is only one way.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, jeers Kyle, accusing him of being an obvious mastermind.][The God of Love, Odyssey, cheers for this typical clich\u00e9.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, snorts.]I put away the flickering chat window of the Gods in front of me and thought about it for a while.Alberto\u2019s horse ran away. And all that\u2019s left is Kyle\u2019s horse, and we have another hour to ride.Are there any sharp alternatives?\u201cAfter waiting for a while then borrowing a horse from a passerby is\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re suggesting to extort. That\u2019s not bad either.\u201d\u201cN-no.\u201dBorrowing someone else\u2019s horse in a place where monsters like trolls roam around would be the same as telling that person to die.\u2018I\u2019m not that conscientious either, but I\u2019m tired of having enemies.\u2019In the end, when I couldn\u2019t think of an alternative, I asked him in a bit of desperation.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be too heavy if two people ride the horse?\u201dThen he reached out to his horse and touched its neck roughly.\u201cLiza is a trained warhorse. It won\u2019t be tired of that kind of weight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dI was worried that it would be heavy, but it was a relief. Anyway, it was my first time riding a horse with someone.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d rest more?\u201dHe narrowed his eyebrows and asked me.\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t feel good enough to keep looking at that.\u201dI glanced at the troll\u2019s corpse. It\u2019s not a corpse\u2026 Anyway, it was even worse.\u201cIt certainly is not a good view.\u201dI heard his voice mixed with laughter.In fact, his movements were still unbelievable. I clearly realized the importance of not turning the tip of his sword into an enemy.\u201cHold my hand.\u201dSoon he got on his big horse and reached out his hand.The saddle was wide, so I seemed to be able to ride in front of him without difficulty.I reached out my hesitant hand to him. He grabbed my hand and pulled me up. I know that he had broad shoulders and a good body, but he was surprisingly strong.Without thinking about it, I almost hugged him and grabbed him.\u201c\u2026\u201dOne hand on his waist and the other on his thigh.When I barely managed to balance and turned my head to look up at him, who was closely attached, I found his stiff eyebrows.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA heavy silence fell between us.I tried to regain my composure, but my voice trembled.\u201cI think I need to turn my leg a bit.\u201dAt the moment, I was sitting with both legs in one direction and only my upper body was holding him, so I would have to turn one leg into a riding position to get a stable posture. And soon my lips were tingled.Somehow, a low and dangerous voice flowed.\u201cI want you to put your hands away before that.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cYour left hand.\u201dThen I lowered my head slightly and looked at my left hand that was holding his thigh. And the moment I knew what I was holding on to, the accident stopped.\u2026What have I done?If there was a rewind button, I wanted to rewind time before getting on the horse.So my left hand was holding the very bad part of him.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dI\u2019m not a stutterer, but I was stuttering like crazy in this situation.I slowly removed my hand from him, stiffened.\u201c\u2026\u201dHis close breath felt particularly irritating.Kyle\u2019s red eyes, who had just shattered the troll, were staring at me with a stern look.With eyes so intense that I thought I might be the next victim after the troll.\u201cI thought it was your thigh.\u201dMy two legs were in one direction and only my upper body was turned unnaturally, so it seems that the position was misunderstood.\u201cBecause it\u2019s too hard.\u201dI made excuses in this embarrassing situation, but I soon realized that it was a mistake.His eyebrows twitched.\u201cNo, it\u2019s too thick.\u201dAh, this isn\u2019t it either.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, blushes, appreciating his magnificence.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, raises his lash and measures his not-thigh thigh.][The God of Art, Mond, sighs and acknowledges Kyle\u2019s victory.]The chat window in front of me shimmered, and a party was held at the oracle.[The God of Love, Odyssey, publishes a poem called,\u00a0 \u2018Love Is On His Thigh\u2019.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, redefines what thigh is.]They were excited. Very excited.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is biologically rigid\u2026 .]I desperately ended the oracle that was becoming increasingly stale. Then I turned around and sat down with my back against him.The gaze on the back of my head and the touch of my hand that still remained was driving me crazy.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, it wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201dI realized that in embarrassing situations, it\u2019s better to be quiet.There was no answer from behind for a while.As I wiggled my fingertips in the maddening silence, I heard his voice, which seemed a little angry.\u201cYeah.\u201dAnd before I could answer those words, I felt his firm upper body pressed against my back.\u201cIf it was intentional\u2026 .\u201dWith a harsh voice, the horse immediately sprinted out of the ground.\u201cToday\u2019s hunting would have ended here.\u201dHe wrapped one arm around my waist to keep me from falling and started running his horse. It was more dynamic and wilder than Alberto\u2019s horse I had ridden earlier.Every time the horse hit the ground, his hard chest slammed against my back. Kyle didn\u2019t say anything for a long time after that with his stiff eyebrows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rocks that have been weathered by the wind and turned round are growing like mushrooms.Kyle got off his horse, and I followed him. The largest of the rocks was as high as four stories high, and standing in front of it felt intimidating.On the dark red rock was a sentence engraved in an unreadable language.It was often said that priests and saintesses who participated in hunting festivals purified this rock. Although purifying the rocks doesn\u2019t eliminate all the monsters in the Kinston Mountains, it does prevent the monsters from appearing to some extent.As long as I have completed this mission today, even the Empress will no longer be able to attack me by mentioning the duties of a saintess.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared silently at the rock. Then I quietly brought my right hand to its surface.It wasn\u2019t difficult to let the sacred power flow now. I don\u2019t know exactly what purification is, but I thought that maybe it could be done as if I was healing.Sacred power flowed down the surface of the rock.After a few seconds, the letters engraved on the rock began to glow.I was thinking that it must be purifying well when I heard Kyle\u2019s voice next to me.\u201cI have never seen such power.\u201dLooking to the side, Kyle\u2019s eyes were on the side of the rock.It was then that I saw that not only the purified rock, but the other rocks were all sparkling and shining.Quiet little lights floated in the air, and green grass quickly rose from the ground.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dEven me, who was purifying, was surprised to open my eyes wide. Wild flowers were blooming here and there on the grass that sprang up when the purification was finished.\u201cIs purifying supposed to be like this?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dKyle stared at the marvelous scenery for a long time, then turned to me.\u201cWhat on earth are you\u2026\u201dRed eyes that sparkled with suspicion.He was questioning me with his eyes, what the hell I had done. Maybe he was asking about my identity.\u2018What should I answer?\u2019In fact, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this, so I can\u2019t explain it.Only a warm wind blew through the silence.On the way back riding his horse, the sky suddenly became dark and it started to rain.Kyle frowned and said.\u201cThe temple forecast said it would be a sunny day.\u201dIn the Empire, the temple also served as a weather forecaster.Well, even supercomputers can\u2019t get it right, so how can the priests get it right?Without thinking about it, I told him.\u201cI wish we could find a place to hide from the rain for a while.\u201dIt had rained so much that I couldn\u2019t even see the ground in the mud, so my body was already very wet.After a while, we found a cave large enough to fit a horse and went into it. The horse shook its body, and water splashed in all directions.\u201cIt\u2019s completely wet.\u201dThe cave was a small cave with a closed end, and seemed perfect for a short rest.Kyle brushed his wet red hair and stared out of the cave.It rains heavily. I sat down on a rock that protruded a little like a chair, and after a while Kyle sat down side by side.It was then. There was a flash of light, and then thunder and lightning struck with a loud roar and bang.Even Kyle\u2019s horse, who didn\u2019t run away from the monster, was surprised to the point that it raised its front legs and stirred it.\u2018It was clear up until now, but why is there sudden thunder and lightning?\u2019\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you have proven your power, but I can\u2019t believe it with my own eyes.\u201dWhen I turned my head and looked at him, his red eyes were staring monotonously out of the cave.I turned my gaze away from him and looked at the rainy landscape outside the cave.\u201c\u2026A real saintess.\u201dThe atmosphere was getting heavy, but the sound of rain made up for the awkwardness.He went on.\u201cWhat was the reason you hid it until now?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an interrogative tone.I hesitated for a moment, then opened my mouth.\u201cI wasn\u2019t a real saintess.\u201dThat was the honest truth.\u201cAnd I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m a real one.\u201dDrip, drip, I heard the sound of water dripping into the puddle as if water was leaking somewhere in the cave.After a long silence, he spoke again.\u201cEven though you have holy power, you don\u2019t think you\u2019re a real saintess. Interesting.\u201dI replied to his somewhat cynical remark.\u201cI\u2019m still just Ariel, the slobber of the temple.\u201dI glanced at Kyle and asked.A pair of red eyes seemed to dig deep into my eyes.He let out a low voice after a while.\u201cI thought you had changed.\u201dThere was the sound of dripping water.\u201c\u2026From one day on, you have definitely become a different person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTo the extent I doubt whether it was the same person as the woman I knew.\u201dLike a Sword Master, his senses were sharp. But I pretended to be calm and accepted his words.\u201cWell, everyone has a turning point in their life. I think I was too immature.\u201d\u201cI agree, though.\u201dHe raised his hand and swept away my wet hair.My heart was pounding in the dark light in his eyes, but I didn\u2019t waver and looked straight at him.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it seem like you\u2019re telling the truth?\u201dHis tightly closed red lips and persistent gaze were filled with doubts of conviction.Thoughts that troubled my heart flowed along with the sound of rain.\u201cYes. I have no way to explain it, but somehow I became a completely different person.\u201dI broke through the silence and opened my mouth.I couldn\u2019t explain this to him anyway.\u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to live a different life than before. It\u2019s not easy, but still.\u201dI could feel Kyle\u2019s deep gaze.Somehow, hearing the sound of raindrops stimulated my emotions.\u201cHowever, these days, I\u2019m thinking about it. Am I better than I was before?\u201dAriel in the novel was definitely a villain.So, am I a good person, possessing Ariel?No.In addition to overcoming and defeating the intrigues and tactics of those who saw me as a thorn in my previous life, I ahad lso decorated the tricks and shoved their backs to drive them away.Once I got bitten, I bit them two or three times, and only after a dog fight did they treat me as an invisible person.The darkness that has always been upon me has become evil, and I have been supported by it. Thinking about it now, it was embarrassing. I couldn\u2019t be one inch better than them.\u201cMaybe more than I used to be\u2026\u201dI might be a bad girl.Kyle\u2019s eyes were on me for a long time.After a while, I heard his voice.\u201cWell.\u201dIt was still raining heavily.\u201cI can\u2019t decide which is better, but\u2026\u201dHis voice was drowned in the rain and penetrated into my ears.Drip, drip, a feast of non-stop raindrops.\u201cAt least you look better now. If you grabbed someone else\u2019s collar because you didn\u2019t know where to look in the past, now you look like you\u2019re walking straight ahead.\u201dJust as I was about to feel better at the unexpected compliment, I heard his words again.\u201cIn many ways, it excites me more than before.\u201dI flinched at the strange tone of voice. And I felt something on my shoulder. It was his cloak.I turned around and stared blankly at him, then looked under the cloak he had covered, and noticed that the rain had wet his shirt, revealing his shoulders and skin.There was a rush of heat on my face.Fortunately, after a while, the heavy rain began to subside little by little.When it cleared up, we came out of the cave. The dark clouds that filled the sky had slowly receded before I knew it.\u201cShall we go back?\u201dAt my words, he reached out his hand towards me. It was meant to be put on the horse.But then.Boom! Boom!The sound of something exploding was heard nearby.Kyle pulled me behind him and drew his sword at lightning speed.There was dust in front.I didn\u2019t notice what had happened for a long time, but what I saw after the yellow dust cleared was a rock that had turned into a lump of charcoal.The rock, which looked quite large, was burned black and scattered with its fragments.And white smoke was rising from the bare part.I stared blankly at it in surprise.\u201cIs it\u2026 lightning?\u201dKyle frowned and asked.\u2018Lightning\u2026?\u2019What does lightning in the dry sky mean? And why did it suddenly rain so hard?The answers were gathered into one.I put my hand on my forehead. And after a while I whispered very softly.\u201cOpen the oracle again.\u201dThen a blue window appeared in front of me.[The oracle has been activated.]And dizzy messages flew into the chat window.[The God of Love, Odyssey, starts selling corn snacks again.][The God of Art, Mond, grumbles while sitting down and watching you.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, alternately looks at Kyle\u2019s pants and the cave you came from.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was surprised.\u201dPerhaps he doesn\u2019t want to know that the god of his birth month is very interested in his pants dance and blushes his cheeks whenever he has time.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. Let\u2019s go back.\u201dHe took my hand again and put me on top of his horse.We ran straight away.How far we ran, I wonder, towards the end of the afternoon, we reached the place where the Hunting Festival started.It was full of food and alcohol, just like an outdoor court banquet.People who had already hunted animals or monsters were standing in front of the officials after hunting and writing down their records.We approached the Emperor and Empress. However, the complexion of the Empress didn\u2019t look very good.Kyle said to the Emperor.\u201cI have brought the Saintess back after she purified the rock.\u201dAt those words, a deep smile crept across the Emperor\u2019s lips.His gaze turned to me as if he was proud.\u201cYou\u2019ve done well. Saintess.\u201d\u201cNo. Your Imperial Majesty.\u201dI answered humbly.Of course, deep down, I was thinking that I should charge more for the risk allowance to the temple.But then. Suddenly the Empress looked at me and asked.\u201cDid the Crown Prince stay with the Saintess all the time?\u201d\u2018Look at this?\u2019I answered calmly.\u201cYes. He has been by my side all the way to the rock.\u201dThen a sound was heard, as if the Emperor was urging her.\u201cEmpress. Are you suspicious of the Crown Prince?\u201dI listened to the conversation, wondering what that meant.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not like that, but two of my closest entourage died suspiciously during the Hunting Festival, shouldn\u2019t we investigate all the circumstances?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but be surprised at that.If the Empress\u2019s entourage died\u2026 Is it Alberto?The Emperor\u2019s worried voice followed.\u201cBoth the Empress\u2019 cousin, Young Baron Ludwig, and his cousin, the consul of the Ministry of Court, are desk-breeders who have only studied. They lost their lives in an unfortunate accident and I know how you feel it wasn\u2019t real, but you need to stop.\u201dIt seemed that Alberto wasn\u2019t the one who died. However, seeing the Empress\u2019s expression of anger and dying, it was probably one of her bases.By the way, people died at the Hunting Festival.\u2018As expected, it was also dangerous.\u2019It was when I glanced at Kyle as I was contemplating how much more I would charge for the risk allowance.\u201c\u2026\u201dI could feel a hint of joy in his red eyes, which glowed dangerously dark.Funny, at that moment, the mystery of why Kyle didn\u2019t participate in the Hunting Festival was solved.***At the closing of the Hunting Festival.The ruined Alberto ran screaming and rolling over.His face couldn\u2019t be described in words. His body was covered in mud as if he had been rolling in a muddy puddle, and his hair was rising upward as if he had been struck by lightning.I was able to infer that Hessed, who couldn\u2019t find me because I closed the oracle, threw lightning everywhere.The priests rushed to him, and he fainted violently. The Empress\u2019s expression was perfectly distorted.She didn\u2019t want me to come back alive yet I was fine, her entourages were dead, and Alberto was in that situation, so how could she not be angry?But I said to the Empress with a calm face.\u201cI\u2019m afraid Sir Alberto will be worried because he ruined my clothes.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 eyes glared at me as if they were going to kill me.I said to her with a faint smile on my face.\u201cTell him when he wakes up. There\u2019s no need for that.\u201dThe Empress bit her trembling lips. It was probably just before the curses came out.But how am I supposed to follow her scheming?\u201cYour Imperial Majesty. I shall now return to the temple. When the Hunting Festival is closed, please send the priests back.\u201dThe Emperor answered my words.\u201cGo back safely. Although there are many casualties today, the Saintess has purified the rocks, and more than a hundred people who depend on the mountains for their livelihoods will be saved.\u201dI bowed my head and greeted the Emperor.I could feel the venomous gaze of the Empress, yet I even passed it funny.Kyle escorted me and took me to the temple carriage. The Paladins had been healed by the priests and their condition had improved.I said, handed Kyle the cloak before getting into the carriage.\u201cI will return the cloak.\u201dDue to the extremely warm weather, the wet shirt was somewhat dry.Suddenly, Kyle put the cloak on my shoulder and grabbed my right hand.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI looked at him with a slightly startled look, and he raised my hand up. Then he lowered his head slightly and placed his lips on the border between the back of my hand and my fingers.His red eyes were staring at me wide open without looking down. The touch of his lips gave a subtle touch to my skin.After a while he lifted his lips from my hand and said.\u201cI\u2019ll give it back too.\u201dWhen he let go, I slowly lowered my hand.Several moments of the day passed by.The figure of Kyle who disassembled a huge troll into countless pieces in an instant.The story I had with him in the rainy cave.And\u2026 his cruel face, evidently killing three people in some way.I turned away from my thoughts and sat in the carriage.With the sound of Dwayne closing the carriage door, I felt Kyle\u2019s red stare at me through the window.***\u201cAAAAAGH! AAAA!!\u201dAlberto woke up screaming and the maids rushed into his room.His eyes were dark and he had a lightning bolt scar on his chest.It was a scar from lightning struck suddenly during the Hunting Festival.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cCalm down! Young Master!\u201d\u201cAAAGH Daaaamn you! Daaamn!\u201dThe maids clinged to him, but he beckoned her maids out with a strong hand.Then he kicked and trampled on one of the maids who ran.\u201cYou must die! Such a trashy bum!\u201dHis eyes were filled with madness.He started kicking her until the maid who was beaten fainted. Another maid was hit with a vase in the forehead and bleeding, yet he didn\u2019t stop.After a long run like a complete madman, he stopped when it was time for him to gasp.\u201cGet out! Everyone get out!\u201dWhen he finally came to his senses and looked around the messed up room, he yelled at the maids.Then the maids limped and left.His eyes were still full of fierce anger. He dreamed of being on a hunting ground.He later ordered his men to collect the lives of those useless assassins, but the trauma of being on the verge of death still didn\u2019t let Alberto go.He barely escaped, but the moment the lightning struck his, I couldn\u2019t forget the burning pain.And all this is because of that damn saintess.\u201cNo matter what\u2026\u201dHis red eyes trembled with anger.\u201cI will make her regret that she was born.\u201dHe was strongly determined.Ariel, before she became a saintess, was \u2018thousands\u2019 by Alberto\u2019s standards. Half of it was mixed with the blood of a servant, and it was inferior to that of a low-ranking noble.He couldn\u2019t tolerate that such a woman had insulted and humiliated himself, the younger brother of the Empress, so much.\u201cI won\u2019t leave her alone.\u201dSomething dark fluttered in the depths of his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day.I searched for the Hunting Festival among the archives of the temple library that I had previously borrowed. There were also records of what happened in the past hunting festivals, and there was something interesting about it.It is said that a man named Muller, the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Studies teacher, was killed by a number of arrows that were accidentally fired at the last Hunting Festival.And those who shot the arrows were Baron Dimitri and Young Baron Ludwig. They were the entourages of the empress.The Crown Prince requested a re-investigation, yet it wasn\u2019t accepted.I heard their names yesterday.\u2018As I thought, Kyle did that.\u2019The closer we got, his vigilance dimmed even more, but he was definitely a dangerous man.In fact, it seems that none of the three male leads are harmless.If his blade points outward at me, he\u2019ll be a perfect ally, but if it\u2019s directed at me as in the original story, or in the prophecy, I will probably never be as afraid.In any case, we were dealing with one enemy, the Empress, so we were allies, but friendship with him through a common enemy\u2026And that\u2019s when the thought got there.Suddenly there was a knocking sound from the window.I approached the window a little nervous, and was startled to see the child outside the window.As soon as I opened the window, the child of the Thief\u2019s Guild slipped into my room.\u201cAre you also a Sword Master?\u201dAt my words, the child asked back.\u201cyes? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cAh. no. How did you get here?\u201d\u201cBy climbing the wall.\u201dThe child replied indifferently.In fact, if he had been flying like Kyle, he wouldn\u2019t have almost been killed by Alberto\u2019s horse.\u201cWhat information do I need to know?\u201dThe day I went to the Hunting Festival, I gave the child a mission.At that, he nodded his head and opened his mouth.\u201cI found out that the Empress\u2019 Chief Maid had bought the thing the Saintess said.\u201d\u201cFrom where?\u201dI\u2019ve been to Lloyd\u2019s Merchant before and saw the Empress\u2019 Chief Maid angry. It is said that Lloyd\u2019s Merchant doesn\u2019t handle corporate goods.At that time, I passed it on without much thought, but now that the Empress has become an enemy, I need even a little bit of information.\u201cIt\u2019s only been purchased through a connection in the Deviamon Wizard Guild.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Deviamon\u2026\u201dAccording to the information I got from the books I read, there were several types of wizard guilds.In fact, the term \u2018School\u2019 was more suitable for the group of wizards than the name of a guild. And the Deviamon Guild was a very secretive and powerful organization with a long history of black magic.\u201cWait a minute. So, rather than grabbing evidence that she bought Kronia, maybe\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s also a guild that has as many different kinds of ghost stories as modern Freemason horror stories.Like moving the world behind the scenes with political black hands\u2026\u201cHow do I make contact with that person?\u201dThe child looked at me in awe.It seemed surprising that the Saintess was casually asking about the Black Magic Guild.\u201cThe Magic Night Market is held on the first day of every month, and I heard that people from the Deviamon Guild also appear there.\u201dThe child held out a piece of paper and I saw a picture of an inverted skull.\u201cIs this the emblem of the Deviamon Guild?\u201d\u201cYes. And on the back page, I put together some information about the Deviamon Guild.\u201dIndeed, when I looked at the back page, information about the guild leader and other information were written on it.\u201cAnd I also stole the information about Alberto Mikhael you mentioned. It was a little difficult because it was internal information.\u201dIt was good news.\u201cAlberto Mikhael only knows the assassins are dead, yet they\u2019re alive, and they\u2019re grinding their teeth on Alberto. I also received a definite answer that they would give evidence\u201dAs expected, he\u2019s a trusted Thief\u2019s Guild member as well.I smiled with satisfaction.\u201cThanks. You\u2019re exceeding my expectations, though? You\u2019ve got plenty of it today.\u201dI took out 100 franc and handed it to the child.He nodded and took the money. Then he looked at me with wide eyes and said,\u201cOh, my name is Noah.\u201dAh, come to think of it, I didn\u2019t ask for his name once.\u201cYeah. Okay. Noah.\u201dI looked at Noah and said.\u201cThat\u2019s a cool name. From now on, please take care of me as well. And the next mission.\u201dWith a bright smile, Noah accepted the secret letter I had written with a somewhat embarrassed expression.\u201cGive it to the Crown Prince. Just put it where he can see it. Since he visits frequently, you have a chance to contact him without even going to the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cAlright. Just leave it to me.\u201dThe child smiled faintly and climbed over the window frame again.As I hurried to the window, thinking the child was jumping, I saw the child skillfully descending the wall.I let out a small sigh of relief.In my hand, I held a crumpled piece of paper with the design of the Deviamon Guild.I grabbed it and stared at the calendar.\u2018When is the right time to let the siblings go?\u2019***A few days later.Daisy entered the room to wake me up. Having already woken up, I put down the book I was holding and got up.\u201cSaintess. Did you sleep well last night? You were tired, so as soon as you lay down, you slept before I even left.\u201d\u201cI guess I\u2019m not good at long-distance horseback riding. There\u2019s been some aftereffects for a few days.\u201d\u201cYou have a precious body, so you have to be careful.\u201dI rubbed my still sore back.\u201cShould I tell the High Priest that you can\u2019t go to meet him if you\u2019re not feeling well?\u201dI frowned at the remark.\u201cDid the High Priest call me?\u201d\u201cYes. It is said that all the temple annexes have been restored. He asked you to participate in the crusade today.\u201dThat was quite surprising.I think it\u2019s only been two weeks since the wreckage was cleared, yet it\u2019s already been restored.\u201cI\u2019ll just go.\u201dI got up from bed and said,\u201cWill you be alright?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not to the extent that I can\u2019t participate in the crusade.\u201dAfter a while I arrived at the temple annex.There were many people gathered in the annex of the temple, and among the believers of Elium, the influential believers and many priests were standing in line. Looks like my prediction was right.As if Reihausd had found me, his golden eyes lit up.\u201cSaintess. You\u2019re here.\u201dI told Reihausd.\u201cMay the High Priest be blessed by the Nine Gods.\u201dThen I stood next to him.\u201cIn such a case, please speak up in advance.\u201dOne corner of his lips went up slightly at my scold and then returned.Even if it was an annex, it wasn\u2019t a special structure, just the chairs arranged around the Holy Sphere.It was a place where the believers were brought here to give praise to the Gods when holding general meetings in the temple or when the main building couldn\u2019t be used.Reihausd, who had me standing next to him, opened his mouth as he looked at the audience.\u201cRecently, I have heard rumors circulating among the believers.\u201dA commotion was heard among the people.\u201cHmm,\u201d I coughed.Standing with so much attention, somehow my cheeks were itchy.His cool voice rang out.\u201cIt was also a vain rumor that doubted the Saintess\u2019 holy power.\u201dIt was an indication of the rumor of the Holy Sphere, which has now faded after the business trip to the hunting ground.In fact, Reihausd\u2019s words pierced my conscience. To be precise, I\u2019m a fake saintess. Isn\u2019t it natural for there to be a real main character?But even I can\u2019t understand this situation in which not only the three male leads but also the Gods treat me like a real saintess.Reihausd\u2019s solemn voice made the hall quiet as if he had poured cold water.\u201cI tried to respond strictly at the temple level, but after praying to the God of Benevolence for an answer, I decided to pass it on without reproach.\u201d[The God of Benevolence, Oman, condemns Reihausd\u2019s lies.]Once again, the Gods went wild\u201cBut the next time I hear these things, I will hold them accountable according to the law.\u201dI saw more than a hundred people sitting around.They were the central nobles of the Empire, wearing expensive uniforms and beautiful dresses.Most of them listened to Reihausd seriously, but there were a few who looked really suspicious of me.\u201cAnd I prove the holy power of the Saintess in front of the believers here so that rumors will never again damage the temple and the Saintess\u2019 honor.\u201dReihausd\u00a0 said to the audience with a cool gaze.It was Ariel, who had been missing most of the temple\u2019s official events and was stuck in the corner of the room.Until recently, all sorts of rumors had been circulating, and it would have been impossible for Reihausd to do anything about it. Unless you prove it like this, rumors are bound to grow.Everyone\u2019s attention was on me.\u2018Phew. I can\u2019t help it.\u2019I sighed inwardly and walked over to the Holy Sphere.I don\u2019t really like shows like this, but it was one of the things I had to do to not be bothered for the time being.It\u2019s because my plan to hide my power is ruined anyway.I put both my hands on the Holy Sphere and, eventually, it started to glow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

God Hetuse.\u201d\u201cSir Hessed. I\u2019m deeply moved.\u201dThey struggled to cover their dazzling eyes and sighed in admiration.\u2018Hm. It feels like I\u2019m doing some kind of magic show.\u2019I carefully removed my hand from the sphere that was emitting light like a light bulb.The hall became dark again.Praise for me burst out among the believers.\u201cSaintess! I see a miracle.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of scoundrel dares to spread such false rumors!\u201d\u201cCalm down, Your Grace the Duke!\u201d\u201cThe Nine Gods. Blessings to Elium!\u201dThe sight of them clasping their hands together and exclaiming exclamations made me want to leave.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, looks at you with a proud face.][The God of Love, Odyssey, winks his eyes and gives you three rounds of applause.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, stomps around wanting to hug you.]And the Gods seemed to be appreciating me as if they were watching their kindergarten daughter giving a presentation at a school festival.I felt a burning sensation in my ears and spoke to Reihausd in a low voice.\u201cCan I leave now?\u201dAs if he hadn\u2019t heard me, Reihausd still looked solemn and said to the believers.\u201cI guess everyone who has eyes has seen it. If any rumors like this are heard again in the future\u2026\u201dEveryone in the audience looked at Reihausd\u2019s lips.As he opened his mouth, the choker moved along with his protruding neckline.\u201c\u2026Our Elium will never sit idly by.\u201dAt Reihausd\u2019s words, each of them nodded their heads and made serious expressions.Not long ago, all members of Baron Ragefield\u2019s family had been expelled, so the nobles were keeping their guards up.After finishing speaking, Reihausd looked back at me and said.\u201cThe Saintess can go in now.\u201dThen he bowed his head a little closer, whispering.\u201cAh, I won\u2019t disappoint you with the allowance for earlier.\u201dAs I was about to leave, I straightened my shoulders to his words and put my hand on his shoulder. And gently stroked him with gratitude.As expected, money is the best.I brought my tired body back to my room. After the Hunting Festival, I even did a show to prove my holy power, and my body was very tired.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, offers a discount price for the lash.]Aiming for me, who was taking a break in fatigue, Oman offered me to purchase a new relic.\u2018It\u2019s enough.\u2019I closed my eyes and lay on the bed.As of today, I have completely become a real saintess. Now I have really crossed a river of no return.What will my life be like in the future? Will I continue to live as a saintess like this?I was about to give up for a moment, but I jumped up and shook my head.No. I can\u2019t!In any case, after four and a half years, I will definitely hand over this burdensome position to Camilla.When I counted the allowance for participating in the Hunting Festival and the huge gifts of the Emperor, my current assets exceeded 20,000 franc.20,000 franc is enough money to buy a small one-story house on the outskirts of the capital.It would take quite a while to reach my target of 100,000 franc, but the money was gradually gathering up.\u2018Ariel, way to go! Come on!\u2019***After a while.The first day of the month has come.I prepared to go out secretly.The first thing I did was to pretend I was asleep and deactivate the oracle. The Gods wouldn\u2019t have noticed it, as it would often be deactivated when washing or sleeping.Apparently, in the Magic Night Market, there were also dark magicians and black magic guilds that were the source of the power of the \u2018Magic Realm\u2019.It was obvious that the Gods overprotecting me would nag me with concern or disturb me. No one will know how bothersome they were when I asked Noah a while ago.I\u00a0 wore a dark blue-colored dress, the only one in the Saintess; closet, and took care of my pockets.[Your Money: 20,100 franc]If there are any sensitive magicians, I might get caught, that\u2019s why I also wore the pendant that suppressed my power that I bought at the shop last time.I was also wearing Hessed\u2019s bracelet, which was the first holy relic I bought at the shop, to protect my body.After I left the temple, I went to the stable. Then I saddled one suitable horse and rode on it.It was easy to leave the temple after going out to the auction house with Dwayne a few times.The boundary between the outside and the inside became very strict after Daisy was attacked, but the boundary between the inside and outside became relatively loose.As the horse ran in the dark, a jingle and the clashing of coins could be heard in the bag. After leaving the temple and running for a while, I arrived at the outskirts of the capital.There were shabby houses everywhere compared to the decent houses I had seen before. Also between the narrow alleys with a musty smell, there were lights and tents.As I stopped the horse and entered the night market, I could feel the eyes of the children.The children squatted in the dirty alley and eagerly ate long loaves of bread that the magicians probably gave them for their night market seats.This was also the moment when I realized that the gap between the rich and the poor was wide.Then, a familiar voice was heard from behind.\u201cSaintess.\u201dI turned around and saw Noah.\u201c\u2026Noah?\u201dNoah jumped off the stairs to the second floor. Then he stood in front of me, greeted me politely, and lifted his head.\u201cI forgot to say that Magic Night Market is dangerous for women to go alone.\u201d\u201cDid you come to accompany me?\u201dNoah nodded his head.The child\u2019s kindness warmed my heart.I smiled, thanked Noah and started walking alongside him.\u201cIn the night market, merchants entrusted with sales by the guilds often charge unreasonable prices to unfamiliar customers, so be careful.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to be deceived?\u201d\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201dWhat a straightforward fellow.I was a little nervous about the gloomy atmosphere, but having a companion made me feel more confident.The night market here was different from the large and pleasant night market of the Rose Festival.There seemed to be at most about twenty shops with seats, and there weren\u2019t many customers. However, most of the guests were wearing suspicious clothes, and I assumed that they were magicians.\u201cThe price of bat eyeballs is crazy these days. It\u2019s 10 franc for a pair, what is left even if you make a potion?\u201d\u201cIf I have this artifact, can I curse people to get hives?\u201dThe voices of magicians could be heard around.As if I was one of them, I slowly began to look at the stalls.\u201cEw\u2026\u201dThere were also disgusting and terrifying ones.\u2018Isn\u2019t it crazy to serve rat meat as a delicacy? Who are the people lining up there?\u2019However, there were also things that were beautiful enough for me to open my eyes.\u201cIt is a music box that improves skin.\u201dAs I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the colorfully shining music box, the store owner quickly approached me and explained.\u201cDoes this make your skin get better?\u201d\u201cYes, if you turn on the music box for 10 minutes a day, magical music that has a positive effect on your skin plays. These plants here didn\u2019t have a magical sound, so they didn\u2019t grow this much, but these leafy plants play magical music for 10 minutes a day.\u201dIndeed, the eggs of the plants that played magic music were rolled and the leaves were lush.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. Please don\u2019t believe him, Saintess.\u201dThen Noah lifted his heel and whispered in my ear.After all, there are false and exaggerated advertisements everywhere.I shrugged and shifted my gaze to the side.But next to it was an egg the size of my fist.\u201cWhoa, what is this?\u201dIt was a colorful egg that looked like a Russian doll Matryoshka.\u201cIt\u2019s an egg of a demon.\u201dThe shopkeeper asked me with suspicious eyes.\u201cSince you don\u2019t know about demonic creatures, you don\u2019t seem to be a magician.\u201d\u201cAh yes. I\u2019m not a magician, but a magician\u2019s\u2026 assistant.\u201dI quickly surrounded myself for fear that he might cheat on me as I was an innocent person.\u201cThe Master is a very vicious one, and I have several items to buy, so I come and take a look.\u201dIt also meant that if he tried to hit me, the violent master wouldn\u2019t let him go.\u201cA demonic creature is a creature that wakes up when the owner\u2019s magic is poured on it. This egg has a high grade among demonic eggs, so there\u2019s a high probability that a useful one will be born.\u201dThe store owner quickly cleared his guard and explained.\u201cIs it like a monster?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s similar, but it\u2019s more like a pet as it\u2019s intelligent and has the ability to interact with its owner.\u201dMy curiosity grew when I heard the word \u2018pet\u2019. When I was young, it was my dream to have a dog.\u201cNoah, what do you think?\u201dI turned to Noah and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s truly a high-grade egg. I haven\u2019t seen it myself, but I\u2019ve heard that the thinner the stripes, the better.\u201dNoah, who accompanied me, explained in detail. He was a great source of information for the first night market I visited.\u201cBut when you see that he tried to cheat with the music box earlier, he\u2019s unbelievable.\u201dI agreed with Noah\u2019s words.However, I was curious as I couldn\u2019t find such thing in other stores.\u201cHow much is the price?\u201d\u201c1,000 franc.\u201d\u201c\u20261,000 franc?\u201dI opened my mouth wide in surprise at the unexpected answer.\u201cIt\u2019s a unique grade egg, shouldn\u2019t you pay 1,000 franc to stay? The devil\u2019s eggs are forbidden to trade, so you can\u2019t buy them at the merchant. Besides, unique grades are very rare in our night market. You\u2019re lucky today.\u201dI replied, raising my eyebrows.\u201cStill, I think 1,000 franc is too much.\u201d\u201cIf you leave today, you won\u2019t be able to get a unique grade, will you be okay? It seems that the customer really likes it, so I will deduct 100 franc.\u201dWhen I showed my concern, the owner cut off 100 franc.\u201cSaintess, let\u2019s just go.\u201dNoah urged me to leave the store with a fed-up look.Yet somehow, I kept my eyes on the egg.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAuthor: lipzoldyck\u201cWait a minute, Noah.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, I cautiously said to the merchant.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s 900 franc. I\u2019m really worried. But looking at the emblem, it seems like you belonged to the Pennsyl Magic Guild. Among my master\u2019s friends, there are also the people of Pennsyl Guild, and they\u2019re very kind.\u201dRecalling the emblems of the various magic guilds I had seen in books, I casually lied.At my words, the merchant frowned.\u201cThen I will go around the night market a little more. Master\u2019s friends are also coming out today, I\u2019ll be greeting them and discussing the price of the magic creature egg.\u201dAt my words, the merchant suddenly coughed.\u201cCough\u2026 Well then, I can give you a little more.\u201dThese items belonged to each guild, and they probably had a set price.However, there were many cases where the entrusted merchant intercepted the difference other than the commission after raising the price.\u201c500 franc.\u201dI proudly told the store owner.At my words, he waved his hand.\u201cNo, that\u2019s really not enough for us. I bought an egg for 550 franc, how can I give it to you for 500 franc?\u201d\u201cAh. So, the Pennsyl Magic Guild\u2019s shop was trying to sell something that costs 550 franc for 1,000 franc.\u201dThe store owner was startled at my words.\u201cI also have to tell the friends of the Master, people from the Pennsyl Guild. With such a high margin, won\u2019t the Pennsyl Guild get rich quickly?\u201d\u201cC-Customer!\u201d\u201cPerhaps other items are also sold at very high margin rates, right? I have to urge them to check out the other artifact lists as well.\u201dThe store owner\u2019s expression became urgent. Guild magicians wouldn\u2019t stand still if they knew that customers were ripped off every time and money was stolen.\u201cCustomer! then\u2026\u201dHe said with a change in his face.\u201cAlright. I will give it to you for 550 franc.\u201d\u201c500 franc.\u201dI replied with a bright smile.The store owner looked at me with a puzzled look and sighed deeply.So I put the demon egg I got into the bag.[Your Money: 19,600 franc]The bargain was successful, but it was still expensive.\u201cIf you come to our guild, I think you will become a great talent.\u201dAt Noah\u2019s admiration, I was embarrassed for nothing. Shall I consider the Thief\u2019s Guild as a second career path?I walked the night market again with Noah and looked around other shops.What I was looking for today was the Deviamon Guild\u2019s shop.Holding the paper with the Deviamon Guild symbol drawn by Noah, I looked around. Yet no matter how much I did, I couldn\u2019t find it.\u201cAren\u2019t they coming today?\u201dIt would have been nice to be able to meet someone from the Deviamon Guild, but it was the moment when I sighed while thinking.I could see the flags of the shops that I passed without thinking about it and were blown away by the wind.When I inadvertently looked at the flag, I stopped. Then I stared at the paper in my hand.A black skull.And if I put it upside down\u2026\u201cI found it. Right?\u201dIt was the Deviamon Guild.Behind the stall stood a suspicious-looking merchant in a black robe.With a trembling heart, I approached the Deviamon Guild\u2019s stall. And I mustered up the courage while holding out my things..\u201cHey\u2026 You\u2019re from the Deviamon Guild, right?\u201d\u201cI want to meet the Guild Leader of the Deviamon Guild.\u201dIt was absurd, but the merchant\u2019s eyes stared at me sharply.The item I brought out was a 100 franc \u201cAncient Coin with Minor Divine Power\u201d\u00a0 I bought at the holy relic shop.I bought it after hearing from Noah that The Guild Leader of the Deviamon Guild liked ancient coins and collected them.The merchant who picked up the coin looked at it carefully, and then he stared at me.\u201cIt\u2019s a unique thing. Where did you get this?\u201d\u201cI came here because the Guild Leader was very interested in coins, so I wanted to trade. I also have something to buy.\u201dThe merchant, who had paused for a while at my answer, touched the magic ring he was wearing with his other hand.After a moment, two men in black robes appeared behind me.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the Guild Leader.\u201dAs expected, Noah\u2019s information that the Guild Leader also traded coins was correct.I followed them out of the night market and started walking through the night.I wasn\u2019t afraid as I had received Ciel\u2019s blessing in bed with the forced excuse that I was afraid of nightmares. Noah was with me, too.\u201cI think it\u2019s over there.\u201dAs I listened to Noah\u2019s words, I saw a mansion exuding a gloomy energy.\u201cNoah, from here on, I will go in by myself.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI have an idea. Let\u2019s meet in front of the house later.\u201dAlthough the truth is I\u2019m worried that something dangerous will happen to Noah.I turned around and walked forward, leaving him behind.As I entered the gloomy place with two men without a word, the mansion door closed with a squeaking sound.After that, I just kept walking with them. As we approached a large space, I could see the back of a man sitting on the sofa.He was facing the fireplace, with his back against me, so I couldn\u2019t tell if his hair was orange or silver.The man\u2019s hand was fiddling with the coin I had handed to the merchant earlier.\u201cI came here because I wanted to get something.\u201dI looked at him and opened his mouth.However, even at my request, the Guild Leader didn\u2019t look back for a long time.A little frustrated, I moved closer to him.\u201cIt\u2019s an ancient coin. It\u2019s not a common thing, but it\u2019s a product that has a low value. It\u2019s expensive, about 100 franc.\u201dI was startled by the sweet voice, later I realized that it was a man\u2019s voice.The man who was looking at the fireplace slowly turned his head.Thus, for the first time, I came face to face with the representative of the Deviamon Guild.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHis hair, which had been discolored by the flames, was silver as white as snow. The purple eyes, which seemed to be a mixture of blue and red, made me feel like my heart was sinking.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI was speechless for a moment with a beautiful face, and then I opened my mouth.\u201cI brought it because I thought it was precious, I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201dI answered right away.\u201cKronia.\u201dKronia, the illegal medicinal herb, was banned from trade. This is the item that the Empress\u2019 Chief Maid was trying to buy from Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.Noah said that it was sold by the Deviamon Guild.The man looked at me and said in a relaxed tone.\u201cAh, that.\u201dMy heart was pounding.Is the information Noah obtained correct?\u201cWe don\u2019t deal with it.\u201dA corner of his lips twisted. It was an outright lie and rejection.But I didn\u2019t give up and pleaded with him as if it were nonsense.\u201cNo way. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve heard that Kronia is sold here.\u201dAt my words, his purple eyes stared at me.\u201cI heard that you can get Kronia as well as Beckia and Ansha here.\u201dThey were all banned narcotics.According to the information Noah obtained, those items are rumored to be distributed to only a small number of people in the Deviamon Guild.At one point, his eyes seemed to glow mysteriously.His feet approached me and he stopped in front of me.\u201cWho did you hear that from?\u201dI kept my composure and answered clearly.\u201cI can\u2019t say that.\u201dThen he raised his hand.Soon his eyes lit up, and a mysterious light stretched out from his hand. And I heard his question again.\u201cWho are you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Celestine.\u201dI recited the information with blank eyes. It\u2019s only half of the information anyway, so he can\u2019t infer my information.Celestine was the surname of Ariel\u2019s mother, who was a baron\u2019s daughter, and Ariel used her mother\u2019s surname when introducing herself deliberately to show that she had half the aristocratic blood.\u201cI\u2019m a lady of a local province noble who is the first cousin of the in-laws of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress.\u201dHe continued to ask.\u201cWhom did you hear about the drugs from?\u201dI opened my eyes and answered politely.\u201cEmperor Ros\u00e9 Illide mentioned the \u2018Deviamon Guild\u2019 at the secret meeting of the female nobility. I need Kronia for personal purposes, so I came to you with a coin.\u201d\u201cWhat was Ros\u00e9 Illide talking about?\u201d\u201cI heard that the Deviamon Guild handles drugs that are prohibited. She also gave the names of those who belonged to the Deviamon Guild among the nobles. The Empress said that she was well aware of the weakness of the Deviamon Guild, and that she had the Deviamon Guild in the palm of her hand.\u201dHis fine eyebrows could be seen contorting.He quickly licked his lips nervously.\u201cYou will forget everything you heard from Ros\u00e9 Illide.\u201dI answered with a blank expression.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd you will forget that you met me today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI answered him politely.He stared into my eyes for a long time. Then he mumbled.\u201cI don\u2019t know why\u2026 I feel bad.\u201dI stood blankly, trying not to make eye contact with him, then he reached out and tried to put his hand close to my cheek, stopped, thus he lowered his hand.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cCelestine.\u201dHe asked my name again to confirm my compliant state.\u201cNow go. Celestine.\u201dAs he turned and walked out, his purple gaze persistently tickled the back of my head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You can come out now. Ugh, I thought I was going to die of a heart attack.\u201dWhen I called his name, he appeared from afar and approached me.Noah asked with a worried look.\u201cDid anything happen?\u201dI shook my head.And I looked at the pendant, which was once a token of a waste of money, but was used as a very useful item.The \u2018Pendant of Sealing\u2019, a holy relic that keeps my inner holy power from being exposed to the outside, completely blocks external holy power and mana as well.The man who was called the Guild Leader of the Deviamon casted memory distortion magic that made me tell the truth.I made a statement to him, acting perfectly enchanted.As he\u2019s the leader of a black magic guild and I\u2019m a saintess, we\u2019re at a point of opposition that we can\u2019t see each other in a normal way, thus he\u2019s not going to see my face again.\u201cOh, Gods. Today, I have become a righteous deceiver.\u201dI couldn\u2019t know the details of what was going to happen in the future, but I laughed out loud.I\u2019m the type of person who pays back several times for the bad deeds I\u2019ve suffered.So I returned to the temple.The next day.As if nothing had happened, the morning began with the oracle.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, welcomes the morning sun.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, examines your condition.][The God of Art, Mond, says the dirt on your shoes is questionable.]\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I went out for a nearby night out and came back.\u201dI spoke in an indifferent tone.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, is wary of something on the table.]I suddenly remembered something I bought at the night market yesterday. Then, I lifted a single egg as big as a child\u2019s head on the table and looked at it closely.Come to think of it, the merchant said it was an egg of a pet demon.\u201cI picked it up.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, recognizes your shameless lie.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is wary of eggs.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, strokes Ciel\u2019s head.]To be honest, I bought this because it reminded me of a parrot that I had raised in my previous life.I don\u2019t know what will come out of it, but it\u2019s not a bad thing because it\u2019s a \u2018pet\u2019.Compared to the sack of gold coins, which was somewhat repulsive, the egg was cute and didn\u2019t feel anything special.I injected holy power into the egg through my hand. Although it was an egg of a demonic creature, the egg absorbed the holy power well as if it were eating rice.\u201cWhatever its bloodline is, I just have to raise it well.\u201dBy the way, can I give the demonic creature holy power?***At that time. In a back alley.\u201cLeave the child alone.\u201dAt Kyle\u2019s orders, the soldiers left Noah and went outside.Noah was kneeling in front of Kyle, looking at him with his body boundKyle raised the corners of his lips at the look of a young boy. even in a frightening situation\u201cThe letter must have belonged to Ariel.\u201dIn Kyle\u2019s hand was Ariel\u2019s letter, which Noah had placed in his pocket, taking advantage of the commotion.He was successful in delivering the letter. However\u2026\u201cThen why did you hold me?\u201dKyle opened his mouth at Noah\u2019s remarks, which he had been looking forward to quite a bit.\u201cHow did the child of the Thief\u2019s Guild become a limb of the Saintess?\u201dNoah replied to that with an expressionless face.\u201cI\u2019m just getting paid and running errands.\u201dAriel told Noah to answer anyone who asked so. That would be a protection for each other.It must also be true that Noah was paid 50 franc for this work alone.\u201cYou seem like a pretty smart fellow.\u201dDespite the praise, Noah\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.Kyle took a coin from his pocket and put it in front of Noah\u2019s eyes. There were ten gold coins worth a whopping 100 franc.\u201cGive me something to do.\u201dNoah\u2019s eyebrows moved slightly for the first time.Kyle\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cReport to me about the movement of the Saintess in the future.\u201dAt those words, Noah\u2019s eyebrows twitched and moved greatly.Kyle was looking down at him with cool red eyes.\u201cYou can get an undeserved price and run errands for me as well.\u201dNoah knew who Kyle was. He\u2019s the only prince of the Empire and a Sword Master, even to the point that if he offends his heart, he could have a very bad ending.\u201cI will decline.\u201dBut Noah answered him as if he had nothing to think about.A chill radiated rom Kyle\u2019s gaze.The aura close to living literally was strong enough to make the body of an untrained boy tremble, yet Noah didn\u2019t reverse his words.\u201cI don\u2019t want to betray her.\u201dNoah spoke word by word.\u201cSo I can\u2019t receive this money.\u201dEven though he was getting paid and running errands, Noah knew that Ariel was also considerate of him. She provided another way for him to live and saved him by pouring holy power.The only way for Noah to repay her favor was to do his best to comply with her requests.Kyle drew his sword from its scabbard. A blade with a cool black glow was aimed at Noah\u2019s neck.The blue energy rising from the Sword Master\u2019s sword made Noah\u2019s face pale.\u201cIf it\u2019s a threat, not conciliation.\u201dKyle\u2019s lively voice reached Noah\u2019s ears.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dNoah was well aware. What kind of consequences his answer would bring. Yet he answered without hesitation.\u201cI still can\u2019t.\u201dWas he eight years old, the glare in the eyes of the small boy looked straight into Kyle\u2019s eyes.Kyle twisted his lips at Noah\u2019s slightly trembling but firm voice.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re a good fellow.\u201dAnd he pulled back the sword that was almost going to touch his neck.Noah looked at him with an expression as he didn\u2019t understand the satisfied voice.\u201cYour spirit just now is great. Don\u2019t change.\u201dKyle pushed the drawn sword into the scabbard.Noah looked at him blankly.\u201cI would have killed you if you had accepted my offer.\u201dHe made a low voice and turned away from Noah. He then added his words.\u201cIf you want to learn the sword later, come to me. The agility of your body was exceptional.\u201dNot knowing when the sword was used, the rope that bound Noah snapped and loosened.Noah stared blankly at Kyle\u2019s back as he read the letter.***\u201cKronia.\u201dAt that word, Ros\u00e9\u2019s heart was about to fall. It was a word that shouldn\u2019t have come out of the Emperor\u2019s mouth.The Emperor, sitting alone in the office, held out a document to Ros\u00e9.\u201cI heard that the Empress\u2019s Chief Maid bought a very ugly thing.\u201dRos\u00e9\u2019s pupils, who took the documents with shaky hands, became smaller. This was never supposed to be in the hands of the Emperor.Fellium Magic Trading Contract. And there, her Chief Maid\u2019s autograph was beautifully engraved.The problem was that she had never heard of the name Fellium in her lifetime, and her Chief Maid had never bought Kronia there.Who would write a contract to buy such a secret thing?But what the hell is this nonsensical contract\u2026\u201cYour Imperial Majesty! This is a setup. Please listen to me!\u201dThe Empress shook her head and pretended to be surprised.\u201cThis contract is obviously fake and nonsense.\u201dKronia had attracted quite a few people who were addicted to narcotic drugs.\u201cMaybe the Chief Maid abused my name to do this, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pregnant with a prince, how can I\u2026Her mouth is dry, but in this case, pretending to be innocent is the best.\u201cAre you serious?\u201dHowever, the Emperor opened his mouth with a voice of suspicion instead of sympathy.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe Empress\u2019 shoulders shuddered.Only the corners of her lips, which were lowered, could explain her current feelings.\u201cKronia leaves have already been found in the Empress\u2019s residence.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 face darkened.\u201cThe Chief Maid confessed she had bought Kronia.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s suspicious eyes turned to the Empress.She shook her shoulders, waving her hands.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty, are you doubting me now? What crazy woman would buy Kronia during her pregnancy.\u201dKronia is a strong drug and it was also known that eating it during one\u2019s pregnancy could cause birth defects.\u201cI asked for a man in the temple.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 lips trembled at the Emperor\u2019s words.One of the other features of Kronia is to capture the absence of tachycardia. And when one consumes Kronia, their stomach gets full of gas, causing it to bloat. Just like the current Empress at 16 weeks pregnant.Depending on the person, it may swell like a full term. So Kronia\u2026 is a drug that can lead to gastrointestinal pregnancy.\u201cYour Imperial Majesty.\u201dThe Empress\u2019s submerged voice scratched the Emperor\u2019s nerves.\u201cIn addition, the temple asked for Alberto\u2019s severe punishment.\u201dThe Empress knew what had happened after hearing the news today.It is said that conclusive evidence came out that Alberto was the instigator behind the attack on an apprentice priestess, who was the Saintess\u2019 entourage at the temple.Alberto obviously said he handled it well, yet he couldn\u2019t even guess what had happened.Even her limbs-like close associates suffered on the hunting ground, and even things like this\u2026 The Empress was almost out of her mind.\u201cThe Count of Mikhael would be expelled completely.\u201d.The Empress opened her eyes wide at those words.\u201cHow dare you towards my family\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I do something wrong, I, the emperor, will pay the price, and shouldn\u2019t the Empress\u2019 family do the same.\u201d\u201cY-Your Imperial Majesty!\u201d\u201cEmpress, prepare to meet the priests tomorrow. They will check your addiction to Kronia and the well-being of the child.\u201dThe Emperor left the red-eyed Empress and turned around, going out as it was.There was only a cool chill in the empty room of the Empress. Her clenched fists were trembling.After a while, a scream that was close to a groan rang out desperately.\u201cAaaaargh!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNoah contacted me saying that the letter was delivered well. And a few days later, I also received Kyle\u2019s reply that he would stop by the temple.\u2018If it\u2019s an enemy that needs to be eliminated anyway, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea for allies to properly unite.\u2019I\u2019ve also had some good news about my efforts recently.It seemed like I had properly drawn a sword from the Deviamon Guild and aimed it at the Empress. Talking about sensitive information about them like that, there\u2019s no way they can leave the Empress alone.\u2018It\u2019s a success in alienation techniques.\u2019And with the information of the Thief\u2019s Guild that I had obtained through Noah, I was able to capture the assassin who infiltrated the temple and attacked Daisy, and was able to obtain evidence of Alberto\u2019s motive.Noah\u2019s work was really great.He got his revenge on Alberto.I went out for a walk in the yard with a light heart.First of all, since the first step has been completed, I thought I\u2019d pay attention to something else for a while. I borrowed Daisy\u2019s ordinary clothes and dressed lightly.Daisy was tasked with making an egg nest.Ciel seems to be competitive with the egg, and he keeps trying to bless me while I am petting the egg.I dug into the slightly gloomy corner I had seen before. And after walking for about 10 minutes, I reached the ruins I had discovered before.There weren\u2019t only places that were managed in the vast temple.There were buildings that looked like abandoned warehouses, and there were also those where only ashes were left.The place in front of me was a small garden. Yet the flowers were all dug up, and the grass was yellow and all dried up. In terms of square footage, it\u2019s a space of two or three square meters.The reason I came here was to test my abilities that had manifested last time.The immense power I saw when I purged the rocks of the hunting ground with Kyle.After taking the pendant off for a moment, I closed my eyes and placed my hand on the dry soil.The effectiveness of the sacred power has been proven many times. I saved dying animals, and I saved dying people.Then what about plants?I felt a huge surge of sacred power and poured it on the ground.Like a liquid going into an empty barrel, it gurgled and got absorbed into the ground.And when my eyes were opened, I unconsciously opened my mouth.\u201cOh my God.\u201dAs expected, the fraudulent ability seemed to be true. The ground before my eyes, which was full of dry grass, became a flower garden.Perhaps the seeds that had fallen on the ground bloomed in a short time. The sacred power heals animals and people, and grows plants.\u201cA flower shop would be fine.\u201dThe more diverse the industry, the better. I imagined my building owner + self-employed life and admired my abilities.As the red sun was setting, I walked down the corridor with Daisy to the outdoor terrace. Because Reihausd asked me to have dinner together today.The moment the door was opened, Reihausd, in a white uniform, stood up.His blonde hair swayed slightly in the gentle breeze, and his golden eyes gleamed red in the sunset light.A choker that didn\u2019t match his uniform, I stared at it for a moment.[The God of Art, Mond, looks at Reihausd with a pleased expression.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, is very fond of his choker.]On the table covered with white cloth, the temple dishes were spread out, which was a little too simple to be called a dinner party.\u201cDid you wait long?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAs I sat down, he did too.After a short greeting, I picked up a spoon and tasted the soup. It was a flavorful crab meat soup that felt hot and warm.A sound of violin was heard from somewhere. Perhaps the priests are playing in the garden?After looking out of the terrace with my eyes for a moment, Reihausd\u2019s voice came into my ear.\u201cThere will be no more blasphemous rumors.\u201dDaisy\u2019s neck has definitely become stiff these days. Now, the voices criticizing me, inside and outside the temple, seemed to have diminished.Last time, I clearly showed holy power in front of people with the Holy Sphere.\u201cI see.\u201dHowever, I wasn\u2019t at peace either. I feel like my place isn\u2019t mine.\u201cOf course, there were distrustful priests who spoke impure words even after they saw your holy power.\u201dHe said as he cut the meat with a knife.\u201cYou won\u2019t feel uncomfortable now that there\u2019s no more.\u201dSuddenly, my gaze shifted to the handle of the scabbard of the long sword, which was always attached to his waist.Who would have imagined that the High Priest with such an angelic appearance had relentless hands.As I remembered how Annie ended, the back of my neck suddenly became cold.He chewed the meat and salad with his red lips. As the popping adam\u2019s apple shook, the choker shook as well.I looked at him as if I was possessed for a moment, then continued eating.\u201cIt\u2019s something I didn\u2019t ask, but suddenly I\u2019m curious.\u201dHis voice was heard again.\u201cWhen did your holy power begin to manifest?\u201dIt was a difficult moment with a question I didn\u2019t really want to answer, but I tried to keep my composure. And I opened my mouth to him with an expressionless face.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long.\u201dSomeday I will have to answer that.\u201cAnd the reason I hid it from Reihausd is\u2026\u201dI even once cheated on the Holy Sphere by purchasing a pendant that hides holy power.\u201cI did develop my holy power, but I didn\u2019t think I was going to be a real saintess.\u201dAt my words, he was staring at me silently.I spoke in a calm tone.\u201cThat thought remains the same to this day.\u201dThen I lifted my fork again and ate the salad.Reihausd didn\u2019t hold the tableware for a long time and opened his lips.\u201cTo think that you still think of yourself as a fake saintess even though you have holy power.\u201dHis low voice rang in my ears.One obviously may think that it doesn\u2019t make sense. Yet his answer was unexpected.\u201cOf course there\u2019s a reason why I think so.\u201d\u201cAnd you won\u2019t tell me why.\u201dA heavy gaze was felt, but I didn\u2019t respond. And after a while, I heard the sound of him raising his knife again.Slice, the meat was being cut. The choker started shaking again.He opened his mouth again.\u201cThank you for being honest. Ariel.\u201dSuddenly, the sound of his voice made my throat tingle.What was Reihausd thinking at this moment, I wondered.I raised my head and looked at his face.\u201cBut apart from being grateful.\u201dThe cold, golden eyes were staring at me. His red lips are sweet and his voice is resolute.\u201cI have no intention of letting you go.\u201dHis eyes were full of obsession, as if I was entangled.\u201cWhen you were a fake saintess with no holy power, and now, nothing has changed.\u201dHis lips formed a smile. It was a beautiful face, yet I felt a subtle creep.\u201cThis is your home. Ariel.\u201dI hurriedly looked down from him and drank from the wine glass. The sour grape scent lingered on the tip of my nose for a long time.He reached out his long finger and touched the choker.\u201cIt means you\u2019re the owner of this temple. And I\u2019m your\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a strong wind blew, shaking the plants on the terrace, and scattering the words formed at the end of his words so that I couldn\u2019t hear them.Like a beast that will bite him if it gets abandoned by its master, he stares at me for a long while, then picks up the tableware and continues to eat.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, reduces the price of the lash to 250 franc.]Ah, that\u2019s enough.It\u2019s enough to only breed the demon egg.I overcame Reihausd\u2019s obsessive gaze and continued to eat. Every time the choker shook, my hand automatically flinched. I think it would have been more preferable for him to be in captivity mode.Rather than those blazing gold eyes begging for things to do with him.\u201cAh, yes. Is it all ready for tomorrow?\u201dI brought up a recent issue to turn the conversation topic around.At my words, Reihausd closed his lips for a moment, thought for a moment, then pulled out his words.\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you once again, but do you really want to go?\u201dI nodded.\u201cStill, it\u2019s His Imperial Majesty\u2019s personal letter.\u201dReihausd said with a firm gaze at my words.\u201cThere are good parts of your change, yet also disadvantages.\u201d\u201cPlease prepare well for tomorrow. Sir Reihausd.\u201dThe Emperor sent me a letter requesting a visit to confirm whether what in the Empress\u2019 womb was a real baby.\u2018The chosen Empress needs Gods\u2019 blessing.\u2019In a plausible phrase.The trap I had set was finally responding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I lifted my head and looked into the eyes of the Emperor.Those dark brown eyes looked a bit hazy these days.\u201cThank\u00a0yew\u00a0for coming.\u201dA slightly hoarse voice came out of the Emperor\u2019s mouth.\u2018Hmm? He feels a little different than usual.\u2019I felt a strange sense of discomfort.\u201cToday the Saintess was called\u2026\u201dThe Emperor coughed once and continued.\u201cTo ask for the Gods\u2019 blessing for the baby in the Empress\u2019 womb.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 cold gaze was directed at me.The atmosphere in the hall was strangely chaotic.\u201cMay the glory of the Gods be with you. To celebrate the meeting, the temple also prepared a small gift. It was made using Kroadium, the Prince-to-be\u2019s birthstone.\u201dI bowed my head once and saluted the Empress.Then I lifted the small, equal-sized sphere that had been given to him by Dwayne.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe servant took it and placed it at the Empress\u2019 feet.\u201cBut the Crown Prince is nowhere to be seen.\u201dI turned my head and looked at the Emperor.Then he gave a worried expression and furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cKyle, that guy\u2026 Where is he, I wonder.\u201dAround the time I frowned and thought that the Emperor was somehow different from usual.The Empress intercepted the Emperor\u2019s words.\u201cThe Crown Prince was busy and couldn\u2019t attend.\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201dThe Emperor nodded his head blankly.I lifted my head and met the Empress\u2019 eyes.Her lips were smiling, yet her eyes were as cold as ice.From the first moment I met the Empress\u2019 eyes, I could confirm that what I expected was right.\u201cLast time, there were many rude things about the fake saintess from Thiago. Saintess.\u201dI replied with a light smile to the Empress\u2019 words.\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that. Today is the day I came to bless Your Imperial Majesty the Empress.\u201dWe were both smiling, but the mood felt as if we were walking on the edge of a knife.Ros\u00e9 raised the corners of her lips at my words, which seemed to gesture to her to get to the point, and continued.\u201cI was told that the Saintess had proved your divine power in the temple. Then\u2026\u201dThe candle, which had flickered in the slight breeze, no longer flickered.At that moment, the sound of Dwayne staggering was heard.I narrowed my eyes and looked at her.Ros\u00e9\u2019s eyebrows were raised.\u201cCould you possibly heal dozens of people who are addicted to unscented and odorless poison at once?\u201dI heard Dwayne collapsed with a thud. I looked behind me to see he was banging his head.\u201cT-This!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s poison!\u201d\u201cCome to your senses!\u201dI heard the guards screaming in surprise.But that\u2019s only for a while. Everyone started swaying one by one. The sound of the pulled swords falling to the floor one by one was heard.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dI glared at Ros\u00e9, trying to keep my mind straight.The Emperor, whose eyes gradually became cloudy, finally closed his eyelids. His head fell to the side.\u201cDid you end up doing something like this?\u201dA cornered rat has few options.Whether to undo the mistakes of the past, or to just go out until the end.And she was definitely the latter.\u201cYou don\u2019t answer my question.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 venomous voice was heard.A person who will somehow trample on others and climb up, rather than fall down because of a false affair full of Kronia.\u201cGasp\u2026\u00a0Ga-asp\u2026\u201dA few of the Guard Knights drew their swords, yet they fell to the floor before they could even approach. The incense had probably spread before I came in.But certain types of scent poison require a trigger to work, and she probably used it to trap me.The Empress slowly rose from her seat. Then, a small empty bottle with a magic circle on it fell as it brushed against the hem of her dress.The bottle is probably designed to react quickly to the scent of poison that fills the air when it\u2019s openedShe bent her back, picked it up, and began to descend the stairs.I sat on my knees, knelt down.\u201cThe Saintess, who had a persistent love for the Crown Prince, was ordered by him and tried to kill the Emperor and Empress with poisonous incense.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 lips moved softly.\u201cIn the process, His Imperial Majesty unfortunately passed away, and the Empress\u2026 The Prince protected her.\u201dShe smiled as she touched her tummy with tenderness.\u201cOur poor prince who protected his mother and became a star.\u201dA ship that had nothing in it, it almost gave me goosebumps.Soon she put the bottle in front of me.\u201cEven if you\u2019re the Saintess, you\u2019re only human, and you can\u2019t stand poison.\u201dHer complexion looked fine alone because she had already drunk the neutralizer.I lifted my head and opened my dry lips as I stared at her.\u201cWhere is the Crown Prince?\u201dThen she smiled as if it were a pity.\u201cYou worry about Kyle until the very end. But don\u2019t worry too much, I\u2019m not going to kill him.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 eyes widened deeply.\u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 blind his eyes by drugging him and seal his aura\u201dIs it a just-developed hatred in those eyes?No, maybe it seemed like a deeper and more desperate feeling.\u201cDid you give the Crown Prince any medicine? Just like His Imperial Majesty?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t difficult to add medicine to the food of the Imperial Palace. Maybe Kyle is with Alberto right now. Ah, ah, Alberto suffered a lot too\u2026 But this time, I\u2019m going to ask you to take all the blame, overturn the temple, and restore that child\u2019s honor. I\u2019m sure your maid, who\u2019s lucky enough to survive, will be killed.\u201dAfter chatting for a while, the Empress turned her back on me.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to live as the Empress at this time.\u201dAnd when she took a few steps, I said.\u201cShe\u2019s not a maid, she\u2019s an apprentice priestess, our Daisy.\u201dThe Empress turned around at the sound of a voice different from before.\u201cI\u2019m saying that if you know it, you should tell me.\u201dAfter I finished acting, I got up from my seat, wiping my hands.\u201cScenario One is amazing.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAt the first hearing of her term and my normal appearance, the empress made her face hard and her lips trembled.\u201cYou, how?!\u201dI shrugged my shoulders and told her.\u201cExcept that this is also a scenario I wrote.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is\u2026?\u201d\u201cWake up. Dwayne, nap time is over.\u201dDwayne, who was pretending to collapse, got up at my words.He looked at me with a fed-up look and said.\u201cAs expected, the Saintess is a very scary person.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, agrees with Dwayne.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And we shared sincere opinions and discussions.\u2018Those who prosper by drugs, perish by drugs.\u2019\u2018Once a cheater, always a cheater.\u2019Kyle frowned at the phrase I had written during that time.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cOnce you take the easy road, it\u2019s hard to get out of it.\u201dHe nodded at the plausible explanation.\u201cWhat I\u2019m a little worried about is the Empress\u2019 future move.\u201d\u201cWe plan to narrow the range of options.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dHaving lived in an era in which trap investigations were illegal, Kyle and I had a different framework of thinking.\u201cI recruited one of the two remaining close entourages of the Empress. He\u2019s the Empress\u2019 cousin, and if we let his family be safe, he\u2019ll cooperate.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\u201cI own the right top.\u201dIf her entourage had a \u2018very effective poison\u2019, what would the Empress do?As I thought about it, the nape of my neck went cold.\u201cLike you\u2019re inducing evil deeds.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Empress\u2019 choice to choose which one.\u201dKyle was right, we could narrow her options from tens of thousands to only two.One is to correct mistakes, the other is to harm others.\u201cI read a book about poisonous weed.\u201dAmong the various information I obtained from the temple library, there was also information about herbal medicine.\u201cHow about disguising a paralytic poison as a poisonous incense?\u201dAfter a while, a cold smile appeared on Kyle\u2019s lips as the words came out of my mouth.\u201cUnlike the person who told me I was inducing evil.\u201dHis red eyes stared intently at me.\u201cIt\u2019s a detailed plan more villainous than a villain.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, agrees with Kyle.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, expresses a deep affection for you.]I grumbled a little at the undeniable words.\u201cI have a specific life motto that my well-being comes first.\u201dIf I leave the Empress as it is, my safety will be increasingly threatened.As he looked at me and smiled, I heard his voice.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re a talent more suited to the Imperial Palace than the temple.\u201dI pretended not to hear him and asked what his next plan was.\u201cBut Your Highness\u2026\u201dThen, a knock was heard, and the door to the small meeting room of the temple opened. The person who came in was Reihausd.\u201cI was told that His Highness was coming, so I hurriedly stopped by.\u201d\u201cAh, Sir Reihausd.\u201dI got up from my seat in bewilderment, yet his voice interrupted me and fell on the small meeting room.\u201cI must\u2019ve told you last time.\u201dHis gaze turned to Kyle, but it wasn\u2019t a disrespectful or angry voice.\u201cThe Saintess is a person of the temple, so private conversations about the Saintess\u2019 well-being\u2026\u201dThe corners of Reihausd\u2019s red lips twitched.\u201c\u2026Shouldn\u2019t you share it with me as well?\u201d***\u201cDid I drink the neutralizer before? How do you know!!\u201dThe Empress\u2019 face darkened.Me, Dwayne, and the Empress. It\u2019s a 2 to 1 situation.The Empress quickly took another bottle out of her clothes. Perhaps another poisonous incense she had prepared as a precaution, what a well-prepared person.She quickly opened the bottle.Yet her face hardened as she saw us standing still after a few seconds.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. And that\u2019s not poisonous incense.\u201dI also pointed to the bottle rolling on the floor.\u201cThat one, too.\u201dThen the Empress opened her eyes wide.\u201cIt\u2019s a paralyzing poison. The Guard Knights and His Imperial Majesty will wake up in an hour.\u201dAt my words, she started to take a step back, as if in disbelief.\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dHer lips trembled.\u201cNo way. It can\u2019t be\u2026 .\u201dSurprised by the subject who tried to annihilate everyone here and live alone.I stared at her with a sneer.At that time, the door of the hall that had been closed opened, and Paladins, the Imperial Knights, led by High Priest Reihausd, began to pour in.They saw the situation in the hall and surrounded us.Reihausd\u2019s gaze was felt from the back of my head.The Empress, who was trembling and unable to come to her senses, cried out as she looked at the Imperial Knights.\u201cThe Saintess has made a trick! Surround them!\u201dIt was a bit of a misleading situation.The Guard Knights were down, the Emperor had lost his mind, then the Empress and I were standing. And also only Dwayne.It\u2019s true that it\u2019s hard to guess that a single, powerless Empress could have created such a situation.\u201cThe Saintess was instigated by Prince Kyle and tried to put everyone to sleep and then kill them by using a paralyzing poison! With this Paladin!!The Empress shouted, and she tried to frame us instead.Dwayne\u2019s grunting was heard behind me.\u201cNo, why me\u2026\u201dAnd according to the gesture of the Commander of the Imperial Knights, who was watching the situation, the Imperial Knights drew their swords.As soon as they did that, the Paladins also did the same, aiming at the Imperial Knights.The two forces of equal number faced each other with their swords pointed at each other, and the situation in the hall created a tension enough to see blood at any moment.At that moment, Reihausd, with his cool eyes, began to walk.[You mean to see you in danger?]At first, he was fiercely opposed, but I managed to persuade him that a third party was needed outside of this situation.He walked between the Imperial Knights and Paladins who were aiming swords at each other, then the knights flinched and opened the way at the vivid energy emanating from him.As soon as he reached me, he passed by me, passed by the Empress, who retreated in fear, and climbed up to the Emperor\u2019s side. And bowing down, he picked up the sphere, the meeting gift I had given to the Empress.The Empress\u2019 eyebrows could be seen moving.As Reihausd energized the sphere, the Empress\u2019 face began to turn white. A familiar voice began to be heard from the sphere embracing holy power.[The Saintess, who had a persistent love for the Crown Prince, was ordered by him and tried to kill the Emperor and Empress with poisonous incense.][In the process, His Imperial Majesty unfortunately passed away, and the Empress\u2026 The Prince protected her.][Our poor prince who protected his mother and became a star.]The Empress\u2019 voice resounded in a high volume and could be heard in the entire hall.The knights began to gossip in surprise.\u201cN-No\u2026\u201dThe Empress shook her head and stepped back from me. But it was her own voice that was unmistakably audible.[Even if you\u2019re the Saintess, you\u2019re only human, and you can\u2019t stand poison.]Reihausd\u2019s low-pitched voice continued to be heard.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the precious voice recorder that was presented to the Empress from the temple would be used in this way.\u201dHis gold eyes were full of bloodlust toward the Empress.The Empress\u2019 pupils trembled. And immediately, the Commander of the Imperial Knights rang out.\u201cProtect His Imperial Majesty and seize the Empress!\u201dThe knights immediately poured out and arrested the Empress.She struggled, yet she couldn\u2019t resist the power of the knights.\u201cNo! It\u2019s all a conspiracy from that bitch!\u201dHer venomous eyes were staring at me until the very end.Anyway, things have been sorted out.I turned around without responding to the Empress\u2019 screams. And I tried to approach Reyhath, who was still engulfed in a cold bloodlust.Suddenly, a group of men came in with harsh footsteps.At the sharp wind, I staggered back and turned.I could see the slightly disheveled red hair, the red eyes blazing like the flames of hell, and the blood-covered uniform of the Crown Prince, and the blood-drenched blue blade.As if he was the Demon King from the Demon Realm, a dark red aura was blooming around him.\u201cKyle.\u201dI bit my dry lips and muttered his name.The final organizer of this situation appeared in time.His red eyes were focused only on the Empress.The Empress, who had rebelled wildly, stopped and stared blankly at him. Her eyes shook violently.Thud. From his right hand, something unrecognizable fell to the floor and rolled like a ball.As I set my eyes on it, I realized it was a human head after a while.Oh, my Gods.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, covers his eyes.][The God of Art, Mond, curses at swords and wielding things because they have no dignity.]The knights removed their hand from the Empress\u2019 arms for a moment, and she covered her mouth with her hands.\u201cEmpress.\u201dKyle\u2019s cold voice was heard.\u201cI brought your long-awaited brother.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 face was drained of blood as Alberto\u2019s miserable head rolled and stopped slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even my little brother!!\u201dHot tears flowed down her pale cheeks.\u201c\u2026The number of innocents you and Alberto killed after you became the Empress is seventeen.\u201dKyle spoke to her with an expressionless face.\u201cThe number of innocents you killed before you became the Empress is eight.\u201dIf I hadn\u2019t saved Noah and Daisy, the two would have been added. If I had saved Tina, who came as a fake saintess, it would have lessened by one.Kyle\u2019s cold voice echoed through the hall.\u201cAs of today, Alberto Mikhael\u2019s evil deeds are over.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 distorted eyes shook.\u201cAnd so are yours.\u201dHer disheveled hair was a mess.\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t know my suffering.\u201dA hoarse sound escaped from her parted lips.\u201cYou ruined everything for me, Kyle\u2026 Curse you.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 bloody eyes were tenaciously directed at Kyle.I stared into her eyes.Even if she was a villain, why the hell did she have to do this?It was when I was wondering.[The God of Love, Odyssey, responds to you.]At that moment, I suddenly felt her feet rise.The eyes of the Empress suddenly approached and I felt as if she had entered her eyes. Then suddenly the surroundings that were dark eventually started to light up.I looked around, and faintly heard the banquet music in my ears.[Your Highness The Crown Prince. This\u2026 You dropped this.]When I turned my eyes at the young voice, it was the Empress, no, Ros\u00e9.I flinched in surprise, but it seemed as if I couldn\u2019t be seen in her eyes.Her face looked much younger than now. Perhaps it was in the past before marriage.And the man receiving the pocket watch\u2026 was Kyle.Although he looked shorter, his red hair and eyes revealed that he was Kyle.[Thank you.]It was such a blunt answer that the listener would be embarrassed..Yet Ros\u00e9 looked at Kyle, who turned around after receiving the pocket watch as if that was enough, for a long time.She muttered as she looked at Kyle\u2019s back.[Someday I will\u2026 I will be standing next to him. Just like the oracle I was told by the Saintess when I was thirteen.]Her eyes were sparkling like jewels.Seeing the bright red cheeks, I opened my eyes wide, thinking,\u00a0no way.The scene unfolding in front of me suddenly changed.[Among the ladies of the noble families, who is suitable to be the Empress? After the death of the deceased Empress, it seems that her seat can no longer be empty for the sake of the stability of the country.]The dark place was the Emperor\u2019s audience hall. And in front of him stood Kyle, who had become a mature young man.[I think Ros\u00e9, the eldest daughter of Count Mikhael\u2026 would be most suitable. I have heard that her brother has a bad reputation, but that her own behavior is good.]The Emperor had a thoughtful expression on his face.And Kyle opened his mouth again.[I know that Ros\u00e9 received an oracle from the Saintess when she was a child. That she will become a member of the Imperial Family in the future\u2026][Hoo, I see!]And outside the door of the audience hall where the audience was being held, something fell.The woman standing with a dazed expression was Ros\u00e9, and the thing falling was a handkerchief she embroidered on her own with Kyle\u2019s name on it.Darkness was gradually creeping into her eyes.[Ha\u2026]I couldn\u2019t stop wondering.Should I call this a joke of fate?[How could\u2026 Your Highness be like this?]The next scene was a certain hallway.The red sunset was illuminating the faces of the two, a man and a woman. Kyle opened his mouth with a terribly blunt expression on his face.[What do you mean?][I\u2019ve never been married to anyone\u2026]Tears welled up in her desperate eyes.[Because I believed in the oracle. That will be married to the Imperial Family!]Kyle didn\u2019t hide his annoyed expression towards her, who was about to cry, and spoke firmly.[The oracle has come true, is there any problem?]At those words, her eyes violently shook.The painful sense of reality and the denial that this couldn\u2019t be the case. Deep despair and pain stood in her eyes.After a while, a fierce reaction swelled in her hazy eyes. Her clenched fists were trembling.[You have brutally slaughtered my world. Very cruelly\u2026]However, Kyle was just staring at Ros\u00e9. With a consistently indifferent look.[Someday\u2026]Her voice was hoarse.Ros\u00e9 looked at Kyle with dark eyes full of hostility and said.[You will regret it, Kyle.]A cold dew was forming in her eyes. And at that moment my feet fell off the floor again, I was back in the present.She was a villain, but the story I saw was a deep tragedy.As I looked at her, not knowing what to say, she suddenly used both hands to grab the blade of a knight\u2019s sword standing next to her. Then, without a scream, she shoved it into her chest.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI was so startled that I couldn\u2019t even make a sound.\u201cY-Your Imperial Majesty the Empress!\u201dThe bewildered knight hurriedly pulled out the sword stuck in her chest.Her dress was stained with dark red blood.Drip. Dark red blood flowed from Ros\u00e9\u2019s lips.I had been calm all along, even when Alberto\u2019s head rolled around, and now my heart was pounding like crazy.\u201c\u2026Ariel.\u201dKyle\u2019s voice barely made me come to my senses when I saw him.His red eyes were still burning with cold rage.\u201cShe is a woman who shouldn\u2019t escape her crimes in this way.\u201dDark bloodlust fluttered behind him.\u201cShe shook the pillars of the Empire, tried to assassinate His Imperial Majesty\u2026\u201dHis low voice rang in my ears.\u201cShe killed my people.\u201dRos\u00e9\u2019s eyelids shook, and blood poured out again.\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t die so easily. I don\u2019t want you to try to save her.\u201dIt seemed like he was saying it because he was afraid I would save her.I shifted my gaze to Ros\u00e9.Her eyes were directed at me. Her bloody hands would no longer have the strength to drive the sword deep.\u201c\u2026\u201dReihausd was staring at me with deep eyes.Why did Odyssey show me those scenes?I stood for a moment and thought.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dI opened my lips and let out a voice.Kyle\u2019s gaze was on me.His eyes, full of hatred and bloodlust, were as eerie as the devil. She, who was dying helplessly, was also looking at me.I was the only one who held Ros\u00e9\u2019s right to escape from death here. That fact weighed heavily on my mind like crazy, but I had decided.\u201cI won\u2019t save her.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyebrows wiggled at my words that broke the silence.I looked straight into his red eyes.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to let her die like this.\u201dI confronted him as I looked into his eyes, who was ready to draw his sword at any moment.Until she completely stopped breathing.Her eyelashes, which were trembling, fell down.I could save people.But it wasn\u2019t my area to save someone who wanted to die. Even if there is a reason why she shouldn\u2019t die like this.The decision not to save one is as heavy a decision as to save one. I just stood silently. It was far from my eyes, but comfort-like words came to my mind.[The God of Love, Odyssey, stands behind you.]I could see the blood fading from her pale skin.The sparsely exhaled breaths widened, and as she exhaled her last breath once, she was immersed in the sea of eternal rest. With a selfishly calm expression on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How dare she think of plotting a rebellion.\u201dThe Count of Mikhael was devastated and the Empress\u2019 faction completely collapsed. Except for the Empress\u2019 second cousin, who was hired by Kyle to help with this.\u201cOnly the baby in her belly who died together is pitiful. Really.\u201dDaisy let out a small sigh.The Empress\u2019 body was immediately incinerated, and the truth wasn\u2019t known to anyone. That the child in her womb was fake.It was the decision of the Imperial Family, fearing that the country would be overturned once again if that fact was known.\u201cI also heard that His Imperial Majesty was also bedridden because of it, that can\u2019t be happening but, whatever.\u201dThe Empress\u2019 faction was uprooted, and the listed priests who had internal communication with them were also handed over. Among them, most of the priests sent to the Imperial Palace were all treated according to the strict new law.The latest examination of priests revealed that the Emperor had been poisoned for quite some time.In addition to the Kronia the Empress was taking, she used several dark drugs to manipulate the Emperor.And after the death of the Empress, the emperor, having learned all that had happened, lay in bed.I tried to heal the Emperor with sacred power, but I found out that the sickness of a heart couldn\u2019t be cured even with that. Even if I poured holy energy into his weakened body, he didn\u2019t have the will to absorb it properly.\u201cHave you not received a message from the High Priest yet?\u201dAt my words, Daisy nodded her head sullenly.A fortnight has passed since that incident.The day after returning to the temple, Reihausd received a letter and hurriedly left for somewhere.With only Dwayne accompanying him, saying he has something to investigate.\u201cHigh-ranking priests are demanding an explanation of this situation\u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m really mad. The person who has the most difficulty right now is the Saintess. They have to give you time to chill.\u201dDaisy continued.\u201cThe High Priest also\u2026 He\u2019s too much to leave the temple empty for ten days at a time like this.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go get some wind.\u201dI thought it was going to be okay, and I walked the corridor with Daisy.Priests and priestesses who were passing by and saw me, stopped and bowed their heads.White Rotunia swayed in the distant garden.I kept walking and came out of the temple. And it was time to take a few more steps to see Rotunia.A familiar voice was heard.\u201cAriel.\u201dI slowly turned my head.Red hair fluttered in the light breeze. The color of his eyes in the sun looked a little darker than usual.However, his strong shoulders, tall stature, and a long sword shackle hanging from his waist were creating a sense of intimidation as always.I saw a man behind him, but I turned to look at Kyle and bowed my head slightly.\u201cMay the blessings of the Nine Gods rest upon you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dMy dress moved and there was a sound.His face, covered in blood and anger, overlapped for a moment with his clean face, but I shook off the afterimage.Instead of the Emperor who was recuperating, it\u2019s said that it was his duty to act in the place of the Emperor. Now the whole country was his.\u201cI came to see you.\u201dHe suddenly came up to me and raised his hand slowly.The tip of Daisy\u2019s blonde hair brushed his hand. The tingling sensation that almost touched me made me nervous.Soon his bright red eyes looked at me and said.\u201cThere is something I want to ask you. Why didn\u2019t you save her that day?\u201dHis words lingered in my ears.I opened my mouth as I looked at the swaying petals of Rotunia.\u201cYou really didn\u2019t know?\u201dAt my words, he stared at me with his eyebrows hardened. He looked as if he had no idea.Kyle had no interest in relationships with women. But if Ros\u00e9 had said that much, at least a little bit of tact\u2026\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe Empress\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Haa. Nevermind.\u201dHe seemed like a man who wouldn\u2019t even notice the slightest bit, so I decided not to talk.After all, it\u2019s the past, and knowing the truth won\u2019t change anything, so maybe I should keep this as a secret that only I know.\u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t save him was because of the Gods\u2019 will.\u201d\u201c\u2026The Gods\u2019 will.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes became complicated and subtle.\u201cI\u2019m the Saintess. Doing the Gods\u2019 will is my priority.\u201dOdyssey showed such a flashback scene, so it was really a God\u2019s will.It was a pity to have the Empress, who committed such a bad thing, die gracefully, but it was still the last wish of the dying.\u201cI see.\u201dI continued looking at him between his nicely folded brows.\u201cHow is His Imperial Majesty?\u201d\u201cStill not good.\u201dA warm wind blew.A gentle breeze, as if the terrible situation of that day was a lie. We stood precariously between the rolling heads, blood, and pressure.\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. The reason His Imperial Majesty is in the sickbed is because of the Empress.\u201dI looked up at Kyle and said.\u201cIt\u2019s not Your Highness\u2019 fault.\u201dHis eyebrows wiggled.\u201cWe need to make sure who is at fault.\u201dAfter staring at me for a while, a faint smile crossed his lips and then disappeared.After a while, I heard his voice.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m also glad you looked brave.\u201dI nodded and smiled.Even so, I was quite strong and possessed a personality with a lot of self-rationalization.\u201cA strong wick is a trait suitable even within the Imperial Palace.\u201dEven his jokes are scary.The temple is enough for my makeshift kennel.I spoke up to change the subject.\u201cThe weather is really nice today. The blue sky over there\u2026\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, is doing his best.]Then at that moment, the sky suddenly became cloudy and it started to get dark.As there was only silence in the awkwardness, Kyle, who suddenly glanced up at the sky, continued.\u201cThank you.\u201dI was quietly listening to the unfamiliar words, which were making me shy for no reason. My mouth was dry.\u201cFor letting her die. For preventing me\u2026 from becoming a real monster.\u201dAt his words, I stared blankly at him.He looked different from usual. Would I say he is a lonely, untamed beast?\u201c\u2026Nevermind.\u201dI looked away from him and wiggled my hands.\u201cAs expected, I\u2026\u201dAnd Kyle\u2019s low voice.\u201cI think I will be visiting the temple more often in the future.\u201dThe moment I heard those words, my heart was pounding for some reason. And the status window started flashing.[An emergency meeting of the Gods was held about adopting Kyle Alexis Illide as son-in-law.][The God of Art, Mond, fiercely opposes.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, demeans those who wield swords, saying that they are really useless.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, bites Hessed\u2019s leg.][The God of Love, Odyssey, is eating corn crackers.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, rises on the podium and gains attention.][In fairness, he proposes to take all three as concubines.][A majority of the Gods agree.]\u201cStop it!\u201dWatching the flickering chat window, I screamed involuntarily. I thought it was going to be weird.Kyle asked, frowning.\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dOnly then did I come to my senses and look up at Kyle again.\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cAnyway, now that Her Imperial Majesty the Empress has passed away, the reason why you will often visit the temple\u2026\u201dHowever his voice pierced my ears.\u201cSince some day, when I see you, something comes to my mind.\u201d\u201cPardon? What are you thinking?\u201dWithout realizing it, the end of my voice trembled a little.\u201cEverything has a reason.\u201dThat voice coldly penetrated my abyss. His eyes were glimmering on me.\u201cThere must be a reason why you became such a different person.\u201dA cold voice pierced my heart.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, is interested in Kyle\u2019s sharpness.]\u201cI\u2019m very curious about you.\u201dSword Masters are skilled in Chi, that\u2019s why they have good sensitivity.\u201cHow would you react if our common enemy was gone and I was still curious about you?\u201dI stared blankly at his red lips and finally came to my senses.It\u2019s time to end the increasingly dangerous conversation.\u201cI, I\u2026 Now I\u2019m going to have to go inside. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been under the sun, so I\u2019m dizzy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019re running away in a roundabout way.\u201dI turned away from his gaze, which was silently staring at me, and made a calm voice.\u201cYour Highness, please go back as soon as possible. Don\u2019t you feel uncomfortable going on an outing like this when you have a lot of national affairs?\u201dHe let out a sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s always like this.\u201dBeing barely close is enough.The positive aspect had to be put in for the real relationship of the original story. I don\u2019t know if the original story has any more meaning, though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A handsome face, white skin, and contrasting red lips.His shoulders are broad and he\u2019s a little shorter than Kyle, but he\u2019s on the tall side anyway. Is he in his early 20s?When I tried to stand sideways, he also took a step to the side.Then I moved to the other side, and he moved the same way.What is he doing now?I frowned a little and said to him.\u201cWould you mind getting out of my way?\u201dBut he didn\u2019t move, and instead showed a soft smile.\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed.\u201dIt was a soft smile, yet somehow my spine was cold.A sense of dread that had been in place for a while.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t recognize me.\u201dHis voice rang in my ears.The moment I thought,\u00a0who was it, a chat window flickered in front of my eyes.[The connection with the oracle will be disconnected.]What?I didn\u2019t even press disable, but my connection with the Gods was cut off.Confused, I licked my lips again.\u201cWill you remember if you see this?\u201dAnd as he clenched his fist once and opened it again, a silver coin with a murky light flashed in his palm.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI took a breath in surprise.Now I know who he is.The Guild Leader of the Deviamon Magician Guild!Then, behind my back, another move touched me.\u201cWhat business do you have in the temple? Baron.\u201dAt that, I opened my eyes wide.Baron? The head of the Deviamon Guild is a baron?The man frowned and slowly turned his gaze to Kyle.\u201cI have come to investigate the case for the collapse of the annex of the temple because it\u2019s being finalized.\u201d\u201cThe Lord yourself?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a request from the High Priest, so I have to do this much.\u201dKyle nodded his head and spoke.\u201cIt seems that the saying that Vester built the temple easily is a rumor.\u201dThose words pierced my ears.Wait a minute. Vester?\u2018If it\u2019s Vester\u2026 Diego Vester? That villain?!\u2019\u201cThere were times when we briefly bumped into each other for a while, but now magicians and priests are getting along well. Wouldn\u2019t it be wise to respect each other\u2019s territory?\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, his purple eyes turned towards me. My heart was beating like crazy.***After sending the two men go, my mind was confused.Diego Vester.One of the rulers of the Demon Realm and the villain of the novel.I found the man, whom I never wanted to run into, on my own!And I was tired of pretending to be enchanted.At that time, I was wearing a holy relic that hides my power, so he wouldn\u2019t have recognized me, but\u2026 I could tell that he had just recognized me again.\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone in.\u201dI said to Daisy as I entered the room.There were two old books about the \u2018Devil Realm\u2019 that I borrowed from the library.Both of them were officially non-existent books, but reading these books over the past few days helped me understand a little about the Demon Realm.In the Demon Realm, there is a Demon King and Demon Princes who are its subordinates. Aside from that, many nobles, ordinary demons, and even insignificant demons form a pyramid-shaped hierarchical society.Of course, they weren\u2019t large compared to human society, but they were a threat to the extent that everyone could use black magic.In the original story, Diego is the successor of Demon King Leto and a powerful magic duke.He is living as \u2018Baron Diego Vester\u2019 in the human world, but his true identity was like that.\u2018Why did he have to be the Guild Leader of Deviamon Guild!\u2019Damn it.Had I known he was Diego, I would never have put such an irrational number.\u201cThe Saintess\u2019 bedroom is quite comfortable.\u201dAs I desperately opened another thick book, I suddenly heard a voice from behind, breaking my little relief.I jumped up in surprise.\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt is true that if you\u2019re too surprised, your voice won\u2019t come out.As I was staring at him with my big eyes, frozen, he gave me a light smile.\u201cYou\u2019re also raising a cute egg that appears to have been purchased from the Pennsyl Guild.\u201dDangerous purple eyes. There was a man who shouldn\u2019t be in this room.\u201cAh, don\u2019t shout. It will only hurt your neck.\u201dIt felt like my goosebumps were standing still, but I clenched my fists to regain my composure.The coolness returned after a while.I repeated what he had said, and I knew that perhaps by some trick he had done, my noise wouldn\u2019t be heard outside.\u201cYou tried to use Deviamon to expel the Empress.\u201dIt must have been because of Diego\u2019s influence that the oracle had been disconnected until now.\u201cThe penalty for deceiving me by pretending to be enchanted\u2026\u201dHe took one step, two steps closer to me.\u201cI\u2019m worried about how you should receive it.\u201dI said to him, barely hiding my fear.\u201cI understand you\u2019re angry. I would have done the same.\u201dHis eyes darkened at my words.\u201cThe Empress was completely ousted. I later found out that there was no name Celestine around the Empress.\u201dHe narrowly placed my index finger on my lips.\u201cBut to see you again at the temple like this.\u201dHis low voice rang in my ears.\u201cShould I call this a harvest, or\u2026 should I call it fate?\u201dWhether it was malice or magic, an ominous energy enveloped me.\u201cThat you, who deceived me, is that Saintess.\u201dHis purple pupils contained deep curiosity.\u201cWhy did I only know now?\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying.\u201cOracle activation.\u201dI looked at him and spoke over and over again. Of course, I fully understand why he\u2019s angry with me, but I\u2019m a person who puts my safety first.\u201cIf you come any closer, you will get hurt.\u201dAnd a chat window flashed in front of me.[The oracle is activated.]However, unlike usual, the oracle window wasn\u2019t clear and flickered continuously.Still, I focused as much as I could.Seeing the window flickering, I could guess how strong his magic was.There was interest in his eyes.\u201cMy goodness.\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, roars.]A white light began to form on my hand again.\u201cI have never seen a saintess with a pillar.\u201dHe mumbled something incomprehensible.\u201cEveryone was a puppet tying up strings, yet you stand on your own two feet.\u201dI reached out to him as if I were healing. Then a warm light shone on him like a ray of light.It was because the thought that it might be a healing power for humans but an attack for demons came to my mind like an instinct.Diego stretched out his right hand, black darkness pouring out of his hand, colliding with the light.Whether it worked or not, his darkness didn\u2019t come close to me. It wasn\u2019t the magic of ordinary magicians, it was a black magic called Magi.His fine eyebrows trembled slightly.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but people can\u2019t always win and live.\u201dI blatantly advised him.\u201cYou get to know the world by getting hit in the back of your head once or twice.\u201d[The God of Love, Odyssey, is curious about the relationship between you and Diego.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, speaks of his reasoning.]Although the Gods were wary of Diego, they were reasoning about his relationship with me. And soon my light began to engulf his darkness.No matter how strong his power is, this is the temple.The house of the Gods, the realm of the Gods.\u201cSo, just coolly forget about the last time.\u201dOne step, two steps, he started backing away. But his eyes were as relaxed as if he were dreaming, and his voice was monotonous.\u201cCelestine\u2026 . Ariel Celestine.\u201dI suddenly shrugged at my full name.\u201cI have just decided to regard this meeting as fate.\u201dMy light almost engulfed his darkness, and he finally smiled faintly as his back touched the window.\u201cLet\u2019s take it slow. There\u2019s plenty of time.\u201dHis voice crept into my ears.\u201cWe will see each other again soon.\u201dAnd in an instant, his body disappeared. As if he wasn\u2019t there from the beginning.My holy power, lost in its way, hit the windowpane and scattered like glitter in the air.My hand was looking for its color again. The status window in front of me flashed.I let out a small sigh. And to the Gods who were curious, I told the whole story. Even secretly finding the Black Magic Guild and meeting Diego.After a while, the oracle window appeared.[The Gods are holding an emergency meeting.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But I couldn\u2019t see what it was.I stood blankly and sat down on the bed.\u2018In addition to the Gods and the three male leads, even the villain took an interest in me.\u2019I don\u2019t know what kind of interest it is, but it\u2019s true that it\u2019s ominous anyway. And I felt that my peaceful dream life was getting farther away.[The Gods have finished the emergency meeting.][They have decided that they have something to show you.]And at that moment, my hand lit up, and a small butterfly came out of it.With my eyes wide open, I looked at the fluttering wings of a butterfly shining like a Tinkerbell.What is\u2026 this?A butterfly flapped its wings. As if it wanted me to follow it.I started to follow the butterfly.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen I opened the door, many people, including Daisy, were lying on the floor.Startled, I ran to Daisy, put my hand on her chest, and I could tell that she was breathing.\u201c\u2026\u201dI looked at the butterfly again, hardening my eyebrows.I think it\u2019s a trick of the gods\u2026 But do they have to kill innocent people? Perhaps they were resting for a while.I started walking again after the butterfly.It was eerie to see people lying asleep in a quiet temple.I continued walking after the butterfly. And at some point the butterfly stopped in front of a large door.\u201cHere is\u2026\u201dIt was Reihausd\u2019s office.Naturally, it was closed, and as I stood still, I heard a creaking sound of something unraveling.Although reluctant, I raised my hand and placed it on the handle.It felt like heavy iron. Pulling on the hook, the door opened with difficulty, and the butterfly went straight into the gap.I, too, followed the butterfly into the office.The spacious office was decorated with some sacred objects, and a neatly organized desk and a living room were also provided. A fresh scent lingered on the tip of my nose, perhaps because of the plants on the window sill.The butterfly fluttered and flew in front of his little study. My gaze naturally went toward it.On one side of the study were books that couldn\u2019t be found in the temple library.Old books that look like they are hundreds of years old. Among them, the butterfly reached out and touched one of the books in the center, and the butterfly disappeared into the powder of light.I picked it up and placed it on the desk.As I turned over the dark green leather cover, a lot of letters came in. And the chat window in front of my eyes flickered.[Oracle LV4 is opened with the unique power of the Gods.][The power of the Gods can no longer be used to raise the oracle level.]And immediately the chat window flashed.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, uses \u2018Instinct\u2019 on you.]When the oracle was first opened, Hessed tried to use it, but it was a feature that could not be used due to the low level.In an instant, the letters of the book began to rush toward me like waves.They consisted mostly of ciphers. It is an irregular code that is impossible to interpret.[The God of Art, Mond, uses \u2018Response\u2019 on you.]However, when Mond\u2019s Response began, the situation changed.The ciphers began to be listed in the form of pictures. A screen unfolded in front of me, and the puzzles began to fit together.\u201cThe temple?\u201dThe only recognizable characters were that, and the rest were spread out before my eyes as imaged materials.There was a beautiful woman.A woman with platinum blonde hair who was wearing a beautiful dress.Her surroundings were shining with a holy light. And there were three men around her.One man was holding a scale, the other was wearing a crown and holding a long sword.Another man was wearing a priest\u2019s uniform and holding his hands together. And opposite them, there was darkness.A man with two devil horns holding an apple and a lot of demons behind him.The man with the devil\u2019s horns reached out to the woman, and the woman was embraced by the devil.Shackles began to wrap around the necks of the three men.And at that moment, the three men turned to ashes and began to disappear.The woman with blonde hair\u2019s clothes turned black, and her lips twisted wickedly.The world began to fall into darkness.I woke up from my emotions and looked at the book again. Its letters were disappearing.What the hell is this?While watching that amazing scene, the window in front of me started to glow.[The God of Justice, Hetuse, enters your oracle.][Garden 6/6][\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, who couldn\u2019t enter the oracle, takes over the mat of Hetuse.]They were Gods with a somewhat contradictory mood.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, welcomes the God of Justice, Hetuse.]The two seem to be close because they are similar.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, demeans Hetuse, saying it\u2019s a cross.][The God of Art, Mond, is a bit disappointed when he learns the identity of the newbie.]This side didn\u2019t seem very friendly.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Can you tell me what you just showed me?\u201d[The God of Love, Odyssey, introduces three candidates to the new God.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, presents Kyle\u2019s videosphere to Hetuse as a gift and opens a business.]Well. I don\u2019t think now is the time to open the male leads business.I sighed and waited a little longer, yet they didn\u2019t explain anything further.What I felt while watching the oracle was that once the flow went in a certain direction, there was no turning back.And for some reason, the Gods didn\u2019t give plausible information through the oracle.\u201cPlease take care of me. The newly arrived God.\u201dIn the end, I slightly bowed to the God who entered my oracle.What does the video I just saw mean?Up to the beginning, it seemed to be similar to the contents of the original story I had read. Saintess Camilla wins the love of three men, and is in a noble position\u2026But what follows is a story that can only be described as ominous.Could the man with the devil\u2019s two horns have something to do with Diego?His words still linger in my mind.[That you, who deceived me, is that Saintess\u2026]My mind was complicated. The feeling of being handed a piece of a complicated secret.[We will see each other again soon.]I shook my head. There was nothing to jump to conclusions yet.***Reihausd returned three days later. He was pale and injured.As soon as he returned to the temple, he took 24 hours off, and it was the next day when I saw him again.Even in the morning he didn\u2019t look very well. One of his arms was wrapped in bandages.Of course, there are also blind Gods.[The God of Art, Mond, likes his disheveled top.]Contrary to his usual uniform, his tight chest was half exposed, although he looked rather decadent.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dI looked down at him with a worried expression on his tired face.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you rest a little more? You look very tired.\u201dIt was the first time he had ever shown himself like this. The choker around his neck swayed dangerously.\u201cMaster, no, Saintess.\u201dHe seemed a little confused as to whether he was really in a bad state.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cI visited Ares Mine.\u201dAres was the largest mineral and magic stone production area in the Empire. In the original story, it was described as Camilla\u2019s hometown.\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you the reason as I left in a hurry.\u201dReihausd\u2019s voice flowed.I wondered why came back injured and he left the temple in a hurry not long after he had recovered.\u201cI wish everything was in my prediction.\u201dHis face looked quite dark.Feeling strangely ominous, I asked him.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThe gate of the Devildom has exploded in Ares Mine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It means that the two worlds that should have been separated were connected by a small gap.\u201dI suddenly remembered the explanation I heard in Ren and Van\u2019s space.This world and the Demon Realm were in completely different directions.And according to the book I borrowed from the library after sending Diego away, it was said that only the Demon Princes with powerful powers could influence the world by dealing with humans.It can\u2019t descend directly without a medium, and even if it descends, its power is very limited, but it is sufficiently threatening.\u201cThe Magi that flowed out of Ares was very concentrated.\u201dReihausd stared at me with clear golden eyes and said.\u201cAnd Demon Beasts are coming out of the mine and attacking private houses.\u201dIt was a surprising story. Although monsters influenced by magic become violent, monsters are different from Demon Beasts. It was a little dangerous, but it could exist on the ground.However, Demon Beasts were literally creatures of the Demon Realm.It\u2019s concentrating demonic energy, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s even more dangerous to humans.It was even more dangerous in that there was no investigation into Demon Beasts.\u201cHow is the situation?\u201dReihausd answered my question with a serious expression.\u201cThe entire coal mining town with about 200 people was annihilated.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cFortunately, we were able to seize the mine with Ares\u2019 Paladins, and now we\u2019re gathering priests from Artis and Henna near Ares to maintain a barrier around the gate.\u201dIt was a fortunate story.\u201cThe problem was that the damage was great. Some priests were dragged into the gate.\u201dBut when I heard his next words, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cHow are they?\u201d\u201cI still don\u2019t know if they\u2019re alive or dead. I can only remember their noble sacrifices.\u201d\u201cIf the Demon Beasts come out, can\u2019t we go in too? We can go in and\u2026\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201dReihausd firmly cut me off.Yeah, I knew it was something impossible.Even if I only recall the intense Magi that Diego Vester exuded, going to save them would be a meaningless death.\u201c\u2026Is the barrier well maintained?\u201dAfter trying to regain my composure, I asked him.\u201cAs soon as we arrived, we sent high-ranking priests. Paladins were also reinforced, and I reported the situation to the Crown Prince.\u201dReihausd\u2019s eyes darkened.\u201cMaybe this is only the beginning.\u201d\u201cThe beginning?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s the first time in history to infiltrate the Demon Realm in this way.\u201dIt was the Demon Realm that intervened in the human world only through passive transactions through human souls, but what will happen?There was no crisis like this in the original story. At most, the only thing that got entangled with the Demon World was Ariel\u2019s contract with Diego Vester to threaten Camilla.\u201cSir Reihausd. By the way\u2026\u201dI suddenly felt a slight discomfort when I saw him.There was a single person who was supposed to be seen.\u201cWhere is Dwayne?\u201dI could see his complexion hardened.For a while his heavy mouth didn\u2019t open. I asked again, while thinking,\u00a0no way.\u201c\u2026Sir Reihausd?\u201dA deep silence fell.This silence clearly meant an affirmation of the question. For some reason, my whole body was stiff.After a while, he spoke in a choked voice.\u201cHe was dragged into the gate.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cThe temple will not forget his sacrifice.\u201dHe was a Paladin who had been close to Ariel ever since I woke up.It was a problem with his blunt personality and tactlessness, but I always felt secure with him behind me whenever I went to trade at Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.But that kind of Dwayne\u2026 did something wrong?My heart started pounding.\u201cDwayne\u2026 Dwayne is\u2026\u201dI raised my hand and covered my face.Anger and sadness filled my heart.Shocked, I stood still for a long time, and Reihausd looked at me with miserable eyes.Then a chat window popped up in front of my eyes.[The hidden mission has been activated.][Hidden Mission: Close the gate of the Demon Realm to prevent the destruction of the world.][Reward: ???]And when my mind, which had been covered with sadness, cleared up a little, I remembered the most rational choice I could make.\u201cThat barrier.\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, I opened my mouth.\u201cIs it being held out by changing the priests\u2019 divine power now?\u201dReihausd nodded at my words.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen what about holy power?\u201dWouldn\u2019t it be possible if it was a sacred power that was stronger than holy power?I wanted to avoid getting into trouble. However, the news that even the strong Paladin Dwayne had become like that made the distant danger a reality.Ares is the hometown of Saintess Camilla. This current period is around the time she is in Ares.If the gate explodes and something happens to Camilla, that would be too much of a variable for me.Also, to maintain the gate, the priests of Elium will have to continue to be dispatched.\u2018It\u2019s enough that I\u2019ve already lost Dwayne\u2026\u2019To my words, Reihausd didn\u2019t answer for a long time.His expression hardened.\u201cI can\u2019t send you to that dangerous place. Ariel.\u201dA low voice reached my ears.\u201cThen tell me the objective truth about what will happen if the gate is left as it is.\u201dI asked him with a complicated look.His eyebrows quivered slightly.Soon, his hushed voice was heard.\u201cIf the barrier fails to be kept, the damage to the priests will increase, and if Ares Mine is taken over again or the hole grows bigger\u2026\u201dA groaning voice.\u201cIt could be really disastrous.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a disaster\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Demon Beasts will push in. The Imperial Palace is hastily gathering troops and preparing for war. If the gate explodes, Ares will be completely trampled and become an outpost of demons. An unprecedented crisis\u2026 situation.\u201dI thought it didn\u2019t matter much what happened to this world. But the red flags of no more were ringing in my head.The content of the hidden mission that I haven\u2019t seen in a long time was clear.\u2018Please close the gate of the Demon Realm to prevent the destruction of the world.\u2019That means that if the gate isn\u2019t closed, the world may perish.Either a peaceful retirement life or the landlord\u2019s dream may become impossible to dream at this rate.And the scenes I had seen through the senses of the Gods came to mind. Everything is going to be ruined\u2026\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go.\u201dI told Reihausd.\u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201dReihausd, obviously, stopped me.\u201cI\u2019m not going because I want to go either.\u201dI also hated being in danger.This damn world. I just want to live a quiet life.But it had to be done.\u201cAriel.\u201dReihausd continued to look stubborn.\u201cPlease make preparations.\u201dI got a little closer to him. Then, with a determined face, I continued to speak to him.\u201cSir Reihausd is injured, so please don\u2019t move.\u201dI could see his eyebrows twitching.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat if it\u2019s my order as the Saintess?\u201dLeaning slightly, I raised my hand and placed it on his neck.\u201cNow, as a real saintess, not a fake saintess.\u201dAnd untied his choker.Reihausd\u2019s eyes were shaking.I put the choker in my pocket.\u201cI will have this now.\u201dI knew that the reason he wouldn\u2019t let me go was because he was worried about me.However\u2026\u201cNow is the moment for the Saintess to do the Saintess\u2019 work and the High Priest to do the High Priest\u2019s work.\u201dAt my words, Reihausd\u2019s eyes shook again.Soon, he licked his lips.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re cruel.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer.His expression looked distressed, yet in the end he had no choice.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.

I was a little upset.This is probably the first long-distance trip after possessing this body. Ares Mine is quite far from the temple, so it would take 15 days at normal speed and 10 days at high speed.\u2018What will happen in the future?\u2019Will I be able to do it well?Such thoughts lingered endlessly.I eventually closed my eyes. Even thinking about it now, there was nothing I could do.Thud.But then a strange sound came from somewhere.Thud. Thud.I quietly raised my eyelids.\u2018Did some flies enter the room?\u2019It was similar to the sound of bugs hitting the ceiling.\u2018But there is no light here\u2026\u2019I got up.Thud.\u00a0A little louder this time.I looked up and looked in the direction the sound was coming from.\u201c\u2026Huh?!\u201dThen, startled, I hurried down under the bed.The unidentified sound came from the nest Daisy made.As I got closer, the egg I raised by showering it with holy power once or twice a day were breaking little by little.\u201c\u2026Great!\u201dAfter a while. The egg cracked deeply with a crackling sound.Forgetting all the complex thoughts I had had up until now, I stared at the egg with curious eyes.\u2018What will come out?\u2019Although it is said to be a monster, I heard that dangerous monsters don\u2019t come out of eggs this size.Somehow, it looks like an iguana or an owl will appear\u2026Thud. The moment the last shell of the cracked egg fell off, I opened my eyes wide.\u201cYou\u2026?\u201dAt the same time, Daisy, who was serving refreshments, entered with a short knock behind my back.Daisy, who came to me standing in front of the nest, also took a breath.\u201c\u2026Gasp, Saintess!\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe what kind of creature appeared in front of me.This\u2026 This is\u2026!I took a step back.The little creature opened its eyes and saw me.Freed from the dark pressure, I faced a new phase of bewilderment.\u201cThis is Pi-X-chu, though!\u201d (Pikachu LMAO)I was so startled that I screamed out loud. Then, a tingle, something like electricity, flashed from the tail of the yellow mouse.\u201cSaintess, what is Pi-X-chu? Anyway, this kid.\u201dDaisy said, putting her hands on its cheeks.\u201cHow cute.\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, vehemently opposes Daisy\u2019s words.]\u201c\u2026Gasp. No way.\u201dI pinched my cheek.How can a Pi-X-chu come out of an egg?Not to the point of resemblance, they were exactly the same.Plus, while being super cute, there\u2019s a problem.\u201c\u2026Pi-X?\u201d (Pika? X is read as \u2018ka\u2019, I guess)\u201cQuiet! You could be reported for copyright infringement!\u201dIn spite of my advice, Pi-X-chu pricked up its ears and put on a happy expression.\u201cPi-X?\u201dIn the end, I decided to use the last resort.\u201c\u2026Daisy.\u201dWhen I called Daisy with a determined face, she quickly approached me.\u201cYes, Saintess.\u201d\u201cBring me the demonic creature dictionary.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cHurry up.\u201dAt my urgent voice, Daisy went straight out.I ended up in a room alone with Pi-X-chu.\u201cPi-X?\u201d\u2026What. Do you even need a monster ball?My head was pounding.\u201c\u202610 Million Volt Thunderbolt.\u201d (a Pokemon move)Of course, I can\u2019t help but wonder.But Pi-X-chu didn\u2019t seem to know what 10 Million Volt Thunderbolt was.After a while, Daisy brought the demonic creature dictionary. I opened the dictionary while Daisy was playing with Pi-X-chu.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, uses \u2018Response\u2019 on you.]Words from the dictionary entered my mind incessantly.\u2018Nothing, nothing\u2026 No matter how much I look for it.\u2019I concentrated and searched for a monster that looked like a Pi-X-chu, but I couldn\u2019t find it.\u2018How did this happen?\u2019They said that I need to inject mana to grow well, but I injected holy power.Did a mutation come out?\u2018Still, it\u2019s strange that Pi-X-chu pops out of nowhere!\u2019As I kept revisiting the letters in the dictionary, something suddenly caught my eye.\u2018Yggdrasil.\u2019[Rare creature]A creature that grows from the branch of the World Tree in the beginning and can change its shape. It awakens from the egg in the form its owner is most familiar with.As an existence between a holy relic and a monster, it can grow into either a holy relic or a monster as the owner wishes.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is quite fond of the demonic creature.][The God of Love, Odyssey, says that the demonic creature is cuter than Ciel.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, growls as he looks at the demonic creature.]Perhaps because of these characteristics, the Gods didn\u2019t seem to show much hostility. Except for Ciel.\u201cPi-X pi-X!\u201d\u201cOh my, you are really cute. Pi-X.\u201dHowever, that form also had problems.\u201cAnything that can change shape\u2026\u201dI said to the Yggdrasil.\u201cYou\u2026 Can you change your body to look the way I want?\u201dAt my words, Pi-X-chu tilted its head.\u201cWhat do you mean, Saintess? To think that it can change its body.\u201d\u201c\u2026It has such a skill. This Pi-X-chu.\u201dI roughly put it around her.\u201cWow. It\u2019s better than I thought. But Saintess, it\u2019s cute now, though\u2026\u201dDaisy looked up at me, wide-eyed.\u201cNo. It\u2019s against copyright.\u201dI closed my eyes and sent a desperate telepathic message to the Yggdrasil.Change into something other than Pi-X-chu!After a while, when I opened my eyes, I saw a slightly different animal in front of me.\u201cMy goodness. The mouse has rounded ears. And it\u2019s black, but only its face is white\u2026\u201d\u201cThat rat is even worse!!\u201dMi-X Mouse! (Mickey Mouse)I closed my eyes with all my might.I\u2019ve seen on the internet about the easiest way to be rescued from a deserted island. If you draw that mouse on the beach sand, the company\u2019s legal team will come looking for you\u2026It\u2019s a messed up version of the original, even so, it can\u2019t go further catastrophic.After a while, I opened my eyes.A chubby gold hamster was seen through my blurry vision.\u201cKyuu?\u201dStupidity flowed from its sesame-seed-like black eyes. Its convex cheeks, glossy fur, and cute butt are adorable.I barely let out a sigh of relief.\u201cOh my gosh. There is such a cute creature.\u201dDaisy reached her hand out in admiration.I hurriedly grabbed Daisy\u2019s wrist. It was because the electricity flowing from the hamster\u2019s body stood out.\u201cIt\u2019s an attack type. This fellow.\u201dEven so, I heard that when it becomes an adult, it will have stronger power than most high-ranking magicians.The population is so rare that its properties haven\u2019t been properly studied, and it may have some hidden potential.Fortunately though.\u201cKyuu.\u201dThe hamster was making a fierce expression while looking at me.It is said to be the type that recognizes the first person it sees as its owner after waking up from the egg.I looked at Kyuu and said.\u201cFrom today, your name is Kyuu.\u201dOne day before the raid, I also got a pet mouse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You should fill at least one carriage with dresses and accessories for this expedition. When the Imperial Family goes on a trip for several days, they fill three carriages.\u201dA saintess is a semi-member of the Imperial Family who doesn\u2019t have to bow her head to anyone but the Emperor.But with all my luggages combined, it was only two 28-inch suitcases, so it was understandable that she was bewildered.\u201cWhat if priests from other temples look down on the Saintess? We can never let that happen\u2026\u201d\u201cDaisy, I\u2019m not going on a trip, though?\u201dI said firmly, fearing that Daisy would fill one of the carriages.\u201cStill, Saintess, this is too little. No matter how much I think about it, I have to go with you and wait\u2026\u201d\u201cI said no to that. No.\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201dShe widened her eyes, but I firmly refused.As the gate is about to open, Ares Mine is too much for Daisy, whose divine power is at the level of an apprentice priestess.\u201cPlease. I can\u2019t send the Saintess to that dangerous place alone.\u201dIn the end, the carriage was the paving stone for this conclusion.\u201cI know what you\u2019re feeling, but if you come, you\u2019ll get in the way.\u201dDaisy looked at me, startled at my words. It was a cold statement, but it was also a clear reality that made her accept my decision.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to put me in danger by protecting you, would you?\u201dDaisy bowed her head, looking like she was going to cry.\u201cI understand. Saintess.\u201dI raised my hand and patted her on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much and wait. Did you say your hometown is in the north?

It was large even for a golden hamster, so I could feel the weight in my palm.\u201cI won\u2019t see you for a long time either. But don\u2019t forget your owner.\u201dWhether it was really a rare demonic creature, Kyuu looked at me with its stupid eyes.There were over a hundred Paladins although there was only one carriage I rode. About thirty porters and workers were also mobilized.I was bewildered on a larger scale than I thought.\u201cSir Reihausd.\u201dJust in time, Reihausd was seeing me off.He looked better than before in his white uniform.Of course, he still doesn\u2019t seem to have fully recovered, judging from the fact that he\u2019s in a cast.\u201cI have selected the most skilled Paladins.\u201dHowever, if I told him to reduce the number of Paladins here, there was plenty of room for Reihausd to say that he was forced to follow me instead, so I nodded my head.I heard that he was cursed by a dying demon.The demon\u2019s curse through death was a considerable blow to even the High Priest.First of all, it was just that my blessing didn\u2019t work well. A break will be needed for another month or more.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, just go in.\u201d\u201cSaintess\u2026\u201dA desperate light flashed in his eyes, which shimmered gold across his pale face.Now, Reihausd even seemed to want to grab my feet.\u201cThe Saintess is right.\u201dThen, a man\u2019s voice was heard. A little startled, I turned my head and saw a tall man walking towards me. It was Cass Lloyd.\u201cMarquis Lloyd.\u201dReihausd furrowed his eyebrows with a clear sick complexion.Cass bowed his head to me and said to Reihausd.\u201cJust in time, I\u2019m also going to Ares for a job, so I request to accompany the Saintess.\u201dI was startled by that and looked up at Cass. It was a story I had never heard of.\u201cWouldn\u2019t the High Priest feel a little relieved if a hundred skilled mercenaries from Lloyd\u2019s Merchant and many workers were together in addition to the one hundred Paladins?\u201dReihausd asked with a reluctant expression.\u201c\u2026What is your business about going to Ares?\u201d\u201cThe mid-level demons that came out of the mine exploded and caused great damage to the property of the Merchant in Ares.\u201dThere was a cold aura in his ultramarine blue eyes.\u201cThey went looting. Killing people. They said it was lawless.\u201dAfter Reihausd returned to the temple, Ares\u2019 situation began to be known to the capital, and it was a time when public sentiment was agitated.All in all, it was said that due to the Empress\u2019 treason incident, the Imperial Palace had been delayed in organizing the messed up system, and was now forming a corps to dispatch.Cass opened his mouth after a while.\u201cWe plan to rectify the damage and check its situation.\u201dIn other words, he also had business in Ares.At Cass\u2019 words, Reihausd\u2019s eyes shook.There were wrinkles between his eyebrows, and a shadow was visible on his face.Instinctively, he seemed unwilling to have Cass accompany me.However, rather than sending me alone, it would be safer for me to be with him, the young owner of the Lloyd Merchant, thus the light of fierce conflict flashed in his eyes.\u201cI appreciate Marquis Lloyd\u2019s words, but\u2026\u201dI took the initiative and opened my mouth.To have to stick with Cass during a long trip of nearly fifteen days. How would I deal with that awkwardness and discomfort?However, Reihausd cut off my words.\u201cMarquis Lloyd.\u201dHe said to Cass with a gloomy look.\u201cPlease take good care of the Saintess.\u201dHis golden eyes were dark.Without a word, Cass answered.\u201cI will do my best to protect the Saintess while I accompany her.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is satisfied with Reihausd\u2019s decision.]***After a while we got into the carriage and set off. To be precise, I rode the carriage alone, and everyone else rode the horses.About ten wagons loaded with Lloyd\u2019s Merchant\u2019s items and Paladins\u2019 protective equipment followed me in line.Cass\u2019s horse was walking next to my wide open window outside.It wasn\u2019t that fast.Can we get there within fifteen days at this speed?I glanced up at him.It was a bit uncomfortable, but I still felt a bit relieved that we weren\u2019t together for fifteen days in the same carriage.If we have to stay in the same carriage all day, it may cause inconvenience.\u201cYou don\u2019t look so happy.\u201dI heard Cass\u2019 voice.\u201cAre you not happy that I intervened?\u201dLike a merchant who can read people\u2019s minds skillfully, he noticed my insides.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stayed still, neither denying nor affirming.I could feel him smiling fresh.\u201cYour response is honest.\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 It\u2019s just a little awkward. I thought I was leaving alone.\u201dI answered calmly.I could feel Cass looking at me.\u201cWhen this schedule is over, you won\u2019t feel awkward anymore.\u201dI don\u2019t know what it means, but I ignored it.It was then. A blue bird landed on the window sill.I turned my gaze from Cass to the bird and covered my mouth in surprise.\u201cIs this\u2026\u201dI heard Cass\u2019 voice.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dIt was the Blue Wing that I found in the temple yard before and saved using my holy power for the first time. Its wings were more shiny than before, and the blue feathers were still beautiful.\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing well.\u201dSince Cass has a relentless personality who abandons dying birds, I hadn\u2019t expected him to be taking good care of it. Fortunately, however, the bird seemed to be doing well so far.It seemed that Blue Wing saw me and chirped in reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen it was a little awkward, a faint smile came to my lips.\u201cDo you like animals?\u201dI heard Cass\u2019 voice.\u201cThey\u2019re less complicated than a person.\u201dI answered while looking at Blue Wing.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, likes your answer.]People and animals were different. Because they didn\u2019t betray with shallow calculations, and there were many things to repay as much as I gave affection.Jjae-Rok, the one that I raised in my past life, also gave me a little comfort.\u201cI see. In some ways, humans are worse than animals. Actually, we can\u2019t avoid it, but it is.\u201dCass\u2019s voice, whether he was joking or sincere, was creepy.I turned words the other way. I didn\u2019t want to share any more triggering stories with him, a sociopath.\u201cThe Marquis must have met many people, right? You must have been to many places.\u201d\u201cI went around constantly for several years to experience the world that I couldn\u2019t experience because I was confined to the temple as a child. To the extent that Lloyd\u2019s Merchant issued a wanted order.\u201dHis expression as he rode and talked seemed light.\u201cThen have you ever been to Ares?\u201d\u201cThe most recent was two years ago. I\u2019m even close with the lord.\u201dIt also seemed like it wasn\u2019t the first time for him.He continued.\u201cEveryone in the Empire knows that Lloyd is the safest companion no matter where you travel here.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s why Sir Reihausd also asked you to accompany me.\u201dI replied bitterly.Well, that\u2019s why Reihausd must have thought it best for me to go with him.As we exchanged a few words, the sun started to set.Blue Wing, who was sitting on the window sill, flew up into the sky again, probably bored.After riding in the carriage for a long time, my back started to hurt.\u201cBut having to go for fifteen days is really far.\u201dCass said to me, who muttered with a sigh.\u201cI told you. Lloyd is the safest companion.\u201dHe added.\u201cAnd we\u2019re also the fastest companion.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cBecause Lloyd has a map with all the shortcuts in the world.\u201dI looked at him, startled.He said with a confident look.\u201cI guarantee that you will arrive in Ares within a week. Five days at the earliest\u201dI widened my expression at the unexpected good news.\u201cInstead.\u201dHowever, the words were followed by a clue.\u201cGive me a seat in that carriage, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Please.\u201dI agreed, and after a while he got on the carriage.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, smiles brightly.][All Gods are concentrating.]Ignoring the flashing chat window in front of my eyes, I sat as close to the window sill as possible.He sat across from me and smiled lightly.\u201cI usually only use my mind, so after a long time riding a horse, my body was sore. Meanwhile, the carriage the Saintess is riding looks comfortable.\u201dWell, unlike Kyle and Reihausd, Cass wasn\u2019t the type to carry a sword.His dagger throwing skill the other day was good, though.\u201cBut that shortcut\u2026 Does it really exist?\u201dHearing that, Cass unfolded one of his maps. I was sure that the road to Ares had to wind through the mountains.\u201cWe\u2019re not climbing a mountain, are we?\u201dAt my words, Cass shook his head.\u201cLloyd was opening a passage to speed up the transportation of goods.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a passage..?\u201dNo way, there are so many mountains, it would be impossible to dig tunnels one by one. There is no such thing as modern technology.While I was puzzled, Cass pointed at a spot with his hand. A star was drawn. And another star was drawn at the end of the mountain range.\u201cYou mean teleportation?\u201dIt was a joke thrown at a sign I couldn\u2019t guess, yet he didn\u2019t say anything.I looked at him with bewildered eyes. He opened his mouth and spoke earnestly.\u201cWe were building a large warp magic circle.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI was surprised.Warp was also mentioned in the book I read in the library, and it was an advanced technique used by magicians.As a human, it was close to impossible to teleport without a magic circle unless you were a great magician, which was close to impossible, and the only way to do it was to install two identical coded magic circles.However, the normal magic circle consumes a tremendous amount of magic depending on the distance, so walking that distance was more cost-effective.There was a large warp magic circle that could be used semi-permanently and magic stones suitable for warp magic, but even that had restrictions on distance, and first of all, the cost was almost the price of one castle, so it wasn\u2019t put to practical use.\u201cIs it from here to here?\u201dI put my hand on the two stars in turn.\u201cOur Lloyd\u2019s Merchant exports many of Ares\u2019 specialties through the port. There are many precious minerals there, and half of the mining rights belong to Lloyd.\u201dLloyd\u2019s was a nationwide merchant.Would it be like Sam-X in Korea, I wonder.And the man sitting next to me is the operator of a large company.\u201cIt cost a lot to install a large warp magic circle, but it was expected that the cost could be recovered in about five years. Until the gate explodes.\u201dIt was still surprising that he had invested a huge amount of money to install the warp magic circle in anticipation of long-term gains.\u201cSo you mean we can use this magic circle?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible if we divide ourselves into three groups and go.\u201dHe said calmly.I really thought that I could reach the mine in five days according to his explanation.\u201cLloyd\u2019s Merchant is really amazing.\u201dI spat out words of admiration.Instead of answering, he let a faint smile across his lips.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dEven so, there was still something to be said.\u201cYou\u2019re not saying you\u2019re going to share the carriage with me all five days, are you?\u201dHe asked instead of answering.\u201cIt seems that the Saintess is very uncomfortable with me.\u201dI didn\u2019t give a negative answer this time either.\u201cWell. When my back gets better, I\u2019ll ride the horse again.\u201dCass said, furrowing his eyebrows.But getting better is a subjective thing.\u201cAh.\u201dI decided to exercise my wits.\u201cHow about I heal you with my holy power?\u201dThen I put my hands on him, but in this position I couldn\u2019t even reach his waist.Why is the carriage so narrow?\u201cI\u2019ll have to go to that side.\u201dBut if he comes next to me, I will sit close to him.\u201cI\u2019ll heal you later when you rest.\u201dI abruptly cut off.\u201cThen, please take care of me.\u201dI heard his voice mixed with laughter.***Watching the sunset, I seem to have fallen asleep without even realizing it.After the carriage stopped, I raised my head excitedly. Then I found Cass sitting next to me.To my surprise, he said calmly.\u201cYou must be tired.\u201dSomehow his shoulder collar was wrinkled.Did I just sleep on Cass\u2019 shoulder?I didn\u2019t say anything out of awkwardness and just stared at him.Even in the midst of half asleep, his good scent lingers on the tip of my nose.I stared at his deep ultramarine eyes for a long while, then flinched my hand. I pressed myself against the window frame and tried to get up.\u201cIt looks\u2026 like we\u2019ve arrived at the inn.\u201dMy tongue was twisted and I couldn\u2019t speak well. I could hear people talking and noise outside.\u201cWe\u2019d better get out of the carriage now\u2026\u201dAnd before I could finish my words, he grabbed my staggering wrist. I obviously almost fell as I was flustered.My chin touched his shoulder. My whole body was leaning as if I was being hugged by his strong body.I felt his hand on my wrist. Suddenly, my cheeks felt hot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can cover my red face.After a while, his lips twitched into a light smile.\u201c\u2026Be careful.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dI was able to stand up again with my back bent after a while.Cass stretched out his long arm and opened the carriage door. Only then did fresh air rush into the carriage.He walked out first and held out his hand to me. Embarrassed for some reason, I didn\u2019t hold his hand, but grabbed the doorknob of the carriage and got off.His eyebrows twitched. The moment I got off the carriage, I saw workers unloading the carriage and Paladins maintaining the horses.The villages on the outskirts of the capital weren\u2019t as busy as the downtown area, but there were still many inns and restaurants.Cass said to me, who blankly looked at the scenery.\u201cSo you brought an escort knight.\u201dAt that, I looked at Cass with a puzzled look.An escort knight?Soon he pulled a ball of fur out of his pocket.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. I saw Kyuu whose snout was tied with a small string.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, nullifies Kyuu\u2019s electric shock.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, once again nullifies Kyuu\u2019s electric shock.]Hessed had bought Cass\u2019 stock. And electricity is his forte.Kyuu\u2019s expression looked very sad.\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s a pet that I raised, but it seems to have followed me.\u201dI took it from him and put it in my hand. Then I untied the knot in its pitiful mouth.\u201cBecause it wants to bite me.\u201dI heard Cass\u2019 voice.\u201cI just let you lean your sleeping head on me.\u201dHis voice made me feel somewhat awkward.\u201cPerhaps it thought you were going to harm me. Because my Kyuu is sensitive.\u201d\u201cIts name is Kyuu?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dI replied, scratching my head.Somehow, there seemed to be a spark between Cass and Kyuu, who was in my hand.\u201cTomorrow, I will introduce it to my Blue Wing.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dThat doesn\u2019t sound like a very good idea. Blue Wings are carnivores, because rats are their staple food.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, is delighted with Cass\u2019 plan.]I looked at him awkwardly and went inside the inn.Sleeping with my head on Cass\u2019 shoulder. It\u2019s a humiliation from day oneThe night outside the window was getting dark. Meals were being served at the inn, and the noise of the party made the first night of the trip a little exciting.I sat and ate together, but I felt tired and went into the room first. And I went to bed with Kyuu.About four days passed like that.I\u2019ve gotten a little closer with Cass in the meantime. I felt like we were attached to each other all day long.Occasionally, when he rode in the carriage, we would talk about this and that, and we would share snacks. Although Kyuu didn\u2019t seem to like him at all.So we arrived at the warp point.By the way\u2026\u201cHow did this happen?\u201dCass asked, getting off his horse.I could feel that the situation was unusual.There was a log building next to the warp point made of marble, yet half of it was gone because it was burned.And about twenty people who had collapsed and became corpses were lying everywhere.Footprints on the floor belong to humans.The Paladins began to arm themselves, and the mercenaries brought by Cass also drew their swords.Cass beckoned me to stay in the carriage, and I watched the situation outside anxiously while hugging Kyuu.\u201cWere they attacked?\u201dCass nodded his head with a serious expression.His cold eyes were on the half-burnt log building.\u201cThere are people alive.\u201dThen a mercenary shouted.Cass walked towards him quickly. It seemed that there was someone with a life attached to it.\u201cWho did this?\u201d\u201cKeugh\u2026\u00a0Cough\u2026\u201dHe looked in great pain and I got out of the carriage. Then I ran straight ahead and passed Cass, infusing him with holy power.The light escaped from my hands and the man\u2019s breathing gradually stabilized.After a while, he opened his mouth.\u201cThey were more like mercenaries than abandits.\u201d\u201cMercenaries?\u201dCass asked.\u201cYes. They were dressed in black clothes and black masks, but they moved so swiftly\u2026 . Like flying\u2026\u00a0Cough.\u201dI gave him more power, and soon the man fell asleep.Unlike reviving a child like Noah, reviving a dying adult required more holy power, so first of all, only enough holy power was injected to save his life.\u201cSaintess.\u201dAs I got up, I stumbled unconsciously and one of the Paladins supported me.Cass\u2019 expression darkened.\u201cAre we not going to use the warp?\u201dHe answered my question.\u201cIt can be used, but the problem is that it doesn\u2019t guarantee safety on the other side.\u201d\u201cIf they are on the other side of the point\u2026\u201dFortunately, there was no damage to the marble engraved with the warp magic circle, but this may also be a trap.\u201cDid they target me?\u201dAt my words, Cass shook his head.\u201cThere are far more enemies at the Lloyd\u2019s Merchant than at the temple.\u201dAs the largest merchant of the Empire, there will be many rivals and those who hold grudges.\u201cThose who raid the fortunes of the Merchant have been everywhere.\u201dA moment of silence passed.A Paladin told me.\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to use the warp now.\u201dHowever, if we go back on the mountain road, it will take ten days. No, since it took a while to get here, it might take another fortnight.And until then, will the priests be able to block the gap well?Even a skilled knight like Dwayne was beaten.Seeing my worried face, Cass cautiously brought his words out.\u201cOr I\u2019ll check the safety through the warp and come back.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 .\u201dAt Cass\u2019 words, I looked at him, startled.It might be safe for me, but it was too risky for him.\u201cMarquis, it shouldn\u2019t be like that.\u201dHis subordinates also seemed to dissuade him.Yet he didn\u2019t care and told me.\u201cThis warp magic circle, enchanted by the sun, can connect passages in both directions up to four times a day. And given the size of the group, in order to enter the magic circle, we have to cross over in three groups.\u201d\u201cFirst I will cross over and make sure it\u2019s safe, then I will return. After that, the Saintess and the Paladins can cross over the remaining two times.\u201dThe Paladins questioned whether his words were convincing.Soon I opened my mouth.\u201cThen\u2026 How about the Marquis\u2019 safety?\u201dAt my words, the atmosphere fell silent.Cass\u2019 eyebrows twitched.After a while he opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m telling you the most reasonable option.\u201dCass Lloyd.Heir to the largest merchant in the Empire and a pragmatist who judges everything with a calculating mindset.Yet at this moment, he was putting my safety first.Is this even a calculation of the relationship with the temple?\u2018Or, is he a different person than I thought?\u2019\u201cIt makes sense for my case, but not for yours.\u201dI said looking straight at him.And for an instant, his eyebrows hardened, then I could see his eyes shaking.He opened his mouth slightly, then closed it a moment later.\u201cNo. It makes sense for my case too.\u201dHe regained his calm, sober gaze.\u201cThe Lloyd\u2019s Merchant considers the relationship with the temple very important, and if something goes wrong with the Saintess, it will be difficult to avoid responsibility.\u201dI stared at him for a while before opening my mouth.\u201cAlright. If you think that far.\u201dSomehow, the inside of my mouth was bitter.Everything he does is just a calculation, right?Then\u2026 I won\u2019t have to feel guilty about letting him take the risk either.\u201cWe will do as the Marquis say.\u201dSoon, people started to move around busily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also Cass and two of his men stood inside the warp magic circle.Except for Cass and the workers, everyone had drawn their swords and had finished preparing.There was also a magician among the mercenaries who deployed a double defensive magic circle.Soon after, when the magic circle was activated, bright light emanated from the floor, and everything on top of it disappeared.\u201cKyuu?\u201dKyuu tilted its head.I looked at the place where they disappeared with a nervous face.There was no way to know what the situation was like on the other side.I heard that it would take less than half a day to reach the mine once they arrived, so this shortcut must be taken.It was the time when I was looking at the warp magic circle with anxious eyes while fidgeting my nails. The magic circle shone and a man appeared.\u201c\u2026!\u201dLooking at Cass\u2019 neat appearance, I could feel in my gut that the other side was safe.The faces of the Paladins who were waiting also brightened.\u201cThe other side is safe.\u201dWe let out a sigh of relief. And immediately, the second camp went up into the magic circle.Thirty Paladins and seven carriages loaded with equipment and all the rest of the workers went up.The remaining forty Paladins, fifty mercenaries, Cass, and I were scheduled to do the final warp.After a while, the light came on and after they disappeared, we immediately climbed onto the marble magic circle.My heart was pounding. Magic circles and warp transportation that I only saw in comics and novels.The mercenary magician infused a little magic to activate the magic circle.After a while, light began to emanate from the floor.Oh, it\u2019s amazing.And the bodies of the Paladins around me began to become translucent.By the way\u2026\u201c\u2026?\u201dMy body was the same. As if the light were escaping me.At that moment, I felt an ominous feeling.What. What is this?!The light flashed and all the nearby Paladins and luggage disappeared. Yet I was the only one left on the marble magic circle.I opened my eyes wide.\u2018How did this happen?\u2019\u201cWhy\u2026 doesn\u2019t the magic circle work?\u201dThen, behind me, who opened my eyes wide in surprise, I heard a familiar voice. When I turned my head and looked back, Cass stood one step away from the magic circle.His eyebrows stiffened and I shook my head.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dIt was really embarrassing.\u201cBut the Marquis\u2026?\u201d\u201cSeeing that you alone didn\u2019t transmit light, I quickly came out of the magic circle.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t leave you alone here.\u201dI felt a bit of relief in his words.Putting aside this absurd situation, if I had been left alone here with only corpses\u2026 Ugh.\u201c\u2026Is it because of the holy power?\u201dI thought about why I couldn\u2019t warp to the magic circle.And after a while, something flashed through my mind.\u201c\u2026Gosh.\u201dAnd I quickly took off the pendant I was wearing. It was a moment of embarrassment over my massive mistake.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dThe crazy price of 4,000 franc, <Pendant of Seal>, had only one effect.When worn, it seals abilities such as holy power, divine power, and magic within one\u2019s body.In addition, it offsets external attacks of magic, including holy power, divine power, and Magi, with a certain probability.The magic circle works with magic.If this pendant recognized the magic circle as an external attack\u2026\u201cIt was my mistake.\u201dI belatedly covered my face with both hands.It has become a situation where I have to spend the night alone with Cass.After a while, Cass and I were sitting side by side in a log camp with a hole in the ceiling.\u201cA pendant that offsets magic\u2026 You mean you forgot to take it off.\u201dHis eyebrows hardened.He deserved to be angry. As we have to wait here, unable to move, until the magic circle resets tomorrow morning.In this gloomy place that smells of rotting corpses, we have to spend the night without food or blankets.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have taken off the pendant.\u201dIt\u2019s basically a holy relic, so wearing a pendant didn\u2019t block the oracle. That\u2019s why it seems that I was wearing it without much thought.\u201cBecause of me, today\u2026\u201dThe sunset was already setting outside.I looked at the sky in a daze and sighed before telling him.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201dIf he hadn\u2019t retreated from the magic circle, I would have had to spend the night alone. Just thinking about it feels so terrifying.Cass sat with his back against the wall, not answering.Darkness fell even in his ultramarine blue eyes.He was probably angry. He must have been angry.After a while, he opened his mouth and let out a voice.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAt his words, I asked,\u00a0pardon?He continued his words with dark eyes staring out the opposite window.\u201cAs I said before, it was just a reasonable choice for me. Your safety has to do with Lloyd.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before he turned to look at me.In the red sunset light, his ultramarine blue eyes looked like the deep sea.I just stared at him without saying a word.His lips moved again.\u201cThus I\u2019m not angry.\u201dAfter a while, he turned his head to the front again.Looking at his calm and expressionless face, I said.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dHe was a born merchant and, in some ways, a monstrous man who compared even a person\u2019s life to a penny or two.Even the female lead, Camilla, has been betrayed by him. Yet today he looked a little\u2026 different.[The God of Justice, Hetuse, criticizes him for his desolation.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, advocates his sincerity.]The mind of a person whom even the Gods can\u2019t know for sure. There\u2019s no way I can get to know him.[The God of Love, Odyssey, hastens the night.]It was getting darker all around. And there was an occasional roar of animals outside.When he made a rustle, I flinched in surprise. It seemed that I was unconsciously nervous.He took a stick from his inside pocket and pressed its middle. Then the rod started to glow.\u201cIs it a magic item?\u201d\u201cYeah. It was something I had with me in case of an emergency.\u201dHe put it around and it brightened up quite a bit though.The light was a bit dim, but it wasn\u2019t completely dark, so it was a little better.\u201cYou\u2019re thoroughly prepared.\u201dA small smile formed on his lips at my words.We stood still with our backs against the wall. It didn\u2019t seem like sleep would come easily, and the night felt like it was long.After a moment of silence, he opened his mouth.\u201cHave you ever liked someone?\u201dI pondered for a while at the unexpected question.\u201cMm. I don\u2019t know. By the way, didn\u2019t the Marquis know about the rumor that I liked someone?\u201dRumors that the Saintess liked Prince Kyle had spread far and wide in the temple, and as the owner of the Lloyd\u2019s Merchant with the best information in the Empire, there was no way he was unaware of the rumor.\u201cI know. At least that rumor is false.\u201dAt the unexpected answer, I looked at him.\u201cJust by looking at one\u2019s face, you can tell if they\u2019re in love.\u201dAlthough he has uninspiring ultramarine blue eyes, he is the person with the best wits in the Empire.\u201cAs expected, it seems that you are far from dating.\u201dI answered calmly.At the back of his tongue, he uttered a,\u00a0pft.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have enough room in my heart yet.\u201dI opened my mouth lightly and smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s troublesome to decide who to trust and not to trust. Just believing in myself and living a happy life is all I want.\u201dIt was the first time I came here and confided in someone like this. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of this lighting that gives off a truth or dare game atmosphere.Cass stared at me after a glance.\u201cWhen I\u2019ve only heard of you through rumors, whoa, seeing you in person is the complete opposite.\u201dSince it\u2019s someone else, so it has to be.\u201cIsn\u2019t this why people have to experience it to know?\u201dI heard his low voice.Then I asked him, changing the mood.\u201cWhat about the Marquis? You must have done a lot of dating.\u201dIn modern times, as a second-generation conglomerate, women would have been hit over and over again. His face was also handsome, and he was a scion who gave off a cold yet intelligent feeling, so it was only natural.\u201cI\u2019ve met many.\u201dAgain, this was the answer I expected.\u201cAs needed. Like a tool.\u201dHowever, the next sentence was something I didn\u2019t expect.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 A tool?\u201d\u201cA practical relationship in which the woman provides what I need and likewise. And when I feel I don\u2019t need it anymore, I\u2019ve ended the relationship. Should I say it\u2019s a two-way tool?\u201dI don\u2019t know what \u2018need\u2019 is, but it was clear that it was the line of the Cass Lloyd I knew.He looked out into the darkness outside and continued.\u201cBut lately I\u2019ve been having trouble.\u201d\u201cEven though I\u2019ve never been in a relationship, I like to hear about love concerns, so tell me.\u201dStories like this are interesting. I listened to him attentively.[The Gods are listening together.]\u201cRecently, I often think that I need a woman. I used to listen to it intermittently, but now unconsciously, suddenly, and all of a sudden again. It bothers me confusingly\u201dIs this probably how sociopaths express their desire to be in a relationship, I wonder.\u201cBut the curious thing is, I don\u2019t know why I need her.\u201dAfter a while, his voice, which reached my ears, was low.It was a love concern that was beyond my understanding.[The God of Love, Odyssey, smiles with a mysterious look.]\u201c\u2026Why do you think it is?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cass himself.\u201dCass, who had been thinking for a while, pursed his lips.\u201cEverything in the world has a priority. Does being in love ignore that priority?\u201dA moment of silence passed.I thought for a while and said.\u201cIf you really like someone, that is.\u201dThen he smiled and shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. At least for Lloyd.\u201dIt was a strange remark.I carefully cut off the conversation.\u201cNo matter what happens, I will support you.\u201dHis eyes darken slightly. Then, after a moment, he twisted his lips and smiled.He looked away from me to the window.\u201cYou look tired.\u201dBefore I knew it, my body started to feel tired.Soon after, he told me\u201cClose your eyes. It\u2019s still a long way until dawn.\u201dI nodded his head and lay on my side with my back against him. Even though I was in the same room with a man outside, I didn\u2019t feel enclosed, perhaps because the ceiling was open.I could hear the sound of grasshoppers from time to time.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m homeless.\u201dI heard him laugh at my words.I closed my eyes.Kyuu, you\u2019re waiting for me nicely, right?I gradually fell into the world of unconsciousness.When I opened my eyes to the chirping of birds, the light flooded in.I woke up with a frown. The jacket Cass was wearing was placed on my body like a blanket.Is it morning already?I stretched out, grabbed his jacket, and stood up.As I walked out of the log barracks, feeling exhausted, I saw Cass in a shirt. His face was still clear, and somehow it made me dazed.Ah, his shirt was too revealing.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dI nodded at his voice.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dComing out of the barracks, I looked around.Several wolves that I didn\u2019t see yesterday were dead.I asked, looking at Cass with surprised eyes.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dHe approached me with a light smile and said. Without giving me the answer I wanted.\u201cPeople will be waiting. Let\u2019s go now.\u201dI handed him the jacket again and climbed onto the magic circle.The magic circle started to activate again.***\u201cMy goodness, Saintess. A noble person has come to this humble place.\u201dThe elder priest of Ares saw me and shed tears. I saw other priests wearing their uniforms, but their faces were terrible.All of them had dark circles under their eyes that went all the way down to their chins.\u201cGlory to Hetuse, the God of Justice.\u201dIn the area adjacent to the mine, there are the Temple of Hetuse and the Temple of Oman.And to the temple of Ciel, located about a day away\u2026 The three temples were putting in priests for the barrier.Support came from all over the country, but they were barely holding on as if they were blocking a bursting beam with their hands.In such a situation, I would be like a welcomed rain shower in a drought. It is said that a saintess\u2019 holy power is equal to the total divine power of one or two temples.\u201cHow is the situation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good. We\u2019re barely holding on\u2026 Rather, the gap is widening.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to see it right now.\u201dI got up right away\u2026 and turned to Cass while asking.\u201cWhat is Cass going to do?\u201dHis eyes widened as he sat holding a teacup.Soon he opened his mouth.\u201cThe mining rights of Ares Mine are an important asset for Lloyd. We shall support the Saintess.\u201dAt his words, the elder priest nodded to him in gratitude.He put down his teacup and stood up. And with cold eyes, he licked his lips.\u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201dI nodded.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, blesses you.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, blesses you.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, blesses you.][The God of Art, Mond, blesses you.]The Gods showered me with blessings again.***[The oracle communication is not smooth.][The God of Love, Odyssey\u2026][The oracle communication is not smooth.]As we got closer to Ares\u2019s mine, the oracle\u2019s noise got worse, and gradually, I couldn\u2019t even understand what they were saying.Powerful Magi was flowing in the mine.\u201cPriest! Priest, open your eyes.\u201dI saw other priests sprinkle holy water on the face of the priest who was being carried down on a stretcher.There were wounded knights everywhere, and they were neglected without even expecting a priest to heal them.\u201cI\u2019ve sent letters to the Imperial Palace several times\u2026 but no volunteers are coming.\u201dTo the elder priest\u2019s words, I answered with a sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s a little late due to circumstances, but they\u2019ll definitely come. Trust me, Prince Kyle is definitely not the kind of person to leave this situation behind.\u201dHe nodded and pointed to the entrance.Indeed, a thicker concentration of Magi was felt.Cass covered his mouth with his sleeve.\u201cI will cover you.\u201dPaladins took the lead and surrounded me.Soon we started walking along the railroad tracks of the mine, which was dark like a cave.Groans were heard everywhere.\u201cFortunately, the gate at the bottom of the mine didn\u2019t explode. If it had been, it would have been impossible to create a barrier as it would be inaccessible.\u201dAfter walking about 100 meters, a faint light began to appear.As we got closer, the intensity of the light became thicker, and after a while, we could see silhouettes of people. It was about thirty priests who were tangled together.Their faces are full of sweat and smeared with dark spots.There were fallen knights behind, and some knights were blocking the monsters that were trying to attack the priests through the net-like barrier.The barrier they were barely maintaining was like a net before it broke.The open gate entrance was densely filled with monsters, and the barrier seemed to be insufficient to contain them as they became increasingly heavy.\u201cMy great god, Ciel. Give strength to your servant\u2026\u201d\u201cLet your enemies sleep in eternal ruin. Ciel of Destruction\u2026\u201dThe injured priests were reciting the names of familiar gods and supplementing their energy with prayers.And after a while, a priest found the elder priest and shouted.\u201cDirector Priest. I think it will be difficult to endure the day at this rate.\u201dAnd he looked at us and said.\u201cBut these people\u2026\u201dThe elder priest immediately spoke.\u201cThe Saintess has come to support us.\u201dAs soon as I heard that, all the priests looked at me. A violent reaction soon erupted.\u201cT-The Saintess has arrived!!\u201d\u201cThe Saintess has come to save us.\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201dSome of those pouring their divine powers into the barrier on the front line were crying.\u201cSaintess! The Saintess has come!\u201d\u201cThank you, Saintess.\u201d\u201cThank you, God Hetuse!\u201dIt was a reaction as if a strong reinforcement had been put into a battle in which defeat was obvious.Somehow I felt strange. It was the first time I felt like I was needed.\u201cMove the wounded.\u201dAt Cass\u2019 words, the mercenaries began to load the fallen knights and priests onto stretchers.I stared at the hole through which monsters spewed out.Cracks were visible around the hole the size of a door.If that rift is broken, the hole will become even bigger and monsters that are more difficult to handle will pour out.I took one step, two steps forward.I hate coming forward, yet sometimes I have to.When there is a danger, like now, that monsters from the Demonic Realm will cover the country and the original story will be ruined, it\u2019s when a bloody situation arises in which my future tranquility is threatened.\u201cSaintess! Our light!\u201d\u201cSaintess, salvation!\u201dBehind me, they let out a cheering roar as if they realized I was about to try something.Ah, stop saying cheesy things.\u2018I can\u2019t concentrate.\u2019I let go of the desperate words that flew into my ears and focused on my hands.Holy power is a very powerful power of regeneration. I gathered my strength thinking of restoring this gate. Then I raised my hands in the direction of the hole. Soon, several beams of light poured into the hole.It was a far more powerful light than the insignificant clusters of light that had come from the hands of the priests until now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The elder priest also closed his eyes and muttered prayers earnestly.\u201cT-The gate is restored!!\u201dA priest\u2019s cry was heard.After all, the power of this munchkin-class ability is amazing. In fact, I couldn\u2019t see very well in the halo, yet it was clear that things were going well. Otherwise, the priests wouldn\u2019t have been so excited.I looked at the gate with the thought of pouring all my energy into it. Fortunately, the size of the gate seemed to be getting smaller than before.And the Paladins were easily blocking the attacks of the demon beasts from outside the net. If the gate is completely closed like this, they should be able to release the barrier and deal with the monsters.I closed my eyes and focused on restoring the gate.\u201cSaintess! A little bit more!\u201dThe elder priest\u2019s deafening voice was heard.\u201cBe quiet.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cStop making noise and shut up.\u201dI gritted my teeth and said a word, as his high-pitched voice annoyed me, then stared straight ahead.Sweat started to form on my forehead.\u201cSaintess. Are you okay?\u201dI could hear Cass\u2019 voice around me, but I only nodded my head.The sacred power that could have saved ten people so far has been poured out. Yet the gate was still about two-thirds left.My hands were eventually shaking.\u201c\u2026\u201dYeah, it\u2019s the first day right?\u2018Let\u2019s not be too greedy.\u2019I gave strength to my fingertips.Even if the holy power that I can use is infinite, this body, which is the channel of the holy power, isn\u2019t strong enough to use infinite holy power.\u201cReplenish the number of people in the barrier.\u201d\u201cT-The barrier, you mean?\u201d\u201cThose priests, they won\u2019t last long. Still, the barrier must be maintained.\u201dAt my words, the elder priest hurriedly ordered to replenish the priests.Now that I\u2019ve done all I wanted to do, I knew I could easily block this gate as well. However, this gate seemed to be lacking even with my abilities.\u201cGasp\u2026\u00a0gasp\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease stop..\u201dI shook my head at his voice.\u201cJust a little more.\u201d\u201cSaintess.\u201dIt was me who was having a hard time, yet Cass was rather angry.\u201cPlease stop.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dFinally, when I couldn\u2019t stand up any longer, I withdrew my hand. Cass hurriedly supported me the moment I stumbled.My whole body was covered with sweat. It was a hole that had shrunk to about half the size of before, yet demon beasts were still sticking their faces into it.\u201cSaintess!!\u201d\u201cSaintess, are you okay?\u201dThe priests\u2019 voices were heard.In the midst of the mess, Cass\u2019 angry voice also flowed into my ears.\u201c\u2026To this extent.\u201dBut I muttered something more important than that.\u201cIs the barrier blocked well by calling the priests?\u201d\u201cThe priests are blocking it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dAt that moment, my consciousness was clouded.Kyuu,\u00a0it felt like I could hear the sound of Kyuu..When I opened my eyes after a while, I was on the bed.[The use of sacred power is temporarily blocked because you used an amount of sacred power that your body cannot handle.][The sacred power penalty is applied for three days until your body recovers.][The oracle communication is not smooth.]My whole body felt heavy like wet cotton, but I couldn\u2019t lie still because I remembered what had happened before I collapsed.\u201cI have to block the gate\u2026\u201dA gate that was less than half blocked came to mind.\u201cTo protect the original story and my peaceful life\u2026\u201dDoes the fact that the sacred power penalty is applied for three days mean that I have to wait and see how the gate widens without using the sacred power?When I barely got up, I noticed that someone was sitting in a chair next to the bed.Before I could turn my head towards him, he jumped up and leaned over me, hugging me.I opened my eyes wide. Cass\u2019 voice sounded hoarse.\u201c\u2026Ariel.\u201dMy chin rested on his hard shoulder. I was frightened and froze still.Right now\u2026 are you hugging me?\u201cDo you know how surprised I am?\u201dHis voice, which was always smooth, trembled slightly.My mind was a little blank.I pushed his shoulder and asked right away.\u201cW-Where\u2026 is this?\u201d\u201cLloyd\u2019s Merchant Ares district.\u201dUnexpectedly, it was his merchant, not the temple.He gave me a glass of water from the bedside table, and I drank it, gradually came to my senses.\u201cHow much time has passed?\u201dI even remembered that my body couldn\u2019t stand it and collapsed.\u201cAre you thinking of going to the mines again?\u201dI could see his fine brow hardening coldly.I nodded.\u201cSince half of the hole is closed, if I restore the remaining half\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201dHowever, he sternly cut my will.I said to him with a puzzled expression.\u201cWhy? If the delay causes the gate to get bigger, it becomes more difficult. Didn\u2019t the Lloyd\u2019s Merchant also suffer from this incident?\u201dHis eyes widened slightly at my words.But he didn\u2019t back down.\u201cIt\u2019s still not possible. Your condition hasn\u2019t recovered.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand him.\u201cI take care of myself. If I fall again, it won\u2019t do Lloyd any harm.\u201d\u201cThat level of problem\u2026\u201dHis eyes shone brightly.His ultramarine blue eyes are the coldest shade of blue.\u201c\u2026is not what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dThis man, who seemed like a well-learned nobleman or the son of a conglomerate who maintains manners in any situation, gave a somewhat rough voice.\u201cYou can\u2019t get out of here until you are fully recovered.\u201dUnlike the original story, it was a completely coercive tone.I was dumbfounded for a moment, then spoke up to him.\u201cI admit that the Marquis\u2019 help was great to come this far. If it wasn\u2019t for Lloyd\u2019s warp system, the priests wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold out until we arrived, and a great disaster would have happened. But I want you to know that the Marquis isn\u2019t my protector.\u201dJudging from the muscle pain all over my body, my physical condition wasn\u2019t normal, but it was my decision that it was better to end this trip with a quick hit every time.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to give up your stubbornness despite this fever?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not stubborn, it\u2019s a rational decision. You don\u2019t get any damage do you? Who would blame her companion for the Saintess\u2019 collapse while fulfilling her duties?\u201dHowever Cass opened his mouth angrily.\u201cDid you say damage?\u201dAfter a while,his eyes took on a subtle light. It was such an expression that I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was angry or self-deprecating.\u201cAs the Saintess said, I have no right to protect you.\u201dI listened to him, stretching my legs out to the side of the bed to get myself out.Then, Cass, who leaned his back towards me, approached me again.The moment his shimmering, ultramarine blue eyes met my gaze, I felt we were so close.\u201cBut regardless of the damage, I can\u2019t let you go of my own will.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cI have no choice but to go beyond the authority.\u201dThen our faces touched within the breath-taking distance, and one of his fingers rubbed forcefully against my lips.The moment I thought something had slipped into my cracked lips, I resisted, and he pushed me by the shoulders, laying me on the bed.As my body leaned back, the bedding rubbed against my back, and my eyes, wide open in surprise, caught sight of his dark eyes.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThere was a tingling sensation in my fingertips, like electricity, and my heart pounded.I felt the strength in his hand on my shoulder loosen.\u2018The medicine went down my throat.\u2019He slowly rose from above me. My eyes became dizzy and began to spin.\u201cWhat did you feed me?\u201dI asked him, holding on to my fading consciousness.The figure of Cass standing by the bed got blurred.A low voice permeated my ears.\u201cGet some rest. please.\u201dAnd the string of my consciousness was cut again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The unpredictable words lingered in his mouth.\u201c\u2026It did\u2026\u201dGrrrrr.Cass looked down at the source of the pain that had been piercing him for a while.He could see a few drops of blood running down his fingertips. A golden hamster dangled hostilely from his hand, with its teeth stuck in it.Without a change in expression, Cass shook his hand a few times before it was slammed onto the bed.There were bloody teeth marks on his hands.Grrrrrr.It glared at Cass, making a rough noise uncharacteristic of a small creature, and Cass said without much consideration.\u201cShe just fell asleep.\u201dHis ultramarine blue eyes were on Ariel\u2019s thick eyelashes.\u201cTo think that you\u2019re trying to wake up like an idiot like this.\u201dThere was a shadow between Cass\u2019 forehead.He looked at Ariel for a moment longer, then turned around. And he left through the door.Outside the door, the elder priest stood hesitantly.He looked at Cass and asked.\u201cHow is the Saintess\u2026\u201d\u201cShe was conscious, but she immediately fell back asleep.\u201d\u201cWhen is she going to wake up?\u201dThe elder priest asked eagerly, yet Cass\u2019 eyes were cold.He stared at the elder priest with cold eyes. The elder priest was taken aback by the chilling feeling on his spine and then lowered his head.\u201c\u2026We will provide more mercenaries and supplies.\u201dCass said after a while.The elder priest nodded.\u201cThank you, Marquis.\u201d\u201cAnd the divine power of a high-ranking priest.\u201dCass\u2019 gaze turned to the far hallway.At those words, the elder priest made an expression as if he couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cAll the local priests have been brought in. Where is that precious high-ranking priest\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCass started walking forward without answering the elder priest\u2019s words.A cool light shone in his eyes.It was two days later that I woke up.It seems that my fever has risen and I have said some nonsense\u2026 I think I had a lot of dreams too. In fact, I couldn\u2019t remember where either the dream or the reality started.\u201cKyuu.\u201dIt was Kyuu who had been by my side all this time.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cKyuuuuu.\u201dI got up from bed for the first time in a while, stroking Kyuu. It was really time for me to head back to the mines.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201dI spoke to the maid from Lloyd\u2019s Merchant who waited on my clothes.\u201cYes, Saintess.\u201d\u201cWhere is the Marquis?\u201dI haven\u2019t seen Cass\u2019 face since I woke up.I don\u2019t remember how I fell asleep, but I do remember his blazing eyes coming quite close upon me.I found out that I had been transferred to Lloyd\u2019s Merchant in Thiago branch after I collapsed in the mine, but I didn\u2019t know where I was or what I was doing.\u201cHe is clearing out the surrounding commercial bases.\u201dThe maid\u2019s words were acceptable. It must have been one of the reasons he came here.\u201cI was going to greet him before leaving for the mine, but it must be difficult.\u201dFor some reason, I felt a little regretful.After getting dressed, I got ready and left the room.Since the hole was halfway repaired and left for about a week, I had an ominous thought that it might be back to its original state.\u2018I hope it doesn\u2019t get bigger.\u2019When I went down from the main building of the Thiago branch, which was like a mosque in Islam, I saw a lot of people coming to do business, and among them was a carriage sent from the temple.I climbed into the carriage, greeted by the maids and servants Cass had assigned to me.Soon the carriage started running.\u201cIf I can\u2019t stop this\u2026\u201dAs I recalled that moment, my hands were sweaty.\u201cThe original story will be destroyed.\u201dIf the world is filled with demonic beasts pushing through holes\u2026 It\u2019s terrible.Kyle must be busy restoring the Imperial Palace, and Reihausd is now unable to move.I have to solve it as best I can on my line. Above all, Dwayne, I can\u2019t let his sacrifice be in vain.I made up my mind.After a while, the carriage arrived at the mine.\u201cIt\u2019s the Saintess!\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201d\u201cThe Saintess here!\u201dAs with my first appearance, people cheered.The mercenaries, Paladins, and many injured priests were rejoicing.\u2018Don\u2019t look at me with such excited looks.\u2019I walked straight ahead, avoiding their eyes.Pouring a large amount of holy power at once like the last time would be difficult for my body to withstand, so I decided to try to restore it properly and leave.Even if the hole is reduced by 5% a day, it won\u2019t be over in about a month.\u201cSaintess!\u201dThe elder priest who was in command immediately jumped out and greeted me.I nodded and started to enter the dark cave.A thick Magi, a feeling of displeasure overtook me, but my hands were sweaty. Each step was difficult. I think I know the feeling of going to work.\u201cThe Saintess has arrived!\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201dAnd soon, when I reached the barrier, I saw about thirty people gathered in a small space.A barrier that is still like a tight net.Tired-looking priests, sweating Paladins, and mercenaries.And\u2026 the entrance to the gate I was restoring with all my might.As I slowly raised my eyes and looked at the entrance to the gate, I was taken aback.Because the size of the gate entrance remained the same as when I left.If you don\u2019t suppress it with strong force, the cracks will gradually increase, but why\u2026?However, there was no time to think deeply.I reached out and pointed to the gate. Then, holy power that tickled like a gift spread through my hand.\u201cOooh! It\u2019s holy power!\u201d\u201cSaintess!! Oh, Gods!!\u201dLeaving behind the unpleasant exclamations, I filled the hole.Whether it\u2019s because of the feeling, it seemed that the divine power was spreading more smoothly than before.In a blur, the oracle reappeared.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, blesses you.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, blesses you.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, blesses you.]In front of my eyes, there were a lot of notices sending me messages as if they were giving me strength.\u2018Alright, I\u2019m going to quickly close the hole and go back.\u2019I concentrated, and soon a cold sweat broke out.\u201cThe gate is almost blocked!\u201dThe cheers of the priests were heard.Of course, saying that it was almost blocked was an overstatement. What was left of the half-blocked gate was another half left.\u201cHuft, huft.\u201dSoon I started to get out of breath.I slowly lowered my hand, regaining my strength.The elder priest came running and helped me.\u201cAre you okay, Saintess?\u201d\u201cFor today\u2026 I will stop here.\u201dI straightened up and said.I won\u2019t overdo it like last time. If I did, it would be difficult for the next job.\u201cHurry up and bring the Saintess.\u201dAt the words of the elder priest, the Paladins surrounded me. And a stretcher was placed next to me.I looked at it for a moment and waved my hand. Climbing up here will draw more attention.\u201cI can walk out.\u201dI started walking through them.I could feel the awe-inspiring gazes of the people behind me. It was still burdensome for them, but now that I was certain that I would be able to completely restore the gate in about three days, my heart felt a little lighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, the lord held a reception. In the meantime, it seemed that he was losing his mind and couldn\u2019t hold the welcome ceremony.The lord is an elderly man who has managed the territory of this province for generations.The size of the banquet was small compared to that of the Imperial Palace, but it was still full of delicious food and alcohol.However, I didn\u2019t touch alcohol other than food as I was tired.[The God of Art, Mond, sees the alcohol and licks his lips.]I looked at the status window in front of my eyes and smiled.After the dancers with unique skin colors danced out, the atmosphere at the banquet increased.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the Saintess, something really serious would have happened.\u201dThe lord, who was sitting across from me, raised a glass and thanked me.I responded with a light smile.\u201cEven though it\u2019s not due to a good thing, it\u2019s an honor to meet the Saintess while I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor.\u201dI was praised by the officials who seemed to be vassals of the lord.It was uncomfortable because I only saw them for the first time. Still, I wanted to treat guests, so I sat down and ate my food in moderation.\u201cExcuse me, Saintess\u2026\u201dThe music stopped for a moment when the lord spoke to me.\u2018What is he trying to say?\u2019I looked at him with a puzzled lookThe lord opened his mouth with a dark expression on his face as if it was difficult to get his words out.\u201cIf the Saintess gives me the honor of being able to stay for seven days after the gate is restored and treat you\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, but I have a lot of work at the temple.\u201dI cut off his offer at once.The vacation wasn\u2019t bad, but I didn\u2019t want to stay too long.Seeing my tired face, he nodded his head.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cI will just accept your feelings.\u201dThe exciting music started playing again. In a matter of minutes, the dancers who came out changed their clothes and danced.By the way\u2026 I thought Cass would obviously come too, but why didn\u2019t he?After waking up, I hadn\u2019t seen Cass again, thus I was curious about his whereabouts.I looked around and asked the lord.\u201cI have a question, but the priests keep quiet and won\u2019t answer.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAfter I collapsed while repairing the gate at first, when I looked for the gate again, it was the same size.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 The priests would have done their best to keep it.\u201d\u201cTo say that, I understand that the priests dispatched here have already run out of divine power. The second dispatched priests haven\u2019t even arrived yet.\u201dI could see him break out in a cold sweat at my words.\u201cBesides, during the days I was down, there weren\u2019t even any priests guarding the mine. The lord\u2019s castle delivers the priest\u2019s shift schedule, yet no priest has ever been to the mine. There are only eyewitness accounts of the lord\u2019s soldiers guarding the mine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 That is\u2026\u201dThe lord\u2019s expression was somehow awkward.Is there a secret temple belonging to Ares?Normally, a middle-ranking priest has the power of ten lower-ranking priests, and a senior priest has the power of ten middle-ranking priests.The high-ranking priests have greater divine power than senior priests, but there are less than ten of them in the Empire.A total of four high-ranking priests came to Ares and Reihausd was one of them, yet all four, including him, were now immobile. It was because they were all injured just like Reihausd.In order to maintain the gate for a few days in a state where all the priests\u2019 spiritual strength is exhausted, it would require the divine power of a high-ranking priest, or perhaps a senior priest comparable to that of a high-ranking priest\u2026I couldn\u2019t find such a priest on the list.\u201cI can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s hard to answer.\u201dI ate some more food and got up.Naturally, the music stopped and all eyes were on me.\u201cI really enjoyed the food you served. But I think I should get going now. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to digest it.\u201dAt my words, the lord and his retainers jumped to their feet.\u201cS-\u2026 Saintess!\u201d\u201cI have no intention of asking difficult questions. However, from Elium, I risked my life to come to Ares\u2019 aid, and I feel very bad at the thought that the lord is hiding an important secret.\u201dThe faces of the vassals and the lord were stained with bewilderment.Soon after, the lord got up from his seat, approached me, and knelt down on his knees.\u201cWhat the Saintess thinks\u2026 It\u2019s absolutely not that Ares has saved the power of a temple.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I speak out, the people of Ares may suffer great damage, so as a lord, please be considerate of what I can\u2019t bear to tell you.\u201dThere was a sense of urgency in his trembling voice.Because of this, I was able to deduce that some high-ranking priest came to help, and he had threatened the lord not to reveal what he had done.I was curious about who it might be, yet I decided to quit.\u2018Perhaps, similar to me before, there may be other people who have circumstances in which they have to hide their powers.\u2019\u201cAlright.\u201dI nodded.Then I turned around and went to my accommodation, but the lord caught me again.\u201cS-Saintess.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cI heard that His Highness the Crown Prince will arrive here in about five days. I\u2019m planning to hold a grand banquet in time for His Highness\u2019s arrival, but I wonder if the Saintess can come too\u2026\u201dKyle?I tilted my head and thought.If it takes five days, it means that he started ten days before.\u2018It would be hectic just cleaning up the Imperial Palace now.\u2019As it was a bit difficult to refuse him twice, I finally accepted the lord\u2019s offer.I felt countless eyes on me as I returned to the accommodation. Anyway, living as a saintess is very tiring.\u2018Anyway, why is he saying Kyle\u2019s coming to me?\u2019At that moment, the lord\u2019s words of wanting to treat me seven more times came to my mind.I paused.\u2018Wait. Could it be that the damned rumor has spread all the way here?\u2019It was a rumor that had nothing to do with me now, that the Saintess liked the Crown Prince.That\u2019s why treated the Crown Prince and me to this extent\u2026 Did they come up with a plan to let us spend time together to express their appreciation for me?I was overcome with the desire to turn around and deny it.However, if I overreact here, rumors that a strong negative means a strong positive may circulate again.Eventually, I walked out of the banquet hall.\u201cSaintess. Are you going back?\u201dThe Paladins ran straight to meet me.I shook my head lightly at them and said my destination.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dAt my words, the Paladins showed puzzled looks on their faces.\u201cWell, I was curious and a little worried.\u201dIt was because the face of Cass, whom I hadn\u2019t seen throughout the banquet, came to my mind.***As I entered Cass\u2019 living quarters, I felt a strange commotion.\u201cThe Marquis\u2026\u201dI grabbed a Cass\u2019 henchman among them, whom I was familiar with, and I asked what was going on. He bowed his head at me with a puzzled expression.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say this, but he has been in bed for the past two days.\u201dThe subordinate opened his mouth again with difficulty.\u201cHe\u2019s in bed? Is he sleeping?\u201d\u201cYes. He used up a lot of energy\u2026 It seems difficult for you to meet him.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is worried about Cass.]\u201cStill, since I\u2019ve come all the way here, I\u2019d like to see his face.\u201dI walked past them and stood in front of Cass\u2019 door.Seeing me, the maids hurriedly withdrew from the door.Upon entering his room, a subtle scent pervaded the room. It was like a healing scent that calms one\u2019s mind and body.In his large room, a large bed was all over the place and there was a faint groaning sound.I slowly walked towards Cass.He was lying there with a face in pain.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, grabs his chest.]Cass\u2019 hard, firm upper body was exposed as if he was during treatment.\u201c\u2026Cass?\u201dI heard he was in bed, was he sick?Bewildered, I moved closer to him.There was a drip of sweat on his stiff arms. And his eyebrows, which hadn\u2019t changed in emotion, were greatly frowned.I reached out and took his hand. Then it wrapped around me. My heart skipped a beat at the sight of his suffering.\u201c\u2026Since when did this happen?\u201dCass\u2019 subordinate answered my question from behind.\u201cHe\u2019s a little more stable than the first time. Two days ago\u2026\u201dHis words faded.\u201cIt was worse.\u201dIt looks painful enough now, yet it must have been harder than this.I held Cass\u2019 hand and placed my forehead on his. Then the holy power began to flow.A warm and cozy feeling in my hand.This will ease his suffering.But that was only for a moment.My holy power couldn\u2019t flow to Cass and was blocked.There are only a few cases where the holy power doesn\u2019t work.A disease caused by a wound in the heart, or a case in which a priest exhausted all the holy power within their body.And in the case of a powerful curse from a high-ranking demon.\u2018Which of the three is it?\u2019They said his condition was better than two days ago, so it mustn\u2019t have been caused by a curse.\u2018There\u2019s no way this man who doesn\u2019t believe in the Gods has holy power.\u2019Heartache doesn\u2019t suit Lloyd either.\u201cI will be by his side tonight.\u201dFinally, I sighed and said. I couldn\u2019t leave Cass like this.The Paladins who shouted in surprise followed my words.\u201cSaintess! It\u2019s not possible!\u201d\u201cSaintess, you need to rest today as your holy power is consumed too much!\u201dI resolutely opened my mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I will stay here today.\u201dI can\u2019t heal Cas directly, but letting go of divine power into the air will help stabilize his mind and body a little. It was one of the priests\u2019 indirect healing methods.For me who couldn\u2019t get on the warp magic circle, Cass stayed with me for one night.\u2018So let\u2019s say I\u2019m paying off the debt at that time with this.\u2019I turned my gaze to him. His rather long eyelashes cast a dark shade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI could see the faint energy of sacred power entering through Cas\u2019s nose.As it\u2019s an alternative therapy, it won\u2019t have a direct effect, but his mind and body still will be a little more comfortable.Some of the times he had boiling fever. Whenever that happened, I wringed out a wet towel and wiped it on his forehead.His fine brow furrowed, yet he didn\u2019t open his eyes.As the night deepened, it became dark outside the window.There were only a couple of orange interior lights in the room, and I was starting to fall asleep, probably because I used a lot of energy.As I wiped the towel on Cass\u2019 forehead, I fell asleep. No, rather than falling asleep, would it be correct to say that I dozed off and woke up multiple times again?How long has it been, I wondered.When I opened my eyes and looked out the window, it was still dark.\u2018Looks like I fell asleep for a while.\u2019I put my hand on Cass\u2019 forehead.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t as hot as before. His complexion also seemed better than before.\u2018Even if this happens, I don\u2019t know when his condition will deteriorate.\u2019I sighed lightly and got up from my seat, thinking that I should take a quick nap in the cot.As soon as I lay down, darkness came.I think I had a dream.My funeral home, people\u2019s hissing voices and lonely scenery. I even dreamed of my stepmother and stepsister tidying up my room.There was no sign of joy on their faces, as they didn\u2019t like that they couldn\u2019t harass me anymore. It was bitter yet annoying.And it was when I opened my eyes after a panoramic dream. I was buried under a white blanket. Something hard touched my forehead.\u2018What\u2026 is it?\u2019I raised my head and pushed it away. Then a bright light entered my eyes.The first person I met with a little frown\u2026\u201cMar\u2026 quis?\u201dCass Lloyd. It was him.I was so surprised that my eyes widened.Still shirtless, he was lying by the bed, looking at me.I just woke up from a dream and couldn\u2019t tell what the situation was.I mean\u2026 Why are we in the same bed?\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201dThe light wind gently moves his dark hair, probably because the window was left open.Cass\u2019 ultramarine blue eyes were calm, and there were no signs of sickness in his high nose and red lips.I grabbed the blanket, jumped up from my seat.\u201cWhy\u2026 Why\u2026\u201dI was so bewildered that I couldn\u2019t speak properly.\u201cWhen I woke up in the morning, I found that you were sleeping uncomfortably, that\u2019s why I moved you to the bed.\u201dCass\u2019s low voice echoed in my ears.\u201c\u2026Me?\u201dThen he nodded as if there could be no one else.Only then did I have time to look at my clothes with the burning sensation in my cheeks subsiding a little.It\u2019s the same as when it was worn.I began to come to my senses gradually.\u201cPerhaps you imagined a different situation?\u201dHe asked, revealing his tough upper body, which I hadn\u2019t been able to recall in his usual cold-headed image.Given that state, isn\u2019t it natural to imagine a different situation?However, I\u2019m a saintess. I decided to protect my dignity and looked away.\u201cThat can\u2019t be true. I was dozing off in the chair, but I was just surprised that I was in bed. By the way\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026You seem to be in good spirits.\u201dI tried to ask if he had recovered, yet somehow I decided not to ask because this situation was unfair.I got out of bed, followed by him, also slowly raised his upper body.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, evaluates Cass\u2019 body very favorably.][The God of Art, Mond, gives a favorable review saying that if his upper body is at that level, \u25a0\u25a0 can be expected.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, agrees with Mond and says his words are correct.]Ah\u2026 I don\u2019t want to see these naked-related conversations in the morning.I turned around and spoke nonchalantly.\u201cSometimes you told me not to overdo it, and that was what I was going to tell you. If you move without thinking about your body, the people around you will only worry.\u201dCass didn\u2019t answer.Presuming that he was looking at me with expressionless eyes as always, I poured out my words.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad you seem to be getting better. You recover well. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow after the restoration is over. Then I\u2019ll get going.\u201dAfter roughly packing my things, I reached for the door when I suddenly felt a heavy feeling behind my back.I was startled and tried to turn around, yet my back was blocked and I couldn\u2019t turn.It wasn\u2019t long before breathing was heard over my shoulder.Only then did I belatedly realize that Cass was coming up behind me and closely following me.\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt reminded me of Cass\u2019 solid body and the fact that he was taking off his top.Surprised, I caught my breath.I thought he was sitting on the bed, since when did he come without a sign?He was holding my right arm tightly.\u201cDid you take care of me yesterday\u2026 because you were worried?\u201dCass asked a question that had nothing to do with what I said.I barely managed to calm my beating heart and opened my mouth.\u201cIt was just what I had to do. You accompanied me all the way here, yet the fallen Marquis got stuck in my heart, so I morally\u2026\u201dI imitated a fairly calm voice, but my body stiffened with tension.His breathing could be heard quite close.\u201cMoral\u2026 Is there any better word to describe our relationship?\u201dCass laughed softly and continued.I spoke to him calmly.\u201cYou seem to be still distraught.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to make each other awkward because of a mistake, a pointless slip of tongue.\u201dHis dark eyes twinkled.I knew about the thoughts one could have impulsively when a man and a woman are in a room.However, he\u2019s one of the three male leads\u2026 Above all, it\u2019s Cass Lloyd.A man with cold blood, who acts with plans and intentions in everything. I can\u2019t help but be wary of his behavior like this.At my words, Cass\u2019 hand gradually loosened.\u201cYes, a mistake\u2026 It sounds like a mistake to your ears.\u201dA moment of silence passed between us.Without saying a word, I slipped away from him, quietly opened the door, and left.My heart was beating.***The moment Ariel left, Cass went over to the window instead of going back to bed.A mountain range covered in clear skies and ice caps. The magnificent scenery in front of him was one of the reasons he liked this city.He licked his lips.\u201c\u2026Moral.\u201dThe ultramarine blue eyes had an unusually bitter light.\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201dCass spoke quietly, as if he was speaking to someone who couldn\u2019t hear.Soon, a pathetic smile passed across his lips.\u201cI\u2019m just weak-minded.\u201dWith his long career as a merchant, Cass understood people\u2019s innate tendencies better than anyone else.It was to the extent that he could deduce one\u2019s upbringing background and personality to some extent just by looking at one drinking tea.And among the women he had ever seen\u2026 she was a woman who pretended to be strong yet weak-minded.\u2018A woman who can be leaned on, but doesn\u2019t easily lean on.\u2019She calculated more fiercely than him, yet didn\u2019t act according to the correct answer.Though she obviously had the most reasonable answer, she refused and went straight without calculations.That\u2019s why she stayed up all night like that last night to take care of him. Because of her weak-mindedness, she did things that didn\u2019t help her.Even the moment she collapses after halfway repairing the gate.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are.\u201dSince she was such a holy saintess, he couldn\u2019t forget the way she sold stolen properties.When he offered to buy her garnet necklace for 10,000 franc, even her eyes, the moment she refused, were wary of him.\u201cEven my own behavior with you now.\u201dHe himself didn\u2019t know whether it was for observation or his eyes just naturally gazed upon her.However, the obvious thing is that even though he acts cautiously with his thorns upright like a hedgehog in danger, sometimes he can\u2019t take his eyes off the unstoppable figure.Ariel was a very unusual existence that was beyond the scope of Cass\u2019 calculations.And last night, when she was lying on his bed, furrowing her beautiful eyebrows and digging into his arms, did she know that Cass almost lost his common sense?Cass put his hand on his forehead, going back to bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will completely fill the hole today.\u201dActually, I planned to go to the mine after recovering for a day or two more.But now that I\u2019ve heard that Kyle is coming, I feel like I need to finish the job a little sooner.\u201cI understand.\u201dHowever, all of a sudden, the status window flashed.[The connection with the oracle is disconnected.]Hmm, why is it like this again?***I thought it would be easier to connect to the oracle by blocking the gate, but today it didn\u2019t seem to be going well.In any case, only the oracle wasn\u2019t connected, the divine power was still able to be used. After a bit of hesitation, I headed for the mine. Yeah, is there anything wrong?When I arrived at the mine, the appearance of the mine was no different from yesterday. I saw priests, Paladins, mercenaries, and they bowed their heads to me.Receiving their greetings, I entered a dark cave.\u2018Now, let\u2019s finish filling up this damn hole and go back.\u2019\u201cIs the Saintess here?\u201d\u201cOh, Saintess!\u201dThe aisles filled with men made way for me like a miracle of Moses.At times like this, I feel like a superhero in a hero movie.I saw a hole left about half the original size. The net-like barrier had loosened quite a bit as the number of demonic beasts escaping from the hole decreased.\u201cThen before we begin\u2026\u201dI started doing simple stretches.\u2018National gymnastics begins!\u2019Relax your neck, shoulders, back, and legs\u2026\u201cWhat is the Saintess doing?\u201d\u201cIt seems to be a ritual, yet looking at the sky, it must be a sacred ceremony for the Gods.\u201d\u201cMay Hetuse blesses.\u201dMy ardent believers have attached meaning to stretching. And the priest who diligently wrote down my national gymnastic moves seemed to follow me.After finishing turning my ankle regardless, I cleared my throat once and reached out my hand.After a while. A silver light began to radiate from my hand. At times like this, my hands tickle the most.A beam of light radiated from my hand and reached the hole.Then the wall around the hole began to be restored.I had a hunch that I could definitely finish it by the end of today.I concentrated more and poured my sacred power.\u201c\u2026Saintess! The gate is almost restored!\u201d\u201cSaintess! Just a little more now!\u201dIt was definitely accelerating and the end was in sight.Yet at some point, suddenly, something shook under my feet.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs it an earthquake?\u201d\u201cWhat was it, just now?\u201dThe mercenaries stopped and looked around.A brief earthquake could happen anywhere. As soon as it calmed down, I thought it was no big deal.Then I focused on my hands again.With the single-minded thought that the radiant light will quickly finish this task and I can return. And at that moment, something flashed inside the gate.\u2018What\u2026?\u2019I was overcome with anxiety from not seeing the unexpected.\u2018Just now\u2026 Just now\u2026 !\u2019There was nothing more to think about.A crack started from the hole I had been working so hard to fill.The bottom split open as if a zipper had been unzipped.\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cThat is?!\u201dI heard the surprised voices of the Paladins.The crack created a hole that was larger than the original hole underneath.\u201c\u2026How crazy!\u201dI unconsciously cursed.I had no time to think about my authority as a saintess or anything like that.How hard I had recovered, though!As I watched the crack grow again, curses came out first.I watched the situation with my mouth wide open, unable to hide my shock.Inside, the dark legs of the giant insect I saw at a glance came out at high speed. At the same time, the barriers the priests were setting shattered.\u201cCough!\u201d\u201cUgh!!\u201dA strong wind blew and screams could be heard everywhere. And the intense Magi felt through my skin.The same feeling I had when I met Diego Vester. I had goosebumps all over my body.By the time I realized something was wrong, it was too late. When I looked back, everyone in the aisle had collapsed on their spots. As if they fell asleep in an instant.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019The fact that it doesn\u2019t affect me is probably because the sacred power is protecting me.I raised my hand nervously.It was a rift that I had managed to fill with all my strength over the course of several days.Yet now the rift is back to its original size\u2026 Or maybe even wider than that.I don\u2019t know what happened or who did it. All I can do is take a few slow steps away from the demonic beast in front of me.The ragged gate was soon pulled back like a curtain. And against the background of the purple light, the sound of drums were heard.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe inside of the cave was covered with vicious Magi. It was as if a weight had been placed on my shoulders.If it\u2019s this level of Magi\u2026 I thought that it wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary monster.\u2018Dangerous.\u2019And it revealed its true self, which I had guessed a little bit.\u201cEw\u2026\u201dAs soon as I saw that existence, I let out an exclamation.I hate bugs. Insects too.\u2018Insects and bugs look gross, so what\u2019s the need to tell them apart?\u2019And in front of my eyes, I saw a huge monster that I had seen so many times in fantasy movies that I was sick of it.It seems that it was the giant Spider Queen\u2019s forepaws that split the gate, which was the size of a group of spiders.In the center of the hideous Spider Queen was the face of a woman, and she wore a crown of sharp iron.Her lips parted, revealing a terrifying smile.I reached out and launched holy power into the Spider Queen\u2019s face.As her human face seemed to be her weakness rather than the armor-like black body.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe Spider Queen\u2019s expression twisted as if she saw a powerful light reflected in a mirror. And then she lifted her front paw, thumped, and slammed the front of me down, as if she thought she had to get rid of me.\u201cUgh!\u201dI ducked behind to avoid the Spider Queen\u2019s front paws, and rammed her on the buttock.Luckily, I did well at dodging her front paws, yet the problem came next. The impact caused the cave to shake and the stones began to fall.As my body fell backwards,\u00a0 numerous demonic beasts were seen behind the gate, standing behind the Spider Queen.Sitting on the floor, looking up blankly, I saw countless of them lined up behind the Spider Queen. Goosebumps ran all over my body.A line so long with no end in sight. Lots of giant spiders and all sorts of oddly shaped demonic beasts.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a situation in which I couldn\u2019t do anything. Perhaps even repairing the gate to this extent felt like a trap.In the first place, it wasn\u2019t a matter of restoring the gate itself.The demonic beasts that came out through the gate were low-level ones, yet the ones behind them would probably do enormous, unpredictable damage to the Empire.Was the Demon Realm preparing for war?\u201c\u2026\u201dIf I shoot sacred power at the Spider Queen again here, she will swing her front claw and destroy the cave.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Gathering my holy power, I couldn\u2019t bear to shoot it at the spider again and hesitated.At that moment, the giant front paws of the Spider Queen pounced on me.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI tried to protect myself by scattering the holy power gathered in her hands over my body, but it was a situation where I couldn\u2019t tell if I would be safe even if I got hit by that.But at that moment. The Spider Queen\u2019s paws stopped abruptly.I stood still with a stunned face.\u201c\u2026\u201dFalling small stones, and sand were all still in the air. As if time has stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My father did.\u201d\u201cDo you know the terrible chaos this gate has brought about?\u201dTo my words, Diego replied with a puzzled look.\u201cWhat answer are you expecting? Should I be interested in humans dying?\u201dThere wasn\u2019t the slightest hint of remorse on his face.In a way, Diego was right.He was the heir to the lofty Demon Realm, who didn\u2019t regard humans as much as they did when they had claws, so human lives couldn\u2019t be more important.\u201cI\u2019m talking about my mental confusion. Do you enjoy tearing down someone else\u2019s hard work?\u201dStill, I had the right to complain.\u201cI\u2019m fully reflecting on myself for using you. But revenge brings another revenge, so that\u2019s enough. It\u2019s tough enough.\u201dAt my words, Diego stared at me. As if he was interested.\u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken, but as I said earlier, the gate was opened by my father.\u201dHe went on.\u201cQueen Arachne is Father\u2019s henchman. It has nothing to do with me.\u201dDiego\u2019s gaze was on the stopped spider\u2019s paw.Although he\u2019s a character (?) that doesn\u2019t appear directly in the original story, I knew from reading the book that Diego\u2019s father was the Demon King, Leto.Because when Ariel in the original story made a contract with Diego to harm Camilla, there was a part where she asked,\u00a0\u201cAre you the demon king Leto?\u201d\u00a0Also, that monster is Queen Arachne, the servant of Demon King Leto.However, Diego was thoroughly drawing a line between himself and the gate business.Aren\u2019t all demons on the same side?\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter all, I met him on a single wooden bridge and I couldn\u2019t help but ask the main point.\u201cWhy did you stop time?\u201dIf he wanted me to die, all he had to do was watch.However, seeing him stop the time and even draw a line between himself and the Demon King, Leto, made me wonder.No way\u2026 Do you want to help me?\u201cI think it\u2019s good timing.\u201dHis purple eyes flashed.\u201cTo make a contract.\u201dI was taken aback by the sudden word \u2018contract\u2019.The turning point where Ariel of the original story definitely took the dead route was the contract with Diego Vester.\u201cYou, a demon, are making a contract with me, a saintess?\u201dDiego continued in a dry voice.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to live?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you sign a contract with me, I will spare your life.\u201dIn front of my eyes was the tower-like bridge of the monster queen, Arachne, and time stopped. And he was asking for a contract at the cost of my life.Behind me, numerous priests and knights had fallen.If I refuse his offer, it will put me and them in danger.Demons like to make contracts in exchange for human souls. The contract he made with Ariel in the original story was the same.\u201cWhat is the contract about?\u201dI asked him, keeping as calm as I could.***Monsters were pushed out of the mine with a huge explosion. Queen Arachne, legions of spiders, trolls, and even humanoid monsters.But what shocked people was that all the monsters were corpses.Along with the heavy explosion sound, countless corpses fell off the cliff and became a mess.The lord\u2019s soldiers guarding the mine were shocked to see the dead bodies of the monsters.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was looking at the reconnected oracle window in front of me with a blank expression.[The oracle has been activated.][The Gods are hurriedly looking at your condition.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, blesses you.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, blesses you.]Unlike the Demon Realm, which borders the northern and southern hemispheres, the Gods are outsiders.Extremely powerful, but unable to manifest as a body like the Demon King, and thus beings with limitations in communicating through oracles\u2026And I\u2019m the only human being stuck between them (?).However, the Gods couldn\u2019t see me because the oracle was disturbed by powerful Magi.Maybe what happened with Diego\u2026 They won\u2019t know\u201cUgh. Saintess.\u201dA soldier\u2019s voice came from behind.\u201cUuuggghh.\u201dThe priests were also wriggling and recovering their spirits.Suddenly, however, a loud noise was heard.\u201cThe captives who were taken to the Demon Realm are back!\u201d\u201cSir Paladin!\u201dWhen a priest pointed to the far end with his index finger, dozens of people were lying where his eyes were directed.I got up and found a familiar face.Dwayne passed out among them.A priest ran up, and I heard that he was breathing. A momentary sigh of relief came out.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief\u2026\u201dEven this expedition, which wasn\u2019t very good, was profitable. Hearing that he was taken away, I honestly felt uncomfortable the entire time.Cheers were ringing in my ears.\u201cThe gate\u2026 The gate is blocked!\u201d\u201cThe Saintess has recovered the captives!\u201d\u201cLong live the Saintess!\u201d\u201cThe gate is blocked! Thank you, Saintess!\u201dLeaving behind the cheers of the people, I trudged out of the cave.A familiar dialog popped up in front of my eyes.[Hidden Mission Success][Would you like to receive a reward for completing the Hidden Mission?(Yes No)]I decided to accept the reward slowly and stood in front of people.\u201cThe Saintess defeated the monsters!\u201d\u201cOh! God Hetuse!\u201dOkay, great news for you guys, but I\u2019m in big trouble right now.The moment I let out a sigh.\u201cAriel.\u201dHearing a familiar voice, I turned my head.I couldn\u2019t help but to be surprised.\u201c\u2026Your Highness the Crown Prince?\u201dRed hair resembling the sun and red eyes. It was Kyle.I took a couple of steps toward Kyle.Then the invisible hill below was revealed, and the army he had brought was visible. It seemed to be thousands, tens of thousands of knights and soldiers.It was like watching a scene from a fantasy movie with well-equipped ranks, armor, and weapons that seemed to have been prepared for war.I looked up at him with a surprised expression.\u201cI ran straight away, but it seems to be late.\u201dThe moment I first saw the legion behind Queen Arachne, I thought it was the end when the gate was opened and the monsters came out.But the moment I saw Kyle\u2019s eyes, I knew it would never be a one-sided fight.Demons are stronger than humans, but the Sword Master, Kyle, is also someone who has surpassed the level of humans. And these armies will slaughter the monsters as they are. Of course, it would cause enormous human casualties to our troops, too.\u201cDid you block the gate?\u201dKyle\u2019s lips twitched.I looked at him nervously.The setting sun was dazzling, and his expression was difficult to see.\u201cIt turned out to be easier than I thought.\u201dI answered appropriately. It was because I thought there was no need to tell the story of meeting Diego.But at that moment, Kyle suddenly reached out to me.Startled by the unexpected movement, I stared blankly at him as he raised one of my hands. His ruby-red eyes were burning with various emotions.Suddenly he shouted like thunder. It was a voice so loud that it shook my shoulders.\u201cSaintess Ariel!\u201dAt Kyle\u2019s voice, the eyes of many people down the hill turned to me.\u201cHas stopped the war against the Demon Realm!\u201dAs soon as Kyle finished his words, the shouts of the soldiers resounded like a chorus.The soldiers, who saw the mountain of monster corpses falling down the cliff, were already excited.\u201cOohhh!\u201d\u201cThe Gods bless the Empire!\u201d\u201cPraise the Saintess!\u201d\u201cSuch a great holy power!\u201dThere were screams so strong that the earth shook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He drew his sword and threw it into the cave where the gate was.Swoosh.I thought I could hear a sharp cut through the air, but then I heard something getting pierced.\u201c\u2026Kyaaaagh!\u201dHe threw his sword like a spear into the darkness of the cave where the gate had been. And soon, the sound of a sword loaded with a strong aura piercing something was heard.A spider monster, which I hadn\u2019t noticed before, was sitting down with its stomach sliced.It was a very fleeting moment.The soldiers, who had been silent for a while, roared again.\u201cLong live the Crown Prince!\u201d\u201cLong live the Crown Prince! Long live the Saintess!!\u201dFeeling like a munchkin with the Crown Prince as my assistant, I recalled what had happened earlier.***Inside the cave, I bit my lower lip.No matter how I thought about it, there was only one decision I could make. Either die here, or sell my soul to him to get out of the situation and extend my life.If I were a saintess full of faith, I would have chosen an honorable death without hesitation, but I also don\u2019t want to die here.And then Diego spoke to me in a calm voice.\u201cBecome a real saintess. That is a condition of the contract.\u201dAt his words, I stared at Diego Vester for a while with a bewildered expression.\u2026The terms of the contract aren\u2019t my soul? Besides, the condition is to become a real saintess?\u201cYou must have considered yourself a fake saintess until now. You must have thought of leaving your place and living a free life if Camilla, the real saintess, appears.\u201dDiego\u2019s next words were very shocking.\u201cHow do you know Camilla?\u201dAfter a while, his purple eyes shone coolly at my words.\u201cHow can I not know bitch?\u201dIn an instant, the Magi, that was violently swaying in the air, was terrifying enough to make me get goosebumps.\u201cDiego, you know the original story. No, did they say it was a prophecy?.\u201dI told him, recalling what Van and Ren had said.The fear that had filled me faded, and in the meantime, a stuffy mind sprang out. The truth that neither Van, Ren, nor the Gods tell.\u201cWhat is the real content of that prophecy?\u201dThe happy ending I read was half of the original one.The remaining half contains catastrophic content. I didn\u2019t get a proper explanation though.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of questions, but I don\u2019t feel like telling you.\u201dDiego\u2019s eyes were cold.Is there even a no-spoiler clause? Soon he went on.\u201cThe more I think about it, the more disgusted I become.\u201dWhat is half of the prophecy about, why does Diego hate even mentioning it?\u201cYour job is to realize that you are a saintess and live as one.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you gain from me doing that?\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t know the true content of the prophecy, at least I had to know why he was offering this contract.At my words, he paused for a while before opening his mouth.\u201cSo where do we start? Do you know that my father opened the gate to kill you?\u201d\u201c\u2026The reason the Demon King opened the gate is because of me?\u201dI asked with my mouth wide open.Diego nodded his head with a nonchalant expression.\u201cYes, it is. This gate is covered with magic power so powerful that only a saintess can restore it, so you would have had to come.\u201dA little dazed as I felt stabbed on the back of my head, I came to my senses and asked him.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSaintess Ariel gets in the way of the \u2018prophecy\u2019. To kill you.\u201dDiego\u2019s purple eyes glowed dry.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill me for interfering with the prophecy? Could it be that your father, the Demon King Leto, wants the prophecy to be fulfilled?\u201dDiego nodded lightly and pursed his lips.\u201cAnd I don\u2019t wish the fulfillment of that prophecy.\u201dI was in a moment of confusion, but calmly sorted things out.So Diego is at odds with Demon King Leto.Demon King Leto is trying to get rid of me who is in the way to fulfill the \u2018prophecy\u2019 of the original story.On the other hand, Diego doesn\u2019t want Camilla to fulfill the prophecy of becoming a \u2018real saintess\u2019.That\u2019s why he wants me to play the role of a saintess and disrupt the prophecy.\u201c\u2026What is the deadline?\u201dAt my words, Diego\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cOriginally, every contract has a deadline.\u201dAlthough it was true that I felt fear, it was something that needed to be clarified.It was a life-and-death situation, but I was desperate as I didn\u2019t want to be tied down for the rest of my life because of this contract.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re funny. Even in this situation.\u201dDiego\u2019s lips twitched slightly.After a while, his purple eyes glowed with a deep, hazy light.\u201cI never intended to tell you this, but I intend to rebel against my father, Leto.\u201dAnd a shocking plan flowed from his mouth.A dread came over me at the thought that I was involved in something more far-reaching, yet I managed to keep my composure.\u201cPerhaps the point at which the contract is no longer necessary is after my work is over?\u201d\u201cAnd the reason you tell me all these stories is because the role I play is so important.\u201dThe corners of his lips twisted at my answer.\u201cYou have a good understanding.\u201dIn front of my eyes is the sharp blade of Queen Arachne. In front of her is Diego Vester.\u2018There are countless people\u2019s lives behind me.\u2019Ironically, those who wanted to protect the original story were trying to harm me, and those who wanted to destroy the original story offered me a chance to live.I hesitated for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cI will make a contract.\u201dWhen Van and Ren referred to the second part of the prophecy as \u2018catastrophic content,\u2019 I didn\u2019t listen much. It\u2019s a story about Camilla, and I, a supporting villain, thought I just had to find my own way to live.Rather, I didn\u2019t want the original story to be twisted. I was the only one trying to get out of this story.However, as Diego said, if the Demon King actively tries to harm me for the sake of the prophecy\u2026I can\u2019t help but cooperate with Diego.And more than anything else, I had to live with the people behind me.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if I continue to hold out in the position of a saintess, right?\u201d\u201cAlright. The contract is done.\u201dHis eyes shone ferociously.\u201cAh, I forgot to mention, if you break the contract, the price is your soul.\u201dAs if he never wanted to be involved, he said threateningly with an evil expression.\u201cI don\u2019t think you forgot.\u201dHe must have said it intentionally after the contract.At my words, Diego\u2019s eyes narrowed strangely.\u201cI like it because you\u2019re quick-witted.\u201dHis voice continued.\u201cOne thing to note, I can\u2019t use much power in the temple.\u201d\u201cIn the end, I have to keep my seat on my own. That\u2019s what you mean, right?\u201dAt my words, he nodded lightly.The original villain, Ariel, failed to push Camilla away or hurt her. Because, of course, she was a \u2018fake\u2019.However, now I have become \u2018real\u2019, and even if another \u2018real\u2019 Camilla appears, I must keep my position as a saintess.\u201cLet\u2019s do it. So please, get rid of those things in front of my eyes.\u201dI answered in a firm voice.I don\u2019t know if the Demon King and Camilla are related. Wasn\u2019t she a real saintess?Why does the Demon King want the fulfillment of the \u2018prophecy\u2019? A number of thoughts swirled in my head.And then an unknown incantation in an ancient language came out of Diego\u2019s mouth.\u201cPaetur.\u201dDiego\u2019s purple eyes began to shine more intensely.Time, which had stopped for an instant, began to flow again, and stones and soil poured down. Yet Queen Arachne\u2019s sharp legs remained lifted.His lips licked once more.\u201cDominatuo.\u201dAs the meaningless words flowed out, Queen Arachne\u2019s eyes began to turn purple.It was a power that was different from the mind control that he had previously displayed as the Guild Leader of the Deviamon Guild.It occurred to me that if Diego had used this power then, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop it even with the pendant. And gradually the monsters started to move.Splash.Squelch.With a violent rupture that seemed to tear skin and leather, the floor began to get wet with a sticky liquid.The monsters were advancing, but as soon as they passed through the gate, their eyes turned purple then they started attacking each other.I covered my mouth with both hands while watching the scene of the fierce fratricide.Diego Bester, the terrifying villain who is the mighty ruler of the Demon Realm.Now he was helping me.Diego raised his hand as the prepared legion was nearly annihilated. It looked like they were trying to restore the gate again.I looked up at him and opened my mouth.\u201cWait.\u201dDiego turned his gaze to me and stared at me.\u201cPlease return the prisoners before closing the gate.\u201dI could see his eyebrows twitching at my words.\u201cIf I want to gain a reputation as a real saintess and solidify your position, don\u2019t I need the prisoners?\u201dSince I signed a contract with the demon, I also had something to get from him. The people who were dragged into the gate, including Dwayne.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is it because my power has doubled?If this reward had been made before the fight in the cave, I thought that even dealing with Queen Arachne alone would have been worthy. Although it\u2019s in the past.In the evening, after a while, the lord hastily held a banquet for Kyle and his knights.And it was prepared with two magnificent chairs attached like the seats of a king and queen.I sat next to Kyle with a strange feeling.By the way, the lord just sent a wink. He seemed to be praising his own sense, but I\u2019d like to have a few words with him.\u201cIt\u2019s a happy day when the Saintess extinguishes the fire of war. However, the monsters scattered from the mine are still targeting the people without being wiped out.\u201dKyle said with a stern expression to the generals who were excited about the well-prepared food table.\u201cPlease refrain from drinking tonight.\u201dThe knights looked a little disappointed at Kyle\u2019s words.\u201cYour Highness the Crown Prince. Still, it\u2019s a happy day\u2026\u201dThe lord glanced at him and said to Kyle.Yet he opened his mouth without a single brow twitch.\u201cIt looks like you want to be at the forefront of the sweeping battle tomorrow.\u201dAt his words, the lord stepped back.\u201cI\u2026 I apologize. Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cIf I had to pick one of us who deserved a drink.\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes focused on Kyle\u2019s words.He licked his lips.\u201cAmong us, it\u2019s only the Saintess.\u201dAt that, the knights nodded.They seemed to think that since I had blocked the gate that would have led to great bloodshed, the biggest credit was on me. In addition, a huge number of monsters had been wiped out.\u201cSaintess, shall we bring you a drink?\u201dThe lord immediately asked me.\u201cN. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then\u2026 Let\u2019s start the banquet.\u201dAfter a while, the lord gave a signal and the performance started. Soon, the banquet hall was filled with the voices of the loud people.\u201cHow is the situation outside?\u201d\u201cWe also sent enough meat and bread to the soldiers.\u201dKyle calmly took care of his men even in the midst of a noisy banquet.The lord was eagerly talking about this and that in front of him, and he seemed full of will to look good to him.I was munching on the food in front of my eyes when someone turned to me and said.\u201cExcuse me, Saintess.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI heard that even though all the priests put their full effort, you blocked the gate that was getting bigger by yourself. Through the Saintess, I feel that the Gods exist.\u201d[The God of Love, Odyssey, shrugs.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, raises his nose.](fyi, it\u2019s like being extremely prideful)[The God of Destruction, Ciel, wags his tail.]\u201cMoreover, they say that the Saintess slaughtered powerful monsters with your powerful holy power.\u201d\u201cBless the Empire. Blessings on Ares\u201dThe Gods were shrugging at the people who often came to me and bowed their heads while stamping their gazes.The music gradually changed to a cheerful atmosphere. The dance time has come.The noble ladies of Ares glanced at the dignified knights from the capital. The knights also wanted to approach and ask for a dance, yet they were in a mood to be wary.\u201cAriel.\u201dHearing Kyle\u2019s voice, I turned my gaze to him.He glanced outward.\u201cEnjoy yourself suitably, and come out.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201dThen he walked out first.It seemed to him that I was looking at them because I wanted to dance.\u201cYour Highness. Will you just go?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m exhausted from travel sickness. I\u2019ll have to go to bed.\u201dHe left the banquet hall, though he didn\u2019t look tired at all.His servants followed quickly after him.The knights seemed a little awkward at first when they noticed Kyle went out, yet they quickly asked the ladies to dance.Not wanting to be the focus of people, I slowly walked toward the door.A few knights looked at me, but I gestured with my index finger over my mouth and escaped without the lord looking. If caught, there was a strong possibility of him bothering me.When I came out, a sharp horse stopped in front of me. It was a horse I had ridden before.I opened my eyes wide and looked up. Kyle, who had exited the banquet hall ahead of me, leaned over and extended his hand.Seeing my puzzled expression, he opened his mouth.\u201cIt took quite a while.\u201d\u201cYou told me to come out after having fun.\u201dKyle laughed at my words.\u201cI did.\u201dThen he turned his body, grabbed my hand, and lifted it towards him with force.I climbed up like I was being hugged in front of him with the feeling that my body was floating. Burdened by the posture, as if I was hugged like a princess, I hurriedly crossed one leg over the other.Of course, the fact that he was still close behind my back is burdensome.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, feels a little sorry for your empty hands.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, licks his lips remembering the thigh incident.]Ugh, the mistake of the hunting festival that I don\u2019t want to remember was about to come to mind.\u201cGo!\u201dSoon he started running the horse.The horse kicked off the ground and ran through the lord\u2019s castle. It was somehow embarrassing to see the soldiers glance at me.The wind swayed my hair.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201dAs we were about to leave the gate, I asked him.\u201cYou\u2019ll find out when we\u2019re there.\u201dKyle didn\u2019t give an easy answer.After leaving the lord\u2019s castle, the horse rode through the darkness. The soft half-moon moonlight was shining, yet it was dark outside.In modern times, even in rural villages, lights are often turned on, but in this world, in a rural area like this, it was almost natural to leave the castle.\u201cI can hear the sound of wild animals.\u201dHearing the wolves, I muttered, and Kyle\u2019s voice came from behind.\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true. I\u2019m with the Sword Master.\u201dThe only thing that intimidated me a little was the darkness and desolation, but I didn\u2019t think something might appear and harm us.\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good answer.\u201dKyle\u2019s voice was heard.I said nothing more. Soon the horse climbed and descended a rather steep hill and stopped at the shore of a quiet, secluded lake.The man who got off the horse before me held out his hand. I got off the horse as if I was, once again, being hugged by Kyle.We soon started walking closer to the lake. I walked along Kyle at a slower pace.The vast lake contained the Milky Way in the sky.\u201cWas this our destination?\u201dKyle responded to my words.\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201dStep by step, I stood on the edge of the lake.The lake at night is also quite pretty. It feels like I\u2019m\u00a0 in a country like Switzerland.[The God of Art, Mond, loves the scenery of the lake.]\u201cI like it. The atmosphere feels nice, though?\u201dI looked at the twinkling stars in the lake.There were hundreds of times more stars than the ones I saw when I looked up as a child.\u201cI need to hear about this thing earlier.\u201dAs I stared at the surface of the lake, I heard Kyle\u2019s voice.I turned to him.It was dark, so I couldn\u2019t see his expression very well, but I could tell he was looking at me.\u201cI looked at the corpses of the monsters.\u201dIt was what he expected to ask.\u201cI can\u2019t understand that the holy power has made their condition to that extent.\u201d[The God of Justice, Hetuse, is curious about what happened in the mine.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is curious about what happened in the mine.]Even the Sword Master, Kyle, who sent a giant spider in one blow, wouldn\u2019t be able to easily deal with the corps alone.However, no matter how saintly I am, the fact that I, a healer, killed all those monsters\u2026 It\u2019s nonsense.\u201cTraces of a strong attack, as if it had been hacked to pieces. It wasn\u2019t even a sword scar, it was very irregular scars.\u201dI had felt that I wasn\u2019t the main character of this story and that I was not in my place.But now it\u2019s time to become the real main lead.The contract with Diego Vester.Until he defeated the Demon King Leto, I had to carry out my contract with Diego.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was the kind of person who would understand even a clumsy lie anyway.\u201cSo, does that mean someone assisted you?\u201dAt his words, I hesitated for a moment.\u2018Can I say that Baron Diego Vester is actually the heir to the Demon Realm?\u2019And what will Kyle do if he finds out that I made a contract with the demon?I could feel Kyle\u2019s gaze staring at me as I closed my mouth. There was a deep suspicion in his eyes.\u201cYou always had a secret.\u201dAfter a while, his low voice was heard.\u201cBut if you want to keep a secret, you\u2019d better be careful what you do.\u201dI looked back at him.An overbearing force was felt in his red eyes.\u201cIf anything had happened to you, I would have dug it out like a wild dog. Regardless of your will.\u201dIs it a worry-like threat or a threat-like worry?Only the deep eyes in the darkness stared at me for a long time with disapproving eyes.The direction of the answer, whether I could tell him the truth, slanted in one direction.It was when I finally opened my mouth to say something.\u201d I\u2026\u201dIt was an instant when something suddenly reached out from behind me.Kyle immediately drew his sword, and I held out my hand toward it ahead of him. It was an instinctive act to protect myself.I could feel the expression of Ciel\u2019s blessing, which still had a strong effect.Then, with a crackling sound, I saw it collapse, spewing sap. It was a plant-eating monster that probably came out of the mine.Kyle\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he drew his sword.Soon, he looked at me with dark eyes and slowly inserted the blade into the scabbard.The ground was bursting with monsters as messed up as the trolls he had killed before.\u201cDid holy power originally also have attack skills?\u201dI stood still as my mind went blank on how to explain it.So, this was because of the hidden mission reward. The effect of Ciel\u2019s blessing\u2019s amplification.I heard his low voice.\u201cA while ago, you asked me what kind of ability you would use to defeat monsters.\u201dHe seemed to be misunderstanding.\u201cIt\u2019s different from before\u2026 So, this isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201dEmbarrassed, I shook my head, and in a daze I pointed to a thick tree standing next to me. Then the enormously thick tree tumbled over with another roar.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not a big deal, you say.\u201dBecause I wasn\u2019t able to control the strengthened Ciel\u2019s blessing.\u201cThere was a reason for your confidence.\u201dIt seemed that he had already concluded it as my own achievement.His eyes darkened as he looked at me. Deep curiosity that touches me desperately.\u201cWho are you?\u201dIt was a different question from when the rock was purified.The night wind was blowing over the lake. It gently tickled my hair.***The next morning, I was walking alone in the lord\u2019s castle.Currently, I\u2019m in a very disturbed state. The reason was that I was misunderstood as a munchkin who hid my power so far from the most ferocious male lead in the original story I had read.I explained that this was also a type of holy power, yet Kyle didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cGood night. When I return to the Imperial Palace, I will ask for sparring.\u201dTold you, not in that category!I\u2019m a saintess, not a munchkin.Jumping up, he took me to the inn.Kyle seems to be strangely isolating himself even among people, though he seems to have looked at me with the kind of eyes he uses to see his own people.Phew, I sighed and shook my head, trying to shake off yesterday\u2019s events.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is curious about what happened in the mine.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, is curious about what happened in the mine.]Then, looking at the floating oracle window from earlier, I said sternly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t intend to tell me the second part of the prophecy, don\u2019t even ask.\u201dThen the oracle window went silent.I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re angry or they shouldn\u2019t talk about it.The only clue to the \u2018prophecy\u2019 given by the Gods was the illusion seen through the emotion at that time.However, I hadn\u2019t yet been able to conclude that Camilla was the woman in the fantasy.\u201c\u2026You will have to take responsibility for half of the loss.\u201dIt was when I was immersed in complicated thoughts and was frowning at the oracle.A man\u2019s voice was heard from somewhere.I looked in the direction where the voice came from and turned my head. Then I saw two men sitting at a tea table in the garden. One was the lord, and the other was the neatly dressed Cass.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is relieved to see Cass\u2019 healthy complexion.]Several servants and maids were seen around them.\u201cB-But the damage to the territory is great\u2026\u201d\u201cI remember asking the lord for the protection of Lloyd\u2019s assets in the estate and paying the appropriate cost.\u201dThe lord was at a loss at Cass\u2019s resolute words.\u201cI did, but I never imagined something like this would happen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a monster, is it?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe guys who raided our merchant were bandits.\u201d\u201cT-That can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dCass\u2019 eyes were cold.\u201cThis has already been confirmed at the Merchant. Those soldiers who became bandits because you exploited them without paying them properly.\u201dCass\u2019 words made the lord\u2019s face pale.\u201cThat means it isn\u2019t a \u2018special case of natural disaster\u2019 in our contract.\u201d\u201cBut the reward\u2026\u201d\u201cThen we have no choice but to reduce the handling of lord\u2019s specialties. Because there are many mines to replace.\u201d[The God of Justice, Hetuse, shakes his head at Cass\u2019 inhumanity.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, shines in his eyes, saying that it\u2019s more fun to subdue a person who has no mercy.][The God of Art, Mond, agrees with Oman.]Ah, the Gods are starting another useless percentage debate.The lord was seen to be taken aback by Cass\u2019 knife-like words.\u201cM-Marquis!\u201d\u201cOne-third of the estate\u2019s revenue is from ore, so wouldn\u2019t it be difficult?\u201dIt was as if it were measured with a ruler, without an inch of error.Looking at Cass, I remembered him from the original story that I had forgotten until now.Yes, Cass was such a man.He wasn\u2019t a bad guy like a vile loan shark, but he was a cold-hearted merchant who put the best interests of the Merchant at the forefront, prioritizing capital over people.\u201cT-Then\u2026 We will take care of half of it.\u201dIn the end, the lord lowered his face and said so.A third of the estate\u2019s revenue comes from ore, and if the Lloyd, who controls virtually all of the region\u2019s ore exports, doesn\u2019t cooperate, the finances will be in jeopardy.That\u2019s why he had no choice but to accept Cass\u2019 words.\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that I had a conversation with the lord more than I thought.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dCass drank the tea gracefully, ignoring the lord\u2019s expression, which looked like a bamboo statue. He looked like a nobleman without the slightest disturbance.I stared at him unconsciously, but I belatedly stepped back.\u2018He\u2019s going to find out I\u2019m here.\u2019And I started going back the way I came.I plan to stay in the lord\u2019s castle until today and return tomorrow. I don\u2019t know what kind of schedule Cass or Kyle have.It was time to slowly walk back along the stone walkway. Suddenly, a,\u00a0thud,\u00a0was heard from behind.I glanced back.\u201cWhy are you running away?\u201dIt was Cass\u2019 voice.It seemed that I had been caught looking too closely.Ehm, I cleared my throat and said.\u201cI\u2019m just going back because I feel like I\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, laughs at your excuses.]Be quiet. MondHe looked at me and put a small smile on his lips. It was a different look from the serious look without a smile in the conversation with the lord earlier.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop\u2026 I haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad. It wouldn\u2019t have been interesting anyway because its content was pointless.\u201dHe replied.I nodded. And after a while, I opened my mouth again.\u201cHowever\u2026 Is your body okay?\u201dI could still see him groaning in bed.He then nodded.\u201cThanks to the Saintess, I was able to easily shake it off and get up.\u201dI was going to ask if he was overdoing it because of me, yet I decided to stop.\u201cIs the Saintess all right?\u201dI smiled at Cass\u2019 question that followed.\u201cYou heard the news.\u201d\u201cI heard that you blocked the gate and even killed the monsters.\u201dNeither of which I did, but I nodded awkwardly.His gaze turned to my eyes and scanned my body. As if to see if there were any injuries anywhere.And again, he looked into my eyes.Cass seemed to notice that I didn\u2019t want to talk much about it.He opened his mouth, then closed it again, and soon he turned the conversation to the other side.\u201cBut yesterday at the banquet\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t come to the banquet.\u201d\u201cI went to the banquet hall late.\u201dI opened my eyes wide at his words. I thought he didn\u2019t attend because he wasn\u2019t feeling well.Yet he said he came late?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yet there was no one I was looking for.\u201dThe words just broke my heart.Because I thought I might be the one he was looking for.\u201cThere was no one I\u2019m most wary of.\u201dAt Cass\u2019 words, I looked at him with trembling eyes.Somehow, it was a strange atmosphere.\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know the Marquis came. I wish I could have met you.\u201dHis last appearance, which seemed dangerous, was caught in my eyes, but I said calmly. I smiled as if nothing had happened.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201dAt my words, he licked his lips with a stiff expression.\u201cIt would be rude to ask who you were with last night.\u201dI didn\u2019t do anything wrong, yet my heart raced for nothing.I hesitated for a moment, then bid him a goodbye with an awkward expression.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going.\u201dA light breeze blew and gently rustled his hair.Cass hurriedly caught me as I was leaving as if he had something to say, then he asked.\u201cAre you leaving tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI plan to go back after sorting out the situation at the branch here a little more.\u201dI heard that he was staying a little longer to clear out the remaining monsters, but he also seemed to have quite a few things to organize.\u201cI see. Please be careful.\u201dAt my words, he took a step closer to me.\u201cYou\u2019re the Saintess, be careful. Don\u2019t put yourself in danger like last time.\u201dI let out a light laugh when I remembered the time I was alone with Cass while I was wearing the pendant.\u201cYes. I\u2019m going to be careful.\u201dHowever, Cass shook his head and replied.\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that.\u201dI stared at Cass with puzzled eyes.\u2018That\u2019. Are you saying this isn\u2019t the case with the warp system I\u2019m obviously thinking of?He was staring at me coldly with his mouth closed. I had a strange feeling because the cool eyes seemed to really penetrate me.Even though I thought that Cass had no idea what happened with Diego in the mines, I had a strange feeling.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll be going now.\u201dI paused for a while, then turned around and started walking. I felt his gaze on the back of my head for a long time.I set off with the Paladins before dawn.A person from Lloyd\u2019s Merchant accompanied me, and I had received Cass\u2019 permission to use the warp system.It took a considerable amount of time for us to arrive at the warp system after overcoming hill roads and bumpy slope roads.I was taking off my necklace to avoid making the same mistake as last time when I heard the sound of horses hooves running wildly.When the dust cleared, dozens of people got off their horses. The faces of the lord and elder priests, as well as some priests and officials, were visible.\u201cSaintess!\u201dAt the urgent cry, I frowned, wondering if the gate had exploded in the mine again.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe lord rushed over and lowered his head.\u201cTo think that you\u2019re leaving without saying anything like this\u2026\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dMy tension was relieved for a moment, and I let out a small sigh.\u201cI was surprised. I thought the gate had exploded in the Demon Realm again.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNothing. I just wanted to go quietly.\u201d\u201cAs expected\u2026\u201dPeople looked at me in awe as if they were looking at the crystal of modesty.The truth was that it really bothered me.Soon Kyle will head to the Imperial Palace again, but if he joins, it will be difficult to use the warp gate and there are many things to worry about.It was an inconvenient journey when I came here, so I wanted to go while enjoying my thoughts and relaxing.\u201cThen a small one\u2026\u201dThe lord held out something to me.\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t even come here hoping for a reward.\u201dThe first word is, again, customarily a refusal.\u201cIf we let our benefactor, the Saintess, go like this, I will be uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I hope you will accept this small gift.\u201dI put on a slightly troubled expression.In fact, there was nothing special at the banquet, so I criticized the lord\u2019s spending, but for him to chase after me for several hours like this and give me a present, I need to withdraw my evaluation.\u201cIf the lord is really uncomfortable.\u201dI received the gift with an expression that I couldn\u2019t help it. However, I happily accepted it in my heart.It was a small package, but usually the smaller the package, the more valuable it is.I unwrapped the package in front of him. Inside was a small jewel the size of a fingernail.\u2018What is this?\u2019It wasn\u2019t even a diamond, it was reddish.\u201cIt\u2019s the only lithium holy stone in the Empire that has been found in our mines only twice in its hundreds of years of history.\u201d\u201cA holy stone?\u201d\u201cUsually, ores with strange powers are called magic stones, but this ore has such holy power that it\u2019s a treasure that has been handed down from generation to generation in our family.\u201dI held up the small jewel.It did have a bizarre appearance.\u201cWhat power are you talking about?\u201dThe lord looked around and spoke in a low voice.\u201cYou can save someone whose heart is about to stop.\u201dHearing that, I was surprised.\u201cSave someone whose heart is about to stop, you say?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. This holy stone, which is called the blessing of the Great God, is so great that even those who set foot in the Salerium (the palace of the God of Death) can be saved. Moreover, the blessings of the Great God will be upon those who are revived by lithium.\u201dAccording to the lord\u2019s words, it\u2019s a greater item than most holy relics.\u201cIs it okay to give me such a precious thing?\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the Saintess, the demons would have taken over the territory and even the lives of the families wouldn\u2019t have been saved.\u201dI held the jewel in my hand and nodded.\u201cI see. If you think you\u2019re going to have that kind of debt\u2026 Let me take it.\u201dIt was an unexpected gain. Even if I poured out my holy power, it was quite difficult to save someone from the brink of death.\u201cThen please\u2026 Be careful. And no matter which one you choose\u2026\u201dThe lord\u2019s voice became a little quieter.\u201cPlease remember me.\u201d\u2026What does that mean?For some reason, Kyle\u2019s face came to my mind, but I just decided not to think about it.\u201cOf course I have to remember you.\u201dI smiled and nodded while holding the jewel and headed for the warp gate. I could feel the lord groveling from behind.\u201cI see you\u2019re in good spirits.\u201dSuddenly, I heard Dwayne\u2019s voice. He still had one arm wrapped around like a cast.\u201cOf course I am. We\u2019re going home.\u201d\u201cAre you going to sell that thing at the auction house too?\u201d\u201cI guess I should have just left you to rot in the Demon Realm.\u201dAt my words, the Paladins around me laughed.Dwayne put his other hand on his forehead.\u201cYour words and actions have become more rude.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you fall in the midst of a war.\u201dAfter stepping on top of the gate, we were enveloped in a halo of light. The image of the lord and the crowd watching us faded.It was time to go home.***The road to the capital was peaceful.Occasionally, if there was a place with pretty flowers in full bloom, I would stop the carriage and spend time there. It was my own healing time to spend after finishing a difficult homework.Paladins were more anxious to look good to me than before. Now that I, who had been the image of a sickly and incompetent saintess until now, had accomplished such a great feat, it was only natural that their evaluation of me would change.An apprentice Paladin, the youngest member of the Holy Knights, abruptly held out a bouquet of flowers to me.\u201cI made a bouquet for the Saintess.\u201d\u201cOohh, Theo, this guy. Such a timid fellow.\u201d\u201cSaintess, I\u2019m more confident in my ability to make bouquets. My family runs a flower shop in my hometown.\u201dI smiled leisurely as I smelled the scent of the bouquet.\u201cThen please make me one too, Jade.\u201dPlaying the queen wasn\u2019t too bad either. Where my eyes go, their eyes go, and they react to my laughter.Does it feel like I\u2019m a goddess in awe?[The God of Art, Mond, prefers Theo to Jade.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, clicks his tongue, saying that Mond has a consistent preference for blonde hair.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, prefers Dwayne\u2019s loyalty.]\u201cJade, Theo, thank you. The bouquets are so pretty.\u201dA warm breeze rustled the two bouquets in my hand.\u201cThe Saintess is much more beautiful than bouquets of flowers.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Saintess.\u201dHearing their compliments made my ears tickle and my cheeks warm.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, wags his tail.]I asked while looking at the two apprentice Paladins who looked younger than the other knights.\u201cHow old are you two?\u201dThen Jade cleared his throat and said.\u201cI\u2019m a year older than Theo, the new guy.\u201dTheo then refuted Jade with excitement.\u201cJade is only older, he\u2019s still childish.\u201dDwayne, who had been sitting there, interjected with a grin.\u201cWhether thirteen or fourteen, you\u2019re both newbies. Isn\u2019t that right, Saintess?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s right\u2026\u201dI replied hesitantly as I was bewildered inside.No, why are these guys\u2019 faces so mature?I\u2019m also seventeen here.\u201cHow old is Dwayne by any chance?\u201dI asked Dwayne, surprised by Theo and Jade\u2019s ages.Judging from his physique and face, and his position as the 2nd Holy Knights\u2019 Commander, I wondered if he would have been around thirty-five.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about me?\u201dDwayne scratched his head and said.\u201cAll the members said that I look younger.\u201dHmm, then about forty?\u201cI\u2019m twenty one.\u201d\u201cPuh\u2026\u00a0Cough\u2026\u00a0Cough\u2026\u201dI held my breath in hurry and choked.What a nonsense.

I saw a dazzling face looking at me with his back against the temple.Reihausd.His golden eyes were on me. Unlike when I left the temple, he seemed to have regained some of his complexion.I suddenly turned my gaze to his side. There was a person I had never seen before in the temple.Platinum hair swayed in the breeze, and emerald-clear green eyes looked at me.My heart thumped.\u2018\u2026Camilla?\u2019***\u201cThis is Camilla Ibelle. She came from the Luchen region.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Saintess.\u201dAt the dinner table, I was greeted by Camilla with a bewildered expression.My mind was very complicated.Gorgeous blonde hair with beautiful turquoise eyes.The moment I saw her, I could tell it was Camilla, the female lead of the original story. She had the full name, Camilla Ibelle, and her appearance was exactly as I had imagined.\u2018But\u2026\u2019It was five years later that Camilla appeared as a saintess. Only in about four years.When I signed the contract with Diego, I never thought that Camilla would appear so early.\u201cNice to meet you, Camilla.\u201dI calmed down a bit and looked into her eyes and replied.\u201cNice to meet you too, Saintess.\u201dCamilla smiled lightly. Her laughter alone made the surroundings sparkle as if they were in full bloom.\u2018Is this the female lead\u2019s halo?\u2019\u201cWhen I was injured in the Ares Mine, my life was saved with Camilla\u2019s help. I promised to sponsor her because she was studying theology. That\u2019s why she came to me.\u201dReihausd told me.Then Camilla went on.\u201cAt that time, I hadn\u2019t even dreamed that he was the High Priest. I can only thank the Nine Gods for giving me this opportunity.\u201dHmm, that\u2019s how it happened.In the original work, the mine gate incident didn\u2019t happen.So, this was an unexpected variable. Since the flow has turned like that, there is nothing strange with the fact that Camilla appears earlier.\u201cThink of this place as home and stay comfortably.\u201dI spoke to her with kindnessIf it wasn\u2019t for my contract with Diego Vester, I would\u2019ve packed right now.Doing such while saying,\u00a0this damned saintess thing is over!\u201cThank you.\u201dCamilla happily bowed her head in response.After a while, Reihausd stared at me and spoke.\u201cHowever\u2026\u201dHis golden eyes were full of worry.\u201cI heard that you consumed a lot of holy power. They said that you even suffered from exhaustion. Are you really okay?\u201dI nodded my head with a nonchalant expression.\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry. I recovered well while I was there.\u201dHe let out a small sigh.\u201cConsider that your health is the most important thing. You should at least recover a little more, yet your face is showing fatigue as you continue the long journey.\u201dI laughed at the nagging words.\u201cThat is what I\u2019m going to say. Is Sir Reihausd okay?\u201dWhen I left the temple, Reihausd\u2019s face was really incomprehensible. They say he\u2019s fine now, but his skin still looks pale.\u201cI got better because the priests did their best to help.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dAt my words, Reihausd looked at Dwayne and said.\u201cDwayne.\u201d\u201cYes, High Priest.\u201d\u201cFor the time being, keep an eye on the Saintess so she doesn\u2019t go outside.\u201dAt his words, my eyes widened.\u201cPardon me? What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cEvidently, your body hasn\u2019t recovered, but it\u2019s obvious that you will go outside. For seven days, stay at the temple under the care of the priests.\u201dI gave a disgruntled look at Reihausd\u2019s firm words, yet he didn\u2019t change his mind.\u201cYou\u2019re too overprotective. And Dwayne was dragged to the Demon Realm due to a work accident. Doesn\u2019t he need a vacation?\u201dI glanced at him.I heard Dwayne cheering from the side.\u201cGod bless you!\u201dCamilla was looking at me with a warm smile.I heard Reihausd\u2019s voice again as I stared blankly at Camilla for a moment unconsciously.\u201cAriel.\u201dI turned and looked at him again. His golden eyes, which normally looked cool, shook warmly.\u201cI am very glad that you returned safely.\u201dA low voice reached my ears.\u201cI\u2019m also glad to see you in good health again, Sir Reihausd.\u201dI replied with a wide smile.Afterwards, I had a short meal with Reihausd and Camilla.Camilla was exactly what I imagined when I saw the original story. She was lively and warm-hearted, and had an energy that made being around fun. To the extent that I thought that there would be no one more suitable for the position of a saintess than her.After thinking about it, my heart felt a little strange. I felt like I was wearing clothes that didn\u2019t fit my body.It was when Reihausd briefly left after hearing Dwayne\u2019s remarks.\u201cIt seems that the High Priest really cares for the Saintess deeply.\u201dCamilla said to me with a light smile.\u201cIs that so.\u201dI replied with a meaningless smile.\u201cI also want to get close to the High Priest, but there are times when he\u2019s a little cold.\u201dCamilla said with an awkward smile.\u201cHe looks cold on the outside, but he\u2019s a warm person on the inside.\u201dUnknowingly, I wrapped Reihausd up.\u201cReally?\u201dCamilla asked in surprise, and she continued.\u201cActually, the High Priest almost killed me in the mine\u2026 In fact, it still scares me a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sir Reihausd did?\u201dI asked, bewildered by the unexpected words.\u201cIt was probably a mistake. He might have thought I was a demon\u2026 Because I was reek of the blood of a monster. Right after escaping from the monster\u2019s attack.\u201dA little chaos was added to her story.She smiled lightly and asked me something.\u201cHowever\u2026 I think the High Priest really likes the Saintess. This may be a rude question, but is there anything special between you two?\u201dHer eyes were full of curiosity.\u201cNo. But I think he\u2019s a wonderful person.\u201dI shook my head and answered without thinking.Camilla had a little smile at my answerAccording to Diego, the Demon King wants the prophecy to be fulfilled. Yet Camilla was attacked by demons because of the gate opened by the Demon King?\u201cAnyway, the High Priest who killed that monster was trying to kill me next\u2026 Then he collapsed. When I got closer, I saw that he was seriously injured.\u201dCamilla turned her eyes as she recalled the situation.\u201cHow fortunate it was for me to be able to help the High Priest, even with weak divine power.\u201dIs she really unaware of the situation in which the Demon King is hoping for the fulfillment of the prophecy?I looked at her, hiding my complicated thoughts.and nodded her head.\u201cAh. I must have misunderstood the two of you. You seem to get along really well.\u201dThen she moved the question to another topic.\u201cBy the way, when did the Saintess manifest your holy power?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I manifested my holy power two years ago, and she was discovered by Reihausd and brought to Elium. It\u2019s not a very fun story. My memory is fuzzy.\u201dThe reason I became a saintess was when I was a fake saintess, so I evaded it appropriately.\u201cI see. Well, I was so surprised to hear what happened in the mine this time.\u201dCamilla said to me with her green eyes shining.\u201cClosing the gate of the Demon Realm, and besides, defeating countless monsters. People say that among the saintesses of the past, the voices of praise are so loud that you\u2019re comparable to that of the First Saintess.\u201dIt was even more embarrassing to receive such praise from the original female lead.\u201cNo way. I was just lucky.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re also humble.\u201dI also decided to ask Camilla questions.\u201cDoes Miss Camilla have any kind of\u2026 holy power?\u201dCamilla\u2019s appearance sped up, that\u2019s why I wondered if her manifestation of holy power might have sped up as well.Camilla, who heard me, slurred her words as if it was nothing.\u201cAlthough I have divine power as a residual skill, it\u2019s insignificant compared to the Saintess\u2019 holy power.\u201dThen her holy power hasn\u2019t manifested yet.I remembered [The Return of Saintess Camilla]. In the original story, it was said that Camilla\u2019s holy power was discovered late.Yet she didn\u2019t say anything more and just smiled humbly.After that, Reihausd didn\u2019t appear for a long time.My face was a little hot, probably due to the wine, so I decided to go out for a night breeze.Camilla was happily chatting with Dwayne, who had returned.\u201cI\u2019ll be out for a while.\u201d\u201cAh, Saintess. I will accompany you.\u201dDwayne tried to faithfully carry out Reihausd\u2019s order to keep close.\u201cDwayne. Don\u2019t make me regret saving you from the Demon Realm.\u201dDwayne tried to get up, but at my warning, he sat down.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even the Saintess needs some freedom.\u201dYou mustn\u2019t repay kindness with being an enemy.I left, opened the door, and started walking. But after a while, someone called me.\u201cAriel.\u201dLooking back, I saw Reihausd standing in the dark.\u201cSir Reihausd?\u201dHe took a step closer to me. And he said to me, who was looking up at him.\u201cI, towards Ariel\u2026\u201dReihausd\u2019s voice was subtle.I could see his red lips moving in the dark.\u201cI thought you had no interest in me.\u201dA strangely trembling voice in a deep echo.I blankly listened to his voice and stared into his golden eyes.I couldn\u2019t understand this sudden conversation.\u201cUntil now, I misunderstood that you were avoiding me. But I\u2019m glad you have a good impression of me.\u201dThen he reached out and gently brushed the tip of my hair. The wine I drank earlier made my face even hotter. Reihausd also seemed to be drunk, as his cheeks were flushed.His voice penetrated my ears. For an instant, I remembered what I had said to Camilla earlier.[I think he\u2019s a wonderful person.]Did he hear that?The moment I remembered the conversation from earlier, he jumped at me.Reihausd\u2019s eyes were right in front of my line of sight.I said in bewilderment.\u201cUh, I was just talking from an objective point of view\u2026\u201dAt my bewildered answer, he asked with his beautiful gold eyes shining darkly.\u201cIn your eyes\u2026 How do I look?\u201dTo be honest, he\u2019s the strongest in the world in terms of beauty. His preference, preference, and preference\u2026 The problem is that part is unique.\u201cI\u2019m curious about your honest feelings. Ariel.\u201dHad I known he was listening, I wouldn\u2019t have said anything about him being wonderful in the first place, I regretted it belatedly.\u201cI mean, you look great because you\u2019re the High Priest. You seem amazing, dealing with the difficult and complicated work of the temple\u2026\u201dAs expected, I couldn\u2019t say that I was attracted to him as a man.Reihausd\u2019s golden eyes shook as he watched me speak more.\u201cIs that so.\u201dUnlike the excited expression from before, it was a very calm expression. For some reason, I feel a sense of guilt.\u201cThe High Priest is only the High Priest, that\u2019s it.\u201dMaking such a handsome man sad makes me feel like the world\u2019s worst woman.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I overreacted again. Even with your little attention, to the point it\u2019s burdensome.\u201dThe slightly trembling eyelashes cast a shadow under his beautiful golden eyes.\u2018What should I do?\u2019It was when I was hesitating whether to appease him even a little, or just hit the iron wall as it is.Reihausd took my hand on my shoulder and led it to my sword. And he pulled out his sword without hesitation.A cool blade illuminated by the moonlight. In an instant, a chill went down my spine.\u201cSir Reihausd, what are you doing now\u2026\u201dCould it be that he was going to do something to me just because he was hurt? I opened my mouth in surprise.And a low voice came from his mouth.\u201cStay still.\u201dThe tip of his sword, which had been roughly pulled up, suddenly headed for the pillar behind me.\u201cI can hear something rustling.\u201dJust then, an old priest with shiny hair and a pale face came out from behind the pillar.\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop. Just calm down.\u201dI knew his name.Chief Priest Heinz. He was the one who returned from being dispatched in the early days when Magi flowed from Ares Mine.And when I first came to the temple, he greeted me with disrespectful glances or strangely ignored me.\u201cAh. You must have been the Chief Priest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying this in case you misunderstand, but I haven\u2019t heard anything. High Priest, and the Saintess.\u201dSweat could be seen pouring down his forehead.\u201cWhether you heard it or not.\u201d\u201cHigh Priest.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll make a decision after talking about why he was hiding alone here, on the opposite side of the Chief Priest\u2019s residence.\u201dReihausd raised the corner of his lips and put his sword back into the scabbard. And he looked at me and pursed his lips.\u201cSaintess. I think I need to talk to the Chief Priest.\u201dI saw Heinz\u2019s face darken.I bewilderedly greeted Reihas and turned around.For a moment, I forgot because Reihausd\u2019s appearance is like the main character of a romance manga. That he commanded the Empire\u2019s largest temple from the top and supervised the priests.I went back to the dining table, thinking, \u2018Can\u2019t you show me your charismatic self only?\u2019***It was after I entered my room after dinner with Camilla.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dAfter coming out of the bath, I swung my hand in front of my eyes.\u201cWhy are you so quiet?\u201dThe normally sparkling chat window was silent.When I thought deeply about when this happened, it seemed like it had been since I arrived at the temple earlier.\u201cAnybody there?\u201dEven with the sound, the chat window was calm. It\u2019s never been like this before except when there were enemies in the mine. The only thing that has changed is Camilla\u2019s arrival.\u201cPerhaps\u2026 is it because the real saintess appears?\u201dI was talking to myself.As expected, no one answered, but it was a plausible reasoning.I am a fake saintess, and now that the real saintess Camilla, the main character of this story, has appeared, all the Gods of the oracle have moved to her.Isn\u2019t that the perfect story?Even when the High Priest asked how I was, if the oracle had been connected, these messages would have appeared.[The God of Art, Mond, evaluates the High Priest\u2019s face very favorably.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, shines his eyes, saying that he wants to \u25a0\u25a0 and \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.]However, the oracle window remained silent.For some reason, I felt my heart sink.I went to the window and looked out.\u201cDid everyone really\u2026 leave?\u201dI suddenly felt like I was alone.It\u2019s been a long time since I felt this.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s natural. Yes, it\u2019s obvious\u2026\u201dI muttered.Now that the real female lead has appeared, it is only natural that the Gods who have stayed so far have left. I felt the holy power still remaining in my body, but I don\u2019t know when this will disappear.It wasn\u2019t like when I voluntarily disabled the oracle.It seemed that my heart had become empty, like an empty nest that everyone had left.\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared out the window aimlessly. Still, the sad thought of saying goodbye and leaving came flooding back.What\u2019s the point of thinking about the Gods who left? I\u2019m trying to shake it off, yet that\u2019s not easy either.Then something popped out of my sleeve.\u201cKyuuuu.\u201dIt was Kyuu, who showed up with a pouty face.It was watching my expression with its black eyes.I smiled weakly and reached out my hand, stroking its head.\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019re here though.\u201dIt tilted its head and looked at me.It was as if it was stroking my empty heart with a small feather.I put it on my hand and stared out the window for a long time.\u201cShall we see Camilla again?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What brought you here at this hour!\u201dCamilla made a surprised expression.\u201cI\u2019m rude for barging in here suddenly, am I not? Were you getting ready to fall asleep by any chance? I was a little bored, and I was curious about what Camilla was going to do, so I came.\u201dI spoke to the maids and handed her a bag of cookies I had prepared.\u201cThis is a small gift.\u201d\u201cMy goodness. This smells delicious. Thank you.\u201dCamilla smiled as she accepted her cookie bag.A figure of Raid was visible on the desk behind her.\u201cAh. I was praying to God Reid.\u201dCamilla said as she opened her door a little more with an embarrassed look on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s shabby, but would you like to come in?\u201d\u201cThen excuse me.\u201dWhen I entered the room, she saw a bed, a table, and a desk.The closet was also very small, so it seemed like it wouldn\u2019t fit a few items. It was a simple and frugal room like a servant\u2019s room.\u201cIsn\u2019t it uncomfortable because the room is small?\u201dAt my words, she smiled and shook her head.\u201cNot at all. There is no difficulty in praising the Gods as long as there is a place to lie down. I\u2019m just grateful for what I have been given.\u201dSuch a respectful remark. Even when we were eating earlier, she looked like an ordinary girl.\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for the grace of Elium.\u201d\u201cMiss Camilla\u2026 seems to have a lot of faith.\u201dI said, sitting in the empty chair Camilla had given me.Then Camilla said, shaking her head.\u201cNo. To hear such praise from the Saintess, I\u2019m deeply moved.\u201d\u201cGod Raid will surely love Miss Camilla.\u201d\u201cWould he really?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dI replied with a light smile.Come to think of it, Raid, the God of Eternity, had never entered my oracle.Then is he staying with Camilla\u2019s oracle?\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Miss Camilla. There is something I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cYes. Saintess.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there something blue floating in front of your eyes?\u201dCamilla put on a puzzled expression at my question.\u201cSomething blue\u2026 What is that?\u201dIt was an expression as if she couldn\u2019t even guess at all, so I laughed,\u00a0haha, and turned the topic.\u201cNothing. I was wondering if I was the only one who could see an afterimage because of the blue moonlight over the window. Anyway, it seems that you will be very lonely and bored after leaving your hometown.\u201dAt my words, Camilla put on a slightly lonely expression.\u201cI\u2019m really lonely. There are a lot of people there who need my help, so a part of my heart is uncomfortable. However, I had a strong desire to serve the Gods more by studying at Elium.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, I\u2019m not lonely today because the Saintess visits me like this and be my companion.\u201dHer light smile was warm and beautiful.I looked at her for a moment as if I was possessed, then I opened my mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me when I left my hometown. We\u2019re the same age, so shall we get along?\u201dAt my words, Camilla blinked her eyes.\u201cAh, I\u2019m just a priestess, though\u2026 I won\u2019t fit to be a friend of the Saintess.\u201dCamilla\u2019s humble and polite manner of speaking drew her natural goodwill.Even in the original story, she was loved by many people.\u201cSuch. Are you refusing the Saintess\u2019 request?\u201dWhen I asked with a mischievous face, Camilla swayed her hand in bewilderment and replied hastily.\u201cI can\u2019t be! For me, if the Saintess considers me her friend, I will have no greater honor than that.\u201dAt her words, I smiled lightly.\u201cGreat. Then, would you like to have tea time in my room tomorrow evening?\u201d\u201cI have to pray to God Raid\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. The Gods didn\u2019t really care about that.\u201d\u201cPardon me?\u201dThe chatter in the middle of the night, which began after a while, went on endlessly.It wasn\u2019t until late at night that I bid Camilla goodbye and went back to my room.You won\u2019t be able to figure out a person in one day, but Camilla seems to be the female lead in the story I liked.***\u201cSaintess!\u201dThe next day a welcome guest came to see me. It was Noah, who ran to me as soon as he received a letter from the pigeon.\u201cLong time no see.\u201d\u201cYou have returned safely.\u201dNoah said joyfully.\u201cHave a cup of tea. Please listen to my story.\u201dI pointed to the table and smiled at Noah.Noah quickly sat across from the table.\u201cBy the way, where is Miss Daisy?\u201d\u201cAh. I sent her to her hometown, and she should arrive here in about three days.\u201dWhen Daisy returned, it was clear that she would make a fuss about it, saying she never thought I\u2019d come back so early.She would make a fuss, saying she had a hard time.\u201cIs it because Miss Daisy isn\u2019t here? The Saintess seems to be spiritless today.\u201dI nodded my head at Noah\u2019s words.\u201cIt feels a little empty. By the way, how has the capital been in the meantime?\u201d\u201cI heard that the Crown Prince cleaned up the palace and left, but His Imperial Majesty\u2019s condition was getting worse.\u201dWhile I visited Ares to block the gate, the Emperor\u2019s illness seemed to deepen. Although it wasn\u2019t known to the public.\u201cIsn\u2019t there any improvement in the prescriptions of the priests?\u201d\u201cI heard that the temple also dispatched competent healing priests. Since the fact that the Saintess has returned has been known, a formal request will come sooner or later.\u201d\u201cHmm. He must be in a lot of pain.\u201dRecalling the incident at the Imperial Palace, I sipped the tea with a heavy heart.\u201cWhat happened to the Empress\u2019 family?\u201d\u201cDue to treason, most of them were\u2026 exterminated.\u201d\u201cWas it His Imperial Majesty\u2019s order?\u201d\u201cBecause his mind and body haven\u2019t recovered yet\u2026 I heard that it was an order from His Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dIt seemed that Kyle had drawn his sword properly.There would no longer be any forces that could be called the imperialists.\u201cBut now, the atmosphere in the Imperial Palace is becoming much more stable. Perhaps, when the Crown Prince returns this time, he will be warmly welcomed by his supporters.\u201dAs if the family had never existed in the first place, everyone would try to join the Crown Prince, the next emperor.I nodded and listened to Noah\u2019s story.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dHowever, Noah suddenly spoke with a cautious look on his face.\u201cThere\u2019s a strange rumor going around.\u201dI listened, furrowing my brows a little.\u201cWhat rumor?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that His Highness the Crown Prince will welcome the Saintess as the Crown Princess. Is it true\u2026\u201dThe words surprised me and I spewed out the tea I was drinking.\u201cSaintess, are you okay?\u201d\u201cWho the hell said such nonsense!\u201d\u201cYou mean that it\u2019s groundless?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dNoah nodded and continued.\u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s a rumor that someone deliberately spread.\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cAs far as I know, the person who spread this rumor is Duke Shane Rockford, and everyone knows that he is the Crown Prince\u2019s henchman.\u201dIn other words, it might have been Kyle who spread the rumor that he would welcome me as the Crown Princess.\u2018But why?\u2019I tilted my head, unable to fathom his intentions.Then I remembered how Kyle had conspired with Reihausd to put me in the fake saintess position for political stabilityPerhaps it was a measure to calm the dizzy public sentiment because the Empress plotted treason.\u201cIt must be for political reasons.\u201dFor political stability, it\u2019s good to show the stability of the Imperial Family.Still, it\u2019s absurd to spread such rumors without saying anything.Anyway, by now, the monsters left in the territory had been wiped out and they should have departed from Ares.Suddenly, I was a little curious about Kyle\u2019s news.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although they signed a few poisonous treaties with Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.The day the Crown Prince\u2019s large army decided to leave. Both the lord and residents came out and waved flags to see them off.\u201cI\u2019m worried that His Imperial Majesty\u2019s health is getting worse day by day.\u201dShane, who rode beside Kyle, let out a small sigh.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven at his words, Kyle rode the horse silently with an expressionless face.\u201cIf the story that His Imperial Majesty the Emperor is ill spreads, the public will be devastated.\u201dShane continued his words, looking at Kyle anxiously.\u201cMoreover, with Her Imperial Majesty dethroned, I\u2019m not alone in worrying about the successor. Because Your Highness is still single. So, how about having a national marriage with the Saintess?\u201d\u201cIs that why such rumors are spreading all over the country?\u201dKyle replied, glancing lightly at Shane.Then Shane scratched his head as if he had been caught.\u201cIt\u2019s also true that you often visit the Saintess these days, and Your Highness\u2019 expression looks very comfortable when you\u2019re with the Saintess.\u201dShane went on in a light tone.\u201cShe won\u2019t like these rumors.\u201d\u201cBut it was the Saintess who flirted with Her Highness first. Did you forget that?\u201dShane let out a smirk.\u201cThe rumor that the Saintess favors Your Highness was once a big issue in the society.\u201dAt the time, he just dismissed it as an annoying rumor.There are always noble ladies who have unrequited love for the Crown Prince, and even if she is a saintess, it\u2019s not helpful since she\u2019s an incompetent saintess with neither power nor influence.However, the status of Saintess Ariel now was incomparable to that of her before.After being talked about by the citizens for saving a dying boy, she raised her name by overthrowing the wicked Empress\u2019 rebellion with the Crown Prince.Besides, hadn\u2019t she recently blocked even the huge gate of the Demon Realm?She was the most famous and beloved person in the Empire.\u201cDidn\u2019t His Highness calculate that last time, too?\u201dShane said, as they came out of the cave, he remembered how Kyle had honored Ariel\u2019s name among the soldiers.However, Kyle answered with her cool eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s enough to cut off the enemies\u2019 heads, calculation is a headache.\u201dWhen he saw Ariel again from the collapsed mine.And when he saw the undead monster behind her, baring their fangs.For the first time he felt like something was breaking off. His sword pierced the air and cut the monster\u2019s stomach, yet the cold sensation lingered in his mind for a long time.Ariel almost died.If she died\u2026A cold glint passed through his red eyes.\u201cWe won\u2019t be in a hurry. There is no need to rush.\u201dHe heard Shane\u2019s calm voice from the side.\u201cThe political situation is unstable due to a series of incidents. If you use her connection and marriage with the Saintess, it will surely be of great help in stabilizing the situation and strengthening Your Highness\u2019s position.\u201dKyle didn\u2019t answer. His red eyes were directed toward the far ahead landscape.\u201cIs my position at stake enough to the point it needs to be strengthened by a marriage?\u201dIt was the first time he had ever seen Kyle like this.\u201cThat\u2019s not true, but\u2026\u201dIn the meantime, the only thing Kyle was interested in was swordsmanship, and the only path he had to walk, such as royal studies or politics.Until now, Kyle was the perfect emperor\u2019s heir. He wasn\u2019t cowardly, but he put people and situations in the right places and made good use of them.He had never given anyone personal affection, and he didn\u2019t care about women, saying that they were a nuisance.But now Kyle is like\u2026\u201cDo you want to win the Saintess\u2019 true heart?\u201dA fishy smile crossed Kyle\u2019s lips at Shane\u2019s words.\u201cDo you love\u2026 her?\u201dAfter a while, he opened his heavy lips.\u201c\u2026Love.\u201dAs it exists in a dictionary, it was a word far from him.Yet at this moment, somehow it felt familiar, as if it really existed.\u201cNo. Don\u2019t answer me.\u201dAt one point, Shane dropped his question.He shook his head when Kyle shook his head.\u201cI would be afraid if Your Highness said you loved someone.\u201dAt that, Kyle furrowed his eyebrows, wondering if it meant something.\u201cOriginally, I was afraid of knowing it late\u2026 If I heard that Your Highness loves someone\u2026 Uh\u2026\u201dShane shook his shoulders in fear.Kyle said, a smirk appeared on his lips.\u201cYou talk a lot of nonsense today. It seems that your mind is free.\u201dHe gripped the horse\u2019s reins and continued.\u201cI\u2019ll throw you a job as soon as we get back to the palace, know that.\u201dAt that, Shane clasped his head.\u201c\u2026Pardon me?\u201dWithout hesitation, Kyle urged his words.Shane\u2019s whining voice echoed behind him.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you give me time to heal after the trip!\u201d***As I wandered around the temple buildings, I encountered several priests. They were happy to see me, whom they hadn\u2019t seen in a while, and bowed down to greet me.The place I was going now was the hall of the statues enshrining the icons of the Nine Gods in the main building.It was a place I had never been to before, but when the oracle disappeared, I couldn\u2019t stay still because I thought of the Gods.Does this mean I have to be good when they\u2019re around?I was moving my steps with a nervous heart, but I heard a loud voice everywhere.\u201cCan\u2019t you do it right?!\u201dI frowned and walked towards the sound.\u201cYou son of a bitch. Because of you, the statue was damaged. I told you to fix it, who told you to scratch it! Huh?!\u201dA man standing in front of the statue of Mond was cursing at a low-ranking priest with his arms crossed at an angle.The man was bald, but his head glistened in the light from the glass ceiling above.\u201cI-I apologize. It\u2019s my first time.\u201d\u201cAnyway, these days, you can\u2019t work properly and just eat\u2026\u201dThe lower priest sweated profusely and apologized, yet the bald man didn\u2019t care and kept screaming.\u201cTsk, tsk. The same goes for that bright yellow haired guy. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s acting like that just because he\u2019s in a high position. I bet it won\u2019t last long.\u201dLooking at it now, I remembered a voice I had heard yesterday.[I haven\u2019t heard anything. High Priest, and the Saintess.]Someone who had a conversation with Reihausd after hiding and listening to the conversation between me and Reihausd\u2026 It was Chief Priest Heinz.\u201cThat\u2019s why, you have to do it right. Huh? Understand?\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you go up and try it yourself?\u201dI opened my mouth in a relaxed tone behind him.Heinz glanced back angrily.\u201cTowards the Chief Priest\u2019s words, who dares to\u2026 S-Saintess!\u201dHeinz\u2019s eyes widened as if they would fall out.The low-ranking priest who was repairing the statue also hurriedly came down in surprise and bowed his head respectfully in front of me.\u201cThe blessing of the Nine Goods towards the Saintess.\u201dI ordered Heinz with cold eyes.\u201cIf it seems that easy, do it yourself.\u201dAt my words, his face went pale and he shook his head.\u201cI was just afraid that time would be delayed and there would be a strain on the temple\u2019s dignity\u2026 It was only a little bit of faith. If there is any misunderstanding\u2026\u201d\u201cI think you said it was a misunderstanding yesterday.\u201dHeinz\u2019s shoulders trembled. It seemed that Reihausd had been threatening him quite a bit.\u201cFor now, priest, please leave. Your whole body is wet with sweat, so what if there is an accident?\u201dI turned my eyes to the lower priest again and spoke softly.He seemed to be looking at Heinz and me consecutively.\u201cIt\u2019s the order of the Saintess.\u201dAnd when I added another gentle word, he bowed his head deeply and left.I turned my gaze back to Heinz.\u201cA person who claims to serve the Gods hides and eavesdrops on the others\u2019 conversation, and not only is it enough to verbally abuse the young priest, you swear at the High Priest behind his back\u2026\u201dAt my words, he jumped up.\u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable for me to swear at the High Priest behind his back.\u201dPerhaps that is the point that scares him the most.\u201cIs that so?\u201dI smiled and continued.\u201cThen I will give you a choice. Either you go up here now, or I tell him that Sir Heinz just went around cursing at the High Priest.\u201dI pointed him to the ladder the lower priest had climbed.\u201cS-Saintess. I\u2019m old and weak\u2026\u201d\u201cYou say you\u2019re an expert of the temple\u2019s dignity. I expect the Chief Priest to show sincere devotion.\u201dAt my words, his expression grew darker.Eventually, he shivered and climbed the ladder.I looked up at him from below and said brightly.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll come back in a little while. Just to see if you\u2019re doing well.\u201dHeinz\u2019s face was teary-eyed, yet without any care, I turned around and went out calmly.Of course, I had no intention of coming back.I tried to do something called \u2018prayer\u2019 quietly, but the atmosphere wasn\u2019t good. Instead, I thought of getting a small statue like the one Camilla had.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just after passing the small vine wall.\u201cRotunia is really beautiful. It feels like standing in a field of white feathers.\u201dA raised voice came from somewhere.\u201cI heard that the High Priest personally airlifted it. I never thought I would see this in person. It really feels like a dream.\u201d\u201cAre you interested in flowers?\u201d\u201cYes, I have studied herbs and flowers since I was young.\u201dWalking through the garden, I saw two familiar people and stopped. It was Camilla and Reihausd.They were talking while looking at Rotunia flowers. A beautiful couple of man and woman, it was as if I was looking at a painting.For some reason, feeling like I had disturbed the two of them, I inadvertently took a few steps back.\u201c\u2026\u201dIsn\u2019t that the atmosphere that I shouldn\u2019t be involved in?I looked at Reihausd\u2019s face as I stepped back. For some reason, his golden eyes looked comfortable.There was always a dark light mixed in when he talked to me, yet he looked really comfortable talking to Camilla.Still, I wasn\u2019t jealous or anything.From the beginning, my goal was self-reliance outside the temple, and I had no interest in being \u2018real\u2019. Although now it\u2019s difficult because of the contract with Diego.\u201c\u2026\u201dI walked calmly through the garden path.Will it be a little less boring when Daisy comes around tomorrow afternoon?It was time for me to go back on the road, avoiding Reihausd and Camilla.\u201cAre you going back?\u201dReihausd\u2019s voice suddenly was heard behind my back.Startled, I looked back, and Reihausd was standing just a few meters away, like he had followed me. Then, long after Reihausd, I saw Camilla standing in the distance.A slightly embarrassed expression appeared on Camilla\u2019s face, as if he had suddenly followed me without saying a word.\u201c\u2026\u201dA moment later, after receiving a polite greeting from her standing in the distance, I turned my gaze to Reihausd.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be a hindrance to the two of you\u2026\u201dI bewilderedly made an excuse.\u201cWhat do you mean hindrance?\u201dHowever, he denied my words and continued.\u201cI have been waiting for the Saintess to come find me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI thought for a moment as I didn\u2019t know what to answer.But behind Reihausd, Camilla greeted me with a light smile, and she turned around.I put on a puzzled expression, not knowing what to do, as I watched her lonely back when she went back alone.\u201cSir Reihausd. Camilla is leaving, though.\u201dThen Reihausd suddenly replied.\u201cAre you going to leave me and follow her?\u201dStartled by the sudden words, I looked at him.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dWe had been having a friendly conversation until just now.Suddenly, there was a strange gloom in Reihausd\u2019s gold eyes.\u201cPlease don\u2019t call it my delusion.\u201dA low voice pierced my ears.\u201cAfter Camilla came to the temple, I feel that the Saintess has been avoiding me.\u201dCertainly these days, I have been avoiding Reihausd. Yesterday, I had declined his offer to have a meal together, and tea time.Instead, I had planned to have tea with Camilla tonight.\u201cI was convinced once more just now. Seeing the Saintess who found us and turned around at once.\u201dAt his words, I tried to think of an excuse, yet he continued firmly.Reihausd\u2019s eyes seemed to have a thick spark.\u201cSir Reihausd\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you\u2026\u201dHis lips were swollen.\u201cDo you like Camilla?\u201dI was almost taken aback by his question.\u201cPardon\u2026? Pardon me?\u201dAnd it was only when I saw his serious eyes that I realized what kind of illusion Reihausd was under.It didn\u2019t matter to him whether Camilla was a man or a woman. It just matters whether I care for her or not.\u201c\u2026Not every night. It hasn\u2019t even been a few days since I came back.\u201dI bewilderedly spoke hastily.\u201cHowever, you refused my request for a meal every day. Why are you only after her?\u201dI was looking at him with a blank expression.I didn\u2019t mean to do that, but it seemed that way because I\u2019ve been seeing Camilla often these days.\u201cWell, then, the day after tomorrow, we will have dinner together. I have no other appointments that day.\u201dAt my words, Reihausd paused for a moment, then he blushed a little and opened his mouth.\u201cAre you talking about us alone?\u201d\u201cNo. The three of us, with Camilla.\u201dThen his complexion darkened again.\u201cAnyway, I should consider transferring Camilla to the Raid Temple.\u201d\u201cSir Reihausd!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201dA gentle wind blew.His neck was pale, without wearing a choker, yet I could imagine him wearing the choker.I said with a small sigh.\u201cAlright. Just the two of us.\u201dAt my words, Reihausd smiled with his beautiful golden eyes shining.***\u201cCamilla?\u201dI was about to go back to my residence when I suddenly saw Camilla\u2019s back.She was talking to someone.\u201cThat person\u2026\u201dIt was Heinz, a bald-headed man who could be recognized even from a distance.When I saw the expression on his face as he spoke with a slightly serious expression, I suddenly felt worried.That bastard, isn\u2019t he bullying Camilla?I strode over and stood behind them. And,\u00a0ehm,\u00a0I cleared his throat.Surprised by my presence, Camilla glanced behind her back, and Heinz turned to face me as well.His face quickly turned into an expression as if he had chewed shit..\u201cT-The blessing of the Nine Gods towards the Saintess.\u201d\u201cTowards the Chief Priest. And Miss Camilla too.\u201dCamilla looked at me and her face lit up, smiling.\u201cSaintess!\u201d\u201cHas Chief Priest Heinz asked Camilla for something?\u201dAt my question, Camilla looked into his eyes for a moment and hesitated.Looking at the atmosphere, 100 percent.At that time, Heinz, whose foot was stabbed, spoke first.\u201cI was just passing by and greeted her.\u201d\u201cThe Chief Priest asked what conversation you had with the High Priest.\u201dYet Camilla looked at me and told me the truth, then Heinz\u2019 face was stained with embarrassment.I can understand that it\u2019s a character who has a grudge against Reihausd or is aiming for his position.I guess it\u2019s the wish of the second place that wants the first place to disappear.\u201cDid you finish repairing the statue earlier?\u201dI asked him with a cool smile. Then Heinz stepped back with a pathetic look.\u201cYes. It\u2019s almost been repaired.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, then.\u201dI clapped my hands.\u201cBecause the appearance of the annex also needs to be inspected.\u201d\u201cYes? Pardon meee? T-That\u2019s for the lower priests\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re free enough to dig around the High Priest\u2019s back, so go, now.\u201dAt my words, Heinz was taken aback and his complexion darkened.\u201cI-I suddenly remembered something urgent, I\u2019ll get going!\u201dAnd soon after, he turned around and started walking quickly.\u201cOh my, Chief Priest Heinz! Where are you going!\u201dI called him from behind, and his steps quickened.Camilla was laughing beside me.\u201cSaintess, pfft\u2026 You\u2019re so amazing.\u201dHer laugh made me smile too.\u201cNow, when he goes behind someone\u2019s back to gossip, he\u2019ll at least take a good look at his surroundings. And he won\u2019t bother Miss Camilla.\u201d\u201cHe was also notorious in Ares, but he seems to have met the right person.\u201dCamilla said so, laughing even more as if it were funny,\u201cAh, come to think of it, Miss Camilla must have met Chief Priest Heinz at Ares, too, right?\u201dI clapped my hands at the fact I had just realized and asked.It wasn\u2019t long before Heinz had been dispatched to Ares. The period of his return is almost the same as that of Camilla.\u201cYes. Everyone ran away. I did too.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dJudging by Heinz\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s inevitable that everyone tried to avoid him.\u201cI thought all priests from Elium would be like Priest Heinz.\u201d\u201cAh, then it must have been a culture shock for you to see Sir Reihausd.\u201dAt my words, Camilla nodded her head, smiled, and joked.\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I came to Elium.\u201dAfter a while of her laughter, Camilla asked me.\u201cBy the way, has your conversation with the High Priest finished?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems like an urgent conversation.\u201dI can\u2019t say it was a very fruitless conversation, so I nodded.\u201cWell, yes.\u201dA moment of awkward silence passed.Camilla, who looked a little lonely, thought of something and then opened her mouth.\u201cHmm\u2026 Would you like to make cookies with me for dinner?\u201dI had originally scheduled my appointment to have tea time with her as well.Sweets, it seemed like a good idea, so I nodded.\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I bought six statues of Gods at a shop downtown.Today, too, I decided to spend a late afternoon with Camilla.Yesterday we made something similar to Japanese sweets, but today I was going to learn embroidery from Camilla. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do it well though.In the evening, I thought of praying to a statue like Camilla.I crossed the fountain side with Dwayne towards the meeting place with Camilla.However then, from somewhere, the voices of priestesses whispered.\u201cOh, my God\u2026\u201d\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d\u201cCertainly, until yesterday\u2026\u201dThey seem to be surrounding something.\u201cSaintess. Are you here?\u201dWhen they noticed my gaze, they hurriedly bowed their heads to me.I approached them curiously and asked.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThey took a few steps back, revealing a golden cage between them.And I saw a pair of birds lying sadly on the floor.Beautiful birds with golden feathers.It was a Golden Crown.I furrowed my eyebrows.Golden Crowns were auspicious beings associated with Hetuse, the God of Justice, and usually lived up to one hundred years.There is also a popular belief that the death of a Golden Crown means the wrath of the Gods because it doesn\u2019t get sick easily.But is this Golden Crown bird dead?\u201cWhat is this? Is the Golden Crown bird dead?\u201dDwayne\u2019s panicked voice could be heard from behind.\u201cLast night it was still alive, yet this morning it was found dead.\u201dA priestess bowed her head with a pale expression.\u201cDid you report this to the High Priest?\u201dI asked in a tone, as calm as I could.\u201cWe just discovered it too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a good sign.\u201d\u201cThat bird.\u201dA priestess raised her head at my words and looked at my expression.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a living creature, so it can die.\u201dI said as I looked at the pair of Golden Crowns that had slumped and died.It wasn\u2019t good to assign meaning to each death. It could have just died naturally.\u201c\u2026If the Saintess says so, then it must be so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They might have died because the environment wasn\u2019t good\u2026\u201dAt my words, the priestesses\u2019 agitation gradually disappeared.\u201cAnyway, report it to the High Priest.\u201d\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dI put my hand on the golden cage.If they hadn\u2019t died, they could have been saved somehow, but it was a pity.And it was then.\u201cMy goodness\u2026\u201dI heard a familiar voice and turned around. Camilla was standing there.The priestesses turned around and glanced at Camilla.\u201cThe Golden Crown birds are dead\u2026\u201dCamilla walked towards the cage as if she was possessed. Her blue eyes were quivering.\u201cSaintess.\u201dCamilla, who found me late, was polite. Soon her gaze turned to the cage.I pulled my hand from the cage.She stood in front of the cage and pursed her lips.\u201cHow weird\u2026\u201dHer voice flowed clearly into my ears.It was a warm voice, yet somehow I could feel the muscles in my back tightening.Then Camilla reached for the cage.\u201cIt\u2019s dead birds. There may be a bad disease\u2026\u201dOne of the priestesses opened her mouth, yet Camilla didn\u2019t care and brought out the two birds in turn.The sight of the two limp bodies of the birds resting on Camilla\u2019s white palms gave it a strange feeling.I stood still and watched Camilla\u2019s actions.She put the birds on her hand and closed her eyes. Then she licked her lips and whispered something.Different from normal prayer\u2026 I heard a voice I couldn\u2019t understand. It was a sound that only she and those closest to her could hear.At one point, I felt my shoulders stiff enough to become stiff.What is this feeling of deja vu?\u201cOh, my God\u2026\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201dIt was the cries of the priestesses that awoke me from the strange sensation that came on suddenly.I woke up and saw the birds on Camilla\u2019s hand.They were flapping their wings.I looked at Camilla with a surprised expression.Her gaze was on the birds with a more relaxed expression than before.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe birds were sitting on Camilla\u2019s hands with bright eyes.Camilla smiled with her twinkling eyes as she watched the birds and then moved her gaze to me.\u2018The ability to revive the dead\u2026 Did Camilla have that in the original story?\u2019I narrowed my eyes.Camilla was a saintess with great holy power, but she didn\u2019t have the ability to revive the dead.Even the Gods can\u2019t do that.But how\u2026\u201cHow did this happen?\u201dExclamations of surprise rang out from everywhere.\u201cGoodness\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s holy power. It must be holy power!\u201d\u201cBut there is the Saintess and yet another holy power\u2026!\u201dI looked at her with her confused eyes.Had the prophecy changed completely?Since they only gave me, a fake saintess, divine power, the real saintess, Camilla, might have received even greater power.\u2018But to say that\u2019s the case, that energy just now\u2026\u2019\u201cCamilla. Is it true that you just saved the birds?\u201dI asked her in her calm voice.\u201cI\u2026 \u201cCamilla\u2019s eyes widened as she looked at me.\u201c\u2026Do you have holy power?\u201dI asked her again.Even holy power can\u2019t bring a dead bird back to life.\u201cTell me how you did it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, Saintess\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Camilla\u2019s eyelids closed and she collapsed helplessly.As soon as she did, the birds in her hands flapped their wings and flew away.The priestesses ran around her and supported Camilla\u2019s body. In the garden of the temple, the wind was blowing.***\u201cAre you awake?\u201dWhen the lying Camilla opened her eyes, I held out a glass of water.Camilla looked at me a little startled and she pulled herself up from the bed.\u201cI moved you to my room first.\u201dDwayne was waiting outside the door.Camilla took the glass I gave her and looked into it for a long time before she held it out to me again.\u201cMy throat\u2026 It\u2019s not dry.\u201dWhat is it?There was a subtle feeling in the eyes looking at me, so it bothered me for a while.However, thinking of Camilla, who had been enjoying herself, I thought it was an illusion and received the glass again,After a while, Camilla opened her mouth.\u201cDid I collapse after saving the two Golden Crowns?\u201dI looked her in the eyes without saying a word and nodded my head.I saw Camilla\u2019s green eyes flicker.\u201cDid you originally use this ability?\u201dAfter a while I asked her, and she hesitated before opening her mouth.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since it appeared. At first, I helped neighbors who were injured in the mines, and then I worked at the temple.\u201dIt was the original story I knew.\u201cI know it will surprise everyone, but they were so pitiful, so\u2026\u201dCamilla let out a little sigh, tucking her own slightly disheveled hair behind her ear.\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201dHer little lips twitched.I looked at Camilla for a moment before opening my mouth.\u201cNo. You saved a life, how can it be a mistake.\u201dCamilla\u2019s eyes widened at my words.\u201cGood job. Camilla.\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201dShe held my hand and bowed her head.\u201cI\u2026 Actually, I have something to confess.\u201dI answered, holding her hand with my other hand.\u201cTell me anything. I will listen.\u201d\u201cWhat the Saintess said the other day\u2026 Do you remember? Something blue flickers before my eyes.\u201dAs I listened to her, I felt my heart thump and sink.\u2018Perhaps\u2026?\u2019Camilla confessed to me with tears in her green eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s an oracle, isn\u2019t that? I think an oracle has been coming down to me ever since. Since I was in Ares\u2026\u201dI calmly patted her on the shoulder, trying not to panic.Camilla was the real female lead, of course it\u2019s something she deserved.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Camilla.\u201d\u201cBut the Saintess is here\u2026\u201dThe original Camilla was lovable and delicate, but she was a strong-willed woman befitting a saint. And the Camilla in front of me was no different.That\u2019s why I was able to speak calmly.\u201cLet\u2019s gather the high-ranking priests and check whether you have holy power or not. There is a procedure, so it will probably take a few days.\u201dThe appearance of a saintess with great holy power to save the dead, and two of them in one era is impossible.Therefore, if the manifestation of holy power is proven, the procedure to confirm whether or not the holy power exists will be opened.Camilla\u2019s eyes widened at my words.\u201c\u2026You seem to have consumed a lot of energy, take a good rest today.\u201dI wrapped my arms around her shoulders with a slightly stiff face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And I walked towards my room.My heart was pounding.\u2018Now, let\u2019s sort it out.\u2019Although it was a sudden situation, Camilla\u2019s holy power was revealed today.Many priestesses witnessed this, and now Camilla\u2019s presence in the temple will grow out of control.To think that she is a priestess with holy power great enough to save the dead. Everyone may doubt my authenticity.\u2018Then what will happen to the contract?\u2019I bit my lip in nervousness.Elium, the highest temple of all temples, the saintess only dwells there. And Camilla saved a life that was already dead today.\u201c\u2026\u201dBoth my mind and heart were complicated.\u201cSaintess!\u201dAs I walked out to the hallway, I heard Daisy\u2019s voice.I stood still.\u201cHere you are. I came back, but you were out\u2026 I thought you went for a walk.\u201dThe speed of my pounding heart gradually slowed as I smiled.\u201cHow have you been? While you were in the mine, I prayed every day because I\u2019m worried about the Saintess\u2026\u201d\u201cDaisy.\u201d\u201cYes, Saintess.\u201dI looked at Daisy while holding her hand, said.\u201cI missed you.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes widened at my words. And she smiled broadly like a flower blooming.\u201cMe too, Saintess. I missed you so much.\u201dFake saintess Ariel.As in my previous life, I thought there was nothing really mine.The temple is always a place from where I have to leave, and so are the ties.Yet deep down I realized that wasn\u2019t the case. Maybe I have grown attached to a lot of things here.Maybe even if I hadn\u2019t signed a contract with Diego, I might have been greedy for this place.I guess I was thinking that this is where I really need to be.\u201cSaintess, I\u2019m very happy too, but it\u2019s suffocating. Please let go of me.\u201d\u201cJust a minute more.\u201dAt my words, Daisy patted me on the back.\u201cDid anything sad happen, our Saintess?\u201dHer arms were warm.***Daisy went out, comforting me with pleasant stories from her hometown.A lonely night alone. I went out with Dwayne and looked at the six statues I bought.The small statues on the desk were funny because they looked like Moai for some reason.The God of Art, Mond.The God of Knowledge, Hessed.The God of Destruction, Ciel.The God of Justice, Hetuse.The God of Benevolence, Oman.The God of Love, Odyssey.I got out of bed and sat down in a chair, stretching out my hand and stroking each of the statues.\u201cIt\u2019s not like this, is it?\u201dThere were no Gods who answered, but I smiled at the thought of the cute shape of the statues.After a while, I put my hands together and closed my eyes to pray.\u201cHow are you? Gods. I was surprised that you left without saying anything. Wherever you go, always be happy. Phew\u2026\u201dI let out a small sigh and opened my eyes.\u201c\u2026Actually, I miss you.\u201dIt\u2019s true that there were times when the oracle interfered with my life and nagged me, which was annoying.But once it disappeared, the emptiness lingered for a very long time.I looked at the icon without an answer, then sighed again and stood up.And then it was.[Or\u2026 acle\u2026][Ora\u2026 cle is\u2026 not smooth\u2026\u25a0\u25a0]A\u00a0 chat window suddenly popped up in front of me.I stared at the chat window in surprise. However, it became transparent and disappeared within seconds.\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201dDidn\u2019t the oracle disappear altogether?It doesn\u2019t make sense to assume that the oracle was disturbed, this was the temple. It\u2019s not like there are demons that emit powerful Magi like Diego Vester did.I prayed again and sat down, yet the oracle window didn\u2019t appear again.***The next evening, after spending a lot of time with a troubled heart, I rode a carriage and left the temple with Reihausd.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect us to have a meal outside the temple.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long-awaited time with the Saintess, that\u2019s why I prepared it so you won\u2019t feel sad.\u201dThe carriage left the temple and arrived downtown shortly after.The place we decided to go today was a nice restaurant on the street not far from the temple.I got out of the carriage, escorted by him.\u201cThis seems to be a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have many customers.\u201d\u201cI borrowed this for a period of time for Saintess.\u201dI was surprised by Reihausd\u2019s words and looked at him.Isn\u2019t this the line usually spoken by rich guys in dramas?\u2018Well, being a priest doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s poor.\u2019Reihausd looks no less stylish and rich than he is.\u201cI heard what happened yesterday.\u201dHe said while pouring wine into my glass. A thick steak was placed on the platter.\u201cAh, you mean Camilla saving the Golden Crown?\u201dI cut the meat carelessly.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dAt Reihausd\u2019s direct words, I stopped the knife I was cutting the meat with. My eyes gazed upon him and I said.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t be okay, is there? Camilla saved a poor life.\u201dHe looked at me with his lips closed for a moment, as if my words conveyed an uncomfortable feeling.\u201c\u2026For me.\u201dAfter a while, he opened his mouth.\u201cWhat would you do if you were the only saintess to me, Ariel?\u201dI responded with a light smile.\u201cI know that Sir Reihausd cares for me excessively. I\u2019m always grateful for that.\u201dI could see his golden eyes swaying low.The more I look at him, the more beautiful he is. And the peculiar constitution in which his body reacts (?) to a person with holy power.\u201cBut Sir Reihausd\u2019s excessive kindness sometimes puts a burden on me. I\u2019m afraid you will get hurt someday.\u201dNow was the time to draw a line, both for me and him.After I went to Ares, he was checking on my safety like a puppy suffering from separation anxiety.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re burdened. As expected.\u201dHis golden eyes darkened.After a while, his lips were chapped.\u201cStill, it doesn\u2019t change that you are a saintess forever.\u201dA repeated question that comes back again.I was naturally accepting Reihausd, who had become my fan from a certain moment.Yes, it\u2019s all because of holy power. It\u2019s all because of my holy power.\u2018If this holy power disappears someday, it might suddenly go to the new holy power holder, Camilla.\u2019Thinking that time would solve the problem, I decided to focus on eating.But then, Reihausd\u2019s voice was heard again.\u201cWe\u2019re sending Camilla to the temple of Raid.\u201d\u201cPardon me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201dStartled by his low voice, I looked back at him. His dark gold eyes shone darkly.His red lips were swollen.\u201cDoes the Saintess believe in Camilla with all your heart?\u201dI was silent for a moment at his words, then I asked him again.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dSoon Reihausd stared at me and opened his mouth again.\u201cBehind what is too righteous lies a deep valley of distortion.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying.\u201cThat is also the difference between the Saintess and me.\u201dSo, is it like, the more straight something is, the more you shouldn\u2019t believe it by just looking at its outside?\u201c\u2026Sir Reihausd. I think it\u2019s exaggerated to think of Camilla as being too nice.\u201d\u201cShe has a valley as deep as mine.\u201dReihausd\u2019s thick voice cut me off.\u201cShe will harm Ariel.\u201dI looked into his eyes for a while. My heart skipped a beat at the words I couldn\u2019t understand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A new saintess has appeared\u2026\u201d\u201cA new saintess? Hey, where is there such a thing? There is only one, Saintess Ariel\u2026 \u201c\u201cNo. They say she has stronger holy power than Saintess Ariel. I heard that even dead animals can be brought back to life.\u201d\u201cNo way. Even Bergheritta, the First Saintess, couldn\u2019t do that.\u201dI was walking down the street with Kyuu in the clothes I borrowed from Daisy.It\u2019s been more than 15 days since I arrived at the temple.Yesterday, I had a meal with Reihausd, and three days later, the sacred power confirmation procedure was arranged.There were rumors that heated up the temple outside.Camilla was quickly dubbed the \u2018new saintess\u2019. It seems that the aftermath of saving two dead Golden Crowns was really great.\u201cBut the Saintess blocked the gate in Ares. There was almost a war with the Demon Realm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Saintess is a hero who saved the country.\u201d\u201cStill, wouldn\u2019t even the Saintess be able to save a dead life?\u201dI felt lonely for no reason at the stories of people comparing Camilla\u2019s holy power and mine.\u201cDo you really believe in Camilla?\u201dI remembered the subject I had with Reihausd yesterday.Camilla came to Elium after being invited by none other than Reihausd.Yet why is he trying to push her away so far?\u2018Shouldn\u2019t he rather like her, given his constitution that responds to holy power?\u2019While I was walking, thinking about this and that, I heard the cry of a child in the alley.\u201cHarry, open your eyes. Harry!\u201dI naturally turned my gaze toward the commotion.A boy was seen squatting and crying on a limp white puppy.\u201cHarry!\u00a0Hicc\u2026 No. You can\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cRon, I think it\u2019s already too late\u2026\u201dNext to the boy was a girl, who seemed to be his older sister, with a sad expression.I approached the children and asked.\u201cIs your dog sick?\u201dThe older sister, who was standing next to the crying boy holding the puppy, answered me.\u201cHarry is Ron\u2019s dog, and I think it\u2019s been poisoned with rat poison.\u201dI turned my attention to the puppy.The puppy in the arms of the boy looked like it would stop breathing at any moment, but luckily it wasn\u2019t completely out of breath yet.\u201cCan I take a look at the puppy for a second?\u201d\u201cHicc\u2026\u201d\u201cI think I can help.\u201dAt my words, the boy handed over the puppy, his eyes brimming with tears.The white-haired puppy was very small and light, like it was still a baby.It was dripping with frothy saliva, as if he had taken rat poison, and its eyes were barely focused.It was the first treatment I had ever tried after returning to the temple.I started focusing on my hands. Then, a familiar energy began to flow through my hands.It was definitely the energy of life. I felt the divine power vividly.\u201cAre you\u2026 a priestess?\u201dI heard the girl\u2019s startled voice.In the eyes of the children, I looked like a priestess who came out of the temple.I didn\u2019t answer, focused my attention on my hands and let it flow to the puppy. I could feel the dying puppy sucking the sacred power.As long as I hold my breath, all living things are willing to accept my healing power.I put more strength into my hands.A warm feeling passed through my hands, and my heart ached quite a bit.The pain felt when I treated life was inevitable. I was a little out of breath, but I decided to accept the hassle for this little creature and the boy, who loves it.\u201cOh my Gods\u2026 Harry!\u201dAfter about ten minutes, I handed the puppy back to the boy\u2019s arms.In no time, warmth returned to its body.The tearful boy received the puppy back, who was sticking out its tongue and panted, in disbelief. He then looked up at me.\u201cYou saved Harry\u2026 Harry\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you, priestess.\u201dThe girl greeted me with a deep bow.I reached out to the puppy, stroking its head once.\u201cBe careful not to let it eat rat poison next time.\u201dThe boy who was looking at me blankly nodded his head vigorously.\u201cThank you. Thank you, priestess.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, priestess.\u201d\u201cI will be careful. Thank you so much for saving Harry\u2019s life.\u201dThe puppy was wiping away the boy\u2019s tears with its tongue out.I smiled and turned around.The joyous voices of a boy and a girl came from behind. It felt like I had done something I was proud of for the first time in a while.A question came to me out of the blue.The chilling, oddly creepy feeling I felt when Camilla brought the two Golden Crowns to life.Is it really the same kind of holy power as the one I have now?\u201cDo you believe in Camilla?\u201dAt that moment, I furrowed my eyebrows at the thought, which was just in case.That feeling, I must have encountered it somewhere\u2026It was when I turned the corner once. A man was walking casually next to me. I didn\u2019t even have to look back, I could tell it was Cass just by his voice.\u201cDid you go undercover to do good deeds?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cI just came out to do some market research.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you might want to contact me.\u201dCass, wearing a shirt and plain vest, said with a cool smile.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? To be careful.\u201dHe said as I stopped and looked up at him.\u201cBring it.\u201dAnd from the side alley, two men who seemed to be Cass\u2019 subordinates dragged a man.I looked at Cass and turned my attention to the man they caught.\u201cThis person\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve seen him. Even in the temple.\u201cLooking at the clothes he was wearing inside, he was a priest. I mean this guy, who has been stalking you all along.\u201dI had seen this man with a torn scar on his cheek.\u201cI-I was just going out. It was only because the Saintess was there that the lines of our movement overlapped, is it okay to treat a priest of Elium like this!\u201dThe priest protested to Cass, yet he smiled and went over to the man, searching in his backpack and inside pockets. And what came out was a small dagger and a string enough to bind a person.\u201cYour belongings are much more honest than your words.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou need to tell me everything.\u201dBehind Cass, two of his men were warming up.At Cass\u2019 relaxed words, the priest glared at him and his body began to tremble.\u201cThe great one. May your will come true!\u201dSoon, the whites of the priest\u2019s eyes were visible, and foam began to fill his mouth.I hurriedly approached him and tried to use my healing power, yet his heart had already stopped.I was looking at the dead priest in astonishment.\u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019I heard Cass\u2019s voice in my ears as I clutched at my pounding heart.\u201cLet\u2019s talk for a minute.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Cass hadn\u2019t found him here, he might have targeted me inside the temple.\u201cShall we send the body to the temple?\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that.\u201dI interrupted Cass.I thought that maybe something sinister was going on.\u201cCan you keep his belongings and body?\u201dCass stared at me for a few seconds, then he replied.\u201cAlright. Lloyd\u2019s will take care of it.\u00a0 And we will also investigate his identity.\u201dAt Cass\u2019 signal, his men dragged the dead man into a dark alley.\u201cThank you, Marquis.\u201dHe held out a glass of water to me, and I drank to calm my alarmed heart.\u201cI tried to live without being an enemy to others, but it seems difficult.\u201dCass smiled at my words and said, like a joke.\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing in the world.\u201dCass, who had been watching me until I calmed down, spoke up after a while.\u201cYou still have holy power.\u201dI put on a slightly bitter expression.Rumors spread like this, there was no way it wouldn\u2019t get into his ears.\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t sound good to hear.\u201dAfter a moment of silence after my words, he opened his mouth.\u201cMy mother was also a saintess.\u201d\u201cYour mother\u2026 was a saintess?\u201dI was surprised by the first words I heard.He replied with a calm expression.\u201cShe was a former saintess who passed away seven years ago.\u201dIt was something that didn\u2019t appear in the original story.In the original story, it was only portrayed that his mother gave birth to him after separating from his father, and Cass was raised to be educated by his father, the owner of Lloyd\u2019s.\u201cWhen Mother was a priestess, she met my father, the owner of Lloyd\u2019s, and gave birth to me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dBut there was something I didn\u2019t understand. In the temple history book, the former saintess\u2019 husband was the Duke of Rockford. Not the owner of Lloyd\u2019s.He continued talking as if he noticed my doubts.\u201cShe was a single mother. It wasn\u2019t known to the public that she gave birth to me secretly, and Mother, who sent me to Father, married the Duke of Rockford.\u201dI could see that his birth and growth must have been turbulent.So, that means Kyle is a half-brother to Shane Rockford, whom Noah mentioned earlier.He spoke calmly, as if it was nothing.\u201cDo you know why there aren\u2019t two saintesses in one generation?\u201dAt that, I shook my head.I thought I was a fake saintess anyway, so I didn\u2019t think much about it.\u201cWhen a new saintess appears, the original saintess reverts to an ordinary priestess. Mother died while still possessing holy power, but that was before she exerted her holy power on you.\u201dAnd after a while he reached out and took my hand.It was neither a rude or sudden move.\u201cHowever, the Saintess is still using your holy power.\u201dHis low voice rang in my ears. My heartbeat quickened.\u201cEven though your holy power will disappear if Camilla is truly a new saintess.\u201dI never thought that the holy power would disappear from me.Because\u2026 Even if the oracle is silent, I always feel the holy power inside my body.Cass\u2019 words confused me.\u201cWhat does this mean, I wonder.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201dHe cut me offMy heart thumped.\u201cThere have been a lot of surprises lately.\u201d\u201cBecause there are a series of things that have never happened in history.\u201dIn Ares, the gate towards the Demon Realm was about to explode.I looked away and opened my mouth.\u201cIf you think so, wouldn\u2019t it be strange if a new saintess appeared, but I still have strong divine power?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, if she\u2019s an anomaly.\u201dAt Cass\u2019 words, I looked straight at him.Yet there was something Cass didn\u2019t know. Camilla was the real protagonist of the prophecy I had read.If he mentioned an anomaly, it would mean me.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of several things. But one thing that confuses me right now\u2026\u201dAt Cass\u2019 words, I stared into his eyes for a while, then looked away.As there was no way to explain the disappearance of the oracle.\u201cI don\u2019t have the same power as before.\u201d\u201cBut just now\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t elaborate, but that\u2019s for sure.\u201dIt was true that the connected sacred power was intact, but it wasn\u2019t the same as before because I couldn\u2019t use the oracle, as if the use of the function had expired.I could feel Cass\u2019 gaze on me.Deep, incomprehensible eyes.\u201cThen what are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cWe are going to go through the process of confirming her holy power.\u201dI brought up the story that was going on.Rumors were circulating in the temple that Camilla would make a generational change as a new saintess.\u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable unless you go to the temple. Many people will be invited as witnesses. The request may go to the Marquis as well.\u201dSoon his voice was heard.\u201cThen you will have to prove it in front of everyone.\u201dIn the middle of those coolly shining ultramarine blue eyes, I could see my reflection.\u201cThat you\u2019re alive and well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Marquis.\u201d\u201cNo matter what power she has, no one deserves to be a saintess as much as you.\u201dHis eyebrows were stiff with anger.\u201c\u2026Do you really think I deserve it?\u201dThe reason why I\u2019m praised by people\u2019s mouths is because I made achievements as a saintess.But it wasn\u2019t for the sake of justice or out of fear of the Gods. It just happened that way. It was all for myself.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dAt my words, he turned his gaze the other way and pursed his lips.\u201cWhy are you so unsure of yourself?\u201dThose words that sounded like accusations stabbed me in the chest.\u201cYou know who you are, don\u2019t you?\u201dCass seemed to see right through me.\u201c\u2026\u201dSince I started out as a \u2018fake saintess\u2019 without being the main character in the first place, I had no choice but to be unsure. However, the real psychology underlying it may be the defensive instinct.I\u2019m fake, that\u2019s why I can live moderately.I\u2019m fake, that\u2019s why I can make mistakes.I\u2019m fake, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t need to be worried.And I\u2019m fake\u2026 That\u2019s why it\u2019s okay for me to be abandoned. It\u2019s supposed to be like that.So I guess I\u2019ve been in denial all along.Even if the oracle window that most clearly reveals that I\u2019m a saintess shines before my eyes, even if the Gods joke, even if powerful divine power dwells in my hand, even if stigma shines on my body.I denied all the evidence and confined myself.Yet when the moment I had been waiting for came, I felt more desperate than ever.The fact that there are many things around me that I love.***The sound of a skirt dragged behind Reihausd, who was arranging the temple library and rare old books, was heard.When he glanced back and found Camilla, his expression was somewhat dry.Camilla noticed Reihausd and moved closer to him.\u201cChief Priest Heinz asked me to help the High Priest organize the old books.\u201d\u201cHe spouted nonsense. I can do it alone, so go back.\u201dCamilla\u2019s hands trembled at the emotionless voice.She bit her lip for a moment, then opened her mouth again.\u201cWhat kind of tea do you like, High Priest? I\u2019ll heat up the tea then\u2026\u201d\u201cCamilla.\u201dReihausd turned her head and looked at Camilla with cold eyes.She was wearing a light blue, close-fitting dress known as the official saintess dress.\u201cI don\u2019t want to drink tea. However, it seems that the Chief Priest didn\u2019t advise you on the priest dress code.\u201dCamilla\u2019s blue eyes widened at those words.\u201cI heard that you became a friend of the Saintess, yet it never occurred to you that such a dress would be disrespectful to her.\u201dReihausd must have heard of her reviving a pair of Golden Crowns. However, there was no curiosity or interest in his dark gold eyes.It was colder than when they talked about Rotunia before.Camilla bit her lip for a second and then she opened her mouth a moment later.\u201c\u2026Is the High Priest planning to send me to the temple of Raid?\u201d\u201cYou heard the news.\u201dReihausd answered in a low voice.\u201cIs the reason you want to send me to the temple because the Saintess has changed since I came?\u201d\u201cOr are you afraid that I, who has strong divine power, will take over the position of the Saintess?\u201dHer blue eyes twinkled.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave. I\u2026 want to stay with you.\u201dCamilla\u2019s lips parted with difficulty.\u201c\u2026With the High Priest.\u201dThe beautiful man standing across from her parted his red lips coldly.\u201cTake care of your own life, Camilla.\u201dIt was meant as a clear warning.Camilla stared at him for a long while, then she turned around. There wasn\u2019t even a hint of warmth in Reihath\u2019s eyes.A faint voice escaped from her parched lips.\u201cWhy did it end up like this?\u201dHer clenched fist twitched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He mainly worked to assist the High Priest.\u201dAgainst the backdrop of the sunset, Cass\u2019 eyes were cold as he recited information about the dead priest.\u201cIt means that he was the direct priest of Sir Reihausd.\u201dNaturally, high-ranking priests had subordinate priests under their direct control.The lower priests assist the higher priests in their work like secretaries. And the low-ranking priest named Ron Vatos, who tried to attack me, was Reihausd\u2019s.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dI thought about Cass\u2019 words for a while before opening my mouth.\u201cMaybe because I watch a lot of dramas, I think it\u2019s boring.\u201d\u201cDra\u2026 ma, what is that?\u201d\u201cShould I say it\u2019s like a play full of conspiracies and schemes?\u201dI don\u2019t know who was behind Vatos, but how simple did they see me as?\u201cThe Saintess seems to have the same thoughts as me.\u201dCass faintly twisted the corners of his lips.\u201cI\u2019ll have to catch them.\u201dSomeone was trying to separate me and Reihas.They would think I would be suspicious of Reihausd if his direct priest tried to kill me.Although Reihausd had a dark and corrupt side, he considered me sacred beyond precious.\u201cCan you help\u2026 me?\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, I looked at Cass and said.\u201cWell.\u201dI couldn\u2019t guess what thoughts were in his deep ultramarine blue eyes.Is he calculating the gains and losses of helping me?\u201cPromise me one thing, and I\u2019ll use all of Lloyd\u2019s resources to help.\u201dI asked a little nervously.Most of the temple construction cost had already been received from Lloyd\u2019s Merchant.\u201cWhat kind of promise do you need?\u201dCass\u2019s lips parted. Then he reached up and ran his hand through the ends of my soft hair.\u201cEven a single hair of yours,\u201dMy body unconsciously flinched.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t get it hurt.\u201dHis low voice passed through my ears and shook my heart deep in my chest.A day later, I met Cass again outside the temple. We sat in a secluded teahouse, Lars, and talked.\u201cIt seemed like he was busy. I mean Sir Vester.\u201d\u201cStill, I\u2019m glad I was able to reach out to him because of Cass.\u201d\u201cSince there are magic tools, this is convenient.\u201dPerhaps that human, no, demon. Isn\u2019t his real purpose to take my soul because I couldn\u2019t keep the contract?He was lazy and uncooperative to be doubted as such.Still, while we were in touch, I obtained very important information from him. Many parts were prepared, and my mind was quite determined.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201dI answered Cass\u2019 question after deep thought.\u201c\u2026I have to pay her back.\u201dAn eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.A wound of heart for a wound of heart.If I can\u2019t repay her with the same thing, I will repay her with something bigger.And\u2026 I\u2019m going to meet them. Those whom I miss.\u201cI heard that His Highness the Crown Prince will also arrive at the capital tomorrow. We have reported everything about this situation.\u201dI nodded.\u201cThank you, Marquis.\u201dIf Cass hadn\u2019t become an active helper, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to find directions with my hands and feet tied.\u201cWill you just thank me in words?\u201dWhile drinking tea, he glanced at me.\u201cThen how should I thank you?\u201dThen he replied with a cool smile.\u201cIf everything is resolved, would you grant me a small wish?\u201dHe went on.\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult.\u201dAfter a moment of hesitation, I narrowed my eyes and asked.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to call for 10,000 franc while saying it\u2019s not much?\u201dPleasure flashed in his deep ultramarine blue eyes, then vanished.\u201cTrust is the life of a merchant, so it can\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then I\u2019ll listen.\u201dThus we passed the leisurely afternoon time. Back at the temple, Daisy pursed her lips.\u201cWhere have you been, Saintess? Do you know what just happened?\u201dDaisy\u2019s words spilled out and I took off my coat.\u201cThe high-ranking priestess serving Miss Camilla has taken two of our maids. Now she\u2019s letting me work there.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThis is an act of making fun of the Saintess. A rolling stone pulls out an embedded stone. After Miss Camilla did a miracle, everyone only took care of her\u2026\u201dShe grumbled in a disgruntled voice.\u201cDaisy.\u201dI put Kyuu in its house and patted Daisy on the shoulder.\u201cEverybody is so blasphemous! I can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s a new saintess! The Saintess is here, though\u2026\u201dDaisy said with disgust.I spoke softly to her.\u201cI know your feelings well. But I may have to retire soon.\u201dTo my words, Daisy replied as if it were nonsense.\u201cYou have only been a saintess for two years! To think that you\u2019re retiring!\u201dPerhaps the 2-year-old saintess will go down in history as the shortest-lived saintess.Usually, after becoming a saintess, one fulfills her duties for ten to fifty years, until her energy runs out.However, I officially became a saintess two years ago, and it\u2019s surprising that a new saintess has already appeared and I was retiring.\u201cCamilla is a good person.\u201dI told Daisy nicely. Because I know this is the safest way for her.\u201cSaintess\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell Camilla about Daisy. So that you can be assigned to a nice area.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dHowever, tears welled up in Daisy\u2019s eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a temple without the Saintess. So please don\u2019t talk like this. The only Saintess in the Empire is you!\u201dEven though my heart was moved by her sincere words, I reprimanded her sternly on the outside.\u201cWhat did Daisy come to the temple for?\u201d\u201cSaintess\u2026\u201d\u201cYou came here through a difficult competition to praise the Gods.\u201dDaisy\u2019s eyes shook at my words.\u201cA saintess is one who obeys the Gods\u2019 will, and she is replaced according to the Gods\u2019 will, so you should also obey.\u201dAfter a while, Daisy shed tears sorrowfully.\u201cHicc\u2026 Saintess\u2026\u201dHer upset voice hurt me too, yet now I had to accept the changes that were coming.I patted her on the shoulder and said,\u201cThank you so much for all this time. Daisy.\u201d\u201cHuwaaa\u2026\u00a0Hicc\u2026\u201dDaisy cried in my arms for a while.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave\u2026\u201dI accepted her complaints and continued to pat her.At some point, I felt the strange presence outside the door disappear. If Kyuu hadn\u2019t been standing up like that while looking outside, I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed.The unfamiliar sign completely disappeared, and after some time had passed, a knock was heard outside the door.Startled by that sound, Daisy fell off for a moment, wiping her wet face and getting up from her seat.\u201cHic, hicc\u2026\u201cAs she turned around, I saw her shoulders slightly trembling.I let out a small sigh and leaned my back against the chair.After a while she opened the door and someone familiar entered.\u201cDwayne.\u201dI smiled softly at him and asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHe held out something to me.\u201cSir Reihausd asked me to pass this on to the Saintess.\u201dIt was a small folded note. What is to come has come.I said, clenching the delivered note into my fist.\u201cDaisy, I\u2019m going to go out alone for a while.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That someone had elaborately imitated Reihas\u2019s handwriting.\u201cIt tells me to come to the fifth pillar of the hall.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201dCamilla replied with a puzzled look, as if she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201cIf I had gone, what would have been waiting for me\u2026 What do you think, Camilla?\u201dShe said, looking ignorant.\u201c\u2026Uh, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know what you mean. Did someone try to trap the Saintess by any chance?\u201dCamilla is as beautiful, bright and kind as the original novel I read, so I was fooled for a moment.She must be a really good main lead.However, as Reihausd said, there may be a more distorted valley behind the overly good thing.\u201cCamilla.\u201dI got up from the chair and stood facing her. I could see the green eyes flickering.\u201cI thought of you as a friend for a moment.\u201dAt my words, I saw her expression harden and the corners of her lips tremble.\u201cSaintess\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cDid you say that you always avoided Heinz? Yet in Ares, the story was different.\u201dI obtained the information through Cass.\u201cYou stuck with Heinz like you\u2019re soulmates. I heard that you were the Chief Priest\u2019s only henchman.\u201dHeinz appeared to be digging into Reihausd\u2019s background and trying to find his weakness. And so did Camilla, who paid attention to Reihausd.I asked her coldly.\u201cYou and Heinz sent Reihausd\u2019s man, Vatos, to kill me, and he tried to harm me again today.\u201dAfter rummaging through Vatos\u2019s belongings, they found Heinz\u2019s check.I wasn\u2019t shocked as I had experienced a lot of people who smiled brightly and then hit me in the back in my past life.\u201cWhat\u2019s your identity? Camilla.\u201dCamilla clenched her fists and lowered her head. And then, her lips slightly opened.\u201c\u2026Haha. Why would you ask when you know?\u201dAt that moment, I felt goosebumps running down my back.The feeling I felt when I saw her saving the Golden Crowns.Soon, Camilla raised a surprisingly expressionless face.\u201cI\u2019m the real saintess.\u201dThe soft look on her face I knew was gone.She\u2019s just a cold woman standing there with a surprisingly cold expression on her face. Yet it didn\u2019t surprise me any more.I looked at her and pursed my lips.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally showed your true colors, Camilla.\u201d***That night, the temple was overturned.First, it was because Saintess Ariel had disappeared, and second, because Reihausd attacked and tried to kill Camilla.All of the waiting knights were deployed to subdue him.Camilla\u2019s room was still noisy.\u201cHow is Sir Reihausd?\u201dHer anxious eyes made Heinz reassure her.\u201cHe\u2019s resting in his room. Of course, for safety reasons, he\u2019s tied up, but\u2026\u201dCamilla tucked her long hair behind her ears and stepped forward.\u201cI need to see him right now.\u201d\u201cMiss Camilla. There are a lot of eyes now, so it\u2019s better to stay still and not act rashly\u2026\u201dCamilla\u2019s eyes turned wild in an instant. It was completely different from her usual shining eyes.\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I did my best.\u201dCamilla glared at Heinz\u2019s flashing bald head and sat down in her chair.A dark shadow was cast over her fine brows.\u201c\u2026That sly fake. Ariel.\u201dIt tasted bitter as she remembered Ariel\u2019s face.She didn\u2019t fall into the trap of the note, but she was able to deal with the fake saintess by herself.However, Reihausd was outside the door. In a desperate situation, if Heinz hadn\u2019t attacked him with the Paladins, she would have been in big trouble.\u201cPlease release a wanted order. Now that things have happened like this, we need to move quickly.\u201d\u201cBut the entire Empire and the temple are highly praised for the Saintess, which has the opposite effect.\u201dCamilla lifted one of her hands and put it on her other arm. Then, a severe stab wound appeared on the surface of the arm.Surprised, Heinz\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cThe justification is up to the making.\u201dDespite the serious wound, her expression was calm.Heinz, who was looking at Camilla\u2019s wound and face, nodded and opened his mouth.\u201cIn the Ares mine, a fallen saintess, who got her power from the Demon Realm, seriously injured Saintess Camilla and attracted the High Priest then ran away. The current saintess is very dangerous, that should be enough.\u201dHeinz was a shrewd man. Except for his failure this time, he deserved credit.\u201cWe must find Ariel.\u201dCamilla wasn\u2019t perfect yet. It was a side effect that she had as she came here 4 years earlier.It was indispensable to Camilla that Ariel took \u2018it\u2019.She should have noticed from the moment Ariel entered her room. That Ariel was after the item.\u201cShe must be found and brought back.\u201dAriel was over her head on the subject of a fake saintess. She thought she was fooled by her fake appearance, yet how did she know?Camilla lowered her eyes. She then closed her eyes as if she was praying. She had her eyelashes quivering.***I think I walked for more than a few hours in the dark. I didn\u2019t even know if it was daylight or not.When was this aisle created? As I walked with many thoughts, at some point I saw a faint light in front of me.The light drew nearer very slowly.When the thickening light had grown sufficiently large and strong, I could see that it was the end of the passage.Cool breeze was blowing.As I barely stepped out of the aisle, a refreshing energy suddenly enveloped me.\u201cHere is\u2026\u201dIt was clearly a field where you could tell that it wasn\u2019t the temple.As I looked around, a chat window flashed before my eyes.[The oracle has been reactivated.]As expected, my prediction was correct.I didn\u2019t come all the way here to run away.It was to get them back.[Garden 6/6][The God of Justice, Hetuse, runs.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, examines your condition.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, uses \u2018Response\u2019 on you.][The God of Love, Odyssey, blesses you.][The God of Art, Mond, is looking after you.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, vents his anger on \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0.]\u201cI missed you.\u201d[The God of Justice, Hetuse, looks at you with warm eyes.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is staring at you.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, wags his tail.][The God of Art, Mond, is delighted.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, winks.]As if the Gods were responding to my words, the chat window flashed.

So that I can understand the situation accurately.\u201dVan, who seemed to have calmed down a bit, turned around.\u201cThis is a prophecy of the two of them.\u201dAnd I heard her voice.\u201cA saintess named Camilla will appear. She will place at her feet a king of great strength, a merchant of great wealth, and a priest of great honor, whose power will cover the world and reach to the ends of the earth.\u201dThe king would mean Kyle, the merchant would be Cass, and the priest was Reihausd.Up to this point was the story I had read in the original story, I focused on Van\u2019s words.\u201cTell me about the second half.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell me? I\u2019d rather just get out of here than to eat more sweet potatoes.\u201d (eating sweet potatoes means feeling frustrated.)\u201cThey will no longer love the Gods, they will be corrupted, and when the calamity strikes and the people will turn their backs on the Empire and the temple. The Gods will be very angry and allow the demons to confine the Saintess and the three men as they rule the human world for 900 years.\u201d\u201cHa..\u201dLooking into my eyes, Van continued.\u201cThe king, merchant and priest will die in agony, and Camilla will marry Diego Vester, who became the most powerful Demon King. All humans and demons will praise the God of Eternity, Raid, and the God of Lies, Bellatrix. The divided worlds of demons and humans become one.\u201dI put my hand on my forehead at Diego\u2019s name that suddenly jumped out.Diego seemed to hate this prophecy for some reason, thus he even signed a contract for me to \u2018continue to play the saintess\u2019.I wondered if the reason for his dislike was related to his marriage to Camilla.If he hates Camilla very much\u2026\u201cProphecy creates destiny. That is why the Gods don\u2019t do prophecies easily, and only occasionally pass them as an oracle through a saintess.\u201d\u201cBut they arbitrarily created offspring and prophesied. The first part of the prophecy\u2026 It was read by many people in other worlds, and it gave its power as a prophecy.\u201dCome to think of it, it was also something the Gods had shown as illusions of ancient documents. It was a video that seemed to flow without any explanation, so I just couldn\u2019t understand it properly.After a while, after sorting out the situation, I asked Van.\u201cI\u2019m curious, but why did the Gods make prophecies in favor of the Demon Realm?\u201dShe shook her head at my question.\u201cWe really don\u2019t know. What intentions did they have for this rebellion\u2026\u201dThis time they really didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s why I decided to move on.In fact, there were some things that I guessed a little bit.\u201cThen Camilla\u2026\u201dCamilla was the charming female lead of a reverse harem novel.I just thought that I had just entered the original story of the novel.Yet all of that was distorted from the start.\u201cCamilla is the offspring of two rebel Gods.\u201dIn the original novel, Camilla was a saintess with great power.She was nice and liked by everyone. The three male leads also loved her.\u201cSo, in the end, the conclusion of the story is\u2026\u201dWhen the prophecy is fulfilled, Kyle, Reihausd, and Cass all will die.And without blocking the gate, the worlds of demons and humans will merge. Perhaps the demons will rule the humans, who are weaker.\u201cAs a descendant of the Gods, Camilla was born with more powerful holy power than any human. She doesn\u2019t have to be chosen as a saintess, she is a saintess herself.\u201dVan\u2019s eyes were bitter.The reason Camilla couldn\u2019t see the oracle when she was in the temple was probably because of her great power.\u201cShe is the one who breaks all balance. The two Gods had offspring in order to create an existence that would disrupt the balance of the world. And Camilla\u2026 She will move meticulously according to their prophecy.\u201dAfter a moment I looked at Van and opened my mouth.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dSuddenly, my throat felt sore.\u201cWhy am I here?\u201dRen\u2019s eyes were shaking as he looked at me.\u201cThe reason I became a saintess is\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t guess anything.Why did I intrude into this fateful story?After a while, Van opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t know exactly, but if we guess why.\u201dVan interrupted my angry words.\u201cThe other Gods didn\u2019t readily accept the fate created by the two rebel Gods.\u201dIt was natural.\u201cBut inevitably, the Gods who couldn\u2019t break their prophecy must have thought of another way. It\u2019s an appeal to the God of the Beginning. A being that exists above the balance. An entity you don\u2019t even know exists\u2026 . We call it Providence.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dVan looked at me and said.\u201cYou\u2019re the one brought by Providence, perhaps for a balance that is probably on the verge of being destroyed. That\u2019s what we found: The intentions of the Gods didn\u2019t directly intervene, but because they\u2019re so special\u2026\u201dVan reached out and took my hand.Warmth came through.\u201cYou\u2019re a person who has no choice but to receive the attention and love of all the Gods.\u201dMy heart, which seemed to have stopped, started beating. As if my body exists here.\u201cI\u2019m not such a great person.\u201dAt my words, Van shook her head.\u201cNo, you deserve the love of the Gods.\u201dA certain moment was reflected in her eyes.My desperation to save Noah from dying, and the joy of saving Daisy.\u201cAs special as the beautiful color of your soul.\u201d\u201cEveryone has sympathy.\u201d\u201cThe soul the Gods love isn\u2019t a good soul. It\u2019s the most human-like soul, a soul that clearly emits human colors. Fear, greed, jealousy, reflection, repentance, and self-help. Each of those myriad colors has a bunch of possibilities. Countless possibilities to salvage a balance that is on the verge of being destroyed.\u201dAt Van\u2019s words, I shook my head.\u201cThe main character of this story is\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t me.Yet I heard Ren\u2019s voice.\u201c\u2026At least not Camilla.\u201dAt that, I raised my eyes and looked at him.\u201cWe\u2019re not even sure who it will be either.\u201dThe boy\u2019s faint smile entered.\u201cThe true saintess chosen by the Gods. A true saintess who creates her own destiny, not according to the prophecies. Wouldn\u2019t that be more likely?\u201dThe reason why the six Gods had an emergency meeting and sent me here\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s to get me to hear this.I had a strange feeling.\u201cIt\u2019s really filthy.\u201dIt feels like the crown, which I had denied so far, is now really forcibly placed on me.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not the kind of person who wants to be the main lead. I always hate troublesome and dangerous work.\u201dAll sorts of emotions clashed in my heart.However in the end, it\u2019s people\u2019s faces that won. Reihausd, Kyle, Cass, Daisy, Dwayne\u2026Above all, my peaceful future.\u201cNevertheless, if you want to bring me into the war, you guys have something to offer.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, I said with a face that seemed like I would lift the little kids by their collars at any moment.Van and Ren\u2019s faces suddenly darkened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had a strangely worried expression, unlike his usual expressionless look.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, welcomes you.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, examines your body.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is terrified that something happened to you.]\u201cI received a word from Marquis Lloyd. It seems like a lot has happened.\u201dI nodded my head at Kyle\u2019s words.After a moment of hesitation, not knowing where to begin, Kyle quietly spoke up.\u201cA new saintess appeared, and the former saintess fell into the demon\u2019s evil power and tried to kill the new saintess yet she ran away. High Priest Reihausd has been captured and is undergoing purification. That\u2019s what they say.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, is angry.]I raised my hand and touched my forehead.\u201cYes. That\u2019s right. The situation was progressing more urgently than I thought, so I was unable to tell Sir Reihausd. Even Daisy, my close aide.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. If you had contact with Reihausd, they might have noticed.\u201dShould I consider myself lucky that I didn\u2019t die?\u201cI heard that Reihausd was imprisoned and Chief Priest Heinz was acting as the high priest.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, is even angrier.]\u201c\u2026That damn old man.\u201d[The God of Art, Mond, strongly agrees with you.]I hadn\u2019t had a proper conversation with the Chief Priest, but from what I\u2019ve experienced, he was a person with a bad spirit.\u201cStill, everything went according to plan.\u201dI sighed and said.So, all of this was in the plan.With the help of Heinz, the Temple of Elium was taken over by Camilla surprisingly quickly, so it was almost certain that I would be caught if I left the temple through the usual passage.That\u2019s why I used the secret passage of the temple that Cass had told me about. The road that the former saintess, who was said to be his birth mother, often used, had an underpass all the way to the outskirts of the capital.And as expected, after leaving the temple, the oracle returned again. It wasn\u2019t that the Gods had left, it was that the propagation of the oracle was being hindered.\u201cI won\u2019t let her go.\u201dAs I gritted my teeth, the corners of Kyle\u2019s lips lifted a little.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you still have energy.\u201d\u201cWell, there is no reason to be depressed.\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, blesses you.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, blesses you.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, blesses you.]Still, in the eyes of the Gods, I seemed to have no energy, thus everyone gave me a blessing.I leaned closer to Kyle and asked.\u201cAh, did you take care of the things I had?\u201dKyle pointed to the box next to the bed.Opening the box and checking the items, I smiled lightly.This was Camilla\u2019s greatest weakness, and a weapon that could reveal her true self and defeat her.Suddenly, a new status window popped up in front of me.[The hidden mission has been activated.][Hidden Mission: Prevent Camilla from becoming a saintess and undo her prophecy.][Hidden Mission Reward: Increased Oracle Level.]This time, unlike before, the compensation was clearly written.\u2018By the way, who the hell is making these hidden missions?\u2019I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Ren and Van.\u2018If the oracle level rises, will a new god enter?\u2019I didn\u2019t know, but I was ready to accept this hidden mission.Kyle looked down at me and clicked her tongue briefly.\u201cI thought only the power struggle in the Imperial Palace was fierce, yet the temple is no less.\u201dI sighed with a bitter expression.\u201cI really hate complicated and troublesome things.\u201dReihausd\u2019s last appearance shimmered. I came out in such a hurry that Daisy didn\u2019t even notice what had happened.\u2018How is she?\u2019I hated being involved in a conflict situation, but a person who has a lot to lose can\u2019t wait.What I got from Ren and Van this time was the absolute oracle connection ability. It\u2019s also the ability of the radar role that Ren and Van use to monitor the Gods and humans.Now the Gods could stay in touch with me wherever I was, even in the Demon\u2019s Realm. Unless I disable the oracle.Of course, Ren and Van were crying because they took their parts so they couldn\u2019t keep an eye on the Gods.\u201cBy the way, how did you get information about that item?\u201dLooking at the box, I answered Kyle with a small sigh.\u201cBaron Diego Vester.\u201dIf the contract is signed, important information will be informed in advance.He told me about the item only after being contacted through Kyle\u2019s magic sphere.\u201cBaron Vester?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s also a bit of a foul. Tax audit later\u2026 If\u00a0 there\u2019s anything similar, brush it off.\u201dI subtly leaked information about Diego to Kyle.Anyway, after this is over, it\u2019s a contract and I\u2019ll never have anything to do with Diego.Just then, a knocking sound was heard outside.\u201cYour Highness, the priests have arrived. They said you had brought an exhausted young lady back, so they stopped by.\u201dI looked back at Kyle nervously.I knew that there were priests of Elium for treatment even in the Imperial Palace. But now I couldn\u2019t trust the priests.Kyle shouted toward the door in a slightly louder voice, as if telling them not to worry.\u201cI don\u2019t need treatment.\u201dThere was a moment of silence at those words.\u201cWell, but to verify her identity\u2026\u201d\u201cWould it be quicker for you to check the woman\u2019s naked body, or for me to cut the neck of the insolent and drop it?\u201dThere was a moment of silence over those words with a menacing tone. It was like someone gasping for breath.\u201cAh, I understand. Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dI could feel the footsteps of the people in front of the door slowly receding.He said, looking back at me.\u201cThanks to you, unwanted rumors will circulate in the Imperial Palace.\u201d***Since I had come to the Imperial Palace, there were things I had to do.\u201cWill it be okay?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI changed into the clothes Kyle had brought, covered my face, and went with him to the Emperor\u2019s bedchamber.\u201cGo away.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an order.\u201dSeeing Kyle\u2019s sad face, the maids and servants left the Emperor\u2019s room.The exclusive priests who guarded the Emperor\u2019s side were also expelled while sweating a lot. Only me and Kyle were left.I saw the Emperor lying dead on the bed. His complexion didn\u2019t look good.I moved closer to the Emperor and put my hand on his wrist. At that moment, the chat window flashed.[Odyssey, the god of love, uses \u2018Response\u2019 on you.]Various memories passed before my eyes.Memories of the Empress before Ros\u00e9, and young Kyle. The memory of the day he lost the former empress.And the memory of the day Ros\u00e9 became the new empress.The servants he loved. those who betrayed and left. The emptiness and loneliness felt in the seat of the supreme.Responding to that feeling even slightly, I focused the holy power on my hand. Then, it felt as if the holy power was sucked into his hand.\u201cYour holy power\u2026 It works.\u201dI heard Kyle\u2019s voice.I continued to send holy power to the Emperor.Holy power wasn\u2019t helpful in deteriorating the condition caused by a wound in the heart, but Odyssey\u2019s Response opened a way for the holy power to go. It was as if he was comforting the Emperor\u2019s heart.His face seemed much more comfortable after letting my holy power flow for quite a long time.I slowly let go of the Emperor. Kyle looked at his father with dark eyes, then moved his gaze to me.\u201cYou\u2019ve done a good job.\u201dHis voice was deeper than usual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the story took a twist when she escaped the prophecy, in the end everything will go according to the will of the two Gods.And\u2026Click\u3161The prison door opened.A cool breeze hit her skin.A solid body of a blonde man in the middle of a blood-soaked shirt was seen. His appearance illuminated by the blue moonlight coming through the palm-sized window was truly artistic.He was so beautiful that even she, who had no particular interest in men except for Diego, the final opponent of the prophecy, couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him.\u201cSir Reihausd.\u201dCamilla approached Reihausd and called him. He looked up at him coldly, with his eyes that weren\u2019t warm even a little.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dHis eyes weren\u2019t supposed to be like this. He had to look at her with eyes full of desire and obsession.Camilla leaned over to him. Her face and lips were right in front of him.[The God of Lies, Bellatrix, blesses you.]After a while, Reihausd\u2019s lips opened.His golden eyes began to cloud.\u201cA\u2026 riel\u2026?\u201dIt was unbearably unpleasant to hear the girl\u2019s name, yet Camilla tried to put on a thin smile. Because she knew what she looked like in his eyes.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026\u201dHe sounded confused.Camilla whispered, pressing her lips close to his.\u201cI was going to throw everything away because it felt like a life that didn\u2019t fit my way, but I couldn\u2019t bear to leave Sir Reihausd.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cI have always loved you.\u201dCamilla lifted his hand and placed it on his shoulder.His thin clothes slid down his shoulders as she touched him.She could see Reihausd\u2019s gold eyes shimmering.\u201cHug me.\u201dCamilla whispered.When she first arrives at the temple, her heart begins to burn as Reihausd has his eyes only on Ariel.Reihausd.Prophetically, he was a man who was merely firewood. However, when she found out that the man she thought was hers had his heart set on some fake saintess, she was madly offended.\u201c\u2026Hug me deeply.\u201dBorn with a divine mission, Camilla loved herself. She was confident she would do better than the prophecy version of her.However, now there was a lot of anger as she must get her own things back first. Along with the possessive desire towards this man, who was far more beautiful than she ever imagined.\u201c\u2026\u201dReihausd\u2019s hand touched Camilla\u2019s cheek.His shaking gold eyes were creepy and decadent.A man with a stronger obsession and desire than anyone else under a stoic appearance. Her first possession.\u201cCamilla\u2026\u201dHis red lips clapped. And in an instant, she could feel his hand touching her neck..He had a cold anger in his eyes that looked like he was going to swallow her up at any moment.Camilla, who was grabbed by her throat, stiffened.\u201cWhy? how\u2026!\u201dOne of Bellatrix\u2019s abilities, the God of Lies, was to cloud the opposite sex as if they were drunk.That\u2019s why it was easy for them to mistake her for someone else, which made it difficult to distinguish even if it was the closest family and blood.However, at this moment, Reihausd\u2019s eyes were filled with strong conviction that the person in front of him wasn\u2019t Ariel.\u201cThere\u2019s no way Ariel would say that to me.\u201dHis cool voice rang in her ears. A sad, lonely smile formed on his lips.\u201cShe won\u2019t come to me. Even if it\u2019s an illusion.\u201dThe moment Camilla heard it, blood rushed to her head.Ariel, he was comparing her to the fake bitch.As if he thought she was virtuous.Camilla used her power to break free from Reihausd\u2019s clutch, yet it left a red handprint on her neck.She glared at him for a while before opening her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m the real saintess. That kid is fake. That witch\u2026!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dCamilla\u2019s words were interrupted by his drunken eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t care whether she\u2019s real or fake.\u201dCamilla looked at him, startled.\u201cThe important thing is that you\u2019re not Ariel.\u201dWhat flowed inside the beautiful and empty gold eyes was a desperate reaction of contempt.\u201cYou\u2019re not her.\u201dShe gritted her teeth.What is that fake saintess, who made this noble man so possessed?\u201cThat\u2019s right.

Even if you reject it, you will be mine in the end.\u201dShe was annoyed that she couldn\u2019t steal people\u2019s hearts even with the authority of the Gods.Camilla nervously turned around and closed the prison door.Her eyes were stained with nervousness. She hurriedly thought that she should meet two other men.\u2018Ariel couldn\u2019t have already taken over the hearts of those two men, could she?\u2019Forebodings engulfed her mind.***Three days had passed since I came to the Imperial Palace.Today, after secretly finishing the Emperor\u2019s treatment, I entered Kyle\u2019s room.Since I had to thoroughly hide the fact that I was in the Imperial Palace from the temple, I was almost stuck with Kyle.Even the servants and maids kept by my side were only the most trusted people, and I didn\u2019t reveal my identity even to them.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, is getting bored.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, wants destruction.][The God of Love, Odyssey, wants romance.]The chat window in front of me flashed non-stop.While the oracle connection wasn\u2019t working, the Gods would chatter all day, perhaps quite bored.\u201c\u2026Should we just stick together here?\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, agrees with you.]As I looked out the window and talked to myself, I heard Kyle\u2019s voice from behind.\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201dHe was sitting at the tea table, gracefully tilting his teacup.\u201cThe Imperial Palace is always short of manpower.\u201dThe Kyle I saw for three days was a vicious employer.Still, the working conditions of the servants and maids were on the better side, but the people around him really behaved like dogs.[Please stop His Highness.]There was a dark shadow under the eyes of the Young Duke Shane Rockford whom I met yesterday. He said that he stayed up all night for the construction of the canal.Besides, since he gave him a job in what happened in the temple,\u00a0 would surely die from overwork.\u201cIt was a joke.\u201d\u201cIf at any time you\u2019re thinking of leaving the temple completely, let me know. I\u2019ll give you a very nice position.\u201d\u201cNo. I have now decided to acknowledge the temple as my home.\u201dI answered politely and firmly.\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you at least curious what kind of position it is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not curious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s jammed.\u201dHe furrowed his fine eyebrows a little and muttered, as if he didn\u2019t like it.It was also the same with the priests dispatched from the temple of Elium.\u2018Those who don\u2019t want to work like crazy, don\u2019t even eat.\u2019Apparently, this was Kyle\u2019s theory.\u201cBut, how are you going to deal with that?\u201dWhile drinking tea, Kyle suddenly pointed to the box on the bedside table.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dIt had been several days since the maids weren\u2019t allowed to come near the box and the items were tightly secured.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say that was the source of Camilla\u2019s power?\u201dAt Kyle\u2019s urging, I remembered the conversation I had with Diego Vester.Beyond the crystal ball, I can see the scenery of a secluded beach and the sound of waves. And the figure of him lying on the bed, showing off his strong upper body.\u2018Ah, the more I think about it, the more I get pissed off.\u2019When I argued that it would have been better if Diego\u2019s explanation had been a little sincere, he said something.[It\u2019s fine if you complete the contract, but even if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll have fun. You\u2026 No, your soul looks so delicious.]Son of a bitch.Anyway, according to his explanation, Camilla, who should have accumulated strength for 4 years and appeared as a complete saintess, appeared in a hurry.Thus, she carries the power she couldn\u2019t absorb yet in the form of a \u2018statue\u2019 and will absorb it for the next four years.He also said that the property was like food for Camilla, so without it, she wouldn\u2019t be able to display her original power.\u201cCan\u2019t we just break it down?\u201dI shook my head at Kyle\u2019s seemingly troublesome remark.\u201cI told you. If we destroy that, Camilla might run out of control.\u201dIt was a warning from Diego.Still, if you starve for three days, your eyes will turn upside down\u2026I looked out the quiet window and pursed my lips.\u201cWouldn\u2019t tomorrow be enough?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dKyle drank the remaining tea from the cup.

And a lightly resonating sound, ck.In an instant, one side of Heinz\u2019s wrinkled cheeks swelled red.\u201c\u2026S-Saintess?\u201dCamilla opened her mouth, looking down in contempt at Heinz\u2019s face in vain\u201cHow incompetent are you that you can\u2019t control the public opinion of the temple properly?\u201dAriel now was definitely more popular than Camilla. Despite her overwhelming holy power, which Camilla displayed in saving the Golden Crowns, they were all looking for Ariel and concerned.In this way, there\u2019s no benefit in revealing her existence in haste.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We will do our best to recruit priests and Paladins.\u201dHeinz bowed and continued to make excuses.If only things went well in the mine\u2026Camilla pursed her lips.If only Ariel died after failing to restore the gate in the mine, and she appeared like a comet, she would\u2019ve been the hero of the country.If so, she wouldn\u2019t have had such a hard time.How disgusting it was for her to come all the way here to Elium and pretend to be an innocent priestess.Especially in front of Ariel.[We\u2019re the same age, so shall we get along?]Ariel\u2019s carefree smile, without malice, suddenly came to her mind.\u201cHa, cheekily.\u201dCamilla furrowed her eyebrows.How dare she.\u201cSaintess, is there anything else that bothers you?\u201dHeinz asked with an anxious look.\u201cIt bothers me a lot that it\u2019s driving me crazy. I need to find Father\u2019s statue.\u201dCamilla gritted her teeth and said.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 It\u2019s an idea that just came to my mind, why don\u2019t you ask the Imperial Palace for help?\u201dHe asked cautiously.\u201cThe Imperial Palace?\u201dCamilla thought for a moment, then she opened her mouth. Come to think of it, she even had to meet Prince Kyle once.\u201cHis Imperial Majesty was still in bed, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI need to write a letter to the Crown Prince.\u201dHaynes bowed his head deeply and went back to get the stationery and quill pen.***Late night. Kyle\u2019s room.[The God of Destruction, Ciel, distracts Hessed.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, draws Ciel\u2019s attention with homemade snacks.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is eating a snack.]The chat window in front of my eyes flashed insanely.A chessboard was spread out in front of me, and Kyle across from me was staring at the chessboard with a grim face.Even though I was playing in Ghost Chess King mode, the match against Kyle was a bloody long way off.\u2018No, why is he so good at chess?\u2019\u201cWhat did you bet on? Was it your life, I wonder.\u201d\u201c\u2026Your Highness. Please don\u2019t joke like that.\u201dI shook my head eerily at his joke, which was different from Cass\u2019 and Reihausd\u2019s.As I moved the knight, Hessed told me the next move through the chat window.It was a whopping 100 franc bet. In modern terms, it was about a million won.\u2018In modern times, I would have been arrested for betting.\u2019\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKyle doubtfully questioned and frowned, as if my move was a bit complicated.\u201cYou\u2019re not using your holy power, are you?\u201d\u201cPhew, Your Highness. How does one play chess with holy power?\u201dI shook my head as if it was nonsense.[The God of Justice, Hetuse, shakes his head at your shamelessness.]Fufu. Kyle, you\u2026 are lagging behind.I made my move again confidently ahead of my first income of 100 franc.But after a while, I heard his low voice.\u201cCheckmate.\u201d\u2026My goodness. Kyle, are you really a human?How can you win a game of chess against a God?[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, denies reality, saying that this is a dream.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, recommends Hessed to change his name.][The God of Love, Odyssey, proposes a new title, \u2018the God of Defeat\u2019.]I let out a small sigh as I looked at the chat window where the fun of teasing began again. And I looked at his eyes while touching the All-Purpose Pocket.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to pay money, labor is fine.\u201dIn response to his merciless words, where the merits and demerits were clear, I pouted and handed over 100 franc.[Your Money: 20,800 franc]I have to go back to the temple and collect my salary.At that time, the voice of a servant was suddenly heard from outside the door.\u201cYour Highness. Marquis Cass Lloyd has arrived.\u201d\u201cTell him to come in.\u201dAfter a while, the door opened and Cass came in.Cass\u2019 face looked tougher and colder, perhaps because of the shadow cast by the dim light.\u201cI\u2019m greeting Your Highness the Crown Prince and the Saintess.\u201d\u201cSit down.\u201dCass walked in slowly and sat down in a chair around the chess table.His eyes scanned the chessboard I had lost.\u201cLooks like you were playing chess.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, sheds tears, saying that he never dreamed that he would lose.]Does Cass have any idea? The fact that the God who bought his stock was whimpering because he had lost chess against Kyle.\u201cYes. Because I was too bored waiting for the Marquis.\u201dAt my words, Cass lifted the tip of his lips and smiled lightly.\u201cIt seems you have been waiting for me for a long time.\u201dHe put the items he had brought on the table.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGreat. Now, the final preparations are ready.\u201cA letter came from the temple today.\u201dThen Kyle spoke to Cass in a stiff tone.\u201cCamilla sent a personal letter saying that she would treat His Imperial Majesty herself.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s pretty eager to build a foundation.\u201d\u201cSo I said I\u2019d come and talk to her tomorrow.\u201dCass\u2019 eyes turned to me.\u201cAre you two going together?\u201dI nodded at his words.After a moment of silence, Cass spoke to me.\u201cRemember what I said last time.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d[The God of Destruction, Ciel, wonders what Cass said.][The God of Love, Odyssey, blushes as he remembers what Cass said.]Cass responded by raising the corners of his lips.\u201cI just asked her to be careful.\u201dWhat he had said came to my mind.[Don\u2019t get even a single hair of yours hurt.]Well, it\u2019s true that the advice told me to be careful.When I remembered the voice that had been whispering in my ears, my face seemed to heat up for no reason.When Kyle\u2019s eyes glanced at me, I awkwardly smiled alternately at Kyle and Cass.\u201cThen, shall we all go back now for tomorrow\u2019s work?\u201dAfter looking at me for a moment, Kyle nodded and got up.I was using his room, which was kept under tight security, and Kyle was sleeping in another room.I saw the two men off and shut the door. Then I muttered quietly.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can sleep well today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The part I didn\u2019t understand the most while reading a novel\u2026\u201dI said to Kyle while staring blankly at the scenery outside the window in the carriage.\u201cWas the reason the main character, who has enough power and ability, disguises oneself and crawls into a dangerous situation when they take out something from the enemy. But actually, it made a little sense. If you go through the front door like this\u2026\u201dA small smile crept across Kyle\u2019s lips as he stared at me.\u201cIt\u2019s more tense and burdensome.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry about someone going to cut your throat in the dark.\u201d\u201c\u2026Your choice of terms is really blunt.\u201dWhen I shuddered my shoulders, he told me not to worry.\u201cI\u2019m the Crown Prince of the Empire. No one can disobey me. Even if it\u2019s someone from the temple.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And I\u2026\u201dI was speechless, recalling an item I bought at the <Shop> before leaving the Imperial Palace.Although I bought Oman\u2019s product that had been in the market for so long, there was a fatal flaw in how to use the product.\u201cWhy are you blurting out your words?\u201d\u201c\u2026It hurts just thinking about it.\u201dThere is such a thing, Your Highness the Crown Prince.After a while, the carriage stopped in front of the temple. He escorted me out of the carriage first. I took his hand and carefully set my foot on the ground.I was wearing a black veil that covered my entire head and face, but contrary to that, I was wearing a gorgeous red dress, which looked very fancy.Is it because of the unusual clothes? Fortunately, no one recognized me.He took my hand and walked into the temple. High-ranking priests greeted us.\u201cYour Highness the Crown Prince, welcome.\u201d\u201cThe blessings of the Nine Gods be upon Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cThe Saintess is waiting for you.\u201d\u2018\u2026Her holy power hasn\u2019t even been checked, yet she\u2019s already a saintess?\u2019It\u2019s probably Heinz\u2019s work. With Reihausd pushed out, it must be completely his world.\u201cBut the person next to you\u2026\u201dWhen someone asked a question, curious about me, who was standing next to Kyle, he answered firmly.\u201cMy lover.\u201dThe high-ranking priest asked with bewildered eyes.\u201cYour\u2026 lover?\u201dIt\u2019s probably the first time one has heard that Kyle has a lover.It hasn\u2019t been long since rumors spread that he had a relationship with the former saintess or that he was getting married, though he saw women as rocks.\u201cWhy. Anything to say about my lover?\u201d\u201cN-Nothing.\u201dThe high-ranking priest looked at me suspiciously, yet he couldn\u2019t say anything at Kyle\u2019s sharp gaze.Kyle took my hand and started walking. I felt a little uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t bother to remove his hand.I slowly looked around as I walked so as not to arouse suspicion. The temple, which I used to walk every day as if it were my home, felt unfamiliar, perhaps because it had been a long time since I had visited.\u201c\u2026It\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201dI asked Kyle in a small voice as if I was whispering.\u201cNo one would dare to unveil my lover.\u201dKyle responded with a snort.Well, no matter how strong the influence of the temple was, it was the age of absolute monarchy. Besides, isn\u2019t the Crown Prince the only member of the Imperial Family now that the Emperor is absent? It\u2019s not a business that can be confirmed by a mere high-ranking priest.We went straight to the outdoor terrace where Camilla was waiting.As I walked into the hallway, I saw Camilla, who sat near the round tea table, standing up. Her body was draped in a saintess\u2019 dress similar to the design I used to wear.[I\u2019m just a priestess, though\u2026 I won\u2019t fit to be a friend of the Saintess.]I still remember the humble and nice Camilla\u2019s innocent smile.Compared to what I saw at the end, she was an acting genius.I could feel the edge of one of my lips rising crookedly.[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, looks at Camilla with a sharp gaze.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, growls.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, spits,\u00a0ptooey.]The Gods also didn\u2019t seem to like Camilla\u2019s existence, which had been interfering with the oracle. I mean, Camilla is the heir of the two Gods who rebelled against them.\u201cWelcome. Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dCamilla said, looking straight at Kyle with the confidence of the female lead.In the original story, Kyle was interested in Camilla\u2019s attitude.He was both displeased and intrigued by her dual appearance, which was hard and business-like in front of him, who was a strong person, yet benevolent towards others, and then gradually became drawn to her.\u2018But that is also just the prophecy.\u2019As Ren and Van said, I\u2019m the one who changes the prophecy.\u2018It won\u2019t be the same as before, Camilla.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019ve arrived. Your Highness the Crown Prince.\u201dBeside Camilla, Heinz bent down and greeted Kyle. Since the High Priest was absent, she seemed to be taking his place.\u2018Originally, it was supposed to be Reihausd\u2019s seat, though.\u2019When I thought of Reihausd, my clenched fist suddenly gained strength.\u201cBut this person is\u2026\u201dHeinz looked at me and blurted out his words.\u201cMy lover.\u201dKyle responded in a nonchalant tone.In an instant, I saw Camilla harden her face.Her complexion darkened noticeably, and her pupils shook in bewilderment.In the original story, Kyle was aloof from all women and the only woman he was interested in was Camilla, so she didn\u2019t seem to anticipate this situation.She probably expected that Kyle wouldn\u2019t have a partner.\u201cYour Highness\u2019\u2026 lover?\u201dCamilla\u2019s cold gaze turned to me.She didn\u2019t seem to recognize me, fortunately I was wearing a veil and a red dress that I didn\u2019t normally wear.\u201cYes. She came with me because she wanted to see the temple.\u201dKyle replied firmly.\u201cMy lover wore a veil because she\u2019s very shy, so don\u2019t mind her.\u201d\u201c\u2026Welcome to the temple.\u201dCamilla looked at me with the same bright smile she had before.However, I could see the anxiety in her green eyes.\u2018I won\u2019t be fooled anymore.\u2019I bowed my head silently to express my greeting.Soon after, we sat around the tea table.\u201cHow is His Imperial Majesty\u2019s condition?\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t much of a difference.\u201d\u201cPerhaps\u2026 he may need holy power.\u201dTaking over Heinz and Kyle\u2019s conversation, Camilla opened her mouth.She said, tucking the beautiful blonde hair behind her ear.\u201cFortunately, my holy power is different from that of the previous saintesses. Maybe that will help.\u201dThen Heinz nodded his head and said.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If it\u2019s the holy power of the Saintess who saved two dead Golden Crowns, even His Imperial Majesty the Emperor will recover soon.\u201dFollowing Heinz\u2019s words, Camilla smiled lightly.\u201cAfter the turn of the urgent sick people in the temple that you can see right now ends, I will go straight to the Imperial Palace.\u201dI felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I recalled a scene from the original story from her words.Camilla\u2019s line seems to be similar when the Empress was upset and needed a saintess.\u2018Then Kyle threatened Camilla, saying, \u2018Are you delaying the treatment of the Imperial Family for the sake of the sick people?\u2019However, Camilla fiercely confronted Kyle, saying that there was no regard in life. It was also a turning point in deepening Kyle\u2019s interest in her.\u201cLet it be, then.\u201dYet Kyle\u2019s reply was dry.For an instant, I saw Camilla\u2019s eyebrows twitch.\u2018As expected\u2026\u2019As I saw the original story, Camilla seemed to know the prophecy.She expected the reaction she had predicted from Kyle, but as Kyle bounced it off again, she looked very bewildered.\u201c\u2026Ah. Yes.\u201dIt was great to see Camilla\u2019s expression shake. There wasn\u2019t a slightest gap on Kyle for her to dig.Camilla, barely hiding her bewildered eyes, raised the teacup. And after she took a sip of tea, she looked at me and asked.\u201cBy the way, doesn\u2019t the Lady have tea?\u201dThere was a strange hostility in her clear eyes.It\u2019s not like there was something in the tea, but she seemed to be trying to see my face at that time because I would have to lift my veil to drink it.\u201cMy lover doesn\u2019t like tea.\u201dKyle answered for me.I responded with a light laugh.After a while, I got up from my seat as planned. Kyle glanced at Camilla and explained what my intention was.\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 wants to see the temple. Teatime seems a bit boring.\u201d\u201cThen the Paladins will guide\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll attach my soldiers.\u201dHeinz\u2019s words were firmly rejected by Kyle.I nodded my head, greeted them, and turned around. The voices of the three people talking behind me faded away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was worried about whether Kyuu and Daisy were doing well.\u201cKyuu\u2026\u201dI stroked Kyuu\u2019s fur through my sleeve.Kyuu was also rubbing its body against my wrist as if it was happy.\u201cIt\u2019s a relief. That you\u2019re safe.\u201d[Ciel, the God of Destruction, pities it.]The door to my room was locked, but I guess they didn\u2019t imprison the golden hamster.\u201cKyuu, kyuu kyuuuu!\u201dAs soon as Kyuu saw me, it became restless. It was as if it wanted to convey something.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dWhen I looked closely, Kyuu went back to its nest and pretended to be distressed. It seemed to mean that it was roughly locked up and couldn\u2019t get out.\u201cIs Daisy locked up?\u201dEscaping with Daisy with the old used secret passage map was highly risky, so I had left the temple without telling her.I thought Daisy, who didn\u2019t spill any information, because she didn\u2019t know anything, would be safe\u2026\u201cKyuuu\u2026\u201d\u201cDid Camilla lock her up?\u201d\u201cKyuu!\u201d\u201cDo you know where she\u2019s trapped?\u201d\u201cKyuu kyuu, kyuu kyuu, kyuuuuu kyuu kyuu\u2026\u201dKyuu tried to explain with all its might, but I couldn\u2019t understand its words right away.It was when I was listening to Kyuu\u2019s explanation several times.[Ciel translates Kyuu\u2019s words that Daisy is imprisoned in the underground prison under the west wing.]\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d[Ciel turns around, blushing.]Turns out Ciel\u2026 knows how to speak the hamsters\u2019 language.***The place I arrived at soon was a dark and wet semi-basement cave.After asking Kyle\u2019s knights to stand guard, I went downstairs.As I groped my way through the darkness, I saw the outline of an underground prison.Yet for an instant, I felt a strange presence behind my back.I turned around in surprise and saw a familiar face. It was Dwayne, who had taken off his Paladin uniform and was wearing plain clothes.Dwayne asked me in a small, urgent voice.\u201cWhere have you been, Saintess? Do you know that Elium is turned upside down?\u201d\u201cI know. Sshh. First of all, I\u2019m here to save Daisy, so be quiet.\u201d\u201cSir Reihausd is also imprisoned.\u201dHe must have come to rescue Reihausd. I wish I could save him too if we had met before.\u201cThe Paladins on Heinz\u2019s side are guarding the prison.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201dI also had something in mind.I faced soldiers with torches.\u201cW-Who are you!\u201dIt was the time for me to take out the holy relic that I bought at the shop, though I didn\u2019t want to.[Oman\u2019s Lash \u2013 When you wield this whip and say a special starter, all the opposite sex will obey you.]\u201cTowards the Queen\u2026\u201dI shouted as I wielded it.\u201cObey!\u201dThen, a few beams of light from the whip flew, wriggling as if they were alive, wrapping themselves around the soldiers and causing them to fall.The fallen soldiers crawled on the floor, fumbling as if they were drunk.[The God of Benevolence, Oman, is very satisfied, saying that he said it would help, didn\u2019t he.][The God of Knowledge, Hessed, covers his eyes in embarrassment.][The God of Art, Mond, can\u2019t hold back his laughter.]It was a useful holy relic that I didn\u2019t want to buy after seeing the \u2018starter\u2019 part in the shop, the whip.I also have the blessing of Ciel, the God of Destruction, but I chose it because I think I need a weapon to deal with people in the dark\u2026 How absurd.Dwayne\u2019s startled voice came from behind.\u201cQueen\u2026 You say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI kept swinging the lash, ignoring his words.\u201cObey the Queen!\u201dAgain, the soldiers fell.[The God of Justice, Hetuse, is a little ashamed of you.]\u2026My face was hot.\u2018Uugh.\u2019Still, thanks to the long whiplash, there\u2019s nothing quite like it for a ranged weapon.\u201cQueen\u2026\u201dLeaving behind Dwayne, who muttered in a timid voice, I hurriedly searched for Daisy.\u201cDaisy.\u201dBut the inside of the bar I was holding was empty.\u201cDaisy!\u201dI looked around and shouted. Then a faint voice came from the corner.\u201cSain\u2026tess\u2026\u201dIt was Daisy\u2019s voice.I hurriedly approached the grate where the noise came from. There was Daisy, leaning against the cold wall, staring at me helplessly.\u201cMy goodness.\u201dI applied force to the lock.Thanks to Ciel\u2019s blessing, the door was immediately broken open with a creak.\u201cNo, how can you handle iron with your bare hands\u2026?\u201dI heard Dwayne gasping behind me, yet I didn\u2019t care and went inside the prison.Then I threw off the veil and helped Daisy as she staggered to her feet.\u201cDaisy. Are you okay? Such\u2026\u201d\u201cSaintess\u2026 Why did you come? It\u2019s dangerous here.\u201dTears welled up in Daisy\u2019s eyes.\u201cCamilla is a witch. I\u2019m saying she\u2019s evil. She has strange powers.\u201dDaisy\u2019s body trembled as she spoke sparsely, struggling. She must have been through a lot of hardships.\u2018Poor thing.\u2019I concentrated energy in my hands and energized Daisy\u2019s body. Fortunately, I felt her trembling body gradually calm down.\u201cDwayne. Support Daisy.\u201dImmediately, he came over and held Daisy in a bridal style.\u201cSaintess. You can\u2019t go\u2026\u201dShe reached out to me and said.\u201cI\u2019m in a hurry, so let\u2019s talk later. I have to save Sir Reihausd.\u201d\u201cThat person\u2026 He\u2026 He\u2019s out of his mind right now.\u201dDaisy shook her head.Something must have happened to Reihausd. However, I didn\u2019t care and moved busily to find him.\u2018Please\u2026 stay alive.\u2019***\u201cSir Reihausd. Sir Reihausd!\u201dI ran from place to place calling his name.Yet there was no response from him anywhere.But I couldn\u2019t give up. I kept looking for him in the prison cells, and finally found him in the last cell near the exit.\u201cSir Reihausd\u2026\u201dBut I hesitated to reach out to open the door.He was hanging in the air with chains hanging around his arms.Traces of the whip all over this body, bloodstains, and even his eyes were covered with bandages. It was so miserable that I couldn\u2019t bear to open my eyes and see him.\u201cReihausd!\u201dWatching it blankly, I broke down the door and entered the room.He just hung there, as if he couldn\u2019t hear my voice.The traces of the whip on his whole strong body made it possible for me to guess what kind of time he had spent.To think that they made the temple\u2019s High Priest like this. It\u2019s something shocking.I raised my whip and shouted.\u201cObey the Queen!\u201dA beam of light flew out and freed the shackles from his wrists and ankles. Fortunately, it seems that it could be used for objects as well.Reihausd\u2019s body floated about 15 centimeters then his feet touched the floor. I quickly approached him.Then I heard Daisy\u2019s screaming voice from behind.\u201cBe careful. Saintess!\u201dFeeling something awful, I tried to hide, yet his hand immediately wrapped around my neck.\u201cUgh!\u201dIt was such a strong force that it felt like my breath would be cut off at any moment.The bandage on his eyes came off, revealing his golden eyes full of bloodlust.\u00a0 He was staring at me as if there was nothing in his eyes.\u201cI will\u2026 kill\u2026 you.\u201dI could see Daisy through my fading vision.She shouted at me with all her might.\u201cCamilla kept harassing the High Priest! I heard her voice!\u201dSo\u2026 You mean that I\u2019m mistaken for Camilla right now?Perhaps it\u2019s the power of Bellatrix, the God of Lies, of the two Gods she is with. His strong grip tightened my throat, choking my breath.\u201cHigh Priest. Please stop. Damn it.\u201dDwayne came running from behind.But I had Ciel\u2019s power.I raised my hand and slapped him on the cheek before Dwayne ran up. Then Reihausd\u2019s head turned and his golden eyes shook violently.He let go of me and threw me straight to the ground.[The God of Art, Mond, is shocked as his hands tremble.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, is satisfied with the powerful power.]Fortunately, I could now control the power of the blessing that had been upgraded once in the mine.\u2018Otherwise, I might have sent Reihausd to the God of Death with my own hands.\u2019I could feel Dwayne, who couldn\u2019t believe that I, who looked weak, threw Reihausd with tremendous force, stood tall.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA deep silence fell between us.\u201c\u2026He just fainted.\u201dI hesitated to answer, and Dwayne took two steps back as if he was looking at a monster.Daisy must have been startled, she let out a sound,\u00a0hiccup.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not my power, it\u2019s the power of the Gods?\u201dI spoke in a benevolent and bright tone, yet Dwayne was shivering. With eyes looking at the monster that defeated another monster.\u201cY-You\u2026 are awesome. The same goes with the whip.\u201dNo, I told you I\u2019m not that kind of person.I have more misunderstandings that have to be cleared up again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m a Fake Saint But the Gods are ObsessedCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAnyway, let\u2019s go now. Daisy, can you walk?\u201dDaisy nodded her head.\u201cDwayne. Carry Sir Reihausd on your back.\u201dHe nodded vigorously.\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201dWe retraced the way we came in and exited the underground prison.It seemed like everything was resolved. However\u2026When I came out of the dark basement and stepped outside the building, I heard a voice I hated the most.\u201cStop right now.\u201d\u2018As expected.\u2019I let out a small sigh.She got the perfect timing, just like a ghost.\u201cMiss Ariel. I knew it was you.\u201dI saw Camilla\u2019s face looking at me. And behind her, the Paladins, Heinz and several high-ranking priests were visible.Priests and Paladins of Elium, who had heard the news and ran, were gathering here and there.[The God of Art, Mond, looks at Heinz and frowns.][The God of Justice, Hetuse, is very wary of Camilla.][The God of Benevolence, Oman, spits.]\u201cSir Reihausd is now\u2026\u201dCamilla opened her mouth in a mournful tone as she turned to the people from the temple.\u201cHe is contaminated by Magi\u00a0 and needs to be purified.\u201dI heard people muttering, as if they were confused by Camilla\u2019s words.\u201cLet me help you. Miss Ariel, and Sir Reihausd. But we need all of your help.\u201dShe said, stretching out her hand with dim eyes.\u201cEveryone, please tie Miss Ariel.\u201dAt her words, telling them to arrest me, I saw the shaking eyes of several Paladins. They were hesitating, unable to do anything.It was then.\u201cStop!\u201dA cold voice mixed with bloodlust was heard.The Sword Master\u2019s sword skill could be clearly felt even in a dark prison. A sense of intimidation that strongly oppressed the narrow space. It was Kyle\u2019s appearance.He was followed by about twenty Imperial Knights.Camilla\u2019s eyelashes fluttered.His ferocious voice rang out.\u201cHow dare you leave the Crown Prince, and touch my lover?\u201dEven the Paladins couldn\u2019t come close due to Kyle\u2019s aura, which was spewing out a terrifying bloodlust.Heinz responded politely.\u201cYour Highness the Crown Prince. I apologize, Saintess Ariel has something to share with us. It seems like one, but it\u2019s not a normal situation\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you going to shut her there?\u201dHis gaze was directed to the dark stairway leading to the basement of the building.However, Heinz didn\u2019t care and continued.\u201c\u2026The Saintess is suspected of colluding with the Demon Realm. The High Priest is also out of his mind because he was influenced by the Saintess. In addition to hurting Saintess Camilla, we\u2019re just tying him up because he was trying to hurt himself.\u201dHe really was a smooth talker.\u201cHa.\u201dI snorted.\u201cFor the safety of the Empire, shouldn\u2019t this be something that should be strictly investigated?\u201dHeinz glanced at me and appealed to Kyle.Camilla just stood still and looked at me without saying anything.However, I could see her clenched fists trembling slightly, probably dissatisfied with the way Kyle was protecting me. Unlike her face, which still has a fragile and sorrowful expression.Yet now that I knew her identity, I had nothing to be afraid of or reluctant to do.I heard Kyle\u2019s menacing low voice.\u201cIf the Saintess colluded with the Demon Realm, how can you be sure that I, who was with her, didn\u2019t do that too?\u201dAt that, Heinz gasped.\u201cY-Your Highness! You mean\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you want to investigate her, shouldn\u2019t you do that after I look like that?\u201dKyle\u2019s fingertip pointed at Reihausd, who was messed up and out of his mind on Dwayne\u2019s back.Of course, none of them could answer yes.It was because they knew that even the slightest swing of the sword aura attached to Kyle\u2019s sword would separate their neck and body.\u201cYou\u2019re Camilla, aren\u2019t you. What is your opinion?\u201d\u201c\u2026Your Highness.\u201d\u201cDo you think the scars on his back were also caused by self harm?\u201dCamilla was speechless and looked at the Crown Prince.Feeling the power of the Crown Prince, I opened my mouth leisurely.\u201cThere is something that people here should know about. I suspect that Miss Camilla and Chief Priest Heinz collude with the Demon Realm.\u201dAt my words, the priests murmured loudly. The Paladins also began to whisper while making eye contact with each other.\u201cHow could she help Sir Reihausd in the mine where Magi spewed out, seize the opportunity to enter the temple, and take control of the temple this far in such a short period of time? Isn\u2019t Miss Camilla colluding with the Demon Realm?\u201dSuspicion is repelled by suspicion.\u201cI really doubt it.\u201dAs I put my hand on my chest and spoke with a gloomy face, the murmur of the priests grew louder.Some argued that they should trust me more than Camilla, whom they had only just seen.\u201cSuch nonsense!\u201dWhen it didn\u2019t go the way she thought it would, Camilla screamed at me.\u201cI can\u2019t help but doubt Chief Priest Heinz, who is standing by her now. I know that the Chief Priest was also in Ares.\u201dYet I didn\u2019t care and continued to speak resolutely.I saw Camilla\u2019s eyebrows twitch at my words.\u201cThey said that Sir Reihausd attacked Miss Camilla under the influence of Magi, but what if, on the contrary, he attacked her knowing that she was someone related to the Demon Realm?\u201dAt my words, the Paladins began to murmur.Some of them saw Camilla running out to catch me after I ran away with the statue from Camilla\u2019s room.And many Paladins rushed in and subdued Reihausd, who drew his sword and tried to kill Camilla.\u201cN-Nonsense\u2026!\u201dInterrupting Haines, I calmly continued.\u201cIn other words, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something to be resolved inside the temple since each other\u2019s opinions are different. So, in this matter\u2026\u201dFor a moment, the Paladins were seen to be agitated.I said looking at Kyle.\u201cI request the mediation of the Imperial Palace.\u201dAt those words, Heinz jumped up.\u201cTo think that it\u2019s the mediation of the Imperial Palace! This undermines the independence of the temple\u2026\u201d\u201cChief Priest Heinz. And Miss Camilla.\u201dI looked at them with cold eyes.Staring straight into Camilla\u2019s eyes, I continued.\u201cThere was no holy power confirmation procedure, so you\u2019re not yet a saintess. Even if you took control of the temple, you\u2019re not the owner of this place.\u201dHer eyebrows twitched at my words.\u201cI\u2019m still the saintess of the temple, Ariel. A saintess is the head of the temple and has exclusive decision-making rights, and I, as the Saintess\u2026 Once again, O ask the Imperial Palace for fair mediation.\u201d[The God of Knowledge, Hessed, applauds loudly.][The God of Destruction, Ciel, wags his tail.]I have never been dismissed or removed from my position as saintess.\u2018It looks like they\u2019re mistaken because I was away for a while\u2026\u2019This is a hive with two queen bees, but the rightful queen with a name was me, not Camilla.\u201cWith the authority of the Crown Prince, I accept the proposal of the Saintess.\u201dI heard Kyle\u2019s voice.Camilla was glaring at me with her fists clenched and pale face.\u2018Camilla. There\u2019s nothing of yours here.\u2019I could have confronted Camilla right away with Kyle\u2019s help.However, the reason for not doing so and returning was to secure legitimacy.If the Imperial Palace and soldiers recklessly pushed into the temple and intervened, the resistance from within the temple would have been severe.If that happened, there was a risk that the neutral priests would also go over to Camilla\u2019s side.Accusations of meddling in the theocracy put Kyle in political danger.I risked the hassle, rescuing Reihausd and Daisy myself.The priests were surprised to see the suffering of the two in the dungeon.This confirmed my suspicions about Camilla and Heinz.At the same time, it caused them to disagree about who was real and who was fake between me and Camilla. It was natural to justify the mediation of the Imperial Palace.The priests on my side were raising their voices.\u201cSaintess. We believed in the Saintess.\u201d\u201cAlthough I was a little shaken when Chief Priest Heinz said it as if the Saintess had run away after colluding with the Demon Realm.\u201d\u201cNow that the Saintess has returned, I believe in the Saintess!\u201dThe game had just begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
