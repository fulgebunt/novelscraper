A kid running around while playing energetically despite below the scorching sun.I can\u2019t be like that kid; I left all my childhood spirit at the elementary school. After having my brain filled with study from cram school in summer, all I want to do now is to go home as soon as possible. When I looked up at the sky tiredly, I saw a lush sky spreading through the gaps between the trees.Even though the blue sky looks so peaceful, recently there have been killing crime happening around this area. The criminal hasn\u2019t caught yet, and the public is still talking about it, enough to reach the ears of a grandpa living in the countryside with only a few channels.I looked back at the security buzzer that Grandpa sent me the other day, which had been remodeled with a roaring sound, in my hand.\u201cToday, mom might be late. What will you do for dinner? Onii-chan, is there anything you want to eat?\u201d\u201cHmm, what to eat? Should we buy something on convenience store?\u201d He asked back with a smile. My proud older brother, who is in the third year of junior high school this year and is aiming to enter the number one elite school in the prefecture, is always cool. His straight black hair is silky, his eyes are beautiful, and he looks like a prince in a picture book.I want to marry my brother in the future. Rather, I only want to marry my brother. That\u2019s how much I love my brother. That\u2019s why I want to study hard from now on and enter the same high school as my brother next year!\u201cThen, let\u2019s cook! Let\u2019s eat curry!\u201dI pulled my brother\u2019s arm and walk along the paved road that surrounds a large pond. It\u2019s almost our house.\u201cWanna drink water? You are sweating, you will get heat stroke, Mai.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine~ I\u2019m fine~!\u201dMy brother offered me a towel as I looked at the pond. Back when I\u2019m still in elementary school, he will wipe my face, but now I received the towel with a \u201cthank you\u201d and wiped my forehead myself.\u201cIt\u2019s still hot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cAh, are you going to buy ice cream? Are we going to take a detour? Do you want to eat ice cream, Onii-chan?\u201dI pointed towards the city. Trees that are about to reach the sky come into view. This is a great spot for catching insects, and when I was in elementary school, I caught insects here and gave them as gifts to my brother.My brother loves living creatures and was very happy to collect it. As I reminisced the old days, I noticed something reflected in the light.\u201cOh, it\u2019s a spider.\u201dThere was a spider web a little higher than me. It seems that it was the spider\u2019s thread that was shining. A large spider in the center of the nest spitting out threads while turning its body. The nest swayed by the wind reflects the glittering light and it is very beautiful. When I was looking at it, a beautiful butterfly flew from somewhere.Butterflies with red, yellow, and black colors spot, as thin as origami, approaches the nest and tries to fly away.When the wings hit the nest, the movement became faster. Every time the butterfly\u2019s wings blink, the thread gets entangled and slows it down. Eventually the butterflies were completely stuck.\u201cAh, the butterfly\u2026\u201dThe spider came close to the butterfly. It moves its slender legs up and down to hold the wings of the butterfly. At this rate, the butterfly will be eaten by spider.\u201cHey, that\u2026\u201dWhen I turned my face to my brother, I couldn\u2019t let out my voice. My heart is beating loudly, and I feel like time has stopped. I couldn\u2019t even hear any of the annoying cicada\u2019s sound.My brother is just looking up at the nest. He didn\u2019t seem to be interested in anything. When I stare at his eyes, he seems wanting to say, \u2018isn\u2019t it good?\u2019.A pitch-black, like dark night eyes that seem to have given up everything. As I look closer, for a moment, my brother\u2019s face was replaced into a face of manga character, bright red with blood.I took a step back. The sounds of cicadas were gone, instead I heard a lot of people screaming, and images flowed into my head.A bright red school corridor, a kitchen knife that shines sharply in the light of the moon, and my older brother who laughs quietly in the center. His eyes are terribly hollow and there is no light.A girl in pajama turning over pages of manga depicting such scene. She continued reading the manga with awe. On the next page, my brother talks about killing with excitement. When the girl turned the page again, my brother drawn on the double-page spread was about to run straight.In the next frame, a lot of blood spouts from his chest like a fountain. Eventually, he closed his eyes quietly in the pitch-black corridor. The girl in pajama who reads such manga mutters \u201cehhh\u2026\u201d and drops her shoulders.Those images spinning around inside my head.\u201cMai?\u201dMy brother shook my shoulders and my mind snapped. The older brother standing in front of me isn\u2019t covered in blood at all, and this is park, not school. Just now, a dream\u2026? What was that.\u201cNothing. It\u2019s okay\u2026\u201dI must calm myself. I looked up to see my brother\u2019s face and\u2015\u2015 I became speechless.Ah.This is bad.My beloved older brother is that Kurobe-kun\u2026 no\u2026. the super psychopath murderer, Kurobe Makoto.\u25c7\u201cMai, have you woken up?\u201dWhen I opened my eyes in surprise, my brother entered my field of vision. I wonder why I\u2019m sleeping in my room\u2026 I\u2019m sure I was in the park before\u2026\u201cOnii-chan\u2026\u201d\u201cI was worried. You suddenly collapsed in the park. I will contact mom.\u201dMy brother stood up. He looked at my face and told me to \u201crest well\u201d while smiling. As we always get along, I smiled back and saw him off.After waiting for the door to close properly and the footsteps of my brother gradually went silent, my mouth opened in reflex. Before I knew it, my hands trembled, and my breathing became rough. It\u2019s not a symptom of heat stroke. It\u2019s completely horror derived feeling. A pure horror.\u201cHe is really that Kurobe Makoto\u2026\u201dTo put it in words, I couldn\u2019t stand the reality in front of me and rubbed my arms. The scene I saw earlier\u2026 That was me in the previous life. Because I remember dying when I was a high school girl.Since I was a child, I was weak and prone to illness. The only fun I could get in the hospital was manga.\u2018Goodbye Heaven, Good Morning Hell\u2019 was the manga that gave me emotional support. I told myself I will not die until I read the final chapter.Commonly known as \u2018Sayo Jigoku\u2019/\u2018Good-Hell\u2019. The story is about first-year high school students in a certain class being trapped in a school where the internet was cut off from July 29th\u00a0to 31st\u00a0and being involved in a death game held by a mysterious organizer.They must complete tasks, one after another, such as solving quizzes and treasure hunting mysteries. If they cannot complete the task, they will die\u2026Furthermore, to balance the variety of individual abilities such as academic and athletic ability, there was a recommended task to defeat each other. If you clear the task, you will get a kitchen knife and a modified plastic gun, so you can voluntarily reduce the number of participants.The strategy they use were to \u2018get everyone together in one classroom peacefully and wait for help\u2019. Originally, they all were gathered in high school to hold a test of courage, with hidden motive to maintain good relationship with each other.But the situation turned into unexpected way. As if to crush such pure-intention strategy, the corpse of Kurobe-kun, the class president who did not appear even at the meeting time on the day despite being the organizer of the test, was found.The corpse looks like a doll that has been torn with scissors, like a rag cloth that has been tattered and put in the washing machine and spun continuously for 20 hours. When the students were in panic, the mysterious organizer said in a broadcast,\u00a0\u201cIt was someone in this class who killed the class president. There is a murderer in this class who is dying to kill people.\u201dA corpse that suddenly appeared in a confined space. Moreover, it is a corpse of an acquaintance. The game starts with all the students fall into suspicion. Naturally, on every chapter, someone dies. In that terrible situation, readers cheer for their favorite characters and are delighted with the weekly serialization.As far as it goes, there was a protagonist, Tanaka Hiroshi, and the heroine, Himegasaki. But even they were worried about their survival until the final episode.A death game that is the core of such a miserable story. The mastermind behind it is my brother\u2015\u2015Kurobe Makoto.He was excellent from an early age but was attracted to killing creatures. He whimsically pushed his stepsister who is one year younger than him, into a pond and killed small animals and insects. It has become more noticeable since he saw a cat run over by a car and died in the winter of his third year as junior high school.Gradually, the murder urge grew bigger, and he murdered people. Because of the uncontrollable desire to kill the human who desperately struggled to live, a cruel death game was held in the summer of his first-year high school.Disguising his own death, as the game progressed, he whimsically kills his classmates as the mysterious organizer, creating an atmosphere of suspicion. In the end, he killed the survivors and even himself.He was a genuine psychopath that masked his crazy cruelty with perfect appearance, perfect brain, and perfect physical strength, pretending as a person loved by all. In addition, because of his bizarre hobby and murderous urge, it became out of control.And it seems that I reincarnated as that person\u2019s sister.\u201cMai.\u201d\u201cUwaaaa!!\u201dSuddenly I was called out and I accidentally screamed. Looking back in a hurry, my brother stood with sport drink bottle and a glass in a tray.\u201cAh\u2026 O-onii-chan?\u201d\u201cGeez, how many times you want to be surprised by me today?\u201dMy brother looks surprised by my voice, but it just the shell. In the final episode of the manga, one of the classmate survivors said\u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t we friends who enjoyed high school life together? You had fun too with us!\u201d\u00a0And my brother uninterestedly responded\u00a0\u201cAh, I suppose my acting was pretty good.\u201d\u201cHere. Do you need straw?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dMy brother smiled at my reply and poured the sports drink into the glass. Maybe because he\u2019s that Kurobe-kun, even the appearance of him pouring drink felt creepy.Now, I am 14 years old, and my brother is 15 years old. Kurobe-kun in the manga was in the first year of high school, so there is one year left. But his face is completely same. The feeling and the atmosphere also the same with Kurobe-kun in manga.\u201cFrom now on, when we go to the cram school, I\u2019ll bring another water bottle and a parasol. Now that Mai already in junior high school, you need to rehydrate yourself before someone told you.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cGood reply. Mai is a good girl.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI felt that the act of stroking my head, which I was so happy about before, now is threatening to reach my neck next time. As I continued to force smiling, my brother stood up, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll call mother for the time being.\u201d\u201cW-why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told her that Mai collapse from heatstroke. I promised to call if anything happens.\u201dAfter said that, my brother left the room. Maybe he will call from home phone. The sound of the footsteps on stairs going down to the first floor can be heard.What should I do\u2026? What should I do from now on? His face and surname match, and the family structure also completely the same, so the possibility that they are different people are none\u2026?\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs I was trying to find a strand of hope, I suddenly remembered something.When Kurobe confessed his crime in the final chapter, he attached a door and a key to the second row of the bookshelf in the room, where he kept a diary about his murder urge, a kitchen knife, a knife, and an air gun with improved killing performance in a box.He also said that when he was little, he used to collect dead insects and animals. It was also depicted in a flashback scene, that he created a morgue under the porch of the garden.If I check that, I should know if my brother is really that Kurobe-kun. I just fainted with heat stroke, so maybe I\u2019m just hallucinating. The corridor leading from the living room to the garden on the first floor is a blind spot. Now is my chance.I left the room while trying to not make any noise and entered my brother\u2019s room first. When I checked the bookshelf, I found difficult reference books such as statistics along with textbooks of mathematics, science, and tests. My brother often took proficiency test by father\u2019s recommendation, and that\u2019s probably the case. It\u2019s safe.With relief, I descended to the first floor silently and went out to the garden through the back door. Mom\u2019s hobby is gardening, so there are many herbs and seasonal flowers were swaying with the breeze in the garden. There is also 4 chairs nearby which four people can sit. When dad and mom have a day off, we have a barbecue here.No one can guess if there is a morgue at the edge of the garden where we can spend such a family time.Looking at the usual scene, I looked under the porch just like in manga described for a styrofoam box and stretch out my hand behind the box.My middle finger touched something cold, like metal.Although I have a bad feeling, I peeked at it. I found a can of rice crackers, the one that dad often eats. It was heavy when I took out the box.I really have a bad feeling. I tried to think otherwise, it can be soil, or maybe water, or maybe mom put her fertilizers inside. Even if it\u2019s a breeding nest for mosquitoes, it will be much better than a morgue.I resolved myself and opened the box. The first thing that came into view was the countless of needles on pin cushions.\u201cWhy are there needles\u2026 huh?\u201dWhen I took a closer look, it was not needles on pin cushions but insect\u2019s feet. The insects were lying on their backs and laid out, with the feet facing up.Killing insects and lining up their corpses. Deliberately lay it on its back.Cicadas sleep in the soil, maybe my brother protect it during its hibernation because he loves insects. I keep denying because I don\u2019t want to believe it. I tried shaking the box, but the insects didn\u2019t move. I touch it for a moment, and it\u2019s strangely stiff freeze like ice.I took out my hand. It makes me feel sick. When I look closely, I can see some torture evidence here and there.I closed the lid to block the intense sight, put it back neatly as if I haven\u2019t seen it at all, and let out a sigh.No way. My brother\u2026Is completely that \u2018Makoto Kurobe\u2019.\u25c7T/N: Hi, this is Kei of ChocoCats, this is my first translation and I hope you enjoy it.

Until yesterday, I wouldn\u2019t walk if I don\u2019t hold hands with my brother, but from today I can\u2019t.The \u2018Kurobe Mai\u2019 of Sayo Jigoku\u2014manga version of me, has long straight black hair, and although she\u2019s prideful and cold to those around her, she\u2019s very clingy to my brother. In a nutshell, she has a brother complex.I always have a ponytail and my hair isn\u2019t that long. But when I looked at the mirror this morning, my face was the same as Kurobe Mai from the manga, and I also love my brother.But who won\u2019t love it when you were spoiled by a gentle, intelligent, and perfect brother?Actually, he must have calculated this, thinking\u00a0\u201cIf I spoil my sister, everyone will easily think I\u2019m a gentle older brother. She was annoying but also convenient existence, hahaha.\u201dOf course, not knowing there was such a hidden motive behind his act, until yesterday, I loved for my brother to the point I even declared, \u201cI will marry my brother in the future!\u201dKurobe Mai from manga also loved her brother. In the flashback scene of Kurobe-kun\u2019s memories, he said\u00a0\u201cMy dad\u2019s second marriage partner has a daughter who loves me a lot.\u201d\u00a0Now that I think about it, my brother treats his sister only as an object and calls her \u201cthat\u201d in his head. Scary.And when Kurobe-kun held the death game, he killed Mai Kurobe a day before to disguise as his corpse. The gender and appearance are different, but the reader didn\u2019t know who the corpse belonged to until the final volume, as he claimed that there would be no difference between men and women if the body messed up.At this rate, I will be killed and used as my brother\u2019s corpse disguise. I will be like the insects in that box. There is no doubt that the funeral will create a \u2018gruesome\u2019 atmosphere and made my parents cry. Even my friends will cry.Until now, I\u2019ve been trying to follow my brother everywhere, to put it nicely, like a chick chasing a parent bird. But actually, more like a goldfish poop that still cling to its body. I even tried to unlock the toilet before I was caught by mom. (Means she even followed her bro to toilet\u2026 ew)But I won\u2019t do that anymore. If I act just like Kurobe Mai did in manga, I will experience the same thing too, being killed by my beloved brother. At minimum, I still have to greet and answer what I\u2019m asked.\u201cSomehow, Mai feels far today.\u201d\u201cYeah. I want to get stronger so I will distance myself with my brother.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aiming for the top. Like that mountain.\u201d\u201cBut there is no mountain.\u201dMy brother would have wondered why I put some distance from him. But rather than looking lonely because his sister is avoiding him\u2026 his eyes look suspicious toward me.I\u2019m sure that the tragedy will occur even if I keep the distance as it is. It\u2019s just the matter of siblings\u2019 relationship, and my brother wouldn\u2019t even change his mindset because of that.But if I can change his twisted mindset\u2026 If I can change his thought of playing on human life to humanity, I will be able to prevent that tragedy.Even though he will become demonic mastermind killer in the future, my brother currently is not a mass murderer. If possible, I want my brother to be alive and happy. This feeling so far still exists.Kurobe-kun in manga said,\u00a0\u201cIt was boring because nothing unexpected happened.\u201dDon\u2019t kill forty people for such reason!I want to say that. But for my brother, it\u2019s probably big enough for a reason to kill. My brother likes to kill creatures, just as how people enjoy eating delicious food and playing around.Then what should I do? There is only one answer. I just have to take actions that my brother not expected.All I have to do is to provide surprise elements to my brother who seeks the unexpected. By taking unexpected actions, I will show my brother that \u201cthe world you see isn\u2019t that simple\u201d and \u201cthere are a lot of unexpected things.\u201dIt\u2019s about a year before the death game is held. I think it\u2019s better than knowing my brother\u2019s identity the day before the tragedy. By then, I will change my brother\u2019s cruel, intellectual curiosity and rewrite the tragedy into a happy one.However, I can\u2019t tell him that \u201cI know everything you will do\u201d. If I\u2019m too hasty, I will quickly be eliminated as an \u201cannoying person.\u201d Therefore, I should take unexpected actions as much as I can without making my brother realized that I know his true nature.In other words, by giving my brother surprises, I can save the lives his future classmates\u2026 and himself.\u201cOnii-chan, I\u2019ll show you something good!\u201dWhen I said that while approaching the pond, my brother turned to me. Our eyes met but I pretend to not aware. For my brother, this world is boring, and he thinks I\u2019m just an annoying decoration.But that\u2019s fine. From now on it will be different. I will show him that this living decoration is actually full of surprises.\u201cKurobe Mai is going innnnnnnnn!!!\u201dI shouted out loud and raise my hand enthusiastically.The children playing in the park suddenly focused their eyes on me. My brother calls out with a troubled voice, but I don\u2019t care. I kicked up the ground and ran. Then I jumped into the pond, making big splash.\u201cMai!\u201dAs soon as I raised my face to the surface, I heard my brother\u2019s voice. He has a surprised look. My brother in the manga pushed me down playfully, but now he\u2019s surprised when I did it myself. I smiled at what I had done as planned, and when I got out from the pond myself, my brother wiped my head with a towel.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 relieving your stress from exam?\u201d\u201c\u2026What? No, for now, we should go home.\u201dMy brother looks at me with suspicion. But he may just adjust himself from the surprise. My brother is having a boring day, and his sister, whom he tried to push down, jumped in by herself. It will be full of surprises and very entertaining for him. Because of this, he might be having fun inside.Gradually provide surprises to him, make him think it\u2019s more exciting to see his sister than having to hold a death game. I will do whatever it takes for that.\u201cOnii-chan!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI looked straight at my brother. As usual, his eyes so black that I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s inside. But I won\u2019t lose. With my unexpected surprises, I\u2019ll make those eyes gleaming, just like the characters in the shoujo manga I\u2019m reading.To prevent my brother from causing the tragedy next year.\u201cI will do my best!\u201dI clenched my fist strongly and gave my thumb to my brother.\u25c7T/N: hope you enjoy. I will try to update every week if possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After landing on the water, I silently went up, and my brother approached me looking amazed.\u201cMai, why did you do that?\u201d\u201cI want to surprise Onii-chan.\u201dI gave a big smile to my brother who wipes my head with a towel a little roughly. When I open my eyes wide to see, he looks uncomfortable and try to hide it with towel.It\u2019s been about a week since I first jumped into the pond, and this is the 8th\u00a0times I have dived to pond in total.\u201cWell, I\u2019m surprised. But\u2026 isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201dMy brother sighs and grabs my upper arm to help me out of pond.Even though my brother knew that I would dive again, he still took route home that passing the pond. I\u2019m sure he wants to see me diving, because he didn\u2019t seem to report it to our parents, and from the second day of the dive, I\u2019ve been wearing a black T-shirt to prevent see-through, so my diving life is going well.\u201cMai, do you know that jumping into pond is prohibited?\u201d\u201cYeah, I will get into trouble.\u201d\u201cThen why did you do it\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I want to surprise you.\u201dIf I just want to surprise him, there is an option to push my brother off the pond or slide. However, it is dangerous because it will be seen as act of assault. If I jump by myself, even if I\u2019m careless, I am the only one who is in danger. So, I will continue to jump, nothing can stop me.\u201cMore importantly, how was it? It\u2019s a silent dive!\u201dFor the past week, I\u2019ve been jumping into the pond with straight face, and I\u2019ve been regularly diving and rising. It\u2019s all for my brother. But if I keep jumping into the pond as it is, the neighborhood will start think there is a crazy junior high school student, and I will be labeled as suspicious person. That\u2019s why I jumped in with a lot of variations.\u201cIf you ask of my impression.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that a girl in second grade of junior high school will do.\u201dApparently, he didn\u2019t like the silent dive as he has a displeasure face. It can\u2019t be helped. As I started to plan for my next strategy, my brother picked up his smartphone and mumbled \u201cah\u201d.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cToday, dad and mom are coming home early, so maybe the dinner will be a little earlier.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201dMy brother\u2019s real dad\u2026 The father who has a blood connection with this psychopath-brother-of-mine, is kind and easygoing. He is an executive director at a food company. And my real mom is a gentle and quiet person. She\u2019s just scary when she gets angry. She works as an engineer, half at home and half at office.It seems my brother\u2019s dad and my mom met while raising us alone after divorced their former partners. I don\u2019t know who my real dad or my brother\u2019s real mom.\u201cI think we should hurry. You need to change clothes before they came back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAgreeing with my brother, we quickly return home and opened the front door. Then, there was dad and mom who somehow looked sad. Dumbfounded, I turned my head. My brother quietly looked down at me.I have been tricked\u2026?Before I realized it, my mother grabbed me by the arm. She threw me into bathroom, took my bag, and left me inside while closing the bathroom door. I hurriedly washed up and change clothes, and after that mom murmured in a cold voice, \u201cCome to the living room.\u201dI couldn\u2019t go against it. I cautiously sit in a dining chair, mom and dad are sitting in front of me, and my brother is sitting next to me.\u201cMai, I heard you have been doing something strange in the park lately. What is this about?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dMom talked in serious tone. For the past week, I have continued to provide surprises to my brother. It\u2019s in a safe manner so that only my brother would be troubled. I thought my brother wouldn\u2019t report to our parents, but he seemed to be reporting this in detail.\u201cI was so surprised that even after Makoto stopped you, you still jump into the pond everyday\u2026 I wonder is there something troubling you? Is it stress\u2026?\u201dPerhaps, my brother deliberately let me dive 8th\u00a0times so that he can force my parents to take action, because even though he tried to stop her, his sister still jumped 8th\u00a0times.\u201cThe pond in the park belongs to everyone, and it\u2019s not a place to dive. Not only it\u2019s dangerous for you, but other child may imitate you and end up in danger. No matter how shallow it is, they may drown. And above all, the child who really fall into the pond may not be able to get help.\u201d\u201cAlthough Mai-chan may not like it, but from tomorrow you are not allowed to go out. School will start next week, so stay at home quietly until then.\u201dCertainly, the new semester will start next week. I was planning to make a big surprise for the next 7 days, now I have to think of other way.However, perhaps because mom found out I was absent-minded, she called my name \u201cMai.\u201d To give me warning.\u201cI know Mai is not a child who does things with no reason. So, can you tell us the reason?\u201d\u201cYes, if you can tell us, we will end this conversation.\u201dI understand how worried my parents are about me. I want to say out loud that the problem should be on my brother\u2019s side, not me. But if I say it, I will be killed. If I tell them the contents of the morgue in the garden now, the point of the discussion will surely change. I glanced at my brother and found him looking at me with a troubled face. But inside, his eyes still didn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s light.But even if mom and dad denied his taste, it\u2019s impossible for my brother to immediately accept it and change. If it\u2019s that simple, he won\u2019t even kill tens of people. If things go wrong, it will be mom and dad who got killed.\u201cI jumped to pond because it was fun. I just couldn\u2019t control myself\u2026\u201dSo, I could only make excuses like a criminal. And to such daughter, mom and dad just looked at each other.\u25c7T/N: It\u2019s short, but the next chapter will be shorter.

I don\u2019t think she\u2019s smart because she has to study twice than normal people do. But she seems had become crazy after she collapse due to heat stroke.From the next day after she collapsed, she started diving into the pond. She\u2019s originally the daughter of my father\u2019s remarried partner, so we don\u2019t share any blood. And because I met her for first time when I was ten years old, I didn\u2019t know all about her real personality. Was she originally like this?There is another change. Until a while ago, she always followed me while asking, \u201cWhere are you going, Onii-chan?\u201d Even when we became a junior high school student, she still clings into me. I feel like I made a mistake, but if I take good care of her, the people around me would look at me as a \u201cgentle and ordinary brother\u201d. It\u2019s for my own convenient. But now when she saw me, she avoided my eyes and she no longer cling to me.When I saw her jumped into the pond in the park, I always thought she wanted to die, but she seemed to be careful not to die. Is she crazy, or is this a new type of self-harm?I\u2019m not sure if she jumped in for another reason, but I don\u2019t want to know. I have no interest.When my sister was small, I was wondering what would happen if I pushed her down when I saw her looking into the pond in the park.But when I actually saw my sister fall, I didn\u2019t think of anything. Maybe it was partly because she has become second year of junior high school and the death rate is lower than in her childhood. But somehow, I was disappointed.I was hoping it would be a little more interesting. Was it because she still alive?After thinking about my sister\u2019s eccentricity, I went down to the garden. It\u2019s a full moon tonight, so I don\u2019t need a flashlight. Relying on the moonlight, I took out the box hidden behind the porch and pinched it with the tweezers I had in my pocket.I pull out the legs as if I\u2019m pulling a thread. The insects were wriggling and eventually stopped moving. If I poke it with tweezers a little, its legs will move weakly, and I will feel refreshed.I haven\u2019t been interested in anything since I was a kindergarten. But one time I tried to kill insects and realized that it was very pleasant to see what had been alive and moving until a while ago, being hurt and died after some struggling.So, every time Mai brought insects that she had caught in kindergarten to me, I stored them in a box and killed them. But lately Mai just jumps into the pond, and I don\u2019t have time to catch any creatures. It\u2019s unpleasant.I was thinking to make it look like an accident for a moment, but I failed once, so I decided not to, and went to a family meeting. Because of that, Mai is grounded and I\u2019m free for a week until the end of summer vacation.\u201cI want to kill something bigger\u2026\u201dSomething like dog, or a cat.For now, I only handle palm-sized things, so I would like to touch something that fits in both hands.How about Mai? If I drown her in the pond, I can make it looks like an accident. I wonder if it would be difficult to break her apart.While feeling disappointed, I played with the insects for a while, put them back, and closed the box.\u25c7T/N: It\u2019s really short, not even 1k words. I will post 2 chapters at once if the chapters are short (like this).As I have a full time job and my only time to translate is Saturday, so I decided to update every Sunday\u00a0at 12pm\u00a0UTC+9 , I can\u2019t promise the time, but I will always make sure to update once a week (Sunday or if I\u2019m really late, Sunday evening), sorry.Hope you enjoy and see you next week!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Me and other students are in the gymnasium while the principal greets the opening ceremony on the stage. But no one is listening, a student standing behind me is copying someone\u2019s homework, and in the next class row, a student who traveled abroad handed out souvenirs.The principal was asking if anyone remembers what he said before the summer vacation, but probably no one remembers it.While as for me, I\u2019m currently telling my friend Yukari what I did to my brother during summer vacation.I thought she would enjoy the story, but when she heard about my domino\u2019s construction, she turned pale.\u201cMai-chan\u2026 do you hate your brother?\u201dYukari\u2019s curly hair shook as she tilted her head. Her white skin and lovely face make her look like a doll.\u201cNo. I want to please my brother.\u201d\u201cWhat, he\u2019ll misunderstood you\u2026 It\u2019s obviously looks like you are disturbing him by to putting dominoes all over his room.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not domino every day. I\u2019ve devised so that my brother won\u2019t get bored. I also did\u00a0mokugyo\u00a0(*wooden fish bell) and bungee.\u201d\u00a0(*see T/N at end of post)After my parents banned me from going out, I still continued to provide surprises during the last week of summer vacation. On the first day, I made a domino using the whole house stuff, and on the next day, I made a maze with cardboard. On the third day, I dug a big hole. I thought I\u2019d dig a pitfall, but no matter how perfect I made it, it\u2019s still dangerous. That\u2019s why I make the appearance obvious.\u201cIt\u2019s not an answer\u2026 And the\u00a0mokugyo, is the one my father always use, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it very noisy\u2026? By the way, I remember my father said Mai-chan came to my place, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cYup! I was given the old one!\u201dYukari\u2019s house is a temple, and her father is a monk. I want to surprise my brother by suddenly make the sound of a\u00a0mokugyo\u00a0at home. So, I sneaked out of the house, went to Yukari-chan\u2019s house, and borrowed a\u00a0mokugyo. Then he gave me an old\u00a0mokugyo, so I bundled three sticks to make the sound louder than usual and rang them in my brother\u2019s room.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother your neighborhood? Didn\u2019t your mother scold you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay! I made a perfect soundproofing.\u201d\u201cThen, what is bungee\u2026?\u201dOn the fifth day, I made a bungee jump from the balcony on the second floor toward my brother in the garden. I\u2019ve calculated it to make sure that I won\u2019t hit my brother. And, although it may sound impossible, I have properly determined the position where my brother will be, and I will not collide even if he comes in for help.Then, after receiving my brother\u2019s attention, I pretended to return to my room and went down to the first floor. I paint my face with colorful pen and climbed the house\u2019s pipe towards second floor balcony where my brother was.\u201cWell, bungee is a bungee. And because of that, I spent my last day of summer vacation helping my mom all day\u2026\u201d\u201cSo yesterday, your parents finally get angry\u2026 If it was my brother, my hair will be cut bald\u2026\u201dYesterday, the seventh day, my parents found out about everything I did. I promised I wouldn\u2019t do it anymore, but all I wouldn\u2019t do was dominoes, mazes, bungee,\u00a0mokugyo, face paint, and climbing pipe. I can still do other things.\u201cOh, it\u2019s my brother.\u201dAfter the principal\u2019s long speech, it was the student council president\u2019s turn. Although he is a psychopath, my excellent and friendly brother has been chosen as student representative based on majority votes at student council election.\u201cMy name is Kurobe Makoto, and I\u2019m the student council president.\u201dAs my brother stood in front of microphone in the same place where the principal was standing, everyone who wasn\u2019t listening to the principal before starts to turn their attention to my brother. Even the student who was doing his homework in rush also raised his face even though he wouldn\u2019t make it in time if he didn\u2019t move his hands.\u201cThe summer vacation in August has ended, and it\u2019s already September. Straight to the topic, there is an announcement from the student council. At the beginning of October, there is a yearly reading session at the kindergarten. Students who want to participate please register to the student council committees or attend today\u2019s after-school meeting.\u201dIn this school, the student committees are obliged to join every volunteer activity. Since not everyone wants to do it, so the school only made students who are enthusiastic enough to be committee members. My brother, who has been in the student council since last year, often left home to volunteer.\u201cThen, Mai-chan will also participate on this year reading session?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI\u2019ve never dreamed that my brother was a psychopath, so I joined the student council while saying, \u201cI want to do it together with Onii-chan!\u201d And that\u2019s how I got the position as vice president. Even though I plan to use the time after school to prepare next surprises, but seems in September, I will be busy with reading session preparation.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to stay after school for reading session\u2026\u201d\u201cI can help with illustrations, but to read out loud, that\u2019s impossible for me\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, can I call you if I have to draw something, Yukari-chan?\u201dYukari laughed at my question while saying, \u201cof course.\u201d A good friend is such a blessing. Thank you, Yukari-chan. While feeling grateful, my brother eventually finished his explanation and returned to his class row.Even though the introduction of the intern teachers has started in turn, everyone around me started to spend their time freely. The student who had been staring at my brother until a while ago, has resumed copying his homework. After all, my brother\u2019s charisma is terrifying. He has excellent grades and can interact with anyone without any distinction. I think there are many things that I yearn for my brother.In manga, when he is in the first year of high school, he caused a tragedy, kills people, and died. But if he lives without causing any tragedy, he actually may become a great person. While imagining my brother\u2019s future vaguely, the opening ceremony has ended.\u25c7In the end, my prediction was right. The reading schedule paper distributed at the student council meeting stated that they would meet three times a week after school for reading session practice.While listening to the explanation of my brother standing in front of me, I try to not let out any disappointed voice. On the side of the classroom, next to Mibuchi-sensei, an adviser of student council, there was a teacher named Nojima. She was introduced at the opening ceremony. Mibuchi-sensei is an old teacher who is called grandpa by everyone, and Nojima-sensei who came as intern is a youthful woman.When I was looking at the two-contrasting people, I was struck by a mechanical pencil from the side. Looking back, Iwai, who is the student council\u2019s treasure from the next class, looked suspiciously at me.\u201cWhat happened to you today? Are you a doppelganger or something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you always crazy about your brother? You look so listless today.\u201dAs I heard Iwai\u2019s words, I unconsciously nod. Certainly, I was so crazy for my brother until before summer vacation. I was following \u201cOnii-chan\u201d both on-school and off-school. But the days of longing for my brother are now over.if I follow him around like before, I\u2019ll end up at the funeral in such a terrible state as if my body was put in a blender. From now on, it\u2019s time to keep a proper distance and provide surprises instead of amiability.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of summer.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou there, I\u2019m explaining now, so please be quiet.\u201dMy brother immediately warned me. I feel angry to Iwai. What if this puts stress on my brother and I get into the blender earlier than planned? When I protested to Iwai with my eyes, he looks sorry. When I regained my composure and listened to my brother\u2019s explanation, Nojima-sensei, who stood on the wall on the side of the class, raised her hand while saying, \u201ca moment please\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, why don\u2019t you do something a little different this year? It\u2019s boring if it\u2019s always the same every year. I think it\u2019s better to try something new someday.\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of it for a moment, but you see, isn\u2019t this something that everyone can decide by exchanging opinions? There is still plenty of time, right?\u201d\u00a0(Oh, I hate this kind of person personally lol)\u201cI see.\u201d My brother gave a short reply to Nojima-sensei\u2019s words and turn his face to me.\u201cEvery year we only read aloud, so this time we are going to try something new. Anyone has ideas?\u201dAfter thinking about the troubling question from my brother, everyone starts to raise their hands. After hearing opinions like \u201cdrama-like reading\u201d and \u201cadding sound effects\u201d, Nojima-sensei\u2019s face becomes cloudy.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too ordinary?\u201d\u201cThen, what should we do\u2026?\u201d\u201cMore like, making everyone surprised? Is there something exciting?\u201dThen, opinions begin to appear again. But Nojima-sensei doesn\u2019t look satisfied with that.\u201cLet\u2019s get more motivated! If we all think about it together, we should come up with some good ideas!\u201dNojima-sensei\u2019s words made everyone, including my brother, feel frustrated. I also feel a little annoyed by her. My brother turned around to me with a face as if thinking \u2018just complaining without giving any suggestions, what does she want from us?\u2019\u00a0(I gotta say this Mai really know her bro from inside out lol)\u201cMai, do you have any suggestion?\u201dSuddenly, the topic turned, and I stand up with too much momentum in shock. My brother wasn\u2019t surprised and was looking at me with an expectation.For the last two weeks of the end of the summer vacation, I have provided many surprises such as diving into the pond, dominoes, and mazes. So, I may seem like a ray of hope. Or maybe because I\u2019ve done strange things, so at these times, my creativity can be useful.\u201cMa-maybe, trick art?\u201dWhen I said so in distress, Nojima-sensei\u2019s face brightened while saying, \u201cthat sounds good\u201d. When I looked at Mibuchi-sensei anxiously, he just smiles softly. My brother nodded and said, \u201cthen, let\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s start the preparation from now on. That\u2019s it for toda\u2013\u201d\u201cWait a minute!\u201dNojima-sensei interrupts my brother\u2019s words and with a smile, \u201clet\u2019s make a good reading that everyone has never seen.\u201dIs it really necessary to interrupt the speech? All the committees of the student council seem to be wondering and somehow there is an awkward silence. In the end, everyone is disbanded with an indescribable feeling.\u25c7After the setting sun has set and the orange light has gradually weakened, I\u2019m going home with my brother holding my upper arm. We are going home together because the serial killer in the neighborhood hasn\u2019t been caught, but my brother grabbing my arm while walking is to make sure I don\u2019t jump into pond. In short, it\u2019s an escort.After the family meeting, my mother seems often asked my brother to watch over me. But my brother has no sign of watching me. He basically left me alone and didn\u2019t even tell mom if I\u2019m messing around or doing carpentry with a hammer in the room. He\u2019s not being careful.But that doesn\u2019t mean my brother doesn\u2019t watch me at all. When our parents are around, he will reluctantly monitor me. So, he watches only when there are our parents around and won\u2019t watch when our parents not around.If you think normally, it should be done oppositely. But for my brother, it\u2019s maybe because he thinks our parents are nosy. I\u2019m sure today, if I jump into the pond and got my clothes wet, our parents will doubt his surveillance ability.Looking back on what happened at the reading meeting today, I called out to my brother.\u201cIt was hard today, Onii-chan.\u201d\u201c\u2026You mean, Nojima-sensei?\u201d\u201cYes. I can\u2019t get along with that teacher.\u201d\u201cWell, isn\u2019t everyone like that? There\u2019s no student who goes well with that kind of teacher, right?\u201dMy brother seems to be annoyed too. If he had awaked as psychopath\u2026 who witnessed the cat being run over after winter. Nojima-sensei might be the first person to be found dead on the next day. As I walked through the park as usual on the road surrounding the pond, I noticed something and pulled my brother\u2019s hand back.\u201cOnii-chan, I think we shouldn\u2019t take shortcut in the dark.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s already dark?\u201dWhen I passed here during the summer vacation, there were people in the park and the sky was bright, so it was fine. But now it\u2019s pitch black, and the outdoor lights installed at regular intervals just illuminate us unreliably. The shadows of the trees are black, and the outlines of the leaves are vague.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cBut what if we suddenly get stabbed in the dark? Because the criminal hasn\u2019t been caught yet.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t sometimes people suddenly get stabbed because they changed route?\u201dMy brother suddenly laughs while he teases me. Perhaps, the reason why his sense of crisis so weak is, because my brother is the real culprit?However, as far as I know from the news, it was said as an impulsive crime\u2026 And there are quite a few witnesses, so I think it\u2019s different person\u2026\u201cThen, if I get killed, I\u2019ll blame on you, Onii-chan.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dMy brother\u2019s laughter still sounds like he\u2019s really having fun. I hope what he found fun from the bottom of his heart changed, other than murder, if possible. For example, alternating killing intent into cutting tuna. It\u2019s delicious too.Like usual, my brother holds my arm and escorted me home.\u25c7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they were waiting for the class representative in the classroom, the broadcast suddenly started, a machine voice was heard saying \u201cGood morning, it\u2019s hell time\u201d, and that\u2019s the beginning of bloody death game.At this rate, that tragedy will come in the summer a year later. I have to stop it. That\u2019s why, to be honest I don\u2019t want to work as a committee member anymore, but it seems that I can\u2019t escape.\u201cAh, right on time. Kurobe-san, if you\u2019re free, shall we talk about the reading session?\u201dDuring the break, Nojima-sensei came to me when I was preparing a surprise in my brother\u2019s classroom. My brother\u2019s class was in the science room, so I thought it\u2019s an opportunity because there is no one in the classroom right now.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have something to do\u2026\u201dWhen I said so, Nojima-sensei made an unpleasant face. She\u2019s being too blatant; I wish she stops. But I don\u2019t have time here, I would like to refrain from overtime school council\u2019s activities.The hurdles to provide surprises for my brother have increased as the council\u2019s activities takes most of my time after school.So, in the morning, I went to school with a cushion on my shoes that squeaks whenever I walk and tied my shoelaces in a strange way. I also keep providing surprises at school by inserting a continued grand adventure story into my brother\u2019s textbook. At first glance it looks like terrible scribbles on my brother\u2019s textbook, but in fact it\u2019s just a transparent film placed on the paper to protect the textbook.And today I prepared a foldable surprise card. When my brother opens it, he will see the trees and mountains that appear in the story that he is doing in class. It\u2019s sounds simple, but it must be surprising to see the same scenery as the story as he reads pops out.However, Nojima-sensei took my masterpiece card and said, \u201cwhat\u2019s this?!\u201d\u201cDid Kurobe-san make this?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. If you\u2019re this good, I\u2019m sure you can make something great for reading session!\u201dI have no intention of showing this quality at the reading session. There is a difference between the lives of thirty-eight people who will become my brother\u2019s classmates in the future and the enthusiasm directed at school events.\u201cBut why is Kurobe-san here? This is the third-grade class, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026I was going to surprise my brother\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my, you are already a junior high school student, you shouldn\u2019t do such childish thing. Ah, then, can you lend that card to me?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhat does she mean about \u2018then\u2019? It\u2019s not even relevant. But Nojima-sensei keep pestering me while getting closer.\u201cAfter all, you can always give it to your brother any other time, right? I want to use this as reference for reading session! I\u2019m sure everyone in the kindergarten will be happy.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cWill you?\u201dNojima-sensei kept asking me many times. Even though she is already a female college student, she acts like a kindergarten student. However, there seems to be no sign of giving back my card and her pressure is strong. When I nodded reluctantly, Nojima-sensei said,\u201cOh, it feels like I\u2019m a thief. I don\u2019t want Kurobe-san to look sad!\u201d\u00a0(But you act like thief\u2026)I was very disgusted by sensei\u2019s acting voice. How did Kurobe Mai in the manga interact with Nojima-sensei? No, Kurobe Mai doesn\u2019t meet Nojima-sensei here because she wouldn\u2019t insert a surprise card into her brother classroom in the first place. She\u2019s a cool girl so she\u2019s likely to leave while saying nothing.\u201cUh\u2026 Then, here.\u201dWhen I gave up, sensei shouted, \u201cYeay!\u201d. I feel so weak that I left my brother\u2019s classroom immediately.\u25c7\u201cMai-chan? What happened? Did the surprise failed\u2026?\u201dI return to my classroom and sit at Yukari-chan\u2019s desk in the front row with a bang, which made Yukari-chan shook her body in a surprise. I let out a shriek and she immediately stop shaking.\u201cThe card was taken by Nojima-sensei.\u201d\u201cWas it something you shouldn\u2019t bring to school?\u201d\u201cNo. She said she wants to use it as a reference for the reading session\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like I can stand with that teacher anymore\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you so in the morning\u2026\u201dYukari-chan is always a little slow, but it\u2019s not particularly frustrating. Maybe it\u2019s because she is not arrogant. She is just too kind to the extent that she also slows to act.But even Yukari-chan seems to be fed up with Nojima-sensei\u2019s antics.If you spend a day with Nojima-sensei in a room together, even a kind person can become Kurobe Makoto. (what a great comparison lol)\u201cI also hate her. I thought I was the only one who dislike her.\u201dA voice comes from above. Iwai, the owner of the voice, was standing right behind me. When I raised my face too see, my head hit his chin and he screamed, \u201cOw, oi!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry Iwai\u2026 Did I hit your teeth?\u201d\u201cYou should worry about me, not just my teeth\u2026 Ouch\u2026\u201dIt seems to have hurt a lot because Iwai is still holding his chin. The three of us used to attend the same elementary school together and were in the same class until last year. But, at second-grade, Iwai was separated to class next to mine and Yukari-chan. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not surprising if he\u2019s at my class now. When we were waiting for him to talk, Iwai glanced at me and stood beside me.\u201cThat intern teacher, you see\u2026 It seems like she will be in this school for 2 months.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201dYukari-chan was shocked again by my loud voice. While feeling sorry, I patted her back and ask Iwai.\u201cWa-was last year intern teacher also only stay for 2 months\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, but because the teacher still a college student, so there are times he\u2019s absent. But to sum up, he only stays for 2 months.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, it was around 3 months for the intern teacher that came to my brother\u2019s class. It seems if you get enough credit, there are days when you don\u2019t have to go to college\u2026 My brother liked that person, so I think it\u2019s probably right\u2026\u201dYukari-chan has an older brother who is a high school student. He wants to be a member of musical band, so he doesn\u2019t want to take over the temple. He always wears a strange shirt with text \u201cYes Life!\u201d. He\u2019s quite famous at street who always fights with his father loudly.And since he graduated from this junior high school, his information must be true.Even so, will Nojima-sensei be in this school for 2 months? She didn\u2019t appear in the flashback scene of the manga, but I think she is a good target for my brother to kill. It seems like there are plans to kill that teacher under stress before seeing the cat die.The bell rang when I was deep in thought. Although I\u2019m worried, I leave Yukari-chan\u2019s desk and went back to my seat.\u25c7On the evening, I returned home with my brother as usual without a student council activity. As soon as I washed my hands, I went straight to the fridge. The heat outside is still over 30oC, so with a round trip between home and school, I might dry out and die.My brother nodded when I asked if he would drink barley tea. I took two glasses off the shelf while thinking it would be surprising if I gave him soy sauce diluted in water. But I think it will affect his eating habits in the future, so I stopped myself.\u201cOh, both of you are early today.\u201dMy mother came into the living room just after I poured barley tea for two people. She has an empty glass in her hand. She approached me and smiled while saying \u201cthank you\u201d when I poured her barley tea.\u201cBy the way, I have something to ask, Mom.\u201dMy brother asks mother. What on earth would my brother ask? If he asked to buy a saw, I\u2019d like to prevent it as much as possible.\u201cWhat is it? Something you don\u2019t understand in your study?\u201d\u201cActually\u2026 I want to borrow a camera. The one that can be connected to a computer.\u201d\u201cCamera? Why? Is smartphone not enough?\u201d\u201cI want to see each classmate\u2019s faces when playing games in class. Also, it seems that it will take a lot of time for the student council\u2019s work, and I can\u2019t stay late because the murderer hasn\u2019t been caught yet. With that, we can still hold the meeting.\u201d\u00a0(T/N: Tbh, it doesn\u2019t make any sense, but I assume the camera can be used as webcam too)\u201cOkay then\u2026 But do you know how to operate it?\u201d\u201cI learned it at school so, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s rechargeable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMy mom and brother left the living room. Don\u2019t tell me, he will use my mom\u2019s spare camera for the next year\u2019s death game \u2026? I thought so, but the high school which he will attend, the venue for death game, is an elite school that even the windows are unbreakable tempered glass, and the door locks are all managed online instead of keys. There will be not much to do with a single camera. I think it\u2019s different from my recollection about the equipments that will be purchased two weeks before the death game was held.However, when I think about it again, during the death game, Kurobe-kun had considerable skills such as jamming radio waves so that no one could not use their smartphones and hacking school security locks.When I read the manga, I thought it was because he\u2019s the last boss. But now I think about it, he must be influenced by my mom. My mom is an engineer who works for an internet security company. Dad is an executive director for a food factory, but his hobby is doing crafts and he has dexterous hands. The highly lethal trap shown in the manga is surely inherited from dad.When it comes to that, is it better to not give too much technology, right\u2026? No, my brother is quick-witted after all. We can\u2019t stay together all the time, and I think it\u2019s better to put more efforts into providing surprises.I finished my drink and went upstairs to do my best.\u25c7About 50% of my life is about providing my brother surprises. Even though I pretended to dive into pond spontaneously, actually I practiced diving every night in bed except for the first time I jumped. For the dominoes, I have to line up dominoes, not to mention digging holes, and even building a pyramid with playing cards to fill the room requires a lot of preparation.However, I showed it to my brother for a short moment. It\u2019s just in a blink of eye, but I\u2019m spending a lot of time on that moment. Right now, I\u2019m making giant animals out of cardboard, but even though I\u2019ve been working on it since after dinner, I still haven\u2019t finished it.When I looked at the clock, the date had changed. My parents would get angry if I kept the lights on in the room at this late, so I turned off the lights in a hurry.I turn on the flashlight, being careful not to let light leak through the gaps in the door. The head of the giraffe that I had made earlier emerged in the faint lighting. I haven\u2019t made the body yet, so it looks like a dinosaur in fantasy. As I silently glued it, I heard a slight noise from my brother\u2019s room next to my room.I hold my breath for unknown reason, as I feel something has passed in front of my room.After a while, the sound of door locking with a click was heard from the first floor. Looking down from the window, my brother was just about to leave the house and head somewhere.Somehow, I have a bad feeling.He won\u2019t be stabbed by a random killer, right? It wasn\u2019t written in the manga. But it\u2019s dangerous to go out because there is a murder nearby. And even if it\u2019s just probability, I\u2019m still worried if he\u2019s going to kill small animals.My heart is beating fast unpleasantly. I should be breathing properly, but I feel uncomfortable while inhaling warm breaths.I stared nervously at the gate in front of the front door, and after a while my brother came back with a white plastic bag. I was relieved, but now I\u2019m worried what my brother might have killed.I stepped away from the window for now and tried to stay still. However, the door opens with an unpleasant noise.\u201cYou are still awake, Mai.\u201dMy brother, who opened the door, enters my room with a plastic bag in his hand. His face, which emerges from the flashlight, looks calm and innocent, but it feels even more frightening.\u201cI have something good.\u201dI don\u2019t want to know the contents of a plastic bag that makes a small noise. But my brother smiled and thrust his hand into the bag. He pulled out something and pushed it on my face.I feel something cold on my cheeks. It was wet with drops of water. Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t smell like iron, and it\u2019s much more inorganic and harder than meat.\u201cIce?\u201dIf it\u2019s dry ice, I\u2019m sure my cheeks are numb by now. But it has a smooth feeling peculiar to plastic bags, and this is probably the stick ice cream I always eat.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, so I bought it. Let\u2019s eat together.\u201dMy brother also took his share out of the plastic bag. He carefully opened the seal and licked it.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret from mom and dad.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you\u2026 But was that fine?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there something like random killer?\u201d\u201cAhaha, Mai is always worried about that huh. Don\u2019t worry, the fingerprints are found everywhere, I saw in the news, the culprit will be caught in no time.\u201dAt this rate, my brother will surely kill his classmates. On the other hand, he will die from kitchen knife. I nibble the ice cream while feeling sullen thinking about that.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I bought the nicest one after all.\u201dMy brother often got extra pocket money from the relatives for his good grades, so he carries more money than me. Also, because he\u2019s only interested with killing things, he never uses his pocket money for games or toys like a normal teenager do. In short, he\u2019s rich.And in the future, with the money he saved, my brother will buy a crossbow, a modified rifle gun, prepared a kitchen knife, and hold a death game.I ate my ice cream with my brother in the dark, somehow feeling complicated.\u25c7T/N: It\u2019s long and I know it\u2019s not an excuse for being late\u2026 I\u2019m struggling adjusting my own schedule as my full-time work always change schedules recently.\u00a0more excuses, yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I will try double post when I have more free time. Anyway, I\u2019m really having fun translating this so, once again, I will not drop this novel. It just\u2026 maybe I will post late if I\u2019m busy with my IRL.For next week, it will be double chapter.Stay tune and see you next week!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because since then, my brother has repeatedly gone out late at night and asked me to eat ice cream together.While working for reading session preparation at school, I glanced at my brother. My brother used a ruler to draw a picture so that it would appear to pop out. At the teacher\u2019s desk, Nojima-sensei pinned my surprise card on the blackboard and said, \u201cLet\u2019s all do our best!\u201d while smiling.Since then, most of student council meetings have been devoted to produce picture-story shows. Although the public order in present time is not safe and we can\u2019t stay late after school, Nojima-sensei still finding many excuses to make us do more work. This time, she said, \u201clet\u2019s focus on creating the best trick art and paper cut-out!\u201dIn addition, probably because my surprise card became the example, the quality required is extremely high. My card is just a postcard size, but the story drawn into pictures was made from two drawing papers. The production time supposedly much longer, but for some reason Nojima-sensei heard that I took only one day to finish my surprise card and was enthusiastic that it would be finished sooner if everyone did it.I think this situation is the worst. It\u2019s already been less than two weeks before the reading session, and the atmosphere is getting worse. At first, my brother was trying to improve the mood, but lately he was just trying to work with a tired face.\u201cSay, do you really think we will have a reading session?\u201dAs I painted the background of the picture-story, Iwai asked from the side. He approached me while confirming that Nojima-sensei is helping the second grader\u2019s paint.\u201cMy mom kept asking, the criminal hasn\u2019t been caught yet, what does the school thinking keeping the school open.\u201d\u201cMine too.\u201dMy parents are also worried about the reading session. Even though the one I worry the most is my brother, there is still no sign of finding the criminal of the serial murders that are happening around here.The crimes themselves seem to be concentrated in the evenings and nights. It\u2019s not like I was told every day that, \u201cit\u2019s still on news broadcast, so going to reading session is dangerous!\u201d but I\u2019m more worried if it\u2019s okay as it is.It wasn\u2019t told in the manga, but I have an unpleasant role to be the messed-up corpse by my brother next year. And my brother has the worst role as the person who held the death game for his classmate.That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll die by then\u2026 But recently my brother pretended to be an ice-loving glutton, saying, \u201cI want to eat ice cream,\u201d and went out in the middle of the night doing strange things.\u201cHey, over there, don\u2019t chit chat. And Mai-chan, if Mai-chan doesn\u2019t do her best, sensei will feel troubled.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell, Mai-chan is so good at making cards, but you won\u2019t continue working. Even though sensei thought Mai-chan could do better that this\u2026\u201dNojima-sensei dropped her shoulder in disappointment. Even if she said that, it\u2019s still troublesome. I\u2019m not an art craftsman.I want to do a reading session properly, but there is a death game. The lives of about 40 classmates are at stake, and the life of the family involved with those 40 students are still in the hands of my brother. Even if I was told with that enthusiasm, the death game is still the biggest problem\u2026But even if I say it here, sensei will not be convinced and there is no choice but to nod.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. What if Mai-chan do this instead of coloring? Because coloring is too easy you are getting bored, right?\u201dWith that said, Nojima-sensei offered me pieces of drawing papers that had been painted. It\u2019s paper cut-out. It\u2019s not just one sheet, but about ten sheets of drawing papers were placed on my desk while saying, \u201chere, these too\u201d. What the\u2026?\u201cMai-chan should do cutting and clipping instead of coloring. Right, Iwai-kun, can you do the coloring instead?\u201d\u201cEh, me?\u201d\u201cYes, Iwai-kun seems to have fun in coloring, so I thought you really want to do it.\u201dNojima-sensei laughs casually. The amount of paper needs to be cut is not much, but it\u2019s likely won\u2019t be finished on time unless I stay up all night. I glanced to my brother, and he gave me a troubled face. But his eyes are still pitch black.\u201cIwai, what percentage of your desire to do a reading session now?\u201d\u201cNot even a millimeter.\u201dWe sighed. But it was seen by Nojima-sensei and in the end, we have to listen to sensei\u2019s \u2018pitiful\u2019 speech until the end of the council meeting.\u25c7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During the council meeting, Nojima-sensei scolded me because my work did not have any progress. I definitely do not want to cut corners in providing my brother surprises, so I decided to have Yukari help me on weekend. Now there is three people, including Iwai, surrounding the living room desk.In such a dangerous situation, I can\u2019t help feeling burdened with her keep coming to my house. To be exact, it\u2019s because I feel indebted with Yukari-chan\u2019s father, who seems to drive Yukari-chan and Iwai to my house, picked them up at night and return them to home.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it! I already promised to help after all!\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026 Yukari-chan, please tell me if there is something troubling you!\u201d\u201cHehe, actually yesterday my brother was fighting with my father. Today they are still fighting, and I if I stay home, I will have to get angry, and told both of them to stop fighting. So, I\u2019m glad I could come to Mai-chan\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why let\u2019s do our best today?\u201d said Yukari-chan while she tilted her head. My feelings moved with her pure heart.\u201cYukari-chan\u2026!!\u201dAs I and Yukari-chan hugged each other, Iwai made a displeasure voice. \u201cOi,\u201d he called us, \u201cif you don\u2019t move your hands, it will never end.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dAfter replying, we continued working. My brother is taking an online English conversation class in his room today, and it seems that he will join us after that.\u201cBy the way, it seems like the murderer is a man.\u201dAfter a while, Iwai muttered with a tremendous tension. You can see that by watching the news. However, he continued talking as if looking back at the suspicious gaze of me and Yukari-chan.\u201cThe victims are always women. And in addition, he seems to be able to control fireball.\u201d\u201cFireball?\u201d\u201cThe incident happened quite close to us on the other day, right? There is a grandpa nearby, who claim to witness it.\u201dIs there such an unscientific thing? But it\u2019s kind of stupid, and I feel a little less worried that my brother might be involved. There is no such unexpected setting like Makoto Kurobe can control fireball.\u201cOh, there is Yukari-chan and Iwai-kun?\u201dAs I was talking, the living room door opened and my mother who was working in her room came out. Aside from Iwai, Yukari-chan often comes to my house. All the sutras at my maternal grandpa and grandma\u2019s funeral were made by Yukari-chan\u2019s father, so our family have acquaintance with Yukari-chan\u2019s family.\u201cYou both have grown taller, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s subtle because you are sitting, but I can see that you are growing more and more every time I meet you. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dYukari-chan replied with, \u201cI may not grow more than this,\u201d while Iwai replied with, \u201cI will grow more!\u201d The living room door opened again when I was watching the exchange between them.\u201cOh, Mom, there you are\u2026 Do you have time now?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dMy brother has a troubled look with camera on his hand. He seemed to like the camera so much that he started to carry it with him at school. He even puts it on his desk at the council\u2019s meeting, it\u2019s not smartphone so it\u2019s fine.\u201cIt looks like there isn\u2019t enough space. There is a video of family trip, so I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 It seems that it can\u2019t be used as a webcam unless there is a certain amount of space\u2026 Ah.\u201dMy brother looked at us and added, \u201cI\u2019ll join you later\u201d. While I said my gratitude, my eyes are glued to one place.My brother\u2019s camera, the lens part glows red. As if to inform it\u2019s recording, the light glows blazingly. Seeing the strong and sharp light, I remembered the words Iwai said earlier.\u2013\u2013 The murderer seems to be able to control fireball.The fireball is about the camera\u2026 An old man who wasn\u2019t familiar with the camera saw it, so he just thought of it as a fireball\u2026 However, if you use it as a webcam, what\u2019s the purpose to bring a camera even though you have a smartphone?Slowly, I turn to my brother.

Despite my anxiety, I finished the works given to me from reading session with Yukari-chan and Iwai at home on last weekend.But as if to remind me of the reality, my brother wandered out of the house at midnight last night and went somewhere.I thought to follow him, but my brother only went out for about 15 minutes. It will be difficult to go back to my room before my brother comes back, so I stayed. Maybe my anxiety grew particularly because of today\u2019s after-school council meeting was depressing.\u201cHey, what are you doing absent-mindedly?\u201dWhen I was lying down my head on desk, thinking about my brother\u2019s midnight walk, I was hit by a rolled-up clear file. There is only one person who does this to me. When I lunged Iwai\u2019s torso, who came to my classroom during the break, he immediately surrenders.\u201cWa-wait, don\u2019t fight~\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s self-defense.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s obviously overkill~\u201dYukari-chan stood between me and Iwai, panicking.\u201cThat\u2019s because he come all the way to here just to hit me.\u201d\u201cWe-well, let\u2019s talk with words rather than fist? Also, Iwai-kun, you are also wrong, you can just tap on Mai-chan desk right\u2026?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s very rare that she\u2019s like this. She usually talks about her \u2018onii-chan\u2019 all the time.\u201d\u201cDo-don\u2019t say it like that\u2026 recently Mai-chan is just feeling out of box\u2026\u201dRecently, I always arrived at school before my brother.Whenever I\u2019m moving class, I always make sure to pass in front of my brother\u2019s classroom, wear a hat with an arrow stuck in my head, or suddenly show him a bridge. Of course, with my recent behaviors, people around me start to think I\u2019m an eccentric after summer vacation. All students except Yukari-chan and Iwai seems to be thinking \u201cI don\u2019t know how to deal with her\u201d and I was treated like an oddball.\u201cI was curious, what did your brother do to you, Kurobe?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause, every time you saw him, you seem threatening him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not threatening him, I\u2019m just providing him surprises, to make his day fun.\u201dIwai looked at me suspiciously while shaking his head. I looked back at him.\u201cBy the way, Iwai, why are you\u2014\u201d\u201cAttention, is there anyone who passed by Hoshimifushi on the way to school?\u201dA teacher entered the classroom impatiently. Even though it\u2019s break now, a tense atmosphere flows in the classroom. Hoshimifushi is a forest located nearby school, but it\u2019s on the back and surrounding the mountain. That\u2019s why students rarely use that route to go to school. I can even see the trees of Hoshimifushi Forest from corridor\u2019s window and feels I can reach them if I stretch my hand.\u201cIsn\u2019t Suzuki lives in that area?\u201d\u201cNo way, I live in Kara-chou.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t joke around.

It is a rule that smartphones can be operated only during breaks, and it is prohibited to use them on campus area after school. That\u2019s why everyone is starting to search the internet, but Yukari-chan seems to have be quicker.

Only I, Yukari-chan, and Iwai left behind in the empty classroom.\u201cActually, I\u2026\u201dIwai opened his mouth to cut off the sudden silence.\u201cLast night, from my room\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t want to hear it, I thought silently. But Iwai looks straight into my eyes.\u201cI saw your brother walking towards the scene of the incident.\u201dAlthough I was strangely convinced on his remark, my heart keeps denying. Feeling like I\u2019m losing my foothold, I shook my head to regain my composure.\u201cMy brother won\u2019t do something childish like that\u2026\u201d\u2014He will do something more brutal than that.I\u2019m sure he will. But my intuition has no meaning, let alone confirmation. Just like the camera. I felt that my brother had something to do with that, even if he wasn\u2019t doing anything. And it just made an endless anxiety grew bigger in my chest.\u25c7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the talk is prolonged, they wouldn\u2019t even be able to eat lunch.However, Nojima-sensei keep talking about the cancelled reading session with a lot of words, and everyone was fidgeting to finish it as soon as possible. After all, everyone could have imagined that it would be canceled. Even though the incident happened in the middle of summer vacation, the criminal still hasn\u2019t been caught, and rather the crime scene is approaching school.\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked the principal and I got permission to do it inside school\u2026 Even though we couldn\u2019t do reading session at the kindergarten, everyone, let\u2019s do our best again!\u201dEveryone was stunned by Nojima-sensei\u2019s words. Is this suffering will still going on? Such thought written in their face. Actually, everyone was glancing around, and I also look at my brother.\u201cAlso, even though the reading session supposedly to be held on kindergarten by the end of month, the gymnasium can only be used on this weekend afternoon.\u201dThe teacher\u2019s words made everyone confused this time. Even the picture-story show has just finished drafting, coloring, and cutting out, and is about to be put into assembly. I even haven\u2019t read through the story. Today is Tuesday. We don\u2019t have enough time to pull it on weekends. It will be better if it\u2019s only one person reading, but Nojima-sensei said that \u201cif everyone read it together, it will be more exciting!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be exciting! Everyone, let\u2019s do our best!\u201dNojima-sensei smiles. Until now, everyone nodded vaguely with her words, but this time they just glancing each other and couldn\u2019t even move their heads.\u25c7\u201cThat teacher, is surely pain in the ass! What the hell, she\u2019s not even teacher yet!\u201dAfter being freed from the council\u2019s meeting, the first thing came out from Iwai\u2019s mouth was grunt. The lunch break will be over in five minutes, so we can\u2019t have lunch. Rather, what is he doing going to my class as he pleased? Yukari-chan who seems to be drawing alone in the classroom, responded him with anxiety, \u201cis it Nojima-sensei again\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe reading session has been canceled, but instead we will read in front of everyone on Friday\u2019s lunch break.\u201d\u201cEhh, y-you said you haven\u2019t read the book at all right? How about the picture-story assembling\u2026? W-we won\u2019t make it on time\u2026 Aren\u2019t we still prohibited to stay after school for this week?\u201d\u201cShe said we will make it in time if we do our best.\u201d\u201cNo way, that\u2019s impossible. There isn\u2019t enough people and time. No matter how much you estimate it, you need at least 6 days including weekend to finish\u2026!\u201dYukari-chan closed her eyes while whining. Somehow, she squeezed her cheeks while letting out a whimper and closes her eyes again.\u201cAlso, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be complained about reading practice\u2026 It\u2019s feels like, they want to compensate it by agreeing to whatever idea thrown to them.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cWhat to do\u2026\u201dIf my brother become busy, he won\u2019t have any killing activities for a while. But I\u2019m afraid if he keeps holding back, it will explode. My surprise providing also hindered. I can endure until the end of this week, but if Nojima-sensei said, \u2018let\u2019s hold a regular reading session to make up the canceled event!\u2019 I\u2019m done for\u2026As I tried to dispel the anxiety I couldn\u2019t hold, I laid my head on Yukari\u2019s desk until the bell rang.\u25c7T/N: again, I\u2019m very sorry with my instability updates.

A day before the scheduled reading session at school, I cling into my brother\u2019s hand while suppressing my sleepiness on my way home. I\u2019m sure he will be surprised when I suddenly cling into him while walking.\u201cHm? What is it?\u201dOr that\u2019s what I thought.My brother just gave me a smile on my futile attempt. He\u2019s not surprised and the reaction he gave me is lukewarm. Don\u2019t tell me, because I\u2019ve been preparing for the reading session for the last 2 days without sleeping, he assumed my abnormal behaviors are because of lack of sleep\u2026? If that so, then it\u2019s a miss.\u201cNow, here is the question! How will I feel if I bite Onii-chan\u2019s arm right now?\u201dMy brother is smart. He will feel troubled if everything goes as expected. But I\u2019m sure he will not grasp my real intention.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Sleepy, maybe?\u201d he gave that answer while shaking his head. I feel my face burning and I gaze into the red sky. (TL: another fail, poor Mai lol)\u201cIt will be nice if tomorrow is really the last. For reading session.\u201d\u201cIt will. I\u2019m sure Nojima-sensei will feel fulfilled after doing it once.\u201dMy brother sighs. The teacher\u2019s existence would have been stressful for my brother. I haven\u2019t confirmed it yet, but I\u2019m sure the insects inside the morgue box on the porch have increased.

In the gymnasium, second and third graders were waiting impatiently with their eyes shining. But some other students are smiling with half teasingly and half curiosity. \u00a0Yukari stood a little far from everyone.And strangely, even though Nojima-sensei is in charge for first year students, I can\u2019t see first-year students around. I looked around the audience seats with the script in one hand. My brother is checking the read-through with the officers of the first grade, the other third grades are doing the final confirmation of the picture-story show, with the second grade assisting. However, only Nojima-sensei looked anxious and often glancing at the clock.\u201cIt\u2019s weird. Even though I told them to come.\u201dMy hunch tells me to not make eye contact, but I was too late. Nojima-sensei talks to me while flipping trough the stage curtain saying, \u201cI told students from my class to come, but no one is here\u2026\u201d\u201cIf everyone didn\u2019t come to watch the reading session, everyone\u2019s effort will be wasted, it\u2019s sad.\u201dNo, it won\u2019t be wasted. Or rather, I suspect the reason for first-year students didn\u2019t come might because Nojima-sensei. In fact, all the first-year committee are looking down with tired face.After a while, my brother looked at the clock and called out to everyone, \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d The backstage committee raises the curtain. Iwai is in charge of turning over the picture-story show. Actually, I wanted to do it because that\u2019s mean I didn\u2019t have to read aloud, but I lost in rock-paper-scissors.We line up in the specified spots and opens the pages of the book. Soon my turn came around, and next to me is my brother.\u201cAnd he said, it doesn\u2019t have to be normal. Everyone has their own personality.\u201dAll the students who came to the reading session listened to my brother\u2019s voice. Some students may have come here for my brother\u2026 or rather, many of them did. In fact, everyone\u2019s eyes are shining while listening to my brother.\u201cI\u2019m glad. Everyone becomes my friends! Everyone nodded to that word. She was delighted with tears in her eyes.\u201dThe story in the reading session is about making friends with a girl who was avoided by everyone because she\u2019s different from other people when she was young. There is also a fantasy element where she goes to another world in the middle of the story. The book cover is drawn in a touching and grand way, it also seems has been featured on TV. It was Nojima-sensei\u2019s choice.Now comes the part after she has returned from another world, she\u2019s now able to make friends in reality. \u00a0Lastly, it\u2019s my brother part and the reading session will come to end.\u201cThen the girl made friends. The girl who was able to get along with everyone is laughing happily with everyone\u2026 the end.\u201dAs my brother finished reading and turned off the microphone, everyone applauses. All of the reading session\u2019s committees bows down all at once and says, \u201cthank you\u201d in unison. It was my brother\u2019s suggestion, even though we didn\u2019t practice it, everyone did it perfectly in sync.\u201cLastly, a speech from Nojima-sensei who held this reading session.\u201dMy brother suddenly turned on the microphone again. That\u2019s not in the script. Everyone was confused. I wondered if Nojima-sensei had done something, but the teacher herself also looks confused.\u201cHmm?? Me?? Eh, what\u2019s should I do?\u201dHowever, Nojima-sensei does not seem dissatisfied. My brother quickly handed the microphone to her, and he quickly tried to get to the backstage with all other members. I also hurried back.\u201cDid Nojima-sensei told you she wants to do that?\u201dMy brother didn\u2019t answer my question. Then suddenly, the projector cloth screen on the stage came down. Everyone was surprised, but Nojima-sensei looked happy while saying, \u201cis this a surprise?\u201d I have a bad feeling. Eventually, the projector turned on, and images that looked like they were taken with a smartphone began to be projected.[\u201cAh, then, can you lend that card to me?\u201d][\u201cYes?\u201d][\u201cAfter all, you can always give it to your brother any other time, right? I want to use this as reference for reading session! I\u2019m sure everyone in the kindergarten will be happy.\u201d][\u201cBut\u2026\u201d][\u201cPlease, please, please~\u201d][\u201cOh, it feels like I\u2019m a thief. I don\u2019t want Kurobe-san to look sad!\u201d]What I saw in the video is Nojima-sensei took my card from me. There is also the part where she behaves like a kindergarten child by pleading to me. The other teachers who came to see the reading session looked at me.[\u201cHey, over there, don\u2019t chit chat. And Mai-chan, if Mai-chan doesn\u2019t do her best, sensei will feel troubled.\u201d][\u201cWell, Mai-chan is so good at making cards, but you won\u2019t continue working. Even though sensei thought Mai-chan could do better that this\u2026\u201d][\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. What if Mai-chan do this instead of coloring? Because coloring is too easy you are getting bored, right?\u201d][\u201cHere, these too\u201d]Next on the screen, Nojima-sensei put sheets of drawing papers on my desk with a bang. Maybe because of the sound effect, some of spectators at gymnasium flinched their shoulder in surprise.[\u201cMai-chan should do cutting and clipping instead of coloring. Right, Iwai-kun, can you do the coloring instead?\u201d]Looking at that, it seems like Nojima-sensei has a strong grudge on me. The eyes around anxiously looked at me, and then immediately turned to Nojima-sensei.\u201cWe-well\u2026 what does this mean, Mai-chan?\u201dI haven\u2019t done anything. However, because it\u2019s only me on the screen, it seems like it was my doing. Even if I shook my head, she would think I\u2019m lying.\u201cNojima-sensei\u2026 What does this mean? As far as I can see in the video, it seems that you clearly act discriminately to some students\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I just wanted to have a successful reading session with everyone\u2026 But it seems Mai-chan misunderstood me\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, then Nojima-sensei, let\u2019s talk in the staff room. And all students should return to their classes, no need to clean up.\u201dAnother teacher tries to disband the students. Could it be, this video is from my brother\u2026? Aside from wandering at midnight, my brother always carried a camera with him. I\u2019m sure, he seems to use it in a bizarre direction, like shooting insects dying with better image quality than smartphones. Unlike smartphones, cameras are certainly not subject to confiscation at school. There is also a class that takes pictures of the town scenery.While I\u2019m feeling dumbfounded, my brother called me and said, \u201clet\u2019s go back\u201d. With mixed feelings, I followed him.\u25c7T/N: this part is too long so I have to split it into two part, I\u2019m sorry, the next part will be posted soon\u00a0maybeI don\u2019t know what to say. I gave my resignation letter to my company and they rejected it, I was told to quit on December (which is really out of my schedule plan), it\u2019s depressing, I want to quit so bad coz my work has been taxing my health mentally. And so, because I wanted to quit, maybe it just my feeling but they seems to gave me many work and made me busy\u2026 so it\u2019s really hard to translate at night after come back from work. Sorry.I can only say that I really won\u2019t drop this novel. But I will update slower that usual. I applied for day off next week tho, hope they allow me.

Although the heat remained, there was no damp wind, and a refreshing autumn breeze is blowing.\u201cOnii-chan, did you always record Nojima-sensei\u2019s actions?\u201dWhile holding hands together, I asked him. I thought he will deny and give me excuses, but he just nodded quietly.\u201cYeah. Her behaviours as a teacher are clearly crossing the line. I thought if I tell everyone that Mai is being bullied, no one will believe me because we are family.\u201d\u201cAm I being bullied?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, her attitudes are different only to Mai. And other girl students at committee seems to be having hard time too, so I figure we need to straight it up.\u201dMy brother said so while gazing to the sky. The sound of cicadas that had been heard until a while ago, has disappeared, and the cries of\u00a0Higurashi\u00a0are echoing around. In the distance, I could see small children playing in the park.\u00a0(TN: Higurashi/Tanna Japonensis is an evening cicada, I\u2019m not an insect expert and I don\u2019t know the English word for Higurashi, so I decided to put it as it is.)\u201cThat teacher wasn\u2019t very good in managing my class either, especially the violent third year students. It\u2019s not to the point to be annoying, so I don\u2019t need to submit a complain, also maybe because she\u2019s just a college student and not really teacher yet.\u201dSomehow, my brother seems to be more mature than Nojima-sensei. Kurobe-kun in the manga has always seem to mature faster than other kids around him since young age, and even now I still can feel that tendency. Perhaps for him, he sees adults in same level or lower than him.If that so, I think it will be stressful. Even though by having stress doesn\u2019t mean he can arrange death game and kill his classmates, since that haven\u2019t happened yet, I can sympathize with him for now.Even though that kind of thing has nothing to do with the manga, I really hate it. But I can\u2019t do it no matter what.\u201cHere.\u201dAs I walked while staring at the shadow extending in front of me, my upper arm was poked with something a bit hard. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a cutter, but it doesn\u2019t feel like a knife. When I looked at it, it was a card that was confiscated by Nojima-sensei.\u201cI took it back.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 thank you.\u201dA card that I made to surprise my brother. My brother handed it over to me. It\u2019s useless now but I\u2019m a little happy.\u201cI was going to surprise you with this originally\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, I was surprised. I think you made it well.\u201d\u201cNot that kind of reaction. More like, I want to see you got struck in awe. Like a heart-stopping surprise.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking for long time, but why do you want to surprise me so bad?\u201dI stopped my legs at my brother\u2019s word. There is no way I can say so that he won\u2019t kill his classmates in the future. I thought a bit and look straight to my brother\u2019s eyes.\u201cBecause the world will over.\u201dThe glimmering dark deep-sea like eyes stared at me as if digging deep inside me. It looked awkwardly unbalanced with the solid blue sky.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want to see Onii-chan\u2019s surprised face.\u201dI smiled. My brother seems a little astonished, but the core of his eyes still cold as if he sees through me. After a while, he took a step closer to me and messed up my hair.\u201cWah, wait\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou said something so cheeky, I just want to tease you.\u201d\u201cStop it, Onii-chan is too rough, I feel like been attacked by a crow!\u201dHe\u2019s kneading my hair like clay, but it doesn\u2019t hurt because he\u2019s not using strength. After a while, my brother stopped stroking my messed-up head.\u201cYou did well, Mai.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cReading session.\u201dMy brother\u2019s voice was so gentle that I was taken aback. I blinked my eyes. Under the blue sky, my brother pulled my hand while saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u25c7\u201cOh yes, I forgot that mom told me to buy battery. I\u2019m sorry Mai, can you stay at home?\u201dWhen we arrived at the front of the house, my brother turned back. I was wondering if I should go with him, but my mother said that she had forgotten her key today, so if I don\u2019t stay, she will have to wait in front of the house until we come back. And it\u2019s about time for her to come back.\u201cI will also buy lunch on the way, what do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cMentaiko pasta.\u201d\u00a0(Mentaiko: pollock roe)\u201cThis girl, isn\u2019t that a little expensive\u2026 Oh well, don\u2019t forget to lock the door, okay?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cJust say yes once.\u201dAfter seeing off my brother who said that I went inside alone. After washing my hands and rinse my mouth, I sit lazily on the sofa in the living room. The convenience store is located on main street, there will be no danger going there alone.And the incident with cat being run over will happen on winter. Thinking about something I could do to surprise my brother; I went out to the garden to dig a hole.For today, let\u2019s dig many small holes rather than one big hole.I dig for a while. After the garden filled with holes like whack-a-mole holes, my brother hasn\u2019t come back yet. I leave my smartphone on the living room. I wiped off the soil on my hands and enter the living room. It\u2019s a hassle to take off my shoes so I slowly crawled toward the table and step on something on the way.\u201cUwa\u2013\u201cIt\u2019s TV remote. I was wondering if the button is okay, turns out it become dirty with soil. I unwillingly took off my shoes, threw them into the garden and headed toward washroom. When I returned to the living room while wiping my washed hands, I was amazed at the sight.I think I pressed switch on when I stepped on the remote control a while ago. The TV is on. In between of passer-by that is being shoot in real time, there is a figure of my brother. When I try to look closely, the scene suddenly changed.[\u201cBreaking news. The criminal of the serial murder case that occurred frequently near Kozukioka-area, has been arrested. In addition, Nojima Sayaka, a 21-year-old woman who had been attacked by the criminal, is in critical condition. The criminal has been secured and transferred, and the blood spilled on the road as the reminder of horror incident, remained on the scene.\u201d]The reporter took the cameraman into a dim alley near the school. There was a dark mark of bloods there and I become speechless. The name of Nojima-sensei is displayed, and it is written in large yellow letters as an unconscious person.My head can\u2019t keep up with the images that I saw. With a bad feeling, I headed to my brother\u2019s room.I searched for an SD card as soon as I enter the room. I thought the reason he ran out of memory space was because he was recording Nojima-sensei, but there is another possibility. It\u2019s possible that my brother was searching and watching the criminal, because my brother right now still hasn\u2019t killed anyone. No matter how much I look around, I couldn\u2019t find the SD card on desk or drawer. The bookshelf, which Kurobe-kun keeps his favourite grotesque record, haven\u2019t been crafted, and instead the reference books were just lined up. However, the letters I saw in between statistics books, made my heart beats violently.What if my brother was trying to predict where the killer would kill next, and every night he went out so he could be there when the incident happens\u2026?It might just my imagination, I have no way to confirm it, but there is no reason to absolutely deny it. My heart beats harder but then I head towards the porch.I put my hands into the back of morgue box. When I opened the aluminium box, I found an SD card with a memo pad.I pick it up and immediately connect it on my laptop.[\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u2026\u201d]The video started with a scene where the frame shook as the cameraman ran. Occasional streetlights seem to be saying that it\u2019s barely outside. It might be midnight because it\u2019s dark and there is almost no sound of cars. The voice belongs to my brother. He was filming this.[\u201cWhat\u2026 already dead huh?\u201d]The scenes are cut off immediately with a sigh when a person is seen lying down. It repeats, only the places always change. However, my brother gradually seemed to be frustrated and said, \u201cThe calculation was wrong again\u2026\u201d; \u201cCriminal, where are you\u2026 It\u2019s only dead guys\u2026\u201d with small voice.That alone made it clear why my brother was wandering at midnight.My brother wants to record when the criminal is murdering people. But my brother is frustrated because he only found the victim already dead. When I flipped open the memo pad while feeling astonished, there is a memo of the criminal information that I could hear from the news, a calculation formula that predicts the next murder site, and more\u2014[\u201cNojima, she matches the criminal\u2019s victim preferences. Maybe I can make her colliding with the criminal at Friday afternoon?\u201d]Maybe he can\u2019t control his thrilled heart, there is a memo with a hasty handwriting as if he dances with his pen. Inside that memo seems to have calculated when the criminal will move his target near school.My heartbeat is noisy. I take off the SD card from my laptop and return it back along with the memo pad to its original place.It\u2019s not my delusion. I felt that my sweet expectations that I had somewhere in my heart, thinking that my brother might not kill insects or hold a death game, were shattered.I should do something about it\u2026My brother will absolutely kill all his classmates in the summer of his first-year high school.\u25c7T/N: Next chapter will also be split into two because it will be even longer than this chapter. Please understand.Also, thank you for everyone who gave me encouragements and helpful advice. I talked a lot with HR team and they finally decided the day. I will wait patiently until then.Sad news is, I can\u2019t get days off as I planned. So I can\u2019t give bonus chapters TT sorry.After quitting, I plan to translate more novels and fasten the update to 3 times a week.\u00a0(wish me luck)\u00a0I already have one suggestion on the line, so if you guys have more suggestion me and my team will consider it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 13.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u25cb 257 DAYS AGO (PART 1)In the morning at the kitchen, the sizzling sound of egg being cooked can be heard. When I was rolling the omelette, a man on the TV, wearing winter clothes and trembling while pointing to famous places in the city, said \u201cIt looks like it will be cold this week\u201d.Time has passed since Nojima-sensei\u2019s case, it\u2019s already mid-November. As if the heat in summer was just an illusion, the temperature dropped to the point I can\u2019t go to school without cardigan or coat anymore. It\u2019s so cold I could die.And if I can\u2019t keep my brother\u2019s interest a little bit more, I will die for real on July 28th.I was planning to continue to provide surprises after my brother fell asleep, but I have a golden rule that I will not disturb my brother\u2019s sleep time. Human tends to fall into unstable state when they don\u2019t have enough sleep. Even though he already has an abnormal hobby, it will be dangerous if the hobby becomes even distorted because of his unstable mind.[\u201cNext is, the showcase of cute children photos sent by our viewers!\u201d]The TV screen changed from weather charts into a show that presented cute animals owned by viewers. On the opposite of kitchen counter, my brother was relaxing on the living room\u2019s sofa while saying, \u201chow cute\u201d to my mother calmly. But I know my brother and mother has a different meaning of cuteness.When my brother says \u2018cute\u2019, it matched with his own value of \u2018cuteness\u2019. It must be different as to how the girls in class say something is cute.I was worried if he will kill the dog, or if he will train the dog to kill people, when he said, \u201cHow cute, I want to keep a dog too\u2026\u201d. I put the freshly cooked rolled omelette on the plate while staring at his back.It\u2019s about eight months before my brother holds the death game, so I came up with bento operation.Food, clothing, and shelter are the three of major desires humans required. So, I asked mother\u2019s help to make an astonishing bento that exceeds my brother\u2019s expectations.Of course, the bento was made to give a spectacular surprise. However, it doesn\u2019t mean the taste will be extremely bad or it contains weird objects. I took good care of hygiene, making sure it\u2019s delicious, and well-balanced bento, so that my brother will not get food poisoning even if I made a mistake.So, what\u2019s the deal?The food inside.\u201cOnii-chan, your bento is done!\u201dI cut the chilled omelette into cute pieces, pack it in a lunch box, and wrap it tightly in bandana before calling my brother. My brother received the lunch with a business smile.\u201cThank you, Mai.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s bento is a masterpiece work.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you always say that?\u201d\u201cReal artisan won\u2019t slack off even for a day.\u201dThe key point of the lunch box is its appearance. To surprise my brother, I made bento boxes that imitate masterpieces or sculptures, not characters.The detailed geometric pattern is reproduced with seaweed, so my brother can eat all parts of the bento safely just like eating a whole cake with its decoration. In short, everything is edible.I made sure to make the bento surprisingly artistic, but not to overwhelming because it will lose its purpose (as lunchbox) if my brother doesn\u2019t want to eat. So, I keep aiming for that delicate line.And, while aiming for my brother to think, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just flashy?\u201d, I put the surprise inside. The appearance is like a normal hamburger steak, but when divided in two, grilled ginger will come out. \u00a0It\u2019s a camouflaged hamburger with hidden gimmick. It will make my brother always stay alert.Today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday, was a bento that emphasized surprise in appearance, in short, it\u2019s just a normal character bento.However, there are a lot of gimmicks, it provides double or triple surprises.[\u201cNow, what\u2019s today fortune\u2026?\u201d]Before I know it, the program that mother was watching started the fortune-telling corner. It will be bad if I don\u2019t leave the house soon. As I rush upstairs to get ready, I heard my brother\u2019s voice from the first floor.\u201cMai, are you ready?\u201d\u201cComing!\u201dI hurry down the stairs. After cheerfully telling my parents, \u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d, I headed to the front door. My brother has already opened the door, and I hurriedly run.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you even if you\u2019re not in a hurry.\u201dMy brother chuckled at me. I felt uneasy because in the last two months, his smile is getting closer to Kurobe-kun in manga. Soon, my brother will witness a white cat being run over by a car. He will start from \u201cI want to kill creatures\u201d to \u201cI want to mess up human\u2019s body\u201d, and the upgraded D-day when the madness stage has been set will become.In terms of time, the event where the cat is run over is just around the corner. The scene was described in detail in Kurobe-kun\u2019s monologue as a recollection, when he was in the third grade of junior high school, wearing a black muffler on his neck, untied.The construction site of the station building drawn in the manga background was a three-story building. A building that looks exactly like it was built on the main street, is now on the first-floor construction. According to the construction uncle, it is a six-story building, and it seems that the construction of the third floor will start in two weeks from now, and the fourth floor will start two weeks later. In short, I have to be careful in the meantime so that my brother doesn\u2019t witness the cat incident.Therefore, this winter, I will stay with my brother while the third floor of the station building is being constructed.\u201cBy the way, Nojima-sensei has been discharged from hospital.\u201dAs the traffic light turned red, I stopped, and my brother suddenly turned to me.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d\u201cI was told by a friend in the class whose mom work at the hospital.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it just about a month since she regained consciousness\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. It seems there is no problem with her body, so she was released quickly. But she made quite a fuss at the hospital ward because she was told to return to her parent\u2019s home.\u201dNojima-sensei stayed in the intensive care unit for about two weeks, and it took her a month to regain consciousness. My brother looked worried about her\u2026 or not.\u201cGood thing that the criminal has been caught, even though it\u2019s still scary.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dMy brother hasn\u2019t got his hands dirty.Even though he happened at the scene when Nojima-sensei incident occurs, it wasn\u2019t like he just watched her dying and didn\u2019t call an ambulance. He just projected a video of Nojima-sensei at the gymnasium.Then it\u2019s almost like a bet whether sensei will be punished and sent home immediately or after school. If sensei meets the criminal, my brother may see the moment of her being stabbed, and if he didn\u2019t get to see, because it\u2019s unexpected, so he will still feel happy. In the end, my brother will get both, as he got half and half results.\u201cBut it\u2019s surprising to see her being attacked right after reading session.\u201dIt seems that Nojima-sensei was attacked on her way to the expected place after my brother confirms the time of crime. But seems that he couldn\u2019t see the scene.My brother arrived after he heard an office worker scream to call an ambulance and took life-saving measures.Someone was shooting the scene with a smartphone, and I saw the whole footage posted on the net. The figure of my brother running up to the office worker who nursed Nojima-sensei was clearly reflected there.If the incident happened as expected, it\u2019s unthinkable to not report it. But even if he reports to police, believing everything a junior high school student had said might be dangerous too. Objectively speaking, even if they claim that \u2018he just watched a person being stabbed\u2019, it won\u2019t be applicable to him.My brother doesn\u2019t sympathize with the fact that he should help if a person is falling.Because his fundamental is different, even if people said, \u2018he just watched a person being stabbed\u2019, he won\u2019t think about it.However, even if he can\u2019t have empathy or emotions, I still can make him think that holding a death game is a hassle or change the flow a little by little so that he is not interested in the game. I will do it in a playful way so that he won\u2019t realize that I\u2019m already aware of my brother\u2019s true nature.\u201cSomeday, I will make you more surprised, Onii-chan.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you competing with, Mai? Nojima-sensei was stabbed for real, you know?\u201dMy brother looked at me in disbelief. His sad face makes me feel unbelievable. My brother pats my head while saying, \u201cbut I know that you hate Nojima-sensei.\u201d And before I knew it, we started crossing the green traffic light.\u25c7\u201cGood morning!\u201dIn the front row of the classroom, I call out to Yukari-chan, who is playing around with a colourful fantasy pouch. Because I had confirmed she didn\u2019t carry anything dangerous, I thought she might have noticed it, but she still shook her shoulders in surprise.\u201cAhhh, I was surprised. Good morning, Mai-chan.\u201d\u201cYup, as expected, that\u2019s the best reaction when surprised.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dI always surprise my brother but, his reaction is just, \u201cwow, I\u2019m surprised\u201d while acting surprised. Seeing Yukari-chan\u2019s reaction, I feel touched.\u201cOi.\u201d\u201cUwaaaaa!!\u201dI jumped when a voice suddenly came down from above my head. When I look back, Iwai\u2019s face looked displeased. I sighed and hit him on the shoulder.\u201cYou surprise me. I thought it was a ghost noise.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still human voice, you know.\u201d\u201cWell, your voice has been much lower since last month. Did anyone start living around your throat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s voice change, don\u2019t say weird things. By the way, I saw your brother.\u201d\u201cHoo?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of reply is that.\u201dIwai seems to be dissatisfied with my reply. When I couldn\u2019t understand it, he pointed out, \u201cDidn\u2019t you said I must tell you everything if I saw your brother?\u201d I suddenly remembered that I had asked him hundreds of times when I was in elementary school about it. It was when I still thought of my brother as an innocent and kind brother.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026 So, what was my brother doing?\u201d\u201cHe was warning the first-year, but it feels strange.\u201d\u201cSomething strange?\u201d\u201cYeah. He didn\u2019t look angry at all, or rather, I wonder if he will ever get angry?\u201d\u201cCertainly\u2026 Mai-chan\u2019s older brother seems like he doesn\u2019t have the image of getting angry\u2026\u201dYukari-chan agrees with Iwai\u2019s words. When I think about it, I\u2019ve never seen my brother really angry. Even though he calls his sister \u2018that thing\u2019 inside his head, maybe he can\u2019t let out his anger because he only sees humans as living beings that can move or a being to be killed.It\u2019s a mindset that he will ignore the gravel on the side of the road even if it can complain.\u201cBy the way, why is Iwai in this class again?\u201d\u201cI came to ask you about the student council election. Will you be the student council president next year?\u201d\u201cSeriously.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIwai opened his eyes wide to my words. It\u2019s late November, so people who want to join the next student organization will run this week and an election will be held next month. Until then, it will be a campaigning period, but as long as there are candidates, the rest of the job is just election administration. And after the candidates take over their work position safely, it ends.\u201cEveryone thinks you will be the student council president.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anyone who wants should do it. I haven\u2019t said that I\u2019ll be the president next year.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t be selfish.\u201dListening to my words, Yukari-chan said, \u201cBut people will naturally think like that\u2026 Because Mai-chan\u2019s brother will graduate soon.\u201dThat\u2019s right. My brother will graduate from junior high school and enter high school in three months. So, I don\u2019t have time to join the student organization. I used all of my time to provide surprises to my brother.\u201cIt\u2019s already time for elections, huh. It was a year ago that I gave a speech next to Mai-chan.\u201d\u201cYeah. When the election is over, it\u2019s winter vacation, and then the end of the year\u2026\u201dWinter vacation, I took a breath. Yes, it\u2019s winter vacation. My brother will witness a cat being run over during the winter vacation.I look at the calendar next to the blackboard and align it to the construction site schedule. Then, X-week, which seems to correspond to my brother\u2019s D-day, was half of the morning class day and half of the winter vacation. If it\u2019s on winter vacation, I can make him stay at home all day, but if it\u2019s school day, it will be hard. Should I forcibly lock him at home\u2026? It\u2019s a crime, but it\u2019s definitely better than dozens of people dying.\u201cDoes Mai-chan have a plan to go somewhere during the winter vacation?\u201d\u201cI usually go to my grandpa\u2019s house every year. But this year and next year, my brother and I are taking the exam, so I don\u2019t think we can go.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 You aim for your brother\u2019s, Sakaemine High School, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMy brother is studying for an exam now, but sadly, he wanted a high school with the highest deviation value in the prefecture, excellent security, and the latest equipment to hold a death game.In a roundabout way, \u2018Isn\u2019t he just aiming for a place with a higher deviation value?\u2019 I recommended high school with an old building that has a high deviation and rich historical value, cannot be hacked and safe, but it\u2019s all rejected with, \u201cIt\u2019s close to home.\u201dThe surprises I\u2019ve made wasn\u2019t very useful, also I couldn\u2019t bother him while my brother is studying for the exam. I think my brother would definitely pass the exam to high school, and it makes me feel that the future isn\u2019t good.\u201cShould I use this month\u2019s long weekend\u2026?\u201dJust this month, there will be three days of consecutive holiday. Somehow, I have a bad feeling as I silently stare at the calendar.\u25c7T/N: Sorry for not updating last week. Last week was a busy and hard week for me, I\u2019ve been preparing for my resignation too. So I didn\u2019t have enough time to translate. I will try to do more next week.See you on next chapter!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

RIP)\u25cb 257 DAYS AGO (PART 2)Holidays were basically sparse this year, and it was rare to be blessed with consecutive holidays, let alone three consecutive holidays. Holidays often occur on weekends such as Sundays, resulting in less time spent with my brother because of school and inevitably less surprise made.That\u2019s why this weekend will be the day. I have steadily prepared and surprised my brother since Friday evening and today.Until now, I only made a surprise card to put in my brother\u2019s textbook, but this time I made an imaginary stuffed animal that appears in the textbook.When he looks at the fantasy animal inside the textbook, and search inside his desk, he will find the same animal that appeared in the textbook in front of him. It\u2019s an unexpected fantasy world, my brother will be surprised for sure.As I sew the cloth and stuff it with cotton, sometimes I stabbed my finger instead of the cloth, and I almost let out a sound. It makes me want to throw it out (yeet!), but I stretch out to change my mood and make the doll stand up.Did I make a mistake in the size or the composition of cotton? A fictional animal from a mix of triceratops, elephant, and\u00a0clione\u00a0isn\u2019t able to stand up at all. When I was thinking about buying a stuffed animal that shake in response to the surrounding sounds and using the failed doll as a weapon instead, I heard my mother calling me from the first floor.\u201cYe\u2014ss\u201dI stab the needle into the stuffed animal\u2019s head and leave my room. In the living room, my mother stands in front of the phone and said, \u201cWe are going to Grandpa\u2019s house,\u201d as soon as she saw me.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt seems that grandpa is sick. Grandma died last year so we have to take care of him. Mai, prepare to go.\u201dI nodded in hurry at my impatient mother.\u201cI will go too.\u201dLooking back, my brother was standing behind me. Apparently, he came after hearing my mother\u2019s voice.\u201cBut Makoto have to prepare for the exam, right?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, after all, I don\u2019t want to study while worrying that my grandpa may be dead. I can study at grandpa\u2019s house too.\u201dI felt chills on my spine at my brother\u2019s words.My brother is a person who accurately decides the optimal solution to gain society sympathy. As a person, he maybe follows us because he is worried about his grandfather, but he should be able to act nicely by saying, \u201cI\u2019m studying for the exam, but do tell me the situation.\u201dDon\u2019t tell me, he wants to see Grandpa die\u2026?No way, it\u2019s his paternal grandfather, and he has a long relationship with my brother. Or rather, it\u2019s an unbroken relationship since he was born. There may be a slight feeling.\u201cI see\u2026 Okay then, we will be back home on Sunday night, so Makoto-kun, prepare change of clothes for four days.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go, Mai.\u201dMy brother pats on my shoulder. I stared at my brother\u2019s back in a hurry to prepare, feeling suspicious.\u25c7My father side\u2019s grandfather\u2026 In short, my psychopath\u2019s older brother\u2019s blood-related grandpa\u2019s house is about three prefectures away from where we live and is a place commonly called a valley. Immediately after we are ready, we got into the car that my dad was driving, but it took about three hours to arrive, and it was 8 pm by the time we arrived.\u201cTou-san, it\u2019s Takayuki.\u201dGrandpa\u2019s house is like a mansion in a historical drama, there is no intercom, only a door chime. In addition, we have to talk in a loud voice because it is regularly drowned out by the water bamboo tube and water in the garden sounds. There are only rice fields around, and the house next door is about a kilometre away, so it\u2019s fine even if there are loud sounds. But because there are no streetlights too, it\u2019s dangerous if you fall down or something happens.\u201cOh, coming.\u201dGrandpa\u2019s voice echoes from a distance. After waiting for a while, the double door opened with a rattle, and grandpa with bandages on his head and left arm appeared.\u201cSorry for troubling you to come all the way here\u2026 Hmm? Did Makoto and Mai also come?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Because they are worried\u2026 So, what happened?\u201d\u201cWell, come in first. It\u2019s cold, isn\u2019t it?\u201dGrandpa urges us to come inside. There was a bright red basin in the entrance, and tools were randomly put inside. A bear stuffed animal is hung next to it, and its eyes are shining strangely. After walking while looking at the same scenery as last year winter, we arrived at the parlour. On the core of the room, there was a framed calligraphy with \u201cSteady Progress\u201d written as decoration.\u201cSo how is your wound?\u201dMy mother asks grandpa while dad is making tea. My brother and I were sitting next to my mother.\u201cWell\u2026 I just stumbled on the stone stairs when I was going to the shrine. I actually only get a bruise, but because I hit my head, the young man at the shrine took me to a big hospital in the neighbouring town, and then\u2026\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unrelated to my fall, but it seems there is something in my head that I shouldn\u2019t have. So, I will have surgery next month. Sigh.\u201dMy mother widens her eyes and grandpa laughed lightly.\u201cThe surgery doesn\u2019t mean anything for now. Don\u2019t worry about that. And the doctor seems to tell you as if I fell down today, but it\u2019s actually an exaggeration. My bad, even though Makoto should prepare for the exam, I made you all come here. So, take your time.\u201dGrandpa has a very cheerful personality. If Kurobe-kun is a person with a dark attribute, then grandpa is a person with a perfect light attribute. I first met grandpa about a year after my mom and dad remarried, so it\u2019s about three years ago.I was playing in the snow and grandpa surprised me by coming out from behind a big snowman. On the next day, when I woke up in the morning, he was wearing armour in the hall and scared me to death.\u201cEven so, Makoto has grown up, aren\u2019t you? You might eventually surpass Takayuki.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dOn the other hand, grandpa and my brother had a rather delicate distance and somehow felt like an adult playing with a child. Of course, the child is grandpa.\u201cMai also grew taller. Last year you were only a size of azuki bean.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that small!\u201dBut because grandpa seems healthy, so I\u2019m relieved. On the phone call, it feels like he was on the verge of death. Though, I\u2019m still worried about the surgery\u2026 When I look at my brother, he still has his usual smile stuck on his face. Because his smile doesn\u2019t feel like anything unusual, if I didn\u2019t remember my past life, I would have been fooled by this smile.We ended up staying at Grandpa\u2019s house that day, and I fell asleep that night feeling a little restless.\u25c7The sound of the secondhand ticking echoes in the room. Grandpa\u2019s mansion is large and has many rooms, my brother, and my parents were assigned to different rooms than mine. However, all rooms are Japanese-style rooms in common. So, the smell of tatami mats and a little incense stick spread throughout the room.The room I use is decorated with a tiger folding screen. Somehow, while staring in the dark, I couldn\u2019t sleep and wanted to go to the bathroom. I get out of the futon and gently walk down the long corridor.Every step I did produce a sound, so I walk carefully. When I looked to the garden facing the corridor, the wind blow fluttering the dead leaves. Because there is only one toilet and I have to go through this long corridor to reach it, it\u2019s really troublesome. After walking for a while, I noticed that there is light leaking through the gap between the shoji screens.Who is still awake at this time? When I peek through the gap gently, I saw grandpa organizing the album.\u201cOjii-chan?\u201d\u201cMai? If you stay up until this late, you will shrink like azuki beans again.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t get that small! Anyway, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dWhen I entered the room, the album he was spreading was my brother\u2019s.It seems that my brother lived here from the time father divorced his ex-wife and until he remarried my mother. When I look at it, I can see that the album contains pictures of my brother in his senior year of kindergarten, his new entrance to elementary school, up to the third grade.\u201cOnii-chan is small.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dGrandpa has a complicated face. And after closing the album, he passes it on to me.\u201cJust right in time. Maybe this is also fate. You usually went to sleep right away and wake up at 8. Maybe it\u2019s God\u2019s will that you\u2019re awake now.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cWhat does Makoto look like to you?\u201dThe organizer of the death game. I couldn\u2019t answer that, and when I couldn\u2019t come out with any words, grandpa dropped his gaze.\u201cIt seems that his mother was a person who could raise her hand when she got angry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWas my brother\u2019s real mom hitting him?I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. Maybe that\u2019s why she got divorced from my dad\u2026?\u201cI don\u2019t know anything, and when he was in senior grade at kindergarten, the teacher noticed and said that apparently, he had strange bruises. Grandma was angry and took Makoto here. Then we never let Makoto meet her mother anymore.\u201dGrandpa said that and took out a piece of note from the bottom of the album. The flower shop\u2019s name in the neighbouring town and the surname \u2018Koseki\u2019 was written there.\u201cI happened to see her when I went to the hospital today. Makoto will be a high school student. I think it\u2019s better to meet her once, but I don\u2019t know what kind of person she became now. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for me and Takayuki to see Asami-san as an ex-spouse. So, I can only ask you. Will you do it?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I should go to see my brother\u2019s real mom and see what kind of person she is\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I was thinking of hiring someone, but then you come just in time. It will be easier to see what kind of person she is from her reaction towards children around Makoto\u2019s age, right?\u201dI felt a strange uncomfortable feeling from grandpa\u2019s words. Is it okay to let the second-grade junior high school girl meet a dangerous person who usually hits a child? The manga did not describe my brother\u2019s background before our parents\u2019 remarriage except for his cruel habits, so I think it\u2019s a good opportunity to get to know him.Perhaps, the thing in grandpa\u2019s head is quite dangerous, and he\u2019s in a situation where he can\u2019t really choose anything else because he doesn\u2019t have much time?\u201cOkay, but\u2026 is the surgery really okay? Is it a deadly illness?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. You\u2019re overly worried. If you\u2019re too worried, you\u2019ll have a hole in your stomach, you know.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dGrandpa chuckled at my worry. I received the note and left grandpa\u2019s room.\u25c7T/N: Both translators are half-dead bcoz of chapter 12 and 13. Let\u2019s pray for next week\u2019s chapter to come out earlier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u25cf 257 DAYS AGO(This is Makoto\u2019s POV)I don\u2019t care about others\u2019 feelings. It doesn\u2019t matter if anyone dies or not. However, living with that kind of mindset is \u201cunusual\u201d, and unusual things usually are discarded in society.But honestly, I don\u2019t even care if Mai is saying imprudent things about Nojima.Rather, I was expecting her to be stabbed.Seeing a man kill three or four people by stabbing, I thought it would be a wonderful view.However, because the principal returned Nojima early, I was unable to see the stabbing moment. And after that, I\u2019m even more disappointed that she didn\u2019t even die.\u201cI was so worried about Mai when the criminal was still around.\u201d I look anxious and act like a good, dignified brother. It\u2019s all a lie though.I was wondering if possible, she would be stabbed instead. I don\u2019t actually want my sister to die, but I\u2019m interested in the moment when a person is stabbed up close. When I heard that the victim\u2019s characteristic usually was brown-haired semi-long, I felt disappointed because it was different from Mai\u2019s characteristic.\u201cAh, the station building is already built this much\u2026\u201dAs we walked for a while, Mai looked unpleasantly to a building that had recently begun to be built, as if she was fed up looking at it. It hasn\u2019t even been completed yet, but it has a large monitor installed for promotional purposes. The cheesy promotion to go with family, friends, or lovers, was repeated.It seems that humans cannot live alone. During the moral and ethnic class at elementary school, the teacher once said that if people don\u2019t support each other, life will be painful, and they will crumble.But is that really the case? People fall in love and have children. Even though I was taught that if humans didn\u2019t do that, the number of people will not increase and the country will not be established, but actually I think it\u2019s different.At least I\u2019ve never thought of being alone as \u201clonely\u201d or \u201cpainful\u201d.In the first place, I don\u2019t have any memory of being sad. Looking at books and humans, I can understand when I feel 'sad\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d. However, I was able to take it as knowledge, not to apply it to myself.When I think about it, Mai often cries, gets angry, and laughs. She smiles when she eats delicious food and cries when she\u2019s watching sad TV drama. There are also times when she\u2019s angry while watching TV. I wonder if she\u2019s not tired of changing emotions all the time like that.(Why does Makoto\u2019s thought get me thinking he\u2019s not human\u2026)But I\u2019m sure Mai will be categorized as a \u2018human being\u2019.I thought vaguely while observing Mai who is watching the monitor about human relationships.\u25c7T/N: it was a short chapter, and the next one will be long, I will try to not split the chap, and to post maybe tomorrow or Tues. I quit my job and now is recovering my\u00a0both mental and physical\u00a0health. thanks for all the words of encouragement, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to all the comments.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is the Town Hall informing, it\u2019s 6 o\u2019clock in the morning. This is the Town Hall informing, it\u2019s 6 o\u2019clock in the morning. Let\u2019s do our best today as well.\u201d\u201cUwaaaa!!\u201dIn the area where Grandpa lives, speakers are installed in each house to call for evacuation in case of disasters. To prevent any possibility of speaker faulty, they broadcast an announcement every morning at 6 o\u2019clock. Forgetting the fact completely, I jumped out with that sudden roar. Maybe because I usually woke up at 4 o\u2019clock to make a lunch box and prepare surprises for my brother, I\u2019m feeling absent-minded. After folding up the futon, I walked out of the room while sighing and heads to the bathroom, where my brother had just finished washing his face.\u201cMai, good morning. It\u2019s unusual for you to get up late.\u201d\u201cGood morning.\u201dIs it surprising because it\u2019s rare? Well, if he were surprised by such a simple thing, that would surprise me too\u2026 \u201cExcuse me for a bit.\u201d My brother said, fixing his bed hair as I start washing my face.\u201cEven a perfect brother can get a bed hair, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt when the bubbles come into your eyes?\u201d\u201cIt is. It\u2019s super painful.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t look up here and rinse your face properly.\u201dI rinse my face while smiling bitterly. My brother muttered, \u201cI\u2019m glad Grandpa seems fine, even though he has surgery.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201c\u2026Your respond seems a bit weak, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dMy brother tilted his head to my words. I can\u2019t stop thinking about last night atmosphere as if saying grandpa\u2019s time is near. But maybe it\u2019s just my own imagination\u2026\u201cIs it?\u201d\u201cYeah. Because I love Grandpa, Mai. So, if there is something else\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I was worried that Grandpa\u2019s sickness is actually not as simple as he said.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, just a feeling.\u201dMy brother seems trying to digest my statement. Don\u2019t tell me, maybe he listened to yesterday\u2019s talk\u2026? And now he\u2019s trying to confirm it\u2026? If so, it\u2019s better to stop this talk.\u201cI\u2019m hungry, I wonder if breakfast is ready.\u201dWith that said, I try to go to the kitchen. However, I was pulled back by my elbow.\u201cYou still have bed hair. I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m living with the latest fashion style.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already become an ancient style.\u201dMy brother put me back in front of the washbasin and starts to brush my hair. Is it because my hair was unbearable to see, or because he did not want the topic to end abruptly?\u201cDid you hear anything from Grandpa yesterday?\u201dIt seems that it was the latter. I cheated by saying, \u201cNothing, but he was talking about what if he died.\u201d\u201cWell, funerals would be a problem, isn\u2019t it? It seems that Grandpa was treated as an oddball by other relatives after all.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen I asked back, my brother raised his index finger and lower his voice, saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a secret.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, but he\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t he? His voice is loud, and he can\u2019t read the mood. Also, his willpower is too strong\u2026 Grandma was a dependable person, so her relationship with other relatives is fine, but still, there is a distance.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe used to live together when I was little, so I can see that there is a distance between the relatives.\u201dMy brother sounds uneasy. But somehow, I felt he might be lying. He can act well, and I don\u2019t know which is true. I\u2019m sorry for doubting, but I\u2019m worried about the relationship between my brother and grandpa.\u201cBut even if Grandpa is weird, I still like him.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. Well, because Mai is good friends with that temple child, right.\u201d\u201cYukari-chan?\u201d\u201cYeah. My friend told me, when he came to the house, he was so surprised. Gothic Lolita, but it\u2019s all pink.\u201d\u201cYukari insisted that it\u2019s a Sweet Lolita, not a Gothic Lolita, and stop disrespecting my friend. People can like whatever they like, as long as they don\u2019t bother other people.\u201dMy brother\u2019s face stiffened when I strongly protested. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d he immediately counters my words while smiling.\u201cI watched it on TV the other day. We won\u2019t know what such an otaku kid would do, they said he might be a potential criminal.\u201d\u201cSuch thing is irrelevant.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI mean, hobbies have nothing to do with crime. I might kill people in games, but no matter what I think I still have my fundamentals as a human being. Also, there are a lot of people who have normal hobbies but still wants to kill or beat up people.\u201dFor example, my brother. I almost blurted it and stopped myself in a hurry. This is bad. I got too worked out because he talked badly about my friends. Rather, why did my brother suddenly say bad things about Yukari-chan?\u201cBut I think the people who always want to kill people or who have a hobby of killing living beings, have it hard.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf someone loves music, he can just listen to some music, and it\u2019s fine right. But if a person who loves to kill people really wants to have fun, he\u2019ll get caught. He can\u2019t do what he loves, and he\u2019ll have to endure it in his life forever. I think it\u2019s hard to think about it.\u201dFor the time being, I decided to follow my brother. Even though I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m following up properly.\u201cIt\u2019s better for such a person to die, right.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s better to die. After all, his behaviour is just an excuse, he can just kill insects or play killing games to substitute killing humans, dogs, or cats.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t it escalate his desire to kill humans if you let him kill insects or play such games?\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t it more dangerous to suppress it?\u201dRather, why am I giving my brother an opinion on how to deal with cruel personality humans? My brother should have been more familiar with this rather than me. When I suspiciously asked, \u201cAlso, why do you really get into such kind of talk?\u201d My brother, who always trying to blend in like normal people, said while laughing, \u201cAh, no, I was just curious after watching the psychopaths in a movie.\u201d(Nah, he just wants to justify himself and see if Mai can accept him as he is lol)\u201cOh, I see. Are you scared?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s scary. I was wondering what to do if those kinds of people were actually close to me.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dDoes he, perhaps saying that because he wants to meet someone who might understand in a roundabout way? But when I look at my brother, he gave \u201ca third-year middle school student who is afraid of psychopaths\u201d kind of look, so I can\u2019t really understand his thought.And before I knew it, my hair is already done fixed. I thanked him and left the room.\u25c7I was wondering if there was any good excuse to leave Grandpa\u2019s house alone, but that concern was easily resolved.Because while I was eating breakfast, grandpa called me out and said, \u201cMai is going out with Ojii-chan today.\u201d My parents want to accompany us, but grandpa said, \u201cLet me relax with my grandchild occasionally.\u201d I was wondering what about my brother, but it seems grandpa will go out with him in the afternoon.\u201cHmm, waiting for a traffic light is quite boring, huh.\u201dAfter eating breakfast, grandpa drove me to the next town. There are only mountains and wide rice fields around the grandpa\u2019s town, but this town has family restaurants and supermarkets. Probably because I\u2019m used to looking at trains and station construction buildings, so this scenery feels fresh.\u201cMaybe Ojii-chan isn\u2019t used to it because there is no traffic light around your area.\u201d\u201cYeah. Because it\u2019s rare for people to walk around. But racoons and snakes often pass through the road, so we can\u2019t speed up too.\u201dAfter a while, the traffic light turned green. The car starts running and the view of the window begins to change.\u201cSoon\u2026 I\u2019ll be returning my license to the country, so I won\u2019t be able to give you a ride like this anymore.\u201d\u201cIs it because you are already elderly?\u201d\u201cNo, because I will have surgery on my head. Even if there\u2019s nothing serious, it\u2019s still not good for an old man who had head surgery to drive around, right.\u201dI\u2019ve seen in the news on TV that grandpa and grandma had an accident before, and because dad is overly worried, I saw him have a fight with grandpa. I only saw the fight over the phone, but I could hear grandpa say something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t even get hurt, so why must I stop driving?\u201d and \u201cI will still drive until I\u2019m 100 years old!\u201d.\u201c\u2026Ojii-chan, why did you go to the shrine?\u201d\u201cWhy, if you say that you will be cursed, you know?\u201d\u201cWhat, you said it yourself that \u2018there is no God, and I must do everything by myself\u2018, didn\u2019t you?\u201dIn my words, Grandpa looked embarrassed.\u201cWell, I\u2019m in preparation for head surgery. I kinda want to rely on God.\u201d\u201cIs it that serious? The illness.\u201d\u201cit\u2019s not that serious. It\u2019s just about opening my head\u2026 Oh, we arrived. Over there.\u201dGrandpa pointed to a flower shop nearby, with a blackboard sign on its pale pink roof. Maybe because it\u2019s winter, small fir trees and Christmas flowers were lined up on the edge of eaves.\u201cIs Onii-chan\u2019s mother the owner of that store?\u201d\u201cOh. Don\u2019t mention Makoto\u2019s name no matter what, okay? Because we won\u2019t know what might happen after all.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dI actually don\u2019t have any idea what to do. But the shop, facing the main street, is open. When I left grandpa\u2019s car and went to the store, a little girl was drawing a picture at the store counter. At the same time, a woman wearing an apron stood there and smiled at me while saying \u201cWelcome!\u201d\u201cIs there anything you are looking for?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 well, it just\u2026 the flowers\u2026was beautiful from a distance\u2026 so I thought I\u2019d go take a look a bit.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. Thank you. Please look around leisurely.\u201dGrandpa gave me 2,000 yen to buy flowers in case of emergency. So, it\u2019s fine to buy some flowers later. While pretending to be choosing flowers to buy, I steal a glance of the clerk\u2026or should I say, my brother\u2019s real mother.By looking at her, she\u2019s just a really normal person. The cool atmosphere in her eyes is similar to my brother, but instead of my brother\u2019s hard to approach beauty, she gave an impression of a gentle and friendly person.Also, the girl at the counter looks more like her daughter than my brother.The girl is drawing animals and flowers colourfully. When I was staring at her, she asked me, \u201cOnee-chan wants to draw too?\u201d\u201cAh no, I just thought your drawing is really good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll ask Futaba-nee-chan to decorate the shop with this!\u201d\u201cOnee-chan?\u201d\u2026Not mother? Perhaps my question was shown in my face, my brother\u2019s mother said, \u201cThis child is my niece.\u201d Her appearance of stroking her niece\u2019s head while smiling gently is giving me a vibe of a good mother, and I feel her action is really coming from her heart.\u201c\u2026Uhm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I lied.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cMy name is Mai Kurobe. Today, I came to ask about my brother.\u201dThen, as I imagined, my brother\u2019s mother\u2019s face turned grim. It\u2019s not an angry or wary face, but more like an anxious face about something.\u201cYouko, why don\u2019t you show the drawing to grandma?\u201d\u201cOkay~\u201d\u201cAnd please tell grandma that an old acquaintance came to the store. Can you?\u201d\u201cSure~!\u201dMy brother\u2019s mother told her niece, she quickly headed to the door to flip the \u2018open\u2019 tag into \u2018closed\u2019 before finally facing me.\u201cDid you come alone today? How about Makoto?\u201d\u201cI came with Ojii-chan. My brother is at Ojii-chan\u2019s house. He must be studying because he has exams, so he won\u2019t come here.\u201dMy brother\u2019s mother nodded understandingly to my words. Then she brought out two chairs from inside and urged me to sit down.\u201c\u2026 It might be a quite long story, is it okay?\u201dAs if testing me, her gaze turns cold. I met her eyes and firmly nodded.\u25c7\u201cDid that person remarry?\u201dMy brother\u2019s mother, who took off her apron, stares straight at me. I replied, \u201cyes, about four years ago, so I have no blood connection with my brother.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. So, what did you see? Or has Makoto done something to you?\u201d\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t done anything (yet). But\u2026 I\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cWell, that kid is smart. And if something is deemed harmful or bother to him, he\u2019ll eliminate it right away. Like me.\u201dLike\u2026her? When I looked at my brother\u2019s mother\u2019s face, she nodded with her eyes down. As I expected, this person didn\u2019t even raise her hand on my brother. She was the one who was accused of child abuse and was eliminated by my brother.(*playing\u00a0Agatha\u2019s All Along* there you get it guys, it\u2019s not her mother, it\u2019s been Makoto all along!)\u201cHe\u2019s been smart since he was little. He was also kind-hearted. He didn\u2019t fight with his friends for toys, nor did he whines or be unreasonable like any other child. When I told my friends about it, they were so jealous of me, but I\u2019m actually scared of him. \u201c\u201cScared?\u201d\u201cYes. It seems like every escape route is being blocked. For example, if there is a very good student at school, and an inferior student is saying that the good student actually doing bad things behind the scenes, no one will believe it, right?\u201dCertainly, no one will believe him. Because he\u2019s a good student, he surely won\u2019t do bad things. If the relation between both students is not good, some people who don\u2019t know anything might blame the inferior student for being jealous.\u201cI thought that if Makoto did something wrong in the future and I scolded him, no one will be able to accept it. After all, that was the case.\u201dWith that said, her eyes that were staring straight at me looked strong-willed. I think she knows him so well because she was with him all the time. After all, it was her who raised him.\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been watching Makoto, so he won\u2019t do anything strange. To not let him do anything wrong. But compared to me, he was much more intelligent and cruel. He doesn\u2019t look like a young child.\u201dMy brother\u2019s mother grasped her hands tightly.\u201cOne year later. Suddenly I got a call from the kindergarten. They said there were some bruises on Makoto-kun\u2019s back. It wasn\u2019t just recently, but it looks like a year accumulation of bruises. I don\u2019t know what it was. When I was panicking, my paternal grandmother came with a child guidance centre, and they accused me of abusing Makoto. At last, I just realized that I\u2019m being eliminated.\u201d\u201cMy brother\u2026 At that time\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, he had a face like a child who was just abused, frightened by her mother, and he was crying \u2018help!\u2019 When I finally left the house with my grandmother, he looked back at me and sneered. And because I was so upset, I impulsively said\u2026 \u2018Monster\u2026 You aren\u2019t my child\u2019, even though he\u2019s obviously my child.\u201dMonster. Perhaps my brother looked back to make the evidence more obvious as a finishing touch. However, I had mixed feelings about how it felt if my parent said that I was a monster.\u201cThen I got divorced right away. They said I wasn\u2019t obliged to pay the damage payment, but my place to live suddenly disappeared, and my parents died early. When I was in disarray, my sister helped me up. That child\u2019s parents\u2019 house is in the prefecture, but I got permission to stay within the prefecture.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201cBut to think that he has a stepsister now\u2026 Are you a junior high school student now?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m in the second year of junior high school.\u201d\u201cThis is just a little advice for you, it\u2019s better if you go to a boarding high school outside the prefecture. And you better stay away from Makoto. If he realizes that you know his true nature, he will turn your life upside down.\u201d\u201c\u2026That might be true, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201dI vaguely reply. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 you\u2026\u201d my brother\u2019s mother said with a surprised face.\u201cI might not be able to change his nature, but I just hope at least he won\u2019t hurt or kill people. I don\u2019t know if I actually can do that\u2026 but I definitely want to do something about it.\u201dBefore I knew his true nature, I liked my brother to the point I wanted to marry him. I might lose that feeling when I knew that he would become the mastermind murderer in the future, but I still treasure those times that I spent together with him all this time. And there are also the lives of his classmates. I can\u2019t just run away alone.Listening to my statement, my brother\u2019s mother\u2019s face looks complicated. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s actually a kind person because she cares about me, the person who suddenly appeared and claims to be her son\u2019s stepsister, to the point she warns me about his true nature. After talking for a while, I left the store afternoon.\u25c7I approached grandpa\u2019s car and knocked on the window. As soon as I got into the car, I immediately inquire about the question I\u2019d been wondering about today.\u201cOjii-chan, you were 80% sure that Onii-chan wasn\u2019t actually abused, so you sent me to see her, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cBecause Ojii-chan is always kind and worried about me. Even though you gave me a modified security buzzer, you still wouldn\u2019t let me go to meet someone who abuse a child alone, right?\u201d\u201cSo, it\u2019s because I\u2019m overly doting you, huh?\u201dGrandpa laughs like a child who got his prank exposed. But I continuedly to say, \u201cbut it\u2019s not only that.\u201d\u201cYou were supposed to have an injury, but you are trying to drive, it was too unnatural. And you said that you fell from stairs*, but the hospital said you collapsed*? Usually, if you fell from stairs and fainted*, they will say the same thing as what you said, right? So, which is true?\u201d(*I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t find better wording for this, Mai said two different words, one is \u2018fell down\u2019 \u843d\u3061\u305f, means to slip down or fell from stairs, and the other is \u2018collapsed\u2019 \u5012\u308c\u305f, which means he lost consciousness, in sickbed, or in critical condition. When she said, \u2018fell from stairs and fainted\u2019, means he lost consciousness but not dangerous way. In short, Mai is pointing the fact that the hospital and grandpa\u2019s story does not match up.)\u201c\u2026the thing about me collapsed, it was two months ago. It wasn\u2019t recently\u2026 I wonder if it\u2019s because I collapsed at the wrong place.\u201d\u201cBut if you collapse at this season, you might freeze to death.\u201d\u201cNah, it\u2019s a place with many people pass by, but the garbage trucks that collect garbage only come there at fixed times though.\u201d(No, don\u2019t ask me, this is so confusing that two translators were dead from laughter in wonder why does the garbage truck have a cameo here\u2026)\u201c\u2026Two months ago, was it when you discover the thing in your brain?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why I will have surgery next month. The doctor says that although the probabilities are low, the chances of me going crazy aren\u2019t zero. So, while I\u2019m still sane, at least I want to make sure about Makoto\u2019s mother. But then again, I thought it was better for you to go and confirm, rather than me.\u201d\u201cWhy me\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou are really attached to Makoto. So, I thought I should let you know the danger. I thought you won\u2019t believe it if I just told you. So, I think it\u2019s better if you talk to a person who had experienced it once even in a roundabout way. But when I saw you in the bathroom this morning, I was surprised because there was a clear distance between you and Makoto.\u201dIndeed, I just learned that my brother was a psychopath this summer. Before that, I was so obsessed with my brother, no matter what grandpa said, I won\u2019t believe he was dangerous. So, grandpa took the trouble to pretend he fell and summoned us, so I can meet my brother\u2019s mother. However, some doubts still remain. When did Grandpa think that my brother wasn\u2019t actually abused by his mother?\u201cWhen did you realize that Onii-chan wasn\u2019t being abused by his mother?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have any particular chance to. However, I just couldn\u2019t forget the eyes of Makoto\u2019s mother, who called Makoto a monster. Besides, Obaa-san seems to have hit Takayuki once.\u201d\u201cObaa-chan?\u201d\u201cOh. At that time, I was working abroad, and Obaa-san took care of Takayuki alone. But one day I got a call from Obaa-san who told me to help her. I went back to Japan in hurry, afraid if something went wrong, I found Takayuki who seems have been beaten, crying.\u201d\u201cI see, so that had happened\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that Obaa-san\u2019s eyes were different from Makoto\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes, and maybe Obaa-san thought, \u2018maybe that might happen to Takayuki too back then\u2019, so she couldn\u2019t forgive Makoto\u2019s mother and tried to protect Makoto more. The more I think about it, the more I believe that he\u2019s not normal. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s just an old man intuition.\u201d\u201cOjii-chan\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd when I had to go to work, I showed a movie to Makoto, but he always rewinding the part where people are dying all the time. Because Takayuki was a quiet child, I thought Makoto might be like that too. But after you came to the family, I started to think differently.\u201dThe fact that comparing me with my brother made grandpa think that my brother\u2019s behaviour was strange might mean that grandpa was not aware of my brother\u2019s true nature in the manga.\u201cI wonder if Onii-chan and I are really different.\u201d\u201cThe eyes and laughter are obviously different from a normal child. I have no evidence, it\u2019s just my intuition. But a month from now, when I did my surgery, that intuition may disappear. I might think so because at that time there is a tumour in my head. But before that happened, I had to do something.\u201dSomehow the urgency can be felt because grandpa was afraid that he would think differently after his surgery.\u201cHey, Mai. What do you think of Makoto? Does Ojii-chan\u2019s thought wrong?\u201d\u201cI also have the same thought with Ojii-chan. Nothing is wrong. I think it\u2019s correct.\u201dI think my brother is really the kind of person that grandpa and his real mom thought. He likes to hurt and manipulate people as he likes, and he\u2019s not interested in people\u2019s feelings. But that person is also my brother.\u201cOjii-chan, I\u2019ll do something about Onii-chan, so I want you to have surgery with confidence and get well fast.\u201dI said that straightforwardly without hesitation, after a while grandpa laughed as if amazed.\u201cYou really like your Onii-chan and this Ojii-chan, huh? Me and Makoto are happy to hear that.\u201d\u201cOjii-chan aside, is Onii-chan really happy?\u201d\u201cOh, he\u2019s smart. He\u2019ll be able to live alone. But he feels different from a normal human being. It\u2019s loneliness. So, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s better for him to have someone like you who can accept everything.\u201dLive alone. When I think about it, certainly, he can live alone.When my parents went out and two of us stay at home, my brother does everything flawlessly. I\u2019ve never seen anything that he\u2019s not good at.A brother who does anything perfectly. For some existences that can accept my brother\u2026 I think there might be many. Such a person can be a lover or something like that.My brother looked at dad and mom in a cold atmosphere. And he looked at me as if I\u2019m a hindrance.He has a lot of friends, and although he has been liked by his surrounding, I\u2019ve never seen him showing an act of kindness.\u201c\u2026When we get home, you will be going out with Onii-chan, right?\u201d\u201cYea. I have to be careful not to be killed.\u201d\u201cStop it, it\u2019s not even a laughing matter.\u201dGrandpa started the engine and the car begin to move. Without exchanging words, I look at the rapidly changing scenery in a daze.Someone who will understand my brother\u2026 Certainly, just this morning, I heard about the same topic from my brother. However, neither friends nor lovers can suddenly be able to understand him. Humans are not like clay or cloth that can be created.All I can provide to him are just surprises. It\u2019s not working very well, though.\u201cAh, Ojii-chan, is there a hardware store around here?\u201d\u201cYep, there\u2019s a big store ahead. Do you want to go there?\u201d\u201cYes, please! I have something I want to do.\u201dLooking at the distant sky, I thought about my brother.\u25c7T/N: Whew, didn\u2019t expect it took this long to translate this peculiar chapter. This chapter revealed a lot of things and Makoto\u2019s mom\u2019s story got me in tears. Makoto has been such a person since he\u2019s a child whew.Okay, I always broke any promises I said, so I won\u2019t promise anymore. See you on the next chap which Idk when will be posted, hopefully soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay256 DAYS AGO(This is Makoto\u2019s POV)My grandfather collapsed. What I felt when I heard that was the expectation that I might see a person close to death. However, it seems that humans did not die easily unless their hearts were pierced by a knife. It\u2019s the same as that Nojima, even though I thought I could see people dying.After spending more than three hours riding car to grandfather\u2019s house, we were welcomed by grandfather, who had bandages just on head and arms.\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I drive, my hands are itchy!\u201dWith that said, grandfather who looks happy, push me to the passenger seat and drives. A day after my family hurried back to grandfather\u2019s house, he selfishly decided to go out with Mai in the morning, and me in the afternoon. Without knowing where we are going, I sit in the car.My parents divorced when I was 5, and I lived in grandparents\u2019 house for about 5 years. That\u2019s why my relationship with this grandfather should be good, but no matter what, sitting beside him while he drives is too much. This grandfather doesn\u2019t behave like his age, his voice is loud, and he cannot read the mood well. If he\u2019s the same age as me, far from being harmonious, it will be horrifying. Rather than me, Mai, who is not blood-related, was more suitable and looks like grandfather\u2019s real family. Even this morning, I was irritated by her who keep defending grandfather.\u201cYou are soon to be a high school student, huh. Time surely flows so fast.\u201d\u201cWell, only if I passed the exam, though.\u201dA long time ago, when I was young, there was \u2018an existence\u2019 who lived near my house and was in the same kindergarten as mine. \u2018Its\u2019 personality was wild, active, liked to run around, and \u2018its\u2019 favourite plaything was the rotating playground set. \u2018It\u2019 didn\u2019t bring any harm to anyone, but \u2018its\u2019 arm happened to be caught in the playground set. I heard the news that \u2018its\u2019 arm needs to be amputated, so I guided \u2018it\u2019 to cut its own arm.As a result, I was warned by my blood-related mother. That mother started an excessive interference and kept any cutlery away from me. I thought that would be an obstacle to my future life, so I decided to discard that mother.It took a lot of work in the process, but after that, it was easy to eliminate that mother, and I was glad that the risk of getting exposed is low. But for some reason, I felt that this grandfather is somehow being cautious of me.I don\u2019t feel any threat because he\u2019s just an old man with unreliable thinking ability. Also, I was told that he would have brain surgery next month. But there is certainly an uncomfortable feeling.\u201cI\u2019m sure you will pass. You\u2019re the smartest kid I\u2019ve ever met. It was worth feeding you fish every day.\u201dToday, this grandfather continues his useless talk. Even without studying as much as usual, I will still be accepted in high school.\u201cDo you have someone you like?\u201d\u201cSomeone I like?\u201d\u201cAre you not going out with someone? Isn\u2019t it the time for kids your age to date or be rejected? Have you been confessed by someone?\u201dWhen grandfather said that, I suddenly remembered something like that happened last week\u2026 I was confessed by a girl student who often asks about study\u2019s material in class.However, it will be annoying if I just affirm it without much thought, so I answered, \u201cno\u201d.\u201cWith your handsome face, no one did? Even though you have all the good points from Takayuki too.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel like the people around me are thinking about that yet. Also, we have an exam.\u201dActually, because there is an exam, the people around me are struggling to make memories. Because it might be the last time to meet, while saying that, they confessed to the person they liked. It can be called a kind of trend around my age. Just like a disease, it spreads and there seems no sign of an end.Some girls from my school came to me as if asking to be baptized, but when they act friendly to me, the first thing that came to my mind was that I hate it because it\u2019s annoying.It might be easy to say I do not like it, but if I said so, they would cry, and my reputation will plummet. One-sided emotions are actually violence only towards the person who received it.\u201cI hope you will bring your lover here when you\u2019re already in high school\u2026\u201d Grandfather murmured softly.I have no interest in romance. When I watch TV, people have the knowledge about love in many different ways to some extent.But even if it were me, I can\u2019t imagine myself being fond of or wanting to fall in love with someone. Will I be able to do so? In the first place, I can\u2019t even acknowledge this grandfather, the existence who drives besides me, as someone who is in the same level and species as mine.Somehow, I feel like I\u2019m looking at the people around me as creatures from a world different from my own. Is it possible to build a romance with such an existence?And it seems people decide whether they like the person or not, based on their \u2018face\u2019, but to me, they all look the same. It\u2019s the same with animals too. If I really have to differentiate them, I will only assign numbers to them.After all, if I peel off their skins, everyone will be the same, so why people are attached to others to that extent? I can\u2019t understand.\u201cI wonder\u2026 what if I unexpectedly can\u2019t find anyone even after I become a university student?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! That\u2019s impossible!\u201dA loud laughter echoes in the car. I wonder If I push the steering wheel and force the car to crash into the utility pole, will this irritation be eased? When I was frustrated by his voice\u2019s volume that was not suitable for a conversation, grandfather looked far away while saying, \u201cI wonder if Mai will bring her boyfriend someday. I think I will beat him up.\u201dThose eyes.It was his eyes that I didn\u2019t like the most. Even though he is an old man who would die if I pushed him down a hill, but sometimes his eyes look like he knew everything.\u201cAre you doing well with Mai?\u201d\u201cWhat? Suddenly\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, you suddenly got a non-blood-related younger sister. A child from your new parent\u2019s previous marriage to boot. Because it\u2019s you, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll bully her, but I wonder what you think of her.\u201dHe said that sharply as if he wants to slash me. What do I think of my sister?The answer is simple. I don\u2019t think of anything.I don\u2019t even care if she dies tomorrow. But I know it\u2019s not appropriate to answer so honestly.No matter what the question, that kind of answer is always incorrect.\u201cShe\u2019s a good sister.\u201d\u201cA good sister? Like what?\u201dA sister who won\u2019t take my hand, but also not a hindrance to me. But in this world value, I don\u2019t think Mai is a good sister.No one likes a sister who often do mischief repeatedly and dives into a pond when she sees one.It\u2019s worrying and time-consuming.Mai, who dives into the pond, instead of collecting insects.\u201cHmm, to put it simply, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get tired of watching her. She listens well when being told, she did her best on her study, she even get along well with some weird people.\u201d(He\u2019s talking about Yukari-chan lol)Mai, who buries herself inside a hole. Mai, who did soundproofing properly when she\u2019s doing things in her room with loud volume. So, I can just block the sound if I put on earplugs.When I think about it, Mai\u2019s actions are really flashy, but as she never harms me, it\u2019s not bothersome. It\u2019s always like that. That\u2019s what I can\u2019t understand from Mai. Even though some of her behaviours can be considered rude, she never harms anyone.It feels like she\u2019s just trying to cause trouble in front of me, while only letting herself get hurt in the process. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand Mai, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Because it\u2019s also her unpleasant and creepy point.\u201cWell, I\u2019m relieved if you guys are on good terms. Because it looked like there was some distance between you both. I\u2019m glad if it\u2019s not the case.\u201dAfter saying that, grandfather turned the wheel and said, \u201clet\u2019s go to a family restaurant!\u201dMai is a good sister to me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad sister. At least I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to eliminate her.For now.\u25c7In the end, grandfather is really a selfish person. When he took me to the family restaurant, he said I could choose anything I like. But he one-sidedly adds a parfait to the hamburger set that I chose appropriately.Since the set I chose already has the ice cream in the first place, it overlaps with the parfait. On the other hand, grandfather quickly finished his\u00a0zosui\u00a0and talks non-stop while I was eating, which was annoying. Then after spending a torture-like time, it was time to go home.\u201cIt was fun, let\u2019s go out again next time.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI would never go again with him if possible. He said he\u2019s going to have surgery next month, and he will need to do rehabilitation too. We probably won\u2019t meet again for another six months. I had enough for today.When I looked at the view from the window, the dark sky is dyed red by the sunset. The snow that piled up on the ground also seems to be dyed red. Perhaps grandfather was tired of talking, he was quiet on the ride home.\u201cOK, we\u2019ve arrived.\u201dGradually the car slowed down and grandfather stopped in front of the house. He gave me the cake box we bought from the family restaurant earlier while saying, \u201cI will park the car in the garage, so take this to the refrigerator.\u201d\u201cAll right\u201dI got out of the car with the box in my hand. Perhaps because of the heater inside the car, the dry and chilly temperature on the outside really hit me hard. My fingertips immediately went numb, so I hurried my legs. There is a big snowman near the entrance. Probably Mai made it. Even though she\u2019s almost become a third year of middle school, what is she thinking? When I was thinking so, on the next moment\u2026\u201cWaaaaaaaaaahh!!!\u201dAs if crushing the snowman near the entrance, while wearing a helmet and armour, Mai appeared. From the voice, it seems to be Mai. It seems she was standing behind the snowman all this time. She walked towards me while making metal clinking sounds.\u201cWhoa, Mai. Did you borrow Grandpa\u2019s armour without permission? Isn\u2019t it expensive?\u201d\u201cI have permission.\u201dThen, was grandfather being quiet before on purpose to lead me into this? As I held myself from sighing, grandfather came from behind me happily.\u201cOh, Mai, how is the armour?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really heavy\u2026 and it\u2019s impossible to wear it in summer. Even now it\u2019s still hot, I\u2019m almost die in sweat.\u201d\u201cThen let me clean it up, go take a bath.\u201dAnd the two of them are laughing like a real family. How annoying. I entered the house with a dampened mood.\u25c7T/N: tbh with you, even though it\u2019s exciting to be able to see inside Makoto\u2019s mind, his POV is really annoying to translate. because he never really use subjects and never really claim someone as \u2018his kin\u2019. Mai calls his grandpa\u00a0\u2018Ojii-chan\u2019, both in her inner thought and when she spoke to him, it means grandpa in a familiar way. But Makoto called him\u00a0\u2018Sofu\u2019, in his inner thought, it means grandfather and it sounds formal, distant, and old as if talking about other person\u2019s grandpa. Would it be easier to understand if I change it into\u00a0\u2018old man\u2019\u00a0instead? What do you guys think?The same happened when he talked about his friend from the same kindergarten, he called\u00a0\u2018it\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018such existence\u2019\u00a0not\u00a0\u2018he\u2019. luckily, he always describes Mai as \u2018Mai\u2019.but that aside, it\u2019s funny to see how annoyed Makoto is towards his grandpa, and he also seems annoyed that Mai defends his grandpa more than him lol.Just heads up, I will be busy drawing for an upcoming event on behalf of my group (ChocoCats), so I don\u2019t know when I will post the next chapter, hopefully soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u25cb 256 DAYS AGOI tried to recreate the way grandpa surprised me in the past, but it didn\u2019t work, so I decided to carry out the next strategy.It\u2019s 10 pm. My parents already sleep soundly, but my brother is probably still awake.I quietly get out of my room and take out the thing I bought from the hardware store. I stood on the\u00a0engawa\u00a0in front of my brother\u2019s room. When I opened the shoji door little by little, my brother was looking at his smartphone in the dark.\u201cCha-cha-cha-Onii-chan~!\u201dEven when I call him out with a shrill voice, my brother didn\u2019t even flinch.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m want to show you something!\u201dIt will be cold because of the outside air, so I put the blanket I borrowed from grandpa on my brother\u2019s futon. Then I went back to the garden and set what I had prepared. After I ignited the matchstick, my prepared rocket fireworks launched into the sky.\u201c\u2026 huh?\u201dThe fireworks rise steadily in the sky with a popping sound. I bought fireworks at the hardware store thinking he might actually never see fireworks on snow before.I can\u2019t do it at our home because it might bother the neighbours, but in here, between the houses has quite a distance. So, I can only do it here. My brother probably will find human corpses more beautiful than the fireworks, but he will love the moment when something is burning.\u201cLook, fireworks! There is a lot!\u201dI ignited fireworks one after another. The light colour changed and sparkles like rain. The sight of sparks falling on the pilled snow is very beautiful. As if he was attracted to the fireworks, he stood on the porch with a blanket on his shoulder. This may be a good reaction.\u201cAmazing, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\u201cThe fire is roaring!\u201d\u201c\u2018Roaring\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dMy brother smiled bitterly, but it\u2019s not a bad reaction. It may be a good little experience. I picked up one\u00a0fountain stick firework\u00a0that I was going to use and gave it to my brother.\u201cOnii-chan take one too!\u201d\u201cMe too?\u201d\u201cYeah! Here, I\u2019ll light it!\u201dMy brother is staring at the bursting fireworks, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be interested\u2026. or not? It\u2019s a subtle feeling, but I think it\u2019s better than the reaction so far.\u201cFufufu~\u201d\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201dWhen I said that while laughing, my brother turned his firework to me.\u201cHey! It\u2019s dangerous!! No way! Are you crazy?!\u201dIt\u2019s a dangerous act. Don\u2019t try this at home. It is even written in the fireworks manual that pointing a firework towards people is dangerous. When I protested, my brother laughed, \u201cI didn\u2019t aim you.\u201d I was sure he was going to aim it towards me. I should take note to never give my brother a fountain stick firework, He might burn me to death.\u201cThat\u2019s what all pyromaniacs said. Scary, you are crazy. Okay, no more fountain fireworks. Here, take\u00a0sparkler.\u201dI gave a sparkler that seemed to be less lethal to my brother. The flame burns like a small lantern with frizzling sound. Watching my brother\u2019s sparkle made me wants it too, so I stopped igniting the rocket fireworks and I picked up another sparkler.\u201cHey, let\u2019s compete to see which one extinguish first.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unfair, isn\u2019t it? Mine will die soon.\u201dEven though he said so, he doesn\u2019t look dissatisfied. After I said, \u201cThe one whose firework extinguish first will have to listen to the other\u2019s request once.\u201d\u201cWhat would you do if Onii-chan win?\u201d\u201cI wonder. Maybe\u2026 for you to not dive into the pond again?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t dived into pond anymore lately.\u201dTechnically, I can\u2019t dive into the pond because it froze in winter, but on another side, my brother seems bored with it. Also, I haven\u2019t dived into the pond recently because it\u2019s inefficient. After I jumped, I have to take a bath and wasted a lot of time.\u201cThen what about Mai?\u201d\u201cI want Onii-chan\u2019s free-pass ticket for a day.\u201dAnd I will take him somewhere on the day of the death game. In short, it\u2019s kidnapping. Even though I don\u2019t intend to use any violence, but when push comes to shove, I will use any means.\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfair?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair. Ah, nooo!!!\u201dWhile I was replying to my brother, my firework died off with a plop. Even though my brother\u2019s firework was supposed to be died off first. When I was dumbfounded, my brother looked at me with a satisfied face.\u201cWhat kind of request should I give you~?\u201d\u201cOnly apply to things I can do, ok? Because I can\u2019t do things like giving money.\u201d\u201cAlright. Hmm, what should I ask, I wonder~?\u201dMy brother says so and pretends to ponder about it. It might be just my thought, but maybe he didn\u2019t have any expectations of me. In the first place, people who only do as said are just like a doll and can\u2019t take any initiative themselves. Well, I feel sad when I think about it\u2026\u201cWell, just tell me another time. It will still be valid until next year, or another year.\u201d\u201cOh, is it fine?\u201dMy brother smiled at my words, \u201cthen, I will think about it carefully.\u201d His smile, as always, still feels deep.But somehow, I can see my brother who received my surprises, has changed. I still want to be with my brother next year and next, next year. So that grandpa can feel at ease too. With firm determination, I gazed up at the night sky with my brother.\u25c7T/N: Hey, long time no see, sorry for the late update. A lot to say but I don\u2019t have much time right now, so, enjoy the chapter!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s sad, but I still need to go to school tomorrow. Just before we leave, I promised grandpa that I would come to play again next New Year.He asked me about my upcoming exam, but I can study at grandpa\u2019s house, so it\u2019s fine. Besides, he\u2019s about to have surgery next month, and I don\u2019t know if there will be next year for him, so I wanted to make a future promise with grandpa. The timing is just right.I play with my smartphone in the back seat of the car while my brother is flipping through his notes beside me. I shouldn\u2019t bother him while he\u2019s studying. In addition, currently, my mom is sitting in the passenger seat beside my dad who is driving. It will be bad if I got scolded for disturbing my brother\u2019s study and get grounded again.Last week, because diving into the pond during this time is too cold, I prepared dozens of balloons and dived from the roof towards the garden. After that, I used carbon dioxide to make a rainbow-coloured fountain in the garden. It was peaceful until I made a big decision to attach a rocket made from a plastic bottle on my back and fly across the river. I got grounded for a week as result.While I was thinking about what to do, my brother put his book on the seat beside him and began to look outside. His study time seems to be over.\u201cOnii-chan, do you want a drink?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt really tastes good and is perfect for people who are studying for exams!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s kind of suspicious.\u201dMy brother looks at me with a troubled face in front of my parents, but he actually would be happy if I really brought something dangerous, as he can use it to torture insects and other animals. I took out the plastic bottle from my bag and gave it to my brother.\u201cHere, water, fresh from the source.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it dirty?\u201dMy brother, who understands my joke, opened the bottle\u2019s lid. In a second, butterflies pop out with a sudden force. Because it\u2019s made from plastic, it\u2019s more like spurting out than flickering. My brother who seems already predicted that, didn\u2019t look surprised, and returned the butterflies to me. My mother saw that and immediately warn me to not joke around.\u201cI\u2019m not, I just want Onii-chan to have a break.\u201d\u201cNo more excuses. Look, we will have lunch at that family restaurant, so just stay still until then.\u201dMy mother basically treats me like a kid who is fussy because of hunger. But it\u2019s a little past 12 o\u2019clock now, and because I ate breakfast at 5 o\u2019clock with grandpa, now I\u2019m hungry. The surprise goods\u2019 stock was depleted too, so I stay obediently. When we approached a crossroad, my father suddenly made a strange groan.\u201cNo good. The family restaurant\u2019s parking lot is under construction to make a multi-storey car park. It says that I should park after the right turn. I\u2019ll go to park the car for a while, so three of you can go to the family restaurant first.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dMy mother nodded and the three of us got out of the car. After we saw off my father who went to the parking lot, we head to the family restaurant.\u201cBy the way, didn\u2019t Onii-chan go to the family restaurant with grandpa last time? What did you eat there?\u201d\u201cHamburger lunch set.\u201d\u201cAnd today?\u201d\u201cSame.\u201d\u201cYou really love hamburgers, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dMy brother actually does not have a particular interest in food. Because he doesn\u2019t have any particular like or dislike, I can put a variety of foods for his bento lunch easily. but it\u2019s a little frustrating that I can\u2019t pack his favourites foods in a box to provide both surprise and joy. After walking for a while to the family restaurant, I saw a parking lot that seems to be under construction on the other side of the big traffic light.While I was thinking that we will arrive soon, the moment the construction site was reflected in my field of vision, I suddenly feel a chill on my spine.The building under construction is a three-story building. It\u2019s a multi-storey car park, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible to renovate. However, it was very similar to the background setting of the scene when the cat I read in the manga was run over.\u2015\u2015Don\u2019t tell me, it wasn\u2019t a station building, but a parking lot construction site\u2026?When I think about it, the television screen panel attached to the station building was not described in the manga. I thought maybe because it was too bothersome to be drawn, but if it was a parking lot drawing in the first place, of course, screen panels are unnecessary. Besides, the traffic lights in this city all looks the same. This crossroad is no different from the background setting I saw in the manga\u2026\u201cHey, why don\u2019t we go through a pedestrian bridge instead of here?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Isn\u2019t it a detour?\u201dMother sounds shocked. When I look towards my brother, he was being absent-minded.Strange. When in the presence of my mother, my brother will definitely act as a good son and pay attention to me. Following his line of sight, a white cat was seen scratching its head in the corner of the sidewalk.As expected, if the cat just stays there, it won\u2019t be run over, right? Jumping into the street from here means suicide. There are many cars on the street, even cats can notice the noise. It won\u2019t jump out to such a place, right?The moment when I thought so\u2026The white cat that was scratching its head suddenly jumped toward the centre of the road. As if waiting for the moment, on the other side of the road, a truck rushed in.It will run over the cat.On the spur of moment, I kicked the ground. From the back, I heard my mother cry, \u201cMai!\u201d with a voice like a scream. Fortunately, I was able to catch up to the cat in the centre without being run over by any car. I frantically tried to reach the cat.\u201cUh? No way.\u201dHowever, as if to avoid me, the cat ran to the opposite sidewalk and disappeared into the residential area.The cat will not be run over by this. And my brother won\u2019t have to die either. No, I mean\u2026 \u2014The moment I was thinking so, a truck lamp came into my view. The horn honked with a roaring sound. As soon as the big impact hit my body, in the corner of my eyes, I saw my brother.\u201cOnii-cha\u2026\u201dI feel my body floating as I\u2019m being pushed out into the sky. Ah, it feels the same as when I was doing bungee at the balcony\u2026 As soon as I felt that the scenery rotated and fell, my field of vision became pitch black. And then, I feel my body sink into somewhere messily.\u25c7T/N: Belated Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2022!!! I\u2019m very sorry for my own lack of skill to manage my time, I didn\u2019t finish everything according to my plan, it\u2019s super super late, please forgive me. Here are new chapters!

While feeling unknown discomfort, I opened my eyes to see the familiar scene from my previous life \u2014the hospital\u2019s ceiling.\u201cWhy\u2026?\u201dWhen I looked to my side, my mother looked surprised. \u201cMai!\u201d She called me while reaching her hands to my bedside. I think she\u2019s pushing the nurse call button. I thought of it vaguely, but my guess seems to be correct, as a nurse immediately rushed in.\u201cMy daughter\u2019s consciousness has returned!\u201d\u201cI understand. I will call the doctor right away.\u201dAs soon as she saw me, the nurse rushed out quickly. Now that I think about it clearly, I was run over by a truck. I\u2019m probably being hospitalized. But somehow, my body is working fine, and there is no evidence of any fractures. There are some scratches on my palm, but\u2026When I looked at my mother\u2019s face, her face looks like she almost burst into tears, \u201cyou didn\u2019t wake up for three days!\u201d\u201cUhm, where is Onii-chan\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe went to school. He has been in the hospital room all the time. Because taking 3 days off straight is not allowed, I have to send him to school\u2026\u201d\u201cOnii-chan did\u2026?\u201dI wonder\u2026 Were he waiting for me to die\u2026? But the cat didn\u2019t die\u2026 And my body isn\u2019t messed up or there isn\u2019t any lots of blood coming out or my condition going worse\u2026\u201cMom, I\u2026 what really happened when I was run over\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy do you ask me that? Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I just wish there is no photos taken and spread on the internet or something\u2026\u201dAfter I said that, my mother seems to understand and opened her lips.\u201cYou were thrown out and fell exactly at the garbage dump\u2026 I was worried because you only have some scratches, you might have internal bleeding inside your head\u2026 But the test results were normal. Only bruises on your arms and legs. And you just didn\u2019t regain consciousness for three days.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201dBut receiving some scratches is better than seeing a cat being run over. The moment I was thrown into the trash can was questionable\u2026 but it\u2019s better than having a lot of blood splattered. As soon as I feel relieved, the doctor came. Because I had to undergo various tests, I left the room with a wheelchair that was prepared before.\u25c7T/N: Short chapter, the next chapter will be posted soon, I\u2019m working on it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, I think I might have been unharmed even after I was hit by a truck because I need to fulfil that role.I couldn\u2019t doubt that, as I was discharged from the hospital with a surprisingly normal test result from the doctor. My mother was worried, so she wished me to be hospitalized more, but the hospital couldn\u2019t hospitalize a person with no injuries all the time, so I was discharged three days after I woke up.\u201cMai, you should take a break from school until next week. Just because you\u2019re discharged, don\u2019t go wild and stay at home.\u201dMy mother who drives the car home told me. Today is Saturday, so it\u2019s a full holiday from Monday to Friday next week. Two days ago, Yukari-chan and Iwai came to show me the notes I missed while I was not at school, so I\u2019m not worried about the class, but I\u2019m more worried about my brother.Mother said that my brother always stayed in the hospital room before I woke up. But after I woke up, he seemed to be relieved and went back to study for the exam, so the last conversation I had with my brother was just before the accident. I even haven\u2019t been able to offer a surprise for the past week.Well, I stopped the cat\u2019s death. But instead, I was blown away by a truck and became a miracle survivor. There is no open wound or blood spilt, it\u2019s surprising.I had a near-death experience, and it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for a type of person who kills 38 people has changed to the type of person who saves people.As I was looking forward to seeing my brother again, the familiar scenery began to appear in the window of the car. After a while, the speed of the car gradually slowed down and finally stopped.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived. Mom will take care of all the luggage, so go inside first.\u201d\u201cOkayy!\u201dI received the key from my mother and opened the door to my house. It would be boring to say loudly \u201cOnii-chan, I\u2019m home!\u201d as it is, so I rang the bell repeatedly.\u201cOnii-chan! I\u2019m home! I\u2019m home I\u2019m home I\u2019m home I\u2019m home!\u201dWas my voice drowned by the bell ring or vice versa? When I called my brother while being careful not to bother the neighbourhood, I heard footsteps from the stairs going down.From the stair\u2019s landing, I can see the slender legs of my brother. Eventually, my brother with his face lowered came.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with the check-up! Full health! I came back safe and sound\u2026\u201dWhen I saw my brother\u2019s raised face, I almost stopped breathing. The eyes peeking through the gaps in the straight bangs felt horrifying. His eyes gave an expression that I had never seen in the manga that made me froze.\u201c\u2026\u2026why\u201dA cold voice echoed in the foyer. His voice isn\u2019t that loud, but it echoes violently in my eardrum. When I asked, \u201cwhat is\u2026\u201d at the same time, my brother grabbed my wrist.\u201cWhy are you smiling happily\u2026?\u201dThe pitch-black eyes that were so haunting and as if trying to devour, captured me. I immediately guessed it. Until now, my brother recognized me as if I\u2019m just a background prop. But now, he\u2019s aware of my presence. Whether he\u2019s trying to kill me or is it because he wants to see me dying.\u201c\u2026\u2026Onii-chan\u201dWhen I cautiously called him while touching his hand that grabbed my wrist, my brother back to his senses. He frowned, realizing he scared me and backs away.\u201cOnii-chan?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing. Go rest. Even though you just got discharged from the hospital, you were run over by a car.\u201dMy brother\u2019s face returns to his usual face. Then he turned his back.I\u2019m sure something has changed completely now. But it didn\u2019t seem like a good change\u2026I froze in front of the foyer, couldn\u2019t even enter the house until my mother who brought the luggage from the car called me out.\u25c7That night, the unpleasant premonition I felt vaguely was right. Until now, my brother has always been careful not to make his footsteps loud when he wants to open his insect collection so that my parents didn\u2019t wake up. But tonight, he went to the garden clumsily without concealing the sound of his quick steps.That\u2019s why I\u2019m flattening my face to the window and trying to watch my brother. But the distance between the first and second floor is wider than I expected, so I still can\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing.I can only see him crouching on the porch, and occasionally moving his arms. When I look closely, my brother stood up and went back inside. What the hell are you doing\u2026I waited for my brother to return to his room. To make it safe, I waited for 1 hour before I went downstairs. Until now, my brother always concealed his footsteps so that my parents would never know his hobby.But today, his footsteps of going down the stairs was clearly heard, even the sound of the door leading to the garden echoed. Curiously, I head to the porch and reach for my brother\u2019s collection.Recently\u2026 until the accident happened, because I thought the day when the cat will be run over is near, I checked my brother\u2019s collection almost every day. I think it would be nice if it had decreased compared to before, but there is a possibility that it has increased after the accident\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2026\u201dI made up my mind and opened the box\u2014 a sight I had never imagined; my head went blank.Until last week, the corpses were evenly arranged. Like documenting his killing and showing my brother\u2019s sensitivity.But now.As if they just received all hatred, the creatures were crushed together with the box.\u25c7T/N: Hmm, no promise for when I will be updating but hopefully soon! See you in the next chapter!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she jumped from the veranda with just a lifeline rope attached, I was expecting it to become extreme as she spins around.Next time, I might see the time when the rope breaks and her head fall off.I imagined her arm is breaking when I saw her jump with dozens of balloons inflated with an air pump tied on her back, and her body limps because of her arm\u2019s injury.When she made a rocket from a plastic bottle, put it on her back, and tried to fly over the river, even if she fell into the river and died, I won\u2019t even care.It\u2019s not that I want her to die, but I want to see her figure of dying. Back then, I was thinking about the life and death of my sister with such feelings, but now it seems different.[Thank you for watching Mai today. You have to take a good rest, too.]I sigh when I see the message sent by the mother. It\u2019s been two days since Mai was run over by a truck. Even though there were no big injuries and only scratches, there isn\u2019t any indication for Mai to wake up at all.Usually, I will reply with a sensible response. Even though she is in-law, moderately liked by this mother has no disadvantages. But somehow, I just replied \u201calright\u201d and threw my smartphone to the bed.Outside the window, it\u2019s already dark, and the clock is pointing at midnight. The father is at work, and the mother is attending Mai in the hospital. I thought it was better to move fast before the father returned, so I went downstairs.On the day of the incident, I was expecting it. When the white cat jumped in front of me and tried to pass the intersection, I thought that I would see the moment when it got crushed and messed up.I\u2019m sure the body fluids will overflow, dyeing its furs all at once. The bright red on a white background would look great. I remembered the excitement from deep in my heart boiling up quietly, and I was happy knowing the cat\u2019s existence was going to lose.However, it was Mai who was run over.It\u2019s been three days since then, and now I\u2019m going down the stairs in my house, but the scene at that time doesn\u2019t disappear from my head.Her back goes straight to the centre of the intersection. My hand that tried to reach Mai cuts the air. Her body that is hit by a truck and dances in the air, won\u2019t respond even if I called as red flows from her forehead.Thus, even when I went down the stairs, I remembered that moment, making my legs stop. I shook my head even though I know it was useless and left the front door.I couldn\u2019t understand Mai\u2019s action. But now, I don\u2019t even understand myself. It seems terribly frightening, and I rush towards the garden.I hate the fact I was hopeless when Mai was hit by the truck. And I didn\u2019t like Mai being run over.I\u2019m not sure whether I dislike Mai dying or her being run over. The mental pain I felt for the first time is extremely terrifying. I feel like I\u2019ve been transformed unwillingly, it hurts, so hurts, I feel sick.I desperately reached for the collection hidden under the porch. The sooner I kill everything, the better my chest will feel.I open the box while thinking so. Inside the box, there were many insects, those who were barely alive while being stabbed by nails, those who tried to overcome hunger by eating each other, and many other insects, desperately trying to stay alive.Until now, looking at the contents of the box will make my fatigue and troubles washed away. But now I couldn\u2019t calm down at all. The pain also doesn\u2019t stop.Mai looked towards me just before being hit by a truck. That innocent, naive face of her is etched inside my head and never leaves.After the fall, even though her face is white as a sheet, the vivid red on her forehead remains forever.The sound of loud horn and the moment Mai\u2019s body was slowly being hit as if her flesh and bones were being crushed, kept repeating and eating me away inside.I want to disperse such thoughts, so I slam my fist toward the box. As my hand slowly got wet, the creatures inside were crushed. Usually, I will feel excited, but every time I lost the excitement, my body got colder, and the memory when Mai was run over became clearer, I even hallucinated.This has never happened until now. Incomprehensible. It feels unpleasant. My heart hurts. Will this pain disappear if I crush them until I feel satisfied? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019ll be satisfied or why my chest hurts. With that feeling, I kept swinging my fist down again and again.On the next day, Mai quickly recovered. Mai who came back healthy was laughing cheerfully, and although the best response is to treat her gently, I yelled at Mai for the first time with a strange discomfort.\u25c7T/N: Hi, long time no see! I\u2019m back healthy even though still need some recovery for my poor weak lungs. But at least I can start translating again! Enjoy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m going back to school after long rest with a nervous feeling. Why? That\u2019s because I haven\u2019t seen my brother in the past week.Even if I want to prepare for another surprise, my parents took turns in taking days off from work to watch over me, and it seems that they also realized that I would behave abnormally when I approach my brother, I can\u2019t even create something with paper. My brother didn\u2019t even pass by my room, I can hear his voice talking to my parents in the living room, but I never saw him even though we live under the same roof.I really can\u2019t help to worry.He messed up the insects in his morgue box, and he suddenly become emotional. I ate breakfast in my room separately, but I remembered my mother said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since you went to school, but don\u2019t do anything rash. Listen to Onii-chan properly.\u201d So, it seems that I must go to school with my brother today.My brother appeared in the living room when I was looking down, trembling in fear with whatever comes after. After staring at me for a while, he gave me a gentle smile.\u201cGood morning, Mai. Shall we go?\u201dI didn\u2019t make lunch boxes, so my brother and I changed our clothes to uniforms. He didn\u2019t say anything strange, but my brother\u2019s smiling face was so unnatural that I stared at him in amazement.My brother is holding my hand. It may be an act in front of my parents because of my recent accident. However, even after we were sent off by my parents and left the house, my brother kept holding hands with me. When we both stopped at the pedestrian crossing, I asked him.\u201cOnii-chan, why are you still holding my hand?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHe asked back and I became speechless. My brother\u2019s hands are too cold, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a living hand or not, it\u2019s a dangerous temperature. If I had to say myself, I am always full of life and warm, so it\u2019s contrasting with him. There is no discomfort though.However, I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s still holding my hand even though my parents aren\u2019t around. If he pushes me down to the river or the middle of the road, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, but he\u2019s leading me to walk in the inner sidewalk instead, and while waiting for the traffic light, he stood in front of me with his hand tightly clasped on mine.\u201cUhm, Onii-chan?\u201d\u201cWhat is it? You have been fidgeting since earlier.\u201dMy brother is suspicious of my uncomfortable speech and conduct. But no matter how you look at it, the one who is being weird is him. In a blink of an eye, my brother leads me by hand while saying, \u201cThe light has turned green.\u201dWhat\u2019s on earth happened to my brother\u2026?While feeling confused, I let myself be pulled by my brother.\u25c7T/N: thank you for your comments on the last chapter and sorry for rarely replying.

    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u25cb 156 DAYS AGOIt can be said that Kurobe Makoto is a person who looks down on everything. From the time he was born, he vaguely felt that there was a big gap between himself and others, and he had no choice but to express his emotions according to his surroundings, mimicking an honour student.So, he has no romantic interest, let alone friendship or familial love. And he has no motivation to get along with people other if there are no profits. Familial love is the same, and the reason why he gets along with his sister, Kurobe Mai, is because if he does, everyone will think that he\u2019s \u201ca gentle brother\u201d. But\u2026\u201cMai, do you think this graduation speech is okay?\u201dIt\u2019s graduation rehearsal. During the break, my brother came all the way to the second-grade seat and asked me what I think about the speech.\u201cSound good\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t that a very half-hearted reply?\u201dMy brother said so and observed my face. My left hand is holding the speech script, while my brother held my other hand. Talk about the surroundings\u2019 reaction, Yukari-chan and Iwai look at us with suspicious eyes, but the other students are saying, \u201cThey are doing it again\u201d.It\u2019s been three months since I had an accident, but since then, my brother has been openly guarding me.(T/N: yea, he\u2019s not only watching closely but also grabbing Mai\u2019s hand in every chance he could too, so I choose \u2018guarding\u2019 instead \u2018watching\u2019. And yes, our Makoto is blooming into fine possessive yandere lol)Originally, after I was caught dived into the pond eight times, my parents asked him to watch me closely. But back then, when my parents are not around, he will completely ignore me.However, after the accident, he started to grab my arm whenever he can.If a small child clings to his mother, I understand\u2026 but he\u2019s already a third-grade middle schooler, older than me, to be exact, my older brother. Somehow, he makes me feel nervous and complicated.\u201cIt\u2019s not a half-hearted reply. I properly read the speech script.\u201d\u201cReally? Mai has been strange recently.\u201dHearing my reply, my brother looked at me with a suspicious look.I want to say that it\u2019s him who is strange. And this is not the only abnormal behaviour. For example, at school when we go home, back then he usually waits for me at our appointed place, but now he\u2019s picking me up in my classroom. Even on holidays, my brother asks how I will spend my time, and he confirms the schedule on Friday, such as \u201cDo you need to do shopping?\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cOkay then\u201d.Perhaps because he watched a human being run over instead of a cat, made his propensity get worse.But my brother\u2019s graduation is near. Also, since the semester is over, the morning class started last week, so I can\u2019t make any bento boxes. If it\u2019s like this, my brother will successfully hold the death game at his high school.If that happens, I have no choice but to confine my brother during the death game day. Besides, I must keep an eye on him on graduation day. My brother\u2019s condition after the accident may come from the excitement of seeing a person being run over, albeit with zero bleeding, and his propensity may be worse than in the manga.\u201cThere, Mai, you are being absent-minded again.\u201dWhen I turned around with a dissatisfied grunt, my cheek was poked. My brother is poking my cheek with his index finger. He looked at me with indescribable eyes, and when I try to bite his finger, he immediately evaded it.\u201cYou poked my cheek first, why are you evading?\u201d\u201cBecause Mai doesn\u2019t listen to me.\u201dHe said as if sulking and looked back at me.When I was one-sidedly concerned about my brother for a while, the chime rang. The graduates\u2019 seats are in the order of attendance numbers, so I am sandwiched between Iwai and Yukari-chan. When I returned to my seat after seeing off my brother, Iwai, who sit next to me, nudged my elbow.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t his attitude changed since you had an accident? That person.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dIwai is curious about my brother\u2019s changes. But my surroundings are different. Other than him and Yukari-chan, surprisingly no one is aware of my brother\u2019s changes.The reason is that an accident like being hit by a car and hospitalized is a rare occurrence, and that is why only a few people know the optimal solution for how to deal with such a person. So, not even my homeroom teacher or my classmates are wondering when they saw my brother picking me up at the classroom and grabbing my arms all the time.It wasn\u2019t until three months ago that my brother came all the way to second-grade class but being called with \u201cYour brother is coming!\u201d seems so natural now. Scary.What the hell does my brother want to do? After the accident, he started to treat me favourably\u2026 or that\u2019s how it feels. No, aside from what he actually thinks deep inside, he always has been kind to me, but now I can\u2019t help feeling he seems to be even more touchy than necessary.\u201cDid something happen to him?\u201dIwai seems suspicious. I just answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and looked ahead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u25cb 141 DAYS AGOIt\u2019s March, days move so fast and in a blink of eye, it\u2019s already graduation ceremony day. Perhaps the time felt so fast because every day I only need to attend the morning lessons, and the rest are practising for the ceremony.\u201cOw-ow-ouch\u2026\u201dI patted my aching elbow because after I woke up, I immediately changed my clothes, headed to the living room, and stumbled in the process.With my new outfit style, I can\u2019t even touch the doorknob. When I managed to get into the room, I got stuck like a ball.After my utmost effort trying, I finally entered the room, sweating and out of breath. Then, I looked at the full-size mirror. In the mirror, I saw myself standing in a hamburger costume.Yes, now I\u2019m a hamburger.I bought the costume online. There were various other types such as French fries and drinks, but I chose a hamburger because it seems to have a big impact upon seeing it for the first time.To be honest, it\u2019s seriously heavy, and the heat is the same with the armour. I rather jump off the balcony, make a big hole in the garden, or jump into the pond. I\u2019m wearing this costume now while suffering just to offer a surprise. But this is also for my brother.It will be surprising when he woke up in the morning, there is a huge hamburger in the centre of the living room, and it was his sister inside the costume. Today is also the day of the graduation ceremony. When I was standing in the living room, feeling victorious already, the door opens.\u201cMai, good morning. You are early.\u201dMy brother who suddenly came into the living room glanced at the hamburger, then he pulled my arm and sat on the sofa. Because it\u2019s like wearing a big lifebuoy from top to bottom, as soon as I lost my balance, I bumped hard into the sofa.\u201cThis is cool. How did you buy it?\u201d\u201cOnline\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you carry it through the front door\u2026? Oh, it was deflated, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMy brother answered his own question. He squished the fluffy bun part for a bit and led his hand back to grab my hand, or rather hold it tight. Even when I pull out lightly, he won\u2019t let go. My brother, while he reacted to my surprises lightly, also still looked down on me with his cold eyes.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cNo, I was wondering why you hold my hand.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can brush it.\u201dMy brother said without changing his expression. And he pressed the tomato part of my hamburger costume innocently while saying, \u201cThis is amazing. It\u2019s flexible.\u201d As soon as he starts pulling the cheese part, he starts to thrust his hand.I wonder why. Is doing that really fun for him? Tomatoes have red colour, but it\u2019s still vegetables after all. It\u2019s not like human organs.\u201cSo, it can be crushed like this. Hahaha.\u201dHowever, it seems that my brother\u2019s real personality hasn\u2019t changed as usual. I can only remind myself of the sense of crisis in the near-approaching death game countdown.\u25c7My brother stands on the stage in the gymnasium with a refreshing face, giving his speech as the graduate representative, while I sit in the designated area for other students. Once the graduation ceremony begins, I have no choice but to watch the sight of graduates being called by name and receiving their diplomas, which is boring even if it\u2019s my relative who graduates.\u201cLook, Yukari-chan. That\u2019s my brother!\u201d\u201cI know. Mai-chan calms down. You are being strange recently. Somehow Mai-chan seems to be cornered?\u201dWhen I lowered my voice and whispered to Yukari who sit beside me, she turned her worried face to me.This week\u2019s Monday, because I don\u2019t have any other means, I told my brother, \u201cI\u2019ll make a crepe!\u201d And succeeded in making a splendid flamb\u00e9. I practised and made a beautiful and safe pillar of fire, but my brother\u2019s impression was only, \u201cBe careful not to get burned.\u201dOn Tuesday, I made dominoes from my brother\u2019s room to the living room, but despite my spectacular work, my brother just simply said, \u201cYou did well.\u201dThat domino of mine was absolutely spectacular.The theme is a nationwide tour. I set up the dominoes imitating Japan\u2019s region speciality like the cows from Hokkaido\u2019s ranch, Tokyo\u2019s puffed rice cracker (Kaminari-Okoshi), Takoyaki from Osaka, and the bitter gourd from Okinawa. I devised the idea so neatly to make it interesting.I diligently put together the component, I even used the projector to make it like a movie, and at the end of the dominoes, I showed off the projection mapping in the living room. After the sparkling colours of four seasons at the ending, there is a surprise sentence \u201cThere is no particular meaning\u201d displayed in shining rainbow colour using the bold gothic font. And all I receive is just one sentence, \u201cYou did well.\u201dLol, Mai is holding a grudge.So, I tried to surprise again with a hamburger costume this morning, but that didn\u2019t work either.\u201cI was able to fulfil my role as student council president properly all thanks to the cooperation of teachers, parents, and all the students at this school. Thank you very much!\u201dMy brother is giving a speech full of emotions, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just acting. There is no way for people who got moved by the graduation ceremony, didn\u2019t get their emotions moved by dominoes.Mai is really holding a grudge here lolol.Everyone, teachers, the graduates and even the current students, listen to my brother\u2019s speech with teary eyes, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s now seeing those people who got moved to tears with his own words as 'simple-minded\u201d.\u201cEven though we are graduating from this junior high school and spreading our wings towards our dreams, it\u2019s not an eternal farewell. I believe that the memories we spent together for three years will remain in our hearts.\u201dA memory may gradually fade, but if the death game is held, my brother\u2019s presence will remain in the memory of those who are attending this graduation ceremony. He will be remembered as \u201ca person who was giving such a moving speech that suddenly turned into a murderer.\u201dAs I expected, I have no choice but to keep my brother at home on the death game day. In the manga, he said, \u201cBecause my parents are travelling, preparations went easily,\u201d so it\u2019s possible to confine him. But that\u2019s just the last resort. Even if the tragedy of the death game can be prevented, there is a possibility of him doing something else after that.Is there anything else that might be interesting to my brother\u2026As I stared at him, my brother turned his gaze toward me. As if there is some hidden meaning, he smiled, and probably because it was too unnatural timing, everyone glanced at me.Why are you all looking here?I glared back at my brother on the stage in protest.\u25c7In the end, because my brother looked at me suddenly, everyone in the class teased me saying \u201cKurobe, you fell asleep didn\u2019t you\u201d, so as soon as the ceremony was over, I left the classroom and went to my brother\u2019s class.In other classes, the teachers are writing messages about memories of the past year in the classroom. For a moment I thought it would have been better to wait at the school gate, but I already arrived, so I can\u2019t help it. I stood in the corner of the corridor and erased my presence.Outside the window, cherry blossoms are dancing. Every year, cherry blossoms bloom during the graduation season\u2026 or that\u2019s what they said, but actually, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen cherry blossoms bloom exactly at the graduation ceremony.The white particles that dance around are definitely flower petals, but the graduation ceremony of the elementary school and the kindergarten are in early March, and the cherry blossoms bloom in late March. The entrance ceremony is usually in early April, so seeing the full bloom on the day of the ceremony is far from feeling fresh, it feels strange.\u201cMai, you\u2019ve been waiting for me?\u201dI turned my head and saw my brother walk out of the classroom. He\u2019s the student council president and head class representative, so I thought he would come out a little later.I glanced behind him to see if he was really done, turns out his classmates are looking at my brother with reluctant looks.\u201cAre you done?\u201d\u201cYeah. I received the farewell messages already, and I can get in touch with them online.\u201dWell, it\u2019s certainly possible to stay in touch without actually meeting in person, and my brother has all of his classmates\u2019 contacts. When I was convinced and left school together, my brother did a big stretch.\u201cIt\u2019s tiring.\u201d\u201cRight, you also did a speech as the student council president, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201dThe student council duties were handed over in January, and since then it was run by the new members. But because my brother was the student council president, and there was also a speech as the graduate representative, he\u2019s been so busy. On the other hand, unless I run for the student council election, I don\u2019t have anything to do, so I devoted myself to giving my brother surprises and failed.(She means her attempts with domino and hamburger lol)\u201cMai, are you really alright not joining the student council?\u201d\u201cYeah. From next year, I\u2019m genuinely going devote my 100% to the go-home club.\u201d\u201cI thought if it\u2019s Mai, you can definitely go as council president, though?\u201dMy brother seems disappointed. In this year\u2019s election, because there are too many council president candidates, the votes become divided. And although usually, the council president needs to have 200 votes to be chosen, the current council president was chosen with only 80 votes. He was neither good nor bad, but because my brother\u2019s votes were over 90%, he\u2019s now worried.\u201cYou see, I\u2019m not the type who can that stands on top of people, unlike my older brother.\u201d\u201cBeing council president doesn\u2019t do that much. It\u2019s like playing house at school.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You even changed three school regulations.\u201dWhile working at the student organization, my brother lifted the ban on brown hair, colour cardigans, and bicycle commuting. It seems that the lifting of the brown hair ban was argued by teachers, but they finally agreed when my brother told his concern about what to do with the natural brown-haired students, as hair dyeing is prohibited too. Thanks to this, Yukari-chan was relieved because her natural hair is brownish.I think some people will be saved by my brother if he uses his manipulating power in his works like this. But I\u2019m sure my brother won\u2019t enjoy helping people, and even if the other party felt they were helped, he won\u2019t feel the same. My brother will help people happily only when he is injured. It\u2019s a difficult problem.\u201c\u2026Mai.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI was called, so I turned my head to my brother. What appeared in front of me was a small bag. It\u2019s wrapped with a white ribbon in a thin spring-like pink wrapping.\u201cIt\u2019s a thank you gift for making me bento lunch from last year.\u201dHe\u2019s giving me\u2026a gift? I always received a birthday present. But this may be the first time for him to gift me outside formal ceremonies. And he usually handed it in front of my parents while saying, \u201cMai, happy birthday!\u201d with his fake gentle older brother smile, but today he just stared at me without even smiling.\u201cTha-thank you, Onii-chan!\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s nothing much.\u201dMy brother replied bluntly. When I opened the bag, I found a scrunchie that looks like a black butterfly. When I change the angle, the blue glitter turns red. It\u2019s very cute, I\u2019m happy.\u201cI wonder where I should put it~\u201d\u201cIs there any other place than your hair?\u201d\u201cEven if I put it on my wrist, it\u2019s still cute.\u201dMy brother gave an uninterested reply, \u201cI see.\u201d And when I thought he looked down, he touched the second button on his blazer and tore it off.\u201cHuh!?\u201dWhen I was amazed by his sudden action, my brother offered me the button.\u201cHere.\u201d\u201cEh, why?\u201d\u201cThere is a custom to exchange the second button in the graduation ceremony, isn\u2019t it? I thought Mom or Dad might be worried if I still have mine.\u201d\u201cEhh\u2026? I don\u2019t think they will worry\u2026\u201dThe perfectly fine uniform has been wasted. Usually, boys of the same grade uniform were pretty tattered and frayed, but my brother\u2019s uniform always looked like a new one with no wrinkles or stains. Also, why did he give his sister, me, the second button? Though if it\u2019s my brother, I\u2019m sure many girls will give their money just to obtain it\u2026\u201cAre you sure I can receive it?\u201d\u201cYeah. Please dispose of it.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a garbage dealer. Or rather, you can\u2019t throw it away, it\u2019s a memoir, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, after all, I will throw away the blazer too.\u201d\u201cWhat a waste\u2026\u201dWhile saying so, I suddenly got an idea. It might be good to receive my brother\u2019s unused blazer, make a small uniform for a teddy bear to wear and give it to my brother.Back then, Grandpa cut my brother\u2019s and my unused school bags and made a mini school bag. There will be some excess fabrics\u2026 Then, should I make a bear out of blazer excess fabrics\u2026? Which is better?Grandpa\u2019s surgery was a success, and it might be a good idea to call Grandpa and ask him which one is better. Let\u2019s try it today. I also want to boast about the scrunchie.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dThe trip to school this morning was heavy due to the failure of hamburger operation, but now, I feel bright as I walk home.\u25c7\u201cI\u2019m so thirsty.\u201dAfter I called Grandpa that evening, I went down to the kitchen on the first floor while feeling drowsy. Grandpa is fine without any post-operation after effect, and as he has returned his driver\u2019s license, he seems to be exercising his body while walking far places. \u201cI\u2019m walking to Mizuhashi-san\u2019s house who lives across three houses from mine,\u201d he reported so often, that I felt like I was receiving calls from\u00a0Mary-san.(See T/N at the end of the chapter for Mary-san\u2019s explanation.)I want to fall asleep like this, but my throat is too dry, and I can\u2019t sleep. The light was leaking from my brother\u2019s room door, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not killing insects right now, it\u2019s the right timing.When I headed to the kitchen with the clock showing the last minute to midnight, the dim light was on. Maybe Dad or Mom is making a midnight snack. So far, I don\u2019t smell any food though. As I cautiously opened the door, I saw my brother\u2019s profile. Maybe he came to drink water. But the next moment, the sight that came into my view stopped me as if my legs are glued to the floor.My brother\u2019s face is expressionless and is throwing something away.He doesn\u2019t seem to notice me yet. The thing that he had thrown are not flesh or human body part, but papers. Letters, messages, and even graduation albums are mercilessly packed in garbage bags by his hands. His eyes are dull and clouded just like the bottom of a swamp.Those eyes are not my brother\u2019s usual eyes. Even though he usually gave cold eyes, my brother\u2019s eyes right now are definitely the \u2018Kurobe-kun\u2019 after he revealed his true nature.The moment I realized it; my body stopped moving. I can\u2019t even make a voice. When I\u2019m somehow able to move my body, I can only step back. I managed to get back to the room without being noticed, and after I closed the door, my body sank to the floor.Indeed, I have never really felt his genuine response to my surprises. However, sometimes I hope the slight surprises would accumulate, and his change would avoid the tragedy.However, the appearance of my older brother just now was unmistakably Kurobe-kun.It\u2019s already March. It\u2019s four months before my brother will hold the death game. How can I prevent my brother from going through the tragedy?Feeling the noisy beating of my heart, I could only sit on the floor.\u25c7T/N: Hello, sorry for the late update, my spoiled lungs being sulky recently, it won\u2019t let me breathe, so I spent my days in bed most of the time T.TBtw, here is a simple explanation about Mary-san:Mary-san is an urban legend/ghost story in Japan, it\u2019s about a girl who owns a western doll called Mary-san, and the girl will receive a phone call from Mary-san stating Mary\u2019s location, and the calls will continue until Mary-san reaches behind the girl. For more, you can read\u00a0here.Tbh I\u2019m weak with ghost stories and I was translating this at midnight, so it\u2019s freaking me out lol.After this, will be the last chapter of Mai\u2019s POV, and then it will be hell for me coz it\u2019s the long-awaited 5 chapters straight of Makoto\u2019s POV! I\u2019m sure you guys are waiting for this ehehe. I will do my best!Anyway, I wanna thank you very very much for someone who gave me Ko-fi, you really made me so motivated to translate! I still don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s good to mention the person\u2019s name or not\u2026 is it violating privacy? But I\u2019m really really grateful! So thank you very much!So, see you on next chapter and please stay safe!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The table is lined with toast, bacon, and scrambled eggs, and all I have to do left is to place this decorative tomato on top of the salad.After the last night, I couldn\u2019t sleep well, and I didn\u2019t know what kind of breakfast I would make for my brother, so I made a meal without any surprises.On holiday, because I couldn\u2019t make bento lunch, I told my parents that I will make breakfast, and I put the surprise meals only for my brother\u2019s part, but today they all have the same breakfast.I used to make weird things until yesterday, and it might be surprising to have a regular breakfast today. But I wonder if it really makes sense.As I stared at the cut tomatoes absentmindedly, someone\u2019s hand rested on my hand that is holding the knife. When I raised my head, my brother is staring at me.\u201cMorning. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dSince I was run over, my brother has become touchy. He usually touched my wrist pulse, or on my cheek. Is his hand that seems to confirm if I\u2019m still alive, actually trying to tell me that he will kill me in the future or an expression of affection?tbh, I don\u2019t know how to make that sentence more sensible, I can\u2019t find the right wording equal in English. Sorry.\u201cNothing in particular.\u201d\u201cTell me, I won\u2019t move from here until you say it.\u201dMy brother\u2019s abyss-like eyes are shaking a little. It seems my brother really won\u2019t move unless I confessed. He doesn\u2019t seem to be joking.\u201c\u2026Last night.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cYou threw away something.\u201dCautiously, I asked about the thing my brother did last night. I was hesitant to mention the letters. He doesn\u2019t seem to be perturbed with what I said. On the contrary, he pretends to be a little disappointed.\u201cAh, the graduation memento? I received it, but somehow, isn\u2019t it scary? I thought because it\u2019s the last time, I\u2019m scared they wrote bad things about me, so I threw it away.\u201d\u201cScared?\u201d\u201cYeah. I was the class president, and it seems I was seen as arrogant and annoying.\u201dMy brother laughs lightly as if it\u2019s nothing. But no matter how I see it, his expression at that time was not the expression of a person who got frightened of defamation. It was a frightening expression. And I don\u2019t think anyone would do bad things like that to my brother, and if I had to say\u2026 it\u2019s actually the other way around.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone who does such a bad thing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the case for Mai, isn\u2019t it? \u2026What\u2019s today\u2019s breakfast?\u201d\u201cExploding, so let me go.\u201dI deliberately shoo him with a mysterious expression, and my brother touched my head while smiling fondly.\u201c\u2026As always, thank you, Mai.\u201dFrom my head, he touched my hair while smiling as if he treats something affectionately, and turned his back, to sit on the sofa. My brother\u2019s back is the familiar back that I always know. He isn\u2019t dyed with blood and didn\u2019t carry any knife.\u2026now.I took out the scrunchie in my pocket and put it on my tied hair.\u201cScrunchie!\u201dI called my brother. His eyes that turned to me, don\u2019t seem surprised and felt deep and dark as usual.But when he took a good look at it, I feel like there is lighter than before.\u201cI put it on! Thank you for this!\u201dI tilted my head to show my brother the scrunchie. He approached me silently, then suddenly put his hand on my shoulder.\u201cUhm, what is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little crooked.\u201dBefore I knew it, my brother\u2019s face filled my field of vision. My stupid face is reflected a little in his pitch-black eyes.\u201cDone.\u201dMy brother\u2019s hand separates from my hair. At that moment, softly, I can smell a clean scent like soap from him, making my heart bounce.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to breakfast.\u201d\u201cPle-please do.\u201dMy brother let my shoulder go and sits on the couch. I blinked my eyes and then stared at the cutting board.If I were frightened by my brother and stopped offering surprises, it would be a truly terrifying tragedy.Originally, he was a person who has a desire to see his classmates kill each other and make it true.He won\u2019t change his mind easily. But I still have time. There will be no time to hesitate and slack off. I have a responsibility to avoid my brother\u2019s tragedy. And save my brother\u2019s life.\u25c7T/N: Hello, this will be the last of Mai\u2019s POV chapter for now, and next is the 5 chapters of Makoto\u2019s POV ! I saw comments saying they can\u2019t wait for it ahaha.

I\u2019m not even sure myself.I never thought of Mai as an equal partner. That person is just a sister who appeared after my father\u2019s remarriage. At this point, what do I\u2019m wishing for?So, I thought I want to go back like how it\u2019s supposed to be. I want to prove that nothing has changed. That\u2019s why I decided to put Mai by my side. On the other hand, even after the accident, my sister\u2019s eccentricity does not seem to subside. She keeps making weird bento for me.The taste is normal, but the appearance is strange. It\u2019s beyond the normal human senses. Even in a single glance, I know that is very time-consuming.\u201cIsn\u2019t this possible!?\u201dAs I flip through the textbooks for tomorrow\u2019s test without any motivation, I heard Mai\u2019s voice from the next room. Because the walls are thin, if not careful, any sounds will pass through. Unlike Mai, I don\u2019t use a saw in the room, nor move dozens of cardboard boxes. So, she won\u2019t notice how loud she is.\u201cYou can do this with rolled omelette!\u201dMai plans the bento lunch\u2019s contents before going to bed. She told me, \u201cNever open it until you are going to eat it!\u201d So, I shouldn\u2019t listen to her, right?I sighed and took the earphones out of the drawer. Originally, I won\u2019t listen to music when I\u2019m studying, and I only used it for English listening practice. However, I\u2019ve been using it frequently recently.At this point, I don\u2019t feel annoyed by Mai\u2019s voice anymore. But I still have a feeling that I shouldn\u2019t listen. On the other hand, Mai doesn\u2019t seem to have any suspicion about me who is suddenly listening to music from earphones.My inner thoughts seemed to be eroded, it felt uncomfortable.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I\u2019m very sorry in advance if this chapter somehow messed up. I\u2019m trying hard, but Makoto\u2019s POV is really confusing.I spent like 3 hours for one sentence, just brooding over why he\u2019s should not have suspicion/doubt about himself who listens to music, then I just realized he actually talking about Mai. In Japanese raw, there is no subject, object, or any target person he referred to, so it\u2019s dang confusing. I\u2019m glad I found enlightenment before I give up. I racked my brain a lot for it.\u00a0I\u2019m totally gonna binge sweets for translating the next chapter!! LolAnyway, thank you for Impostor for the ko-fi last week!! Also, thank you to everyone who supported me in many ways, I feel encouraged when I read the comments!Tbh I\u2019m really not confident with my English, I got rejected a lot of times in the interview tests for translating jobs, so I thought my way of translating is not smooth\u2026 but I\u2019m glad when I saw some comments saying the translations are good. I will still study and learn from my mistakes tho!Anyway!! See you in the next chapter! Hopefully soon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The frequency of her being in a daze on the way home increased as well.\u201cWell, History can easily be reviewed later.\u201dIf she felt sleepy, she didn\u2019t have to make bentos. That would be the exemplary answer, the words I have to pass on as a good brother.Back then, I would have been able to say that without hesitation, but I didn\u2019t feel like saying it now. For some reason, I didn\u2019t even understand why. As an older brother, saying that would be the best thing to do. I couldn\u2019t do what I wanted to and it frustrated me. Should I just push Mai off from somewhere like the pedestrian bridge instead?(T/N: when killing someone is easier than understanding your own feeling \u2013 Makoto)When I stole a glance at Mai, I saw her lunch bag in her hand. The school bag slung over my right shoulder also contained a lunch bag of a different colour and with different contents.Even though I shouldn\u2019t have been able to tell it apart from the weight of my textbooks, I could feel a certain weight from the lunch bag I was carrying.\u201cOh, right. Can we stop by the supermarket on our way home today? I need some ingredients for the bentos.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhen I replied, Mai, smiled happily and said, \u201cGreat!\u201d.

On the other hand, all I could do was thank her. I felt frustrated about it.Before, I found it troublesome to help and thank others, and I would only do it if it was beneficial to me. There were only two types of people: those who I felt might benefit me, and those who would annoy me.However, when it came to Mai, I felt frustrated.Why couldn\u2019t I say \u201cthank you\u201d sincerely?

And I got help from Cinnamon as a proofreader too, so it\u2019s getting a bit easier. Thank you very much for helping, Cinnamon-san!So, what do you guys think of the flow of the story now that we have a proofreader? I hope it is even easier to understand and nicer to read than before!Anyway, because it\u2019s short and I was excited by how kind Cinnamon-san explained to me how to use the right wording to sound better for the reader, I finished translating 2 chapters, so enjoy chapter 28 too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rubber she used to tie her hair was simple and not particularly decorated. Just like that, I soon decided that gifting her some kind of hair accessory would be appropriate.Considering the colours of Mai\u2019s clothes and the colours she likes, I decided that primary colours would be the most suitable. But contrary to all of that, what I picked up was a black scrunchie.I imagined that its fluttering, airy lace would go well with Mai\u2019s skin. But Mai actually didn\u2019t like black. She preferred clean and vivid shades.But still, I concluded that the scrunchie I found would suit Mai.After pondering over it for a while, I eventually bought the black scrunchie.I wished I could have given it to her just as it was. But instead of giving it to her, I left the scrunchie untouched in the drawer for a long time.Even though it would have been enough to say it was a thank you for the bentos, I still couldn\u2019t do it even on the next day, the day after that, and so on. It wasn\u2019t that I had never given anything to Mai. I usually gave her a birthday present because my parents would make a fuss if I didn\u2019t.But even when I think back on how I had given those gifts back then, the memory became faint and I couldn\u2019t remember. Thus, I realised that ah, until now, I had been giving them to her half-heartedly. I didn\u2019t remember because it wasn\u2019t something I had to remember.\u25c7T/N: Hello, this chapter is really confusing! Especially the last paragraph! Took me and Cinnamon-san\u00a0(and special mention of my ChocoCats team, Sakikyu) several\u00a0hours\u00a0days of discussing and researching to finally be able to release this chapter. Thank you very much for helping and sorry I drag you into this Makoto\u2019s confusion, Cinnamon-san!But now I\u2019m glad I found someone who understands how hellish Makoto\u2019s POV ahaha.Hope you enjoy it and see you in the next chapter!

People were saying that today is a turning point. Thus, I decided to give the scrunchie to Mai as my last chance. In the end, even though I couldn\u2019t even say anything memorable, Mai received it easily without any doubt, so it felt kind of anti-climax. But when I disposed of the letters I received in the middle of the night, Mai seems to have seen them. The next day, Mai, who was clearly scared to see me, didn\u2019t wear the scrunchie.When I was throwing the letters away, I feel annoyance and disgust, so I\u2019m sure I showed an expression that Mai has never seen. And it may have been an extra shock for her because I always intentionally show my gentle face to her.After I explained the situation, Mai pondered about it while hanging her head down. I was perplexed by my own disappointed feeling when I peeked a bit on the back of her head and still couldn\u2019t see the scrunchie on her.Even though I can understand people\u2019s feelings of 'sadness\u201d when their gifts are refused, I don\u2019t have any sense of guilt or regret about throwing away the letters. After all, I am such a person, so I try to get away from Mai who was lost in thought, but Mai suddenly wore the scrunchie and grinned.I have never thought about others\u2019 smiles.But when Mai laughs, something vaguely emerged from my chest or around my abdomen.I wondered if it was because Mai was in the family category, but I never thought the same about the parents.For both the blood-related one and the non-related one.In a sense, I can say that I see them properly equal. And from that point of view, I think it\u2019s an ideal form of family-in-law.Maybe it\u2019s just an obsession because Mai has almost died.Will I feel the same if the parents are going to die? Should I start a fire and try to burn them?From the time when I couldn\u2019t give the scrunchie to her, I knew that I was obsessed with Mai, not with Mai\u2019s life or death, but I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an attachment as a family or as a human being. Even if I did try to hurt the parents until they almost die, there are still some risks.Then, maybe because I kept thinking about Mai, she appeared in my dream. I dreamed of touching her just like the health textbook\u2019s instruction that I read some time ago.Mai in my dream has the same voice and appearance as the actual Mai.The only difference was when I touch her, she looks a little shy and made a seductive voice.When I woke up, my body is showing a certain reaction, and I realised that I was seeing Mai as a woman, not as a family.While thinking, that mysterious obsession fell straight into my heart.\u25c7T/N: Hello, sorry for the late update, last week I was on bed rest again, so I couldn\u2019t do any translations.

Then\u2026\u201cWhat are you doing so early in the morning?\u201dThis year, I got into the same class as Iwai.

I thought that the cost would be expensive, but my brother had the highest score on the entrance exam, so it seems the school will cover all of my brother\u2019s travel expenses.Thus, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll hold a death game during that period, but now that it\u2019s been less than two months before the game starts, having three days without doing any surprises will give significant damage.\u201cIf you sneak inside his suitcase and follow him, you\u2019ll get caught immediately.\u201d\u201cWhen the suitcase passes the x-ray scan, they will find out. They will arrest Mai-chan.\u201d\u201cThis is hard\u2026 The future choice and all\u2026\u201dYukari likes clothes, so she decides to enter a high school for design and sewing. Iwai will probably go somewhere with baseball in mind. He\u2019s a baseball freak after all. But I don\u2019t have any particular high school that I can think of. If I don\u2019t remember my past memories, I would definitely choose my brother\u2019s high school though\u2026I gazed at the blue sky outside the window, contemplating my future choice.\u25c7Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.While I was lost in my own thought, school is already over. I packed all of my books into my bag in rush. Even though I was able to take notes while in a daze, I have a feeling that it will have some errors here and there. \u2018Oh well\u2026\u2019, I ran towards the shoe locker while thinking so and saw my brother at the school gate. He stands out even from a distance thanks to the people who surround him.Even though my brother has graduated, he still came all the way to junior high school to pick me up. Junior high school and home are within walking distance, but my brother\u2019s high school is five stations away. Even though it takes time, he still insisted to pick me up every day. I don\u2019t understand why.Aside from being \u2018a good brother\u2019, I feel like he starts to become an overprotective sister complex. But the people around me see him as \u2018the gentle brother who cares for his sister\u2019. Back then, I once said to my homeroom teacher, \u201cI\u2019m going to be teased, they will say he has a sister complex\u2026\u201d, and she told me \u201cWho would say such a terrible thing!\u201d, and emphasised, \u201cHe\u2019s a good brother, you know!\u201d to me.\u201cOnii-cha\u2026\u201dAs I try to call my brother, I stopped my legs.Next to him stood a slender beauty with long, silky black hair. Without a doubt, she must be the heroine of the\u00a0Sayo Jigoku/Good Hell\u00a0manga, Himegasaki-san. But, why is she here\u2026?Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.\u201cMai, welcome back.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAfter my brother noticed me, Himegasaki-san followed his eyes and look at me. \u201cIs this girl, Kurobe-kun\u2019s younger sister?\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Kurobe Mai.\u201d\u201cLikewise, nice to meet you. My name is Himegasaki Yuria. I\u2019m in the same class as your brother, we are both the class representatives.\u201dI know. Her profile appeared in the monologue section of the manga. But why is Himegasaki-san here? There is no background story saying she was close to my brother, not even the fact that they were the class representative. If I had to say, I only know that she is a flower on the high peak. She has little association with the boys. She is supposed to be the lone wolf cool beauty type of person.\u201cI\u2019m going to do a study group session at home today.\u201dMy brother glanced toward his back, and the students in the same uniform as my brother peeked from his back. I can also see the other characters that I have seen in manga. Perhaps there was a study session in my brother\u2019s room but was omitted in the manga. But I think picking up his sister in junior high school is not part of the original manga.\u201cUh, then isn\u2019t it better for you just go ahead without picking me up?\u201d\u201cNo way. Isn\u2019t it dangerous if you fall down on the roadside?\u201dMy brother shakes his head, but the reaction of the other classmates behind him is different. \u201cOh, it seems your sister has poor health,\u201d \u201cShe was hospitalized the other day.\u201d Somehow, they had an impression that I have a history of being sickly.Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.\u201cMai is already here, let\u2019s go.\u201dThe group moves as prompted by my brother. When I looked at my brother\u2019s unreadable face, he asked \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d, acting as if he was worried about my condition. My brother\u2019s classmate from behind immediately talks to me.\u201cAnyway, Kurobe\u2019s sister is so cute, isn\u2019t she? Are you in third grade now?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cWoah, you are going to take the exam this year right, it must be hard. If you were hospitalized, you couldn\u2019t attend half of it, right?\u201dNo, even though I got into an accident and was hospitalized when I was in second grade, I got a certificate award at home for perfect attendance for one year\u2026 Just as I expected, I think that my brother\u2019s classmates\u2019 impressions about me are being manipulated.When I looked at my brother, he replied, \u201cit was hard, right?\u201d, asking me to agree with him. I nervously nodded under his pressure, and his classmate said enthusiastically, \u201cBut since she\u2019s this cute if she\u2019s also sickly, it\u2019s understandable for you to be so overprotective.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d (Makoto)Himegasaki-san, who walks along beside my brother, looks at me and nodded.\u201cYour sister is surely cute, isn\u2019t she.\u201dBut that voice feels a bit cold, I remember feeling uncomfortable.Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe uncomfortable feeling I remembered, in the end,- was correct.Ever since then, for the past month my brother has been hosting study sessions at home regularly with different members each time. However, Himegasaki-san always attended without fail every time. She seemed to be interested in my brother.She speaks so sweetly only towards my brother, and she blushed with gleaming eyes when their shoulder touched. At first, I told myself that maybe it was just my imagination, but after each study session, it turned into conviction.Himegasaki-san always sits next to my brother, and when someone else takes over her place, she will say, \u201cUhm, I have a lot of questions for Kurobe-kun,\u201d and create a space where she can stick to my brother. She became even bolder each time.On the other hand, my brother did not show any particular disgust or caution to Himegasaki-san, he didn\u2019t give her a cold gaze, and conversed with her naturally.All this time, my classmates praised my brother for being cool and aggressively tried to appeal to him. But when they weren\u2019t looking, he had an icy glare that could make anyone shiver from their spine. In contrast, Himegasaki-san was not treated like that.Himegasaki-san in the manga gave an impression as a person who has no interest in anyone. She was a \u2018cool beauty\u2019 archetype, but she was able to open her heart at last because the main character, Hiroshi-kun, always rescued her many times when her life was threatened.That\u2019s why I was sure there were no backstory settings that she dated Kurobe-kun for a while.Then, if the two of them get along well, the power of love may prevent my brother from committing any crimes. With that in mind, I decided to increase the chances of contact between the two and make an effort to bring Himegasaki-san and my brother together.Thankfully, my brother always asked me to help serve the guests during the study session. \u201cAre there any snacks?\u201d or \u201cDo you know where the spare cups were?\u201d It feels like I\u2019m working part-time at a cafe.\u201cHey Mai, do we still have juice?\u201dAnd today, when I went to the kitchen, my brother coincidently called me out from the living room.\u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure, wait,\u201d when I answered him with an ambiguous voice, Himegasaki-san immediately tried to stand up and said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll help. I remember the place.\u201d But soon she was stopped by my brother\u2019s classmate who already stood up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Himegasaki-san has always been the one who helped all this time. Let me help too.\u201dIs Himegasaki-san aiming\u2026 to be my brother\u2019s rival*? But he will be holding a death game in the future\u2026*T/N: Tbh I don\u2019t understand what this sentence means, even in Japanese. I\u2019m still trying to figure it out but my brain exploded so I just leave it here for a while until I reach enlightenment.\u201cMai-chan, do you really have a weak constitution?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cI asked Kurobe. He said you used to be hospitalised a lot before.\u201dAfter I poured the juice into cups and refilled the snacks unwillingly, my brother\u2019s classmate didn\u2019t immediately return to the living room but tried to start a conversation.\u201cUhm, you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know who I am? I often come to the study session tho\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t know. Honestly, my focus was only on Himegasaki-san.If it\u2019s Hiroshi-kun, maybe I will notice, but that person didn\u2019t come to the study session.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. I\u2019m Nagatani*. Or rather I\u2019m sorry for being overly familiar with you.\u201d*T/N: This is not a mistake, even though in the manga he introduced himself as Hase, in the novel, the furigana is read as Nagatani. I wish to follow the novel truthfully so I will keep using Nagatani. But FYI, the kanji is the same (\u9577\u8c37), it can be read as Hase or Nagatani. So in short, it\u2019s the same person. If there is a change in the future chapters, I will put another note.\u201cNo, not really\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm then, how should I call you from now on? Mai-san?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine to call me as it is.\u201d\u201cOK, Mai-chan then.\u201dNagatani\u2026 Even though he did appear in the manga, I think he\u2019s a person whose death is described almost in a short summary. While drinking juice, Nagatani-senpai asked, \u201cHow are you feeling lately? Are you okay? You will be hospitalized again next month, I heard?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m healthy these days, hahaha.\u201dWhat kind of explanation did my brother actually give to them? The people who came to the study session were often worried about my physical condition, and they gave me sympathy while saying, \u201cI heard you didn\u2019t go to elementary school halfway? Studying the basic mathematics of multiplying and dividing by yourself must be hard!\u201dI think it\u2019s my brother\u2019s work, but what\u2019s the benefit of making me a sickly person? Even if he could avoid the hassle by saying something like, \u201cMy sister is sick, I have to go back soon\u201d, I still think it\u2019s really over the limit. There is absolutely no need to go this far.\u201cNext time, when you are feeling better, how about hanging out together?\u201d\u201cHang out? Do you mean I join you guys?\u201d\u201cAh no. It\u2019s not with all of the people here now\u2026 It\u2019s just me, you, your brother, and hmm maybe another girl will be suitable. Someone that Mai-chan also knows, like Himegasaki.\u201dT/N: He lowkey asking for a double date lmao.Nagatani-senpai put down the juice cup and said so. Then shifted his gaze to me seriously.\u201cWell, I want to get along with Mai-chan, or rather I want to get along with the person who made those interesting bento lunches.\u201dEven after my brother entered high school, I continued to make bento lunches. Because I can\u2019t meet him at school, I put in a lot of effort inside the lunch. But did my brother show off my bento lunches\u2026?Even when I think about it, I can\u2019t imagine my brother showing off his bento lunches. When I was wondering about the strange occurrence, my brother suddenly came over here.\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of Mai so much, if she gets too stressed she might get a fever.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. Mai-chan, I\u2019m serious, okay?\u201dMy brother\u2019s friends who overheard my brother said to other classmates, \u201cis he a lolicon*?\u201d teasing Nagatani-senpai.*T/N: Lolicon is a term for someone who prefers much younger, most likely underaged girls. In here, they are just teasing. But in their point of view, reaching high school is like reaching adulthood, a step ahead of middle school. (just like when you see all middle school still looks like a bunch of kids and high school is all teens who almost reaching adulthood).I looked at my brother, and he was giving me a dissatisfied glare. Unlike my brother, I didn\u2019t treat anyone as a sickly person, and I didn\u2019t imbue them with a strange impression.\u00a0But when I was going to stare back to ask why did he have to look at me like that, my brother had gone back to everyone.Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.\u25c7\u201cDon\u2019t laze around. If you don\u2019t properly get the radius of this circle, you won\u2019t be able to understand the next step.\u201dMy brother pointed at the shape drawn in my notebook. Back then, I used to have my brother teach me once in a while, but now it\u2019s almost every day.My brother is certainly brilliant with all of his test grades being high. I think it\u2019s more economical and easier to learn from being taught by my brother than to go to a cram school or hire a tutor.And the problem of my undecided career path was solved before I knew it. That\u2019s because I was told by my parents, \u201cIf Mai doesn\u2019t have any high school in mind, we hope you go to Onii-chan\u2019s high school.\u201dI haven\u2019t decided on what I particularly want to be, and I also haven\u2019t decided on my career path survey. When I asked the teacher, the submission due date is\u2026October. By aiming for my brother\u2019s high school, which is the most difficult one at the moment, even if I choose another high school, I can just lower the standard. It will be easier than deciding on a high school with a high standard later and having to raise my standard in studying.I looked back at my brother while giving him the problem earlier\u2019s answer.\u201cSay, what is my exam pass rate like?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. We will only know when the result is out.\u201d\u201cWhat about in Onii-chan\u2019s opinion?\u201d\u201cMaybe about 50%?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dEven with the help of my brother, the exam pass rate was still 50%. If that is the case, my chance to pass other high school exams is also delicate. If I reduce my surprises preparation time, I can devote myself to studying, but I don\u2019t want to do that if possible. From now on, I guess I can only do my best.For the time being, let\u2019s try the secret plan that I\u2019ve learned before.[[Onii-chan, hold on, I don\u2019t understand this part.]]*T/N: these brackets [[\u2026]] mean that Mai is speaking in Spanish.While showing my note, I spoke to my brother in Spanish.This is the result of my attempt to balance studying for entrance exams and providing surprises. Learning a language other than Japanese. By learning another country\u2019s language, I can gain a great advantage for the exam and also gives surprises to my brother in one go. Until this time, I just spoke Japanese and had difficulty displaying my English, but suddenly I spoke Spanish. I\u2019m sure my brother will be quite surprised. While feeling convinced of my victory, I turned to my brother, but he didn\u2019t seem to be surprised at all.\u201cWhich one you don\u2019t understand? This diagonal line part?\u201d[[Not that, but this square root\u2026]]\u201cOh, that part\u2026\u201dMy brother calmly tries to explain the problem that I pointed out.No way, he understands\u2026?When I was so surprised that I couldn\u2019t even express anything, my brother\u2019s face went closer while still looking at my notebook.\u201cWhy are you surprised? Then, should I teach you Spanish too?\u201d\u201cNo thanks\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s study seriously.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dT/N: LOL Mai is defeated.What should I do about this? Or rather, I didn\u2019t consider that he could understand it. What\u2019s his deal\u2026 Just how perfect does he want to be until he is satisfied? There were elective classes to study other languages such as Chinese, French, and Italian at school, that\u2019s why I chose Spanish, but I didn\u2019t expect him to understand it too. My brother said he often listens to music while studying, is he actually listening to language courses?\u201c\u2026By the way today, what did Nagatani say back then?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou said before,\u00a0\u2018it\u2019s fine as it is\u2018.\u201dWith my brother\u2019s words as a hint, I recalled today\u2019s conversation.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s fine as it is\u2019\u00a0part is about when Nagatani-senpai asked if it\u2019s okay to call me \u2018Mai-chan\u2019.\u201cI was asked if he could call me Mai-chan. But because I didn\u2019t know Nagatani-senpai\u2019s name, he apologized for being a little too familiar with me.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dWith my words, my brother\u2019s expression looked sour. I\u2019m not sure why he looks like that. Did I step on a landmine\u2026? These days, I couldn\u2019t really understand my brother anymore. I wonder what he\u2019s thinking.\u201cAre you going to hang out with Nagatani?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can go.\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, you will have to pass because of poor health, so it\u2019s impossible anyway.\u201d\u201cAbout that, why do I\u2019m seen as someone who being alive until today seems like a miracle at Onii-chan\u2019s high school?\u201dTaking the opportunity, I asked him what I have been wanting to ask.\u201cYou almost died before, right.\u201d My brother declared so without looking ashamed at all.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhen I happened to talk about your accident, they didn\u2019t seem to understand, and the story had become like that. It\u2019s too bothersome to deny it, and this time I will really be treated as a liar, so please match the story.\u201dHe looked at me with his ice cold eyes. My brother is not a poor talker, so there is no way he got misunderstood. But I nodded while feeling perplexed.Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.\u25c7T/N: Hello again. This time I really took a long time to finish, I apologise. I\u2019m preparing to release another translated novel here, so my time a bit divided.

Even if I don\u2019t have any empathy I can gloss it over by faking it. After all, humans were easily deceived, so it was convenient for me, and I had no intention to make my true self understood.But after I became aware of my feelings for Mai, my shortcomings made me concerned.Despite her eccentricities, Mai has the ability to empathise with others, the minimum ethics and morals required as a human being. On the other hand, even when I pretended as an obedient child, I didn\u2019t have any of those thoughts.Will Mai fall in love with such a person? To have her is like dragging Mai down towards hell. I thought it will be good if I could change for Mai, but I don\u2019t want to change. If I could deceive her, I would. And once everything is exposed, there is only one thing to do.But even if I must drag Mai down towards hell, as long as she didn\u2019t aware it was hell, it will be fine.That\u2019s why I played the role of a gentle brother who always cares about his sister. As I acted, I tried to gradually change Mai\u2019s normality. Little by little, as if encroaching.To begin with, holding hands inside the house has already crossed a sibling relationship\u2019s boundary. However, I explained to the two parents that Mai had been playing with sharp objects dangerously and she was almost bathed in boiling water too. I influenced them so it wouldn\u2019t sound unnatural.This time too, I will use the same method. I will make them think that having me beside Mai is granted and they will feel uneasy when I\u2019m not around. After all, we\u2019ve been together for a long time, so it shouldn\u2019t take much time.\u201cBy the way, have Mai decided on her high school?\u201dWhile Mai was doing something with a saw amidst the noise in her room, I spoke to both of the parents who were having a good time together in the living room on the first floor. I thought the mother would have some kind of hope for Mai\u2019s future choice because they were blood-related, but it doesn\u2019t seem the case. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t decided yet\u2026\u201d she smiled awkwardly.Please read this chapter only at chococats.id.\u201cI think it\u2019s better for her to go to the same school as me.\u201d\u201cSame as Makoto? Why?\u201dThe father tilted his head. The reason I chose high school is that it has the highest deviation in the prefecture. I went on to school just as my parents and teachers wanted me to, but Mai isn\u2019t highly talented. My high school was supposed to be excluded from Mai\u2019s choice of schools, so it was a natural reaction for the father who couldn\u2019t accept it.\u201cShe can just walk to the middle school, but she must take trains or buses to go to high school, right? Back then she would jump into the pond, so it\u2019s scary thinking she would also do the same thing at the station platform.\u201dI purposely avoided using the \u2018run over\u2019 words. Let them imagine it themselves. Both of them didn\u2019t have any special intelligence to immediately get the idea, but if presented with hints, they seemed to be able to guess the answer. Realizing what I meant, their faces turned pale.\u201cRight now she seemed calm, but it isn\u2019t some kind of physical sickness, so there\u2019s no way she has been treated, right? There is a probability she might suddenly jump from the school building. Right now, there\u2019s the temple girl\u2026 Yukari-chan\u2026? Who can keep eyes on her, but things will be different once she enters high school.\u201d I explained.\u201cBut isn\u2019t it hard to aim for Onii-chan\u2019s high school with Mai\u2019s current grade?\u201d The mother asked.\u201cI will help too, I will teach her and have her study with me as much as I can. Mai taking the exam is pretty worrying, isn\u2019t it? It would be good if she can overcome her stress, but she doesn\u2019t know what to do. Right now she talked to us normally, but when that moment kick\u2026 that\u2026\u201d I deliberately slurred my sentences.The two parents face each other.

Despite Mai\u2019s eccentricity, her academic ability wasn\u2019t bad. In the first place, if she was stupid, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to come up with the idea of creating a rocket made from a\u00a0PET bottle\u00a0and would have been killed by all of the weird inventions she\u2019d ever done.Actually, Mai\u2019s grade had already exceeded the passing mark. She would still be fine even if she didn\u2019t cram from morning to night. But I didn\u2019t tell Mai about it. Rather, I deliberately acted and talked as if her grade were worrying to make her uneasy.That\u2019s why, even though Mai was forced to study all because of my selfish wish to bind her to me, she still studied hard daily while saying, \u201cIf I fail, I\u2019ll have no choice but to die.\u201d The right reaction to this should have been \u201cthat\u2019s bad!\u201d, but I didn\u2019t have any intention to stop her. Besides, if Mai were to die, could I have her life instead?If Mai didn\u2019t want her life, I wanted her. I would treasure her, I thought silently like a curse, as if praying, while I stroked her head every time she answered correctly.The only problem was making Mai aware of me as a man. On top of that, I couldn\u2019t make Mai frightened. I had to create a situation where Mai unconsciously and voluntarily became aware of me.Then, while I was searching for a method with the fewest disadvantages, I found the perfect bait, Himegasaki, in high school.\u201cI have something to talk about with you Himegasaki, is that okay?\u201dI called out to Himegasaki, who was reading a pocketbook during break time. Hearing my voice, she asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d with a slightly nervous look on her face.Himegasaki was called the flower on a high peak, someone who was out of one\u2019s league. Calm and withdrawn. However, when observed closely, it seemed she didn\u2019t interact with people because of her weakness in forming human relationships.\u201cI have to think about what to give to my little sister, do you know any stuff like pens, pen cases, or notebooks, that look good for girls?\u201d\u201cW-why are you asking me?\u201d\u201cI thought that Himegasaki had good taste based on your belongings. I noticed that when we did experiments together in class last time.\u201dThe female students were jealous and envious of Himegasaki. I never had any interest in Himegasaki herself. Even her body parts that the other classmates paid attention to were nothing more than masses of flesh and blood, so I didn\u2019t care.However, her personality, appearance, role, and ability were convenient for fueling jealousy. Himegasaki had it all.\u201cI-I understand. I will search a few stores that look good and tell you.\u201d\u201cThank you, that helps me a lot. I\u2019m glad I asked Himegasaki.\u201dWhen I exaggerated, Himegasaki averted her gaze with an easy-to-read expression.There was nothing easier to handle than a naive human being.That\u2019s why I casually displayed special treatment only to Himegasaki. When I led her to become class representatives together, she easily agreed, just as I wanted. While giving a sense of superiority, I stepped back quietly, drawing the delicate line where I seemed reachable and not at the same time.\u201cHimegasaki is really helpful. Back then you also taught me the question I\u2019d been troubled with.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do that much\u2026\u201d\u201cYou study so well. I have to do my best too.\u201dSometimes I would say something insinuating and then keep my distance again. I\u2019d give her words and deeds that would build her confidence. Himegasaki lowered her head with blushing cheeks and said, \u201cWell, just hearing that from you is enough\u2026\u201d The sight made my heart grow cold and I felt foolish.If only Mai could fall in love with me easily, I wouldn\u2019t have had to go through as much trouble as this. I\u2019d been calling out others as Himegasaki\u2019s spare, but none of them acquired the results I wanted. Only Mai was the one not aware of me at all. On the contrary, even when I tried to create a good atmosphere, I would end up being chased with a modified handcart and end up with a meaningless interaction.\u201cUhm, why don\u2019t we study together next time? The two of us.\u201d\u201cEh, just the two of us?\u201dI made a surprised expression at Himegasaki\u2019s suggestion. When I showed a faint refusal tone, she added, panicked, \u201cB-but. it\u2019d also be fine with everyone.\u201d Push and pull, refuse coldly and treat her kindly after. While worrying about my situation with Mai, I smiled and said, \u201cyeah, I wish to do it with everyone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She decided the right time to hold another study session and called other classmates to join us at my house. Please read this chapter only at ChocoCats.I let Mai see when Himegasaki and I are together, to make her realize that her brother was getting close to other people of the opposite sex that wasn\u2019t herself. I instilled that into her to show that her brother is actually a man.But I also have been careful not to make my classmates think that I like Himegasaki. Because if later she becomes a hindrance and I need to eliminate her, I won\u2019t need that kind of after-effect.On the other hand, I emphasized to Himegasaki that I am not blood-related with Mai, to incite her jealousy toward Mai and raised the sense of competition.As a result, Himegasaki worked well as bait. Whether it was in front of other classmates during the study session or in any other situation, she showed a good favour towards me with her attitude and speech in every possible way. Please read this chapter only at ChocoCats.Of course, even in front of Mai.However, it is useless. When I asked Mai for sweets or cutlery, rather than creating opportunities for me to have contact with her, it seemed that Mai was trying to set me up with Himegasaki.She sent me together with Himegasaki to buy a drink and created an opportunity for just the two of us alone. She pretended to be nonchalant about it, but I knew. In the end, the plan failed.Also, my classmates who come over to my house treated her favourably, saying she\u2019s so cute and all.Some asked me for her number, and some tried to contact Mai privately.There is even someone who already invited her out. I would never made such a mistake before. Come to think of it, Mai\u2019s way of thinking was unique. On the other hand, I applied a pattern of common people\u2019s way of thinking to my plan, so no wonder it failed. I noticed that right after I failed. I wonder how foolish I have become. Please read this chapter only at ChocoCats.If it was me before I fell in love with Mai, I might have ridiculed my own idiocy.\u201cKurobe, is it okay if I ask your sister out?\u201dWhen the boring class was over and I was collecting the notes the teacher told me to, Nagatani, who was in the same class, lightheartedly asked me.\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cAh, how I should say it\u2026 I think your sister is cute. But she\u2019s your sister, so I thought I should ask for your permission first just in case.\u201dAfter entering high school, in order to not get suspicious when I leave early and worried about my sister\u2019s wellbeing, I gave the impression to those around me that she had a severely frail constitution. Just in case Mai won\u2019t receive a low valuation when entering high school, I also added that there are so many times she couldn\u2019t calm down because she often stayed at home.\u201cYour sister is cute and I feel like I need to protect her.\u201dJust like that, when I saw his smiling face while playing dumb, I felt my body freeze all in one breath.Is it her face, or her behaviour, I don\u2019t know. Or maybe he just like younger people. However, I understood well that his definition of \u201ccute\u201d is different from what humans said to a newborn baby.But it didn\u2019t matter what his intentions are. I thought I\u2019d eliminate it.

I thought it was only during the test period, but apparently, it continued even after the test was over. On the day of the study session, my brother would come home with everyone, and I couldn\u2019t offer surprises because everyone was there. This week my brother would be going on a school trip abroad and away for three days, so I became even more impatient. Please read this at ChocoCats.That\u2019s why I had no choice but to do my best to bring my brother and Himegasaki together.Thus today, I called Himegasaki-san to the kitchen while saying, \u201cCould you help me carry the drinks?\u201d\u201cWait a minute\u2026 they\u2019re going to be at room temperature, I will prepare some ice\u2026\u201dHimegasaki-san now stood behind me as I pretended to rummage through the shelf.I planned to make Himegasaki-san buy juice together with my brother by pretending that we didn\u2019t have any juice.After that, all I had to do was act like a selfish sister who begged her brother in the living room, \u201cThere\u2019s no juice, can you go and buy some? Ah, buy ice cream for me too!\u201d and force him to go with, \u201cI have to study because I\u2019m taking the exam this year!\u201d excuse.\u201cHimegasaki-san, I\u2019m sorry, it looks like we don\u2019t have enough juice. Please wait, I will call my brother!\u201dT/N: All this [out of juice] phrases gave me headache, or maybe because I\u2019ve been looping\u00a0Juice by Lizzo? lmaoWhen I was about to head to my brother\u2019s room after I said that, suddenly my arm was grabbed by Himegasaki-san.\u201cHimegasaki-san?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m actually\u2026 thinking of confessing to Mai-chan\u2019s brother, no, I mean Makoto-kun.\u201dHimegasaki-san\u2019s words naturally made my chest hurt. This moment was the best opportunity she had been waiting for. But strangely enough, my heart ached. I nodded in order to hide my turmoil.\u201cPlease do your bes-\u201c\u201cWill you root for me?\u201dBefore I could finish my words, the restless Himegasaki-san asked me, so I made sure to answer \u201cof course!\u201d to her.I hoped it would keep going well. If it went well\u2026 the tragedy wouldn\u2019t happen, and my brother wouldn\u2019t have to end his life. But it strangely hurt.\u201cOnii-chan, I will call him. Please buy, the juice.\u201dT/N: Error 404, Mai is broken ahahahaha.Just now, did I speak correctly? I wasn\u2019t sure. My limp feet dragged as I headed over to my brother\u2019s room. Please read this at ChocoCats.T/N: When reality hits hard lmao\u25c7A few hours after Himegasaki-san announced her confession, I laid around on my bed, feeling perplexed by the mysterious pain. I didn\u2019t know what happened to them after that. After my brother and Himegasaki-san left, I went back to my room. After that, for my surprise supplies, I modified a radio controller and attached a motor to the handcart that I received from my second cousin, to make it move faster. I didn\u2019t even feel like eating dinner and just stayed inside my room. Please read this at ChocoCats.What was this feeling, was it guilt? The guilt of making the flower in the class, Himegasaki-san, get together with my brother, the Kurobe-kun.No, it really hurt, maybe I was sick. It made me want to cry and I really didn\u2019t like it. My stomach hurt too.I wanted it to stop. When I was rolling around in bed, I suddenly heard a knock. This systematic knocking sound belonged to my brother. Without answering the knock, I hid inside my blanket and heard the door open.He went inside my room without asking.I didn\u2019t care, I would just pretend to be asleep. I was sleeping. I had gone to bed in a huff.\u2026No, why did I have to go to bed in a huff? Did that even count as going to bed?T/N: this is supposed to be a word twist, me and Cinnamon-san did our best to make it as close as the raw ;w; but well, sorry it\u2019s not as funny as the raw ;w;No, anyway I\u2019m sleeping. Please don\u2019t wake me up.As I stayed still, my brother\u2019s footsteps eventually stopped in front of me. Without a pause, he grabbed my shoulder from above the blanket, and I felt a squeeze from his touch.\u201cMai, even if you pretend to be asleep, I know you aren\u2019t. Because your breathing rhythm is different.\u201dThrough the blanket, my brother\u2019s voice sounded like a mumble. Maybe that was why it sounded different.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cToday, Himegasaki confessed to me.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dEven though it was supposed to be a happy and good thing, I accidentally said that in a harsh tone.\u201c\u2026What do you think?\u201d\u201cNothing in particular.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201dAfter the retort, I felt an impact on my back with a thud. I got out of the blanket to find my brother on top with his face so close to me.\u201cHuh? What are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, so I thought I should move closer.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026 You are heavy, move aside.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t received an answer yet.\u201d\u201cArghhh!\u201dWhen I yelled at him, as expected maybe because of his good ears, my brother let me go and said, \u201cToo loud\u2026\u201d. As soon as I got up, my brother was scowling at me.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cBecause Mai doesn\u2019t understand people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dWhy do I have to be told by my brother about understanding people\u2019s feelings? The one who didn\u2019t understand was him. I was pretty sure that if I surveyed 100 people about it, I would win with 100-0.\u201cEnough, I have a headache and I still have to study, so please get out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tutor you.\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201dI got up and drove out my brother. He was still about to say something, but I pressured him to leave. I heard my mother\u2019s angry voice from downstairs but I vented my anger by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d and closed the door. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I\u2019m glad I made it this week! It\u2019s getting closer to D-day, maybe I\u2019m excited.Also, the modified handcart finally explained lmao. Truth to be told, I was confused at first when Makoto (last chapter) mentioned that when he tried to create a good atmosphere between him and Mai he will get chased by modified handcart instead. I suspect it\u2019s another wonderful creation of Mai, and I was right ahaha.This chapter was fun to translate because Mai really sounds like rebellious teenager and that\u2019s cute ahaha. I love how she knows she\u2019s sulking but still didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s being sulky.Anyway, see you in the next chapter!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today school is half-day, so the classes are only until the fifth period. I was supposed to go home right away, but there is a kind of unspoken rule that my brother will come pick me up, so I had to stay and wait for him. Yukari-chan is in the sewing club, thus I\u2019m waiting with her in the home economics room.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? Otherwise, we can\u2019t do club activities and go home.\u201dSpeaking of Iwai, whenever the baseball club had some free time, he would drop by like this. I was wondering whether his performance at the tournament will be affected if he often skipped his practice like this, but it seems there is a high rate of high schoolers dying from heatstroke, so the school were obligated to take a twenty-minute break every hour of practice.T/N: NGL, Iwai is a very sad 2nd ML imo, I mean, his screen time is sooooo little in the novel (because of Mai\u2019s POV that never really noticed him), but he\u2019s actually always there for Mai. He\u2019s even willing to sacrifice his practice time just to hang out with her. Lol.When I peeked into the schoolyard from the window, I could see the baseball team\u2019s figures resting in the shade under the lush green trees. Combined with the yellow sunflowers growing nearby and the blue sky, the white baseball uniform looks great.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see my brother\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did you get into a fight?\u201d Yukari-chan asked me.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just one-sidedly annoyed when I looked at my brother\u2026 I even took it out on my mother.\u201d\u201cAre you a scoundrel?\u201dIwai\u2019s straightforward words pierced my heart. I clung to Yukari-chan, and she stroked my head while saying, \u201cThere, there\u2026\u201d.\u201cBut, why did Mai-chan get so irritated?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because my brother is going to have a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cThen, that\u2019s Mai-chan\u2019s fault.\u201dHer timid tone of voice pierced even deeper into my heart. My stomach hurts.\u201cIf Yukari-chan\u2019s brother got a girlfriend, won\u2019t you feel frustrated too?\u201d\u201cMy brother has never had a girlfriend, but I believe I won\u2019t get frustrated. Though in your case, I think it\u2019s obvious that Mai-chan feels that way.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause since elementary school, Mai-chan has always said that you want to marry your brother. Then if he has a girlfriend, Mai-chan\u2019s dream won\u2019t come true, right?\u201d\u201cDream\u2026\u201dCertainly, I have liked my brother since I was little. But that was because I\u2019m Kurobe Mai. This feeling was due to the manga scenario, I wanted to change my brother\u2019s future because I didn\u2019t want him to become a killer.But even though I didn\u2019t want my brother to become a murderer, I also didn\u2019t want him to date Himegasaki-san. This contradiction was\u2026\u201cOh, your brother has arrived.\u201d Iwai told me.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhen I looked out the window, my brother was standing near the school gate. My brother didn\u2019t seem to be having a study session today as he was alone.\u201cYou should apologize to your brother.\u201dYukari looked at me with a smile. And Iwai continued, \u201cDo your best.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 See you later.\u201dWhile I was still unable to calm my confused heart, I left the place.Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7\u201cMai.\u201dAs I headed over to my brother, maybe he heard my footsteps, he immediately turned around to greet me. Without exchanging words, my brother held out his hand to me, and I silently took his hand.Please read this at ChocoCats.Even though we parted just like that yesterday, this morning my brother still escorted me to school. I still made a lunch box, and nothing has changed except that there is no conversation.I think it\u2019s better to apologize for venting out my anger. But in the end, I was just trying to find an excuse for why I didn\u2019t apologize like I don\u2019t want to apologize without knowing why I\u2019m frustrated, or I don\u2019t want to have a conversation yet, etc.\u201cAbout next week\u2019s homestay\u2026\u201dMy brother mutters vaguely. After that, he didn\u2019t continue his words.When I eavesdropped on the explanation given to my parents the day before yesterday, it seems my brother\u2019s class would see the illuminations and tour the ranch.So, I was going to modify a pushcart for toddlers, install a sparkling and lit-up cow with illumination and chase him around a day before. For that reason, I have to apologize quickly.When I was clenching my free hand that wasn\u2019t holding my brother\u2019s hand, my brother suddenly lost his balance.\u201c\u2026Onii-chan?\u201dMy brother crouched down and started coughing violently. I wanted to rub his back right away, but my brother held my hand firmly so I couldn\u2019t. I have to face him and rub his back with my free hand.\u201cOnii-chan, are you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 well, I think it\u2019s cold\u2026? If I sleep well, I will get better soon.\u201dWhile saying that, my brother coughed painfully. He also seemed pale. When I stroked his back for a while and offered him a water bottle, my brother put his hand on his mouth and shook his head.\u201cLet\u2019s go home, Mai. I want to go home and rest\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go home, Onii-chan.\u201dI want to support him, but he holds my hand tightly and won\u2019t let go. I clutched his hand tightly so at least he wouldn\u2019t stagger and hurried home.Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I hope you guys enjoy your weekend!

Even though he had no appetite and kept coughing severely, he just took sick leave and didn\u2019t seem like he would want to go to the hospital. So on the morning of his overseas trip, when my mother informed me that my brother will absent from that, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cMom is going to the office today because I have documents that need to be stamped. But I\u2019ll be back in the afternoon to take your brother to the hospital, so if he\u2019s going to be hospitalized, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAs we passed our days peacefully like this, the day of the tragedy was still getting closer, but I didn\u2019t want to present a trail of dominoes to a sick person. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to surprise him if he recovers quickly, but I\u2019m genuinely worried that he\u2019s been absent for a long time.In addition, my mother was usually at home, but today she had to go to work\u2026 My mother might have said that for the worst case, but when I heard he might get hospitalized, I became uneasy.\u201cMai, if you don\u2019t go soon, you\u2019ll be late.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go.\u201dWhen I was looking upstairs where my brother was supposed to be, my mother couldn\u2019t help but slap me on the back. If I didn\u2019t go soon, I will be late for school. I left the house together with my mother with a lingering feeling on my back. My mother\u2019s company and my junior high school were in opposite directions, so when I looked back, I could see my mother\u2019s back walking quickly.The sky looks like it was going to be sunny, it was a clear blue sky without any clouds, but my heart didn\u2019t feel clear at all.My father had to leave early today too, so my brother is now home alone. Until now, my brother has nearly never caught a cold. That\u2019s why, he might not get used to being sick, and I feel like I couldn\u2019t leave him alone like that.As I slung my school bag over my shoulder and walked along the familiar school route, my vague emotions began to overflow.Would it be better for me to not go to school?After all, it would be reassuring for the person who would always try to do tricks to stay outside\u2026 or so I thought, but back before I died\u2026 the me who was staring out the window alone in the hospital room overlapped with my brother\u2019s figure, and I turned my heels.It\u2019s okay to be late for school.I ran back home. By the time I could see the house, my pent-up and uncertain mind had already made up.\u201cHuh?\u201dMy heart was set on nursing my resting brother, but my eyes widened when I saw the said person standing next to the shoe rack. His complexion wasn\u2019t particularly bad. If only he didn\u2019t wear his casual attire, I won\u2019t feel bothered at all if he said he will go to school. My brother stared at me with a disinterested look.Did he find out that I plan to go back? Or was he about to leave the house?\u201cOnii-chan, why are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause I could see you run back home from my room. What\u2019s wrong? Did you forget something? Or did you forget to take the key?\u201dUnder my brother\u2019s somewhat investigating eyes, I stepped back. But I was already home, there is no turning back, so I went inside and shut the door.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of taking care of you. I don\u2019t want you to die while everyone is away.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t?\u201dMy brother turned his gaze away from me when I asked back because his indifferent answer made me uneasy.\u201cDo whatever you want. Mother has gone to work, so I will contact Mai\u2019s school.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll take care of Onii-chan.\u201dI took my bag off my shoulder and walked to the living room. My brother without returning to his room made his way towards the home telephone.\u201cWhat about breakfast?\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t eaten.\u201d\u201cDo you have any appetite?\u201d\u201cMaybe a little.\u201dI rolled up my sleeves while listening to my brother\u2019s brief reply and stood in the kitchen.Let\u2019s make porridge. If I make it, not only it would be easier for my mother, but even if it couldn\u2019t be eaten now, my brother can eat it after he came back from the hospital. There are many medicines that couldn\u2019t be taken on an empty stomach after all, so it would be better to have them around.When I was washing my hands in the kitchen, I could see my brother making a phone call over the counter. As the phone connected, I heard a polite and clear voice saying, \u201cThank you for all of your trust all this time.\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Mai Kurobe\u2019s older brother. Yes\u2026 I have fever since yesterday, so we are going to the hospital today, but just in case, I want her to take days off for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow\u2026\u201dHearing my brother\u2019s words, I was so startled that I almost said \u201cHuh?\u201d out loud, but I endured it.I could understand if it was just the notice for today\u2019s absence. But why tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too? From tomorrow onwards, my mother would usually be working from home, so there was no need for me to be here\u2026 While I was confused, my brother continued to talk to the teacher with an apologetic voice.\u201cI apologize for the trouble, I\u2019m fine\u2026 She caught my cold\u2026 Uh, yes\u2026 Mother doesn\u2019t want her to go now\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, thank you for your help\u2026\u201dMy brother coughed badly and hung up the phone. Maybe because he was having trouble breathing, he then let out a big sigh. I was thinking of passing him some water, but he turned to me with a nonchalant face, so I became dumbfounded.\u201cUhm, do you need water? How is your cough?\u201d\u201cWhen the call ends, it disappears.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 anyway, Onii-chan, why did you make me take days off for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause if it\u2019s influenza or a highly contagious disease, Mai might be infected even if you don\u2019t have any symptoms. If that happens, you will spread the virus throughout the school, right? Are you fine with that?\u201dThere was nothing wrong with what my brother said. He was definitely right. However, his figure who spoke in a half-threatening manner didn\u2019t look like he was infected with influenza to me. I wonder if my brother really has influenza. After all, it\u2019s June now. But there might also be the possibility of another disease\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll tutor you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dMy brother rested his elbow on the kitchen counter and looked at me. Then, he pressed me with, \u201cIs the porridge not yet done?\u201d and tapped the counter.I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I was being persuaded to just go along with it. But leaving my brother alone was also a problem, and I wanted him to get well soon.Would it be fine to sacrifice three days of school for that reason? While I was thinking of that, I started making rice porridge under my brother\u2019s supervision. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t mother late?\u201dPlease read this at ChocoCats.My brother finished eating the porridge I made, while also adding an extra comment \u201ctoday\u2019s meal is normal, huh\u201d in between. When I checked the clock, the hands showed past eleven o\u2019clock. While glancing at the sunlight that has begun to shine through the room, I looked at my brother. My brother who was relaxing on the sofa didn\u2019t appear to be suffering from any illness.My mother said that she would go to the office for a while, go home, and take my brother to the hospital. She left home around eight in the morning, so three hours had passed. It\u2019s late already.\u201cI wonder what happened to her?\u201d\u201cBecause of an accident, the line mother used was delayed.\u201dBecause of what? Before I could object, my brother sluggishly swipe through his smartphone and showed it to me. There was information about the delay on the screen, indicating that another route that my mother was using had an accident.\u201cI recommended it because I thought it was a faster route, but I guess it was a mistake.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cI told her it would be faster than her usual route, but it seems by taking that line ended up being the slowest. Apparently, there are many jumps on this route. It seems there are no platform doors in between.\u201dFor a moment, I suspected that it was my brother\u2019s work.Because my brother looks very happy now. He seemed to want to say \u201cI feel good when things go my way\u201d, and he didn\u2019t look disappointed at all.But there\u2019s no way he could manipulate an accident on the train route\u2026 Besides, I think that my brother would rather want to see the moment of the accident happen first.\u201cHey, Onii-chan\u2026\u201d\u201cI feel like my fever is going down. I\u2019ll tutor you, so let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d\u201cEh, a-alright. Yeah\u2026\u201dSomehow, I felt like I had been tricked again. While feeling somehow uncomfortable with my brother\u2019s attitude, I took his outstretched hand. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I\u2019m sorry for the late post. Last week was a bit busy for me and my weekend also had been so hectic so I couldn\u2019t finish them all on time. Sorry about that, I will try to keep the schedule on time next.Anyway, see you in the next chapter! And have a great day!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Riding a plane all the way and sacrificing sleep time just to listen to the explanation of the importance of cultural exchanges, even as a joke, was foolish. Please read this at ChocoCats.If I have time to do that, it would be more useful to go carry on with the plan to get Mai. That was my thought.That\u2019s why, I pretended to be sick, and on the day of the event, I purposely told one of the parents the routes where fatal accidents occur frequently, and created a space where I could be together with Mai. When one of them came back, the parent was surprised to find Mai not going to school, but when I explained that I had her take days off because Mai might have an infection, that parent was easily convinced.It didn\u2019t take much time and effort for me to deceive them, but I was worried that it will be troublesome in the future.That\u2019s why today, I acted as if my health had improved with a slightly better complexion. Or rather, there was no abnormal physical condition from the very beginning. I showed them indirectly that I had returned to my normal condition, and convinced the parents this time it was Mai who not feeling well, so we went to the hospital together in the morning.Both parents weren\u2019t there because of work. I randomly described the symptoms that corresponded to a common cold and were prescribed medicine. Because the medicine must be taken after the meal, we ended up having lunch in the cafe inside the hospital.\u201cOnii-chan, can you taste it properly? Do you know what\u2019s in it\u2026?\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s salmon and spinach, right?\u201d\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201dI hadn\u2019t eaten since morning, so I ate risotto, and Mai looked at me with a worried look on her face while eating a hot dog. Before long, maybe because she was thirsty, she cautiously reached for the iced coffee and made a face like the end of the world when she sipped it.Previously, when I was ordering coffee, Mai said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t drink coffee because you have a cold, right? It\u2019s bitter.\u201d and switched my coffee with her apple juice. I read the medicine precautions, wondering if the medicine can be drunk with coffee, and as a result of running to the medicine delivery counter, I was drinking Mai\u2019s apple juice.\u201cWanna change?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 because it\u2019s a wall that I have to overcome someday\u2026\u201dAnd Mai drank the coffee I ordered with a gloomy face.\u201cHey, can you really taste if it\u2019s sweet or bitter? It\u2019s good that you now have some appetite, but it doesn\u2019t because you can\u2019t really taste anything, does it?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s sweet.\u201dThe apple juice I got from Mai was sweet. But in spite of its numbing sweetness, it wasn\u2019t too unpleasant. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7After having lunch, I took a detour on my way home. There is an art museum near the hospital. Mai was looking at me suspiciously, and I thought she was suspecting me of feigning sick, but turns out she was worried that I was overdoing myself. Please read this at ChocoCats.Mai said, \u201cInside the art museum, you have to walk, you know?\u201d no matter how I see it, she was so worried about me. Instead of feeling guilty, I was just happy. Rather than finding it silly for being easily deceived, there was a strong sense of satisfaction that I\u2019m inside Mai\u2019s head.The contents of the exhibition in the museum that we saw were painting from the medical treatment points of view, and there were works such as patients undergoing treatment and even works that were drawn for later studies lined up.Back then, I would have been excited to see any part of a living body being cut, and I would have been excited by the vivid colour that overflowed from there. And yet, I couldn\u2019t feel excited over that as I used to feel in the past. It was just paintings of body parts, it looked just like the humans and animals walking around.\u201cHey, was the exhibition interesting? How is your body?\u201dMai tilted her head at the caf\u00e9 inside the building, where conversation was allowed. I couldn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t get anything at all, so I gave a curt reply, \u201csome of it\u201d.\u201cAs expected, you are still feeling unwell, aren\u2019t you? Let\u2019s go home?\u201d\u201cNo, I was the one who decided to go, but I think it was a complicated world even for me.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dMai made a dubious face. If it was before, I would reply \u201cit was very interesting\u201d. Because the common answer to such grotesque works is either that or \u201cit was scary\u201d.In my personal opinion, I might have thought it was \u201cbeautiful\u201d. But now it feels no different from the guardrails around here.\u201cHow about Mai?\u201d\u201cMaybe I should draw pictures. I learnt a lot from looking at them.\u201d\u201cAre you aiming to become a painter?\u201d\u201cNo, but humans are creatures that aim high.\u201dAnd yet, the blood colour of Mai\u2019s lips that said such stupid things, the colour of her skin that was exposed from the hem of her clothes, and her fluttering black hair were incredibly vivid.\u201cSomehow you looked like you had fun, but what? You went to a cafe in the end?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dMaybe I was already perverted. I didn\u2019t get anything meaningful from an exhibit that I was sure if it was me before, I would have been satisfied with. And instead, I feel the emptiness inside me filled in an instant by looking at Mai who was looking with shining eyes at the cakes with lots of creams, which would give me heartburn just looking at them, in a caf\u00e9 near the museum. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7Perhaps because we stopped by the cafe in the art museum, when we went out, it was already evening. Mai said, \u201cdon\u2019t you feel like eating ice cream when you have a fever?\u201d and went to the convenience store to buy ice cream, and when we got home, Mai tried to put me to sleep but it was still 3 pm. Please read this at ChocoCats.In the end, I told her that I won\u2019t be able to sleep at night if I sleep now, so the two of us sit on the sofa in the living room, turned on the TV randomly, and absentmindedly watched a rebroadcasting foreign movie.\u201cI wonder if all the characters will die. What do you think, Onii-chan?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t one person survive? Even if everyone dies in this situation, it would still be an emotional ending, right?\u201dThe movie wasn\u2019t interesting at all. A typical, templated ensemble story. But even though it was certainly boring, holding hands with Mai made me confusedly feel like I was spending an extraordinarily meaningful time.\u201cWho will survive? I guess it\u2019s the baby.\u201d\u201cIs that what you think? A child?\u201dWhile talking nonsense, I intentionally touched Mai\u2019s hand and wondered if there was something in it. Mai said, \u201cIt\u2019s ticklish\u201d while trying to let go, so I hurriedly gripped her tighter.\u201cWhat, are you tired of the movie already? Do you want to arm wrestling?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see the movie.\u201dAs Mai said that, she turned her attention to the TV again.Mai\u2019s hands were slightly softer and whiter than my own skin, but there was no particular difference other than that. I want to pull off this arm, I couldn\u2019t even ask for the satisfaction feeling of doing it with my own hands. After touching and confirming everything, I continued watching the boring movie with Mai. Please read this at ChocoCats.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay54 DAYS AGOTwo days have passed since my brother was absent from the homestay study trip. My brother\u2019s condition seems to go back and forth between sick and healthy. Please read this at ChocoCats.There were times when he went somewhere he looked extremely healthy, for a moment I thought he was faking it, but there wasn\u2019t any reason for him to continue pretending to be sick. If it\u2019s my brother, normally he would stop. That\u2019s why I roughly gave him sports drinks regularly, and I talked to him so he won\u2019t be bored alone.As for my mother, she naturally opposed me taking care of my brother, but in the end, when my brother\u2019s said, \u201clet her do as she pleases\u201d, she nodded her head.The current time was 7:30 pm. It was actually time for my brother to take a bath, but he seemed to have a fever so headed to his room after I prepared a towel and a bucket to wipe his body. I had adjusted the hot water for now, but I also brought an electric kettle because it would be lukewarm anyway.\u201cOnii-chan, I\u2019m coming in.\u201dAfter I knocked and entered the room, my brother was in bed leaning against the wall. He was pretty healthy at dinner, but now he looked dazed. I couldn\u2019t feel the sharpness that always comes from Kurobe-kun.\u201cI brought water to wipe your body. I\u2019ll leave it here.\u201d\u201cWipe me.\u201dI barely endured myself to almost reflexively say, \u201chuh?\u201d It might not be good to say this to a sick person, but I was reluctant because his reply somehow showed too many intentions.\u201cMy body feels sluggish.\u201d\u201cUhm, then I\u2019ll wipe your arms, back, and stomach, but do the rest yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201dWhen my brother turned his body towards me, he made a face as if saying, \u201cthen, please.\u201d It seemed he didn\u2019t want to bother taking off his shirt\u2019s buttons. Putting down the bucket and the towel, I approached my brother and quickly unbuttoned his shirt. He didn\u2019t seem to be wearing anything inside, and his skin, which seemed to be several times finer than any other human\u2019s, was exposed. I tried not to look at him as much as possible when I wrung the towel and wiped my brother\u2019s arm.Probably because he didn\u2019t have any energy, his arm felt limp and heavy. While I tried to wipe him carefully so it won\u2019t hurt him, my brother muttered in a whisper.\u201c\u2026I rejected.\u201dWhat was that about, my brother didn\u2019t say anything. No subject.My brother looked straight at me while I was at a loss for a reaction. Because I was standing in front of him who sat on the bed, so he looked at me with his eyes upturned. But somehow there was some pressure there.\u201cWh-what is?\u201d\u201cI rejected Himegasaki\u2019s confession.\u201dMy brother had an indifferent tone of voice. He didn\u2019t look like he just rejected someone\u2019s confession. Rather, he seemed to lack emotion, as if he was being dumped.And yet, somehow, I felt a sense of relief, as if my hardened heart had softened.Why is that\u2026 I felt very relieved and my restless feeling just suddenly disappeared. But it was a good chance for my brother to divert his cruel hobby\u2026\u201cWon\u2019t you regret it?\u201dI didn\u2019t even know how that words came out of me. I wondered what I wished to hear from my brother\u2019s reply. I didn\u2019t know.But it was an undeniable fact that I was relieved when I heard that my brother rejected her. As if taking advantage of it, it slipped out from my lips.Now that I\u2019ve said that, there won\u2019t be turning back. I knew I should have followed up, but I couldn\u2019t say anything. Please read this at ChocoCats.While thinking about what to do, my brother put his hand lightly on my head.\u201cNever.\u201dMy brother raised the corners of his mouth. His self-deprecating smile, which could not be called triumphant, slowly heated up the depths of my heart.\u201cBy the way, you too, Mai, what are you going to do with Hase\u2019s invitation?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dAs an unexpected question was thrown at me, I blinked. My brother looked at me sharply and said, \u201cRefuse it.\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t tell me, I will refuse. I don\u2019t have time, there is the exam after all.\u201d\u201cRefuse even if there is no exam.\u201dMy brother grabbed my hand which was wiping his body. I thought he would break my hand for a moment, the momentum was just amazing, but the power was enough to pull a finger.\u201cRefuse him.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 It\u2019s hurt! It hurts! What are you\u2026?\u201dWhen I reflexively tried to say something back, my brother bit my finger. For a moment, I thought he had evolved into a type of psychopath who eats people, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case as he looked at me and said, \u201cbecause you didn\u2019t listen to me\u201d.\u201cNo, just because I don\u2019t listen\u2026 is this a lion\u2019s training? But I\u2019m a human, you know?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHow scary\u2026 Have you gone mad\u2026? My finger will have a mark\u2026 The index finger is the most used finger too, oh come on\u2026\u201d\u201cWould it be better if it wasn\u2019t your index finger?\u201d\u201cThe thumb is out of the question, and the pinky finger is too fragile, if it\u2019s the ring finger, I may barely tolerate it, but the next time you bite me, I\u2019ll stab your stomach with my thumb.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u201cIt hurts when you got stabbed in the stomach with a thumb. Yukari-chan seems to often do that to her Onii-chan.\u201dMy brother laughed scornfully at my story. But he looks at me thoughtfully for a while.\u201cThat temple girl\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you going to diss her again? Let me tell you, the reading session wouldn\u2019t have been successful without Yukari-chan, and she\u2019s my most important friend.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. For what I said back then, it was my bad.\u201dThen what? When I glared at my brother wondering what he was going to say, he looked straight at me.\u201cFor such a person, Mai would be like a salvation existence, isn\u2019t it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cStop it, why do you have to immediately say \u2018huh\u2019 on everything I said. A person with such a personality will often be misunderstood, you know.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been saying nonsenses today\u2026 Come to think of it, maybe you have a fever?\u201d\u201cNo, my temperature is normal today.\u201dMy brother made fun of my worries in return. After a while, I completely wiped my brother\u2019s upper body. The rest was the lower part. While I was on it, I also wiped below his knees, but couldn\u2019t do the rest of it, so I stopped. After thinking of just leaving the room as it was, I called out to my brother.\u201cSuch a pretty person like Himegasaki-san, are you really sure?\u201dKeeping my hand on the doorknob, I fixed my line sight on the door. The sound of the second hand felt awfully loud, and the bed spring creaked. Before I could turn around, pat, a hand was placed on my head. Pat, pat. It\u2019s different from stroking, the hand that was placed on my head kept touching while moving, and eventually combed my hair.\u201cEven if you say she\u2019s pretty if you burn them and turn them into bones, everyone will be the same. If you peel the skin, it\u2019s just a lump of meat.\u201dMy brother removed his hand from my head. My cheeks are hot. I feel like my heartbeat is getting louder violently. I turned around but was stunned by what I saw.The bookshelf on my brother\u2019s behind. On the second shelf.The shelf where Kurobe-kun installed a door with a key and hid a box containing his diary about his impressions of killing animals, as well as a kitchen knife, knives, and an improved airgun. In order to camouflage his gentle, perfect, and popular honour student image, he sealed Pandora\u2019s box there.Last summer, it was statistics books and reference books. And yet.I couldn\u2019t see the reference books that should have been lined up on the second shelf of the bookshelf behind my brother now. A black panel was attached as if to match the dark colour of the bookshelf, and a small padlock was attached at the bottom. Please read this at ChocoCats.Even though until last year, it wasn\u2019t there.Now, the night of tragedy has emerged.It appeared.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I apologize terribly for not updating for quite a long time.

Today\u2019s date was July 28th. In short, it was the day my brother in the manga would kill me. Please read this at ChocoCats.Over the past two months, I\u2019ve tried my hardest to surprise my brother in order to convert him no matter what it takes, but he wasn\u2019t surprised even by the slightest thing.In the end, the surprise offerings I had made up until now hadn\u2019t changed my brother\u2019s heart. But, how should I put it\u2026 I haven\u2019t given up yet. The last and most mischievous surprise\u2026 the plan to confine him, still remained. There was no time to be discouraged.\u201cMai, father and mother will leave tomorrow at 6. Behave and listen to what Onii-chan says, okay?\u201dMy parents were packing their bags behind me. My brother, who was by my side, was helping while saying, \u201call checked up? No forgotten things?\u201d with a smartphone in one hand.\u201cHey Mai, are you listening properly?\u201d\u201cI know. Father and mother too, be careful on your way.\u201dOut of all days, my parents were going to the neighbourhood association\u2019s hot springs for two nights and three days, when tomorrow, the death game will be held.I didn\u2019t have to confine him if my brother can go on the trip with them! That\u2019s what I thought, so I suggested that we all go together, but it was useless. Maybe Kurobe chose that day for the tragedy because his parents weren\u2019t there. That was why my parents came home on August 1st\u2026 In short, I would be alone with my brother until the end of the death game.I think my brother was going to use this opportunity to hold a death game. Therefore, I would also take advantage of this opportunity to confine my brother until August.I had prepared food and water to survive inside for three days straight, including some spare, and a shampoo and body soap set that could be used without water.I prepared handcuffs and secretly bought a chain online that would allow me to move to the toilet. In the first place, my room was filled with surprise goods, so it wouldn\u2019t be suspicious if I bought something strange.And in order not to deteriorate my out-of-norm brother\u2019s mental health more, I rented movies and bought novels on my smartphone so that he could live a comfortable confinement life. With this opportunity, I even bought a game.I couldn\u2019t help to feel it would have been better if I didn\u2019t offer surprises from the beginning, but in the end, tomorrow the tragedy would still take place.Furthermore, today, the day before the death game, I will be used as the scapegoat to be brutally murdered until my body became unrecognisable.But I knew I would be killed. Just in case, I wore a blade-proof vest, and bandages all over my body to disguise it. I wore a cast around my neck while pretending to do cosplay. In case I would be pricked in the eyes, I also put on goggles. Maybe it was because I had been cosplaying as a hamburger and an origami crane so far, so no one even gave a glance when I dressed like this. Please read this at ChocoCats.It was 8 am now. If things stayed like this, I would stay in the living room permanently. Luckily, there was no sign that my parents\u2019 packing would end, so I would be safe here.\u201cMai, isn\u2019t it the time for you to get changed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dI would be fine if I stayed here. That conviction was crushed at once by my brother\u2019s abrupt words. When I blinked my eyes, my mother, as if supporting my brother\u2019s words, added on.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right, the cram school\u2019s field training starts at 11 am, right? You can slowly get ready.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s not school, it\u2019s not good to be late.\u201dNot understanding the meaning of my father\u2019s warning, I looked at both of my parent\u2019s faces. My brother, who had been fiddling with his smartphone then said, \u201cNow go get ready. It\u2019s already 8.\u201d and pushed me out of the living room.\u201cUhm, Onii-chan, where am I going?\u201d\u201cMai will be taking exams this year, so you will be going to a new cram school. We talked about it about two weeks ago, right? Did you forget? Or do you really not want to go?\u201dHe talked in a persuasive way, but I had no memory of being told about that.Two weeks ago, I was defeated by my brother when I talked to him in Slovak and Polish. After that, I remodelled my hamburger costume by stitching a cloth that made it look like the cheese was melting. But then, \u201cAhaha, how interesting. It makes me want to pull it out.\u201d He just pulled it out with a tone that didn\u2019t sound interested at all.He never talked about cram school.Despite that, my brother pulled my arm and naturally led my hand to go up the stairs.If he pushed me down the stairs, I will die. Wearing a hamburger costume would definitely save me, but right now I only have bandages and a stab-proof vest. In the worst case, I might also hurt my brother. I was prepared to sacrifice one arm to prevent the death game to occur, but my brother just barged into my room without pushing me down the stairs.\u201cEh, w-what is it? I haven\u2019t heard of cram school.\u201d\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201dMy brother affirmed the outrageous lie without hesitation. There was no sign of remorse as usual.\u201cUm, what is the purpose\u2026? What are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cWell. I\u2019m thinking of going to an amusement park with Mai.\u201dSaying that my brother smiled softly and took out two tickets. The tickets, with a Ferris wheel drawn in soft pastel colours reflected on them, looked like an admission ticket to a nearby amusement park. Thus, I widened my eyes. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7\u201cDear all visitors, we are informing you, it\u2019s 1.00 pm at Kuozukioka theme park.\u201d Please read this at ChocoCats.In the lively park, I saw the staff pleasantly waving their hands towards me. Up ahead, a large Ferris wheel was carrying people into the sky, and a roller coaster was running up and down along the lanes set up on the water while raising big splashes of water.After I left home, I was led by my brother, not to a guillotine, a cliff, or the depths of a mountain, but to a real amusement park.I honestly didn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t think my brother would do such a high-risk thing as killing me at an amusement park, so I wonder what his purpose was.I had certainly been to an amusement park with my family before. But that also applies to zoos and aquariums as I had been here before too. I couldn\u2019t say this place is a very familiar place. It was not the kind of special situation or a place you go to for an anniversary.What was also puzzling was that even in the amusement parks we visited, my brother didn\u2019t seem trying to kill me by taking advantage of the attractions.\u201cWhich one do you want to ride? Enter the haunted house again?\u201dMy brother, who purposely intertwined his own finger with mine, looked all around.The haunted house that I just entered was a standard Western-style building, and it wasn\u2019t an attraction that I, who had been doing surprise research there for the past year, would be perturbed by.But because my brother kept repeating brutal acts such as touching my shoulder whimsically, stroking my hair, and so on, I felt like dying.\u201cNo more haunted house.\u201d\u201cWhy? Even though It looked so fun. How about a roller coaster? It looks like it\u2019s less crowded?\u201dMy brother was saying it as if he cares about me, but I hadn\u2019t forgotten that when we went into the ride before, he purposely explained in detail about the accidents that had occurred because of the incompetent inspection. Even though the key attraction of that ride was the height level difference, it was hard to enjoy the scenery now.I wasn\u2019t going to forgive him, but when he ate a hamburger for lunch, he said, \u201cthe one Mai\u2019s made tastes better.\u201d His minus point went back to zero. But the roller coaster was still a no.\u201cThat one no, this one no, are you turning into a child because we are in an amusement park?\u201d\u201cHow can you say that\u2026 Have you forgotten what you did\u2026?\u201d\u201cHaha. Don\u2019t be so angry. Even though we are already here.\u201dMy brother looked at me with a playful smile.Even so, today was the day before the tragedy. I wondered why did my brother want to bring me to this place? And was that all?I wonder if my surprise offer has caused a change in his mind and he was thinking of making the last memory with this sister. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cOh, let\u2019s ride that.\u201dI pointed to the merry-go-round. Horses and carriages are gorgeously decorated and spin round and round. Horses were one-person rides so that way he won\u2019t be able to scare me about the maintenance faulty anymore.\u201cAlright.\u201dMy brother\u2019s feet headed towards the merry-go-round. Despite the long lines for the Ferris wheel and roller coaster, only about ten people lined up for the merry-go-round. A carriage could only hold about four people, and it was possible for two people to ride on one horse, but there were a lot of them. The number of seats was more plentiful than roller coasters and Ferris wheels, so the turnover rate was probably high.When I arrived at the merry-go-round, I was guided to the ride by the person in charge without having time to line up. I was troubled deciding if I should ride the carriage or the horse. But I couldn\u2019t worry for too long. The ride was starting to rotate. After some thought, I decided to ride a black horse near the outside. I wondered where my brother would be riding, and when I turned around after I mount my horse, he wasn\u2019t just near behind me but stood exactly right next to me.\u201cScoot over, Mai.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201dI was tapped on the shoulder. When I did as I was told, my brother rode the same horse as me with a nonchalant look on his face. I felt my brother\u2019s warmth on my back. I didn\u2019t understand.\u201cWh-why are you riding my horse\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to ride with people who can ride together, so a lot of people can ride too.\u201dEven if he said that, as I looked around, there were more horses that were not ridden by anyone, and it didn\u2019t look like people were getting into the carriage. But before I could protest, my brother\u2019s arm came around and grabbed the pole in front of me.\u201cEh, eh, ehhh\u2026\u201d\u201cLook, it\u2019s starting to move. Look forward, you are going to fall.\u201dThe merry-go-round begins to move slowly with a cheerful melody. My brother slowly brought his face closer to me as if wanting to show me the scenery.I hurriedly face forward, and my brother\u2019s hand wrapped around my stomach.\u201cO-o-o-o-o-Onii-chan? A-aren\u2019t you too close?\u201derror Mai.exe is not found lol.\u201cIf you fall from here and hit a vital point, you\u2019ll die. Even if your skull gets sunk in, it will be called fortunate. But it still will be painful.\u201d\u201cThe-there are people watching.\u201d\u201cThey do more amazing things there, you know.\u201dFollowing my brother\u2019s line of sight, I saw two people who certainly seemed to be lovers kissing while taking a selfie. When I was staring in astonishment, my brother muttered in a monotonous voice.\u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, no one will know, and we\u2019re not related by blood after all, so it still doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you keep being noisy, I\u2019ll do the same thing as them to you.\u201dMy body felt like freezing as he whispered that. But it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable. My brother sighed and tightened his arm around me. But at the same time, I felt confused.\u2026Was I thinking, that I\u2019m okay if my brother does that to me\u2026?When I thought about it, I could feel my brother\u2019s warmth on my back, our overlapping hands, and his arm around my stomach.My chest hurts, but it felt different from what I felt when my brother was on good terms with Himegasaki-san.Back then, I wanted to marry my brother. If I hadn\u2019t remembered about the manga, I think I would have been so excited today while saying, \u201cI\u2019m going on a date with Onii-chan!\u201d I would have been jealous of Himegasaki-san and would have complained, \u201cDon\u2019t bring that person here!\u201d to my brother.But now, even if I didn\u2019t get excited, I thought it was fun to be with my brother. Even when he said he would kiss me in a roundabout way, I didn\u2019t feel disgusted. For example, when I thought about Nagatani-san, who my brother was concerned about, or my classmate Iwai, I feel uncomfortable.Had my senses dulled because I was with my brother all the time? Or did the feeling I had for my brother before I remembered the manga still remain?No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn\u2019t find the answer.In the end, my thoughts became entangled, and until the ride finished rotating, without being able to enjoy the scenery and the fun song, I could only think about my brother who sat behind me. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7As people gradually left the amusement park, I sat on the bench with my brother while we held hands. The once blue and clear sky had been dyed in the glow of the setting sun, and the clouds were clad in a faint crimson hue. The attractions\u2019 lamps were lit up, pleasing the eyes of families that were heading home. Please read this at ChocoCats.After I got off the merry-go-round, I took a cup of coffee, did some window shopping around the park, went around the attractions again, and before I knew it, the sun was about to set.Truly, the cruel time was going really fast. But, the way home was through a big main street, and I was going to sleep with my mother tonight, so I didn\u2019t think my brother will kill me today.But when the night passed, and dawn comes\u2026The day of tragedy will arrive. Technically it was tomorrow night, but the night would come fast, just like today.\u201cMai, it\u2019s almost time to go home, so can I decide which one to ride last?\u201dIt was the first time my brother said he wanted to ride something. As soon as I wondered what exactly he wanted to ride, there was only one thing that came to mind somewhere in my heart. An attraction that had not ridden today, but was drawn big on the ticket, as it was looking down on us.\u201cOK\u201dWhen I nodded, my brother pointed at the exact place I thought.\u201cThen let\u2019s ride the Ferris wheel.\u201d Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7As we stood in line for the Ferris wheel while exchanging words that seemed to hide each other emotions, our turn came much earlier than we had imagined. Please read this at ChocoCats.After being urged by the staff to get on, the gondola moved slowly and lifted us up into the air.Outside the window, the tall buildings that stood far above all fell low to the ground as if they were aligned. Before long, my brother softly muttered.\u201cI just wanted to ride the Ferris wheel with Mai.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201dWhen I couldn\u2019t hide my surprise, my brother frowned in disappointment.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, I just think it\u2019s kind of unexpected.\u201d\u201cI guess I can\u2019t deny that.\u201dMy brother lowered his gaze. Before I knew it, the gondola was already halfway to the top. The sea could be seen in the distance, and illuminated ships were floating. The brightness from the shining buildings by the side, and because of the different perspectives, it felt isolated from the world.\u201c\u2026getting into the line to ride something that just climbs up and then down, I can\u2019t understand it.\u201dBefore we came to the amusement park, my brother was always being absent-minded.There were many times when I wondered if he was interested in me rather than the attractions, and even during parades and aquarium shows, he didn\u2019t pay attention to the things that were shown, and he looked coldly at the people who reacted to them. But I now realized that my brother was just observing.But today was different.He looked like someone who was collecting memories one by one and keeping them away.And that figure of his, looked like he was preparing to die or preparing to part.\u201cThat was to enjoy such scenery\u2026\u201dKurobe Makoto was the most powerful man in the manga.While preparing advantageous weapons for his classmates, he equipped himself with nothing but a knife. Although he tried to do himself a disadvantage, they all died as he expected, as if it had been destined.No matter how compelling the game he made, the results were still as predicted.The two survivors\u2026 the protagonist and the heroine had to win. After all, the title \u201cSayonara Heaven, Good Morning Hell\u201d was about the boring life of Kurobe Makoto.He was living a hellish boring life, and the boredom-free world he wanted didn\u2019t exist in the first place.In the end, he cut his own neck with a knife and died.\u201cOnii-chan.\u201dI sat next to my brother. Somewhere in my heart, I thought that if I was going to be killed, it must be now. But my brother didn\u2019t even try to kill me now.If so, will there be no tragedy tomorrow? I hoped so. But when I closed my eyes, the figure of my brother who observed the moment someone was being killed, didn\u2019t disappear.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mai?\u201d\u201cNothing. The scenery there looks better than here.\u201d\u201cThen, shall we switch seats?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine as it is.\u201dJust like this, when the Ferris wheel didn\u2019t go up anymore and the gondola didn\u2019t go down.That way my brother didn\u2019t have to die and killed his classmates.It would be better if there was no tomorrow. No need for the night to come. I wish it was gone.I turned my eyes to the gradually setting sun so I didn\u2019t have to notice my dampened heart. Please read this at ChocoCats.I couldn\u2019t see my brother\u2019s face. The day when I will regret not looking at my brother\u2019s face will never have to come. As I was holding onto the railing with my right hand, I took his hand with my other hand.My brother clasped my hand. I worry that it will be the last time we hold hands like this. No, that day will never come. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201cMai, why you looked like you are going to cry? Are you scared?\u201d\u201cNothing, I\u2019m not scared.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cFor real!\u201dI was not scared of the Ferris wheel or high places at all. But tomorrow, the future where my brother kills people and even kills himself was terribly scary. I tried my best to stop it. Even so, I couldn\u2019t help but be afraid that tomorrow will come.\u201cMai.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s come again next year. Even tomorrow is fine.\u201dI didn\u2019t want the amusement park today to be my last memory with my brother, and even if he didn\u2019t look like he would do it, I still wanted to see my brother the day after tomorrow, three days after tomorrow, even after a month, half a year, a year from now. But despite all that, I still couldn\u2019t help to be scared that when tomorrow comes, my brother might be gone. Contrary to my wishes, the gondola descended steadily. As I resented the setting sun, my vague feelings finally took shape.I love my brother. Even if he couldn\u2019t sympathize with people, or even if\u00a0 he was much crueller than people. His figure that lives as a bystander looked so lonely, and I wanted to stand next to him. I may never understand. I couldn\u2019t forgive the actions my brother was trying to do. But I couldn\u2019t do anything, I didn\u2019t want my brother to die. I wanted him to stay.\u201c\u2026\u2026Mai.\u201dHearing his gentle voice made tears well up. The scenery of the sunset was distorted as if it was drowning in water, and I moved my face closer to the window to hide from my brother\u2019s sight.What to do so that my brother can avoid being a murderer? What can I do to help him? Even if the story had been decided like that, I want to be with my brother tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and forever.\u201cLet\u2019s go again next year? I want to ride the Ferris wheel again.\u201dWhen I said that, my brother that was reflected in the window only laughed ambiguously.Then until we got off the Ferris wheel, as if such a future wouldn\u2019t exist, my brother didn\u2019t deny or affirm it until the end.

That\u2019s what I thought last night before I went to sleep, but contrary to my expectations, morning came and my brother and I were still alive. Please read this at ChocoCats.The morning was really ordinary. Nothing has changed except that my parents were leaving for a trip. And I had a certain feeling to the point it was eerie, that I was going to have to face my brother.And now I was studying in my brother\u2019s room.I felt that my brother\u2019s mind was getting distracted, as expected, maybe he was still attracted to the tragedy inside his heart.I don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t kill me yesterday. It might be the most amazing outcome so far. Perhaps my brother now was having a dilemma in his mind about whether he will cause a tragedy or not.Thinking about it made me want to say it out loud and tell him to stop. But if I fail now, my brother would kill me, kill his classmates, and take his own life by the end of July.If I didn\u2019t confine my brother here and now, he will die.Right now, I didn\u2019t know what my brother was thinking. Even if it would hurt my brother to stay in this boring world, I still want him to live.So, right now I was gonna confine my brother by putting a sleeping pill on his tea and using the handcuffs that I hid in my pocket. This was the only way. It\u2019s fine even if I became a hypocrite. It\u2019s fine even if my brother hates me. I will save my brother\u2019s life.\u201cSo, do you know how to solve this part?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s calculated from the radius of the circle, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not slacking off.\u201dWith that said, I pointed out the problem in my notebook. My brother took a sip of his tea while saying, \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d. I held my cup so it won\u2019t look suspicious. Please read this at ChocoCats.The teacup induced with the sleeping pill my brother was using was different in shape and colour from mine. So I won\u2019t get mixed it up. I watched his adam\u2019s apple go up and down as he drank the tea with the sleeping pill again.\u201cYou know, Mai\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought that you\u2019re glad I\u2019m your brother?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? All of sudden\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I just think that Mai is pitiful.\u201dMy brother put his teacup on the desk and looked straight at me. His eyes, that was so dark, that kind of deepness that might make you fall and never be able to return, were there, wavering. Even though I was close enough to touch him if I stretched out my hand, I couldn\u2019t grasp his true intentions at all. I could only imagine that he must be in pain. But I couldn\u2019t give him any sympathy. I felt a deadly gap.I wonder what my brother was thinking now.\u201cYou\u2019re the most pitiful person in the world, Mai.\u201dMy brother worded it again as if emphasizing. It was as if he was trying to advise me, and I realized that I was not allowed to reach into my brother\u2019s realm. Even so, I want to reach out to my brother. I didn\u2019t want him to die. I didn\u2019t want to be separated from my brother.\u201cHey, Onii-chan\u2026 You know, Onii-chan, I\u2019m\u2026\u201dTrying to compose words, I was suddenly attacked by the illusion of my throat vibrating.As if fooling around, my mouth was just opening and closing, as the breath that I tried to exhale didn\u2019t turn into a voice. When I tried to reach out to my brother, I found that my arm was numb and unable to move. What the? Just, what the hell\u2026\u201cOnii-cha\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMai. I can\u2019t change after all. You can resent me for the rest of your life.\u201dEven sitting down had become difficult, and I collapsed on the desk. My eyelids are heavy and I couldn\u2019t keep them open. The last thing I saw before my eyes fully closed was my brother looking down at me coldly. My voice that was calling out to him was simply sucked into the darkness. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201dI opened my eyes to the uncomfortable dim light. Please read this at ChocoCats.There was nothing on the floor. Only the minimum necessary stationery was on the desk. The second tier of the bookshelf had a dark grey board added as a door. After I opened my eyes and looked around, it seemed that I was now put on a chair in my brother\u2019s room, restrained.There was only one person who could do this.The handcuffs on my wrists were chained to the railing of the closet. When I glanced at my watch in panic, there was less than an hour before the date changed, and I felt blood drained from my face.In the end, it didn\u2019t work. I couldn\u2019t do anything. The owner of this room, my brother, was currently stirring up chaos on all of his high school classmates to die. He enjoyed slaughter from the bottom of his heart, lived in the moment, and faced death by himself.Even though I had known about it a year earlier, I still failed.I couldn\u2019t save anyone.It was not just about my brother\u2019s classmate\u2019s life. I also couldn\u2019t save my brother.Perhaps my brother judged that I would get in the way of his plans, so he chained me up like this. It didn\u2019t look like my brother was planning the test of courage, but he knew I was trying to stop him and was cleverly hiding it. I had no proof, but the current situation clearly showed that.I tried to see if the handcuffs would come off or maybe break the chain, but the thick steel chain was unperturbed. As if ridiculing my resistance, the sound of metal just echoed in vain.\u201cNo, no, no\u2026! Onii-chan!\u201dA tragedy was unfolding at the high school right now. If this chain was off, I could still go to my brother. I might be able to save my brother\u2019s life.\u201cGet off\u2026!\u201dI didn\u2019t care what would happen to my hands. If I could remove this chain and go to my brother, I might be able to change something.My brother might not have to die.But why didn\u2019t it go well? Since things always didn\u2019t go well all this time, at least I wished it went well this time. Otherwise, my brother would die. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cWhy\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cStop it, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201dI heard a voice that should never have been here and felt like my breath nearly stopped.No way, there was no way. It couldn\u2019t be. Because my brother was supposedly at school right now\u2026With that thought in mind, I looked up and saw my brother, who should have been soaked in blood and gleefully killing his classmates at school, standing by the open door.\u201cWhy is Onii-chan here?\u201d\u201cWhy, because it\u2019s my room?\u201dMy brother looked at me like he was looking at something strange, took out a first-aid kit from the shelf and approached me.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re resisting this much\u2026 I have to disinfect and treat it.\u201dSaying that my brother indifferently put gauze soaked in disinfectant on my wrist. Probably because I recklessly resisted, my wrist was bleeding and worn out here and there. The scars were rough, but probably because my brain couldn\u2019t process the current situation at all, my sense of pain was working slowly.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to school today?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything like that, are you misunderstanding something?\u201d\u201cWhy? Haven\u2019t you been looking forward to today?\u201dMy brother seemed displeased at my words. He looked at me like he was dealing with someone that couldn\u2019t be communicated with. Before long, my brother finished bandaging my wrists and stacked the handcuffs over my wrist. He picked up the chain that connects me to the room and showed it to me.\u201cMore importantly, Mai, can\u2019t you see the situation you\u2019re in? Don\u2019t you know what will happen to you from now on?\u201d\u201cAm I going to be, killed?\u201d\u201cHahahaha! Mai, you think I\u2019ll kill you?\u201dWhen I asked him cautiously, my brother started laughing. Maybe because he seemed to genuinely enjoy the current situation, he seemed to overlap with Makoto Kurobe from the manga. The only difference was that he wasn\u2019t dyed with fresh blood. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to kill you. Because I have something that I want Mai to do.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dMaybe it was before I even ask, or at the same time as I asked that, but my brother traced my cheek and smiled with a face I had never seen before.\u201cFrom now on, so that Mai can like me, fall in love with me, and live your entire life for me, you will do your best in this room.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dIt made no sense at all. What about the tragedy? What did he mean by \u2018fall in love with him\u2019\u2026?It was spoken in correct Japanese and I understood the meaning of each word. But it was too contradicted with the current situation, my brain couldn\u2019t process it. What did he mean by I need to do my best? Was he trying to say something like, \u201cI\u2019m going to jail, so you have to protect this house,\u201d in an abstract way?\u201cHuh? Why? You\u2019re going to kill me, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m going to get in your way of the plan, you know I\u2019m aware of your plan, so you\u2019re going to kill me, right?\u201dHearing my words, my brother looked dumbfounded for a moment and observed my face. I wonder why my brother was here. Did the tragedy not happen? Or did you cancel your suicide, killed everyone, and show up here? Just to kill me? Or were you going to kill me and go to school\u2026?Then, if I pushed him with my body together with the chair now, even if I might hurt my brother, wouldn\u2019t I be able to avoid a tragedy?\u201cWhat are you talking about, Mai, I\u2026\u201d\u201cThe school!\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cDid you go to school? Today!?\u201dMy brother didn\u2019t answer my question. He probably went to school and killed all his classmates already. But no, it shouldn\u2019t be. Makoto Kurobe in the manga was drenched with blood. My brother right now was not particularly wet with blood, nor did he smell of iron. Even if he took a bath, it was too early. The time just didn\u2019t match.\u201cDid you go to school!? Hey! Are you listening? Did you go to school today?!\u201cThere\u2019s no way that I went. Don\u2019t you understand that much?\u201dWhen I half-shoutingly asked him, my brother let out a sigh of exasperation. If that was so, I was sure he was going to kill me now and went for the tragedy. But if that was the case, we could still avoid it. I could still save my brother. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cMai, do you understand your situation? Do you know what I\u2019m going to do now while you\u2019re acting like that\u2026?\u201dAs if to comfort me, my brother stroked my head and looked down at me with a mocking voice. We all know that.\u201cYes! Onii-chan is still alive and I\u2019m a hindrance, so you\u2019re going to kill me, right? Because I will be in the way of you going to school!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dA blatantly cold look was directed at me. But it was okay. Even so, it was still okay. If I took the momentary gap and thrust the chair into him, I could deal great damage to my brother with the gravity force of the chair. He would get hurt, but if my brother lived and was unable to become a murderer, it was much better.\u201cI won\u2019t let you do that. I won\u2019t let you go to school, so even if my brother looks like a living human being and you\u2019re bored and want to die because it\u2019s hard to live, I won\u2019t let you die. I might hurt you a bit, but even so, I want to be by my brother\u2019s side forever.\u201dThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry! Without any moment to spare, I kicked the ground with all my might.My brother was in front of me now. This chair was chained and couldn\u2019t leave the room.But I could charge towards my brother in front of me with my whole body.I might slam my face to the floor, but that didn\u2019t matter. As long as my brother lived, I would give my face, arms, and legs.When I headed towards my brother full of determination, he grabbed me by the shoulder and pushed me down together with the chair with a loud crash. The recoil made my front legs slightly unsteady, and my brother\u2019s face got close to me.\u201cGyaa!!\u201d\u201cMai\u2026\u2026\u201dMy brother was just looking down at me while holding my shoulder. The eyes that seemed to be fixed towards me seemed to be wavering with unusual excitement.\u201cMai, Mai, you\u2026 you really want to be by my side\u2026?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201dMy brother\u2019s pitch-black eyes were getting closer and closer. He stared at me so intently and I didn\u2019t know how to respond. My brother\u2019s tone was unusually childish, adding more to the confusion. This wasn\u2019t the attitude of trying to get rid of a nuisance person. What is this? There was a limit to killing someone by letting them off guard first strategy, and my brother didn\u2019t have a kitchen knife or a gun. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cMai, you, you will accept me\u2026?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026? Uhm, I-I\u2019m rather ready to accept though\u2026\u201d\u201cYou really accept me?\u201dMy brother gazed at me. His innocent, clinging voice made my chest tighten a little.\u201cEh? Ye, yeah. But that sounds like a confession.\u201d\u201cBecause I like Mai.\u201dMy brother nonchalantly affirmed, but my head went blank.\u201cHuh? Why? Even though I\u2019m still alive!?\u201dEven though I did things that would make my brother avoid me, I didn\u2019t do things that would make him like me. Until now, I thought the thing I did that my brother might like the most was when I just kept quiet in order to let him off his guard. Even so, it was only for a little while. The next moment, I rang a mokugyo, went rampage with a tambourine, and in the worst of times, I would jump and fly.*reference to the early chapters*\u201cEven if you ask me why, I don\u2019t even know why I like you so much.\u201dMy brother stroked my head as if handling a fragile thing. I was worried that my skull would be crushed, but he stroked me so gently, it was terrifying.\u201cOnii-chan\u2026 Are you interested in me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs it towards the direction of wanting to turn me into a Hamburg steak before grilling me?\u201dT/N: lol Mai, did she think of Makoto as a cannibal?\u201cNo. A little more into sexual interest.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 that kind of interest, more than crushing insects and killing living things? I, I\u2019m a living human though? Besides, my life force is relatively strong, you know? Even so, are you okay with that?\u201dMy brother dropped his shoulders and said, \u201cYou thought of me like that\u2026\u201d. But he started laughing right away, the way he laughed sounded inhuman, and I was speechless.\u201cWhat\u2026 Even if I didn\u2019t gloss over it, you already knew my true nature. \u2026\u2026Haha. And on top of that, you said you still want to be by my side\u2026?\u201dMy brother\u2019s eyes, that was wide open as he laughed from the deep of his throat, were terrifyingly dark. Despite that, I feel like my brother was just being himself, and alongside a gloomy sense of security, it was attractive and I couldn\u2019t look away from him. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cYou see, I like Mai as a girl, and as a person, so you aren\u2019t a nuisance to me. But everyone other than Mai is a nuisance to me.\u201dMakoto Kurobe was a pure psychopath, and my brother was also out of the norm. So, how to explain it, I thought it was clear that it wasn\u2019t a feeling that an ordinary person usually had. That\u2019s why he said he likes me\u2026?\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of strange things, you know\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh, I was aware of it. I wish you would stop doing things that might harm yourself, but other than that, I don\u2019t really mind about it. I\u2019ve got used to it after all.\u201dGot used to it.I had a vague feeling about it, but it still shocked me. Even though I had been doing my best to provide my brother with unexpected things. If he got used to the unexpected itself, no matter how hard I tried, I will be swept away with, \u201cah, as usual, huh.\u201dIf that case, the tragedy\u2026! The thought suddenly came back to my mind.\u201cEh, then Onii-chan, you won\u2019t go to school today? Are you going to stay here?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe tragedy would never happen. His interest in the death game went somewhere else\u00a0(T/N: yeah, you). For example, capturing his little sister\u2026 Huh, wait, even though the death game didn\u2019t occur, why I was captured instead?T/N: lmao this girl is so slow to realize xD\u201cUm, err, why am I, need to be handcuffed?\u201d\u201cI think I still need you to try to adjust.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cSo that you won\u2019t escape anywhere.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, but what do you mean by escaping?\u201dWhen I asked that, my brother made a confused look. Seeing my brother\u2019s bewildered face, was not bad at all. After all, he usually showed a nonchalant look. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cI wanted to have Mai, so I had been preparing for it for a long time. If Mai accepted me, I don\u2019t think there was any need for me to arrange things like this.\u201dMy brother jangled the chain that connected to me. In other words, his interest in the death game has disappeared, and that interest has turned to\u2026\u2026 me. So now that my parents were not present, he took the chance and captured me.\u201cUm, I won\u2019t run away, can you remove these handcuffs?\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to remove it.\u201d\u201cEhh\u2026\u201dMy brother twinned the chain connected to me around his hand and played with it while laughing innocently.\u201cMai have to work hard here to like me. Until your parents come home or you start to like me, you won\u2019t be able to leave here.\u201d\u201cThat love is, um, like romantically\u2026 isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes. Do you hate it being together with me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t hate it.\u201d\u201cThen, even if you live with me forever, is it not hard?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cThen you will always be with me, right? You won\u2019t have to leave my side, right? You are also fine if we stay here together forever, right?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Wait, isn\u2019t this an inducement? Or rather, are you trying to brainwash me?\u201dAfter I nodded at my brother, I suddenly realized it. This is completely inductive. When I protested, my brother sighed and stroked my head. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cBut, it\u2019s because Mai actually likes me. To the point, I want to scream with all of my might.\u201dBecause it was the truth and I already said it, so I couldn\u2019t deny it. But even if I had to express my feelings, I couldn\u2019t deny the feeling that it would be better to do it at a more proper place.\u201cBut well, I\u2019m really glad. I don\u2019t have to do anything bad to you to make you like me.\u201dPat, pat, the persistent moment sent me back to my senses gradually.The opponent had the potential to kill dozens of people. And that potential wasn\u2019t headed toward murderous intent, but it was headed toward me. It partially saved my life. I wonder if this really was good\u2026\u201cThen shall we watch a movie? It seems you borrowed a lot, didn\u2019t you?\u201dMy brother started setting the movie I borrowed onto the player. He completely ignored the fact that I was still handcuffed and chained.\u201cWait, remove the handcuffs first.\u201d\u201cCalm down, look, the movie is about to start. You have to be quiet when you watch the movie. I\u2019ll take the chains off.\u201dMy brother stroked my head as if reprimanding me, and after removing the chain that connected the handcuffs and the room, he sat down on the chair as if holding me.\u201cNo, what about the handcuffs? The handcuffs!\u201dWhen I was protesting, my brother rebuked me by saying, \u201cThe movie is about to start, be quiet.\u201dI felt like I was being ignored purposely, but the peacefulness made me well up in tears a little.For the time being, there would be no tragedy. My brother didn\u2019t seem to be interested in holding the death game either. The peaceful life that I had imagined\u2026 but this ending was so different from what I imagined.Until now, I had been doing my best to offer my brother something unexpected, but I didn\u2019t think my brother would offer something unexpected like this at the very end.Huh, did that mean\u2026 I was able to properly provide my brother with something unexpected\u2026?I turned to face my brother, who was holding me in his arms while operating the remote control, he seemed a little happy. We\u2019ve been together for a long time, but it might be the first time I\u2019ve seen this expression. So defenceless. And natural\u2026Somehow, feeling overjoyed, I couldn\u2019t help but rub my head against my brother\u2019s shoulder. Then my brother smiled with the most genuine and childlike face I had ever seen. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I did it ;w; I did itttttt. It was a long chapter, I almost want to give up and split the chapter instead, but I still did it! I thought it would be no fun to read half by half, especially since it\u2019s the climax chapter. I hope you guys enjoy it though! Just a heads up, my January schedule will be very very full, I\u2019ve got so many art commissions suddenly, I will be out of the city next week, and also preparing for Lunar New Year. I hope I can make it alive and healthy. ;w; anyone here celebrating it too?Anyway, see you in the next chapter, and have a great day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, he kept the handcuffs on me, but we just watched movies together, read novels, slept together in my brother\u2019s room, and cooked and ate together. Please read this at ChocoCats.The handcuffs were removed for the bath and the toilet, leaving behind some terribly disturbing words, \u201cI will let you go for now. For now.\u201d\u201cMai! Don\u2019t just eat\u00a0manju, come and take a look. I bought you some souvenirs, Mai! Look, there are cute clothes and stuffed animals. Also, I bought you a charm for exam succession.\u201dMy parents unfolded their carrier bags in the living room and brought out souvenir bags. It must have been a lot of fun, the excitement was higher than usual. My brother just observed the two of them silently.\u201cFor Makoto, I bought you an ornament and a water clock.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dIn the morning, my brother removed the handcuffs from me while leaving another disturbing word, \u201cWell, because they will be home, for now\u201d.About half a day has passed since then, and for some reason, my brother didn\u2019t look well. He was in good spirits until our parents came back, and after the two of them came back, he seemed to be in a bad mood, however, it didn\u2019t seem like he was in poor health.\u201cDo you want to eat manju?\u201d\u201cNo thanks.\u201dWhen I tried to feed him manju, he kindly refused. When I tried to give him a clenched fist this time, my brother solemnly opened his lips.\u201cDad, Mom. There is something important that I need to say, can I have a moment?\u201dTension ran through the friendly atmosphere. My parents, who were diligently sorting souvenirs to give to neighbours and co-workers on the living room floor, turned their bodies toward my brother looking tensed as if they were being pulled by a string. Somehow, it felt like they were being manipulated\u2026My brother kneeled in front of them and fixed his gaze calmly on them.\u201cI, have decided to go out with Mai.\u201dMy parents were stunned by my brother\u2019s words. I got dumbfounded too. I was wondering if we would somehow start dating now, but I didn\u2019t think he would tell my parents right now. Even if we tell them after waiting for a while\u2026 of course, my parents will still be confused. However, my brother continued to talk with a crushed expression on his face.\u201cMy feeling is not half-hearted.\u201d\u201cMakoto\u2026 is that true\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. I understand for father and mother, Mai is the only one in this world, an irreplaceable family, so I know that such feelings would not be excused.\u201dWhen my father asked him, my brother carefully answered him in detail.My parents looked at my brother with a heartbroken expression and listened quietly.\u201cI always thought of giving up many times. Even though we\u2019re not related by blood, Mai still sees me as family. But I see her as a girl. Isn\u2019t that a cruel betrayal? Even to father and mother. Thinking that I will be the one who destroys this family\u2019s harmony, it hurts\u2026 But yesterday, Mai told me that she liked me.\u201dI had seen my brother chatting with our parents many times, but I\u2019d never seen him talk so seriously. It seemed that our parents were thinking the same thing because they looked somewhat restless. But wait, I didn\u2019t confess yesterday. When I peeked into my brother\u2019s face wondering what was about, my body froze.\u201cEven if I try to hang myself or cut my wrists, I still want to live. Thinking that I wanted to be more filial to my father and mother, my tears overflowed and I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dListening to my brother\u2019s trembling voice, our parents had tears in their eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, say no more\u201d,\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll support you two.\u201d Even if they called him out, my brother won\u2019t stop bowing his head.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026 father, mother.\u201dMy brother was laughing. His shaking shoulder and trembling voice were not because he held back his tears. But it was all to hide his smile. The corners of my brother\u2019s lips were up. And the only one who can see it was me who was diagonally behind my brother.At first glance, it looked like a touching scene between parents and their son, but it actually just like a crime confession. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Makoto.\u201d\u201cFather and mother are on your side!\u201dAfter our parents said so, my brother hugged them.My brother looked at me, without any sound said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it all later, okay?\u201d and smiled confidently as if he had won.Just right at that moment I really want to say, \u2018Dad, Mom, this person is deceiving you\u2019.Rather, I was wondering if my brother\u2019s personality from the very beginning were this distorted, even before his killing impulses and death game plan appeared.My brother currently didn\u2019t look like \u201ca son who fall in love with his sister and feels sorry for their parents\u201d, but more like he looked down at our parents. As if looking at garbage. Thinking back, the day before yesterday, he laughed scornfully and said something like \u201cthose two parents, are a little worrying, for them to be that naive.\u201d while looking at the calendar.\u201cMai, father and mother said they will forgive us\u2026 They said we can stay together. So, Mai, let\u2019s get married when you graduate from college. I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mai-chan\u2026 Don\u2019t worry\u2026 Both your father and mother will support you\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re with you! It\u2019s okay!\u201dMy brother\u2019s words made my parents look at me and called me. As I approached them confusedly, my parents hugged me and my brother tightly and blessed us for the future. Then my brother stared at me as if looking at a void, and said \u201cisn\u2019t that good, Mai.\u201d Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7\u201cWhy did you tell mom and dad?\u201d\u201cBecause, once Mai enters high school, it will probably seem strange for us to always walk together. Besides, it\u2019s easier to get married if I tell them beforehand now.\u201dAfter finishing my brother\u2019s emotionally moving drama, I headed to his room. Then, as if expecting it, my brother was waiting for me with a nonchalant face. Please read this at ChocoCats.Even when my brother held my hand, I was still concerned about his ability to control the room so that he won\u2019t need to feel uncomfortable with the surroundings, but I didn\u2019t expect him to perform this flawlessly.\u201cEven so, it was so funny. For them to say they will support us\u2026\u201dAs he said so nonchalantly with a calm face, my brother stuffed my mouth with manju. Delicious. No, wait, I mean no matter how I see it, he was really unexpected person.Besides, even though until now my brother just had a slightly mocking attitude, now he was completely laughing at me.\u201cBy the way, I never heard about this marriage.\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t like it?\u201dMy brother suddenly looked lonely and muttered quietly. I was sitting in front of my brother who was standing, so I automatically looked up. Somehow this feeling was very\u2026\u201cDoes the idea of marrying me, is really that unpleasant?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 If only we do things in the proper order\u2026\u201d\u201cBy proper order, you mean, like holding hands first then hugging, and so on?\u201dSuddenly, my brother\u2019s eyes changed colour and he grabbed me who had stood up by my hand. This was a pretty bad situation. When I backed away to escape, I was pulled by my arm and fell into his embrace. As if being pushed from the back, our body was getting close tightly without any gaps.\u201cUwaa\u2026\u201d\u201cLast time, when Mai peeked when I was changing clothes, your heart throbbed like this, didn\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t peek, it was just Onii-chan who was an exhibitionist. Anyway, let me go, my heart will stop if you keep doing this!\u201dIt was an incident that I will never forget. When I opened the door, I found my brother with all the buttons on his shirt unbuttoned, then he grabbed my arm and cornered me against the wall. My heart was about to burst and I was on the verge of dying. After that, I thought about getting revenge. I was thinking if my brother going to bathe, I will put on a waterproof costume\u2026 a beach ball costume and jump in the bath with him, but I didn\u2019t have enough money to put it off. I will definitely do it next time. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cYou won\u2019t die from this much. From now on, I\u2019m going to do more amazing things in order for you.\u201dMy brother traced my nape and brought his face closer.\u201cThe first time when you were asleep, it was on your forehead, and the other day on the\u00a0 cheek, but this time will be the first time on the lips, so remember it properly.\u201d\u201cEh, ah, ehh? Uh\u2026\u201dWhen I was trying to complain, our lips overlapped. As I stood still, unable to move a single step, my brother\u2019s face separated from mine.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mai? Your face is bright red.\u201d\u201cOf course it is!? Or rather, what did you do on my forehead? I don\u2019t know about that! What did you mean when I was sleeping!?\u201d\u201cHere, like this, I kissed you.\u201dBeing held from the back of my head, I was kissed again on the forehead. The sound of his lips parting my forehead made my heart feel like being crushed, and my brother giggled. What is this\u2026 I was completely being played at. Even though it was me who want to surprise my brother.\u201cI\u2019ll slowly make it longer, so remember to breathe.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Onii-chan, wait a minute.\u201dI lightly touched my brother\u2019s cheek, who laughed happily and brought my face closer to him. And with intentions of rebellion and my usual sense of surprise, I kissed him. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, I have no word to apologise any more, it\u2019s really late I know. Things real life really really make me wish I could just drop everything and throw myself to the sea. But I\u2019m still here, so I will keep doing my best to finish whatever I had started. I hope you all doing well, I sincerely thank you for every comments and ko-fi you guys send me, it\u2019s all what makes me keep moving on. I always read the comments one by one, even though I can\u2019t reply them all, I really appreciate the thought and it makes me happy to think you guys enjoyed this series.

It seemed that this way of thinking also existed within me. Please read this at ChocoCats.Nagatani\u2019s desire for Mai was something I hadn\u2019t anticipated, and it was enough to make me imagine what would happen if Mai developed feelings for someone else.Driven by a never-ending sense of impatience, every time I closed my eyes, I saw the moment when Mai ran towards someone else. However, it was Mai\u2019s classmate who had been close to her all along that made me consider killing Mai, ever since I saw him confessing his feelings to her.On that day, there was a terrible downpour of rain, causing delays on the train ride home and making Mai wait longer than expected. I could call her phone, but using smartphones were forbidden in middle school. Fortunately, even after I had graduated, I was still allowed to enter the school, so I entered the building with borrowed slippers as usual, without having to display a school entrance permit.Mai was usually in the home economics room. She was good friends with the girl from the temple, who were in the sewing club. When I reached for the doorknob as usual, I heard a familiar voice saying, \u201cIt\u2019s you, it\u2019s you whom I like.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThen I heard Mai\u2019s dumbfounded voice. Looking through the window, I saw her sitting in the corner seat of the classroom with her back to me. Next to her was a male student wearing a baseball uniform, and I could see his serious profile as he gazed at Mai. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cI\u2019ve liked you since elementary school. Will you go out with me?\u201d\u201cI, Iwai\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you don\u2019t see me that way. But I want you to acknowledge my feelings and see me as a man from now on.\u201dStraightforward words. Strong-willed eyes. Something that I couldn\u2019t give to Mai. His voice alone conveyed more sincerity than I could bear. While I held my breath and waited, I desperately wanted to hear Mai\u2019s answer. Before long, she shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cI can\u2019t go out with you, Iwai.\u201dI was surprised at how relieved I felt when she said those words. I felt sweat pouring down my forehead and hurriedly wiped it away.\u201cIs there no chance for me?\u201dT/N: my poor baby Iwai ;w;\u201cIwai, I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dMai lowered her head. It was good she rejected him. But at the same time, I felt anxious about what I would do if I confessed to her and she rejected me. Until now, I couldn\u2019t imagine being rejected by Mai, but now that I had actually witnessed it, I could vividly picture it.If Mai chose another man and parted ways with me\u2026I knew I shouldn\u2019t imagine it instinctively. If I imagined it, I couldn\u2019t go back. After all, I didn\u2019t even have a sane way of thinking.\u201cHowever, I still want us to get along as friends in the future.\u201dHowever, I still want us to get along as siblings in the future.Strangely, I could imagine it so vividly that it felt like I was the one being told that.T/N: Dang, that\u2019s kinda hurt\u2026And the next thing that came to mind was killing Mai. That night, I had a dream, so vivid even I could see the detail of her blood flowing from her cut throat. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, this chapter is pretty short so I can immediately translate it and update.A little bit about the story, I feel bad for Iwai. I know he\u2019s just a 2nd ML and rarely showed up in the story but I still pity him. The fact Mai never even mention anything about Iwai\u2019s confession in her POV, was really sad\u2026 Author-sama is too cruel to my baby Iwai. TwTAlso, I\u2019m very very very happy with all of your comments and supports towards me, I can\u2019t explain how grateful I was when I read them all one by one. I can\u2019t say thank you enough for you all, so I decided to finish the chapter as soon as I could. It\u2019s not the fastest I know but I will do my best again like usual, thank you everyone and I really appreciate your support for this series.Anyway, see you in the next chapter, and have a great day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So I can store some items for my plan when I needed\u2026 like gifts for her. Please read this at ChocoCats.But what was now locked away in the bookshelf were chains, handcuffs, and sleeping drugs.It was a tool to put Mai to sleep and chained her to this room. I had planned to execute this during summer vacation, but my parents suddenly went on a two-night, three-day trip, and the plan was accelerated.Mai and I would be alone. It was a perfect opportunity. Nothing can intervene against us.In those three days, I would kidnap her by force, break her, and make her love me.I was anxious, but it has already been proven that creating pseudo-love was possible by pushing people to their limits. It may be categorized as a symptom, not an effect, but I couldn\u2019t question the means.I wondered if the Mai I would recreate is the one I love, but it was better than losing her completely. That time\u2026 just like when she was hit by a truck, rather than letting her disappear far away, it was better to break her and hold onto her broken remains to fill this emptiness. Please read this at ChocoCats.T/N: Ugh, I hate to admit but I find this side of Makoto a bit hopelessly romantic and it melts me.Even though I decided on this, my heart never settled until the very end. Even though I should have fit the pieces of the puzzle firmly, an uncomfortable feeling comes up, floating awkwardly.To fill the uncertain emotions inside of me, I stayed by Mai\u2019s side. But every time I saw Mai, my heart would become more and more disturbed.Every time I saw her, I wanted to hug her. I wanted her to accept my love. I became so thirsty that I couldn\u2019t help but think of wanting to cling to Mai.While yearning for a sweet illusion, I had been dreaming of killing Mai, up until two days before my parents left on summer vacation.In the dream, Mai was chained and rejecting me, so I tightened my grip around her neck. Her eyes, which had been shining, began to cloud over, and her limbs, which had been moving so well, drooped down lifelessly. I stabbed Mai, who was frightened by me, on her stomach, blood flowed out, staining the floor a darker red than Mai\u2019s lips.Then I woke up in the morning with trembling arms. All that remained in my heart was regret and prayer that I didn\u2019t want to kill her.T/N: ;w; dang Makoto\u2026There was a time when I was deeply attracted to life and death. I used to think it was okay for Mai to die too. But not anymore. Even so, if I couldn\u2019t have her heart, I feel like I could even kill her body. But I didn\u2019t want to kill her. I didn\u2019t want to, but if things continue like this, I will definitely end up killing her, because the feeling of wanting to kill Mai still lingers. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hello, this chapter is pretty short so I can immediately translate it and update.This chapter\u2026 is a bit dark, idk but when I was translating this, my heart beats loudly, like, whoa Makoto is sure deep, he\u2019s a complex character, his description of killing Mai is really clear and made me shiver. I\u2019m amazed by how complex he is.Anyway, see you in the next chapter, and have a great day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I headed to the amusement park with Mai. Because I wanted to see the lively Mai properly for the last time. I had various choices such as an aquarium inside the zoo, but I chose the park because the ticket showed a picture that emphasized a space for a couple\u2026 or so I thought. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I ride on the bus with Onii-chan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cSeems so.\u201dWe got on the bus that went to the amusement park and sat at the back. Mai sat by the window, and I sat beside her. This way, Mai won\u2019t be able to get off the bus unless I move.\u201cBack then when we go to cram school and middle school, we walk, and now you take the train to high school, right? Even if you have somewhere to go, you take the train. So taking the bus once in a while is refreshing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYea.\u201dI vaguely nodded at Mai\u2019s words. I loosened the grip of our hands, which I had been holding since we left, and began to intertwine our fingers. Mai immediately noticed that I had changed the way we were holding hands.\u201cOnii-chan?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it was nothing\u2026\u201dAs I stared at her, Mai hesitantly intertwined her fingers with mine. I noticed that my heart rate changed just by that, and I quietly chuckled.\u201cW-why are you laughing?\u201d\u201cMaybe because the weather is nice?\u201d\u201cNo, definitely not that, right?\u201dMai approached me suspiciously. I could even kiss her if I held her face.But I just lightly brushed the hair supporting the back of her head. Mai laughed as if tickled, then playfully bumped her head against mine.Cumulonimbus clouds floated in the sky, and it was comfortable without strong sunlight. It felt like the day when I went home with Mai last year. I wanted to go back to that time. I wanted to redo it so that she would fall in love with me.Or maybe it would be better if this moment could last forever.If the bus could just crash somewhere and we could die together without destroying Mai\u2019s heart, I would be able to stay with her until the end. But I don\u2019t know if that would be a good thing. And the bus stopped in front of the amusement park without any accidents. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7Upon arriving at the amusement park, Mai appeared somewhat bewildered. Please read this at ChocoCats.Personally, I\u2019ve never had the conscious desire to enjoy an amusement park, and although I\u2019ve been to one several times with Mai and her parents, I only saw it as a place where Mai would get excited, as well as her parents and the people around us, it felt like watching creatures from another world.So I didn\u2019t understand the feeling of enjoying an amusement park. But after a while, Mai began to enjoy the rides and started pulling my arm happily.I didn\u2019t find being shaken left and right, being swung back and forth, or being dropped from high places enjoyable or exciting. But watching Mai feel scared, excited, and having fun with those rides made me feel like I was having fun too.I might teach Mai academics, but through her, I learnt about emotions.T/N: ;w; dang Makoto is so sweet I\u2019m melting.. I love him smWhen we study, the results were the same no matter who teaches us. But I thought that I would never learn from anyone other than Mai. If I had fallen in love with her earlier, would I have become an ordinary person?As I dragged her into the darkness, Mai was always smiling, while occasionally looking at me with a worried expression. Although I never thought of wishing for something or wanted to gift anything before, I now wanted to fulfil her wishes.If she had a wish, I wanted her to tell me. I would make it come true. But if she wishes for me to set her free, I would never fulfil that wish. So it would be insincere to obey. However, when I heard Mai\u2019s laughing voice, I want to take everything she wishes and grant it.\u201cMai, it\u2019s almost time to go home, so can I decide which one to ride last?\u201dAs the sun had set and the families with children started to leave the park, I called Mai. She looked straight at me with a determined look and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dI wanted to treat her gently. I wanted to spoil her. That was what I think, but at the same time, I wanted to have her all to myself. I wanted to take her everything and indulge in it. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cThen let\u2019s ride the Ferris wheel.\u201dSaying that I took Mai\u2019s arm.\u25c7Fortunately, there was no queue, and while having a casual conversation with Mai, we soon found ourselves at the front of the line. We probed each other\u2019s thoughts with idle conversation, but ultimately, without taking that one last step, we boarded the gondola and sat facing each other. Mai was gazing outside without doing anything, feeling lonely, I spoke up. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cI just wanted to ride the Ferris wheel with Mai.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201dI had already decided from the beginning that we would ride the Ferris wheel last. In an environment where humans were crawling into crowds together, there was no other place where I could be in the same space as Mai. Mai, who had shifted her gaze from the window where the gondola quietly rose, looked surprised as she turned to me.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, I just think it\u2019s kind of unexpected.\u201d\u201cI guess I can\u2019t deny that.\u201dThe gondola shook slightly. When I looked out the window, we were quite far from the ground, and I even had the illusion that we were the only two people in the world. The illuminating light, vaguely mixed with the evening glow, which I had never thought much about before, began to seem irreplaceable.\u201c\u2026getting into the line to ride something that just climbs up and then down, I can\u2019t understand it.\u201dUntil now, I haven\u2019t had any interest in things that are called entertainment. What attracts me was just the moment when living creatures take their last breath. A world where everything continued to be as expected, no matter what you see or hear, was nothing but pain. In that world, the only faint light was just the moment when a living creature loses its life.Every time I saw overflowing liquid, I relaxed, and the moment when the faint breath of life stopped and fell into emptiness became my eternity.Even so, everything changed through Mai. It had been changed. One could say it was for the best for other people. But Mai was different. Only Mai, the most important existence in the world, must be sacrificed. It would be Mai alone in an unhappy world. Even though she was the one I want to cherish the most.\u201cThat was to enjoy such scenery\u2026\u201dThe passage of time feels intensely hateful. I wish tomorrow would never come. I want this moment to last forever, for time to stand still, for me to melt and become the same as Mai. As I wished for something impossible, Mai sat next to me.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mai?\u201d\u201cNothing. The scenery here looks better than there.\u201d\u201cThen, shall we switch seats?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine as it is.\u201dMai gripped the handrail tightly as if she was enduring something alone, and I desperately fought the urge to reveal everything and hold her tight.Unable to suppress my overwhelming feelings, I held Mai\u2019s hand. I didn\u2019t want to let go. I wished this moment could last forever. I wished time could stand still. I didn\u2019t want to be apart from her. I\u00a0 wanted to be by her side forever. Please read this at ChocoCats.As I poured my heart out into prayer while holding her hand, Mai squeezed my hand back.I wondered if she was returning my feelings. I was afraid I might misunderstand and thought she was willing to accept them.This was surely the last time we would hold hands like this. Tomorrow, I would have to mourn either Mai\u2019s heart or her life.And it will be because of none other than my own hand.\u201cMai, why do you look like you are going to cry? Are you scared?\u201d\u201cNothing, I\u2019m not scared.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cFor real!\u201dAs I asked Mai if her shaking breath was because of tears, her voice trembled faintly. Despite it being such a simple thing, my overwhelming love for her overflowed.I didn\u2019t want to make her cry. I love her. If it was Mai, every expression and emotion of hers were all precious.In this world, Mai was the only one who makes me feel like there was something to look forward to in the future. I love her. Even though I love her dearly. Even though I\u2019m so in love with her that it was unbearable, tomorrow I would have to erase Mai\u2019s existence. I must erase her.Even now, I wanted to kill her. I wanted to make this moment with Mai last forever. But I knew she could never accept someone like me. Even though she couldn\u2019t accept or love me, I couldn\u2019t change.There was no way Mai could love someone like me, who deviated from the norm. I knew that better than anyone else.And yet, I couldn\u2019t stop loving her. Even though it would make us both unhappy, I love her, I love her so much that it hurts. I love her, no matter what I couldn\u2019t help but to love her. Despite that,\u00a0I have to kill her. Even though I love her dearly, I couldn\u2019t help it. Despite my love for her, still, only when I kill her, I could have her for myself.T/N: Dang, this part\u2026 was hard to convey. Makoto is totally contradicting himself, so that\u2019s why he kept repeating the same sentences. He wants to love, yet wants to kill, but love, but ALSO kill, and never-ending thoughts like that happened in his head. Dang, it\u2019s like my love-hate with Author-sama!!! TwT\u201c\u2026\u2026Mai.\u201dShould I tell her that I love her? After all, I would lose her tomorrow anyway.Even if I thought of that my throat only felt burned and no words came out. Mai leaned closer to the window. I wanted to hold her just like that. I wanted to touch her. I wanted to tell her I love her. But my hand only hold onto her hand, motionless. Memories of the time I spent with Mai come to my mind one after another and then disappeared. Mai\u2019s smile, her tears, her slightly angry face, her eyes that were expecting something from me, her laughter, our memories together overflowed and just like that, the feeling of loving her didn\u2019t stop. It won\u2019t stop.\u201cLet\u2019s come again next year! Together!\u201dMai said as if mustering her strength. Such a future won\u2019t come. I would destroy it. There would be no next year. And yet, it was painful. Was I smiling properly now? I couldn\u2019t say \u201cyes\u201d even though it would be the right answer. The words won\u2019t come out.Even though I had lied hundreds and thousands of times before, those three letters won\u2019t come out of my lips. Frustrated, I hold onto Mai\u2019s hand tightly, and she did the same, making my chest feel tighter. Please read this at ChocoCats.And so, until the end, I couldn\u2019t affirm Mai\u2019s words.\u25c7T/N: Hello, Kei the translator of Desuge Imouto just fell into comma from Onii-chan\u2019s yandereness\u2019s overdose\u00a0sorry im joking dont kill me for realThis chapter, what makes me fell in love with Makoto.. I decided to translate this novel because of this chapter, yeah, it\u2019s weird isn\u2019t it. I love how both Mai and Makoto wished for the same thing here (refer to chap 41, Mai\u2019s POV of the same day), for the moment to last forever, for tomorrow never come, but their thought process also different. Makoto\u2019s thoughts.. his craziness, his psycho way of thinking, his changing process from tedious and boring world into world full emotions because of Mai, was really conveyed well by Author-sama, and thus I fell in love.Anyway, see you in the next chapter, and have a great day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both parents left home early. Mai started studying with me while being restless because she put medicine in my tea. She had never used anything like that to surprise me before. I thought it was strange. I could have drunk anything that Mai brewed, but today I couldn\u2019t. Please read this at ChocoCats.I took a sip of the\u00a0switched tea. Mai was observing me closely as I drank the tea.\u201cYou know, Mai\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought that you\u2019re glad I\u2019m your brother?\u201dI had never thought I was glad that Mai was my younger sister. I had never thought it was good to have Mai by my side.I yearned, loved, and desired her. But I felt sorry for Mai, who had to bear my feelings. Even though I felt happy when she was by my side, I couldn\u2019t say it was \u201cgood\u201d.I thought it was pitiful. I sympathized with her.\u00a0 I thought that Mai was terribly pitiful, loved and sacrificed by a monster like me and lose everything today.But I couldn\u2019t stop.I wanted Mai. I wanted every part of her. It would never end as long as I live. I have fallen in love with her. I love her. That was why I had no choice but to kill her. I couldn\u2019t just quietly love her and wish for her happiness. It was not something I\u2019m capable of. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? All of sudden\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I just think that Mai is pitiful.\u201dMai looked bewildered at my words. She would probably only understand them when I take action against her. Only then, would she finally understand my true intentions.Knowing that I love Mai, I would end her life. The scene that became more vivid the more I imagine it made my body go cold, rather than sending shivers down my spine.\u201cYou\u2019re the most pitiful person in the world, Mai.\u201dMai was pitiful. She was going to become the most pitiful girl in the world from now on. It was all because of me. She was a pitiful Mai who would be taken advantage of and stripped of everything, even though she had done nothing wrong, just because she was loved by a monster. Oh, poor Mai. Pitiful and unfortunate Mai.\u201cHey, Onii-chan\u2026 You know, I\u2019m\u2026\u201dMai looked at me as if trying to convey something with a determined expression. The medicine must have started to take effect, as her body began to feel numb. She might lose consciousness anytime soon now. Goodbye, Mai. See you again. I would fix you so that you would love me. If that\u2019s not possible let\u2019s die, let\u2019s die together. Otherwise\u2014\u201cOnii-cha\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMai. I can\u2019t change after all. You can resent me for the rest of your life.\u201dMai\u2019s eyes reflected me until the last moment as if she was reaching out to me, as if she wanted me. Before her consciousness completely faded, I placed my lips on Mai\u2019s forehead.After a while, I put the handcuffs I had prepared on Mai\u2019s wrists. I chained her up and connected her to my room. With this, Mai wouldn\u2019t be able to escape unless she severed her own wrists or I handed over the key. Please read this at ChocoCats.I let out a sigh of relief and then turned my attention to Mai, who was sleeping soundly.I gently stroked her cheek as she slept soundly. Her skin was so soft that it seemed like it could tear easily. I recalled looking at her as she lay in the hospital bed. I never thought things would turn out like this.I never thought I would develop an obsession with a person.I wondered what would happen if I did push her into the pond.Mai was an insignificant existence, a mere component to reinforce my sociability. I didn\u2019t care if she die tomorrow. And yet\u2026\u201cPoor thing.\u201dEven if I murmured, Mai won\u2019t wake up. If I had been normal, would the outcome have been different? Would I have been able to make Mai happy, to love and be loved by her?\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI used to think that I could never truly apologize to anyone from the bottom of my heart. But now, I feel truly sorry for what I did to Mai. My heart ached. And from now on, it would be even more hurtful for Mai. But even so, I couldn\u2019t stop myself, I knew I was just a hopeless and terrible person.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even mind if you kill me, Mai.\u201dRather, I hoped she kills me now. Before I ended up killing her. I wanted her to remember me for the rest of her life, etched into her body and soul. Instead of parting words, I hugged Mai for the last time. Her body was warm, and maybe it rubbed off on me, as my eyes grew hot with tears.T/N: dang onions!!!\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mai. For loving you.\u201dThe words I murmured couldn\u2019t be heard by the beloved one. There won\u2019t be any turnback now. I couldn\u2019t hope for a happy future anymore.

The trees surrounding the pond where I used to frequently jump into were all dyed pink, and cherry blossom petals fluttered down. While cicadas were singing during the summer, now even on weekdays during the day, the place was bustling with people enjoying flower viewing parties and social gatherings, seemingly made up of company employees. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cLook, Ojii-chan, the cherry blossoms are already at their peak over here. They\u2019ll probably bloom soon over there too, won\u2019t they?\u201dI pointed my smartphone camera, connected to Grandpa, towards the cherry blossom trees. Grandpa apparently had completed rehabilitation without difficulty and was now forming a band with the locals. On the other side of the screen, I could see acoustic guitars and microphones.\u201cThey have bloomed already, huh? They look even more beautiful this year. Is it because Mai passed the high school entrance exam?\u201dAs for me, I had passed the exam without incident and had been accepted into the stage of \u201cSayo Jigoku\u201d, the same high school as my brother.There, I saw students who I had never seen in my brother\u2019s study group, which had appeared in \u201cSayo Jigoku.\u201dBut there\u2019s something different about the people from \u201cSayo Jigoku\u201d and sometimes I feel like my brother wouldn\u2019t have caused the tragedy that night even if I hadn\u2019t done anything.The protagonist, Hiroshi-kun, who was supposedly an ordinary guy, had also become one of the top-performing students after my brother. And despite supposedly having feelings only for Himegasaki-san, he dated his childhood friend.I met him once in the library, but when Hiroshi-kun saw me, he muttered \u201cSo that\u2019s the reason.\u201d and left without saying anything else. Please read this at ChocoCats.T/N: IS THIS A HINT THAT HIROSHI-KUN MIGHT BE A REINCARNATOR TOO?!\u201cOjii-chan, you weren\u2019t that happy when it was my turn\u2026?\u201dMy brother muttered beside me. But Grandpa, who apparently heard him, laughed cheerfully.\u201cWell, I thought Makoto would definitely pass the exam.\u201d\u201cThat means you were worried I was stupid enough to fail, right!?\u201d\u201cHahaha. Well, because Jii-chan believed that Mai is a person full of miracles!\u201d\u201cAre you just plainly trying to gloss over it?\u201d\u201cCome on, you guys have school, right?

I glanced at my brother.\u201cHe hung up\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, isn\u2019t it? I also wanted to spend some time alone with Mai soon.\u201dMy brother said so while squeezing my hand tightly.I successfully passed high school entrance exams, and my brother didn\u2019t end up holding a death game. It was peaceful as if it were drawn in a picture, but my brother\u2019s actions towards me were becoming intense day by day. Please read this at ChocoCats.The morning started with my brother\u2019s wake-up call, and we were always together when we were at home. We went to school together, had lunch together, and even after school, we were always together. I was worried about whether I could make friends if things were like this, but some students found my brother\u2019s behaviour amusing, so I haven\u2019t felt left out in class.He separated when our parents were around, but when they were not, we were always so close. Even when we were sitting next to each other, there used to be a distance of a fist\u2019s length between us, but now it was either my brother was completely into me or I was completely into him.\u201cOnii-chan, aren\u2019t you been too close recently?\u201d\u201cDo you not like it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it, but I feel like I have fewer chances to interact with people other than you.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it too late for that now?\u201dMy brother laughed as if he was making fun of me. He was completely deliberate about it. I felt like I wanted to get back at him, so I thought about what surprise I could come up with today.Even though the death game had been cancelled, I was still giving my brother \u201cunexpected offerings\u201d in a slightly different form.Because I had been violently creating surprises all this time, if I suddenly stopped, it might cause him mental stress. Even though my brother was crazy, he could still feel stressed. Please read this at ChocoCats.So I had to be considerate of my brother. I gradually reduced the frequency of the \u201cunexpected offerings\u201d from every day to every other day to every three days.\u201cOh, make sure you open today\u2019s bento from the small side.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an order? What happens if I open it from the reverse?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t open.\u201dI still continued making bentos. I had never once surprised my brother with them and it was frustrating.\u201cBy the way, the weather is really nice today. There are even cumulonimbus clouds.\u201dI looked up at the sky while stretching my hand. Large cumulonimbus clouds floated in the sky, just like the ones I saw last summer, coupled with being near the small pond made me feel nostalgic.Last summer, I dived into the pond. I thought, \u2018maybe I\u2019ll surprise him if I do it now,\u2019 but I stopped because I was going to school.\u201cStop it. Don\u2019t do anything dangerous.\u201dSurprised by the reply that correctly guessed my thought inside, I turned around and found my brother chuckling.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying that you keep surprising me when I\u2019m the one who wants to surprise you,\u201d\u201cWhy? I\u2019m surprised every day,\u201d he replied.\u201cYou are lying.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dHe said that as he covered my lips with a kiss. \u201cEven now it\u2019s surprising,\u201d he said, pinching my cheek.\u201cNo, you are not surprised.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Come on, let\u2019s go, Mai.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dMy brother took my hand. I was frustrated but happy, so I held his hand tightly. My brother laughed like a child as we walked together down the road with rows of cherry blossom trees. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7Author\u2019s note:Thank you for reading this. How was it?

Please read this at ChocoCats.Teachers became busy and harder to catch as the school enters a long break. Meanwhile, students got excited and started piling up bothersome things, saying things like, \u201cBecause it\u2019s right before summer vacation\u201d or \u201cSince we\u2019re finally going on summer vacation.\u201d\u201cKurobe-kun, can I have a moment?\u201dOn a sunny afternoon, just a day before the closing ceremony, the student council\u2019s final task before summer vacation was assigned: cleaning the pool. It was a simple task of scrubbing the inside and outside of the pool which boasts a depth of about 1.4 meters and its perimeter with a deck brush and water to a certain extent. All the student council members and a few volunteer students were chosen for this task, and the girl who stopped me was from a different grade.She could be a junior, first year or second; I couldn\u2019t tell.\u201cI, um, I think you are so cool when you always take care of everyone and are always at the top academically\u2026 I like you. If it\u2019s okay, would you go out with me\u2026?\u201dThe sun-baked floor was scorching, and just standing there was uncomfortable enough, making me feel even worse.\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of you. Thank you. But I\u2019m sorry, I have to focus on my exams, and right now, the student council work is more important.\u201d Please read this at ChocoCats.Politely declining with the usual words, the girl teared up and ran off. What a bothersome ritual. If handled carelessly, it would spread a bad reputation and become even more of a hassle. As I tightened my grip on the deck brush, a hand gently rested on my shoulder.\u201cOnii-chan! Someone just confessed to you, right? You turned them down, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201dShe was my step-sister, brought along by the woman my father married. Mai hopped around like a frog, sticking to me noisily.Taking care of her, who didn\u2019t seem particularly intelligent since childhood, had boosted my reputation among those around me.So, while letting it be to the extent of not dying, I occasionally took care of that creature, and as a result, it seems to have grown fond of me. It frolicked around without showing any concern for the summer heat. I sincerely felt relieved that we weren\u2019t connected by blood. It\u2019s somewhat difficult to bear the thought of sharing the same blood as that thing.\u201cMai, have you had enough water? It\u2019s hot, so you should be careful.\u201d\u201cOK!\u201dCasually prompting her to move away, she dashed along the poolside and picked up the PET/plastic bottle she had placed in the shade.Both male and female students were wearing gym clothes, designed to withstand getting wet. My step-sister was the same. As I caught a glimpse of the legs peeking out from the shorts, aligned uniformly along the line, a sudden thought crossed my mind. Please read this at ChocoCats.Even if insects lost their legs, they could still survive for a while. I wonder if humans were the same. Everyone was making plans for the summer vacation, and maybe it was a good idea for me to follow suit.The moment something lost its life, my heart became clear and I felt a surge of excitement. I wondered if my heart was only moved by the act of killing something. It made me curious and made me want to investigate.However, I felt like insects alone wouldn\u2019t be enough for an experiment. After all, insects didn\u2019t make a fuss when they were killed, but humans wouldn\u2019t be the same. But as an experience, I\u2019d like to push someone off, whether it was in the sea, a river, a pond, or even this pool.Behind me, the male members of the volleyball club, who joined this cleaning activity under the advisor\u2019s orders, were pushing and shoving each other, trying to push someone into the pool. Perhaps it was just a complete farce since the pool has already been drained. However, I became curious about how someone\u2019s head would shatter if they fell in.That\u2019s right, there was a park nearby. The pond there was used as a place for elementary school children to play in the water. If I make a slight mistake in pushing someone, they\u2019ll hit their head on the rocky shore.\u201cKurobe, I heard someone confessed to you!\u201dAs I gazed absentmindedly, I was nudged in the side. The lukewarm touch was unpleasant, and to conceal it, I took a step back and feigned surprise, saying, \u201cHuh?\u201d Standing next to me was a male classmate from the same class, brazenly pointing at the girl who had taken up my time earlier. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cShe was really cute. Why did you turn her down? She\u2019s smart, pretty, and has a great personality. There\u2019s no reason to reject someone like that.\u201d\u201cI have exams this year, you know.\u201d\u201cExams shouldn\u2019t matter, right? Normally, you could just date her. Such a waste.\u201dA waste. I didn\u2019t quite understand that sentiment.Somehow, by observing others, I could tell that it would be the right answer to date and marry someone who is suitable and causes minimal inconvenience in the future.But I didn\u2019t feel inclined to do so myself. It\u2019s convenient to be liked by others, so I act accordingly, but I don\u2019t see any benefits in genuinely liking someone. Being liked to a certain extent, enough to be utilized, and simply enjoying that is sufficient for me.\u201cEh, what a waste! I always get asked about you, you know,\u201d he exclaimed.\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re best friends, aren\u2019t we? Me and you!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cKurobe, you\u2019re terrible!\u201dI didn\u2019t understand what was funny, but the male student always laughed. He was deceived by my unenthusiastic laughter and probably thought it was a joke. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cAre you secretly have a sister complex or something?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cLiking your sister?\u201d\u201cNo, I get what you mean. But she\u2019s my sister, you know? My dad asked me to look out for her.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much I thought of my step-sister, who was close in age, apart from her usefulness. If I must say, she was noisy and troublesome.If I casually responded to her unproductive words, I would be considered a \u201cgood person.\u201d It was like feeding a poorly trained dog without much thought.\u201cBut she\u2019s cute, right? And she\u2019s your step-sister, isn\u2019t she? I wish I had a step-sister like her.\u201d\u201cThat sounds like a criminal mindset.\u201d\u201cCome on, we\u2019re only one year apart. It\u2019s fine.\u201dI would give her to you if you want. I didn\u2019t really need her anyway. I was just using her because it was convenient, not because I wanted to.However, saying that out loud would be troublesome, and I kept my mouth shut upon hearing footsteps approaching from behind. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cOnii-chan, are you almost done with the pool cleaning? And once we finish, do we have to fill it with water? I\u2019m starting to get tired of it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I replied.I had no interest. About the cleaning or anything Mai had to say.But Mai never doubted my words and innocently grew fond of me. It was convenient.\u201cI heard from a senior before that some teachers let us play in the pool at the end. So maybe we should do a good job.\u201dEven though I had never heard of such a thing. Mixing in some daydream imagination, Mai started to become motivated. However, in this scorching heat, I couldn\u2019t muster any enthusiasm and instead wore an anxious expression, thinking, \u201cI wonder if they have organized the kickboards\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure. Maybe they haven\u2019t done it\u2026\u201d\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll go check it out. I\u2019m worried about that area.\u201dI turned my gaze towards the boys from the volleyball club. I had no intention of getting involved in this troublesome charade.\u201cSee you later then, Onii-chan! Take care!\u201d\u201cYeah, see you later.\u201dThis summer vacation, it might be a good idea to try something new. Maybe by doing so, I could break free from this chronic boredom, at least to some extent.I walked away from the poolside, turning my back on Mai, and looked up at the vivid blue sky as I strolled along.

    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Reincarnated as the Little Sister of a Death Game Manga\u2019s Murder Mastermind and FailedCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel InfoA+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u25b3 331 DAYS AGO \u2013 Yukari\u2019s Perplexity(This is Yukari\u2019s POV)The first story is about Yukari from the original Desuge.The second is the story of Yukari who became friends with Mai who jumped into the pond.This is the first episode in the two-episode update.\u25c7[Classroom of Awe \u2013 side Yukari in Comic]There was a scary person in the class.Her name was Kurobe Mai. She was a girl with smooth, straight black hair that flowed down. She was also the vice president of the student council. We were in the same class, but I had never approached her. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u201cMake way.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAs I tried to enter the classroom, Kurobe Mai came from the front. We had been together since elementary school, but I had never talked to her, and she had never spoken to me. But somehow, I felt like she disliked me.I was slow to move, and when I spoke, I always ended up speaking slowly. Because of that, I often heard people saying mean things about me, saying that I was faking to look cute.During elementary school, I always spent recess time in the classroom. I wanted to join in and play dodgeball with the class, but I wasn\u2019t good at throwing or dodging the ball, so I became a burden. Even when they were picking teams for PE, it would become awkward if I joined in. Please read this at ChocoCats.On the other hand, Kurobe Mai had been in the same class with me for all six years of elementary school, and for the first and second years of middle school as well. She always took charge of the class, like a queen. She was serious, straightforward, and utterly different from me. I thought she was cool, but at the same time, she was intimidating. She had a crush on her older brother, who was the student council president. I could somehow tell. She always had a cold impression, but she would smile kindly at her brother.I entered the classroom and took my seat. However, there was no one to talk to, so I took out my smartphone and absentmindedly looked at it. The ten-minute breaks during class were tough. There was no one to talk to, and it wasn\u2019t enjoyable.I longed for the summer vacation. From now on, if I tried a little harder, there would be a Silver Week* , but after that, I would have to go to school from Monday to Friday until the winter break.*T/N: Silver Week is a string of consecutive holidays in September, occurring only in certain years.School was boring. I hated it.With a feeling of praying for school to end quickly, I turned my gaze to the blackboard. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7[Urgent Recruitment: How to support your precious friends \u2013 side Yukari in real life]I wondered what I should do when my friend changed.If they had taken a really bad path, I had to stop them and tell them it was no good. If they had changed for the better, I wanted to support them! I wanted to convey \u201cdo your best\u201d a lot and if they seemed tired, I wanted to say \u201cgood job\u201d to them. Please read this at ChocoCats.But\u2026\u201cI placed dominoes in my brother\u2019s room. On another side too. But I realized that dominoes aren\u2019t impressive unless there\u2019s a certain distance between them, and having just one colour was a bit too plain.\u201dIf they changed in a strange way, I wonder what I should do as a friend.\u201cFor bungee jumping, only jumping alone might have been somewhat plain. I need to think of something more flashy.\u201dIt was clear that my friend, Mai-chan, had started harassing her older brother. With a troubled expression, she gazed at the stage in the gymnasium.After the summer break, everyone had changed, whether it was getting a tan or cutting their hair. But Mai-chan, who didn\u2019t seem to have changed much in appearance, had undergone a remarkable transformation.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Onii-chan.\u201dShe said, voicing the scene as it was. But before, she would have exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s Onii-chan!!\u201d and poked me, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s so cool!\u201dRegardless of our friendship, it was obvious to everyone at school that Mai-chan had a crush on her brother. However, after the summer break, it felt like it had disappeared, like a burst soap bubble. Please read this at ChocoCats.Mai-chan used to tell me every morning, \u201cYou know, my brother always tells me that it\u2019s too early to get married. What do you think?\u201d But today, she didn\u2019t mention her brother at all and instead said, \u201cIt\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t it, Yukari-chan? Did you enjoy your summer vacation?\u201d She continued talking about TV shows and homework, causing a stir among our classmates.Even now, when it came to her brother\u2019s yearly reading session, she wore a tired look while whining \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay after school for reading sessions\u2026\u201d\u201cYukari can help with illustrations, but to read out loud, that\u2019s impossible for me\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, can I call you if I have to draw something?\u201d\u201cOf course~\u201dI enjoy drawing illustrations. When I saw cute animals or beautiful scenery, my dominant hand naturally started moving. Come to think of it, my conversation with Mai-chan started because of illustrations. Back in elementary school, when I was shy and couldn\u2019t fit in with the class, Mai-chan approached me and said, \u201cYukari-chan, you\u2019re good at drawing.\u201d Please read this at ChocoCats.As we started talking more together, I would be scared that the way I spoke was too \u201ccutesy\u201d or \u201ccreepy\u201d, but she would encourage me, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not true at all.\u201d So I knew she was a kind person\u2026 but\u2026I thought it would probably not be a good idea to ring a\u00a0mokugyo\u00a0towards your brother. It made quite a loud sound, and even Dad gave me a stern look, saying, \u201cIf the sound could be a bit quieter, it would be better for the neighbourhood\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Mai-chan, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice to do mean things to your brother, you know\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Yukari-chan. This is also necessary for the future peace.\u201dMai-chan patted my shoulder gently, trying to calm me down, but I couldn\u2019t understand her reasoning at all, and I was bewildered.But at least, even if I didn\u2019t understand what she wanted to do, I wanted to support her and help her when she was in trouble\u2026 That was what I thought in the gymnasium filled with the sound of cicadas. Please read this at ChocoCats.\u25c7T/N: Hi, I\u2019m seriously getting busy with stuff, I got new job, and now tutoring some kids, and I really really need to sort my schedules to make time to translate. So, I can\u2019t promise you a stable update but I will try to update at least once in a week or two weeks, no later than that.Anyway, hope you enjoy, see you in next chapter, and have a great day as always!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
