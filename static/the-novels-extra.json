The Story Within the Novel===[Kim Suho]17 \u2013 27 years old in the storyA righteous, honest man and a hard-worker. Though he comes from a common background, he is of extraordinary character and talent. As a genius who made his name known in the military academy, he possesses a sense of justice and other upright characteristics befitting a hero. He carries a special secret that he hasn\u2019t revealed to anyone.[Shin Jonghak]17 \u2013 27 years old in the storyThe fourth generation descendant of the Jinsung Corp, one of the greatest chaebol in Korea, which contends for the number one spot. As a child of a chaebol family, he is a narcissist and an elitist. Because of his personality and the sense of inferiority he feels against Kim Suho, he later becomes a villain.\u2019I have to be the best. I cannot tolerate anyone being above me.\u2019 With such obstinacy, he confronts Kim Suho.===The above two were the two main characters of my novel.Though the novel had many more characters, write them all down was impossible. Within my novel were billions of characters. Unless the characters have \u2018important roles\u2019 like the heroine or the helper, giving a character a name wasn\u2019t necessary.\u2026 Why was I saying all this?\u2014Hero Association\u2019s Agent Military Academy Seoul Branch Graduation, Class of 2024, Rank 1 Cadet, Kim Suho.It was because the story in my novel was happening in front of my eyes.Called up to the stage, Kim Suho walked up with a stiffened face as though he was nervous.We were in a huge auditorium suggestive of a temple. In it were 3000 cadets and thousands of spectators. Their gazes all turned to one person, Kim Suho.\u201cHe\u2019s Kim Suho? Wow.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome~\u201dSeveral women watched with admiration and adoration.\u201c\u2026This is why people say Gift is all that matters. Who cares if you try hard? People like him end up taking first place anyways.\u201d\u201cThat guy completely lucked out with his Gift.\u201dAnd naturally, he received the jealousy and envy of young teenagers.\u201cHis grades are said to be the greatest in the past 10 years.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard of him. His Gift was announced too, right? What was it again\u2026 Sword Saint?\u201dGuild associates, who came to watch the best cadet in recent history, flashed their eyes.They were looking down from the highest seats of the auditorium. However, I could hear their voices. They had to be at least a kilometer away, but as long as I looked their way, I could hear their words clearly.Not only their words, but I could also see their faces, almost as though I was right in front of them.Perhaps, this was my \u2018Gift.\u2019\u201cYes, in regards to swords, he is said to receive the world\u2019s protection.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 That\u2019s a pretty vague description, but I guess the information from the academy is all like that.\u201d\u201cWe called dibs on that kid so don\u2019t touch him.\u201dI recognized one of the whispering faces.Yun Seung-Ah. An important assistant of the main character and one of the heroines who almost became the main character\u2019s lover. Just when the two of them were hitting it off \u2013 in reality, when the main character was hitting off with many of the heroines \u2013 I suspended my novel. Thus, the two never became lovers.\u201cDibs? What dibs. When it comes to cadets, there is no such thing.\u201dAt another guild associate\u2019s callous words, Yun Seung-Ah smiled sweetly and rebutted.\u201cIs that why \u2018Essence of the Strait\u2019 can\u2019t escape second place?\u201dI knew Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s face. Surprisingly, she looked like my first love from college. That was probably because I thought of her when I was describing Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s character. Though, she was my crush to be exact.\u201c\u2026Can I take that as a challenge?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kidding, of course. Plus, we still have three years to go before we can scout any of them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s two years.\u201d\u201c\u2026You know contacting them before they graduate is illegal, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only if you\u2019re found out.\u201dYun Seung-Ah and the man glared at each other. With their staring contest as the starting point, the VIP seats\u2019 atmosphere began to heat up.And thus, the fight for Kim Suho had already begun.\u2014Class of 2024, Rank 2 Cadet, Shin Jonghak.Meanwhile, the other main character stood up.He was the descendant of the Jinsung clan. His appearance rivaled Kim Suho as well.The audience stirred just like when Kim Suho walked up. But unlike with Kim Suho, envy and jealousy didn\u2019t exist. There was only admiration and adoration. With Kim Suho, they thought, \u2018Why is he better than me?\u2019 but with Shin Jonghak, it was, \u2018He was better than me from birth.\u2019As if to show off his noble blood, Shin Jonghak walked up to the stage completely composed.Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak.Standing side by side, the two glared at each other.Electricity seemed to crackle from their eyes.Without a shadow of the doubt, these two were characters from my novel.Then where was I?I wasn\u2019t on the stage but in the farthest back seat of the auditorium. I wasn\u2019t \u2018one out of three thousand\u2019, but a member of the \u2018three thousand.\u2019 No guild associate looked my way.\u201cChundong, what rank are you? I\u2019m rank 2900.\u201dNext, to me, a boy resembling a piglet asked. On his nametag were the characters \u2018Kim Ho Sup\u2019. This meant that he had an eventual role. Though he couldn\u2019t be a Hero because of his nonexistent physical abilities, his Gift was outstanding for information gathering.\u201cChundong-chan\u2605?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dI didn\u2019t know who I was. I didn\u2019t even know why my name was Chundong.If something like this had to happen, shouldn\u2019t I be one of the two on stage?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHey, c\u2019mon, if you don\u2019t know that\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dOnce again, I didn\u2019t know. This world was the novel I wrote, but I was in the body of a character I had never written before. Other than being a cadet in the Agent Military Academy, I was the most ordinary and the most connectionless character, the type whose name wouldn\u2019t exist anywhere in the novel. In other words\u2026 I was an extra.[1]\u2026No, I was a speck of dust.1.

Cube (1)One day, I received an email. The sender asked if he could remake my novel.At the time, I was dumbfounded. I might have been on a short hiatus, but to ask to remake a novel that was in paid serialization\u2026I, of course, refused. In fact, I didn\u2019t reply.It was partly because doing something like that without permission would go against copyright laws, but it was also because I was ashamed of the \u2018hiatus\u2019 status I was in.The webnovel I was writing was called \u2018The Returnee Hero.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a sensation, but it was a fairly popular novel and the greatest hit in my five years of writing.But at the time I received the email, I had been on hiatus for three months.The reason was simple. The words didn\u2019t come to me.At first, I poured my passion into writing. My personal note on the world\u2019s setting neared 50,000 characters[1], and I poured my heart out in writing each chapter.But after a year of writing, I fell into an awful slump.Even so, the novel continued for six months, reaching the mid-late stage of the story. But because I forcefully pushed myself to write, the story was full of plot holes, and the personalities of the characters had collapsed. Unsurprisingly, the number of readers dropped by the day. I was too scared to even read the comments.In the end, I chose to go on hiatus.But no matter how long I rested, I couldn\u2019t continue with the story, not even a single sentence came out.When I was wallowing in misery from realizing my lacking writing skills\u2026I received another email asking to remake my novel.[[email\u00a0protected]][Please. This is for personal satisfaction. I will not reveal the remake version of the novel anywhere. It will only stay between me and you. Who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll be inspired by the remake and come up with a way to continue the story\u2026]It was a fairly long email consisting of six sentences, but what it was asking for was simple.He wanted to remake my novel for self-satisfaction.How much did he like my novel to send an email like this? Since I wasn\u2019t particularly proud of my work, I agreed, feeling thankful and ashamed.\u2026 In that case, was that the cause of this situation?The chance of winning the lottery was said to be 1 in 8,145,060. Then what was happening to me at this moment had to be a 1 in 7 billion chance.I was standing in an ordinary family home.But the world I was in wasn\u2019t my world, and I wasn\u2019t \u2018me.\u2019 Though one might think I was being philosophical, I really wasn\u2019t. It was just the best way to describe the situation I was in.I had become an extra in my novel.An extra I had no memory writing about.Kim Chundong.Chundong lived in an ordinary apartment room, but he didn\u2019t have parents. As for why, I, of course, didn\u2019t know.At 9 years old, Chundong was admitted to \u2018Agent Military Academy,\u2019 a place to nurture elites to fight monsters and Djinns.What ability did Chundong possess to pass its entrance exam?I didn\u2019t know.I didn\u2019t know anything about him. I didn\u2019t even know his face. I wasn\u2019t kidding. I really didn\u2019t.When I look in the mirror\u2026(?)That\u2019s what I saw. An oval with a question mark.This crazy body possession(?) or transmigration(?) was completely unreasonable. I had gone to bed just like any other day, but when I woke up, i found myself on the last day of the semester at Agent Military Academy.At first, I had two suspicions.First was that I was being pranked.But that idea was shot down in just five seconds. I couldn\u2019t even be bothered to explain why.Second was that I was dreaming.But I naturally came to dismiss the idea. As everyone knew, the thought of being in a dream never occurred to dreaming people, and more importantly, no dream continued for two weeks with such a clear sense of reality.As a result, I spent the past two weeks pondering whether the \u2018world inside the novel\u2019 should be treated as the \u2018reality I was in.\u2019Ding Dong\u2014Tatatatatata~Just like I\u2019ve been doing in the last two weeks, I was lying in bed and staring blankly at the ceiling when my smartphone alarm began to ring. Glancing over, I saw that it was \u2018time to go to school.\u2019\u201cWhy the hell do I need to go to school.\u201d13 days ago, it was Agent Military Academy\u2019s graduation. But the ones graduating were only non-combatant cadets, and non-combatant cadets couldn\u2019t be called Heroes. Combat class cadets had to attend the academy for three more years.These three years would be spent at [Cube], a Hero Academy.Unfortunately, this damned Chundong guy was a combat type cadet. Again, I had no clue who he was.\u201cAh\u2026 How frustrating.\u201dI had barely done anything for two weeks. I spent most of my time on the internet, ate food when I got hungry, went back online to search for a way out, laughed at the surprisingly funny variety shows airing on TV, ate food when I got hungry\u2026 Anyways, the only noteworthy event was going to Seoul two days ago for the three-hour long \u2018Cube Entrance Ceremony\u2019.I didn\u2019t want to go, but I had no other choice since I was told I would be expelled if I didn\u2019t attend.\u201cI do think I need to go, but\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t figure out who dropped me here, for what reason and with what power.But after living idly for two weeks, I reluctantly came to accept my fate.It seemed I would live this way for a long time.In that case, I at least needed to make a living for myself.In my novel, being a \u2018Hero\u2019 was anyone\u2019s dream job. Though things become serious midway through because of Villains, the hiatus was not long afterwards.I just had to survive until then. When the time came, I was sure I\u2019d figure something out.[7:33 AM]There was only 57 minutes until school.I got up and trudged to the bathroom.Standing in front of the mirror, mister question mark greeted me.\u201c\u2026 Screw this question mark. Is it ever going to go away?\u201dWithout joking, my face was a question mark. I didn\u2019t know why.It wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t describe my face. If that were the case, it didn\u2019t make sense for the other billions of people to have their own faces. So why was only Chundong\u2019s face a question mark?\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201dMurmuring begrudgingly, I washed my face. I could feel my skin. I had hair too. That made things all the more creepy.After cleaning myself up a bit, I changed into Cube\u2019s uniform, which I got at the entrance ceremony. Other than that, I had no other baggage.People who saw me in this uniform would undoubtedly send looks of envy, But I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.My face was a freaking question mark, how was I supposed to figure anything out?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTurning the doorknob, I glanced back.My home for the past two weeks. The apartment room I barely found thanks to the address written in my cadet card. It seemed I got attached to it in this short period of time. I felt like I would miss it.Cube floated in the middle of the East Sea. Once I left, I probably wouldn\u2019t come back.\u201cEhew.\u201dPutting behind the big apartment room I was happy to have, I stepped into the dark and unfamiliar world.1. 50,000 Korean characters is about 10,000 English wordsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cube (2)The world\u2019s greatest training institute boasting state-of-the-art magic, science, and engineering.[Cube]Cube was the name of a huge island located in the East Sea. This artificial island was twice the size of Yeouido.[1]In this huge area, there were only about 5000 Hero cadets, of which 1300 were first-years. While 2000 non-combatants graduated two weeks ago, elite cadets from all over the world gathered here, making it more competitive than before. In a way, the place was too harsh and dreary to be home for 17 to 19 year olds.And starting from the second year, magicians who chose to become Heroes would come from the \u2018National Magic University,\u2019 so that was another 200~300 cadets.Furthermore, there were training instructors, cafeteria ladies, cleaners, recruiters visiting occasionally, government associates, engineers who did maintenance and operations, soldiers dispatched as securities, doctors and researchers for taking care of cadets, convenience store workers who worked under Cube, and more\u2026 With all these people, about 50,000 people resided in Cube.Naturally, this place was a highly important hubbub where the attention of investors gathered. Given that my novel\u2019s setting was faithfully followed, Korea was a world power rivaling the United States. I seemed to remember listing several reasons for it, but the more obvious reason was that I was Korean.In any case, Chundong was a member of Cube so he could be said to be an elite. But I didn\u2019t allocate any story for Chundong.So Chundong\u2019s destiny should\u2019ve been to live in areas detached from the main storyline. While he would not have lived the important and burdening life of the main character, he probably would have lived a comfortable worry-free life.\u2026 And that was the life I wanted too.Staring at the door to the classroom, I sighed.[Novice \u2013 Veritas]Novice referred to first year cadets, while Veritas was the name of the class. Simply put, I was in year 1 class 1.I knew what this class was.Shin Jonghak and Kim Suho were in this class, and as cliques formed around them, many schemes, mostly started by Shin Jonghak and his followers, would make the class rowdy. As a member of the class, I would most likely be swept in regardless of my will.\u201cHuu.\u201dAfter collecting my breath, I slowly and carefully opened the door.The interior was sleek; white with no sign of dust and three long desks cascading up.Where should I sit? I looked around the classroom and found Shin Jonghak sitting on the farthest seat back. With his eyes closed and his hands in his pocket, he seemed imposing. Next to him was his childhood friend, Yoo Yeonha, chattering.The two of them didn\u2019t pay any attention to me.Thank. God.I sat down on the edge seat of the middle row.Like a proper extra, I looked straight ahead in a daze. There was no chalkboard, but a projection screen for holograms to be shown.Looking at it, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh. After going through high school and even mandatory military service, I couldn\u2019t believe I had to go back to school. There couldn\u2019t be a worse calamity.\u201c\u2026 Huuaam.\u201dCube\u2019s semester began on February. The outside was cold and the inside being warm naturally made me sleepy.Currently, it was 8 A.M. Class began at 8:30.In truth, I didn\u2019t expect to arrive this early. Going from Seoul to Cube was quick using the \u2018Portal,\u2019 but I expected to get lost once I got here. However, there was something called the Cube Bus, a bus that ran every 10 minutes around Cube that didn\u2019t exist in my original setting.Thinking about it now, it was a mistake on my part to have the main character walk around the huge campus all the time. Since the novel became a real world, it seemed it was fixing plot holes on its own.\u2026 Anyways, let\u2019s sleep a little. I don\u2019t want to think anymore.Closing my eyes, I dropped my head on the desk.\u2014Now!A thunderous shout woke me up.When I opened my eyes, the instructor was behind the podium.\u201cToday\u2019s the first day, so there won\u2019t be any special training, but I hope you all did your morning training. Training is never wrong, especially in the morning when mana density is high.\u201dMorning training?\u2026Oh, right. There was something like that. A training ground that opened up from 5 A.M. to 8 A.M. I had hurriedly stuffed it into the story to give the leading characters an opportunity to meet.\u201cNow, let\u2019s start with self-introductions. I\u2019m Kim Soohyuk, the instructor in charge of you all for the year.\u201dThat name, I could vaguely recall it.\u201cMy ranking point is 3850. World rank 9737. By the Association\u2019s classification, I would behigh-intermediate rank grade 5.\u201dThe students\u2019 eyes lit up. It was understandable. There were around two million Heroes in the world. Rank 9737 meant he was very skilled.\u201cI think that\u2019s enough for my introduction.\u201dKim Soohyuk seemed to have liked the students\u2019 reactions as the corners of his mouth curled up to a grin.\u201cThe first day will feel special. You might not have slept due to excitement and worry, or maybe you\u2019re feeling great about being able to improve yourselves. Heh, maybe you\u2019re happy to see your crushes again.\u201dThe cadets broke out into a small laughter. But the instructor froze his expression sternly.\u201cBut Cube isn\u2019t the same as it was before. I promise you, there will be no time for relationships. In Cube, you will experience several real combat situations. Look forward to experiencing how fearful the real world is.\u201dHis roguish smile sent a chill down my back.Combat training, I had to take part in that too.\u201cNext, Cube is objective. The only indicator of your success will be your grade. Guilds will only look at your grade. Thus, we will grade you accurately and strictly. If you underperform, you will be held back. Statistically, less than half of Cube\u2019s cadets graduate without repeating a semester. Even then, you can only be held back up to two years. Any more than that, you will be expelled. If you can\u2019t become a Hero, you will become an agent or a mercenary. I take it that that\u2019s not what you want.\u201dAfter giving the students a scare, the instructor paused and scanned the students\u2019 faces.\u201cI can already see a few faces I\u2019m familiar with.\u201dIt was the same for me.Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Yoo Yeonha, Chae Nayun, Rachel, Yi Yeonghan.These six were the important characters I could see at a first glance. Shin Jonghak sat with Yoo Yeonha. Since Kim Suho and Chae Nayun saw each other as rivals, they were distanced. Princess Rachel sat alone, and Yi Yeonghan sat behind Kim Suho.\u201cI repeat. At Cube, you will need to confirm the things you\u2019ve learned until now and hone your skills to be used in battle. There will be no kind training here. Remember that.\u201dWith that, Kim Soohyuk announced.\u201cNow get ready. What\u2019s scheduled for today won\u2019t take long. The first task is \u2018main weapon selection.\u2019\u201d*\u201cAny weapon you can think of should be here.\u201dA main weapon was exactly what it sounded like. High ranking Heroes called their weapons \u2018treasured weapons,\u2019 while weapons above [Unique] grade were given the title \u2018armament.\u2019But I didn\u2019t know what my main weapon was. I knew nothing about Chundong\u2019s past.\u201cStand in front of the weapon you want. We\u2019ll supply you with the training weapons. But don\u2019t look down on them just because they\u2019re training weapon. Their market price is 5 million won.\u201dThere were all sorts of weapons, more so than I could have ever imagined.Sword, spear, saber, dagger, rapier, halberd, greatsword, zweihander, bow, gun, whip, gauntlet, etc\u2026 The 100 students of Veritas class stood in front of the weapon they wanted.\u201cChoose carefully. Once you pick your main weapon, you won\u2019t be able to change it for at least 6 months.\u201dSword and spear were obviously the most popular choice. Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak stood in front of a sword and a spear respectively. 70 out of 100 chose the sword, spear, or saber, the so-called Holy Trinity of weapons. On the other hand, Yoo Yeonha chose the whip, Chae Nayun chose the bow, and Rachel chose the rapier.However, I simply stood in a daze.\u201cKim Chundong, why are you standing still?\u201d Kim Soohyuk asked.I stared blankly at the one weapon no one gave a glance.The weapon of choice in the modern world, one that didn\u2019t require an instruction manual and one that anyone could use with a click. But in this world, this weapon was the weakest lump of metal, a weapon avoided by every Hero. Most likely, it was only here for the sake of having all kinds of weapons be here.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut this was the only choice I had.I couldn\u2019t use any close ranged weapons. Even if Chundong was talented in one, I didn\u2019t want to participate in close ranged combat where blood splattered everywhere.\u201cKim Chundong.\u201dThe instructor\u2019s voice fell low, and other students\u2019 gazes fell on me. Shin Jonghak and Kim Suho were among them.I didn\u2019t like being at the center of attention.I quickly walked up and grabbed the weapon.I could feel the weight of the metal in my hand as the smell of rust tickled my nose.More eyes fell on me.The weapon in my hand was a handgun.1.

Cube (3)Guns were still excellent weapons in this world. But that was only for ordinary soldiers who couldn\u2019t wield mana.Rather than traditional bullets, this world\u2019s guns used \u2018magic bullets\u2019, bullets containing compressed mana with the power to kill low-intermediate rank grade 8 monsters. In comparison, the training saber said to cost 5 million won could only kill low-rank monsters on average. So, the gun was a stronger weapon on its own.But Heroes and mercenaries who could wield magic power didn\u2019t choose guns. That was because \u2018magic power\u2019 couldn\u2019t be applied to guns, so no matter how strong the user of a gun was, the weapon had a clear limit in potency.In choosing a main weapon, the most important aspect was its origin. In short, a weapon\u2019s grade went up the grander its origin was.For instance, guns were separated into three grades \u2013 mass-produced, custom-made, or masterpiece. Swords, on the other hand, had much more \u2013 artifact, armament, treasured, mythical, legendary, etc.This was because myths and legends were manifested in this world.The sword was a weapon of long and deep history. Naturally, many swords had descended from myths and legends.Sword of Freyr, demon blade Muramasa, magic sword Tyrfing, holy sword Durendal, king\u2019s sword Excalibur, etc\u2026 In this world, many swords of legends remained undiscovered in \u2018Dungeons\u2019 or \u2018Towers\u2019. Each of them was a priceless treasure. Of course, these treasures could only be used by those who were proficient with swords.Consequently, Heroes chose more ancient weapons. Even if they reached a bottleneck in their growth, a high grade weapon could help them break through.\u201c\u2026 Kim Chundong.\u201dKim Soohyuk called my name once more before activating his smartwatch. For some reason, I could also see the information hidden by the information protection system.It was information about me, cadet Kim Chundong.\u201cDidn\u2019t you use a sword?\u201dAs expected of an extra, Kim Chundong was an ordinary swordsman.\u201cI decided to change my weapon.\u201d\u201cAfter coming all the way to Cube?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKim Soohyuk didn\u2019t look happy with my choice but he nodded with a slight frown.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Cadets can make their own choices at Cube. Instructors won\u2019t interfere at all. But that also means the responsibility falls on cadets.\u201dKim Soohyuk moved on, but the whispering among students didn\u2019t stop. Whispers that should have been too quiet for me to hear, for some reason, I could hear them clearly. It seemed this was Chundong\u2019s Gift. How useless.\u201cGun? Is that guy insane?\u201d\u201cWhy did he even come to Cube if he wants to be a mercenary?\u201dBefore entering Cube, cadets got to try all sorts of weapons. It was to find the weapon that suited their Gift. But a Gift wasn\u2019t needed to use guns. You just had to put your finger on the trigger and pull.\u201cYou can easily change the main weapon you chose today. And regardless of what you chose, you will go through the same training and tests. That means the weaknesses of a weapon will be yours to handle.\u201dKim Soohyuk announced while looking my way.I get it, damn it. I just didn\u2019t have any other choice!The cadets here had been attending military academies since they were 7 or 8. In other words, they had been practicing cutting, slicing, breaking, and shooting for 10 years.But I was different.I didn\u2019t inherit Chundong\u2019s memories, and I was far from a swordsman in the real world. Heck, I wasn\u2019t even into sports. I wasn\u2019t much of a thrill-seeker either.In the end, I could only choose a long ranged weapon, so a bow or a gun. Thanks to Korea\u2019s military service, I was at least familiar with guns.\u201cNow, we\u2019ll assign you your rooms and your personal belongings will be sent there. Afterward, you\u2019re free. Classes will start four days later, that\u2019s next Monday.\u201dKim Soohyuk spoke as he looked at me with pity.And thus, the main weapon selection ended.*\u201cYo, gunner, are you for real?\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t understand. Are you one of those attention seekers? This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of someone choosing a gun at Cube.\u201dOn the way to the dorm, a group of guys struck up a conversation. I simply ignored their sarcastic remarks.Seeing me unperturbed by their provocations, the group left after snickering to themselves. As expected of teenage boys, they were more interested in female students.Even I turned my sights their way.Chae Nayun, Rachel, and Yoo Yeonha. These three girls\u2019 beauty had far surpassed my settings.While I observed them with a side-glance, we arrived at the dorm.\u201cHere are the dorms for the first years.\u201dSix extravagant skyscrapers stood in front of me.According to Kim Soohyuk, each building had 100 floors, each consisting of 5 rooms.The rooms were distributed according to grades, but even if one\u2019s grades were dead bottom, they still their own room. Agent Military Academy\u2019s top three male and top three female cadets got the penthouses. Kim Suho was the only one who gave up on it, saying it was too big for him to use.\u201cGuys are to the right, girls are to the left. The key to your rooms will be stored in the smartwatches you\u2019ll get now.\u201dWhile Kim Soohyuk explained, other first year classes arrived. If I remembered correctly, the first year classes were Veritas, Acceptance, Intelligence, Wisdom, Cultivation, Honor, Virtue, Friendship, Potential, and World \u2013 a total of 10 classes.Should I try looking for other major characters? Some of them should be antagonists\u2026\u201cChundong, Kim Chundong!\u201d\u201cHuh, me? Why?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why?\u201dKim Soohyuk was calling me. I was just distracted for a moment, but Kim Soohyuk\u2019s eyes narrowed like a hawk. His fierce gaze made me froze. Seemingly disappointed by my reaction, Kim Soohyuk closed his eyes and sighed.\u201c\u2026 Your smartwatch, come to take it.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dI almost fell over from my legs shaking. I could hear other students laughing behind me.You dare laugh at your creator?I got angry momentarily, but I generously chose to forgive them.Since I didn\u2019t have a way to get back at them, I didn\u2019t have any other choice.*The room assigned to me was bigger than Chundong\u2019s apartment and came with a couch, bed, rice cooker, TV, computer, and even magic tools.\u201c\u2026 I still can\u2019t get used to it.\u201dSlouching down on the comfy couch, I pondered.The weight of the handgun in my hand didn\u2019t feel real.Thinking about it now, it might have been better to leave Cube if I was going to choose a gun. Having been a cadet at the Agent Military Academy should have been enough to let me live without starving.But my problem didn\u2019t end there.Why I was sent to this world and how I could go back. To find out, I had the feeling I needed to stay close to the main storyline.\u2026 Though, I doubt I could get too close with just a gun.Should I try shooting it to see its power?\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dI thought of something good.Jumping up from the couch, I aimed at the wall and closed my left eye. Just when I was about to pull the trigger\u2026\u2014ding dongThe bell rang.An electronic voice rang out beyond the door.\u2014Rank 934, Kim. Chun. Dong. Take. Your. Luggage.It was a robot. Throwing the gun on the couch, I opened the door and saw a fairly big box on the ground.It seemed Chundong sent his belonging beforehand. I picked up the box and brought it in.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Agent Military Academy Rank 1543, Hero Military Academy Rank 934 Kim Chundong.

Synchronization (1)Eight students were gathered in a big room on the highest floor of dorm 1. They were all sitting in an arrogant delinquent-like manner, laughing loudly at even the smallest things. Occasionally, they stole stealthy glances at the one who called them over. But the person in question remained silent as though he couldn\u2019t care less.\u201cOh right, Jonghak, isn\u2019t there a gun user in your class?\u201dOne man asked him. He was a generic good-looking guy with an amiable smile. Shin Jonghak opened his eyes narrowly and stared back at him.\u201c\u2026 Um, I just heard it from somewhere. Did I hear wrong?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not interested in trash.\u201d\u201cR-Right. I\u2019m not really interested either, but I was just curious who the fool was, haha.\u201d\u201cHanjun, you sure are curious about the strangest things~\u201dA captivating voice cut through. Jin Hanjun turned his head and saw a long-haired girl smiling charmingly. It was Yoo Yeonha. Feeling his heart beating, the flustered Jin Hanjun blurted out.\u201cO-Oh, Yeonha. Y-You know, I was always like that.\u201d\u201cWhat was his name? Chundong? Chunbun? It was a pretty old-fashioned name. Anyways, don\u2019t pay too much attention to him.\u201d\u201cBut he sure was pathetic. Why did that son of a bitch come all the way to Cube if he was going to choose a gun?\u201dThe foul language came from Kim Horak. Bulky muscles, an intimidating expression, and a large physique. Even with just one glance, it was easy to see that he specialized in close ranged combat.Jin Hanjun asked Kim Horak, \u201cYou know him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in Jonghak\u2019s class, idiot. I\u2019m going to destroy him in combat training. I\u2019ll disable him and chase him out.\u201dEveryone knew Cube\u2019s schedule. There were classes five days a week and combat training three days a week.Classes referred to comprehensive magic power training and physical training, while combat training referred to battles, monster hunts, rescue missions, and more.\u201cI\u2019ll destroy that son of a\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time.\u201dWith a single sentence, Shin Jonghak cut down the coarse locker room talk. Kim Horak, who was growling just a moment ago, fell silent.\u201cEven if you win against someone so low rank, you\u2019ll be the one losing points. It\u2019s better to challenge higher ranked cadets who you can win against for sure. For example\u2026\u201d\u201cChae Nayun, try fighting her. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll win.\u201dYoo Yeonha cut in. Shin Jonghak narrowed his eyes and glared at her, but Yoo Yeonha continued unfazed.\u201cFist against bow. It\u2019s easy.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh? Ah, yeah, I can win. But\u2026\u201dChallenging her was difficult.However, he swallowed his words, wanting to look good in front of Yoo Yeonha.\u201cBut?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It would be too pitiful. You know, my opponents often end up half-dead.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dShin Jonghak stopped their conversation.Though Yoo Yeonha was displeased, she feigned indifference. She quietly suppressed the unpleasant feeling rising from the corner of her heart.\u2018Shin Jonghak liked Chae Nayun. I\u2019m not so stupid as to be jealous. I just found the situation funny.\u2019 Yoo Yeonha consoled herself.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now. It\u2019s almost ten.\u201dAt Cube, male and female students were only allowed to interact until 22:00. After giving a bright smile to mask her hurt feelings, Yoo Yeonha stood up.\u201cOh, good night.\u201d\u201cGood night, Yeonha!\u201d\u201cSee you later!\u201dAll the male cadets other than Shin Jonghak saw her off to the door.**Five minutes away from dorm 1 was a training facility called the \u2018Novice Fitness Center.\u2019 This 1000 square meter facility was filled with magical devices and equipment for exercise and training. The amount of money needed to construct such an environment would be well over a hundred million won, but there was barely anyone using the facility.But just because the training facility was empty, it didn\u2019t mean the future of Heroes was bleak.While cadets were would-be Heroes that would come to receive the admiration and envy of billions of people, they were still teenagers. Simply put, there weren\u2019t many high schoolers willing to go out of their way to train on the first day.\u201cI knew you\u2019d be here.\u201dBut an exception always existed. Even Hero Academy had a pervert who enjoyed training from the first day. Kim Suho, who was drenched in sweat and wrestling with an exercise equipment, widened his eyes at the sudden voice.\u201cChae Nayun? You\u2019re also here to train?\u201d\u201cYeah, but I won\u2019t be as barbaric as you.\u201dWith a wry smile, Chae Nayun pointed at the gravitation room. Seeing the terrifying cylindrical room, Kim Suho frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s a tough one. I can never last long in there.\u201dKim Suho wiped his sweat with a towel he brought.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t, you just don\u2019t need to. I\u2019m an archer, so I need to train in there. Plus, it\u2019s not that hard. I\u2019ve been doing it since I was 8.\u201d\u201c8 years old?\u201d\u201cYep. I have one in my house.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Aha.\u201dSetting up a gravitation room cost several hundreds of millions of won at least. From what Chae Nayun said, it could be inferred that she came from a very wealthy background.Just like Shin Jonghak, Chae Nayun was a fourth generation chaebol. But rather than a twisted superiority complex, she carried a righteous sense of rivalry. She believed she could surpass her rivals through hard-work and self-cultivation. But in front of the monster standing in front of her, her belief always seemed to waver.\u201c\u2026Oh, right. There\u2019s another sharpshooter in our class now.\u201dKim Suho mentioned, to which Chae Nayun tilted her head curiously.\u201c\u2026Sharpshooter? Oh, that Chudong or whatever guy?\u201d\u201cUh, yeah, him\u2026 What\u2019s up with that look? Do you not like him?\u201dLike Kim Suho pointed out, Chae Nayun\u2019s face was stiffening frighteningly.\u201cHe\u2019s not a sharpshooter. Guns can only shoot up to a kilometer at best. I still don\u2019t understand why that Dongchu guy picked a gun.\u201dHis name had unknowingly changed from Chudong to Dongchu, but Kim Suho wasn\u2019t so foolish as to point out her mistake.\u201cI think he gave up. Maybe there was trouble at home or something. SInce being a Cube cadet won\u2019t stay on your records if you leave early, he\u2019s probably just going to stay for a while.\u201d\u201cGave up? Don\u2019t say something like that so easily.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who are you to tell me what and what not to do?\u201dFor a moment, slight anger emerged from Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes. Kim Suho\u2019s teaching tone didn\u2019t sit well with her, who saw him as her rival.\u201c\u2026Kuhum. Sorry.\u201d\u201cAnyways, if you don\u2019t want to lose, keep working hard. I\u2019m going.\u201d\u201cYeah, see you later.\u201d\u201cPlease, I\u2019m right next doors\u2026\u201dChae Nayun smirked and went into the gravitation room.The gravitation room multiplied the gravity by a certain factor, thus increasing the pressure on one\u2019s bloodstream. Training in this cylindrical room required one to operate magic power under heavy gravity, and it was easily one of the most painful training methods.For Kim Suho, just looking at the room made him shudder. Seeing Chae Nayun walk into it nonchalantly, he could only shake his head.**Inside Kim Chundong\u2019s room, I held my breath while looking at a laptop screen.I still couldn\u2019t understand what I was seeing. I could see it, but my brain refused to process what was in front of me. It just seemed too absurd.\u201c\u2026What is this?\u201dAfter a long silence, I blurted out with a trembling voice.===[Synchronizing\u2026 70% Complete]===1.

My hands and feet trembled, and my heart began to pound.This strange object, just who sent it to me, for what purpose, and for what reason?At that moment\u2026The laptop screen turned off.From the black laptop screen, a face was being reflected. It wasn\u2019t Kim Chundong\u2019s question mark, but my face, Kim Hajin\u2019s face.Without giving me a chance to be shocked, the laptop turned back on and words began to appear on the laptop screen.[Kim Chundong, synchronization with Kim Hajin complete.][All status reset.][Unique Authority, \u2018Setting Intervention\u2019, acquired.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Synchronization (2)In this world, there was an awakening phenomenon called \u2018enlightenment.\u2019 Often called the first qualification to becoming a Hero, enlightenment was a form of personal insight said to occur when a person surpassed one\u2019s limits.Active-duty Heroes were all enlightened. But because numerous experiences and training were required to reach enlightenment, most cadets had yet to experience enlightenment. Of course, there were exceptions like Kim Suho or Shin Jonghak. They were enlightened at the age of 15 and 17, respectively.An enlightened person could see their Gift, skills, and abilities objectively, and thus train more efficiently. Furthermore, enlightenment allowed one to acquire \u2018clear rewards\u2019 from Towers and Dungeons.The Hero Association called this phenomenon the \u2018status window.\u2019 It was an established fact that a status window could only be seen by its owner.But because I liked exceptions, I also put in exceptions to this setting.In place of one\u2019s eyes, one could use other sensory organs or other mediums such as a book or a weapon to see one\u2019s own status. Special enlightenment naturally came with special powers. Though it was a bit of a spoiler, the main character would undergo two enlightenments because of this setting.\u201c\u2026 Is this that?\u201dAccording to my setting, this laptop could be said to be a medium for enlightenment.I began to grow a bit excited. No one hated being special.But rather than being happy, analyzing the situation came first.When I hit the Enter key on the keyboard, several windows popped up.===[Synchronization Complete]======[Kim Chundong\u2019s status reset.

My stats also seemed to have been adjusted appropriately.Compared to Chundong, I was much weaker, but I obtained 10 spare Points as compensation. With Points, I should be able to raise the stats I want.\u201c\u2026 Points are really nice.\u201dAs the world\u2019s creator, I was well aware of the importance of Points. An average adult had 1.5 points in each stat. Furthermore, this world didn\u2019t have a concept like leveling-up. So \u2018Points\u2019, which could raise one\u2019s desired stats, were extremely rare and expensive, obtainable only from Towers or Dungeons.Kim Suho\u2019s current magic power stat should be around 9. In other words, if I put the 10 Points I had into raising my magic power, my magic power would come to surpass Kim Suho\u2019s\u2026\u201cNo.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t the best plan. With only a stupidly high magic power, I would have to become a magician, but being a magician was exhausting. Not only was it expensive, it also required extreme effort and memorization. I would need to increase both intelligence and perseverance, but invariable stats couldn\u2019t be raised even with Points.In other words, being a magician was out of the picture.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with the three question marks?\u201dThe next line to catch my attention was obviously the suspicious question marks.===\u25b7???\u2014Will be unlocked when the main story completes.===It was what caught my attention next after synchronization and reset.Unlocked when the main story completes.Perhaps, this was the key to going back. Even if it wasn\u2019t, it was the only clue I had.The problem was that I didn\u2019t know when the main story would end. If it referred to the storyline before I went on hiatus, I would have to wait 10 years at the very least\u2026One thought led to another.First, I had to find a way to go back home. To achieve that, I needed power or authority. To achieve power or authority, I needed something called \u2018SP\u2019. To obtain SP, I needed to get involved in the storyline. To do that, I needed to get stronger or stand out.\u201c\u2026 Gun. Looks like it wasn\u2019t such a bad choice.\u201dA gun met both of these conditions.First was power.A gun didn\u2019t require high stats to be useful. Close ranged weapons like the spear or sword required equal distribution into all stats. While the importance of the stamina stat was less for a bow, the other stats were still necessary. On the other hand, speed, perception, and a tiny bit of magic power were enough to use a gun.In other words, it was easier to meet the \u2018minimum strength\u2019 requirement with a gun.The second was specialness.No Hero in this world used a gun. That was more than enough to make me special.So it seemed I should continue using the gun. At least, until my stats increased and I was mentally ready to fight monsters at close range.With my main weapon decided, I could move on to the next topic.Gift.\u201c\u2026I can create my Gift.\u201dA Gift held a special meaning for Heroes, but it still held on to its dictionary meaning.The natural ability or talent for something.But the standard for this ability was high. At the very least, a Gift had to be like a psychic ability.Gifts were separated into many categories. The five most common were \u2018weapon\u2019, \u2018physical\u2019, \u2018element\u2019, \u2018magic\u2019, and \u2018nature.\u2019As for the main character, he worthily had two Gifts. The Gift he currently awakened was the weapon class Gift, \u2018Sword Saint\u2019. It was a super cheaty Gift that gave him the world\u2019s protection in regards to swords. Simply put, his sword could cut water. Just this single Gift was enough to make him the world\u2019s greatest Hero.That was how important Gifts were. It didn\u2019t need to be complex. A stronger and more efficient Gift was better.I began to type.===\u25b7Gift\u2014Getting Stronger Every day[Null attribute]Every 24 hours, increase all stats by 0.1.===\u201c\u2026 Will this work?\u201dEven I found it shameless. When I went on hiatus, Kim Suho\u2019s strength stat was at 16. With this Gift, I would obtain 36.5 into all stats in just 365 days.But since it could be reverted before it saved, I gave it a go.[Novice Consideration activated.

I especially liked that it applied to \u2018all long ranged weapons\u2019. With this, I could use a bow if I wanted to. The Thousand-Mile Eyes seemed pretty self-explanatory, and Bullet Time probably increased my shooting speed or the like.It was satisfactory, but there was still something I needed to change.[Static]Rather than a static Gift, which was a Gift that couldn\u2019t grow, a Gift that could get stronger was better.[A phrase has been modified.]===\u25b7\u300cMaster Sharpshooter\u300d[Low-intermediate rank] [Spirit attribute] [Evolving \u2014 Grade 10] [EXP 0%]\u2014Master Sharpshooter\u2019s Training*Familiarity with all long ranged weapons\u2014Thousand-Mile Eyes*Can see far away and somewhat predict target\u2019s movement path.\u2014Bullet Time*In combat only and once every 24 hours, you can spend 3 seconds in \u2018Bullet Time\u2019.===\u201cMm.\u201dIt fell from high-intermediate rank to low-intermediate rank and the skills became weaker overall, but in the grand scheme of things, an evolving Gift was much better.

In that case, I had to pick from variable stats.However\u2026I might be able to modify invariable stats.\u201c\u2026 Should I exchange them for SP?\u201dPoints could be exchanged with SP. Perhaps, it was possible to change invariable stats using SP.But before making an irreversible mistake, I decided to give it a test. Thankfully, I had 64 SP, so I tried changing perseverance stat from 5.010 to 5.500.[Using 64 SP, you modified an invariable stat.][You do not have enough SP. The value will be adjusted. Perseverance was changed to 5.060.]\u201cIt worked?\u201dMy eyes widened. If this worked, what I should do next was obvious. I had to convert my Points into SP and invest in invariable stats.The question was which stat to choose\u2026Intelligence. Perseverance. Luck. Charm.To be honest, as a man, the charm was extremely enticing.\u201cLuck it is.\u201dBut I knew all too well how important the luck stat was in this world.I remembered a line from my novel.[Luck stat doesn\u2019t just affect the chances of finding treasures in Dungeons. It also affects chances of getting bonus stats from training, chances to land a critical strike from attacks, and even chances to win a lottery. It was the best stat that applied to all sorts of situations\u2026Life was like that. Luck was what mattered the most.]Without hesitating any longer, I used 10 Points to gain 10,000 SP.Using all 10,000 SP, I increased luck to its maximum.What I wanted was [Luck \u2014 10/10][You do not have enough SP. The value will be adjusted.]The laptop rejected my ridiculous wish and returned a reasonable compromise.[Luck \u2014 9.100]\u201c9.1 is the highest I can go, huh.\u201dSince 9 was the limit for humans, 9.1 was extremely high.But I didn\u2019t hit \u2018save\u2019 and canceled the modification.Though it would take a bit longer, there was a more efficient method.[Luck \u2014 6.4/10]First I raised my luck from 6.3 to 6.4 and saved. Next, to 6.5. Next, to 6.6, 6.7, 6.8\u2026 Doing this repeatedly\u2026[A mysterious luck applies! Your luck stat further increases by 0.01!][A strange luck applies! Your luck stat further increases by 0.05!]\u2026\u2026[Luck \u2014 9.100/10]With this method, I got my luck stat to reach 9.1 with just 9000 SP. I had saved 1000 SP.For reference, the \u2018Great Sage\u2019 of this world had 9.5 intelligence stat. As 9 was the limit for \u2018normal\u2019 humans, spending the remaining 1000 SP was unlikely to increase my luck further.In exchange, higher invariable stats had an exponential effect. But now, it was better to use the remaining SP elsewhere.\u201cPerseverance should be good.\u201dIn my current situation, training was key. But with my old mindset, I would never be able to digest Cube\u2019s training. I didn\u2019t even want to do 10 push-ups.Without hesitation, I put in the remaining 1000 SP into perseverance.I wrote, [Perseverance \u2014 8/10][You do not have enough SP. The value will be adjusted.][Perseverance \u2014 6.600]Though I wasn\u2019t too satisfied, I hit save.Effect of luck only applied after saving.[An incredible luck applies!][Your perseverance stat increases from 6.600 to 7.207!]\u201cWow.\u201dNow I was satisfied. But I didn\u2019t feel any different. 4 was the standard for an average person. 7 should be at the level of a talented individual.In any case, I was happy. As I increase my invariable stats whenever I gained SP, I was sure I would just as cheaty as the main character.Immediately after I had such blissful thought\u2026[An error that could greatly affect the plot has been detected. From now on, invariable stats cannot be modified with SP.]\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s this?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA warning window popped up on the laptop screen, shutting down my plan for the future.\u201cHm.\u201dIntervention by the world?Though I was displeased, I had no other choice. Nothing would change even if I argued with the air. Plus, I was already full of luck, which was what I wanted.\u201cWhatever~\u201dWithout much thought, I closed the laptop and got up with a grin.Now, it was time to test the Gift I created.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Synchronization (3)In the middle of the night, I got out of my room. The handgun in my pocket rattled uncomfortably, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it without a holster.My destination was the shooting range.Located east of dorm 1, the shooting range was a dome shaped building consisting of 20 training rooms. The targets were oddly distributed around where the sharpshooter would stand. This was because unlike bullets, magic arrows could easily change their trajectory.[Rank 934, Kim Hajin, confirmed.]When held my smartwatch against the shooting range\u2019s entrance, an unfamiliar robotic voice called my name. Indeed, my name had changed from Kim Chundong to Kim Hajin. Feeling a bit odd, I walked inside.Past the wide circular lobby, there were ten doors evenly separated from each other. I held up my smartwatch against one of them.[Rank 934, Kim Hajin, confirmed.]The door opened.The shooting range looked simple. At the center of the 130-square-meter circular space was a scaffolding for the shooter. I walked towards the center. When I placed my feet on the low scaffolding, a courteous robotic voice rang out from the ceiling.[Initializing targets. Choose the number of targets you want.][You must choose at least 2 and can choose at most 20.]\u201cTen.\u201dMy voice rang through, and insect-like blue objects popped up from the ground.I looked at the targets surrounding me. A monster that was barely considered a monster, mole cricket. They were similar to mole crickets everyone knew, the only difference being that they were much bigger.[Choose your training difficulty.][You can choose from stage 1 to stage 9.]Higher level naturally meant targets moved quicker. At stage 9, the targets even attacked. Although the attacks should only sting at best, they were extremely dangerous to me.\u201cStage 4.\u201dFirst, I set the difficulty to stage 4 and loaded my magic bullets. If I was skilled in handling magic power, I should be able to compress magic power into bullets without having to get physical bullets, but the current me didn\u2019t have such talents. And even if I could do such a thing, using a bow was much more destructive and efficient.\u201cStart.\u201dFirst, I notified the system to start and aimed my gun at the leftmost target.The slowly moving mole cricket seemed to have noticed my hostility as it began to speed up. It scuttled around without a set movement pattern, but I could see its trajectory. It was like I was seeing an afterimage, but of its future path.Predicting its movement by a step, I pulled the trigger.A blue flare shot up from the barrel. There was no loud noise like the guns from Earth. Leaving the barrel silently, the bullet should pierce the mole cricket.I didn\u2019t bother to check the result with my eyes. The moment the bullet went out, I moved on to the next target and fired. My hand moved on its own.One, two, three, four\u2026 ten.The trigger was pulled ten times, and the mole crickets that were struck scattered into particles of mana.Only two targets survived.\u201cOho.\u201dI was quite impressed.Just by writing a Gift, I managed to hit all the mole crickets other than the farthest two.[Your training ended. Elapsed time: 1.37 seconds. Sharpshooting score: 80/100]In just 1.37 seconds.\u201c\u2026 This is pretty fun.\u201dAn eternal truth. The better you are at something, the more fun it is. It was fun because you were good at it.Feeling like I was at an arcade, I shouted \u2018start\u2019 once more.*An eternal truth. No matter how fun something is, doing it twenty times makes it boring.At about 3 A.M., I stopped my shooting practice. After getting out of the shooting room, I was relaxing my sore finger when I heard a noise next door.\u2014whoosh whoosh whooshThe faint sound of shockwaves. It was the sound of arrows cutting through the air. The source was the room next door. Curious, I snuck a peek. I shouldn\u2019t have been able to see anything because of the closed door, but I could see through it.The door turned faint and the interior revealed itself.The scene beyond the door was showing why bows were superior to guns.\u201cIt\u2019s Chae Nayun.\u201dChae Nayun was target practicing with a serious face. Four arrows were sitting on her bow. They were magic arrows weaved with magic power. Because her magic power technique was currently lacking, she couldn\u2019t perform \u2018split shot\u2019, which multiplied a single arrow into multidirectional shots.\u2014Whoosh!Chae Nayun let go of the bowstring. Her arrows left behind a blue trace of magic power as they hurled towards the 20 targets. As though they were alive, her arrows obliterated the targets.\u201c\u2026 Amazing.\u201dI exclaimed in shock.Still, Chae Nayun\u2019s real aptitude wasn\u2019t for bows. There was a weapon that suited her much more. But if she was already that amazing with a bow, just what kind of a setting did I make?At that moment, Chae Nayun suddenly turned around. Her eyes met mine. Though there was no way she could see me through the wall, something still seemed odd.I quickly escaped.*[Sharpshooting training increases your Gift\u2019s proficiency by 3%].[Repeated sharpshooting training increases your Gift\u2019s proficiency by 2.9%][\u2018Luck\u2019 applies!

Combat Training (1)\u2018Outcall\u2019 \u2013 a magic power explosion that occurred 50 years ago and shook the world. Following this event, mysterious entities like Towers, Dungeons, and monsters began to appear in the world. These existences of chaos shook the very foundation of humanity. The blue planet of humans turned into hell. Monsters devoured humans, and Towers and Dungeons ceaselessly produced monsters like factories.In front of these newfound calamities, humanity\u2019s science and technology lost their meaning. Society collapsed and the rule of law returned to the law of the jungle. Survivors of the tragedy crumbled to their instincts, losing the virtues that made them human.Within this hellfire, Heroes emerged shining stars.With transcendental powers, they corrected the chaos. The world was reconstructed just as quickly as it collapsed. Using Gifts bestowed by heaven, they brought about miracles with a flicker of their hands. With their help, humanity recovered their lost virtue, joining the Heroes with revitalized technology and science. \u2018Magic science\u2019 and \u2018magic engineering\u2019 was thus born.\u2026Eventually, Towers, Dungeons, and monsters were all designated as targets to be destroyed. However, the differences among them were great.Towers required many people and a long period of time to be conquered. On the other hand, depending on their difficulty, Dungeons could be conquered by a single person, so long as he knew its location.Towers gave better rewards, containing treasures that humans had never dreamed of.Then what was the name of the Tower conquered by the guild Apostle of Saints on August 17th, 2023, and what was its reward?\u201cMinor questions like these don\u2019t come up often, but you should still know about conquests of Towers and Dungeons.\u201dMorning class was \u2018Post-Outcall History.\u2019 The few sentences I had written had turned into a 400-page textbook. Things to remember were rewards from Towers, names of monsters, locations of Dungeons in Korea, conquerors of Towers and Dungeons, and countless others.Even as the author, there was too much information to process. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t pose much of a problem for me, all thanks to my gift \u2018Observation and Reading.\u2019[On August 17th, 2023, the Apostle of Saints conquered the Tower of Floods and obtained an ocean stone.]Whenever I looked at something, I could get the information about it, so I had nothing to worry about.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dOn the other hand, the girl sitting in front of me scratched her head and sighed.Looking at the character I made, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Chae Nayun hated studying. She had the ability to take the number one spot among female cadets, but because written exams were holding her down, she had to give up the first place seat to Rachel. Even if she gnashed her teeth in mortifying defeat, written exams were still too much of a hurdle for her.At that moment, Chae Nayun turned her head halfway towards me. Her curt eyes glared at the person sitting behind her \u2013 me. She must have heard my laughter. After all, Sharpshooters had keen senses.I pretended to be calm as I lowered my head and focused on taking notes. Chae Nayun clicked her tongue and faced back front.The lesson continued.Places with high mana density, monster behavior, Djinns on the wanted list\u2026The bell rang only after two hours had passed.\u201cMake sure to go back and read the notes you took today. Otherwise, you\u2019ll cry on the exam.\u201dThe grey-haired professor wearing round eyeglasses left with those words.\u201cArgh, so annoying, why do I have to learn all this? Written exams are so annoying.\u201dChae Nayun began to complain the moment the professor left. However, her face was full of smiles. It was most likely because of the next class.Anti-monster combat training.Just like its name suggested, it was combat training against monsters. The monsters used in the lesson were mana puppets, but their appearance and destructive power were faithful to the real thing. Of course, they were weaker than their real counterparts, but there was a high chance of getting injured.I was scared.\u201cWe\u2019re meeting at the field in 20 minutes!\u201dA loud voice rang out in the classroom. I turned towards the voice.Oval face, small gentle eyes, and a muscular body that didn\u2019t match his face. It was Kim Suho\u2019s supporter, Yi Yeonghan. Knowing the conflict between Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak, the instructor in charge of the classroom chose Yi Yeonghan to be the class president.\u201cEhew.\u201dI just hoped it wouldn\u2019t hurt.*After a 20 minute break, everyone from the Veritas class gathered at the Novice Field. With 100 people here, it seemed quite crowded. The cadets were sharing their half-nervous half-excited expectations with their friends, but I was alone. Only I was alone.\u201cFuck\u2026\u201dWhile I was wallowing in loneliness, the instructor, Kim Soohyuk, showed up.The cadets immediately stood in ten columns in front of him.\u201cI\u2019m sure you all know what this lesson is about, so I\u2019ll announce the teams without explanation. Unless something special happens, this team will be the same until after the midterms.\u201dTeam formation. The cadets grew restless at the exciting yet nerve-wracking process.A team generally consisted of five members \u2013 two warriors, one sharpshooter, one supporter, and one utility player. Warriors were usually close range combatant like spearman or swordsman, sharpshooters were the long ranged attacker, and supporters were people like Yoo Yeonha and Yi Yeonghan who attacked themselves or supported the main attackers.Finally, the utility player was generally the magician\u2019s position, so it was excluded until the first year ended. When a magician was added, the supporter would have an additional role in protecting the magician. After all, magicians were important.My role here was a bit iffy. Roles were assigned based on the main weapon we chose, and while I wasn\u2019t a warrior, I was too lacking to be a sharpshooter. Guns had a much shorter range than bows, and guns were weaker compared to melee weapons that could attack from afar.[Sharpshooter (long range) \u2014 Rank 4 Chae Nayun, Rank 9 Im Yeongjin\u2026 Rank 934 Kim Hajin, Rank 945 Oh Jiyun]In any case, it seemed I was assigned as a sharpshooter.Kim Soohyuk announced.\u201cTeam members will be selected fairly. Lower ranked cadets will be paired with higher ranked cadets.\u201dCube\u2019s training classes were administered by the artificial intelligence developed by the Great Sage. As a result, there was no room for corruption or persuasion.I could see the pitiful result with my own eyes.[Team 1][Kim Suho / Kim Lang][Sung Seung-Un / Paine][Team 2][Demian / Rosen][Chun Lee / Chae Nayun]\u2026\u2026[Team 5][Jin Hoseung / Hazuki][Kim Hajin / Yoo Yeonha]\u201c\u2026\u201dLooking at my assigned team, I became lost for words.Yoo Yeonha.Yoo Yeonha was on my team. In my novel, she was one of the most loved and hated character.Looking around, I met her eyes. Her jewel-like eyes flashed with deep contempt and disdain. But that was only for a moment. By the time I blinked once, the negative feeling in her eyes was gone.Surprisingly, she walked towards me with a smile. Her long hair fluttered with each of her dignified steps. Her beautiful lips moved modestly.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cAh, um, I\u2026\u201d\u201cHoseung-ssi.\u201dBut I wasn\u2019t the one Yoo Yeonha greeted. Meeting her eye was also my imagination. She was talking to the guy standing behind me.\u201cAh, hello.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t we on the same team before?\u201dShe talked too politely for a 17-year-old, but that was how Yoo Yeonha liked to keep her distance.\u201cYes? Ah, right, haha.\u201dAfter exchanging just two sentences, Jin Hoseung broke out in a cold sweat. Yoo Yeonha was difficult to talk to, and it wasn\u2019t just because of her background and insane personality. Yoo Yeonha and Shin Jonghak were a couple officially, but not unofficially. At this point, it should be more like a one-sided crush from Yoo Yeonha.\u201cAh, Hazuki-ssi is coming too.\u201d\u201cHello\u2026\u201dLike his name suggested, Hazuki was a Japanese cadet. She walked over with eyes that looked like she was about to cry. Yoo Yeonha glanced at her slightly displeased, then spoke.\u201cWho\u2019s the other person?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dYoo Yeonha didn\u2019t like people who lacked confidence and self-esteem. As such, I stepped up confidently. Hazuki and Jin Hoseung turned towards me first.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dHazuki tilted her head as though she didn\u2019t know who I was.\u201cAh, the guy who chose a gun.\u201dWhen Jin Hoseung mentioned my previous feat, I checked Yoo Yeonha\u2019s expression. Unexpectedly, she didn\u2019t show any emotion. But that was even more frightening.At that moment, Kim Soohyuk shouted loudly.\u201cThere\u2019s no time for chitchat. You should have gotten the coordinate and information of the monster you\u2019ll need to kill on your smartwatch. Get going!\u201dA total of 25 teams. Including the other classes that joined in, there was a total of 100 teams.Our mission was to head to the coordinate given to us and kill the monster there.We were then ranked based on how quickly and how safely we completed our mission.Wiing\u2014As soon as the instructor\u2019s voice rang out, Yoo Yeonha projected her smartwatch to the air.[Blackhump Octopus 37\u00b0 31\u2019 32\u201d N]The monster\u2019s name and coordinate were written there.Yoo Yeonha spoke tersely.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We can talk while we\u2019re moving.\u201d*I was running through a field. Beyond this ocean of golden reeds should be the black hump octopus.But running was extremely difficult due to my horrible physical stats. The sneakers I made last night seemed useless. Its one-hour duration had not run out, but my stamina had already bottomed out.In the end, I fell down while running, and the team stopped because of me.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. What matters is whether or not we can kill the monster.\u201dSeeing me gasping for breath on the ground, Jin Hoseung said as he handed me a bottle of water.\u201cHe\u2019s right. Apparently, this is common when you work with magicians.\u201dHazuki also consoled me with her mediocre Korean.I was thankful, but I was checking for Yoo Yeonha\u2019s reaction the most.Contrary to my expectations, she didn\u2019t seem too displeased. She was simply sitting modestly on the ground, reading information about the black hump octopus on her watch.I also pulled up the necessary information from my head.===[Blackhump Octopus]\u2014low-intermediate rank monster\u2014Special features*The main body isn\u2019t strong, but numerous baby octopuses pop out from the hump on its head. As dozens pop out at once, it isn\u2019t easy to deal with them. Baby octopuses can suck human blood and turn them into mummies in just one second. They are classified as low rank monsters.\u2014Strategy*Eliminate all baby octopuses. Alternatively, destroy the black hump where the main body\u2019s magic power is created.\u2014Weakness*Black hump\u2014Strength*Suction cups and baby octopuses===Perhaps because I was the one who wrote the setting for the black hump octopus, a thorough information on the monster came out.\u201cI\u2019ll deal with the babies while you two take care of the main body.\u201dSoon, Yoo Yeonha turned off her smartwatch and said to Hazuki and Jin Haseung.Ah, I get it now.Yoo Yeonha was acting like I didn\u2019t exist. I was at the same level as air, which was why she didn\u2019t reprimand me or seem displeased.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s go now.\u201dOffended by her treatment, I forced myself to get up. Thanks to my sneakers, my stamina had recovered.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll go first. Hup!\u201dI ran ahead of them.

Combat Training (2)\u201cThere.\u201dRight when my legs were about to give out, we found our target monster. A giant octopus running amok near the beach. There was a black hump was on its that made it seem as though it had two heads.\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke as she lowered her body in the thicket. Jin Hoseung and Hazuki took out their sword and axe, respectively.\u201cWhen we run at it, baby octopuses will pop out of its hump. When that happens, the two of you should fall back and be on standby until I kill them all. Warriors need to save their magic power as much as possible. Black hump octopuses have high regenerative power, so we need to remove its hump in a single blow\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s explanation continued.In reality, it was best to leave the baby octopuses to me. A handgun had a high base power, so it could kill any number of baby octopuses in one blow. On the other hand, it was hard to damage the main body unless a critical hit occurred.However, Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t say anything to me.So I just stood still, holding myself back from yawning.\u201cThen let\u2019s start.\u201dThe moment her words fell, Jin Hoseung and Hazuki ran up. After closing in a fair amount, Jin Hoseung straightened his throat before roaring.\u201cKueeeeek!\u201d\u201cKyak!\u201dMy ears felt burning, but it had the desired effect. The back hump octopus lowered its head after discovering us. It then pointed its cannon-shaped hump towards us.BOOM!A thundering sound rang out, and dozens of creatures shot out of its hump. Seemingly mushy lumps rained down on us from the sky.As planned, Jin Hoseung and Hazuki stepped aside, while Yoo Yeonha held up her whip, clearly coursing with magic power.But I held up my handgun before Yoo Yeonha could make her move.\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha tried to stop me in shock, but I ignored her.Now was the only time I could shine.I activated Bullet Time.Immediately, the blood in my body began to boil. My vision became clearer and the world slowed down. I could see and predict the trajectory of the raining octopuses. Their one-dimensional movement made them much easier targets than the mole crickets.There were twenty magic bullets loaded.It was simple. I just had to look where I was shooting and pull the trigger. The added luck was the icing on the cake.Magic bullets silently cut through the air, leaving behind a blue trace. One bullet for one target. The clip was emptied in an instant, but unloading and reloading were also instantaneous.I shot another twenty bullets, then another twenty.After I shot 60 bullets nonstop, the world returned to normal.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dThe creatures covering the sun disappeared without leaving behind a trace. The sudden change made Yoo Yeonha and the others confused.\u201cC-Come on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dQuickly snapping out of her daze, Yoo Yeonha rebuked Hazuki and Jin Hoseung. Only then did the two warriors begin to run at the main body. Yoo Yeonha\u2019s long whip shot out and grabbed onto the giant octopus\u2019s hump.The moment her elegant whip crushed the octopus\u2019s hump, a mole cricket shot out from the groundKieeek\u2014Crying voraciously, the mole cricket jumped on Yoo Yeonha. I fired the last bullet I had in my barrel. Hitting the mole cricket on the mark, the magic bullet detonated inside and splashed the mole cricket\u2019s blood and mucus on Yoo Yeonha.Before she was covered in goo, Yoo Yeonha calmly spread out her magic power. The mucus from the mole cricket fell down after hitting this barrier.\u201cUk\u2026\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t block everything. Yoo Yeonha gave me a deathly glare, but she knew now wasn\u2019t the time to complain. She shot out whip towards the octopus once again.A beast-like whip then joined the sword and axe\u2019s dance with tentacles.**Case closed. Time elapsed: 9 minutes 40 seconds.Yoo Yeonha had brilliantly cut off four of the eight tentacles. All that while standing next to me and not moving more than a foot. She had thoroughly fulfilled her two duties \u2014 supporting the warriors and protecting the sharpshooter.\u201c\u2026\u201dNow that the battle was over, Yoo Yeonha had her eyes closed shut.Around her ankles and snow-white collarbone were the mole cricket\u2019s dried blood and mucus. After letting out a sigh, she took out a handkerchief from her pocket and wiped them off.Then, she turned towards me.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dHer eyes were smiling, but it didn\u2019t seem so friendly. I met her eyes without being able to answer. The anger hidden in her eyes were like blades. Yoo Yeonha was a fearsome woman. More so than anything else, she hated her body and clothes getting dirty.\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to bother. I can take care of a mole cricket just fine. Much cleanly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause of you, my clothes ended up getting dirty.\u201dAt that moment, two insensitive warriors approached me.\u201cWhew, that was swift thanks to you. I saw it. You killed the baby octopuses, right? Guns have their advantage, huh.\u201d\u201cThat was amazing!\u201dIt was Jin Hoseung and Hazuki, who were covered in blood and ink.Seemingly afraid to get her clothes dirty, Yoo Yeonha slowly stepped away.**[Team 5 \u2014 Total time: 58 minutes 58 seconds. 16/100]16th out of 100 teams.Though she finished in the upper half of the teams, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t be said to be good.But since grades were based on individual performance filmed through drones, she didn\u2019t mind too much. Understandably, Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak\u2019s teams took first and second place respectively. But she was bitter that Chae Nayun\u2019s team came in higher.\u201cDrones filmed everything. They\u2019ll be sent to your smartwatches, so why you were quick or slow to hunt your monster, your team\u2019s compatibility with the monster, and how you could improve for next time. It\u2019ll be part of your grades.\u201dKim Soohyuk gave a long-winded statement. Yoo Yeonha slightly turned her head and looked behind her. A dull looking man was yawning in a daze.It was entirely his fault that her team came in late. Because he lacked stamina, they couldn\u2019t reach the monster quickly. What should have taken just 10 minutes ended up taking 50 minutes.But it was also thanks to him that they managed to end up 16th. His quick bullet serenade eliminated all the baby octopuses in 3 seconds. Since Yoo Yeonha was prepared to scuffle with them for 15 minutes, it could be said that he played a big role.But of course, she still played the biggest role as she was the one who crushed the main body\u2019s hump.\u201c\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha held back her impulse to blame someone. But that only increased the unreasonable sense of jealousy and envy she felt towards Chae Nayun. She faced forward and glared at Chae Nayun\u2019s head. If she wouldn\u2019t be found out, she wanted to smack the back of her head.Yoo Yeonha\u2019s hands trembled, reaching towards Chae Nayun\u2019s head.But instead of taking such extreme action, she lightly touched Chae Nayun\u2019s shoulder.\u201cNayun, how was it?\u201d\u201cHm? Ah, it\u2019s as you see. 4th place. What a shame. I wanted to beat Shin Jonghak and Rachel. What about you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 16th.\u201d\u201cOh? Wow, you got 16th with that gun using sharpshooter?\u201d\u201cWe got the black hump octopus. We just had to remove the hump.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you did, right?\u201dYoo Yeonha nodded with a bright smile.\u201cYep.\u201d**Late at night, after the end of regular classes, I was working out in the training room.Because I just came back from running, I felt like I was dying. But it was something I needed to do, I focused on working out for 3 hours. Thankfully, the training equipment wasn\u2019t too different from Earth\u2019s. It was only that the weights were heavier. For example, the leg extension machine went from 15 kg to 500 kg.\u201cUgh.\u201dAfter completing my workout, I fumbled back to the dressing room like a zombie and collapsed on the seat. After collecting my breath for five minutes, I took out my laptop and a fatigue recovery drink from my bag.First, I checked today\u2019s results with the laptop.[Luck applies! As the enemy is only a low-rank monster, your accuracy increases greatly!][All attacks hit their mark! Your Gift\u2019s proficiency increases by 20%!][Perception increases by 0.03.][Luck applies! Your eyes and ears seem to work better!][You gain 27 SP.]As expected, I seemed to have gotten lucky with the accuracy I showed during today\u2019s combat training. And thanks to standing out to Yoo Yeonha, I gained some SP too.[Through working out, your strength increases by 0.02.][Through working out, your stamina increases by 0.02.][Through working out, your vitality increases by 0.02.][Mana mysteriously melts into your torn muscle fibers! Your strength, stamina, and vitality increase by 0.03!]The amount of stats I got from working out was more than I expected. Something like this would have been impossible on Earth. Enlightenment and luck must have played a part.But with the sharp pain all over my body, I wasn\u2019t sure I could even get up tomorrow.Of course, I already had a solution in mind.===[Fatigue Recovery Drink]\u2014Restores the body from fatigue. Contains a tiny amount of temperate mana.*Current SP: 36===This was a fatigue recovery drink provided by Cube.I planned on modifying its effect.Of course, something like \u2018completely restores the body from fatigue\u2019 was unlikely to work. Even if it did, it would be a waste to use up all my SP. But with the right amount of restrictions, I could come up with a decent product.I added one line to the fatigue recovery drink\u2019s description.\u2014If \u2018Kim Hajin\u2019 goes to sleep within 2 hours of use, he will slowly recover from physical fatigue over the course of 8 hours.I put in four restrictions.Only Kim Hajin.Sleeping within 2 hours of use.Physical fatigue only.Non-instantaneous recovery, but slowly over the course of 8 hours.[You can save the modified setting using 0.5 SP.]Because the drink already had a similar effect, the amount of SP required was exactly the amount I gained from working out. After saving the modified effect, I gulped down the drink.\u201cBulp.\u201dNow, I had to go back and sleep.Otherwise, the drink would have been a waste.\u201cAgh, my joints.\u201dI staggered forward like a zombie.**At the same hour, Yoo Yeonha was analyzing the video from the day\u2019s combat training. With several drones filming each team, she could see the battle from multiple angles.\u201c\u2026 At least he\u2019s quick.\u201dThe more she saw it, the more curious she got.The black hump octopus fired a total of 59 babies. But before they could even touch the ground, they were eliminated by the sharpshooter\u2019s bullets. Black hump octopuses usually reabsorbed the babies they shot out to recover their energy. Then, they\u2019d shoot more out from their hump. Because of this annoying trait, Yoo Yeonha was ready for a drawn-out battle, but the actual fight had ended in just 10 minutes.\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing him in Agent Military Academy.\u201dThe more she thought about it, the stranger this sharpshooter seemed. His stamina was abnormally lower than other cadets, and he had also suddenly changed his weapon\u2026That was as far as Yoo Yeonha got on her notes about Kim Hajin.She received a sudden message.[What\u2019s up?]It was Shin Jonghak. With a grin, Yoo Yeonha tapped on the hologram keyboard.[Analyzing the video from today~][Why are you doing that now?][I\u2019m going to inherit a guild in the future, so I have to look for promising talents.][There are none in your team. They\u2019re all trash.]Yoo Yeonha snickered. He was right, but also arrogant. If it was anyone other than Shin Jonghak, she would\u2019ve found such behavior detestable. But just the fact that he was \u2018Shin Jonghak\u2019 turned his arrogance and impertinence into chicness. It wasn\u2019t a logical explanation, but the reason Yoo Yeonha liked Shin Jonghak was far from logical in the first place.[How\u2019s that gun shooting guy?]\u201cHaha.\u201dSo he was curious after all.He had a pretty cute side to him as well.[He\u2019s okay. He did a man\u2019s worth of work. Exactly what you\u2019d expect from rank 934.]2.78 seconds. In that short amount of time, that man had shot 60 bullets and hit 59. Yoo Yeonha made a pulling motion with her index finger. Was it possible to pull the trigger 20 times in a second? Or did that handgun have an automatic firing button?Ding dong\u2014In the middle of her thinking, the bell rang.[Ah, my room service is here.]Yoo Yeonha hopped towards the door.Opening the door, she saw her neatly dressed butler waiting in front. She was happy to see the butler her father picked out for her.\u201cThank you, Sechan-ssi.\u201dThe butler bowed respectfully.Yoo Yeonha took her food and came back to her seat.[I\u2019m back. Were you waiting?]Yoo Yeonha opened the dome-shaped lid on her elegant silver platter.[No.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn it were plain food. A patty between two buns, the iconic symbol of commoners. On the side were french fries and a bottle of coke.It was a hamburger set.First, she munched on a fry.[What did you order?]Shin Jonghak asked just at the right time.Yoo Yeonha replied casually.[Just the usual. A little bit of foie gras entier.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Within Everyday Life (1)Wednesday\u2019s first class, \u2018anti-personnel training.\u2019This two-hour-long class simply had two cadets form a pair and spar each other. Spars were done with training weapons, making the fight less painful and easier to grade. In this class, Kim Suho paired with Yi Yeonghan, and Shin Jonghak paired with Kim Horak.\u201cUwoooh.\u201d\u201cRank 934 Kim Hajin, get up!\u201d\u201cI, I can\u2019t.\u201dAs for me, I was scuffling with the anti-personnel combat instructor rather than a cadet.It was because there wasn\u2019t a gun for training. Since a real gun couldn\u2019t be used in sparring for fear of unintentional injuries, I was stuck fighting the instructor.\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t!?\u201dThe female instructor ordered me to give my all.Exactly one minute later, it was the instructor who was giving her all. It seemed my \u2018Gift\u2019 was more threatening than she had anticipated.\u201cGet up!\u201dSeeing my bullet slightly scratch her forearm, she got angry and grabbed me by the collar.Now that things had come to this, I regretted spending my first two weeks in this world loafing around. I should\u2019ve spent the time working out.\u201cI can\u2019t continue.\u201d\u201cYes, you can!\u201d\u201cMy body won\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cIt will!\u201dThe instructor forcefully pulled me up.\u201cPut up your guard and do something!\u201dShe was telling me to do something, but the handgun in my hand felt heavy. I pulled the trigger half-heartedly. The instructor blocked the bullet with her hand. Then, she tackled me. Unable to resist, I stumbled and fell. An electrifying feeling coursed through my body.\u201cI give up, I give up.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t move after shooting. I said do something!\u201dChak! She slapped my face.\u201cGET UP!\u201dChak! I was starting to get annoyed. Come to think of it, isn\u2019t this woman younger than me?\u201cI said, GET UP!\u201dI refused to take it a third time. I grabbed her arm just barely, then\u2026\u201cYou fucker.\u201dI bit the instructor\u2019s hair with my teeth.\u201cAh! What are you doing!? 934\u2026 Ak! Let go! Let go! Let go!\u201dGnashing on her hair, I pulled back as though my life depended on it.My strange actions turned the surroundings silent, but I didn\u2019t have the time to pay attention to something like that.\u201cT-This is a warning! Let go! I said, LET GO!\u201dThis hair, I\u2019ll bite it off. I swear I\u2019ll bite it off.\u201cY-You\u2026!\u201dI could see the instructor\u2019s fist in front of my eyes.I had no memories of what happened next.But since I managed to gain 40 SP out of it, it didn\u2019t feel like such a bad trade.**Cube had \u2018clubs\u2019.The head instructor Kim Soohyuk told us we wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy our youths, but I didn\u2019t set Cube to be such a horrible place. While it was normal to be covered in monsters\u2019 blood or to kill Djinns from time to time, Cube encouraged cadets to enjoy their hobbies for their mental health. Being in a relationship was technically prohibited, but it was tacitly allowed by all of the faculty.Cube\u2019s clubs were no different than college circles. Club promotions happened in the second week after first-year cadets came in.I set the number of clubs in my novel to be about a hundred, but considering there were only 5000 cadets in the whole school, it might not have been the most realistic. In any case, there was a club for pretty much any topic. There were hobby-like clubs like bowling, pool, and VR, while there were also academic clubs like studying, martial arts, and training.I planned to join more than one club.Obviously, the purpose to stay close to the main characters.I already knew who was in which club.Kim Suho and Yi Yeonghan were in traveling, Chae Nayun was in traveling and hunting, Yoo Yeonha was in traveling and academics, Shin Jonghak wasn\u2019t in any, and Rachel was in reading.Clearly, traveling club was an obvious choice. Next, I had to choose from the hunting club, reading club, and the academics club.As students could join multiple clubs, I could join all four if I wanted to.But that was too difficult realistically. I only had one body to work with.Among these, the easiest club to gain SP from seemed to be the academic club. And of the academic clubs, the academic circle called Veritas had an antagonist that played an important role early in the story.\u201cVR club, Folklore Village\u2026 Interesting.\u201dSuddenly, I got a strange feeling.Sitting on a bench in Cube\u2019s Hero Park, I looked around. Likely because all classes had ended, the park was bustling with people.It all felt too mysterious. The setting I had scribbled down had taken a life of its own, filling up missing holes and creating this world. There were many things that were new to me. The VR club I mentioned was one of them, and so was that couple secretly making out behind the bushes.\u201cEhew, that\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201dSeeing them starting to get touchy, I got up with a frown.Afterward, I ran around busily, collecting club application forms from the park. Four forms. I didn\u2019t get a favorable look when I received them, but I had succeeded nonetheless.\u201cI\u2019ll need to join the traveling club for sure.\u201dFour leading characters were in the traveling club. It was the result of me wanting to tie them together for major and minor events.But compared to the club\u2019s importance in the storyline, it wasn\u2019t popular among students. It only had 20 people from all three grades, and third years were mostly busy interviewing with guilds and internship missions. Realistically, the club only had about 14 people.I couldn\u2019t explain why. That was just how I set it because having more people seemed troublesome.In any case, traveling club was confirmed. After thinking about the others, I decided to join just two more. Setting the reading club aside, I chose the hunting club and the academics club.Clubs began after all classes ended, and these three clubs didn\u2019t overlap at all. The academic club met on Tuesdays, hunting on Thursdays, and traveling was either Saturday or Sunday.Rachel ended up being left out, but she was an untouchable existence for now anyways.\u201cOkay.\u201dThwack.After flicking the application papers with my fingers, I stood up. Now, it was time to receive even more obscure gazes from club leaders.**The capital of Korea, Seoul, was filled with guilds that vied for the world\u2019s top position. Distinguished guilds such as \u2018Essence of the Strait\u2019, \u2018Desolate Moon\u2019, and \u2018Frost Sanctuary\u2019 were located in the collectively established guild district in Seoul, making it the center for Djinn and monster subjugation requests, technological advances, and businesses.\u201cThe guild visit is set for the Friday two weeks later.\u201dSeoul\u2019s guild district was filled with skyscrapers. But one especially brilliant building wasn\u2019t so tall. The geometric design of this building grabbed any passerby\u2019s attention. It was the building belonging to the guild \u2018Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace\u2019.With cutting-edge magic engineering technology, the inside of the building was twice as large as it looked from the outside, while its mana density was always maintained above grade 3.\u201cMm, understood.\u201dIn this environment optimal for even Heroes, the vice-leader Yun Seung-Ah took her secretary\u2019s report.Currently, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s attention was solely devoted to finding \u2018promising talents\u2019.It was a widely acknowledged fact that Cube\u2019s freshman this year were exceptional. It was said that some had Gifts that could alter the guilds\u2019 rankings. If she were to let her competitors steal them, the first place position she\u2019d worked so hard to get would be jeopardized.Consequently, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s eyes were glued to the guild\u2019s intranet database, which contained videos from Cube\u2019s 1st combat training.\u201cKim Suho really is something.\u201dCurrently on her screen was the combat training\u2019s 1st place finisher, Kim Suho.Fighting against a monster, his sword qi stood sharply. But his sword qi wasn\u2019t the only awe-striking scene. His sword\u2019s fluid movements made it look like his sword was water. His swordsmanship didn\u2019t resemble anyone else\u2019s, almost like a formless sword technique. With this technique, he seemed to tear apart space along with his target monster.\u201cYes, he doesn\u2019t seem close to any guilds either. He is first on our priority.\u201d\u201cI want to bring him in no matter what\u2026 Oh? Someone\u2019s using a gun?\u201dKim Suho\u2019s video ended, and Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s eyes scanning the remaining list shined in curiosity.\u201cYes. There were talks about it in the guild community.\u201d\u201cWas there? Sorry, I\u2019ve been too busy lately.\u201d\u201cIt was uploaded from the Cube community. He was in Yoo Yeonha\u2019s team, which was why it gathered so many views in the first place. According to inside information, he\u2019s quite the strange one.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 strange one, huh?\u201dCurious about this unique individual, Yun Seung-Ah played the video.[Team 5][Jin Hoseung, Hazuki, Yoo Yeonha, Kim Hajin]Though not to the point of awe, the 10-minute video most certainly drew her attention.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t using an automatic rifle and still managed to fire 60 shots in 2.78 seconds?\u201dIt was physically impossible. Even if you were quick enough to pull the trigger 60 times, the gun wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it. In other words, a trans-physical power was at play.\u201cYes. It seems he changed his weapon from a sword to a gun as soon as he entered Cube.\u201d\u201c\u2026Enlightenment.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201dEnlightenment at just 17 years old\u2026 Leaning back, Yun Seung-Ah fell in deep contemplation.Changing one\u2019s weapon after going through enlightenment.Though rare, it happened.Gifts presented cadets with individuality, but before enlightenment, it was impossible to know exactly what one\u2019s Gift was. In cases like this, where one has to change to an unfamiliar weapon, one needed three years to catch back up.This was also why Cube\u2019s lower academy, the Agent Military Academy, encouraged cadets to use a variety of weapons. Knowing how to wield several weapons made it easier to transition from one weapon to another weapon should it be necessary.\u201cHe experienced enlightenment early, but if using a gun is all his Gift can do, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s too desirable.\u201d\u201cRight, if his Gift could be used with a bow, he would have chosen a bow.\u201dYun Seung-Ah agreed, but being enlightened at the age of 17 was still a rare occurrence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe should at least keep an eye on him. Is there a free recruiter?\u201d\u201cNo. Because of how exceptional this year\u2019s cadets are, everyone is at their limit.\u201dYun Seung-Ah hesitated. Nowadays, recruiters were expensive. Even if she hired a new recruiter, without attachment to the guild, they could simply run away to another guild with the guild\u2019s information.\u201c\u2026Then let him be. If he really is special, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll stand out again.\u201dAt that decision, her secretary nodded without objection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Within Everyday Life (2)I needed to make money. It wasn\u2019t a hopeful wish, but a necessity. When I looked at the bill that came to my room, I almost lost consciousness. I had a 300 million won debt. In other words, I had taken out all the loan a Cube cadet could get. It had to be Chundong\u2019s doing.The loan only had a low 1% yearly interest, but as I wasn\u2019t making any money, I was simply losing money. Unfortunately, the bank account Chundong left behind only contained 3 million won. It was nowhere near the amount needed to live in this world, where power and money was everything.Thankfully, there were multiple ways I could become rich.First was the stock market. Towers and Dungeons were constantly being created in the world. I knew the names of guilds that would discover or conquer them. Guilds in this world were treated like companies, so one could buy stocks of public guilds from the guild stock market.Today was March 2nd, 2025. My settings book should be full of juicy information.I opened my laptop.\u25b7Settings List[March 15th, 2025. Newly found guild, \u2018Packhorse Master,\u2019 goes public. July 4th, 2025, they conquer the Dungeon, \u2018Suwon Royal Devil\u2019s Nest.]In reality, the Packhorse Master guild was established by Djinns. Because they would play an important role in the story, I made sure to note them down in the settings book. Conquering Suwon Royal Devil\u2019s Nest would skyrocket their stock prices by a 1000%. It wouldn\u2019t be until three years later when they were discovered that they would be delisted.[December 8th, 2025. Guild, \u2018Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace,\u2019 announces its plan to conquer \u2018Tower of Miracle.\u2019]This incident would become the lowest point for the currently ranked 1 Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace. It was also the decisive event that made Yun Seung-Ah become its leader. This plan, which Yun Seung-Ah opposed, would bring their rank down to 7.I had two opportunities to make money with this incident.First was before the plan is announced, and second was before the plan failed.Without having to know much information, with just these two \u2014 though, these two were the only early financial incidents written down in the settings book \u2014 I could make a fortune.\u201cThe problem is\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have any money to work with.\u201cDo I need to go out to the Field?\u201dField referred to danger zones where monsters appeared. Unlike Towers and Dungeons, the danger level of Fields was vastly dependent on their grade, so one didn\u2019t need permits to enter the less dangerous ones.I should be able to enter the Field in Gangwondo.\u201cWait.\u201dI remembered something about Gangwondo. There was a setting I arranged in Gangwondo. I wonder what it was.Using CTRL+F, I searched for a specific word.[Year 2026. Djinn, Tomer, discovers Aether from Gangwondo\u2019s Gari Mountain Dungeon.]Found it. Mystic grade formless weapon, Aether.I wanted to take it for myself, but without Aether, Tomer would be left without a weapon. Not to mention, Tomer was an important antagonist in the story.Of course, without a weapon, the story would become easier. But if I took Aether just for that reason, it might impact the future in an unknown way. I was afraid of that uncertainty\u2026\u201cWell, whatever.\u201dTomer was strong even without Aether. Once all of my stats grew to about 3 or 4, I should go take Aether.Wiing\u2014At that moment, I felt a vibration on my wrist. It was a message.[Traveling Club Announcement]\u2014There will be a short trip on Sunday to serve as a freshman orientation.\u201c\u2026 Oh right.\u201dThat was a thing. Immediately after I recalled information about the traveling club, the smartwatch vibrated once more.[Academic Club Announcement]\u2014There will be an orientation on Friday for the freshmen.\u201cAnd there was this too. So annoying.\u201dI thought I could rest a bit in the weekend, but there were clubs over the weekend. Not to mention, the academic club was tomorrow.**Cube\u2019s combat training was on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. As such, I should have been able to relax on Mondays and Fridays, but on this precious Friday, I was walking towards a certain clubroom. Some distance ahead, Yoo Yeonha was showing off her elegant stride.Academic club\u2019s clubroom was room 304.When I entered, I saw many first years as I expected. There were about 30, and 23 of them were girls. Most should have been bewitched by the club president.After sneaking a look around the clubroom, I turned towards Yoo Yeonha\u2019s direction and sat behind her. I could smell a flowery scent from her hair. After unavoidably smelling this scent for five minutes\u2026The club president finally showed up.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Yun Hyuk. Welcome to our academic club, Veritas.\u201dThe club president was \u2018Yun Hyuk\u2019, a third year.I didn\u2019t enter this club just for Yoo Yeonha.Yun Hyuk was a Djinn. Soon, several incidents would happen in Cube, including a monster invasion. Yun Hyuk would be the mastermind behind it.Of course, I had no reason to trouble myself by shouting, \u2018That guy is a Djinn\u2014!\u2019Though, that would probably give me a decent amount of SP.In any case, Yun Hyuk was contracted to the Devil of Enchantment, Lilith. In exchange for selling his soul to the devil, he obtained a beautiful appearance and an ability called \u2018Enchantment\u2019. Currently, he should have his eyes out for Yoo Yeonha. That was the reason why Lilith gave him a high-rank ability like Enchantment.\u201cSince today\u2019s just the orientation, we\u2019ll only briefly discuss what our club is about.\u201dHearing his charming voice, the eyes of the female cadets were already shining.\u201cIn Veritas, we research and discuss classification, weaknesses, behaviors, and attributes of monsters. Topics include monster classification, how they behave, where their vital points are, what their attribute is, and how to deal with them efficiently.\u201dWhat Yun Hyuk mentioned was an important topic in modern society. \u2018Monster analysis\u2019 was one of the most competitive college majors, and there were even non-combatant Heroes who emphasized researching monsters. These Heroes, who didn\u2019t have the Gift for combat, were still treated as Heroes because they had Gifts that aided in trans-human knowledge.\u201cI\u2019ll give a quick example. Let\u2019s take a look at this monster. As I\u2019m sure you know, it is a totem scallop.\u201dA hologram image popped up. Just like its name suggested, the totem scallop was a scallop that produced a totem. Having high intelligence and capable of using magic, totem scallops were high-intermediate rank grade 3 monsters. Thankfully, they were gentle natured and didn\u2019t attack as long as one stayed out of their territory.But just like pearls produced by ordinary scallops, the totem scallops\u2019 totems had an incredible value, making them the target of guilds everywhere.\u201cAs you know, totem scallops are extremely hard to kill. But careful analysis shows that they\u2019re classified no differently than an ordinary scallop. But because no other monsters share similarities with them, it is hard to guess where their vital point is.\u201dYun Hyuk\u2019s explanation continued. But because it was everything I already knew, I couldn\u2019t help but yawn.\u201cHuaaaam\u2026\u201dImmediately, Yun Hyuk\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, and other female cadets sent me attacking glares. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they attacked me for real if I yawned one more time. Only Yoo Yeonha kept her eyes on the screen.\u201cKuhum.\u201dYun Hyuk let out a dry cough before continuing his explanation.\u201cBecause of its ambiguous attribute and behavior, the totem scallop\u2019s vital point hasn\u2019t been discovered. But for other monsters like the \u2018Thousand-Mile Horse\u2019\u2026\u201d**The orientation ended 40 minutes later. This time, I got up yawning inwardly as I didn\u2019t want to get attacked.I was about to leave when I saw Yun Hyuk approaching Yoo Yeonha. I paused.\u201cYeonha cadet-nim.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou forgot this.\u201dYun Hyuk handed Yoo Yeonha a paper she left behind. This wasn\u2019t something I wrote in my novel, so I didn\u2019t know much about the paper. But I knew he was scheming somehow. Rather than Yoo Yeonha forgetting the paper, Yun Hyuk probably pulled it out with his magic power.\u201cAh, yes, thank you.\u201dYoo Yeonha took the paper with a smile. That seemed to be the end of their encounter.After leaving the clubroom, I went to a nearby vending machine and pulled out a Coke and a Sprite. Looking at their names, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. I named them Coin Cola and Spring Sprite to avoid trademark problems, and that was exactly how the names appeared on the cans.Meanwhile, Yoo Yeonha left the clubroom.With the Coke and Sprite cans in hand, I stood in front of her as though to block her path. Then, I handed the Coke to her.\u201cHere.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s face was full of question marks.\u201cI\u2019m in the same club. Same team and now the same club. Funny coincidence, right?\u201dThis was a test. Even working out as though my life depended on it only gave me 4 SP. Then how much SP could I get by talking to a leading character?\u201c\u2026Do you think I\u2019ll drink something like this?\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and her lips protruded out as though she was furious. But since it was the reaction I expected, I hit it off casually.\u201cI just got it from the vending machine.\u201dYoo Yeonha was likely attracted to bad boys. Of course, being \u2018handsome\u2019 was a requirement as well.\u201cTouch it. It\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. You can have it. Also\u2026\u201dI could feel hostility from the glare she gave me. But that was as much of her true feelings the false mask she wore revealed.\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me so casually. This is the first warning.\u201dThat was it. Yoo Yeonha walked past me without waiting for my reply. Seeing her perfect figure walking away, I popped the Sprite can open.Psssh\u2014 Gulp, gulp.Yoo Yeonha\u2019s shoulders twitched at the sound. According to my setting, Yoo Yeonha loved unhealthy food like carbonated drinks, hamburgers, fried chicken, and ramen. But she couldn\u2019t buy them to save face, so she made her trusted butler or attendant buy it for her. Even then, she could only enjoy it once a week.The reason was simple. Not only did she hate showing such side of her to others, but her mother also detested unhealthy commoner food.To make up for the pitiful setting I gave her, I threw the Coke can into her luxurious brand bag. Drawing a clean arc, the Coke can landed inside.\u201cCarry me next time too.\u201dAt these words, Yoo Yeonha glanced back. Then, she walked away muttering quietly to herself. However, I could hear her voice just fine.\u2014Who is this crazy guy?*Yoo Yeonha\u2019s keen senses soon noticed the slight change in her bag. The water from the Coke can\u2019s surface was making the textbook in her bag wet.\u201c\u2026That nutjob.\u201dYoo Yeonha took out the Coke can with a frown.Just when did he put it in? That little rat.\u201cHuu.\u201dAfter a deep sigh, Yoo Yeonha released her magic power. Seeping into the paper, her magic power separated the moisture from the textbook and sent it into the air. When she retracted her magic power, the collected moisture fell down to the ground.\u201cEhew.\u201dWith a sigh, Yoo Yeonha broke out in a cold sweat. At the same time, she felt proud. The application of magic power she just showed was hard for even Heroes to accomplish. It was seemingly simple but was actually a mysterious and highly difficult technique.\u201cWhen I see him again\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the sense of pride came anger. Yoo Yeonha thought as she twisted her lips, \u2018That talkative bum, I\u2019ll need to ask the guys to educate him\u2026\u2019But that thought only lasted for a moment. Fiddling with the Coke can in her bag, she looked around. There was no one nearby.Kuhum. With a dry cough, she took out a handkerchief from her pocket and wrapped the Coke can with it before putting it back in the bag.\u201cHmm.\u201dThen, as if nothing happened, she quickened her pace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Change (1)After spending the rest of Friday working out and training, it became Saturday before I noticed.[Traveling Club Announcement]\u2014There will be a short trip on Sunday to serve as a freshman orientation.The traveling club\u2019s orientation was today. The meeting place was \u2018Cube Portal Station\u2019, which connected Cube to Seoul.After stuffing my gun in my cross bag, I walked to the meeting place. Many of the leading characters \u2014 namely Kim Suho, Yi Yeonghan, Chae Nayun, and Yoo Yeonha \u2014 were already present.They seemed completely oblivious to my existence, but being with them still made me nervous. Today in Seoul, an unexpected incident would occur. This would be the story\u2019s first major incident.While I was organizing today\u2019s impending incident in my head, the club president arrived.\u201cHello, I\u2019m the club president, Oh Hanhyun. I didn\u2019t believe it when I saw so many club applications, but\u2026 it\u2019s real. Who knew such amazing cadets would join my club?\u201dWith his average height and gentle first impression, Oh Hanhyun looked around the club members while scratching his neck.\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll give a short introduction about the traveling club.\u201dWith a bashful smile, he took out a piece of paper from his pocket. It looked like he had a speech prepared. I described Oh Hanhyun as a timid person, so I wasn\u2019t too surprised with his actions.\u201cKuhum. Once or twice a month, we will leave Cube to travel. The purpose of the travel is to relax. So training during trips will be strictly forbidden. It\u2019s also why our club is called \u2018Healing Rain.\u2019\u201dKuhum. After clearing his throat once more, he put the paper away. What, that was it?\u201cToday, as part of the orientation, we\u2019ll take a short trip to Seoul.\u201dFrom here was what I wrote. The club members would form 2-people groups and go to Seoul.\u201cWe\u2019ll have a theme for each trip. Since today\u2019s meant to be an orientation, we\u2019ll just have a free trip without anything complicated. But instead of traveling alone, we\u2019ll split into groups of two.\u201dHere, Kim Suho would be paired with Chae Nayun and run into trouble while they were looking around a museum. As for that trouble, I would be able to experience it soon.\u201cThen we\u2019ll start by drawing lots.\u201dDrawing lots was completely based on luck, but I could choose my fate. Thanks to my Gift, \u2018Observation and Reading,\u2019 I could see the content of the lots clearly. With my hand on my chin, I fell in thought. Should I choose Kim Suho? Or Chae Nayun?\u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201dAt that moment, Yoo Yeonha stepped up. I watched her pull out a name without much thought. In the next instant, I realized I overlooked one vital information. It was the oddity known as Kim Hajin.The lot drawn by Yoo Yeonha had the following name.\u201cKim Hajin.\u201dMy heart dropped immediately. But there was no change in Yoo Yeonha\u2019s facial expression.With her usual mask in place, she stared at me with calm eyes.**Thankfully, everything else had remained unchanged. Kim Suho became pairs with Chae Nayun, and Yi Yeonghan became pairs with the club president.After drawing lots was over, the members gathered by their pairs and stood in front of the Portal.Portal, the cutting-edge technology utilizing magic science and engineering. With a height of 15 meters and width of 30 meters, this giant gate was built in over a hundred places throughout Korea. With it, going from Seoul to Busan took less than 3 seconds.\u201cCadet Kim Ha Jin. Confirmed.\u201dThe Portal operator gave us a seal. This seal would resonate with the Portal and take us to Seoul.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe club president went in first. The next to enter the swaying blue Portal was Kim Suho, Yi Yeonghan, Chae Nayun\u2026 and finally me.A strange feeling enveloped my body, but only for a moment.In the blink of an eye, the surrounding scenery changed to an unfamiliar place. A futuristic mixture of blue and grey, it had to be Seoul Portal Station. With just two steps, I had crossed the East Sea.\u201cIt\u2019s 12 P.M. right now, so we\u2019ll meet back here at 6.\u201dBecause the Portal we were at was connected to Cube, there wasn\u2019t anyone around. But the Portal next doors connecting Seoul to Busan should be crowded with people. After all, they were both global cities.\u201cFor now, follow me.\u201dFollowing the club president, we received another seal from the Portal employees before leaving the Portal Station.After coming outside, I could immediately see the words, \u2018Yongsan Station.\u2019\u201cYou can go wherever you want as a pair using the public transportation system. For today, we won\u2019t require you to write a report, but make sure you\u2019re back by 6. If you\u2019re late, you\u2019ll be penalized.\u201dWith a warning from the club president, cadets left as pairs.Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t say anything to me, but I followed behind her for now.When I was checking out how Yongsan Station changed from what I knew, Yoo Yeonha suddenly came to a stop. After quickly turning around, she blurted out sharply.\u201cLet\u2019s split up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm? Oh, yeah, sure.\u201dYoo Yeonha most likely planned to visit the guild her father ran. I was fine with it. I planned to join Kim Suho no matter what Yoo Yeonha did.\u201cAgain.\u201dBut as though I ticked her off again, she glared at me with her hand on her hip.\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me so casually.\u201d[1]\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThis is the second warning. There won\u2019t be a third time.\u201dI knew that she wasn\u2019t bluffing. If I did it a third time, she might really get back at me in an unthinkable way.\u201cYes, I understand. I apologize.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Tsk.\u201dYoung lady Yoo Yeonha then walked away without a goodbye. It was clear how much she disliked me.Thus, Yoo Yeonha and I split up after just 5 minutes of arriving in Seoul.**\u201cWhew, I thought I was lost.\u201dAfter switching buses three times, I finally arrived at the National Weapons Museum. Replicas of weapons excavated by Korea were displayed in this museum.Today, an incident would occur here. With a trembling heart, I walked in.\u2014Daddy, what\u2019s that?\u2014Oh, that\u2019s the Four Tiger Sword\u2026Perhaps because it was a weekend, the museum was bustling with parents and children who hoped to become Heroes.But no matter the size of a crowd, there was bound to be people who stood out. Chae Nayun and Kim Suho were such examples, but I could only see Chae Nayun for now.\u201c\u2026I want it.\u201dSmacking her lips, she was eyeing a bow in a glass display.But my target today wasn\u2019t Chae Nayun. Looking around, I began to look for someone. It didn\u2019t take long. The main character\u2019s tall and handsome features easily stood out.Approaching him furtively, I scanned the weapon Kim Suho was looking. Thankfully, it was a weapon I knew.\u201cIs this the famous Seven-Branched Sword?\u201dBefore the Korean Peninsula was yet unified, the king of Baekje, the then most powerful kingdom, had bestowed this iron sword to the Japanese emperor. It was a historical weapon said to have been found in the final room of the Wiryeseong Dungeon.[2]\u201cHm? Ah\u2026\u201dKim Suho\u2019s sight turned to me from the Seven-Branched Sword. However, it seemed he was at a loss for words. I had a good idea why.\u201cKim Hajin.\u201d\u201cAh, right. Sorry, I didn\u2019t expect to meet you here, so I forgot.\u201dWith a kind smile, he pointed at another section of the museum.\u201cApparently, the rifle Napoleon used is here. Have you seen it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Napoleon\u2019s rifle?\u201d\u201cYep. Apparently, it was a reward from a Dungeon in France.\u201dAccording to my world setting, any weapon used by a legendary figure could become an artifact. Since that was the case, it wasn\u2019t weird for there to be Napoleon\u2019s rifle, even though I didn\u2019t mention it in my novel.Though I did want a rare weapon, I wasn\u2019t really interested in a replica.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have time.\u201dI unintentionally answered without zeal.I felt strange talking to the main character I wrote. I wasn\u2019t sure how to describe this feeling, but it definitely wasn\u2019t pleasant.Kim Suho was handsome, exceptional in martial arts, and had a fantastic personality. He was too perfect, so he felt inhumane. That was why some readers rooted for Shin Jonghak.Anyways, it should be about time.I tapped on the ground with my sneakers.\u201cThen\u2026\u201dRight when Kim Suho was saying something\u2026\u2014BOOM!A thunderous sound reverberated through the museum. In an instant, everyone became silent.Koong. Koong. Koong.\u00a0Repeated thuds pulsed through the deathly silence.The sound resembling the footsteps of a giant creature soon led to the sound of something breaking. The atmosphere in the museum took a quick turn.\u201cKyaaaak!\u201d\u201cWhat is that!?\u201dThe unknown led to anxiety, and anxiety quickly led to panic. Ordinary visitors screamed and began to run. However, only death was waiting outside. The safest place was the museum\u2019s inside.\u201cStay here! Don\u2019t go out!\u201dKnowing that it would be dangerous outside, Kim Suho shouted.Currently, the outside of the museum was being attacked by an intermediate rank monster and its subordinates.Just a single intermediate rank monster posed little threat. A Hero would arrive in less than a minute, and 20 minutes was enough to take care of the entire situation.But that wasn\u2019t the only problem.Djinn.There was a Djinn here. Simply put, it was a double-pronged attack. After coming to a scene, Heroes went to the most dangerous area. Since the museum had security guards, it was less dangerous comparatively, putting it on a lower priority. Taking advantage of this fact, the Djinn Association dispatched an assassin to target a child considered by the Hero Association to have a special Gift.Clang\u2014A sharp sound resounded. It was the sound of glasses shattering. The source of the sound wasn\u2019t far away. Turning towards the direction of the sound, Kim Suho shouted.\u201cChae Nayun!\u201dChae Nayun had broken a display case and was taking out the bow inside.\u201cAre you crazy!?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m perfectly sane.\u201dThough it was only a replica, it was still an item on display. The museum\u2019s siren rang and its defense mechanism activated. In just three seconds, all exits closed down. People panicked even more, but thankfully, even an intermediate rank monster couldn\u2019t break through the barriers blocking the exits.\u201cThis is better than stopping people one by one and warning them.\u201dWith that, she cleared her throat and shouted at the panicking citizens.\u201cEveryone! Stay still! It\u2019s safer here! We\u2019re Heroes too!\u201d\u201cHey, you\u2026\u201d\u201cShut it. Don\u2019t just stand there, grab a weapon too.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why should I?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s the outside that\u2019s dangerous\u201dLooking at us\u2026 No, at Kim Suho, Chae Nayun created a magic arrow on her bow.\u201cLook there.\u201dShe pointed with her eyes. A man wearing a black coat was standing there. Before Kim Suho could say anything, Chae Nayun fired her bow without a shred of hesitation.\u201cHey, don\u2019t\u2014\u201dHer magic arrow pierced the man\u2019s throat. Immediately, Kim Suho froze. He seemed dazed by Chae Nayun\u2019s sudden murder.Any ordinary person would have died to her arrow. However, the man grabbed the arrow sticking out of his neck and pulled it out. Black magic power then rose up from his hand, burning the arrow to ash.Tap, tap.The man then turned around, facing the direction the arrow came from. His eyes burned red, as fierce hostility shot out of him.\u201c\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithout a doubt, he was a Djinn.Kim Suho\u2019s face paled. Just like Chae Nayun, he shattered a display case.He took out the Seven-Branched Sword. Though it was a replica, its faithful reconstruction made it similar to a high grade weapon. It should be strong enough to destroy a Djinn of this level.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a nice weapon. I heard it splits into seven branches.\u201dChae Nayun approached with a smirk and stood by Kim Suho\u2019s side.I also took out my handgun. I thought about standing next to them, but after consideration, took two steps backward.I was still too weak. If I showed off too much and got targeted by the Djinn, that would be the end of me.1. In Korean, there\u2019s a clear way to talk politely or casually (like between friends). Yeonha uses a strictly polite speech, while MC is using casual speech that would be between friends/people of the same age.2.

Change (2)A blue sword qi rose up around the Seven-Branched Sword. The purity of the blue mana brightened up the sword\u2019s blade. Sneaking a glance at Kim Suho\u2019s Seven-Branched Sword, Chae Nayun asked.\u201cYou ready?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dMeanwhile, I slowly backed off. There was nothing I could do here. Kim Suho would reveal his hidden power and easily take care of this Djinn. Overwhelmed by Kim Suho\u2019s might, Chae Nayun would give up seeing Kim Suho as a rival and come to admire him instead.\u201cSupport me.\u201dFixing his grip on the sword, Kim Suho spoke.\u201cSupport? Please, I\u2019ll be one killing him.\u201dRebutting playfully, Chae Nayun nocked another magic arrow.\u201cGuooo\u2014!\u201dBut before she could fire, the Djinn ignited his magic power. A jet-black evil qi hurled towards them like hellfire. But a single streak of light annihilated it. A Sword Saint could cut fire, wind, as well as magic power.Chae Nayun\u2019s arrow then flew through the lifted magic power. The arrow containing condensed mana then pierced through the Djinn\u2019s shoulder.Kim Suho didn\u2019t miss this opportunity. Leaping up, he cut down diagonally with his Seven-Branched Sword.This attack should have severed the Djinn\u2019s flesh, immobilizing him.But despite having his flesh cut, the Djinn smiled. Kim Suho instinctively felt that something was wrong.Immediately afterward, fierce magic power shot out from the cut.As though standing under a torrential rain, Kim Suho was swept away by the magic power. He didn\u2019t even have the chance to scream. He flew across the museum and became stuck inside the museum\u2019s wall.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBoth Chae Nayun and I became speechless.Strange.Something was definitely strange. This shouldn\u2019t have happened. After being pushed back for a bit, Kim Suho should have released his hidden power and overwhelmed his enemy\u2026\u201cUuu\u2026\u201dThankfully, Kim Suho got up. But he didn\u2019t seem to be in a good state.\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026 Kuu.\u201dKim Suho needed time to mend his wounds. Now, the Djinn was walking towards Chae Nayun. Her face stiffened.Chweek\u2014Chweek\u2014Chae Nayun fired two arrows. But none of them were effective. Even though she continued to shoot arrows until the Djinn looked like a porcupine, he didn\u2019t stop.\u201c\u2026This isn\u2019t regeneration.\u201dChae Nayun murmured in a daze. Just like she said, this Djinn didn\u2019t have high regenerative power. He simply had a sturdy body. In the first place, I didn\u2019t design him to be an opponent Chae Nayun could defeat.Chae Nayun\u2019s face turned ghastly pale, as fear and horror began to crop up.\u201cJust support me!\u201dAt that moment, Kim Suho jumped in front of her, blocking the Djinn\u2019s path. However, the Djinn kept his eyes on Chae Nayun. Condensing his black mana on his arm, he produced a giant beast. A wolf-like creature bared its fangs as it shot towards Kim Suho.\u201cUuuk!\u201dThe Djinn fought Kim Suho with one hand and held Chae Nayun\u2019s face with the other.\u201cAre we screwed?\u201d I murmured.By now, I had run away to the back of the exhibition. However, this place was already occupied by what seemed to be a father-and-child duo.\u201c\u2026Go that way.\u201d\u201cY-Yes?\u201d\u201cThere, go farther back. It\u2019s dangerous here.\u201dI could feel my voice trembling, and to be honest, I was scared to death.\u201cB-But\u2026\u201d\u201cWhile the Djinn\u2019s too busy fighting, hurry!\u201dAt my urging, the two quickly scurried away.From my cross bag, I took out my laptop.The Djinn in my setting shouldn\u2019t have been that strong. What even was that arm? Sneaking a glance, I saw the Djinn\u2019s wolf-like arm fighting Kim Suho evenly. I had no memory making such a setting.Something, I had to do something. At this rate, both Kim Suho and Chae Nayun could die.Unloading the magazine, I place a bullet on the laptop. My damned hands kept trembling.With the laptop, I checked the bullet\u2019s setting.===[Mana Bullet]\u300cNull attribute\u300d \u300cAttack Power (3/10)\u300d\u2014A bullet with condensed mana. It is much stronger than a gunpowder bullet.===It wasn\u2019t enough. With an attack power of 3, even scratching that Djinn wouldn\u2019t be possible. But would increasing the attack power be enough? That was another question.Thankfully, there was a hint within my setting.The reason this world required a variety of Heroes was the concept of \u2018attributes\u2019.Depending on one\u2019s attribute, an attack could have varying effects. Contradicting attributes like water and fire could allow one to overcome a difference in power to a certain degree.Now, the Djinn in question clearly had a darkness attribute. What pushed back darkness was undoubtedly \u2018light,\u2019 and I could do exactly that.I just had to change the bullet\u2019s attribute.===[Mana Bullet]\u300cLight attribute\u300d \u300cAttack Power (5/10)\u300d\u2014A bullet with a condensed essence of light.

But I still wasn\u2019t sure if this was enough. Rather than falling short, it was better to overdo it.I tried adjusting the attack power to 6.[You do not have enough SP. The value will be adjusted.]\u300cAttack Power (5.6/10)\u300d[Would you like to save the adjusted modification?]I hit save. In that instant, a white light erupted from the laptop before melting into the magic bullet.A silver-white light glistened from the bullet\u2019s iron casing.Modification complete.With only this single bullet loaded, I took in a deep breath. Then, I peeked past the wall.Chae Nayun was still struggling to escape from the Djinn\u2019s grasp, while Kim Suho was fighting the Djinn\u2019s right arm. No, Kim Suho was pushing the Djinn back. We were at an advantage. It seemed he would defeat the right arm soon.The problem was Chae Nayun. Because she couldn\u2019t breathe or because the Djinn\u2019s magic power was poisoning her, the area around her neck was purple.Clicking my tongue, I jumped out.\u201cHey!\u201dThen, I shouted loudly.\u201cMove!\u201dWithout even turning around to look, Kim Suho rolled to the side. The Djinn\u2019s right arm came chasing after him, but that only increased the surface area for me to hit.With a slightly calmer mind, I pulled the trigger. A bright light flashed from the gun barrel as though a flash bomb exploded.The bullet of light emitted pressure and heat befitting its brightness. Unable to withstand the bullet\u2019s power, the handgun exploded in my hand. The gun\u2019s broken components fell down, while I writhed in unendurable pain.Thankfully, the trajectory of the bullet didn\u2019t change. It flew along the intended trajectory, striking the Djinn\u2019s left shoulder.Bull\u2019s eye.A clump of light erupted from the Djinn\u2019s arm. The bullet\u2019s secondary explosion had detonated. The light disappeared, purifying the Djinn\u2019s arm. The Djinn had thus lost its arm.Chae Nayun, who was on the brink of death, fell to the ground.Kim Suho didn\u2019t miss this opportunity. A metal attribute magic power rose up from his sword. The Sword Saint\u2019s all-severing sword technique finally activated. It should be limited to just once or twice a day for now, but that was enough.I could just watch from the side now.\u201c\u2026 Hm?\u201dAt that moment, a child approached me. It was the child who I met before. The child had a pretty face, but the short hair made it hard to identify her gender. Suddenly, the child grabbed my hand.In an instant, my hand was healed completely.I see, this must be the child the Hero Association barely managed to find. The child with the Authority of healing.\u201cThanks.\u201dWith a grin, I stroked the child\u2019s hair.Guuuu\u2014!At that moment, a deep growl rang out. I quickly turned my sight towards the direction of the noise. The Djinn, who had lost one arm, was gasping for breath while kneeled in front of Kim Suho.It seemed Kim Suho managed to win.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dFeeling strength leaving my body, a sigh came out naturally.I sprawled down on the ground.**\u201cGueeek!\u201dChae Nayun, who just regained consciousness, was emptying her stomach with her face pointed down. From her small mouth, vomit continued to fall. The food she had yet to digest dirtied the ground, while pale yellow liquid stacked up around it.Chae Nayun continued to vomit, as though she was coughing out blood. Looking at the horrific scene, I could practically feel her pain.The reason Chae Nayun picked a bow was similar to mine. Though she acted manly on the outside, she was a sheltered lady on the inside. It wouldn\u2019t be until much later that she would overcome her delicate nature.\u201c\u2026\u201dKim Suho approached her to pat her back. But Chae Nayun hit his hand away fiercely. Kim Suho reluctantly backed away.\u201cLeave her be. I\u2019m sure her older brother will come to console her.\u201dI said so thoughtlessly. In reality, things would turn out that way. Her older brother would arrive first, then her father would come to clean up everything.But it seemed Chae Nayun took my indifference as an insult.\u201cYou, you\u2026 Gueeek!\u201dHer bloodshot eyes stabbed me. Did she want something or someone to blame? It was understandable. Unlike Yoo Yeonha, Chae Nayun was a real lady. Anything but the highest quality food would upset her stomach, and seeing a cockroach or a rat would ruin her mood for the whole day.\u201c\u2026 You.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll head out first.\u201dKim Suho tried to say something. For some reason, Kim Suho\u2019s face was stiff. But ignoring it, I turned back. I also needed time to reflect.The Djinn\u2019s strength was far greater than what I had set.I couldn\u2019t understand why.**With a single swing, a thin blade cut through the air. But from the tip of the blade, an unidentifiable white magic power undulated, shooting out in all directions and obliterating all monsters.A clean execution.Yun Seung-Ah took back her sword and turned around. Her hair fluttered in the gentle breeze. Dozens of ordinary people, who watched her attack, were left speechless. In their eyes, an unshakable respect and admiration could be seen. Seeing the world\u2019s most popular Hero attack would become a great bar story for a long time.\u201cYou can rest assured.\u201d\u201cVice-leader!\u201dA coarse voice interrupted Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s sentence. Yun Seung-Ah was slightly surprised.The man who ran over quickly dropped a bombshell.\u201cA Djinn appeared at the National Weapons Museum!\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cYou should head over immedi\u2026 What? What?\u201dBut soon, he tilted his head and focused his hearing on the transceiver in his ear.\u201c\u2026 Ah, yes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Apparently, the Djinn has been taken care of. Three cadets from Cube happened to be at the museum\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? That\u2019s great. Who were they?\u201d\u201cKim Suho, Chae Nayun, and\u2026 Ugh!\u201dBefore he could finish, a violent gale rose up, blinding him momentarily. By the time he opened his eyes back up, the Hero who had decimated dozens of monsters was gone.Running at the speed of light, Yun Seung-Ah arrived at the museum. An ordinary looking man walked out of the museum at the same time. Seeing Yun Seung-Ah, the man flinched for a moment before quickly bowing down.\u201cHello.\u201d\u2018Does he know me? Well, there aren\u2019t many who don\u2019t.\u2019Though something felt out of place, Yun Seung-Ah greeted the man without much thought.\u201cAh, yes, did something happen inside?\u201d\u201cYes. A Djinn appeared. He just died though.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 And you are?\u201dAt Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s question, the man replied with a grin.\u201cI\u2019m a cadet.\u201dAt his word, Yun Seung-Ah was taken aback. She finally figured out the previous strange feeling she had. Though she was acting humble, Yun Seung-Ah was one of the most popular Heroes in Korea. As a result, most cadets would freeze in front of her or act nervous at the very least.\u201c\u2026Oh, I see.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019m off. The ones you\u2019re looking for should be inside.\u201dBut the man who introduced himself as Kim Hajin walked away smiling without a hint of nervousness. Yun Seung-Ah observed him walking away for a moment.\u201cWho is he?\u201dQuite daring for a young cadet. But Kim Hajin\u2026? I wasn\u2019t familiar with the name. How did he know who I came for?Thinking so, Yun Seung-Ah sauntered into the museum.The inside of the museum was a mess. The tiled floors were full of signs of battle, and an ominous magic power still lingering in the air proved the existence of the Djinn.\u201cNayun!\u201dAt that moment, a vehement voice rang out from the entrance. Yun Seung-Ah turned back. There, she saw a middle-aged man looking around the museum with reddened eyes. It was someone she knew.Chae Nayun\u2019s father, Chae Shinhyuk.\u201cChae Shinhyuk-ssi?\u201d\u201c\u2026Vice-leader Yun Seung-Ah?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 You must be busy lately. It\u2019s been a while. Should we go together?\u201dPointing deeper into the museum, Yun Seung-Ah smiled.*A curved telephone pole and a car sticking out of a window, in this strange place that couldn\u2019t possibly be normal, I managed to grab a bench for myself. Heroes were busily running around cleaning up the situation, but I was in a bit of a panic myself.The story had changed. If this world was the world within my novel, this couldn\u2019t have happened. Of course, an oddity known as \u2018Kim Hajin\u2019 had already intervened, but his role had been minimal. Everything had also been fine until now.I most certainly had not done anything that could have affected\u2026Suddenly, a streak of thought flashed across my mind.\u201c\u2026Ah, that\u2019s right.\u201dI had forgotten until now.I wasn\u2019t the sole author of this story.To be precise, this world wasn\u2019t the novel I wrote.To be even more precise, this world was the remake version of my novel.\u201cThere\u2019s a co-author\u2026\u201dAfter thinking that far, an unknown feeling of emptiness rose up within me. Why was I so relaxed this entire time? Live a comfortable life? No, that was impossible from the start. Just like when someone stopped me from modifying invariable stats, that \u2018someone\u2019 wouldn\u2019t let that happen.Wiing\u2014At that moment, the laptop vibrated like a phone.When I opened it, I saw a message.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Flaw.

Change (3)[At around 1 P.M. today, a group of monsters appeared in Seoul, leaving 500 wounded and 7 dead.]A new anchor was reporting on today\u2019s incident. With a deep sigh, Chae Shinhyuk stroked the bedridden patient. Her pale complexion seemed to stab her father\u2019s heart. Though she was an adult who would soon become a Hero, Chae Nayun was still like a little girl to Chae Shinhyuk.[\u2026According to the investigation, the monster group was led by the intermediate rank grade 1 monster, \u2018beast inciter\u2019. This man-sized, badger-shaped monster has never before appeared in Korea. The Association believes that the monster was brought in by a third party, and has set out in a search.]\u201c\u2026Mmm.\u201dAt that moment, Chae Nayun opened her eyes. Chae Shinhyuk immediately shot up and called for a doctor.\u201cYou\u2019re awake. How are you feeling?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201dChae Nayun raised her feeble body. A doctor came running in to check her pulse, but Chae Nayun pushed him away with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not injured. Didn\u2019t the doctor tell you?\u201d\u201cI, I did.\u201dThe doctor spoke up inadvertently. Chae Shinhyuk was a powerful figure who had the country\u2019s economy in his palm. He knew being on this man\u2019s bad side would only make his life more difficult.\u201c\u2026She seems fine, so you can go now.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe doctor hurriedly ran out. Looking at the closing door, Chae Nayun spoke briefly.\u201c\u2026Dad.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dChae Shinhyuk replied kindly.\u201cAbout Oppa.\u201dHer low-spirited voice evoked the dark past he wanted to forget. Remembering his son always caused a sharp pain in his heart. With a gentle smile, Chae Shinhyuk held his daughter\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cCan I go see him when I\u2019m discharged? I\u2019m on a sick leave anyway, right?\u201d\u201cOf course you can.\u201dChae Shinhyuk agreed easily.Chae Nayun leaned her head against her father\u2019s shoulder and recalled what happened earlier in the day.The Djinn from the museum, the black hand that strangled her, and a voice that mentioned her older brother\u2026 At that point, Chae Nayun\u2019s fury revived.\u201cDad, by the way\u2026\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s tone was dark. Her voice carried a heavy emotion. Chae Shinhyuk asked worriedly.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dSuddenly, she began to loathe someone from the bottom of her heart. But she couldn\u2019t tell her father how she felt.She thought back to when her stomach was boiling from being poisoned by the Djinn\u2019s magic power. Even while she was writhing in pain, she could hear that man\u2019s voice clearly.\u2014I\u2019m sure her older brother will come console her.That man had mentioned her brother. Four years ago, on the day the sky fell, everyone in the world found out. So she didn\u2019t have the time to be sad. After that day, her brother\u2019s name was etched deep inside her heart, and he became an untouchable subject to her.As a cadet at Hero Academy, that man should have known about her brother\u2019s state. Even so, he had mentioned her brother in that way.Chae Nayun suppressed the fury rising from her heart and engraved the man\u2019s name in her head.Kim Hajin, Kim Hajin.From this day, Chae Nayun would no longer forget this name.**Seoul\u2019s sky was dyed in an orange hue. The movement of the sun was no different than usual, but the scene reflected by the setting sun could only be described as a pandemonium.Pieces of asphalt littered the road, while a child was crying under a telephone pole snapped in half. Ambulances traveled back and forth, carrying wounded people or corpses.Although the situation had been taken care of by the dispatched Heroes, the aftermath of chaos still remained.\u201cKim Suho, Kim Hajin. We heard the story.\u201dKim Soohyuk was waiting at the Portal connecting Seoul and Cube.\u201cWe will ask for details later, so go back and rest for now. Agents will take care of the rest.\u201dFor the record, agents were different than Heroes. Agents were those who graduated from Agent Military Academy but didn\u2019t enter Cube. In other words, they were non-combatants. Most of them had abilities that were very useful in day-to-day life. For example, I saw a man on my way back, who was fixing the broken asphalt with a wave of a hand.\u201cUm, instructor. Chae Nayun is\u2026\u201dKim Suho asked, to which Kim Soohyuk gave a short reply.\u201cShe\u2019s taking a sick leave. She\u2019s with her family right now.\u201d\u201cYes, understood.\u201dKim Suho didn\u2019t ask any more questions.\u201cGo back.\u201dOther cadets seemed to have helped out with the unexpected emergency, as even Yoo Yeonha looked tired.One by one, we trudged to the Portal. The odd sensation enveloping my body didn\u2019t feel interesting anymore. After a short sigh, I found myself back at Cube.Without any words, the group walked to the dorm.\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201dOn our way back to dorm 1, after the girls went ahead, Kim Suho stopped me.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Say what?\u201d\u201cTo Chae Nayun.\u201dWhat was he talking about all of the sudden? When I furrowed my brows in incomprehension, Kim Suho suddenly became a bit more hostile.\u201cWhy did you bring up her older brother? In such a condescending way too.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I didn\u2019t mean much by\u2026\u201dAt that instant, I swallowed my words.This world had a co-author. My setting wasn\u2019t the only setting at play.Something had to have changed.\u201c\u2026What about her older brother?\u201dAt my question, Kim Suho stopped his steps. Gritting his teeth, he glared at me.\u201cIt\u2019s something every cadet knows, but you\u2019re going to pretend you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, I really don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cWhatever. We can talk about it later. For now\u2026\u201dKim Suho quickly walked past me and got on the elevator. Under his glaring eyes were thick dark circles. Since he used \u2018that\u2019 ability, he needed to crash.Since my room was on the first floor, I didn\u2019t need to get on the elevator.*The moment I sat down on my couch, I turned on my smartwatch. An internet window popped up in the air. This world\u2019s main search engine was Neighbor[1]. The interface was no different than what I was used to, so getting used to it posed no problem.First, I looked up Chae Nayun.What Kim Suho said and how Chae Nayun reacted were indeed strange.===[Chae Nayun] (Hero cadet)Family \u2013 Father: Chae Shinhyuk, Older Brother: Chae JinyoonEducation\u2014Agent Military Academy Rank 4\u2014Currently attending Hero Military Academy (Cube)===\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201dChae Jinyoon. It\u2019s not like he was dead or missing, so why were they so worked up?Even as I tilted my head, I looked up Chae Jinyoon.At the same time, my jaws dropped.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d[Chae Shinhyuk\u2019s son, Chae Jinyoon. In critical condition from a Djinn attack.][The Djinn suppression operation, \u2018Fireflake\u2019, succeeds\u2026 However, the rookie Hero, Chae Jinyoon, falls in a coma.]There were headlines I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhat?\u201dDjinn suppression operation, Fireflake. I knew what it was. It was the first operation that gave Chae Jinyoon fame.By leading this operation to a success and rescuing three comrades in the process, he would have been promoted to an intermediate rank Hero. Chae Nayun, who was only 13 at the time, would have always bragged about her older brother who suddenly rose to fame.No, that was how things should have been.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201dUnable to take everything in, I took out my laptop. If there was a hint, the laptop had to have it.[Thanks to your high luck, light bullet deals critical damage to \u2018Dog of Lucius\u2019.][With great luck, your understanding of the light attribute increases!][With extreme luck, you absorb part of the magic power emitted by the light bullet!

No, I didn\u2019t need to look for it. This settings book was something I wrote. Since what happened today wasn\u2019t part of my setting, looking for my settings book wouldn\u2019t do anything.However, I had received a message on my laptop.[Chae Jinyoon \u2013 In the original story, he was Chae Nayun\u2019s reliable older brother and Kim Suho\u2019s trustworthy helper. However, it has been judged that the main character has too many helpers, and thus this setting was changed.][Modified setting \u2013 In his first mission as a Hero four years ago, Chae Jinyoon receives a Devil\u2019s Branding and falls into a coma. Currently, he is a Devil\u2019s Seed.][Note: Modified settings will be provided as messages once the target, \u2018Kim Hajin\u2019, becomes aware of it.]Without realizing that my mouth was open, I stared at the screen in a daze.By the time my saliva dropped on the laptop, I barely managed to eek out a voice.\u201cFucking\u2026\u201dAnd that was all I could say.If this message was true, this was an extremely serious problem.Devil\u2019s Seed was something that only appeared in the latter half of the novel. If it sprouted, the current Kim Suho was nowhere strong enough to stop it. A Master rank Hero would be able to stop it, but most Master ranks had left the secular world.Even if high-rank Heroes were dispatched, a few of them would surely be sacrificed.That couldn\u2019t happen. Their strength was needed in the novel\u2019s latter parts.In other words, everything would go awry if this Devil\u2019s Seed sprouted. Of course, things had already gone awry, but it was still to a manageable degree.Then what could I do?There was only one answer, so I didn\u2019t need to think for long.\u201c\u2026He needs to die.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThankfully, the Devil\u2019s Seed had an incubation period. From what I recall, it should be 5 or 6 years.Four years had already passed.As quickly as possible, before the Devil inside Chae Jinyoon\u2019s body woke up, Chae Jinyoon had to be killed.The problem was \u2018who\u2019.Who should kill him?I couldn\u2019t hire an assassin. Even if I offered billions of won, no mercenary was crazy enough to accept a mission to kill a chaebol.Not to mention, because the Devil\u2019s Seed was undetectable, no one would believe me even if I told the truth. In fact, I was sure I would just be treated as a crazy person.He needed to die.There was only one way this could be done.\u201cI have to kill him.\u201dWith a deep sigh, I closed my eyes.Chae Jinyoon was a reliable friend and helper for Kim Suho, though he was an idiot when it came to his sister. But in this world, he had become a character that had to be killed. While this complete change was shocking, I didn\u2019t have the peace of mind to be shocked.I got up. My body felt especially heavy. The sense of familiarity I felt towards the world I created transformed into a greater anxiety.But perhaps thanks to my high perseverance, my legs weren\u2019t heading towards the bed, but the physical training room.1.

For Growth (1)Tower of Hero, located in the heart of Seoul.On the 103rd floor of this Hero Association headquarters, Yun Seung-Ah was reading the records on the recent incident unauthorized. The video she was watching was filmed by the museum\u2019s camera. Naturally, it contained the battle between Cube\u2019s cadets and a Djinn.Though she was a bit hesitant, knowing she could get in trouble if found out, the words she heard from a Hero Association agent urged her forward.\u2014A trace of light attribute mana was found at the scene.Light attribute mana. Not only was it strange, it was also extremely valuable. Light attributed Heroes played vital roles in suppressing Djinns, as most Djinns had the darkness attribute.The fact that light attribute was detected in the museum naturally meant that one of the three cadets who defeated the Djinn had the light attribute.Yun Seung-Ah, who often emphasized the importance of attributes wherever she went, wanted to know the owner of that rare mana.\u201cBut this person\u2026\u201dIndeed, there was a man who caught her attention. From head to toe, he was ordinary in every way. Inside the video, the man in question was talking to Kim Suho. When the Djinn appeared, he backed off stealthily and simply spectated the fight.But seeing the Kim Suho being pushed back, he went into hiding and began to make strange actions. He unloaded his gun, leaving only a single bullet behind. Then, he began to tap on thin air.After about a minute, he loaded the bullet in his gun and headed to battle.What happened next was even more mysterious.His gun exploded at the same time he fired his gun, while a brilliant white light dyed the surroundings. Because of the light, the camera froze up for three seconds. By the time the screen came back to normal, everything was settled.\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dMost people assumed the attack to be Kim Suho\u2019s, but Yun Seung-Ah was doubtful. No matter how she thought about it, the light had to have come from the man\u2019s attack. Even Kim Suho admitted in his report, \u201cKim Hajin covered me.\u201d\u201cKim Hajin. I remember him now. He\u2019s the cadet who chose a gun\u2026 So there was a reason he chose it.\u201dThud!At that moment, the door shot open. Startled, Yun Seung-Ah turned to the door.There, she was the Association\u2019s executive, Aileen.Though she had a small build and was only 153cm tall, Yun Seung-Ah knew that a 10m tall giant resided inside her. Unfortunately for her, Aileen was glaring at her with terrifying eyes. Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s face paled as she jumped up in horror.\u201cUn, Unni?\u201d\u201cI knew you were here. Come out.\u201d\u201cAh, wait, Unni. I can explain. I can\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and follow me.\u201dYun Seung-Ah didn\u2019t want to follow her out even if it cost her life. But her body moved on its own. It was Aileen\u2019s one-of-a-kind Gift, \u2018Spirit Speech\u2019. Of course, as powerful as it was, the price she had to pay was equally great. There was a high risk of magic power recoil and her underdeveloped body was also a price she had to pay. But still\u2026\u201cUnni, I\u2019m a Hero too! Please, give me some face!\u201dHer ability was honestly too much of a cheat.\u201cOnly the Association\u2019s Heroes are authorized to come in here.\u201d\u201cI know! I\u2019ll leave on my own, so let me go!\u201d\u201cYou better hurry before I throw you out the window.\u201dIn the end, Yun Seung-Ah was chased out of the record room.\u201cYou have two choices. One, be punished. Two, help me with something.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please, let me go this one time. I don\u2019t want to do either.\u201dOnly the video Yun Seung-Ah was watching was left to play in the emptied room.\u201cSave me\u2014!\u201d**[Tuesday\u2019s combat training, labyrinth exploration.]Inside a dark cave created by Cube, Yoo Yeonha, me, and the rest of team 5 were in the middle of our combat training.\u201cHoseung-ssi, Hazuki-ssi, can you see something?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked with a frown.We were in an artificial dungeon designed after a dark labyrinth. The goal of the training was to break through the labyrinth filled with undead monsters and to reach the labyrinth\u2019s center. Because the mist was created through darkness mana, even Heroes found it difficult to light up the cave.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cMe neither\u2026\u201dJin Hoseung and Hazuki answered.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dYoo Yeonha clicked her tongue and didn\u2019t ask anymore. I was still treated as an invisible person, even after I gifted her a Coke.Shaking my head, I spoke, \u201cI can see.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dJin Hoseung and Hazuki were surprised, but Yoo Yeonha ignored me.\u201cI said, I can see.\u201dAnnoyed at her attitude, I spoke loudly to the back of her head.\u201cI can see through the dark.\u201dAt that instant, Yoo Yeonha turned back quickly with glaring eyes. However, she was facing Jin Hoseung, not me.\u201cStop fooling around.\u201dInsulted out of the blue, Jin Hoseung was taken aback, while I retorted casually.\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you\u2019re going to fall if you go that way.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense\u2014 kyak!\u201dYoo Yeonha missed her footing at just the right time. As she began to plummet downwards, I jumped in and grabbed her arm. Yoo Yeonha clutched my shoulder with trembling hands.\u201c\u2026Kuhum.\u201dAfter climbing back up using my body as a rope, Yoo Yeona let out a dry cough as though nothing happened.\u201c\u2026Looks like you aren\u2019t lying. How can you see?\u201d\u201cI have good eyes.\u201dIt was thanks to my Gift. Thousand-Mile Eyes weren\u2019t hindered by distance or obstacles. That, of course, included lighting.\u201c\u2026Good, you should at least be able to do that much. So, where should we go?\u201d\u201cJust follow me.\u201d\u201cOh~ how reliable~\u201dJin Hoseung placed his hand on my shoulder as though we were friends. Taking his hand off, I walked forward.Things were pretty easy from that point.I just had to walk, dodging what I could dodge and notifying Yoo Yeonha what I couldn\u2019t.If the unavoidable enemy was a fluid-bodied spirit, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s merciless whip took care of it, and if it was an undead, Jin Hoseung and Hazuki took care of it.My stamina had increased thanks to working out, so there was no problem there. Though not having to run played a big part, this particular training was a breeze.And now, I could see the result with my own eyes.We managed to reach the center of the labyrinth. There, we only saw 8 people. In other words, we scored third place.\u201cYoo Yeonha?\u201d\u201cHey, Jonghak.\u201dShin Jonghak, who was sitting on a rock acting needlessly cool, called Yoo Yeonha. She ran towards him with an amiable smile. How she treated Shin Jonghak was clearly different than how she treated me.\u201cOver here.\u201dKim Soohyuk, who was waiting, read out our time without paying attention to Yoo Yeonha\u2019s touching reunion.\u201cTeam 5. 48 minutes 10 seconds. Third place.\u201dAt the same time, Jin Hoseung and Hazuki cheered.\u201cWhoo. It\u2019s all thanks to you. You really have great eyes~\u201d\u201cYou do, you do!\u201dFor now, I sat on the ground with them. Yoo Yeonha had already left for Shin Jonghak, and Kim Suho was sleeping on the ground. It seemed he was still suffering from releasing his ability at the museum.I also relaxed.In about five minutes, another team arrived. I wasn\u2019t surprised with who it was. Sharpshooters generally had good eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s Nayun.\u201dSeeing Chae Nayun\u2019s silhouette from the darkness, Yoo Yeonha approached, pretending to be happy.For some reason, Chae Nayun was covered in dust. It seemed she fell into a trap. Walking towards my direction, she rested her eyes on me and paused. Her cold eyes seemed to pierce through me.\u201c\u2026Nayun?\u201dShe didn\u2019t respond to Yoo Yeonha\u2019s call. Ignoring her completely, Chae Nayun marched towards me and asked suddenly.\u201cWhat was your time?\u201dIt was a short question. I gave back a short reply.\u201c\u202648 minutes.\u201dChae Nayun clenched her teeth. Sharpshooters often acted as a team\u2019s pathfinder. Chae Nayun rightfully thought I guided my team.\u201cLooks like even you have something you\u2019re good for.\u201dIt was a clear provocation. I hesitated to reply. Should I strike back?I did have a good reason to do so.The novel\u2019s antagonists had become stronger, so it was necessary for our side\u2026 though the current Chae Nayun might not be on my side\u2026 Anyways, it was necessary for the leading characters to also get stronger.To do that, Chae Nayun needed to quickly abandon the bow. In this world, her potential was second only to Kim Suho. But with a bow, her potential would be wasted.\u201c\u2026I guess you\u2019re right.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut I still didn\u2019t find the need to respond to her provocation.Between negative motivation and positive motivation, Chae Nayun was more affected by the former according to my setting. However, the agent of the motivation was important. A weakling like me provoking her most likely wouldn\u2019t have much meaning.Now wasn\u2019t the time. Furthermore, I was confident that it wouldn\u2019t be long until I surpassed Chae Nayun in archery.I just had to wait until then.\u201cHmph.\u201dChae Nayun seemed bored by my retreat, as she returned with a snort.I shook my head.At that moment, my eyes met Yoo Yeonha\u2019s. For some reason, her eyes carried a slight hint of interest that hadn\u2019t existed before.\u201cHmph.\u201d\u2026But soon, she walked away with the same disdainful snort as Chae Nayun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For Growth (2)Today\u2019s combat training came to an end.Though I was exhausted, I still had to go to the academic club. After that, I had to do my daily workout. Thinking about the agony of my daily life, I became depressed. If I knew this would happen, I would have put more points into perseverance.\u2026In any case, I was currently heading to the academic club\u2019s clubroom. Perhaps because this was the usual path she took or because we had a similar personality, I could see Yoo Yeonha in front of me.Yoo Yeonha herself didn\u2019t see me and continued walking. When she arrived at the clubroom, she stood in front of the door and took out a hand mirror. She lightly checked to see whether or not anything was on her. But at that exact moment, her eyes met mine.\u201cWhat a coincidence, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIgnoring me, Yoo Yeonha walked in. I also followed. Yoo Yeonha sat on a sunny seat, while I took the dark corner seat.Yun Hyuk, the club president, was already standing on the podium. Wearing his glasses, he seemed to be organizing today\u2019s lecture notes.Not long afterward, 43 first years arrived along with 20 upperclassmen. At seven on the dot, Yun Hyuk began the first academic club lecture.\u201cGood evening, everyone. The weather\u2019s starting to get\u2026\u201dAny useless talk went into one ear and left from the other.\u201cToday, we will discuss monsters\u2019 vital points. As I\u2019m sure you all know, the location of a monster\u2019s vital point is an important piece of information in defeating a monster. You can see how critical this information can be by looking at senior Seo Youngji. By reaching the pinnacle of this ability, she has reached top 2000 on Hero rankings.\u201dA hologram of Seo Youngji\u2019s specs popped up on the projection screen.A Hero\u2019s specs were summarized into strength, dexterity, durability, constitution, and magic power. Other than dexterity, Seo Youngji\u2019s specs were all under intermediate rank, but her dexterity was at the Master rank. For the record, only 300 Heroes in the world had Master ranked dexterity.\u201cSenior Seo Youngji even hunted a high rank monster by herself.\u201dAs he said, Seo Youngji was a well-known character in this world. Though she had an introverted personality, I was sure I would meet her since she played an important role in the story.\u201cBut don\u2019t think monsters\u2019 vital points are the same as a human\u2019s. For us, the eyes, heart, and head serve as vital points, but that isn\u2019t always the case for monsters.\u201dTo add on, a monster\u2019s vital point became stranger the higher ranked it was.\u201cNow, let\u2019s take a look at an example.\u201dIn an instant, a hologram of a monster appeared on the screen.Though it looked similar to a mountain tiger, its giant body, bloodshot eyes, and ferocious teeth clearly indicated that it wasn\u2019t a normal tiger.\u201cThis monster is called the Mountain Tyrant. It can be classified anywhere from intermediate rank to high rank. As one of the first monsters to have appeared during Outcall, it has been known for 50 years, but its vital point hasn\u2019t been discovered yet.\u201dWith that, Yun Hyuk paused and made a meaningful smile.\u201c\u2026At least, that\u2019s how things are in public. In reality, even if an individual or a guild knew its vital point, they wouldn\u2019t reveal it to the public. They likely weren\u2019t allowed to either.\u201dHe was right. In this world, information was an industry. There were large corporations solely focused on gathering and researching information on monsters, and in a smaller scale, private detectives and detective agencies gathered and sold information. As such, leaking such information was heavily penalized.Of course, requiring this information to be public would greatly help humanity fight against monsters, but the power of capitalism suppressed any debates on this topic.\u201cNow, where do you think this Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point is?\u201dYun Hyuk gave Yoo Yeonha a meaningful look. A Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point, Yoo Yeonha likely had no clue. Even I only created the setting and never used it. There just wasn\u2019t a chance for the main character to go tiger-hunting.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I thought, she didn\u2019t seem to know. Seeing as how she was fiddling with her hair and looking around, it seemed she was ashamed for not knowing the answer.\u201cWould anyone like to guess?\u201dI, of course, knew the answer. It was a good opportunity to stand out, but I didn\u2019t raise my hand. Yun Hyuk was acting like he did. Though his pretentious face irritated me, I wanted to see what he was scheming.\u201cI\u2026\u201dAt that moment, a girl raised her hand. I was surprised. Who the heck was that?\u201cIs it his nose?\u201dShe guessed with a flushed face.She was just an extra who fell for Yun Hyuk.*The academic club continued for two hours. Unexpectedly, there was a lot to learn like the vital points of monsters, compatibility between attributes, and the difference between a magic and a spell. I learned in detail about things I had lazily explained in my novel, all the while I watched cute female cadets discuss the topic.\u201cWe have an after-party planned at a nearby restaurant! It\u2019ll be great if you can come!\u201dAnyways, after the club ended, Yun Hyuk announced that there was an after-party at a nearby restaurant.For some reason, Yoo Yeonha seemed interested in going. Feeling a bit worried, I followed her. I knew she wasn\u2019t the type to participate in things like after-parties.\u201cHey, you going?\u201dI approached her casually and asked.She didn\u2019t respond.Thinking it was because of the way I talked, I asked again.\u201cAre you going?\u201dShe ignored me again.This time, I asked with even more decorum and propriety.\u201cAre you also going to the after-party, Yeonha-ssi?\u201dOnly then did Yoo Yeonha respond with a faint nod.\u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you busy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201d\u2018This fool.\u2019That was what Yoo Yeonha\u2019s eyes were saying.\u201cWhy are you going?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dOh, I get it now.Public information on the Mountain Tyrant was scant to say the least. Not only did its strength vary greatly from individual to individual, it also lived in an extremely remote place. Although the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s leather sold for a hefty price, it was hard to plan a hunt when one couldn\u2019t be sure of the efficient number of people to bring.Yoo Yeonha was the successor of a major guild.So the reason Yun Hyuk acted like he knew the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point was this. Because I didn\u2019t write my novel from Yoo Yeonha\u2019s point of view, I didn\u2019t exactly write out how Yun Hyuk managed to coax Yoo Yeonha. It seemed \u2018guild\u2019 was the keyword for luring her out.Yoo Yeonha had a guild lineage. Her clan had risen to power during Outcall 50 years ago, thanks to the massive success of her family\u2019s first generation head.Her family was still a successful Hero clan, but Yoo Yeonha had a bit of an inferiority complex. Compared to a true noble clan, she felt her family was lacking. This was why she saw Shin Jonghak favorably, and it was also why she was overly obsessed with face and decorum.\u201c\u2026The Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point?\u201dWas this a good chance to make an investment? There was a lot to gain from keeping a cordial relationship with Yoo Yeonha. With great proficiency in handling businesses and at calculating profitability, she was destined to become the \u2018King of Seoul\u2019 in the future.\u201cI\u2019m not curious. I already know.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked again as she furrowed her brows. She looked thoroughly annoyed on top of being in disbelief.At that moment, I made my decision. Using this information that would be publicized one day, I would draw Yoo Yeonha\u2019s interest and instill a sense of mystery into her. Considering the SP and additional benefits I would gain from it, it was an acceptable trade.I lowered my voice to a whisper and relayed the information to her in a serious tone.\u201cThe Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point is on the heel of its hindleg.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a blue mark on its hindleg\u2019s heel. But its DNA determines whether it\u2019s the right hindleg or the left. That\u2019s probably why its vital point hasn\u2019t been discovered until now.\u201dI was the one who created the setting for the Mountain Tyrant. I was inspired by the story of Achilles\u2019 Heel when I made the setting. It was unlikely that this setting was changed, as tiny details seemed to be left untouched.\u201cThe Mountain Tyrant\u2019s body is tough, but this blue mark on its heel is the only place that\u2019s soft. That\u2019s the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point. If you strategize around it, it should be easy to rob it of its two hind legs.\u201dThe value of this information had to be tens of millions of won. But considering my current credibility, it likely wouldn\u2019t be over 100 won.\u201c\u2026Nuthead.\u201dAs expected, Yoo Yeonha gave a disdainful look as though she was looking at an insect. She then began to walk away. I followed after her.\u201cIt\u2019s true. Believe me.\u201d\u201cWould you believe me if our positions were swapped?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI, of course, wouldn\u2019t have believed her.\u201cIt\u2019s your choice whether to believe me or not\u2026\u201dI hoped she would.\u201cHey!\u201dAt that moment, Yun Hyuk suddenly cut in between Yoo Yeonha and me. Shoving me back slightly, he asked.\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too pushy?\u201dBecause of this cheesy son of a bitch\u2019s height, I had to look up at him. But instead, I turned to Yoo Yeonha.\u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201dShe gave a cold hearted reply. I grew angry at Yun Hyuk\u2019s mocking laugh.\u201cBy the way, are you also coming to the after-party?\u201dHe spoke condescendingly. I shook my head.\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t bother other people too much. Um, Yeonha-ssi\u2026?\u201dHowever, Yoo Yeonha had already begun to walk away.\u201cHeh.\u201dI returned what I received. With a distorted face, Yun Hyuk chased after Yoo Yeonha. I, on the other hand, simply watched them leave.I gave Yoo Yeonha a valuable information, but I didn\u2019t know whether she would use it or forget about it. In the case of the former, I would gain a likely ally, and in the case of the latter\u2026 nothing would happen.In any case, I had nothing to lose.**On a dark winter night, Yoo Yeonha was deep in thought as she tapped on her desk with her pen.Tomorrow, \u2018Essence of the Strait\u2019 guild\u2019s elite team would go out to hunt a Mountain Tyrant.They had secretly purchased information about a lone Mountain Tyrant living in Kumgang Mountain, and they had already confirmed its size with a scout.It was estimated to be high-intermediate rank grade 1. The strength of its pelt reached Promentium, a tough ore found after Outcall. As such, the guild would gain an astronomical income if the hunt was successful.But Yoo Yeonha was worried about one thing. It wasn\u2019t for the safety of the elite hunting team. The current vice-leader of \u2018Essence of the Strait\u2019 held too much power. She felt her seat as the guild\u2019s successor threatened.Right, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s worry was about this. To succeed the guild without a problem, she had to start making contributions.In the end, Yoo Yeonha turned on her smartwatch. Using its communication functionality, she made a phone call. Soon, the receiver picked up, and a hologram screen popped up.\u201c\u2026Um, Uncle?\u201d\u2014Yes, Young Lady.On the screen was Kim Sangho. He was a veteran in his forties, who was her father\u2019s most trusted right arm. Ever since she was a child, Yoo Yeonha treated him like her real uncle.\u2014What\u2019s wrong?Though she made the call, Yoo Yeonha was too embarrassed to say anything.A blue mark on its heel? You can disable both of its hind legs by attacking it? Just what was I doing, fooled by that crazy\u2019s nonsense?\u201cUm, I\u2019m saying this just in case\u2026\u201dBut the possibility wasn\u2019t zero and it didn\u2019t seem like it would hurt to try. Though it came from that crazy nutjob, there had to be a reason he was so confident. Justifying herself, Yoo Yeonha caught her breath.\u2014Yes, Young Lady?\u201cUm, I know it sounds crazy, but\u2026\u201dClosing her eyes and clenching her fists, she spoke.\u201cIf things are looking rough, try looking at its hind legs\u2019 heels.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2026Hindlegs\u2019 heels?Kim Sangho furrowed his brows.Yoo Yeonha knew what that meant. But if she could be of help, and if this information was real\u2026\u201cYes, its hind legs\u2019\u2026 heels. Either on its left or right heel, there should be\u2026 well, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha continued while risking being embarrassed.\u201cIf there is a blue mark there, try aiming for that place.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For Growth (3)In the middle of the night when owls came out to cry, I came back from working out and collapsed on my bed.Ever since I came to this world, I found it hard to fall asleep. My body was tired, but countless random thoughts emerged in my head preventing me from falling asleep.How could I survive in this world? What actions should I take? Should I be a supporter who secretly helps the leading characters? Or should I become a villain and execute the evil side from the inside like in the noir movie I saw?Then, I got suddenly curious about my current stats. I looked for my laptop.===\u25b7Stats*Variable stats[Strength 1.735][Stamina 1.845][Speed 2.15][Perception 2.605][Vitality 1.65][Magic power 1.3]===Sure enough, my stats were on the rise. All stats other than magic power had surpassed an average adult male\u2019s (1.5), and my perception could be said to have surpassed what an ordinary person was capable of having.But I was still far from ready from entering a field. I needed money, it wouldn\u2019t be long until the Packhorse Master guild would go public.Suddenly, a thought flashed through my mind.Indeed, going to the Field was the most honest way of making money. I had been putting it off because my stats were lacking, but after thinking about it carefully, there was a way around it.I could make up for my lacking stats by using the laptop to strengthen my weapon. Just like Kim Suho, who would later use a single holy sword to sever a mountain\u2026It seemed like the quickest way to become stronger. But it was also a huge waste of SP.I currently had a training gun provided by Cube and 380 SP I got from destroying my potential friendship with Chae Nayun. Now, suppose I also had the famous handgun, Desert Eagle.Even if I invested all of my SP into strengthening my training gun, it would likely only come to equal the Desert Eagle.In other words, SP was more efficient when it modified weapons with a more powerful base performance.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dSpeaking of the Desert Eagle, I suddenly became curious. It was the only firearm I had in my setting.Without getting up from my bed, I turned on my smartwatch and entered a weapons dealer website.Essential Armory.It was an armory operated by the \u2018Essence of the Strait\u2019 guild. Since weapons above the artifact grade were sold in auctions, Essential Armory was the most popular website for factory manufactured weapons.[Welcome to Essential Armory.]As expected of the most popular weapons dealer website, it was well designed. The homepage showed off new items, while the top bar had categories such as sword, spear, bow, and rapier. Perhaps because mercenaries often used the website, it also had a good selection of guns.I clicked on [category \u2013 gun].There were different types of guns such as handgun, assault rifle, and sniper rifle. For now, a handgun suited me best since it didn\u2019t hinder my movements. The Desert Eagle seemed to be a popular choice among handguns, as I quickly found it.===Desert Eagle\u2014Feel the transcendental power! Built into the Desert Eagle is a magic amplification device that boosts the power of magic bullets! Because of its huge recoil, the Desert Eagle is recommended only for the most proficient sharpshooters.*Weight: 3.5948kg (1.2938kg with weight reduction magic effect added)*Length: 333mm*Identification and contract required to purchase.===Desert Eagle. Its picture on the website looked much more beautiful than the original design. The barrel had an elegant platinum color, while a majestic eagle was inscribed on the grip. While looking like a piece of art, this weapon boasted a heavy weight and a bulky size.Just from a glance, I could tell how powerful it was. There was just one problem.\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201dIt was expensive. Its base price was 20 million won, and the price doubled when I clicked on a checkbox that said \u2018full attachments\u2019. I needed the weapon to make money, so buying it almost seemed counterproductive.\u201c\u2026Ehew.\u201dI tried to think about what to do, but my brain refused to function. My consciousness was foggy, and I felt drowsy. It seemed sleep would come to me soon.I turned off the smartwatch without hesitation and entrusted myself to my instincts. Thinking about this could wait until tomorrow.\u2026When I opened my eyes back up, it was Wednesday.Bright morning light shone through the curtain.It was an unpleasant light no matter how many times I looked at it.Another exhausting day had begun.\u201cWhew.\u201dWith a sigh, I brushed off the negative emotions that came to me every morning. After trudging to the bathroom and getting washed, I put on my uniform and left the dorm. 10 minutes was enough for this routine.Once outside, I saw other cadets getting ready for class. It was still early morning, but they were busy laughing and chatting. Seeing them enjoying their school life, I began to realize why I felt so lethargic.I didn\u2019t have a friend in this world. I didn\u2019t even have someone to talk to. Being able to hang out with friends was the only thing keeping school from being boring, but I was no longer in my old world.Should I try to look for a girlfriend?No, I was too lazy for that. If I used too much of my emotion on needless human relationships, my condition could get worse.Yep, I should just be content with dying alone.With that, I quickened my pace to the classroom.**\u201cAs you know, a guild\u2019s database contains many useful information. But most of the time, you have to reach a certain rank to get access to them.\u201dI thought about my weapon as I half-heartedly listened to an old professor\u2019s lecture. The figure of a majestic eagle shimmered in front of my eyes.How could I make the money to buy it?The first thing I thought of was selling information.I had designed most of the monsters myself, so I roughly knew their vital points and attributes. Since each guild had a different collection of data, if I sold them the information they didn\u2019t have\u2026No, this wasn\u2019t the best idea.In the first place, it took 5 years for an information broker to build up his reputation. It also didn\u2019t seem like a good idea to disrupt the world\u2019s balance just to make some money.\u201c\u2026Now, let\u2019s continue after a little break.\u201dBefore I noticed, break time rolled around. I immediately turned on my smartwatch to enter Essential Armory once more, but I had received an unexpected message.[Excuse me.]I was familiar with the sender\u2019s name.Rank 7, Yoo Yeonha.Because smartwatches of cadets were connected to the Cube\u2019s intranet, it was possible to message other cadets without knowing their exact contact address. This was the first time I was using this feature.Yoo Yeonha was sitting in the front row. After giving the back of her head a quick glance, I replied to her message.[What?][What are you?]What nonsense was this?[What do you mean?]She didn\u2019t reply for a while. I wondered where this was coming from, then remembered what I told her before. I peeked at the time. It was 1 P.M. I gave her the information yesterday and she already confirmed it was true?[Ah, is it about that? I\u2019m surprised you believed me.][What?][So? Wasn\u2019t I right?]In truth, I was also dying to know whether the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s setting was unchanged. If this unknown co-author wanted to change everything I knew, I would have a tough time ahead of me.[\u2026Yes.]\u201cWhew.\u201dThankfully, it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case. I breathed a sigh of relief.[How did you know?][You think I\u2019d tell you?]Yoo Yeonha\u2019s shoulder twitched. Immediately afterwards, she returned a short reply.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[No.]A smirk emerged on my face. When I was about to end the conversation, I remembered something.Desert Eagle, the elegant and dignified bird of prey.I had almost forgotten about it. The reason I gave the information to her was for times like this.Coincidentally, Essential Armory was operated by Yoo Yeonha\u2019s guild, \u2018Essence of the Strait.\u2019[Anyways, if you benefited from the information I gave you, I\u2019d like to ask for a favor.]Yoo Yeonha suddenly turned around. As though she had kept an eye on my seat, she knew exactly where I was. Though her gaze was still sharp, it seemed to hold less weight.How should I put it\u2026 Right, she looked like a big bag of money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For Growth (4)[What do you want?]I knew Yoo Yeonha would agree. She was the type who couldn\u2019t stand one-sided favors.Now, I wondered I should ask for.Asking for money didn\u2019t feel right. It was Yoo Yeonha I was talking about, but she was still a minor. She likely couldn\u2019t freely spend tens of millions of won.[It\u2019s simple. I need a weapon.]After sending her the above message, I sent her the link to Essential Armory\u2019s Desert Eagle.Yoo Yeonha looked at the link I sent her and looked back up at me. She didn\u2019t seem to have any hostility.[I think it\u2019s pretty cheap.][\u2026I understand.]Great, she agreed.[Is it possible to get it by tomorrow?]The quicker it was, the more money I would make. Even if tomorrow was too difficult, I hoped to get it by the end of the week.[Yes, I\u2019ll take care of it.]Surprisingly, she replied without hesitation, even though her parents should still be in charge of guild work. I was impressed by her decisiveness.\u201cGet back to your seats.\u201dThe break ended at just the right time, as the old professor resumed class after drinking some water.**Wednesday\u2019s theory class ended. And at 3 P.M., anti-personnel training began.In a fairly large training field, each cadet met with others they promised to spar. Meanwhile, I looked for the instructor pitifully.\u201cHey.\u201dA sharp voice stabbed my ear from the back. It had to be calling me. I turned around and instantly froze. Chae Nayun was glaring at me with terrifying eyes.She asked, \u201cSpar with me.\u201dThe hostility in her tone bordered on killing intent.Gulp. I swallowed a mouthful of saliva.Like the saying, \u2018a word causes a debt worth a thousand gold taels,\u2019 I had made a terrifying enemy with a sentence. Indeed, Chae Nayun was too dangerous of a person to have as an enemy. In order to live a peaceful life, I had to mend our relationship even at the cost of kneeling and begging.But looking at Chae Nayun, I fell in thought. Would she be able to forgive me for my rash insult just because I apologized?Seeing me silent, Chae Nayun pointed at my gun and spoke.\u201cYour gun. Take it out.\u201dThe first training gun broke when I fought the Djinn. This was a new one. I looked down at my holster, then back up at Chae Nayun.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201c\u2026You scared?\u201dThese two words carried a great echo, causing the eyes on the training field to fall on us.\u201cMm\u2026\u201dHow should I act in front of Chae Nayun?Without a doubt, the \u2018incident\u2019 I was clueless about was well known among all cadets. The original Kim Chundong should have known about it too. So if I apologized now, it might seem like an even greater insult.\u201cNo.\u201d\u2026Furthermore, it might be better for me to remain a bad guy to Chae Nayun. My first and foremost goal and the reason I worked so hard without resting\u2026 was all to kill her older brother within a certain amount of time.Even if I mended my relationship with Chae Nayun and even became friends, my actions would only leave her with a cruel sense of betrayal and hatred.\u201cI\u2019m afraid you might get hurt. This thing uses real bullets, you see.\u201dImmediately, the weight of the atmosphere changed. Chae Nayun clenched her bow. I could see the amount of force she put in through the veins popping out of her hand.\u201cI don\u2019t think your bullets will hurt me even if they hit.\u201dChae Nayun forcefully suppressed her anger and retorted with a cold sneer.My response was simple.\u201cYou won\u2019t get hurt. You\u2019ll die instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha, say that again, punk.\u201dChae Nayun approached me up close. She looked like she would explode at any moment. She was technically 165 while I was 174, but she seemed a lot bigger for some reason.\u201cReally, who do you think you are?\u201dThe atmosphere turned for the worse and more spectators gathered to watch the fight. At that moment\u2026\u201cChae Nayun, get back.\u201dThe instructor stepped in. I breathed a sigh of relief, thankful that she came before it was too late. Chae Nayun turned towards the instructor.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\u201cBefore he gets a gun for sparring, no one can spar with Kim Hajin cadet.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cI mind.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d\u201cFailure to heed an instructor\u2019s order will be met with disciplinary action.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAn instructor\u2019s words were absolute. Chae Nayun clenched her teeth with a wronged look. But in the end, she gave me a final glare before leaving. The spectators also dispersed and went back to their training.Everything had returned to normal.\u201cTake your gun out.\u201dThe instructor spoke as she wrapped her hands in bandages. Her name\u2026 Park Hyun-Ah, was it? I asked the instructor.\u201cDoes a gun for sparring even exist?\u201d\u201cHow the hell would I know?\u201dCrack, crack.\u00a0The instructor cracked her knuckles and neck in front of me.\u201cNow, come.\u201dThen with a smile, she gestured with her finger.This person\u2026 Did she enjoy this?**Thursday was the hunting club\u2019s orientation. But since cadets weren\u2019t required to go to orientations, I decided to skip it for this week. It was partly to avoid Chae Nayun, but the main reason was to test out the weapon I would receive as quickly as possible.\u201cAh, I can\u2019t wait.\u201dI was currently at Angel Box, a coffee shop near Seoul. I was waiting for an item at this place. For the record, cadets were able to use Portals 5~6 times a month as long as they filled out a form.Time passed by. 5:29:55\u2026 5:29:56\u2026 5:30:00.At exactly the promised time, the shop\u2019s door opened.A man in a black suit and sunglasses walked in with a suitcase. After looking around for a moment, his eyes met mine. I waved my hand happily. The man\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. Striding with his long legs, he walked up to me.\u201cKim Hajin-ssi?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201dI felt like I knew who this man was. Only one person popped up in my head when I thought about Yoo Yeonha\u2019s attendant \u2013 Jin Sechan.The man presumed to be Jin Sechan placed the suitcase on the table without sitting down.\u201cHere\u2019s the item. Please take a look.\u201d\u201cAre you in a hurry? You can sit.\u201dI pointed at the chair in front of me. Before I received this item, I wanted to do a quick test.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dHe sat down without complaint.I took out the laptop I bought from my bag. Yesterday, I made some changes to this laptop. Right, I could use the laptop to modify the laptop itself.\u201cAre you doing something?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe man tilted his head.\u201cWhy are you tapping on air?\u201d\u201c\u2026You can\u2019t see this?\u201dI lifted up my laptop.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe looked at me as if I was crazy.I see, I had a bit of a suspicion, but it seemed I was right. Only I could see this laptop.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m kidding.\u201dThat was fine with me.I turned the laptop on. The additional setting I put into my laptop was this.[When Kim Hajin is within 50m of a target with an altered setting, the content and summary of the change will be sent to Kim Hajin\u2019s laptop.][*Does not work on targets past a certain level of importance.]The reason I added this setting was because I thought it would be more efficient if I was told about a change through an objective medium rather than having to notice it and then being told by the co-author.Either because the co-author didn\u2019t care or because he encouraged the modification I made, I only had to pay 200 SP.[A change in setting has been detected.]And currently, there was an alert in the laptop as expected.[Jin Sechan \u2013 His feelings for Yoo Yeonha has been deepened.]I didn\u2019t mind this change.\u201cAnyways, I\u2019ll take a look now.\u201dI opened the suitcase.Click. Click.With an elegant sound, the case opened. A brilliant light erupted from the inside.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dSitting on top of a fancy red velvet was a platinum handgun and a magazine. It was even more beautiful than what I saw in the picture.\u201cAs promised, it\u2019s the Desert Eagle with full attachments and a 60-round magazine of pinnacle grade magic bullets.\u201d\u201cThank you. You can go now.\u201dI no longer cared about Jin Sechan. Using my laptop, I checked my new weapon\u2019s setting.===[Desert Eagle][High rank] [Metal attribute]A masterpiece handgun. Contains several added effects.\u300cAttack Power Amplification \u2013 1/10\u300d\u300cLow rank Weight Reduction Magic\u300d\u300cIntermediate rank Recoil Control Magic\u300d======[Magic Bullet][Pinnacle grade] [Null attribute].44 Macon steel mana bullet with condensed high-purity mana.\u300cAttack Power \u2013 4/10\u300d===I felt much better being able to read their descriptions.Without having to modify the gun or the bullet, I felt like I could easily kill a low-intermediate rank monster. I should also be able to take Aether from the devil\u2019s nest in Suwon.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, take care.\u201dAfter sending Jin Sechan off, I checked the amount of SP I had left.250.Now, how should I spend this?**After leaving the coffee shop, Jin Sechan contacted Yoo Yeonha. She asked as soon as she picked up the call.\u2014Did you deliver the item?\u201cYes.\u201d\u2014Was there anything special about him?\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dThere wasn\u2019t anything 'special\u201d, but there was something he found strange. No matter how much he thought about it, the man\u2019s demeanor wasn\u2019t what a 17 year old should have. Not to mention, it was almost as if he knew who Jin Sechan was\u2026\u2014Yes?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026No. There wasn\u2019t anything special in particular.\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t come to a decision with just that short exchange. After all, he was Cube\u2019s cadet. Even Yoo Yeonha had an air of dignity and elegance that didn\u2019t suit her age.\u2014Yes, I understand. Thank you for your work, Sechan-ssi.\u201cMy pleasure.\u201dWith that, the call ended.Though he wanted to talk a little longer, he decided to be content.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Connections (1)\u201c\u2026170,000 won?\u201dMy tone went up at the unexpected price.The Portal worker retorted unfazed.\u201cYes. From Seoul to Gangwondo Wonju, it\u2019s 170,000 won.\u201dUnlike from Cube to Seoul, going to Seoul to Gangwondo had a price. I bought my card with me, but 170,000 won wasn\u2019t a small amount to pay, especially now, when I was trying to save money.\u201cMm\u2026\u201d\u201cCustomer, there are people waiting in line.\u201dThe female Portal worker gave a cold warning. Looking around, I could indeed see many people waiting in line. Seeing as how they each had a weapon with them, it seemed we had the same objective.\u201cUm\u2026 Can something be done with this?\u201dBefore I reluctantly paid the price, I showed her my Cube Cadet Card. I remembered Kim Soohyuk saying something about Cube cadets having benefits, but because this wasn\u2019t a setting I made, I wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about the specifics.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dThe Portal worker sighed as though she was annoyed but still accepted the card. But in the next moment, her eyes widened and a much brighter voice came back.\u201cAh, you\u2019re a Cube cadet. Cadets are allowed 6 free passes per month.\u201d\u201cOh really? That\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cWould you like to use one?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Portal worker then took my wrist and stamped a seal.I was genuinely surprised at her complete change in attitude. It seemed being a Hero really was one of the best jobs in this world.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYes, have a safe trip, Kim Hajin cadet-nim.\u201dThe female Portal worker had even memorized my name.With a bitter smile, I walked into the Portal.**Gangwondo Wonju\u2019s scenery could be summarized with just a sentence.\u201cSo many foreigners.\u201dJust like in my setting, Wonju was a global city. Although its buildings were limited in height due to the threat of monsters, the city was filled with sturdy modern structures. Foreigners of all skin color walked around with their weapons, while agency employees, who supported them, busily tapped on their tablets. They were likely calculating the price of the day\u2019s haul.While different from Seoul and Busan, it was indeed an unusual scene.\u201cWe took down a good amount today. How much do I get?\u201dHearing a clumsy Korean, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.English and Korean were this world\u2019s shared language. Naturally, this showed Korea\u2019s importance and authority in the international community. While this sounded great for Korea, Korea was only a step away from hell.The Korean Peninsula endlessly produced new Towers and Dungeons. The textbook contained several explanations for it. There was one scientific and geological explanation that I couldn\u2019t understand, and there was also a more religious explanation that said Korea was blessed or cursed by the heaven. In truth, neither was close to the real reason.In any case, the Korean Peninsula\u2019s numerous Towers and Dungeons produced many monsters. Had it not been for Heroes who could turn them into marketable resources, Korea would have long been destroyed.However, the Nine Stars, who were nine of the strongest Heroes, had five members who were Korean. One of them even served as Korea\u2019s 20th President. Any further explanation wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201cYou killed three hobgoblins, so after taxes and processing fees, it should be about 600,000 won.\u201dUnder the tax law, foreigners had to pay more in taxes. Even so, foreign mercenaries and Heroes flocked to Korea, because the hunting process was safe enough to make up for the high taxes.If things became dangerous during a hunt, one could simply send out a distress call, and Heroes or agents would arrive in less than three minutes. Korea was the only country in the world with such a system.\u201cTake this. You\u2019ll feel better afterward. It\u2019s a troll blood potion.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dSeeing the world my setting created, I walked through the streets.The city was full of interesting things \u2013 blacksmith\u2019s workshop, potion store, alcohol bar, etc. With shops that looked like they belonged in the Middle Ages operating in modern buildings, it felt like I was in a game world.The sentence, \u2018Wonju is a famous tourist city,\u2019 which I wrote without much thought, seemed to have caused this setting.I continued walking and before I noticed, I was at the entrance of the \u2018Field.\u2019 There were many people already waiting nearby. I would have to go to Hamgyong Province if I wanted to hunt in a quiet place, but Hamgyong province was too dangerous for the current me.\u201cE-Excuse me?\u201dJust when I was about to enter, someone struck up a conversation.It was a tall, average-looking man with slouched shoulders and circular glasses.I didn\u2019t know him. He was likely an agent.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAre you perhaps here to hunt monsters?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you an agent?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, here\u2019s my business card.\u201dI took the business card for now. I didn\u2019t know who he was, but an agent was necessary to sell monsters\u2019 bodies.But when I looked at the name and the company logo written on the business card, I doubted my eyes.[SH Agent Head Manager, Park Soohyuk]\u201c\u2026 Mr. Park Soohyuk?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, nice to meet you.\u201dThe man smiled as he tidied up his shabby clothes.Park Soohyuk. I knew who he was. Indeed, he looked similar to how I described him in my novel.Park Soohyuk should be the most-appearing agent in the novel, as SH Agent would become Korea\u2019s greatest agency.\u201cHaha, you might not have heard of me. I started this work not too long ago.\u201dBut for now, he didn\u2019t seem to be doing too well.I smiled.Connections were one of the most important aspects of life. A person\u2019s future was often the result of ill-relationships and good-relationships one made.As this world was still in its early stage, there were many who were currently weak but would become prosperous in the future. The best way to get close to a famous person was to become friends before that person became famous.\u201cSH Agent, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard of it before\u2026\u201dThe only thing that bothered me was that this connection was supposed to be Kim Suho\u2019s.But since agents usually had multiple clients, it was probably fine.\u201cIt feels like a trustworthy name.\u201d\u201cHa, haha, thank you.\u201d\u201cAh, by the way\u2026\u201dI took out my laptop naturally and checked for any changes in Park Soohyuk\u2019s setting. Thankfully, there were none, meaning his extraordinary ability was unchanged.\u201cMy main weapon is a gun. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think why that would be a problem. Gun or sword, mercenary or hunter, it doesn\u2019t matter to me! New customers are always welcome!\u201dPark Soohyuk put his hand out with a bright smile.**Eight bullets were loaded in my gun. Each pinnacle grade magic bullet cost about 150,000 won. Since each low-rank monster went for 300~400,000 won, I couldn\u2019t use more than one bullet per monster due to agent fee I would have to pay.With that in mind, I walked into the Field.Park Soohyuk followed me from behind. It seemed he was in a desperate time considering the fact that agents without a vehicle usually waited outside the Field.\u201cAh, there\u2019s one there.\u201dAfter about 30 minutes of wandering around, we finally encountered a monster.A large body and protruding teeth, it was a low-rank grade 9 monster called an iron hog. The \u2018iron\u2019 part of its name wasn\u2019t because it was covered in iron, but because its skin was stronger than iron.\u201cI think we should ignore that one.\u201dWhen I began to approach it, Park Soohyuk held me back. I asked.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dPark Soohyuk\u2019s eyes seemed to say, \u2018Do I need to explain this too?\u2019\u201cYou can\u2019t kill an iron hog with a gun. Even piercing its outer skin will be difficult.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s expensive.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe price of a monster faithfully followed the law of a free market economy. Monsters like the undead gave no benefits and thus had no value. Consequently, monsters like these were subsidized by the government\u201cEven if it\u2019s expensive, attacking it isn\u2019t a good\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201dI took out my Desert Eagle and aimed it forward. The gun barrel shined under the blazing sun.\u201cW-W-Wait just one min\u2014\u201dPark Soohyuk made a fuss in a fluster, but I didn\u2019t hesitate. I pulled the trigger. The bullet shot straight to the middle of the iron hog\u2019s head, and before the hog could even notice it, it tore through its iron-like skin. There was nothing it could do with its brain shot through. It helplessly fell down.\u201cPerfect.\u201dBoth the power of the weapon and my skill were satisfactory. I had struck the iron hog\u2019s vital point with pinpoint accuracy.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dNext to me, Park Soohyuk exclaimed in awe.Oh, and by the way, the setting I added to my Desert Eagle was simple and effective.===[When a monster is one-shot killed by the Desert Eagle, its attack power is amplified.]\u2014Using low-intermediate rank as the standard, 1% attack power increase per kill.\u2014Repeated killing of same ranked monsters will slightly lower the amount of attack power increase.===By putting in a restriction that required me to put in an effort, I\u2019d added a comparatively good effect for the SP I spent.\u201cSo? Clean, isn\u2019t it?\u201dOnce again, I felt certain about my choice of weapon. Sniping from afar without getting close, it was the perfect hunting method with low risk and low tension.\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s a great gun! Your sharpshooting is amazing too.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m flattered.\u201dI spoke as I pointed at the iron hog\u2019s corpse.\u201cSo how much will this go for? It looks pretty expensive.\u201d\u201cWell, iron hogs are already pricey and since this corpse is in such a good condition, even after the fees, it should be at least 600\u2026 no, 800,000 won.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cHold on. Let me store the corpse first.\u201dPark Soohyuk took out a pouch from his bag. It should be a magical pouch with a space expansion magic.Seeing him struggle to put the hog in the pouch, I grabbed the hog\u2019s front leg.\u201cI\u2019ll help out.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 This is really heavy.\u201dBut thinking about it now, my strength stat wasn\u2019t that high either.\u201cUuk, uk, god.\u201d\u201cWow, it really is heavy.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you an agent? Should you have known this beforehand?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll hold its hind legs. You hold the front. Wait, don\u2019t we have to carry the pouch around afterward?\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry, anything inside the pouch will have its weight cut in half.\u201d\u201c\u2026Only half?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Indeed, Kim Suho only met Park Soohyuk in his third year. Park Soohyuk was in a bad state even then, so now\u2026 well, I could only be thankful that he hasn\u2019t starved to death.\u201cUgh.\u201d\u201cUuu.\u201d\u201cCome on, put more strength into it.\u201d\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t have lunch\u2026\u201dAfter an hour of groaning and moaning, we finally managed to stuff the hog in the pouch.\u201cWhew\u2026\u201dI collapsed on the ground, exhausted. My strength and stamina stat had to have increased with that.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s already 7.\u201dBefore I noticed, the sun had set and darkness had descended on the Field. A fearsome cold enveloped my body.From the looks of it, today\u2019s hunt would end with this one kill.Though I felt a little regret at the huge waste of time, I wasn\u2019t too sad since I got to make a valuable connection.\u201cSo how do we bring this back?\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. If it looks like we really can\u2019t, we just have to call 119[1]. We only need to reimburse them for the trip.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ingenious\u2026\u201dWe laughed together. At that moment\u2026\u201c\u2026Hold on.\u201dRustle.\u00a0A faint sound rang out from a tree.\u201cShh.\u201dI took out my gun once more with my index finger over my mouth. Then, I fired at the direction of the sound.Thud.There was no scream. Only the sound of a beefy body crashing down rang out.\u201cHuh?

Connections (2)Friday morning. I opened my eyes while in bed. My entire body started aching immediately.Iron hog and black pelican\u2026 No matter how much I thought about it, the monsters I hunted yesterday were too heavy. Thankfully, I made it back before curfew. Otherwise, I would have faced disciplinary punishment on top of minus points.\u201cArgh.\u201dFortunately, today was Friday, so there wasn\u2019t a class that required me to use my body. Getting up tiredly, I checked my smartwatch first. There were three unseen messages.[810,130 won has been deposited.][450,270 won has been deposited.][Here is the payment for yesterday\u2019s monsters. I hope to work with you again. SH Agency Head Manager, Park Soohyuk.]The payment was quicker than I expected. If I remembered correctly, exclusive contracts had monthly payments. Mine must have been quick because it was a one-time deal. But still, to have them taken care of overnight\u2026 he sure was quick with his work. As expected of Park Soohyuk.Thanks to Park Soohyuk, I now had something to do for the day. I could now open up a brokerage account and buy Packhorse Master guild\u2019s stock. One million won sounded like a good start.I walked into the shower with various thoughts in my head.After washing away my remaining drowsiness with cold water, I dried myself, put on my cadet uniform, and headed out to class.*Friday\u2019s first period class was on \u2018Phenomenon Realm Analysis.\u2019 From what other cadets were saying, it seemed we were assigned the most difficult theory class since we didn\u2019t have physical training today. Of course, this didn\u2019t apply to me.I sat down on a random seat and took out my laptop. After finding out that only I could see it, I openly fiddled around with it in class.===\u25b7\u300cMaster Sharpshooter\u300d[Low-intermediate rank] [Spirit attribute] [Evolving \u2014 Grade 8] [Proficiency EXP 13%]\u2014Master Sharpshooter\u2019s Training*Familiarity with all long ranged weapons\u2014Thousand-Mile Eyes*Can see far away and predict a target\u2019s movement path.*Increases speed and perception by 0.3 points.\u2014Bullet Time*In combat only and once every 24 hours, you can spend 10 seconds in \u2018Bullet Time\u2019.\u2014Sharpshooter of Reversal*Depending on Kim Hajin\u2019s invariable stat, \u2018luck\u2019, you can deal bonus damage against a stronger enemy.===Sharpshooter of Reversal, a low ranked skill I got from defeating a Djinn, was quite decent. Master Sharpshooter had also reached grade 8. Of course, its growth speed would decrease the higher its grade went.\u201cSit down.\u201dWhile I was observing my growth in delight, the professor walked in.\u201cThere is a written exam today like I mentioned last time.\u201dA test was announced out of the blue. Heartfelt groans erupted from the cadets. It seemed I wasn\u2019t the only one only now hearing about this.\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t study at all!\u201dIn front of me, Chae Nayun muttered in despair. Kim Suho, who was sitting next to her, promptly showed her the notes I took down yesterday. Chae Nayun coughed in embarrassment.\u201cNow, now, quiet down.\u201dThe professor silenced the cadets in a heartless tone before handing out the exam sheet. After a few scuffling sounds of paper, I also received an exam sheet.Problem 1. Describe the monster, \u2018Pygmalion\u2019.Problem 2. Describe the Nine Evils (Djinns).Problem 3. State the attributes that humans can manifest in the Phenomenon Realm.Problem 4\u2026.The problems\u2019 difficulty and ambiguity were higher than what I had imagined. Other cadets also sighed the moment they glanced at the problems. But I was different. I had answers to all of the problems on my laptop.[Pygmalions are Fallen Ghosts whose intelligence exceeds that of humans. They cannot be seen in the Phenomenon Realm, and they act as humans after possessing them. Because of this behavior, some argue that they should be classified as a Djinn \u2026]Of course, I would get the problem wrong if any of their settings were changed, but that was even better. It meant I would learn more about settings that had changed.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAfter I was almost done writing all the answers\u2026\u201cWhat happened?\u201dMy laptop suddenly shut down. That is, my lifeline shut down. I began to sweat from the unexpected occurrence. And because I was in the middle of an exam, there wasn\u2019t anything I could do. Then, blue words suddenly appeared on the LCD screen.[A month has passed.][The laptop\u2019s functionality will be updated.][Target Kim Hajin\u2019s Observation and Reading Gift will be strengthened.]**There was a meeting on every even-numbered Fridays. Yoo Yeonha called this social leadership meeting, Noble Society.Yoo Yeonha wanted Noble Society to be a source of vital connections once she graduated, but Chae Nayun, who was the most important connection, didn\u2019t have much thought about it. To Chae Nayun, Noble Society was like an alumni reunion, where she met with her childhood friends.Today\u2019s Noble Society meeting was at a coffee shop in Seoul.\u201cHow are your grades?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good enough.\u201d\u201cThe Jonghak I know isn\u2019t content unless he gets first place.\u201dOnly Shin Jonghak and Yoo Yeonha were in the coffee shop. No other customers were present. It was a popular coffee shop, but Yoo Yeonha had talked to the owner to rent the place out.\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s good enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, okay.\u201dClang\u2014The bell on the coffee shop\u2019s door rang. Yoo Yeonha and Shin Jonghak turned towards the door.It was Chae Nayun, who was wearing Chae Nayun-like clothes \u2013 blue jeans and a black jacket over a slightly see-through white shirt. She walked like a man, but her elegant figure was more charming than any other woman.\u201cChae Nayun, you came today?\u201dShin Jonghak waved his hand in greeting. Chae Nayun walked over and spoke after looking around the shop.\u201cHey, where did your lackeys go?\u201dIn Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes, Shin Jonghak was the type of person who liked to bring around lackeys. These followers of Shin Jonghak were generally sons of large corporations or guilds, and despite Shin Jonghak labeling them as \u2018friends\u2019, the hierarchy in their relationship was clear for anyone to see.\u201cThey\u2019re training. Midterms are soon.\u201d\u201cOh, those guys also prepare for exams?\u201dChae Nayun made a snarky comment and sat down.\u201cRather than that, how did you do on the last written exam?\u201d\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that you asked whether the other guys were preparing for exams.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s different. I\u2019m talking about the combat exam. Who cares if you\u2019re good at theory\u2026\u201dUnlike when he was with Yoo Yeonha, Shin Jonghak actively brought up conversation topics. Chae Nayun\u2019s replies were no different than usual.Yoo Yeonha watched the two talk quietly. She didn\u2019t think much of it. They were just talking as friends. But the look on Shin Jonghak\u2019s face when he was talking to Chae Nayun, his soft smile, and kind eyes, didn\u2019t come to Yoo Yeonha too pleasantly.Krrk.Yoo Yeonha lightly clenched her teeth and grabbed the cup of coffee she ordered for Chae Nayun. Because she ordered it thirty minutes ago, it was lukewarm. She released her magic power into the cup, heating the coffee.\u201cBy the way, do you know Kim Hajin?\u201dBut at that moment, her focus completely scattered and her ears opened up. Yoo Yeonha inadvertently joined the conversation.\u201cKim Hajin?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026What about him?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s face became severely distorted.\u201cWhat do you think about that bastard, Yeonha?\u201dYoo Yeonha felt her heart drop. Kim Hajin. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have had to think about someone like Kim Hajin. Even if she did, her assessment of him would have been \u2018I don\u2019t care\u2019 or \u2018That crazy psycho.\u2019But the circumstance had changed.There was something about him. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what, but he wasn\u2019t so simple. But Yoo Yeonha purposefully hid her inner thoughts.\u201c\u2026What do you mean? He\u2019s just an average guy.\u201d\u201cNo, nevermind.\u201dChae Nayun grabbed her cup of coffee roughly. Yoo Yeonha swallowed her saliva at Chae Nayun\u2019s strange reaction.\u201cThat bastard is hiding something for sure.\u201d\u201cWhat are you so angry about?\u201dThis time, Shin Jonghak asked. His face was full of smiles, as though he enjoyed seeing an angry Chae Nayun.\u201cYou don\u2019t know? There was a Djinn at the National Weapons Museum during the recent monster incident in Seoul. Then, that bastard\u2026\u201dWith that, Chae Nayun gulped down her coffee. She then immediately spurted it out.\u201cAak! Fuck, it\u2019s hot! Water! water!\u201dPanting, she looked for cold water. Yoo Yeonha carefully consoled her, feeling a knot in her heart being loosened.\u201c\u2026Nayun, that\u2019s coffee, not cold water.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed, have you?\u201dShin Jonghak laughed, while an employee quickly ran over with cold water.\u201cH-Here.\u201dChae Nayun quickly grabbed it and gulped it down.\u201cAagh, I burned my tongue.\u201dThen, she caught her breath before continuing where she left off.\u201cAnyways, that Djinn was stronger than Kim Suho and I thought. Even I\u2026\u201dAt that point, Chae Nayun paused once more and watched her two listeners. Because what happened back then was embarrassing, she didn\u2019t want to talk about it in detail.\u201c\u2026Even I struggled a bit. Kim Suho\u2019s a different story, but how can an ordinary cadet like him deal such fatal damage to a Djinn?\u201d\u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to explain it in detail. Just know that he blew up a Djinn\u2019s arm. With a gun at that! A gun! How does that make sense?\u201dBlowing up a Djinn\u2019s arm with a gun. Indeed, it was hard to believe without seeing it in person.Yoo Yeonha pondered as she rubbed her chin. She\u2019d seen Kim Hajin fight. It was true that he was quick, but it was hard to say he had the attack power to break a Djinn\u2019s arm.\u201cAh wait.\u201dAt that moment, Chae Nayun suddenly put on a serious tone. Her eyes looked nervous and she seemed hesitant to speak. Naturally, Shin Jonghak and Yoo Yeonha\u2019s attention fell on her.\u201cCould it be that he\u2019s\u2026 a Djinn?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nayun, if he was a Djinn, he wouldn\u2019t have attacked a fellow Djinn.\u201dBut Yoo Yeonha quickly broke the atmosphere with a sentence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. Anyways, there\u2019s something about that guy.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you don\u2019t like him?\u201dAt that moment, Shin Jonghak, who was listening without a word, broke his silence. Chae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha both understood the hidden meaning behind his words.Chae Nayun pondered on how to answer. She knew Shin Jonghak\u2019s personality well. Depending on her answer, that man\u2019s future would change noticeably.After a bit of contemplation, Chae Nayun replied briefly.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure, but something like that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Connections (3)[Updating in progress\u2026 79%]Currently, it was 9 A.M., Saturday.Clearly, my laptop was still dead. It only went up by 79% in a whole day. I wondered what amazing new features it would get. On the other hand, I was dying of anxiousness as I waited.I was staring at the laptop\u2019s update percentage when my smartwatch rang.[Brokerage account for Kim Hajin has opened.]\u201cOh, it\u2019s done!\u201dI was also concerned about this too. It would have been easy if I was an adult, but I was still a minor. Just like in the previous world, a minor couldn\u2019t open a brokerage account without a guardian\u2019s agreement. If I wasn\u2019t a cadet at Cube, it would have been impossible to open an brokerage account.Now that I had an account, I immediately began to work.First, using my smartwatch, I moved money over to my new brokerage account. One million won from the previous monster hunt and two million won that I already had, a total of three million. It was a pocket change compared to what many of the other traders had, but it was enough to get me started. I opened the stock trading program. The guild stock market operated on weekends to differentiate them from the normal stock market.[Guild \u2014 Packhorse Master]The Packhorse Master guild was listed on the exchange. Each stock was worth 170 won.Since I wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about complicated things like short stock selling, short stock buying, and price fluctuation, I simply bought however much I could.[17,647 stocks of \u2018Packhorse Master\u2019 guild purchased.]It didn\u2019t take long.But since it felt a bit weird to just leave, I looked up a stock-related forum board.[Gathering of people who enjoy stock exchange.]With 930,000 members, this was the biggest forum for stock-related topics.I searched for Packhorse Master.[List of new guilds.][Guilds newly listed][Guild market is hard nowadays \u315c\u315c None of the new guilds look promising\u2026]None of the posts were specifically about Packhorse Master, only mentioning it briefly.\u201cWell, what did I expect from an online forum\u2026?\u201dI clicked my tongue and turned off the smartwatch. In this world where information was equivalent to money, even the existence of a website had to be found out through money. Thus, expert brokers did not even spare a glance at free-to-use online forums.Information guilds had their own intranets where one could buy information, and those who wished to stay secret would use something like the Violet Banquet\u2026\u201cOh, right.\u201dSpeaking of staying in secret, there was one group inhabiting the dark.Chameleon Troupe.First revealed halfway through the story, the Chameleon Troupe was the most powerful gang in my novel, whose members would play an important part until the late stages of the novel. The group\u2019s name was derived from a chameleon\u2019s ability to camouflage. Just like how a chameleon changed its color to hide, the Chameleon Troupe was a secretive group whose members\u2019 identities remained absolutely hidden.As of now, one seat of the Chameleon Troupe was empty. This seat would remain open for another year or two, and come to play an important role in the story.I knew who the Chameleon Troupe\u2019s leader was and where she operated. Other than Chameleon Troupe\u2019s members, I should be the only one who knew this information.Chameleon Troupe was a gang of criminals, but they also rejected Djinns. And in this world, Djinns were the absolute evil. If I could become Chameleon Troupe\u2019s member\u2026 well, that was unrealistic, so if I could at least become friends with its leader, I might be able to transform them into a supporting role\u2026Just when I was thinking such things\u2026\u201cUk!\u201dCompletely out of the blue, an intense pain emerged on my left upper arm.It was as though a heated knife was carving my skin. Blood spurted out from my arm, hitting my widened eyes. I hurriedly pulled up my sleeve. A strange scar was being drawn on my upper arm.\u201cThe hell\u2026\u201dIt was an incomprehensible scar and pain. I clenched my teeth and put my hand over the scar gushing with blood. At the same time, a tsunami of information flooded into my brain.[This Stigma is one of the authorities of the Creator.

The early spring weather was a chilly, but still had a bit of warmth to it. But I was unable to enjoy this beautiful day to myself, as I was summoned to go to Seoul\u2019s \u2018Association Tower\u2019.It was to receive commendation for subjugating the Djinn in the recent incident.\u2026Really, couldn\u2019t they just come to give it themselves?The conferment ceremony took place at a garden in Association Tower, and many people were already gathered by the time I arrived. However, the conferment ceremony seemed nowhere close to starting. Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, and I were forced into a ceremony rehearsal because we would receive our commendations from a dignitary, but the dignitary himself was late and we were forced to wait.Because Chae Nayun was next to me, it felt like I was sitting on needles.\u201c\u2026Haaam.\u201d\u201cHappy?\u201dOnce. I yawned once because I was bored. But Chae Nayun, who was looking for an excuse to pick a fight, finally shot back at me. I retorted briefly.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve had a smirk for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was unfair that she could look so pretty while making such remarks.I planned to stay silent at first, but I suddenly remembered the reason I was here.\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget, did you?\u201d\u201cForget what?\u201dEach of her words was covered in thorns. I spoke as I stared into her eyes.\u201cThat I saved you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe still looked angry, but she shut her mouth at a loss for words.\u201cThat\u2019s that and this is\u2026\u201d\u201cStop, both of you.\u201dAfter a momentary contemplation, Chae Nayun opened her mouth to strike back, when Kim Suho cut in.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201cChae Nayun, switch seats with me.\u201dFor the record, our seats were ordered: Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, then me.\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201d\u201cNo, why, I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201dSeeing them getting all touchy didn\u2019t feel too good.Thankfully, their obscene(?) scuffle quickly ended, and Kim Suho replaced the seat next to me.Kim Suho looked at me and let out a dry cough.\u201cThank you for back then.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI was struck dumb with amazement. I wanted to be left alone, so why was he still talking to me?\u201cBack at the museum, if it wasn\u2019t for you, we wouldn\u2019t have won.\u201d\u201cNo, you would have won even without me.\u201dIf I wasn\u2019t there back then, Kim Suho might have awakened an even higher-dimensional power. Main characters always became strong through hardships and dangers.\u201c\u2026.No.\u201dWith that single word, Kim Suho turned his gaze back.At that moment, an extraordinary undulation of magic power rang out.The \u2018dignitary\u2019 had finally arrived.\u201cH-He\u2019s here. Everyone get ready!\u201dHe was today\u2019s commendation conferrer, the Master rank Hero titled \u2018Wolf of Valhalla\u2019.His shoulder-length hair was curved up slightly, and he had a well-trimmed beard uncommon for an Eastern man. The regality given off by his extraordinary appearance wasn\u2019t limited to an invisible feeling. As though a wind was blowing, each of his steps caused a thin undulation of magic power. His raw power had already reached a realm where even he couldn\u2019t fully control it.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dLooking around the room with his wolf-like eyes, the Master rank Hero, Yoo Sihyuk, murmured quietly.\u201cThese fuckers telling me what to do\u2026\u201dIt was so quiet that only I could hear it with my Gift. With a moderate arrogance and a lethargic attitude, Yoo Sihyuk pushed back the guests flocking towards him.He walked up to the podium commandingly. His attendants ran up and handed him a paper which listed the order of the ceremony. Clicking his tongue, Yoo Sihyuk glanced at the paper before he threw it away. His attendants took the discarded paper and ran off.\u2014Now, the conferment ceremony will begin.The host announced the start of the ceremony.\u2014The commendation will be conferred by the rank 37 Master rank Hero, Sir Yoo Sihyuk.As we rehearsed, Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, and I walked up to the podium.Yoo Sihyuk smirked as soon as he saw Kim Suho.\u201cAre you Kim Suho?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMm. I can see why those guys want you.\u201dIntense interest was reflected in Yoo Sihyuk\u2019s eyes. With an unusual kindness, Yoo Sihyuk advised Kim Suho.\u201cDon\u2019t join the Association. It might even be better to join the Vast Expanse and become a hunter. Being a Hero is nothing but a baggage of responsibility and no fun.\u201d\u201c\u2026Still, a Hero fits my personality best.\u201dKim Suho revealed a clear refusal with a smile. In response, the corner of Yoo Sihyuk\u2019s mouth twisted up.\u201cYou\u2019re a boring guy. Fine\u2026 And you, it\u2019s been a while, eh?\u201dThis time, it was Chae Nayun. When her eyes met him, she made a bitter expression.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cYour father told me to take care you, but I don\u2019t plan on doing that.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Master\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not your master. A bow user like you think you can call me Master? Do you want to die?\u201dAt his open reproach, Chae Nayun only stuck out her mouth in a pout.

It was so quick that I didn\u2019t even have time to feel wronged.\u201cOh, by the way\u2026\u201dYoo Sihyuk, who was about to leave the garden, suddenly stopped as though he remembered something.\u201cThe reward for the Djinn subjugation is 15 million won.

We\u2019ll meet again if chance allows it.\u201dYoo Sihyuk then left with a bored smile.We saw him off with our eyes, then came down from the podium. Before we could even touch the ground, guild associates flocked towards us.However, they were only interested in Kim Suho and Chae Nayun. No one approached me. They most likely thought I was only lucky to have been with them at the time of the incident.But that didn\u2019t mean I was disappointed. Such was the life of an extra.But my face automatically reddened at the clear ostracization, and thus I quickly left the venue.**I ran away to a nearby coffee shop. After ordering a drink, I sat down and turned on my laptop.The reason was simple. I had not checked the laptop\u2019s new functionality yet. I didn\u2019t have the time. Yesterday, I fainted at the pain that came with the update\u2019s completion, and when I woke up, I was dragged to the conferment ceremony.[Updated Features]\u25b7\u2019Book of Truth\u2019 has been added to the Gift, \u300cObservation and Reading\u300d\u25b7Internet has been added to the laptop.\u25b7Stigma.There were three new features.

It was a hacking tool in a way.Among the numerous websites, a specific name caught my attention.===\u25b7Violet Banquet*Website for trading undisclosed information, weapons, bounties, and commissions.*SP needed for obtaining an ID: 200===Violet Banquet.It was the most famous website in the dark web. Still, it had over a million members. The real pearl of Violet Banquet wasn\u2019t the website, but its \u2018sellers\u2019. Violet Banquet was only a place for them to gather.Plentiful sellers flocked at the anonymous information, weapons, bounties, and commission trading website, which didn\u2019t care for the law. While the government knew about this underground market, they had no choice but to stay silent as this black market was frequented by almost all Heroes. As a joke, a Hero wasn\u2019t called a true Hero unless one had a Violet Banquet membership.Naturally, one needed to pay an enormous sum to become Violet Banquet\u2019s member, but I only needed 200 SP to obtain an ID.\u201cAh, there you are.\u201dIt was at that moment that a charming voice and scent flowed towards me. Just by hearing the voice, I could tell who it was. I immediately straightened my back and focused on the movement behind me.The owner of the voice then walked over and sat down on the seat in front of me in a smooth motion.It was Yun Seung-Ah.\u201cYou know me, right?\u201dHer eyes formed an arc as she stared at me.\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201dYun Seung-Ah asked again. I shook my head. There were few people in this world who didn\u2019t know \u2018vice-leader Yun Seung-Ah.\u2019\u201cNo, I know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I was surprised because you suddenly disappeared. There was something I wanted to give you.\u201dYun Seung-Ah handed me her business card, which was adorned with gold.[Guild, Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace, vice-leader Yun Seung-Ah.]While I sat speechless looking at the business card, Yun Seung-Ah continued.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot I want to talk about, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t have enough time. I spent too long looking for you, Hajin cadet-nim.\u201dYun Seung-Ah giving out her business card wasn\u2019t a simple matter. It was the first step of Yun Seung-Ah style recruiting I outlined in my novel.\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to ask. Can I?\u201dI stared at Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s eyes. Her beautiful brown pupils were absolutely calm.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDid you destroy the Djinns\u2026 Hm?\u201dYun Seung-Ah might look kind and graceful on media, but in truth, she was extremely cold-hearted. Even talents she eagerly brought in were thrown away if they didn\u2019t meet her expectations. Bringing in what\u2019s necessary and throwing away what isn\u2019t. Survival of the fittest was Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s true mindset, which wasn\u2019t known to the media. It was her belief that a lazy person would continue to be lazy and a person falling behind would continue to fall behind.\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201dI gave back her business card.\u201cEh? Um, Hajin cadet-nim? I think you\u2019re misunderstanding something. I\u2019m interested in you, as the vice-leader of a rank 1 guild.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful for your interest, but only if that\u2019s real interest.\u201dWith what I knew about Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s personality, she should be here because I used a light attribute bullet.The interest she had in me was only curiosity. With a single gust of wind, her interest could cool down, and she could even forget my name. So, for the sake of SP, playing hard to get would probably be more memorable.\u201cI\u2019ll be off. There\u2019s a lot I need to do. It\u2019s almost time for midterm exams, you see.\u201dI got up before Yun Seung-ah. Her surprised eyes chased after me.I quickly left the coffee shop.What Yun Seung-Ah was thinking now was none of my business.**1 P.M.The reward money had arrived by the time I came back to the dorm. It was a clean 15 million won, unaffected by taxes. It was clear what I had to do with it. Without hesitation, I purchased Packhorse Master\u2019s stocks. With over 100,000 stocks, I was likely a majority shareholder.\u201cHuhu\u2026 Ah, right.\u201dI suddenly remembered what I didn\u2019t finish in the coffee shop. The two other features of the update \u2013 Book of Truth and Stigma.First, I looked at \u2018Stigma.\u2019[You can freely use the magic power stored inside Stigma, which will slowly regenerate over 24 hours even if depleted.]\u201c\u2026So how do I use it?\u201dThere was a tattoo-like Stigma on my left upper arm. But Stigma aside, I couldn\u2019t even wield the magic power in my body.Furthermore, it was likely that I would never be able to wield it, as I described magic power in my novel as an \u201cability in which innate talent and early education is most important.\u201dBut this was likely the reason why the co-author gave me such an irregular magic power.\u201cI can freely use it\u2026?\u201dSince it said I could \u2018freely\u2019 use it, I thought about using it.That was all I did.Immediately, Stigma\u2019s magic power became unleashed. Blue light erupted from the Stigma, enveloping my upper arm. The magic power then flowed down my veins, reaching my fingertips before shooting out and manifesting into shapes. First, it formed a triangle, then a circle, then a blade.Its mysteriousness multiplied when I thought about the Book of Truth.The magic power branched together and formed a single book. The book\u2019s cover waved as though it was made of water. I glanced at my veins, which had turned blue, and the strange book that had formed in the air.At that moment, a strange voice rang out in my ear.[This book contains truth. Ask it anything. It will answer as long as you have enough magic power.]\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s how this works.\u201dThe words, \u201cas long as you have enough magic power\u201d, hung on my mind, but it was undoubtedly a great Gift.When I was about to ask it something as a test\u2026Wiing\u2014 Wiing\u2014 Wiing\u2014An emergency alarm rang out on my smartwatch.The sound was similar to a phone\u2019s disaster alert, it couldn\u2019t be ignored. I put my magic power away and turned on my smartwatch.[Looking for the last person who has last seen World class\u2019 novice cadet, \u2018Jin Hajung\u2019.][Looking for the last person who has last seen World class\u2019 novice cadet, \u2018Jin Hajung\u2019.]I immediately knew what was happening.The next arc had begun. The name of this arc was \u2018Cube\u2019s Serial Disappearance Incident\u2019. As the word \u2018serial\u2019 suggested, there would be six victims during the course of this arc.This arc played a fairly important role in the story.The sole reason being that Yoo Yeonha was the final victim. This was the decisive trigger that would bring Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha closer together.[Hello.]Speaking of the devil, Yoo Yeonha suddenly messaged me.[What?][The text from just now, that isn\u2019t your doing, right?]Was she insane?[No, why?][Then nevermind.][Alright.][By the way, I heard you fought a Djinn last week.][\u2026What are you trying to say?]Changing the topic over and over again until the other side brought up the topic she wanted to talk about, that was Yoo Yeonha\u2019s specialty.[Do you know about the Giant Swamp Soldier?]I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. It seemed she wanted me to tell her its vital point.The Giant Swamp Soldier was a high-rank monster known for its 30m height. Just like its name suggested, it was rare sight in Korea, as Korea didn\u2019t have large swamps. By the looks of it, her guild must have gotten information about its location.[I wouldn\u2019t tell you even if I knew.]There shouldn\u2019t be many guilds in the country who knew about the Giant Swamp Soldier\u2019s vital point.[I can buy the information.][No.]I cut her off resolutely. Mountain Tyrant was enough to serve as her \u2018accomplishment\u2019.[Why not? I can offer a lot.]It was true that Yoo Yeonha would become successful in the future, but her personality had yet to change. Currently, she didn\u2019t hesitate to mercilessly cut down her enemies. Before the right influence changed her temperament, it was dangerous to give her wings.[To be completely honest, I don\u2019t know. How would I know the vital point of a monster that doesn\u2019t appear in Korea?]And this was true. Although I was this world\u2019s author, there were things I didn\u2019t know. While I created the Giant Swamp Soldier, I only gave it a rough sketch. Since it was a golem type monster, I only thought that an attribute that countered swamps would work well against it. I never wrote any specific details down.After not replying for a long time, Yoo Yeonha ended the conversation with a single message.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[From now on, don\u2019t talk to me so casually.]\u201cPftt.\u201dA smirk emerged inadvertently.As I thought, even if Yoo Yeonha acted adult-like\u2026\u201c\u2026Still a high schooler, huh.\u201dShe was still only 17.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the form I submitted to Violet Banquet as an information seller. Now that I had a Gift like the Book of Truth, it felt like a waste to not use it.For now, I gave it a grandiose name \u2013 \u2018Truth Agency\u2019.Since reputation played a huge role in Violet Banquet, I didn\u2019t expect to get many customers to begin with. It was perfect since I didn\u2019t think my magic power would last long anyways.But in 2~3 years, Truth Agency\u2019s name would surely spread among the members, starting from small interest like \u2018Why is this still here?\u2019 or \u2018Should I give it a test since I\u2019m bored?\u2019Since I would have three or four streaks of Stigma by that time, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry about running out of magic power either.It was a risk-free, long-term investment for the future. If it worked, great. If it didn\u2019t, that was fine too.\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter looking over the form one more time, I pressed the [apply for seller] button.Now, everything was taken care of.The only thing left to do was my daily work out.I stretched and stood up.**Late night, Sunday.Kim Suho was working out at the Novice Fitness Center. Kim Suho was a regular visitor of the fitness center, but today\u2019s scenery was different than what it was at the beginning of the year. Today, the fitness center was booming with cadets. It was undoubtedly because the midterm exams were coming up.\u201cKuu.\u201dAfter finishing a set, Kim Suho looked around the place while resting. Jin Hanjun, Kim Horak, Shin Jonghak, and even Yoo Yeonha and Rachel, who were rare visitors, were there.\u201cAre you checking out girls?\u201dAt that moment, a sudden coldness touched his face. Kim Suho pulled his head back in surprise. There was only one person who would play such a prank on him. Kim Suho glared at him. Yi Yeonghan shrugged and handed him a drink.\u201cSo, are you?\u201d\u201cNo, I just\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201c\u2026I just thought it was a rare sight.\u201dKim Suho pointed at Rachel with his chin. Yi Yeonghan looked at Rachel and nodded in agreement.\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a real princess working out at a fitness center.\u201dBlonde hair that glistened brilliantly and eyes that were like refined sapphires. Her figure showed no imperfections and flaunted elegance and charm.Even while covered in sweat, she looked like she came out of a painting. The girl, Rachel, was from England\u2019s royal family and was the descendant of a noble lineage.\u201cWho do you think she\u2019ll marry in the future? Not with us, right?\u201dAt Yi Yeonghan\u2019s comments, Kim Suho smiled.\u201cIs that a sneer? What, you think you can marry her?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I was agreeing with you. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d marry someone like us.\u201d\u201cUuk!\u201dWhile the two of them joked with each other, a sudden loud grunt grabbed their attention.\u201cHuuuk!\u201dThe strange breathing sound came from a man having a life-or-death battle with a fitness equipment. However, the weight on the equipment was a pitiful amount by any cadet\u2019s standard.\u201c\u2026Is he really struggling with that?\u201dYi Yeonghan looked with pity.It wasn\u2019t just Yi Yeonghan. Almost every cadet snickered as they walked about. Kim Suho couldn\u2019t tell whether Kim Hajin was oblivious or too focused to notice, but he continued his struggle resolutely.\u201cAt least he\u2019s doing it for a long time.\u201dKim Suho replied briefly.\u201cPlease, with that weight, I can do the same thing for half a day. I\u2019m curious how he was even admitted to Cube. Even sharpshooters have a minimum physical requirement they need to meet, and wasn\u2019t he a swordsman before? Why don\u2019t I remember him? \u2026Oh, look, it\u2019s Chae Nayun.\u201dChae Nayun came out of the gravitation room at just the right moment. Covered in sweat, she was slightly staggering with an exhausted face.It looked like she was planning on heading straight back, but when she saw Kim Hajin, she stopped and began to glare at him.Jiing\u2014 Two laser beams shot out of her eyes.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s she doing?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not really on good terms.\u201dKim Suho smiled bitterly.\u201cTsk.\u201dAfter glaring at Kim Hajin for a while, Chae Nayun clicked her tongue and turned back. At the same time, her eyes met Kim Suho. She let out a dry cough as though she was embarrassed and walked towards them.\u201cHey, Kim Suho, isn\u2019t he a bit strange?\u201dWhat nonsense was she spouting now?\u201c\u2026Strange?\u201d\u201cThat bastard, he\u2019s acting.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dBoth Yi Yeonghan and Kim Suho furrowed their brows. They didn\u2019t understand what Chae Nayun was saying, but Chae Nayun glared at Kim Suho as though he was being dense.\u201c\u2026I can understand Yi Yeonghan saying this, but Kim Suho, you really are insensitive about these kinds of things.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about out of the blue?\u201d\u201cYou saw him that day and you still don\u2019t get it?\u201dIn truth, Chae Nayun\u2019s suspicion was justified.Magic power was one of the most important abilities of a Hero. In that sense, the magic power Kim Hajin displayed during the Seoul Incident was abnormal. An explosion of magic power strong enough to dye the world white for an instant\u2026A man with such level of magic power was struggling to lift a tiny weight?It just didn\u2019t make sense.As such, Kim Hajin had to be acting for whatever reason.\u2026Although the logic behind it wasn\u2019t perfectly sound, it was still a justifiable suspicion.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dYi Yeonghan stared at Kim Hajin once again.His face was red as though it was about to explode.\u201cIf that\u2019s acting, he should get an Oscar.\u201d\u201cEhew. Whatever, stay dense, you two.\u201dRight when Chae Nayun was shaking her head in disappointment, three male cadets approached Kim Hajin. Kim Suho instinctively frowned. Those three were well-known delinquents.\u201cHey, what are you doing here, loser?\u201d\u201cLook, he\u2019s struggling with this. I only need a finger to lift this.\u201dThey nudged Kim Hajin, but he didn\u2019t react in any way. Without giving them a single glance, he focused on working out.\u201cHey, are you mute? Say something.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take pictures of this son of a bitch and post it. Look at him, working all hard when he\u2019s a complete waste.\u201dAggravated, the three delinquents began to curse openly. Why live; you\u2019re a waste of money; I feel bad for your parents; you\u2019re not going to graduate anyway, so why not just leave; etc\u2026\u201c\u2026Hey, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dWatching this scene, Chae Nayun left the scene looking uncomfortable.Kim Suho got up, unable to hold himself back, but Yi Yeonghan stopped him.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust leave him be. By the looks of it, they\u2019re Shin Jonghak\u2019s lackeys. Nothing good will come of fighting them.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cPlus\u2026\u201dYi Yeonghan smiled as though he found the situation funny.\u201cWho knows? Maybe he really is acting.\u201d**When I woke up, it was Monday morning. In a daze, I thought back to what happened yesterday. Applying as an information seller on Violet Banquet, buying stocks, and working out\u2026Let\u2019s shower first.Chwaaa\u2014Cold water washed away my drowsiness.I looked at my wet body in the mirror.My body had certainly improved. My shoulders and biceps were vitalized, my abdominal muscles were well-defined, and my thighs were rock-hard. It was a robust and healthy body that I could have never achieved on Earth. I wondered, how were my stats looking like?After drying myself, I left the bathroom and turned on my laptop.===[Strength 1.835][Stamina 1.945][Speed 2.15][Perception 3.055][Vitality 1.765][Magic power 1.315]===As expected, I had grown a lot. Of course, it was still at the level of \u2018a man who worked out diligently\u2019, but at this rate, it wouldn\u2019t be long until I could take Aether from Gari Mountain.After all, the real reward of the Gari Mountain Dungeon wasn\u2019t the \u2018completion reward\u2019, but the \u2018hidden stage reward\u2019.Wiing\u2014Wiing\u2014I turned on my smartwatch before heading out to class and was immediately greeted by anonymous messages.[Retard.][Hey, coward, get ready to have your spine broken in the upcoming combat exam. I\u2019ll disable you and\u2026]\u201cThese guys again.\u201dIt seemed I was the target of bullying. I had an idea who the instigator was, but I couldn\u2019t be sure.But of course, something of this level wasn\u2019t enough to damage my 26-year-old mind. After all, I had suffered through Korea\u2019s military service. Just like the saying went, it was just kids being kids.After blocking the two fools who messaged me, I walked outside.But there were words written on the nameplate outside my door.Retard, loser, pushover\u2026 There was one more but the handwriting was too bad for me to recognize.They seemed to have been carved with magic power to avoid being detected by CCTV. For now, I really couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Since classes would begin in ten minutes, I had to hurry before I was late.*I opened the classroom door.\u201cOh, you\u2019re here, loser?\u201dImmediately, some kid I didn\u2019t even know the name of struck my head.I was starting to get a bit annoyed. Sure, it was just kids being kids, but I made sure to remember their faces. Jokes on you, the more you bully me, the more my SP increases!\u201cWhat? You mad?\u201dI didn\u2019t respond. Kim Hyuksoo. I memorized his name and ignored him.I walked past a few more sneering cadets and sat down on my usual seat. At that moment, my eyes met Chae Nayun. But she didn\u2019t show the same hostility as before. She looked at me somewhat bitterly before turning away.\u201cHey guys, the exam results are out for Phenomenon Realm Analysis.\u201dAt that moment, Yi Yeonghan walked in with an armful of large scrolls.Cube still had a traditional custom. The results of every written exam, whether small or big, were posted publicly on large posters.Yi Yeonghan put up the posters while other cadets groaned.The result was as such.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRank 1. Kim HajinRank 2. Rachel\u2026Snap.A sound similar to a chopstick snapping in half rang out. I snuck a peek behind me.Two halves of a pen rolled on the table. Next to them was the presumed owner of the pen, Rachel, who was staring at the exam results in a daze. Her mouth was half-open, as though she was shocked greatly.\u201c\u2026Oh, right.\u201dIt was then that I remembered a setting I had forgotten about.For every written exam, whether small or big, Rachel had never been pushed out of first place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Second Incident (3)Cube\u2019s classes and exams were always carried out in Korean. Even the small number of Cube\u2019s foreign professors held their classes in Korean, though their pronunciation and linguistic ability were no different than native speakers\u2019. With Korean becoming the shared language of many countries, learning Korean became an important part of many countries\u2019 culture.But a foreign language was still a foreign language. Just because Korean became a shared language, it didn\u2019t mean that learning it was any easier. To foreigners, Korean was still a difficult language to master.But even with the disadvantage of being a foreigner, Rachel could understand what the professors were saying and could write mostly correct answers on exams. It was easy to see how much effort she put into studying.As a country\u2019s royalty, she put in the effort to maintain a certain level of elegance and dignity. She wanted to become the perfect Hero in both theory and combat, and write a textbook for the English Royal Hero Academy.Naturally, the citizens of England were fanatical when it came to Rachel. They were proud, saying that it was finally time for a Master rank Hero to come out of England.\u2018Master\u2019 rank Hero referred to top 70 of the world\u2019s most brilliant Heroes. Currently, 33 of these 70 Heroes were Korean, while 18 were American and 9 were Chinese. Only 2 were from England, but even that was arguable, as they obtained Korean citizenship 15 years ago.As such, the citizens of England kept their eyes out on any news regarding Rachel, who they hoped would become the symbol of their nation.To respond to their expectations, Rachel did not sleep more than two hours a day. But the \u2018record\u2019 she maintained through all this effort was broken today.Rachel wasn\u2019t sad, only apprehensive and apologetic. Of course, the result of a single written exam was unlikely to spread to England, but \u2018Phenomenon Realm Analysis\u2019 was a difficult topic even for her. The gap between her and first place would likely not change for a while.\u201c\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Rachel felt a gaze looking at her. It was from an average-looking man. She didn\u2019t know his name, but she felt the gazes of other cadets falling on the man. Immediately, Rachel realized that this man was Kim Hajin. The man turned back to face the front of the class, but Rachel remembered his face.Rachel began to covet the notebook he had in front of him.**There was a slight uproar at the fact that I got first place on the \u2018Phenomenon Realm Analysis\u2019 written exam, a topic widely known to be one of the most difficult at Cube. Rachel didn\u2019t say much, but the professor personally praised me despite Monday\u2019s professor being different than Friday\u2019s professor.\u201cI also looked at Kim Hajin cadet\u2019s answer sheet. His knowledge and vision were impressive to say the least. I hope other cadets can learn his passion for studying. Once again, theory is very important.\u201dThat was what the professor said. From my perspective, it couldn\u2019t have been more uncomforting.In any case, I quickly left the moment classes ended. I had a lot to do today. No, I had a lot of SP to spend.I couldn\u2019t hoard SP anymore if I wanted to protect myself from upcoming events. Now that the second arc had begun, Cube was no longer a safe place. Several Djinns should have already laid traps within the academy.To briefly explain about Djinns, a Djinn was a human who formed a contract with a devil. In exchange for a human\u2019s soul, a devil gave him power. Naturally, higher ranked devils gave stronger powers.But if an ordinary human formed this contract, he would only become a demi-Djinn, a puppet without intelligence. The \u2018Dog of Lucius\u2019 from the museum was an example of this type.Thanks to Lucius\u2019 magic power, the man had gained enough power to combat Kim Suho, but losing his sanity to rage, he couldn\u2019t even accomplish the mission his master gave him. If he ignored Kim Suho and killed his intended target, Lucius would have been satisfied.Thus, even if it was more difficult to achieve, devils favored people whose bodies had ample magic power and vigor, yet underdeveloped mental power. Naturally, cadets were the perfect targets.As such, I felt the need to prepare another weapon. If I encountered a Djinn in my current state, I had no hope of surviving.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dI sat on my desk and stared at my laptop.For now, I planned to add a setting to the Desert Eagle. I had a lot of SP thanks to Chae Nayun\u2019s or Shin Jonghak\u2019s effort.[Transformation function added to Desert Eagle. Handgun to 12-gauge shotgun]\u2014Condition: Requires Stigma\u2019s magic power.Handgun and shotgun. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that a shotgun was much more powerful. Furthermore, the power of a shotgun increased the closer one was to a target.There was no mechanism that magically transformed a handgun into a shotgun, but could such a miraculous technology be achieved with my Setting Intervention?[Transformation function added to Desert Eagle. Handgun to 12-gauge shotgun]\u2014Condition: Requires Stigma\u2019s magic power.\u2014Amplifies attack power by a maximum of 100% depending on your distance to the target[250SP will be used. Would you like to save?]Indeed, a miraculous technique had appeared here and now.The laptop modified what I wrote to be more detailed and told me the cost. 250SP was a reasonable price. Without hesitation, I hit [save].In an instant, a metal colored current of air shot out of the laptop and enveloped the Desert Eagle. The gun shined in a grey hue before subsiding. I picked it up and looked around to see whether anything had changed, but the design was the same as before.I poured Stigma\u2019s magic power into the handgun. Immediately, the handgun began to dismantle itself.Kiriik\u2014 With a robotic sound, the magazine split, and the gunstock and gun barrel began to elongate. Soon, the Desert Eagle took on a new form that was no longer that of a handgun.Two platinum colored barrels the size of my arm lied in parallel, looking clean and elegant.\u201c\u2026It\u2019ll surprise them for sure.\u201dI didn\u2019t know much about shotguns, but the Desert Eagle\u2019s destructive power had surely gone up with this modification.Click\u2014\u00a0I opened the magazine, which was empty. To fully load it, I needed .12 inch bullets. I would have to buy the appropriate size bullets or modify the ones I had. This could wait until later.With that, I was done with modifying my weapon, but there were still things to do.Creating an Art.The dictionary meaning of Art was a skill at doing a specific thing, typically acquired through practice. For example, a painter had an Art for drawing and a singer had an Art for singing.The difference between an Art and a Gift was that an Art did not produce supernatural effects in response to magic power.\u25b7Arts (0/3)XI could create three arts. For now, I had one in mind.===[Parkour]\u2014Can ride walls with rapid movement and can freely move through obstacles through running, jumping, and climbing.\u2014Speed and application of the Art is proportional to the speed stat.===Parkour. \u2018Positioning\u2019 was the most important factor determining the life or death of a sharpshooter. Naturally, parkour was the perfect skill for any sharpshooter.My laptop kindly modified my vague sentences.===\u300cArt\u300d[Parkour] [Proficiency 0%] [Low rank]\u2014Grants flexible and shrewd movement.\u2014Is not affected by terrain features and can use terrain features like walls and obstacles to freely run, jump, and climb.\u2014Speed and application of the Art depends on the strength and speed stat.===[350SP will be used. Would you like to save?]I would have shuddered at the cost if it wasn\u2019t for recent events. Now, my SP was going up by 2 every hour even without doing anything. I pressed [save] without hesitation and got up.Now that I made new changes, it was time to test them.**Tiriring\u2014 Tiriring\u2014I opened my eyes at the sound of the alarm. My entire body ached. I more or less expected it after I rode walls and trees until 4 A.M, but I was having too much fun to stop.\u201cArgh, my joints\u2026\u201dI climbed walls using the tiniest cracks and leaped up trees using the smallest protrusions. Every time I landed, excitement coursed through my veins and my body experienced a runner\u2019s high. Furthermore, looking down from a lofty height gave me a refreshing sense of ecstasy.\u201c\u2026God damn it.\u201dI had to go to class now. Combat training would begin again starting from today. Since midterms were coming up and Djinns would start to get active, the combat training was likely to be hell.[This message is for all cadets \u315c\u315c. Has anyone seen Seungyeon from World class? I haven\u2019t been able to contact her since yesterday \u315c\u315c]Looking at my smartwatch, I could tell that a second victim had appeared.There wasn\u2019t anything I could do about the Djinn.Of course, I knew the identity of the Djinn and his next victim. But if I exposed him (though how I would do that was another question), I was afraid the story would become too distorted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dI sighed. Just because his victims were fated to die, it didn\u2019t make me feel any less guilty when I was leaving them be. I didn\u2019t see what was happening in this world as just another page in a novel.\u201c\u2026Why can\u2019t Yoo Yeonha just be kidnapped first?\u201dThrough this arc, Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha would come to form a meaningful relationship. Yoo Yeonha would be influenced by Kim Suho, becoming less temperamental, and Kim Suho would obtain the connection known as Yoo Yeonha.But there would be four more victims until Yoo Yeonha is kidnapped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mock Dungeon Trial (1)Cube had a variety of artificial terrain created to allow for more efficient training: mountains, hills, limestone caves, volcanic caves, etc. Each environment had its unique puppet monsters, and naturally, there were also artificial Dungeons created with cutting-edge magic technology.\u201cToday\u2019s combat training is a bit special.\u201dJust like Kim Soohyuk said, there were two classes participating in today\u2019s combat training. We were gathered outside of an eerie cave. The black tunnel-like entrance seemed to ooze ominous energy.And indeed, the cave was full of traps and puppet monsters. Among them would be real monsters and lethal traps set up by Djinns.I could already feel myself trembling.\u201cToday, you\u2019ll be entering this cave with another class. As a joint training exercise, a team from each class will join together to form a single team.\u201dThe name of this training was Mock Dungeon Trial. Cadets would form a team of eight and experience an artificial Dungeon.Two hundred cadets would be inside this massive grade artificial Dungeon, so one could only imagine just how large it was.\u201cNow, get in your usual teams.\u201dI looked for Yoo Yeonha, who was staring at the cave entrance nervously. The fact that Yoo Yeonha was nervous showed how threatening the Dungeon\u2019s entrance seemed.\u201cI\u2019m shaking.\u201d\u201cMe too. Look, I have goosebumps on my arms.\u201dJin Hoseung and Hazuki approached, making a fuss. Other cadets also found their teams, and 200 cadets quickly formed into 50 groups.\u201cNext, we\u2019ll announce your team pair. For the record, the cadet with the highest grade was chosen to be the team leader.\u201dKim Soohyuk pressed his smartwatch, projecting a hologram of the team list.===[Team 1]Veritas class \u2013 Team Kim SuhoWorld class \u2013 Team Jo Yoon-Ah===Kim Suho became teams with a girl named Jo Yoon-Ah. On a side note, Jo Yoon-Ah was a generic filler character, whose sole role was to act haughty in front of Kim Suho before coming to realize his greatness.But would the co-author allow it?I approached Jo Yoon-Ah.[Jo Yoon-Ah \u2014 Has a worse personality]Thankfully, that was the only change. I prayed for Kim Suho who would suffer under her torment.===[Team 2]Veritas class \u2013 Team Shin JonghakWorld class \u2013 Team Kaine===I didn\u2019t know much about Team 2. To be honest, I had never heard of Kaine.===[Team 3]Veritas class \u2013 Team Chae NayunWorld class \u2013 Team Sven===\u201cHu\u2026\u201dTeam 3, which was formed just like in the novel\u2019s scenario, was the team to watch out for.\u2018Sven\u2019 was a dangerous character. On the outside, he was an international student from Germany who had a crush on Chae Nayun.Sven was a star student in his country, who had walked on the path of an elite since he was young. On his plane ride to Korea, he likely imagined himself to be on the top of Cube\u2019s rankings.But unfortunately, Cube was filled with heaven-defying characters. Sven couldn\u2019t come close to their talents, and now he was struggling with an inferiority complex and a sense of defeat.His pent-up frustration would explode during this Dungeon trial.The result?Sven would come to sell his soul to a Djinn.But that wouldn\u2019t happen today. He would only choose to form a contract after struggling with the decision for a day.\u2026At least, that was what was supposed to happen.But my laptop was clearly alerting me of a change in his setting.[Sven \u2013 Mental weakness intensified. Significantly increased chance of falling to a devil\u2019s servant during the Mock Dungeon Trial.]The key word was \u2018during\u2019. It meant that the incident would happen today.This was a very serious problem.I stared at Team 3.\u201cH-Hello, Nayun. I saw you in the hunting club.\u201dCoincidentally, Sven reached his hand out to Chae Nayun at that moment. His eyes were full of affection, but Chae Nayun replied with an apathetic look.\u201cAh, yes, how old are you?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m the same age as you.\u201dOther teams were being announced in the meanwhile, but my entire attention was concentrated on Sven. I wanted to advise Chae Nayun to not treat him so rudely like she normally did with others.\u201cTeam 8. Veritas class, Team Yoo Yeonha. World class, Team Jayden.\u201dAt that moment, Team 8 was announced.I felt like I had heard of Jayden before. I immediately looked him up on my settings book. Because he didn\u2019t play an important role in the story, there was only a quick summary of his character.[Jayden]A typical strong in front of weak, weak in front of the strong character. About 7.5/10 in potential. Strong enough to get scouted by Essence of the Strait.\u201cHello~ Haha.\u201dJayden approached us with a hearty laugh. He had a generic Western look with deep brown eyes and a tall nose.At the same time, an alert popped up on my laptop. Jayden\u2019s setting had also been changed.[Jayden \u2013 Potential increased from 7.5 to 8.]His potential had increased by a whole 0.5 points. Potential was a number I assigned to characters to easily estimate their overall potential. It wasn\u2019t a number that was a part of this world.Obviously, Kim Suho\u2019s potential was 10 as a main character\u2019s potential should be, while Chae Nayun\u2019s was 9.5.Even if one worked their entire life, it was impossible to catch up to this 0.5 point difference. This showed just how important the potential rating was. And now, Jayden\u2019s potential had increased by a whole half a point.\u201cYou must be Yoo Yeonha! It\u2019s great meeting you. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you!\u201d\u201cAh, yes, nice to meet you.\u201dJayden held out his hand. I wondered if Yoo Yeonha would shake someone\u2019s hand in her first meeting. My question was answered in the next moment, as Yoo Yeonha readily took his hand.\u201cNext to me in order is Kim Jingyu, Oh Soojung, and Lee Shaung.\u201d\u201cThis is Jin Hoseung, Hazuki, and Yi Hajin.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dFor a moment, I doubted my ears. Who\u2019s Yi Hajin? Was she doing this on purpose? I\u2019m Kim Hajin.In any case, Yoo Yeonha talked to Jayden affectionately while his teammates also listened in. I had no way of knowing whether she had already determined Jayden to be someone with potential and was managing her image, but it was an interesting sight nonetheless.\u201cI\u2019m a sharpshooter. My main weapon is a bow.\u201d\u201cMine\u2019s my fist.\u201d\u201cMine is a shield.\u201dKim Jingyu, Oh Soojung, and Lee Shaung introduced themselves. Hazuki, Jin Hoseung, and I then introduced ourselves.\u201cSwordsman. Typical, right?\u201d\u201cI use an axe.\u201d\u201c\u2026I use this.\u201dI held up the training handgun.Although I had my Desert Eagle, which was a much better weapon, cadets were prohibited from using personal weapons in exams to test their pure abilities.Of course, I had my Desert Eagle stored in a convenient place \u2013 inside Stigma.Since I could use Stigma\u2019s magic power as I willed, creating an extradimensional space to store the Desert Eagle wasn\u2019t hard to do.\u201cAh, you\u2019re that guy. The guy who chose a gun. I heard about you.\u201d\u201cIt feels strange seeing you in person.\u201dThe three people\u2019s eyes kindled with interest, but as the target of their interest, I couldn\u2019t say it was a pleasant feeling, as their eyes seemed to say, \u201cI\u2019m at least better than this guy\u201d.\u201cAre you wasting your Gift? Or is your Gift not good enough?\u201d\u2026But that was still better than brute honesty. I turned towards the source of the voice. As expected, Jayden was smiling slyly.No one in my team, if it was only in name, defended me. I didn\u2019t expect much from Yoo Yeonha, but Jin Hoseung and Hazuki didn\u2019t say anything either.It was a bit disappointing, but I understood why. The rumors about me going around Veritas class wasn\u2019t at a joking level.Things like using my position as Cube\u2019s cadet to blackmail or rape a girl, all the while staying quiet at Cube since everyone else was stronger, and going to Seoul every weekend enjoy women and drink alcohol\u2026I was practically a societal evil.And after today, these rumors would surely spread to other classes. I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Well, at least my SP would go up a lot.\u201cEveryone, get ready.\u201dTeam assignment had ended before I noticed, and cadets quickly began to move at Kim Soohyuk\u2019s words.\u201cGo in one by one starting from Team 1.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dKim Suho shouted valiantly and took lead. Jo Yoon-Ah followed after him with an annoyed face.\u201cYoo Yeonha-ssi, I heard you were number one among this year\u2019s supporters.\u201d\u201cHaha, really? I heard a lot about Jayden-ssi. I think the instructors balanced the teams wrong. We\u2019re too much at an advantage.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s just how teams are. When there\u2019s one exceptional person\u2026 I\u2019m sure you know the rest. It\u2019s easy to see that Yoo Yeonha-ssi has a baggage to carry.\u201dMeanwhile, Yoo Yeonha and Jayden chatted. Even from my perspective, Jayden did a good job not going too far and keeping Yoo Yeonha pleased. He was a good talker unbefitting of a high schooler. Maybe I should have approached Yoo Yeonha the same way.\u201cTeam 8, enter.\u201dKim Soohyuk signaled our team\u2019s turn.**The eight of us walked through the cave. The formation was perfect. Three warriors in the front, supporters in the second row, sharpshooters in the third, and a single warrior in the final row.After walking for a while, we arrived at a fork. There were eight paths to choose from.\u201cWhich path should we take?\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke to me for the first time today.\u201cJingyu, what do you think?\u201dJayden also asked his sharpshooter. Once again, sharpshooters often acted as pathfinders.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cTake the sixth path.\u201dI walked up and stood in front of the sixth path. However, the sixth path would likely be difficult. In truth, the difficulty of the paths was in order.In other words, the sixth path had a level 6 difficulty.But Chae Nayun should have chosen this path, so I had no other choice. If Sven contracts a Djinn here today, Chae Nayun wouldn\u2019t be able to handle him alone.\u201cLet\u2019s take the sixth path.\u201dNo matter what, I couldn\u2019t lose a righteous character with a 9.5 potential. Not only would the future story become a mess, it would also be a huge loss for this world.\u201cHuh? Who are you to tell us where to\u2014\u201d\u201cJust do as he says.\u201dYoo Yeonha interrupted Jayden. It was nice to know I was trusted as a pathfinder.\u201cHe might look like that, but his eyes are exceptional.\u201d\u201cLook like what? Do you have to put it that way?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m praising you.\u201dIn any case, our team walked into the sixth path.The path was completely silent with only dry wind from the entrance hitting our back. After ten minutes of walking in high tension\u2026We finally discovered a target.\u201cIn front, there\u2019s a monster.\u201dFlashing its terrifying eyes and flickering its tongue was a monster known as the Salamander. By the size of its body, it seemed to be low-intermediate rank at best. But monsters that could wield the four elements (water, wind, earth, fire) were tricky to deal with, and Salamanders used the most destructive element, fire.\u201cYou can see it?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a Salamander. That should be the switch.\u201dOnce we defeat the Salamander, the scenery should change. A Dungeon was an extradimensional space created with magic power. It might look like a cave at first, but once the switch was pulled, the interior could change completely. More often than not, a Dungeon\u2019s switch was a specific monster.\u201c\u2026You can really see? I don\u2019t believe you.\u201dJayden muttered in doubt.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m telling you about it because I can see it. Just listen to me, jackass.\u201dHe was starting to get on my nerves.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201c\u2026Tsk. Quiet, both of you. Get ready for battle.\u201dYoo Yeonha sighed audibly as she held up her whip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mock Dungeon Trial (2)\u201cSalamander? Does anyone here have the water attribute?\u201dJayden asked as he stretched, but there was no 17 year old cadet who had accepted the mana of water. At the very least, one had to have undergone enlightenment to do so. It seemed Jayden didn\u2019t expect much, as he held up his sword without being disappointed.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be easy.\u201dI also took out my handgun. A Salamander of that size should be low-intermediate rank grade 6.Eight people were more than enough to kill it. But what worried me was how easy it seemed.The team members walked forward with their senses heightened.\u201cOh, there it is.\u201dJayden pointed at the Salamander loafing around on the ground.\u201c\u2026So you were right. I guess it\u2019s true you can find dog turd if you want to use it for medicine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the other way, retard.\u201dJayden glared at me but quietly asked Kim Jingyu.\u201cWasn\u2019t I right?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cThe Proverb. That you can find dog turd if you want to use it for medicine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite, you can\u2019t find dog turd even if you want to use it for medicine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dAfter realizing his mistake, Jayden glanced at Yoo Yeonha, fearful that he had disappointed her. But Yoo Yeonha seemed uninterested in our conversation, as she imbued her magic power into her whip and prepared for battle.\u201cGet ready. Though, if it\u2019s a switch, it should be a piece of cake. Huup!\u201dYoo Yeonha swung her whip, which shot towards the Salamander\u2019s tail like a snake.\u201cKueek\u2014\u201dWith its tail tied up by Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip, the Salamander couldn\u2019t use its most powerful attack, firebreath.Immediately afterwards, Kim Jingyu shot an arrow at its eye, while the warriors rushed forward to cut its skin.In the blink of an eye, the Salamander was killed.There wasn\u2019t anything for me to do.\u201cEasy as pie. That was amazing, Yoo Yeonha-ssi. How did you instantly grab its tail like that?\u201dJayden flattered Yoo Yeonha, to which she returned a smile.Feeling vain at how easy the fight was, I stepped towards them.At that moment\u2026Thwick. I tripped on a rock. I fell forward silently and instinctively grabbed onto what was in front of me. Most likely, it was Yoo Yeonha\u2019s head.\u201cKyak\u2014\u201dA high-pitched scream rang out.At the same time, a sharp and unnatural object brushed past my hand and Yoo Yeonha\u2019s hair.Thud.Yoo Yeonha fell.\u201cW-What? Is it an ambush!?\u201dJayden made a fuss as he pointed his weapon in all directions. Soon, his eyes landed on me. I was kneeled with my hand ramming Yoo Yeonha\u2019s head to the ground.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJayden and the rest of the cadets stared blankly at a loss for words.An ominous and dreary silence descended.\u201c\u2026Let go.\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s said coldly. I could feel my heart contracting. I immediately took my hands off and pretended like nothing happened.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha staggered up and gave me a deathly glare without caring for her messed up hair.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201dAt that moment, Hazuki pointed at the wall. Thanks to Hazuki\u2019s insensitive interruption, I could finally catch a breath of air.But when I looked at the direction Hazuki was pointing at, I saw an arrow stuck in the cave\u2019s wall.Then, I finally understood the situation.The sound of something cutting through the air and that strange brushing sensation\u2026 It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out what just occurred.\u201c\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s head turned with a creak to the arrow. I was genuinely terrified. When she discovered the arrow on the wall, her eyes widened.Though it wasn\u2019t what I intended at all, I immediately let out a dry cough and bluffed.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to say thanks, Yoo Yeonha-ssi. We\u2019re teammates after all.\u201d\u201cWow. How did you know? I didn\u2019t feel it at all!\u201dHazuki asked in genuine awe.\u201c\u2026Sharpshooters have good perception.\u201dPerception or whatever, the real reason had to be my high luck. All eight of us had perception that far surpassed that of normal humans. If the others couldn\u2019t detect anything, I most certainly couldn\u2019t have either.That arrow was likely a trap that used magic power. I mean, just look at the power of that thing, it completely dug itself into the wall! It was too strong to be a trap for training.\u201cThat was close. Are you unhurt, Yoo Yeonha-ssi?\u201dI approached the arrow while making idle remarks.\u201cHuu\u2026\u201dI could hear the sound of Yoo Yeonha\u2019s breath from behind me. Was she forgiving me? Or was she still angry about what happened?In any case, I squatted down in front of the arrow and turned on my laptop.===[Poison Arrow]\u300cKilling Power \u2013 4/10\u300d\u300cAdditional Effect \u2013 Silent Ambush\u300d\u2014An arrow tipped with nerve poison.===It was as I expected.\u201cI\u2019ll take this.\u201dI put the arrow in my bag along with my laptop\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go.\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke. I flinched for a moment before turning around. Yoo Yeonha had tidied herself up and was now staring at me while biting her lips.Jayden asked as he glanced at Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face to see her expression.\u201cYeonha-ssi, are you okay?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t chitchat.\u201d\u201cYes, got it.\u201dAfter that, we walked without much talking.After walking past the Salamander corpse, the scenery began to change. The dark surroundings began to light up, and plants and trees began to appear. Surprisingly, the trees were red like maple trees.Furthermore, a wind began to blow. But it was far from a cool refreshing wind. Rather, it was a hot wind that made it hard to breathe.\u201c\u2026So hot.\u201dJayden murmured as he took off his outer clothes. Jin Hoseung, Kim Jingyu, Lee Shaung, Hazuki, and I also took off a layer of clothes. Only Yoo Yeonha remained fully clothed. Even as she sweated in buckets, she protected her dignity.\u201cHaa\u2026 It must be a Field type.\u201dDungeons were generally separated into two types \u2013 Stage and Field.Like its name suggested, Stage Dungeons had multiple layers that had to be cleared in order, while Field Dungeons just had monsters that had to be killed until the boss monster appeared.\u201cDid the advance team hunt everything? There\u2019s nothing here.\u201dAfter walking for about 20 minutes, Jayden yawned, seemingly bored.\u201cNo, each team had different entrances. If we started from the east, the other team should have started from the west. Also, I can see a group of monsters up ahead.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dOn the tiny craters up ahead, there were four Salamanders and 11 Peanut Flames.\u201c15 in total, Salamanders and Peanut Flames. Looks like it\u2019ll be tough.\u201d\u201cThat many?\u201dHazuki\u2019s eye widened.\u201cYep.\u201dI held up my gun, at which Jayden gave a condescending sneer.\u201cPft, what can you do with a gun? You won\u2019t even be able to kill a Peanut Flame\u2026 retard.\u201dJayden whispered the last bit so that Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t hear it.I had to admit, with this training handgun, I couldn\u2019t pierce through the Salamander\u2019s skin. Peanut Flames were also monsters capable of wielding magic power, and the flame barriers they constantly covered themselves with gave them a tough exterior.But I wasn\u2019t completely out of options. If I hit three bullets in the same spot, I should be able to break through the flame barrier.\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dJayden twisted his lips as he released his sword qi.\u201cIf you\u2019re so confident, do you want to make a bet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut I still wasn\u2019t strong enough to beat Jayden. Just when I was about to refuse\u2026Whish!A whip flew in like lightning, striking the ground between Jayden and me.\u201cWhoa!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dJayden and I both turned towards Yoo Yeonha.But she only spoke two words with a dead-cold face.\u201cPlease. Focus.\u201d**Same time. Chae Nayun\u2019s team had already suffered various difficulties. The main cause was Sven, whose body had been paralyzed by a trap.\u201cGod, where did that arrow even come from?\u201dAt Chae Nayun\u2019s grumbling, Sven murmured quietly.\u201cYou can leave me behi\u2014\u201d\u201cLeave you behind? If you know you\u2019re a bother, just stay put.\u201dEven without Sven, Chae Nayun had led her teammates this far. If she could clear the Dungeon, she would receive an overwhelming score with her individual result and the teamwork she showed. Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t give up the only chance to win against Kim Suho.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dDemian, her teammate, asked.\u201cWait here for now. I think the Dungeon\u2019s boss is up ahead. Can you see it?\u201dChae Nayun looked far into the distance.A giant golem with a body made of lava. The lava spilling from its body clearly marked its territory.\u201c\u2026Yeah, it has to be the boss.\u201dIt was a Magma Golem, a monster that was at least intermediate rank grade 5. Chae Nayun and her team somehow managed to make it here, but they knew they couldn\u2019t defeat the Magma Golem even if Sven was fine.\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to beat it with just us. Another team should be arriving here soon. Let\u2019s join forces.\u201d\u201c\u2026But what if no one chose the same pathway as us?\u201d\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be possible. At least three teams should come here by design.\u201dOther cadets might have thought the choice was random, but Chae Nayun knew something they didn\u2019t. A pathway would disappear once three teams entered it.\u201cRemember, we\u2019re graded on our individual performance, not who finishes first.\u201dSven couldn\u2019t hear Chae Nayun\u2019s heated voice.Huu. Huu.To him, his entire surroundings were dead silent. He felt as though he was in a vacuum. In this comfort, he slowly collected his breath. The guilt he felt towards his teammates, his self-loathing and inferiority complex all seemed to disappear, as tranquility descended in his mind.\u2014Child, don\u2019t you want to get stronger?At that moment, a bewitching voice invaded his heart, causing a ripple in the serene surface. Sven opened his eyes slightly. Two brilliant spheres of light lit up the dark sky. As though they were eyes, the spheres of light curved to an arc before pouring into Sven\u2019s pupils.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014Wasn\u2019t it painful? I can give you power.The voice became clearer and pounded Sven\u2019s heart. Feeling the wave of emotions surging from the deepest depths of his heart, Sven teared up.I want to get stronger. I want to get stronger. I want to meet the expectations of my country\u2019s people, who hails me as their greatest hope, and the expectations of my parents, who believes I will become the world\u2019s greatest Hero. I don\u2019t want to suffer from this endless sense of hopelessness and defeat. I don\u2019t want to hate myself anymore\u2026\u2014You only have to pay a cheap price. It\u2019s far lighter than giving up everything.Sven nodded his head at the warm voice.And he slowly reached out towards the gentle light caressing him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mock Dungeon Trial (3)\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone knows what kind of a monster Peanut Flames are.\u201dPeanut Flames were low-rank grade 2 element type monsters. They were named Peanut Flames because they look like tiny will-o-wisps, but on closer inspection, one could see that they were lizards. They were generally the size of an adult man\u2019s forearm and looked like wisps of flame because they encased themselves in an oval barrier.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to kill the Peanut Flames first.\u201dThe Peanut Flames\u2019 only method of attack was shooting out fireballs, but because they had tough barriers and traveled in groups, they weren\u2019t easy to deal with without ample combat experience.\u201cBut who\u2019s going to draw the Salamanders\u2019 attention in the meanwhile?\u201d\u201cI can do it.\u201dHazuki raised her hand at Jayden\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m pretty quick on my feet. I got 5th place in speed.\u201d\u201cPerfect.\u201dJayden used English for the first time since we met. Yoo Yeonha spoke with a soft smile.\u201cPeanut Flames are a lot slower than Salamanders, so you only have to draw their attention.\u201d\u201cYes, then I\u2019ll leave you to cover me.\u201dHazuki stretched before shouting \u201cI\u2019m going\u2014!\u201d and rushing forward. After approaching the cluster of monsters in the blink of an eye, she hurled her axe and let out a spirited shout. The angered Salamanders then began to waddle towards Hazuki.Using this opportunity, Jayden rushed into the enemy line.\u201cHuap!\u201dThe sword he swung with a rugged breath clashed with a Peanut Flame\u2019s barrier. A flash of light erupted from the collision of flame and magic power. Jayden\u2019s single attack drew a clear crack on the Peanut Flame\u2019s barrier, and a magic power arrow flew in, striking the crack. Jayden and Kim Jingyu\u2019s joint attack easily shattered the Peanut Flame\u2019s barrier, and Jayden cut down the exposed lizard without hesitation.It was a perfect display of teamwork, but there were still many enemies left.Jayden turned to a different direction. In that instant, a terrifying whip shot past his shoulder, grabbing three Peanut Flames together and marking them to be Jayden\u2019s next prey. Jayden immediately charged towards the restrained Peanut Flames.I also made my move. I didn\u2019t need to run around like the others, being simple yet elegant. After finding a Peanut Flame, I pulled the trigger four times. Four bullets shot towards the Peanut Flame in a line.The first magic bullet struck the Peanut Flame\u2019s barrier and exploded.The barrier still stood strong, but immediately afterwards, the second magic bullet struck the same spot as the first magic bullet. The barrier shook but still remained standing.Next was the third magic bullet. Just like the second magic bullet, it struck the same spot, and barrier finally broke down.With its barrier gone, the lizard inside was shot to death by the fourth bullet.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dNext to me, a dazed interjection rang out. It was Kim Jingyu, who was also a sharpshooter.Admittedly, what I did must have looked shocking for him.Unlike the difficult labor that was weaving an arrow with magic power and pulling the bowstring with one\u2019s strength, all I had to do to kill a Peanut Flame was pull the gun\u2019s trigger four times.\u201cGuns are lacking in destructive power, but in exchange, they have less recoil and delay between shots.\u201dI boasted as I waved my gun around, but in truth, this was only possible against slow low-rank monsters like Peanut Flames. It was also likely that luck played a part in the attack.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFocus, focus.\u201dSeeing Kim Jingyu\u2019s dumbstruck face, I pointed at the other Peanut Flames. Coincidentally, Yoo Yeonha was striking her whip down at them. Her whip became grotesquely longer and swept through the ground. From her whip, I could sense a tiny spark of electricity. That was Yoo Yeonha\u2019s Gift. It seemed she was already on the edge of achieving enlightenment.Being impressed or congratulating her could come later. For now, I looked for my next target, another Peanut Flame.But now that the battle was fully underway, the Peanut Flames were more excited. As a result, killing them wasn\u2019t as easy as before. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean it was difficult. Although I couldn\u2019t break through its barrier even after six bullets, the seventh bullet luckily pierced through its magic core, killing it in one shot.In any case, by the time I killed three Peanut Flames, the battle was nearing its end. Once all the Peanut Flames were dead, we jointly attacked the four Salamanders Hazuki was holding back, and there was nothing they could do to fight back.It was easy to see why Salamanders were only low-intermediate rank. No matter how powerful their firebreaths were, they couldn\u2019t use it once their tails were tied up.\u201cWhew, it\u2019s over. I managed to kill six thanks to Yeonha-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s good to hear. Let\u2019s count them.\u201dWe approached the mana puppets and counted the bodies.One, two, three\u2026 fifteen.We had killed them all.\u201cDo we keep going now?\u201dAt the same time that Jayden spoke with a smile, a light flashed from afar.I instinctively turned towards the light. In that instant, my mind became blank. A Salamander was breathing out a beam of fire. A firebreath the size of a pillar hurled towards us while melting the surface of the ground.I could feel my brain yelling. This was a direct strike. There was no way to dodge it. And if it hit, I would die. I had to block it if I wanted to live.But how?I immediately thought of Stigma\u2019s magic power.If I could form a barrier of water like the Peanut Flames did with fire, I might be able to block it.\u2026The Stigma on my arm rose up with a blue glow, as pain spread out from my upper arm. Following my will, the magic power was released into the air.Immediately afterwards, a wave of fire swept through us.Tzzzzzzz\u2014A terrifying amount of steam erupted from the collision of water and fire. The hot steam clouded the surroundings like a fog, blocking our vision. The barrier I created was destroyed from hitting the firebreath.Then, a momentary silence descended before being broken by a deep voice that reflected everyone\u2019s thoughts.\u201c\u2026T-That was no joke.\u201dIt was Jayden. A thick terror could be seen on his face. He seemed to be on the verge of having a panic attack.\u201cThat last attack, weren\u2019t we dead if it hit us?\u201d\u2018Yeah, we would\u2019ve been fried up really good.\u2019 Thinking that in my head, I collapsed on the ground. I couldn\u2019t put any strength in my legs. My entire body felt numb. I thanked the dense cloud of steam for concealing my pathetic state.\u201cOy, sharpshooter. The Salamander\u2019s still alive, but we can\u2019t see anything. Tell me where that bastard is before my heart explodes.\u201dJayden spoke. His voice was trembling with fear. I also tried to calm myself.\u2018Calm down, Kim Hajin. It can\u2019t see us either. We just have to kill it before the steam disappears.\u2019\u201cLook at the trajectory.\u201dI held up my gun.Rather than describing its location with words, it was better to just show it.\u201cI\u2019m shooting.\u201dI pulled the trigger. The bullet shot towards the Salamander, drawing a blue trace. Although the bullet reached the Salamander in under a second, the trail it left behind stayed for a longer time. The others immediately threw everything they had at the direction of the trail.The Salamander died without a yelp, almost as though it spent its entire energy in its previous attack.At the same time, I could hear an unpleasant sound of metal cutting through skin.\u201c\u2026Wait, is this blood?\u201dJayden murmured in a daze. Just like he said, viscous fresh blood streamed down from the cut on the Salamander\u2019s body.\u201cA mana puppet with blood? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cThen what the fuck is this? It\u2019s sticky as hell. And what was that last attack? That was a real firebreath. I didn\u2019t even touch it and my skin\u2019s a little burned.\u201dMana puppets\u2019 attacks were lowered by two ranks compared to the monster they were based off of. In other words, the attack of a low-intermediate rank mana puppet was not even at the level of a low rank monster. Mana puppets used in combat training thus sent data of attacks it received back to Cube\u2019s scientists, who would simulate the attack on the real version of the monster and give back the result.\u201cCalm down.\u201d\u201cYou think I can just calm\u2026 Yes, you\u2019re right.\u201dJayden, who was about to erupt with anger, calmed down when faced with Yoo Yeonha.\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us that something like this wouldn\u2019t happen. It was a Salamander. It\u2019s entirely possible that a normal salamander naturally evolved into a monster. After all, we\u2019re in a Dungeon, even if it\u2019s artificial.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAt Yoo Yeonha\u2019s calm input, Jayden remained silent. He collected his breath and calmed himself down. Yoo Yeonha was always like this, but Jayden was also fairly composed for a high schooler.Meanwhile, the steam covering up the surroundings began to dissipate.Everyone was wet from the steam and water.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked me, likely because I was directly in line of the firebreath.My luck was 9.1, so why did it fly towards me of all people? Was the world trying to tell me to take more SP? Or was it because I was the only one capable of blocking it?Now that I think about it, Yoo Yeonha dying would have been the greatest calamity.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dI was fine, for now.\u201c\u2026Oh right. What the fuck was that?\u201dHowever, Jayden approached me, making a fuss.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said in the beginning that anyone with the water attribute should come out.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cOh, please. How did you block that firebreath then? That fucking steam was created because it clashed with water, didn\u2019t it!?\u201d\u201cSharpshooters normally carry a shield or two to protect themselves.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dStigma\u2019s magic power had followed my will and created a water attribute barrier. This shield blocked the Salamander\u2019s attack, and I now didn\u2019t have any magic power remaining.\u2026But this wasn\u2019t something I could just tell others.\u201cThis son of a bitch\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet. Let\u2019s get out of here for now. What happened just now\u2026 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be compensated with additional points.\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke as she stared at the Salamander\u2019s corpse.**While walking forward, Yoo Yeonha stole a glance behind her.A stupid-looking man was pulling his hair up. Sweat dripped from his hair. It would have looked cool if he was Shin Jonghak, but it was a bit dirty when that man did it.In any case, Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t hide the strange feeling she got.What blocked the Salamander\u2019s firebreath was undoubtedly a water attribute magic power. But a cadet who wasn\u2019t Shin Jonghak or Kim Suho was capable of imbuing his magic power with an attribute?Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t help but recall Chae Nayun\u2019s words. That Kim Hajin was hiding his true strength.Kim Hajin explained what happened by saying that he had a magic armament.There were indeed armaments like that. They were one of many types of defensive equipment that sharpshooters used.Aptly called Cloth Armor, these equipment looked exactly like ordinary clothes but had an additional functionality of releasing magic power to protect their wearer in danger.For a moment, Yoo Yeonha wondered if Jin Sechan gave him a Cloth Armor without telling her. But of course, that was impossible.While Salamanders were only low-intermediate ranked, items that could block their firebreath cost at least 40 million won. It wasn\u2019t an amount Jin Sechan could be responsible for. Not to mention, he had no reason to do so either.In that case, there were only two answers left.Either what Chae Nayun said was true, or Kim Hajin, being scared for his life, had really prepared a Cloth Armor beforehand.Yoo Yeonha found the former to be more likely. In that case, how Kim Hajin knew the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point also made sense.The question was why he was hiding his power.That was what she couldn\u2019t understand.Just why\u2026\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dAt that moment, Kim Hajin spoke up. Yoo Yeonha flinched from a guilty conscious.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cW-What\u2019s here? There\u2019s nothing here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. The dungeon\u2019s boss is up ahead along with another team.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYeah, let\u2019s hurry. It looks like they\u2019re in trouble.\u201dKim Hajin took the lead and quickened his pace.Yoo Yeonha followed suit, still harboring suspicion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mock Dungeon Trial (4)[15:29:07]Chae Nayun\u2019s team remained dead silent. They didn\u2019t have any other choice but to quietly wait for another team to show up. She wanted to be far away from the boss so she could at least breathe with ease, but she had to stay close enough to see the another team coming.At that moment\u2026\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dThe silence was broken by a sudden scream. For some reason, Sven was having a seizure. Chae Nayun and her team members all turned towards Sven in shock before quickly turning towards the Magma Golem in terror. Just as they feared, the Magma Golem was staring at them. The faces of the seven team members turned pale.\u2014Guooooo!With a roar resembling an earthquake, the Magma Golem slammed down its fist on the ground. Lava flowed into the ground from its body. Chae Nayun picked up Sven and shouted loudly.\u201cDodge!\u201dImmediately afterwards, lava erupted from the ground they were standing on. It was one of Magma Golem\u2019s attacks, a terrifying ambush attack that sent lava underground and making it erupt into a pillar of fire.Though the cadets spread out before it was too late, the Magma Golem was only getting started.From its face, what had to be a \u201cmouth\u201d opened wide. From inside, a current of lava poured out like a torrent. The Magma Golem rode the lava current it spat out, charging towards Chae Nayun\u2019s team.\u2014Guooooo!The terrifying sight of a giant golem sliding down a current of lava caused Chae Nayun\u2019s team to run away in fear.The Magma Golem\u2019s first target was Chae Nayun, who was slowed down by having to carry Sven.After arriving in front of her in an instant, it brandished its arms, slamming down and swinging sideways.Chae Nayun concentrated entirely on dodging the Magma Golem\u2019s attacks. Meanwhile, Sven began to murmur strange words on her back. Because he spoke in German, Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t understand a thing he said.\u201cHey! Stop screwing around and wake up!\u201dImmediately after her shout, a pillar of fire shot up from the place Chae Nayun was standing on. Chae Nayun quickly jumped back, but that wasn\u2019t the only a pillar of fire. Lava was erupting all around her.Chae Nayun found herself trapped by several pillars of fire. In front of her, the Magma Golem raised its arms up high.At that moment, Chae Nayun sensed her death.\u2018This golem will kill me. This terrifying being in front of me can\u2019t possibly be just a puppet\u2026\u2019 Petrified, she couldn\u2019t think about anything else. Without closing her eyes, she stared at the two fists crashing down on her.Tang!Just when the horrifying torrent of lava was about to devour her, the Magma Golem\u2019s head bent forward. With its arms raised, the Magma Golem stopped moving. Its expression showed that it was enraged, but its body remained frozen as though the sudden attack petrified its entire body.Chae Nayun turned towards the direction of the mysterious attack.There, she saw a man carrying a handgun.**[15:30:30]\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dWe stood in front of a giant wall.A wall made of volcanic rocks that were at least 10 meters tall. This wall, which was blocking the path to the boss area, wasn\u2019t here just a moment ago. But figuring out who put it here wasn\u2019t the biggest problem.\u201cHey, sharpshooter, didn\u2019t you say the boss was up ahead? It\u2019s a dead end.\u201d\u201cIt should be past this wall. Break it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Acting like the leader, huh.\u201dEven as he complained, Jayden took out his sword. A blade covered in magic power drew a diagonal line.Pang!However, not even a scratch appeared on the wall. Only Jayden\u2019s hand trembled.\u201cAaak! Yeah, genius idea!\u201dIt must have hurt quite a bit, as Jayden ran around in pain. Standing still, I fell in thought. If Jayden\u2019s sword qi couldn\u2019t break the wall, it had to be made of magic power. In that case, Yoo Yeonha wouldn\u2019t be able to break through it either.\u201cIs this really the right path? There was a fork in the road on our way here.\u201dYoo Yeonha asked in doubt as she touched the wall here and there.\u201cThis is the right place.\u201dNo matter what anyone said, I could clearly see Chae Nayun and her team fighting the Magma Golem beyond the wall.I closely inspected the wall blocking our path. Raising my head, I looked up. I could see a stream of light faintly shining from the top.\u201c\u2026Up there.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe team members also looked up.\u201cThere\u2019s a gap.\u201dWas it for ventilation? Or was it carelessness by whoever created this wall? In any case, it was most certainly a mistake.\u201cHow are we going to climb up there?\u201d Jayden asked.\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d I retorted, genuinely curious. The average jump height of warrior cadets was 4 meters. Adding magic power on top of that, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to jump several times that height. Even though the wall was a bit high, it shouldn\u2019t be to the point that they couldn\u2019t climb up.\u201cWhat, you think you can do it? What are you going to hold onto when we can\u2019t even make a dent in the wall?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJayden seemed to have given up, but I felt like I could do it. Just like Jayden said, we couldn\u2019t make dents on the wall. However, the surface of volcanic rocks was rugged by nature. With my Art, I should be able to climb up.\u2018I didn\u2019t think Parkour would come into use so quickly\u2026\u2019\u201cI\u2019m going ahead, so you guys can do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cStop joking. Let\u2019s go back and try the other pathway.\u201dWith that, Yoo Yeonha turned back. However, I lightly jumped up. Grabbing onto a jagged part of the wall\u2019s surface, I put my legs up. Then, I reached up with my hand. My hands and feet stuck to the wall like magnets.Just like that, I climbed the wall and reached the top in the blink of an eye. Then, I looked down. For a moment, I felt lightheaded. It was higher than I imagined.\u201cIs that guy a cat?\u201dJayden murmured in disbelief. I also enjoyed seeing my team members\u2019 surprised expressions.But I didn\u2019t have the time to leisurely admire the view.Guooooo\u2014A deep ringing sound capable of instilling terror rang out beyond the wall.\u201cW-What! What was that!?\u201d\u201cYou guys come up too. I\u2019m going first!\u201dI squeezed myself through the gap and used Parkour to climb down.After landing, I finally caught a glimpse of Chae Nayun and her team being chased by a Magma Golem.Just by looking at it, one could see that it wasn\u2019t a puppet. The entire Field was melting with its every movement, so how could it be a puppet?I quickly ran towards them and opened the extradimensional space in my Stigma. The tattoo on my upper arm glowed, and a corporeal magic power gathered in my hand. In an instant, it condensed into a gun and several bullets.I loaded a bullet I had prepared beforehand. It was a water attribute magic bullet, one I had made for emergency use. Though it was an expensive investment costing 30 SP, with the strong luck that went into making it, it would undoubtedly show great destructive power.\u201cWhew.\u201dAfter running in range to shoot, I stopped. I panted from being out of breath, but I didn\u2019t have time to rest. Chae Nayun was surrounded by the Magma Golem. I immediately aimed at the back of Magma Golem\u2019s head and fired.Tang!The bullet struck the Magma Golem\u2019s head squarely, and the Magma Golem\u2019s head bent forward. Immediately afterwards, the water attribute bullet reacted to its lava body and petrified its upper body. It was the so-called paralysis state.I looked past the Magma Golem.Sven was on Chae Nayun\u2019s back. Chae Nayun seemed to be in a momentary shock, while Sven looked like he had already fallen to a Djinn.I shouted at Chae Nayun.\u201cHey! Snap out of it!\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dThankfully, Chae Nayun responded quickly.\u201cFirst, put that guy on your back on the ground.\u201d\u201cWhat, where are the others? Why are you the only one\u2026\u201d\u201cPut him down!\u201dChae Nayun put Sven down like I said.\u201cHappy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dI ran in since the situation looked grim, but now I broke out in a cold sweat. At the same time, the Magma Golem\u2019s body trembled. It seemed it wanted to eject the bullet from its body. In other words, it would move again soon.I signaled Chae Nayun.\u201cHurry up and\u2026\u201dSave me.\u201cBattle position!\u201dBefore I could finish my sentence, Chae Nayun shouted. Immediately afterwards, a spear flew in and pierced the Magma Golem\u2019s neck. Her teammates followed suit. I quickly turned around and ran behind Chae Nayun\u2019s team.\u201cBuy time for me!\u201dChae Nayun shouted as she pulled on her arrowless bowstring. Soon, her magic power condensed on her bow. She seemed to be making special magic power arrow. It was likely what she learned from her previous defeat to the museum\u2019s Djinn. As expected, Chae Nayun wasn\u2019t lazy when it came to self-reflection and training.\u201c\u2026\u201dI dropped my jaws in awe at the sight happening in front of me.Chae Nayun\u2019s magic power created a fierce current, which rushed towards the bow and formed an arrow. In truth, it was too big to be called an arrow. It was a pillar. An attack of this level was impossible without exceptional mental power and application of magic power.But before her arrow could finish forming, the Magma Golem freed itself from paralysis.Guooooo\u2014!Her teammates tried to hold out as long as they could, but they were sent flying by a single swing of its arm. Roaring, the Magma Golem charged towards Chae Nayun.I quickly held up my gun.But before the Magma Golem\u2019s fist could reach Chae Nayun and before I could fire my gun, a single sword strike blocked the Magma Golem\u2019s advance.The sword strike\u2026 came from Sven.After blocking the Magma Golem with his sword, Sven turned around and muttered.\u201cSorry, I was late to recover.\u201dChae Nayun let go of her bowstring without an answer. Sven jumped to the side. With a brilliant light, Chae Nayun\u2019s giant arrow pierced through the Magma Golem\u2019s heart.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201dAs soon as she shot her arrow, Chae Nayun collapsed on the ground. She knew she would need at least 15 seconds until she could move.\u2014Guooo\u2026Even after taking such an enormous magic power attack, the Magma Golem didn\u2019t die. Chae Nayun softly bit her lips.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201dBut before the Magma Golem could recover and attack, Sven sliced off its head. With that, the Magma Golem\u2019s body turned into hard volcanic rock before disappearing.Silence descended in the battlefield.Sven put away his sword, walked up to me, and gave a slight nod.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThank you for helping us.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared at Sven.He had undoubtedly formed a contract with a Djinn. But unlike in the original story, he didn\u2019t lose control. I was thankful for now. I had no more energy left to fight a Djinn.But Sven was destined to go berserk. While being eaten by the devil, he would tread farther into the path of destruction.That was because the devil Sven was contracted to was far too strong for him to handle\u2026\u201cSure took your sweet time, bastard.\u201dChae Nayun muttered while bent down on the ground. She seemed to have a lot to say, but she must have been out of strength as she closed her mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Djinn and Gari Mountain (1)Lying on the ground, I stared up at the ceiling. Scorching heat dug into my clothes. The dungeon\u2019s boss had been killed, but the heat remained.Bored, I tilted my head to the side. Chae Nayun\u2019s team was talking some distance away. They offered me to join them but I refused. I was too tired to answer the questions they\u2019d inevitably ask.\u201cHuum.\u201dAt that moment, Chae Nayun, who was stealing glances my way for a while, took a deep breath and got up. Then, she walked over.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe cast a shadow over me and looked down at my face.\u201cWhat.\u201dI curled up with only my upper body. Seeing sweat dripping down, Chae Nayun frowned slightly. But after straightening her expression, she sat down next to me. Of course, she was still about ten feet away.\u201c\u2026I thought I should I say this.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure if she was embarrassed or ashamed, but Chae Nayun spoke with great difficulty while looking up at the ceiling.\u201cT-Thanks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI was genuinely at a loss for words. I stared at Chae Nayun in a daze. That word was one I thought I\u2019d never hear from her.Chae Nayun.Age 17 to 27 in the story.She was only 16 by American age.[1]\u00a0Despite how young she was, the life she lived was far from normal. It was one filled with tragedies.The first tragedy should have occurred on her sixth birthday. On what should have been the happiest day for a six year old child, her mother was killed by a Djinn.After that incident, her personality developed in a completely different direction.The child, whose dream was to \u201cbecome like her Mommy\u201d, cried tears of blood and sought to become a Hero. While other children her age laughed and played around, she trained in hitting and breaking targets.The scar from that day was etched in the deepest part of her heart. As a fourth generation chaebol, even having a \u2018true friend\u2019 to mend this wound was a disgrace. Revealing one\u2019s deepest thoughts was akin to revealing one\u2019s weakness, and the hyenas infesting the outside world would jump at their chance to take advantage.As such, the only person she could trust and rely on was her blood relative who also shared the same pain, Chae Jinyoon. Because her father had been too busy as the successor of a chaebol family, she rarely saw her father.But this cruel world had even taken Chae Jinyoon away from her.The emotions she must have felt\u2026 I had no way of knowing because I didn\u2019t write them.But if I were to make a guess, Chae Nayun most likely honed her conviction to be even sharper. Only believing in herself and taking the pursuit of strength as her way of life, she must have ignored the worsening wound on her heart. Telling herself that she will overcome everything on her own and not opening her heart to anyone else, she must have put herself through arduous and painful physical training\u2026Because of this, there weren\u2019t many people who had received her thanks. I knew this better than anyone, even Chae Nayun herself, because I was the one who purposely wrote 'sorry\u201d rather than \u201cthank you.\u201dBut just now, she had said \u201cthanks\u201d.That was the greatest praise she could have given.But at the same time, the goal I had to accomplish tightened my heart.I had to kill the person she loved and respected the most. I had to make her experience the feeling of losing her family once again.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s voice cut off my thought. She was smacking her lips as though she had something more to say, but no words left her mouth.\u201cWhat.\u201dI urged her in frustration.Chae Nayun added just one sentence with her eyes still on the ceiling.\u201c\u2026Why aren\u2019t you fighting back?\u201d\u201cHm? What do you\u2026 Oh.\u201dShe was talking about Shin Jonghak\u2019s lackeys.Even though she was the one who instigated it, it seemed she felt sympathetic since I didn\u2019t fight back.I gave a simple reply.\u201cBecause I can\u2019t win even if I fight back.\u201dChae Nayun furrowed her brows in an instant and finally looked back down at me. She truly had a baby-face. Unlike Yoo Yeonha, who looked adult-like, Chae Nayun\u2019s cheeks still had a bit of baby fat. Was it because the Magma Golem beat her up? She looked like a bun. I laughed inwardly.\u201cWhat are you talking about, I saw the power of your gun with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cOh, that?\u201dI took out the Desert Eagle from my bag. To put it back in my extradimensional space, Stigma had to recover its magic power.\u201cPersonal weapon. Does that explain it?\u201dLooking at my high rank weapon, Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to get expelled if you\u2019re found out, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m using it only when I need to.\u201dChae Nayun closed her mouth. Then, she rubbed her chin as though she was pondering about something. I had no way of knowing what this girl was thinking about. But I waited since it looked like she was looking for an answer.After about 3 minutes, Chae Nayun finally voiced her thoughts.\u201cThings still don\u2019t add up completely\u2026 Ah, wait, your Gift! You have a Gift that strengthens guns!\u201dI held myself back from bursting into laughter. For the record, Gift and enlightenment were two different things. Even before one became enlightened, a Gift could be observed and developed through experience and hard-work.\u201cYou can think what you want.\u201dI hit her off with a shrug. It was a misunderstanding I didn\u2019t need to correct.Chae Nayun seemed to have concluded her guess as the truth, as she nodded with a proud face.\u201cHuhu, I knew it. Oh, I\u2019ll let you off the hook for using your personal weapon. Just don\u2019t use it again.\u201dChae Nayun got up and dusted her butt.Before walking away, she stopped and turned her head towards me.\u201c\u2026By the way.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201dWith her back still pointing my way, she asked in a much lower voice than before.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe question she asked indifferently made me flinch.This might be her offer of reconciliation, that she would forgive me for my insensitive remarks about her older brother. If I was right, from what I knew about Chae Nayun\u2019s personality, she was making a huge concession.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t.\u201dHowever, I rejected her offer clearly and also got up.My current relationship with Chae Nayun was at the perfect distance. Cold, yet not freezing. I called it the \u201cuncomfortable neighbor\u201d relationship. Anything more would be too much of a burden on me.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dWith that, Chae Nayun left.As I watched her leave, my eyes met Sven\u2019s. He didn\u2019t dodge my eyes. He tilted his head while looking at me with emotionless eyes. This sequence of action put a chill down my back.\u2014Emergency alert. All cadets are to leave the Dungeon immediately. Once again, all cadets are to leave the Dungeon immediately.A sound rang out from the ceiling. The mock Dungeon trial had come to an end.I turned back to return the way I came from.\u201cHuh?\u201dBut at that moment, I discovered a familiar person.It was Yoo Yeonha.Though others might only see a faint silhouette, I could clearly see Yoo Yeonha in the distance. It seemed she really climbed the wall, as she was covered in dust.But as everyone just heard, the mock Dungeon trial was over. In other words, she had gone through all that trouble for nothing.\u201cArgh\u2026\u201dWith her eyes closed, Yoo Yeonha shook at the injustice.**It seemed the mock Dungeon trial ran into several problems.The first problem was that many of the internal cameras had stopped working.The second was that was a systematic error. A problem had occurred with the distribution of people in charge of monitoring the situation, and as a result, the instructors had discovered the broken cameras too late.The third and final problem was that real monsters had trespassed into the Dungeon instead of mana puppets. This was the biggest problem.The mock Dungeon trial was canceled as a result, and everyone\u2019s grades were postponed as well.\u201cWow, really? A natural born Magma Golem?\u201d\u201cYeah, I heard it was intermediate ranked.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026 So what happened? Who killed it?\u201d\u201cIt was Chae Nayun and Sven\u2026\u201dThe cadets gathered outside the Dungeon chattered loudly, while the instructors checked people off to make sure there were no casualties.\u201cEhew.\u201d\u2018\u2026Then what was all the trouble I went through for?\u2019Yoo Yeonha let out a deep sigh. She staggered from the rising sense of emptiness and lethargy. Then, she discovered Chae Nayun who was walking around the Dungeon\u2019s entrance. Yoo Yeonha had many questions she wanted Chae Nayun to answer.\u201cNayun.\u201d\u201cHm? Oh, Yeonha. What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cAre you okay? I heard the Magma Golem\u2026\u201dAfter bringing up a topic she wasn\u2019t interested in, Yoo Yeonha brought up Kim Hajin when Chae Nayun seemed to be bored.\u201cOh right, you know Kim Hajin, right? The guy you brought up during our last\u2014\u201d\u201cMm? Ah~ Kim Hajin?\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s reaction was completely different than before. Previously, she growled when Kim Hajin\u2019s name was brought up, but now she looked completely fine talking about him.\u201cUh\u2026 Yeah, Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Remember what you said before? That he\u2014\u201dChae Nayun lightly cut her off.\u201cOh, that? It was a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dYoo Yeonha was so dumbfounded that she blurted out in polite speech.It was only a few days ago that you were coughing up blood while talking about him, and now you\u2019re saying it was a misunderstanding? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a misunderstanding now!\u201cIt was a misunderstanding, really. Well, I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s someone I want to be friends with, but he\u2019s not such a bad guy.\u201d\u2018Yep, that\u2019s right.\u2019 Chae Nayun nodded as though she was satisfied with her own judgment.Yoo Yeonha stared at Chae Nayun in a daze. She was so dumbfounded that she wanted to strangle her.\u201cOh, hey! Kim Suho!\u201dSuddenly, Chae Nayun shouted loudly. Yoo Yeonha felt like her eardrums would burst.\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, Yeonha!\u201dChae Nayun ran past Yoo Yeonha and disappeared. She was quick, like a puppy chasing after her master. Yoo Yeonha turned around to see just who she was waiting for. It was Kim Suho. Chae Nayun ran up to Kim Suho, who had just left the Dungeon, slapped his back, and stood in front of him as if to block his path.\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s surprised me.\u201d\u201cDid anything happen to your team?\u201d\u201c\u2026It was no joke. I almost died from exhaustion.\u201dFor the record, Kim Suho chose the 8th pathway.\u201cI can see that on your face. You look like a grandpa.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dYoo Yeonha watched their affectionate interaction with interest. She was happy seeing them hit off well together. Thinking about it now, Kim Suho did seem to resemble Chae Nayun\u2019s older brother.\u201cOh, Chae Nayun, here you are.\u201dAt that moment, Shin Jonghak cut in between them as if to break them apart.\u201cHuu.\u201dYoo Yeonha sighed. Since Shin Jonghak was there, Yoo Yeonha began to walk towards them. At that moment, she discovered a man staring at Chae Nayun from a distance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with him?\u201dThe man was Kim Hajin. But the way he was watching Chae Nayun seemed\u2026 strange. His eyes seemed to carry a heavy worry and a deep sadness. Yoo Yeonha stared at his disgusting eyes for a moment.It didn\u2019t take long for her to come to a conclusion.\u201cWhat, he likes Chae Nayun too? The heck\u2026 What\u2019s so good about a tomboy like her\u2026?\u201dYoo Yeonha trembled from the frustration rising from deep in her heart.But even if other men liked Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak couldn\u2019t.With such thought, she quickly walked over to Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, and Chae Nayun.1.

The Djinn and Gari Mountain (2)11 P.M.I finally returned to my room 12 hours after the start of the Mock Dungeon Trial.Cube told the cadets that an internal investigation would occur rather than deploying an external police or Heroes of the Hero Association. It was only possible thanks to no cadet being killed or injured.In other words, the Djinns making up the upper brass of Cube had succeeded in masking this incident. An extensive external investigation would only occur after the end of the \u2018second incident.\u2019\u201c\u2026I got super lucky.\u201dIn any case, the Fitness Center was closed because of the ruckus, so I was loafing around in my room, looking at my laptop.[An incredible luck applies, blocking a silent ambush!][Narrow Escape from Death (1/9) \u2013 A special stat, accumulation of luck, becomes partly unlocked!]As I thought, it was by pure luck that I dodged the poison arrow. Because of it, a special stat called accumulation of luck was unlocked.A special stat was\u2026 Well, to explain this, I had to first explain how stats worked.In this world, stats were divided into three major categories: variable stats, invariable stats, and special stats.Variable stats and invariable stats were something people were born with. Even a baby had strength, magic power, vitality, intelligence, and other basic stats.But special stats were something that most people didn\u2019t have. For example, every human was born with magic power, the power to wield mana. But they weren\u2019t born with \u2018magic power control\u2019 and \u2018mental power\u2019, which were needed to conjure and utilize magic power. These two abilities came from an innate talent and continuous effort.As a result, cadets generally had a different number of special stats. Most had two basic special stats \u2013 magic power control and mental power. In the case of Kim Suho, he also had an additional special stat called \u2018resistance\u2019, and Chae Nayun had an additional special stat called \u2018intuition\u2019.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201d[Accumulation of luck \u2013 11%]And I had just gotten one too.It was only 11% unlocked, so there really wasn\u2019t anything I could do with it. Plus, there was no explanation about the stat, so I didn\u2019t even know what it did.\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll found out eventually.\u2019The more important matter was Sven. I needed to know what he was planning. He was undoubtedly scheming on Chae Nayun, and he would likely lose control once he was alone with her. After all, one of the negative side-effects of a Djinn Contract was amplification of emotions and obsession.Should I contact Chae Nayun? \u2026No.I opened my laptop. It felt like a crime\u2026 no, it was most certainly a crime, but I didn\u2019t have any other choice.Using my laptop\u2019s Internet Access functionality, I accessed Chae Nayun\u2019s smartwatch. I only needed to spend a small amount of SP.[Chae Nayun \u2192 Kim Suho][Hey, what\u2019s up?][Shin Jonghak \u2192 Chae Nayun][Hey, do you want to go grab a late night snack?]Several messages were coming and going, and I tried my best to not look at them. The only conversation I needed to see was Sven\u2019s.As expected of Chae Nayun, she was receiving messages from several male and female cadets. I only found Sven\u2019s name after scrolling down for a while.===Sven: [Thank you for yesterday.][Yeah, you did well too. By the way, why do you keep using polite speech? It\u2019s uncomfortable.]Sven: [Is it? I\u2019ll talk casually then.]\u2026\u2026Sven: [I hear the hunting club is going to Gangwondo this week. Wanna hunt together?][Yeah, sure.]===It was a common conversation among colleagues, but Sven\u2019s last message caught my attention.\u2018Hunting club, this week.\u2019\u2018Hunt together.\u2019In the original story, this was also the day Sven went berserk.At that moment\u2026[Hajin.]I received a message on my smartwatch. When I saw the sender\u2019s name, I couldn\u2019t help but grow curious.It was Kim Suho.[Do you have time this Thursday?]\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201dWhy was Kim Suho contacting me all of the sudden? \u2026Oh, it\u2019s that.For the internal investigation of the previous incident, Cube decided to select the most trustworthy cadets from each grade to search for the culprit. The freshman year representatives were unsurprisingly Shin Jonghak, Kim Suho, and Chae Nayun.\u201c\u2026But isn\u2019t it too early?\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure of the exact date, but I remembered it being around early April. Currently, it was the end of March. The investigation team had formed quicker than I thought. Plus, I couldn\u2019t understand why he would contact me.[Why?][I can\u2019t tell you yet. I\u2019ll tell you about it when we meet in person. For now, just know that Nayun recommended you.]\u201cChae Nayun?\u201dWhy would Chae Nayun recommend me? Because I have good eyes?I hesitated. The time wasn\u2019t a good match. Classes were canceled for Wednesday and Thursday, so I planned on going to Gari Mountain Dungeon on Wednesday and the hunting club was on Thursday.I replied.[I\u2019m busy on Thursday, but I\u2019m free on Friday.][That\u2019s fine, we can meet then.]Kim Suho replied instantly.\u201c\u2026Well, it\u2019s better for me the closer I am to the storyline.\u201dAfter replying \u201cokay\u201d, I went back to looking at my laptop.Next on the list was Sven\u2019s social media accounts.**Gangwondo was Korea\u2019s biggest mountainous range. The region included Baekdu Mountain, which was known for its rich life energy, and other mountains like the Kumgang mountain, which were rich in spirit energy. As such, martial artists called this area the \u2018Mecca of Training.\u2019Because of the rich life energy and spirit energy in Gangwondo\u2019s mountains, it attracted all sorts of people including hunters, poachers, Heroes, and mercenaries.Among these were one special occupation known as ginseng digger.A ginseng digger was someone who searched the mountain grounds for ginseng. While they weren\u2019t strong enough to combat monsters, they traveled the world in search of ginseng with their sense of smell and sight heightened to the limit.Ginseng could be found in many countries, but the most expensive ginseng were found on the Korean Peninsula. Naturally, ginseng diggers were common in Gangwondo.Kim Yunjoon was also a ginseng digger.Gangwondo\u2019s ginseng sold for a sky-high price even if they were young, because ginseng increased the amount of mana in one\u2019s body. Kim Yunjoon didn\u2019t really understand what that meant, but he spent 10 years in Gangwondo\u2019s dangerous mountain ranges filled with monsters to dig up money.The last ginseng he discovered was a year ago. It was a 4-year-old ginseng. In other words, he had no income for a year, but because he received 300 million won from his last ginseng, his family didn\u2019t complain much.Today marked the twentieth time Kim Yunjoon climbed the Gari Mountain.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dJust like always, he walked with his eyes looking down. When he raised his head to wipe off his sweat, he discovered a young man. The young man wasn\u2019t ugly nor handsome. He was simply average. Still, his body seemed to be well-built, most likely because of the well-defined muscles on his arms and legs. It was a common feature among ginseng diggers.The man repeated walking, stopping, and looking at a map.\u201cA ginseng digger. But ginsengs aren\u2019t found on maps. He must be a newbie.\u201dKim Yunjoon grinned and walked towards him. The man turned around, having noticed his presence.Kim Yunjoon asked cheekily.\u201cAre you also a ginseng digger?\u201dThe man stared back at him in a daze before shaking his head.\u201cNo, I\u2019m just looking for a place.\u201dWith that, he hid his map behind him. Kim Yunjoon found his actions quite cute.\u201cHaha, I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but ginseng aren\u2019t something you can find with maps.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThat map, I don\u2019t know where you got it from, but don\u2019t believe it too much. Only Heaven knows where ginseng are.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe man tilted his head. Kim Yunjoon had a lot he wanted to say to this novice ginseng digger. He felt it was his responsibility as an elite ginseng digger.Kim Yunjoon then began to talk about his experience as a ginseng digger and showed his cutting-edge equipment. He explained how to dig to avoid damaging the ginseng, then showed pictures of his wife and 13 year old son before laughing and smacking the man\u2019s shoulder.\u201cWhen I see young\u2019uns climbing the mountain, I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re dreaming of striking a fortune. Jumping into the mountains with such a flimsy mindset is no different than throwing away your life. Forgive me for telling you all this, but I hope what I told you will come in handy.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yes.\u201dThe man nodded with a blank face. Kim Yunjoon could feel a deep admiration and respect in the man\u2019s eyes. Just that made his effort worthwhile.\u201cThen take care. I wish you good luck. In fact, I hope you can grow up to threaten me as a competitor. Don\u2019t forget the advice I gave you today.\u201dKim Yunjoon walked past the man. Just in case the man was watching him leave, he raised his hand and waved.*\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared at a man\u2019s back. Then, I looked down at the watch on my wrist. Unknowingly, 30 minutes had passed.\u201cWhat is he?\u201dI ended up wasting time because of some talkative guy. I wanted to cut him off in the middle, but I hesitated, thinking he might be a named herbalist.But I didn\u2019t find anything special from the pictures he showed me or his outer appearance. It seemed he was really just a normal ginseng digger.\u201cI think it\u2019s this way\u2026\u201dI looked at my map once again. The map pointed to the Gari Mountain Dungeon. The map was obtained from the Book of Truth. Just like a genie lamp, all I had to do was ask, \u201cWhere is the Gari Mountain Dungeon?\u201d, and it gave me this map.In fact, this map showed my live location, almost like a GPS system.Looking at my map, I continued towards the Dungeon\u2019s location.After about 10 minutes of walking\u2026\u201cUk!\u201dThud.I fell down after tripping on something.\u201cAgh, what is it now?\u201dI got up after falling pathetically. There was a stem of some sort tangled around my leg. At first, I was frightened out of my mind, thinking it was some plant type monster, but upon closer inspection, I noticed it was just an ordinary stem.\u201cWhew, that surprised me.\u201dI pulled on the stem. It didn\u2019t seem to go very deep, as I didn\u2019t need to put in much strength.But when I pulled the stem out of the ground, something resembling a bellflower root came out.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI threw the root on the ground. After dusting myself off, I took a step to continue walking, but I suddenly remembered what the man I just met told me.Ginseng.I looked at the root one more time. Now that I looked at it again, it did resemble a mandrake. I took out my laptop and read the description of the root in front of me.===[7-year-old Ginseng]\u2014A plant that achieved magic power on its own through condensed life energy and spiritual energy.

The Djinn and Gari Mountain (3)Ginseng served many purposes.Consuming it would increase one\u2019s stats, and grinding it down and using it as a medicinal ingredient would produce about ten high rank potions. One could even use it for a process called enchantment. In this process, the magic power contained within the ginseng was added to an item, giving it a special effect.But I didn\u2019t have the necessary equipment to make potions nor a connection with a magician to help with enchantment. As such, I could only eat it or sell it.\u201cEating it is a bit\u2026\u201dThis ginseng should go for 700 million won. Since I could use Violet Banquet to sell it, I didn\u2019t have to worry about being scammed even if I had to pay more in fees. If I sold it now, I could invest the money in stocks and easily get a return of 4~5 billion won. That was enough to buy 7 of the same ginseng.\u201c\u2026Argh, this is hard.\u201dThe unexpected fortune only increased my worry.For now, I put the ginseng away in my bag.I could think about this first-world problem after I found the Gari Mountain Dungeon.**Standing in front of a cave, I dusted my hands. Dirt rained down on the ground.\u201cSo this is why it hasn\u2019t been discovered until now.\u201dHuu. After taking a deep breath, I glanced behind me. An inch away from my feet was a razor-sharp cliff.The Gari Mountain Dungeon was located in the middle of a cliff, buried in moss and vines.I could feel my heart thumping. Even with Parkour, the journey had been too difficult. Without Stigma\u2019s magic power as insurance, I would have been too scared of falling to try.\u201cHmm.\u201dI looked into the dark cave without going in. My Thousand-Mile Eyes repelled the darkness and widened my vision. Not long afterward, I discovered the switch monster. It was a ghost.Just like in the original story, the Gari Mountain Dungeon was an undead dungeon.Monsters in this dungeon included dullahans, banshees, and other undead monsters which ranged from grade 9 to grade 3 of low-intermediate rank. The boss should be a death knight, so it was impossible for my current self to clear the Dungeon.In the first place, not even Tomer had fully cleared this Dungeon. A death knight was a high-intermediate rank grade 1 monster. Defeating it was impossible without a high-rank Hero.It seemed I would have to be content with just knowing where the Dungeon was. With my current strength, just beating the \u2018hidden stage\u2019 would be impossi\u2026\u201cNo.\u201dI looked into my bag. The ginseng I just picked up was strutting its glorious and tantalizing appearance.\u201c\u2026\u201dA hidden stage was a completely isolated space from the standard Dungeon, making it significantly easier to clear. In addition, this hidden stage\u2019s reward was better the quicker one took it. Above all, I didn\u2019t want to constantly worry about Tomer coming here quicker than in the original story.Like I said before, the hidden stage\u2019s reward was a formless weapon called Aether. Because of its lack of a clear form, it was easy to misunderstand it as a lump of magic power, but the reason Aether was called a weapon was because of this property. Because it had no form, it could change its form to whatever its user wanted. Furthermore, Aether was an evolving weapon.It was worth taking it early, even if I had to sacrifice the ginseng.Of course, I didn\u2019t mean I would use the entire ginseng.I took off three of the seven roots it had.===[7-year-old Ginseng Root]\u2014The root of a 7-year-old ginseng. Contains condensed magic power.===First, I tried changing the root\u2019s setting.\u2014For one hour, increases all variable stats by 4 points.Since I was editing the effect it already had, I thought it wouldn\u2019t cost too much SP.[You do not have enough SP.]But I was wrong. It seemed raising stats required more restrictions than I thought.Without any other choice, I modified the setting.\u2014For 30 minutes, increases all variable stats by 2 points.[5 SP will be used. Would you like to save?]This much was satisfactory.I modified two ginseng roots with the above setting. By eating them both, my stats would increase by 4 points for 30 minutes. My variable stats, other than magic power, would then be on par with Yoo Yeonha\u2019s.However, I gave the last ginseng root a different setting.\u2014Soaks into magic power and strengthens its power.[5 SP will be used. Would you like to save?]I hit [save].With this, I should be able to clear the hidden stage.I entered the cave with confidence. As soon as I stepped in, an extreme chill penetrated my body.\u201cUgh.\u201dI moved my legs forward as I watched my own breath.Ssssss.Hearing a strange sound, I hid behind the cave\u2019s wall. Within a distance I could see without using Thousand-Mile Eyes, a hologram-like ghost was wavering in the air.That was the switch monster.I could kill a monster of the level even without using a ginseng.I took out my Desert Eagle. My Gift, Master Sharpshooter, had already reached grade 8. Piercing the vital point of such a slow monster was easier than doing push-ups.I pulled the trigger.The bullet cut through the air and struck the ghost. The bullet phased through the ghost without doing any damage, but the magic power contained inside the bullet didn\u2019t. The magic power had hit the middle of its eyes perfectly.Shortly, the ghost exploded into light without a sound.At that moment, a strange wind blew from a direction, sucking in the ghost\u2019s light.That was where I had to go. The light led to the location of the hidden stage. There, an inferior version of a witch would be waiting for me.My eyes didn\u2019t miss the incredibly faint stream of light. I started following it.After about 10 minutes of walking, I finally arrived at a place that was isolated from the Dungeon.In the middle was a witch carrying Aether.I took out my laptop from my bag.Whiiiish.===[Witch]\u2014Evandel the Witch. Possesses a spirit body and produces low rank ghosts.===Witch.Countless number of monsters and devils appeared after Outcall, but the existences known as witches were rare. It was because it was difficult for a monster to be classified as a witch.First, a witch had to have the ability to produce ghosts. Because of the high number of undead monsters a witch produced, a witch\u2019s home was called a \u2018stronghold\u2019.Second, a witch needed to have a human body. Without a human body, a witch couldn\u2019t use her magic power properly.Finally, a witch needed to possess intelligence on par with humans, because a witch without intelligence couldn\u2019t distribute her ghosts efficiently.The reason the witch in front of me was an inferior version was because she didn\u2019t fully meet the second and third requirements.However, Evandel would one day become infamous.Adult witches were difficult to deal with, so the most efficient way of subjugating one was to kill it when it was young, when its intelligence and body weren\u2019t fully developed.But in the original story, Evandel was raised by Djinns, protected from stress and danger. After reaching adulthood and becoming independent, she established her stronghold in an abandoned school in Suwon.This stronghold, which came to be known as Evandel\u2019s Castle, became the most fearsome stronghold in history.The Hero Association famouly said that it was \u201cno different than a Tower.\u201dBy killing this inferior version of Evandel, I would obtain two things. One was Aether, and the other was Evandel\u2019s Seed. In the original story, Tomer only took Aether, giving Evandel\u2019s Seed to the followers of Isabel.Since I planned on taking both, I needed to kill Evandel. There was only one problem\u2026\u201c\u2026She\u2019s a child.\u201dHer appearance made me hesitate. She had a tiny face and was only 140 cm tall. With soft hands, she was squishing the soul of the ghost I just killed.Tomer had killed that child, and I had to do the same in a single attack.\u201cHuu.\u201dBut it had to be done. I was the one who created her anyways.After resolving myself, I released Stigma\u2019s magic power. A bullet would never be able to kill a witch in a spirit body. This was a matter of fact that wouldn\u2019t change no matter how much SP I invested. Attempting to do so would only be a waste of SP.\u2018Light attribute, spear.\u2019I breathed my will into Stigma\u2019s magic power. The attribute I wanted was light, and the form I wanted was a spear.The weapon I wanted was created using all of Stigma\u2019s magic power, but its size and sharpness were horrible. In the first place, the amount of magic power in Stigma wasn\u2019t enough to form even a single arrow properly. So, forming a perfect spear was being too greedy.But I had a method of sharpening this spear. I placed a ginseng root on the spear. The spear devoured the ginseng, increasing its size and luster.Next, I swallowed the two ginseng roots I modified before.Immediately, I could feel my body surging with vitality.4 points\u2026 no, it was probably less since I took one on top of the other. Still, my body felt completely different than before. My muscles were brimming with strength, as though they were ready to explode at any moment. I felt hot, yet light, like I was no longer human, but rather a radioactive monster of some sort.Breathing roughly, I looked down at my body. My body was bulked up and my five senses had become extremely sensitive.As I thought, the spear was the best choice for displaying the most destructive power with amplified stats.\u201c\u2026Huup!\u201dI hurled the spear with all my strength. The magic spear shot through the air like a flash of lightning without deviating from its intended path. The moment I let go, the spear had already pierced through Evandel\u2019s head.\u2014\u2026?But Evandel survived. With the spear stuck in her head, Evandel turned towards me. I felt an unprecedented terror at the gory scene. A muddy stream coalesced on her hands. A vengeful spirit was taking shape.\u201cUm, wait, can we just talk this out?\u201d\u2014Uuaaang\u2026However, in the next moment, Evandel collapsed with a strange cry. Life energy disappeared from her body, and a seed fell down to the ground.\u201c\u2026Was it an instinctive reaction before death?\u201dAfter calming my beating heart, I walked up and picked up the seed.Then, I walked forward into the darkness. A slime-like weapon with a blue glow, this was the weapon that made Tomer into one of the executives of Wicked.Before I reached forward, I checked its description with my laptop.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu===[Aether][Mystic \u2013 Formless] [Evolving]A corporeal but formless weapon.

Same Bed, Different Dreams (1)\u201cAh\u2026\u201dA short groan left my mouth. My body ached everywhere. Skeleton bones were littered around me, and I was lying on the ground.It was a difficult fight. I had no talent for close ranged combat, but I didn\u2019t want to waste precious bullets on skeletons, so I transformed Aether into a club to use as a melee weapon. Now that the ginseng\u2019s effect had worn off, I wondered why I did something so bold. It seemed it was true that a strong mind arose from a strong body.\u201cI would have died if they were black skeletons\u2026\u201dEach time I swung the club, I destroyed three to four white skeletons. That was how strong my body was, but the fight had still taken 25 minutes. If the monster I fought weren\u2019t the low ranked white skeletons\u2026 I didn\u2019t even want to imagine the outcome.\u201cAgh.\u201dI raised my upper body and pondered as I scratched my back using a skeleton\u2019s bone.I managed to obtain Aether and Evandel\u2019s Seed. It was the biggest accomplishment I made since being transported into my novel.To confirm my achievement, I opened my laptop.[A fraction of the ginseng\u2019s effect melts into your body. Your strength and stamina increases by 0.02 points!][You obtained 47 SP.]But what I gained from the system wasn\u2019t much. Was it because Aether wasn\u2019t a well-known weapon at this point? It wasn\u2019t much SP.===\u25b7Variable Stats[Strength 2.455][Stamina 2.545][Speed 2.85][Perception 3.705][Vitality 2.465][Magic power 1.925]===But the increase in variable stats was something to note. Thanks to Aether boosting each stat by 0.6 points, my stats looked much better. Now that my core stats were above 2, I was now on the level of a cadet, though I was still at the bottom of the barrel.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s time to go now.\u201dAfter appreciating the numbers for some time, I closed the laptop. It was time to go back. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could walk properly, but if I stayed here any longer and was discovered by a monster, that would be the end of me.I forced my creaking body up and began to walk back the way I came from.**At 10 P.M., I finally came back to the dorm, barely making it before curfew.I headed to the shower immediately after I opened the door and washed away the dirt covering my body. Because of the rough work-out I had, the warm water gave me a refreshing feeling.\u201cPhew.\u201dAfter turning off the shower head, I wiped myself off. I could see the 0.6 point stat increase on my body. Even without flexing or holding my breath, there was a clear six-pack on my stomach. \u2026Though, I guess it was the same for other cadets.I stopped fooling around in front of the mirror and got out of the bathroom.After putting on my underwear, I put my laptop and Evandel\u2019s Seed on the desk.\u201cI brought it but\u2026\u201d===[Evandel\u2019s Seed]\u2014Seed containing the soul of Evandel the witch.===When this seed germinates, \u2018Evandel\u2019 the Witch of Despair would be born. Her title made her sound evil, but if utilized correctly, she could become a valuable ally. The environment where one grew up was the most important thing in raising any living being. So, I just had to raise her well.Feeding the seed was simple. Instead of water, I just had to give it small amounts of blood. A witch\u2019s personality and growth were dependent on who the blood came from. Chae Nayun\u2019s or Kim Suho\u2019s blood would be the best, but acquiring them wasn\u2019t easy.\u201cI\u2019ll just hold onto you for now.\u201dI wrapped Evandel\u2019s Seed in a handkerchief and put it in a drawer. Chae Nayun and Kim Suho were model citizens who regularly donated blood. Perhaps, I could pull some tricks to acquire their blood packs.Next, I accessed Chae Nayun\u2019s smartwatch to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s event.Coincidentally, she was currently talking with Sven.===Sven: [You\u2019re coming to the club tomorrow, right?][Yeah, when are we meeting?]Sven: [Come to the Portal at 4.][Why so early?]Sven: [The meeting place is in Gangwondo, so let\u2019s bet on who will get more kills before the seniors arrive.][Sure, that sounds nice.]===From the looks of it, they seemed to have gotten fairly close. The meeting time was 5 P.M. according to the club announcement, but Sven had asked to meet an hour early.4 P.M.After noting the time in my head, I accessed Violet Banquet to sell the ginseng I picked up. Packhorse Master\u2019s stock price was going up. I had wanted to buy more before it was too late.[Violet Banquet Online Auction House][Item for Sale][Description \u2013 7-year-old ginseng dug from Gangwondo\u2019s mountain.][Please place the item on the Portal for appraisal.]A circular hologram projected out of the laptop screen. Once I placed the ginseng on it, it would be transported to Violet Banquet\u2019s appraisal center, and the item would go on auction once the appraisal was complete.I couldn\u2019t explain how this technology worked. A Portal was created from magic engineering, but I had no clue how it could be projected remotely. Modern technology wasn\u2019t advanced enough to achieve such a feat.But Violet Banquet could do it.The reason was simple. Violet Banquet itself was the reward of \u2018Tower of Information\u2019.Just like the textbook said, Towers gave rewards that were beyond anyone\u2019s imagination.[The item has been transported. The appraisal result will come out within the next 24 hours.]After seeing the ginseng disappear into the Portal, I closed the laptop.**Thursday, 3:30 P.M.I got dressed before it was too late. Thanks to the modified fatigue recovery potion, I was at my peak condition. Now, I just had to \u201ccoincidentally\u201d join up with Sven and Chae Nayun, and prevent them from being together. I wanted to chase Sven out if possible, but that was beyond my ability.I left the dorm and arrived at the bus station. A bus arrived not long after, but I passed it by. I had to wait for someone. Thankfully, she was noticeable from a mile away.Just like now, her face radiated light wherever she went.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dChae Nayun at least acknowledged my existence. I tilted my head nonchalantly.Sven should already be waiting at the Portal Station, but I knew Chae Nayun would be late. That was just how her personality was, and I had also peeked at the message she sent Sven.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get on the bus?\u201dChae Nayun asked. For a moment, I flinched. So she was watching me waiting for the bus. Come to think of it, Chae Nayun had good eyes as well.\u201cI was hesitating. I came out too early, so there was too much time left over until the club meeting. I just decided to go through, since I don\u2019t have anything better to do.\u201d\u201cOh? What club are you in?\u201d\u201cHunting.\u201d\u201cHunting? I\u2019m in hunting too, and I don\u2019t remember seeing you\u2026\u201dThe bus arrived while Chae Nayun was talking. I hopped in, and Chae Nayun followed.\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the orientation. That\u2019s probably why.\u201dI spoke as I sat down on a seat.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dChae Nayun sat down across from me. Then, she glanced at me with doubtful eyes before opening her mouth.\u201cJust how many clubs are you in? I heard from Yeonha that you were in her club.\u201d\u201cThree.\u201d\u201cWow, what a waste of time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in two too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 So what?\u201dI forced myself to smile before closing my eyes. I didn\u2019t want to continue this conversation any longer. Chae Nayun didn\u2019t seem to mind ending the conversation either.Without talking for the rest of the bus ride, Chae Nayun and I arrived at the Portal Station. I could see Sven in the distance. He ran towards the bus as soon as he saw it, but he paused momentarily when he saw me. But soon, he walked up with a smile.\u201cYou came earlier than I expected.\u201d\u201cMhm. Oh right, Sven, you know him, right? He\u2019s the one who helped us before. Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. Hey.\u201dSven reached his hand out and I grabbed it. Sven tried to let go immediately, but I didn\u2019t let him. I grasped his hand firmly and stared into his eyes. Black, lifeless eyes. My Gift of observation peered into his pupils. I could catch a glimpse of Asmodeus\u2019 evil energy.\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201dChae Nayun stepped in and separated me from Sven. No, she separated Sven from me.\u201cWhy are you picking a fight?\u201dShe snapped at me sharply. I turned around without saying anything and walked to the Portal Station\u2019s entrance.I wasn\u2019t particularly skilled in distinguishing the state of Djinns. But Sven was undoubtedly on a dangerous edge. I could tell simply by looking at my laptop.[In the original story, he dies after going berserk without accomplishing anything.][Modified setting \u2013 Increased self-control and mental power to help him better control Asmodeus\u2019 power.]**We arrived at a residential area in Gangwondo.As Gangwondo had high mana density, there were many monsters and wild animals. As such, the hunting club, Leonidas, obtained the cooperation of the local government and residents to hunt in this area. By hunting wild animals that frequently invaded the residential area, the cadets would be helping citizens while enjoying their hobbies.\u201cYou met on the way here?\u201dAt the club\u2019s meeting place, Sven asked Chae Nayun.\u201cYeah.\u201dChae Nayun narrowed her eyes and observed Kim Hajin\u2019s movements. He was sitting on a rock and looking at his watch.He kept doing this. While pretending to be oblivious to his surroundings, he kept loitering around them.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look like he\u2019s following us?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSven stared at Kim Hajin for a while before continuing.\u201cBe careful.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cYou heard about cadets going missing lately, right?\u201d\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cHe has an alibi.\u201dDuring the estimated time of the third victim, there was a record of Kim Hajin using a Portal. So Chae Nayun had recommended Kim Hajin to the Djinn investigation team. After all, Yoo Yeonha, who was known for her objective judgment, praised his eyesight.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dChae Nayun fell in thought as she rubbed her chin.Though he wasn\u2019t a suspect in the case, there was indeed something strange about him. Even today, Kim Hajin clearly skipped a bus to take the next one with me.\u201d\u2026It\u2019s not that he likes me, I think.\u201dBut thinking about it now, it wasn\u2019t completely absurd.If bringing up my older brother was to draw my attention, it all made sense. Not to mention, the unusually aggressive stance he took against Sven today\u2026 Oh, and even before then, at the National Weapons Museum, his partner should have been Yoo Yeonha, but he was at the museum for some reason.Of course, it was only a suspicion for now. But if that was really his intention, he was going at it the wrong way. Trying to draw someone\u2019s attention by harassing them was disgusting and shameless, and following someone around secretly was no different than stalking.\u201c\u2026Nah, no way.\u201dChae Nayun shook her head and got rid of the suspicions in her head.It didn\u2019t make sense. She couldn\u2019t even remember if they had met before the museum incident.Of course, she knew there were lots of guys who had a crush on her. Not just many, but a truckload\u2026 But still\u2026\u201cLook, the others are here.\u201dAt that moment, Sven pointed ahead. Chae Nayun became startled and looked up.The hunting club\u2019s leader and other first and second years were walking over.**[546,000,000]12 hours after the start of the auction, my ginseng was sold. 546 million won. Even after the 11% auction fee, it was close to 500 million won. That was with four missing roots too (I snapped another one off in case of an emergency). Now if I threw all this into stocks\u2026\u201cNow, come closer everyone!\u201dA cheerful voice rang out. I turned towards the direction of the voice. The club leader and other members had arrived.Today\u2019s event would finally start.But to be honest, I didn\u2019t know much about today\u2019s event. I only roughly wrote the conclusion.[Chae Nayun was gravely injured by a berserk Djinn, and Sven dissipated into dust.]That was it. The whole point of this event was to get Kim Suho to think about Chae Nayun.Because of today\u2019s event, Kim Suho would mistake Chae Nayun to be the Djinn\u2019s target, and while everyone was paying attention to Chae Nayun, Yoo Yeonha would be kidnapped. It was something like that.But the biggest problem was that Sven had changed from the original story. He became calmer and more elaborate. Since he could use Asmodeus\u2019 power better, Chae Nayun might suffer a more disgraceful situation.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see everyone again. Again, our hunting club helps citizens by hunting wild animals, the so-called killing two birds with one stone.\u201dThe talkative club leader began his speech.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh, by the way, who might you be? I don\u2019t recall seeing you in the orientation.\u201dBut suddenly, he stopped his speech and asked me.\u201cI\u2019m Kim Hajin. I couldn\u2019t attend the orientation due to a personal matter.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s fine. We didn\u2019t do much on the orientation. For today\u2026\u201dI looked for Chae Nayun while ignoring the club leader. I found her almost instantly, but I jumped mildly in surprise.Chae Nayun was also staring at me. Fixedly, with a suspicious look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Same Bed, Different Dreams (2)I climbed a mountain, and from the numerous trees on its peak, I chose the tallest red pine to climb. From the treetop, I looked around. I could see everything within the horizon. Neither the densely packed pine trees nor the countless number of leaves could impede the Thousand-Mile Eyes.Everything was within my sight \u2013 a young nameless cadet chasing after a wild boar, a second-year couple who were making out instead of hunting, Chae Nayun who was skillfully shooting her arrows, and Sven who was throwing pebbles by a creek.Chae Nayun and Sven separated for their bet on who would hunt more wild animals. As such, Chae Nayun was focused on hunting, but Sven wasn\u2019t. He was staring fixedly at the creek. It clearly wasn\u2019t to hunt a wild animal.But then, something strange happened. From the opposite side of the creek, a wild animal appeared. It was a leopard cat, one of the most common animals. Sven did not even glimpse at it, but a tentacle shot out of his back, flying towards the leopard cat like a spear and piercing its neck. The leopard cat was then dragged towards Sven on a skewer.Clearly, it was Asmodeus\u2019 power.His hunting continued in this way for an hour. Chae Nayun searched for wild animals herself, while Sven killed any wild animal that came within a 300-meter range of him without moving a finger.Then, seemingly because their promised time was over, the two of them joined up at the creek.\u2014A total of six. Three wild boars, one leopard cat, and two rabbits.Chae Nayun spoke proudly.\u2014As you can see, I killed eight.Sven smiled as he pointed at the wild animals piled up next to him. Immediately, Chae Nayun jaws dropped.\u2014Really?Chae Nayun approached the pile of corpses and confirmed Sven\u2019s words.\u2014Wow, you weren\u2019t kidding. How did you find eight?Chae Nayun sat down next to Sven as she ruffled her hair.\u2014You brought them from somewhere, didn\u2019t you? How much did you pay?She joked as she poked Sven\u2019s arm.From my perspective, it did look like Chae Nayun was leading him on. In reality, she was probably doing it thoughtlessly.\u2014So now you have to grant me a wish, right?\u2014\u2026Tsk, yeah. What do you want?They had bet on a wish.I was beginning to understand why Sven lost control.\u2014Um\u2026\u2014Yeah?\u2014\u2026Sven looked straight into Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes. Then, he shook his head with a grin.\u2014No, it\u2019s nothing.\u2014What is it? Tell me.I took out my gun from Stigma\u2019s extradimensional space. I was about a kilometer away, but I could snipe from here without a problem.Wheesh. Aether adhered to the gun and increased its performance.\u2014You see\u2026Why Sven went berserk made sense if he confessed and was rejected. Sven had fallen in love at first sight when he saw Chae Nayun at the beginning of the school year. In addition, Asmodeus, the devil Sven was contracted to, was the Devil of Lust. Endurance hardly existed in a Djinn with amplified emotions and obsession.\u2014I like you.\u2014\u2026Huh?Chae Nayun frowned at the sudden confession.\u2014What are you saying so suddenly?\u2014\u2026You don\u2019t like me?\u2014Of course I don\u2019t. It\u2019s been, what, two days since we first talked to each other? You expect me to fall in love with you in two days? Well, maybe you did, but I didn\u2019t.Chae Nayun got up coldly. Sven drooped his head. He was only rejected, but his body was already beginning to transform. Black magic power was rising from parts of his body.I aimed my gun at his head.\u2014Plus, I like men who are stronger than me.\u2014\u2026Than you?\u2014Yeah, and you\u2019re much weaker than me, so I can\u2019t see you as a man.With that, the switch was triggered. Sven\u2019s eyes turned blood red.Though he managed to endure it until now, Sven was only an extra. And this was an extra\u2019s limit.\u2014\u2026Really?Sven got up. Chae Nayun spoke without turning around to look.\u2014Yeah. So don\u2019t contact me from now. I\u2019m sorry, but I think cutting off our relationship cleanly will be better than staying friends and giving you false hope.Sven leaned towards Chae Nayun. At the same time, I fired. The target point was Sven\u2019s head. But the actual location of impact was his shoulder. It was because of the distance between us and the fact that Sven moved.Sven must have planned to jump on Chae Nayun, but because of my bullet, he lost his balance and ended up headbutting her instead.\u2014Uk!Chae Nayun flew forward after beating struck by Sven. However, she landed without shock with an agile forward roll. She quickly turned around.Immediately, she saw Sven whose body had half transformed into a Djinn.\u2014You, you!\u2014\u2026Sven glared at Chae Nayun and sent his tentacles after her.I fired consecutively. One, two, three, four\u2026 I emptied the magazine. Even while she was bewildered at the mysterious support, Chae Nayun did what she needed to do.She quickly jumped back to gain distance before firing her bow. An arrow penetrated Sven\u2019s shoulder. But even with an arrow sticking out of him, Sven ran towards Chae Nayun and grabbed her head.\u2014But I\u2019m\u2026He then slammed her on the ground while shouting loudly.\u2014\u2026stronger than you!Boom!Sven sat on Chae Nayun in a mount position. Chae Nayun struggled and gathered magic power in her hand. In the blink of an eye, the magic power condensed into the shape of a dagger. However, Sven grabbed her wrist before she could make her move.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help her from this distance. Sven\u2019s body was covered with reinforced magic power. Ordinary bullets couldn\u2019t penetrate this barrier, but using a light bullet was also impossible. Because Chae Nayun was right under him, she would be swept in as well.With no other choice, I jumped from tree to tree. At the same time, I changed the Desert Eagle into its shotgun form. I had to get close and blow up his head, which had weaker magic power reinforcement due to his incomplete Djinn transformation.The 1km distance was shortened in a moment.Landing smoothly on the ground, I approached Sven and Chae Nayun.\u201cUup, uup!\u201dSven had kept Chae Nayun alive. As I said before, Asmodeus was the Devil of Lust. It was clear what Asmodeus\u2019 contracted Djinn would want to do.Seeing Sven licking Chae Nayun\u2019s face, I frowned in disgust and put the gun barrel next to his head. The coldness of the steel made Sven shudder. His eyeballs rolled towards me.I pulled the trigger immediately. The shotgun shell tore through Sven\u2019s head and messed up its inside. Sven flew away, screaming.\u201cKek, kek.\u201d\u201cThankfully, you\u2019re alive.\u201dI looked down at Chae Nayun. Her face was wet with saliva and there were wounds on her body, but she was alive.Trying to fool around and dying in vain, this was precisely the special trait of Djinns of Lust.\u201cStand\u2026\u201dWhen I reached my hand out to Chae Nayun, a tentacle came flying at me.Aether instantly formed a shield and protected me from the first strike. But Sven flew towards me using his tentacle. He lightly struck Aether\u2019s shield away and grabbed my neck.\u201cUuuk!\u201dIt was an indescribable pain. As I was getting choked, I was deprived of oxygen. I couldn\u2019t breathe, and I couldn\u2019t talk. All I could do was struggle\u2026\u2026My vision began to turn cloudy. I couldn\u2019t feel my limbs. My body felt numb, but I didn\u2019t see anything like my life flashing before my eyes.My thoughts cut off and my pulse began to slow.I closed my eyes. I was unfamiliar with the sensation of death.\u2014Let go, you bastard!Like a bolt of lightning, someone\u2019s shout woke my consciousness from falling asleep.Chae Nayun was flying up behind Sven\u2019s back.She swung an incredibly long longsword. From Sven\u2019s shoulder to his waist, the sword cleanly severed him in half.\u201c\u2026Puhak.\u201dSven collapsed in two halves, and I gasped for air on the ground.This was the first time I felt so thankful to have oxygen.Haa\u2026 haa\u2026 haa\u2026After three big pants, I leaned against a tree trunk.\u201cHuu\u2026 Wow, what was that, a lightsaber?\u201dThen, I spoke nonchalantly while pointing at the longsword in Chae Nayun\u2019s hands.Chae Nayun had formed a sword purely with magic power. The sword blade surged with magic power, while the handle was calm without movement. I knew just how difficult it was to achieve this perfect harmony. Even Kim Suho wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. It was only possible for Chae Nayun, as this was a part of her true Gift.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe magic power sword in her hands disappeared. Chae Nayun and I stared at each other silently.The more I looked at her, the more I realized what poor state she was in. She was bleeding profusely from her wounds, and her clothes were ripped to shreds, revealing her underwear. I took off my coat and pushed it to her. But Chae Nayun only stared at it.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201dShe asked a strange question instead of taking the coat like I said.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201c\u2026What about you? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dThud.Chae Nayun collapsed as soon as she said that.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was only obvious with how much magic power she used.I flipped her over so that she was facing the sky and put my coat over her. Then, I stared at the spot Sven was.Without a sound, without leaving behind a single trace of his existence, Sven dissipated into thin air. This was the death of a Djinn. As humans contracted devils using their souls as the price, they belonged to their contracted devil even in death.Chwaaa\u2014The trees cried somberly.Tomorrow, Germany would receive a tragic news.**Sssss\u2014Chae Nayun opened her eyes at the sound of ruffling leaves and the wind\u2019s chilling breeze. The sky was completely dark. But before she could question where she was, an intense pain swept her head like a tsunami. Chae Nayun clutched her head. A pain similar to glass shards tearing up her head disappeared after tormenting her for a long time.\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201dOnce the pain died down, Chae Nayun collected her breath while still lying down on the ground.Only then did she remember what happened.\u201cWas it a dream?\u201dEverything she experienced felt so distant, and she naturally wondered if it was all a dream. But the wounds on her body and the coat covering her told her it was all real.\u201c\u2026Oh, right.\u201dChae Nayun raised her upper body.But at that moment, she discovered the silhouette of a man and shouted in surprise.\u201cAh! Oh god, you scared me!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201dIt was Kim Hajin. Leaned against a tree, he was staring at his smartwatch. It was Kim Hajin again. Every time something happened, he was always there.\u2026Though, it was also thanks to him that she escaped from death three times.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201c10 at night.\u201d\u201cWhat? It\u2019s curfew soon.\u201dChae Nayun tried to get up quickly. But she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Wondering what was going on, she tried to move them again. Still, neither moved. No matter how many times she tried, they didn\u2019t budge.An indescribable terror swept over her, making her heart beat loudly.\u201cW-What, m-m-my legs, what\u2019s w-wrong with m-my\u2026\u201d\u201cMagic power exhaustion. Is it your first time?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? Magic power exhaustion?\u201dMagic power exhaustion. Chae Nayun had heard about it. The dictionary definition was \u2018a state in which a person was completely drained of magic power.\u2019Once a person completely used up his magic power, his magic power recovery rate would be lowered drastically, and he would be bedridden for at least two days.\u201cYep.\u201dAfter a short retort, Kim Hajin approached Chae Nayun. Then, he kneeled down with his back pointing towards her.This incomprehensible action made Chae Nayun furrow her brows.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGet on. You can\u2019t walk.\u201d\u201cDo I look crazy?\u201d\u201c\u2026Then what, you want to stay here forever?\u201dKim Hajin\u2019s look of pity was nothing short of humiliation.But she didn\u2019t have any other choice. She would be troubled without his help.Chae Nayun wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled herself up.\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dKim Hajin slowly began to descend the mountain.Watching the distant scenery, Chae Nayun fell in thought, \u2018Sven was a Djinn. Then was he the culprit behind the cadets\u2019 disappearances? Djinns were people who were once humans, so since when was Sven a Djinn? And where did Kim Hajin pop out from? Don\u2019t tell me, was he constantly following me around?\u2019\u2018This guy\u2026 Does he really like me?\u2019Chae Nayun needed more time to process everything that happened today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Exam Period (1)10:55 P.M. I safely arrived at Gangwondo\u2019s Portal Station with Chae Nayun. Thankfully, there weren\u2019t many people around. I put Chae Nayun down on a nearby bench. She glanced at her smartwatch and murmured.\u201cIt\u2019s almost curfew.\u201dImmediately, I became speechless. Going to Cube in her current state was ridiculous.\u201cContact your father.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou know why. Go get treated at a hospital.\u201dI turned to the Portal, leaving Chae Nayun alone on the bench.\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d\u201cTo Cube. You can give my coat back later.\u201d\u201cTake me too! Hey! Aak!\u201dChae Nayun tried to get up and fell forward. Looking at her pitiful state, I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201c\u2026You should really go to a hospital.\u201dChae Nayun clenched her teeth and glared at me. Her lips trembled. It seemed she really didn\u2019t want to call her father.It was understandable. Chae Nayun\u2019s father was the head of a chaebol group. He was a busy and important man. Even though he would run over the moment he heard his daughter was hurt, Chae Nayun didn\u2019t want that.\u201cYou have a butler or an attendant, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, you can go.\u201dChae Nayun retorted curtly.\u201cAlright.\u201dI walked towards the Portal employee, then stopped.I suddenly remembered something. Today, Chae Nayun subconsciously unleashed her Gift. The magic power sword that cut down a Djinn in a single slash, that was the Gift Chae Nayun needed to develop.\u201cHey, are you still going to use a bow?\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou felt it today, didn\u2019t you?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s Gift was specialized for close ranged combat. More specifically, it was specialized for war.As long as she had a conductor of magic power, she could amplify it tremendously. For example, her Gift could transform a 2-meter sword into a monstrous 20-meter sword. Furthermore, because magic power was weightless, the transformed sword wouldn\u2019t be any heavier.In a way, it was similar to Sun Wukong\u2019s Jingu Bang[1]. The only difference was that Chae Nayun didn\u2019t need a legendary grade weapon to display a similar strength.Slaughtering hundreds of monsters with a single blow, an imperial might capable of making Djinns shudder in fear, \u2018Emperor of the Battlefield\u2019 would be the epithet given to her.\u201cYou should be using a sword, not a bow.\u201dJust like in the original story, large weapons like zweihander or claymore suited her best. She even had the financial power to purchase the most expensive weapons.\u201cOh yeah? What do you know about me?\u201dBut Chae Nayun didn\u2019t know her future. She refused to even accept the idea.The current Chae Nayun had yet to overcome her fear of close ranged combat.\u201c\u2026Nevermind then.\u201dI stepped into the Portal.I could feel a resentful gaze piercing into my back.She might be thinking, \u2018is he really going to leave me here?\u2019 But yes, I was planning to do exactly that.**The next day.Just like the saying, \u2018nothing travels faster than words\u2019, last night\u2019s matter was already widespread.Chae Nayun was attacked by a Djinn, and the Djinn was a cadet named Sven. Chae Nayun came out victorious, but she was seriously injured\u2026But even in the midst of such rumor, Friday\u2019s class resumed normally. My meeting with Kim Suho wasn\u2019t delayed either. He asked me to come to room 303 before 5 P.M.\u201cIt\u2019s an important matter, so don\u2019t forget! If it goes well, it can improve your grade too.\u201dAfter class, he reminded me once more. He should have heard about what happened to Chae Nayun, so he was probably planning on visiting her after the meeting.\u201cYeah.\u201dI nodded. Kim Suho tapped on my shoulder and busily walked away. I yawned while looking at his back.Since it was 3:30, I still had some time before the meeting. I wanted to go back to the dorm and take a nap.But while I was talking down the hallway\u2026\u201c\u2026What?\u201dIt felt like someone was following me. But when I turned around, no one was there. The presence was too calm to be a Djinn. Then was it an assassin? Why would an assassin be following me?\u201cHm.\u201dWas I mistaken? I took out my laptop and continued walking.[383,013,160 points have been deposited. These points can be used in Violet Banquet or traded for cash. (at least 10,000,000 P required)]Because of Violet Banquet\u2019s enormous fee, what was close to 600 million won had shrunk to 400 million. But there was no reason to think it was unfair. First trade with Violet Banquet was always like this.[Purchaser \u2018Youngfly\u2019 has requested to talk to you. (Seller\u2019s nickname will show up as anonymous.)][If you have any more ginsengs, I\u2019d like to buy them.]I didn\u2019t accept his request. I didn\u2019t have any ginsengs to sell either.\u2026Now.I turned around quickly.Shashashak\u2014In a flash, someone hid behind the wall. However, my eyes could see through walls.\u2026It was a rather unexpected person.Rachel.With her back stuck to the wall, she was holding her beating heart.\u201cHm, was I mistaken?\u201dTo understand why she was following me, I turned back around. Then, I turned off the laptop. Using its black screen as a mirror, I looked behind me.When I started walking, Rachel peeked her head out. Her gaze was fixed on my bag.But why my bag? The only thing in it was a notebook. Ah, thinking about it now, this was the way to the library. The dorm was right next to it.\u201c\u2026Is she trying to steal my notebook?\u201dNo, a princess wouldn\u2019t do something like that. Besides, there wasn\u2019t anything worthwhile in it.I continued to walk and Rachel tenaciously chased after me. She didn\u2019t stop until I entered my dorm.\u201cShe really followed me all the way here?\u201dWhen I looked out from the dorm window, she was glaring at the dorm with a regretful face.Interesting.I walked into my room with a grin.**After taking a light nap, I left the dorm and arrived at room 303 Kim Suho told me about.There was already quite a crew gathered here \u2013 Shin Jonghak, Yoo Yeonha, Kim Horak, and Yi Yeonghan.It almost looked like a scene from my novel, Kim Suho and his friend versus Shin Jonghak and his lackeys. Even Kim Horak, who was the weakest one here, had a fairly important role until the middle of the story. I felt completely out of place.They didn\u2019t say anything when they saw me, so I opened my mouth first.\u201cWhy did you call me?\u201dI asked, pretending not to know. But just that innocent question was enough to make Shin Jonghak frown. Thankfully, Kim Suho explained before Shin Jonghak expressed his dissatisfaction.\u201cI haven\u2019t told Hajin why we\u2019re meeting yet.\u201d\u201cSo, what is it?\u201dKim Suho stood up at my question.He should\u2019ve just stayed sitting. His height made me slightly uncomfortable. I set his height as 185 cm. Now, I was slightly regretting it.\u201cHajin, you\u2019ve heard about cadets going missing, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about that. Cube entrusted us to investigating the cause. Of course, they\u2019re going to do their own investigation, but since it\u2019s likely that the culprit is a student, they think it\u2019ll be easier for students to investigate.\u201dI was about to nod nonchalantly, but after realizing that this was supposed to be my first time hearing about this, I dropped my jaws pretending to be surprised.\u201c\u2026But why me?\u201d\u201cYou have good eyes. I heard you can see over a thousand miles away.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah\u2026 I do have good eyes.\u201dSo it really was for that single reason? I feigned a smile and sat down on a nearby chair. As a result, Kim Suho naturally came to sit at the table\u2019s head.Kim Suho looked into my eyes and asked.\u201cWill you help us?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can, but\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t want to give up on potential SP.\u201cThanks.\u201dKim Suho smiled happily. He then cleared his throat and brought up yesterday\u2019s incident.\u201cFirst, I don\u2019t think the Djinn who attacked Nayun is this incident\u2019s culprit. But\u2026\u201dShin Jonghak interrupted him.\u201cNayun?\u201dHe was picking at the fact that he didn\u2019t address Chae Nayun with her last name.\u201c\u2026But I think there is a high chance that Chae Nayun is the real culprit\u2019s next target. Djinns follow their contracted devil\u2019s orders, so if Sven\u2019s contracted devil ordered him to attack Chae Nayun, it makes sense that another Djinn would go after her.\u201dIt was a good theory, but incorrect. Sven\u2019s contracted devil and the culprit\u2019s contracted devil weren\u2019t the same. In the first place, Asmodeus and Lilith had completely different dispositions.\u201cSo I\u2019m wondering, can you think of anyone suspicious? Someone you know who recently has been acting strangely\u2026\u201dBefore the real investigation began, Kim Suho asked for everyone\u2019s opinions. But no one stepped forward, and Yoo Yeonha was staring at me fixedly. Soon, Shin Jonghak and Kim Horak also turned their gaze towards me.I knew the real culprit.But I was hesitant to reveal his name without any proof.The culprit should be leaving behind traces of his act, but he was going too quickly. In the original story, six people went missing in the span of two months, but in this storyline, three people had gone missing in just two weeks.I felt guilty letting more people die just so I could wait for the story to catch up. At this rate, there could even be more victims than in the original story.Perhaps, it was better to throw down his name, so the investigation team had an idea where to start.\u201cYeah, I have someone in mind.\u201dFive pairs of eyes became focused on me.\u201cWho?\u201dKim Suho asked.I slowly opened my mouth and spoke the real culprit\u2019s name.\u201cYun Hyun.\u201d\u2026Immediately, a deep silence descended in the room.No one seemed to react to my comment.\u201cPft.\u201dSoon, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s mocking laughter broke the silence, and Kim Suho gently rebutted.\u201cThat person has an alibi. We already looked into him because he was close to the first victim.\u201dIt was obvious that Yun Hyun had an alibi.\u201cBut what if the victim went to Yun Hyun on her own?\u201d\u201cA mental magic that could lure a cadet? Yeah, that makes sense.\u201dShin Jonghak rebutted sarcastically. The contempt and disdain he had in his eyes were as if he was staring at an insect.Just like Shin Jonghak said, it wasn\u2019t easy to lure a cadet with a mental magic. Even if it was possible, it couldn\u2019t have escaped people\u2019s suspicion. After all, people who were under the effect of mental magic moved like puppets or scarecrows.However\u2026\u201cIf it\u2019s mental magic, yeah. But\u2026\u201dIt was different if it was \u2018love\u2019. That was the biggest difference between enchantment and mental magic. Someone who was in love didn\u2019t know oneself was bewitched.\u201cScrew the useless talk.\u201dShin Jonghak cut me off before I could finish my sentence. He then kicked an empty chair, which rolled towards my leg.\u201cAs for me\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Yoo Yeonha made a dangerous smile. She slowly raised her hand and pointed at me.\u201cI\u2019m more suspicious of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dMy head drew a blank. Because it was so sudden, I was lost for words and froze.\u201cYoo Yeonha, that\u2019s not right either. Hajin also has an alibi.\u201dKim Suho quickly refuted the idea, but Yoo Yeonha easily rebutted him.\u201cHis alibi is a record of him using the Portal. If he is a Djinn, tampering with something like that should be easy. Compared to senior Yun Hyun who was with others, that person is much more\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we beat him up first?\u201dKim Horak hastily got up. With the way he cracked his knuckles and displayed his muscles, he practically looked like a miniature ogre.\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll sing or transform if he\u2019s beaten. Hey, get up.\u201dYoo Yeonha and Kim Horak. Shin Jonghak and Yi Yeonghan.Everyone other than Kim Suho looked at me with suspicious eyes.As the person in the middle of it all, I was furious. This had never happened to me before even in a mafia game. So this was what it felt like to be falsely accused.Should I not have brought up Yun Hyun\u2019s name?No, even if I didn\u2019t, this would have happened anyways. Yoo Yeonha must have planned to do so from the beginning.\u201cJonghak, I can break an arm or two, right?\u201dThe ogre asked for Shin Jonghak\u2019s consent. Before Shin Jonghak could give his answer, I jumped out of my chair.\u201cYeah come at me, you fat son of a bitch. I\u2019ll drill a hole in your head.\u201d\u201c\u2026What did you say? Look at this crazy motherfucker.\u201dKim Horak raised his voice. I took out my gun from my back pocket, but Kim Horak only snorted disdainfully.\u201cRetard, you think that can make me flinch?\u201dKim Horak positioned himself to charge forward. I also lowered my center of gravity. I had Aether. I could cook up some stupid pig whenever I wanted.\u201cStop.\u201dBut at that moment, Kim Suho stepped in between us. He even had his training sword out.\u201cNow\u2019s not the time for this. Hajin, you calm down too.\u201dI snapped back to reality, looking at the chilling flash on his sword blade.Though I shouted in a grand manner, Kim Horak was too strong of an opponent for my current self.\u2019Don\u2019t get angry. If you get angry, it\u2019s your loss.\u2019After telling myself that, I took in a deep breath and pointed at Yoo Yeonha.\u201cYou, if you\u2019re doubtful, ask Chae Nayun.\u201d\u201c\u2026What does Nayun have to do with this?\u201dI was talking to Yoo Yeonha, but it was Shin Jonghak who reacted sensitively.\u201cWhen she was attacked by a Djinn, I was there too. We killed him together. She didn\u2019t tell you yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI said so as I glared at Yoo Yeonha. She received my gaze in a perfectly calm manner without a single word.\u201cAnyways, I made myself clear. The culprit is that piece of shit Yun Hyun.\u201dAfter leaving those words to Yoo Yeonha, the \u2018final victim\u2019, I turned around.\u201cUk.\u201dIn the middle of walking out, I tripped accidentally. My body slipped to the side.But in the path I was walking, a fat boar suddenly flew in and smashed against the wall.The charge was too quick for a boar and too destructive for an attack on a fellow cadet, as a crack appeared on Cube\u2019s reinforced wall.\u201cOh? You dodged that?\u201dShin Jonghak\u2019s lips twisted up in interest. That just now was Kim Horak\u2019s tackle. If it hit, I didn\u2019t think it would have ended with just a couple broken bones.\u201cYou\u2026 son of a bitch.\u201dKim Horak stood up. For someone who attacked first, he sure was angry. I didn\u2019t have any other choice. I pointed my gun at him.\u201cI think I need to teach you a lesson.\u201dBut Kim Suho stopped us once again. This time, he did it with action rather than words. Magic power rose up from his sword and separated me from Kim Horak.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIf you\u2019re that suspicious, just ask Nayun! Yoo Yeonha!\u201dHe shouted at Yoo Yeonha.

Exam Period (2)Yoo Yeonha called Chae Nayun and asked if what Kim Hajin said was true. Chae Nayun carefully explained what happened the day before, and it was exactly as Kim Hajin said. In fact, Chae Nayun went so far as to make a definitive claim.\u201cThere\u2019s no way Kim Hajin is a Djinn\u201d, she said.The meeting was disbanded afterwards. Kim Hajin stomped out of the room, while Kim Suho and Yi Yeonghan chased after him.Once the short yet fierce disturbance passed by, room 303 became silent. The three remaining people didn\u2019t speak. In the midst of the silence, Yoo Yeonha saw Kim Horak massaging his right shoulder.\u201c\u2026Does it hurt?\u201d\u201cN-No, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cThat was your Gift, right?\u201dMany cadets already knew about Kim Horak\u2019s Gift. That was how straightforward it was.A simple and brute Gift that instantly amplified his body\u2019s explosive and destructive power. This easy-to-understand Gift was one of the strongest Gifts for martial arts.But Kim Hajin had dodged his attack easily. His movement wasn\u2019t flashy or nimble in any way. Almost as though he simply tripped, he had used a concise movement to dodge Kim Horak, whose Gift was specialized for martial arts.\u201c\u2026\u201dKim Horak dodged Yoo Yeonha\u2019s gaze. He wasn\u2019t feeling sorry about wrongfully accusing Kim Hajin. He was only embarrassed that his attack had been so easily dodged.\u201cEhew.\u201dYoo Yeonha sighed and glanced at Shin Jonghak. For a while, he was only staring at his smartwatch. Was he messaging Chae Nayun? That\u2019s what Yoo Yeonha worried about.\u201cJonghak, what are you up to?\u201dYoo Yeonha approached him with an affectionate smile. Shin Jonghak answered without bothering to give Yoo Yeonha a glance.\u201cI\u2019m looking to see if there\u2019s more of an item I bought.\u201d\u201cItem?\u201d\u201cYeah, I bought something.\u201d\u201cWhat did you buy~?\u201dYoo Yeonha pulled on Shin Jonghak\u2019s arm and acted cute in her own way.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dBut Shin Jonghak pushed her away. Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face froze at his cold action.\u201c\u2026Tsk. If we\u2019re done, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dShin Jonghak clicked his tongue and got up. In his mind, his action was justified. The website he was looking at was the famous Violet Banquet. However, Cube\u2019s cadets were prohibited from being a member of that website. It wasn\u2019t just Violet Banquet. Owning any black market ID was enough to get a cadet expelled.Even so, his indifferent attitude hurt Yoo Yeonha\u2019s feelings.\u201cKim Horak, aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah.\u201dKim Horak, who was peeking at Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face, followed Shin Jonghak like a puppy.Just like that, Yoo Yeonha became alone. She looked around the empty room. Suddenly, anger surged up from her heart. This wasn\u2019t the first time something like this had happened. Now, she was beginning to get upset.\u2018Shin Jonghak you bastard, just which part of Chae Nayun is better than me? Ehew. But what can I do, I just have to try harder.\u2019When Yoo Yeonha was about to chase after Shin Jonghak, her smartwatch vibrated.It was a message from Yun Hyun.\u2014There\u2019s going to be a preparatory exam next Monday. You\u2019re coming, right?Club activities stopped during exam periods, but the academics club offered peer tutoring during this time.Yoo Yeonha started typing, but she suddenly remembered what Kim Hajin said. That the culprit of this incident was Yun Hyun\u2026\u201cStupid.\u201dYoo Yeonha dismissed the idea once again and sent her reply.**9 P.M\u2026 I was sitting on a bench. I already chased away Kim Suho and Yi Yeonghan, who followed me to comfort me.In an empty park, I stared up at the night sky all alone. I released the bitterness in my heart.\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201dI reflected on what happened. Not only was I thrown into my own novel, I even got into an argument with characters I created with love. All sorts of feelings I had kept pent up in my heart exploded today.I wanted to stop. I wanted to go back to my old, one-room house. I wanted to see my parents. I avoided them, saying I was too busy, but now I was full of regrets.How was the time flowing in my old world? If it was the same as this place, I should be a missing person by now. I might even be considered dead by the time I go back. After all, I would have to spend close to 10 years in this world.At this point, I was glad I raised my perseverance stat. In this world, I had nothing. The memories I built up, the relationships, the feelings, none of them were here.My old self wouldn\u2019t have been able to endure it. Even if I didn\u2019t have the courage to commit suicide, I would have given up on the hope of returning home. I might have given up being part of the main storyline and gone on to live a normal life.\u201cAh, I want to see you, Mom.\u201dIt didn\u2019t feel right saying this as a 26-year-old man, but my voice trembled from the deep sincerity in my heart.I hoped she was healthy. I hoped she was getting along with Dad.If time was flowing normally in the other world, I hoped they would find out about me going missing as lately as possible. I didn\u2019t want to even imagine them being sad because of me.Once I began to think along this line, it just didn\u2019t seem to end.I remembered my friends. I cursed them from time to time for calling me when I was busy, but I missed them, especially today. Even the seniors from my college and the army, who liked to mess with me, popped up in my head.Both good and bad connections I\u2019ve made in my life lit up in my heart like stars.But the outside world was still dark, and not even a faint starlight existed in its sky.Dreaming of stars in a starless world only filled me with anguish.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dI wiped my reddened eyes and stood up. The handgun in my hand was still cold and heavy. The sensation was like a familiar scent.**My high perseverance stat indeed gave me an amazing recuperative power. A day was enough to mend my broken mentality, and after working out, hunting, and buying stocks, as usual, the weekend flew by in the blink of an eye.\u201cExams are next week, starting with the written exams. The combat exams will be on the following week. But remember what I\u2019ve always said, written exams are just as important as combat exams.\u201dToday was Monday. The professor purposely spoke in a grave tone. Just like he said, the midterm exams would begin in just a week.I was also a bit apprehensive.Of course, I had nothing to worry about in written exams, but the problem was with combat exams.In duels, cadets fought each other in a one on one battle. In monster wars, cadets fought illusionary monsters summoned by magicians rather than mana puppets.Cadets didn\u2019t show mercy in duels to maximize the points they gained, and summoned monsters in monster wars were on a completely different league than mana puppets. In a way, they were no different than \u2018real\u2019 monsters.So I had to prepare myself for the pain of getting my flesh cut or my bones broken.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut setting the exam-worry aside, I couldn\u2019t focus on today\u2019s class because of someone sitting next to me.Rachel.She always sat by herself in the back of the class, but ever since the results came out for the Phenomenon Realm Analysis exam, she has been getting close to me seat by seat, and now she was sitting next to me.To be exact, she was still a seat away since there was still an empty seat between us. In any case, Rachel kept sneaking a glance at my notebook. She wasn\u2019t just stealing a look, but she also seemed to be writing something down.Just to be sure, I wrote down a random string of words.[Yoo Kim Ok Jun Ja Hyuk]Yoo Okja. Kim Junhyuk. It was my mother\u2019s and father\u2019s name. I rolled my eyes to the side and observed Rachel.As expected, she snuck a glance before quickly jotting something down on her notebook. With my eyes, I could clearly see the words \u201cYoo Kim Ok Jun Ha Hyuk????\u201dNext, I scribbled down a string of numbers next to my parents\u2019 names.[19680529.19660912]It was my father\u2019s and mother\u2019s birthday. Rachel also jotted down the numbers.Next, I scribbled down the name of the dog I used to have, then \u2018iputsmid\u2019 which was an anagram of \u201cI\u2019m stupid\u201d\u2026The class then ended while I was still messing around with Rachel.\u201cGood luck on your exams next week. The results will be posted for everyone to see, so don\u2019t embarrass yourselves.\u201dThe professor left after reminding the cadets. Immediately afterwards, Chae Nayun\u2019s seat became noisy.Chae Nayun had returned from the hospital today. It seemed she still had trouble moving, as she had all sorts of supporting equipment with her. Just like in the original story, Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak ran up to her.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys. I can move just fine by myself.\u201dThey backed off slightly at Chae Nayun\u2019s complaint but still remained hovering around her.\u201cKim Suho, you should leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see Nayun is uncomfortable having you around?\u201dShin Jonghak was provoking Kim Suho as usual, and one girl watched them from the side with somewhat lonely eyes. She smiled, acting as though she was fine, but I knew she was feeling alienated. Obviously, it was Yoo Yeonha.Yoo Yeonha approached Chae Nayun and the others and spoke.\u201cJonghak, Nayun, I\u2019m going first.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHm? Oh, bye Yeonha. Good luck studying.\u201dShin Jonghak and Chae Nayun\u2019s greeting was just for courtesy. Yoo Yeonha left the classroom biting her lips. I stuffed my laptop and writing utensils in my bag and walked out the back door.Immediately, I ran into Yoo Yeonha. She should have gone left to go to the dorm, but for some reason, she chose the opposite direction.\u201c\u2026\u201dWe looked at each other awkwardly.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked.\u201c\u2026To the dorm.\u201dLike I said before, this wasn\u2019t the way to the dorm.But I didn\u2019t want to continue talking to her.\u201cI see.\u201dYoo Yeonha didn\u2019t say anything more either.She simply made a small bow and walked past me.**Yoo Yeonha opened the clubroom door. The clubroom looked no different than usual, but the empty room gave off a slight chill. The only person inside was Yun Hyun, who was reading on the teaching platform.Yoo Yeonha tilted her head. Where was everyone else?At that moment, Yun Hyun noticed Yoo Yeonha and walked over.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cCome take a seat.\u201dYoo Yeonha sat down for now. Not having anyone else around made her feel a bit uneasy, but she soon calmed down. It was likely thanks to Yun Hyun. For some reason, the scent Yun Hyun gave off was calming and cozy, so Yoo Yeonha could always relax in front of him.\u201cWhere did everyone go?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re coming soon. Oh right, Yeonha, I heard you joined the team.\u201d\u201cTeam?\u201d\u201cYou know, the Djinn investigation team. I\u2019m in it too as the second year representative.\u201dYun Hyun\u2019s voice was clear and firm. At least, that\u2019s how Yoo Yeonha felt.\u201cOh really?\u201dAs expected, Kim Hajin\u2019s suspicion was a complete nonsense.\u201cBut we haven\u2019t made any progress. Do you guys have any lead? Any suspects?\u201d\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d\u201cReally? So you guys haven\u2019t made any progress either?\u201dYun Hyun asked softly. Yoo Yeonha pondered for a moment at his courteous manner of speech. Progress. There wasn\u2019t any. The meeting was disbanded before anything happened.\u201cMm\u2026 One person did say something, but it was stupid.\u201d\u201cStupid? I\u2019m curious what it was now.\u201dYun Hyun leaned against the desk Yoo Yeonha was sitting on and placed down a scented candle.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cA scented candle. It\u2019ll help when we\u2019re studying later. Anyways, what did this person say?\u201dYun Hyun asked with a kind smile on his face. Yoo Yeonha smelled the scented candle. It was aromatic and gentle. Her body relaxed, and the day\u2019s exhaustion seemed to wear away.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really.\u201dYoo Yeonha smirked.\u201cSome guy was saying you were a Djinn. That you could use some sort of mental magic. Absurd, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAfter answering, Yoo Yeonha sniffed the scented candle once more. The wonderful fragrance was almost addicting. Because she was focused on the scented candle, she didn\u2019t see Yun Hyun\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026Does he have proof?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026?\u201dAt that moment, Yoo Yeonha suddenly snapped out of her daze. Tension welled up in her body once more. She turned her head towards Yun Hyun and glared at him.When being suspected, most innocent people wouldn\u2019t ask if there was evidence. At least, not as the first question.After all, there couldn\u2019t possibly be any evidence against someone who didn\u2019t commit a crime.\u201cOh, oops, I misspoke. What a funny kid. On what ground is he calling me a Djinn?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun Hyun realized his mistake and quickly corrected himself. But it was too late. Yoo Yeonha backed off, taking out her whip from her back pocket and pointing it at Yun Hyun.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong, Yeonha?\u201dYun Hyun smiled.The gentle arc his eyes and lips quickly twisted viciously.\u201cIt\u2019s not your turn yet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Exam Period (3)With exams starting next week, the Fitness Center was filled with cadets.Haaap\u2014! Yaaaap\u2014! The spirited shouts coming from the sparring rooms pierced through the walls, while clashing of magic power created sharp sonic booms.In the physical training room, cadets could be seen lifting 120kg dumbbells effortlessly.I was also working out among such monsters. What I could do was pitiful compared to other cadets, but I was pouring out sweat and effort in my own way.Wiiing\u2014\u201cUuk.\u201dUsing my smartwatch\u2019s vibration as an excuse, I put down the bar I was lifting. Dizziness immediately came over me. It seemed 130kg bench press was still too much.I wiped my sweat off with a towel hanging around my neck and checked my smartwatch.[The documents are ready\u2026 But are you really going to invest so much money in us?]It was a message from Park Soohyuk.Of the 500 million I earned from selling the ginseng, I bought stocks with 250 million and invested the rest into SH Agency. I knew SH Agency would become just as successful as Packhorse Master.[Of course. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.][Um\u2026 Why us?]It seemed Park Soohyuk was quite confused, but I couldn\u2019t blame him. The current SH Agency was a tiny nameless company that had yet to accomplish anything.[It\u2019s fun, growing bigger together. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019ll be nice to see each other grow?]I wasn\u2019t investing in a company, but a person. That was how exceptional Park Soohyuk was. He was a future tycoon, jumping into this business without any connection and managing to achieve the world\u2019s most brilliant enterprise.[Ah\u2026 Yes\u2026 Then I\u2019ll see you tomorrow with all the documents and contracts. Thank you once again.][No problem. See you then.]After ending my conversation with Park Soohyuk, I lied down on the bench press once again. But immediately after I put my hands on the bar, my wrist vibrated once again.Who was it now? When I looked at my smartwatch, I couldn\u2019t help but furrow my brows.It was Yoo Yeonha.[9]I couldn\u2019t understand why she would suddenly message me, but the content of the message was even more mysterious. It was a single number. Did she press the wrong button?\u201cWhat\u2019s up with her?\u201dSince she didn\u2019t say anything else, I ignored it and put my hands back on the bar. Putting strength into my entire body, I lifted it up with regular breathing.One, two, three, four\u2026 nine.Nine. 9.Suddenly, I thought of something.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t tell me, is this a rescue signal?\u201d**Yoo Yeonha was currently detained in the penthouse room of Cube\u2019s second year dorm.No matter how much of an elite Yoo Yeonha was, she couldn\u2019t do anything against a Djinn who was loved by Lilith. Yun Hyun easily subdued Yoo Yeonha before storing her in an extradimensional pocket and moving her here.He couldn\u2019t show the meticulousness he usually did in hiding his tracks and Yoo Yeonha\u2019s struggle was surely caught on CCTV, but since he planned to leave Cube once this matter was finished, he didn\u2019t care.\u201cOh, this is him? The quick-witted one who said I was a Djinn?\u201dYun Hyun looked at Yoo Yeonha\u2019s smartwatch he just snatched and grinned. The message Yoo Yeonha sent Kim Hajin was displayed on the smartwatch screen.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ll need to kill him later\u2026 Anyways, what\u2019s this? 9? That\u2019s all you sent to ask for help? Who would understand something so cryptic?\u201dYun Hyun dropped the smartwatch and stomped on it. Cube\u2019s proud smartwatch was shattered easily.\u201cOf course, even if he understood what you meant, he wouldn\u2019t be able to come in here. There\u2019s a barrier around this place, you see.\u201dYoo Yeonha fiercely glared at Yun Hyun while clenching her teeth. Seeing Yoo Yeonha\u2019s glare, Yun Hyun trembled in ecstasy.\u201cAh, amazing. Those eyes are amazing. It\u2019s okay, Yeonha. Soon, you\u2019ll come to like me too.\u201dTap, tap.\u00a0Yun Hyun slowly approached Yoo Yeonha, who was tied to a chair. She struggled fiercely, but the restraint spell prevented her from moving.\u201cYou have beautiful skin.\u201dYun Hyun put his hands on Yoo Yeonha\u2019s thigh. A faint handprint was left behind on her white skin. At the disgusting sensation akin to a snake licking her, Yoo Yeonha teared up.\u201cOnce is enough. You won\u2019t be able to escape afterward. Lilith-nim allowed it for today too. That\u2019s right, Lilith-nim wants you too.\u201dYun Hyun spoke leisurely. The Devil of Enchantment bewitched people on a fundamental level. Once Yun Hyun had his way, Yoo Yeonha would become a completely different person.\u201cYeonha, weren\u2019t you lonely? I know that feeling too.\u201dSpeaking persuasively, Yun Hyun placed his hand on Yoo Yeonha\u2019s neck. A mind-muddling magic power was imbued in his breath. Yoo Yeonha trembled. No matter how powerful her mental power was, ecstasy forced by magic power wasn\u2019t something she could resist. If she could, she would not have hesitated to bite her own tongue to end her own life.\u201cIt\u2019s easier if you give up.\u201dYun Hyun caressed Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face and whispered softly. A magic power of passion flowed into Yoo Yeonha from his hand. The magic power stimulated many parts of her body and urged her to submit. An intense pleasure akin to euphoria overwhelmed her.In the end, she let out a small aroused moan.CLANG!But at that moment, a flash of light erupted from the window and a translucent beam of light pierced Yun Hyun.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dYun Hyun was dazed by the unexpected attack as he fell on his knee. While he was struggling to comprehend what just happened, an unidentifiable voice rang out from the room.\u2014Serves you right for not listening to me and suspecting me.\u201c\u2026!\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s eyes shot open at the familiar voice. Yun Hyun used this chance to imbue magic power into his injured leg, but the special regenerative power of Djinns didn\u2019t activate and only the pain increased.\u2014Don\u2019t think about recovering from that wound. I refined that bullet to be a bit more efficient. Unless you undergo a surgery to take it out\u2026\u201cShut it!\u201dYun Hyun shot up with a roar. Red magic power erupted from his body. His eyes, which had turned bloodshot, glanced around the empty room in vain.\u201cWhere are you! Show yourself!\u201dYun Hyun swung his magic power around desperately. The storm of magic power swept through his surroundings, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.\u2014You can try all you want, but you won\u2019t be able to reach me. I\u2019m far, far away, you see.\u201cYou little rat\u2014!\u201dAs if to respond to Yun Hyun\u2019s curse, a single bullet shot through the window and pierced Yun Hyun\u2019s shoulder. Yun Hyun felt rage before pain.\u201cYou, You\u2014!\u201dYun Hyun swung his arms frantically.\u201cShow yourself\u2014! Show yourself, you son of a bitch\u2014!\u201dHis frenzied cry muddled his speech, and it became harder and harder to tell whether a human was talking or an animal was crying.Then, a few more bullets flew in through the window. Yun Hyun erupted in a furious rage. Now, he was no different than a beast.Yoo Yeonha watched this overwhelming scene in a daze. Setting aside where the bullets were coming from, just how could mere bullets injure a Djinn to this degree? She grew deeply curious at this unprecedented power.\u2014So this is why people enjoy sniping.With a mocking taunt, another bullet flew in. This time, the bullet hit Yun Hyun\u2019s chest. He collapsed from the shock, then began to crawl pitifully using his hands. Immediately, bullets pierced his knees and shoulders. It was a critical blow preventing him from further movement.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe bullets had all come from the window. Yun Hyun thought that he just had to hide from sight.But the cold-hearted sharpshooter didn\u2019t allow any mercy. Another white shooting star flew in through the window and pierced his back. Yun Hyun\u2019s hands trembled, while his bloodshot eyes widened.\u2014So durable\u2026 Oy, Yoo Yeonha, I\u2019m about to use up all of the bullets you gave me. If you have a conscience, provide me with better ones.Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t laugh at the man\u2019s joking words.Yun Hyun was in a pitiful state, while a man was protecting her from a faraway place. Realizing that she would survive, she relaxed. When the tension in her body disappeared, drowsiness overwhelmed her.\u2014If you\u2019re tired, just sleep. Kim Suho should be arriving soon.Before she fell asleep like the man said, Yoo Yeonha asked the one question she had.\u201cBy the way\u2026 Where are you talking from?\u201d\u2014Above you. The ceiling\u2019s speaker, I hacked into it.\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dI see\u2026Yoo Yeonha chuckled and closed her eyes.**At first, I thoughtlessly asked the Book of Truth whether Yun Hyun had kidnapped Yoo Yeonha.The Book of Truth answered \u2018yes\u2019, and I shot up in surprise. Not only was the schedule moved up, I was also notified of a settings change.Because my novel was for an audience of all ages, I made Yun Hyun impotent, but an absurd setting had been added to his genitals\u2026I immediately alerted Kim Suho, but since every second was vital, I set out myself.I ran to a mountaintop that had a clear view of the second year cadets\u2019 dorm. I only needed five minutes to climb the mountain thanks to my increased vitality and stamina. As a result, I could save Yoo Yeonha before it was too late.\u201cThank god I chose to come.\u201dJust now, Kim Suho barged into Yun Hyun\u2019s penthouse after breaking the barrier. Yun Hyun resisted with what little strength he had left, but Kim Suho cut him down with a single slash.\u201c\u2026But this, it\u2019s better than I expected.\u201dI stared at the giant anti-material sniper rifle in my hand in admiration.With a length of 1.5 meters, it flaunted a domineering and beautiful appearance. The gun barrel, designed to amplify the gun\u2019s firepower, looked extremely vicious, but its platinum color and the golden patterns surrounding it gave it a noble elegance.This sniper rifle was the result of Aether and Desert Eagle\u2019s fusion. I had created it just now using SP.[Sniper rifle mode \u2013 transforms into a high-powered sniper rifle when fused with Aether.]Even after adding the restriction that Aether had to be used, the modification cost 250 SP.Using this anti-material sniper rifle, I sniped down a target 1.5km away. I saw the enemy from a distance I couldn\u2019t be seen, and sniped an enemy from a distance I couldn\u2019t be attacked.It was quite exhilarating.\u201cI\u2019m sure Kim Suho will take care of the rest.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI canceled the fusion between Aether and Desert Eagle. The 1.5m long sniper rifle returned to its normal handgun form.[You obtained 457 SP!][An incredible luck applies. You obtained an additional 11% as a bonus!][You succeeded in a long range snipe. Proficiency of Master Sharpshooter increases to grade 7.]I gained a lot of SP in a single day. It was to be expected since I completed a major arc.I sat down on the ground and watched what was happening far away. Kim Suho was putting Yoo Yeonha on his back, while Cube\u2019s Heroes were rushing into the dorm.With this, the number of victims had decreased. Though faint, a point of contact was also created between Yoo Yeonha and Kim Suho. Since Kim Suho was a kind main character, I was sure he would treat Yoo Yeonha well.Though things had become a bit messy, overall, I was satisfied with the outcome.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Exam Period (4)Yoo Yeonha opened her eyes. A patternless white ceiling filled her sight, and the sound of something being cut tickled her ears. She turned towards the direction of the sound.Kim Suho was cutting an apple with a fruit knife.\u201c\u2026What are you doing here?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked dumbfoundedly. Kim Suho glanced at Yoo Yeonha before smiling bashfully.\u201cYou\u2019re awake? It doesn\u2019t hurt anywhere, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cThe doctor said there\u2019s nothing wrong with your body.\u201dYoo Yeonha raised her upper body. She felt slightly stiff and sore, but it wasn\u2019t to the point she couldn\u2019t move.\u201cWhat I want to know is why you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re taking turns nursing you. Me, Nayun, Shin Jonghak, and Kim Horak.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked genuinely curious.\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of our fault\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dYoo Yeonha fell in thought because of Kim Suho\u2019s incomprehensible words. How was it their fault?But even after contemplating about what happened, she couldn\u2019t come up with an answer.\u2018Did they do something I didn\u2019t know?\u2019 Yoo Yeonha glared at Kim Suho, demanding an explanation.\u201cAs members of the same team, we should have been more careful. We were too absorbed in caring for Nayun that we were too negligent\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha became lost for words. Her brain seemed to freeze at the sheer stupidity of Kim Suho\u2019s statement.It wasn\u2019t like they could have known she would get attacked. Not to mention, the investigation team had only met twice, and there was even a huge argument in the second meeting.\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201dYoo Yeonha chuckled at Kim Suho\u2019s bashful apology. If anything, she realized just how stupidly kind this man was.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry. I got what I deserved.\u201dKim Suho scratched his neck and gave Yoo Yeonha a plate of sliced apples, which were shaped like rabbits. Yoo Yeonha smiled subconsciously. Being a girl, Yoo Yeonha liked cute things.\u201cThey look nice.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dKim Suho laughed innocently. His handsome face seemed to shine. Yoo Yeonha stared at his face in a daze before suddenly remembering something and asking.\u201c\u2026Oh right, um, did that person come?\u201d\u201cThat person?\u201dKim Hajin.Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t say his name out loud. She had a conscience. She didn\u2019t expect him to visit her after what she had done.\u201cNo, nevermind.\u201dShe looked outside the window. There wasn\u2019t a single cluster of clouds on the East Sea\u2019s clear and blue sky. The world seemed particularly bright under the beaming sunlight.Seeing this dazzling scenery, Yoo Yeonha fell in thought.She learned many things today.Of course, her 17-year-old personality wouldn\u2019t entirely change with just this one incident. Tomorrow\u2019s Yoo Yeonha might not be too different than today\u2019s.But there were certainly many things she felt from the bottom of her heart. She wasn\u2019t sure whether it was self-reflection, introspection, or plain gratefulness.Before she wrote everything down on her diary and pondered over it, she first picked up her smartwatch.There was still something she needed to do.**I received a message.[Thank you. I\u2019ll repay today\u2019s debts for sure.]The sender was Yoo Yeonha. Seeing her name, the corners of my mouth curled up to a smile.I wanted to say something cool, but the person sitting in front of me asked for another affirmation.\u201cUm\u2026 So I can just take this money? Really?\u201dI stared back at the man. Park Soohyuk has been like this for a while. I lost count how many times he asked if this was real.Haa. I couldn\u2019t help but sigh.It was my money I was investing, so why was he so hesitant? Just buy an HUV (hunter utility vehicle) and a proper magic pouch already!\u201cYes, yes, yes. Please take it! Please!\u201dI stood up and bowed down at a 90-degree angle.\u201cPlease take it!\u201d\u201cAh, um, I\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat, do I need to kowtow? I\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u201cNo, no! I\u2019ll take it! Thank you so much for investing in SH Agency!\u201dHe finally put the signed documents in his suitcase.How did such an easygoing person end up becoming the agent world\u2019s greatest giant? I was the owner who created this setting, but I just couldn\u2019t understand it.After staring at him for a moment, I asked casually.\u201cBy the way, how old are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m 29.\u201d\u201cAh, you\u2019re more than a decade older than me. You don\u2019t have to talk so formally.\u201dTalking casually would be better for our relationship.\u201cHow can I do such a thing to an investor\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think of me as an investor, think of me as a business partner. You know, like we\u2019re building SH Agency together.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dA back and forth argument went around on the topic of talking formally or casually. Eventually, I defeated Park Soohyuk and he submitted.\u201cOkay\u2026 I won\u2019t talk so formally then.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dI got up.\u201cThen let\u2019s go hunt. We\u2019ll stop at just two for today.\u201d\u201cAlright, then this hyung[1]\u00a0will support you from the back.\u201dPark Soohyuk laughed bashfully.We left the coffee shop. Right when we were about to head to the Field, I saw a convenience store.\u201cUm, Soohyuk hyung?\u201dI was the one who suggested talking casually, but I felt shy now that I needed to do it.\u201cHm? What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWe should buy a lottery ticket.\u201dI pointed at the poster that said [lottery ticket on sale]. In truth, this was the first method I thought up to make money since I had an absurd level of luck. But because of my status as a \u2018minor without a guardian\u2019, I haven\u2019t been able to do it until now.\u201cCome on, lottery tickets are a waste of money. You might be too young to understand these things, but the lottery is a scam.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a scam. I have good luck, so I\u2019ll probably win something. I\u2019ll invest what I get on SH Agency, so give it a try.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s a scam\u2026\u201d\u201cJust follow me.\u201dI dragged Park Soohyuk to the convenience store. I grabbed ten instant lottery tickets on the counter, and with Park Soohyuk\u2019s clearly aged face, the clerk didn\u2019t even ask for his identification. After buying the ten tickets, I brought them over to a nearby table.\u201cI need something to scratch them with.\u201d\u201cOh, here\u2019s a coin.\u201dEven though he just said lottery tickets were a scam, he gave me a coin with anticipating eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll start then.\u201dShashak. I started scratching on the silver foils on the ticket. The first one was a fail. I immediately moved on to the second. Another fail. I scratched the third ticket. Another fail.\u201cHaam.\u201dPark Soohyuk had already lost interest and yawned. Unperturbed, I continued scratching. Fourth, fifth, sixth\u2026While Park Soohyuk walked around the cup ramen aisle, I scratched the tenth lottery ticket.\u201cOh, finally.\u201d\u201cYou won? How much?\u201dPark Soohyuk asked casually after picking up a cup ramen.\u201c20 million won.\u201d\u201cOh, nice.\u201dPark Soohyuk then started walking towards the counter before suddenly stopping and tilting his head. \u2018Did I hear that wrong\u2026?\u2019 murmuring so, he turned towards me.\u201c\u2026Can you repeat that?\u201d\u201c20 million won. Looks like getting the first place jackpot is asking for too much.\u201dFirst place was 100 million won.I showed Park Soohyuk the lottery ticket. His jaws instantly dropped.\u201cW-What, is, is this real?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s real, so take it.\u201dI handed him the ticket.\u201cW-Why are you giving this to me?\u201d\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I\u2019m still a minor, so I can\u2019t claim the money. You can take it. It\u2019s an additional investment, so send me a modified contract.\u201dPark Soohyuk stared at me in a daze. His gaping mouth didn\u2019t think to close. The cup ramen he was holding could probably fit in his mouth. It sure was big.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah.\u201dPark Soohyuk quickly put the lottery ticket in his pocket. Next, he quickly looked around himself and began to sweat as though he had just committed a crime.\u201cYou can put down your guard. No one is going to steal it. \u201c\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand how scary the world can be\u2026\u201d**Moonlight shone through a broken window, but it only lit up dusty ruins and absolute silence. Vines and moss were the only living things in this desolate place abandoned by humans.A factory in Suwon abandoned after Outcall, this was Chameleon Troupe\u2019s temporary hiding place.\u2014Boss.A voice rang out in the empty space. The call awoke an existence sleeping in the darkness.\u2014You\u2019re awake?The existence slowly opened its eyes. The revealed pupils glistened like jewels yet carried a threatening aura.\u2014Those bastards started moving. The Packhorse Master. They just listed themselves on the stock market.The ownerless voice notified the existence of this information.The existence replied briefly. Not even a hint of emotion could be felt in the dull voice.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u2014What should we do next?The existence put off answering the question and slowly raised its body. Meanwhile, a full moon revealed itself from behind the clouds. A brighter moonlight infiltrated the window and lit up the existence\u2019s body. The enshrouding darkness instantly melted down.\u2014That aside, Boss is beautiful as always.Long black hair seemingly weaved out of shadows, full pink lips, and a smooth white skin adorning a graceful figure\u2026 A woman, who seemed to be the manifestation of modern beauty, spoke without the slightest change in her expression.\u201cDo you have a death wish?\u201dA dark blue magic power crackled from her hands.\u2014I\u2019m kidding, but it\u2019s not like I can say Boss is ugly. Forgive me.The threatening magic power akin to an erupting lava calmed down.\u2014Anyways, what are we going to do? The Packhorse Master is making its move.\u201cWe will only steal. We won\u2019t care about anything else.\u201dIt was an apathetic answer, but her command was clear.\u2014Oh, by the way, there\u2019s someone buying Packhorse Master\u2019s stocks en masse.\u201cStocks?\u201d\u2014Yep. At first, I thought it was just a small investor, investing 3 million won first and 10 million won second. But suddenly, he threw in 250 million won on top of that. A small investor randomly investing wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201cCoincidence?\u201d\u2014Mm\u2026 95%, I\u2019d say. But Boss, the other 5% is what I\u2019m concerned with. There\u2019s no reason to buy this stock. Packhorse Master doesn\u2019t even have a guild page yet.The guild stock market was riskier than the normal stock market. Thus, without a proper source of information, few small investors invested in new guilds. And there was no way that there was a source of information on Packhorse Master.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. We only have one job.\u201d\u2014Mmm\u2026 If you say so. I\u2019ll tell the troupe members that.\u201cUn.\u201dWith that, the voice disappeared. Then, it quickly came back.\u2014Oh right, a few interesting pages appeared on Violet Banquet.The woman tilted her head.\u2014Artifact Search Corp, Jonggak\u2019s Dog Meat Soup, and Truth Agency.\u201cAre they of any use?\u201d\u2014The first two are slowly building their reputation, but I don\u2019t know about Truth Agency. I just included it because of how confident it introduced itself. Since it\u2019s boasting in Violet Banquet, I\u2019m sure it has some skill.\u201cTake it out.\u201d\u2014Come on~ You know how things are. It wasn\u2019t just once or twice that seemingly ordinary pages were the jackpot. I\u2019ll give you the page number later, so take a look. It says it\u2019ll answer any question. Who knows? Maybe it can help us find that son of a bitch.However, the woman remained uninterested.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen often.\u201d\u2014Still. Alright, I\u2019m going. See you later, Boss~That seemed to be the end of the conversation.But the voice came back once again.\u2014Oh, one more thing, Boss.\u201c\u2026\u201dVeins popped up on the woman\u2019s white forehead.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat now?\u201d\u2014Cube\u2019s exams start next week. You\u2019ll go watch, right?Huu.The woman sighed before replying.\u201cYeah, I will.\u201d1.

Intruders (1)Thursday. The sound of scribbling pencils rang out in the classroom. Almost all cadets were hard at work to prepare for the exam four days later.\u201cArgh\u2026 I want to go play soccer or something.\u201dOf course, there was bound to be at least one cadet who hated studying. Chae Nayun expressed her boredom with her entire body.\u201cMy body\u2019s healed but I can\u2019t move my body\u2026\u201dThis week\u2019s incident was reported across the entire world, and combat training was canceled due to Cube\u2019s executives all being under investigation. As a result, there were only review and theory classes until the exams.To Chae Nayun, it must be like hell.\u201cExams are next week. Study hard, or you\u2019re going to have regrets when the results come out.\u201dNext to her, Kim Suho spoke with a laugh. Being a diligent protagonist, Kim Suho was also good at written exams. But since he wasn\u2019t good enough to contend for top ranks, he asked Yoo Yeonha who sat in front of him if he ever had any questions. Just like he was doing now.\u201cUm, Yeonha, can you tell me how to solve this?\u201dYoo Yeonha glanced at the problem Kim Suho showed her.\u201c\u2026Can you not forget my last name?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah, sorry.\u201dI yawned as I watched them interact.At that moment, someone poked my shoulder. It was Rachel. When I tilted my head, she handed me a piece of paper.Just like yesterday, it was another high difficulty problem.Rachel has started to ask me for help on problems like these. In reality, I haven\u2019t even heard her voice.[Suppose the boss monster of a Dungeon is a high-intermediate rank grade 3 demi-devil. The Dungeon is a Stage Dungeon, and each stage consists of a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 30 low rank to intermediate rank monsters. Assuming the size of this Dungeon is medium small, find the minimum and maximum mana density, and approximate the number of people needed to conquer the Dungeon.]I had no clue where to start. Was this really going to be on the exam? I glanced at Rachel. She was tapping on the desk while staring at me.I should probably answer the question.I activated my Gift. With several abilities I added to Observation and Reading, it should be able to solve this problem as long as it followed the world design I created.[A high-intermediate rank grade 3 demi-devil has a minimum magic power capacity of\u2026 medium small Stages have four to six floors\u2026 878ppm~1133ppm. Nine people can use and recharge magic power without being overburdened.]I wrote down the sentences that popped up in front of me on a piece of paper and gave it to Rachel. Immediately, her eyes widened. She buried her face on the paper and began to carefully scrutinize every step of the calculation.Ding dong\u2014At that moment, the bell rang signaling the end of the class. The class was technically a review class, but in reality, it was just a self-study class. In any case, few cadets got up from their seats. They were all studying hard.I, of course, planned on going back to the dorm. That\u2019s just what smart students did.When I began to stuff my writing utensils in my bag along with my laptop, a shadow was cast over my desk. I raised my head with a quizzical look. It was Chae Nayun.\u201cHey, help me study.\u201dShe spoke with a sweet smile.I got up from my seat.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too troublesome.\u201dWritten exams began next Monday. That was less than four days. Even if she started studying now, her grades wouldn\u2019t change much. Not to mention, I had no way of helping her study.\u201cH-Hey! Um, please! How about a study guide on Phenomenon Realm Analysis?\u201dShe sounded more desperate than I imagined, but I still went on my way cold-heartedly.**The written exams went by like a breeze. From the first exam on Monday to the final exam on Friday, time seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.I felt like I got everything correct. At first, I thought about aiming for an average score, but because I might end up scoring near the bottom on the combat exams, I did my best on the written exams so that I wouldn\u2019t be held back.Today was Saturday.Combat exams would begin on Monday. During combat exam periods, Cube was open to cadets\u2019 family members, various Hero associates, and all institutions that hired Heroes. Naturally, Cube was bustling with people.\u201cOh~ Cube\u2019s rank 117, Kim Junha! I saw you on YouTube. My son is your fan. Can we take a photo?\u201dBecause cadets\u2019 families were present, the combat exam period was somewhat of a festival. It was a bit odd that teenagers fighting each other was considered a festival, but this was Cube\u2019s tradition.\u201cWe are in Cube, the world\u2019s best Hero Academy\u2026\u201dReporters were also allowed in from approved broadcasting companies. Since becoming a Hero was akin to becoming a celebrity, the goal was to let cadets become used to being on camera.\u201cThere sure is a lot of people.\u201dI was currently sitting in Hero Park, located in the center of Cube. Unlike how it was normally, the place was booming with people as though it was Disneyland.\u201cAh! Hajin-ssi!\u201dAt that moment, someone called my name.Tap tap. I turned towards the direction of the footsteps.It was Hazuki.\u201cHajin-ssi, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Just taking a break. Who are the two behind you?\u201d\u201cMy parents. This is my mom and this is my dad. Mom, Dad, this is my teammate.\u201d\u201cH-Hello.\u201dI shook hands with Hazuki\u2019s parents. They smiled and said something in Japanese. Since I couldn\u2019t understand them, I just feigned a smile.\u201cHajin. His name is Kim Hajin.\u201dHazuki introduced me to her parents. It seemed they were asking for my name. After Hazuki told them my name, they grabbed my hands, saying \u201cHajin-san, Hajin-san\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what they were saying so I just replied with \u201chai, hai\u201d.In any case, after the greeting ended, Hazuki left with her parents.Alone once again, I sat down on the bench. I couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous of Hazuki, whose parents had come to see him.\u2018Huu. If only Mom and Dad were in this world too\u2026\u2019Just when I was having wishful thoughts\u2026 a certain person caught my eyes.A woman was slowly walking through the crowded park.Her long hair was black like shadows, her eyes looked like obsidian, and she seemed a bit drowsy.She held a certain melancholic charm that seemed to turn her surroundings dark.I felt like I knew her.She was exactly as I described her in my novel.One of the few wanted criminals on Hero Association\u2019s blacklist, the leader of the criminal group Chameleon Troupe, and the person who inherited the title of Yasha of the Eight Legions.As she disguised herself with countless number of identities, I was the only one who knew her real name.At that moment, she suddenly came to a stop. She slowly turned her head, meeting my eyes. I had to look away, but my body immediately froze.Her deep eyes seemed to strangle me. Just by looking into her eyes, I became stifled for breath and broke out in a cold sweat.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen my mind was about to turn blank, she turned back. Clack, clack. The sound of her high-heels rang out as she walked away.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201dI collected my breath. It felt like I was under an immense pressure.But at that moment, I felt a gaze on me. I slowly raised my head.She had her back towards me, but I could feel a gaze from her back.I was certain.That woman was observing me.My instincts were roaring. I had to say something, something that could explain why I was staring at her\u2026.With a gulp, I muttered.\u201cWow, she\u2019s so hot.\u201dInstantly, she slightly twisted her head towards me.But soon, she continued walking.\u201cWhew.\u201dI let out a sigh of relief. I beat my stifled chest and put my hands over my heated face.I almost forgot.The Chameleon Troupe would sneak into Cube for combat exams. Their goal was to scout. They wanted to see if anyone was worthy of filling in an empty position in their group.In the original story, Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak were the main candidates. Kim Suho would be disqualified because of the differences in their beliefs, and they would return peacefully with Shin Jonghak in their mind. In other words, they weren\u2019t here to cause any trouble.However\u2026\u201cI\u2019m looking around constantly, but everything\u2019s normal.\u201dCube was currently filled with Heroes dispatched by the Association.One particularly notable character was the world rank 1737, high rank grade 6 Hero, Oh Junhyuk.\u201cThere\u2019s no one out of the ordinary. Let\u2019s just go grab lunch.\u201d\u201cJust focus.\u201dThere was also rank 2000, high-rank grade 7 Hero, Seo Youngji.Several Heroes were on the lookout in disguise.Because the incident with Yun Hyun happened before the combat exams, the Hero Association had dispatched numerous Heroes to investigate.\u201cLet\u2019s eat pizza.\u201d\u201cShut it. Just keep your eyes out for anyone suspicious or with a strange aura.\u201dIf the Chameleon Troupe were to clash with them\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t end with just one or two dead people.**Clack, clack.A woman stopped in an artificial forest. After confirming that no one was watching her, she quietly murmured.\u201cSomeone saw me.\u201dThe forest was empty without even a shadow of a person. However, a strange voice rang out from the ground.\u2014Really? Maybe you were mistaken.\u201cNo, he said I was hot.\u201d\u2014\u2026Pfft. Well, did you like it, Boss?\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d\u2014Check again. Maybe the necklace isn\u2019t working.A full body mirror shot up from the ground.

So someone saw through the necklace? He must have good perception. I\u2019ll keep an eye out. Do you remember his name and face?\u201c\u2026Stop joking around. You saw him too.\u201d\u2014Huhu, I know, I know. I\u2019m already looking into it. Wait just a bit.Tadak, tadak.

Intruders (2)\u2014There\u2019s nothing special about him.The voice answered after ten minutes of waiting. The woman smacked her lips. It was her habit that came out when she was dissatisfied.\u2014Really. He\u2019s an orphan without parents or relatives. The orphanage he was in held an examination for potential Heroes and he was admitted to the Agent Military Academy at the age of 6. He never stood out, maintaining a below-average rank before entering Cube. He has a 300 million won debt. That\u2019s it.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018Then how did he notice me?\u2019To her, that was the question. Siren\u2019s Necklace was a mythical grade accessory. Siren, of course, being the half-human half-bird creature in Greek mythology.\u2019Perception distortion\u2019 was one of the many abilities the necklace had. Without exceptional perception and eyesight, it was impossible to see through it.\u2014Do you still have doubts? I can put his name down on the notebook if you want.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dThe woman dropped her head.\u201cWe still have many chances. We can write his name down after we find out more about him.\u201d\u201cOh, Boss, you were here.\u201dAt that moment, an imposing voice resounded. The woman turned around. There, a large-bodied man was smiling viciously.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Boss.\u201dIt was a bit funny seeing a man call a woman, whose height couldn\u2019t reach his shoulders, Boss. However, the man clearly treated the woman with great respect.\u201cThis place is filled with powerful Heroes.\u201dClick, click.\u00a0The man clenched and unclenched his gauntlet-covered fist.\u201cTake it off. We didn\u2019t come here to cause trouble.\u201d\u201cAh, right. I almost forgot.\u201dAt the woman\u2019s command, the man\u2019s black gauntlet scattered into dust. He then scratched his neck in silence, while the woman glared at him coldly.\u201cW-What?\u201dStartled, the man asked. What the woman wanted to ask was said by the mysterious voice.\u2014The report.\u201cOh, right. There\u2019s nothing to report. I can pop everyone\u2019s heads with a flick of a finger.\u201d\u2014Idiot\u2026 That\u2019s obvious. I\u2019m talking about their future potential.The man rubbed his chin and pondered.\u201cHm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I went to watch the second year\u2019s rank 1 cadet, but he wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201d\u2014First years are who you should be watching. This year\u2019s freshman are said to be exceptional, so go look again. Oh, Boss, I have something to do now, so I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201cYeah, screw off.\u201d\u2014\u2026You shut up.The voice disappeared, and the man smiled as he stared at the woman.\u201cBoss, I don\u2019t think there are any good saplings. What do we do? Since we\u2019re here, can\u2019t we fight these self-proclaimed Heroes?\u201dThe man didn\u2019t hide his willingness to fight. He flaunted his battle spirit by releasing his magic power, which fluttered in the air through the wind. Though it was a careless move that could draw a keen Hero\u2019s attention, the woman watched his action without a change in her expression.\u201c\u2026Gyeong.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s test something.\u201dShe imbued magic power into her necklace. Immediately, the necklace changed color from gold to blue.\u201cHow is it? Can you see me?\u201d\u201cOho, is that the treasure you got before? I can see a faint silhouette, but not your face. Ah, I have to focus. Even though you\u2019re not moving, I keep losing sight of you if I\u2019m not focused. Ah, you just fused with the tree, Boss!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs expected, the necklace was working fine. Although the man was a muscle-brained brute who only trained his body, he still had a deep perception that matched his skill. But even he couldn\u2019t see through her, so how did a mere cadet manage to do so?\u201cOh, dang. I can\u2019t tell where you are now, Boss. Let me borrow that too. I\u2019m way too noticeable because of my large body. If there\u2019s someone I wanted to kill\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re done here. Go.\u201dThe woman cut off the man\u2019s chatter.\u201cMake sure you complete your mission.\u201d\u201cYes, Boss.\u201dThe man turned around without a fuss.The woman watched him walk away imposingly. His bulky back, mountainous shoulders, and flawlessly refined physique showed that he was anything but simple. In reality, he was an Irregular who had inherited the old Martial God\u2019s spirit and vigor.\u2014\u2026Cheok Jungyeong wasn\u2019t always that stupid, right Boss?Korean Peninsula\u2019s strongest swordsman and a storm of an era that had commanded the country\u2019s fate.His name, Cheok Jungyeong[1].That was the \u2018past life\u2019 he awakened through \u2018enlightenment\u2019 and \u2018inheritance\u2019.**The weekend passed by in the blink of an eye, and the combat exams began.Monday\u2019s exam was a duel.The exam was carried out in a simple way. Cadets could nominate cadets they wanted to fight. Each cadet had 3 nominations, and a nominated cadet couldn\u2019t refuse the duel.Though it might seem like a way for the strong to bully the weak, Cube wasn\u2019t so stupid. The exam was designed to be fair, giving bonus points depending on the difference in the cadets\u2019 rankings.For example, if Kim Suho who was rank 1 fought with a bottom-ranked cadet, he would receive negative points even if he won, while the bottom-ranked cadet would gain points even if he lost.Furthermore, an ungraded element called \u2018fame\u2019 encouraged cadets to challenge stronger opponents.There were thousands of cadets, numerous duel arenas, and limited time. Naturally, scouts from various countries\u2019 guilds spectated high ranking cadets. So if low ranking cadets challenged high ranking cadets, they would be able to appeal to these scouts even if they lost.\u201c\u2026I knew this would happen.\u201dBut even with this mechanism encouraging fairness and challenge\u2026I was nominated by the rank 18 cadet.[Duel 1][Rank 18 Kim Horak vs Rank 934 Kim Hajin]Even if Kim Horak won, he wouldn\u2019t gain more than three points. A fight between rank 934 and rank 18, it was obvious who would win.\u2026This muscle-brained buffoon.\u201cWell, what can I do.\u201dIt seemed he really wanted to beat me up.I put my laptop back in my cross bag and left the dorm.The scenery outside was completely different than usual.If I were to put it, it was touching and heartwarming. I could practically smell a flowery scent blowing in the wind.\u201cYunseok, say cheese~\u201d\u201cWow, isn\u2019t that Kim Suho? O-Oppa, are you friends with him!? I want to take a picture with him!\u201dMany cadets walked around with their family. Since last Friday, cadets were staying with their families in the same dorm room.I walked solitarily, watching other cadets laughing and joking with their family.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dAt that moment, someone scurried next to me like a cat. I paused and turned my head.\u201cTo the duel arena, obviously.\u201d\u201cOh right, Horak nominated you~\u201dYoo Yeonha feigned ignorance.\u201c\u2026Is there something you want to say?\u201d\u201cI tried to stop him but he insisted on fighting you. I had no choice.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dI continued walking. Yoo Yeonha followed after me, then suddenly backed off. There was a camera up ahead. It seemed she didn\u2019t want to be near me in front of a camera.Once the camera disappeared, Yoo Yeonha returned to my side.\u201cOh, also\u2026\u201dTak. She snapped her fingers. Immediately, a tall man walked up and handed her a suitcase.\u201cHere are 100 pinnacle grade bullets. But if you need any more, just tell me. You can also ask for any defensive equipment.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dJust when I was about to take it, Yoo Yeonha suddenly pulled the suitcase back.\u201cBut don\u2019t misunderstand. This isn\u2019t a payment for you saving my life.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dYoo Yeonha stuttered somewhat bashfully.\u201cT-This is\u2026 just a present.\u201d\u201cYeah, I get it, so give it here.\u201dUninterested, I snatched the suitcase from her hands.\u201cAlso, they\u2019re asking for my testimony.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cFor the Djinn incident.\u201d\u201cOh yeah, what about it?\u201d\u201cThey want me to testify, but I\u2019ve been delaying it since it looked like you wanted to hide your power.\u201dSo she purposely didn\u2019t report that I sniped the Djinn.\u201c\u2026Then keep doing that.\u201dYun Hyun was contracted to an especially dangerous devil, Lilith. Lilith\u2019s Djinns were ill-natured and heinous, so if they found out that I killed Yun Hyun, things could get difficult since I didn\u2019t have any backing.\u201cUnderstood. Ah, by the way, will Horak win?\u201dI paused. Her question had a strange connotation.\u2018Will Horak win?\u2019It sounded like she was asking if I would lose on purpose. In reality, I couldn\u2019t win even if I wanted to.\u201cThen I\u2019m off.\u201dBefore I could reply, Yoo Yeonha left.Was there another camera?Just when I was thinking as such, I saw a group of reporters, who noticed Yoo Yeonha and was running towards her.**I arrived at the second duel arena. It was only eight in the morning but the place was bustling with people. There were also numerous reporters equipped with cameras and microphones.Coincidentally, a nearby reporter was talking about why.\u201cToday, Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, and Kim Horak are scheduled to duel from 9 A.M. to 11 A.M.\u201dI plowed through the crowd of people and walked towards the duel arena. Suddenly, I was stopped by a man in an official Cube uniform. I asked, somewhat disgruntled.\u201cI\u2019m wearing a cadet uniform, can\u2019t you see?\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s not that. Cadets need to go that way.\u201dThe man pointed at a pathway next to the main entrance.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dI walked through the pathway and arrived at my assigned waiting room.[Waiting Room 5]This room was likely full of extras like me. People like Kim Suho and Chae Nayun were in waiting room 1, which was closest to the reporters.I opened the door. 30~40 cadets, who were talking among themselves, immediately fell silent. Their eyes landed on me. One, two, three\u2026 After three seconds, they retracted their gaze in disinterest and continued talking.I walked in and sat down on a random seat.\u201cI heard you were fighting Kim Horak.\u201dWhen I was resting by myself, someone I didn\u2019t know struck up a conversation. His face looked somewhat familiar, so he was likely in my class.I nodded without replying.\u201cDamn, Kim Horak must have you marked. You shouldn\u2019t have shown off so much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI wanted to say something but gave up. Instead, I murmured inwardly.\u2018Unlike you guys, I get stronger by showing off.\u2019\u201cOh right, why do you keep leaving Cube? Are you really throwing money in cabaret clubs and brothels?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt seemed these rumors were still going around. I shook my head silently.\u201cNo way, you really do?\u201dBut he interpreted my gesture as he wanted. Without a choice, I opened my mouth.\u201cNo. Even if I want to, I don\u2019t have the money.\u201d1. A historical figure. Google him for more info.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Intruders (3)The duel arena was a miniature version of the Roman Colosseum. The central arena was slightly bigger than a standard soccer field, while the seats circling the arena could seat about 5000 people.The design was a great success.Ten minutes before the start of a duel, the guest seats were packed full of people.\u201cHow did you get such a nice seat?\u201dThe high rank Hero, Oh Junhyuk, asked in surprise as he handed Seo Youngji a hotdog. The seats she grabbed were the frontmost seats, which had the best view of the arena.\u201cYou tell me to focus on the mission, but you come here first thing in the morning to grab the best seat\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and sit down.\u201dOh Junhyuk snickered and sat down next to her.\u201c\u2026Wow, it sure brings back memories, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYou must mean bad memories. I remember you saying you were beaten so hard that you couldn\u2019t even watch mixed martial arts afterwards.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve gotten better because it\u2019s always on TV. My son loves it too.\u201dMixed Martial Arts was one of the most popular sports worldwide. It was especially popular among kids and teenagers.The sport featured one-on-one or team battles between superhumans. Naturally, the fights were extremely flashy, with magic power blowing like storms and strikes cutting the earth in half. The might they displayed served as the perfect motivation for young children to pursue strength.\u201cReally? That\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d\u201cNice to hear? Please, the world must be coming to an end. Djinns are more active than ever but nowadays, becoming a sports star is ranked third for cadets choice of career path. They\u2019re saying they\u2019d rather go into sports than joining a small to medium sized guild.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with it.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with it? Because of people like you, the Association is in this pitiful state\u2026\u201dIn the middle of his sentence, Oh Junhyuk felt an extremely battle thirsty gaze.\u201c\u2026Who\u2019s that guy?\u201dHe stared at the seat on the opposite side of the arena.A man was giving a menacing look and smiling with his teeth out. His fearless and unrestrained smile was clearly aimed at Oh Junhyuk and Seo Youngji.\u201cHe\u2019s been doing that for a while. He must be a fan.\u201d\u201cA fan? He can see through our disguise?\u201d\u201cI guess so. Ah, it\u2019s starting.\u201dThe host announced the start of the day\u2019s duels, and Seo Youngji immediately took out her laptop.\u201cTypical Associate executive\u2026 Alright, who should I be looking out for?\u201d\u201cKim Suho and Chae Nayun. They\u2019re on the top of their class. And I guess Yi Yeonghan and Kim Horak too.\u201d\u201cOh! Two of the top 6 are here? Who are they fighting?\u201dKim Suho and Chae Nayun were well-known even in the Association. Even Oh Junhyuk, who wasn\u2019t into watching duels, couldn\u2019t help but be interested in their match.\u201cKim Suho is fighting Yi Yeonghan. Chae Nayun is fighting Joseph. Kim Horak is fighting Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cOther than Kim Horak, it looks like most of them chose appropriate opponents. So, who\u2019s Kim Hajin?\u201d\u201cKim Hajin, rank 934\u201d\u201c\u2026Rank 934? Isn\u2019t that too low? Is there anything special about him?\u201dSeo Youngji pushed up her glasses.\u201cThere are bad rumors about him. My cousin in Cube told me that he\u2019s quite distasteful.\u201d\u201cAh, so Kim Horak\u2019s punishing a delinquent. I see, I see. Who would have thought Kim Horak had a sense of justice? He\u2019s sacrificing his own grade to do this too\u2026\u201dTak. Seo Youngji closed her laptop.\u201cIt\u2019s starting.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dOh Junhyuk crossed his arms and leaned against the back of the seat.The first duel was between the two aforementioned cadets.\u2014The first duel is between rank 18, Kim Horak, and rank 934, Kim Hajin! How will Kim Hajin overcome the difference in their rank? Why did Kim Horak nominate such a low ranked cadet?The unfortunate host tried his best to hype up the match which had an obvious result.A mana barrier went up around the arena. It was to prevent the two cadets\u2019 attacks from leaking out.\u201cThat must be him.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dOh Junhyuk looked at the man walking out from the right passageway. He looked\u2026 average. So average in fact that he wouldn\u2019t even remember his face the next day.**Cadets were prohibited from using their personal weapons during exams. It was because scouts wanted to observe cadets based on their ability rather than the power of their weapons. As such, I couldn\u2019t use the Desert Eagle. I also wanted to hide Aether if possible.In other words, I only had a training handgun and a protective armor provided by Cube to rely on. With just these two, the chances of me beating Kim Horak was slim to none. But that didn\u2019t mean I planned on losing one-sidedly, especially against that bastard Kim Horak.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dLed by the staff, I walked up to the stage.First, I took a good look around the arena. A translucent mana barrier surrounded the arena with thousands of spectators looking down. Both an indescribable pressure and excitement overwhelmed me.While I was shaking from this strange sensation, Kim Horak walked up from the other side.\u201cOh~ Kim Horak.\u201dI smiled and waved my hand.\u201cHow did you do on your written exams?\u201dI provoked him, but Kim Horak equipped his gauntlet without talking. I also held up my handgun. Our physical stats should differ by at least 4 points. It was the difference between an ordinary human and an adult elephant. He would snap my body in half the moment he closed in on me.\u201cLet\u2019s take it easy, alright?\u201d\u2014Counting down! Three!The host must have thought we were ready, as he started counting down.Crack\u2014 Crack\u2014 I could hear Kim Horak cracking his knuckles from all the way here.\u2014Two!He ignited his magic power, drawing it above the surface of his body. Layering magic power around one\u2019s body was a technique called qi reinforcement. Kim Horak was still inexperienced in it, but my bullets were unable to penetrate his incomplete qi reinforcement.\u2014One!His center of gravity leaned forward and he dug his feet into the ground.Currently, we were 150 meters away. It was a distance Kim Horak could close in just three seconds.But I didn\u2019t come unprepared.\u2014Start!Kim Horak immediately charged forward like a savage beast. My sense of time slowed down. I had activated Bullet Time.I released Stigma\u2019s magic power which flowed into my handgun and adhered to a single bullet. Fusing with Stigma\u2019s magic power, the bullet then carried a special property as I set beforehand.\u2018Anti-magic\u2019.When it clashed with reinforced magic power, it would shatter it instantly.\u201cEhew.\u201dI had to use half of Stigma\u2019s magic power, but it was worth it.I pulled the trigger at the wild boar charging towards me. He didn\u2019t even try to dodge my bullet. In his mind, it wasn\u2019t even a question whether my bullets could threaten him in any way.Clang\u2014But when my bullet clashed with his qi reinforcement, a strange explosion occurred. The explosion shattered Kim Horak\u2019s qi reinforcement as though it was a glass window.Now that he was bare-skinned, he was nothing but a target with a huge surface area.I pulled the trigger freely.Kim Horak jumped to the side, clearly aiming to circle around me. I followed his movement and shot my bullets accordingly, and Kim Horak backed off helplessly. The barrage of gunshots didn\u2019t stop. I continuously pulled the trigger, bullets endlessly seeking after Kim Horak.He held on, jumping up, rolling to the side, and lifting the arena\u2019s tile to use as a shield.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dAfter stopping for a moment, I rubbed my chin and stared at Kim Horak. A blue aura was rising from his body once again. His qi reinforcement had regenerated.But qi reinforcement wasn\u2019t a technique one could use repeatedly. Even now, it was easy to see that his qi reinforcement was thinner than the one he initially created.It was likely that this was his final one.\u201cHuu.\u201dHe licked his dried lips and charged at me once again. This time, his movements were quite complex. Like a crab, he zigzagged as he steadily charged forward. His movements weren\u2019t as predictable, as it had no set pattern. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t just shoot at him, as he moved faster than my bullet.But I came prepared in case this happened.I took out a dagger from my belt and tethered the blade with Stigma\u2019s magic power. Then, I lightly threw it.Master Sharpshooter also applied to throwing. The dagger flew forward like a boomerang, but this dagger didn\u2019t have any special power. It likely couldn\u2019t even scratch his qi reinforcement.\u201cFuck!\u201dBut Kim Horak didn\u2019t know that.He was likely worried, thinking there was something special about the dagger. Just like how my first bullet carried an unexpected power, he had to have suspicions about this dagger.In the end, Kim Horak hopped to the side to dodge the dagger. I pulled on the string of magic power tethered to the dagger, changing its trajectory. The dagger turned in a ninety-degree angle and chased after Kim Horak. Judging by his widened eyes, he must be thinking this.\u2018There\u2019s definitely something about this dagger.\u2019However, Kim Horak didn\u2019t try to dodge the dagger. A dagger wasn\u2019t as fast or as small as a bullet. As such, Kim Horak tried to grab the dagger. And he succeeded. It was an incredible display of hand-eye coordination.But in order to catch something, one had to stop moving.A bullet I fired penetrated his qi reinforcement.\u201cUk!\u201dThe bullet cleanly shattered his qi reinforcement. While Kim Horak staggered, I also retrieved the dagger.Now, Kim Horak was completely open. The question was what he would do next\u2026\u201c\u2026Damn it!\u201dAs expected, he rushed in recklessly. He didn\u2019t back off or move to the side. He simply charged forward while taking all my bullets.Right arm, left arm, right thigh, left calf\u2026He held on even after being shot in multiple places.\u201cHuaaaap\u2014!\u201dAfter finally closing in on me, he swung his fist. I immediately tumbled back to dodge his attack, and Kim Horak chased after me.Eventually, I arrived at a dead end with the wall behind me. But before Kim Horak could feel any joy, I climbed up the wall.With Parkour\u2019s power, I could climb anything that was considered a wall. My hands and feet adhered to the wall like magnets, and I continued to fire from a distance Kim Horak could never reach.\u201cHey! You fuck, this is cheating!\u201dTaking this exact situation into account, I had focused my bullets on his legs. Kim Horak didn\u2019t have the strength to jump this high.Now, it was a completely one-sided attack.Demoted to a mere target, Kim Horak constantly moved around hoping to dodge my bullets. However, even a single hit was enough to strike him with pain. Thigh, shoulder, foot\u2026 Injuries continued to pile up, and Kim Horak continued to slow down as a result.Eventually, he stopped completely.I aimed for his stomach for a final attack. Every cadet had a device around their stomach that would automatically end the duel if one side received a critical injury.Click\u2014\u201c\u2026?\u201dBut no bullet went out. I rummaged through my pockets. I had no bullets.\u201cAh.\u201dI had brought 240 bullets, but it seemed I had used them all.With no other choice, I jumped down.As I completely used up Stigma\u2019s magic power, I only had my dagger to work with.All I had to do was to approach Kim Horak and stab his stomach\u2026 But it didn\u2019t look like Kim Horak would surrender.\u201cHuu\u2026 Huu\u2026\u201dHe was glaring at me with ferocious killing intent. If I got close, he would undoubtedly rip me to shreds. To make things worse, one of his arms was unhurt.I looked around.I remembered the crowd being excited at first, but now the arena was eerily quiet. It was as though I was in a library.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMm\u2026\u201dThis was a good enough payback.Kim Horak was unable to hit me single time, but I had pummeled him continuously. Not to mention, my score would go up even if I lost this duel.I sneered at Kim Horak and raised my hands.Then, I spoke quietly.\u201cI surrender.\u201dHweee\u2014The referee immediately blew his whistle.The mana barrier surrounding the arena disappeared.I walked away, whistling leisurely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Intruders (4)The duel was over. About eight minutes had passed.It wasn\u2019t particularly fast or slow.The result of the duel was as expected, but because the process was beyond anyone\u2019s imagination, the audience was dead silent.\u201cHow scary. Those were real bullets, right?\u201dIn this silence, Oh Junhyuk looked down at Kim Hajin, who was walking to his waiting room.\u201cYep.\u201dSeo Youngji nodded.\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t look hurt at all, even though he looks like a beehive.\u201dThis time, he spoke while pointing at Kim Horak. Just like he said, Kim Horak\u2019s body was full of bullets. Though the vital points like the neck and heart were covered in protective armor, he didn\u2019t bleed much and didn\u2019t look to be in pain either.\u201cFor martial art types, their bodies are their weapons. Recovery is their specialty.\u201d\u201cSo, what did you think?\u201d\u201cKim Hajin did well and Kim Horak was too reckless. Kim Horak tried to show too much and suffered a loss. If he took it slow\u2026 Well, I guess the result would have been the same.\u201dIn truth, Kim Horak didn\u2019t need to use qi reinforcement. He could have simply imbued his gauntlet with magic power and slowly overwhelmed Kim Hajin.\u201c\u2026I guess it was Kim Hajin\u2019s tactical victory. He still lost though.\u201dOh Junhyuk scratched the back of his neck.He wasn\u2019t sure how to put it, because Kim Hajin surrendered a won fight.\u201cIt does leave a bad aftertaste.\u201dSeo Youngji murmured with a frown. A picture of Kim Hajin was displayed on her laptop screen. She was writing a report.\u201cWhat, that he lost on purpose?\u201d\u201cNo, Kim Hajin put up a good fight, but I can understand his loss.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dOh Junhyuk looked at Kim Horak, who was still standing in the arena. He was being treated with an expression that could be both indignation and relief. No, it couldn\u2019t be called treatment. Kim Horak simply drank a high-rank potion, and the bullets popped out of his muscles when he flexed.\u201cAt first\u2026 no, from the start until the end, Kim Hajin overwhelmed him. His initial reaction speed and dynamic vision honestly surprised me. His firing speed was unbelievable too.\u201d\u201cI agree. His firing speed was something else.\u201d\u201cBut after a certain point, he slowed down as much as Kim Horak slowed down, even though he only attacked without being hit. I think Kim Hajin can\u2019t maintain that movement for long.\u201dTak tak tak.\u00a0Seo Youngji spoke as she continuously tapped on the laptop\u2019s keyboard like a shorthand typist.\u201cAnd before Kim Hajin surrendered, he tried to finish off Kim Horak. I saw him pull the trigger but nothing came out. Kim Hajin\u2019s face stiffened at that point, and he rummaged through his pockets without taking anything out.\u201d\u201cSo he used up his bullets.\u201d\u201cYep. But he didn\u2019t try to fight Kim Horak, even though Kim Horak only had his left hand to work with. Why?\u201d\u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t confident in winning?\u201dSeo Youngji lightly nodded.\u201cRight. He used up his bullets but he hadn\u2019t won. Kim Horak only had a single arm left, but he could still fight. At that point, it was Kim Hajin\u2019s loss.\u201dOh Junhyuk took a deep breath. Then, he tilted his head.\u201cOh right, how did he break Kim Horak\u2019s qi reinforcement? He only used a single bullet to do it too. Twice, at that.\u201d\u201cRight, that\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s why I said it left a bad aftertaste.\u201dSeo Youngji took off her glasses. As it looked like she was getting ready to explain things in depth, Oh Junhyuk swallowed his saliva.\u201cMost people, including you, probably missed it, but I saw the movement of magic power. It was stuck to his bullet.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that possible? He\u2019s only a cadet too!\u201dMana was an extremely difficult power to control. Making it thin enough to coat a bullet and compressing it dense enough to destroy a qi reinforcement, that was something even Oh Junhyuk wasn\u2019t confident in doing.\u201cI\u2019m looking it up on the market to see if it\u2019s a trick that uses an item or if it\u2019s related to his Gift. If he used an item, it\u2019s cheating. But if it\u2019s his Gift\u2026 I don\u2019t know what Gift it is, but it might be the first of its kind.\u201dSeeing Seo Youngji explaining seriously, Oh Junhyuk sighed.\u201cHuu\u2026 Anyways, I don\u2019t like it. I thought Kim Horak was carrying out justice, but he was crushed.\u201dKim Horak won, but it was a Pyrrhic victory.In a one-on-one fight, warriors directly countered sharpshooters. Kim Horak should have been able to easily overwhelm Kim Hajin, but in reality, he was toyed by him. Not only would this incident become a trauma for him, guild scouts\u2019 evaluation of him could also plummet. On the other hand, this cadet named Kim Hajin made his name known to the entire crowd. That, of course, included the many guild associates present.\u2014Yes, Kim Hajin. Never heard of him? Me neither, but he just fought with Kim Horak and he\u2026\u2014He uses a gun. Yes, his limit should be clear, but he broke a qi reinforcement. Yes, it was an incomplete qi reinforcement, but just the fact that he broke it\u2026\u2014I don\u2019t know how he destroyed a qi reinforcement either. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling you\u2026Guild associates were already making calls.\u201cJustice doesn\u2019t always win. Plus, we don\u2019t really know which side is on the side of justice.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, yeah. Just keep writing your report. New talent discovered. That\u2019s a nice title.\u201dAt that moment, the host announced the next battle.Seo Youngji glanced at the watch on her wrist.\u201cKim Hajin, I\u2019ll have to remember him. Let\u2019s leave after we see Kim Suho\u2019s match. It\u2019s coming up in three fights.\u201d\u201cYeah, I planned on doing the same. \u2026What is he complaining about?\u201dOh Junhyuk gestured at the arena. The man, who was grinning at them just a moment ago, was now staring at the right passageway with killing intent. It was where Kim Hajin was.Seo Youngji replied uninterested.\u201c\u2026He must not have liked how the duel turned out. Everyone has their own taste.\u201d**After the first duel, I used two of my own nominations. I picked two male cadets around the 300~400 rank. The duels started around 5 and ended around 8.The fights were\u2026 strange comebacks.Of course, I wasn\u2019t at my best. Stigma\u2019s magic power was slow to recover because I depleted it during my fight with Kim Horak, and I also couldn\u2019t use Bullet Time, which was limited to once a day.In addition, \u2018swordsmen\u2019 were just hard for me to deal with.My first opponent, Kim Horak, had a bigger firing surface area because he used a gauntlet (though it was more like a fingerless glove).And even with Kim Horak, if he didn\u2019t try to cover his body with qi reinforcement, saved his magic power by covering only parts of his body, and slowly choked me out without trying to end the fight immediately\u2026I would have been completely helpless.His carelessness was his downfall. He wanted to show the scouts too much. He also might have been aiming for the \u2018quickest victory\u2019 record.But unlike Kim Horak, the other two opponents slowly closed in on me. They blocked my bullets with their long-reach swords and dragged the fight out without charging towards me. It was a real hassle since I couldn\u2019t approach them.But in the end, I managed to claim victory in both duels. It was all thanks to luck.The first opponent lost to a lucky ricochet.The bullet I accidentally fired on the ground bounced off and struck his armpit. The opponent dropped his sword from the unexpected pain and instantly surrendered.The second opponent lost to his own mistake.This battle was a drawn-out battle lasting 30 minutes. During this time, the opponent sweated too much from continuously blocking my bullets, and the sweat pooled up to a puddle. Right before the referee announced a draw, he charged towards me while I was reloading my gun. Then, he slipped on his own sweat.Hoiiik\u2014!I still remembered his scream.\u201cGod, that guy was just too funny.\u201dI giggled and lied down on my bed.The final result was 2 wins 1 loss.As sharpshooters gained bonus points for fighting close ranged warriors, I no longer had to worry about being held back.\u201cAuuu~\u201dI stretched and looked out the window.It was deep into the night. The darkness concealed the world like a thick curtain, and the moon, which was the only source of light, was faint and pale. The eerie outside scenery brought an unfounded anxiety.\u201c\u2026I hope everything will be okay.\u201dI suddenly thought of the Chameleon Troupe. I saw them at the arena. Not only was the boss of the Chameleon Troupe here, \u2018that guy\u2019 was also here as I expected.The monster with the instincts of a savage beast, completely obsessed with the pursuit of strength.If things went according to the original story, he should have felt Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak\u2019s potential and returned peacefully after promising to fight them in the future.But that wasn\u2019t the case now.Cube was currently filled with people he wanted to fight \u2018immediately\u2019.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can do anything about it.\u201dAll he needed to do was breath heavily for my head to explode.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dMy wandering gaze landed on the corner of my bed.The gift Park Soohyuk gave me was there. He sent a rather expensive gift as gratitude for his first investor.\u201cA drone\u2026\u201dIt was a fist-sized drone with a camera.**A chilling wind brushed against leaves, creating a bleak melody.In one of Cube\u2019s artificial forests, a man was sitting on a tree trunk. He was in the middle of pitch-black darkness, but his bulky body could be seen easily. The formal suit he was wearing made him especially eye-catching.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t much by my standard.\u201dThe man murmured in a low voice.\u2014By your standard?\u201cYep, he\u2019s a mouse by my standard. I don\u2019t like him, a tiny guy only shooting from a faraway distance.\u201d\u2014You mean you don\u2019t like his battle style\u2026 Whew, you were supposed to find out why Boss is interested in him.\u201cHow should I know?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice turned hostile.\u2014What are you getting mad for?\u201cYou would understand if you saw that little rat\u2019s fight. Rats like him\u2026 I need to pop off their heads\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes were already bloodshot.The duels he saw between rookies made his blood boil. He wanted to jump in and show them what a real fight was. Though he barely held in this urge, his instincts were constantly contending with his reason.\u2014What about Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak?\u201cMm\u2026 I think they were okay\u2026 Maybe not\u2026\u201d\u2014Make up your mind.\u201cThey were fine. Happy? I want to wait until they grow up to fight.\u201dAt that moment\u2026\u201cWho are you?\u201dA voice rang out from behind him. The man turned around. It was a police officer who was deployed for the combat exams. The man didn\u2019t notice him because he was a weakling who hasn\u2019t even learned magic power.\u2014Don\u2019t forget why Boss brought you.At these words, the man nodded.\u201cYeah\u2026 I know. I\u2019m a master when it comes to recognizing the strong.\u201d\u2014Right, that\u2019s the only reason.\u201cExcuse me, what are you doing here? The forest is off-limits to outsiders. Please come out.\u201dThe police officer approached the man with a flashlight. The man stared at him with scorn. The killing intent in his eyes radiated a clear warning.But the officer couldn\u2019t see the man\u2019s expression in the dark, walking closer towards him.\u201cOh right, how did you get in here in the first place? Sir? Come out!\u201dThe man laughed.\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201d\u2014What.\u201cI\u2019ll go after I crack open a nut.\u201d\u201cSir, stop talking to yourself and come out!\u201dImmediately afterward, the man\u2019s fist cut through the air. To be exact, he punched the air, causing a shockwave that ravaged the officer. Crushed by the pressure, the officer\u2019s body no longer resembled a human body.\u2014Did you do it?\u201cYep.\u201d\u2014\u2026Boss is going to kill you.\u201cKeep it a secret.\u201d\u2014I will until she finds out. For now, go do your job.Thanks to the weakling, the man felt like his mind cleared up slightly. He stood up and began to walk. The dorms were only a few minutes away\u2026After a while, his keen hearing picked up on faint voices.\u2014Hey, what is this?\u2014Ueeek. Fuck, this is a corpse! Contact the headquarters!He turned around. Far off in the distance, he could see two officers vomiting. A grin emerged on his face.Wiing\u2014 Wiing\u2014\u201cMm?\u201dHearing the sound of a mosquito buzzing, he turned back to his front.\u2014What?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Nothing, just a mosquito.\u201d\u2014How lame. Hurry up before I tell Boss that you killed someone.\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m going.\u201dThe man quickened his pace.A tiny drone hovering above him silently watched the man leave before disappearing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sudden Encounter (1)\u2014Tak.I closed my laptop.\u201c\u2026Well that\u2019s terrifying.\u201dCheok Jungyeong killed someone without hesitation, purely for his own enjoyment.This was the world I created.On the surface, the society seemed functional with science and magic vastly improving quality of life, but on the inside, demi-humans who didn\u2019t care for the law or morals lurked within.Demi-humans didn\u2019t just refer to Djinns.Humans who rejected the existence of Heroes, but had supernatural powers just like them. They were officially known as \u2018wanted criminals\u2019, but the public called them \u2018Villains\u2019.\u201cWhat killed him?\u201dThe drone was unable to capture exactly what happened.Only after slowing it down ten times was I able to catch a glimpse. Cheok Jungyeong threw out a jab, and a violent pressure erupted, instantly killing the police officer.\u201cHe killed someone without even making contact\u2026 Also, this thing\u2026\u201dI stared at the drone on my bed. It was more useful than I expected. If I bought a more expensive drone and added a bunch of settings to it, I might be able to put it to good use.Wiing\u2014At that moment, my smartwatch suddenly rang.[Yo, can I nominate you?]It was Chae Nayun. She seemed to be talking about tomorrow\u2019s duels.[Why?][What do you mean why? You already provoked me several times.]I still had one nomination left. Cadets had to duel at least three times and could duel at most six times. In other words, I didn\u2019t need to fight anyone else unless someone nominated me.[No, I\u2019m exhausted from today.]There was no chance of me winning in a one-on-one fight against Chae Nayun. Not only were arrows stronger than bullets, I also didn\u2019t have the physical ability to dodge her rapid fire shots.[You can think about that tomorrow morning. Also, how did you destroy qi reinforcement with a bullet? It didn\u2019t look like you used your personal weapon. That\u2019s all people are talking about. That was your Gift, right?]So this was her real goal.I ignored her message. Thinking about it now, I doubt she had any nominations left. Even if she did, she probably wouldn\u2019t use it to maintain her peak condition. After all, she was scheduled to duel Rachel tomorrow.\u201cWhoa, it\u2019s already 12?\u201dI took off my smartwatch and looked at the time. It was already midnight.When I turned off the light and lied down on the bed, I received another message.[You put on quite a show.]This time, it was Yoo Yeonha.I gave a short reply.[I didn\u2019t want to get hit.][Because you destroyed a qi reinforcement with your bullet, many guilds are showing interest in you.][I know.]I had gained quite a bit of SP, 185 since noon. Once I collected a bit more, I would be able to create a new Art or Physique.[They\u2019re already calling your Gift \u2018superpower bullet\u2019 or \u2018bullet reinforcement\u2019\u2026 Speaking of which, what do you think about guilds?][Those names suck.][No, I mean, what do you think about Essence of the Strait?]\u201cHmm.\u201dYoo Yeonha had a tendency to judge people based on their usefulness. This would only get worse as she got older, and she would eventually become someone who didn\u2019t care about someone\u2019s background as long as they were useful.[Contacting cadets beforehand is illegal. That\u2019s a 500 million won penalty.]I sent a thoughtless message, trying to end the conversation.[First, I\u2019m still a cadet. Cadets can try to recruit other cadets without being in trouble with the law. Second, I can afford to pay that much.]She returned a very serious reply.I felt a bit awkward.[That\u2019s not your money, it\u2019s your parents\u2019.][Oh right, your acting was pretty superb on your second and third match.]\u201c\u2026This girl.\u201dWhy was she talking like I was hiding my power? If anything, Kim Suho was the one hiding his power.[Were you watching?][I had time. But to be honest, I think your growth speed is too quick. You were rank 934 during the initial exams, but if you corner a rank 18 after switching to a sharpshooter role, it\u2019s too eye-catching no matter how much aptitude you have for it\u2026]\u201cWhat is she on about now?\u201dI also ignored Yoo Yeonha\u2019s message. In truth, my eyelids were closing. I fought three times today, so it wasn\u2019t surprising.\u201c\u2026Oh right.\u201dI suddenly remembered something else to do.I turned on my smartwatch and sent Park Soohyuk a message.[Hyung, thanks for the drone. I\u2019ll take good care of it.]**Chameleon Troupe\u2019s hiding place. In a pitch-black abandoned factory without a single stream of light, Chameleon Troupe\u2019s boss was sitting cross-legged on the ground. A series of battles from earlier in the day was being played in her head.Kim Suho\u2019s swordsmanship was just like what she had heard. His sword strikes were light like a feather, but carried a heavy destructive power and connected fluidly with his next move. Each of his movements was natural like flowing water. His swordsmanship was so well polished and sharpened that it seemed more suitable to call it a sword art than swordsmanshipNext was Shin Jonghak. His spearmanship was truly domineering and vicious. He stabbed directly at his opponent\u2019s heart and brutalized anyone who was constantly on the defensive. Using the spear\u2019s long reach, he constantly cut, smacked, and stabbed his opponent. Rather than a duel, it was more like a one-sided beating.\u2014Next is the man you were talking about, Boss. The one who called you hot.She nodded silently. The video being reflected in her eyes changed. This time, it was a battle between a gun and a fist. A sharpshooter and a warrior. It was clear who should be the winner.However\u2026She abruptly opened her eyes. She only watched the video for a short time, but during this time, the sharpshooter\u2019s bullet had destroyed the warrior\u2019s magic power. She examined the nature of the magic power around the bullet. If her eyes weren\u2019t seeing things, it could only be one thing. The power of \u2018anti-magic\u2019. It was the power she was looking for, the silver bullet that could kill \u2018that man\u2019.\u2014Interesting, isn\u2019t it? I was surprised too when I first saw it.\u201cKim Hajin. Write his name down on the notebook.\u201dShe spoke without hesitation.\u2014\u2026Really?\u201cYes.\u201d\u2014But Jungyeong said he didn\u2019t like him.\u201cGyeong hates sharpshooters.\u201dCheok Jungyeong was a warrior in and out. Staring at each other\u2019s eyes and trying to strike down death upon the enemy with deadly killing intent; he believed that was what a battle was.Even in the Chameleon Troupe, there were members he didn\u2019t like just because they fought from a long range.\u2014I guess so. He did say Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak were okay.\u201cThen put their names down too.\u201d\u2014Then we\u2019ll only have 5 slots left. Is that okay?People who had their names written down on the \u2018notebook\u2019 could have their live locations tracked. In a way, the notebook was like a GPS. In addition, the owner of the notebook could teleport to the location of a written target.\u2014Who do we prioritize?In exchange for its wide-ranged power, the condition, [target cannot know that his name is on the notebook], had to be met. But as long as the target wasn\u2019t told about the notebook, there was no reason he should notice.\u201cMm.\u201dThe boss closed her eyes. She remembered what happened a long time ago.The death of the previous leader of Chameleon Troupe 11 years ago, \u201cthat\u201d man\u2019s betrayal, and the day she cried for the first time. In front of a grave, she felt the new burden on her shoulders as the Chameleon Troupe changed its colors once more.\u201cFor now\u2026\u201dThe Chameleon Troupe survived even with the death of its leader. A new leader was chosen, and the group managed to take a huge step forward using resentment and vengeance as nourishment.But now, they couldn\u2019t find where the traitor was hiding. No, even if they knew, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it.So, she kept searching this entire time.The power of anti-magic, which could destroy the Magic Power Physique\u2026\u201cPut Kim Hajin on top priority.\u201d**Tuesday. I remained in my room until noon. Although duels continued until today, no one had nominated me.\u201cI should have just stayed in the dorm.\u201dCurrently, it was 1 P.M., and I was outside. To be honest, I was bored. I also wanted to watch Chae Nayun (rank 4) duel Rachel (rank 3), and Kim Suho (rank 1) duel Yohei (rank 8).\u201cThe seats are full.\u201dHowever, the arena was completely packed full of people. The first arena had 5000 seats, but there wasn\u2019t an empty seat no matter how hard I looked.\u2018Should I go back? Or should I just stand and watch?\u2019When I was having such thoughts at the back of the arena, two people, who seemed to be a couple, suddenly stood up and left.\u201cK-Kuhum.\u201dI sat down on the seat, feeling like I was walking on eggshells as I hoped they wouldn\u2019t come back.\u2014Thank you for waiting!Thankfully, the couple didn\u2019t come back, and the host announced the start of the duel along with the excited cheering of the crowd.Sssss.Someone sat down next to me. I glanced to the side with a bag of popcorn in my hand, then looked back ahead.\u201c\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, the image of the person flashed in my head. She\u2026 looked familiar. I swallowed the popcorn in my mouth and glanced sideways once again.At the same time, my heart stopped beating and my breathing froze.\u201cShe\u201d was sitting next to me.The boss of the Chameleon Troupe. As someone who lived her life without a name, she was only known by her title, Yasha.I stuffed my shaking hands into the popcorn and fixed my eyes on the dueling arena. My heart, which temporarily stopped, finally began to thump crazily.Why was she here? Did I do something wrong? Or was it a coincidence?Right, it had to be a coincidence. She was here to watch Kim Suho and just happened to sit next to me\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the middle of my panicked thinking\u2026\u201cHuak!\u201dSomeone who was walking down the stairs suddenly tripped. This nameless person was holding onto a large-sized soda. The soda promptly spun in the air before landing on someone\u2019s head like a hat. For the record, the soda was filled to the brim.I didn\u2019t know whether luck played a part in it, but not a single drop landed on me. However\u2026I turned to the side, feeling a tinge of dizziness.Under the soda cup standing like a party hat, Boss\u2019 black pupils were trembling uncontrollably.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sudden Encounter (2)\u201cOh no, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dThe nameless person apologized in shock. The Chameleon Troupe\u2019s boss seemed just as shocked as she remained completely still. First, I took the soda cup off of her head. The ice cubes sitting on her head immediately drizzled down, and Boss shut her eyes close.\u201cPlease wait just one minute. I\u2019ll go get a towel\u2026\u201dBut at that momenet, the nameless person suddenly froze. His eyes turned lifeless and he began to walk out in a strange zombie-like manner.I glanced at Boss\u2019 neck on which a faint light was glimmering. It seemed what just happened was her necklace\u2019s ability. That necklace\u2026 I felt like I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t quite remember it. I wasn\u2019t too keen on item settings.\u201cHaa.\u201dShe suddenly let out a deep sigh. Then, she turned towards me.I scratched my neck.I had a tiny pack of tissues in my pocket, but it was nowhere near enough to take care of the mess on her head and clothes.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut because her eyes were fixed on me, I took out the tissues.\u201cUm, you can use this\u2026\u201dShe looked back and forth between me and the pack of tissues. She then grabbed the tissues and wiped her face, legs, and arms.\u201cThank you.\u201dThen, she gave a light bow and thanked me. I fell into a daze momentarily. What just happened?At that moment, the host\u2019s loud voice resounded.\u2014We are now starting!The crowd cheered loudly. A countless number of reporters aimed their cameras at the arena. Although they weren\u2019t allowed to film the duels, they were allowed to take pictures. The reporters from England were especially excited.\u2014Duel between rank 3 Rachel and rank 4 Chae Nayun!A battle between a rapier and a bow.This was something that happened in the original story. In other words, I already knew who would win \u2013 Rachel.I stared at Rachel and Chae Nayun standing on the arena. Though they were far away, I could see them as though they were only a couple feet away. Chae Nayun\u2019s mouth moved. I could hear what she was saying.\u2014Princess, our rank will be changing today.Rachel didn\u2019t react to Chae Nayun\u2019s provocation.\u2014Beginning countdown! Three! Two!Chae Nayun aimed her bow at Rachel, and Rachel held up her rapier.Facing each other, neither side had even the tiniest imbalance in their postures. Waiting for the start signal, they concealed their openings while searching for their opponent\u2019s openings.\u2014Start!Chae Nayun fired her arrow immediately. Her magic arrow flew out at lightning speed. However, Rachel skirted past the arrow by a hair\u2019s breadth with refined, efficient movements.Chae Nayun continued with a barrage of arrows. When the arrows raining down from the sky hit the ground, they split into several offshoots and took on unpredictable paths. It seemed this was the plan Chae Nayun made for this fight. Since Rachel would just dodge her arrows if she shot at her directly, Chae Nayun was trying to box her in.However, Rachel dodged the terrifying barrage of arrows elegantly. Not only that, but she didn\u2019t hesitate to stab with her rapier when given the chance. The magic power from her attacks shot towards Chae Nayun like beams of light. Even so, Chae Nayun didn\u2019t dodge them. Instead, she emitted magic power in the form of a shield to block them.Immediately, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause. Chae Nayun\u2019s magic power control had already surpassed the level of a cadet.However, the outcome of this fierce battle was predetermined. Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t win against Rachel.Rachel was a swordsman specialized in receiving long ranged attacks. Her slender and flexible body could dodge arrows with the slightest movement, and her attacks of delicate magic power continuously disrupted an archer\u2019s posture. Chae Nayun created a shield to prevent her posture from becoming unstable, but this method was too costly in magic power.The moment Chae Nayun\u2019s magic power ran out, it would be Rachel\u2019s victory.\u201cI saw your duel against Kim Horak.\u201dAt that moment, a voice suddenly rang out from next to me.Startled, I jolted slightly.Because I was too focused on Chae Nayun and Rachel\u2019s duel, I had forgotten who was sitting next to me. It was incredibly foolish, considering she was currently far more important than Rachel or Chae Nayun.\u201cUm, thank you.\u201dI replied as calmly as possible.She asked while staring at me.\u201cWas that your Gift?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not something that I can reveal so easily.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe took out a business card from her pocket.\u201cThis is who I am.\u201dShe gave me the business card.[Li Xiaopeng][Desolate Moon\u2019s grade 3 Hero][Contact address: 0103-3243-9203-93]This was likely one of her many fake identities. Even so, my heart trembled as very few people had way of contacting her. In order to not make it obvious, I simply smiled and muttered.\u201cIt\u2019s illegal to scout cadets in advance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe tried to put away her business card.\u201cAh, but\u2026\u201dI grabbed her wrist. As I thought, she didn\u2019t know about playing hard to get.\u201cI\u2019ll hold onto yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe nodded and gave me her business card.\u201cI\u2019ll leave now. Contact us whenever you want.\u201dWith that, she got up. As she walked out, I stared at her back in a daze.\u201c\u2026What did she come here for?\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand. No matter how much I thought about it, there shouldn\u2019t have been any reason for her to visit me at this point.**All duels ended by 5 P.M.Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Rachel, and a cadet named Joo Youngho were the only ones to win all their duels. Because cadets could fight up to three times a day, many unexpected outcomes had occurred due to one side being tired.\u2014Wow, that was amazing. Did you see Kim Suho? How stylish can he get?\u2014Chae Nayun lost to Rachel\u2026 I\u2019m a bit bitter. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen Korea\u2019s rising star losing to a foreigner.By the time I left the arena, the sky had already turned dark. Many spectators brushed past me as they reflected on today\u2019s battles.Before I returned to the dorm, I first went into an alleyway in the back of the arena. After sitting down in a random spot, I took out the drone I placed in my cross bag.This drone was quite different than the original, as I added several settings like battery life boost, stealth mode, and target lock-on. These changes would last for four days, which was when the Chameleon Troupe would leave. Consequently, the modification was relatively cheap in SP.\u201cFly.\u201dI threw the drone into the air. The drone flew into the forest, and I got up to head back to the dorm.\u2014\u2026kuk, huk\u2026 kuk\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dBut a sudden crying sound made me stop. It sounded a bit like an animal crying, but it was also pitiful enough to make me turn to its direction. My eyes broke through several walls in the path, and in a nearby forest close to the back of the arena, I saw someone hiding between trees and crying.It was Chae Nayun. Her body was shaking and her face was buried between her knees.\u201cAh.\u201dThis event, I remembered it.It was the when Chae Nayun would completely fall for Kim Suho. Soon, he would come to console Chae Nayun on her defeat, and with everything else that should have happened between them, Chae Nayun would come to see Kim Suho as not just a friend. Although things had changed slightly from the original story, it seemed the big picture remained the same.I turned back without much thought.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dBut I hesitated to leave.Kim Suho would console Chae Nayun, but his kindness would only comfort her.\u201cYou can do better next time,\u201d \u201cWork hard with me,\u201d \u201cI will help you get stronger\u201d\u2026 Such words wouldn\u2019t really help Chae Nayun.In life, it was sometimes better to give up rather than continuing to work hard. But there was no such thing as giving up in Kim Suho\u2019s dictionary. He never gave up on anything and never suggested others to give up.Because of Kim Suho, Chae Nayun wouldn\u2019t give up on using a bow for a long time.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dIn the end, I turned on my smartwatch.The message Chae Nayun sent me last night was there.[Hey, don\u2019t ignore me. If you don\u2019t reply, I\u2019ll nominate you for real.]I gave her an 18-hour late reply.[What are you doing?]Through the walls, I could see Chae Nayun\u2019s smartwatch ring. But because she was crying, she didn\u2019t check her smartwatch. I sent her another message.[I saw your duel today.]Chae Nayun then glanced at her smartwatch.\u2014\u2026What does this bastard want now?It seemed she was planning on ignoring my messages. I didn\u2019t have any other choice. I sent her a message she couldn\u2019t ignore.[See, I told you. You\u2019re more suited to a sword than a bow. It\u2019s not too late to change your weapon. I did too.]\u2014This son of a\u2026It was incredibly effective. Fuming, Chae Nayun tapped on her smartwatch.[Screw off before I kill you.]The reply I sent back immediately was enough to drive her over the edge.[Come on, you defeated a Djinn with a sword, so why do you insist on using a bow? I just can\u2019t understand. It\u2019s almost\u2026 pitiful. If you fought Rachel like how you fought that Djinn, do you think you would have lost?][What? You wanna die?][Think a little. You beat her when you were in Agent Military Academy, so why do you think you\u2019re losing now? It\u2019s because you don\u2019t have the aptitude for bows.][What you piece of shit where are you do I look like a pushover you bastard don\u2019t be so arrogant just because you beat Kim Horak]Her emotional message was hardly readable because of punctuation errors. I didn\u2019t even read it all. I didn\u2019t reply to her either. I wanted to mess with her a bit more because her reaction was funny, but unfortunately, it was time.\u2014Huh? Chae Nayun?Kim Suho peeked his head behind the tree, where Chae Nayun was hiding.\u2014\u2026Eh?\u2014What are you doing here?\u2014W\u2026What!Chae Nayun quickly wiped off her tears. She then tried to run, but Kim Suho caught her.\u2014Let me go!Chae Nayun tried to shake him off, but Kim Suho wasn\u2019t the type of person who would leave a crying girl be. He had a typical main character personality. Consoling a crying girl was almost in his instincts.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s time to go.\u201dI didn\u2019t stay behind to watch what would happen between them.Making sure that Chae Nayun didn\u2019t forget about her real Gift, that was the extent of my role.**Wednesday.The next combat exam began. As cadets had to fight monsters in this exam, ordinary people were prohibited from spectating. Furthermore, because magicians\u2019 summoned monsters were of varying types and power. the exam was graded on an absolute scale rather than a relative scale.\u201cBe especially careful in today\u2019s exam. If you refuse to give up, you might really end up dying.\u201dKim Soohyuk gave a solemn warning. Just like he said, summoned monsters were dangerous. Even though they were summoned by magicians, they were unable to comprehend complex orders.\u201cAnnihilate enemies and protect allies,\u201d that was the extent of the order they could understand. An order like \u201ctest that cadet\u2019s skill\u201d was out of the question.Not to mention, summoned monsters didn\u2019t just disappear into thin air when magicians reverse summoned them, so cadets had to be on their toes even after surrendering.\u201cIf you think your life is in danger, give up immediately. You can yell \u2018I surrender\u2019 or simply tap on the ground twice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI stood still and calmly listened to Kim Soohyuk\u2019s explanation. Chae Nayun was glaring at me from the side, but I ignored her.\u201cMagicians in charge of the exam will give the rest of the explanation. Give them a warm welcome.\u201dThe door opened and robed magicians walked in.Summoner magicians weren\u2019t given any special treatment. The Magician\u2019s Tower had a strict hierarchy among magicians depending on their specialty, and summoner magicians were nothing more and nothing less than average. And because summoner magicians often worked outside of the Magician\u2019s Tower, they didn\u2019t have twisted personalities like most magicians.\u201cNice to meet you all. I am the Chief Magician, Jin Joohwa.\u201dThe leader of the magicians bowed to the cadets.\u201cToday, you will fight monsters we will summon. But be careful, summoned monsters are no different from real monsters. Even if we reverse summon them, they won\u2019t disappear immediately like in games. So if things look dangerous, surrender immediately.\u201dThe cadets nodded at the magician\u2019s kind explanation.\u201cGood. Then we will tell you how the exam will proceed.\u201dJin Joohwa smiled brightly.\u201cFour cadets will go in at a time, and each cadet will be given 15 minutes. You will not be graded based on victory or loss, and your fighting role will obviously be taken into account.\u201dJin Joohwa stuck up his index finger.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFirst is how long you last. Next is how calm you responded. In other words, you don\u2019t have to try to kill the summoned monster.\u201dWiing\u2014A smartwatch\u2019s faint vibration cut him off mid-sentence.The magician looked around the room.\u201cPlease turn off all smartwatches.\u201dHe spoke nonchalantly.We also nonchalantly turned off our smartwatches.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sudden Encounter (3)Chief Magician Jin Joohwa\u2019s explanation dragged on for a long time. How the exam will be carried out, how groups will be formed, the types of monsters that will be summoned\u2026 I understood that he was a cautious person, but I just wished he would get on with the exam already.\u201cNow, we will begin the exam. Group 1 members should stand up.\u201dFinally, he spoke the words I was waiting for.Group 1 was Hazuki, Kim Junho, Yoo Jungjin, and Spenner. Hazuki was the only one I knew.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best!\u201dHazuki got up as she received encouraging words from her friends.The four group members followed a staff to the examination ground.\u201cEveryone else, please stand to the side.\u201dThe 96 remaining cadets of Veritas class stood against the wall while wondering why. Suddenly, Jin Joohwa clapped, and ten circular tables with ten\u00a0chairs each rose up from the floor.\u201cTake a seat, everyone. You will be writing a report for this exam as well.\u201dImmediately, cadets broke out into groans.\u201cSit wherever you want.\u201dSince I already knew this would happen, I wasn\u2019t fazed by it in the slightest. I took a seat randomly, while other cadets sat close to their friends.\u201c\u2026?\u201dJust when I was thoughtlessly waiting for Jin Joohwa\u2019s next word, a sweet fragrance tickled my nose. It was a unique and aromatic smell of rose. I glanced sideways.It was Rachel. She was staring at her fingernails. It seemed one of her nails was too sharp as she took a nail clipper to one of her fingers. At that moment, her eyes met mine.Rachel hastily put away the nail clipper into her pocket.\u201cBattle analysis will be part of this exam.\u201dJin Joohwa\u2019s explanation began once again.\u201cIt\u2019s simple. You will carefully analyze cadets who are battling monsters and write a report.\u201dIn an instant, a monitor shot up from the tables. There was one for each seat, a total of a hundred.The monitor\u2019s screen was split into four, and each screen showed a cadet from the group taking the exam.\u201cHow they were able to defeat their monster, or why they lost; even if they won, in what areas they were lacking; if they lost, what methods they could have used to get a better result. This is what we are looking for in your reports.\u201dChak, chak.Jin Joohwa clapped, and the other magicians began to hand out report papers.\u201cYou have to write three reports in total, but only the best report will be reflected on your grade. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean you can only write one report. If you do, you will be penalized.\u201dI picked up the paper in front of me. Looking at the peer assessment paper, I suddenly remembered my college days. I had to write my name on the \u201cevaluating cadet\u201d line and the name of the cadet I\u2019m evaluating on \u201cevaluatee cadet.\u201d[Check the \u2018anonymous\u2019 checkbox if you wish to remain anonymous.]Thankfully, we had the option of being anonymous.\u201cFor the record, this report is only 5% of your grade. But, the reports you write will be given to the cadets you evaluate.\u201dAt these words, cadets began to exchange meaningful looks.\u201cGiving your peers healthy advice and recommendations, and encouraging honest self-development, I think these are duties of a Hero. So if you abuse the ability to be anonymous to be malicious, you will be penalized accordingly.\u201dThe chief magician\u2019s mouth curled up to a smile.\u201cIt seems we are ready. Group 1\u2019s exam will now begin.\u201dI stared at the monitor fixedly. I then clicked on the box Hazuki was in. The other three boxes disappeared, and only Hazuki\u2019s filled the screen.Hazuki was facing a ghoul, a low-intermediate rank grade 1 monster. It should be a difficult fight for Hazuki.\u2014Clang, clangThe ghoul\u2019s claws clashed with Hazuki\u2019s axe.Hazuki responded to its attacks rather calmly, but a ghoul\u2019s claws were harder than average high grade weapons. After exchanging a few blows, Hazuki must have concluded that she was at a disadvantage in close ranged combat as she began to circle around the room. Using the ghoul\u2019s slow speed to her advantage, she began to look for an opening in the ghoul\u2019s defense.But 15 minutes went by with no change.The ghoul disappeared after being reverse summoned.\u201cDraw, Hazuki and Yoo Jungjin. Victory, Spenner. Defeat, Kim Junho. Next is group 2. Chae Nayun, Hojun, Jutryn, Carlos.\u201dNext up was Chae Nayun\u2019s group.Chae Nayun walked up in an imposing manner. The weight of her bow seemed lighter than usual. Just what could Kim Suho have said to her to make her feel so energetic?I looked at Chae Nayun through the monitor.\u201cA Thousand-Mile Horse?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s opponent was the Thousand-Mile Horse, an intermediate rank grade 9 monster. It was one of the trickiest monsters for an archer to face. But in the screen, Chae Nayun stood tall with confidence in front of the Thousand-Mile Horse.Not long afterward, the battle began.Chae Nayun drew her bow, and the Thousand-Mile Horse charged towards her.I examined their fight closely. My Gift, Master Sharpshooter, seemed to affect my eyes of discernment, as I could clearly see Chae Nayun\u2019s faults.[Chae Nayun]Chae Nayun dodged the charging Thousand-Mile Horse by rolling to the side. Doing so, she had missed an opportunity to attack. She should have stabbed an arrow in its flank, or if she fired after rolling, she would have hit the horse\u2019s butt.[Chae Nayun only wants to shoot her bow in upright positions. In other words, she lacks adaptability and situational awareness as an archer.]Chae Nayun was too fixated on textbook stances. As a result, the Thousand-Mile Horse easily dodged her arrows.[In a one-on-one fight, sharpshooters require detailed analysis and background knowledge of their target. However, Chae Nayun lacks knowledge about monsters.]Defeating a Thousand-Mile Horse was easy if one started with disabling its legs. However, Chae Nayun was attacking places with a large surface area like its neck and body.\u2018She doesn\u2019t like memorizing theory.\u2019It was Chae Nayun\u2019s flaw I created myself.[Her ability to predict her opponent\u2019s movements is superb, but she lacks the ability to take her arrows\u2019 speed into account.]This was a matter of talent. Chae Nayun\u2019s talent in bows was ranked second or third. In contrast, her talent in longswords was ranked first. The spear and bow only came afterwards.In other words, Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t predict what I could predict.That was the difference between our talents, our Gifts.[Despite all this, Chae Nayun was able to win against the Thousand-Mile Horse because of her overwhelming magic power control, capacity, and adaptability.]Eventually, the Thousand-Mile Horse got tired. It couldn\u2019t withstand the endless barrage of arrows that came from Chae Nayun\u2019s terrifying magic power capacity.[Overall, I recommend that Chae Nayun find a weapon that is more suited to utilizing her immense magic power.]The exam ended with her victory.However, my report was filled with criticisms. Still, they were reasonable. If the person grading this report had sharp eyes, he would know that I was right.\u201cVictory, Chae Nayun. Defeat, Hojun, and Jutryn. Draw, Carlos.\u201dAfter the exam, Chae Nayun returned in the same imposing manner as when she had left. I didn\u2019t even give her a glance. Feeling somewhat guilty, I flipped over my report.\u201cNext is group 3\u2026\u201dThe exam thus continued.**Meanwhile, Oh Junhyuk was patrolling the west forest. The faint vibration he felt a while ago was bothering him.Normally, he would have thought of it as a natural phenomenon and ignored it, but a police officer had been killed the day before. As a result, Oh Junhyuk was currently more sensitive to his surroundings.Oong\u2014A vibration even clearer than the one he felt before rang out.\u201cYoungji, did you feel that?\u201dSeo Youngji\u2019s reply came within a second from the micro-transceiver he had.\u2014Yep, another vibration. I think it\u2019s coming from the ocean. Can you tell me exactly when you felt the vibration?\u201cHow should I know?\u201d\u2014Then just send me your smartwatch data.\u201c\u2026\u201dOh Junhyuk did as she said.\u2014I\u2019m in the east forest. The vibration was 0.03 seconds faster on your side. The source of the vibration must be in the west sea.\u201cCan I use the smartwatch to calculate the same thing?\u201d\u2014 You should be able to. It\u2019s the Association\u2019s specially crafted smartwatch. It has a lot of useful functions. Anyways, I\u2019m heading over there now. Wait for me.\u201cGot it.\u201dOh Junhyuk began to walk towards the west sea through a field of weed. Since the vibration came from the west sea, he planned to observe it from a distance.But at that moment\u2026He felt a condensing and scattering of magic power.Oh Junhyuk quickly turned to that direction.A shadowy figure was walking out from the dense forest.\u201c\u2026\u201dOh Junhyuk stared at the figure while holding his breath.Tap, tap.\u00a0With heavy steps, a man walked out\u2026 a man that he had seen before. Because of the unique aura he gave off, Oh Junhyuk remembered him.A large build and a sinister face. It was the man who was glaring at him in the arena.Oh Junhyuk\u2019s eyes met the man\u2019s. The man returned a big smile.Looking at the man, Oh Junhyuk spoke in a businesslike manner.\u201cThis area is off-limits to outsiders.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201dA fierce light shone from the man\u2019s eyes.\u201cThen why are you here?\u201dHis voice was fittingly husky and full. However, Oh Junhyuk retorted without being fazed in the slightest.\u201cBecause I\u2019m not an outsider.\u201d\u201cMm, what a surprise.\u201dThe giant man gave a dry reply as he rubbed his chin. Oh Junhyuk forced himself to smile.\u201cIf you understand, please go back.\u201d\u201cI refuse.\u201dWith a grin, the giant man suddenly began to crack his joints. He was clearly asking for a fight. Oh Junhyuk let out a deep sigh.\u201cThe one who murdered that police officer, that was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t know. Rather than that, don\u2019t just stand there.\u201dAt that moment, a chilling wind blew from the sea. Oh Junhyuk\u2019s smartwatch loudly rang at the same time.\u201cMove if you don\u2019t want to be beaten up.\u201dThe moment the giant man\u2019s voice fell low\u2026Chwaa\u2014From the depths of the sea, a giant creature shot up with a burst of water. Oh Junhyuk quickly turned around.The creature looked like a generic snake, but its overwhelming size and vicious mouth showed that it was on a league of its own.Serpent Dragon.A mythical monster had appeared on the west sea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sudden Encounter (4)\u201cWow~ I wonder if I got some sort of an insight. Who knew I could win against a Thousand-Mile Horse so easily?\u201dTired of waiting, I was looking at my laptop when Chae Nayun\u2019s bragging sound entered my ears.\u201cReally, what happened, Nayun?\u201dYoo Yeonha also chimed in from next to her. Although Yoo Yeonha usually lowered her head in front of Chae Nayun, her genuinely surprised expression told me that it wasn\u2019t just flattery this time.It was understandable. Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t know anything about bows, so Chae Nayun\u2019s battle might have seemed unproblematic. At first glance, it was indeed an amazing fight. But just like the saying, one shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201cI learned from failure, something like that, hahaha.\u201dChae Nayun made a hearty laugh. She must be feeling great, seeing as how she even brought up her loss from yesterday. Meanwhile, Kim Suho was smiling sweetly as he watched Chae Nayun.As for me, I felt a chill run down my back when I imagined Chae Nayun reading my report. Should I submit it anonymously?\u201cGroup 10. Rachel, Kim Hajin, Skid, Lee Wei.\u201dAt that moment, Jin Joohwa announced the 10th group. I glanced at Rachel, who was sitting next to me. She seemed to have me on her mind as well, as her eyes met mine. She got up from her seat, and I followed.\u201cCome this way.\u201dRachel and I followed a staff with the rest of group 10\u2019s members.We arrived at a waiting room, and the staff opened a giant door on its right side.\u201cGo in.\u201dBehind the giant door was a long hallway.We walked in. Soon, the hallway came to an end, and two doors stood on each side of the wall.\u201cStand in front of the door.\u201dThe staff guided us to a door each. I was on the same side of the wall as Rachel.\u201cGood luck on your exam!\u201dI gave Rachel an energetic cheer, and she returned a nod.\u201cYou have one minute to confirm your monster and terrain.\u201dBeyond the window on the door, I could see the monster and terrain I would face.The terrain was flatland. The monster was a Chrome Wolf.Chrome wolves were monsters that ranged from low-intermediate rank grade 4 to grade 2. It was comparatively weaker than what some of the other cadets had to face.However, it was difficult to fight it with a gun. Not just difficult, but very difficult. Anyone could see at first glance that bullets would just bounce off its skin.[Peculiarity \u2013 its skin has the ability to reflect metallic objects.][Weakness \u2013 inside the mouth][Strength \u2013 powerful epidermis]Chrome Wolves were monsters I created.\u201c30 seconds left.\u201dThey had the metal and earth dual-attribute, and its vital point was inside its mouth. While the combination of metal and earth attribute made it difficult to deal with, its weakness was unexpectedly clear. An extreme heat that could melt metal and earth, that was what I needed.I grasped the knife in my pocket. When things came down to it, I could use Stigma\u2019s magic power to heat up the knife.\u201cA minute has passed. Please enter.\u201dThe members of group 10 walked into the examination ground.It was a small room of about 130 square meters. Dirt and rocks filled the ground, while a wolf was crunching on something on the other side.I barely had any time to think. Chrome Wolves were capable of long ranged attacks.I quickly held up my gun. Ptui. The wolf spat something out. What seemed to be a metallic fragment hurled towards me. I aimed at the flying object and fired. The metallic fragment clashed with my bullet, destroying each other.It charged towards me immediately afterward. I activated Bullet Time. I could clearly see the wolf\u2019s slowed movements, but I didn\u2019t move. I simply waited for it to open its mouth. Because it was so slow, I wasn\u2019t even scared.As though it was moving in slow motion, the Chrome Wolf opened its jaws as it shot towards my neck.I jabbed my gun into its mouth and fired consecutively. By the time the Chrome Wolf shut its mouth, I had already jumped back by several meters.My sense of time returned to normal, and the Chrome Wolf convulsed in pain.Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t dead yet. After retching a few times, it spat out ten crushed bullets. Then, he growled while glaring at me.\u201cTough, aren\u2019t you?\u201dI had struck its vital point, but the Chrome Wolf\u2019s bulletproof property put me at a disadvantage. Without a choice, I took out my knife. With a gun in one hand and a knife in the other, I lowered my body slightly and glared back at the wolf. My lips were dry and sweat drenched my body. Close ranged combat was always frightening.Right when the fight was about to break out\u2026KWANG\u2014!A huge explosion erupted and the lights in the room went off.I was now in total darkness, but I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. There was a savage beast in here with me.\u2014A problem has occurred. All monsters will be reverse summoned. Cadets are to leave the examination ground immedi\u2026Tzzzk.The speaker cut off with a static noise.I stared at the wolf. Rather than being reverse summoned, it was growing even more ferocious.\u201cUm, is that thing going to be reverse summoned?\u201dNo one answered my question.One or more of the dispatched magicians had to be a Djinn.Jin Joohwa wasn\u2019t a Djinn. I had already checked on my laptop. No change in setting had happened to him. In fact, the laptop didn\u2019t detect any setting change.This could only mean one thing.The Djinn deployed here was a Djinn I didn\u2019t know.It was entirely plausible. There were uncountably many Djinns in this world. It wasn\u2019t strange for an extra to appear.\u201cHaa\u2026 I knew this would happen eventually.\u201dAn event that I didn\u2019t know about was happening.My heart rate went up at the uncertainty of the situation, but I forced myself to calm down. After a deep breath, I looked through the wall at the room next door. Rachel seemed to be in a similar situation, as she was glaring at her opponent calmly and silently. But her opponent was\u2026 a person.\u2014Kuwalwal!At that moment, the Chrome Wolf charged towards me with a howl. I took out my personal weapon from Stigma. Desert Eagle materialized in my hand, and Aether fused with it promptly.The grip fits snugly in my hand.First, I fired a bullet at the charging Chrome Wolf. It fell down with a whimper.\u201cKnow your place.\u201dThe Desert Eagle I had taken out for the first time in a while was much more powerful than before, but I didn\u2019t have the time to stand around and admire its strength. I didn\u2019t even have time to look at my laptop.Rachel was the urgent problem at hand.There were arcs where Rachel was targeted. One of the antagonists of the story was someone who wanted to conquer England itself.But now shouldn\u2019t be the time. They should only attack after they grew their forces more\u2026\u2014Krrrr\u2026I furrowed my brows at the growling noise. When I turned my sight back front, the single Chrome Wolf had unknowingly multiplied to three.But I wasn\u2019t worried in the slightest.\u201cHm.\u201dI transformed Desert Eagle into the shotgun mode.At the same time, the three Chrome Wolves flew towards me.My job was simple.I just had to point my shotgun calmly and fire without shaking.KWANG\u2014!Immediately, thunderous gunshots rang out.**In a dark room filled with chilling air and breathless killing intent, a lone man\u2019s murmuring rose up coldly.\u201cI knew this day would come one day.\u201dWhat should have been a familiar language approached Rachel unfamiliarly. She glared at the man who appeared from the darkness. Although the man was wearing a cape and covering his face, Rachel felt like she knew who he was.Rachel calmly recited his name.\u201c\u2026Sir Lancaster.\u201dThe previous Captain of the Royal Guard and Rachel\u2019s previous master, Alex Lancaster.The man who disappeared a few years ago after his family was murdered in the infamous London Incident had appeared once again with breathtaking killing intent.\u201cI\u2019m honored you remember me.\u201dA thin smile emerged on his face. Rachel felt a great malice from his sinister smile. From it, she could easily see the path he had walked.\u201c\u2026You sold your soul.\u201dLancaster shook his head. He was denying Rachel\u2019s claim.\u201cI lived my life for my country, but my country killed my everything. I didn\u2019t sell my soul. Only, my master took in my wandering soul after I was abandoned by my country.\u201dFor a moment, deep sadness emerged on Rachel\u2019s face. What Lancaster was saying was a painful memory for her as well.\u201c\u2026Is that why you came to me?\u201d\u201cPrincess, does it look like I came here?\u201dRachel furrowed her brows. Then, she stabbed with her rapier, which simply passed through his body.\u201cI am somewhere, but not here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRachel turned around. The door to the room was tightly shut. For whatever reason, no help seemed to be coming.Lancaster spoke with a smile.\u201cThere\u2019s quite a chaos outside right now. Of course, if this place was England, Princess\u2019 safety would have been the top priority. Tens, hundreds, and thousands of people\u2019s lives wouldn\u2019t compare to Princess\u2019\u2026\u201dLancaster paused momentarily. His smiling face was twisted viciously.\u201cThe entire country would not hesitate to throw away their lives to save Princess. After all, Princess is England\u2019s only hope.\u201dAfter saying what he wanted to say, Lancaster\u2019s mouth drew a satisfied smile.\u201cBut that isn\u2019t the case here. In this place, you are only one of many cadets.\u201dRachel stared at him with sadness. The resentment and anger in his voice made Rachel feel guilty. However, Lancaster clenched his teeth at her response.\u201cSo you still won\u2019t remove your hypocritical mask of pretense\u2026\u201dAnger and regret filled his drawn out words. Rachel took a small courageous step towards him.\u201cSir Lancaster\u2026\u201d\u201cI would like to talk a bit longer, but there is no time.\u201dHowever, Lancaster rejected her before bowing respectfully.\u201cFairwell Princess, please be well.\u201dWith that, he turned into a black fog and disappeared.\u201cWait\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, an assassin jumped out of the fog, swinging a sword. Though it was abrupt, Rachel managed to swing her rapier and defend against the attack. At the same time, the attack sliced off a chunk of her sword qi. She was astonished at the weight behind the magic power.But the assassin\u2019s magic power wasn\u2019t the only astonishing thing.The assassin\u2019s movements were nimble and sharp. Left flank and shoulder. His keen attacks dug through Rachel\u2019s weak points. Two swords clashed against each other, and a sharp metallic sound resounded. Hot sparks were ignited, and fresh blood burst into the air.Against the assassin\u2019s aggressive maneuvers, Rachel could only stay on the defensive. But as the fight continued, more scratches appeared on her body. Once the pain grew more intense, Rachel had to admit that she couldn\u2019t defeat the assassin with standard tactics.She made a gamble.\u201cUk!\u201dThe assassin didn\u2019t miss the opening she purposely made. A deep stab appeared on her wrist, and Rachel dropped her rapier. Feeling his victory, the assassin dug in deeper.At that moment, Rachel\u2019s rapier reacted. Her rapier had still been connected to her magic power.The assassin moved to pierce Rachel\u2019s heart, while Rachel\u2019s rapier shot up towards his neck.KWANG\u2014!However, this nail-biting situation was interrupted by a terrifying vibration and a fierce explosion.Rachel lost balance along with the assassin. The assassin\u2019s sword couldn\u2019t reach Rachel\u2019s heart, while Rachel\u2019s rapier couldn\u2019t pierce the assassin\u2019s neck.KOONG!The room rumbled with another vibration. This time, the right side of the wall crumbled down. Rachel and the assassin both turned towards the wall.KOONG!Another shockwave seemed to tear through the wall. The assassin then held up his sword, and Rachel also grabbed her rapier with her left hand.KOONG!After the second shockwave, the assassin charged at Rachel, which she narrowly dodged by rolling to the side.KOONG!A third and final shockwave blew up the wall and the assassin was sent flying back by the explosion.\u201cGeez, so much dust. Ptui.\u201dA man walked out from a cloud of acrid smoke.It was a familiar face to Rachel.Kim Hajin. It was him.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe assassin immediately ran towards him.\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euKim Hajin simply fired his gun.\u201cKuak!\u201dA shotgun shell sent the assassin flying back from one end of the room to the other. It was a terrifying display of power.Kim Hajin then walked up to the assassin, who was stuck against the wall.Click\u2014 Click\u2014The sound of his gun reloading rang out frighteningly.Clack.\u00a0He finished reloading. Rachel stared at the white magic power flowing around his arm. However, she didn\u2019t have the chance to raise any questions.Kim Hajin aimed at the assassin. He showed no hesitation as he pulled the trigger.In an instant, a radiant white light illuminated the dark room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the Trouble (1)\u2018Destructive power amplification shotgun shell\u2019 \u2013 50 SP each.Although I used ordinary bullets against Chrome Wolves, I used five of these special bullets to break down the wall and kill the assassin. In other words, I had consumed 250 SP in less than a minute. It was a necessary expenditure to break down the examination room\u2019s wall, and since I managed to save Rachel, I didn\u2019t particularly regret it.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI reached out to Rachel, who was collapsed on the ground. She stared at my hand blankly before getting up by herself. I pulled my hand back and awkwardly scratched my cheek.\u201c\u2026\u201dRachel stared at the broken down wall to her right. The examination room\u2019s reinforced wall was in a sorry state because of my shotgun shells.\u201cOh, the mana barrier disappeared when the electricity went out.\u201dI made an excuse because her gaze pricked at my conscience.Rachel\u2019s eyes rolled and landed on my shotgun. I hurriedly stuffed it in my bag, but it didn\u2019t fit because of its size. I quickly turned around and changed it to its handgun form before putting it away.\u201cR-Rather than that\u2026\u201dI looked at Rachel\u2019s body. She was riddled with wounds, and she was bleeding to a worrying degree.I should be concerned about her safety, but for some reason, I thought of Evandel\u2019s Seed first. Rachel\u2019s blood would be the perfect nourishment for it.\u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201dI took off the belt bag around my waist. To give a brief explanation about this belt bag, it was an all-purpose emergency kit created with the combination of all my fears and apprehension.Antidotes, potions, painkillers, tranquilizers, bandages, gauzes\u2026 all sorts of medicine and medicinal supplies were in this bag. Of course, recovery potions, namely the \u2018external wound recovery potion\u2019, were also included in it.Although recovery potions were a bit on the expensive side, they were cheap compared to what Rachel\u2019s blood was worth.\u201cHere, it\u2019s an external wound recovery potion.\u201dWhen I gave her a glass bottle containing a red liquid, Rachel\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cBefore I put it on, I\u2019ll wipe off your blood first.\u201dBecause I was nervous, I felt my lips going dry. I wet my lips with saliva before asking, \u201cMay I?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel nodded. She had given me permission.First, I took out a gauze from my belt bag and wiped the blood flowing down from her wounded left arm. As I took out more gauzes, I kept the used ones stacked on top of each other without throwing them away. Once her arm was mostly clean of blood, I wet a gauze with the potion before applying it to her skin.Immediately, Rachel clenched her teeth. Potions had a stinging sensation when applied over the skin, kind of like antiseptics.I planned to heal her left arm first, but Rachel suddenly grabbed me.She spoke for the first time since we met.\u201c\u2026Here first.\u201dWith that, she showed me her right wrist.It was a serious wound. Her flesh and muscles were cut off entirely and her bones were showing. If the cut was just slightly deeper, her wrist would have been severed. But surprisingly, there was no blood coming out of the wound. It seemed Rachel was blocking the wound with her magic power.\u201cAh! You should have told me earlier!\u201dI was genuinely shocked. She seemed to have only suffered light cuts and scratches, so I was focused on her blood and missed that she had a wound that needed immediate treatment.\u201cAny later and you would have had to give up on using a rapier forever.\u201dDespite costing 7 million won, external wound recovery potions weren\u2019t omnipotent. Sensitive areas like a person\u2019s nerves had to be treated immediately. Otherwise, not even the Authority of Healing could do anything about it.\u201cIt\u2019s going to sting. A lot.\u201dI poured the rest of the potion over her wound and wrapped a bandage over it.\u201cAaak.\u201dThe pain must have been intense, but Rachel endured it with only a short groan. I put three layers of bandages over her wound. With this, the treatment was complete.When I let go of her arm, Rachel crouched down on the ground and rolled her feet. It was easy to see that she was struggling to endure the pain.I picked up the bloodied stack of gauzes and put them into my cross bag.While I waited for Rachel to recover, I turned on my laptop. A settings change alert was there as I expected.[Lancaster Alex][Worsened attachment to his lost family. His rage has also been deepened. There is an increased chance of him attacking Rachel whenever he has the opportunity.][Potential changed from 7.5 to 8.5 to serve as a greater threat.]\u201cHm\u2026.\u201dLancaster Alex.He was one of the characters I created in relation to England. As an antagonist who appeared in the middle stage of the story, his goal was to topple England\u2019s government.Such a dangerous antagonist had gotten stronger and appeared earlier than intended. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it.If I knew this would happen, I would have created more righteous characters.Of course, there were plenty of other righteous characters. For Rachel, there was a secret service agent from MI6 named James Jone. As he was based on the \u2018agent\u2019 that everyone knew, his love and loyalty for his country was unshakable.\u201c\u2026Hua.\u201dA faint breathing sound rang out. I looked at Rachel. She was covered in sweat, but she must have overcome the pain, as she looked much better than before.Rachel staggered up slowly and bowed at me.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSuddenly, electricity came back on and the darkness shrouding the room disappeared. Naturally, our conversation was put on hold.Rachel and I walked to the door.Holding the doorknob, we slowly pushed it open. Though it was tightly shut before, it opened without a problem this time.After leaving the room, I stared at the examination rooms on the other side of the wall. It seemed the other two cadets were unable to escape in time, as their corpses were lying on the ground.A mixed feeling came over me, but I knew I couldn\u2019t have done anything about it.I led Rachel and began to walk back. With my eyes, I could see that the waiting room was in a pandemonium.Tap, tap.At that moment, I heard the sound of someone walking towards us. Rachel put up her guard. Seeing her, I simply smiled.\u201cThankfully, we restored the electricity\u2026\u201dIt was Kim Soohyuk\u2019s voice. He was walking down the hallway while communicating with someone on a transceiver.\u201cYou guys, what are you doing here? No, why did you come back here?\u201d\u201cCome back?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you guys\u2026\u201dKim Soohyuk paused in the middle of his sentence as though he\u2019d remembered something. From his reaction, I also had an idea as to what happened. Djinns who could create illusions with form surely existed.\u201cThe other two are still inside.\u201d\u201cAh, shoot! You two, wait here. No, run to the infirmary!\u201dWith that, Kim Soohyuk ran down the hallway to the examination rooms. By the time his back disappeared from my normal view, I turned towards Rachel. Then, I whispered softly.\u201cUm, I may have to lie soon, so when the time comes, please match words with me. If they find out that I brought in my personal weapon, I\u2019ll be expelled.\u201dRachel nodded at my request.**\u2026After the huge disturbance, in the silent shadow of the now empty waiting room, darkness suddenly sprung up, growing in size until it formed a human figure.The figure was that of a short cute boy.A deep smile emerged on the boy\u2019s face.\u201cBoss, Boss! I just saw something amazing!\u201dThe boy, Droon, came to observe Kim Hajin as per his boss\u2019 orders. Currently, he couldn\u2019t hide his excitement over what he saw. He seemed to finally understand why Boss was so interested in him.\u201cGuns, it\u2019s a Gift related to guns. It\u2019s not just anti-magic\u2026\u201d\u2014For now, return. I\u2019ll listen to you later.However, Boss cut him off coldly.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u2018Boss is no fun.\u2019 Droon grumbled inwardly as he transformed into darkness once again. Next, he messaged another troupe member.\u2014Jungyeong, how was the Serpent Dragon? Did you kill it?**Facing a clear ocean breeze, Oh Junhyuk was sitting cross-legged on a rock. He was still trying to comprehend what he just witnessed. A Serpent Dragon had popped out of the sea, but\u2026\u201cOh Junhyuk!\u201dSeo Youngji arrived after everything was taken care of. Oh Junhyuk turned towards her.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Didn\u2019t you say a Serpent Dragon appeared?\u201d\u201cYou knew that and you\u2019re this late?\u201d\u201cI ran into a problem on my way here. Monsters suddenly escaped from the laboratory\u2026. I had to take care of it before coming here. So, where\u2019s the Serpent Dragon?\u201d\u201cIt was chased away, deep into the ocean.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dSerpent Dragons were members of the dragon family, but that didn\u2019t mean they were terrifyingly strong. In terms of the Association\u2019s standard ranking system, Serpent Dragons ranged from high-intermediate rank grade 1 to high-rank grade 7. Compared to some of the other monsters Heroes of their caliber had to face, Serpent Dragons weren\u2019t particularly frightening. In the first place, Serpent Dragons weren\u2019t aggressive. They didn\u2019t know how to fight, and because of their intelligence, they were afraid of pain.Of course, it was a different story if a Serpent Dragon found a Cintamani[1].Even so, what Oh Junhyuk witnessed was shockingly unrealistic.\u201cSomeone provoked the Serpent Dragon.\u201d\u201cProvoked?\u201d\u201cYep. Its eyes were red. It was clearly enraged.\u201dHurling down from the sky with its gigantic mouth, the Serpent Dragon was undoubtedly oppressing.\u201cHow did you chase away an enraged Serpent Dragon?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThinking back to what happened, Oh Junhyuk didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cApparently, you just have to beat it until it regains its sanity.\u201dHe recalled what he saw just ten minutes ago.The giant man wearing a gauntlet stood in front of the Serpent Dragon and punched it. It was a simple straight punch, but the shockwave released from the attack was tremendous. The ground shook and trees were completely stripped of their leaves. The punch tore through the Serpent Dragon\u2019s tough scales, broke through its bones, and struck its muscles.The enraged Serpent Dragon\u2019s bloodshot eyes instantly cleared up.\u201c\u2026You want me to believe that?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t. Oh, by the way, I need you to put someone on the wanted list. I filmed him on my smartwatch. He\u2019s the suspect behind yesterday\u2019s police officer murder case.\u201dOh Junhyuk sent Seo Youngji a video. It showed the giant man\u2019s face and build. Seo Youngji tilted her head as she checked the video.\u201cTell them to contact me if he\u2019s found.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cNothing. It\u2019s been a while, but I found someone I want to fight.\u201dOh Junhyuk grinned.**The Cube Monster Incident became a hot topic across the world.Djinns being involved in the incident was kept under wraps, but because a Serpent Dragon and several other monsters critically injured two cadets (I thought they were dead, but it seemed they were just unconscious), Cube received a huge global backlash.As a result, the rest of the combat exams were put on hold.The result of the duels would be kept, while another monster war would take place later. Finally, the group rescue mission, which was planned for Friday, was canceled entirely considering the circumstance.In addition, classes were also canceled until Thursday two weeks later.In other words, there were no classes for the next ten days.With the sudden holiday, cadets seemed to be planning on returning home or going on vacation with the compensation Cube gave out.Cube\u2019s official community forum was filled with posts asking for good places to visit in Japan or America, while some people left snarky remarks on how they could go on vacation when cadets were injured from the incident.In any case, none of these problems had any relevance to me.Even now, I was sitting in my dorm room, protecting my abode.\u201c\u2026Oh, did it just eat?\u201dEvandel\u2019s Seed. The seed of a witch I obtained from Gari Mountain\u2019s hidden stage was now sucking on Rachel\u2019s blood. The bloodied gauze had returned to its white color.Once three months passed, a kind witch would be born, who would become my trusted helper\u2026At that moment, a sudden pain overcame me.The source of the pain was my upper arm. It was a pain I felt once before. I quickly pulled up my sleeve. Another streak of Stigma was being drawn on my arm.\u2018Calm down and be patient, Kim Hajin. You\u2019ve felt this pain before. You can do a lot more with another streak of Stigma. For example, you can put more magic power\u2026 into bullets\u2026\u2019I couldn\u2019t continue my encouraging train of thoughts as it felt like someone was stabbing my brain with a knife. My thoughts cut off, and I clenched my teeth, unable to scream.In front of this tremendous pain, my consciousness slowly faded.**\u201cWow, it\u2019s been so long.\u201dOn the other hand, Chae Nayun returned home. Her family home was a traditional Korean house with tiled rooves and eaves. However, that was only on the outside. The interior of the house was large and elaborate and was no different than a European castle.\u201cWelcome back, young lady.\u201dWith a warm smile, a butler greeted Chae Nayun.\u201cLong time no see, gramps.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been worried sick. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d\u201cOnly two people were hurt. None of the ordinary visitors were injured either.\u201dChae Nayun gave her bow to the butler who had been protecting her home for thirty years.\u201cOh right, is the item I ordered here yet?\u201d\u201cIt arrived yesterday.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOh and Cube sent some documents.\u201d\u201cDocuments?\u201dThe butler nodded.\u201cYes, they\u2019re apparently exam reports. There are 24 of them.\u201d\u201cOh that. Send it back to my dorm. I don\u2019t want to think about school when I\u2019m\u2026 No, wait.\u201dChae Nayun recalled her might as she fought the Thousand-Mile Horse.Other cadets must have been extremely impressed to have sent so many reports. 24. That meant close to 25% of the class had written about her feat.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuhu, send it to my room. I want to read it.\u201dWondering what kind of praises she would get, Chae Nayun spoke.\u201cYes, understood.\u201dThe butler bowed respectfully.1. A wish-fulfilling jewel in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Wingless dragons would seek to obtain this object to gain wings and ascend to the Heaven.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the Trouble (2)As expected of a rich young lady, Chae Nayun\u2019s room was huge with a queen-sized bed, a living room, a bathroom that was the size of a public bath, and a gaming room designed for the best virtual gaming experience. Lying comfortably on her bed, Chae Nayun opened the envelope containing her exam reports.\u201cWhoa, look how thick this is.\u201dThe stack of 24 papers had a sizable thickness.First, she read the name of the topmost paper\u2019s grader.Kianu Jin.He was a spearman who was around rank 100.[Chae Nayun\u2019s archery skill was extraordinary and her magic power drew out my deepest respect.The Thousand-Mile Horse is a difficult opponent for most sharpshooters because of its agile speed and sturdy body, but Chae Nayun not only dodged its charges with incredibly nimble movements, but she also\u2026]\u201cHaha.\u201dBecause he still had poor Korean, there were some grammar mistakes here and there, but it was still readable. She especially liked the words, \u201cher arrows were like a drizzling rain.\u201dAfter reading Kianu Jin\u2019s report, Chae Nayun worked her way down the stack.Some cadets objectively analyzed her battle, while some noticeably filled their reports with praises. But seeing them all remark on her astounding might, the corner of Chae Nayun\u2019s mouth curled up more and more.\u201cHuu, no.\u201dChae Nayun collected her thoughts before they reached cloud nine.\u2018Some of them are just flattering you. Be humble.\u2019After telling herself that, she calmly moved on to the next report.The report belonged to a familiar name.[Evaluating cadet \u2013 Kim Suho]\u201c\u2026\u201dHis name shook her heart slightly, but Chae Nayun tried to act unconcerned and furrowed her brows chicly. She quietly read the contents of the report.[It was a victory of self-conviction.Recently, Chae Nayun seemed to have doubts about herself. Losing to a rival and being criticized by someone wore down her confidence.But as expected, Chae Nayun was a born archer who was overflowing with talent.Against the Thousand-Mile Horse, Chae Nayun showed a battle brimming with confidence. There were no hesitation or doubts in her movements, and her attacks were also on point.I believe Chae Nayun has already reached a certain realm as an archer. She told me that someone said her talent was lacking, but what Chae Nayun lacked wasn\u2019t talent, but trust in her own abilities.\u2026\u2026If she continues to trust in herself as she did today, if she believes in her talent and strides forward, I have the utmost belief that she will become the greatest Hero.]\u201c\u2026Huua.\u201dWith a thin breath, Chae Nayun softly caressed Kim Suho\u2019s report. She was moved by his heartfelt encouragement. A smile emerged on her face, and her worries and trembling heart settled down.With her eyes closed, she reaffirmed her belief.\u2018A bow suits me. No matter what anyone says, a bow suits me best.\u2019Chae Nayun carefully placed his report on her bed.Now, there were two reports remaining. One was anonymous while the other was from Shin Jonghak.She decided to finish what she started.First, the anonymous report.\u201cHm.\u201dShe picked up the report without much thought.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut not long afterward, she clenched her hands which were holding onto the report. Beyond the crumpled report, Chae Nayun\u2019s distorted face emerged.\u201cIiik, iii, iiik\u2026\u201dUnlike the others, the anonymous report was filled with criticisms. Its malicious words seemed to strike at her bones directly, and Chae Nayun trembled in anger.\u201c\u2026Who is the fucker.\u201dThe report was written in a respectful tone, but it was clear what it was trying to say.\u2018You have no sense, talent, or brain. You won thanks to your magic power.\u2019It was anonymous, but Chae Nayun felt like she knew who the writer was.\u201cKim Hajin, Kim Hajin, Kim Hajin\u2026!\u201dShe picked up her smartwatch as she fumed with rage.**On a fine afternoon, Rachel and I were being questioned by Cube\u2019s investigators.I was still sore from the added streak of Stigma yesterday, but I still cooperated earnestly thanks to Rachel sitting next to me in an upright position.\u201cThank you.\u201dOutside of the investigation room, on our way back to the Portal Station, I expressed my gratitude at Rachel. As promised, she matched words with me. A royalty\u2019s words must have carried unquestionable trust and grace, as the investigators who were doubting me fully trusted Rachel\u2019s words.\u201cNo, I should be the one to thank you.\u201dRachel said so without a change in her expression. Then, she showed her wrist to me. Thanks to treating her injury early, her wrist was fully healed without a scar.\u201cIs it fine?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe spun her wrist nimbly.\u201cThat\u2019s good. So, where are you going?\u201d\u201cBack home.\u201d\u201cAh, to England.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI see, so she was going back to England.It made sense. England should be safer than Cube. The Queen\u2019s residence was a fortress that even a manifested devil couldn\u2019t easily enter.\u201cAh, I\u2019m also going hunting right now\u2026\u201dBecause we were going in the same direction, I told Rachel something she didn\u2019t even ask for when suddenly, my smartwatch rang.It wasn\u2019t a text message, but a call.From Chae Nayun.I had a feeling I shouldn\u2019t pick it up, so I ignored it.\u201cI\u2019m also taking Cube\u2019s Portal, so\u2026\u201dMy smartwatch rang once again. I immediately ended the call.Then, a message arrived.[Hey, you wrote that report, didn\u2019t you?][I just don\u2019t understand, just how are you in any position to say something like this?][I don\u2019t have the sense or talent of an archer? Have you ever used a bow before? I\u2019m so freaking speechless.][And you said I\u2019m stupid? What, you think you can mock me because you\u2019re good at studying?][You wanna fight? Wanna make a bet? Want me to teach you how hard it is to use a bow?]\u201cWhat is this bombshell\u2026\u201dA barrage of five messages fell on me in just ten seconds.However, the last message caught my attention.Bet.I recalled my Gift\u2019s proficiency level. If I remember correctly, it should be grade 7 and about 67% to the next grade.Could I defeat Chae Nayun with a bow?Of course, I purposely nitpicked her flaws during the exam, but Chae Nayun\u2019s archery skill was undoubtedly one of the best among cadets.Although she was more talented with swords, that didn\u2019t mean she had no talent for bows. Not to mention, she trained in archery for ten years\u2026[Sure, let\u2019s fight and bet on it. I\u2019ll also use a bow.]But it was about time to show her the difference between someone of talent and a true genius.Even if grade 7 wasn\u2019t enough, I had incredible luck on my side. As long as the bet was done with normal arrows rather than magic power arrows, I couldn\u2019t see myself losing.\u2026But just in case, I should ask for a month to practice.\u201c\u2026Why isn\u2019t she replying?\u201dFor some reason, Chae Nayun stopped messaging me. Did she think it was meaningless to make a bet with someone who wasn\u2019t an archer?Looking up, I saw that Rachel had gone ahead. I quickly ran and caught up to her.Rachel glanced back at me.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m also using the Portal. I\u2019m going to Wonju.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, yes.\u201dWe walked side by side to the Portal without talking.We eventually arrived at the Cube Portal Station, which was fairly empty. Because Cube had asked the cadets to leave if possible for a more thorough investigation, most cadets had already left.Rachel should now take the Seoul Portal to transit through to England, while I\u2019d take the Portal to Wonju.\u201cUm, if it\u2019s okay\u2026 can I ask you what weapon you used back then?\u201dBut before we separated, Rachel asked me a question.It seemed she found it hard to accept what happened. After all, an assassin who had been threatening her was killed with only two shotgun shots.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s an extremely expensive weapon, and cadets generally have one or more special abilities.\u201dThat was all I could say.Rachel stared at me fixedly before nodding.\u201cThank you again. I\u2019ll bring something back from England as thanks.\u201dWith that, Rachel left towards the Seoul Portal.**I arrived in Gangwondo Wonju. Perhaps because it was midday on a weekday, the Portal Station was bustling with people to the point there was barely any space to breathe.I plowed through the swarm of people and left the Portal Station.\u201cHajin~ Here!\u201dWhen I came outside, a man in a well-tailored suit and sunglasses shouted my name. It was Park Soohyuk. Next to him was an HUV, though it was an old model.He looked completely different.I approached him with a smile.\u201cWow, I almost didn\u2019t notice you. Looks like you had fun with my money. Maybe you should be investigated for embezzlement.\u201d\u201cHaha, this is a proper business expense. Get in.\u201dPark Soohyuk opened the back door as though he had done it a thousand times before.I got in the car.\u201cAre we stopping at the 1km mark again?\u201d\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re going to hunt a lot more today.\u201d\u201cGreat, then I\u2019m going~\u201dYoo Yeonha promised me an unlimited supply of bullets. Since I added a setting to the Desert Eagle to make it an evolving weapon, I had to hunt as many monsters as I could when I had time.\u201cSo, how\u2019s the business lately?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much better thanks to you. Everything is easier with a car.\u201dA mode of transportation was an important core item in any business. For a monster hunting agency, an HUV was practically a necessity.\u201cIt\u2019s over there, but there are a lot of people already.\u201dNot long afterward, we arrived at the entrance of the Field.\u201cLet\u2019s get off for now.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dTo get a permit for our vehicle, Park Soohyuk and I got off.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dBut in the distance, I saw a familiar face.In all honesty, she was eye-catching no matter where she went. Her long black hair fluttered in the air and shone under the sunlight. Her incredibly charming black dress made her stand out even in this sea of people.Yoo Yeonha.She was observing the Field, surrounded by people who I presumed to be her guild members. The serious expression she had as she spoke made her seem as though she was an adult.\u201cOh right.\u201dI suddenly recalled that it was about time Yoo Yeonha came to the Wonju\u2019s Field for business.In the original story, she became the greatest investor for SH Agency. Kim Suho was obviously the reason. After finding out that Kim Suho had a contract with SH Agency, Yoo Yeonha invested an astronomical sum to SH Agency, which turned out to be incredibly successful. It was the point where Park Soohyuk and Yoo Yeonha began to walk the royal road.\u201cWhat, do you know her?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 I do, but let\u2019s just go.\u201dShe seemed busy, so I pretended not to see her.But at that moment\u2026\u201cEh?\u201dYoo Yeonha discovered me.\u201cHello?\u201dClack, clack. She approached me on her high heels, but the height of her heels was too threatening. She seemed taller than me.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dYoo Yeonha looked into my eyes and asked. We were at the same eye-level.\u201cI\u2019m here to make money.\u201d\u201cMmm~ I see.\u201dYoo Yeonha glanced at Park Soohyuk who was next to me.It felt like I needed to introduce them to each other, so I did.\u201cThis is my agent.\u201d\u201cAh, nice to meet you. I\u2019m SH Agency\u2019s head manager, Park Soohyuk.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Yoo Yeonha. I\u2019m still a cadet.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dI stole a peek at the two of them.Park Soohyuk and Yoo Yeonha.Though it wasn\u2019t my intention, their meeting was moved forward by three years. As for the consequences, I wasn\u2019t sure. But it didn\u2019t seem like a bad thing.I also glanced at the four men standing behind Yoo Yeonha like guards. Their equipment were all high-class goods.\u201cAh, they\u2019re members of Essence of the Strait.\u201dYoo Yeonha introduced them to us. The members stood around, not knowing how to react, but Yoo Yeonha\u2019s stinging glare immediately caused them to bow.\u201cEssence of the Strait\u2026?\u201dDisbelief emerged on Park Soohyuk\u2019s face. Essence of the Strait was the rank 2 guild. Park Soohyuk must never have imagined being in contact with them.Wiing\u2014At that moment, my smartwatch rang.It was from Chae Nayun.[Haa, what would I gain by betting with someone who doesn\u2019t know anything about bows? Just screw off.]It seemed she was planning on ignoring me, but I couldn\u2019t let that happen.I kindled her rage.[What, you\u2019re scared?][Ha. You wanna die? I was going easy on you, so don\u2019t you\u2026][Just like you said, I\u2019ve never even touched a bow before. But if it\u2019s you\u2026 one month. One month is enough for me to catch up to your level. Of course, that\u2019s strictly in archery.]After sending the message, I crossed my arms.But suddenly, Yoo Yeonha asked.\u201c\u2026Are you perhaps texting Nayun?\u201dStartled, I stared at her.\u201cW-What, how did you know?\u201dWasn\u2019t I the only one capable of hacking into others\u2019 smartwatches?Yoo Yeonha grinned and put up a hologram of her smartwatch screen.[Hey, look what this kid is saying to me. I\u2019m speechless. S.P.E.E.C.H.L.E.S.S. Do I take on this bet?]From the looks of it, Chae Nayun was telling her friends about what I said and asking them for advice.\u201cAha.\u201dI spoke shortly.\u201cTell her to do it.\u201d\u201cEh? Have you used a bow before?\u201d\u201cNope, not even once.\u201dI haven\u2019t even touched one. In fact, before coming to this world, I haven\u2019t even seen them outside of movies and the Olympics.\u201cBut I only need a month to beat her.\u201dHowever, this was a contest of pure skill. My Master Sharpshooter Gift was specialized for the sharpshooter role, while Chae Nayun\u2019s Gift didn\u2019t directly support a role and was more relevant to swords.Although grade 7 was a bit on the edge, my victory was certain if I reached grade 6.\u201cHow can you be so confident? Isn\u2019t your Gift related to guns?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared at Yoo Yeonha silently. I was pondering on how to answer her question.\u201cTsk, fine. I won\u2019t ask. So sensitive\u2026\u201dBut Yoo Yeonha misunderstood my reaction and clicked her tongue before I had the chance to answer.She then stared at Park Soohyuk and his HUV before asking.\u201cAh, if you\u2019re here to hunt, can I come with you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the Trouble (3)Koong. Koong. Koong.Every time the tires hit a rock, the HUV shook violently. Just how much of an old model was it to not even have a steady driving module? Yoo Yeonha was both confused and shocked.\u201cEhew.\u201d\u2018Why did I ask to follow them?\u2019 Five minutes were enough to make her regret her words.\u201c\u2026So why are you here?\u201dWhile she was steadying herself from the constant bumps, Kim Hajin, who was sitting next to her, asked. Yoo Yeonha glanced at him and retorted.\u201cWhat use is going on vacations? You have to see things, hear things, and feel things to advance forward.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dKim Hajin quickly accepted Yoo Yeonha\u2019s words and faced front again. Yoo Yeonha stared at him fixedly.He was average-looking no matter how many times she saw him. If he had glasses, his face would be the average face of all salarymen.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dBut, there weren\u2019t just one or two things that were suspicious about him. Rather than suspicious, he was full of secrets. Unfathomable\u2026 was too grand of a word to describe him, but he was still mysterious.When Yoo Yeonha was having such trifling thoughts, she felt her smartwatch vibrate.It was a message from Chae Nayun.[Alright, I\u2019ll take on his bet. Looks like he needs to be put in place.]She seemed quite angry. With a snicker, Yoo Yeonha initiated a conversation.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cNayun says she\u2019ll do it. The bet.\u201dAt that moment, Kim Hajin\u2019s smartwatch also vibrated. Yoo Yeonha was curious.\u201cShow me too.\u201dKim Hajin displayed the message without complaints.[Sure, let\u2019s fight. I\u2019ll give you a month. I\u2019ll bet my everything that I\u2019ll win. What are you going to bet?]A duel between an archer and a gunman was thus established.Yoo Yeonha found the situation quite ridiculous, but was also curious.\u201c\u2026By the way, why are you doing this?\u201dOf all people, why was he so bent on provoking Chae Nayun?Kim Hajin stared at Yoo Yeonha. He then spoke as though it was an obvious truth.\u201cChae Nayun\u2019s real talent isn\u2019t in bows.\u201dYoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying.\u201cIf she gives up on using a bow, she can advance much further.\u201dKim Hajin added those words somewhat bitterly. At least, that\u2019s what Yoo Yeonha felt.Yoo Yeonha then began to see what was going on.Without interest, there was no criticism. One had to carefully scrutinize something to see its flaws. In a way, giving proper criticisms was harder than giving compliments.In that sense\u2026Just how long has this man been watching Chae Nayun to be so sure of his thoughts? Three months? Half a year? A year? Or perhaps even longer?\u2018\u2026Come to think of it.\u2019During the third year of Agent Military Academy, Kim Hajin was in the same class as Chae Nayun. They were both only 11 years old. From then until now, six whole years had gone by.Could it be that for six years, this man\u2026Clunk!\u201cAk!\u201dSuddenly, the HUV shook violently and stopped. Yoo Yeonha hit her head against the headrest of the front seat.\u201cW-What\u2019s going on!?\u201dYoo Yeonha was inexperienced with such things, but both Park Soohyuk and Kim Hajin weren\u2019t. Park Soohyuk turned off the engine and spoke.\u201cThis is the monster point. We\u2019re getting off.\u201d\u201cMonster point?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, it\u2019s a place where many monsters appear\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what it means, but how do you know that this is a monster point?\u201d\u201cEnd of April is when monsters start to get more active. The weaker ones will be pushed out of their territories, and this is a natural escape route. There are a few more places like that, but those places are famous so they\u2019re always bustling with people.\u201dPark Soohyuk replied without hesitation, causing Yoo Yeonha to stare at him in surprise.But her gaze quickly fell back on her smartwatch. She had received a message.\u201cHmm\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d\u201cHuh? Didn\u2019t you want to hunt with us?\u201d\u201cSomething came up just now. Plus, I said I wanted to come with you, I didn\u2019t say anything about hunting together.\u201dYoo Yeonha got off the car.From the distance, Essence of the Strait\u2019s guild members came running.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be off.\u201d\u201cYeah, see you later.\u201d\u201cYes, see you back at Cube.\u201dAfter taking in Kim Hajin\u2019s average appearance once again, Yoo Yeonha turned back.\u201cAh, by the way\u2026\u201dBut almost as though she forgot something, she quickly turned around and reached her hand out to Park Soohyuk.\u201cCan I get your business card?\u201d**For a week, I focused on hunting and training. I went to Wonju every day and hunted an average of 15 monsters per day.The combination of Aether and Desert Eagle was undoubtedly overpowered for a weakling like me. Even if I didn\u2019t aim at a vital point, I could one or two shot any monster under low-intermediate rank grade 6.\u201cHm\u2026 It\u2019s not going up by much.\u201dNow, it was Wednesday.Classes would restart in two days. Cadets were returning, and the archery bet between Chae Nayun and me was already widespread.===\u25b7\u300cMaster Sharpshooter\u300d[Low-intermediate rank] [Spirit attribute] [Evolving \u2014 Grade 7] [Proficiency EXP 75%]===Master Sharpshooter was only 25% away from grade 6. I\u2019ve been shooting monsters for an entire week, but the proficiency didn\u2019t even increase by 10%. It was because the amount of EXP needed to rank up increased exponentially.\u201cWill I be able to hit grade 6 in a month?\u201dNow that the bet was happening, I had to win, but I felt a bit uneasy at just grade 7.Drrrr\u2014At that moment, the room suddenly rumbled.Was it an earthquake?I quickly looked around. For some reason, it felt like I was at the epicenter of the earthquake.\u201cEh?\u201dI found something strange. The seed I had placed on my desk was shaking fiercely. Looking at it closely, I noticed that the blood disappeared from the gauze I wrapped it with.\u201c\u2026Is it hungry?\u201dWhen I asked, the shaking stopped. I was dumbstruck, but I still took out another gauze soaked with Rachel\u2019s blood. I pulled the seed out of the whitened gauze and placed it on top of the new gauze. Immediately, the seed trembled as though it was happy before burying itself into the gauze.\u201cInteresting.\u201dWas Rachel\u2019s blood that delicious?\u201cOh right.\u201dSoon, an itinerary would be posted for the traveling club\u2019s next trip.I checked my smartwatch for an announcement.[Traveling Club \u2013 There will be a trip this weekend.]Yun Hyun, unfortunately, destroyed the academics club, and the hunting club was suspended because of Sven. The traveling club was the only club I had left. Everything was happening according to the original story.During this trip, another incident would occur.The traveling club would soon be caught in an assassination incident.The traveling club\u2019s leader was kind and gentle, but his indecisiveness and naivety made him the target of a French conman. The conman, disguising himself as a rich businessman, coaxed the club leader to bring the traveling club\u2019s cadets to his giant mansion, saying that he would pay for all expenses.The club leader made his decision after visiting France and enjoying his time during the trip.However, the rich businessman\u2019s real identity was an infamous conman who was constantly under the threat of assassination by people he had conned in the past. Although he didn\u2019t need to worry about them because most of them were powerless, he had accidentally provoked a group he shouldn\u2019t have.Footsteps of Darkness.\u2014While the time changes from Saturday to Sunday, your life will be taken.He had received an assassination notice from Footsteps of Darkness, a notorious assassination group known to target criminals.When he received the notice, the conman despaired.Because he was a wanted criminal, he couldn\u2019t report it to the Hero Association to receive help. He also didn\u2019t have enough time to liquidate his assets, so he didn\u2019t have enough money to hire mercenaries.After pondering over the matter for a long time, he came up with the idea of inviting cadets to protect himself for the weekend.But there was another secret behind the event\u2026\u201cHm.\u201dThis should be the correct event since the assassination incident was supposed to happen a week after the combat exams.Ding dong\u2014At that moment, a violet bordered alert popped up on the corner of my laptop screen.It was from Violet Banquet.I quickly clicked on the alert.Truth Agency had received its first customer.\u2014Here is a detailed information on someone I wish to find. He\u2019s an evil man who conned my family and ran away. Can you tell me where he is?\u201c\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201dA beer belly, snake-like eyes, and chubby cheeks. It was the stereotypical face of a conman.This man was the conman behind the assassination incident, Belbet.**In a dark, abandoned factory used as the Chameleon Troupe\u2019s hideout, the presence of people was felt for the first time in some time.Stuck to the surface of the concrete floor were ten shadows. All ten colors besides the currently empty seat of Black were gathered in this place. It was to discuss the seat which had been empty for three years.The shadows were positioned around a round table, watching a video projected by Droon. Shown on the video was a person Droon personally witnessed.It was part of Droon\u2019s Gift, an ability which could project or materialize anything he experienced with his five senses.The ten shadows watched the video, some with curiosity and some with disapproval.[KWANG\u2014!]\u201cOh geez, that surprised me.\u201dThe end of the video was marked by a thunderous gunshot and a brilliant white flash.When the video came to an end, the leader of the shadows signaled the start of the discussion.\u201cRaise your hand if you see potential.\u201dHowever, the voting didn\u2019t begin, as a high-pitched female voice quickly cut in.\u201cBy the way, Boss\u2026\u201dBoss stared at the source of the voice, a beautiful Caucasian woman.\u201cWhen did we become a group that needed to meet to analyze some greenhorn?\u201dHer complaint quickly clashed with a man\u2019s gentle voice.\u201cI think he has potential. Most importantly, I like that he doesn\u2019t have parents or a significant other.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have people by your side, you start to indulge in other things. We might not be able to give honor, but we can give money.\u201dThe Chameleon Troupe was one of the extremely few groups listed on the Hero Association\u2019s violet list. However, only the name of the group was known to the public and its members\u2019 identities remained completely hidden.The Chameleon Troupe guaranteed the freedom of its members. They could live their lives however they wished. Only when there was work to do did the members gather or work in teams to complete missions.\u201cSo what, you want to bring him in? A kid who can be sent flying by a little nudge?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re strictly talking about his potential\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet.\u201dBoss crushed the rising debate between the two members.\u201cFrom this man\u2026\u201dIn truth, the Chameleon Troupe was like a mercenary group. Of course, their goal was much grander than making money and living a lavish life. But that didn\u2019t mean their goal was unattainable.To achieve their goal, the Chameleon Troupe did what they needed to do at the right moment. Currently, their goal was to kill the \u2018traitor\u2019.\u201cI confirmed the power of anti-magic.\u201dBoss threw a glance at Droon.Receiving her look, Droon projected another video.The man in the video was using an ordinary gun to fight an opponent using qi reinforcement. When the bullet he fired shattered the qi reinforcement, the weight of the air was clearly heavier than before.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s illogical to think that the same thing will work against that guy just because he managed to break a qi reinforcement of that level.\u201d\u201cLike I said, Jain, Boss didn\u2019t say we were recruiting him right away. She asked if he had \u2018potential\u2019. At least in my eyes, he seems to have it.\u201dAt the man\u2019s snarky rebuttal, Jain sent him a glare.\u201cFine, let\u2019s say we bring him in after he grows up. Black is the only color we have, so is he getting that seat?\u201dBlack wasn\u2019t a color that suited a greenhorn.Black was the color belonging to the man who betrayed the previous boss. At the same time, it was the color of the \u2018strongest member\u2019 of the Chameleon Troupe. This rule remained unchanged for over 20 years.\u201c\u2026Then I\u2019ll take over that color.\u201dAt that moment, a giant man spoke up. It was Cheok Jungyeong, who had stayed silent this entire time.\u201cRejected. You\u2019re too stupid.\u201d\u201cI also reject. I\u2019m stronger.\u201d\u201cThen what do you bastards want to do?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t there others? Are we just going to ignore Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to vote on them next. This discussion is for who we\u2019ll select as candidates.\u201dTroupe members who had remained silent began to speak up one by one.

Tit for Tat (1)\u201cHuu.\u201dStanding in front of the classroom, I took in a deep breath.Today was Friday. Cadets who had gone home or on vacations had all returned by now, and Cube was back to normal after all the chaos. Cube was continuing its normal routine.I opened the classroom door, holding in my nervousness. Immediately, several meaningful gazes fell on me.For now, I sat down on my usual seat. I could hear everyone whispering about my bet with Chae Nayun.I tried my best to ignore them as I opened my textbook. I was at least happy that blatant bullying stopped after I beat up Kim Horak.\u201cGuys, grades are out for the written exams.\u201dAt that moment, Yi Yeonghan appeared, carrying large scrolls in his arms. He put them up on the wall one by one. The results for each theory class were listed along with a ranking of the combined results.Everyone stared at the scrolls while groaning.Not long afterward, everyone turned towards me.===Rank 1. Kim HajinRank 2. Rachel\u2026\u2026===My name was on top of every exam and the overall rankings.Not just in Veritas class, but in the entire academy.\u201cKuhum.\u201dFeeling awkward, I let out a dry cough as I stole a glance at Rachel. She was sitting behind me with her face buried on her desk. I could faintly hear her sigh and murmur in English, \u2018I should have worked harder.\u2019\u201cAlso, I hope everyone knows that we have new classes.\u201dYi Yeonghan added.\u201cLook at the first year announcements if you haven\u2019t. Starting from today, Fridays will have two classes.\u201dFor first-year cadets, classes changed after their first semester midterms. It was Cube\u2019s way of giving cadets a diverse selection of classes.In addition, magicians would join in from the second semester and cadets would be able to choose the classes they wanted to take. In reality, they were taking classes that fit their roles.I turned on my smartwatch.The new class today was [Practical Magic and Intermediate Rank Magic Power Control]Drrrrk\u2014The door opened and the Phenomenon Realm Analysis professor walked in.The noisy classroom instantly fell silent.\u201cTake your seats.\u201dThe Phenomenon Realm Analysis professor peeked at the scrolls on the wall and grinned.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen the exam results.\u201dThe cadets groaned slightly.\u201cNow, now, your tests were easier than the ones I give to college students. Also, Kim Hajin cadet.\u201dSuddenly, the professor pointed at me. Others also followed his finger and turned towards me.\u201cAn unconventional outlook and logical judgment, I could see true \u2018wisdom\u2019 from your answers. Frankly, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re only 16. You\u2019re good enough to be writing thesis papers for graduation.\u201dIf the professor\u2019s praise ended there, I would have simply been happy. After all, it was the first time I was being praised for doing well on an exam.\u201cSince today is the first class after exams, I will give a quick lecture using Kim Hajin cadet\u2019s answer sheet and call it a day.\u201dBut for some reason, he put up my answer sheet on the screen.I was caught completely off guard.\u201cNow, take a look at this answer. He wrote, if monsters had linguistic abilities\u2026\u201dThe class continued. I put my hands over my face, feeling it heat up and ready to explode.**It was now 3:30 in the afternoon and the time for Friday\u2019s second class. 98 cadets of the Veritas class were gathered at the Magic Library.The chief magician in charge of the class was waiting in an empty lecture room, which only had desks and chairs in case of a magic accident.\u201cHello, I am the chief magician from Seoul Magic Tower, Kim Hyojun. Every Friday, from 3:30 to 6, I will be teaching you practical magic and magic power control. But of course, today\u2019s class will only be 30 minutes.\u201dThe chief magician introduced himself with a gentle smile. However, I couldn\u2019t help but furrow my brows.Kim Hyojun was a prick.He led a successful life as the third generation child of a magic clan, but his talent wasn\u2019t good enough to land him the chief magician seat. Although he ended up becoming one thanks to his clan\u2019s lobbying, that was the limit of his career.In the end, he acknowledged his limits and turned to education.But his poor character \u2013 arrogance, jealousy, and perverseness \u2013 would cause problems in the future. Eventually, he would even fearlessly touch Chae Nayun while pretending to teach her.The only good thing about him was that he didn\u2019t form a contract with a devil.[Kim Hyojun \u2013 Currently considering a contract with a devil.]\u2026But he might soon.\u201cYou might be thinking, \u2018why should I learn magic when I\u2019m not a magician?\u2019 That\u2019s a valid question, but as I\u2019m sure some of you know, qi reinforcement and sword qi are an extension of magic.\u201dKim Hyojun released his magic power into the air as a demonstration. The soft and jellylike magic power he emitted instantly hardened when he concentrated.\u201cNow, if you simply use your \u2018physical power\u2019 to reinforce your magic power, that becomes qi reinforcement or sword qi. But if you refine your magic power with some calculations\u2026\u201dImmediately, a pink flame rose up from his magic power.Cadets instantly exclaimed in awe.\u201cIt becomes magic.\u201dKim Hyojun smiled.\u201cEven if you can\u2019t wield magic of this level, you will learn to use more practical magic, or learn to wield things like qi reinforcement and sword qi more naturally. Since today is the first class, we will only go over what we will learn in the future.\u201dSuddenly, a blue sphere the size of a ping-pong ball shot up from his palm.\u201cThis is a necessary magic to learn before entering a Dungeon. It\u2019s called Light Sphere. It will be your light source in many dark areas. It may look simple at first glance, but to wield it skillfully\u2026\u201dKim Hyojun gave a complicated explanation.To simplify things a bit, we had to compress magic power and air into a spherical shape that lights up.\u201cNow, before I teach you where to begin, try doing it yourself.\u201dCadets began to emit their magic power.I stared at my desk blankly before joining my hands and thinking, \u2018Appear, sphere of light. Appear, sphere of light.\u2019Stigma\u2019s magic power didn\u2019t require intense focus or complex calculations. Soon, Stigma\u2019s magic power flowed down into my hands and formed a white sphere of light. The cute sphere floated around on my palm.Wiing\u2014At that moment, my smartwatch vibrated. Startled, I canceled the Light Sphere.\u201cPlease turn off your smartwatches during class.\u201dKim Hyojun\u2019s disgruntled gaze fell on me.\u201cSorry.\u201dI bowed slightly and checked my smartwatch.It was a message from Yoo Yeonha.[Um, we can\u2019t do something like that yet. If you show people what you just did, they\u2019re going to misunderstand~]\u201cWhat.\u201dI quickly scanned the room and found Yoo Yeonha sitting diagonally from me. When her eyes met mine, she smiled sweetly and mouthed silently.\u2018Amazing. You did that after listening to his explanation once?\u2019After hearing her sarcastic remark, I glanced at the cadets around me. Less than half of the cadets were able to compress their magic power into a sphere, and even those who succeeded couldn\u2019t maintain the form for long. No one was even close to being able to make the sphere shine.\u201cW-Whoa!\u201dAt that moment, a nameless cadet suddenly shouted.In the frontmost seat, blue light was shining from the Light Sphere in his hand.Other cadets exclaimed in shock, while Kim Hyojun\u2019s face stiffened. After staring at Kim Suho\u2019s Light Sphere for a good minute, he suddenly snapped.\u201cStop.\u201dOh right, this was the reason Kim Hyojun came to be jealous of Kim Suho.Kim Hyojun scowled for a moment but he quickly straightened his face before continuing in a kind tone.\u201c\u2026If you make it like that, you\u2019ll be overburdening your magic power. Now, pay attention everyone. I\u2019ll give a more detailed explanation.\u201dKim Hyojun then began to give Kim Suho a private lesson. It seemed he wanted to test Kim Suho\u2019s limits.While I was watching them quietly, Yoo Yeonha sent me another message.[It must look like child\u2019s play. You can easily make brilliant white light, while someone else is being praised for what\u2019s really only a faint glow.]\u201c\u2026What is she saying.\u201dI ignored Yoo Yeonha\u2019s alien talk.**The next day, 12:30 P.M. on Saturday.I arrived at the traveling club\u2019s meeting place. Most of the others were already here. They seemed excited it was an overnight trip.\u201cHajin-ssi is here too. Alright, let\u2019s form our teams before setting off.\u201dThe club leader, Oh Hanhyun, took out a box for drawing lots just like before. According to the original story, Kim Suho would be paired up with Yoo Yeonha. I didn\u2019t care about the rest.\u201cFirst, Suho-ssi? Please step out. You\u2019ll be drawing lots first.\u201dI was still a bit nervous. Hopefully, everything was the same as in the original story.Now, who will Kim Suho pick?*France, Paris.I stepped foot in this European country for the first time ever. Thanks to Seoul-Paris Portal, we only needed ten seconds to arrive.\u201cSo it really is a bit different.\u201dParis\u2019 scenery looked like what I saw in pictures, but it was also different than what I had seen in the old world. Around the Eiffel Tower were buildings built with state-of-the-art technology, and Paris Hero Academy\u2019s cadets were around the streets with swords and spears.For the record, France was the leader of the European Union in my story. It just showed how well-operated France\u2019s Hero system was.\u201cKorean cadets, over here!\u201dWhen we were looking around Paris\u2019 scenery, someone called us over. Turning to the direction of the voice, we saw a limousine. The club leader, Oh Hanhyun, walked up to the limousine with a hearty laugh.\u201cNice to meet you. You must be Raymond.\u201d\u201cYes, nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cCan we drop off our bags real quick before we take a look around the city?\u201dThe man name Raymond nodded with a smile. We stuffed our bags into the limousine.\u201cNow, we\u2019ll travel in the pairs we formed.\u201dI was paired up with Chae Nayun. I didn\u2019t know why, it just happened that way. It was good that Kim Suho became paired with Yoo Yeonha like in the original story, but I wasn\u2019t too comfortable being Chae Nayun\u2019s pair.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s 1 P.M. right now\u2026 so meet back here at 7.\u201dThen, Oh Hanhyun left with the girlfriend he brought on the trip using his authority as the club leader, as she wasn\u2019t a member of the traveling club. They were likely going to the masquerade party happening later today.\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun stared at Kim Suho with a wistful look before walking up to me.\u201cHey, where do you want to go?\u201dShe asked me.\u201cI\u2019m getting lunch.\u201dSince I was in France, I had to try its gourmet food. I had already researched several places since I was excited for my first Europe visit. After looking through several pamphlets, I even used the Book of Truth to find the best place to eat.\u201cLunch? I guess it is about that time. Where are you going?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re coming with me?\u201dChae Nayun didn\u2019t seem to mind coming with me. It was surprising, considering there were rumors that she practiced archery with pictures of my face on the target.\u201cWe drew lots and what\u2019s done is done. What, do you want to split up?\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh right.\u201dCome to think of it, Chae Nayun had no sense of direction. She would get lost as easily as a five-year-old in a forest. She could find her way home from desolate places using her magic power and scent, but places she visited for the first time were like mazes to her.\u201cWhat\u2019s right?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just follow me.\u201dChae Nayun crossed her arms as though she doubted my manliness. She pouted and spoke curtly.\u201cAnd how do you know where anything is?\u201d\u201cI know better than you.\u201dBook of Truth showed only two restaurants \u2013 a cheap and delicious restaurant and an expensive restaurant that was worth its cost. I was okay with either, but the latter should fit Chae Nayun\u2019s taste more.I turned on the GPS guide to the more expensive restaurant.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Okay, but I\u2019m letting you know, I\u2019m a really picky eater.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dShe acted like a tomboy but because she ate only the highest quality food from a young age, her palate was nobler than that of most nobles.\u201c\u2026How do you know that?\u201dI ignored her question and walked to the restaurant. Chae Nayun followed after me like a cat.After walking for about 15 minutes, we arrived at the restaurant.[Go\u00fbt C\u00e9leste]I had no clue what it meant, but anyone could see at first glance just how fancy it was.\u201cOh, this is the place?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cOoh~\u201dChae Nayun and I walked to the entrance. Immediately, a man in a suit stopped us.\u201c@!#[email\u00a0protected]#[email\u00a0protected]#$\u201dHe was speaking in French, so it only sounded like gibberish.Chae Nayun tilted her head and asked.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe man cleared his voice and asked again in Korean.\u201cDo you have a reservation?\u201d\u201cOh, he speaks Korean. Hey, you didn\u2019t make a reservation, right? Don\u2019t you know you need to make reservations for high-end restaurants?\u201dI opened my laptop silently. I didn\u2019t make a reservation, but I could hack into their reservation list.Using the laptop\u2019s internet function, I accessed the restaurants\u2019 reservation list. Because I only needed to access a restaurant\u2019s private server, I only had to pay a cheap price.I found the reservation list and put my name down around a 1 P.M. slot.\u201cHey!\u201dChae Nayun shouted into my ear. I took my eyes off the laptop and saw Chae Nayun right in front of me. Even up close, I couldn\u2019t see a single flaw in her smooth skin. I swallowed hard.\u201cEh? W-What?\u201d\u201cReservation. Did you make one?\u201dChae Nayun asked again, and I nodded.\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cTell him my name.\u201dChae Nayun still looked doubtful but approached the man nonetheless.\u201cKim Hajin. Is his name there?\u201dThe man checked his smartwatch.It seemed he found my name as he let us through with a smile.\u201cYes, Kim Hajin and one companion. Welcome.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh wow.\u201dChae Nayun looked at me in surprise. Then, we walked in together.\u201cI like the atmosphere.\u201dI agreed with Chae Nayun. The inside of the restaurant was just as imposing as the outside. A calming classical piece flowed beautifully, while each and every decoration was delicate and elegant.Customers inside were also wearing dresses and suits, despite it being lunchtime.\u201cFollow me.\u201dWe followed the waiter and sat down next to a window.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWelcome to Go\u00fbt C\u00e9leste. Do you need help with the menu?\u201d\u201cYou handle it.\u201dI let Chae Nayun take over. She took the menu and skillfully finished ordering.Once the waiter left, silence descended. We were staring at each other but didn\u2019t have much to say. Feeling a bit awkward, I turned to the side and looked out the window.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAt that moment, I caught sight of an unexpected individual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tit for Tat (2)A familiar face flashed by the window. Although she was covering herself with a mask and sunglasses, I could see through her face.Vice-leader of Korea\u2019s rank 1 guild, Yun Seung-Ah.She was walking somewhere with a companion.This was something that didn\u2019t happen in the original story. She was someone who shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201cWait for me here.\u201d\u201cWhat? Hey, where are you going!?\u201dLeaving behind the shouting Chae Nayun, I ran out of the restaurant.Thankfully, Yun Seung-Ah wasn\u2019t walking fast. I quickly ran up to her and grabbed her shoulder.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHuak!\u201dStartled, she jumped up with an odd scream. Yun Seung-Ah turned around, her head creaking like a machine. When she saw my face, she flinched. She definitely recognized me.\u201c\u2026W-Who are you?\u201dShe feigned ignorance. Was she here on a mission?I looked at the person standing next to her, a Caucasian man, but I couldn\u2019t recognize him from his outer appearance.Naturally, I turned on my laptop.There was an alert as I\u2019d expected.[Setting change \u2013 An ill relationship kindled between Jain and Yun Seung-Ah through an anonymous informant.]Jain and Yun Seung-Ah.I knew their relationship better than anyone else.It was a cat-and-dog relationship. Jain had the Chameleon Troupe\u2019s Yellow seat, and her Gift was specialized in stealing and disguising things.Solely out of boredom, Jain disguised herself as an old classmate of Yun Seung-Ah and entered Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace. Through several events, the two of them would then get extremely close.Eventually, Jain would become the only one Yun Seung-Ah could call her friend, but she would betray Yun Seung-Ah in a critical moment. While fighting a group of Djinns over an artifact, she would critically injure Yun Seung-Ah to take the artifact for herself.I knew that Jain would be infiltrating the VIP masquerade party happening this evening.It was to steal a certain ring.Although the ring wasn\u2019t worth much at the moment, that was only because its abilities weren\u2019t fully awakened. Once its potential exploded, its value would skyrocket immensely.What made this even more complex was that this ring would eventually belong to Chae Nayun. When she eventually changes her position to a swordsman, her father would gift this item after buying it from the black market.\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know who you are, but we have to go.\u201dYun Seung-Ah still denied knowing me, and the man next to her separated me from her. He was taller than me by a head.But\u2026The man was actually a \u2018she\u2019.My eyes saw through her diguise.Jain Valerin.She was currently disguised as Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s subordinate.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dYun Seung-Ah was currently standing right next to her fated enemy, but she couldn\u2019t recognize her at all. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sorry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must have mistaken you for someone else.\u201dI bowed in apology.Since we would meet at the masquerade, I backed away for now.**\u201cThat crazy bastard\u2026\u201dKim Hajin ran out of the restaurant. Chae Nayun was wondering what illness of his relapsed this time, but since he was always acting strange, she didn\u2019t think too much of it. In truth, the person she was more concerned about was elsewhere. Not to mention, with another girl.After agonizing over what to do, Chae Nayun held up her smartwatch.\u201c\u2026Hey, Yeonha, where are you?\u201dThe receiver of her call was none other than Yoo Yeonha, who was paired with Kim Suho.\u2014Me? I\u2019m shopping. Why?Shopping. There were too many shops around. Where was she exactly?Chae Nayun feigned indifference and asked.\u201cWhat shop?\u201d\u2014I\u2019m buying some clothes.\u201cA-Alone?\u201d\u2014No, with Kim Suho.Yoo Yeonha\u2019s immediate answer made Chae Nayun feel a bit uneasy.\u201c\u2026What are you doing with him?\u201d\u2014Hm? I\u2019m just making him try on some clothes. He\u2019s got the face of a model, but you know how he dresses. So I\u2019m buying him some clothes.\u201cWhat? Why are you buying him clothes!?\u201dChae Nayun shouted inadvertently.The gazes of the customers sitting nearby fell on her. Feeling awkward, Chae Nayun modestly dropped her head.\u2014Huh? What, I can\u2019t? It\u2019s for the masquerade party we\u2019re going to later.\u201c\u2026No, not that you can\u2019t, but you know\u2026 it\u2019s expensive. You have to save money when you can. If you buy him things, he\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\u2014\u2026Um, sure\u2026. So, Nayun, where are you?\u201cI\u2019m at a restaurant.\u201d\u2014With Kim Hajin?\u201cYeah, he brought me here. But you know, there aren\u2019t many restaurants that fit my taste. I\u2019ll just have to endure it like I did with Agent Military Academy\u2019s lunch.\u201dChae Nayun recalled painful memories of the past. At the Agent Military Academy, the academy\u2019s food was the only lunch option for cadets. She would be starving if she didn\u2019t eat anything, but she would feel queasy for the entire day if she did\u2026Chae Nayun let out a light sigh.\u2014Really? What\u2019s the restaurant called?Chae Nayun looked around the restaurant. There was a sign engraved with the restaurant\u2019s name, but she didn\u2019t know how to read it.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026. Hold on.\u201dThe waiter came with the appetizer at just the right time.\u201cExcuse me, how do you read that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cThe restaurant\u2019s name.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s Go\u00fbt C\u00e9leste.\u201d\u201cCan you say that again here?\u201dChae Nayun held up her smartwatch to the waiter. The waiter was slightly dumbstruck but still pronounced the name clearly.\u201cGo\u00fbt C\u00e9leste.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cUm, have you perhaps not heard about our restaurant?\u201d\u201cHm? Ah, no.\u201dChae Nayun shooed the waiter away and went back to her conversation with Yoo Yeonha.\u201cHey, did you hear that?\u201d\u2014\u2026Did I hear that right? Go\u00fbt C\u00e9leste? Flavor of Heaven?Chae Nayun didn\u2019t know whether Yoo Yeonha was talking about the same place, but she said the same thing the waiter did.\u201cYeah, I think so. Why? Is this place famous?\u201d\u2014\u2026Kim Hajin brought you there? How?\u201cHah?\u201dBecause of Yoo Yeonha\u2019s odd reaction, Chae Nayun tilted her head.\u2014I tried to make a reservation and failed. Even with a VIP membership, you need to make a reservation at least a week in advance.\u201cReally? Is this place that famous?\u201d\u2014Ehew\u2026Chae Nayun\u2019s innocent question caused Yoo Yeonha to let out a deep sigh. But Chae Nayun, who didn\u2019t care about such things, truthfully had no way of knowing how famous this restaurant was.\u2014That\u2019s De Jubon\u2019s restaurant. You know, the cooking Hero.\u201cAh?\u201dDe Jubon. Chae Nayun had heard of the name before.There were all sorts of Gifts in the world and all sorts of Heroes. De Jubon was special even among the countless number of Heroes. He was lauded as the Hero who could move people with just his food.It was said that Djinns and Heroes were equal in front of De Jubon\u2019s food.\u2014Paris\u2019 Go\u00fbt C\u00e9leste is his flagship restaurant, so it should be him cooking and not his apprentices.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018This place was that amazing?\u2019 Chae Nayun became lost for words.\u2014Oh right, Nayun, do you remember being in Kim Hajin\u2019s class in the third year of Agent Military Academy?\u201cEh? Was I?\u201d\u2014You didn\u2019t know?\u201cNo, not at all. How am I supposed to know that?\u201dThat was something she had no memory of. Not to mention, she was entirely focused on training at the time.\u2014\u2026I see. Well, since you\u2019re there, enjoy the food. Ah, don\u2019t forget to take pictures of every dish before you eat. I want to see them later.Yoo Yeonha\u2019s voice carried a clear envy.\u201cUh, um, yeah.\u201d\u2014Mkay, I\u2019m hanging up.\u2018Should I be happy? Or should I feel uncomfortable?\u2019 The call ended before Chae Nayun could make up her mind.Chae Nayun stared at the appetizer in front of her. It was a simple soup and salad, but for some reason, they seemed to glisten like jewels.Picking up her spoon, she slowly scooped up a spoonful and took a sip.The moment her tongue made contact with the soup, her eyes widened and her body trembled.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe was at a complete loss for words.So this was the reason De Jubon came to be called the world\u2019s greatest cook, the so-called \u2018flavor of mana\u2019.Just a single spoon was enough to shock her refined palate. At that moment, Kim Hajin came back.\u201cIt\u2019s already here?\u201dHe sat back down on his seat and picked up his spoon.Chae Nayun carefully stared at him.She had too many questions she wanted to ask.First was how he managed to make a reservation.Yoo Yeonha said even VIP members needed to make a reservation a week in advance, but Kim Hajin had done it.It was strange. Even if he had a VIP membership, the announcement for the trip only came out four days ago.It was unlikely that Oh Hanhyun told him about the club\u2019s trip beforehand\u2026Suddenly, a thought flashed in her head. She recalled her conversation with Kim Hajin twenty or so minutes ago.\u2014Hm\u2026 Okay, but I\u2019m letting you know, I\u2019m a really picky eater.\u2014I know.Kim Hajin said he \u201cknew\u201d that I was a picky eater. In other words, he must have planned on taking me here from the start\u2026Even though pairs were chosen by drawing lots, it was something that could be easily manipulated if he talked to the club leader beforehand.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dChae Nayun gave Kim Hajin a meaningful glare.\u201cHey, where did you go?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm? Oh, I just thought I saw someone I knew, but it turns out I was mistaken.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s someone you know in Paris?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dKim Hajin gave a short reply.\u201cHow did you make a reservation for this place? I heard it\u2019s really famous. Did this acquaintance of yours help you?\u201dAt her words, Kim Hajin\u2019s hands shook slightly, and it didn\u2019t escape Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes.\u201cUm, yeah. Anyways, aren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201dKim Hajin quickly changed the subject.\u201c\u2026I will.\u201dThe lunch continued. The two of them ate without further conversation.Once the appetizer disappeared from their plates, the waiter came back with the main entr\u00e9e.Chae Nayun\u2019s suspicion was quickly melted away by the transcendental flavor of De Jubon\u2019s food.**\u201cWhew, I\u2019m stuffed.\u201dChae Nayun and I came out of the restaurant. As expected of a course menu, food streamed in endlessly over an hour, and I was stuffed full as a result. Of course, I could have stopped eating in the middle, but the food was too good to pass up.It was a good experience.I had to thank this world for letting me try this heavenly flavor.\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201dWhen I was rubbing my puffed up belly, Chae Nayun suddenly called my name. Just like me, she had a satisfied expression.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cThanks for the food.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t be. You paid for it.\u201dChae Nayun insisted on paying for the food, saying that it was only natural since I made the reservation. The bill came up to 700 euros, but she paid for it nonetheless.\u201cThe membership fee must be expensive, so it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201dChae Nayun said so as she glanced at me from head to toe.I didn\u2019t know what she meant by membership fee, but I just nodded understandingly.\u201cRight.\u201d\u201c\u2026So, where are you going now?\u201dAt her words, I glanced at my watch. It was almost 3:00.Since the masquerade started at 5:00, I needed to go now and look around the venue for a good place to observe the inside.\u201cDo you want to split up now?\u201dI had to keep my eyes out on the masquerade party. To do so, I had to get away from Chae Nayun.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll go ahead first.\u201dChae Nayun nodded and started walking the opposite direction.\u201cHello. Yeah, Yeonha, where are you? I\u2019ll meet up with you guys.\u201dWith my Gift, I could hear Chae Nayun\u2019s voice even from a distance.\u2014What about Kim Hajin?She was obviously talking to Yoo Yeonha.\u201cWe just split up.\u201d\u2014Huh? Why? We still have time left.\u201cIt just felt awkward being alone with him. I don\u2019t know what to say either. By the way, can I also go to that masquerade party you were talking about?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s final words caught my attention.The masquerade party\u2026 wasn\u2019t in that direction.**Yun Seung-Ah quickly ran away to a nearby caf\u00e9. After ordering two cups of coffee, she took a seat and breathed out a deep sigh.\u201cWhew, that surprised me. Why did he pop out of there\u2026?\u201dHer heart was still pounding from an earlier encounter.\u201cWho was that?\u201d\u201cA cadet. Someone I\u2019ve seen before. His name is Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is he any good?\u201dAt her subordinate\u2019s question, Yun Seung-Ah gave a firm nod.\u201cHe\u2019s all the talk recently. Last week I think it was? A video of his duel was released to the guild community. He shattered a qi reinforcement using a single bullet. I\u2019m pretty annoyed by the whole thing. I was the one who noticed his talents first.\u201dYun Seung-Ah complained with glaring eyes.\u201cHaha.\u2026 That aside, do you think that woman will really come to today\u2019s masquerade party?\u201d\u201cYeah, she will. I know it.\u201dThe subordinate furrowed his brows at Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s confident reply.\u201c\u2026How can you be so sure? Was it the informant?\u201d\u201cNo, it has nothing to do with the informant. That woman just likes parties, especially if there are things to steal.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dThe subordinate answered somewhat bitterly. Yun Seung-Ah stared at him fixedly and asked.\u201cWhy, do you want to know the informant\u2019s name?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know either.\u201dYun Seung-Ah smiled as she leaned on her chair.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s not just one or two people who have animosity for that woman.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019 The subordinate put on a thin smile and asked another question.\u201c\u2026What will you do if you capture that woman?\u201dYun Seung-Ah\u2019s answer was simple.\u201cWhat will I do? Nothing. I\u2019ll just hand her over to the Association.\u2026 Ah, let\u2019s get going. It\u2019s 4. I have to buy a dress too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tit for Tat (3)The masquerade party was happening at a castle in Paris constructed by a rich magnate. I positioned myself on a hill that overlooked the castle. In terms of distance, I was probably about a kilometer away.In any case, my job today was simple. I just had to make sure the story progressed as it should. If possible, I hoped that everything would go according to the original storyline without me having to interfere.5 P.M.The sun had yet to set, but the masquerade had already begun. Luxurious cars arrived at the castle one by one, and people adorned in flamboyant dresses and masks went inside.I checked Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha\u2019s location by hacking into their smartwatches\u2019 GPS system. They were getting near.5:30 P.M.Two people got off of a limousine. It was Yun Seung-Ah and Jain. They were wearing masks resembling a fox and a tiger. They walked into the castle, led by a chauffeur.Not long afterwards, Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha arrived. Fully adorned in party clothes, their perfect figures shone brilliantly even with their faces covered.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dLooking at all the masks, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that my face was too empty. I had the feeling I should wear my own mask. After all, if I had to interfere in today\u2019s events, I had to conceal my identity to ensure my safety.Although I didn\u2019t have a mask prepared, I could just use Aether to create one. Aether had the ability to transform into any equipment its user wished. Naturally, it was able to become a mask.The question was its design.I recalled a movie I saw on Earth. A mask from the movie Black Panther\u2026 though, it was really more of a helmet.In any case, Aether transformed into the form I pictured in my head. I put on the Black Panther helmet, which then adjusted itself to fit snugly around my face.6 P.M.The air was becoming chilly as the sun began to set. The castle looked even more beautiful as it burned from the setting sun. I began to observe the castle\u2019s interior more carefully.Almost as if I was inside, I could see everything clearly and hear every conversation. This came from the synergy between \u300cThousand-Mile Eyes\u300d and \u300cObservation and Reading\u300d.\u2014I don\u2019t know how to dance.\u2014So what, you\u2019re going to just stand around after coming all the way here?\u2014\u2026Well, I guess I\u2019m a quick learner.Kim Suho followed Yoo Yeonha\u2019s lead as they danced to a classical piece.At the same time, I discovered a strange movement of magic power on the other side of the castle.It was a Magic Portal.\u201c\u2026I knew it wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201dOnly Djinns could make such artificial portals. Even among Djinns, one had to be beloved by their contracted devil to have enough magic power to operate a Magic Portal.An alert popped up on my laptop.[Homer\u2019s Ring \u2013 Mythical grade artifact. It doesn\u2019t make sense that only a few people would aim for it just because it hasn\u2019t fully awakened its power.][Modified setting \u2013 The Djinn group, Evil Society, has identified its origin and will interfere in the story.]The situation was becoming more complex.I turned my gaze back to Jain.She was infiltrating the underground vault of the party\u2019s host. The security guards surrounding the vault were already taken out.\u2014Let\u2019s see\u2026Iris scanners, fingerprint scanners, and password locks were all useless in front of Jain\u2019s Gift. She easily opened the door to the vault, and from the countless number of treasures, she put a blue diamond and a ring into her magic pouch. She then returned to the masquerade party.Everything that happened so far was in the original story. The only difference was the arrival of Evil Society. If Jain could safely escape the masquerade party, I could go back, feeling relieved.But\u2026\u2014Yoren, where are you going?Yun Seung-Ah appeared out of nowhere and grabbed Jain\u2019s arm. Jain, who was about to leave the party, flinched momentarily, but soon returned to pretending to be Yoren.\u2014I went to the bathroom.\u2014Oh, well, I have something to talk to you about. Follow me.Yun Seung-Ah grabbed Jain\u2019s wrist. The exit was right in front of her, but for now, Jain followed Yun Seung-Ah obediently.**\u201c\u2026Um, vice-leader?\u201dJain was led to an empty room on the second floor of the castle. Confused, she called Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s name. The only thing in the somewhat worn room was a single bed and some dimly lit lanterns. Clearly, the place was made for a secret love affair.\u201cW-Why here?\u201d\u201cYou know why.\u201dActing coquettishly, Yun Seung-Ah pulled Yoren\u2019s wrist and pushed him on the bed. While Yoren stared at her, she closed the door and pulled her hair up in a ponytail. If it was the real Yoren, he would have been thrilled.\u201cI, um\u2026\u201dYun Seung-Ah mounted Jain in a somewhat lewd position. Then, she slowly took off Jain\u2019s mask and lowered her head to his revealed face.\u201cYoren\u2026\u201dYun Seung-Ah\u2019s breath caressed Jain\u2019s face.But, Jain could feel the slight killing intent hidden behind Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s mask.\u201cYou won\u2019t trick me a second time.\u201dYun Seung-Ah shoved her hand under the bed sheet.Shiiing\u2014A well-sharpened sword glistened in the dim light.Hearing the chilling sound, Jain quickly pushed Yun Seung-Ah off.\u201cVice-leader, what are you\u2014\u201dBefore she could finish, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s sword struck down. Jain used an emergency dagger she carried around to stop the attack.Sword and dagger.The weight and size of the two weapons were different, but the density of magic power enveloping them was equal.BOOM!The surroundings shook from the fierce collision.\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake, vice-leader\u2026 Uk!\u201dYun Seung-Ah\u2019s foot hooked towards Jain who was continuing to feign ignorance. Jain was sent flying by the kick, and Yun Seung-Ah pounced after her like a ferocious beast. Although Jain bought time for herself by running around in all directions, Yun Seung-Ah was more tenacious and nimble than ever.\u201cAk!\u201dEventually, Yun Seung-Ah got on top of Jain and was about to strike down with her sword, when a whip suddenly flew in and restrained her sword.\u201cA lover\u2019s quarrel shouldn\u2019t be so noisy.\u201dYun Seung-Ah and Jain both turned their gaze to the direction of the elegant voice.The door had opened before they noticed, and a girl wearing a cat mask was standing there.It was Yoo Yeonha.\u201cI am a Hero cadet from Cube.\u201dShe had walked upstairs to find a bathroom, hearing the sound of clashing metal during the process.She would have normally ignored it, but she had gotten tired of Kim Suho\u2019s clumsy dancing and was tempted by the chance to improve her image as a cadet who showed Korean cadet\u2019s excellence in a foreign country.\u201cIf you put your weapon down, I\u2019ll make sure there is no bloodshed.\u201dYoo Yeonha added strength to her whip as she spoke leisurely.Her whip seemed to want to snatch Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s sword, so Yun Seung-Ah ignited her magic power on her sword. Immediately, her magic power burned fiercely and scorched Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip to cinders.The only thing left of Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip was black ash.\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dIn a daze, Yoo Yeonha took a few steps back.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u2018I, I got too cocky just because I was in France. I should have known, Korea isn\u2019t the only country with powerful people.\u2019Yoo Yeonha felt her lips dry up. Hoping the woman\u2019s sinister sword qi wouldn\u2019t aim for her, Yoo Yeonha bowed in a ninety-degree angle.\u201cI will be on my way now. Please do continue what you were doing.\u201dWith that, Yoo Yeonha backed away stealthily before making a dash for it.\u201cDIE!\u201dThe fight then continued.Enraged, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s sword struck down repeatedly. Each time her sword clashed with Jain\u2019s dagger, lightning crackled and flames ignited.The roaring sound called people together, spectators and security guards quickly rushing to the room.\u201cDon\u2019t just watch and help! Uwaak!\u201dJain tried her best to withstand Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s demon-like attacks, but it was difficult to combat a sword with her short dagger. As time passed, she was driven to a corner. Jain became desperate enough to ask the spectators for help.However, security guards couldn\u2019t even dream of joining in such a fierce and ostentatious battle.\u201cUk!\u201dIn the end, Jain\u2019s dagger was unable to endure, breaking in half. Just when Yun Seung-Ah was about to make her final strike, someone stole the sword hanging by a security guard\u2019s waist.Immediately afterward, a single streak of light shot through the air and cut in between Jain and Yun Seung-Ah. Kim Suho had used a security guard\u2019s sword to block Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s Flame Sword.\u201cWho are you? Back off before I cut you down.\u201dKim Suho didn\u2019t budge even at Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s solemn warning.He wanted to become a Hero to protect people. His firm conviction couldn\u2019t be shaken so easily.\u201cI refuse.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201dCurrently, Yun Seung-Ah was half-covered by her mask. It was the same for Kim Suho. As a result, they were unable to recognize each other.\u201cI don\u2019t know the reason you want to kill him, but\u2026\u201d\u201cMove!\u201d\u201cUuk!\u201dThe current Yun Seung-Ah didn\u2019t know mercy. She kicked Kim Suho\u2019s solar plexus without a shred of hesitation, and Kim Suho knelt down on one leg as he staggered from the shock.\u201cAh, hey! You stop right there!\u201dBut thanks to Kim Suho, Jain managed to find an opening to jump out the window.\u201cSee you later, crazy bitch\u2026 Eh?\u201dHowever, her attempt to jump out the window stayed an attempt.From beneath the window, a thick darkness gushed up at Jain.The darkness swallowed Jain, who was about to escape, then spat her back out into the room.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe darkness dyed the room in black. Yun Seung-Ah who was furious, Kim Suho who was writhing in pain, and Yoo Yeonha who ran away sullenly all held their breath and stared at the darkness.Then, from the darkness, a figure of a man emerged.**\u201c\u2026Damn it\u201dOn the other hand, Chae Nayun was comparing her surroundings to the map on her smartwatch. After every couple of steps, she stopped to check her watch before continuing on her way. Eventually, she saw a familiar sign.[Go\u00fbt C\u00e9leste]\u201cWhat!? This is where I ate lunch!!\u201dShe raged. After walking for hours, she had arrived in the same place she started from.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201dShe stared at her smartwatch, fuming. If a user got lost after looking at a map, the problem lied with the map.\u201cWhat company made this!? Damn it\u2026\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s anger fell on the smartwatch Cube provided. She flipped her smartwatch harshly and saw the word inscribed on the back.\u2018Daehyun\u2019.It was her father\u2019s company.\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun called Yoo Yeonha once again.\u201cKuuuk\u2026 Why isn\u2019t she picking up!?\u201d**\u201cSo this is the item containing ancient wisdom\u2026\u201dThe Djinn who appeared from the darkness held up a ring. The setting sun gave the ring a faint red glow. It was the ring Jain had put in her magic pouch.\u201cAh, when did you take\u2026 Ak!\u201dAfter checking her magic pouch, Jain muttered despondently. Yun Seung-Ah immediately ran up to Jain, grabbing her by her hair before pointing her sword at the Djinn.\u201cPut that down.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dThe Djinn made a magnanimous smile. Yun Seung-Ah became nervous. It was obvious at first glance that the Djinn was completely different than a human.Reddish black skin and blood-red eyes. A Djinn\u2019s appearance strayed further from a human\u2019s the more one was engulfed by a devil. From his appearance, Yun Seung-Ah could estimate his strength.\u201cThis item isn\u2019t something that suits people like you.\u201dA few days ago, Evil Society had confirmed this item\u2019s location and potential through an informant.Homer\u2019s Ring \u2013 a cradle of wisdom that amplified all abilities involving magic power.They didn\u2019t expect someone else to steal the ring, but all was well since they managed to get their hands on it without much effort.\u201cNow then.\u201dWhen the Djinn was about to put away the ring in satisfaction\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhish\u2014A streak of light broke through the window and enveloped the ring. In the blink of an eye, the ring was snatched away, disappearing outside the window.\u201cW-What!?\u201dThe Djinn screamed and turned to the direction the ring flew out.Outside the window, on a faraway hill, he caught sight of someone who was holding onto a wire-like object.Someone\u2026 wearing a mask of a beast.That someone, Kim Hajin, put on a thin smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Change of Heart (1)\u2014So this is that ancient artifact\u2026The ring was snatched by the Evil Society\u2019s Djinn. Now that it was in their hands, the chances of Yun Seung-Ah or Kim Suho taking it back were grim.I had no other choice. Even if I had to attract the Djinns\u2019 attention, I had to make my move.I compressed a portion of Aether around my hand, weaving it into a wire.As Aether changed its form according to its owner\u2019s will, it was both with and without form at the same time.The only problem was that the wire wasn\u2019t long. In fact, it was short enough to fit in one hand. But when I threw this \u2018Aether wire\u2019, it would elongate accordingly.That said, the wire was still unlikely to reach the castle. Although \u2018throwing\u2019 was included in the scope of Master Sharpshooter, I didn\u2019t have the strength to fuel the throw.Thankfully, I could use Stigma\u2019s magic power to make up for what my physical body lacked.I concentrated magic power on my right arm. The two streaks of Stigma I had radiated an intense light. There was no need to go easy. I poured 80% of my remaining magic power and converted it into kinetic energy.My strength remained the same. Stigma\u2019s magic power only amplified the kinetic energy. It didn\u2019t increase my physical ability. Thus, I didn\u2019t know how powerful my throw would be. I only knew that it would be more powerful than Kim Horak.\u201cHuap!\u201dI threw the wire with a spirited shout.My target was Homer\u2019s Ring, which was being held by the Djinn.In an instant, the short dagger-length wire elongated immensely, moving like it was alive and snatching its target. Immediately afterward, I pulled the wire back.Whoosh\u2014The wire shot back in the blink of an eye and fell into my hand.As expected of an ancient artifact, there wasn\u2019t even a scratch on the ring.\u201cNice shot.\u201dAt first, I smiled in satisfaction, but my smile quickly disappeared.It was because of the wire\u2019s unexpected destructive power.To make the wire reach the castle, I had no choice but to throw it in an arc. Because of it, the wire didn\u2019t only snatch the ring. During the process, it severed a portion of the castle\u2019s walls, and on its way back, it swept through the floor, slicing apart the foundational base of the castle.As a result, part of the castle\u2019s second floor crumbled down.I watched the unexpected scenery in a daze.Although I didn\u2019t intend for this to happen, my heart immediately dropped a beat. I hoped no one was hurt by my carelessness.However, I didn\u2019t have time to worry about others.The Evil Society\u2019s Djinn was looking at me directly. It was extremely unlikely that he could see through my mask, but I knew I had to leave as quickly as possible.I began to run using the escape route I prepared beforehand.\u201cOY!\u201dWhen I was hurriedly plowing through tall grass, someone shot down from the sky in front of me. It was a Djinn who looked like a Caucasian man. Blocking the path in front me, he glared with killing intent.\u201cYou see this, right?\u201dHe tapped on his waist, where a bladeless hilt of a dagger was hanging.I knew what it was \u2013 a magic sword.It was a weapon created using state-of-the-art magic engineering technique. This weapon was often used by people who were confident in their magic power. As long as one\u2019s magic power capacity was large enough, it would display greater power than most low-rank artifacts.Now, it just so happened that an exponential increase in magic power was the most basic benefit someone gained from becoming a Djinn.\u201cIf you know what this is, you better hand that thing over.\u201dWithout waiting for my answer, he pulled out his magic sword. He looked a bit funny holding just a sword hilt, but a magic sword\u2019s might wasn\u2019t something to scoff at, especially for my current self.\u201cUm, why don\u2019t we talk it out? I can just give it to you.\u201d\u201cWhy should I? I can just kill you and take it.\u201d\u201cBut weren\u2019t you talking like you wanted to negotiate just now?\u201d\u201cWas I?\u201dThe Djinn sneered and imbued his magic sword with magic power.Wiing\u2014Just like a lightsaber, a blade of magic power shot up from the hilt. But that only lasted for a second. The sword\u2019s blade flickered, then disappeared.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dConfused, he imbued his magic power again, but nothing changed. Just like a lightbulb that exhausted its energy, the magic power blade flickered and disappeared.I immediately realized what was going on.\u201cHahaha. Hahaha.\u201dWith a hearty laugh, I transformed Desert Eagle into the shotgun mode.\u201cW-What\u2019s wrong with this thing\u2026!\u201dFlustered, the Djinn swung his sword hilt aimlessly, but there was no way that a state-of-the-art weapon would fix itself by being swung.\u201cWell, you see, that weapon won\u2019t work today.\u201dI scraped together what little magic power I had left and converted it to the magic power of light. This white magic power would flow into the shotgun shell and obliterate the Djinn.\u201cBecause I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut it! Even without a weapon\u2014\u201dKWANG.The shotgun shell perfectly struck his head.**On the other hand, Chae Nayun was sitting on a bench near the traveling club\u2019s meeting place.She had long since given up on finding the masquerade party. It was already 7 P.M., but Yoo Yeonha and Kim Suho were nowhere to be seen.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t bothered that they were missing, but for some reason, she felt anxious. But because she didn\u2019t know why she was feeling anxious, she was killing time playing a game.[Leveling-up Monster]It was an RPG game that came out only a few days ago. It wasn\u2019t a VR game, but a mobile game, making it convenient to play on her smartwatch. But it wasn\u2019t fun. It was pretty interesting at first, but her thoughts kept wandering. Just what were they doing at the masquerade party that they weren\u2019t picking up her call?\u201c\u2026Where are all these police going?\u201dBecause siren noises constantly rang out, she couldn\u2019t focus on the game either.In the end, Chae Nayun turned it off and checked her messenger app. No new messages had arrived.\u201cHaa.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m upset, but why am I upset?\u2019When Chae Nayun was sighing in annoyance, someone sat down next to her.Chae Nayun turned her head to that direction.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with you?\u201dIt was Kim Hajin, but his face was pale and he was covered in cold sweat. Clearly, he was exhausted.\u201cAre you sick?\u201dChae Nayun asked out of courtesy. Then, Kim Hajin stared at her silently.\u201c\u2026What? Answer me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit tired.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I can\u2019t move my body.\u201dKim Hajin smirked. Then, he suddenly closed his eyes and leaned on Chae Nayun.\u201cWhoa!\u201dChae Nayun quickly moved out of the way, afraid that his sweat would touch her. Consequently, Kim Hajin fell down on the bench.\u201cH-Hey! What are you scheming\u2014\u201d\u201cAh, Nayun-ssi. You\u2019re here.\u201dAt that moment, Oh Hanhyun arrived with his girlfriend. His face was grim.\u201cClub leader? Why are you so late?\u201d\u201cSo you didn\u2019t know. Something happened nearby. Kim Suho-ssi and Yoo Yeonha-ssi are being questioned.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s jaws dropped. She thought, \u2018just what the hell happened while I was gone?\u2019\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing serious. They weren\u2019t injured, and since their identities are clear, they\u2019ll be released soon.\u201dWith that, Oh Hanhyun glanced at the bench, where Kim Hajin was panting.\u201c\u2026What happened to him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He came here just now and suddenly collapsed.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dOh Hanhyun approached him and placed his hand on his forehead.It was hot.\u201cBabe, can you take a look at him?\u201d\u201c\u2026Babe?\u201dChae Nayun grimaced. Oh Hanhyun smiled somewhat embarrassedly, then the \u2018babe\u2019 standing next to him stepped up.\u201cI introduced her before, right? She\u2019s my girlfriend, Natasha.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah, um, that\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d**Father\u2019s face suddenly popped up. His black hair carried a few strands of grey.It was a face from 8 years ago, or perhaps even longer before.It was the once in a lifetime trial and task that every high school senior in Korea had to face \u2013 the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT).I had bombed the test magnificently.I must have expected it before I even took the exam, as I told my parents, who insisted on coming to pick me up, to stay home.Mom and Dad said yes and returned home.After the exam ended, I trudged to the school gate. It was then that I saw him.\u2014Hajin.Father was looking at me with a warm smile. Riding the same car he had used for 10 years, he was looking at me with an aged face.I immediately broke out into tears because I felt sorry.Father had never once consoled me before, but on that day, he patted my back and said just two words.\u2014It\u2019s okay.\u201c\u2026Is he okay?\u201dThe voice that overlapped with Father\u2019s must be Chae Nayun\u2019s.I opened my eyes.\u201cAh, he just woke up. Eh? He\u2019s crying?\u201dChae Nayun pointed at me as she snickered. I raised my hand and touched my eyes. It was wet.\u201cDid it hurt that much? What, did you catch an illness?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnnoyed, I glared at Chae Nayun. Was it because of the dream? I didn\u2019t feel too good.\u201cW-What?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just get back.\u201dThankfully, Kim Suho pulled Chae Nayun away from me.I raised my head and looked out the window. It was already dark outside.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dA Caucasian woman asked as she looked down at me. It was probably Oh Hanhyun\u2019s girlfriend.\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay\u2026\u201d\u201cYou collapsed from light exhaustion.\u201dI nodded. It would have been weird if I were fine. I had instantly used up two streaks of Stigma and had even raced to the Eiffel Tower like a madman. Not to mention, I took the most roundabout way to avoid people\u2019s gazes.\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your room. You\u2019ll be sharing it with Kim Suho-ssi.\u201dThe woman\u2019s voice was soft and gentle, making me trust her instinctively.\u2026This was why you couldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201cThe large mansion that\u2019s supposed to be our lodging?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s already 10 at night. They said they would prepare dinner if you want.\u201d10 at night.Thankfully, I managed to wake up before the incident broke out.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dI turned down the offer for a late dinner, and the woman nodded with a smile.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going. Come with me, Nayun-ssi.\u201d\u201cEh? Why me?\u201d\u201cThis is the men\u2019s room.\u201dAfter packing up a thermometer and an icepack, the woman left the room with Chae Nayun.Only then did I have time to look around the room.It was a fairly large room with two beds and plenty of antique furniture.So I would be sharing this room with Kim Suho\u2026.\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201dKim Suho asked. I turned my wandering eyes to Kim Suho. He was wearing a gentle smile.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was\u2026 awkward.Without saying anything else, I was about to lie down on the bed when I suddenly recalled what happened just a few hours ago.I wanted to ask Kim Suho about what I missed, but I had to calm myself first. I was the one who destroyed the castle. As the perpetrator, I had to be careful about what I said.I picked up my smartwatch, which sat on a shelf next to the bed. I immediately looked up the news.[Djinn appears in a Paris castle! Cube\u2019s cadets coincidentally present\u2026]Perhaps because Cube\u2019s cadets were involved, the news spread fast.I read through the entire report.Thankfully, no one was killed or critically injured. It was also reported that Djinns had demolished the castle.Fantastic.It seemed Jain managed to get away as nothing about her was written on the report.I swallowed the sense of relief rising from the depths of my heart.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dI projected the report I was reading so Kim Suho could see. Clearly, I was asking him if he knew anything about it.\u201cOh, that?\u201dHe took the bait instantly.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything in detail, but nothing major happened. The Djinns all ran away before the Heroes arrived too.\u201d\u201cMm, that\u2019s a relief.\u201dWith that, silence descended once again. Kim Suho must have been bored as he cut an apple and gave it to me. I took it without saying anything.Crunch, crunch.Tick, tock.The sound of me biting the apple and a ticking clock filled the room.A bleak wind swept against the window.Feeling uncomfortable by the awkward atmosphere, I looked out the window. The moon was hiding behind clouds.Currently, it was 10:15.In just 2 hours, \u2018that incident\u2019 would occur.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dBut it seemed Kim Suho had no plans to leave the chair by my bed. I glanced at him uncomfortably. Then, I discovered a faint scar on his cheek. It was likely from when he stopped Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s attack.\u201c\u2026Take care of your body more.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKim Suho sounded confused. I pointed at the scar on his cheek.\u201cYou\u2019re the main character. You can\u2019t get too hurt.\u201dKim Suho was the main character, the one I created myself. But today, he charged at Yun Seung-Ah fearlessly. In other words, he was almost killed.Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s killing intent was real. If the Djinn appeared a little bit later, Kim Suho might have lost a limb.Of course, I understood why he did what he did. After all, he was the main character who walked on the path of righteousness.However, I had doubts.Whether the main character who only pursued righteousness could end this story, whether he could overcome this twisted story with only his sense of justice.And\u2026Whether he could send me home.\u201cMain character? There is no such thing.\u201dKim Suho shook his head. He must have heard these words before from people who mocked him sarcastically. I remembered it too.\u2014Does he think he\u2019s some sort of a main character?Shin Jonghak often liked to say this.\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cOf course. If I\u2019m a main character, you\u2019re one too. No, everyone in this world is a main character.\u201dThe main character said so.What he must have said thoughtlessly touched me in a meaningful way. I pondered over his words silently.\u201c\u2026By the way.\u201dAt that moment, Kim Suho, who was staring at me fixedly, carefully spoke up. He seemed to be hesitating. Considering how needlessly nervous he was, this must be what he really wanted to ask me.\u201cGo on, tell me.\u201d\u201c\u2026The report you wrote for Chae Nayun, I saw it too. You were a bit harsh.\u201dFor the record, the report I wrote on Chae Nayun received an A-. Although my criticisms were valid, me telling her to give up on the bow was deemed too harsh, dropping the grade from an A+ to an A-.\u201cI wasn\u2019t harsh. Chae Nayun isn\u2019t a borne archer. She needs to drop the bow and pick up the sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that why you made that bet with Chae Nayun?\u201d\u201cYeah. If I win, I\u2019m going to make her give up her bow. She said she\u2019d do anything.\u201dAt my determined reply, Kim Suho\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cBut it\u2019s the path she chose. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something someone else should decide for her.\u201dHe was both stern and soft at the same time.I stared at him, and he stared back at me. His eyes were shining brightly with his own will.His thoughts were different than mine.But that didn\u2019t mean he was wrong.\u201c\u2026Then do you want me to encourage and console her, fully knowing that she\u2019s walking to a dead-end?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201dWithout giving a chance for a rebuttal, I continued.\u201cYou can\u2019t succeed just by hearing encouraging words. What if you reach a dead-end after endlessly toiling away? What if the only thing waiting at the end is a greater despair? Will you take responsibility?\u201dWhen I finished, Kim Suho let out a sigh. His breath was full of heat. He then spoke in a low voice as though he was angry.\u201cHow can you be so sure that Chae Nayun isn\u2019t talented with bows, but swords? Are you saying all this because you can take responsibility?\u201dIn Kim Suho\u2019s perspective, what he said was completely justified. Chae Nayun had trained for countless hours using the bow, but someone who seemingly wasn\u2019t close to her was telling her to give it up.But I was angry.Chae Nayun was someone I created with affection.Her appearance, her personality, and even her tiniest hobbies and trauma were my creation. Of course, a few things had changed, but still\u2026\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve been thinking about her for far longer than you\u2026 And I\u2019ve been watching over her all this time.\u201dEven if Kim Suho was this world\u2019s main character, there was no one else in this entire world who knew Chae Nayun better than me.\u201cSo I know far more about her than you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026What?\u201dA strange light flickered in Kim Suho\u2019s eyes.When we were staring at each other in silence\u2026\u2014ThudBoth Kim Suho and I heard a faint sound coming from the other side of the door.I immediately looked through the wall.The person running away with a flushed face\u2026 was Chae Nayun.I didn\u2019t know from when, but she must have been eavesdropping on our conversation.A good archer needed to be skilled in \u2018stealth\u2019.If anything, she learned that one thing well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Change of Heart (2)Chae Nayun slammed the door to her room close, then jumped on her bed.At first, she was going to simply ask the guys out for a night time snack. But when she was about to knock on their door, she heard them having an interesting conversation and ended up eavesdropping instead.\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking about her for far longer than you and I\u2019ve been watching over her all this time. So I know far more about her than you.It was the first time she had heard something so direct. It was partly because few men were confident enough to approach her, and it was also because she blocked such situations from happening.\u201cIs he really crazy?\u201dWhat Kim Hajin said still lingered by her ears.\u2018Should I wash my ears? Or should I have gone in there and smacked his head?\u2019 Chae Nayun bounced around on her bed while striking it repeatedly.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u2026?\u201dAnd Chae Nayun\u2019s seemingly drunk act woke up Yoo Yeonha who was sleeping peacefully.\u201cNayun\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d\u201cH-Huh?\u201dChae Nayun flinched.Yoo Yeonha glared at Chae Nayun with narrowed eyes. Why was this woman beating up a poor bedsheet?\u201cAre you sick or something?\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing.\u201dChae Nayun couldn\u2019t tell her what she had just heard. She couldn\u2019t even imagine telling someone about such personal matters.\u201c\u2026Then sleep. I\u2019m tired.\u201dMuttering so, Yoo Yeonha plopped back down on her back.\u201cUh, yeah, good night. I\u2019m going to sleep too.\u201dChae Nayun also buried herself under her blanket.\u2018Right, it doesn\u2019t matter. I only overheard it anyways. Regardless of what Kim Hajin\u2019s intentions were, I just have to ignore it.\u2019With such thoughts, Chae Nayun pulled the blanket over her head.But for some reason, she couldn\u2019t fall asleep.Thinking about her\u2026 Watching over her all this time \u2026Fragments of Kim Hajin\u2019s words kept wandering around her head.\u2018Watching over me all this time? Is he a stalker? No, if he is, there\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t have noticed him.\u2019A sharpshooter\u2019s senses were extremely sharp. A stalker was someone who secretly took pictures, followed women late at night, and things like that\u2026Kyaaaak\u2014!!Suddenly, a high-pitched voice rang out in the mansion. Chae Nayun opened her eyes abruptly and shot up.\u201cW-What!? Ah, aaak!\u201dYoo Yeonha also got up in shock, tripping on her bedsheet and falling down. With her hands on the floor, she glared at Chae Nayun resentfully.\u201cChae Nayun! Y-You!\u201d\u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t me this time!\u201d\u201cThen who was it!?\u201d\u201c\u2026Outside.\u201dChae Nayun turned the lights on. Just at that moment, lights shone through from under the room, signaling that the lights in the hallway turned on. At the same time, they could hear loud footsteps running around. Yoo Yeonha finally understood the gravity of the situation.\u201cWas that a real scream?\u201d\u201cYeah. Hurry up, we should go.\u201dChae Nayun put on a jacket.**Kim Suho ran out of the room the moment the scream rang out. I was just about to follow him when I noticed something and stopped.Sitting on the shelf was a white handgun. Right, it was my Desert Eagle. I couldn\u2019t put it away because I didn\u2019t have any magic power left, but it seemed someone had taken care of it for me.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe handgun\u2019s figure struck me with a flash of inspiration.\u201cWith this\u2026 No.\u201dI quickly cast the thought away, but it kept coming back to me.What Kim Suho told me lingered in my ears.\u2014If I\u2019m the main character, you are one too.Unpredictability.Because I was afraid of this, I was trying my best to stay away from altering the original story.But even if I didn\u2019t think too deeply, I could see that the story was already altered by a certain damned guy.Right, this world was already full of unpredictability. Worrying about it was foolish.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out somehow.\u201dAfter fighting off my hesitation, I picked up my gun.Then, I quickly ran down the hallway to the mansion owner\u2019s room.The other 14 members of the traveling club were all standing by the door with shocked expressions.\u201cT-This\u2026\u201dIn a dark room larger than six ordinary living rooms put together, the mansion owner was lying on his bed with a dagger sticking out of his heart. In front of this horrific scene, a maid was sobbing traumatically. Presumably, she was the one who first discovered the scene.\u201cBedel-ssi\u2026\u201dKim Suho muttered Belbet\u2019s false name. I could understand why everyone was so shocked. During dinner, Belbet must have talked to them like a kind grandfather next door, trying to draw their sympathy by saying stupid things like, \u2018my son who died before me also wanted to become a Hero.\u2019\u201cWait. Let, let me confirm what state he\u2019s in.\u201dWhile the cadets were standing in a daze from shock, Oh Hanhyun\u2019s girlfriend appeared.Natasha the doctor. I closely scrutinized her movements. She slowly approached Belbet and checked his pulse. Then, she shook her head.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s gone.\u201dShe closed Belbet\u2019s eyes, who died with his eyes open, then returned to Oh Hanhyun\u2019s side. It was laughable seeing her pretend to be sad as she leaned against his shoulder.\u201cW-What happened\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the head butler ran into the room.Now, he would break out into tears, talking about all the fake good deeds Belbet has done and reiterating the threats and attempted murder Belbet received from supposed evildoers.I originally planned on letting the story continue as it did in my novel, but I no longer had the desire to watch this farce.Belbet was supposed to become a schemer who used his shrewd brain to help out Djinns. Because of the nature of his character, I didn\u2019t know what he would do if left alone.If possible, it was better to get rid of him now.\u201cS-So they did it! Those bastards\u2026\u201d\u201cCalm down, head butler.\u201dWhile the cadets were busy consoling the sobbing maid and butler, I turned the lights on. Immediately, the room became bright.\u201cHey, why did you turn on the light!?\u201dSeeing the scene of a murder and the bloody corpse, Chae Nayun shouted in surprise.I glanced around the room before slowly walking up to Belbet.\u201cExcuse me! Don\u2019t get close!\u201dNatasha shouted hastily. Ignoring her, I put on an act of examining Belbet\u2019s face and state. I lifted up his clothes to check his wound and pressed down on the bloody bed. Simply put, I was acting like a detective.\u201cYou can\u2019t mess up the scene of the crime before the police arrive\u2026\u201dUnable to endure it any longer, Natasha came over to drag me away. However, I pulled out my gun from my pocket and aimed it at her.\u201cDon\u2019t come close.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dNatasha raised her hand in shock, while the butler, who was crying only a moment ago, shot up and shouted.\u201cW-What are you doing!?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t only the butler. The cadets gathered here also shouted the same thing.Facing their loud voices directly, I began to get a headache. Was it because I just woke up from exhaustion? I suddenly felt irritated. Gritting my teeth, I shouted.\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP!\u201dEven I was surprised by how loud I was. Silence descended immediately.I let out a sigh, then continued calmly.\u201cThis person is trying to trick us. He\u2019s not dead. He\u2019s in what\u2019s called a state of suspended animation.\u201d\u201cD-Don\u2019t be stupid. I\u2019m a doctor. What do you know about\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to explain, so shut up and wait.\u201dI continued with my gun still pointing at Natasha.\u201cFirst, this scar is too unnatural. It\u2019s too shallow for someone to have stabbed him from above.\u201dI just reported what I observed and concluded from the scene. I wasn\u2019t an expert in crime scene investigation, so I could be wrong in all honesty. But since I knew the truth, the process didn\u2019t really matter.\u201cNext, there\u2019s too much blood. He only has one fatal injury to his heart, but the blood is covering this huge bed and even dripping down to the floor. Almost as if to emphasize that this man was dead.\u201dI stole a glance at Natasha\u2019s expression. She didn\u2019t seem agitated yet.\u201cFinally and most importantly\u2026\u201dUsing my smartwatch, I projected the International Wanted List. I might have lied about everything else, but this was real.Belbet, the conman.Although he looked thinner in the photo, the man lying dead on the bed looked similar to the man in the photo.At this point, the cadets were shaken up.\u201cOf course, you can argue that they\u2019re different people since the man in the photo is so much thinner, but if taking the other two clues into account, you have to think something\u2019s up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Head butler, you called the police and ambulance, right?\u201dHowever, Natasha was still calm.The butler quickly retorted to Natasha\u2019s question.\u201cY-Yes, I called them.\u201d\u201cThen we can just ask them instead of making a fuss like that man.\u201dI couldn\u2019t let that happen. Once the bribed police and medical personnel came, Belbet would escape this place safely.I had to resolve the situation before then.With a grin, I moved my gun away from Natasha, pointing at Belbet. Only then did Natasha begin to lose her composure.\u201cW-What are you doing!?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m going to shoot him.\u201d\u201cThe police will be here soon!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s dead anyway, right?\u201dI put my finger on the trigger.\u201cT-This scoundrel! Honey, stop him!\u201dNatasha shook Oh Hanhyun and urged him to step in.The head butler, Belbet, and Natasha.They were all on the same boat.\u201cUm, Hajin\u2026\u201dOh Hanhyun spoke up carefully.\u201cIf you move even a single step, I\u2019ll shoot. Especially you, Kim Suho. I\u2019m only looking at you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Got it.\u201dKim Suho, who was slowly approaching me, stopped and raised his hands.I also made the other cadets back off. Then, I spoke to Natasha.\u201cIt\u2019s loaded with real bullets.\u201d\u201cWe already called the police! Put that gun down!\u201dNatasha was trembling with her entire body. Her reaction should be enough of a proof, but I still needed something more decisive.\u201cIf you don\u2019t confess by the time I countdown to one, I\u2019m going to shoot. Since he\u2019s dead, it doesn\u2019t matter, right?\u201d\u201cConfess what!? He\u2019s already dead!\u201dI began to count.\u201cThree.\u201dI diverted my focus to the cadets in case anyone of them would try to do something stupid.\u201cTwo.\u201dBut contrary to my expectations, Kim Suho stayed calm, while the usually timid Oh Hanhyun tried to operate his magic power.At that moment, someone stepped in and stopped him.\u201cWait.\u201dIt was Yoo Yeonha.Thanks to her, I could finish my countdown.\u201cOne.\u201dNatasha still didn\u2019t react.\u201cThen he\u2019ll have to die.\u201dClick.I pulled the trigger.\u201cNO!\u201dIt was just that it wasn\u2019t loaded.But Natasha, who wasn\u2019t aware of this, quickly ran up to me and pushed me aside. Then, she prostrated on top of Belbet as if to protect him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t shoot! Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dI calmly put my gun down. This was enough proof.Natasha was Belbet\u2019s daughter. The reason Belbet, who was constantly on the run, settled in France and how he managed to bring Cube\u2019s cadets were all thanks to Natasha.\u201cInstead of the police, call the Hero Association. Tell them we caught a wanted criminal.\u201dWith that, I loaded my gun, then fired. The magic bullet grazed the leg of the butler who was running away.\u201cAaak!\u201dAfter that short scream, only silence remained.Feeling the other cadet\u2019s gazes, I walked outside.My heart was beating crazily.**The assassination incident was a plot devised by Belbet and Natasha. Belbet was a wanted criminal in practically all European countries, and he had formulated this plan to avoid their narrowing investigation. His daughter had coincidentally seduced a pushover cadet from Cube, bearing the plan to fruition.The so-called operation Return to Life.Though expensive, there was a medicine that could place someone in a temporary state of suspended animation. As a doctor who was a part of Cube, Natasha could easily get her hands on one.Everything afterward was supposed to be simple.Belbet would take the medicine after receiving a fake injury with the help of a fellow conman magician, and spray the crime scene with blood packs. The emergency medical personnel wouldn\u2019t be able to tell apart suspended animation from death, and Belbet had already bribed out a local Paris police branch.Next, during the ambulance ride, Belbet would swap himself with the corpse of a man who looked similar and had the same build.Afterward, Cube\u2019s cadets would take care of the testimony. Cube\u2019s cadets carried one of the greatest levels of trust on the planet.The government workers he bribed would then ensure he was officially dead, and the real Belbet would be reborn under a new name.All this was something Kim Suho would find out in the future.But now, I had completely destroyed parts of the story related to Belbet. Belbet was arrested while he was still in a state of suspended animation. When he woke up, he would find himself in jail.[Belbet, the man you requested to find has been arrested by the French police and is currently being transported to a local Hero Association branch.][Congratulations! As you are our first customer, this question was answered free of charge.]Currently, it was 9 A.M in the morning.Crouched down on the ground, I replied to Belbet\u2019s victim, who had asked about him on Truth Agency.\u201c\u2026Are you Sherlock?\u201dAt that moment, a voice rang out.It was Yoo Yeonha. I smiled without answering her.In truth, what I said last night was an amateurish deduction at best. But because of the unexpected situation they were in, no one had thought deeply about what I said.But surprisingly and perhaps thanks to luck, the investigation revealed what I said to be mostly correct.\u201cThe incident with Yun Hyun and now this. You might as well open up a detective agency.\u201d\u201cSharpshooters have good eyes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but how did you recognize him? Do you have the faces of wanted criminals memorized?\u201dI flinched. As expected of Yoo Yeonha, she sharply pointed out one of the flaws in my action.\u201cI apologize. That\u2019s a private matter.\u201d[1]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat was all I could tell her.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the sudden polite speech\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha retorted bluntly, then made a meaningful expression. \u2018Family matter, family matter\u2026\u2019 She seemed to be wandering off to her own world of imaginations. At this point, I wasn\u2019t even curious what misunderstanding she was cooking up.But speaking of family affair, I suddenly got curious about my own.To be more precise, about Kim Chundong\u2019s family. All I knew from reading his official record was that he was from an orphanage.It was probably worth looking into once I got home.1. The word, private matter, can also mean family matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Vestige (1)Evil Society was one of the most notorious Djinn associations in the world, being officially recognized by the UN and the Hero Association as the number 1 wanted group. Although there were groups that were more vicious and wicked than Evil Society, the latter was just too widely known throughout the world.But that didn\u2019t mean that someone purposely spread their name. Their notoriety was the result of their evil doings. They caused countless incidents in countries all over the world. From the Artifact Scramble incident in China to the Suwon Battle in Korea, they participated in human-Djinn wars of every scale.\u201cSay that again.\u201dEvil Society\u2019s hideout was surprisingly not far away.In an artificial cave under Russia\u2019s Vladivostok waters was the hideout Evil Society has kept secret for over 40 years. As the years went by, the technological advances made the cave a state-of-the-art facility that looked nothing like a cave.\u201cMy apologies.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize. I said to say that again, Silasen. You said\u2026 a cheetah messed with our plan?\u201d\u201cNo, it was a panther. Um, a man wearing a panther mask.\u201dArtifact retrieval was Evil Society\u2019s first and foremost task. In the first place, they were an organization formed by devils to steal artifacts.Homer\u2019s Ring was the artifact that Kim Hakpyo, Evil Society\u2019s artifact retrieval team leader, desperately wanted.This ring of wisdom amplified all abilities related to magic power, such as magic power control, adaptability, and materialization. It was an incredibly useful artifact for Djinns who had abnormally high amounts of magic power.\u201cYou mean a panther that looks like this?\u201dKim Hakpyo showed a sketch of the masked man depicted according to Silasen\u2019s description.\u201c\u2026Yes. He wasn\u2019t an ordinary individual.\u201d\u201cI know. I heard you lost a subordinate.\u201d\u201cYes, we lost Sidius. From what we observed from his life clock, he seems to have been killed in one blow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSidius. Although he had a weak defense, because of his superb swordsmanship, his attack power was something even Kim Hakpyo acknowledged. He was supposed to be capable of handling up to low-intermediate rank Heroes, making him one of the organization\u2019s rising stars.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a Djinn?\u201dIt was surprisingly common for Djinns to kill each other.\u201cNo, but he didn\u2019t seem to be a Hero either.\u201d\u201cThen he must be a mercenary or a hunter. Look into it. Of course, don\u2019t think about confronting him alone even if you find him.\u201dHomer\u2019s Ring was something Kim Hakpyo vowed to obtain when he heard about it from the Collector. And when it came to his vows, he had no intention of breaking them.\u201cHis weapon?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cSidius\u2019 magic sword, it\u2019s expensive. Did you retrieve it?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 no.\u201dMagic swords were created by humanity but could display the same power as an artifact depending on one\u2019s magic power. Naturally, it was extremely costly. Low-rank artifacts went for 500 million won, and naturally, so did magic swords.\u201cI see. That makes sense. Someone who knew to take the ring wouldn\u2019t have missed something that expensive.\u201dKim Hakpyo accepted the reality. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t take 500 million won lying on the ground.His anger then turned to Silasen.\u201cBy the way, why are you announcing to the world that you\u2019re a Djinn?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cYour god damn appearance.\u201dKim Hakpyo pointed at Silasen, who was still maintaining a Djinn\u2019s black skin and blood-red pupils.\u201cI\u2019m asking WHY you\u2019re revealing that you\u2019re a GOD DAMN DJINN!\u201dKim Hakpyo\u2019s fury resounded, shaking the cave\u2019s interior. Silasen quickly turned back to normal.\u201cM-My apologies!\u201dIn truth, he had just made an honest mistake of forgetting to put his disguise back on. After Devil Transformation, Djinns looked completely different from humans, so they had to put on a disguise to hide that they were Djinns.However, the Djinns\u2019 society wasn\u2019t so lenient when it came to mistakes.Silasen fell to his knees in a hurry.**\u201c\u2026What am I supposed to do with this?\u201dSunday night.I pondered as I examined the magic sword I picked up. It was a spoil of war I obtained from defeating a Djinn, but it was completely useless to me. Not only was I unable to wield magic power like normal people, I also didn\u2019t have plans to use a sword which required me to fight in close range.Of course, I would be able to sell it for a vast amount of money, but even if Violet Banquet guaranteed my anonymity, I felt uneasy about a Djinn buying it.So for now, I put the magic sword away in my drawer.\u201cAnd what do I do with this?\u201dThis time, it was Homer\u2019s Ring. Because it hasn\u2019t been awakened yet, it looked shabby as though it was forged with mud, but in reality, this ring was quite a unique artifact.===[Homer\u2019s Ring] [Artifact] [Unawakened]A ring worn by Homer in the past.Contains hidden abilities.===Awakening this artifact would be easy for a Djinn, but it was a bit tricky for me. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t need to use the normal method for awakening this artifact.Using my Setting Intervention, I just deleted the \u201cun-\u201d part of \u201cunawakened\u201d.[49 SP will be used.]It didn\u2019t require too much SP, likely because the method for awakening the ring was rather simple. You just had to put in a certain amount of magic power, probably about 1.5 times the amount Chae Nayun currently had.Once I saved the setting, the surface of Homer\u2019s Ring cracked and split. A beautiful platinum colored ring appeared from beneath the dirt husk.===[Homer\u2019s Ring] [Artifact] [Awakened]A ring worn by Homer in the past.Resonates with nature and endows its wearer with clear energy.\u300cIntelligence Increase \u2013 increases the wearer\u2019s intelligence by 0.001 points every 24 hours up to a maximum of 0.365 points.\u300d\u300cHigh rank magic power amplification\u300d\u300cCamouflage\u300d===Homer\u2019s Ring not only amplified its wearer\u2019s magic power, it also increased \u2018intelligence\u2019, an invariable stat. Since the intelligence increase had a limit, one only needed to wear it for a year to receive its maximum benefit. 0.365 points of intelligence was equivalent to about 7 IQ.\u201cI guess I need to hold onto it for at least a year.\u201dHomer\u2019s Ring wasn\u2019t a binding item. If I gave it away after increasing my intelligence for 365 days, the intelligence I gained from it wouldn\u2019t disappear.At the same time, it was inefficient for me to continue holding onto it. The source of my magic power wasn\u2019t Kim Hajin, but the Stigma drawn on my upper arm. Obviously, there was no way to equip the Stigma with the ring.\u2026But just in case, I tried rubbing the ring on my upper arm.\u201c\u2026What am I doing.\u201dI put it back on my finger.Homer\u2019s Ring better suited Kim Suho and Chae Nayun. Purely in terms of efficiency, Chae Nayun was the best candidate as she beat Kim Suho in magic power.\u201cNow\u2026\u201dFor the first time in some time, I checked my stats.===[Strength 2.56][Stamina 2.575][Speed 3.250][Perception 4.215][Vitality 2.665][Magic power 1.925]===The stats other than speed and perception had stopped growing.I had reached a wall. A wall referred to a bottleneck in growth. The first wall was between 2 and 3, the next was between 4 and 5, the next was between 6 and 7, and so on.Most people faced these walls on every 2 stat points, and cadets usually had their upper limit around the 12 to 13 area.\u201cMy magic power isn\u2019t going up at all.\u201dIt was likely that my magic power would stay at that level forever, but that didn\u2019t discourage me in any way. After all, my magic power came from my Stigma.Next, I saw some encouraging alerts.[You managed to throw a weapon that is difficult to wield!][Beginner\u2019s Luck applies! Your wire throwing accuracy and power increases.][Your Gift, Master Sharpshooter, becomes grade 6!]===\u25b7\u300cMaster Sharpshooter\u300d[Intermediate rank] [Spirit attribute] [Evolving \u2014 Grade 6] [Proficiency EXP 0%]\u2014Master Sharpshooter\u2019s Training*Can wield all long ranged weapons more skillfully.\u2014Thousand-Mile Eyes*Can see far away and predict a target\u2019s movement path well.*Increases speed and perception by 1 point.\u2014Bullet Time*In combat only and once every 24 hours, you can spend up to 80 seconds in \u2018Bullet Time\u2019.\u2014Sharpshooter of Reversal*Depending on Kim Hajin\u2019s invariable stat, \u2018luck\u2019, you can deal bonus damage against a stronger opponent.===Master Sharpshooter finally evolved from low-intermediate rank to intermediate rank.It was faster than I expected, but the Gift\u2019s real growth was only now beginning.Most likely, the same amount of effort I put in to go from grade 10 to grade 6 would be needed to go from grade 6 to grade 5.\u201cWith this, I should be able to beat Chae Nayun.\u201dMurmuring, I was about to close the laptop when I suddenly remembered something.\u201c\u2026I almost forgot.\u201dMy family, or to be more precise, Kim Chundong\u2019s family.It was unlikely that the co-author left Kim Chundong\u2019s past in a blank slate, especially when it was the easiest setting he could modify.I immediately grew curious.Kim Chundong was admitted to Cube. Although he was an extra in my novel, in the real world, he would have been an elite. Furthermore, genes played a huge role in determining one\u2019s Gift. In other words, Kim Chundong\u2019s parents weren\u2019t likely to be ordinary people.I entered Violet Banquet.Tak, tak.\u00a0From the numerous available categories, I clicked on [detective agency].[100% trustworthy information agency, \u2018Veteran\u2019.][Information agency, \u2018Echo\u2019. Anything you want to know is at our disposal.]There were several sellers, but agencies displayed on banner ads weren\u2019t top tier agencies. After all, well-known and self-confident agencies didn\u2019t need to advertise their product.The real deal was here.[Private Broker Yoo Jinhyuk]Yoo Jinhyuk. This man was the best of the best in this field.When it came to individuals in particular, there was nothing he couldn\u2019t find out. Naturally, his service was extremely expensive. Just his base price was 50 million won.\u201c\u2026Oh right.\u201dI was about to put in a request when I remembered something.\u201cI don\u2019t have money.\u201dI had already invested everything I had into stocks.Wiing\u2014!At that moment, something sitting on my drawer began to vibrate.Once again, it was Evandel\u2019s Seed.The tiny seed even stood up vertically and shook its body. It was protesting that it was hungry.\u201cI know, I know.\u201dI took out a new gauze and gave it to the seed.**[Monday 1 P.M.]The eventful weekend passed and a new Monday came by.Rather than Monday\u2019s usual class, the exam we couldn\u2019t complete was continued today. Thus, cadets met in the exam room from two weeks ago. While groups 14 to 25 took the exam, other cadets were busy writing their reports.\u2018Family affair\u2026\u2019However, only Yoo Yeonha was immersed in thoughts completely irrelevant to the exam.Family affair.What Kim Hajin said the day before kept bothering her.Kim Hajin had immediately recognized Belbet\u2019s face, but it didn\u2019t make sense for him to know Belbet\u2019s face out of numerous criminals.From her research, she found out that Belbet was a conman who worked exclusively in Europe. In other words, he couldn\u2019t have had anything to do with Kim Hajin. It made more sense to conclude that Kim Hajin memorized the face of every international wanted criminal.\u2018But why\u2026\u2019After thinking about Kim Hajin\u2019s strange obsession with wanted criminals, Yoo Yeonha came up with a hypothesis.A horrible thing had happened to him in the past, but he didn\u2019t know who the culprit was. So to find the culprit, he had the International Wanted List memorized.Of course, this was only a hypothesis.But\u2026\u2018Orphan.\u2019Adding in another keyword, the hypothesis became more logical.Kim Hajin didn\u2019t have parents. That was something almost every cadet knew because Shin Jonghak\u2019s lackeys often harassed him as a parentless bastard.\u2018So that must mean\u2026\u2019Kim Hajin\u2019s parents were dead. No, they were killed. Because of this, Kim Hajin had memorized the faces of criminals and was hiding his power to find and kill the culprit.It made sense.Yoo Yeonha added another keyword to her notes.\u2018Sad past\u2019\u201cYeonha, what are you writing?\u201dChae Nayun suddenly asked at that moment. She peeked at Yoo Yeonha\u2019s notes with tired eyes as though she just woke up from a nap.\u201cFamily affair? Orphan? Sad past? \u2026Are you adopted?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you crazy? I\u2019m just curious about something.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026. Well, I guess you\u2019ve always been curious about random things. You know, you always tenaciously dig up things you can just ignore without gaining anything. You\u2019re kind of a dunce. No, you are a dunce.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to sleep, just keep sleeping, Nayun.\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke as she gritted her teeth. Chae Nayun let out a big yawn, then leaned against the back of her chair.\u201cHuaam~ Yeah, I should.\u201dThe heckler went away, and Yoo Yeonha fell back into the boundary of delusion and thought.If Kim Hajin really had a past like that, she felt she could use it as an advantage when trying to recruit him in the future.It was illegal to investigate a cadet\u2019s background, but that just meant she had to avoid being caught.That was how much she wanted to bring Kim Hajin into her guild. With the last incident, she became even more convinced. Kim Hajin was perhaps even more valuable than Kim Suho. At least, that\u2019s what Yoo Yeonha thought.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSomeone that could investigate Kim Hajin\u2019s family background.She knew of one such person. If he wanted, he could even draw up the family tree of a cockroach.The only question was whether he would help her.\u201c\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha turned her smartwatch on.On the bottom of her contacts list, a number she had kept sealed for the past 5 years was printed.[Uncle Yoo Jinhyuk]Yoo Yeonha closed her eyes tightly and sent him a message.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Vestige (2)\u2014Ding\u201cAh, god damn it!\u201dThe sudden smartwatch message clogged up the game screen at a crucial moment. Yoo Jinhyuk roared and shot up like a spring.\u201cWhat, you lost again?\u201dHis secretary asked apathetically.\u201cNo, but hey! Did you link my smartwatch with the computer?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou did! I lost because of the alert!\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk grabbed the back of his neck, feeling blood pressure rising. He had just lost 50 million won from that loss.\u201cMy life\u2026 What?\u201dBut his sullen mood disappeared in an instant when he saw the name of the messenger \u2013 Yoo Yeonha.It was the name of his adorable niece.\u201cDid the sun rise from the west today? My niece just messaged me!\u201dIf he remembered correctly, the last time they had talked was five years ago. Yoo Jinhyuk quickly checked the content of the message.[Uncle, I need you to look into someone\u2019s family history.]Yoo Jinhyuk tilted his head.\u201cMm? Well, that\u2019s surprising.\u201d\u201cIs it work?\u201dHis secretary\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cNo, I told you it\u2019s from my niece.\u201d\u201cSo is it work?\u201d\u201c\u2026I guess it is. Huaaam.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk yawned and slumped down on his couch. Yoo Yeonha sent a follow-up message.[Cube\u2019s cadet, Kim Hajin.]\u201cKim Hajin\u2026 Who\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d\u201cLook into him. He\u2019s apparently a Cube cadet.\u201d\u201cIs he?\u201dThe number of Cube cadets was at most 6000 in any given year. Given such a small pool, finding someone was a piece of cake for someone in their line of business. The secretary\u2019s hands moved like lightning on her computer keyboard.Soon, a general overview of the cadet in question popped up.\u201cHe\u2019s an orphan. He has a 300 million won debt.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s why she said family affair. She must want to know who his parents are. Also, he has that much debt?\u201d\u201cYes. He also has a brokerage account. I don\u2019t know how much he has in it though.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk murmured as he picked his earwax.\u201cWell if it\u2019s only that, I guess I can do it for free.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ehew, there goes my paycheck.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to get your pay. Honestly, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re taking too much? 20 million won per month for god\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m worth that much.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk clicked his tongue as he berated his secretary. Then, he suddenly shot up.\u201cGet ready.\u201d\u201cAre you really going to do it for free?\u201d\u201cYeah, I have a favor I want from Hyung anyways.\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dThe usually uptight secretary was immediately convinced.There was one reason why Yoo Jinhyuk was the best in this field.\u201cIs it 16, 17 years ago? Let\u2019s start from the day he was born.\u201dHe could experience people\u2019s past.**On her way back to the dorm from classes, Yoo Yeonha pouted as she stared at her smartwatch. Three hours had passed since she messaged her uncle but there was no reply. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t read it since her message was clearly marked with \u201cread\u201d. In other words, he had ignored her.\u201c\u2026Why isn\u2019t he answering?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s he? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t tell me, you got a b-boyfriend?\u201dChae Nayun who was next to her asked, looking shocked. Yoo Yeonha glanced at her. For some reason, Chae Nayun recently began to act oddly friendly. Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t know how to feel about it. Chae Nayun used to be aloof and uncaring in the past, so she couldn\u2019t figure out why she was acting this way.\u201cI\u2019m going out with Jonghak.\u201d\u201cThe whole world knows that\u2019s a lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ehew. Fine, it\u2019s my uncle.\u201d\u201cUncle?\u201dYoo Yeonha sighed, and Chae Nayun turned to the side as she snickered.\u201cYou go ahead. I have to go practice archery.\u201d\u201cArchery? \u2026Oh right, your bet with Kim Hajin is coming up.\u201d\u201cYeah, I even rented an archery range for the bet. Do you want to come spectate?\u201dIn the past weekend, Chae Nayun thought about Kim Hajin by herself and came to her own conclusion. If Kim Hajin had romantic feelings for her, she told herself that she\u2019d chastise him after winning the bet. That the way he expressed his affection was wrong and that she was better suited to a bow.\u201c\u2026Spectate?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked in interest. No matter how she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t see Chae Nayun winning. From her experience, Kim Hajin\u2019s confidence was always well-founded.\u201cYeah, I invited a bunch of people over.\u201d\u201cIs Jonghak also going?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201c\u2026He\u2019s going to bring more people.\u201dShin Jonghak would likely do things no one asked him to. To save face, he would bring ten or so cadets with him. If Kim Hajin won, Chae Nayun would be embarrassing herself in front of a large crowd.\u201cI\u2019ll use this opportunity to put him in place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha stared at Chae Nayun\u2019s confident face.Imagining her overconfident face becoming distorted with embarrassment and despair, Yoo Yeonha thought to herself to not miss the bet.\u201cI\u2019ll come watch.\u201dHappy just thinking about it, Yoo Yeonha smiled brightly.At that moment, her smartwatch rang.Yun Seung-Ah: [Let\u2019s grab lunch this weekend. I want to apologize for what happened before.]She quickly checked her smartwatch, but seeing that it wasn\u2019t Yoo Jinhyuk, she furrowed her brows in disappointed.\u201cWho is it now?\u201dChae Nayun stopped and asked again.\u201cWhy are you suddenly so curious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just wondering. Who is it? Kim Suho?\u201d\u201c\u2026Vice-leader Yun Seung-Ah.\u201d\u201cEh? Seung-Ah unni? What about her?\u201dYun Seung-Ah and Chae Nayun had a connection in that they were both disciples of the Master rank Hero, Yoo Sihyuk. Of course, that was in the past. When Chae Nayun was being taught, she was only 8 years old, while Yun Seung-Ah was 21.\u201cShe wants to apologize for what happened at the masquerade party.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, I should have gone to that party. If only I didn\u2019t get lost\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should have swapped with me. I wanted to go to that restaurant.\u201d\u201cThe place Kim Hajin took me to?\u201dYoo Yeonha nodded with a bitter smile. Although she loved fast food, the Hero Cook\u2019s cooking was something people would kill to eat.\u201cNow that I think about it, Kim Hajin must not be so simple if he can make a reservation for a place like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut this woman was only realizing this now. Yoo Yeonha let out a deep sigh in disappointment.**I went on my way while listening to the conversation of the two girls in front of me. I was a bit shocked when my name came up, but it wasn\u2019t anything important. It did surprise me that Yun Seung-Ah planned to eat with Yoo Yeonha. After all, they were destined to become competitors.Then, someone approached me from behind.When I turned around, a familiar face entered my eyes.\u201cHello.\u201dIt was Rachel. She greeted me with a slight smile.\u201cAh, yes, did something happen?\u201d\u201cHere. Thank you again for before.\u201dShe handed me a small box that could just barely fit a car key. I looked back and forth between the box and Rachel, then took the box.\u201cCan I open it now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as Rachel nodded, I opened the box. I was a bit nervous thinking it might be a real car key, but in it was a key to Cube\u2019s laundry house.\u201cAh, clothes?\u201dWith this key, I should be able to pick up a Cloth Armor of some sort.\u201cYes, defensive equipment are England\u2019s pride.\u201dWith that, she bowed and began walking to the girls\u2019 dorms. Her actions perfectly matched my description of her \u2013 \u2018Rachel dislikes talking about personal matters.\u2019I watched her leave. I could feel a royalty\u2019s elegance and grace just from the way she walked.*After picking up Rachel\u2019s gift from the laundry house, I returned to my dorm.When I took off the plastic wrap, a stylish coat emerged.\u201cWhoa.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t heavy nor light, having a perfect weight. It wasn\u2019t too long either as if it was tailored for my height.However, this wasn\u2019t a fashion item.Although it came with a certificate of quality, I checked its functionality with my laptop.===[Royal Black Coat \u2013 Jacket] [Partial Artifact]A coat created by English Royal Court\u2019s master craftsman. Patched with parts of an artifact.\u300cPinnacle grade Temperature Control\u300d\u300cLow-intermediate grade Defense\u300d\u300cCamouflage functionality\u300d\u300cForm change functionality: Coat \u2194 Jacket\u300d===Defensive equipment were rarely fully-fledged artifacts. The number of defensive equipment artifacts was far smaller than weapon artifacts, and because they were difficult for modern day people to wear, they were often cut apart and reproduced into other defensive equipment.\u2018Partial Artifact\u2019 referred to defensive equipment created in such a way.\u201c\u2026This is amazing.\u201dFurthermore, England was a country renowned for their cloth-type defensive equipment. Since this item was crafted by the English Royal Court, it had to be worth several hundred million won.I put it on. Just as I expected, it was a perfect fit.I sent Rachel a thank you message.[Thank you for the coat. I love it.]She replied immediately.[No problem \u314e\u314e Use it well ^^]\u201c\u2026She\u2019s surprisingly good at texting, huh.\u201dShe was usually expressionless and quiet, but\u2026[(~.~)]She even sent emoticons in her messages.**It was now the middle of May. Since I began attending Cube in February, it would almost be four months since I came to this world. By now, both theory classes and combat training felt like a daily routine.\u201cThe finals are coming up in 4 weeks.\u201dAt the end of the class on Friday, Kim Soohyuk made a solemn announcement. Just like he said, another exam period was coming up. The final exam period would be the final hurdle of this half of the year.\u201cWritten exams will be the same, but combat exams will be completely different.\u201dMidterms and finals were different. Unlike the midterms which had a festival-like atmosphere, finals were rigorous, serious, and cold.\u201cEverything you\u2019ve learned until now will be tested in a single exam.\u201dThe exam Kim Soohyuk was talking about wouldn\u2019t be made public until much later, but I already knew what it was.They would drop cadets off in a remote island filled with wild animals and monsters.Cadets would need to survive in this island for a week while amassing as many points as possible.Each monster would be worth one point, and cadets could also defeat other cadets to gain points.Cadets were free to form teams as they wished and were allowed to give points to others.Cadets would only find out about the content of the exam on the day of the exam itself. In other words, everyone would be dropped off in a remote island without any preparation. They would only be given two days\u2019 worth of food.But I planned on preparing for the exam thoroughly. Since most people wouldn\u2019t have even the most basic camping equipment, I would be at a massive advantage in this regard.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about safety. High-intermediate rank and high-rank Heroes will be closely watching you from the shadows.\u201dKim Soohyuk dismissed the class after intimidating everyone.\u201cNow, go back and have fun. I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201dCadets got up from their seats. I also packed my stuff to go back to my room.\u201cHey, is your practice going well? You didn\u2019t forget, right? Our bet\u2019s next week.\u201dWhen I was about to leave through the back door, Chae Nayun appeared out of nowhere and asked.She looked at me with a confident smile. At the same time, the surrounding gazes all fell on us. They were watching our psychological battle with interest.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t practice at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI can win without practice.\u201dAfter giving a cocky smile, I left the room.\u201cHey! Grr, that guy\u2026!\u201dOnly seven days remained until our archery battle.**My last interaction with Chae Nayun ended up being pointless as I saw her again soon.The hunting club had resumed. To celebrate, the hunting club\u2019s leader rented a mountain cabin and planned an overnight trip on Friday.\u201cWhy am I paired with you again\u2026\u201d\u201cHow should I know?\u201dCurrently, we were climbing a mountain. Everywhere we looked was covered in white, and a cold wind blew violently.This white world where the boundary between earth and heaven seemed faint was Northern Europe\u2019s Norway.The hunting club had come all the way here for an overnight trip.It would have been sheer lunacy were I on Earth, but in this world where Portals existed, traveling between countries was extremely easy for Cube\u2019s cadets.To be honest, I was excited about this trip.Traveling abroad was something I always wanted to do when I was on Earth, and Norway was one of the places I wanted to go.\u201cYou worked something out with the club leader again, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb. I know you pulled strings to become paired with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you out of your mind?\u201dToday\u2019s pairs were chosen by a computer program. Despite that, Chae Nayun and I being paired again had to be because of my luck. After all, Chae Nayun was the prettiest one in the club.\u201c\u2026Anyways, you keep doing things behind my back, but keep it moderate.\u201d\u201cWorry about yourself. There are plenty of traps around here because of hunters.\u201dI ignored Chae Nayun\u2019s nonsensical drivel and pointed below her. Startled, Chae Nayun stopped. There was a huge bear trap under her.\u201cOh, geez. That surprised me.\u201dCurrently, we were in the middle of the hunting club\u2019s event. To celebrate the club resuming, the traveling club was running a scavenger hunt. Flags were buried around the mountain, and written on these flags were gifts prepared by seniors who were currently active Heroes.Whiiish\u2014Suddenly, a fierce wind blew along with a flurry of snow.\u201cAah, uuu, my face feels like it\u2019s going to explode.\u201dThe wind disappeared in a moment, but Chae Nayun\u2019s face turned red from the cold.\u201cYou cold?\u201d\u201cA, a little bit. I should have brought a coat too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201dFor the record, I was wearing the coat Rachel gifted me. Thanks to its temperature control function, I wasn\u2019t a bit cold.\u201c\u2026Did you buy a new coat?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun gave me an aggrieved look. Then, we walked for a bit without talking. Our footsteps let out gentle noises as we stepped on fluffy snow. I quite enjoyed the scenery of Norway\u2019s snowy mountain.\u201cAh, over there! There\u2019s a flag.\u201dChae Nayun pointed at a nearby mountain peak. On the edge of a cliff, a single flag was waving dangerously.\u201cThat must be the first place flag.\u201dIt had to be, considering the dangerous place it was in. But would anyone be crazy enough to climb up there?\u201cHey, let\u2019s go up.\u201dThe person in question was right next to me.\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t need to.\u201dI took out a roll of wire from my pocket. It wasn\u2019t Aether Wire, but a normal roll of wire. I brought one as a supporting weapon.\u201cYou\u2019re going to throw it and pull it out? Is that even possible?\u201dWithout answering to Chae Nayun\u2019s doubt, I tied the wire around a knife. Then, I attached some of Stigma\u2019s magic power on it. Recently, I\u2019ve been thinking more about ways to use Stigma\u2019s magic power.\u201cHuup!\u201dI threw the knife in full force. The knife flew in a straight line and easily surpassed the flag\u2019s position.\u201cPft. Nice try.\u201dBut suddenly, the knife bent in a strange angle, spinning around the flag and wrapping around it. Then, it returned to my hands along with the flag.Stigma\u2019s magic power followed my will. I attached Stigma\u2019s magic power to the knife so I could move it to my will.I separated the wire and knife, put them back in my belt, and then held up the flag.\u201c\u2026N-Not bad.\u201dChae Nayun tried to sound unimpressed as she snatched the flag out of my hand. Then, the flag shrunk down to a piece of paper, which I snatched back from Chae Nayun.\u201cAh.\u201dThere were two lines written in pretty handwriting.[First place. The prize is Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s contact number. That\u2019s me! You know who I am, right? If you need any help call me any time. I\u2019ll help you out once as long as it\u2019s something I can help with~]\u201c\u2026Why is Yun Seung-Ah popping out from here?\u201d\u201cYun Seung-Ah? Address her more politely. Also, this is amazing.\u201dI was extremely disappointed, but Chae Nayun seemed happy.\u201cYou can take it then.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re giving this to me? Seung-Ah unni is the vice-leader of a rank 1 guild!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dI handed the paper to her without much thought. After all, I already had her contact number.Chae Nayun, who was about to accept it with a grin, suddenly paused and put on a serious face.\u201cNo, you take it. Why give me what\u2019s yours? I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh, yeah, sure.\u201dI was taken aback by her strange change in attitude, but I didn\u2019t say much about it for now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bet (1)It was 2 A.M. in Korea, but 7 P.M. in Norway. The two countries were in different time zones, but their skies were equally dark.Darkness descending on the snowy mountain marked the end of hunting club\u2019s event.Chae Nayun and I obtained the first place and fourth place flags. The first place flag rewarded a piece of paper with Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s one-time help coupon, and the fourth place flag rewarded a VR gaming set worth 3 million won. All the prizes were fantastic as expected of gifts from active Heroes.Chae Nayun and I returned to the cabin, where a warm barbeque party was waiting. Other club members who just came back greeted us with smiles.\u201cWow, you got the first place flag!? I\u2019m jealous!\u201dThe club leader saw the flag in my hand and exclaimed. Other club members also sent looks of envy, to which I made a bitter smile.\u201cNow, let\u2019s eat.\u201dThe barbeque party started. Club members put meat on the grill. The sizzling sound was pleasant to hear, to say the least, but these kids were terrible at grilling. Realizing that they were just teenagers, I stepped up.\u201cI\u2019ll handle the grilling. You guys can rest.\u201dWhen it came to cooking meat, it was a matter of pride for me. Because my aunt ran a Korean BBQ restaurant, I was quite confident in my grilling technique.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re different than what the rumors say, huh.\u201dA male senior gave me a look of surprise as he handed me the tongs he was holding.Without talking, I focused on grilling. Knowing when to flip was the most important thing in cooking meat, and it was best to delay cutting them until the end. Of course, even as I devoted my attention to grilling, I kept my ears open. The seniors began to give their juniors valuable advice.\u201cI know your finals are coming up. Be careful. Finals will be more rigorous than any of the previous exams. Don\u2019t trust anyone, especially during the finals.\u201d\u201cIs it that difficult?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but more importantly, I\u2019ve seen friendships dissolve because of it. Because it\u2019s directly connected to the cadet rankings, everyone will be on the edge. Also, you guys know that there\u2019s a separate class for people being held back, right?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cThere are about 200 of them per year. You have to be especially careful of those guys. They won\u2019t stop at anything to pass since they\u2019ll be expelled if they don\u2019t pass this time.\u201dCadets held back from the previous year, they would be the source of trouble during the finals. Of the 200 repeaters, close to 20% were contracted to Djinns or were part of high profile organizations. There could be even more if the co-author manipulated the numbers.\u201cHey, um\u2026 Haejin?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Hajin. Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cAh, Kim Hajin. You\u2019re a great griller! But you should eat some too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been eating while grilling, so I\u2019m full.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe barbeque party continued for 20 minutes. Because I did a great job on the grilling duty, everyone was seeing me more favorably.\u201cThe original plan was to go out for a night hunt\u2026 but let\u2019s just rest since we\u2019re full.\u201dThe club leader made his decision.\u201cTeam 1 will use Cabin A. Team 2 will use Cabin B.\u201dThe 18 club members split into two separate cabins. Chae Nayun and I were assigned to Cabin A.The cabin was surprisingly big. The first floor had three rooms and a large living room, while the second floor had six rooms, with each person having their own room.After unpacking our belongings, we met in the living room, where we began to play Mafia as a group bonding game.But every time Chae Nayun became the mafia, she was killed in the first town vote. When she took important citizen roles like the doctor or the cop, the mafia killed her on the first or second night. Even when she was a normal citizen, she was killed relatively fast. It wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but her own.She was simply terrible at the game, because she didn\u2019t know how to hide her emotions.\u201c\u2026Ah, I haven\u2019t laughed that hard in some time.\u201dNow, the game had ended and everyone had gone to sleep. I left the cabin and sat down on a bench outside. Chae Nayun\u2019s wronged face kept popping up in my head, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. If we pushed her just a bit further, she might have even broken out into tears.But soon, I stopped my laughter from coming out and turned on my laptop.Truth Agency had received another request.[There is a conman called Jerome M\u00fcller. He was acting as my asset manager when he took the money and ran. Here are several pictures of his face, his height, and other identifying information. Please tell me where he is.]It was the second request I ever received. Judging by his German name, he must have been introduced by the first customer.Since the conman\u2019s face and identifying information were all present, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to find his location with the Book of Truth. Without putting it off, I released Stigma\u2019s magic power and opened the Book of Truth.To find his current location, close to 80% of my current magic power was used. Feeling lightheaded, I staggered slightly.[It will cost 5,000,000 points.]I held myself back from asking for 50 million. Surprisingly, I immediately received a message saying the money was deposited. I wrote back exactly what the Book of Truth said.There was no reply.I closed the Book of Truth and put away my laptop. Then, I looked into the distance.Norway\u2019s untouched nature entered my sight. In front of this scenic beauty, a thought suddenly popped up in my head.Cigarette.\u201cAh, I stopped smoking\u2026.\u201dI had only just realized. Before I came to this world, I smoked half a pack every day because of stress, but after coming to this world, smoking never even crossed my mind.\u201cYou used to smoke?\u201d\u201cWhoa!\u201dI jolted at the sudden voice.\u201cW-What! Where are you!?\u201d\u201cAbove you, idiot.\u201dI immediately looked up. Chae Nayun was peeking her head out from the second-floor window. Since when was she there?\u201cSo you used to smoke? A real delinquent, huh. Do you also have tattoos?\u201dHer stinging, pitying words made me flinch. My eyes fell on my upper arm. Thankfully, the two streaks of Stigma were covered by my clothes.\u201cWhat, you really have them? Let me see.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dChae Nayun raised her eyebrows as she looked down at me. But soon, she looked back up into the air. It seemed she didn\u2019t see me opening the Book of Truth.\u201c\u2026By the way, are you confident?\u201dChae Nayun asked as she looked out at the horizon.\u201cConfident? About what?\u201d\u201cAbout winning against me.\u201dFaced with her straightforward question, I retorted arrogantly.\u201cWhat about you, are you confident in being able to give up on your bow if you lose?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s something that can\u2019t happen, so it never crossed my mind.\u201d\u201cIf you end up losing, are you going to cry?\u201d\u201cDo you want to cry now?\u201d\u201cYou almost cried today because of Mafia.\u201d\u201c\u2026Screw off.\u201dWe exchanged blows. I felt like I was the winner, but then I wondered what I was doing with a kid. Being around them, I felt like I was becoming a kid myself.In the end, I sat back down on the bench and continued watching the scenery.Only snow and evergreen trees were within my view, but when I looked up at the sky, a whole new scenery emerged. The sky was full of stars. It was my first time seeing such a scene. I began to understand why Chae Nayun opened her window. She was looking at the stars too.\u201cOh right, traveling club is apparently canceled this week.\u201dChae Nayun suddenly mentioned traveling club\u2019s cancelation, which wasn\u2019t particularly surprising. The same thing had happened in the original story. In the original story, Belbet\u2019s plan succeeded, so Natasha broke up with Oh Hanhyun. But now, she broke up with Oh Hanhyun because Belbet was arrested. Oh Hanhyun should be writhing in the pain of breaking up right about now.\u201cBy the way, have you seen the news article from France?\u201d\u201cNews article? Is it about me?\u201d\u201cYeah, Yeonha showed me. They\u2019re calling you the Korean Sherlock who captured the conman of the century.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe a delinquent who smokes and picks fights with me for no reason is Sherlock.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just go to sleep.\u201d\u201cI was going to even if you didn\u2019t tell me!\u201dTak. Chae Nayun closed her window shut. I also got up to leave, but then my smartwatch rang.Chae Nayun had sent me a link to a news article.[Conman of the Century Captured by Korean Cadet.]So there was an article like this. I laughed in slight embarrassment and read the translated article.[Belbet was arrested in a large mansion on the outskirts of Paris. Belbet is a conman who had scammed thousands of people over the past 20 years\u2026 Belbet tried to bury his wrongdoings by feigning his death, but his clever methods were seen through by a Cube cadet with keen insight and reasoning\u2026]Tak.Chae Nayun opened her window again, then asked with a voice full of curiosity.\u201cHey, what does a cigarette taste like?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d**\u201cOh, man.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk came back from his journey. During the past two days, he saw 24 hours of a person\u2019s past. The reason his limit was two days was that he could only hold in his bowel and bladder movement for that long. He ran to the bathroom the moment he woke up.\u201cDid you find anything out?\u201dHis secretary spoke to the bathroom door.\u201cYeah, there were a few strange things.\u201d\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d\u201cThe day he entered the orphanage, he spent 23 hours and 55 minutes in front of the orphanage door.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk could move around in a virtual reality of someone\u2019s past. However, because he would be in a spirit body formed with magic power, he used up magic power whenever he moved. As such, it was better to stay still if possible.\u201cSome kid dropped a kid off.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? A kid gave birth to a kid?\u201d\u201cNo, the kid was too young to give birth, but I don\u2019t know too much more. That\u2019s where it ended. His past is strangely dense, so I\u2019ll have to maintain my peak condition if I want to look into it more.\u201dPffft, pfft. Unpleasant sounds rang out from the bathroom. The secretary furrowed her brows.\u201cAnyways, this is looking like it will take a while. I don\u2019t know if I can do it for free.\u201d\u201cYou have to because another request came in.\u201dThe secretary sent a message to his smartwatch. On the screen was a familiar picture.\u201cWhat, it\u2019s Kim Hajin again?\u201dIt was the same picture of Kim Hajin as the one his niece sent.\u201cYes, but look at the purchaser\u2019s rank.\u201d\u201cRank? \u2026Red, Red Diamond?\u201dRed Diamond was Violet Banquet\u2019s highest rank. At the same time, it was the same rank Yoo Jinhyuk had.Red Diamond members were able to see the ranks of purchasers and sellers. Furthermore, because only a few Red Diamond members existed, they could recognize each other. Naturally, Yoo Jinhyuk knew who this account belongs to.[Requesting for this person\u2019s background information. You are not allowed to hurt him. We will deposit 100 million points as a security deposit, then an additional 500 million points when the job is done. (Contract will be canceled if the target finds out or is hurt)]The brief and succinct sentences and the amount of money they offered immediately hinted at their identity.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201dShort and to-the-point sentences, the extravagant use of money, using 600 million won to investigate a person\u2019s background\u2026.He was certain.This was Chameleon Troupe\u2019s account.Yoo Jinhyuk stared fixedly at the picture of Kim Hajin.\u201c\u2026There might really be something about him.\u201dAt the first interesting request in some time, Yoo Jinhyuk made a deep smile.Currently, he was sitting on a toilet.**A week passed by in a breeze and the long-awaited day finally arrived.Today was the day of my archery duel with Chae Nayun. I had to prove that I wasn\u2019t lying when I said I could beat her in archery with just a month of practice.As soon as classes ended, I headed to the archery range. Chae Nayun and her group of friends followed after me. Even with a glance, I could see that she brought quite a entourage of people. There had to be at least 70 people, and among them were well-known cadets like Kim Suho, Yoo Yeonha, and Shin Jonghak.After walking for about 15 minutes, we arrived at an archery range built on an artificial mountain.The archery range looked similar to a skeet shooting range, but unlike in a shooting range, the lanes were huge. Chae Nayun was standing in a lane about 50 meters away, warming up.\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing the same thing. You practiced archery for the past month, right?\u201dI retorted lightly.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do it this way. Explain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun furrowed her brows.\u201cHuu. You see that in the distance? The maximum range is 1km. We\u2019ll start from the 100m mark, and the distance will increase by 50m every time we succeed\u2026. Here, let me show you.\u201dChae Nayun held up her bow. After clearing her throat, she shouted.\u201cShot!\u201dImmediately, a target shot up from the 100m mark. It moved here and there, seemingly trying to dodge Chae Nayun\u2019s arrow. When the target reached its highest point, Chae Nayun fired a wooden arrow. The arrow then pierced through the target cleanly.She had a textbook posture, and her arrow followed a textbook trajectory.The spectators cheered. To be honest, my jaws also dropped slightly.\u201cWhy? Is it more difficult than you thought?\u201dAt Chae Nayun\u2019s confident question, I responded with a slight smile.\u201cNo, I was just thinking it was too easy.\u201dThen, I held out my hand to Chae Nayun.\u201c\u2026What.\u201d\u201cGive me your bow and arrow. I don\u2019t have them.\u201d\u201c\u2026I thought you\u2019d do something like this and prepared them for you.\u201dChae Nayun revealed her teeth and growled before looking behind her. Immediately, some guy ran up to her with a bow and a quiver full of arrows.\u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dI put the quiver down and examined the bow first.\u201cYou ready?\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dThis was the first time I was touching a bow. Because a bow was considered a main weapon, I couldn\u2019t rent one from Cube without paying money. Thankfully, the bow in my hand was a traditional bow, so I at least knew how to use it.I tried pulling on the bowstring and knocking an arrow.\u201cIs this how you shoot?\u201dIt seemed my Gift couldn\u2019t do anything about my posture.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChae Nayun glared at me dumbfoundedly. I laughed meekly and muttered.\u201cI\u2019m kidding. I\u2019m ready, let\u2019s go. Start.\u201dIn any case, I could just copy Chae Nayun\u2019s posture.Chae Nayun clicked her tongue and looked at her target. She shouted loudly.\u201cStart!\u201dHer voice echoed out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bet (2)\u201cYou have three lives. Whoever can hit a target farther away wins.\u201dIn truth, this archery duel followed the general archery competition rules. I had seen Heroes have archery battles on TV a couple of times, though, of course, Heroes\u2019 archery battles had all sorts of additional effects like earthquakes or whatnot.\u201cAm I going first?\u201dChae Nayun asked.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAlright. 100 meters is too easy, so let\u2019s start at 200 meters.\u201dChae Nayun knocked an arrow and pulled on the bowstring. Her sharp eyes stared at the 200-meter mark from which the target would shoot up.\u201cShot!\u201dWith her short shout, the target shot up from the right side. Chae Nayun turned her bow 60 degrees to the right and fired, hitting the target 200 meters away with ease.\u201cHey, it\u2019s your turn now.\u201dChae Nayun crossed her arms with a smile and examined me with an arrogant look.I clumsily copied the same posture Chae Nayun took. With my feet spread apart appropriately, I placed my center of gravity between my legs. Knocking my arrow, I tightly grabbed the bow and bowstring on each of my hands.Now, was it voice recognition?\u201cShot?\u201dI muttered, and a target shot up. Startled, I let go of the bowstring. Naturally, the arrow was way off target.\u201cPfft. Puhaha.\u201dChae Nayun laughed, but she didn\u2019t just laugh, she grabbed her belly with one hand and pointed at me with the other.\u201cDid you really not practice? Do you want to start over from the 100-meter mark?\u201dI shook my head.\u201cIt\u2019s a handicap.\u201dAlthough I failed once, I got a feeling for how to position myself.Chae Nayun had a textbook posture, but I didn\u2019t need to do the same. In the first place, textbook postures were made to be applied in practical use. You couldn\u2019t become an expert just by perfecting textbook material. It was only the minimum requirement to become an expert.And my Gift made me an inborn master.\u201cI have to go again, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. You only have two lives now, so you\u2019re out if you miss twice.\u201dI nodded and stood tall. I didn\u2019t need to take aim. The target moved anyways, so there was no reason to take aim beforehand.\u201cShot.\u201dThe target shot up. I predicted its trajectory and fired so that it would miss the target by a bit. Then, the arrow grazed by the target.\u201c\u2026Is this a joke?\u201dI was putting on a show, but Chae Nayun seemed to have lost interest. The same could be said for the spectators, who were starting to call me a big-mouthed fool that was desperate for attention. It seemed missing twice in a row was too much.\u201cI got the feeling for it now.\u201d\u201cYeah right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going again.\u201dI muttered quickly.\u201cShot.\u201dThis time, I fired the moment the target shot up to about 2 meters. My arrow flew through the sky and pierced the target perfectly.\u201cOh\u2026?\u201dChae Nayun seemed surprised at how quickly I fired. It was the same for the spectators. With a leisure smile, I gestured at Chae Nayun.\u201cYou\u2019re up. No pressure.\u201d\u201c\u2026I guess you did practice.\u201dNow, the distance was 250 meters. Chae Nayun glared at the distance with her bowstring pulled.\u201cShot!\u201dThe target shot up, zigzagging through the air. After taking a moment to deliberate, Chae Nayun fired, then her arrow pierced the center of the target. It was still easy for Chae Nayun.\u201cYou\u2019re up next.\u201dThe following back and forth was extremely boring. We each took turns firing and hitting our targets.However, the spectators didn\u2019t seem to think the same way as they were staring at us with excitement clearly visible in their eyes.300 meters, 350 meters, 400 meters, 450 meters.\u2026 The distance continued to increase and eventually came to 500 meters. From this distance, the target could barely be seen with the naked eye.\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s arms began to tremble with nervousness.If my thoughts were correct, she would soon self-destruct. Chae Nayun\u2019s personality wasn\u2019t suited to being a sharpshooter. She wasn\u2019t patient and was easily shaken up and angered. She wasn\u2019t the type of person who could win in a nail-biting competition like this.\u201cShot.\u201dEven so, Chae Nayun calmed herself with a deep breath and fired.\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dHowever, her arrow brushed past the target. She had missed for the first time at the 500-meter mark. I could immediately tell that she was shaken up.\u201cShot.\u201dShe managed to succeed on her next try, but she was now left with two lives. She breathed out a sigh of relief.\u201cWhew\u2026\u201dHowever, Chae Nayun wouldn\u2019t be able to surpass the 600-meter mark.I would force her hands.To pressure her psychologically, I shouted as soon as Chae Nayun\u2019s turn finished.\u201cShot.\u201dI fired immediately, and the arrow perfectly pierced through the center of the target.With a darkened expression, Chae Nayun held her bow up once more, but I stopped her.\u201cSince we\u2019re at the half-way mark, I\u2019ll go first from now.\u201dWithout asking for her confirmation, I held up my bow and knocked an arrow.\u201cShot.\u201dThe target shot up from the 550-meter mark, but I could see it as though it was only a meter away. It was a bird-shaped doll covered in a black cloth. My eyes could also predict what path it would take. After putting the speed of my arrow into the calculation, I fired at the bird doll\u2019s glimmering silhouette.Just like last time, my arrow pierced the target perfectly.\u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201dChae Nayun, who was staring at the target in a daze, flinched. Her lips were now dry, and she swallowed hard before silently holding up her bow.\u201cYou know it too, right?\u201dBefore she could fire, I provoked her. Simply put, I was trash talking her to shake up her mentality.\u201cYou suck at using a bow.\u201dChae Nayun immediately glared at me. In reality, being able to hit 550-meter away without using magic power was commendable, as wooden arrows couldn\u2019t ignore air resistance even with a high-quality bow.However, being commendable wasn\u2019t the level Chae Nayun longed for. Just by being decent at shooting, she couldn\u2019t accomplish her \u2018goal\u2019.\u201cBut why\u2026\u201d\u201cShot!\u201dChae Nayun shouted loudly and cut me off. Gritting her teeth, she fired at the target that shot up.However, impatient archers could never hit their mark.Chae Nayun\u2019s arrow flew past the target.\u201cBut why you insist on using a bow\u2026 I got curious, so I spent some time thinking about it.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dChae Nayun shouted in frustration.\u201cShot!\u201dThis time, she concentrated as much as she could and fired. Thankfully, she managed to hit the target. I shouted back without giving Chae Nayun a chance to rest.\u201cShot!\u201dMy target shot up before the remnants of Chae Nayun\u2019s target could even hit the ground. When I fired, the target was instantly destroyed. I didn\u2019t feel pressured in any way, but Chae Nayun\u2019s face began to pale.I continued what I was saying.\u201cDeep inside, you know it too. You\u2019re more talented with swords.\u201dChae Nayun didn\u2019t become Yoo Sihyuk\u2019s disciple for show. As a Master rank Hero, Yoo Sihyuk didn\u2019t care about people\u2019s background. The only thing he took into consideration in picking his disciples was their talent.Chae Nayun was one of the so-called \u2018Children of Yoo Sihyuk\u2019.\u201cI said shut up!\u201dChae Nayun blurted out in rage. I held up my bow.Now it was the 600-meter mark. Unless magic power arrows were used, the maximum range for the light bow I had in my hand was 1.4 kilometer. Although the 600-meter mark didn\u2019t even reach half that distance, 1.4 kilometer was purely the \u2018maximum range\u2019.The realistic range, which even professional archers could only hit with a 50% accuracy, was exactly half that distance. But in this competition, targets were even flying through the sky.The current Chae Nayun was simply incapable of hitting a target of this distance.\u201cYou\u2019re scared. You\u2019re scared of fighting with a sword, and you\u2019re scared of being drenched with blood.\u201dThat was how she was in the original story. Her mother being murdered etched a deep trauma in her heart, but in this timeline, her trauma should be even deeper because of what happened with her older brother.\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re justifying yourself every day. That you\u2019re just as talented with a bow. That you can become the greatest Hero even with a bow.\u201dI took a moment to breathe.\u201cBut with a bow, you won\u2019t be able to kill a single Djinn, much less get revenge for your older brother.\u201dThat was the killing blow.\u00a0Tak.\u00a0Chae Nayun let go of her bowstring. Her arrows flew through the empty sky, marking her third failure.She had lost.\u201cWhat did you just say.\u2026\u201dChae Nayun glared at me with eyes full of rage. From her hands holding onto her bow, I could see blood oozing out.\u201cWith that strength, you should use a sword.\u201dI stared into the distance. Then, I shouted, \u201cShot\u201d. Not once, not twice, but thrice.600 meters, 650 meters, 700 meters.Three targets shot up into the air with little delay. I quickly fired three times, and then the three arrows pierced through the three targets.I didn\u2019t stop there. I wanted to know the limit of grade 6 of Master Sharpshooter. Since Chae Nayun was finished, I continued shooting by myself.750 meters, 800 meters\u2026. The atmosphere became heavier as the distance increased, and Chae Nayun\u2019s heavy breathing became louder. I could feel her stinging breath filled with anger and defeat.\u201c900 meters. I\u2019ll stop here.\u201dBecause I felt like the 900-meter mark was my limit, I gave up afterwards. I didn\u2019t want to try the 950-meter mark, where I had a high chance of failure.\u201c550 meters vs 900 meters. My victory, right?\u201dI stared at Chae Nayun. Before I noticed, her glaring eyes had watered up.Currently, Chae Nayun was unable to win against her anger. Normally, she would have jumped when I mentioned her older brother, but she probably didn\u2019t want to seem like someone who was making a fuss after losing.\u201cI got lucky.\u201dI grinned and put my hand out to Chae Nayun. Her face became distorted. Unsurprisingly, she didn\u2019t shake my hand.\u201cWhat do you want.\u201dInstead, Chae Nayun muttered briefly.Unexpectedly, she accepted her loss easily. I smiled.\u201cNothing. I want nothing.\u201dIf I forced her to give up being an archer, she would do so in frustration and regret. But if she didn\u2019t give up out of her own will, if she couldn\u2019t overcome her attachment to bows and her fear of close ranged combat, she wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the apex of swordsmanship.And I knew that she could overcome her fear and trauma. She always grew through frustration, defeat, and anger. That was something that shouldn\u2019t have changed.\u201cBut, I want you to think for yourself. What your Gift is, what your talent is.\u201dI said so as I pushed my hair up. Perhaps because I focused too much, I was sweating quite a bit.Then, I suddenly remembered that the bow I was holding belonged to Chae Nayun.\u201cOh, and I\u2019ll take this bow.\u201dEven the cheapest bow cost millions of won. I had to save money where I could.Chae Nayun didn\u2019t seem to mind either, or at least, she might not even have heard that last part.Her shoulders were trembling ever so slightly. She was crying quietly.I turned around without speaking further, then left the archery range where only the sound of wind resounded.**At the same time, on the highest floor of Seoul\u2019s 5-star hotel\u2026.\u201cBoss, are you really going? You don\u2019t have to go yourself, you know.\u201dIn front of a fancy dressing table in the penthouse room, Jain asked worriedly.\u201cI am.\u201dBoss nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll go examine him myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ehew. You\u2019re fixated on something again.\u201dBoss was very adamant.Without a choice, Jain released her magic power. Covering Boss\u2019 face, a new face appeared on top.Jain\u2019s Gift could be used on someone else as long as that person was within a 10-kilometer range of her. Using her Gift, Jain had changed Boss\u2019 face and physique to that of a certain \u2018cadet\u2019.\u201cSo, do we just wait somewhere under the sea?\u201dAfter finishing her operation, Jain murmured as she studied Boss\u2019 expression.\u201cJain, are you scared?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not scared. It\u2019s just that\u2026 you know, Yun Seung-Ah that crazy bitch might come.\u201dYun Seung-Ah and Jain were like cats and dogs. If Yun Seung-Ah came as an exam overseer, Jain wasn\u2019t confident. Confident, in letting her live.\u201cI missed that ring because of her. If I see her again, I don\u2019t think I can hold myself back.\u201dBoss stared at Jain quietly before nodding.\u201cThen just wait somewhere nearby.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay. Ah, and here, it\u2019s the detail of the cadet Boss is disguising as. At least glance over it.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJain gave Boss a thick stack of paper. Jain could copy her target\u2019s outer appearance as well as their habits onto herself, but the latter only applied to herself.Boss began to read the document with the cadet\u2019s background information.\u201cYou\u2019re good at acting, right Boss?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dThree weeks remained until the final exam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bet (3)When Chae Nayun easily struck the target 200 meters away, the spectators broke into applause. Chae Nayun was an amazing archer. That\u2019s what everyone felt, including Kim Suho. He looked around at other archers spectating the match. Because it was an archery duel, there were ten or so cadets with bows hanging on their backs.\u201cChae Nayun\u2019s posture is amazing.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been doing it for a long time.\u201d\u201cYeah, but still, how can it be so perfect?\u201dThey began to comment on the match. Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Yoo Yeonha, and Yi Yeonghan, who didn\u2019t know much about archery, naturally listened in on their explanations.At that moment, Kim Hajin fired. His first arrow missed the mark by a mile.\u201cThe hell\u2026. His posture is completely off.\u201dKim Suho placed his ear on the commentators and his eyes on the archery duel.Kim Hajin fired a second shot, which missed once more.\u201cEr, maybe he really didn\u2019t practice.\u201d\u201cNo, he changed his bow\u2019s direction at the last second. He missed on purpose.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why would he do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThen, Kim Hajin fired his third arrow. This time, his arrow hit the target perfectly.\u201cSee? He missed his second shot on purpose.\u201d\u201cOkay, but why?\u201d\u201cFuck man, I don\u2019t know!\u201d\u2026For now, Kim Suho continued to watch their duel.\u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen him before at the archery range.\u201dAt that moment, one of the cadets muttered.There were two facilities for sharpshooter cadets \u2013 the shooting range and the archery range.More often than not, the shooting range was used by cadets to practice archery with magic power, while the archery range was used for pure, traditional archery practice. Furthermore, there was a limited number of archery ranges that first years could use, so most first year sharpshooters had seen other sharpshooters\u2019 faces at least once.\u201cHave you seen him?\u201d\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cMaybe he comes after midnight?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s when I\u2019m here, from midnight to 3, and I\u2019ve never seen him.\u201dKim Suho was at a loss for words. Did Kim Hajin really not practice at all?But Kim Hajin\u2019s archery was too keen and quick for that to be true. His arrows shot after his target like a starving wild beast.Soon, the archers began to compare their practice hours to discuss this mystery.Their busy conversation came to a stop by the time the distance reached 400 meters. Kim Hajin was shooting too well.One of the cadets muttered in a daze.\u201c450-meter mark is my record\u2026\u201dBut soon, Kim Hajin easily surpassed the 450-meter mark. The noisy crowd slowly began to quiet down, and sounds of hard swallowing increased.\u201cAh, Chae Nayun missed.\u201dAnd at 500 meters, Chae Nayun missed for the first time. On the other hand, Kim Hajin succeeded just as easily as before.The same thing happened on the 550-meter mark. When Chae Nayun failed a second time, Kim Suho realized she would lose.Now, it was the 600-meter mark.Kim Suho could see Kim Hajin saying something to Chae Nayun, but because they were too far away, he couldn\u2019t hear them. Curious, he focused his magic power on his ears.\u2014But with a bow, you won\u2019t be able to kill a single Djinn, much less get revenge for your older brother.Kim Suho frowned.\u201cWhat is he\u2026\u201dPerhaps because of what he said, Chae Nayun failed again on the 600-meter mark.Chae Nayun immediately gave Kim Hajin a fierce glare, but Kim Hajin ignored her and concentrated on shooting.\u201cWhoa, what the hell!?\u201dAt that moment, other archers exclaimed in shock. Kim Hajin had shot down three targets at 600-meter, 650-meter, and 700-meter marks. Kim Suho had to admit, Kim Hajin\u2019s technique was like a form of art. But seemingly unsatisfied, Kim Hajin continued. Kim Suho stared at him with mixed feelings.On the other hand, Yoo Yeonha was watching Kim Hajin in satisfaction. His performance was exactly what she expected to see. Furthermore, she felt what he showed today was only a tiny fraction of his real power. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder how much of his real strength he was hiding.\u201c\u2026What is he?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt must be a Specialized Gift.\u201dA nameless archer put out an idea. Hearing the word Specialized Gift, Yoo Yeonha strained her ears.Specialized Gift. Just like its name suggested, it was a Gift specialized to a certain role.Although it wasn\u2019t a showy Gift like Kim Suho\u2019s or Shin Jonghak\u2019s, Specialized Gifts stood at the peak of the field they specialized. Furthermore, most people with Specialized Gifts had an additional Gift.Because of this characteristic of Specialized Gifts, they were rare and valuable.\u201cThen there\u2019s no way Chae Nayun can beat him in pure archery. Not unless she uses magic power.\u201d\u201cBut Kim Hajin uses a gun. It was determined that his Gift was the greatest gun-related Gift.\u201d\u201cMaybe his Specialized Gift is for bows and his other Gift is for guns.\u201d\u201cWow, then imagine if they were both for bows.\u201d\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be fair. If that was the case, he would be in the same league as Jin Seyeon.\u201dHearing that, the archers began to nod in agreement. For the record, Jin Seyeon was Korea\u2019s Master rank Hero, titled the Divine Archer.At that moment, Kim Hajin turned around after hitting the 900-meter mark target. Facing him, the archers suddenly froze.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn the dead silence that followed, Kim Hajin walked past the crowd of spectators. Kim Suho eyed him as he walked by, and Kim Hajin did the same expressionlessly.Soon, Kim Hajin completely passed by Kim Suho, and Kim Suho stared at Chae Nayun who was left standing alone in the huge lane.Kim Suho began to walk towards her.\u201cNayun.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s body jolted. Standing an appropriate distance away, Kim Suho picked out the words to comfort her.\u201cUm, I heard from the other guys, it seems Kim Hajin has a Specialized\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dBut Chae Nayun interrupted him.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not in the mood to talk. And Specialized Gift or not, that means there is a difference in our talents.\u201d\u201cNayun, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself\u2026\u201d\u201cJust leave.\u201dThe entire time, Chae Nayun refused to turn around.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dIn the end, Kim Suho returned helplessly.At the same time, he caught sight of a man staring at him with a big smile on his face.\u201cHaha, you should know your place. Move over.\u201dShin Jonghak sneered at him and began to walk towards Chae Nayun. However, Yoo Yeonha carefully grabbed Shin Jonghak\u2019s sleeve, attempting to hold him back.\u201cJonghak, I think you should leave her alone for now.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m different.\u201dDespite Yoo Yeonha\u2019s dissuasion, he confidently walked up to Chae Nayun.\u201cChae Nayun, I think you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cI SAID LEAVE!\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s thunderous roar startled Shin Jonghak.\u201cC-Chae Nayun? I\u2019m not Kim Suho, I\u2019m Shin Jonghak\u2026\u201dSomewhat in a daze, he placed his hand on Chae Nayun\u2019s shoulder. Chae Nayun immediately smacked his hand away.\u201cI SAID LEAVE! SCREW OFF!\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh? Uh, um\u2026 uh, yeah.\u201dShin Jonghak staggered backward as though his soul was sucked out.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dBy the time Shin Jonghak returned to Yoo Yeonha with a devastated face, Chae Nayun was running into the forest.Yoo Yeonha watched her leave with a grin on her face, happy to see Chae Nayun running away after being completely stomped.But separately from her heated emotions, her cold reasoning was working on a plan.Helping someone when they were down was the most effective way of making connections.Chae Nayun had a grade 1 priority in Yoo Yeonha\u2019s Connection Management List. Just being a fourth generation chaebol was enough to give her that grade, but her family conglomerate wasn\u2019t one that ran a guild. In other words, she was the greatest connection she could bring into her guild.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll console her.\u201dYoo Yeonha began to run after Chae Nayun.**Not long afterwards, she discovered Chae Nayun sitting crouched down behind a bush. With her face buried between her knees, she was shaking up and down.\u201cNayun?\u201dWhen Yoo Yeonha called her, she trembled but didn\u2019t respond. Yoo Yeonha quietly sat down next to her, and Chae Nayun waddled to the side in response.\u201c\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha didn\u2019t say anything. She only occasionally signaled to Chae Nayun that she was still there, all the while waiting patiently.She had to wait for a fairly long time. The wind blew, leaves fell, and the sky began to grow dark.After about 30 minutes, Chae Nayun raised her head, wiping her tears as she sobbed.\u201cYoo Yeonha.\u201dShe then called Yoo Yeonha, who responded with a casual, tender voice.\u201cYeah?\u201dChae Nayun opened her mouth within the forest\u2019s silence.\u201cDid you guys\u2026 not hear him?\u201d\u201cHear what?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 mentioned Oppa.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really? We were too far.\u201dYoo Yeonha was genuinely surprised. To Chae Nayun, her older brother was a bottom line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed, the reverse scale of a dragon that shouldn\u2019t be touched. Every cadet took special care not to mention him even as an accident\u2026.\u201cYeah, that bastard.\u2026 Haa, that was the second time.\u201dChae Nayun couldn\u2019t even continue her sentence. She was burning up from a mixture of embarrassment and rage. She wanted to let it out, chase after him and punish him, but because she was so thoroughly crushed, she didn\u2019t have the strength to do so.\u201cMm\u2026.\u201dSeeing this Chae Nayun, Yoo Yeonha scratched her neck. Things had gotten more complicated than she anticipated.Yoo Yeonha disliked Chae Nayun, but she also wanted to make her into her ally. However, the same could be said for Kim Hajin, and he was even a benefactor who saved her life.Rather than choosing between one of them, she told herself that the best thing to do was to mend their relationship.Of course, she also wondered why Kim Hajin would say something like that.\u201cHaa.\u201dYoo Yeonha sighed and began to contemplate on what to say.And exactly three minutes later, she thought up a good idea.Kuhum. After clearing her throat, Yoo Yeonha spoke.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s understandable.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour Oppa is alive.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you crazy?\u201dChae Nayun glared at Yoo Yeonha as though she was ready to strangle her at any moment. Yoo Yeonha calmly received her aggressive gaze, then carefully continued her sentence.\u201cDid you know? People feel a sense of kinship with others who share similar wounds.\u201d_Sssss. _The forest\u2019s leaves shook.Chae Nayun looked confused. Yoo Yeonha continued.\u201cBut when the depths of those wounds are different\u2026 so, if someone who should feel less pain is crying louder, the person with the deeper wound might find it unsightly.\u201dYoo Yeonha recalled the message she received from Yoo Jinhyuk three days ago.[It\u2019ll take longer to look into him. But know this, there is something about Kim Hajin.]\u2018There is something about Kim Hajin.\u2019From this meaningful sentence, Yoo Yeonha obtained assurance of her hypothesis. Kim Hajin\u2019s parents were killed by someone, and Kim Hajin was searching for the person or group who had ruined his happy life.\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2026\u201d\u201cThat person, he\u2019s an orphan. Probably because of a reason similar to yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s eyes widened.It was a reaction Yoo Yeonha expected. Chae Nayun was someone who didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s past. In a way, it was a defensive mechanism, since if she dug up others\u2019 past, they could also dig up her own.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that people are harassing him about it?\u201dChae Nayun looked completely oblivious. In the first place, it wasn\u2019t something she could imagine. From her perspective, people who made fun of others for losing their parents couldn\u2019t exist.Chae Nayun swallowed hard and asked again.\u201cHe endured it?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re curious about?\u201dYoo Yeonha furrowed her brows as though she was tired.\u201cKim Hajin is being harassed because of you. Because you told Jonghak.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cNayun.\u201dYoo Yeonha collected her breath before continuing.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re not the only one with a painful past.\u201dAt that moment, Chae Nayun\u2019s face drew a blank.Chae Nayun thought back to the day she talked to Shin Jonghak because of what Kim Hajin said about her older brother.That was when harassments and bad rumors about Kim Hajin began. She was the source of it, yet she didn\u2019t do anything to stop it. She had purposely ignored it, something she couldn\u2019t deny.Still, she truly didn\u2019t expect that those delinquents would even dig up his past\u2026\u201cK-Kuhum.\u201dSeeing Chae Nayun\u2019s soulless face, Yoo Yeonha held back her laughter by clearing her throat. This was enough. Investing any more time and emotion was something that didn\u2019t fit her personality.\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving now. I\u2019m only a third party in all this, so talking about deep things will only cause misunderstandings. You can think the rest for yourself, Nayun.\u201dYoo Yeonha gently stroked Chae Nayun\u2019s shoulder and turned around to leave.\u201c\u2026Uh, yeah.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s voice was much weaker than before.Yoo Yeonha felt like she gained points from both of them. Satisfied, she went back with a light heart.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn the vast, silent forest, Chae Nayun was left all alone.She stared into the distance blankly.Chwaaaa\u2014\u00a0From the darkness, cool wind blew and brushed against the forest\u2019s leaves.Seeing leaves shaking and falling, Chae Nayun took time to self-reflect.**\u201c\u2026Haha, you sure got big.\u201dWith a big grin, I looked down at Evandel\u2019s Seed. The way it quivered to absorb blood was surprisingly cute.I already knew what the seed would look like once it hatched. At first, she would look like a 3 to 4-year-old child.But Evandel was a very special witch. Temporarily transforming herself into a cat or a dog shouldn\u2019t be a problem for her.\u201cShould I go with a cat? Or a dog\u2026?\u201dThat was my worry. Raising a child at Cube was absolutely not allowed, but it was okay to own pets. In fact, Cube encouraged cadets to own pets as they supposedly helped with cadets\u2019 mental health. There was even a pet adoption center inside Cube.\u201cWhen will you hatch?\u201dI gently rubbed the seed\u2019s belly. The seed quivered, almost as if it was ticklish.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHaha, you\u2019re so cute.\u201dI suddenly remembered Mong, a dog I used to own. He only liked Mom and Dad and never gave me a glance, but at this point, I missed everyone from Earth.At that moment\u2026 an alert popped up on the laptop I had open on my desk.[You obtained 253 SP.][An incredible luck applies to your human relationship!][Narrow Escape from Death (2/9) \u2013 A special stat, accumulation of luck, becomes partly unlocked!]\u201c\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201dIt was an alert I couldn\u2019t understand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

ChangeDorm 4, penthouse.Chae Nayun was lying on her bed in this large, empty room.Today was Sunday, and classes would resume tomorrow.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dChae Nayun let out a deep sigh. Thinking about tomorrow, fear came over her. The result of her bet with Kim Hajin should have spread by now, that she was completely overwhelmed. Some people would feel elated, while some would worry. Chae Nayun hoped that the emotions directed at her would be schadenfreude rather than worry and sympathy.But what worried her more than anything else was Kim Hajin himself.\u201cSmoking.\u2026\u201dChae Nayun remembered her conversation with Kim Hajin in Norway. He had murmured that he quit smoking. At the time, she thought he was just trying to act cool, but with the information she had now, she had to believe that he had a reason for smoking. That with no one to rely on, he had to rely on an object to relieve his pain\u2026Chae Nayun fell flat on her bed.There were ample traces of the harassment Kim Hajin suffered. Shin Jonghak\u2019s lackeys had written posts on forums and commented on his social media, and Chae Nayun looked through them all. Just like Yoo Yeonha said, she could hardly read most of them without furrowing her brows. Embarrassment, shame, and remorse became tangled up inside her into a complicated emotion.Change of weapon and position.Thinking about it now, Kim Hajin had experienced them first.She read that Kim Hajin was originally a swordsman. Even so, he gave up on his sword. Most likely, it was because he realized his Gift wasn\u2019t suitable for it.Abandoning everything he had worked towards his entire life, choosing an unorthodox weapon like a gun\u2026 Chae Nayun wondered what he must have felt.Chae Nayun pushed her hand below her bed. From there, she took out a fairly big suitcase. She got up from her bed, then opened it. Immediately, her treasured memories resurfaced.Inside the suitcase were hundreds of pictures. They were something she had buried deep inside her heart to avoid being hurt, but each picture was something she could never forget as they were taken with people she loved the most.Her mother and her older brother. Inside the pictures, they were happily smiling together with Chae Nayun. The young Chae Nayun looked so happy that she teared up simply by looking at her younger self.\u201cHuup.\u201dChae Nayun held back her tears. Then, she picked up the short sword placed in the suitcase.The sword was only about a meter long, but because it was enchanted with a special magic, it increased in length when it absorbed magic power. From what she remembered, the maximum length was about 4 meters. This mystical sword was gifted to her by Yoo Sihyuk eight years ago.For the first time in a long time, Chae Nayun held the sword in her hand. Although it looked like a cute toy, it was a deadly weapon that was heavier than the world when she was young.\u201cWhat was my limit again? I doubt my magic power control was good when I was 8, but I remember it being around 2 meters.\u2026\u201dChae Nayun imbued the sword with her magic power. The blade shot up and became long enough to reach the ceiling.\u201cWow\u2026 I grew a lot.\u201dRealizing something obvious, Chae Nayun stared at the sword for a long time. Then, just like how her master taught her in the past, she enveloped the sword with magic power. Her blue magic power rose up clearly around the blade.Jiiing.The sword resonated with her magic power, manifesting sword qi.\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun put her forehead against the sword. Then, she closed her eyes. The cold metallic touch and the ringing of magic power, Chae Nayun engraved the sensation in her heart.**Sunday. I had a meeting with Cube\u2019s faculty. It was because of something called a Specialized Gift. The rumor that I defeated Chae Nayun and hit the 900-meter mark had already spread all across Cube.They asked whether the rumor was true. After thinking about it for a bit, I nodded. Then, they asked whether I wanted to release the information to the public or keep it a secret.I chose the latter. In reality, it didn\u2019t really matter which one I chose as it would be revealed regardless. The only difference was that the latter option made me a product. If someone wanted information about me from Cube, they would have to buy it from Cube. Of course, since rumors of it had already spread, they would only be paying for a confirmation of the rumor.In any case, once the meeting ended, I left the administration building. As final exams began in two weeks, there was practically no one walking outside. Everyone was likely studying in the library or training at the Fitness Center.However, I headed back to my dorm.Opening the familiar door, I sat down on the couch and opened my laptop.There were numerous things I needed to buy for the upcoming exam.[Automatic Tent][Porkchops][Chicken Breast][Frying Pan][Portable Grill]\u2026\u2026I put all the camping equipment I could think of into the shopping basket. It cost me two million won in total, but I made the purchase without hesitation.Instructors would go through our bags before the final exam to look for personal weapons and defensive equipment. However, items like the ones I bought were permitted. If they ask why I brought them, I had more than enough excuses to give. The simplest one was to say that I prepared everything just in case.[Your purchase has been completed.]Immediately after the confirmation message popped up, Park Soohyuk also sent me a message.[Hajin, we made our website. Take a look. You\u2019re on our list of investors.][wmw.shagency.com]\u201cOh?\u201dIt was an agency website. I immediately went into it.\u300cCultivation of Trust \u2013 SH Agency\u300d[SH Agency Introduction] [List of Investors] [List of Affiliated Hunters]The design was quite decent. But still, affiliated hunters? Was it there just for the sake of being there? I snickered as I clicked on it.===[Jamie King]Date of birth: 08/03/1997A hunter with 5 years of experience[Joshua]Date of birth: 09/01/2005A hunter with 1 year of experience===\u201cOh, there actually are some?\u201dSurprisingly, he had already found two hunters. I didn\u2019t know who they were, but the important thing was that they were there.This time, I clicked on the list of investors and was immediately surprised.I thought I would be the only one, but someone else had joined the ranks.[Kim Hajin.][Yoo Yeonha.]She was quick as expected.With a grin, I closed the laptop.[How\u2019s the website?][It\u2019s clean and nice, but I think you should put Yoo Yeonha\u2019s name before me on the list of investors.]Even if she might not act like it, she actually cared a lot about such things.[Why? I don\u2019t really care, but shouldn\u2019t you come first? You know, both alphabetically and by who came first.][No, just do as I say.]If left unchanged, the number of investments he got in the future could very well decrease.**The next day.\u201cHuu.\u201dStanding in front of the classroom door, I collected my breath.I was especially nervous today. The archery duel had about 70 spectators, so what happened in the duel was bound to spread. Now that four days had passed since the duel, it would be strange if anyone didn\u2019t know.Because of it, I was somewhat apprehensive about going into the classroom, but I still opened the door and walked in.Everyone\u2019s eyes immediately fell on me, and I could hear them murmuring about me. Ignoring whatever they were saying, I walked to my usual spot and sat down. Chae Nayun wasn\u2019t here yet.\u201c\u2026?\u201dNo, I thought she wasn\u2019t here, but hearing a familiar voice, I turned towards that direction.There, I saw Chae Nayun who was different than her usual self. To be more precise, her long brown hair, which reached her chest, had been shortened to her shoulders.Chae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha were talking in whispers.\u201c\u2026So how\u2019s the short hair? You do look good in it.\u201d\u201cHair is hair.I do like that it\u2019s less hot though. You should also cut your hair.\u201d\u201cI like mine the way it is.\u2026 By the way, you didn\u2019t cut your hair because of the bet, did you?\u201d\u201cI did it because it was hot. Plus, you can\u2019t always win. Do I look like someone who would dwell on the past?\u201dFrom what I could see, she was the same other than her hair being shorter.But at that moment, Chae Nayun stretched and turned her head sideways. Because it felt like she was looking at me, I quickly buried my face on my desk.**Chae Nayun pretended to stretch and peeked at Kim Hajin. He had only just arrived but was already studying hard.\u201cKuu~ I\u2019m tired.\u201dChae Nayun turned back to the front.\u201cOh right, did you study?\u201dAt that moment, Shin Jonghak, who was sitting behind Chae Nayun, asked. Chae Nayun gave a simple reply.\u201cI did enough.\u201dTheory classes only held a minor role in Cube. Combat exams and written exams had a 7:3 ratio in their impact on grades, but because combat exams better reflected the level of cadets, cadets who ranked near the top in combat exams usually scored similarly in written exams. Of course, there were exceptions as well.\u201cEnough? Then you should be around rank 600 again, hahaha.\u201dThinking Chae Nayun, who was pretending to be fine, to really be fine, Shin Jonghak made fun of her insensitively.\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun glared at Shin Jonghak fiercely. Feeling the hostile look, Shin Jonghak stopped snickering and awkwardly backed off.\u201cOh right, here are the Phenomenon Realm Analysis notes you were asking about yesterday.\u201dKim Suho changed the topic in a hurry.\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll copy it quickly and give it back.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t expect too much. Phenomenon Realm Analysis is difficult for everyone except Kim Ha\u2026\u201dKim Suho paused in the middle of his sentence, realizing he made a mistake.\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s difficult for everyone except Kim Hajin. It\u2019s fine, geez. You don\u2019t have to be so careful.\u201dChae Nayun shook her head and put Kim Suho\u2019s notebook in front of her. Although Yoo Yeonha was better at studying than Kim Suho, Yoo Yeonha was untrustworthy.Even in reality, Yoo Yeonha had two notes because she didn\u2019t want to lend her real one to Chae Nayun.Drrrrk\u2014Then, the theory class professor walked in.\u201cNow, now, quiet down. You know your exams are in two weeks, right? It\u2019ll cover everything until Aurora Reaction.\u201dThe noisy classroom immediately became silent. The professor announced the scope of material covered on the test before starting today\u2019s class. Chae Nayun opened her notebook and grabbed her pen.\u2018I\u2019ll study hard today. I have to show that I\u2019m different than before\u2026 but I\u2019m a bit sleepy\u2026 this is the professor\u2019s fault\u2026\u2019When she woke up after dozing off, there was a ton of material she needed to write down.\u201cAlright, here\u2019s a calculation problem, your favorites type. Now I know some of you don\u2019t understand why you need to learn this. But, once you go out into the real world and begin entering dungeons, you\u2019ll be on your knees thanking me. If you don\u2019t want to cry tears of blood, don\u2019t slack off now.\u201dIt seemed the professor finished explaining the theoretical concepts of today\u2019s class as he already moved on to example problems. Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t understand this rift in time.\u201cFor this problem, I want somebody to help me solve it. Let\u2019s see\u2026.\u201dThe professor paused for a moment and began to look over the list of cadets. Chae Nayun immediately became nervous, worried that he might call her name. She was already embarrassed to death because of the archery duel. The last thing she wanted was to face another embarrassment.\u201cAh. Cadet Kim Hajin. Come out.\u201dThankfully, it wasn\u2019t Chae Nayun.Kim Hajin got up from his seat and sauntered up to the teaching podium as everyone\u2019s gazes fell on him. Then, he stepped up the podium and was handed a hologram pen by the professor.He then proceeded to solve the problem without a pause. His procedures and calculations were both flawless, and even his penmanship was impeccable. Chae Nayun stared at the variables and numbers he wrote down in a daze. Then, she suddenly snapped out and began to copy everything down.\u201cGood. Very good.\u201dThe professor applauded as soon as Kim Hajin finished. Everyone else was busy copying what he wrote.\u201cPerfect. As expected of rank 1 in the world. You can sit now. I\u2019ll do the explaining.\u201dRank 1 in the world? Kim Hajin tilted his head in confusion, but then went back to his seat without further questions.\u201cLook everyone. This is what we call a flawless, model answer.\u201dThe professor gathered everyone\u2019s attention. This time, Chae Nayun also paid attention with widened eyes.**Monday night, 10 P.M.I went to the shooting range as soon as I finished working out in the Fitness Center. I cranked up the difficulty to stage 10 where the targets also attacked and started practicing.But while I practiced, faint shouting continued to pierce through the wall.Huap! Hiyaap! Something like that. Curious, I peered through the wall.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dIn the shooting room next to me, Chae Nayun was brandishing a sword against a dummy she must have brought from somewhere.It was a bit strange seeing someone train with a sword in a shooting range, but I still felt good about it.In the original story, Chae Nayun changed to a sword only about a year after she graduated from Cube. The reason for it was the Genghis Khan Artifact Scramble, which occurred in Mongolia. There, she encountered the Djinn who killed her mother but was unable to kill him with her bow.If Chae Nayun started honing her swordsmanship now, by graduation, she would likely be a monster second only to Kim Suho. Feeling pleased with myself, I stretched and ended today\u2019s practice.But when I left the shooting room, the door next to me also opened. From inside, Chae Nayun walked out as she wiped her sweat. I instantly froze, and it was the same for Chae Nayun.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTo be completely honest, I felt sorry about things I had said to Chae Nayun. Although I had good intentions of trying to encourage her, I had still hit her nerve twice. So before Chae Nayun attacked me, I opened my mouth first.\u201c\u2026D-Did you finish your archery practice?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, uh, yeah.\u201dChae Nayun awkwardly retorted.\u201cW-What, I can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cNo, keep up the good work.\u201dI wanted to end the conversation and quickly leave, but Chae Nayun stopped me.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI was a bit scared, but I still turned around and faced her.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cYou, um\u2026 said you quit smoking.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI was caught off guard by her unexpected words.Indeed, I did say that during our trip to Norway. To be exact, Chae Nayun overheard what I muttered to myself.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI did.\u201d\u201c\u2026How did you quit?\u201dIt seemed like a completely irrelevant question to ask. Was she trying to offer me a poisoned cigarette or something?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a question I could answer, so I cut her off and left.From my back, I could feel Chae Nayun\u2019s gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She quantified the ability of seven cadets, including Kim Hajin and Kim Suho, and provided close to 200 pages of data in support of her estimate.Recorded inside were things that weren\u2019t revealed to the public, which only Yoo Yeonha knew about. This report would now become Essence of the Strait\u2019s top-secret document and reach its leader, Yoo Jinwoong.Although the finals were right around the corner, this report was more important to Yoo Yeonha than her grades. Of course, getting good grades wouldn\u2019t be bad, but Yoo Yeonha\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t becoming the greatest Hero. Not only was she cognizant of her limits, but she also knew that a Hero was only one individual no matter how strong he was and that he would never be able to win against society.However, Yoo Yeonha wanted to cultivate her own society in Korea. The reason she entered Cube was solely to obtain the status of a Hero and to make connections.\u201c\u2026Is he going to continue ignoring me?\u201dYoo Yeonha grumbled as she picked up her smartwatch.Yoo Jinhyuk had yet to reply to her.**Three days before the written exams, Friday.The head of the Chameleon Troupe collected her breath in front of an unfamiliar door.\u2014Boss, no one is going to notice your disguise, so you don\u2019t have to worry. Remember, your name is Seo Ijin. Don\u2019t forget about it. Find me if anything happens. I\u2019ll be in the infirmary.Jain\u2019s voice rang out in her ears. Just like she said, her disguise was perfect. The cadet named Seo Ijin had similar build and hair color as her, so it didn\u2019t take much magic power to disguise her either.\u2014Go in.Boss nodded and opened the door.As classes would begin soon, the room was full of cadets. She had already memorized everyone\u2019s faces. She then walked to the group that Seo Ijin often hung out with.At that moment\u2026\u201cHey! Seo Ijin!\u201dSomeone struck her head.She didn\u2019t suffer any huge injury, but she fell in a daze. She thought back to what just happened, and coming to a realization, she stiffly turned her head to the side.There, she saw a man she didn\u2019t recognize.\u201cDid you study well?\u201dThe man said, looking down at her. She replied just as she practiced.\u201c\u2026Un, I did.\u201d[1]\u201cWhat were you doing yesterday? You weren\u2019t respon\u2014\u201dBefore the man did anything else, she sat down on her seat.\u201cIjin~\u201dImmediately, a pair of arms wrapped around her neck. She was slightly startled, but she wasn\u2019t as shocked as before. Maintaining her calm, she looked back at the girl who clung to her back, feeling like a huge cicada had landed on her. Just like a cicada, the girl could also be killed by a single fist.Drrrrk\u2014At that moment, the door opened. Boss turned towards the door, and there, she saw the reason she infiltrated this class.She stared at Kim Hajin, who walked in while yawning and met her eyes. Immediately, he froze.*\u2018\u2026The hell.\u2019I gazed at a girl I usually wouldn\u2019t have cared about. I didn\u2019t know her name, but I knew she was in my class. The way she interacted with her friends looked completely normal from the outside.However, I could see through her outside appearance. My Gift, Observation and Reading, could perfectly unmask Jain\u2019s Gift.That girl wasn\u2019t a normal cadet, but the boss of the Chameleon Troupe.She was likely here to observe Kim Suho. Still, this was something that never happened in the original story.\u201cHey, why did you stop being active in your social media? Did you find a boyfriend?\u201dCadets who didn\u2019t know this touched her body here and there. It seemed the girl she disguised as was a bit of a pushover.\u201cHoho, boyfriend? What do you mean? I just slept because I was tired.\u201dBoss responded in an awkward way, and I broke out into a cold sweat as I watched her. With one wrong move, I felt like their limbs and bones would break apart.\u201cAh, Ijin, your cheeks are chubbier than usual. Did you eat ramen before sleeping?\u201dAt that moment, one of the girls pinched Boss\u2019 cheeks. Boss\u2019 face immediately stiffened. I opened my mouth almost instinctively.\u201cHey. Hey.\u201dPerhaps because I wasn\u2019t loud enough, they didn\u2019t hear me, and Boss\u2019 cheeks were already extended to the limit. I could see her clenching her fists.\u201cHEY!\u201dIn the end, I yelled loudly. This time, I went overboard with my volume. The classroom fell silent in an instant, and everyone\u2019s gazes fell on me. Of course, I didn\u2019t care about any of that.\u201cCan you shut up!? I\u2019m trying to study!\u201dI yelled as I pointed at the notebook on my desk. If Boss exploded, everyone in this room could die.\u201c\u2026What, you think you tell us what to do just because you\u2019re smart?\u201dThough they grumbled unhappily, they stopped messing with Boss thanks to me interfering.Afterward, Boss gave me an odd look, then buried her face on the desk. The rest began to talk behind my back.**For the entire duration of the written exam week, I carefully observed Seo Ijin, who Boss was disguised as. I didn\u2019t just observe her. I even talked to her like a friend, hoping to obtain some SP.She talked like a generic high school girl trying to sound cute, which didn\u2019t suit her at all, and she even bought me an ice cream. I didn\u2019t eat it, and that ice cream was still in my refrigerator.In any case, the written exams ended without much trouble. Cube\u2019s weekend after the exams was desolate. Cadets who pulled all-nighters to study for the exams were focused on going back to their peak physical condition. As a result, the weekend also went by like a breeze.\u201cNow, focus!\u201dMonday finally arrived. It was the day the final exam would really begin.The 1300 first year cadets went to a harbor in Busan, and everyone was currently on ships separated by class.\u201cWe will now begin the baggage inspection.\u201dAs soon as cadets all got on the ship, the instructors began the baggage inspection.Three instructors each called on cadets, and it eventually became my turn.I entered a room where an instructor was the only one in it and handed him my magic pouch.\u201cWeight?\u201d\u201c10kg.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d\u201cFood, tent, frying pan, torch, grill\u2026 things like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m opening it.\u201d\u2018Why ask what\u2019s inside if you\u2019re going to open it?\u2019As I grumbled inwardly, the instructor pulled everything out of the bag. He stared at the assortment of items in disbelief.\u201cWhy did you prepare so much?\u201d\u201cWell, the announcements said that a single exam will go on for the whole week, so I had a general idea of what the test would be. I prepared accordingly.\u201d\u201c\u2026Clever.\u201dThe instructor grinned, but still carefully looked through everything. Then, he sent me back. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t find out about Evandel\u2019s Seed. I brought it with me since it could hatch at any time. It seemed he thought it was a slightly big almond or something.\u201cHua.\u201dAfter the inspection, I sat down on a bench near the ship\u2019s bow.In the distance, I could see an island coming into view. A countless number of drones were flying around the island like seagulls.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m a bit nervous.\u201dNow that the exam was right under my nose, I began to grow nervous. This exam would be difficult, especially since I couldn\u2019t use my Desert Eagle.\u2026No, I could use it. I just had to avoid being seen by those drones.And there was a simple way to avoid their watch.I just had to hack into them.\u201cNow, I will explain how this exam will work.\u201dOnce the baggage inspection finished, an instructor came out to explain the rules.\u201cIn 30 minutes, you will split into groups of 10 and land in different areas of that island. You will stay there for five days, and you will have to survive on your own. We will, however, provide half a day\u2019s worth of food.\u201dThe food supply had decreased from a full day\u2019s worth of food in the original story to half a day\u2019s worth of food.At the instructor\u2019s shocking words, the ship began to get noisy.\u201cThe exam is rather simple. The number of points you get will be your grade. Obtaining points is equally simple. There are wild animals and monsters living on that island. Wild animals are obviously there for you to eat, and monsters will be what you hunt to gain points. Depending on their rank and grade, you will get 1 to 10 points. You should have all received special smartwatches for this exam. Scan their corpses with them, and you\u2019ll be able to see the number of points you got.\u201dThe instructor\u2019s explanation continued for a while.In summary, cadets could steal, sell, and buy points from each other. They could eliminate other cadets, from which they would gain an additional 5 points on top of all the points the eliminated cadet had. However, cadets could only fight each other after the first 12 hours.\u201cIn addition, exam overseers will have huge nametags on their chest. Although I doubt anyone can succeed, you can steal these nametags for 200 points each.\u201dDespite the huge point values these nametags had, no one seemed interested in them.\u201cFinally, you see that tower in the middle? You are eliminated if you have your smartwatch stolen, so you can head to the tower and wait for the end of the exam.\u201dOnce the instructor\u2019s explanation ended, heavy tension emerged from the ship\u2019s deck. No one was talking to each other. Soon, the instructors brought out boats. Cadets would now be transported to the island in groups of ten.\u201cChae Nayun, Jin Yooyun, Selen, Haize\u2026\u201dThe starting group was very important as it determined your potential teammates or enemies.\u201cKim Hajin, Jin Seoha, Yoojoong, Wang Shifu, Blen\u2026 Rachel, Tara.\u201dI got on the boat and exchanged awkward looks with nine other cadets. Rachel was also in my group.Soon, the boat set off. I gazed at the island and fell in thought. Rachel would be exposed to the greatest danger in this exam. Lancaster, who was already resentful towards her, had become a bigger threat in this world on top of becoming more aggressive.\u201cHere\u2019s your stop.\u201dBut before I could carefully plan out my actions, the boat arrived at the island.The moment we landed, I talked to Rachel.\u201c\u2026Rachel-ssi, would you like to team up with me?\u201dI didn\u2019t expect her to agree, and Rachel shook her head as I expected.\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable going alone.\u201dThat\u2019s what Rachel said. However, I didn\u2019t simply back down. I gave her my exam smartwatch\u2019s live coordinates. This exam smartwatch had three functionalities \u2013 scanning monsters, allowing for point trading, and location sharing. The latter two functionalities were there to encourage teaming up.\u201cJust in case you change your mind.\u201dI spoke as I pointed at my watch, then Rachel smiled and left. Meanwhile, the remaining cadets were murmuring to themselves about me being rejected. Since these guys didn\u2019t seem useful, I also just went on my way, running into the forest.After finding a random tree to lean on, I opened my laptop. It took a reasonable amount of SP to access the drones\u2019 servers. Once I paid, my laptop screen split into 60 smaller screens. Thanks to my Gift, my eyesight could clearly analyze all of them simultaneously.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMost of the important cadets were alone. Chae Nayun was already preparing to get lost, Kim Suho was fighting a monster, and Yoo Yeonha was the only one teamed up with someone. If I remembered correctly, the girl she was with was rank 15. It seemed she already won over a skilled cadet.However, they weren\u2019t who I was interested in.\u201c\u2026There.\u201dI soon discovered a group of five cadets who were part of the repeater class. I had already looked up the faces of those who would be threats. In the original story, only two of those five were Djinns, but it was likely that all five were Djinns in this world.However, there was still some time before they would start to get active. After all, cadets weren\u2019t allowed to fight each other for at least the next 12 hours.Before then\u2026\u201cI guess I should find a camping spot.\u201d1.

Final Exam (2)An hour passed by since I entered the island. I was still walking through the forest.Currently, I was heading to my chosen camping spot, a place that was near a river with a mountain on one side. It was the region the ancient sages would have called, \u2018back to the mountain, face to the water\u2019.I was prepared thoroughly for an exploration. On my right hand was my laptop, which constantly showed drone footages from the island, and in my pocket was a map of the island outputted by the Book of Truth. In other words, I was full of cheat keys.But before I could arrive at the camping spot, I ran into a monster.Clown monkey. Just like its name suggested, it was a monkey with colorful spots on its body. However, its face was a bit grotesque for a monkey, and because it was the size of an adult man, people were taken aback the first time they saw it.\u201c\u2026Jesus, it looks horrifying.\u201dClown monkeys should be low-intermediate rank grade 9. Of course, there were individual differences, but the one in front of me didn\u2019t look any stronger than the average clown monkey.I took out my training handgun.Because it was quick, it would be troublesome if I didn\u2019t finish it in one blow. So, I aimed for its vital point, its tail. Clown monkeys were innately nimble, but because they would lose their sense of balance without their tails, they were easy to deal with.I pulled the trigger without hesitation. The fired magic bullet drew a straight line across the air, then pierced the clown monkey\u2019s tail. It tried to jump up in response to the sudden ambush, but with its tail injured, it lost its balance and fell. I quickly fired five bullets into its head, though the fourth bullet was enough to penetrate its skull.\u201cThat was easy.\u201dAfter scanning the clown monkey\u2019s corpse with the smartwatch, I continued on my way.After about 30 minutes of walking, a river stream appeared.The source of the water was located in the northernmost area of the island, which flowed down and split into eight branches. This river seemed to be a branch of a branch but had no problem to serve as a water source. Furthermore, there was a rocky mountain behind the river and a dense forest above it, making it an ideal camping spot.I took out my tent, which looked like a small disk and could be opened up by imbuing magic power. When I put in some of Stigma\u2019s magic power, the disk moved by itself and formed a huge tent.\u201cWow.\u201dI entered the tent. It was cozier than I imagined. There was even furniture inside, a bed and a small table.Since nothing big would happen at the beginning of the exam, I decided to get some sleep.\u201cHuaam.\u201dWith a big yawn, I jumped on the bed.**Nine hours after the start of the exam.The blazing sun had set, and darkness descended on the island and sea.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dAmidst the fiercely blowing wind, Rachel was sitting on a rocky mountain and collecting her breath.She had set out by herself after rejecting several offers to team up, but now, she was feeling the need to team up more than anyone else.The biggest reason was food.\u201c\u2026Auu.\u201dRachel looked down at her food supply with a mixed feeling. Only half of the provided food remained. She ate only two hours ago, but she became hungry again after scuffling with a monster.Cadets had to find their own food in this place by looking for edible vegetation or hunting wild animals. Anyone could guess that wild animals stayed near rivers.But even if she hunted wild animals, there was the problem of cooking them. Cutting their skin, taking out their bones, and obtaining the meat\u2026 Rachel had no experience with butchery.Since she already hunted six monsters, she could also trade with other cadets. But points were precious. She was trying to eat for the sake of obtaining points, so paying points to buy food didn\u2019t make much sense.When Rachel was pondering with a grave look\u2026A faint scent of meat tickled her nose.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe stood up and looked down the mountain. Below, she could faintly see the red color of fire. It especially stood out in the dark.There were likely cadets there. From the smell, they had to be grilling meat.Rachel swallowed her saliva. Although she still had half of her food supply remaining, she knew she had to save it as much as possible. Not only would the desperate side be at a disadvantage in a trade, the provided food supply was also clean and trustworthy.Rachel jumped down. After running down from a 300m height in just three minutes, Rachel reached the ground. Then, she chased after the smell.Not long afterward, she found five cadets cooking a giant boar. The cadets noticed her presence and turned their gazes.\u201cEh?\u201dThree male and two female cadets. It was a well-balanced group. Rachel stared at them silently.\u201c\u2026What do you want?\u201dThey put up their guard. Rachel estimated their battle prowess. However, it was still too early to fight other cadets. Rachel pointed at the boar.\u201cI\u2019d like to buy some.\u201d\u201cAh~ Haha, you\u2019re working alone.\u201dA male cadet, who seemed to be the group\u2019s leader, stood up. He approached Rachel and held out his greasy hand. Rachel tried to shake his hand anyway, but the man pulled his hand back before she could do so.\u201cAh, my hand is dirty.\u201dHe laughed heartily and continued.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join in. We\u2019re all cadets here. That\u2019s fine with you guys, right?\u201dThe man turned around and gave the others a meaningful look which Rachel couldn\u2019t see.The man then turned back around.\u201cOh right, you must not know our names. We know yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRachel silently nodded. The man scratched his neck and spoke.\u201cWell, Rachel-ssi is famous\u2026 I\u2019m Joo Yeohoon.\u201d**\u201cArgh, where am I?\u201dChae Nayun wandered in the woods for 14 hours. During this time, she hunted 9 monsters, likely placing herself near the top of the leaderboard. It was the result of simultaneously using a bow and a sword.\u201cThere\u2019s no end\u2026\u201dShe plowed through vines and tall grass, but no matter how much she walked, she couldn\u2019t find a useful source of water or food. In fact, she never even ran into a cadet. Now, she was exhausted.When she was on the verge of passing out\u2026Like a light of salvation, a faint torchlight appeared in the distance. She felt that it could even be a campfire.\u201cOooh!\u201dChae Nayun ran towards the light, and as she approached the light, she could smell a spicy fragrance.After escaping the endless field of tall grass, Chae Nayun witnessed the source of the light.\u201cEh?\u201dThere, she saw Kim Hajin munching on a piece of meat. With chopsticks in his hand and a plate full of meat, he was staring at her.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dHe tilted his head and asked.Chae Nayun swallowed hard. Although she favored high-class food, she had moved for 14 hours with little rest or food. She had long since devoured the provided food. If it was something that could be eaten, she was prepared to eat it tastily.Chae Nayun first observed Kim Hajin and his surroundings. There was a huge, cozy-looking tent behind him. The source of the light wasn\u2019t a campfire like she had thought, but a portable grill. Not only that, he had a table, a chair, a frying pan, and packaged meat that was being cooked\u2026\u201cW-What the heck, where did you get all these?\u201d\u201c\u2026I prepared them for the exam.\u201d\u201cWhat? How did you know about the exam to have prepared all these?\u201d\u201cI brought them just in case. Don\u2019t you know I\u2019m number 1 in the world?\u201dKim Hajin tapped on his head and spoke.\u201cI\u2019m pretty damn smart.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, good for you.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s sarcastic remark only lasted for a moment. She swallowed hard looking at the meat.On the other hand, Kim Hajin was wondering if their encounter was brought about by luck. Thinking about it, it did seem like points had walked into him on their own.\u201cYou hungry?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun nodded without speaking.\u201cHow much food do you have left?\u201d\u201c\u2026I lost it when I was fighting a monster.\u201dShe had eaten them already, so she made a small lie.\u201cR-Really, I\u2019m a bit clumsy.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dKim Hajin crossed his arm and fell in thought, while Chae Nayun held her breath and waited for him to speak.\u201cHow many points do you have?\u201dChae Nayun immediately breathed a sigh of relief in her heart. Things were going as she hoped.She killed nine monsters and obtained a total of 35 points, but she didn\u2019t say the truth.\u201cTwenty\u2026 five.\u201d\u201cThen give me half.\u201d\u201cH-Half?\u201dHalf. It was an expensive price to pay for a single day\u2019s meal.\u201cYep, But in exchange, you\u2019re sleepy, right? I\u2019ll also lend you a sleeping bag. Just say no if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cN-No! I mean, yes! I, I want to.\u201dChae Nayun turned on her exam smartwatch. This watch could recognize other smartwatches within a 3m radius.[Kim Hajin]\u2014Point trading\u2014Location sharingShe clicked on \u2018point trading\u2019.Half of 25 was 12.5, but only whole numbers could be used in trading. After thinking about it for a bit, she sent 12 points to Kim Hajin and stealthily sat down next to him. After confirming that he received points, Kim Hajin gave well-cooked pork chops to Chae Nayun.\u201cBut are you okay with just this? They\u2019re pork chops.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll have to eat to live.\u201dChae Nayun heard that something like this was a common occurrence in Dungeons and Towers.She put a pork chop in her mouth. Was it because she was hungry? She found it quite delicious. Then, she saw Kim Hajin dipping his pork chops in a sauce. She did the same thing and found that it was tastier.The two of them continued eating for 20 minutes.During this time, neither of them talked.\u201cAh, now I\u2019m full.\u201dOnce her hunger went away, Chae Nayun felt a bit awkward. She wasn\u2019t particularly close to Kim Hajin. In fact, their relationship was better described as uncomfortable.Just when she was thinking about running away\u2026\u201cHere.\u201dKim Hajin gave her a bottle of water. Chae Nayun only stared at it in hesitation.\u201cIt\u2019s mineral water, not river water.\u201dDid this guy have mind-reading abilities?Kuhum. Chae Nayun let out a dry cough and took the water. Gulp, gulp, kyaa.\u00a0After emptying half of it in one go, she let out a satisfied sigh.\u201c\u2026By the way, what\u2019s that?\u201dThen, she suddenly caught sight of a ring on Kim Hajin\u2019s index finger.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Hajin\u2019s face stiffened. For a moment, he rubbed his ring without talking. It was as though he was choosing his words. Seeing his solemn yet flustered reaction, a flash of insight arose in Chae Nayun\u2019s mind.\u201cAh, nevermind, nevermind. I\u2019m not curious at all.\u201d\u2018I might not act like it, but I\u2019m someone who can take a hint. It must be a keepsake of his family.\u2019 Chae Nayun finished the rest of water without waiting for Kim Hajin\u2019s answer.Meanwhile, Kim Hajin stared at Chae Nayun with the eyes of a dead fish.\u201cI never said you could drink it all.\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d**The next morning arrived. Birds chirped and the howling of monsters rang out from the forest.Waking up to the noise, I got up from my bed. Though I felt a bit stiff, this much was a luxury on this island.\u201cAuuu.\u201dI left the tent to bask in the sunlight. However, no sunlight shone down outside the tent.\u201c\u2026Is it a polar night?\u201dThe outside world was that dark. It was likely because of the magicians of the island\u2019s central tower.I looked around. On the ground, Chae Nayun was buried in her sleeping bag, still asleep. Last night must have been cold as she only had her face peeking out. In a way, she looked like a caterpillar.Tong!Suddenly, the seed sitting on my tent table jumped up. By the looks of it, it had already finished its meal. It must have felt my gaze as it began to quiver.\u201c\u2026Why are you so cute?\u201dI tickled the seed and wrapped it with a new gauze. Then, I retrieved the tent. In the first place, I had no intention of continually staying in the same place. Chae Nayun was still using the sleeping bag, but well, I could just gift it to her.Now that cadets were allowed to fight each other, I had no plans to sit still. I planned on picking fights aggressively, especially against dangerous individuals.Of course, I wasn\u2019t allowed to kill. Some of the Djinns here didn\u2019t even know that they were Djinns, and in reality, they weren\u2019t Djinns yet.That was the difference between a Djinn who contracted another Djinn and a Djinn who contracted a devil.In the case of the former, Djinns were supplied with magic power by their contracted Djinns, so they could avoid going berserk, and their contracts were also less tight. These Djinns were often treated like expendables, being abandoned or killed if they failed their mission.On the other hand, Djinns who directly contracted devils were rarer.Examples of such Djinns were Sven, Yun Hyun, and Lancaster. But because directly contracting devils caused large side-effects, the only \u2018cadet\u2019 on this island who managed to overcome this side-effect was a man named Joo Yeohoon.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go higher.\u201dFor now, my goal was reaching the World Tree located in the center of this island. Although it had a grandiose name, it was just an extremely big tree. It had its roots in the center of the island, and it was called the World Tree solely because of its size.**In just 24 hours since the start of the exam, Yoo Yeonha managed to form her own group. It was a small team made up of five people with Yoo Yeonha as its leader. Utilizing their strength, Yoo Yeonha was amassing points easily and efficiently.\u201cYeonha-ssi, I found someone.\u201dA sharpshooter named Rose whispered to Yoo Yeonha, but before waiting for Yoo Yeonha\u2019s orders, she drew her bow.But right when she was about to fire, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip flew in like lightning and snatched her bow away.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201dYoo Yeonha glared at Rose with stern eyes.\u201c\u2026You can\u2019t touch that man.\u201d\u201cEh? I-Isn\u2019t that person rank 934?\u201dRankings didn\u2019t change until after the final exam, and in accordance with the final exam\u2019s rule, every cadet was wearing a nametag with their rank on it. But even without a nametag, the man Rose was aiming at was someone most people knew.He was known for his gun-related Gift among other things, the rank 934 cadet, Kim Hajin.\u201cNo, you can\u2019t win against him.\u201dHowever, Yoo Yeonha lightly cut her off.At that moment, Kim Hajin made his move. Almost as if to save Yoo Yeonha from having to explain, he climbed up a giant tree with impeccable movements.After reaching the peak of a 150-meter tree in a few breaths, he went into the dense leaves.This series of unrealistic maneuvers caused Rose to be dumbstruck.Yoo Yeonha spoke with a stern voice.\u201cSee that? I just saved your life, Rose-ssi. To that man, a rank is just a number. If you had let go of that bowstring, you would have lost for sure. Not only that, the rest of us would have also been in trouble.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere are many hidden dragons in this world. It\u2019s the same reason that the Hero Association can\u2019t do anything about hunters of the Vast Expanse. Next time, don\u2019t do anything before I give the order.\u201dRose nodded like a child being scolded by her teacher.\u201cAlso, about that man being uncharacteristically strong, keep it a secret.\u201d\u201cEh? Why?\u201dHowever, Rose couldn\u2019t help but question this order. Yoo Yeonha gave a brief explanation.\u201cBecause he might become one of our family members. For the record, I like people with heavy mouths.\u201dRose shuddered.Essence of the Strait, the world\u2019s second ranked guild.For Rose who was a rank 68 cadet, it was too enticing of an offer.\u201cAh, yes! I\u2019ll keep it a secret! Until death!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dAfter generously smiling at Rose who was as obedient as a dog, Yoo Yeonha stared at the giant tree Kim Hajin climbed up.It was a monstrous tree that even the most courageous people would hesitate to climb. Just looking up at the tree would cause one\u2019s neck to hurt, but Kim Hajin had climbed to its peak in mere minutes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201d\u2018Should I modify Kim Hajin\u2019s physical ability rating?\u2019 Yoo Yeonha began to think about her report.Tiiring\u2014At that moment, a message arrived on her smartwatch, ending her thought.\u201cAh, Ijin-ssi contacted us. Let\u2019s go back.\u201dPeople who shared locations with each other could also message each other.This was likely something that Yoo Yeonha was the first to find out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Final Exam (3)Long after Kim Hajin left, Chae Nayun opened her eyes which she had kept tightly shut. She got up only after confirming that Kim Hajin had completely disappeared.She had woken up a long time ago, but her mind was still in a daze. It was most likely because of what Kim Hajin said.\u2014Why are you so cute?\u201c\u2026\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s cheeks flushed red. Her appearance was praised ever since she was young, but she had never expected to hear such a thing from Kim Hajin\u2019s mouth.\u201cAuuu\u2026\u201dChae Nayun shook her head fiercely and shook off her thoughts.\u201cWhatever it was, I didn\u2019t hear it. He was talking to himself. There must have been a cat or a dog nearby. Definitely.\u201dChae Nayun murmured and crawled out of the sleeping bag. The sleeping bag was just as warm and cozy as a bed, something that made her night extremely enjoyable.\u2018Should I leave it here? Or bring it with me?\u2019 Chae Nayun began to think. \u2018Since Kim Hajin left it here after saying\u2026 saying how I was cute\u2026 he must have wanted me to take it.\u2019After coming to that conclusion, she folded up the sleeping bag, which reduced to a size of a fist-sized ball.\u201cWas it this small?\u201dShe was astonished by the tiny sleeping bag. After putting it away, she checked her smartwatch. It was 7:20 in the morning, but it was still dark outside.\u201cIt must be a polar night\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun stretched and began to prepare for the day.**On top of the World Tree, I looked around in all directions. Thousand-Mile Eyes were unrestricted by obstacles, allowing everything to enter my vision.A day had already passed, and cadets were discovering their preferred method of survival. Some sold food to obtain points, some chased after monsters, and some concealed themselves and waited for unsuspecting cadets to walk by.\u201cMm?\u201dWhen I found someone, a rather mischievous idea popped up in my head.A method to blow my nose without using my hand. To be more precise, it was a method to eliminate cadets who were too strong for me to deal with.I snapped off a decently sized tree branch and gave it a sharp end. Then, I inscribed a coordinate and some words on it.Next, I grabbed the tree branch and threw it at \u2018him\u2019. Because he was so far away, I had to use some of Stigma\u2019s magic power.The tree branch flew like an arrow and struck the ground after lightly brushing past his face.The cadet who was walking imposingly stopped and looked at the tree branch on the ground.From where I was, I could only see his back. But I knew very well what emotion he was currently feeling.He grabbed the tree branch I shot out. After checking the words written on the side, he turned to the direction the tree branch came from. Although he couldn\u2019t possibly see me from this distance, I still dodged his gaze.Now, I just had to wait.\u2026Just like that, an hour went by.I was watching the drone footages on my laptop when I suddenly noticed a change.\u201cWhat? Already?\u201dUnder the thick darkness, Rachel was heading somewhere with Joo Yeohoon. I quickly expanded my sight and tracked them. Their destination seemed to be a wooded cliff.At the end of the cliff were two people. One was out in the open, and the other was hiding above a tree.I didn\u2019t know who they were, but I could safely assume that they were Djinns.First, I moved a drone over to them. But to my surprise, the drone\u2019s signal died when it got near. I was notified of the reason by an alert that arrived on my laptop.[Joo Yeohoon \u2013 has various connections with other Djinns. Made contact with Lancaster family Djinns.]\u201c\u2026\u201dRachel accompanying Joo Yeohoon also happened in the original story, but Lancaster was never a part of this exam. But now that he was involved, his goal had to be Rachel.Surprisingly, they were planning on fighting in an open area. Most likely, this was because secluded areas like caves were being used by other cadets as hideouts. Furthermore, because the area they chose belonged to that exam overseer, it was likely that no one would interfere in their plan.But still, their method was too poorly planned.\u201cThey must be the bottom rung.\u201dThese brainless fools were likely part of the lowest class of Djinns who were blinded by their desires to make achievements and be loved by Lancaster. Since they were Djinns, they had to be stronger than average cadets, but they still didn\u2019t look all that strong.However, they were still a threat with three of them working together.I took out my Desert Eagle.After transforming it to a sniper rifle, I peered into the distance.There, I could see Rachel walking with Joo Yeohoon. Rachel likely joined Joo Yeohoon\u2019s team temporarily to find food. In the original story, it was Kim Suho who came to her rescue.I had shared my location with her to prevent this from happening, but she was a stubborn girl.\u201cAh, maybe\u2026\u201dSuddenly, I thought of Kim Suho. To check if he was nearby, I expanded my vision a bit farther.\u201cPft.\u201dEven in this serious situation, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Did the original story have an enforcing power? Kim Suho was slowly walking towards Rachel. Next to him was Chae Nayun, who must have ran into him as well.With this, it was three on three. Even without me having to help, Kim Suho and Chae Nayun would be more than enough to save Rachel.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dHowever, Kim Suho was Kim Suho, and I was Kim Hajin.I had my own methods.I attached my rifle\u2019s gunstock. I could see my targets clearly. My eyes could see further than any scope in the world.**Joo Yeohoon\u2019s team continued to offer Rachel their food. Although they offered it for free, Rachel still gave them some of her points as payment.However, she felt uneasy. She valued her combat exam grades just as much as written exam grades. Since she didn\u2019t know how many points would put her on top, she had to collect as many as possible.In the middle of her worry, Joo Yeohoon asked her to join him for a hunt, saying that they had found a grizzly bear monster that would give 10 points.\u201cI\u2019m a sharpshooter, so I\u2019ll support you from the back. I only need 3 points, and Rachel-ssi can have the rest.\u201d\u201cNo, we should split it evenly.\u201dShe didn\u2019t ask why it was only the two of them going. She followed him readily. In her mind, she wouldn\u2019t lose in a one on one battle even if Joo Yeohoon betrayed her, and she knew she would gain more points if there were fewer people in the group.\u201cIt was here\u2026\u201dHowever, standing on the cliff she was guided to wasn\u2019t a bear, but a man.His long hair covered half of his face, and two gauntlets ominously glowed in his hands. On the fingertips of the gauntlets were claw-like daggers.\u201cWho are you!?\u201dJoo Yeohoon put on his best act. Just in case things went awry, he was preparing an escape route. The long-haired man also played along with him, raising his gauntlet-covered hands and charging at Joo Yeohoon. In the blink of an eye, the man cut Joo Yeohoon\u2019s shoulder, and he screamed and ran away. The man didn\u2019t chase after him.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dJust like that, Joo Yeohoon disappeared.\u2018What was that?\u2019 Rachel sighed as she held up her rapier.\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201dAt her question, the man made a chilling smile.\u201c\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dThe man said something, but Rachel couldn\u2019t understand him. It wasn\u2019t Korean or English. The man murmured to himself, then suddenly charged at Rachel.\u201cUup!\u201dRachel drew her magic power around her rapier and defended herself. Her rapier clashed with the man\u2019s gauntlets, creating hot embers that scattered out. Although the man had more magic power, Rachel could hold on thanks to his rough control.Next, the man\u2019s gauntlets struck down a few more times, which Rachel blocked with ease. Gauntlets versus rapier. The former had greater destructive power, but Rachel overwhelmed him with technique. As long as she maintained a safe distance, she felt she could come out victorious.\u201cHaat!\u201dThen, in the middle of a fierce exchange of blows, Rachel spotted an opening in the man\u2019s defense. Without missing this opportunity, Rachel took a step forward, then rushed in. With a stab, she scratched the man\u2019s ribs, then tried to jump back.However, for some indiscernible reason, she couldn\u2019t move her feet.At that moment\u2026Someone jumped down from the tree above her. It was another enemy. Rachel saw him land in front of her, then twist his sword and stab at her widely open back\u2026\u201cKuaaak!\u201dA scream rang out. Rachel didn\u2019t close her eyes as her thinking stopped momentarily.However, realizing that she was still alive, she reexamined the situation. The assassin, who just dropped down from the tree, was rolling on the ground, writhing in pain.\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dShe looked down at her sword, wondering if she had attacked subconsciously. Immediately afterward, she dropped this nonsensical thought as another attack flew towards her.However, the attack wasn\u2019t aimed at her.Five streaks of highly powerful beams flew in, piercing through the assassin\u2019s stomach, limbs, lung, and heart. The assassin fell to the ground helplessly, then scattered into dust.\u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019Rachel was taken aback, but she didn\u2019t have the time to think as the gauntlet-wearing man shot towards her. The man knew the weakness of long-range sniping. When the target was close to an ally, sniping became virtually impossible.Furthermore, Rachel couldn\u2019t distance herself from the man. By now, she realized that her feet were stuck to the man\u2019s shadow. It was the magic, \u2018Shadow Tag\u2019.Although she couldn\u2019t move her feet, she still did her best to defend and counterattack. Her movements made it seem as though she was dancing in a tiny space.Her nimble, fleeting movements caused the man to become enraged.Frustrated, he tried to stomp down on the ground itself when\u2014 the unidentifiable attack flew in once again. Before anyone could react, the attack dug through the minute gap between him and Rachel, then blasted his shoulder.Using this opportunity, Rachel stabbed at his flank.But before her rapier could reach him, a sword strike flew in and struck the man\u2019s shoulder.\u201cKuak!\u201dWith his shoulder cut, the man took a huge step backward, then jumped down the cliff.\u201cWho was that!?\u201dTwo people ran up to Rachel. Kim Suho and Chae Nayun. They were cadets Rachel knew.\u201cRachel? Who was he?\u201dChae Nayun asked her. Kim Suho ran to the edge of the cliff and looked down.\u201cDid he disappear?\u201dAlthough she couldn\u2019t fully understand the situation, she still asked the question she most wanted to know.\u201cYes, he\u2019s gone.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with that polite speech.\u201dKim Suho mocked Chae Nayun\u2019s sudden use of polite speech.\u2018It must have been Chae Nayun who helped me. That attack must have been her secret technique, something like invisible arrows.\u2019Meanwhile, Rachel tried to understand what happened.\u201cThank you. You saved\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the moonlight reflected off of something and pierced her eyes.That something was underground. It had dug into the ground but managed to reflect a faint moonlight.Rachel slowly approached the object, then picked it up.\u2018\u2026A bullet?\u2019At that moment, Kim Suho muttered seriously.\u201cLet\u2019s move first. We don\u2019t know if that\u2026 person will come back.\u201d**Tzzz\u2014 Tzzz\u2014Rachel examined the bullet on top of a campfire.Staring at it didn\u2019t reveal any new information, but Rachel had a person in mind.Kim Hajin.He had used a shotgun when he helped her before, and the mysterious person who saved her had done so by sniping. However, Kim Hajin was the only one she knew who used a gun.\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dHowever, she couldn\u2019t think of a motive. He helped her during the midterm exam, but that was likely because he was next door.If Kim Hajin was the one who helped her again, then it would mean he helped her from far away through sniping.If that was true, she had three questions.First, how did he know that she was in danger?Second, if he was the one who helped her, why didn\u2019t he show himself?Third, why did he help her?\u201cSo, did you decide to change to a sword?\u201dAt that moment, Kim Suho\u2019s voice rang out. He was talking to Chae Nayun. Rachel turned her gaze sideways and stared at Chae Nayun\u2019s waist. Just like Kim Suho said, she had a sword by her side.Chae Nayun scratched her head as though she felt awkward. Rachel became alert.\u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t want to rely on a bow only during such a big exam. So, um, it\u2019s a secondary weapon.\u201dChae Nayun had brought two main weapons. One was a bow, and the other was a sword. Since cadets could only borrow one main weapon, she had purchased a training sword from Cube directly.\u201cOh, rather than that.\u201dChae Nayun clapped. Clearly, she was trying to change the subject.\u201cRachel, we have a plan. Do you want to come with us?\u201dRachel tilted her head in silence.\u201cIt\u2019s like a cooperation team. You know, we can do fine even without forming teams. So, we\u2019ll each take turns finding food, finding a place to sleep, and standing guard. Then, we\u2019ll go off on our own to hunt, and meet back up later.\u201dRachel thought it was a good idea. After postponing her answer for a moment, she turned on her exam smartwatch.[Location Sharing List]\u2014Kim Hajin\u2014Joo YeohoonKim Hajin.His location was still being shared.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a good idea, but I\u2019ll have to decline.\u201dRachel got up, and in response, Kim Suho blinked his eyes and asked.\u201cWhere are you going? Wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going to meet up with someone.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen we\u2019ll take you there.\u201d\u201cNo, I can go alone.\u201dShe rejected him resolutely. Kim Suho scratched his head and nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t be so cocky. Do you think every girl in the world loves you?\u201dChae Nayun used this opportunity to deal a piercing blow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Final Exam (4)The situation came to an end with Kim Suho\u2019s arrival, but I spent another hour looking around the surroundings before climbing down the World Tree.\u201cAgh, what a pain.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but groan as I landed on the ground. Even though I had Parkour, the tree was just too abnormally big.Shaking off the numbing feeling in my hands and legs, I checked the number of points I had.[22 Point]22 points. It should be a bit below the average. Since I practically took 12 of these from Chae Nayun, the amount I gained from monsters only came to 10 points.In the original story, the first place cadet scored 130 points, so I needed to obtain another 50 points to stay in the safe range.It should be possible as long as I worked busily today and tomorrow.I turned around, thinking optimistically.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut as soon as I did, my body stiffened and my hair stood on ends. I was so mind-numbingly shocked that I couldn\u2019t think of anything.In front of me was the Chameleon Troupe\u2019s boss, who was disguised as Seo Ijin. She approached me without making any sound and was staring at me with her black eyes.Why was she here?Cold sweat ran down my back, and my survival instincts began to roar.I forced myself to calm down. She should be here to observe, not fight.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dBut contrary to my expectations, she took out her sword and pointed it at me.\u201c\u2026\u201dSilently and with unshaken eyes, she stood there. A chilling light flashed from her sword blade.My thoughts ceased. I didn\u2019t know why, but she was undoubtedly picking a fight with me. But whether it be close ranged or long ranged combat, there was no way I could beat this woman. I would die instantly or be beaten painfully until I die.\u201cYou know what.\u201dShe spoke with a tranquil voice. Just like she said, cadets were currently enemies.However, this woman was simply too powerful to be an enemy. It was the same reason that insects couldn\u2019t call humans their enemies. To them, humans were predators.But in this life-or-death situation, I found a glimpse of hope.In this exam, cadets didn\u2019t fight each other to kill. What was important was to take the other side\u2019s exam smartwatch. Even if you subdued someone, if you didn\u2019t take that cadet\u2019s smartwatch, it wasn\u2019t your victory. Additionally, if you subdued someone, but had your smartwatch taken, it was your loss.Currently, the smartwatch around her left wrist was loose.It could be that she equipped it loosely to begin with, or that it was unable to withstand her unleashing of magic power and became loose, or that I was simply lucky.Regardless of the reason, this was the only way I could escape this situation.From my sleeve, I began to weave Aether to be thin, thinner than a spider thread.Then, I controlled the thread so that she couldn\u2019t see it. Like a worm trying to dodge a preying hawk\u2019s eyes, it slowly squirmed towards her left wrist.Currently, her focus was entirely on me. Just meeting her deep eyes seemed to strangle me, but I continued to stare into her eyes. That\u2019s how I bought time.Eventually, the Aether thread reached her left wrist, then took off her smartwatch without her noticing.At that moment, she opened her mouth.\u201cYour weapon, take it out.\u201d\u201c\u2026Weapon?\u201dWhen I asked, she gave a simple nod. Meanwhile, the Aether thread was traveling to her wrist, hovering only a centimeter above the ground, as Boss\u2019 close proximity to me made the ground her blind spot.When the smartwatch came close enough, I yanked it into my hand.\u201cWhew.\u201dWas it because of my luck? Or was it Boss\u2019 clumsiness? In any case, I succeeded. I breathed a sigh of relief.Next, I reached into my pocket, pretending to take out my weapon, but brought my hand up holding Boss\u2019 smartwatch.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re surrendering?\u201dWhen she saw the smartwatch, she gave a disappointed look. As I thought, she really didn\u2019t notice.Because her skin was an added layer from Jain\u2019s Gift, it didn\u2019t have the same level of sensitivity as her normal body. Not to mention, she hadn\u2019t released any of her seals yet.\u201cDoes this look like it\u2019s mine?\u201dI asked as leisurely as I could, and Boss immediately furrowed her brows.I pointed at her wrist with my eyes. She tilted her head in doubt, then slowly turned her head down to her left wrist.\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dHer eyes widened. She rotated her wrist around, confirming that her watch was gone.\u201cYou know you\u2019re out the moment I crush this, right?\u201dI spoke as calmly as I possibly could. Boss still seemed to so be in shock that she didn\u2019t notice as she was in a daze. She was only staring at her wrist as though she had lost her country.\u201cThis\u2026 this can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dWould that reaction get me about 50SP?I feigned a carefree smile before gently grabbing her wrist and putting her smartwatch back on.\u201cW-What, what are you?\u201dShe acted even more flustered than when I stole her watch, but I continued to put the watch around her wrist.Still maintaining my smile, I bluffed.\u201cI\u2019ll let you go this one time, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026Let me go?\u201dMeanwhile, her sword was still aimed at my neck. But because I could feel that it had lost its edge, I ignored the sword and turned back.\u201cW-Where are you going?\u201dBoss tried to hold me back. I, of course, ignored her and continued forward. I focused on my legs more than ever before in my entire life. Just by meeting her eyes for a bit, my entire body felt numb.**After Kim Hajin left, Boss stared at the smartwatch on her left wrist. Even now, she couldn\u2019t understand how Kim Hajin managed to steal it.Her plan was to confirm Kim Hajin\u2019s ability, but she was only left with greater shock.Even though half of her sense of touch was gone because of Jain\u2019s Gift, she never expected to suffer such humiliation to a 17-year-old cadet.She pondered, \u2018When did he snatch it? When we first met? When we were staring at each other? No, neither can be right At the very least, Kim Hajin never moved his body. His magic power didn\u2019t show any sign of movement either.\u2019Boss turned her gaze to her right wrist on which a four-leaf clover was tattooed. This was a Seal Release Spell. Each of the clover\u2019s four leaves sealed a portion of her true strength. Staring at the completely sealed clover leaves, Boss wondered if she should have had one of them released.\u201cHaa.\u201dIn the end, she asked for help from an eyewitness.\u201cJain, did you see?\u201d\u2014\u2026Hm? See what?But the reply she got after a short delay wasn\u2019t what she expected. Jain sounded like she didn\u2019t know the current situation.Boss\u2019 face immediately contorted with a frown.\u2014Ah, ah, ah, sorry. I got distracted for a moment. But it\u2019s not my fault! Droon kept pestering me to buy him Legos. So, what\u2019s up?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBoss immediately continued her thought, \u2018Kim Hajin stole my watch in that short amount of time? Even though my power is sealed, his dexterity and craftiness are beyond the level of a cadet.\u2019\u2014Tell me. What happened?\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d\u2014No, tell me now, you\u2019re making me curious. Argh, it\u2019s all because of that brat, Droon. Boss? Boss?Boss ended their contact cold-heartedly. With the previous incident, she became certain of Kim Hajin\u2019s potential. Now, she just had to confirm Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak\u2019s\u2026At that moment, her smartwatch rang.[Ijin-ssi, where are you? Hurry up. Didn\u2019t I tell you to come back by the half-hour mark? \u3161\u3161]\u201c\u2026\u201dBoss stared at the message with emotionless eyes.She thought, \u2018Yoo Yeonha. Why did this girl keep ordering me around?\u2019**After successfully escaping from Boss, I found a camping spot.It was just as good as the other one.\u2026But in truth, I had stopped at the first area near a river because I didn\u2019t have any strength in my legs. I thanked my luck once again.After opening up my tent and the foldable table and chair, I sat down and placed my bullets on the table.14 bullets for the sniper rifle and 20 for the shotgun.These were all modified from normal bullets using SP. Although they greatly boosted my strength, each of them cost about 7SP, so I couldn\u2019t easily waste them.\u201c\u2026I should have at least 20 of each type.\u201dIf I ran out of bullets during battle, that would be a disaster.I opened my laptop.[Current SP \u2013 1214]I currently had 1214 SP. To create a decent Gift, I needed about 2000, but because I kept using them to create bullets, my distance to the goal kept increasing.But still, that was better than someone dying.I restocked my sniper bullets and took out my portable grill.I was hungry from using Parkour so much.Today\u2019s lunch was\u2026 braised chicken. It was also too dark to be lunchtime. Without my Thousand-Mile Eyes, I could barely see what was in front of me.From my magical pouch, I took out a frozen chicken.[If you can wield magic power, add some to increase the chicken\u2019s flavor.]After placing the frozen chicken on my frying pan, I imbued magic power like the instruction said. I didn\u2019t know the specifics, but the chicken suddenly became fresh.When I was thinking, \u2018I should be able to eat it now\u2019\u2026Pssss Pssss\u2014A faint sound rang out from the tall grass nearby.I quickly pulled out my gun and aimed it at the direction of the sound. At the same time, I saw through the grass with my eyes and upon finding out who it was, I put down my gun and grinned.Soon, the ruffling noise became footsteps.The person who walked out of the tall grass\u2026 was Rachel.\u201cRachel-ssi?\u201dI acted surprised. There was a leaf sticking out of her hair. It must have fallen on her while she was walking through the forest, but it seemed she didn\u2019t notice.\u201c\u2026\u201dRachel looked around silently. She seemed shocked at the high-tech tent and grill as her mouth was half-open.Other than being silent, her reaction was no different than Chae Nayun\u2019s.\u201cAh, I like to prepare thoroughly.\u201dWhen I said so with a cool smile, Rachel finally snapped out of her daze. She then stared at the grill, where a chicken sat, emitting a tantalizing smell.\u201cWould you like to join me for lunch?\u201d\u201c\u2026Can, can I?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take 4 points to be fair.\u201dI opened another foldable chair. Rachel sat down with slight hesitation.I took out a plate, then placed half of the chicken on it.Lunch then began. Rachel must have been hungry as she finished the chicken silently in just 10 minutes. Even following her eating pace was difficult.The chicken disappeared seemingly in the blink of an eye, and I began to clean up the dishes when Rachel asked.\u201cUm, what have you been doing until now?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dI tilted my head.Seeing as how she came all the way here, she must have realized I helped her.Was she feeling me out?\u201cWell, I was just running around, trying to get points.\u201dI pretended to be ignorant, mostly because it would have been too embarrassing to say, \u2018I\u2019m the one who saved you\u2019.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRachel scrutinized me with a strange expression but didn\u2019t ask further questions. But, she seemed to be thinking about something as she began to stare at the campfire I set up.\u2026I thought she\u2019d keep asking. I was planning on telling her when she asked me for the third time\u2026\u201cOh, did you get hurt?\u201dThen, I suddenly discovered a fairly deep wound near her collarbone. It seemed she got it from her previous fight with the Djinns.\u201cAh, yes. Something happened\u2026\u201dAt that moment\u2026Evandel\u2019s Seed, which I had placed inside my pocket, suddenly popped out.\u201cAh?\u201dThe seed bounced towards Rachel, then jumped on her collarbone. Rachel shrieked at the unexpected ambush.\u201cAh! W-What!?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, um, you see\u2026\u201dI shot up, just as surprised as she was.\u201cAh, this, what is this!?\u201dRachel tried to pull the seed off of her, but the seed cleverly jumped inside her clothes, specifically towards her armpit area. I froze as I could no longer do anything about it.\u201cYou see, it\u2019s um\u2026 my pet almond\u2026 er, not almond, pet seed. Um\u2026\u201dWhile I was making excuses, Rachel put her hand into her clothes. I quickly turned around.Next, a splattering resumed.After a bit of a fierce struggle, the situation seemed to have been dealt with as Rachel\u2019s deep sigh rang out.I slowly turned around.Rachel was tidying her clothes with a flushed face. I dropped my head first and foremost. I didn\u2019t think the seed would do that.\u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRachel looked back and forth between me and the seed, then spoke.\u201c\u2026A pet seed?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh, yes. Yes.\u201dIt sounded just as stupid in my head as it probably did in hers, but since this world was full of mysterious things, I hoped she would buy it. In truth, I didn\u2019t have a better excuse to give.Rachel let out another sigh, then handed me the seed.\u201cI think it\u2019ll be calmer\u2026 if you raise it by planting it in the ground.\u201d\u201cR-Right.\u201dI took the seed and trapped it in a container.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Final Exam (5)After lunch, when the awkward atmosphere caused by Evandel\u2019s Seed died down, Rachel offered me to team up. She brought up the task cooperation team that she formed with Kim Suho and Chae Nayun in the original story.I couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cYou\u2019re saying the same thing as Chae Nayun.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Did Chae Nayun make the same offer before me?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Anyways, I like the idea.\u201dI didn\u2019t see a reason to refuse. After all, it was Rachel.But when I accepted, Rachel made a worried face as though she had something on her mind.\u201cOh right\u2026 um, there\u2019s someone I formed something like a team with.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dBecause I was watching her from the beginning, I already knew who she was talking about.\u201cHave you heard of Joo Yeohoon\u2026?\u201dI replied confidently.\u201cDon\u2019t mind him.\u201dI didn\u2019t explain things to her in detail, but I had already taken care of him. To be precise, I gave him to an even stronger psycho.\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just team up with me.\u201dI made a meaningful smile.No matter how powerful Djinns who contracted with devils were, there were cadets they couldn\u2019t touch due to a few reasons.And Shin Jonghak was most certainly one of such cadets.**After offering Rachel to Lancaster\u2019s Djinns, Joo Yeohoon hunted monsters to rack up points before returning to his base.However, the base he returned to wasn\u2019t the base he knew. What should have been a cozy abode emanating the smell of wild boar and deer was now the complete scene of a disaster.The grass hut he built was collapsed, and the blood and flesh of animals littered the ground.For a moment, he was worried he came to the wrong place.\u201c\u2026What.\u201dHowever, a man was sitting arrogantly and proudly in the center of the mess as if to pronounce to the world that he was the culprit behind this chaos. Just like an emperor sitting on his throne, he was fiddling with the exam smartwatches he had stolen.Joo Yeohoon stared at the man blankly.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dThe man was the first to speak. His deep voice resounded imposingly.He placed the smartwatches to the side, then threw a tree branch at Joo Yeohoon. Like an arrow, the tree branch shot past Joo Yeohoon\u2019s face and dug into a tree behind him.Joo Yeohoon swallowed hard. He knew very well how dangerous this man was. With a trembling voice, he called the man\u2019s name.\u201c\u2026Shin Jonghak.\u201dJoo Yeohoon had a relationship with Shin Jonghak since the Agent Military Academy, a bad relationship. Part of the reason he contracted a devil was Shin Jonghak.However, Joo Yeohoon couldn\u2019t do anything about the current situation. Not only was he unconfident in winning in a one on one battle, he could see some of the strongest cadets standing behind Shin Jonghak. The newest star in martial arts, Kim Horak, the wavebreaker swordsman, Jin Hanjun, archer Oh Jihoon\u2026\u201cLooks like the trash can talk.\u201dShin Jonghak sneered as he held up his spear. Then, his expression contorted to a fearsome frown.\u201cIf you got held back, you should\u2019ve stayed in the trashcan where you belong. Why try to overstep your position?\u201dJoo Yeohoon couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.He glanced at the tree branch Shin Jonghak threw at him. Written on its side was a coordinate of his group\u2019s base and a provocative sentence.Joo Yeohoon clicked his tongue.\u201cI\u2019m not the one who sent this. It\u2019s someone else\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dShin Jonghak cut him off. He wasn\u2019t stupid. He had already come to the conclusion that someone with a grudge against Joo Yeohoon had sent the tree branch to him.However, what displeased Shin Jonghak was that he was being bothered because a trash did something to earn someone\u2019s grudge.\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dAs though those words were a command or a sign, his lackeys slowly approached Joo Yeohoon.\u201cI just don\u2019t like trash like you. Damn snakes who only know how to flicker their tongues in the shadows.\u201dShin Jonghak held up his spear.5 vs 1.Joo Yeohoon didn\u2019t have a choice.He quickly turned around and began to run. Shin Jonghak immediately sent his spear flying.**On a high ground slightly north of the center of the island stood the Overseer Tower, the place where exam overseers and eliminated cadets rested.In this exam, overseers not only examined cadets\u2019 abilities but also their characters. The rule that cadets could fight other cadets was necessary since Djinns were the main enemies of Heroes, but cadets would be penalized if they stole points in an inhumane way.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dOn the other hand, Yun Seung-Ah, who was participating in the exam as an overseer, was currently looking out of the Overseer Tower\u2019s window.\u201cAre eight drones not enough? You\u2019re looking out the window too?\u201dThen, a Latino man named Vieri approached her.\u201cWho are you thinking about?\u201dHe looked like he would speak Spanish, but his sweet Korean accent showed that he lived in Korea for a long time. Yun Seung-Ah glanced at Vieri, then spoke.\u201c\u2026Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cMm? Who\u2019s that? Weren\u2019t you a fan of Kim Suho?\u201dYun Seung-Ah smiled. Kim Suho was, of course, her number one priority. This was an unquestionable fact, and up until now, Yun Seung-Ah had only watched Kim Suho. She had even revealed herself to him to let him know that she was watching.However, information that everyone knew couldn\u2019t be called information.For now, she planned to focus on finding hidden talents.\u201cI received an interesting piece of information.\u201d\u201cInformation? What is it?\u201d\u201cHow can I tell you? It\u2019s top secret.\u201dThe Korean Peninsula was a tiny piece of land, but numerous guilds were concentrated in it.To survive, not fall behind, and surpass other guilds, a fierce battle of information and politics went on between them.The same matter applied to a guild\u2019s internal affairs, especially to a guild like Essence of the Strait with divided factions.Using this power struggle inside Essence of the Strait, Yun Seung-Ah managed to steal an interesting piece of information.\u201cThat makes me more curious. Can\u2019t you just tell me? We\u2019re in the same guild after all.\u201d\u201cWho can trust your big mouth?\u201dTwo days, Yun Seung-Ah obtained a top-secret document called Yoo Yeonha Report. In this report, Yoo Yeonha evaluated Kim Hajin higher than Kim Suho.\u2026Of course, if a normal person said something like that, he would be treated as a madman. However, the writer of this report was special.Yoo Yeonha. Although she was young, she was more clever than a fox, and she was one of the closest people to Kim Hajin. While she might be inexperienced, she wouldn\u2019t have submitted such a report without thorough research.\u201cSo? Are you going to go check him out?\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 I will later when I have time.\u201dOf course, it could be that this information was fake. However, Yun Seung-Ah had already discovered something strange about Kim Hajin, the magic power of light.Kim Hajin had already awakened the magic power of light. For a cadet like that, she was willing to risk her time.\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201dVieri asked. Yun Seung-Ah pointed at the nametag on her chest.[Rank 307 Yun Seung-Ah]This rank wasn\u2019t the cadet rank, but the world rank. Even this rank didn\u2019t take into account her accomplishments from last year, so once the updated ranking came in on July, she predicted it would be about 50 ranks higher.\u201cThis is worth 200 points, right?\u201d\u201cHa, you\u2019re going to use that as bait? I doubt anyone will fall for it. They\u2019ll just run.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really? Then I guess I\u2019ll just have to hide and watch.\u201dYun Seung-Ah smirked without denying the matter.**Because of the darkness blanketing the island, it was hard to tell whether it was day or night.Rachel, who volunteered to be the night watch, glanced at the huge tent next to her. She couldn\u2019t see inside of it, but this also meant she wasn\u2019t visible to whoever was inside.She rummaged through her pocket and took out a bullet. Under the thick darkness, the tiny platinum bullet sparkled from the moonlight.She still couldn\u2019t believe that such a tiny thing protected her.Placing the bullet in her pocket, she fell into thought. She was convinced that it was Kim Hajin who saved her. After all, he was the only cadet who used a gun.The question she had was why he denied it and how he knew that she was in trouble.Was it because of the cold wind? Or was it because of the pale moonlight?Rachel ended up recalling a memory from a long time ago. The image of a man smiling gently surfaced in her head. This wasn\u2019t in Korea but in England.\u2014No matter what happens, I will protect you, princess. Of course, I\u2019m sure there are many more who wish to protect you.However, the man returned to her as the most fearsome assassin.Lancaster. Every time she thought about him, a part of her heart trembled as though it was freezing.Today\u2019s ambush was likely his doing as well.\u201c\u2026\u201dDistressed, Rachel buried her face between her knees.\u2018Should I have died with them back then?\u2019 Sorrowful emotions resurfaced in her heart.**I woke up on my tent\u2019s bed. There was no sunlight shining through. The outside was just as dark as before I went to bed.Was it going to be dark for all five days?I yawned as I left the tent.Rachel, who volunteered to be the night watch, was sitting modestly by the table, waiting for morning.Was it because I was half-asleep? She looked like an elf. For a moment, I stared at her in a daze.Rachel tilted her head as if she found my gaze strange, then spoke.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s today\u2019s menu?\u201dAt those words, I snapped back to reality. What was I thinking about a character I created?\u201cAh, um, let me wash my face first.\u201dI trudged to the river, then washed my face. Next, I dried my face with a towel and walked back.I had overprepared for the exam, so I was overflowing with food.Since we had to hunt monsters today, I went with beef. To make sure Rachel was fine with it, I turned towards her.But before I could open my mouth to ask her what she thought, I saw her staring at me fixedly and was taken aback. No, to be exact, she was staring at my magic pouch, which contained the food.It seemed she really was hungry.\u201cHow\u2019s the beef?\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dShe replied instantly.I took out two pieces of sirloin steak I had marinated beforehand.After heating up the pan, I placed the two thick pieces on it. As I said before, my aunt used to own a BBQ place. I lived by myself for 4 years, and although it wasn\u2019t something to brag about, I worked as a cook in the army.In other words, I was quite an experienced cook.After adding sliced onions and paprika to the pan, I added a special sauce, which immediately emanated a delicious fragrance.\u201cPerfect.\u201dI plated the steak, then gave it to Rachel. Rachel stared at the steak with her eyes sparkling.\u201cWould you like some rice as well?\u201dRachel smiled brightly and nodded.I took her plate and put some rice on it before giving it back to her. After taking the plate, she waited patiently with a knife and fork in each hand. It seemed she wanted me to eat first.\u201cI\u2019m eating.\u201dThe meal began after I cut a piece of the steak off.Perhaps because of the circumstance, it tasted especially good. Not only was it juicy, it practically melted when it entered my mouth. I bought the steak out of curiosity because the packaging said \u2018grade-1 magic power beef raised in highly dense mana environment\u2014\u2019, but it seemed I made the right choice. It was worth its high price.Our breakfast ended in 10 minutes, just like before.After drinking some water to rinse my mouth, I checked my exam smartwatch.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s this?\u201dFor some reason, I had 4 more points than yesterday.\u201cA monster came while I was on watch. I know I said we should separate tasks and take points from monsters for ourselves, I thought I should split what I got while you were sleeping.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dThanks to her, I obtained more free points.\u201cThen let\u2019s split up now. We should go hunting.\u201dI spoke as I got up. Rachel followed suit.**The third day of the exam went smoothly.Even without the Desert Eagle, I could hunt monsters to some degree, thanks to my Gift\u2019s increased grade and Aether. Aether adhered to the training handgun without being found out and strengthened its power. Of course, even with that, I had to avoid monsters above low-intermediate rank grade 6.In any case, I walked along the forest and hunted comfortably. Just like always, I shot from a distance, outside of danger.\u201cA lake.\u201dThen, I discovered a dimly lit lake.Places like this were gold mines.There should be alligator monsters in it, which should give bonus points as they were \u2018ambush monsters\u2019.It was easy for me to lure them out. I just had to shine a light bright enough to blanket the entire lake. And I happened to learn how to do so not too long ago. Though, strictly speaking, I couldn\u2019t say I learned\u00a0it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018Light Sphere\u2019.It was the magic Yoo Yeonha said no one else could perform.With Stigma\u2019s magic power, I created a sphere of light radiating brilliantly. The white clump of light floated up, lighting up the surroundings.As soon as I sent the Light Sphere above the lake, I felt a faint movement behind me.\u201cWho is it!?\u201dI yelled loudly, and then the presence disappeared.Whoever it was, they must have been quite skilled to escape my eyes all this time.But now that I noticed, there was no way to avoid my eyes. I peered through the tall grass, my sight expanding far beyond the level of humans. Then, I caught sight of a person.\u2026It was Chae Nayun.She slowly backed off, then came to a stop. It seemed she planned to resume tailing me once the situation died down.Tang.I shot a bullet at the ground in front of her feet.Chae Nayun\u2019s short scream rang out in the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Final Exam (6)Hiik\u2014!Soon after a short scream, Chae Nayun jumped out of the tall grass. With a sour expression, she slowly approached me.\u201cWhy were you following me?\u201dI asked with my gun still pointing at her.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t misunderstand. I wasn\u2019t following you.\u201dChae Nayun spoke as she scratched her face.\u201cThen what?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSee, I\u2019m right.\u201dI put my finger closer to the trigger. Chae Nayun started slightly.\u201cWell, before that, how did you do that just now?\u201dWithout being intimidated, she asked about the Light Sphere I just created. I see, so my gun wasn\u2019t threatening enough.\u201cTell me why you were following me first.\u201dChae Nayun furrowed her brows, then finally answered.\u201cI wasn\u2019t following you, I was following Seung-Ah unni.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dI tilted my head. Why did Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s name pop out now?\u201cSeung-Ah? The same Yun Seung-Ah that I know?\u201d\u201cYeah, but you should really address her more politely.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI turned around, pretending to fall into thought while taking out the laptop and checking the drone footage.There were four drones in this area. From one, I could see Yun Seung-Ah sitting on a tree like a cat, looking down at us.\u201cYun Seung-Ah\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, can you stop addressing her with just her name?\u201dI knew that she was here as an overseer and knew who she would be observing.The first two days should be Kim Suho, then the third and fourth day should be other potential talents.If things went according to the original story, she should be watching Jayden by now\u2026. Could it be that I was on her list of potential talents?\u201cHey, now tell me how you made that Light Sphere.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m the one who made it. Anyways, since you\u2019re here, let\u2019s hunt these together.\u201d\u201cNo~! I know you made it, I\u2019m asking how\u2026\u201dChae Nayun couldn\u2019t continue her sentence. Like squids lured to the surface by light, alligator monsters began to emerge from the lake\u2019s depths.Wizard Alligators, low-intermediate rank grade 5~7 monsters.These strange alligators with blue skin had the ability to condense magic power in their mouth and shoot it out. This attack was threatening when used in an ambush underwater, but after surfacing like they did now, their danger level was halved.I pointed at the alligators and made an offer,\u201cHalf-half?\u201dWizard Alligators had tough skin, so it would be difficult for me to kill them with a training handgun. I originally planned to use my Desert Eagle, but I couldn\u2019t now that an overseer was observing me.\u201cFirst, tell me how you did\u2014 Ah, damn it.\u201dAt that moment, an alligator fired a manaball at Chae Nayun.Mm.I was satisfied.My luck even helped me with such trivial matters.**Yun Seung-Ah looked down on the ground from a tree.\u2018\u2026I was almost discovered.\u2019When Kim Hajin created a Light Sphere, Yun Seung-Ah was shaken up. If it wasn\u2019t for Chae Nayun, she would have been found out. Of course, Light Sphere was a magic most Heroes could easily use.But the intensity of the light and the time it was being used were problems. Condensing magic power externally then maintain it, though it sounded easy, it was a fairly difficult technique that even Yun Seung-Ah only mastered on the second term of her first year.\u2018I knew that kid wouldn\u2019t write a baseless report.\u2019Seeing that Kim Hajin had created a Light Sphere of such scale so effortlessly, Yun Seung-Ah smiled in satisfaction.\u2018Kim Hajin. I\u2019ll have to add a star above his name.\u2019**The alligator\u2019s mouth opened wide, and I blasted bullets into it. Wadadada. I emptied an entire magazine, a total of 20 bullets, in one second, an incredible speed.The alligator writhed in pain. However, the injury wasn\u2019t fatal. My attack wasn\u2019t meant to kill, only injure. The real attack came next.A flash of magic power drawing a line.A terrifying magic power towering above a sword blade severed the alligator\u2019s mouth. With its body and mouth separated, the alligator slumped down helplessly.That was Chae Nayun\u2019s sword strike. No alligator could withstand over a single sword strike from her. It was quite literally \u2018cutting in two with one stroke of the sword\u2019[1], a truly awe-inspiring power.\u201cDid you start using a sword?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun put away her sword silently. At the same time, her hands were trembling noticeably. Seeing this, I closed my mouth. Currently, the unpleasant sensation of cutting through flesh should remain on her hands.I didn\u2019t know what that felt like. Not knowing it made me afraid of it more.\u201c\u2026Since there\u2019s four, we\u2019ll each scan two. I\u2019ll take this one and that one.\u201dI scanned two alligators with the exam smartwatch. Out of conscience, I chose the two smaller ones.Chae Nayun then scanned the two alligators, and then the hunt ended.Now, there was no reason for us to be together.\u201cSince we\u2019re done here, you should go.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really don\u2019t want to tell me, huh. Is it so hard to tell me how you made that Light Sphere?\u201dChae Nayun pouted and grumbled.With a small smile, I answered her.\u201cYou\u2019ll get hurt if you find out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dChae Nayun frowned.That was the truth. If I wanted to explain Stigma\u2019s magic power, I had to explain that this world was a world within a novel.\u201c\u2026What nonsense is that?\u201d\u201cJust go. I came here first, so you go that way.\u201dI pointed to a direction, then started walking the other way.Chae Nayun seemed to glare at my back, then finally began to walk\u2026 no, stomp away.*After splitting up from Chae Nayun, I moved busily.Using the Thousand-Mile Eyes fully, I searched for low-intermediate rank grade 7~9 monsters, then killed them. Wolf, deer, octopus\u2026. In just two hours, I obtained 15 points.And now.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI stopped, feeling a presence from the tall grass behind me.It wasn\u2019t that I noticed her presence. The person who was tailing me this entire time revealed her presence on purpose. It seemed she finally wanted to show herself.She must have finished observing me.I patiently waited.Soon, she flew through the trees like a butterfly, then landed about 50 meters in front of me.\u201cHello.\u201dYun Seung-Ah spoke with a bright smile.\u201cThis is the first time since you turned me down, right?\u201dAs a greeting, she brought up what happened at our last meeting. I had cold-heartedly(?) rejected her business card.\u201c\u2026Right, but what is it so suddenly?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. It really is a bit sudden, isn\u2019t it?\u201dYun Seung-Ah nodded in understanding, then continued.\u201cYou see, I\u2019ve been going around to different cadets, giving them a special event. You know, to also test their skill.\u201d\u201cWhat? Event?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYun Seung-Ah pointed at the nametag on her chest.\u201cWould you like to try taking it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAlthough she might not have meant it, her words and the positioning of her finger was perfect for bringing up a misunderstanding.Unaware of my thoughts, Yun Seung-Ah continued.\u201cThe event is simple. I\u2019ll stay here, only using my left hand. If you can make me move even a single step, or if you land an attack other than on my left hand, I\u2019ll give you this nametag.\u201d\u201c\u2026Nametag?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll bet my guild on this promise.\u201dIf she was betting her guild, that was more of a vow than a promise.Thus, I rubbed my chin and pondered.That nametag was worth 200 points, and that should undoubtedly place me in the first place.In that case, what could I gain from getting first place on the final exam?First, I would gain quite a bit of SP as guilds and Djinns would take notice of me.Furthermore, Kim Suho, who was supposed to get the first place, might be encouraged to try harder\u2026. No, no no no.I was forgetting the most important thing, and that was how to take Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s nametag in the first place.\u201cI\u2019ll stay here. Make your decision. You can challenge me, or you can turn back.\u201dYun Seung-Ah added as though she read my thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s quite an unexpected event.\u201dAs I said that, I fired at her without warning. But Yun Seung-Ah instantly struck down the bullets, using just her left hand as she promised. It almost looked like the bullets were plastic straws.\u201c\u2026That was pretty prickly, far more powerful than what a training handgun should be capable of. Looks like your Gift really is related to guns.\u201dIn that previous exchange, Yun Seung-Ah didn\u2019t coat her hand with magic power. Right, she had struck down the bullets purely with her physical ability. Most likely, she wanted to confirm the bullets\u2019 power.For the record, the reason the bullets were stronger wasn\u2019t my Gift, but because of the invisible Aether. By adhering to the training handgun, Aether had strengthened its power.\u201cTry more.\u201dAt Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s words, I pulled the trigger ten more times. Ten bullets flew at her almost simultaneously at different parts of her body. However, Yun Seung-Ah struck them all down without moving a single step. She didn\u2019t use her magic power either.\u201cThat was fast. I thought they were coming at me simultaneously.\u201dYun Seung-Ah muttered leisurely.This\u2026. I might actually have a chance. The handicap she put on herself was that critical. Since I also had two knives, perhaps I could try a feint.With that in mind, I took out the two knives hanging by my waist, then stuck Stigma\u2019s magic power around their handles.\u201cOh~ right. You used a sword before you switched to a gun. Using a gun and sword at the same time, that\u2019s smart.\u201dBothered by her commentary, I threw the knives at her. One towards her chest, and the other towards her face. Then, I fired. Two knives and twenty bullets, I wondered how Yun Seung-Ah would deal with it.Clang!Yun Seung-Ah first struck down the two knives, then took the bullets with her body by mitigating the bullets\u2019 impact. At that moment, however, the two knives sprung back up.Hurriedly repositioning themselves after being flung away, the knives flew towards her heels.She said she would only use her left hand, and her heels were too far for her hands to reach\u2026.However, to my astonishment, she released magic power with her left hand and completely shattered the knives.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dMy attack ended in vain.However, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s expression was that of excitement.\u201cInteresting. You used magic power to change the knives\u2019 trajectory. What technique is that?\u201dYou\u2019re like an onion, Hajin-ssi\u2014!I ignored the last bit of compliment and scratched my neck.There was nothing I could do.Unless a lightning bolt or a meteor suddenly fell on Yun Seung-Ah, this event was impossible to accomplish. Even luck couldn\u2019t cover an absurd difference in skill.I put my gun back in my holster. But Yun Seung-Ah seemed to have misunderstood my intention as the magic power on her left hand became even sharper.\u201cWhat mysterious technique are you trying to show this time~?\u201dWith her hand-blade held out, she smiled.Yun Seung-Ah was still hungry, still unsatisfied. Her desire to collect talent was truly admirable.However, I planned to mercilessly betray her hopes.After collecting the shattered remains of my knives, I turned back without regret. Then, I began to walk back the way I came from.Once I took about five steps, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s dazed voice rang out.\u201c\u2026Hello?\u201dI continued to walk away, and then she took a step forward.\u201cWhere are you going\u2026?\u201dAt that moment!I turned around.\u201c\u2026You said you\u2019d only use your left hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dI pointed at her right foot, then spoke.\u201cBut you just used your right foot.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dImmediately, Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s face became frozen cold.\u201cI\u2019m kidding, hahaha.\u201dI chuckled and turned back.In truth, I was only half-joking and planned to argue with her, but because Yun Seung-Ah\u2019s eyes were too glaringly intimidating, I just gave up.\u2018\u2026Let\u2019s just go back to the tent and eat with Rachel.\u2019**The fourth day.\u201cRachel-ssi, stay with me for today.\u201dDuring breakfast, I told Rachel.\u201c?\u201dRachel tilted her head in the middle of eating.\u201cThe test will end soon.\u201dToday was \u2018that\u2019 day.It was something she should have naturally faced with Kim Suho, but because Rachel was teamed up with me, I had to bring her there.This was a very important event as this was where Rachel would obtain a clue to her enlightenment.\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty crazed. It\u2019ll be too dangerous alone.\u201dIn reality, today was the last day as the exam would end at 9 A.M. tomorrow.\u201cYou have to protect me, Rachel-ssi.\u201dI spoke again. Rachel was about to nod when she suddenly paused, then tilted her head again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear wrong.\u201dI grinned and got up.Butterfly Seedling. It was dangerous for me to even get near it. If I accidentally let its root touch me\u2026 although I wouldn\u2019t instantly die thanks to Aether, I would undoubtedly lose one or two organs.\u201cI need you to protect me.\u201d1.

Hatching (1)The Butterfly Seedling was an elemental type monster.After slowly growing strength in the World Tree\u2019s roots, it would pop out today and cause a mess. I didn\u2019t write a detailed reason, but if over a thousand people suddenly barged into my home, I would be mad as well.In the original story, Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, and Rachel cooperated to kill the Butterfly Seedling, which would then leave two presents. It would give Rachel a hint for her enlightenment, and the Butterfly Seedling Dust for Kim Suho.\u201cCome here.\u201dI glanced behind me constantly, worried that Rachel might run away.Because we were walking around the World Tree, we only managed to kill four monsters. Split between the two of us, we only received 6 points each. I wouldn\u2019t blame her if she made me faint and took my points.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel followed me with an unhappy face. I tried to find as many monsters as possible, but there really weren\u2019t many around.I looked at the time.[1:13 P.M.]The problem was that I couldn\u2019t remember when exactly the Butterfly Seedling appeared. Do I have to keep walking around the World Tree until it appears?\u201c\u2026I think monsters will be on the outskirts of the island.\u201dIn the end, Rachel opened her mouth. She was right. All the cadets were near the outskirts as well.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. \u201cBut I rejected her notion. Rachel pouted, and I continued to walk. Soon, I found Rachel trying to escape to the side path.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just checking if there\u2019s anything nearby.\u201dAfter making a dry excuse, she began to follow me again.Then, after 30 minutes of wandering around the World Tree,\u2026Wooong\u2014I finally felt an unusual vibration similar to an earthquake.I looked towards the direction of the epicenter.From the World Tree\u2019s giant root, a seedling resembling a butterfly emerged. Chae Nayun and Kim Suho were also nearby.\u201cFollow me.\u201dMaking a serious face, I guided Rachel.**Kim Suho was walking through the forest with Chae Nayun. There wasn\u2019t a big reason behind it, just that Chae Nayun kept getting lost.\u201cHey, what do you think about Kim Hajin?\u201dThe forest was still dark. When they were bored, unable to find any monster, Chae Nayun suddenly asked Kim Suho.\u201cKim Hajin?\u201dKim Suho tilted his head as he stared at Chae Nayun.\u201cWhy? Is he on your mind?\u201d\u201cNo, just that\u2026 don\u2019t you think he\u2019s hiding many secrets?\u201dThe Light Sphere, archery duel, and what happened in Paris. Chae Nayun thought there was more to Kim Hajin than meets the eye.\u201c\u2026I guess you\u2019re right.\u201dKim Suho gave a somewhat meaningful reply.\u201cWhat is that reaction?\u201d\u201cWhat? You said he is hiding secrets, and I answered.\u201dKim Suho gave an evasive answer with a smile.In truth, he was half-sure that Kim Hajin liked Chae Nayun. The conversation he had with him in Paris was definite proof.\u201cSo what is he hiding?\u201d\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking about her for far longer than you, and I\u2019ve been watching over her all this time. So I know far more about her than you.How much did someone need to like someone else to say something like that? Kim Suho didn\u2019t know because he didn\u2019t have such a person.\u201cHey, tell me.\u201d\u201cWhy ask me? You should find out for yourself.\u201dWith a blooming smile, Kim Suho teased Chae Nayun.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dAt that moment,Woong\u2014An unusual vibration rang out.Kim Suho and Chae Nayun stared at each other. Without having to exchange any words, they both began to run to the source of the vibration.The epicenter was an open field under the World Tree.When they arrived, they saw a strange butterfly flying around.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dIt looked like a butterfly. It had wings that flapped, and more importantly, it was flying.However, its appearance was far from a butterfly.Its wings were weaved with tree roots, and leaves grew on its face and body. Rather than a living creature, it looked like it was created by a craftsman.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s an elemental monster.\u201dKim Suho was quick to notice. A spiritual existence that absorbed the World Tree\u2019s vitality to form a body. Kim Suho held up his sword, while Chae Nayun pondered whether she should use her sword or bow.\u201cIs it strong?\u201d\u201cLooks like it.\u201dIn the end, Chae Nayun chose the sword. Then, the Butterfly Seedling moved. Its chilling eyes peered down at them, causing Kim Suho and Chae Nayun to flinch.\u201cIt looks super strong.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSuddenly\u2026Koooong\u2014!A large tendril-like root tore through the ground and shot up. Then, several roots followed until the number reached a dozen. Spread out in all directions, they wriggled threateningly, then struck down at Chae Nayun and Kim Suho.The two of them jumped back, dodging the roots.Koong\u2014 Koong\u2014 Koong\u2014 Koong\u2014The roots endlessly shot down.\u201cHey! I think we need to cut them off!\u201dChae Nayun shouted as she dodged, and Kim Suho nodded. The two of them swung their sword against the flying roots.Kim Suho\u2019s blade easily severed a root.But the problem was Chae Nayun. Not only were the giant roots harder than gold, they each carried magic power that strengthened them. For the current Chae Nayun, they were difficult opponents.When Chae Nayun was struggling, a streak of red shot through the darkness, striking the root Chae Nayun was fighting.It was a bullet.There was no physical damage, but fire ignited from the point of contact, burning up the root\u2019s surface. Then, Chae Nayun swung her sword at the weakened root, easily cutting it apart.Next, a crescent moon-shaped sword qi flew at the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s main body, and the Butterfly Seedling barely dodged it by lowering its flight height.Chae Nayun turned to the direction of the two attacks.\u201cEh?\u201dThe strange combination of an average-looking man and a princess out of a fairy tale was Kim Hajin and Rachel.Koong!Soon, more roots shot up from the ground near them. Kim Hajin quickly ran outside their range, while Rachel gracefully dodged the attacking roots.\u201cWhen did you guys come?\u201d\u201cAttack the main body!\u201dKim Hajin shouted, hiding behind a bush.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe main body! Not the roots! Use your bow for today!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing hiding back there\u2026.\u201dA root struck down again, whereupon Chae Nayun shouted as she hurriedly blocked them with her sword.\u201cHey! Support me like before!\u201dHowever, it was Rachel, not Kim Hajin, who sent a blade of wind in support, striking the root and making it fall back. Chae Nayun then made her sword surge with magic power, striking down at the root. With an honest diagonal slash, the root split in half.\u201cOho.\u201dChae Nayun liked the sensation she got, especially when compared to cutting down a living creature. With this, she felt she could do better\u2026She tightened her grip.Magic power surged on her blade, extending the blade to 4 meters. Then, Chae Nayun swung the longsword of magic power with full strength.**\u201cArgh.\u201dChae Nayun was going wild with her sword when a bow was more suited for the situation.Without a choice, I fired my gun, hoping to at least slow down the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s movements.In a single instant, twenty bullets, an entire magazine, shot out. Each time the bullet hit, a part of the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s wings tore off. Although my attacks weren\u2019t powerful enough to detach the wings, the Butterfly Seedling seemingly didn\u2019t like it.A root shot up from its back, which swept through the surface of the ground and shot towards me. I couldn\u2019t close my eyes, its movement clearly entering my eyes.Then, the viciously flying root was stopped right in front of me.A single sword had blocked its advance.The bearer of the sword was Rachel, who appeared like a Hero.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel looked back at me silently. I immediately jumped back to a distance out of reach of the root.At the same time, more roots began to pop up. Although Rachel managed to dodge them with her nimble movements, the roots eventually multiplied until Rachel was completely surrounded.Eventually, a root struck Rachel\u2019s stomach, sending her flying like a toy hit by a baseball bat. Rachel crashed into a tree some distance away, then fell down.She coughed up blood. I watched the scene play out objectively and note that it wasn\u2019t a fatal blow thanks to her qi reinforcement. Still, she wasn\u2019t in a good state.Tong!When I was wondering whether I should take out the Desert Eagle, Evandel\u2019s Seed jumped out of my pocket. Then, it bounced towards Rachel like a hopping rabbit, then adhered to her wounded stomach. Because Rachel was writhing in pain, she didn\u2019t notice the seed.I reluctantly let the seed be. Now wasn\u2019t the time to scold it.\u201cThat damned butterfly.\u201dI glared at the Butterfly Seedling flying about in the distance.If I could just break those wings, Kim Suho should be able to handle the rest\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t just take out my Desert Eagle\u2026.\u201cHuu.\u201dI had no other choice.I took in a deep breath, then imbued Stigma\u2019s magic power into the training gun\u2019s magazine, refining the bullets with fire attribute magic power. I could only refine three bullets, and this was with the training gun, not the Desert Eagle.Were three bullets enough?That was a worry I could think about after I fired.Carefully aiming at the Butterfly Seedling, I pulled the trigger.A bullet flew out, striking the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s wing. Immediately, an explosion erupted.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dI muttered in a daze. Worried that I was seeing things, I rubbed my eyes and saw again.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI wasn\u2019t going crazy. The Butterfly Seedling lost its wings and was now falling to the ground. Its wings weren\u2019t torn. With a single bullet, the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s wings had completely burned down.I was confused. My magic power couldn\u2019t possibly have such power.I observed my surroundings carefully. There had to be a reason unrelated to me\u2026.Sure enough, I could see a woman hiding in the bushes. With an expressionless face, she was holding onto a bead-like object, eyeing the Butterfly Seedling with a greedy look.It was Seo Ijin.\u201cAh.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t my attack that shot down the Butterfly Seedling, but hers. It wasn\u2019t a coincidence. She had made it look like I was the one who shot it down so that she could remain in hiding. Her goal was undoubtedly to take the Butterfly Seedling Dust.At that moment, Kim Suho charged at the fallen Butterfly Seedling, easily cutting it in half with his sword.Then, a golden dust suddenly rose up, lighting up the sky like a firework.However, this wasn\u2019t the Butterfly Seedling Dust.It was a sleeping powder that Seo Ijin threw out. I blocked my nose and mouth, then looked around. Kim Suho could resist status effects to a certain degree, but he was currently in a daze from the beautiful sight. On the other hand, Chae Nayun was seemingly half-drunk.Meanwhile, Seo Ijin made her move.I tried to stop her\u2026 but a giant light suddenly erupted, grabbing my attention.My jaws dropped automatically.**Under the golden dust sparkling in the sky, Rachel felt herself becoming drowsy.She felt sluggish and sleepier than ever before. It seemed it was an elemental\u2019s power.Knowing that the monster was dealt with, she closed her eyes.Although she couldn\u2019t believe it, the Butterfly Seedling was blown up by a single bullet from Kim Hajin. Since they killed such a power monster, she felt safe in taking a break.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018If first place is too much to ask for, please let me take third place at least\u2026.\u2019But suddenly, a giant light pricked at her eyes. The light was so intense that she could feel it even with her eyes closed. As a result, she opened her eyes narrowly.A golden clump of light was shining on her stomach. The light glimmered brilliantly, then began to form a human shape.Rachel stared at the light embracing her.No, it wasn\u2019t a light.It was a child, perhaps about 3 years old.For some reason, Rachel felt a familiarity from the child\u2019s face.Soon, she found out why. The child looked like her younger self.The girl embracing her gave her warmth. It felt like the injury on her stomach was being healed. Rachel subconsciously stroked the child\u2019s hair, and the child smiled in response. It was a clear, innocent smile.Rachel smiled back.However, when the child opened her mouth, Rachel\u2019s face stiffened.She wanted to ask the child to repeat what she just said. But before she could do so, golden dust fell on her head.Her mouth refused to move, and the drowsiness she felt became heavier.She slowly closed her eyes.The child had said a single word, \u2018Mommy\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hatching (2)I was caught off guard at the seed\u2019s sudden hatching, but then quickly snapped back to reality.Currently, a densely packed golden dust blocked everyone\u2019s vision. No overseers or drones could capture what was happening, and Rachel had also fallen asleep. As long as I remained calm, I could deal with everything easily.First, I took Evandel off of Rachel.\u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cAh, aaang.\u201dEvandel struggled to stay with Rachel but widened her eyes when she saw my face.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m the one who raised you.\u201dConsoling her, I held her in my embrace. She looked just like a 3-year-old child, but she was as light as a feather. Hugging me tightly, Evandel muttered.\u201cDaddy.\u201d\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m not. Anyways, can you change back to a seed, Evandel?\u201d\u201cSeed?\u201d\u201cYep. Small and circular. You have to hide.\u201d\u201cWhat about Mommy?\u201dEvandel spoke as she glanced at Rachel. I was a bit perplexed at Evandel calling Rachel Mommy.\u201cRachel\u2026 um, Mommy is really busy. So\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuaam. I\u2019m sleepy.\u201dEvandel yawned as her eyes narrowed. It seemed Boss\u2019 golden dust was also affecting Evandel. I was feeling a bit panicked. If Evandel fell asleep now, there wouldn\u2019t be a way to hide her\u2026.But thankfully, Evandel listened to my request.With a golden light, Evandel transformed into a giant seed that floated down on my palm.\u201cWhew.\u201dAfter breathing a sigh of relief, I looked around.The field was full of the mysterious golden dust. Kim Suho, who was resisting the drowsiness fairly well, had now fallen asleep. The few overseers who were watching us from nearby trees also fell down, unable to withstand the dust\u2019s power.However, I was fine. It was thanks to Aether\u2019s \u2018owner defense function\u2019. I could feel that Aether had formed something like a filter for my nostrils and throat.Although breathing was a bit difficult, I could remain unaffected by the sleeping powder. With my mind clear, I approached Seo Ijin.**Butterfly Seedling Dust.Byproducts of elementals generally fetched a hefty price. Boss didn\u2019t know what function this dust had as it was her first time seeing such an elemental.However, she was quite a greedy woman.She kneeled in front of the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s corpse, and from the huge gaping wound on its body, she could see a clump of blue, glowing dust. Her eyes flickered with greed, and she carefully picked it up.\u201cPut it down.\u201dAt that moment, the deep voice of a man stopped her. She slowly raised her head. There, she saw Kim Hajin.\u201c\u2026Hello.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not something you can take.\u201dKim Hajin\u2019s face distorted viciously.She stared at his face, then looked around.The surrounding air was filled with her sleeping powder, but for some reason, Kim Hajin was unaffected. The golden dust was something no cadet should be able to endure, yet Kim Hajin was doing so with nothing but his bare body.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt was strange. There was too much about this man that she didn\u2019t understand. At this moment, she felt a powerful urge to observe him.From under her feet, black magic power shot up fiercely. The magic power formed a spherical shape that swallowed her and Kim Hajin, forming a sealed space of sorts.Even though Kim Hajin was trapped in what should be an unexpected sealed space, he showed no signs of being unrest\u2026. No, his hands were trembling.She revealed her real face to Kim Hajin, whereupon his body shook greatly.\u201cYou know me.\u201dKim Hajin retorted concisely.\u201cLi Xiaopeng-ssi.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u2018Who was Li Xiaopeng?\u2019 Boss pondered momentarily. Then, realizing it was one of her fake identities, she nodded.\u201cRight. Then why would I be here?\u201d\u201cTo serve as an overseer, I assume.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKim Hajin seemed to have a strange misunderstanding, but Boss didn\u2019t go out of her way to correct it.\u201c\u2026When did you find out I was Li Xiaopeng?\u201d\u201cJust now\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you lie, I\u2019ll kill\u2026 no, hit you.\u201dKim Hajin let out a dry cough.\u201c\u2026When I took your watch, I was looking at you from close range. It was then that I realized something was off.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dJain\u2019s Gift couldn\u2019t be seen through so easily. It was close to impossible to notice anything just by \u2018looking\u2019.\u201cI have great eyes, you see\u2026.\u201dSo what Kim Hajin was saying didn\u2019t make sense.Kim Hajin had not only seen through Jain\u2019s Gift, but also her necklace. It couldn\u2019t be explained with him just having good eyes\u2026.Countless thoughts raced through her brain. Repeatedly considering all possibilities and selecting the most logical choice, she came up with a hypothesis.\u2018The attribute of his magic power is itself anti-magic?\u2019If the attribute of Kim Hajin\u2019s magic power was anti-magic; in other words, if his physique made it so that all magic power he took into his body received the property of anti-magic, he could indeed see through Jain\u2019s Gift just with his eyes. He would only have to concentrate magic power in his optic nerves.In other words, this wasn\u2019t a matter of his Gift, but his \u2018physique\u2019.Of course, this was pure speculation, one that was extremely unlikely because of the absurdity of the matter. To confirm this, she would need to observe and measure his power carefully.However, if he really had such a physique, Kim Hajin was a resource that she couldn\u2019t lose.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBoss silently kneeled down, then grabbed the clump of dust lying in the Butterfly Seedling\u2019s body. Kim Hajin swallowed hard, but to his surprise, Boss handed him the Butterfly Seedling Dust.\u201cI will give this to you, but in exchange\u2026\u201dShe paused.Her silence continued for a long time. It was because she couldn\u2019t think of what to say next.\u2014Don\u2019t say strange things, Boss.Jain\u2019s voice rang out in her ears. It seemed she was properly observing the situation this time.\u2014If you don\u2019t know what to say, just ask him for a way to contact him. Don\u2019t rush it and take it slow.Jain\u2019s voice was solemn, which was a rare occurrence.Although the Chameleon Troupe already knew all of the ways to contact him, Boss took Jain\u2019s advice.\u201c\u2026Give me your number.\u201d**The uproarious fourth day went by, and the morning of the fifth day arrived.The laborious final exam came to an end at last.The Butterfly Seedling was a monster that overseers didn\u2019t expect to see, causing a small disturbance, and in the end, they agreed to give the four cadets who defeated it 20 points each.Cadets then turned in their exam smartwatches before getting on the ship back to Cube. The eliminated cadets had already left last night, so only about 700 cadets remained.The ship cut through a blue sea. Leaned against the guardrail on the ship\u2019s bow, I admired the beautiful waves before taking out my smartwatch.The Chameleon Troupe, or Li Xiaopeng, had yet to contact me.But why was Boss interested in me?\u201cHey.\u201dWhile I was in thought, Chae Nayun approached me.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201c\u2026How did it end?\u201d\u201cHow did what end?\u201d\u201cThe fight. I don\u2019t have any memory of what happened after the middle.\u201dChae Nayun scratched her cheek with her eyes on the sea.\u201cKim Suho said your bullet destroyed the monster\u2019s wings\u2026 he\u2019s lying, right?\u201d\u201cObviously, how could anyone destroy that monster\u2019s wings using a gun?\u201dI spoke honestly since it really wasn\u2019t me who did it.\u201c\u2026Right? That\u2019s what I thought too.\u201dSeeing Chae Nayun looking relieved for some reason, I asked.\u201cWhy did you use a sword instead of a bow?\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re the one who told me to switch. How can you be so back and forth? Do you have an illness or something?\u201d\u201cI mean, you have to be flexible. It\u2019s dangerous if you use a weapon you haven\u2019t practiced much with in real combat.\u201dIf Chae Nayun was gravely hurt, half of the responsibility would have been mine. After all, I was the one who made her switch to a sword.\u201cI\u2019m not so weak that you have to worry about me.\u201dChae Nayun spoke with a sidelong scowl. I nodded without arguing with her.\u201cSo, how did using a sword feel like?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything spe\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still scared, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026What? W-What are you talking about? Why would I be scared?\u201d\u2026She really wasn\u2019t good at hiding her feelings. I looked into her eyes, then grinned. When she lied, her eyes shook like they were having miniature earthquakes. This was one of the unique settings I gave her, and it had remained the same in this world.\u201cYou\u2019ll get better if you keep at it. You\u2019re a born swordsman.\u201d**The exams were completely over.While other cadets spent their weekend enjoying the feeling of liberation, Rachel used the time to contemplate on life. The mystical experience she had on the island had given her much to think about.Because it didn\u2019t seem like a problem she could solve on her own, she even called the English Royal Court\u2019s Department of Analysis.\u2014A tree elemental?\u201cYes, I saw something in the pollen. No, I felt it. I think it may have been the power of an elemental. What do you think, Raymond-ssi?\u201dOf course, it might have just been a hallucination. However, the memory from that day was too vivid and distinct. Not only did she remember the child\u2019s face and voice, the warmth she felt when the child embraced her remained in her heart.\u2014Mm\u2026 that might be possible, but there\u2019s no way to be sure. The power of elementals is something that still remains a mystery. In the first place, we aren\u2019t sure if what Princess saw was an elemental or a fairy.Rachel nodded, then asked the analyst with a tinge of nervousness.\u201cThen, do you think an elemental could show the future? Even if it\u2019s not the future itself, something like a portion of a future\u2026.\u201d\u2014Ah, something similar has been reported to the academia. It caused quite a stir.At that moment, Rachel felt her heart drop.\u201c\u2026Really? What was it?\u201d\u2014Mm, it was a plant type elemental as well. Someone became covered in mushroom spores, then said he saw a portion of his future.\u201cHuk!\u201dRachel let out a short scream. The analyst laughed briefly.\u2014Judging by that reaction, Princess must have seen something too.\u201cYes, I saw a child.\u201d\u2014\u2026.For a moment, silence descended. The analyst stayed speechless for three whole minutes.\u2014\u2026Child?Then, the analyst barely managed to eek out a word.\u201cYes.\u201d\u2014Mm~ well, it could have been any child\u2026\u201cShe called me Mommy.\u201d\u2014Yes?This time, the analyst let out a short scream.Rachel\u2019s cheeks flushed red as though she was embarrassed.\u201cAnd\u2026 she looked just like me. She looked just like when I was young.\u201d\u2014Uh\u2026.\u201cRaymond-ssi, don\u2019t you think that I saw my future?\u201dWith that, Rachel smiled bashfully.It was a precious experience. Rachel engraved the child\u2019s warmth and smile in her head. She felt like she could smile every time she thought of her.If what she saw was, in fact, her future, if she would someday come to have that child\u2026 she felt like she could finally stop rejecting her life.At that moment, she realized that the analyst was quiet.\u201cUm, Raymond-ssi?\u201d\u2014Ah, sorry. The chances of it being Princess\u2019 future is\u2026 very small, but\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t ima\u2026 imagine it\u2026. Did you perhaps see the father as well?As the analyst asked, his fists were shaking. A child to a 17-year-old princess. As a loyal servant of the English Royal Court, that was something he could not accept\u2026.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see anyone like that.\u201dRachel smiled bashfully, then dodged the analyst\u2019s gaze.\u201cBut if I really saw my future, I\u2019m sure he is somewhere.\u201d**\u201cDaddy!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dA child about a meter shorter than me shouted with her arms open.For now, I held her in my embrace. To be completely honest, she was incredibly cute, but I knew I couldn\u2019t spoil her. I had to be a good parent.\u201c\u2026Evandel, you can\u2019t call me Daddy, okay?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dEvandel tilted her head and asked.\u201cMmm\u2026 because people will misunderstand. You should call me Uncle.\u201d\u201cEeeh? Why?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dBut I didn\u2019t know how to go about raising her. I had no experience raising a child. I was only thankful that next week was a break.\u201cMm\u2026 why don\u2019t we watch some TV? You know what a TV is, right? You saw it before when you were young.\u201dBy young, I meant when she was a seed. Back then, I left the TV on when I went out, just in case the seed got bored.\u201cUn! I like TV!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dI turned on the TV and went to an animation channel, which showed a penguin with glasses and a green dinosaur.\u201cWoaaaa\u2026.\u201dEvandel quickly turned her attention to the TV, her eyes sparkling, and I sat down in front of the kitchen table alone.\u201c\u2026What do I do with this?\u201dI stared at the Butterfly Seedling Dust, glowing brightly on the kitchen table. I managed to take it, but I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it.[Butterfly Seedling Dust]\u2014Attaches to a target with magic power and helps them awaken a part of their hidden potential.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIts description was simple, but upon breaking down the sentence, you could see two keywords \u2013 \u2018target\u2019 and \u2018potential\u2019.

But because of Boss\u2019 interference, neither Rachel nor Kim Suho obtained the Butterfly Seedling Dust.\u201cHm.\u201dIt seemed I needed to think more about how to deal with this dust.For now, I wrapped the dust in a cloth, then put it in my drawer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Guild (1)After finishing his evening training, Kim Suho headed to Cube\u2019s cafeteria. Although Cube had several restaurants and cafes, the cafeteria was the only place cadets could eat for free. As such, Kim Suho and other cadets from non-wealthy backgrounds frequented this place. Most likely because it was summer break, only few cadets were inside the cafeteria.Kim Suho ordered a dinner set, then headed to grab a random seat.\u201cHuh? Why are you guys here?\u201dBut on one table, he found two people he never expected to see, Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun. They were whispering to themselves and were startled when Kim Suho came up to them. Then, they dodged each other\u2019s gazes with somewhat awkward gesticulations.\u201cO-Oh, you\u2019re here.\u201dChae Nayun then spoke up.\u201cWhat were you two talking about?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dKim Suho sat down next to Chae Nayun, then Chae Nayun sniffed him.\u201cDid you come from the Fitness Center?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in sitting around, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re obsessed. Can\u2019t you take a break for a day?\u201dChae Nayun narrowed her eyes.\u201cRather than that, why are you guys here? I thought you didn\u2019t like cafeteria food.\u201dKim Suho couldn\u2019t understand what Chae Nayun was doing here. She was well known for eating her every meal at restaurants. No one would have expected to see her in the academy\u2019s cafeteria.\u201cWell\u2026 I realized during the final exam that my pickiness can become detrimental.\u201dChae Nayun was speaking in a grave tone, but Yoo Yeonha immediately added a piercing jab.\u201cYou stopped eating after three spoonfuls.\u201d\u201c\u2026I wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201dHearing Chae Nayun\u2019s excuse, Kim Suho lightly smiled as he picked up his spoon.Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun glanced at him, then met each other\u2019s eyes.In truth, Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun were talking about what one would expect from girls their age. The topic of their conversation was the person who was at the center of many emotions and mysteries, Kim Hajin.Suddenly, Yoo Yeonha had a mischievous thought. She tapped Kim Suho\u2019s shoulder.\u201cKim Suho.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cAre you close to Kim Hajin?\u201dChae Nayun reacted strongly to Yoo Yeonha\u2019s question. She furrowed her brows and glared at Yoo Yeonha. Meanwhile, Kim Suho answered.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not that close.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re probably the closest one out of all the male cadets.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAt these words, Kim Suho tilted his head. The corner of Yoo Yeonha\u2019s mouth curled up to a smile as she continued.\u201cIsn\u2019t it weird? Out of everyone in our class, only a few have talked with Kim Hajin. Be it a guy or a girl, Kim Hajin never approaches them first, and he responds coldly to anyone who approaches him, driving them away.\u201dAt this point, Chae Nayun\u2019s face contorted to a frown. Yoo Yeonha seemed to be planning on telling Kim Suho about everything they had talked about.\u201cBut there\u2019s one person Kim Hajin is noticeably interested in. Can you guess who?\u201dKim Suho stared at Yoo Yeonha for a moment, then made a thin smile.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not that dense.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dMeanwhile, Chae Nayun sighed with mixed feelings and massaged her temples. On the other hand, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face was filled with an even greater enthusiasm.\u201cWho is it?\u201dRather than answering, Kim Suho looked at Chae Nayun. Chae Nayun also looked back at Kim Suho. Their eyes met, and that was enough of an answer.\u201c\u2026Agh.\u201dChae Nayun clenched her head and leaned against the back of her chair. Then, as though she found a counterargument, she faced Yoo Yeonha with sparkling eyes.\u201cWait, Yoo Yeonha, wasn\u2019t Kim Hajin close to you at first?\u201dHowever, Yoo Yeonha cut down her counterargument instantly.\u201cHe approached me because he wanted something from me.\u201dJust like Chae Nayun said, Kim Hajin had approached her first. However, his interest disappeared completely once he received the Desert Eagle. Of course, Yoo Yeonha wasn\u2019t disappointed or sad. In fact, it was a clear exchange that Yoo Yeonha preferred.After striking down Chae Nayun\u2019s argument, Yoo Yeonha quickly asked again.\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201dChae Nayun didn\u2019t answer. She was concerned about Kim Suho who was sitting next to her.Chae Nayun then glanced at Kim Suho. To provoke jealousy, Chae Nayun asked.\u201c\u2026Hey, what do you think?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201dKim Suho\u2019s reply was completely innocent.\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019ve been single your entire life.\u201d\u201c\u2026So have you.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ll have you know when I was 7\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh~ You guys are here too?\u201dAt that moment, Yi Yeonghan appeared out of nowhere. He sat down next to Yoo Yeonha, and Yoo Yeonha scooted to the side with clear displeasure.\u201cYi Yeonghan, you didn\u2019t leave yet?\u201d\u201cYeah, and it looks like I came just in time for the interesting part.\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve left.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you being too mean?\u201dAt that moment, the cafeteria door opened once again. Speaking of the devil, the person who walked in was\u2026 Kim Hajin. He seemed to have come from the Fitness Center just like Kim Suho as he pushed up his wet hair and pulled out a meal ticket.Yi Yeonghan chuckled and spoke.\u201cHe\u2019s here too. At least he\u2019s working hard, right?\u201dSeeing Yi Yeonghan talk condescendingly, Yoo Yeonha felt a deep disappointment. Yi Yeonghan clearly had no clue what he was talking about.\u201cYou should work hard yourself.\u201d\u201cHuh? I am! My end of the semester grades are higher than his.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sure, just focus on your grades for the rest of your life.\u201dAt that moment, Kim Hajin received his food in a to-go box, then turned around. He stared at them for a moment before turning around. Although he only looked at them for a split second, Yoo Yeonha made a big fuss.\u201cYou see that? He was looking at Nayun just now.\u201d\u201cOkay! I get it! Can you stop talking?\u201dChae Nayun yelled, half-embarrassed, half-annoyed. Yi Yeonghan then widened his eyes and cut in.\u201cWhat? Chae Nayun likes Kim Hajin?\u201d\u201cWhat, where did that come from? Screw off, Yi Yeonghan.\u201dChae Nayun reacted sensitively. One reason was that Kim Suho was sitting next to her, but another was that Yi Yeonghan was known for being a loudmouth.Knowing this, Yoo Yeonha gave Yi Yeonghan the fuel he needed.\u201cNo, we think it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d\u201cAh, really? Kim Hajin likes Chae Nayun? But didn\u2019t you guys argue and fight? Oh, is it like what happens in dramas? You know\u2026 love sprouting up while arguing and fighting\u2026. Uh, I guess the gap in your strength is too far for that. Right, rank 4 and rank 934 is too far apart.\u201dFeeling Chae Nayun\u2019s deadly killing intent, Yi Yeonghan quickly changed his tune in the middle of his speech.\u201cScrew off.\u201dAfter blurting out fiercely, Chae Nayun glanced at Kim Hajin, purely out of curiosity. But Kim Hajin just happened to be looking at them again, and their eyes met. Chae Nayun quickly averted her gaze, then scratched her face awkwardly.**\u2014\u2026The gap in your strength is too far for that. Right, rank 4 and rank 934 is too far apart.\u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201dI only listened in at the end, so I couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about. But I didn\u2019t really mind since it seemed like they didn\u2019t realize I had two people\u2019s worth of food. I no longer cared about people talking about me behind my back.I took the to-go boxes and returned to my room.As soon as I opened the door, Evandel ran up to me hastily. I quickly shut the door first.\u201cDaddy~\u201d\u201cNot Daddy, Uncle.\u201dAfter picking up Evandel and letting her sit on my arm, I placed the to-go boxes on the kitchen table.\u201cI brought food, but before we eat, let\u2019s test what we practiced.\u201d\u201cUn!\u201dI put Evandel down on the couch. Although Evandel didn\u2019t need to consume food like humans, she seemed to love the taste, so I prepared them.\u201cOkay, first, try this one.\u201dUsing my smartwatch, I projected a picture of an adorable cat.Evandel then transformed into the cat in the picture. Other than her hair being blonde, she looked just like the cat in the picture.\u201cOh~ great. Next is this, a bird.\u201dEvandel immediately transformed into a cute crow-tit. She was a bit big, being the size of about six rice-balls, but it was within an acceptable range.\u201cWell done~~\u201dI patted her tiny head. Evandel transformed back and giggled.\u201cDid I do well?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dWas it because she inherited Rachel\u2019s bloodline? She was a good listener.When I was showering Evandel with praises, my smartwatch suddenly rang.[Today at 6 P.M., guilds released their lists of cadets for Guild Experience Program. Selected cadets will be contacted via their smartwatch.]Guild Experience Program.It was exactly what it sounded like. The program lets cadets, who didn\u2019t have things to do over the break, observe Heroes working in guilds.But well, it wasn\u2019t something that concerned me.In order of rank, guilds in Korea were given the right to select three cadets from first and second-year cadets. As such, most first-year cadets had to be in the top 300 of their class to have a chance to be selected. No matter how well I did on the final exam, it wasn\u2019t enough to put me above rank 300, so there was no way I could have been chosen.But almost as to prove me wrong, my smartwatch rang once again.[Kim Hajin \u2013 Essence of the Strait][Contact us if you would like to turn down this offer.]\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dEssence of the Strait chose me? Why?\u201cAh.\u201dSoon, I figured out why. There was one girl who had a strange fantasy about me.\u201cIt\u2019s Yoo Yeonha.\u201dAs the guild leader\u2019s daughter, it made sense for her to have such authority. But wasn\u2019t this abuse of power? I hoped it wouldn\u2019t cause trouble for her position as the successor.**I stood under the blazing sun and the blue sky, enjoying the clear and warm Seoul weather. The only thing that worried me was the fact that I left Evandel at home. I told her sternly not to leave the room, but I still felt uneasy. Was this what all fathers felt?\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dI was waiting at the Gwanghwamun Plaza, and soon, Yoo Yeonha came up to me. Looking at me, she tilted her head.\u201cWow, this is unexpected.\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d reject the offer.\u201dJust like she said, I planned to reject the offer at first, but I suddenly became curious about what kind of work Heroes did. There had to be things other than what I had set.\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting on one more person, but it looks like we\u2019ll have to wait quite a while. Should we go ahead first?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care either way.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dAt the same time, a limousine stopped in front of us. It was a long, luxurious limousine that was often seen in movies.The driver then came out and opened the door for us.\u201cGet in.\u201dI got inside the limousine with Yoo Yeonha. The car seat was extremely comfortable. Just sitting in it made me drowsy.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAt Yoo Yeonha\u2019s words, the driver drove off. The limousine moved without shaking in the slightest, and before long, we arrived at Essence of the Strait\u2019s guild building.As expected of the world\u2019s second ranked guild, the building\u2019s exterior looked spectacular. Each part seemed to have been designed carefully as the building looked both beautiful and geometrically marvelous. This tall building was undoubtedly built using cutting-edge magic engineering and technology.\u201cLet\u2019s go in~\u201dYoo Yeonha led me into the building. The lobby that entered my view could only be described as vast. It almost felt like I was in a concert hall.\u201cOffices for Heroes are on the second floor and up, but there isn\u2019t much to see on the first four floors. The real thing begins on the fifth floor. The first floor has the lobby you see here, a lounge, a training room, and a sparring room. Ah, there\u2019s a sports field too.\u201dI was completely absorbed in looking around the first floor, which, according to Yoo Yeonha, had \u201cnot much too see\u201d. Marble flooring and sleek interior, and in the distance, I could see a grass lawn the size of a soccer field. It was an indoor sports field.\u201cFirst, let\u2019s go meet the Hero in charge of the program.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh, right.\u201dIt was then that I remembered I was here for the Guild Experience Program. Because of how familiar Yoo Yeonha was with everything, I almost thought she was the one in charge.Together with Yoo Yeonha, we stood in front of the elevator.\u201cAh, by the way, the person who isn\u2019t here yet isn\u2019t Chae Nayun.\u201d\u201cHuh? Uh, okay.\u201dWhat was she talking about out of the blue? I muttered thoughtlessly, but Yoo Yeonha looked at me with meaningful eyes, then snickered.Ding\u2014The elevator then arrived, and Yoo Yeonha hopped in and pressed the third-floor button.After a brief moment, the elevator arrived on the third floor. Immediately, I saw a large circle-shaped lobby and office doors spaced out along the wall.\u201cFollow me.\u201dYoo Yeonha guided me to an office labeled A-35.\u201cTo be honest, you won\u2019t be doing anything special. Today, you\u2019ll just look around the building, then starting from tomorrow, you\u2019ll get to interact with other guilds. You might also get to follow a Hero to see him exterminate monsters.\u201dWith that, Yoo Yeonha opened the door.Unlike what it looked like from the outside, the office was quite spacious. The owner of the office seemed to have a gentle character as there were flower pots under the window sill and documents were stacked nicely on the office desk.\u201cHave you heard of Park Sangho?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I think I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d\u201cSangho-ssi is a very highly ranked Hero.\u201dIn truth, I haven\u2019t just heard about him, I knew him better than Yoo Yeonha.Park Sangho. Although he was acting as Yoo Yeonha\u2019s right arm, he was devious and sly on the inside. He wasn\u2019t a Djinn but was someone who would betray Yoo Yeonha in the future. A bit harshly, at that.\u201cOh right, I saw that you did well on the final exam.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPlease, I only had 67 points.\u201d\u201cIf you wanted to stay around the average mark, you should have given away 20 or so points. Now, other guilds are starting to pay attention to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like being in the center of attention, right? That\u2019s why I\u2019m letting you know.\u201dI decided to just ignore the strange things Yoo Yeonha sometimes said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He gave off a good first impression, like an older brother next door, a completely different character than his real self.\u201cHajin-ssi, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI shook his hand.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to introduce myself to Yeonha-ssi.\u201dYoo Yeonha smiled at Park Sangho\u2019s joking words. He hung his jacket on the back of his chair, then tapped on the documents stacked on his desk.\u201cI know this is the Guild \u2018Experience\u2019 Program, but most of our work is done indoors. That\u2019s why most team leader-grade Heroes who use the A-rank offices have 4 or 5 office workers.\u201dPark Sangho continued in a soft voice.\u201cDungeon conquests and subjugation for monsters high-intermediate rank and above require thorough analysis in this office first. In other words, our work begins here, and only when everything is perfect do we set out. But, mm\u2026 let\u2019s get out of here for now. To be honest, it does get a bit boring being in here all the time.\u201dPark Sangho led us outside. Yoo Yeonha followed after him immediately, but my eyes stopped at the safe installed in his drawer. Inside should be all the condemning evidence Park Sangho gathered about Yoo Yeonha\u2019s family.\u201cHajin-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dWith Park Sangho calling me, I scurried out of the room.\u201cOh right, there are also periodic deployment orders. You know how the North Hamgyong Province belongs to monsters now.\u201dPark Sangho continued to speak as we walked.\u201cAbout 3000 Heroes take turns every month for four days to reduce the number of monsters there. That way, there won\u2019t be a monster outbreak from overpopulation. Once you become a Hero, you\u2019ll go there about twice a year.\u201dPark Sangho stopped near the end of the third-floor hall. We were standing in front of a door that said \u2018Analysis Room\u2019.\u201cThis is the place I wanted to show you first since I heard Hajin-ssi was first place in theory.\u201dPark Sangho opened the door.The analysis room looked surprisingly ordinary. In a spacious room, tables, chairs, and fancy computers were lined up.\u201cThere\u2019s a separate conference room on the other side. Huge, isn\u2019t it?\u201dPark Sangho added proudly.The analysis room had many Heroes in it. They all seemed to be hard at work.\u201cOh, Sangho-ssi, the kids are here?\u201dAt that moment, a woman who was glancing at documents looked up and noticed us.\u201cYeah. Hajin-ssi, Yeonha-ssi, this is Yi Jin-Ah. She\u2019s a high-intermediate rank Hero.\u201d\u201cHi. You said two of the three were girls\u2026 so you must be Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cThe world sure has changed. Who would have thought rank 934 could come to our guild as part of the Guild Experience Program? I wonder who was behind it.\u201dYi Jin-Ah expressed her displeasure in a roundabout way. However, the target of her displeasure wasn\u2019t me, but Yoo Yeonha. Of course, Yoo Yeonha wasn\u2019t looking at her with pleased eyes either.In reality, Yi Jin-Ah belonged in a different faction within the Essence of the Strait guild. The leader of this faction was Jung Hosuk, the guild\u2019s vice-leader. But since she would eventually switch to Yoo Yeonha\u2019s faction and become the guild\u2019s vice-leader, she could be said to be an important character to note.\u201cBut Hajin-ssi is rank 1 in theory.\u201dPark Sangho defended me.\u201cHaha, rank 1 in theory? That\u2019s amazing, so was I! But cadets don\u2019t really learn much, so don\u2019t be too overconfident.\u201dYi Jin-Ah took off her glasses as she snickered. Then, she tapped on the document she was just reading.\u201cNow then, rank 1 theory Kim Hajin-ssi, would you like to take a look at this?\u201d\u201cHey, you can\u2019t show the guild\u2019s internal data so easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that important.\u201dYi Jin-Ah got up. Just like in my setting, she was fairly tall, making me take a step back subconsciously. She seemed to be slightly taller than me.\u201cHere. It\u2019s a copy, so you can do whatever you want with it. Don\u2019t feel pressured.\u201dYi Jin-Ah handed the document she was reading. I took it for now and glanced at it. Although it was written in Korean, it was mostly filled with equations and mathematical expressions.\u201cTake a look. Though, I doubt a kid can even recognize it.\u201dI got a bit ticked off at being called a kid. Although I knew she didn\u2019t mean it in a physical sense, I wanted to argue that my height was average.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI sat down on an empty chair nearby. As I took out a pen from my cross bag, I also took out my laptop and placed it on the desk in front of me in a smooth motion.My Gift, Observation and Reading, activated.The problem on the document seemed to be estimating variables that could happen while conquering a Dungeon. But weren\u2019t ordinary office workers used for something like this?In any case, the calculation procedures and results appeared in front of my eyes. All I had to do was copy it down.I asked Yi Jin-Ah.\u201cDo you have a piece of paper?\u201d\u201c\u2026Pft, what do you need it for?\u201dYi Jin-Ah sneered without giving me any paper.\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult. Hajin-ssi. That\u2019s not on the level of an exam problem.\u201dPark Sangho gave me a paper instead.Because of Yi Jin-Ah\u2019s bitchy attitude, I was even more driven to prove her wrong.I clenched my teeth lightly as I began to write down the calculation procedures and results. While I was in the middle of it, Yoo Yeonha suddenly spoke.\u201cUm, the other cadet just arrived on the first floor.\u201d\u201cOh, really? Let\u2019s go together.\u201dYoo Yeonha left the analysis room with Park Sangho, but I stayed and continued to write everything down. In academia, it was standard procedure to write down every step of the calculation.However, when I was mostly done and only had the final step left to finish, someone snatched the paper I was writing on and flipped it over. Obviously, it was Yi Jin-Ah.\u201cListen, kid, stop wasting your time and screw off. Can\u2019t you see? The other two already left.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe gave off an uninviting impression to begin with, but now that she frowned, she even looked a bit scary. Knowing I was powerless here, I got up.\u201cI\u2019ll leave my solution here, so feel free to look over it when you have time.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even try to waste my time, tsk.\u201dYi Jin-Ah shooed me away.Just like that, I was practically kicked out of the analysis room.\u201c\u2026What a crazy bitch.\u201dI didn\u2019t finish the last step. She better not ask about it later!I went back to the elevator and came down to the first floor.There, I saw the third cadet who supposedly just arrived. The cadet was someone I was too familiar with. Right, it was Chae Nayun once again.When she saw me, she shouted with a look of surprise.\u201cW-What!? Hey, why is he here?\u201d\u201cWho knows~?\u201dYoo Yeonha smiled playfully. I also had something to say to her.\u201cYou said Chae Nayun wasn\u2019t coming.\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201dAt that moment, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s smartwatch buzzed. Her expression stiffened, making me wonder who it was.\u201cYou two can go ahead. I need to use the restroom.\u201dThen, she furtively escaped.**\u2018Private Broker Yoo Jinhyuk\u2019Under a worn-down neon sign, Yoo Jinhyuk was staring at a document in a daze. This thin document contained a summary of an incident that happened 16 years ago.\u201cHaha.\u201dSuddenly, he chuckled.He explored the past for close to a month. However, he couldn\u2019t find out much about Kim Hajin\u2019s past. There were many complicated reasons for it, but the biggest reason was that there were way too many people tangled up in his past.But as the difficulty of the matter increased, so did his interest. As a result, he buried himself in this job for a month without complaining, and he finally discovered a crucial hint.[Kwang-Oh Report][Casualty: 96][Special note \u2013 the death of a woman in her last month of pregnancy.]\u2018Kwang-Oh Evacuation Shelter Massacre\u2019.When monsters flooded the Kwang-Oh Fortress region, 87 ordinary civilians and 9 Heroes who were defending an evacuation shelter were all killed.Although the government and the Association concluded Djinns to be the perpetrator, Yoo Jinhyuk knew the hidden truth. The reason he was kicked out of the Yoo clan in the first place was because he tried to uncover the truth.Simply put, this 16-year-old tragedy wasn\u2019t the doing of Djinns.\u201c\u2026.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk knew the people behind this incident.They were all powerful figures who most people wouldn\u2019t dare to name.First was Kim Sukho, then President of South Korea.The second was Chae Joochul, the President of Daehyun conglomerate.The third was Yoo Taeho, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s grandfather and Yoo Jinhyuk\u2019s own father.Of course, from their perspective, they had only killed a few harmful bugs. To prevent anyone from ever finding out, they had employed an organization that only operated in the darkness. The three of them probably didn\u2019t even remember this incident.But if there was a survivor of this incident\u2026 if Kim Hajin\u2019s parents were victims of this massacre, and if his mother was the pregnant woman written on the report\u2026.\u201cHuu.\u201dOf course, it was still only an unverifiable theory.But Yoo Jinhyuk wondered, why did his niece want to dig up this man\u2019s past?Breathing out a deep sigh, Yoo Jinhyuk called Yoo Yeonha.She picked up almost instantly.\u201cHello?\u201d\u2014Yes, Uncle.\u201c\u2026You sound prettier now, kid.\u201d\u2014Nevermind that, what happened to what I requested?Yoo Jinhyuk casually glossed over it.\u201cOh that, I haven\u2019t been working on it. I\u2019ve been too busy.\u201d\u2014W-What? You\u2019re joking, right, Uncle?Yoo Yeonha\u2019s angry voice stung Yoo Jinhyuk\u2019s ears.Yoo Jinhyuk tried his best to maintain the lighthearted uncle character as he asked indirectly.\u201cHahaha, I mean, why are you trying to find his parents anyway?\u201d\u2014\u2026That\u2019s none of your business.\u201cWhat about him? Does he want to find his parents?\u201dThis was an extremely important question. If he didn\u2019t want to find out, if he wanted to just live his life as it was, everything would be fine.\u2014Yes, most likely.\u201c\u2026And how do you know that?\u201d\u2014Hm, what\u2019s up with all these questions?\u201cYou know how it is, information is gold! If I know how he became an orphan, I could finish faster.\u201dHis excuse seemed to be persuasive enough as Yoo Yeonha became momentarily silent. Soon, Yoo Yeonha whispered in a much quieter voice than before.\u2014You see, I think his parents got wrapped up in a crime. He has the list of wanted criminals memorized.Hearing this, Yoo Jinhyuk couldn\u2019t help but breath in a gasp of air.\u201cHe memorized the entire list?\u201d\u2014Yes. I think he reached a certain point in his own investigation.\u201c\u2026Right, you said he was smart.\u201d\u2014He\u2019s rank 1 in theory. From what I hear, he didn\u2019t get a single problem wrong in the midterm and final exams.If he was that smart, it wasn\u2019t impossible for him to have investigated the Kwang-Oh incident.But thankfully, he seemed to have taken a wrong turn.The perpetrator of that tragedy wasn\u2019t some wanted criminal.They were \u2018true nobles\u2019, who still had great influence over the entire country.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk sighed once again.He had to end this matter here.If he dug in too deep and was noticed by that old codger, he wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee his own safety.The unpleasant old codger who seemingly harbored countless snakes in his body; one of the strongest men in Korea both in name and reality who unfortunately fell short of the league of Nine Stars 50 years ago; the second-generation successor and the real owner of Daehyun \u2013 Chae Joochul the Immortal.This old man was not someone Yoo Jinhyuk could handle.\u201c\u2026Ah, I just got a call. Let\u2019s talk later!\u201dThe Yoo clan has grown, but from its founding, it was the hunting dog of the Chae clan.Chae Joochul was someone who would abandon his hunting dog without hesitation, so he wouldn\u2019t mind letting a few of that hunting dog\u2019s children die.\u2014Wait, Uncle, when will you be done with\u2026Yoo Jinhyuk hung up before Yoo Yeonha could finish.**\u201cWhy were you late, Nayun-ssi?\u201dWaiting for Yoo Yeonha to come back from the restroom, Park Sangho asked Chae Nayun.\u201cAh, well, I visited Grandfather.\u201d\u201cNayun\u2019s grandfather? So that must be\u2026 his honor Chae Joochul.\u201d\u201cYes, I haven\u2019t seen him in a while, so it took some time. Sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s only natural. So, I presume he\u2019s doing fine?\u201dPark Sangho made a fuss, which was understandable since Chae Nayun\u2019s grandfather, Chae Joochul, was one of the strongest people in the entire world.There was no Hero who didn\u2019t look up to him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh, sorry, I\u2019m done now.\u201dAt that moment, Yoo Yeonha came back from the restroom. Chae Nayun blurted out jokingly.\u201cHow does it take you so long to take a dump?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t. Anyways, Sangho-ssi, what\u2019s our next schedule?\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s voice seemed somewhat sharp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Break (1)The next task on the Guild Experience Program was deployment.A deployment referred to Heroes intercepting monsters that invaded civilian territory.However, such occurrences were rare in Seoul, so we took a Portal to Essence of the Strait\u2019s Gangwondo branch, where several deployments happened every day.\u201cPark Sangho here. I just arrived in Chuncheon[1]\u00a0If there\u2019s an incident nearby, let me know first. Ah, I have cadets with me, so anything above intermediate rank grade 4 will be difficult.\u201dPark Sangho let the branch know that we arrived, then turned towards us. With a big smile, he spoke.\u201cWhile we wait for the deployment order to come, let\u2019s eat. I know a good restaurant nearby.\u201dPark Sangho then led us to a fancy, traditional Korean restaurant.\u201cFour people, please.\u201dWe were led inside by an employee. While we were waiting for our food to come, Park Sangho glanced at me and asked.\u201cHajin-ssi, how tall are you?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019m 174.\u201dChae Nayun then cut in.\u201cSo not that different from me.\u201d\u201cWhat? I\u2019m a lot taller than you. You\u2019re 166.\u201dAccording to my setting, Chae Nayun was 166.3 exactly. The reason I needlessly attached a decimal unit was because I was 174.3. Most main characters had 0.3 attached to their heights.\u201c\u2026What.\u201dIt was something I said thoughtlessly, but Chae Nayun made a strange expression in response. She narrowed her eyes, then asked.\u201cHow do you know how tall I am?\u201dHearing that, I froze. There really was no explainable reason for me to have her height memorized, not unless I was a stalker. I only blurted out thoughtlessly because Chae Nayun poked at my pride.\u201cCa, cadet profiles are public.\u201d\u201cYeah, but still\u2026.\u201dDrrrk\u2014Then, the door opened and thankfully interrupted this awkward conversation.The server began to put down a tableful of dishes. Korean-style braised short ribs, grilled fish, steamed egg, octopus sashimi\u2026 my jaws dropped at the sight of this kingly lunch table. On the other hand, everyone else seemed used to such a sight as they looked completely indifferent.\u201cNow, let\u2019s eat.\u201dWith Park Sangho words, I picked up my chopsticks.I was focused on savoring the taste of each dish, while the other three leisurely ate as they talked to each other.\u201cDo you have a girlfriend, Sangho Hero-nim?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. What\u2019s your ideal type, Nayun-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 like tall guys, so he would have to be at least 185.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s words struck me particularly hard. I didn\u2019t think it was bad or anything since it really was no different than how guys liked beautiful women.But there was one problem\u2026.\u201cYeah, my ideal type is someone who\u2019s tall.\u201dShe kept staring at me as she said it.\u201cHe would have to be at least 15cm taller than me. Mm\u2026 yeah, 15 cm. 20cm would be too much.\u201dWhat did she want me to do about it?When I furrowed my brows, Chae Nayun stealthily looked away.In any case, while we were continuing with our meal\u2026 a voice rang out from Park Sangho\u2019s smartwatch.\u2014Deployment order for high-intermediate rank Hero, Park Sangho. The coordinate is\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dPark Sangho got up in the middle of eating. Yoo Yeonha, Chae Nayun, and I quickly followed after him.After running out of the restaurant without even paying, Park Sangho kicked off the ground and stormed forth. Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun chased after him similarly.However, I was the only one lagging behind. I was running as fast as I could, but I quickly fell behind from the rest.\u201cJesus, is this a wuxia novel? They\u2019re inhuman\u2026.\u201dThey were practically flying. I realized just how lacking my stats were.I pondered as I raced forward.It was impossible to catch up to their physical power, which they built with 10 years of hard work, in just six months.\u201cHuu\u2026 huu\u2026\u201dI continued to run without stopping to rest. Thankfully, my Thousand-Mile Eyes kept an eye on them, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about getting lost.After about three minutes, a fight broke out. Five limestone golems shot up from the middle of the street. Limestone golems were at least low-intermediate rank grade 5, meaning they posed a great threat to civilians.They were trying to break buildings with their huge arms. However, a whip flew in, restraining their arms.It was Yoo Yeonha.The golems\u2019 gazes fell on her. Enraged, they tried to cut Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Park Sangho charged in with his spear, thrusting out at a golem\u2019s core.\u201cHuk\u2026 huaa\u2026.\u201d\u2026I was still running to the scene of the fight.After running at my top speed for over 10 minutes, I finally became close enough to see them with my naked eyes. A new golem was approaching Chae Nayun.The golem was short, being about 2.2 meters tall, making it look somewhat humanlike.Chae Nayun put her bow down and pulled her sword out. She seemed to be thinking that she could take it on with her sword since it was short for a golem.However, limestone golems had a special ability that differentiated them from other golems \u2013 self-compression.The smaller they were, the studier and stronger they got.Koong\u2014!Chae Nayun\u2019s sword clashed with the limestone golem\u2019s fist, limestone dust scattering into the air.Chae Nayun fought normally. After parrying the golem\u2019s fist to the side, she aimed for the limestone golem\u2019s weak point, its ankle.However, the limestone golem responded to her attack smartly, kicking Chae Nayun with its foot, an uncommon attack for a golem to make.\u201cUk!\u201dChae Nayun was covered in a qi reinforcement, but it was a golem\u2019s attack. Chae Nayun fell back, grabbing her stomach with her hand.The limestone golem didn\u2019t give her any time to rest. It bolted towards her in a flash, then slammed its fist down on her head. Chae Nayun froze, struck by her fear of close-ranged combat and taken aback by her lack of combat experience.When the golem\u2019s fist was about to make contact with Chae Nayun\u2026 something grabbed her by the waist.It took me a moment to realize that it was\u2026 Aether.Aether coiled around her waist, then pulled her towards me. It must have read my mind, which was screaming, \u2018I need to help her\u2014\u2018.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBefore I could fully comprehend what happened, I found Chae Nayun in my embrace. I stared down at her silently.To be completely honest, I had a brain lag.Aether\u2026 did the right thing. If Chae Nayun got hit, she would have been critically injured. It was just that\u2026 Aether did things a bit awkwardly.\u2014Gulp.Chae Nayun swallowed hard.Feeling like I had to say something, I did.\u201c\u2026If you\u2019re going to freeze up in crucial moments, don\u2019t get near the enemy in the first place.\u201dTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t in any position to say something like that. After all, I chose a gun because I was scared of close ranged combat.\u201cJust fight from afar. Your sword can get longer than a spear.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s Gift was \u2018Sea of Magic Power\u2019.Her Gift made her innate mana capacity several tens of times greater than an average Hero.Of course, even though her mana capacity was large, it took a long time to completely fill it up. Even if she did, there was a limit to how much she could take out at a time.However, when a sword was used as a conductor of magic power, this limit disappeared.Although it didn\u2019t look all that impressive because of her lack of experience, this was the true reason Chae Nayun had to be a swordsman.\u201c\u2026Let, let me go.\u201dChae Nayun pushed me away. Tucking her hair behind her ear, she held up her sword once again.\u201cI was just caught off guard last time. Take a good look.\u201dChae Nayun spoke confidently.\u2026At that moment, I got the feeling that someone was looking at me. Somewhere\u2026 above.I raised my head.On top of a nearby building, I found a girl looking down at me.\u201c\u2026.\u201dOur eyes met. For some reason, I felt like I knew her. She looked just like how I imagined her to be.\u201cHuaaaap\u2014!\u201dChae Nayun charged forward with a strange shout. Startled, I turned my gaze, and by the time I looked back up, the girl was gone.I felt a bit sorry at the girl who disappeared.She was the antagonist who was supposed to be the original owner of Aether, \u2018Tomer\u2019.\u201cHey! Help me!\u201dI could hear Chae Nayun shouting.\u201c\u2026The heck.\u201dChae Nayun managed to sever one of the golem\u2019s arm and a leg but was grabbed by the golem\u2019s other hand, she was dangling down like a pi\u00f1ata.\u201cH-He, help! Ah, uwaaat!\u201dChae Nayun screamed for help, but before anyone could react, the golem flung her away like a toy he got tired of using.**\u201cKuuuu~ I\u2019m so exhausted.\u201dOn the other hand, in Essence of the Strait\u2019s analysis room, Yi Jin-Ah stretched after two hours of wrestling with her computer.Then, a colleague approached her and spoke.\u201cHard, right? You should really just make the office clerks work on that.\u201dYi Jin-Ah was currently working on analyzing a Dungeon\u2019s mana density based on the Dungeon\u2019s formation and inhabiting monsters. She needed to find the spots where the mana density would suddenly change, as well as the possible location of traps.It was a tiring work that required a full week\u2019s worth of time even with a team of office clerks.\u201cI just need to estimate one last variable. Plus, I\u2019m smarter than them.\u201dHeroes were superior to ordinary people in every aspect. Yi Jin-Ah believed it was because Heroes inherited superior genes. She was also a highly-regarded Hero when it came to analysis.\u201cYou said it was a large-scale Dungeon, right?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re doing that alone? You\u2019re really something\u2026.\u201dThe colleague made a meaningful nod, then turned back. Then, he spotted a piece of paper on her desk.\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201dYi Jin-Ah glanced at the paper.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it yours? Ah, but you don\u2019t usually do calculations with a pen.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201dBecause her colleague was scanning the paper with eyes full of curiosity, Yi Jin-Ah quickly snatched it out of his hands. On a standard printer paper, several calculations and sentences explaining the procedure were written down.\u201cOh, he wrote this.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cSome kid who\u2019s apparently rank 1 in theory. Ha, looks like he managed to write something down.\u201d\u201cYou should take a closer look at it. It looked pretty good.\u201d\u201cOh please.\u201dShe snorted as she began to read the paper closely.It wasn\u2019t out of curiosity, but purely to feel a sense of superiority. In her mind, there was a countless number of cadets who thought they were special with only mediocre knowledge.However, Yi Jin-Ah\u2019s face stiffened as she continued down the paper.Calculations were clean and concise, and every deduction he made was flawless and persuasive. But what caught her attention the most was his creative method of approaching the problem.\u201c\u2026The hell.\u201dBy the time she reached the end, she could only say those two words.It was because the final conclusion and the critical step to reaching that conclusion were missing. It was an unpleasant feeling, kind of like being interrupted in the middle of singing the highlight of a song.\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest?\u201dYi Jin-Ah flipped the paper over, even while knowing that nothing was there.\u201cLet me see that too.\u201dHer colleague reached to grab the paper.\u201cGo away.\u201dTak.Yi Jin-Ah shoved his hand away, then carefully put the paper in her pocket.\u201cHey, you said it wasn\u2019t yours. I found it, so it\u2019s mine.\u201d\u201cPlease, I requested\u00a0him to do this for me.\u201d**\u201cAh, I\u2019m so exhausted.\u201dI came back to the dorm around 9 P.M.Evandel was sleeping on the couch, seemingly having gotten tired from watching TV. I picked her up and put her on my bed. After putting the blanket over her, I came back out.\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dI thought about showering and sleeping early, but then I remembered something important. I headed to the kitchen, then took out the Butterfly Seedling Dust from the drawer.It was still glowing with a brilliant, blue light.There was a lot more than I thought. There seemed to be enough for three usages\u2026.\u201cIt really might be okay for me to use some\u2026.\u201dI tried dividing it up into three clumps.Just as I expected, each clump had enough to fulfill its role.Then to strike the iron while it\u2019s hot, I should just use it now.I already thought of what to use it on.It was a waste to use it on myself. My laptop could view my status, and I had no hidden potential.What I had in mind was an item, Aether.I condensed Aether into a ball a bit smaller than a soccer ball, then placed it on the table. Next, I grabbed a clump of the Butterfly Seedling Dust.All I had to do was sprinkle Aether with it.With anticipation, I dropped the dust on Aether.Just like snow, the blue light fell on the ball, melting into it. Soon, the dust began to shine in Aether\u2019s transparent core.Now, I just had to wait until the light fully spread.Ding\u2014At that moment, my smartwatch rang.[Hey, thank you for today. By the way\u2026]The sender was Chae Nayun. I stared at her message, waiting for her to finish her sentence.Ten minutes passed by. Chae Nayun still didn\u2019t say anything. Tired of waiting, I messaged her first.[What.]Chae Nayun replied instantly.[What.]I also replied instantly.[What.]She said the same thing.[What.]\u201c\u2026Ehew.\u201d[Just go to sleep.][\u314b\u314b\u314b No you \u314b\u314b\u314b]The conversation ended just like that.Looking at this string of messages, I suddenly felt somewhat moved.After starting out as an extra with no connection to the main story, I managed to come this far. If I had to describe myself now, I was undoubtedly one of the supporting characters. A supporting character with no defined role, one that could change at any moment\u2026\u2014DingWhile I was feeling a bit sentimental, I received another message.[Next Friday, there will be a shareholder meeting for Packhorse Master.]\u201c\u2026Looks like they\u2019re going to announce their next move.\u201dWith Packhorse Master conquering Suwon Royal Devil\u2019s Nest, it wouldn\u2019t be long until I was swimming in money.\u2014DingI received another message from an unknown number.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with today? I\u2019m suddenly getting flooded with messages.\u201dThis time, I furrowed my brows the moment I saw the message. It was from a certain rude individual.[Um, Hajin cadet-nim? This is Yi Jin-Ah, you saw me during the day. Can we talk?]Would you if you were me?That\u2019s what I wanted to write back, but she immediately called me. I didn\u2019t pick up. Then, I immediately received another message.[Ah, right, you\u2019re coming to the guild tomorrow anyways. Let\u2019s talk then.]No, a day was enough to see how a guild operated. I had things to do, like looking after Evandel and preparing for the next arc in the story.I pulled out Park Sangho\u2019s business card, which I got from him earlier in the day, and messaged him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Sangho Hero-nim, I\u2019ll be quitting the Guild Experience Program.][Huh? Why?]Park Sangho sent an immediate reply.I was about to tell him it was for a personal problem, but I got a better idea and changed my mind. I could be petty if I wanted.[Someone told me to quit, telling me that I\u2019m only a rank 934 and didn\u2019t belong. I thought I should give the opportunity to another cadet if I was only going to be berated during my time there\u2026 sorry.]1.

Break (2)Late night.Yoo Yeonha was sitting in front of her computer, completely focused on finishing her work. She had organized the Guild Experience Program matter from earlier in the day, and she also had to upload a job post on Violet Banquet. Now, she was working on something she had prepared for a long time.[Information Guild \u2018Falling Blossom\u2019 \u2013 Now Hiring][A new information guild, Falling Blossom, is looking for elite agents.]The founding of an information guild.Of course, Essence of the Strait had its own information team, but that wasn\u2019t enough. Yoo Yeonha wanted independent \u2018shadows\u2019, who only dealt with information.As such, she worked to establish an information guild for the past year, and now she reached a point where she only needed to find members.\u201c\u2026Rather than waiting for that lazy bum, I\u2019ll look into it myself.\u201dYoo Jinhyuk suddenly popped up in her mind, and Yoo Yeonha growled.Meow\u2014At that moment, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s smartwatch meowed, a ringtone she had personally set.The sender was Chae Nayun. Yoo Yeonha immediately checked the content.[Hey, did you see the footage from our fight with the limestone golems?]As expected of Chae Nayun, she asked something that seemed completely random.[Yeah, why?]When Yoo Yeonha sent her reply, she was immediately bombarded with messages.[Well, you see][Um][How do I say this][Today\u2026]Yoo Yeonha sighed. She had an idea of what Chae Nayun wanted to say.[Are you talking about Kim Hajin saving you? It got recorded beautifully. You were practically in his embrace.][What\u2026. Why are you looking at that?][Because I have to write a report.]Nowadays, drones were deployed faster than Heroes. When a report came in, drones would be sent out from the nearest drone hangar to verify the report. Heroes could only be moved afterward.As such, the scene of Kim Hajin using his magic power to pull Chae Nayun into his embrace was recorded in high definition.[Argh, don\u2019t you dare spread it.][I won\u2019t, hehe. So? Did you like it?][As if. Anyways, I\u2019m going to a seminar next Tuesday with Kim Suho. Do you wanna come too?]Chae Nayun quickly changed the subject. Yoo Yeonha retorted shortly.[No.][Shin Jonghak\u2019s coming too.][Fine, I\u2019ll go.]At that moment, a lion\u2019s roar rang out from her smartwatch.This time, it was a phone call.The caller was Park Sangho.Yoo Yeonha picked up the phone thoughtlessly.\u201cYes, Park Sangho Hero-nim.\u201d\u2014Um, Yeonha-ssi.Park Sangho spoke in a hurry. As she listened to his explanation, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face contorted to a frown.\u2014Um, it looks like Jin-Ah messaged Hajin-ssi on her own. Jin-Ah is saying she didn\u2019t mean it that way, but Hajin-ssi is saying he\u2019s quitting the Guild Experience Program because of it\u2026.\u201cWhat? Okay, I\u2019m hanging up for now.\u201dYoo Yeonha bit down on her lips. She was fuming.\u2018That damned woman must have finally gone mad. We should be sweet talking him to get him to join us, but this is what she does?\u2019Yoo Yeonha felt enraged for the first time in a long time. Yi Jin-Ah would always criticize her for every little thing, but Yoo Yeonha endured it because Yi Jin-Ah was a competent person. Knowing that Yi Jin-Ah would eventually come under her leadership, Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t act hostile on purpose.But what she did today was absolutely unforgivable.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to resort to this\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha took a deep breath.She needed to prepare her heart to maximize the effectiveness of this method. Just thinking about it made her face redden, but now was the time to put on a thick skin.Huuuu\u2014After taking three more breaths, Yoo Yeonha made a call.The receiver picked up almost instantly.Yoo Yeonha twisted her tongue as much as she could.\u201c\u2026Un, Daddy~ You still weren\u2019t sleeping~?\u201d**The next morning, the office of the Essence of the Strait\u2019s vice-leader.Yi Jin-Ah stood with her back straight in front of the vice-leader, Jung Chulsoo. Looking wronged and upset, she gave an explanation of what happened the day before.\u201cWell, no, you see, vice-leader-nim, I did message him after he left, but\u2026\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s true that you messaged him privately. How did you even get his number?\u201d\u201cWell, I have a friend who works in Cube as a vice-instructor\u2026.\u201dThe vice-leader let out a sigh.\u201cWhat a mess.\u201d\u201cNo, vice-leader, I swear I didn\u2019t mean to threaten him in any way.\u201dYi Jin-Ah was about to explode from frustration.\u201cI didn\u2019t explain in detail, so I understand how he might have misunderstood, but\u2026\u201d\u2014Um, Hajin cadet-nim? This is Yi Jin-Ah, you saw me during the day. Can we talk?\u2014Ah, right, you\u2019re coming to the guild tomorrow anyways. Let\u2019s talk then.Thinking back to her message, Yi Jin-Ah really didn\u2019t know what to do. It seemed that the cadet misunderstood her intention.\u201cThen why were you trying to talk to him privately?\u201dYi Jin-Ah muttered hesitantly.\u201c\u2026It was to talk about a scholarship.\u201d\u201cShut it. The guild leader is going to have a private meeting with you.\u201dAt that moment, Yi Jin-Ah\u2019s expression broke down.A private meeting with the guild leader.An outsider could think that it was a better punishment than being demoted or getting a reduced salary. Although it didn\u2019t even come close to the serious punishments, in Essence of the Strait, there was no other non-serious punishment more fearsome than a private meeting with the guild leader.Yi Jin-Ah swallowed hard.\u201cS-Spare me just this once.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to, but I have no choice. It\u2019s an order from the guild leader.\u201d\u201cNo, please\u2026.\u201dYi Jin-Ah really was desperate. She was only 25, and the last thing she wanted to do was to meet with the guild leader, which supposedly made one age by five years.\u201cIt\u2019s already decided. Go back.\u201dHowever, the vice-leader was resolute.In the end, Yi Jin-Ah made her final ditch effort.\u201cB-But come on! That kid really isn\u2019t up to our guild\u2019s standards! He\u2019s rank 934 for god\u2019s sake! Even if he\u2019s rank 1 in theory, he wouldn\u2019t be here without his connection to Yoo Yeonha, and a mere cadet shouldn\u2019t be allowed to interfere with a guild\u2019s administration!\u201dOn the surface, everything she was saying was right. In truth, even the vice-leader had similar doubts about how a rank 934 cadet was selected to the Guild Experience Program.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dHowever, such doubts were washed clean by what Yoo Jinwoong said yesterday.He spoke.\u201cMountain Tyrant. You\u2019ve heard of that name, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, do I look like a rookie?\u201d\u201cThen you should know that the Mountain Tyrant\u2019s vital point is in our guild\u2019s database.\u201d\u201cYes, though you wouldn\u2019t tell me even if I asked.\u201dData on a high-rank monster like the Mountain Tyrant was top-secret information. Even within Essence of the Strait, there weren\u2019t more than ten people who had access to this data. Furthermore, those that knew had their mouths sealed with a magic contract.\u201cCome here.\u201dThe vice-leader gestured with his hand. Yi Jin-Ah walked up to him stiffly. The vice-leader then whispered into her ear. Immediately, Yi Jin-Ah was dumbstruck.\u201c\u2026Is that true?\u201d\u201cYeah. Kim Hajin is the one who provided that info.\u201d\u201cH-How?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019re seeing an oddball among Cube\u2019s cadets. I\u2019m sure he analyzed it himself. It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t videos of Mountain Tyrant hunts. And didn\u2019t you say so yourself? That he\u2019s rank 1 in theory.\u201dYi Jin-Ah shut her mouth. Thinking about it now, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for someone so outstanding in problem-solving to analyze a few monsters\u2019 vital points.\u201cListen, this is why I always tell you not to judge people by their ranks. Ranks can\u2019t fully encapsulate cadets\u2019 abilities.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u2018But last hiring season, you told us to reject anyone below rank 100\u2026.\u2019 Yi Jin-Ah pouted, not daring to voice her thoughts.\u201cSo just accept your punishment.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dA private meeting with the guild leader wasn\u2019t really a meeting, but a hellish, week-long training. As this \u201cmeeting\u201d was under the pretense of a training, there was no trouble with the law, and because anyone would be happy to train under an expert like Yoo Jinwoong, you couldn\u2019t complain about it either.If Yi Jin-Ah could become stronger through this training, she wouldn\u2019t be so against it. However, because the difference in skill was too big, she would only act as a sandbag for a week.\u201c\u2026uck.\u201d\u201cWhat uck?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing. I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dYi Jin-Ah bowed and turned around.\u201cI\u2019ll hope to see a new you in a week.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only doing this because I care about you. You might be scared now, but it\u2019s better than having it stay on your record.\u201dThe vice-leader then admonished her.\u201cAlso, don\u2019t even think about contacting him again.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cGood. You can go now.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dWhen Yi Jin-Ah grabbed the doorknob, vice-leader chattered for the last time.\u201cAh, before you go into training, make sure you apologize to him.\u201d**[You obtained 89SP!][Luck bonus applies! You obtained 12 additional SP!]\u201c\u2026What now?\u201dWhen I was looking at my laptop screen nervously, an alert suddenly popped up.I didn\u2019t know what happened, but I was happy to get more SP.However, I didn\u2019t have time to celebrate.\u201cHuu.\u201dI let out a deep sigh and got back my focus.Currently, I was planning on using about 1500SP to create a new Gift.It wasn\u2019t a Gift related to physical abilities or magic power.I realized from my fight with the limestone golems that no matter how much effort I put in, my physical stats would only lag behind as time went by.So rather than investing in my body, I would invest in equipment.The following was the Gift I wrote.===[Random Consolidation System][Low rank] [Spirit attribute]\u2014Scanning*Scans a designated equipment.\u2014Random Consolidation*Consolidates the \u2018concept\u2019 of the scanned equipment by 1~100%. The consolidation lasts for 24 hours, after which the consolidation percentage will be randomized once again.\u2014Growth*You can use SP to strengthen the Gift \u2018Random Consolidation System\u2019.===Random Consolidation System.It was a Gift that fully utilized my incredible luck stat.The concept of an equipment was exactly that. For example, consolidating a gun\u2019s concept would strengthen its accuracy, recoil, rpm, firepower, and stability; consolidating a vehicle would strengthen its sturdiness, speed, fuel consumption rate, maneuverability, among others.Since the boost percentage was completely random, it might seem like it\u2019s completely reliant on luck, but it just so happened that my luck stat surpassed the human threshold. Given that, this Gift was extremely efficient.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI was more nervous than when I consolidated my equipment in games.\u201cMay Lady Luck shine on me\u2026.\u201dTap.I hit [save].A message popped up on the laptop screen.[You do not have enough SP. The Gift will be modified accordingly.][An incredible luck applies! A portion of the Gift has been restored.]===[Random Consolidation System][Lowest rank] [Spirit attribute]\u2014Scanning*Scans up to five designated equipment at once.\u2014Random Consolidation*Consolidates the \u2018concept\u2019 of the scanned equipment by 1~44%. The consolidation lasts for 24 hours, after which the consolidation percentage will be randomized once again.*A scan on an equipment can be canceled, after which it will return to normal in one hour.\u2014Growth*You can use SP to strengthen the Gift \u2018Random Consolidation System\u2019.===I wasn\u2019t too happy with it, but considering this was what I got after my luck preserved some of the original effects, it only meant what I had first was too absurdly strong.I had to be content with what I got.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dI checked the message I got on my smartwatch some time ago.This was the reason I was racking my brain trying to come up with a Gift.[Traveling Club Next Friday. Destination: England.]It was an announcement from the traveling club.The next main story event was here.I picked up the magic sword I kept in my drawer.**English Royal Court.Rachel was enjoying her break in her room. Free from studying, training, and potential danger, she spent the entire day sleeping on her bed.\u201cUuun~\u201dThe morning sunlight felt pleasant after 14 hours of sleep.Each day seemed to get brighter after experiencing a portion of her future on that day.Tok tok\u2014Someone knocked on her door.\u201cCome in.\u201dThe old man who walked in was Henry, the butler of the English Royal Court, Henry. His hair had now turned grey, and Rachel was more comfortable around him than her own father.\u201cHow was your time in Cube?\u201d\u201cIt was fine.\u201dRachel replied with a smile. However, Henry knew the various fears that were suppressed in her heart.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry from now on. We made an agreement with Cube. We\u2019ll be sending a trustworthy agent to Cube.\u201dRachel was relieved to hear the news. With a gentle smile, Rachel praised the butler.\u201cAh, also, about the cadet that saved Princess\u2026.\u201dHe brought up something she had been wondering about, a request she personally made as soon as the final exam ended. Rachel\u2019s ears stood up.\u201cThe Royal Court will contact him.\u201d\u201c\u2026Good.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRachel nodded in satisfaction.Of course, the English Royal Court wasn\u2019t worth much compared to Korea. However, the English Royal Court was a competitive place to get into in its own way, and it also had fairly distinguished Heroes.Although it wasn\u2019t a particularly enticing choice for the top 100 cadets, Kim Hajin wasn\u2019t in the top 100. He was currently ranked strangely low, being at rank 934.However, his true strength wasn\u2019t on the level of rank 934. Rachel could still clearly remember what happened that day. A single bullet had blown away an assassin she had trouble dealing with.But for some reason, Kim Hajin was hiding his true strength. Rachel was happy with it since it meant there wouldn\u2019t be guilds approaching him. Even if there were, that would be illegal. However, as the English Royal Court had a special privilege that allowed them to recruit cadets before graduation, they could make recruitment offers to cadets without breaking the law.\u201cThank you, Henry-ssi.\u201d\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll leave you to rest then.\u201dThe butler went away.Rachel\u2019s room was large and silent. There weren\u2019t many fun things to do either. There were Welsh Corgis in the garden, but they seemed to hate her.As such, Rachel went back to rolling around on her bed. Then suddenly, she rubbed her belly. Her stomach was flat with well-defined abs, being nowhere big enough to carry a life. But one day\u2026 one day\u2026A shy smile bloomed on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Break (3)My summer break was a series of hellish training.Although I invested in strengthening my equipment with Random Consolidation System, that didn\u2019t mean I gave up on training my body. I formed a workout routine using posts on Hero Community, and I put the effort in to match my perseverance stat.A week went by in a breeze.My body\u2019s growth was still stunted. However, Aether had finished its awakening.===[Aether \u2013 Awakened][Mystic \u2013 Formless] [Evolving]A corporeal, but formless, weapon. Adheres to its master or his weapon, reinforcing their strength.A portion of its potential was awakened through a mystical elemental\u2019s power.\u2014Master Selection*Will not adhere to another being once a master is chosen.\u2014Physical Body Reinforcement*Increases all variable stats of its owner by 0.7 points.\u2014Weapon Reinforcement*Adheres to its master\u2019s weapon and strengthens the weapon\u2019s attack power. Aether itself can also form a weapon. (Current weapon-form Aether rank \u2013 \u2018high rank\u2019)\u2014Detail Materialization*Aether can manifest color and texture (cannot be too complex).\u2014Evolving WeaponAll of the above functions evolves with its owner. Depending on the state of Aether\u2019s awakening, other functions can develop.===To summarize, Physical Body Materialization\u2019s variable stat boost increased from 0.6 to 0.7, and it awakened a new function called \u2018Detail Materialization\u2019.I quite liked this new function.In the original story, Aether only had two colors, white or blue.As such, weapons formed with Aether were noticeable, being either entirely white or blue.But with Detail Materialization, it would be different.An ordinary knife, ordinary hammer, ordinary gun\u2026 though, it said that it couldn\u2019t be too complex, so maybe a gun wouldn\u2019t work.\u201c\u2026Would it?\u201dIt didn\u2019t hurt to try.When I thought about forming a gun, Aether squirmed around, trying to change to the shape of a gun. In the end, something went wrong and it ended up looking like a croissant.\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dNext was a knife.Aether managed to form a knife without difficulty. A 35cm long blade and a black plastic handle\u2026. I grabbed the knife to feel its texture. Just like I thought, it was no different than an ordinary knife.The keyword was \u2018ordinary\u2019.\u201cEvandel, Uncle is going to go out for a bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026Un.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring back yummy food, so don\u2019t play with that for too long. If you get sleepy, just sleep.\u201dEvandel was molding her magic power as though it was a clay dough. Her instinct as a witch was telling her to make ghosts. I was a bit glad she was playing well by herself\u2026.\u201cUn~\u201d\u201cMake cute animals with that, alright?\u201dPlease don\u2019t make humans.\u201cI know, I know.\u201dEvandel blocked her ears and shook her head. She seemed focused and didn\u2019t want me bothering her. For some reason, it felt like she was already coming to resemble Rachel.I stroked Evandel\u2019s head and left my room.Perhaps because it was a break, Cube was empty. It was only 9:00, but there were a few rooms with their lights on. I enjoyed this scenery quite a lot.I moved to a nearby forest.After walking into the middle of the forest, I stopped and held my Aether knife.Then, I murmured quietly.\u201cScan.\u201dIn an instant, the number \u201831\u2019 appeared on the knife\u2019s blade before disappearing.It didn\u2019t look any different from the outside, but Aether\u2019s output should be 31% stronger.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI stared at a boulder about 200 meters away. It was large and looked hard.\u201cHuup!\u201dI threw the knife at the boulder.Drawing a streak of light, the knife reached the boulder but didn\u2019t get stuck in it. Instead, it went through it. Unable to withstand the shock, the boulder split in half. The knife continued flying after tearing through the boulder, then flew back into my hand when I gave the thought.\u201cOho.\u201dDetail Materialization turned Aether into an ordinary-looking weapon that wasn\u2019t so ordinary in power.\u201cNot bad.\u201dWeapon artifacts scattered around the world had extraordinary outward appearance befitting their lofty status. The depth of history and time was something that couldn\u2019t be hidden.But the weapon in my hand was different. No matter how you looked at it, it was an ordinary, modern knife. Of course, although it could penetrate a boulder, it wasn\u2019t guaranteed to break through a qi reinforcement. But, an ordinary outer appearance induced carelessness, and a moment of carelessness would be enough to deal a lethal blow.**Noon.The traveling club gathered again under a blazing summer sun.The meeting place was the Seoul Portal Station. Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, and Yoo Yeonha had already arrived and were waiting for other cadets to come.\u201cGod, it\u2019s so hot. When are they coming?\u201dChae Nayun grumbled as she fanned herself with her hand. Yoo Yeonha muttered from next to her.\u201cWho told you to wear the cadet uniform?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dRather than wearing a 3 million won jacket that provided temperature control, Chae Nayun wore her cadet uniform, thinking Kim Suho would do the same.But in reality, Kim Suho wore a white shirt with black slacks. It suited him so well that she couldn\u2019t even get angry.\u201cOh look, here comes another cadet uniform.\u201dYoo Yeonha pointed to a distant place, and Chae Nayun turned her gaze. It was Kim Hajin. He was also wearing his cadet uniform, but with a black jacket on top of it.\u201c\u2026How is he not burning in that thing?\u201dHowever, unlike what Chae Nayun thought, Kim Hajin was feeling great. What he was wearing was the Cloth Armor gifted by Rachel, which had a temperature control functionality.Kim Hajin walked up to the others.\u201cHey, Hajin.\u201dKim Suho waved his hand and greeted him.\u201cYeah.\u201dKim Hajin nodded.Looking back and forth between the two of them, Chae Nayun smirked. They were just too awkward.At that moment, Oh Hanhyun yelled as he clapped.\u201cNow that Hajin-ssi is here, let\u2019s go.\u201d**After checking in our passport at the Portal Station, we arrived in London.It was my first time being here, and I found the scenery both crowded and beautiful.\u201cAs you all know, we will be going to Clancy Islet today.\u201dClancy Islet was a gathering place for the European upper class, known for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, and entertainment. In a way, it was similar to America\u2019s Las Vegas.\u201cHmm, good, very good.\u201dChae Nayun revealed her excitement as she clenched her fists.\u201cWe have free time, right?\u201d\u201cYes, until 7:00 tonight. There\u2019s a big event going on tonight, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to Clancy Islet. When I contacted them about coming to watch, they happily said yes.\u201dJust like Oh Hanhyun said, there was a big event planned for tonight. It was so big that it would draw all sorts of unwanted flies.\u2026No, they were too strong to be called flies. Perhaps it was better to call them beasts.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201dI began walking with the rest of the group.After following along the Thames River for about 10 minutes, we could see an island floating in the sky.It was about 4.2 square kilometers in size, floating at about 700 meters in the air.This was the floating island, Clancy Islet, created using the English government\u2019s \u2018buoyancy stone\u2019. This island of riches generated close to 30% of England\u2019s tourism profit.\u201cWow, it\u2019s been so long. I must have been 11 when I was last here.\u201dChae Nayun smiled feeling reminiscent. However, her face quickly darkened. It must have been because her older brother was with her the last time.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time here. Are you going to be our guide?\u201dKim Suho asked. Chae Nayun became energized again and retorted, \u201cOf course!\u201dEveryone continued to chatter, and I walked as I listened in half-heartedly.\u201cHajin, have you been here before?\u201dThen suddenly, Kim Suho asked me.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOh, then two of us are newbies.\u201d\u201cI guess we are.\u201dWhile I talked with Kim Suho, we arrived at Clancy Islet\u2019s entrance. There was a Portal build on the Thames River that led up to the island, and it was easy to see that there was stricter security around it.\u201cHere is my cadet ID and an invitation from Jamie Kim-ssi.\u201dOh Hanhyun approached one of the guards in front of the entrance and gave him his cadet ID and the invitational letter.\u201d\u201cWait here.\u201dThe guard went away to confirm the invitation letters authenticity, then came back to let us in. Of course, we had to go through a baggage check and body scanner to make sure we weren\u2019t carrying any weapons.\u201cHow strict.\u201dClancy Islet had everything to offer in regards to money: casinos, dueling arenas, auction houses, academic seminars, lectures, corporate keynotes, etc. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say Clancy Islet was the reason England was the second most powerful country in Europe.\u201cOh right, we can go to the casino, right?\u201dChae Nayun asked. She seemed to be itching to go already.\u201cYes, Cube\u2019s cadets are treated as adults here.\u201dBeing a Cube\u2019s cadet was a great status as it allowed minors to do things minors normally couldn\u2019t. Furthermore, if a problem arose because of it, the country would take responsibility.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean we could commit crimes.\u201cNice!\u201dChae Nayun clenched her fists triumphantly.However, I knew her excitement would disappear in just three hours.Chae Nayun brought 300 million won today, which was half the amount she had saved up from her allowances. She should have planned to spend 15% of it on gambling and the other 85% on shopping.But she would blow all of it in just three hours of gambling.Even as the original author, I didn\u2019t know which was more absurd, having 300 million won from allowances or losing all of it in just three hours.\u201cHuu.\u201dI tried to maintain my cool as much as possible, but I was also nervous.I was itching too. To me, casinos were gold mines. I didn\u2019t plan on going overboard and drawing unnecessary attention on myself, but I didn\u2019t plan on going home empty handed either.Before tonight\u2019s incident, I planned to make as much as I could.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dWe walked into the Portal.In the blink of an eye, the scenery changed.A giant fountain, flamboyant casino hotel, auction house, fancy restaurant, and fleeting clouds. It was a paradise on earth.\u201cCasino! Who wants to go to the casino!?\u201dChae Nayun shouted excitedly. Yoo Yeonha and Kim Suho had no choice but to go with her.I also planned on going to the casino, but I didn\u2019t follow Chae Nayun.Kim Suho asked me.\u201cHajin, where are you gonna go?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m tired, so I\u2019ll rest a bit in my hotel room and grab lunch afterward.\u201d*Although that\u2019s what I said, I headed straight to the casino after I dropped off my bag in my room.It was my first time coming to a casino, and it was even more amazing than I imagined.\u201c\u2026Ooh.\u201dIn a large area with no mirrors or clocks, the sound of spinning slot machines resounded, and various languages went back and forth.\u2018What should I do? The slot machine? Or grab one of the tables? Ah, I have to get some chips first.\u2019First, I headed to the currency exchange. I brought 10 million won in cash to exchange.\u201cCan I get your ID?\u201dThe cashier spoke in fluent Korean with a bright smile. I gave her my cadet ID. The cashier converted my money into chips without batting an eye. Staring at her, I asked casually.\u201cHow long have you been working here?\u201dThe cashier, or rather Jain who was disguised as a cashier, replied with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s been six years.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI took my chips and turned around.**\u2018Do I go for a slot machine jackpot? Or do I empty out a dealer?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, so close!\u201dWhen I was pondering between two choices, a familiar voice rang out.It was Chae Nayun.\u201cYou really lost by an inch.\u201dChae Nayun was sitting at a seven-card stud table.There were many different poker tables in this casino, but only three of them were for the seven-card stud variant. But because seven-card stud was the only poker variant she knew, she sat down at a seven-card stud table as if it was the most obvious choice.\u201cMan, I almost had it\u2026.\u201dHearing her dejected voice, a man sitting next to her consoled her.\u201cYou were close, haha.\u201dClose my ass.It was easy to spot a pushover like Chae Nayun. All four people sitting with her on that table were working together to scam her.From the distance, I could see that she lost 10 million won in her last pot. That seemed to have been too much for her as she tried to get up.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d\u201cHaha, see ya. But well, I feel bad taking money from a kid. Here, I\u2019ll give 25% of it back.\u201dThe leader of the four provoked her.Bert, the scammer.He was a tall Caucasian man, who rarely suffered a loss in my novel.\u201cWhat? It\u2019s only pocket change. I can make it back whenever I want.\u201dChae Nayun sat back down, her competitive spirit burning.Baring his sly teeth, Bert handed a stack of chips to Chae Nayun.\u201cCome on, don\u2019t be like that. Here, just take this and go. I\u2019m saying this to you, young lady.\u201d\u201cScrew that, let\u2019s go again.\u201d\u2026Just like that, Chae Nayun fell into their trap.She won the next two pots, earning 3 million won in total, then lost 8 million on the third. She earned 2 million on the fourth, then lost 20 million on the fifth and sixth.\u201cAh~ so close.\u201dOn the eight, Bert lost on purpose. Chae Nayun laughed, not knowing that he was only pretending.\u201cPlease, I was obviously going to win that one.\u201d\u201c\u2026Maybe?\u201dAlthough Bert was a scammer, he wasn\u2019t cheating at the moment. Casino cards were all specially made artifacts so that no Hero could see through it (except me, of course) or pull some sort of a trick.Bert was only reading the faint changes in Chae Nayun\u2019s expression to read her hands. Since you carried more cards in your hand in a seven-card stud, Chae Nayun simply didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201cEhew. I fold.\u201dThe rounds continued until it eventually reached the eleventh round.Chae Nayun folded with two pairs in her hand.Bert had one pair, and his teammate had a queen high.\u201cI fold too.\u201dHowever, Bert folded to provoke Chae Nayun even more. Then, he asked his teammate with a furtive smile.\u201cHey, can I see your hand? I\u2019m curious what you had.\u201d\u201cHaha, it really wasn\u2019t my pot to win\u2026.\u201dWhen his teammate showed his queen high hand, Chae Nayun\u2019s face turned red.\u201cAw, come on!\u201dNow that things had come this far, no one could stop Chae Nayun.In just two hours from now, Chae Nayun would lose all her money, then hole up in her hotel room to cry.Of course, I wasn\u2019t interested in the grievances Chae Nayun would face. However, I was interested in the scammer Bert.I slowly approached their table, then tapped on Chae Nayun\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHey, stand up. I\u2019ll play here.\u201d\u201cW-What, when did you get here?\u201dWhen I tried to drive Chae Nayun out, the scammers\u2019 faces instantly stiffened.They were quick to act.\u201cAh, I got a phone call. I\u2019ll stop here.\u201dOne member got up, pretending to pick up a call.Bert then spoke with a smile.\u201cLooks like there\u2019s an open seat for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can I join in?\u201dI sat down, pretending not to know what he was doing.Bert welcomed me with a big smile.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cHey, are you sure you have the money? The minimum betting price is 100,000 won.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, just play.\u201dThe game then resumed with the dealer giving each of us three cards.Everyone checked their hands, then picked one of their cards to reveal.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dBut not me. I left my cards exactly where the dealer placed them. I didn\u2019t turn the cards over to check what they were.\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you going to see your hand?\u201dOne of Bert\u2019s team members asked. It was a bald guy with an intimidating face.I smiled and nodded.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t flip them over, I could see what was on them.Two queens of hearts and a three of spades.\u201cYou know the rules, kid?\u201d\u201cWhat, you think I would be here if I didn\u2019t?\u201dEeny, meeny, miny, moe. Singing this song, I picked up one of the cards to reveal.It was the three of spades.Immediately, veins bulged upon the man\u2019s temples.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s your problem?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dBert quickly cut in.\u201cHaha, can\u2019t you see what he\u2019s wearing? That\u2019s Cube\u2019s cadet uniform. Let\u2019s be respectful to each other, okay?\u201dAlthough that was what he said, Bert\u2019s face was also a bit stiff. From the looks of it, even the almighty Bert must not have expected to see someone who wouldn\u2019t even look at his hand.But well, technique in gambling only went so far.Luck was king.**\u201cReporting. Six Djinns from the Evil Society, three Heroes from the Association, and some random scammer. Oh, and there\u2019s one person from the Vast Expanse. It looks like he\u2019s only here to sightsee.\u201dJain reported her findings.Djinns from the Evil Society.High rank Heroes from the Hero Association.A hunter from the Vast Expanse.And the Chameleon Troupe.With the scale of the event being so big, all sorts of people flocked to it. Jain had only reported on what she could personally confirm. There were undoubtedly many more lurking in the shadows.\u201cOh right, there\u2019s also Kim Hajin, who Boss likes.\u201dJain ended her report with Kim Hajin.\u2014\u2026Standby for now. Also, I do not like Kim Hajin.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know.\u201dJain ignored the latter part of Boss\u2019 sentence.\u201cBy the way, Kim Hajin saw my face. Do you think he noticed?\u201d\u2014He needs to concentrate his magic power around his optic nerves to see through your Gift. There\u2019s no reason he would use his magic power while looking at an ordinary person.\u201c\u2026I guess so. I didn\u2019t feel any movement of magic power either.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

White Crystal (1)Seven-card stud had a simple set of rules.At the beginning of the game, players were each dealt three cards by the dealer. Each player would then choose one of those three cards to reveal while keeping the other two hidden.Then, players would begin betting, with dealers providing each player with a new open card. When the number of cards became seven, the betting would stop.Players who were still in the round would show their hands, and the person with the best hand would win.\u201cThis bastard really won\u2019t look at his hand until the end\u2026 Look at your hand for god\u2019s sake! How can you be so confident?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll read my face if I do. I\u2019m not confident in maintaining a poker face.\u201dThe bald guy sitting next to me kept pestering me. However, I only glared at Bert. To be exact, I was glaring at the bracelet on his left wrist.An obsidian bracelet with black luster.That was an artifact Bert obtained through one of his scams. However, Bert didn\u2019t know that it was an artifact, yet.Rather than Bert\u2019s money, I wanted his bracelet.Currently, we were in our twelfth round of poker.Chae Nayun was still in the negative, while my chips had multiplied to 60 million won.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dBert was angry, understandably so. I would be angry too if a random kid suddenly barged in on my scheme and took 50 million won.However, Bert currently had the best hand. Five cards had already been dealt, so there were two cards left until we would show our hands. If Bert got an ace, he would complete an ace-high full house.\u201cNext hand.\u201dThe dealer dealt the sixth round of cards.Bert got an ace of hearts.He had completed his ace-high full house.The chances of getting an ace-high full house were 0.144%. It was a hand that normally didn\u2019t lose as the only hands that won against it were four of a kind, straight flush, or royal flush. The chances of getting a four of a kind when someone else had a full house was even lower than winning a lottery.However, there wasn\u2019t even a single movement in Bert\u2019s facial muscles. Since I couldn\u2019t tell even with my heightened perception, it was safe to say he had a perfect poker face.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dBut I was fine.My luck led the situation to my advantage. If I had a four of a kind and my opponent had no hand, I would be unlucky as my opponent would just fold.The opponent having a full house was the perfect trap.That said, my four of a kind was still incomplete.In my hands were the deuce of diamonds, deuce of hearts, and deuce of clubs. I was still missing the deuce of spades.However, I trusted my luck.\u201cCall\u201dBert made his bet, maintaining his calm.\u201cI raise!\u201dThe bald man increased the pot size with a terrible hand. I wasn\u2019t sure what happened, but he must have received Bert\u2019s sign somehow.\u201cCall.\u201dChae Nayun also called carefully.\u2026She really was terrible at this game.In any case, I also called just like Bert wanted. In this seven-card stud table, the maximum betting limit was 500 million won. Although I made quite a bit, I was still short stacked compared to the other more rich players on the table. With that last call, I had gone all-in.\u201cHere\u2019s the final hidden card.\u201dDeuce of Spades.My four of a kind was complete.\u201cAh, kid, you already went all-in, so you can\u2019t bet anymore, huh.\u201dJust like Bert said, I was out of money. There was still a round of betting left.Bert asked casually.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bet that ring on your finger instead?\u201dBert noticed that the ring on my finger wasn\u2019t an ordinary ring. As expected of a scammer, he had good eyesight.\u201cWhat!?\u201dHowever, the one who reacted fiercely wasn\u2019t me, but Chae Nayun.\u201cIs this guy crazy!? Hey, let\u2019s just leave!\u201d\u201c\u2026What, the game isn\u2019t even over yet. Just stay put.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll give you the money you would have lost\u2014\u201d\u201cJust sit.\u201dWhat\u2019s up with her? I grabbed Chae Nayun\u2019s wrist and made her sit.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll bet this priceless ring, so you bet that too.\u201dI pulled my ring out and placed it on the table. Then, I pointed at the obsidian bracelet on Bert\u2019s left wrist.After thinking about it for a moment, Bert took his bracelet off.\u201cDeal.\u201dThen, Chae Nayun whispered into my ear with a worried face.\u201cHey, are you really okay with that? That\u2019s your family keepsake\u2014\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t lose, so just stay still. I would have folded if I didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201dI didn\u2019t even hear what Chae Nayun was saying.\u201cNow then.\u201dThe pot size was 300 million won, but the real value of the pot was much higher with two artifacts on the line.\u201cWhat will the others bet?\u201dWhen I asked, Bert\u2019s teammates immediately folded.\u201c\u2026I also fold.\u201dWith that, Chae Nayun also fell silent.Only Bert and I were left in the pot.\u201cThen shall we show our hands?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201dBert revealed his hand, ace-high full house.\u201cFull house?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s face stiffened. For some reason, she seemed to care more about the outcome of this match than me.\u201cHaha, sorry, kid.\u201dBert grinned and moved to sweep the chips to his side. It was the stereotypical scene of someone about to lose.\u201cHold on, I haven\u2019t revealed my hand yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dJust like what victors would do in gambling movies, I grabbed the loser\u2019s wrist and stopped him from sweeping the chips away. Then, I slowly revealed my hands.Four cards, all with the number 2, showed up.\u201cFour of a kind. It\u2019s my victory.\u201dImmediately, Bert\u2019s expression darkened.Chae Nayun cusped her hands and shouted.\u201cWow! A four of a kind! H-How!?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s hair stood on ends, as did mine. Although I already knew I would win, winning brought a great sense of ecstasy.**Just as I expected, Bert made a big scene, calling me a scammer. However, Chae Nayun subdued him before the security guards could even arrive, and I grabbed all the chips along with his obsidian bracelet.===[Athenian Citizen\u2019s Obsidian Bracelet] [Magic Artifiact]A bracelet with magic seals.<magic>\u2014Shock Absorption & Automatic Recharge*When its wearer receives damage, some of it is converted into magic power and stored in the bracelet.*Slowly charges magic power when exposed to air.===</magic>Although this bracelet could store magic power, the wearer couldn\u2019t use it directly as the magic power would only linger inside the bracelet. This was the reason that Bert wouldn\u2019t realize the true worth of this bracelet until a year later. Of course, that was in the original story. Now that the bracelet was in my hands, he would never find out about its true worth.Then how could this bracelet be used?It was simple. You just had to engrave another magic seal into the bracelet.This bracelet could store up to four magic seals. For now, I planned to put seals that enhanced my physical body.\u201c\u2026What were you going to do if you lost?\u201dChae Nayun, who was walking next to me, suddenly asked.\u201cJump off a bridge.\u201dI meant it to be a joke, but Chae Nayun made a serious face.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t say that. You have to live your life to the fullest.\u201dIt was surprising to see her say something like that in such a serious tone.\u201cWhat is it all of the sudden? What, you want your money back?\u201dOf the 300 million I won, 100 million belonged to Chae Nayun.\u201cNo, you use it. You won it fair and square. I\u2019ll consider it a lesson fee. I won\u2019t gamble ever again.\u201dChae Nayun walked forward while grumbling. It seemed she planned to leave the casino.\u201cOh, by the way.\u201dThen, she suddenly came to stop and turned around to face me. After hesitating for a moment, she spoke abruptly.\u201cYou were pretty cool today.\u201dWith that, she turned back and left the casino.\u201c\u2026I guess I was.\u201dOf course, I had no plans to leave yet.Standing in the middle of the casino floor, I breathed in the heated atmosphere\u2019s air.Trrrrr\u2014The sound of a spinning roulette struck my ears.I could hear people screaming at a baccarat table.Slot machines tempted people with their addictive tune.The laughter of dealers rang out, and tables were stacked with chips and cards.Casino, where the fate of fortune was decided by luck.Here, I was king.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI clenched my fists and chose my target.First was the roulette.I walked up with heavy steps and put down 100 million won.\u201c1 to 12.\u201dSpectators gave me curious glances.Chweek\u2014 The roulette spun.Its destination \u2013 the number 12.\u201cOooh!\u201dSpectators and players cheered as my money became 130 million won. A confident smile emerged on my face.After that, I tried all sorts of games.Blackjack.Indian Poker.Baccarat.Texas Hold\u2019em.Even Go-Stop.Every time I moved to a new table, my money multiplied like a colony of bacteria.**6:10 P.M., 50 minutes before the start of the event, it was time for the traveling club\u2019s members to meet.Other than Kim Hajin, everyone was waiting at the appointed location.\u201cAh, Hajin is here.\u201dKim Suho spoke, pointing in the distance.\u201cFinally, why is he always la\u2026\u201dChae Nayun couldn\u2019t finish her sentence.Kim Hajin had changed significantly compared to a few hours ago.His shaggy hair was brushed up neatly, and he had changed out of his cadet uniform and was now wearing a brand name suit. With his luxury dress shoes making him 6 centimeters taller, he walked up, exuding confidence.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, Kim Hajin! What happened?\u201dChae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha stood in a daze with their mouths half-open, and Kim Suho asked with a surprised face. Kim Hajin grinned. His white teeth glistened under the sunlight.Dumbstruck, Chae Nayun asked.\u201cWhat, did you get your teeth whitened too?\u201d\u201cHm? Ah, something like that.\u201dIt happened at an antique shop. Using his laptop, Kim Hajin checked whether there were any useful items, and then he found a \u2018300-year-old toothbrush\u2019 which supposedly raised the charm stat by 0.01 points. The increase in charm came from having his teeth cleaned, which included teeth whitening.\u201cYour clothes\u2026 did you buy them\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dYoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun scanned him from top to bottom. Feeling confident, Kim Hajin crossed his arms and even put on sunglasses.\u2018I might look like Ryu Junyeol\u2019.[1]At that moment, a soft, silvery voice rang out.\u201cOh, who\u2019s this?\u201dThe group turned to the direction of the voice.There, we saw Kim Junwoo, a hunter of the \u2018Vast Expanse\u2019.\u201cChae Nayun?\u201dKim Junwoo looked at Chae Nayun and waved his hand. Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cAh! Why are you here, Oppa!?\u201d\u201cNothing much, just hanging out.\u201dKim Junwoo scratched his head and smiled modestly. Then, Yoo Yeonha approached him with her eyes flashing.\u201cCould you be\u2026 Kim Junwoo from the Vast Expanse?\u201d\u201cYup, that\u2019s me. It looks like my name is still worth something, haha.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dYoo Yeonha shook hands with Kim Junwoo. Then, Kim Junwoo turned towards Kim Hajin, seemingly recognizing him.\u201cAh! You\u2019re the kid who was making bank at the casino! You were Nayun\u2019s friend? Nice to meet you, man. I\u2019m jealous, I only lost money.\u201d\u201cMaking bank\u2026?\u201dChae Nayun, Yoo Yeonha, and Kim Suho tilted their heads simultaneously.\u201cYeah, I think he made around\u2026 2 billion?\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201c2 BILLION!?!?\u201d\u201d\u201dThe three of them shouted at the same time. Even to Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun, 2 billion won was a lot of money.Kim Junwoo rubbed his chin and spoke.\u201cI think so. A bunch of big guys in suits dragged him out after a while.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t drag me out. They gave me a key to the hotel\u2019s best suite and even guided me there. To take a break.\u201d\u201cOh, is that what happened?\u201dHearing Kim Hajin, Kim Junwoo nodded with a smile. Then, he glanced at Kim Suho. Chuckling like an old man, he whispered into Chae Nayun\u2019s ear.\u201cWho\u2019s he? Your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cW-What are you talking about?\u201dChae Nayun glanced at Kim Suho, then glanced at Kim Hajin.\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201dSeeing Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes, Kim Junwoo made a mischievous smile.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you\u2019re hunting two rabbits at the same time?\u201d\u201cW-What are you talking about!?\u201d\u201cPolyandry should be okay for someone like you, Na\u2014 Uk!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dChae Nayun struck Kim Junwoo\u2019s solar plexus with her elbow. Kim Junwoo held his stomach exaggeratedly and yelled surrender.\u2026Meanwhile, there was a man who was watching the rowdy scene in hiding.Evil Society\u2019s \u2018Bermund\u2019.His strength was around the middle of the pack in everyone attending today\u2019s event.\u201cFrom the looks of it, Kim Junwoo doesn\u2019t know about the details. Yes, I\u2019ll join up soon.\u201dFinishing his report, he turned back.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBut as soon as he turned around, he saw a woman enveloped in darkness. Immediately, Bermund became breathless.Long black hair, deep dark eyes. Her murky eyes seemed to be devouring him.Staring at Bermund, the woman called someone.\u201cJain.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here.\u201dAnother woman appeared beside her.At that moment, Bermund felt his death.**Same time.A limousine stopped in front of the Thames River\u2019s opening leading to Clancy Islet.Countless reporters and cameras were concentrated around the limousine, and the door of the limousine then opened.From inside, a long, beautiful white leg appeared.The woman who got out of the limousine was Rachel, wearing a silver dress.The princess and pride of England.When she appeared, the flashes of the reporters busily flickered.\u201cDo you have any thoughts on tonight\u2019s event?\u201d\u201cAccording to the rumors, you lost Cube\u2019s rank 1 theory spot. Do you have any comments on the matter?\u201dResponding with a smile, Rachel continued to walk. Although she wasn\u2019t accustomed to wearing high heels yet, her steps were more perfect and beautiful than a model\u2019s.Arriving in front of the Portal, Rachel met a businessman.\u201cThank you very much for personally visiting us today, Princess.\u201dHe was Zelen, the CEO of the multinational \u2018Roton Corporation\u2019.Today, in Clancy Islet\u2019s Clancy Hall, he would personally reveal how to effectively utilize the [White Crystal], in which tens of thousands of magic power were concentrated.Furthermore, Roton Corporation had asked the English Royal Court to attend to heighten the formality of the presentation. As Roton Corporation was the greatest sponsor of the English Royal Court guild, Rachel couldn\u2019t refuse their request.\u201cHave you increased security for the event?\u201dRachel asked Zelen.\u201cHaha, of course.\u201dThere was always the potential of Djinns or bandits interfering. Because of it, events of this scale rarely happened. However, Roton did not want to give up on the stock price increase and other astronomical profits they could make from this announcement.Of course, they made thorough preparations for potential threats. They chose \u2018Clancy Islet\u2019 as their venue, which was arguably the safest place in Europe, and hired numerous mercenaries, and even lobbied the Hero Associations to have high-rank Heroes dispatched.\u201cYou can look forward to it, Princess.\u201dZelen\u2019s eyes scanned her.Rachel did not like his lustful, snake-like eyes.\u201cAs the biggest sponsor of the Royal Court guild, Roton will promise to elevate the guild\u2019s status.\u201d**Clancy Islet\u2019s largest luxury hall, \u2018Clancy Hall\u2019.There was still thirty minutes left until the event started, but the place was filled with people. Adorned in luxurious clothes, they were all members of the upper class.However\u2026 I didn\u2019t lose out to anyone in terms of luxuriousness.300 million won suit \u2013 it was so expensive because it was a Cloth Armor \u2013 and a partial artifact jacket.It was enough to make me look like an Asian millionaire.\u201cMm.\u201dSitting alone in a cool posture, I looked around the hall.Yoo Yeonha was busy trying to build connections, and Chae Nayun went to the bathroom saying she needed to take a dump.\u201cYou\u2019re here too.\u201dAt that moment, someone\u2019s voice rang out from behind me. I turned around.The boss of the Chameleon Troupe, currently \u2018Li Xiaopeng\u2019, was there.\u201cOh, you came too, Xiaopeng-ssi.\u201d\u201cRight. As a Hero in charge of guarding\u2026 what bullshit. \u201dHowever, Boss suddenly stopped cursed in the middle of talking.I understood why.I had also heard what Jain whispered in her ear. It was thanks to my Gift, Observation and Reading.\u2014You finally met your crush, Boss. Congratulations.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cKuhum. Kuhum.\u201dA dry cough came out of my throat.\u201cAh, s-sorry. My colleague was saying something strange through my earphone\u2026.\u201dBoss made an excuse, tapping on the earphone in her ear.1. Ryu Junyeol is a famous Korean actor, who is known for being ugly as Korean male actors are generally very handsome. A funny joke that most Korean readers would understand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

White Crystal (2)6:40 P.M., Clancy Hall.Boss was still sitting next to me.Nom, nom\u2014She was busily chewing on a chocolate that she got from the waiter. She must really like it as her eyes were shining brightly.Looking at her from the corner of my eyes, I thought about how I should respond.The \u2018White Crystal\u2019 would be revealed soon.That was something that could not fall into the Djinns\u2019 hands. However, I wasn\u2019t strong enough to prevent them from carrying out their plan, and even if I was, I shouldn\u2019t interfere and draw unwanted attention on myself.Roton Corporation was one of the most corrupt corporations in my setting. Although there were no Djinns among their executives, many of them were so vile that Djinns would have been better off being in their positions.No matter how I thought about it, it was best for the Chameleon Troupe to take the crystal like in the original story.\u201cWaiter.\u201dSuddenly, Boss called the waiter. What did she want now? I focused my attention on her action.The waiter came up to her and spoke politely.\u201cYes, madam.\u201d\u201cDo you have any more of that chocolate you gave me before?\u201dBoss asked as she smacked her lips.\u201cYes, here you go.\u201d\u201cNo, not one. I think I\u2019ll be satisfied with about three.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dWhile Boss was craving chocolates, Chae Nayun and Kim Suho returned. They looked around for their seats, then tilted their heads when they saw me.They then walked up to me.\u201cHajin, who is that next to you?\u201d\u201cWho\u2026?\u201dKim Suho and Chae Nayun didn\u2019t yet know about Chameleon Troupe\u2019s Boss.\u201cAh, she\u2019s someone I know, her name is Li Xiaopeng. She\u2019s a high-intermediate rank Hero. We met coincidentally.\u201dI put my hand on Boss\u2019 shoulder, pretending to be friendly.Boss was still munching on a chocolate.\u201cNyam. Ah, mm, right. I\u2019m Li Xiaopeng.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dChae Nayun greeted her a bit awkwardly, while Kim Suho bowed respectfully.\u201cThis is Chae Nayun, and this is Kim Suho\u2014\u201d\u201cI already know. They are famous cadets.\u201dJust like Boss said, the two of them were so well known that it would be strange for anyone in this business to not know them.After finishing their introductions, Kim Suho and Chae Nayun sat down side by side.\u201cYou guys are here too~?\u201dA soft voice flowed towards us like a current of warm air.It was Kim Junwoo. He smiled, making his already small eyes smaller.His narrowed eyes landed on Boss.At the same time, Boss\u2019 eyes also landed on Kim Junwoo.They seemed to see through each other\u2019s strength at first glance.\u201c\u2026This is?\u201dPointing at Boss, Kim Junwoo\u2019s voice had gotten a bit calmer. Boss only stared at him without giving him an answer. As a result, Chae Nayun spoke up instead.\u201cThis is senior Li Xiaopeng, a high-intermediate rank Hero, and Kim Hajin\u2019s acquaintance. By the way, Li Xiaopeng-ssi, how do you know Kim Hajin? You\u2019re really pretty, so how did Kim Hajin\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, she\u2019s a beauty\u2026. Um, may I ask how old you are?\u201dKim Junwoo asked.Boss was surprisingly young, twenty four. She was only seven years older than Kim Suho, and she was younger than my real age. However, Boss had a bit of a complex about her young age.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mm, yes, well, I\u2019ll take my leave. Bye kids. Call me if anything happens.\u201d\u201cOkay, see you later, Oppa. Let\u2019s grab some food after this.\u201dKim Junwoo withdrew easily.\u201cI have to go on my guard duty, so\u2026.\u201dNot long afterward, Boss also got up and left. Then, Yoo Yeonha and Oh Hanhyun came over as if to replace her.\u201cBy the way, are other club members not coming anymore?\u201d\u201cProbably not. They\u2019ll be third years soon. The second semester of the second year is one of the busiest times for cadets. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re busy making all sorts of preparations.\u201dListening in on their conversation on one ear, I thought about the major Djinns that would participate in today\u2019s event.First was Neide. He was the crystal\u2019s carrier.The second was Silasen. He also participated in Paris\u2019 masquerade party incident. Today, he would be acting as a combatant.And finally, the team leader of Evil Society\u2019s \u2018Artifact Retrieval Team\u2019, Kim Hakpyo.Before I could finish my thoughts, the lights in the hall went out.The clamorous hall also quieted down, and soon, a complete silence descended.The curtain covering the stage was lifted.Tap, tap. The sound of boots rang out clearly.Roton\u2019s CEO, Zelen, appeared in the middle of the stage.**\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have you here tonight.\u201dWhen Rachel arrived at Clancy Hall\u2019s VIP balcony seat, a Hero guard bowed respectfully.Rachel replied with a small smile, then sat down on her seat. Hero guards then circled her surroundings thoroughly.Rachel looked down at the first floor\u2019s VIP seats, looking to see if there was anyone she knew. Because she was looking down from the top, she couldn\u2019t make clear distinctions. However, there was one particularly noticeable face.\u2018\u2026Kim Hajin?\u2019His attire was different than what he usually wore in Cube. He was wearing a full, brand-name luxury suit.Plus, the jacket-cum-coat he was wearing was definitely the \u2018partial artifact\u2019 that she gave to him as a present.Next to him was Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, and Yoo Yeonha, in that order.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it\u2019s great to have you here tonight. I am Zelen, the CEO of Roton Corporation, a leader in innovative technology.\u201dWhile Rachel was caught off guard by seeing her classmates here, Roton\u2019s CEO, Zelen, appeared on stage.Zelen recited his opening remarks, then pointed at the second-floor balcony, saying, \u2018before we begin, let me introduce to everyone the English Royal Court\u2019s jewel\u2014\u2019At that moment, a spotlight fell on Rachel\u2019s head. It was so bright that she couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Still, Rachel stood up from her seat and gave the audience a gentle smile. Applauses rang out from the VIP seats. Soon, the spotlight turned off, and Rachel sat back down.\u201cNow, everyone, what is the power that forms the origin of all things?\u201dZelen\u2019s presentation started in full. Rachel was a bit disgruntled that a presentation on English soil was being done in Korean. Though, it was being translated into English in real time as well.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it is mana! Somewhere in this world, mana naturally coalesces into natural treasures. Even among these natural treasures, White Crystals are especially precious, fully deserving of the phrase \u2018humanity\u2019s blessing.\u2019\u201dOn a big screen behind the stage, a beautiful crystal popped up.That was a White Crystal, an essence of magic power that was formed from natural accumulation and condensation of mana. It was a natural treasure that was full of nature\u2019s life energy.Just by existing, a white crystal increased the atmospheric mana density, making it a priceless treasure that couldn\u2019t be bought with money.\u201cCurrently, 480 crystals have been found. However, there has not been a way to properly utilize this precious crystal.\u201dZelen paused and made a meaningful smile.\u201cFrom now, we, the Roton Corporation, will present the true method of using the white crystal.\u201dNext, a staff dragged a strange cart to the stage. There seemed to be something on the cart, but it was covered with a cloth, hiding it from view.Without delay, Zelen lifted the cloth.A white crystal was floating inside a cubic glass tube.Seeing the beautiful, pure white crystal, the audience burst into shocked cries. However, Zelen focused on the cubic glass tube, not the white crystal.\u201cThis vacuum cube\u2026 ah, don\u2019t misunderstand it with the Korean Peninsula\u2019s Cube.\u201dThe audience laughed at the objectively stale joke.\u201cThis cube can trace its origin all the way to the Persian Empire. This cube was originally an earthenware. But we, in Roton Corporation, are a leader in the partial artifact industry, where artifacts are dismantled and reforged. We decomposed this earthenware into soil and sand, then recreated it into a glass tube using a state-of-the-art mana engineering technique.\u201dThe audience was immediately stirred.However, the stir wasn\u2019t purely from the shock of Zelen\u2019s announcement.Looking down from above, Rachel could feel the presence of irregular movements.Black figures began to appear from the pathways on the side of the VIP seats. At first, Rachel thought they were guards. However, she soon realized that their movements were strange.Rachel spoke to her Hero guards.\u201cI\u2019m fine, so keep your eyes on them.\u201dThe Hero guards seemed to be thinking the same thing as they went downstairs, only leaving the minimum number of personnel behind.It was then.A person sitting in on the first-floor seat suddenly shot up.He was particularly eye-catching. It was a man Rachel was familiar with, Kim Hajin.Rachel suddenly remembered things that happened in the past. Kim Hajin always showed up where incidents occurred.In that case, even now\u2026\u201cWait just one moment.\u201dShe left Clancy Hall, restraining the guards who tried to follow her. Before she chased after Kim Hajin, she activated the magical effect stored in her necklace, \u2018Shade\u2019. Her presence disappeared, and any noise she made was extinguished. Rachel walked like a shadow.At first, she tried to go downstairs. It was because she thought Kim Hajin would be there.But contrary to her expectations, Kim Hajin came up.\u201cHiik!\u201dAbout to run into him, she quickly hid behind a wall.Wearing a pair of sunglasses, he climbed the central staircase. His steps were unhurried and stately. Rachel fell back a bit more, then chased after him using the emergency staircase.Eventually, Rachel reached the rooftop.However, Clancy Hall\u2019s rooftop wasn\u2019t a place a guest could enter. Only engineers would come 3 to 4 times every year for repair or maintenance.As such, the door to the rooftop was firmly closed.Without a key, that door could not be opened.Click, click\u2014Kim Hajin tried to open the door, but the door did not budge. He tilted his head, then took out a hammer.It was a seemingly ordinary hammer with a steelhead and a wooden handle. It looked old and worn-down, making it all the more shabby.Without explicit permission, weapons couldn\u2019t be brought into Clancy Islet. He probably had no choice but to bring a worn-down tool like that hammer.\u201c..?\u201dSuddenly, Kim Hajin positioned himself to strike the door with the hammer. Almost as if to break the door.However, that was impossible. There was no way. That iron door was made using mana alloy. A mere hammer, especially one that looked so worn-down, couldn\u2019t possibly\u2026Kim Hajin smashed the door with the hammer.KWANG!A thunderous vibration erupted.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn the next moment, Rachel found herself at a loss for words. It was as if her brain stopped functioning.The iron door was struck by the hammer, one that was clearly on the verge of breaking. However, the iron door was completely obliterated. It was dented as though it was struck by a truck.Staring at the now widely open rooftop entrance, Rachel fell in thought.Was the hammer clad in magic power?No, that wasn\u2019t it at all.But if it wasn\u2019t magic power, what was it? Only his physical power? To break an iron door made with mana alloy?Rachel dropped on the floor and tried to comprehend the incomprehensible situation.\u2014Kyaaaak!However, a bigger disturbance and screaming rang out from below.Rachel quickly snapped out of her daze.**\u2014I have confirmed Roton\u2019s internal document. The item currently in Clancy Hall is the real one.Hearing this report, Evil Society\u2019s executive, Kim Hakpyo, grinned.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what these insects do, the result is all the same.\u201dEven Kim Hakpyo wasn\u2019t sure that Roton Corporation would bring out the real priceless crystal and ancient artifact.However, with his craze for money, Zelen had done it. He didn\u2019t want to miss the astronomical profit he could gain by presenting the real product.Of course, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea.Clancy Islet, the floating island.Entrants of the island were strictly vetted, and because the island itself was made with magic power, artificial Portals couldn\u2019t be made either.However\u2026They couldn\u2019t have imagined that Evil Society would utilize an aerial carrier.\u201cBegin.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euKim Hakpyo gave his command. Immediately, a dense black fog welled up beneath his feet. The VIPs seemed to think the situation was an event, but the blood curdling screams that rang out soon proved otherwise.Kuak!Uk!Aaak!Hearing the screams, the VIPs lost their composure and stood up.Kyaaak\u2014Sharp screams spread out like an epidemic, and the entire hall broke out into a pandemonium.Sitting in a seat, Kim Hakpyo smiled.He always welcomed confusion and chaos.Now, everything would be taken care of in this pitch black darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

White Crystal (3)The 22 elite members of Evil Society quickly went to work. They first blocked out pathways off the stage, then decimated the security. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t distinguish between security guards and ordinary civilians. Anyone who got in their way was cut down. As a result, the peaceful hall quickly turned into a scene from hell, and at the forefront of it all was Team 1\u2019s executive, Neide.He was a grade-1 wanted Djinn who was on the Association\u2019s violet list.\u201cHeroes! Over here! Here!\u201dZelen was attracting Heroes to himself in despair. Neide first shut his mouth, and let his underlings deal with the Heroes that came to help. Then, with nimble and fluid movements, he snatched the cube and the crystal inside.At that moment, a man walked up to him.\u201cWhere are you going? Let me introduce myself. I\u2019m a high-rank Hero, Jin Xiangchen.\u201dThe man introduced himself in poor Korean. Neide stared at him silently. He had no plans to waste time fighting a high-rank Hero.With a smirk, Neide\u2019s body multiplied. Eight clones of Neide appeared in a flash.\u201cWhat a troublesome ability.\u201dJin Xiangchen prepared to fight all eight bodies simultaneously, but Neide had no intention of attacking.The eight Neides ran away, splitting up in eight directions.\u201cY-You motherfucker.\u201dXiangchen pondered.Which direction should he choose?After thinking for a moment, he chose to follow the one running eastward.Meanwhile, Boss was staring at the stage through the darkness. When Neide split up and ran away, she began to walk not east but north.\u201cHmm.\u201d\u2026From the midst of darkness, a short breath came out.A man who was observing the situation slowly raised his body. Walking through the darkness, he grabbed the wrist of a Djinn who was about to cut down a man.\u201cKuak!\u201dTwisting his wrist and making him drop his weapon, the man grabbed his neck.1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds\u2026The Djinn died, bleeding from all orifices.Throwing the corpse aside, Kim Junwoo grabbed the sword the Djinn dropped. Next, he began to cut down every Djinn he came across, making his way to Chae Nayun\u2019s party.\u201cOppa!\u201dChae Nayun and her friends ran up to him. Without a word, Kim Junwoo threw a Djinn\u2019s sword over to Kim Suho. Kim Suho received it, staring at Kim Junwoo.Kim Junwoo smiled.\u201cShall we fight?\u201d**Just like in the original story, Neide split into eight bodies and escaped.Standing on the rooftop, I saw which Neide had the crystal.To the east, there was a Hero chasing after Neide, but that one didn\u2019t have the crystal.To the south, Jain, who was disguised as a Djinn, was accompanying Neide. However, that Neide didn\u2019t have the crystal either.And to the north, the one Boss was chasing after should have the crystal according to the original story.I closely watched the north side.\u2014Stop!Twelve Djinns got in front of Boss.Boss immediately unleashed her magic power, a tiny black ball of magic power that looked ordinary from the outside. However, the twelve Djinns were sucked into that tiny ball effortlessly. Then, they were twisted and distorted to the point of being unrecognizable.Void Sphere.It was a destructive ability that was only a tiny portion of Boss\u2019 Gift.After lightly shaking off the blockade, Boss chased after Neide. From now, she would easily steal the crystal from Neide\u2019s hands.I stared at Neide, who was still running away.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAt that moment, my head shook.This Neide didn\u2019t have the crystal either. Again, the Neide in the north didn\u2019t have the crystal.\u201cHow\u2026.\u201dI quickly turned on my laptop. However, there were no alerts. If it wasn\u2019t because of a settings change, then what changed the situation?I broke out into cold sweat. My head felt numb, and my heart began to beat wildly.I hurriedly looked around the hall, but I couldn\u2019t find the crystal with so many people running around.\u201c\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, an idea popped up in my head.Although I had never tried it, there was no time to waste.I concentrated Stigma\u2019s magic power on my retina.No, to be exact, I concentrated it around my Gift, \u2018Master Sharpshooter \u2013 Thousand-Mile Eyes\u2019.Stigma\u2019s magic power moved and exerted itself according to my will. In that case, it should be possible to strengthen the Thousand-Mile Eyes for a moment\u2026.In an instant, the scope of my vision transformed.Just like how satellites looked down on the earth, a wide range entered my sight.Civilians hurriedly escaping the hall, Heroes fighting against Djinns, strange monster-like one-dimensional shapes summoned by Djinns to incite chaos, and\u2026 the white crystal I needed to find.As the essence of magic power, the white crystal was easy to spot. The crystal was inside a fast-moving sedan. Inside the sedan was only one person.Thwak\u2014However, with the sound of blood vessels being cut, my vision narrowed once again.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI grabbed my eyes and knelt. I was struck with a pain so intense that I couldn\u2019t even scream. However, I didn\u2019t even have time to writhe in pain.I took out the Desert Eagle. I planned to snipe the sedan. However, it seemed my Thousand-Mile Eyes were overloaded as I couldn\u2019t aim properly.Without a choice, I jumped down from the rooftop. It was thanks to Parkour\u2019s power.As soon as I landed on the ground, I looked for something to ride. My luck seemed to have helped me again as there was a motorbike parked nearby.It was a black bike that looked expensive even at a glance.I had experience driving a motorcycle since I often did delivery as a part-time job before going to the army.\u201cEverybody, stay calm as you evacuate!\u201dAt that moment, I heard a familiar voice. It was Chae Nayun. Without a weapon, she was holding onto magic power condensed in the shape of a stick. Feeling somewhat bad, I shouted at Chae Nayun.\u201cHey!\u201d\u201cUh, what, Kim Hajin!? Where have you\u2026\u201dI took out the magic sword I kept in my Stigma and threw it at her.\u201cBe careful not to get hurt.\u201dThen, I ran to the place where the bike was parked.I didn\u2019t need the key. As all car keys in this world were digital, I just had to hack into the bike with my laptop.Sitting on the saddle, I muttered in a low voice.\u201cScan.\u201dThe result was\u2026 40%.A jackpot. The number 40 was engraved on the body of the black bike.Like so, Random Consolidation System also worked on vehicles.\u201cHey, where are you going!?\u201dChae Nayun hurriedly asked. I started the engine without answering her.Vroooaaang\u2014! The engine\u2019s beast-like roar rang out.\u201cWhoa!\u201dThe bike charged forward the moment I stepped on the accelerator. Its sheer speed was something I wouldn\u2019t dare to wield.Covering my insufficient driving skill as much as possible with my acute dynamic vision, I stormed down the road.The direction was southeast. Pushing the air to the side, the bike rushed through like a streak of light.Three minutes was enough to reach the goal.At the end of the supersonic charge, I began to see the back of the sedan.What I planned to do from now could only be described as daring.I put Aether around the bike and pushed on the accelerator even harder.The speed shot up endlessly. Piercing wind struck my body, and the air pressure prevented me from breathing.Even so, I never let go of the gas.\u2026The bike rammed into the back of the sedan.KWANG\u2014!The bike and sedan collided.In most instances, the motorcycle would have been blown away. However, it was different this time.The force of the collision caused the back of the sedan to shoot up. Overturned like a tin can, the sedan barreled through the air and slammed into the trunk of a tree.\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201dI stopped the bike and let out a breath I had been holding onto this entire time.**\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun stared blankly at what just happened. Her eyes and ears were solely focused on one spot. The bike that ran out into the road had already become a tiny dot.To be completely honest, she just saw a scene of her dreams.A lightspeed bike, and driving it masterfully in a cool manner\u2026\u201cKyaaak!\u201dHowever, a desperate shriek dragged her back to reality.\u201cWhat?\u201dChae Nayun stared at the magic sword she received while she was in a daze.\u2018Where did he get something this expensive? He said he won 2 billion won, so did he buy it with that? To give it to me? No, that can\u2019t be\u2026.\u2019Regardless, it was undoubtedly helpful. With a grin, she imbued her magic power into the sword.Wiing\u2014A clean, sharp blade of magic power rose up.\u201c\u2026Huup.\u201dChae Nayun continued to imbue magic power into the sword. The blade continued to get longer until the blade eventually reached 4 meters in length. The blade burned clearly without a single blemish, showing the world the power of her true Gift.\u201cSomeone save me!\u201dAt that moment, someone\u2019s scream struck her ears.Chae Nayun shouted with the sword in her hand.\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d**I approached the overturned sedan. The magic power that flowed out of Stigma gathered in my hand and formed the Desert Eagle.Drkk\u2014The sedan\u2019s driver seat door opened, and a Djinn crawled out. He was holding a suitcase in hand.\u201cCrazy bastard\u2026\u201dThe Djinn cursed as he glared at me.\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201dWhere did his confidence come from? When I pondered, I saw a flashing object in the distance. It was an aerial carrier with a stealth function. The Djinn\u2019s face brightened.However, I took out my laptop extremely casually.\u201cO-Over here! Brothers! Over here!\u201dThe Djinn even shot a flare gun to announce his position.I didn\u2019t stop him. No, I didn\u2019t need to. Instead, I used the laptop to connect to a [peripheral server].\u2018A0936-B Carrier\u2019.I needed 100 SP to access it. I felt a bit regretful, but it was still worth paying.Tak.I closed the laptop.Suddenly, the carrier began to move backward.\u201cA-Ah, w-where are you going!? Over here, I said!! HEY! WHERE ARE YOU FUCKING GOING!? I mean, where are you going, sirs? Guys??\u201dThe moment the Djinn was coughing up blood and going insane\u2026A terrifying wind pressure blew, and something huge fell down on the ground.KOONG!Shock waves shook the area at the moment of landing. A rock accompanied the shockwave, striking his head and crushing it.I stared at what landed.\u201c\u2026.\u201dA giant over 2.2 meters. This man, who gave off an overwhelming presence just by standing, was a man who could be said to be the strongest in close ranged combat \u2013 Cheok Jungyeong.However, a girl was caught in his hand like a pet.\u201cL-Let go! Let me go!\u201dRachel struggled as much as she could, but Cheok Jungyeong didn\u2019t even flinch.\u201cLet me go! This is England\u2019s territory, and I am England\u2019s princess\u2026.\u201dWhen I stared at her, Cheok Jungyeong spoke with a smirk.\u201cOh, this girl? It looked like she was following you, so I brought her.\u201dRachel met my eyes. She clenched her teeth. Leaving Rachel alone for a moment, I picked up the now ownerless suitcase.Cheok Jungyeong then spoke softly.\u201cPut that down.\u201dI retorted briefly.\u201cYou first.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dCheok Jungyeong didn\u2019t respond. He only stared at me with the eyes of a dead fish.Without a choice, I pointed my gun at the suitcase. Immediately, Cheok Jungyeong\u2019s expression changed.\u201cEh? Hey, hey, do you know how much that\u2019s worth?\u201dWithout answering him, I transformed the Desert Eagle from a handgun to a shotgun.\u201cFine, you want to try me? Let\u2019s see who\u2019s faster. Me ripping of this girl\u2019s head, or you drilling a hole through that suitcase.\u201dI put my finger on the trigger.For a moment, an intimidating confrontation continued, but soon, Cheo Jungyeong sighed as though he was giving up.\u201c\u2026Fine, little bastard.\u201dThen he threw Rachel at me.\u201cKyaa!\u201dRachel fell at my feet. I was curious why Rachel was here, but now wasn\u2019t the time to ask.Cheok Jungyeong\u2019s heavy voice knocked on my ears.\u201cNow, put that down.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn the first place, this crystal wasn\u2019t something I could handle. The ideal plan was to give it to Rachel to make it the English Royal Court\u2019s possession, but it was impossible now that Cheok Jungyeong was here.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFine.\u201dI threw the suitcase down without hesitation. Cheok Jungyeong picked up the suitcase. In his hands, it looked more like a purse.It was then.Wiiing\u2014A fly landed on my nose, distracting me for a second.But in the next moment.A fierce wind blew towards me.All the hair on my body flew backward. I couldn\u2019t think. When I looked forward, a head-sized fist was in front of me. Beyond the fist, Cheok Jungyeong made a satisfied smile.In the blink of an eye, Cheok Jungyeong had charged towards me and stretched out his fist.3 cm.Just 3 cm closer and my head would have been crushed.\u201c\u2026Looks like you aren\u2019t so rotten.\u201dCheok Jungyeong seemed satisfied at my calm(?) response as he turned back with those few words.His heavy steps resounded.My body didn\u2019t move until he completely disappeared. My head was completely blank, not a single thought existing in it.My body and conscious were frozen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Short Break (1)A huge forest was built on the outskirts of Clancy Islet. This forest served to protect the island from crashes without exterior damage to the island, so all the trees in the forest had strong and large trunks.I picked a random tree to lean against.\u201cAuu\u2026.\u201dMy heart, which stopped momentarily, trembled greatly and began to beat again.Holding my thumping chest, I recalled what just happened\u2026 then stopped. I went back to focusing on the present. For the sake of my sanity, it was better to forget about what happened.I looked around the dark forest. The overturned sedan that the Djinn rode was stuck in a ditch, and my bike was lying a little distance away.The bike was fine. It had a 40% consolidation on top of being reinforced with Aether, so there was no way it could have been destroyed.I slowly walked up and raised the bike. For some reason, I wanted to take it back with me. Was there a way I could?While I was having a slightly illegal thought, I suddenly felt someone\u2019s gaze.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel was staring at me while sitting like a mermaid. Because Cheok Jungyeong gave me such a big shock, I had forgotten about Rachel\u2019s existence for a moment.\u201c\u2026Are you okay?\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem hurt at first glance, but I still asked. Rachel nodded silently. With a dazed face and her mouth half-open, I could see the front of her teeth.I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cWhy did you follow me?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThen, Rachel closed her mouth and stared at me for a while. I didn\u2019t avoid her eyes.An exceptionally bright moonlight blanketed the dark forest of the floating island. Rachel shined silver from this light.She looked into my eyes for a long time, then pulled something out of her pocket.It was a bullet. To be exact, it was a bullet without the casing.What was that? I tilted my head.\u201cHajin-ssi.\u201dSuddenly, she called my name. I thought for a moment that my ears were acting up. However, I wasn\u2019t mistaken. Rachel had certainly called my name.\u201c\u2026Ah, yes.\u201dI replied hurriedly.\u201cThis belongs to Hajin-ssi, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI stared at the bullet. I didn\u2019t have the ability to distinguish bullets just from their shapes, but it did look like a bullet for the Desert Eagle.\u201cYes, I think so.\u201dI reached out to grab the bullet, but Rachel put the bullet back into her pocket, pretending not to have noticed.\u201cUm, where did you get\u2026\u201d\u201cI found it during the final exam.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dI finally understood the situation.She must have found it when I helped her by sniping Lancaster Djinns.\u201cI thought something similar might happen again, so I followed you.\u201dRachel scratched her cheek as she pulled out the sword hanging on her waist.I knew what that weapon was. It wasn\u2019t just a training rapier given by Cube.Galatyn.It was a legendary sword said to be used by one of the twelve Knights of the Round Table.But no matter how good the weapon was, Rachel didn\u2019t stand a chance against an overwhelming opponent like Cheok Jungyeong.\u201c\u2026Aha.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Hajin-ssi\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Rachel\u2019s voice became firm. She stared at me fixedly and asked.\u201cBack then, why did you help me?\u201dI didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just stared at her.Rachel wasn\u2019t finished yet.\u201cDuring the midterm exam and then the final exam. Thinking about it now, Hajin-ssi was there, uup!\u201dA chilly wind blew, and Rachel\u2019s long hair curled into her mouth. I barely held myself back from laughing.Rachel tied her hair back, then cleared her throat.\u201cKuhum. I can see how what happened during the midterm exam was a coincidence, but for the final exam\u2026 no matter how much I think about it, the only explanation I can come up with is that you were watching me.\u201dI scratched the back of my neck.Rachel was a pivotal character who was exposed to extreme danger. If she got hurt or was killed, the story progression would be distorted greatly. That was why I was watching her. Since only I could prevent it.However, that wasn\u2019t something I could explain to her.As such, my answer was simple. It was simple enough to be acceptable and convincing.\u201cI\u2019m your fan.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dRachel widened her eyes and tilted her head.\u201cI\u2019m your fan. I\u2019m even a member of your fan caf\u00e9.\u201dRachel\u2019s fan caf\u00e9 did exist. England\u2019s fan caf\u00e9 had about 500,000 members, and even the Korean one had about 10,000. I checked it before when I didn\u2019t have anything better to do.\u2026But it was perhaps too absurd of an excuse as Rachel shut her mouth tightly.Whiish\u2014\u00a0The wind blew, shaking the leaves of the trees around us.The awkward silence continued for about five minutes, then\u2026Rachel asked with a quivering voice.\u201cDoes that mean\u2026 you like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d**Cheok Jungyeong returned with the crystal to the hotel suite, where everyone else was waiting.\u201cUhahaha, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m back.\u201dWhen four members of the Chameleon Troupe stared at him, Cheok Jungyeong burst into laughter.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m the main character.\u201dHe pushed his hair back as though he was embarrassed, then put down the suitcase.Jain snatched up the suitcase.\u201cThis better be the real thing.\u201dShe swallowed her saliva and opened the suitcase slightly. A brilliant white light shone through the opening gap, letting her know that it was the genuine crystal.\u201c\u2026It is.\u201dA smile emerged on Jain\u2019s face. Satisfied, she closed the suitcase.\u201cWell done.\u201d\u201cHaha, it was a piece of cake.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait, why are you so happy? Don\u2019t tell me you killed him?\u201dBoss\u2019 eyes suddenly flickered coldly.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Ah, I was planning to at first.\u201dCheok Jungyeong smiled deeply.At first, he wanted to blow up his head.If his eyes trembled even a little bit, or if he tried to dodge or show any sign of fear, Cheok Jungyeong probably wouldn\u2019t have stopped his fist.However, the man continued to stare at his fist. Without being flustered, he observed Cheok Jungyeong\u2019s movements, showing the fearlessness of a warrior.Cheok Jungyeong liked his manliness.\u201cAre you sure he wasn\u2019t frozen from being scared? Did you check his pants?\u201d\u201c\u2026Jain, if you underestimate him, you might regret it one day.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dJain furrowed her brows. Cheok Jungyeong shook his large head sideways as he murmured, \u2018just kidding, just kidding.\u2019\u201cI would know if that was the case. I purposely charged in a little slowly. Also, he was facing me directly, but he didn\u2019t bat an eye.\u201dTo demonstrate, Cheok Jungyeong pushed his fist at Jain. Jain was startled even by this tiny movement.\u201cSee, strong people and people who will become strong have a different mindset.\u201dCheok Jungyeong spoke as he pounded his chest proudly.\u201cCourage, boldness, fearlessness\u2026 all of these are impossible to have without a strong heart. Closing your eyes when your sword is clashing is the same thing as having your neck cut\u2014\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u201dDroon interrupted Cheok Jungyeong\u2019s passionate speech, making him frown.\u201c\u2026Tsk. Brat, don\u2019t cut in when an adult is talking.\u201dHowever, he couldn\u2019t do anything about Droon.Although he loved fighting and killing, there was one absolute rule he never broke.\u201cTry that in three years and you\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dTo never touch young children.That was his rule.**The turmoil in Clancy Hall was quickly suppressed.Although Evil Society\u2019s executives weren\u2019t captured, there weren\u2019t too many casualties thanks to the total mobilization of England\u2019s Heroes.\u201cEhew.\u201dBroken down buildings and battered roads.While Heroes and paramedics were busy going back and forth, Yoo Yeonha was sitting on the ground, staring at her hair that had been blackened.She sighed. How much time and effort would it take to restore this hair at the beauty salon?\u2018\u2026Dammit.\u2019Yoo Yeonha kept sighing, and soon, Chae Nayun walked up to her.\u201cHey, did you see that?\u201dChae Nayun asked without any explanation. Yoo Yeonha became annoyed for a moment but pushed her complaint back into her throat.\u201cSee what?\u201dYoo Yeonha had seen many things. First was Kim Junwoo\u2019s overwhelming might. He tore countless Djinns apart with his bare hands, making him truly worthy of being a hunter of the Vast Expanse.Next was Kim Suho.His talent also stuck out like a sore thumb. There was nothing that the metal attribute covering his sword couldn\u2019t cut. His final sword dance, which cut down raining fireballs, was one that still stayed in her mind.\u201cKim Hajin. He went off on a bike.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dYoo Yeonha had also seen that eye-catching scene. Just like Chae Nayun said, Kim Hajin went off somewhere on a motorbike. He was so fast that Yoo Yeonha had to do a doubletake on whether bikes could go that fast.\u201cYeah, I saw him, but where did he go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but where do you think he got that bike? I want to buy one too.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s eyes flickered as she smacked her lips.Kim Hajin didn\u2019t make any special accomplishments in today\u2019s incident. However, Yoo Yeonha had a suspicion. Kim Hajin\u2019s driving skill. He seemed too experienced for a mere cadet.At that moment, Kim Suho hastily walked up to them.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThe princess is apparently gone. Have you guys seen Rachel?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dChae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha looked around the area. Although the incident had been settled, Heroes were beginning to get busy once again. The word \u2018Princess\u2019 didn\u2019t disappear from their urgent conversations.Yoo Yeonha suddenly felt a chill down her back.She muttered in complete shock.\u201c\u2026Their goal was the princess?\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\u201cYeah, it makes sense. Rachel is England\u2019s most precious treasure. If they kidnapped her\u2026.\u201dIt was then.A black bike was coming their way, making broken clunking noises. Everyone other than Yoo Yeonha, who was focused on making deductions, turned to the direction of the bike.On the bike\u2019s saddle was Rachel, who was wearing a helmet and trembling as she drove the bike.\u201cIf they kidnapped her to take her hostage, England wouldn\u2019t hesitate to hand over the rights to Clancy Islet. Their goal must have been the entire country, not just Roton Corporation. Those evil bastards\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, stop murmuring to yourself and look over there.\u201dChae Nayun nudged Yoo Yeonha\u2019s shoulders.\u201cWhat, I\u2019m busy right\u2026 now\u2026 Eh?\u201dYoo Yeonha suddenly felt drained. This time, Chae Nayun murmured seriously.\u201cThat\u2019s the bike Kim Hajin ran off on.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s face became serious once again. Her head spinning fiercely, she continued her detective work.While everyone was distracted by the attack in Clancy Hall, Kim Hajin had run off on a bike. However, it was now Rachel who was riding on that same bike. Did that mean Kim Hajin defeated all those Djinns by himself and rescued Rachel?Impossible, not even Kim Hajin could be so fearless\u2026**Rachel and I split up in an awkward atmosphere.\u2014Does that mean\u2026 you like me?I denied her, but it didn\u2019t look like Rachel believed me. She said that she understood, but I felt like she interpreted things the wrong way.In any case, I returned to my hotel room alone.Of course, if I returned with Rachel, I would have been able to obtain a lot of SP as \u2018the cadet who saved the princess\u2019.However, receiving more attention than necessary was poisonous.Currently, Clancy Islet was filled with Evil Society\u2019s Djinns. They had failed in their mission, and no one knew where their fury would go.The Chameleon Troupe was fine since they were a group with the might and wealth to withstand Evil Society, but if Evil Society chose to vent their anger on me\u2026 my future would be bleak.\u201c\u2026Anyways, this place is amazing.\u201dMy hotel suite was beyond anything I imagined. Not to mention, it was all free. After winning 2 billion won at the casino, the casino manager told me to rest and upgraded my room for free.I sat down on the comfy couch and made a video call with my smartwatch.The call went through, and the face of a cute child popped up on the screen.\u2014Hajin!\u201cHey, have you been doing well?\u201dEvandel was a quick learner. She quickly learned to use basic electronic devices, and because I told her not to call me Daddy, she even started calling me by my name.\u2014Un, look at this!Evandel showed me a cat she made.A cat ghost.It was small and cute.\u201cWow, good job. It\u2019s really cute. I want to pet it.\u201d\u2014Heehee, right, right?I learned from the internet that praises were important for raising a child.\u2014By the way, Hajin, when are you coming back?\u201cTomorrow morning. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can. Wait just a little bit more.\u201dTo be honest, I wanted to go back right away. But because the entire island was undergoing a vetting process, I couldn\u2019t leave even if I wanted to.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019ll bring back something delicious. What do you want to eat?\u201d\u2014Fried chicken!\u201cAlright, got it.\u201dWiing\u2014I received a message on my smartwatch.The sender was Chae Nayun.[Hey, are you busy? Everyone is going to go get food.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Short Break (2)Rachel returned to the Royal Court under the protection of numerous Heroes.Her mother and father, the Queen of England and her consort, were worried sick, thinking that she had been abducted by Evil Society.Rachel corrected their misunderstanding, that she wasn\u2019t abducted, but had left of her own accord. Naturally, she had to tell them about the giant who ended up taking the White Crystal.Then, their worry became anger, and Rachel ended up being scolded.Their nagging continued for 30 minutes, telling her not to do something so reckless ever again, and that she would be transferred to England Academy if something similar happened again.After enduring their threats and scolding, she returned to her room.She felt like her ears were bleeding.Tired, she buried herself on her bed.\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201dMany things happened today that caused her to sigh.Roton Corporation\u2019s CEO, Zelen, was taken to the hospital after fainting. Once the stock market opened tomorrow, Roton Corporation\u2019s stocks were sure to plummet.What happened today wouldn\u2019t hurt England. Zelen had written a contract, vowing not to blame England no matter what happened.However, the \u2018Royal Court\u2019 guild would undoubtedly be impacted as Roton Corporation was its biggest sponsor. If Roton retracted their support, the Royal Court guild would surely falter financially.\u201c\u2026.\u201dPutting aside such concerns for now, Rachel thought about the incident that happened only two hours ago.First was Kim Hajin.He had used some unknown method to identify the Djinn who fled with the crystal and then chased after him. He had almost succeeded in retrieving the crystal, but a mysterious giant intervened and took the crystal away.In the end, the crystal was lost.However, the image that stayed in Rachel\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t the lost crystal, but the man who bashfully confessed that he was her fan.\u2026Suddenly, other thoughts began to emerge in her mind.He had left behind many \u2018hints\u2019. The biggest hint was the theory class.Kim Hajin was good at studying, but he was well known for not sharing his knowledge with others. She had also heard the slanderous rumors about him.\u2018But\u2026 it was different with me. He always answered any question I asked. And during the final exam, he immediately revealed his location with me, strongly expressing his desire to be with me. But I refused, and he watched over me from afar, helping me when I was in a dangerous situation.\u2018At first, I didn\u2019t understand why. I couldn\u2019t find any reason he would help me. But now\u2026 everything makes sense. If what he did wasn\u2019t directed by reason but feelings, then everything makes sense.\u2019\u201c\u2026!\u201dAt that moment, Rachel was struck with a flash of insight.Perhaps, this was a great opportunity. The Royal Court guild needed someone strong in both theory and combat. Kim Hajin was such a person. If it was him, he would be able to raise the Royal Court guild\u2019s prestige.\u2018Then, if I could lead the favorable feelings he has for me in that direction\u2026. No.\u2019Rachel shook her head.It was still someone\u2019s feelings. Manipulating and making use of someone\u2019s feelings was something that people shouldn\u2019t do. Rachel immediately shook off the horrible thought she had.Tak.She even smacked her own head.**10 P.M.I came to the first floor of the hotel-casino. I thought that traveling club\u2019s members would be waiting there. However, Chae Nayun was the only one in front of the hotel entrance. She was killing time tapping on the ground with her toes.\u201cHaaam\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun yawned as though she was sleepy, and then noticed me.She looked at me and grinned.\u201cWhy are you staring?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI shrugged without answering her.\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\u201cThey went ahead. Why are you always late?\u201dI ended up being late because of the video call with Evandel.\u201cSorry, I had something to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dChae Nayun took out the magic sword I gave her from her pocket.\u201cAnyways, thanks for giving me this. It helped a lot.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dI didn\u2019t really need it back, but I still took it and put it in my pocket.Chae Nayun pointed to the front and exclaimed heartedly.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll pay for the food.\u201dShe then stomped forward excitedly. I followed her out of the hotel.It was dark outside, but beautiful lights lit up the darkness. Because today\u2019s trouble was limited to Clancy Hall, other places were operating as usual.\u201cHey.\u201dWhile I was walking slowly, Chae Nayun suddenly tapped on my shoulder.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that yours?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Huh?\u201dAt the place Chae Nayun pointed, the motorbike I drove earlier in the day was parked. I sneaked up to the bike. I really wanted it. It seemed the owner of the bike was a guest of this hotel.Chae Nayun smacked her lips and asked.\u201cCan we ride it there?\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not mine. I borrowed it back then too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dWe both walked away reluctantly.Tak, tak.We began to walk towards the restaurant again. I turned on the smartwatch GPS. Chae Nayun was the last person I trusted to guide me.\u201cHey.\u201dI was walking silently, and Chae Nayun suddenly initiated a conversation. I looked back at her.Under a dim streetlight, she smiled coolly. Then, she asked fleetingly.\u201cDon\u2019t you think we can be friends?\u201dMy feet came to a stop.Friends. It was a word that never crossed my mind.I stared at Chae Nayun blankly. She was playing with her hair and pretending to be indifferent. I didn\u2019t know what she was thinking or why she suddenly said what she said.However\u2026\u201cNo.\u201dStaring at her directly, I cut down her offer coldly.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dThere was no way we could be friends. As someone who would eventually leave this world, and as someone who would kill her most precious person\u2026I couldn\u2019t become her friend.\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun stood still, seemingly taken off guard. She stared at me without even breathing. Soon, with a slightly stiff expression, she let out a sigh, then forcefully made a smile.\u201cS-Screw you. Fine, if you don\u2019t wanna be friends, then screw off.\u201dShe smacked my shoulder, then ran forward.\u201c\u2026.\u201dSilently staring at her back, I rubbed my shoulder.\u201c\u2026That freaking hurt.\u201dTo be honest, it felt like I was hit with a hammer.**Next day.I went shopping, finishing up what I went to do yesterday.I visited another antique shop. Although most antiques were only a little special in appearance and otherwise useless, I was able to pick up two items.===[Horse Saddle] [Antique]A horse saddle used by a nameless cavalryman 500 years ago.If you sit on this saddle, you will be able to handle rides better.======[Hornflute] [Antique]A flute used by a wandering minstrel of Joseon.If you blow this horn, your throat will become clean and your voice will become clearer for three hours.===They were useless in combat and were for more practical uses. Still, I really liked the horse saddle. Although it was expensive, I knew it would pay for itself one day.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNow, it was noon.We stood in front of Clancy Islet\u2019s Portal. With our status being clear, we didn\u2019t need to undergo further investigation.But behind us, a group of five people was lined up, waiting for their turn. I tried my best not to stare at them inadvertently. They were all members of the Chameleon Troupe, who were disguised with Jain\u2019s Gift.From Clancy Islet to England, then England\u2019s Portal Station to Seoul.We used two Portals in total.\u201cThere was an unexpected trouble yesterday, but as Heroes, we should start getting used to such situations.\u201dThat was what Oh Hanhyun said after we arrived at Seoul Portal Station. Everyone nodded as they made bitter smiles.\u201cNow, let\u2019s all go back home. Well done everybody, both yesterday and today!\u201dAfter Oh Hanhyun\u2019s words of encouragement, we left the Seoul Portal Station.Then, everyone other than me froze.The outside of the Portal Station was bustling with reporters.\u2014Ah, they\u2019re here!\u2014They\u2019re back!The reporters\u2019 cameras flashed blindingly.\u2014Is it true that Princess Rachel was abducted yesterday in Clancy Islet?\u2014Just what happened!?\u2014There have been reports that Kim Suho cadet performed great service at the incident\u2026The reporters bombarded us with questions. Videos of what happened in Clancy Hall must have spread to Korea, and Kim Suho\u2019s outstanding performance surely made headlines.The other club members were standing in a daze, but I wasn\u2019t. I knew that the reporters would have no interest in me.Stealthily turning back, I sneaked away to a restaurant known for its roasted chicken.I had to buy snacks for Evandel who was waiting for me at home.\u201cGive me two\u2026 no, three.\u201d\u201cThree, got it.\u201dAfter buying three roasted chicken, I went back to the Portal Station.The interview was still ongoing. Yoo Yeonha, who liked media attention, was talking to the reporters as her hair fluttered in the air.Ignoring them, I went to the Portal leading to Cube.\u201cHua.\u201dCube\u2019s scenery was familiar like home. Feeling the air of the East Sea, I walked through the central park. Soon, Dorm 1 appeared. My room was number 109, which was convenient since I didn\u2019t need to take the elevator. I put my thumb on the fingerprint scanner.Tiririk\u2014 The door opened with a ringing tone.I slammed the door shut as soon as I got in.At the same time, Evandel and all the animals she created ran at me.\u201cHajin~\u201dI hugged Evandel who ran into my embrace. She rubbed her face against my chest, showing her joy. In an instant, my heart became calm and full.I wondered if I\u2019ll be able to feel this when I have kids in the future.Evandel looked at me with twinkling eyes and asked.\u201cDid you buy chicken?\u201d\u201cYeah, I bought a lot.\u201dI held up a plastic bag full of chicken.**Three days until the start of the second semester.I thought I had quite a fruitful break. I hunted hard, trained hard, and added another function to my laptop \u2013 \u2018Smartwatch Link\u2019.It was annoying having to open the laptop every time something happened, but I was putting it off because I didn\u2019t want to use SP.[An incredible luck applies, warding you from certain death!][Narrow Escape from Death (3/9) \u2013 A special stat, accumulation of luck, becomes partly unlocked!][You obtained 193 SP!]I made the change using the 193 SP I gained thanks to Cheok Jungyeong. Now that I had it, I wondered why I delayed such a convenient function until now.\u2014Oh, Hajin, what\u2019s up?I called Park Soohyuk using my upgraded smartwatch.\u201cHyung, did you get what I wanted?\u201dLast week, I asked Park Soohyuk to get me a motorcycle. I was calling him now to check how it was going.\u2014Yeah, I looked up the motorcycle with the best specs like you wanted, but it\u2019s really expensive. 150 million won. Agusta, I think it was called?\u201cIs that including all the additional functionalities you can put on it?\u201d\u2014No, it gets even more expensive. With things like mana coating and engine reinforcement, the final cost will be way more than what it\u2019s worth.\u201cDo it anyway. I won a lot of money at the casino.\u201dI won 2 billion won at the casino. Plus, that day was also approaching.The day Packhorse Master would conquer Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest, and consequently, the day I would become rich.\u2014\u2026Okay, I\u2019ll put in an order. But where are you going to ride it? There isn\u2019t anywhere in Korea that\u2019s suitable for such a high spec motorcycle.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dI had Aether, and I even had Horse Saddle which would improve my driving skills even more. In the case of an emergency, I could also use Bullet Time.\u2014Okay, I\u2019ll order it under our company\u2019s name, so come to pick it up later.\u201cThanks. Oh right, is the company growing well?\u201d\u2014\u2026Haha.Park Soohyuk replied with a laugh.\u2014We have 13 hunters with us now. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201cOoh, what an improvement~\u201d\u2014Haha, it\u2019s all thanks to you. We\u2019re preparing to expand our business. We\u2019re going to move to a better place soon too.\u201cThen I\u2019ll invest. Like I said before, I won a lot of money at the casino.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen I was excitedly talking with Park Soohyuk, an alert suddenly popped up on my laptop.In an instant, my face stiffened.It was from Violet Banquet.I hung up the call and confirmed its content.Someone had made a commission to the Truth Agency. It was the first commission in about a month and a half.[Please find this person.]Although the sentence was short, it came with the detailed personal information and picture of a man.His name was Fernin Jesus\u201cEh?\u201dI knew who this man was.Fernin Jesus.This was the man \u2018Tomer\u2019 loved and hated more than anyone \u2013 her father.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Attraction (1)The Hero Association gave the title \u2018Nine Evils\u2019 to the nine Djinns who rose to the peak of Djinn society. It was meant to brand them as \u2018the evils of humanity\u2019 or \u2018nine roots of evil\u2019, but the Djinns happily accepted the title, calling it the highest praise.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a waste of time again\u2026.\u201dThis place was the base of Wicked, the third-ranked Djinn of the Nine Evils. This base was a secret sanctuary made by reconstructing a deep cave in South Hamgyeong Province\u2019s mountain.[Truth Agency]\u2014We will answer anything.In this sanctuary, an ordinary Djinn named Tomer was looking into a computer. Her brown Latino skin and healthy figure shone even in the dark cave. However, there was no one giving her lewd glances.Even among ordinary Djinns under Wicked, Tomer was a bit special. She was an odd one who didn\u2019t care about missions and only cared about pursuing strength. A few Djinns even doubted her being a Djinn.\u201c\u2026What wind blew to make that woman stay in the office?\u201dAnother ordinary Djinn muttered quietly as he stole a peek at Tomer. It was uncommon to see her glued to her desk like she was now.\u201cSomeone told her about an information agency on Violet Banquet.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cProbably Seth. That guy\u2019s crazy about women.\u201dAt that moment, a field agent walked into the office. The two gossiping Djinns quickly buried their faces on their desk. The field agent looked around the office, then called someone\u2019s name.\u201cTomer.\u201d\u2018\u2026What now.\u2019 Tomer slowly got up, murmuring quietly to herself. The field agent heard her complaint clearly, but he only furrowed his brows and did not say anything about it. Tomer was a young, ordinary Djinn who was only 20 years old. But it was only her position that was ordinary. Her skill was enough to classify her as an elite.\u201cThere\u2019s a mission.\u201d\u201c\u2026A mission?\u201d\u201cYeah, an observation mission.\u201dThe agent handed a thick stack of documents to Tomer. Frowning, Tomer received the documents.**\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dLooking fixedly at my laptop, I pondered.Tomer was a bit of an unusual Djinn. She became a Djinn for one purpose.To kill her father with her own hands.To achieve this goal, Tomer sold a part of her soul.Tomer was that unfortunate.When she was seven, Tomer\u2019s father killed her mother and abandoned her.At first glance, he was just a human garbage, but there was another reason behind it.This setting was a device I implemented to eventually bring Tomer to Kim Suho\u2019s side. Though, I stopped serializing before I ever got to that part.In any case, with Wicked\u2019s help, she would eventually find her father even without me helping her. After killing him with her own hands, she would swear loyalty to Wicked. Before I went on hiatus, she had even become one of Wicked\u2019s executives.For the record, Wicked\u2019s executives were on a much higher position than ordinary executives. The executives of Wicked were only inferior to the Nine Evils themselves. In other words, they were the future leaders of Djinn society.\u201cHm.\u201dIf I found Tomer\u2019s father for her, would I be able to bring her to my side?Probably not. But if I used the plot device I created for Kim Suho\u2026For now, I unleashed the Book of Truth.I didn\u2019t know for sure where Tomer\u2019s father was. Thinking about all the information Tomer gave me, I willed the book to reveal his present state of affairs.Two streaks of Stigma disappeared in an instant.My left arm felt numb, and an intense headache shook my head. It felt like my vision was turning white.\u201cArgh.\u201dI collapsed on the ground, unable to endure the pain.The throbbing pain lasted for a minute before subsiding. I raised my head and looked at the Book of Truth. With two streaks of Stigma, I could find out about Fernin Jesus\u2019 current status, but I couldn\u2019t find his current location.[Fernin Jesus changed his name to \u2018Agus Benjamin\u2019, and has retired after undergoing plastic surgery.]**Sunday before the start of school.I visited Seoul\u2019s Magic Tower. It was to engrave magic seals on my obsidian bracelet.As the Magic Tower society was filled with materialistic snobs, I wore the luxury suit I bought in Clancy Islet to avoid being ignored.\u201cKim Hajin-ssi. Welcome.\u201dA guard mercenary checked my name on the reservation list and let me in.In the Magic Tower, where classical music flowed calmly, there were many others who made reservations to come. A magician approached me while I was looking around.\u201cKim Hajin-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Jin Yohan, a 4-star magician. You made a reservation for magic seal-related business, correct?\u201dA 4-star artifact artificer was the highest ranked magician an ordinary person could meet. I nodded in satisfaction.Jin Yohan scanned me up and down, then spoke with a smile.\u201cFollow me. Let\u2019s go to the office.\u201dJin Yohan\u2019s office was on the 33rd floor.As soon as he sat down on his counseling chair, his secretary brought him a cup of coffee. Jin Yohan took a sip, then cut straight to the chase.\u201cWhat kind of magic seal are you looking to engrave?\u201d\u201cPhysical ability enhancement. Or do you have a physical defense magic?\u201d\u201cAh, yes we do.\u201dJin Yohan projected a hologram in the air.\u201cFirst is this. Speed boost.\u201dSpeed boost, strength enhancement, barrier, blood circulation, etc\u2026Most were fairly mediocre magic seals.\u201cDo you have any that runs with more magic power?\u201dMost magic seals engraved in artifacts used little magic power, as no matter how much internal magic power an artifact had, it wasn\u2019t enough to use anything above \u2018Speed Boost \u2013 Haste\u2019.However, this obsidian bracelet didn\u2019t have such restrictions. I needed a powerful, high-cost magic seal, even if it could only be used once a week.\u201cFor example, qi reinforcement or momentary awakening.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dJin Yohan gave me a strange look, then nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but it will be very expensive.\u201d\u202630 minutes later.I left after making a reservation.It seemed I needed to wait a bit more until I could obtain magic seals.At least until Packhorse Master finished conquering the Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest.**The month-long summer came to an end. Other cadets were busy traveling abroad and whatnot, but I spent most of the time training and raising a kid.\u201cThat picture you took in Japan came out really well.\u201d\u201cAh~ I wanted to go to Spain. If only my Portal pass didn\u2019t suddenly expire\u2026.\u201dCadets who came back to Cube seemed to have enjoyed their break as they all had bright faces.Even without seeing their faces, I could find out through their social media. Most went on vacations abroad, and some posted pictures of themselves training during their break.[Enduring a hard day, hoping for a better tomorrow.]That was one of Shin Jonghak\u2019s social media posts. The picture he uploaded with it was even more of a spectacle. It was a clear set-up shot with his sweaty head leaning on his spear. Because of his handsome appearance, I had to admit that he looked like a model.Just like this, I often checked the major characters\u2019 social media.Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha were rarely active on social media, and Rachel\u2019s social media was administered by the English Royal Court. As for Chae Nayun, she hasn\u2019t posted anything since the casino incident.[\u2026Too complicated. #FirstTime #ClancyIslet #Flustered #Annoyed #CubeCadet]Along with the short phrase and a string of hashtags was a picture she took of Clancy Islet\u2019s night scenery.This was Chae Nayun\u2019s last post.It looked like a typical attention-seeking post from a high schooler, but the reaction was explosive.===3982 likes.Uyeonha [Don\u2019t think too complicated.]Orange2574 [What? \u3160\u3160Did something happen?]Jonghak2 [Call me]Aeoaeo [Unni, why aren\u2019t you posting anything nowadays?]===\u201c\u2026She has so many likes.\u201dAs expected of a celebrity, Chae Nayun had many followers.Looking at it, I felt ostracized, so I went back to looking at stocks. It shouldn\u2019t be long until Packhorse Master\u2019s stocks skyrocketed.Five minutes later, 8:00 A.M.Kim Soohyuk walked into the classroom.As soon as he arrived, he knocked on his desk loudly and gathered the cadets\u2019 attention.\u201cToday is the start of the second semester. As you all know, the second semester comes with a big change. Not only will your rankings be different, new cadets will also join the class. Maybe some of you went to the welcoming ceremony yesterday.\u201dWelcoming ceremony. Starting from the second semester, magicians who wish to become Heroes will come to Cube from Korea\u2019s ten magic academies. 20 magicians per class for a total of 200. I already took note of magicians who would play important roles.\u201cThese transfer students will join us starting from today. Come in.\u201dWith the instructor starting to clap, cadets also began clapping. Then, the front door opened, and 20 black-robed magicians walked in.At first, I stared at them without much thought.One, two, three\u2026 Then suddenly, my eyes widened.\u201c\u2026What.\u201dAmong the twenty magicians, there was someone who shouldn\u2019t be there.Her skin was whitened and her hair dyed darker, but I was sure.It was Tomer.Tomer was raised in Korea from when she was 10 and was admitted to Gangwondo Magic Academy. Although she quit after 4 years, disillusioned with the magician community, her status was guaranteed just by having been admitted. With the few Djinns who were part of Cube\u2019s executives, she was indeed a good person to infiltrate Cube.\u201cEverybody, take a seat.\u201dAt Kim Soohyuk\u2019s words, the magicians sat down in empty seats.\u201cNow, I will announce the ranking change.\u201dTomer sat in the middle seat.Using my smartwatch, I checked whether I received any messages on my laptop.[Tomer \u2013 Although she plays an important role in the story, her appearance and strength are too sudden. It is better to create a connection between her and other major characters from the beginning.]\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dDoing useless things again.\u201cRank 1, Kim Suho!\u201dKim Soohyuk began to announce the rank change. He only voiced the top 10, and the rest was posted on a wall poster.===Rank 1 Kim SuhoRank 2 Shin JonghakRank 3 RachelRank 4 Chae NayunRank 5 Shen Yu\u2019anRank 6 Yoo Yeonha\u2026Rank 11 Yi Yeonghan\u2026Rank 17 Kim Horak\u2026\u2026Rank 334 Kim Hajin\u2026===Rank 334. My rank had gone up 600 places. Mmn, it was a moderate, average rank.I was satisfied.**The first outdoor class was training. The purpose was supposedly to get to know the transfer students. The name of it was \u2018dangerous hike\u2019.\u201cThere aren\u2019t any dangerous monsters on this mountain. But\u2026\u201dThe chief instructor, Kim Soohyuk, held up his index finger with a scary face.\u201cThere are terrifying hidden traps. They\u2019re replicas of what Djinns once used. You might end up being hospitalized, so make sure to stay on your toes.\u201dNext, Kim Soohyuk divided 120 people into 10 groups of 12.The 10 groups then began to climb the mountain from different starting points.\u201cAlright, everyone, let\u2019s go!\u201dChae Nayun belonged to Group 3, which included Kim Suho.\u201cOh, Chae Nayun.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201dChae Nayun and Kim Suho led two magicians and eight cadets to the foot of the mountain.Not long afterward, goosebumps began to appear on their arms. Not only did the wind get chilly, their surroundings also got dark. For the record, it was currently 10:30 A.M.Just the environment was scary and spooky enough, but there were also all kinds of traps just like the instructor said.Flames suddenly sprang up from the ground, tree branches coiled around them like tentacles, and even ghosts appeared to frighten them.\u201c\u2026God, my heart almost dropped.\u201dWhen a creepy female ghost appeared, the cadets all fell on the ground. Was Cube trying to give them nightmares to celebrate the start of school? Chae Nayun let out a deep sigh as she placed her hand on her heart.\u201cGeez, this is too scary.\u201dEven Kim Suho was murmuring in cold sweat.Looking at him, a thought suddenly flashed across her mind. The person who she was constantly thinking about, and made her feel complicated\u2026\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cHm? What?\u201dKim Suho tilted his head. Chae Nayun looked around sneakily. Other cadets were trying to calm their startled hearts and weren\u2019t paying attention to them.Consequently, she tried to act as nonchalant as possible, as she brought up something that didn\u2019t have much to do with the current situation.\u201cHey, you\u2019re my friend, right?\u201d\u201cWhat? Why ask that all of a sudden? Are you sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just answer me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell, of course I am.\u201dAt Kim Suho\u2019s immediate answer, Chae Nayun smiled bitterly. As expected, Kim Suho thought of her as a friend. Perhaps this was the normal reaction.However, Kim Hajin had clearly stated that he couldn\u2019t be her friend. Unlike Kim Suho, he was proclaiming that he would be more forward.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, a bush on the right side suddenly rustled, and a familiar face popped out.Speak of the devil, it was Kim Hajin\u2019s Group 6.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Group 3 met them coincidentally, and now they were taking a break together.\u201c\u2026Illusion barrier?\u201dGroup 6 had an easy time in the beginning with only a few wild animals appearing on their hike, but they had unknowingly entered an illusion barrier.\u201cYeah, I think we must have been lost in there for an hour or so. But suddenly, that guy told us to move with a frustrated face.\u201dSimon Delick pointed at a man sitting by a tree. Chae Nayun glanced over to that direction. There, Kim Hajin was looking at his smartwatch.\u201cAt first, we were like, who is this kid? But then he went ahead and found the exit instantly.\u201dChae Nayun nodded silently.\u201cOh right, did you decide on your team for the upcoming team challenge?\u201dSimon Delick asked, changing the topic.Just like he said, there was a team challenge coming up. Although nothing about it was announced, team challenge was a joint training exercise that was a tradition in Cube.\u201cNo.\u201dChae Nayun shook her head.Teams for the team challenge had to be fair. As such, top-ranking cadets like Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, Yoo Yeonha, and Shin Jonghak couldn\u2019t team up.Most teams were composed of \u2018one one-digit rank, one two-digit rank, two three-digit ranks, and one low-rank magician\u2019; or \u2018two two-digit ranks, two three-digit ranks, and one upper-rank magician\u2019. Of course, specific rankings were taken into account as well.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about asking Kim Hajin.\u201dAt that moment, Yi Jiyoon who was sitting quietly suddenly interjected. Caught off guard, Chae Nayun\u2019s body shook a little.Kim Suho laughed and chimed in.\u201cHajin? He\u2019s a good choice.\u201d\u201cKim Suho, you\u2019re close even with him?\u201dYi Jiyoon asked with a smiling face.\u201cUh\u2026 yeah.\u201dAlthough Kim Suho felt his relationship with Kim Hajin was a little vague, he still nodded. Then, Yi Jiyoon\u2019s face brightened.\u201cAs expected of Suho, you have so many connections.\u201dLike a sly fox, Yi Jiyoon was good at flattering people. Chae Nayun felt slightly displeased.\u201cBut why Kim Hajin? There are bad rumors about him.\u201dSimon Delick asked in a slightly jealous tone. Just like he said, there were horrible rumors about Kim Hajin. On the other hand, Yi Jiyoon was on the popular side. Not only was her pure and innocent face well liked by guys, her Gift was also one of the best among supporters.\u201cEveryone wants to have you on their team, Jiyoon.\u201dShe could shoot magic arrows imbued with a special buff. As its effect was exceptionally strong, most high ranking guilds in the country already had their eyes out for her.\u201cKim Hajin is the best candidate among three-digit cadets. He\u2019s smart and his combat prowess is exceptional. You remember his fight with Kim Horak, right?\u201dYi Jiyoon sent Kim Hajin who was sitting far away a meaningful look. No one knew whether he had heard Yi Jiyoon\u2019s praise, but he scratched his cheek. Yi Jiyoon turned her gaze to Chae Nayun.\u201cNayun, what do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dYi Jiyoon and Chae Nayun were stereotypical social media friends, the type that only exchanged likes and comments online.Chae Nayun brushed her hair aside and replied nonchalantly.\u201cWell, you can team up with him if you want. Why ask me?\u201dAlthough that\u2019s what Chae Nayun said, she certainly felt the same way.Kim Hajin was too good of a resource for someone in the 300\u2019s. No, in the first place, he wasn\u2019t someone who should be sitting in rank 334. For both Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun, this was a matter of fact.\u201cReally? Then I should try asking him today.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait.\u201dWhen Yi Jiyoon seemed ready to go, Chae Nayun hastily spoke up.\u201cHe\u2019s really picky. So um, he might not say yes.\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 um, you might get hurt, Jiyoon. He\u2019s a bit cold.\u201d\u201cNayun is right. Haven\u2019t you heard the rumors about him?\u201dSimon Delick also chimed in. Clearly, he was excited to bad-mouth Kim Hajin. Immediately, he began to recite some of the ill rumors; that Kim Hajin goes to Seoul every weekend to visit brothels and nightclubs, or that he receives money from gangs and other violent organizations, or that he has several sugar mommas\u2026. They were exaggerated rumors completely blown out of proportion.\u201c\u2026Do you really believe that nonsense?\u201d\u201cHey, Delick, have you personally seen him?\u201dUnable to endure his rambling, Chae Nayun and Kim Suho interrupted him simultaneously. Taken aback, Delick\u2019s pupils trembled.\u201cW-What, am I wrong?\u201dChae Nayun glared at Delick silently, then got up.Kim Suho clapped his hands and changed the atmosphere.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get going, guys. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be late.\u201d**Night, after end of classes.Yoo Yeonha finished preparing for a video call. Her face was completely covered, and her voice was changed as well.\u201cHmhm.\u201dToday was the first meeting with the information guild she established, Falling Blossom. She cleared her throat as to not have a voice crack.\u2014Tiriring.Soon, the video call began. The three team leaders of Falling Blossom guild greeted Yoo Yeonha with bare-faces.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you all.\u201d\u2014It\u2019s an honor, Master.Yoo Yeonha was satisfied with the team leaders\u2019 respectful tone.Falling Blossom\u2019s members were people Yoo Yeonha personally evaluated and recruited. Although their resumes might not be spectacular, she snatched them up without hesitation if they had potential.There were 21 founding members.Yoo Yeonha separated these 21 members into three teams.Members of the first team were Spies. They were in charge of gathering information on rival guilds.Members of the second team were Hawks. They were in charge of locating and identifying new Dungeons or monsters above the high-intermediate rank.Members of the third and final team were Shadows. They were in charge of taking care of Yoo Yeonha\u2019s private requests.\u201cTeam 1\u2019s top priority should be to find out the plans of rival guilds, namely Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace and Desolate Moon. Team 2 should\u2026\u201dYoo Yeonha began to talk in a formal manner that made it hard to distinguish even her gender. After giving Team 1 and Team 2 their respective missions, she ended her call with them.Now, only Team 3 remained. Members of Team 3 were elites that Yoo Yeonha was especially careful in choosing.Team 3 would thoroughly work in the shadows. From background investigations to tailing to kidnapping, threatening, and, if it came down to it, killing, they were to be Yoo Yeonha\u2019s secret weapon.\u201cI command you to thoroughly dig up the following members\u2019 backgrounds. However, it is strictly forbidden to hurt them or to be discovered.\u201dYoo Yeonha gave Team 3 information on five individuals. However, four of them were only there to fill the number. There was only one she wanted to know.===[Kim Hajin \u2013 17 years old]\u2014From Seoju Orphanage.\u2014When he was 9, he was discovered by periodic orphanage inspection and entered Agent Military Academy.\u2014Currently 334th ranked Cube cadet.\u2014Supplied Essence of the Strait with information worth hundreds of millions of won.===That was Kim Hajin.\u2014Understood, Master.Team 3\u2019s team leader went away with an affirmation.Yoo Yeonha nodded in satisfaction, then jumped into her bed.**Beep\u2014 Beep\u20146:30 A.M.I opened my eyes, awakened by the alarm.\u201cMmm.\u201dWhen I stretched, I noticed something light stuck to my side.It was Evandel.Puu, puu. She was letting out tiny breaths while sleeping. I grinned and put my finger over her nostrils.One second, two seconds, three seconds\u2026 Evandel quivered and shook my hand away.\u201cHuhu.\u201dA smile bloomed on my face. I stroked Evandel\u2019s soft hair for five minutes before getting up.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re awake too?\u201dOn the living room couch was a cat Evandel made. The cat jumped down from the couch and walked up to my feet. When I tried patting it, it growled.This cat wasn\u2019t an illusion or a spirit. It was a real cat Evandel made with her ability.Although it had no other ability other than being cute, it would become strong and help me out one day.I put on my clothes. I had to go bring breakfast. Of course, it was more convenient to eat outside and head straight to class.But nowadays, I felt happier eating together with Evandel.I put on slippers and went out.When I was waking to the cafeteria while yawning, someone approached me giving off a fragrant scent.\u201cWhere are you going so early in the morning?\u201dIt was Yoo Yeonha. She seemed to be out for a morning jog as she was wearing a comfortable-looking tracksuit.I replied briefly.\u201cThe cafeteria.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dYoo Yeonha made a nasal sound, then began to walk alongside me.\u201cAnyways, I noticed your ranking went up a lot.\u201d\u201cYeah, I think it\u2019ll stay in that range in the future.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha nodded, seemingly thinking about something.By the time the cafeteria was coming into view, Yoo Yeonha asked again.\u201cHave you thought about your future?\u201dFuture\u2026It was a word that didn\u2019t really click with me, so I just replied half-heartedly.\u201cI still have a lot of time to think about that sort of stuff.\u201d\u201cA lot of time? It\u2019s only a year and three months. Once we\u2019re in our third year, we\u2019ll be too busy with things like Hero internships and deployments.\u201dJust like she said, third years were no different than real Heroes. They only came to Cube once or twice a week and spent the rest acting as apprentice Heroes in different guilds.Yoo Yeonha continued.\u201cHow\u2019s Essence of the Strait?\u201dShe was clearly trying to coax me.Essence of the Strait, the guild that would later become Yoo Yeonha\u2019s.To be honest, it was a guaranteed success.Although it was currently ranked second because of Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace, it would reign supreme as the unshakable rank 1 guild once Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace failed their Tower of Miracle conquest. This wouldn\u2019t change even when Kim Suho joins Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace and brings it to a new height.\u201c\u2026I was thinking about becoming a hunter of the Vast Expanse.\u201dI was half-serious.Vast Expanse, a hunter group founded and named after Kwangwon[1], who was comparable in power to the Nine Stars.[2]Although they operated like a mercenary group, they worked on a completely different scale. The main customers of the Vast Expanse were large guilds or large corporations. Individuals who wanted to employ them had to be multimillionaires.As hunters of the Vast Expanse were mercenaries at their core, they were given an incredible level of freedom. There couldn\u2019t be a better status for someone like me.\u201cThough, I\u2019m not sure if I could become one.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha didn\u2019t say anything for a while. When I glanced at her, she was in deep contemplation with a very serious face.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll change your mind.\u201dThen, a determined voice rang out. Yoo Yeonha continued as she stared at me fixedly.\u201cIf I bring what you\u2019ve been looking for all this time, wouldn\u2019t you change your mind?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 I furrowed my brows.Then, Yoo Yeonha snickered and suddenly changed the topic.\u201cOh right, remember Yi Jin-Ah who bullied you? She got scolded reaaaaally hard. I even have a video of it. Do you want to see it? She\u2019s crying like a baby.\u201dYoo Yeonha walked strangely when she was feeling good. Like a daring little princess, she had her hands clasped behind her back and hopped.Then suddenly, she shot backward.As expected, there were other cadets some distance in front of us.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you later.\u201dWith that, Yoo Yeonha disappeared.**\u201cAlright, attention!\u201dWednesday, morning announcements.Kim Soohyuk\u2019s voice was just as loud in the morning as any other time.\u201cYou will need to form a team of five.\u201dIt was finally here.I closed my eyes and clenched my lips.Team challenge. It was kind of like a group project. From now, I would be doing rather annoying things as a member of a team. For example, conquering a miniature Tower, capturing artifacts against other teams, or going on team-building trips.Thankfully, team challenges only lasted until the midterms in six weeks.\u201cGet into teams that meet the requirement and submit a team member list by the end of next Wednesday. If you don\u2019t have a team by that time, I will place you in teams myself.\u201d\u201cHuu.\u201dForming a team was too sorrowful for outcasts like me.Though, I might be the best choice among three-digit cadets like Yi Jiyoon said.Tap, tap, tap.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAt that moment, I heard tiny tapping sounds.I turned around. On a seat a little ways behind me, Rachel was tapping on her desk with an anxious face.Oh right.Rachel was also in a similar situation to me. The difference was that I was ostracized while she was aloof, but it was the same in that we had no friends.Since that was the case, it might be good for us to team up.Plus, I had something to give her as well.\u2018Butterfly Seedling Dust\u2019.I had to give it to her even if I had to use force. Originally, Rachel was supposed to obtain a hint of her Enlightenment during the final exam. If it was delayed any longer, there was a chance that her basic specs would become lower than in the original story.\u201cHuu.\u201dAlthough I was a bit nervous, I took a deep breath and sent her a message.[Rachel-ssi, would you like to team up with me?]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut before she could check my message, someone approached her.\u201cWould you like to team up?\u201dIt was the robed magician, Tomer.1. Same name that is being translated as Vast Expanse. Will keep the name Romanized, and the group name translated.2. Nine Stars were briefly mentioned in chapter 18. They refer to the nine strongest Heroes in the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Attraction (3)Tomer\u2019s boldness attracted the attention of the entire class.Rachel stared at Tomer with puzzled eyes, but Tomer even reached her hand out to Rachel.Looking back and forth between them, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why it was Rachel.Within the Djinn society, Wicked had a similar position to mercenaries. They accepted money to carry out missions. Considering that Tomer approached Rachel, it was likely that Lancaster was the mastermind behind the mission Tomer received.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. There\u2019s still a lot of time left.\u201dRachel sent Tomer back for now. Then, she checked her smartwatch. It seemed she saw my message as her eyes widened.She glanced at me and our eyes met.Sssk.Rachel\u2019s head unnaturally turned to the window. She was trying to pretend that she wasn\u2019t trying to look at me.In any case, it seemed getting two offers made her happy as the corners of her mouth curled into a smile.I turned back around and faced the front of the class.After about 10 minutes of waiting, she gave me a reply.[I\u2019ll think about it.]I hoped she would pick me since we already had somewhat of a friendship.Now, I stopped thinking about the team challenge and focused on the more important issue.I stared at Kim Suho\u2019s back.Summer break had passed, so it was almost time.Currently, Kim Suho should be preparing to tackle a Dungeon. Just like protagonists of novels often did, he was planning to do it solo.However, most Dungeons couldn\u2019t be soloed unless the challenger was uncharacteristically powerful or the Dungeon was uncharacteristically weak.However, the Dungeon Kim Suho was planning on conquering was an exception. It was a matter of suitability.This Dungeon was small, with weak minions but a powerful boss. This boss was the Swordsman of Destruction, a monster that even a high-intermediate rank Hero would find difficult to handle.Right, he was a swordsman.Swordsman and a Sword Saint.Even Evandel could easily answer which of the two would win.The Sword Saint\u2019s magic power would easily shatter the swordsman\u2019s sword, and only a single tree branch would be left upon the swordsman\u2019s defeat.This branch was Kim Suho\u2019s weapon.Its divine name was Misteltein, also known as the god-slaying branch.It was a generic weapon of legends. It was a branch in some versions, but a sword or a spear in others. In the end, I set its unawakened form as a branch, so that it would become more sword-like as it awakened.However, because of its ordinary appearance, Kim Suho didn\u2019t know what it was at first.What changed this ordinary appearance was the Butterfly Seedling Dust. The Butterfly Seedling Dust would allow the ordinary branch to undergo its first awakening, turning the ordinary branch into a black branch.It was comical how powerful monsters like King Ogres and Sea Kings were beaten to death with a branch. Thinking back to the Kim Suho of my novel, I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle.In any case, I had to join this Dungeon conquest. After all, the Butterfly Seedling Dust was on me.But that wasn\u2019t the only reason. Frankly, I was worried.I wasn\u2019t sure Kim Suho could beat the Dungeon by himself. This world wasn\u2019t as easy and lax as the one I set up.\u2026Also.There might be breadcrumbs prepared for me as well.\u201cNow, go to class.\u201dWhile I was in thought, the morning announcement ended.I got up to go to class like I always did.\u201cAh, Hajin, where are you going?\u201dHowever, a girl I had never seen before clung to my side.\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI\u2019m going to class, where else would I be going?\u201cWell, you see, I was wondering if you had\u2014\u201dBefore the girl could finish, someone else cut in. This time, it was a guy.\u201cHajin!\u201dJin Hoseung. He was a male cadet who was in my team at the beginning of the first semester.\u201cI got tickets to go to the French Artifact Museum. Apparently, Napoleon\u2019s rifle will be on display tomorrow\u2026.\u201dI ended up accepting the ticket in the suddenness of the situation.But it didn\u2019t end with Jin Hoseung. A bunch of students, some who I knew the names of, some who I only knew the faces of, and some who I didn\u2019t know at all, all started bribing me.I accepted their gifts without declining.**My room, after all the classes ended.Sitting on my couch, I pondered. Evandel was sleeping using my thigh as a pillow, so I couldn\u2019t make any big movements.\u201c\u2026How should I handle it?\u201dI was thinking about Tomer.I knew how to appease her.Currently, she wasn\u2019t fully assimilated to the Djinn\u2019s side. In a way, she was currently following the philosophy of the golden mean.[1]As such, I felt like I could bring her to my side as long as I helped her find her father. But that was the problem. I couldn\u2019t find him. For some reason, the Book of Truth wasn\u2019t working.I would have no choice but to employ another method to find him. Yoo Jinhyuk was undoubtedly the best background informant, but he was too expensive and, more importantly, limited in range. To maximize his ability, Yoo Jinhyuk restricted the range of his ability to the Korean Peninsula. If Tomer\u2019s father wasn\u2019t in Korea, it would only be a huge waste of money and time.\u201c\u2026Oh right.\u201dSuddenly, I recalled something.I knew an informant, a trustworthy one at that.He was Kim Chundong\u2019s sole connection, an informant who looked like a piglet. What was his name? Kim\u2026 right, Kim Hosup.[1]Of course, we haven\u2019t talked to each other since I was admitted to Cube, so I didn\u2019t know his phone number. However, that was something I could easily find out.I quickly opened the Book of Truth.What I wanted to know was Kim Hosup\u2019s phone number.\u201cArgh.\u201dJust looking up a single phone number consumed 30% of my magic power. Was Book of Truth too costly? Or was two streaks of Stigma too little?In any case, I got the phone number I wanted. I immediately made the call.Tururu\u2014 Tururu\u2014 Three piglet brothers\u2014He had a strange ringtone, but he quickly picked up.\u2014Hello?Kim Hosup\u2019s had a deep voice unlike what I expected.\u201c\u2026Hey, Hosup. It\u2019s Hajin. How have you been?\u201d\u2014Ah~ Hajin-chan~ It\u2019s been a while!His tone was quick to change.\u2014What\u2019s up?\u201cUm\u2026 Hosup.\u201d\u2014Uuun~?\u201cWhat have you been doing lately?\u201d\u2014Me~?The way he dragged out the end of his sentence got on my nerves, but Hosup was an important connection nonetheless.Although he wasn\u2019t treated well because of his outer appearance and his strange personality, he would be noticed by Yoo Yeonha in seven years and come to play an important role.\u2014I\u2019m\u2026 doing okay. Why did you call me?His voice was noticeably meek. Tsk, it seemed he was being bullied by seniors in his workplace.Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have the time to comfort him.\u201cNothing much. Just\u2026 I\u2019m wondering if you can help me find a person.\u201d\u2014A person?\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll send you a supercomputer as a payment.\u201dHosup\u2019s Gift was related to computers. As such, a good computer amplified his Gift\u2019s power.\u2014Supercomputer~? But isn\u2019t Hajin-chan poor?\u201cI have a lot of money now. I\u2019ll be able to send it to you this week. So, can you do it?\u201d\u2014\u2026If you have a little bit of his background information, it should be possible~.\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll send it to you immediately.\u201dI sent him Fernin Jesus\u2019 false identity, which I found out with the Book of Truth, and the picture of him I got from Tomer.\u201cAlright, I just sent it. Also, Chundong\u2026 I mean, Hosup.\u201dFor a moment, I got the two names confused.\u2014Hm?\u201cIf you\u2019re going to quit your job\u2026\u201dKim Hosup was a good person. He might not be an altruist or a philanthropist, but he wasn\u2019t someone who would do anything bad.In other words, he would be more helpful the earlier he was discovered.\u201cThere\u2019s a new information guild called Falling Blossom. You should join it. They only care about your ability, so they\u2019ll treat you well.\u201dI told Hosup the workplace he would shine in in the future.**10:00 P.M., a time when no classes were going on.Kim Suho was training alone in a dark forest inside Cube.Shwik\u2014The sword he stretched out caused the air to undulate. After a light jab, he let out soft slashes, followed by a spinning slash. The perfect flow in his movements made it seem like the sword was protecting the swordsman.It was a flawless sword technique, sharper than a blade and lighter than a feather.Just like this, Kim Suho reflected on his sword technique every night. To not lose the mindset of a Knight, and to advance his sword technique a step further.Nowadays, there was another reason he was devoting himself to training. That was\u2026\u201cAre you training?\u201dAt that moment, someone\u2019s voice rang out.Startled, Kim Suho turned around.\u201c\u2026Kim Hajin?\u201dKim Hajin was leaning against a tree, seemingly having watched his sword training. Kim Suho put his sword away. Kim Hajin approached him with a smile.Kim Suho quickly asked.\u201cAre you also here to train?\u201dKim Hajin shook his head.\u201cNo, I\u2019m just on a walk. Anyways, it\u2019s still early in the semester, but you sure are hard at work. If someone saw, they would think you\u2019re trying to conquer a Dungeon alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dImmediately, Kim Suho\u2019s body shook slightly.Kim Hajin maintained his smile as he continued to chatter uncharacteristically.\u201cNo way, am I right?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dKim Suho denied with a smile. However, Kim Hajin\u2019s eyes were narrowed, giving a meaningful look. Faced with his eyes, which seemingly pierced through everything, Kim Suho shrunk back slightly.\u201cYou went out last week, right? To Kamak Mountain. I saw you on my way back.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Suho silently stared at Kim Hajin.Resonance of the sword.That was what Kim Suho felt from Kamak Mountain.At first, he had climbed the mountain to feel its life energy.However, a sword qi buried in the mountain called him. This strange yet desperate call attracted his attention, and when he went to the epicenter of the sword qi, he found an unidentified Dungeon.\u201c\u2026How did you know?\u201dKim Suho asked, his voice vigilant.\u201cI saw you coincidentally. You know how I like to go out a lot. And not to brag or anything, but my eyes\u2026\u201dKim Hajin tapped his eyes as he spoke.\u201cIf I climb Kumgang Mountain, I can see up to Seoul\u2026 no, Uijeonbu.\u201d[2]Kim Suho continued staring at Kim Hajin without talking. Silence usually made people anxious. However, Kim Hajin was completely at ease as he continued to say what he wanted.\u201cIf you really plan on conquering a Dungeon, let me join. I\u2019m pretty useful outside of Cube.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll split the loot 9:1. If you get a tree branch, I\u2019ll only take a few leaves.\u201d**A week passed by in the blink of an eye, and Monday came around once again. There were only two days left until the team submission deadline.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun was in thought, looking at the notebook on her desk.There was one spot left on her team. She needed a cadet outside of the top 100.In team challenges, a team with a lower average rank was given bonus points. Naturally, you wanted a cadet who was cost-effective, and that had to be\u2026 Kim Hajin.She sneaked a peek at Kim Hajin\u2019s seat.Kim Hajin\u2019s name popped up often in the class group chat, which showed just how popular he was for the team challenge selection. However, Chae Nayun was fairly confident that he would choose her if she asked.There was only one reason that she hesitated to ask him.She was worried that Kim Hajin would misunderstand.She wanted him to join her team for the team challenge. There was no ulterior motive.\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat, are you having trouble forming your team?\u201dAt that moment, Shin Jonghak, who was sitting behind her, asked.Shin Jonghak already had his team \u2013 Kim Horak and three others. Because 2nd ranked and 17th ranked cadets were in the same team, the other three were way below average in rank, but since it was Shin Jonghak, he would find a way to squeeze out their potential.\u201cNo, I\u2019m just thinking\u2014\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201dShin Jonghak suddenly reached forward and stole Chae Nayun\u2019s notebook.\u201cAh, HEY\u201d\u201cHazuki, Raymond, and\u2026 Kim Hajin? Kim Hajiiin?\u201dHe repeated Kim Hajin\u2019s name loudly. Immediately, the attention of the class fell on her. Naturally, Kim Hajin was included.Kim Hajin was staring at her. Chae Nayun felt her face growing red like a tomato.\u201cEeee, ee\u2026.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say Kim Hajin\u2014\u201d\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d\u201cUk!\u201dChae Nayun struck Shin Jonghak\u2019s solar plexus.Shin Jonghak was completely caught off guard by Chae Nayun\u2019s sudden attack.Slumped down on the desk, Shin Jonghak endured the pain.\u201c\u2026uuu\u2026. uuuu\u2026.\u201dShin Jonghak\u2019s scream rang out intermittently.\u201cDon\u2019t steal and look at other people\u2019s stuff. Hey, Kim Suho.\u201dChae Nayun quickly changed the subject. Kim Suho was sitting next to her.\u201cWho are you going to team up with?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Suho was silent. He was tapping on his notebook with a pen, seemingly thinking about something.\u201cKim Suho?\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? Oh.\u201dWhen she called him again, he finally turned around in a daze.Chae Nayun peeked at his notebook.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re asking Kim Hajin too?\u201dKim Hajin\u2019s name was written in his notebook.\u201cHuh? Oh, um, I guess so.\u201d\u201c\u2026Everyone\u2019s asking Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201cA fitting\u2026 combination\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, Shin Jonghak reined in his pain and muttered just barely.\u201cTwo\u2026 trifling commoners\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut it. Yoo Yeonha, what about you?\u201dYoo Yeonha, who was staring at her smartwatch, raised her head.\u201cMe? My team\u2019s already decided.\u201dYoo Yeonha formed her team with people she could easily manipulate. Although she also coveted Kim Hajin, she was more comfortable with people whom she could handle with ease.\u201cHm\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, the theory instructor walked in.He placed a thick textbook on the podium and started taking attendance.\u201cOh, by the way, there will be team challenges for theory classes as well.\u201dThat was what the instructor said next.Chae Nayun decided as soon as she heard those words.Bless Kim Hajin.*\u201cThat\u2019s it for today. Make sure you review it before next class.\u201dThe class ended. Chae Nayun snapped up from dozing off. She got up quickly and chased after Kim Hajin, who just left the class.\u201c\u2026Hey.\u201dShe grabbed Kim Hajin\u2019s shoulder.Kim Hajin looked at her and asked what was going on with his eyes.Chae Nayun felt a bit nervous.\u201cUm, about your team\u2026.\u201dWhen she was about to ask, someone walked past her.Blonde hair and delicate fragrance.It was Rachel. With an innocent face, she tilted her head and asked.\u201cTeam?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, it doesn\u2019t concern you\u2026\u201d\u201cHajin-ssi decided to team up with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s facial expression became stiff. She swallowed hard, then turned to Kim Hajin. Kim Hajin nodded somewhat regretfully(?).\u201cUh, um, really? Well, I, uh, didn\u2019t think you had anyone to team with, so I thought I\u2019d save you. You know, as a fellow traveling club member. Right\u2026 well\u2026 good luck.\u201dWithout knowing what was coming out of her own mouth, Chae Nayun turned around after smacking Kim Hajin\u2019s shoulder.At first, she didn\u2019t know what to think. She was just in a daze. But while she was walking, she suddenly got annoyed and turned back around.She coincidentally met eyes with Rachel who was going the same way.Rachel gave a small nod in greeting. Chae Nayun clenched her teeth.Same sex, but opposite personality and similar grades (theory excluded).Rachel was someone who Chae Nayun regarded as a rival second only to Kim Suho. No, nowadays, Rachel had surpassed Kim Suho to become her soul rival.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018\u2026Why her of all people?\u2019Chae Nayun stomped away like a raging bison.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)2.

Teamwork (1)Rachel stopped in the middle of walking. Seeing that she had somewhat of a serious face, I also stopped with her. She stared at me fixedly, then spoke.\u201cI already submitted the team list.\u201dTeam Rachel was composed of the following members: Rachel, Jin Hoseung, Yi Bokgyu, Kim Hajin, Tomer.Rachel had the highest rank, and Jin Hoseung and Yi Bokgyu were rank 108 and 173 respectively. The team list deadline was Wednesday, but Rachel had already submitted it.\u201c\u2026So you can\u2019t go somewhere else.\u201dThat\u2019s what Rachel said. Perhaps because of what Chae Nayun said, her eyes and voice seemed a bit worried.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cAh, they\u2019re over there!\u201dAt that moment, the other team members arrived. Jin Hoseung, Yi Bokhyu, and Tomer, all of them.\u201cWe\u2019re in the same team now. Let\u2019s go get some food together.\u201dJin Hoseung spoke excitedly. Was it because he was in Rachel\u2019s team?I glanced at Rachel who nodded.\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 well, what do you want to eat, Rachel-ssi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201dRachel wasn\u2019t a particularly picky eater, but there was something she liked.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Hangyujung, the Korean restaurant.\u201d\u201cUh, sure.\u201dYi Bokgyu and Jin Hoseung didn\u2019t seem to mind, and Rachel let out a satisfied cough. Only Tomer had no reaction.\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dIt was a short answer.\u201cGreat.\u201dIt was decided.\u201cOh right.\u201dWhile we were walking looking at a GPS, Jin Hoseung suddenly came up to me.\u201cHajin, about the ticket I talked about before, it\u2019s in two days. Do you want to come with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026To France?\u201dImmediately, Rachel\u2019s eyes flickered fiercely. France and England had a relationship similar to Korea and Japan. Because I added a setting that England and France had an artifact scramble about 20 years ago, the feeling between the two countries was at its worst.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dTo be honest, I was curious about Napoleon\u2019s rifle, but I didn\u2019t want to go all the way to France just to see it.\u201cWhy? Who knows, maybe Napoleon\u2019s rifle will become yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026Napoleon?\u201dRachel muttered in a small voice.\u201cHow? I\u2019m rank 334.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be better to put it to use than to just keep it in the museum\u2026. By the way, Hajin, don\u2019t you think your voice changed a bit?\u201d\u201cKuhum. Did it?\u201dThat was thanks to the flute I bought in Clancy Islet\u2019s antique shop.===[Hornflute] [Antique]A flute used by a wandering minstrel of Joseon.If you blow this horn, your throat will become clean and your voice will become clearer for three hours.===I used it for the first time about five minutes before I went to see Kim Suho. Because a deep voice carried more reliability.Ever since then, I\u2019ve been using the flute often. I liked how my voice sounded clearer, and it felt great to open up my throat in the morning.\u201cYeah, is it puberty?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThankfully, I didn\u2019t have to answer his question that lacked common sense, as we arrived at the Korean restaurant.Rachel went in first, smacking her lips.**An abandoned factory in Suwon.After nine months, all members of the Chameleon Troupe gathered in their hideout. Droon had finally figured out how to use the White Crystal, and the purpose of their gathering was to spectate.\u201c\u2026Kid, do I really break it?\u201dCheok Jungyeong asked again, carrying an artifact sword in one hand. Droon frowned and urged him on.\u201cYeah, do it.\u201d\u201cTsk, don\u2019t blame me if anything goes wrong.\u201dCheok Jungyeong grumbled as he wrapped his fist with magic power. The density of the magic power made it seem as though he was wearing a gauntlet.KWANG.Cheok Jungyeong\u2019s fist clashed with the artifact sword. The result was that the sword shattered like glass.\u201cHappy?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dDroon picked up a fragment of the shattered sword and placed it on a stone table.\u201cI\u2019ll initiate it now.\u201dWoong\u2014 The White Crystal began to resonate, unleashing magic power. The magic power condensed inside the cube encasing the crystal then began to radiate towards the sword fragment. The crystal\u2019s white magic power clung to the fragment, forming a crystalline sword.\u201cOooh.\u201dCheok Jungyeong applauded in amazement, while the rest of Chameleon Troupe members made shocked faces.\u201cThere. Just like that, the tiny sword fragment became a partial artifact. According to my test, it\u2019s at least as strong as a low-rank artifact. A single artifact can produce about 30 partial artifacts and taking the crystal\u2019s magic power capacity into account, we\u2019ll be able to make about 600 more.\u201d\u201cAnd we sell each partial artifact for about 700~800 million won\u2026. Amazing.\u201dEven with a simple calculation, one could see that it was close to a 500 billion won profit. Even after deducting the black market and money laundering fees, it would be about 20 billion won per member. It was indeed worth the risk.\u201cYeah, but it\u2019ll take at least 5 years to sell it all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Oh, by the way.\u201dJain suddenly cut in.\u201cPackhorse Master started their Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest conquest.\u201dThe eyes of the Chameleon Troupe\u2019s members flickered with a conspicuous light.Packhorse Master.They were the prey Chameleon Troupe was eyeing.They had finally started their activities.*\u201cLook, if you do this\u2026.\u201d9:00 P.M.It was time for children to sleep, but Evandel was busy playing with clay dough.She seemed to be using too much magic power on creating spirit bodies, so I prepared a toy she could use to have fun.\u201cTada~\u201d\u201cWow, what\u2019s this?\u201dEvandel made a penguin with glasses, which she often saw on TV. I opened my eyes wide in surprise. Evandel puffed out her chest with a proud face.\u201cHow did you make it? Are you a genius?\u201d\u201cHihi, want me to tell you?\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be able to do it even if you did. This is a skill you were born with.\u201dWhile I was making Evandel smile with continued praises, my smartwatch suddenly rang.It was Kim Suho.[Can you come out to the forest we met at last time?]\u2018Oho, so you finally made your decision.\u2019With a smile, I got up from my seat.\u201cEvandel, I\u2019m going to be out for a bit.\u201d\u201cUn? Where are you going?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 to buy some snacks for us to eat before bed.\u201d\u201cSnacks? I want cake!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cCake, cake!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy some, don\u2019t worry.\u201dUsing that as an excuse, I went outside.Cake, cake.Repeating the word \u2018cake\u2019 so as to not forget about it, I headed to the forest where Kim Suho was waiting.Cube\u2019s night was chilly even during summer. It was because Cube was an island in the middle of the East Sea.Rubbing my shoulders every time the wind blew, I arrived at the meeting spot.In the middle of the dark forest, Kim Suho was standing with a serious face. His usual gentleness was gone as the air carried a heavy atmosphere.\u201cYo, Kim Suho, why\u2019d you call me?\u201dHearing my voice, Kim Suho turned around.He stared at me for a long time with heavy eyes, then let out a deep sigh. It seemed he was about to say something serious.\u201c\u2026Do you remember what you said to me last time?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh yeah, what about it?\u201d\u201cJust like you said\u2026 I recently found a Dungeon.\u201dI smiled silently. I already expected him to say this.\u201cIt must have been formed recently since it\u2019s small. So I was thinking about challenging it alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026But it\u2019s still a Dungeon. It\u2019s a big risk to try to conquer it alone.\u201dI crossed my arms leisurely and interrupted him.Kim Suho calmly nodded in response.\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking the same thing\u2026.\u201dKim Suho suddenly threw down his jacket.\u201cBut if I\u2019m going to trust my back to you, I\u2019ll need to verify your skills.\u201dHe murmured in a low voice as he stared at me.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dI was taken aback. The situation was turning out a bit differently than I had expected.\u201cI know the exact location of the Dungeon. So it\u2019s okay if I determine whether you will be a help or a burden, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Right. Kuhum.\u201dMy crossed arms began to tremble.To be honest, even if Kim Suho was blind and left-handed, I wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat him. That was the difference between our skill. Not to mention, Kim Suho was a swordsman, while I was a sharpshooter.\u201cYou\u2019re right, but there\u2019s one thing you haven\u2019t considered.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s that\u201dI racked my brain to try and avoid this fight.Should I try showing him the power of my Desert Eagle? Even without having to fight, he should be able to see my attack power if I shoot a tree trunk.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair for a sharpshooter and a warrior to fight one-on-one in an open field. Plus, I\u2019m a bit reliant on my weapon. Depending on the type of gun, the difference in my attack power will be like the difference between heaven and earth\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to beat me.\u201dHowever, Kim Suho cut me off.\u201cAnd the weapon doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not trying to test your weapon\u2019s power.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll stop when I\u2019m satisfied.\u201dNow I had nothing to say.Kim Suho took out his sword. It wasn\u2019t a cadet sword, which was made out of steel, but a wooden sword for sparring. However, the quality of a sword didn\u2019t matter for Kim Suho.The moment his magic power surrounds that sword, my bullets would stop working. Using anti-magic wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Kim Suho\u2019s magic power existed on a higher dimension, and it could even cut \u2018anti-magic\u2019.\u2026A good idea suddenly popped into my head.\u201cOh, but I forgot to bring a gun.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that on your waist?\u201dI looked down at my waist. The cadet handgun I usually carried around was in my belt\u2019s holster.\u201cOh\u2026 I brought it\u2026. I forgot\u2026.\u201dWithout any other choice, I took the gun out.\u201cBut will it be okay? Unlike a wooden sword, I won\u2019t be able to control my gun\u2019s strength.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026Also, this isn\u2019t my real weapon. I\u2019m using this since we\u2019re prohibited from carrying personal weapons in Cube, but\u2026\u201dI racked my brain as I tried to buy time. I began to look around for something that could trigger my luck.First, I checked the surrounding terrain.We were in a forest, the sky was dark and the wind was cool.Kim Suho\u2019s hair fluttered from the westerly wind, and the jacket he threw down flapped on the ground.\u2026Wait.Jacket.The jacket on the ground.To be recognized by Kim Suho, the help of my SP and luck was necessary.\u201cAre you ready?\u201dSeeing me staring at the ground, Kim Suho spoke up.\u201cHold on. Someone sent me a message.\u201dI wasn\u2019t ready yet. I began to operate the laptop on my smartwatch.\u2026For two minutes, I busily tapped on the holographic keyboard. The result was as follows.===[Cadet Jacket]A jacket created by Cube.\u2014Trap Transformation*When someone steps on this jacket, an unknown force will strongly push the person off.*This effect lasts for 10 minutes and will disappear after one activation.===[25 SP will be consumed. Would you like to save?]Perhaps because it was a one-time change that wouldn\u2019t deal any damage, I needed less SP than expected. This was undoubtedly worth the investment.\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201dI turned the smartwatch off, then took a deep breath.Saved.\u201cThen let\u2019s start.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dThe man who would become the worlds strongest was standing in front of me. He was only standing, but I felt an immense pressure pressing down on me.I held my breath in the surging tension. Then, Kim Suho charged towards me. His speed was beyond what I could follow with my naked eyes.Normally, I would have been incapable of reacting to his movements, but I was able to with Bullet Time.My sense of time slowed down.Although Kim Suho was still much quicker than me, I could see his wooden sword clearly.After ducking and barely avoiding a slash, I glanced away to locate the jacket.Four steps.I didn\u2019t wish for anything more.I just wanted to walk four more steps.Whish\u2014Kim Suho\u2019s wooden sword swung past my eyes. I fired at Kim Suho\u2019s foot, which Kim Suho dodged by jumping up lightly. Then, he swung his sword, swirling backward.The wooden sword grazed my shoulder. A burning pain overwhelmed me, but I managed to take two steps.However, Kim Suho\u2019s sword, which just grazed my shoulder, soared up.My instincts roared.This attack was going to hit.I was physically incapable of dodging it. How could someone like me avoid a sword that hurled toward me five times a second?With no other choice, I used Aether.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAether shot up from my feet, pushing me to the side. With that, I was only a single step away from the jacket.Kim Suho seemed surprised that I avoided his consecutive strikes. However, he chased after me without giving me a chance to collect my breath. Charging at me like a drill, he swung his sword at my shoulder.However, before his sword could hit my body\u2026He stepped on the jacket.That was it.\u201c\u2026!\u201dKim Suho\u2019s body disappeared from my sight. Without even a scream, he was sent flying.His center of gravity was pushed forward because of that final strike, and because he was completely caught off guard, Kim Suho couldn\u2019t make a proper landing. He fell and rolled on the ground about 50 meters away.He tried to get up quickly.However, my bullet struck first on a rock next to Kim Suho\u2019s head.\u201c\u2026In a real fight, that wouldn\u2019t have missed.\u201dThough, it would have been blocked by his qi reinforcement anyways.I trudged up to Kim Suho. He had a soulless, blank face.When I reached out to lend him a hand, a deep smile emerged on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Teamwork (2)Under the faint moonlight, Kim Suho was walking alone to his dorm room. As he walked along the dark road, he suddenly burst into laughter.The fight he just had flashed before his eyes. He was flown away helplessly when he was only an inch away from Kim Hajin. Even now, he was unable to understand what attacked him.Was it a physical attack or an instantaneous emission of magic power? In either case, a mysterious force had struck him away from the battlefield, and Kim Hajin was able to deal a valid blow.\u2018\u2026I thought I was the only one hiding my power.\u2019Abnormally high strength would undoubtedly attract unwanted suspicion. As such, Kim Suho had only revealed enough of his power to maintain first place rank in Cube. He was hiding his power for himself, and the only reason he maintained first place was for his family.\u2018So there was someone else thinking the same thing as me.\u2019Kim Suho didn\u2019t go easy in his fight with Kim Hajin. Still, Kim Hajin managed to avoid his attacks with strange movements. Even now, Kim Suho felt that Kim Hajin\u2019s movements were completely mysterious.It was seemingly mindless and lacking in foundation.He seemed slow and full of openings, so much so that Kim Suho saw dozens of opportunities to attack. However, his attacks only grazed him or slashed through the air.Even when he thought it was over, Kim Hajin escaped his range with incomprehensible acrobatics. It seemed like an easy victory at first, but he couldn\u2019t close out the fight.He truly couldn\u2019t tell whether Kim Hajin was real or fake.It was flawlessness masked as weakness.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dAt that moment, Kim Suho heard the sound of a sword cutting through wind. He could even hear a small, clenched shout. The sound was coming from the park near the dorm. Curious, he headed over, whereupon he saw a girl swinging a sword.It was Chae Nayun.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hyak!\u201dStartled, Chae Nayun threw the sword she was swinging. The sword flew like a baseball bat and struck a dorm window. Thankfully, the window didn\u2019t break, but the cadet inside seemed to have woken up as the lights came on.\u201cWh, what!\u201d\u201cWhy are you so surprised?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun glared at the sudden uninvited guest. Kim Suho smirked and asked.\u201cWere you doing sword practice?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just stamina training.\u201dChae Nayun unleashed magic power. The sword flew back into her hand following her magic power.Chae Nayun dusted off the dirt on her sword and pointed it at Kim Suho.\u201cWhere are you coming back from?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dKim Suho answered honestly.\u201cI met with Kim Hajin.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cKim Hajin?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201c\u2026What for?\u201dChae Nayun asked as she tucked her hair behind her ears, pretending to be unconcerned. Seeing this, Kim Suho had a mischievous thought.\u201cWe were talking about you.\u201d\u201cWha, wha, what. Bu, bullshit.\u201dShe reacted rather strongly. Her face flushed all the way to her ears, and her hands and feet couldn\u2019t stay still. Kim Suho shook his head while laughing.\u201cIt was a joke. We sparred.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sparred? You and Kim Hajin?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWho won? No, you must have won. But why?\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t need to know that.\u201dChae Nayun stared at Kim Suho sourly. Then, she turned around and began to focus on her sword practice again.Whish. Whish.She swung her sword, but she was putting in too much strength.Kim Suho stepped in, unable to bear watching it.\u201cYou can\u2019t hold a sword like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026What.\u201d\u201cIf you put that much strength into your grip, you won\u2019t be able to cut what you should be able to.\u201dKim Suho pulled out a wooden sword and gave a demonstration. He didn\u2019t grip his sword tightly. He held it lightly yet firmly enough so that he could change his grip at any moment.Kim Suho swung his sword as a demonstration, drawing a clear sword wind in the air. The sword wind touched Chae Nayun\u2019s hair and scattered.Chae Nayun\u2019s unenthusiastic attitude took an immediate turn. She carefully watched Kim Suho\u2019s grip and copied him.\u201c\u2026Like, like this?\u201dThe lesson she suddenly started with Kim Suho continued until midnight.**When Chae Nayun returned to her dorm room, she immediately made a video call to Hazuki. It was to tell her about the team she decided on.She made Hazuki the vice-leader and selected an average supporter and sharpshooter in addition.Two warriors, one support, one sharpshooter, one magician.As the magician was from the upper ranks of Seoul Magic Academy, it was a well-balanced team. Furthermore, Chae Nayun could act as both a warrior and a sharpshooter, making her team even more flexible. Her team wasn\u2019t just decent, it was undoubtedly one of the best.\u2014Ah\u2026 then is Hajin-ssi not joining us?However, in the holographic video call, Hazuki murmured regretfully.\u201cUh, well, I can bring him if I wanted, but then I\u2019d feel bad for Rachel\u2019s team. Other than Rachel, everyone on that team is only average.\u201dConscientiously, Chae Nayun replied with a loud voice.Just like she said, without Rachel and Kim Hajin, Team Rachel wasn\u2019t particularly outstanding. First, their team had three warriors and no supporter, and the magician named Tomer was below average as well.\u2014But\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s not think about them. I\u2019m going to submit the team list like this, okay?\u201d\u2014Y-Yes.Just like that, Team Chae Nayun was confirmed.Chae Nayun hung up the call and jumped on her bed.It was time to sleep, but she wasn\u2019t sleepy.Frankly, she was frustrated and annoyed. If she knew this would happen, she would have asked Kim Hajin much earlier. That way, they would have been able to obtain a good score in theory too. Because she kept hesitating, he ended up being taken away by Rachel.\u201c\u2026Am I going to lose again?\u201dShe could still remember her defeat during the midterm. The result of her duel with Rachel was perhaps a decisive reason she switched to the sword.Chae Nayun, who was recalling this bad memory under the blanket, suddenly shot up. She simply couldn\u2019t fall asleep.Without a choice, she picked up a helmet lying next to her bed. To relieve stress in this late hour, playing games was the only option.[Gladiator of the Century]It was a famous virtual reality game whose competitive scene was frequently on public broadcasts.Because it helped with image training, it was enjoyed by many Heroes and cadets all over the world. With its popularity, the rank 1 player of each season was naturally at the center of media attention.[Nayunjajangman][98 wins 17 losses]Her dazzling win rate was something Chae Nayun was very proud of.\u201cHm.\u201dUnranked matches were better than ranked matches for relieving stress.Chae Nayun rolled her eyes as she searched for an opponent. Soon, she found someone suitable.The player\u2019s nickname was Extra7. He was in platinum league with 43 wins and 43 losses.It seemed like an easy victory.[You asked Extra7 for a duel.][Extra7 has accepted your duel.]\u201cOho, this guy is quite bold.\u201dChae Nayun grinned as she focused on virtual reality.There were no stats or items in this game. Only battle sense and superior control determined victory or defeat.[Start!]The duel began. Chae Nayun wanted to take things slow and test the waters. However, the opponent was unexpectedly reckless. Before she could adapt to his sudden attack, her character floated up and was torn apart by a series of consecutive strikes. By the time she knew what happened, her vision had turned red.\u201cEh, what? A-Ah!\u201dShe tried to take things more seriously, but her HP was too low.\u2026In the end, she lost after just three minutes since the start of the duel.[Defeat]Chae Nayun stared at this word blankly, then frowned.\u201cArgh, this sly piece of crap!\u201d*[Victory]I won again. I was currently playing a game called [Gladiator of the Century]. It was quite realistic, both in terms of graphics and movements, so I\u2019ve been playing it recently as a way to image train.\u201cSo, it works on this too.\u201dThe number 37 was engraved on the console helmet. It meant Random Consolidation System was active.===[Random Consolidation System][Low rank] [Spirit attribute]\u2026\u2014Random Consolidation*Consolidates the \u2018concept\u2019 of the scanned equipment by 1~44%.

It was 37% numerically, but I felt like it was a bigger increase.\u201cI won seven times in a row.\u201dThanks to my new Gift, I ended up defeating a 98-win-17-loss veteran seven times in a row. Of course, it was an unranked match, so it didn\u2019t really impact my ranked stats.[Nayunjajangman requests a rematch.][Nayunjajangman requests a rematch.][Nayunjajangman requests a rematch.]\u201cThis kid sure is tenacious\u2026. Well too bad for you, I have to sleep now.\u201dI turned the game off and put the helmet away. Suddenly, I caught sight of Evandel in the corner of my eyes.\u201cYummy. So yummy.\u201dShe was asleep when I got home, but she woke up when I started to play Gladiator of the Century, and now she was fully awake and munching on cake.The huge cake I brought had been reduced by half. Was she allowed to eat that much? I was a bit worried.After watching Evandel for a bit, I confiscated the cake.\u201cAh, aan! W-What ish it!\u201d\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s save the rest of it for later.\u201d\u201cWhy, why!?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good for your health.\u201dEvandel hopped up to try and grab the cake. However, I was coldhearted. I put the cake away on the topmost shelf in the fridge.Realizing that it was away from her reach, Evandel placed her hands by her waist and frowned. It was almost as if she was disgruntled with the whole world.\u201cI want more! I want more!\u201dShe even learned to complain\u2026.I placed my index finger over my mouth.\u201cShh. You should only eat a little snack after meals. Also, you can\u2019t be loud at night.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dAlthough she quieted down at my warning, her tiny hands were trembling. Without any other choice, I held up Evandel.\u201cTomorrow, you can eat the rest of it tomorrow, okay? I\u2019ll buy even more delicious food tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cOf course. Have you seen me not keep a promise?\u201dWhen I stroked her head, she finally seemed to have been appeased.Not long afterward, Evandel fell asleep, and I placed her on my bed.When I checked my smartwatch afterward, I noticed that Kim Suho had sent me a message two hours ago.[Second week of August, Friday. Let\u2019s meet then.]\u201c\u2026Whew.\u201d===[Cadet Jacket]A jacket created by Cube.\u2014Trap Transformation*When someone steps on this jacket, an unknown force will strongly push the person off.*This effect lasts for 10 minutes and will disappear after one activation.===It seemed he recognized my skill. It was all thanks to the cadet jacket I modified. Kim Suho didn\u2019t seem to suspect anything either. Of course, it was his jacket, so there was no reason for him to suspect it.Moreover, it was an \u2018unknown force\u2019 that pushed him. Kim Suho would never figure out what had done him in.**Wednesday.It was the first class since the team formation, a combat training called \u2018Dungeon Investigation\u2019.Normally, when Heroes find a Dungeon, they would dispatch an advance party first in order to get a rough idea of what\u2019s inside the Dungeon. In this combat training, cadets would act as this advance party.\u201cAh, it\u2019s so cold.\u201d\u201cAuuu, aren\u2019t you cold, Hajin?\u201dMy team was currently inside a Dungeon that was covered in ice. The five of us shivered in the cold as we walked onward.After about 20 minutes, the road suddenly forked into five branches.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dTomer suddenly pointed at the rightmost path. I opened my eyes wide and stared at the direction Tomer pointed. As expected, there was a trap there.\u201cNo, that\u2019s the wrong place.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, it isn\u2019t.\u201dTomer was purposely leading us into a trap. I didn\u2019t think there was a Djinn waiting to ambush us, but she must have a set some sort of a life-threatening trap.\u201cIn a Dungeon Investigation, it\u2019s common sense to listen to your sharpshooter.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTomer stared at Rachel. Too bad for her, Rachel was also on my side.\u201cLet\u2019s go as Hajin-ssi says.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t regret it later.\u201dTomer was a sore loser.\u201cThere\u2019s a yeti up ahead.\u201dA yeti was sleeping in the pathway I chose.The Dungeon\u2019s first monster, yeti.We advanced forward, keeping our guard up.After that, Tomer continued to try to lead us, especially Rachel, into a trap. However, I was always there to prevent her.\u201cGuys, I think it\u2019s this way, for real this time. If you see the traces of ice around there\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cNo, trust me just this once. Rachel-ssi, come with me. Wouldn\u2019t it be more efficient to split into two groups?\u201d\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201dI had to commend her for her constant effort, but that didn\u2019t mean I could let her do as she pleased. I grabbed Rachel by her wrist, and she followed me silently.As time passed, Tomer\u2019s expression grew more and more irritated.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dMy Thousand-Mile Eyes found the shortest path in this maze-like Ice Dungeon. There were no obstructions and no difficulties.By the time we caught a glimpse of the instructor waiting at the exit, Rachel spoke uncomfortably.\u201cUm\u2026 Hajin-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026.\u201dRachel glanced at her wrist. I was holding onto her, thinking Tomer might take her away.\u201cOh right, sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to be\u2026.\u201d\u201cTeam Rachel!\u201dThe instructor spotted us and shouted in a thunderous voice. We hurriedly ran up and stood in front of him.\u201cYour findings?\u201d\u201cYes. A yeti, snowbeast, white calamity, white drake\u2026.\u201dRachel recited the result of the investigation. The instructor listened quietly and compared the findings with a list. Then, a faint smile appeared on his face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBased on the rank of the monsters distributed in the Dungeon, the Dungeon\u2019s boss is likely to be at least intermediate rank grade 3.\u201d\u201cGood.

Teamwork (3)\u201cEhew.\u201dAfter returning to the magicians\u2019 dorm, Tomer let out a deep sigh.[Tomer, why is the mission being delayed? Are there other variables?]Her boss sent her a grumpy message.Tomer\u2019s mission was to injure or weaken Rachel. She only had to make Rachel take a break from her usual daily life for a bit.With the cooperation from Djinns acting as spies in Cube\u2019s executives, she thought she could quickly take care of this mission and go back, but there was a constant heckler obstructing her.\u201cDo I have to take care of him first\u2026?\u201dNowadays, she felt sour just seeing Kim Hajin\u2019s face. Every time she tried to do something, he seemingly appeared out of nowhere and foiled her plans. Whether it was before class, during class, or after class, Kim Hajin refused to leave Rachel\u2019s side.\u201cTsk, can\u2019t he know his place?\u201dTomer simply couldn\u2019t understand how a rank 334 cadet had the gall to act so straightforward. She already investigated his background, and he didn\u2019t even have parents, much less a proper backing. Did he really believe that he could win a beauty\u2019s heart just with courage?\u201c\u2026Wait.\u201dA flash of insight sparked in Tomer\u2019s head.Kim Hajin had strong feelings for Rachel. Tomer was sure of it. However, although she didn\u2019t openly show it, Rachel was undoubtedly uncomfortable with his advances.He was trying to make a move one-sidedly.There were many ways to spread malicious rumors. You could bad-mouth someone behind their back, or you could exaggerate rumors that were already present.But for now, there was no need for such complicated schemes.She just had to say things as she saw them, albeit exaggerating things a little.To do that\u2026 she would have to first get close to Kim Hajin and Rachel\u2026 no, to the entire team.Tomer messaged her boss.[Is the mission really just to separate this girl?][That\u2019s right. Afterward, the agent we dispatched will take care of the rest.]\u2018Good, it\u2019s time for a change of plans.\u2019 Tomer laughed maniacally.It was then.Her smartwatch vibrated. The especially intense vibration signaled that it was from Violet Banquet. Tomer quickly turned on her smartwatch.[Truth Agency][We have accepted Jamie Jamer-ssi\u2019s request.]\u201cThey\u2019re replying now?\u201dShe had forgotten about Truth Agency because it was 2~3 weeks ago that she put in a request. She had assumed they were unreliable since they didn\u2019t answer.Did they just have too many clients?In any case, she was satisfied.As long as she could find out where that bastard was, she was happy to wait.**\u201cNext week, each team will select a small-scale Dungeon and do a presentation on the best way to conquer it.\u201dFriday\u2019s theory class \u2013 \u2018Phenomenon Realm Analysis II\u2019.Just before the class ended, the professor gave the cadets their team assignments. Cadets immediately broke out into groans. However, Jin Hoseung and Yi Bokgyu, who were sitting in front of me, didn\u2019t seem all that worried. They turned around, looking at me happily.\u201cWe believe in you, Hajin.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just them.Other cadets were also looking this way with envious eyes.\u201cHave a good weekend.\u201dWith that, the professor left the classroom. Members of Team Rachel, including myself, got up.\u201cGuys, there\u2019s a team leader meeting next Wednesday. Don\u2019t forget to come to the auditorium if you\u2019re a team leader.\u201dAt that moment, the class president, Yi Yeonghan, loudly shouted. I looked at Rachel, who was putting her writing utensils away, and our eyes met.I spoke.\u201cFor today, let\u2019s go to the caf\u00e9 and just divide up the work.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t Rachel\u2019s voice. I turned my gaze to the side. It was Tomer.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the caf\u00e9.\u201dTomer had a very bright face.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Everyone, Rachel-ssi, let\u2019s go. We don\u2019t have time.\u201dTomer stepped in and began to urge other team members. I stared at her with a daze. What was she scheming this time? Did she have a nuclear bomb set up at the caf\u00e9?\u202610 minutes later.We arrived at the caf\u00e9.I tried peering through the roof and ground, but I couldn\u2019t find any traps in the caf\u00e9. Although I was still suspicious, I started dividing up the work among others.\u201cHoseung and Bokgyu can look up the data on the Dungeon. Jamer and Rachel-ssi can calculate the mana density.\u201dThat was the result of our 30-minute discussion.They would send their results to me, then I would assemble everything together into a presentable PowerPoint.\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dThe team members agreed with a bright face.When I was about to grab my bag and leave, Rachel suddenly grabbed my sleeve.\u201cUm, Hajin-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the English Royal Court contact you?\u201d\u201cEh? \u2026Um, what contact?\u201dAt that moment, Rachel slightly furrowed her brows.\u201cUm, the English Royal Court guild\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dI tilted my head. Although I didn\u2019t remember something like that, I checked my email just in case. There were 1097 unread emails. I tried searching for the phrase \u2018royal court\u2019.I found one email.\u201cAh, they emailed me. Sorry, I don\u2019t check my email that often.\u201d\u201cThey\u2026 emailed you?\u201dI didn\u2019t know why, but Rachel seemed to be a bit angry as her lips stuck out in a pout.\u201cTry reading it when you go home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just read it now.\u201dI clicked on the email. Just like Rachel said, the English Royal Court guild had contacted me. It was written in Korean, so I had no trouble reading it.A 100 million won salary with additional benefits.It wasn\u2019t a particularly good condition for a pre-contract.\u201cCan I take a look?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dRachel peeked her head in and checked the content of the email. Her eyes moved around busily, then she frowned strongly.\u201cWhat kind of a contract is\u2026 nevermind, don\u2019t read this.\u201dRachel stood up, fuming. Then, she hurriedly rushed out of the caf\u00e9. She had the angriest face I\u2019ve seen since I entered Cube.\u201c\u2026What, why is she so mad?\u201dThe rest of the team members watched her leave in a daze.**Sunday night, a time I set out for the sake of my sanity.I was currently focused on playing a game.[Victory]I won once again.[Nim][1][Yes?][How did you do that combo just now?]The loser, Nayunjajangman, messaged me.We became friends since we played on Wednesday. Because we were logged on around the same time, we\u2019ve been playing against each other often. Thankfully, Random Consolidation System gave me numbers like 37, 40, 39, so I haven\u2019t lost a single game.[You must stay calm.][How are you so good? Are you an active Hero??][No, not at all.]Strengthening of concept. It increased understanding of what combo to use and what combo was most efficient, boosting even the sense of time and movement within the game. Although my skills would vary depending on what number I rolled, I was undoubtedly worthy to be called an expert.[By the way, why is your ranked match stats 43 wins and 43 losses?? Did you lose on purpose?][Yes, because I didn\u2019t want to be someone who was intensely attached to mere numbers.]I lied without even batting an eye.[Ah\u2026 I see. You\u2019re amazing. I can\u2019t sleep properly if I lose a ranked match. Do you log on around this time every day?][Yes.][Can I ask you to teach me a move or two around this time?]I couldn\u2019t help but smile. He was surprisingly polite.[Gladly. But I\u2019ll be going offline now. I must go work out.][Oh! \u314b\u314b I was about to go work out too \u314b\u314b Jinx!]I didn\u2019t reply to him and just put my helmet down.I carefully opened the door so as to not awake Evandel.Then, I headed to the Fitness Center.After about five minutes of walking, I arrived.When I came out of the changing room in my sportswear, I ran into Chae Nayun who was also entering the Fitness Center.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re here to work out too?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright, work hard.\u201dChae Nayun walked past me into the girl\u2019s changing room. I then headed to the treadmill without much thought. Suddenly, a thought flashed through my head.Nayunjajangman.Nayun. Chae Nayun.\u201cMm\u2026 no way, right?\u201dIt was unlikely. In the first place, Chae Nayun didn\u2019t like jajangmyeon[2]\u00a0that much. There was no reason she would use it as her ID. Not to mention, Nayunjajangman spoke like a man.Beep\u2014I set the treadmill speed to 20km. I wouldn\u2019t have even imagined it in the past, but now it wasn\u2019t so difficult.For the next 30 minutes, I ran on the treadmill. By the time I got off, I was soaked with my own sweat.\u201cHuu\u2026.\u201dI took out a sports drink from the fridge.Chae Nayun, who just got out of the gravitation room, slowly came up next to me.\u201cHey.\u201dI stared at Chae Nayun silently. She fidgeted around, trying to buy time.\u201cWhat? Say something.\u201d\u201c\u2026You see, my team got the Hongcheon Mantis Dungeon.\u201dIt seemed Chae Nayun was worried about her team challenge. A Mantis Dungeon\u2026. She ended up taking an insect Dungeon, which was one of the trickiest out of all Dungeons.\u201cDo, do you know anything about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026How did you choose the most difficult one?\u201d\u201cI know right? The annoying magician in my team kept telling me to choose it.\u201dThe magician in Chae Nayun\u2019s team was Oh Junsik. He was recorded in my settings book. Although he was skilled, he was a bit of an ass. Because his aunt was a 7-star magician, he probably wouldn\u2019t bend down to Chae Nayun either.\u201cHe probably thought that he could get bonus points with a difficult assignment. But he\u2019s probably going to be sloppy in his presentation. He\u2019s going to stutter and make you facepalm.\u201d\u201cI know, I was willing to overlook it, but now\u2026 Ehew, I\u2019ve never met someone who is more headstrong than me.\u201dAt least she knew she was headstrong.\u201cIf possible, let someone else do the presentation. Unexpectedly, Hazuki seems to be a good choice.\u201d\u201cI want to, but I doubt that bastard will agree\u2026 Kuhum.\u201dSuddenly, the atmosphere turned awkward. We both distanced ourselves as though we remembered our relationship. After all, we weren\u2019t friends who could chat so amicably.\u201c\u2026H-Have fun exercising. I\u2019m going back to the gravitation room.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah, I\u2019ll go lift some weights.\u201d**August 12th, Tuesday, dusk.In an empty park, a sharp sword swinging sound resonated through the area.\u201cHey, didn\u2019t I get better?\u201dChae Nayun, who was just wielding a sword, asked with a bright face. Kim Suho nodded with a laugh.\u201cYeah, you stopped closing your eyes.\u201dOnly seven days had passed since Kim Suho started acting as Chae Nayun\u2019s teacher.Chae Nayun was certainly growing at an incredible pace. Her biggest achievement was that she stopped fearing close ranged attacks to a certain extent.\u201cI think playing that game really helped me.\u201d\u201cGame?\u201dKim Suho asked as he tilted his head.\u201cYeah, I met someone who\u2019s even better than you. A super expert who only does close ranged combat.\u201d\u201cAh~ Gladiator of the Century? But you don\u2019t move your body in that game.\u201dGladiator of the Century used brainwaves and iris-movements as control. Of course, you could play it with a keyboard and a mouse, but that would significantly slow down your reaction time.\u201cYeah, but an ordinary person would never be able to do what he does. He\u2019s my mentor!\u201d\u201cOh, he must really be an expert then.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s mentor. It meant that the prideful Chae Nayun had acknowledged him to be superior.\u201cYeah, he has a great personality too. He apparently matches his win-loss ratio because he doesn\u2019t want to be intensely attached to mere numbers. Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201dMost people played ranked matches to win, resulting in a rather boring match. Each side would first test out the waters with small maneuvers, and the outcome of the battle would end up being determined by which side dealt more effective blows. It was kind of like a boxing match, except that it was rare for one side to be KO\u2019ed.However, Extra7 was different. He charged at you directly and almost recklessly. Each of his movements were potentially lethal, helping Chae Nayun get over her fear of close ranged combat.\u201cIf he\u2019s that good, he must be an active Hero, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I asked him, and he said\u2026 Eh?\u201dIt was then.A man appeared in the distance wearing flip-flops.It was Kim Hajin.\u201cOh look, Kim Hajin\u2019s here.\u201dThis didn\u2019t surprise Chae Nayun. Kim Suho had already told her that Kim Hajin was coming to talk to him and that he could only teach her until Kim Hajin came.\u201cHm? Oh, you\u2019re right. Then I\u2019ll be going now.\u201dKim Suho got up.\u201cYeah, take care.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t overwork yourself either, okay?\u201dChae Nayun watched Kim Suho walking up to Kim Hajin.It felt like they had gotten close recently. But how?\u2018Now that I think about it, Kim Suho jokingly said they talked about me. Was it because of me\u2026?\u2019Kim Suho and Kim Hajin walked off, chatting together. Chae Nayun strained her ears.\u2014How\u2019s your condition?This was Kim Hajin\u2019s voice.\u2014Pretty good.That was Kim Suho\u2019s.\u2014Don\u2019t overwork yourself. Friday\u2019s right around the corner.\u2014Of course.\u2014Oh, and how\u2019s Chae Nayun?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt that moment, Chae Nayun\u2019s heart dropped a beat.This was the most important part, but they were now too far for her to listen in.\u201c\u2026The heck.\u201dChae Nayun stared at them with a complex mix of emotions in her eyes.1. \u201cnim\u201d is the respectful way of addressing people online.2.

Scout (1)I came to a rice soup restaurant[1]. Cube had all sorts of restaurants, but this place, Grandma\u2019s Home Flavor, was the only rice soup restaurant that ran 24/7.\u201c\u2026.\u201dSeeing Kim Suho eating a bowl of rice soup, I became lost in thought.Kim Suho\u2019s current power was at least at the level of an intermediate rank Hero. This world still had many hidden pieces that I set up left undiscovered.Among these, there were some that would fall into antagonists\u2019 hands. Items like the \u2018Lucifer\u2019s Feather\u2019 and the \u2018Snaketooth of Beginning\u2019 were things that I wouldn\u2019t dare to try to obtain, but with Kim Suho\u2019s assistance, I might be able to stop them from falling into antagonists\u2019 hands.\u2026Thinking about it this way, Kim Suho suddenly became a lot more attractive.I stared fixedly at Kim Suho. He looked like a main character no matter how I looked at him. The rice soup must be delicious as he didn\u2019t notice that a grain of rice was stuck next to his mouth.\u201cYou have a grain of rice stuck there.\u201dI took out a few sheets of tissues and took off the grain of rice.\u201cAh, thanks.\u201dKim Suho spoke with a thin smile.\u201cBy the way, are you going to do the powerpoint presentation for your class?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you nervous? I would be.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll eat a serenity pill before it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d[2]I learned long ago that it was foolish to be obstinate about eating medicine. Although I quit college to focus on writing, I still attended until I was a sophomore. I\u2019ve been in 4~5 group projects as well, so I was fairly experienced with presentations.I also planned on investing some SP into the serenity pill, not necessarily for me, but for Rachel and my other teammates, who had high expectations of me.If I also add an increased eloquence and persuasiveness effect on the hornflute, it should be a breeze to ace the presentation.I asked Kim Suho.\u201cAnyways, the Dungeon is near Suwon, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, we should be careful.\u201dSuwon was the most dangerous area of the three capital areas: Seoul, Suwon, and Incheon. During Outcall, Suwon went through a bizarre terraforming, turning more than half of the region into a horrifying mountain zone.Because of this, the west side of Suwon was completely off-limits to the public. Kamak Mountain, which was our destination, was just at the border of this restricted zone.It was then.The restaurant\u2019s door opened, and someone clad entirely in black walked in. A big hat, a black mask, and a long, full-body coat. This person could easily be mistaken for a criminal.\u201cUm, I just called\u2026\u201dThe woman clad in black notified the staff in a soft voice. She then glanced at Kim Suho and me, who were the only other customers in the restaurant. Immediately, her shoulders trembled violently.\u201cAh yes, wait just one moment.\u201dThe staff went into the kitchen. I smirked and turned to the woman. She was frozen like a statue.\u201cOh, who\u2019s this?\u201dI suddenly remembered. Along with hamburgers, rice soup was one of her favorite dishes.\u201cYo, Yoo Yeonha.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe was desperately pretending to not have heard my crystal-clear exclamation. Seeing that she wasn\u2019t running away, she must still want the rice soup she ordered.I got up and approached her.\u201cSince you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you join us?\u201d\u201cY-Yes? Who, who might you be? I don\u2019t know anyone like you\u2026\u201dShe was desperately trying to sound different, but it was too obvious.\u201cEh? Yoo Yeonha? You\u2019re Yoo Yeonha?\u201dKim Suho also responded. Then, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s eyes began to tear up under her big hat.\u201cN-No, no, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t know anyone by that name\u2026.\u201d\u201cHere you go.\u201dThe staff then came out and handed her a packaged rice soup. Yoo Yeonha quickly snatched it out of her hands before running off.\u201cA-Ah, wait! You need to pay for that!\u201dThe staff shouted at her, but Yoo Yeonha disappeared like the wind. Then, the staff\u2019s gaze slowly turned towards me.Without any other choice, I took out my card.\u201cI\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you~\u201dFor the record, for the next three days\u2026Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t even meet my eyes.**Friday, the day of Phenomenon Realm Analysis team challenge presentation.Currently, Chae Nayun was in a terrible mood.Her team had been the first team to present. The result was a disaster, even by Chae Nayun\u2019s standards.Just like Kim Hajin said, Oh Junsik insisted on doing the presentation, stuttering throughout and messing up the entire powerpoint.\u201c\u2026Ah, I was too nervous. Sorry, I\u2019ll be better next time.\u201dThat was what he said afterwards. Chae Nayun wanted to smack his head, but she held herself back since class was still going on.\u201cNext team.\u201dNext up was Team Rachel. A man sitting in front of Chae Nayun got up. It was Kim Hajin.Wearing a pair of round glasses, he got up on the podium.\u201cHello, I am from Team 3. Our Dungeon was the Walsin Dungeon. This Dungeon existed on the foot of Gangwondo Snow Mountain, but because the guild in charge of it, the Desolate Moon guild, hasn\u2019t released any information on the result\u2026.\u201dKim Hajin\u2019s presentation was smooth. His voice was soft, and he didn\u2019t seem nervous. He first introduced the information gathered by his team, and then estimated the Dungeon\u2019s internal structure using calculations. He even had a cross-sectional map prepared.Chae Nayun stared at Kim Hajin\u2019s presentation in a daze, her chin sitting on her hand. His voice was slightly different, and a sense of ease was carried in his occasional smiles. Together with his round glasses, it was as if he was giving the class a lecture.A smart guy was surprisingly cool.\u201cWait, I have a question.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow can you estimate the counterflow of magic power with such a small amount of data?\u201dAt that moment, the professor interrupted him and asked a question.\u201cAh, about that, if you look at the calculations here\u2026.\u201dHowever, Kim Hajin answered the professor just as smoothly as he always had. Seeing this intellectual side of him, Chae Nayun fell into a trance. With Kim Hajin\u2019s answer, the professor backed down with a satisfied smile, and the presentation soon concluded.\u201cThat\u2019s it for our team\u2019s presentation.\u201dKim Hajin finished his presentation as he pushed his glasses up.Afterwards, he returned to his seat, which was next to Rachel\u2019s. Chae Nayun stared at Rachel half in regret, half in envy. Rachel and Kim Hajin smiled and gave each other a high-five.*After the class ended, I was returning to the dorms with Rachel.Tomer and other team members strongly asked for a celebratory afterparty, but Rachel and I didn\u2019t participate. I had another appointment, and Rachel just had a reserved personality.We walked together talking about today\u2019s team challenge. About how Chae Nayun\u2019s team bombed the presentation, about how Shin Jonghak made his presentation so intimidating\u2026\u201c\u2026Oh right, here.\u201dWhen we reached the crossroad to Dorm 1 and Dorm 2, Rachel handed me a piece of paper.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cAre you perhaps interested in the English Royal Court guild?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dBefore I could give a proper answer, Rachel continued speaking.\u201cIn truth, I asked the Royal Court guild to contact Hajin-ssi, but it seems they assumed things on their own by looking at Hajin-ssi\u2019s rank.\u201dHearing that, I looked at the paper she gave me. It was a contract. Indeed, it had better conditions than the one I saw in the email. If I was still on Earth, I never would have imagined such a treatment.\u201c\u2026Please consider it.\u201dRachel gave a light bow, then turned and walked to the right.I watched her leave quietly.**After playing with Evandel for about 30 minutes, I headed to a bus stop near Suwon Station, where I promised to meet Kim Suho.Kim Suho had arrived long ago and was waiting for me.\u201cHey Hajin, your presentation was amazing.\u201dKim Suho was wearing light clothing. He was currently low on money, so I volunteered to take care of food and equipment.\u201cEveryone was full of praises for you.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? Well more importantly, which way should we be going?\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201dKim Suho took the lead, and I followed.Not long afterwards, we arrived at Kamak Mountain.We then hiked deep into the mountain. Because powerful beast-type monsters lived in Kamak Mountain, we were both on the lookout to avoid them.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201dFinally, we arrived at a dead end. Kim Suho pointed at the wall in front of us, which was covered in moss and vines.\u201c\u2026So this is why it hasn\u2019t been discovered until now.\u201dEven if you knew it was there, it would have been hard to find it. Not only was it covered in all sorts of vegetation, the entrance was narrow. At first glance, it only looked like a tiny gap.\u201cOnce we go in, it won\u2019t be easy to escape. Are you prepared?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI took out the Desert Eagle from my pocket.\u201cThis is pretty strong.\u201dI even prepared a light bullet just in case. Swordsman of Destruction should be a high-intermediate rank monster. The difference between intermediate rank and high-intermediate rank was immense. Even this light bullet, which cost 70 SP to make, would likely only distract it for a moment. However, a moment of distraction was enough. Kim Suho would take care of the rest.\u201cThen let\u2019s go in.\u201dKim Suho and I jumped into the narrow gap. The gap widened as we walked, eventually becoming big enough to be a tunnel.The inside of the Dungeon was covered by dense darkness. Instead of turning on a flashlight, I grabbed Kim Suho\u2019s hand and guided him. Shining light unnecessarily could provoke spirit monsters.\u201cIt\u2019s kinda creepy.\u201d\u201cTell me about it\u2026. Hold on.\u201dI suddenly stopped and widened my eyes.There was another pathway on the other side. If we started from the right side, it meant there was another entrance from the left. Was it like this in the original story? No, I didn\u2019t think so.Two people were walking forward from the pathway.\u2014Where is this?\u2014A hidden stage I\u2019m guessing?I couldn\u2019t tell who they were from their faces, but considering the feeling I got from them and the tattoos on their faces, they didn\u2019t look like kind people.\u201c\u2026Wait, stay quiet for a moment.\u201dI quickly checked my laptop using my smartwatch.There was an alert, just as I expected.[Criticism \u2013 Kamak Mountain Dungeon, which Kim Suho conquers, is too small considering its reward.][Solution \u2013 Made Kamak Mountain Dungeon a hidden stage in Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest.]In other words, Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest became connected to Kamak Mountain Dungeon.Coincidentally, today was August 14th, the day Packhorse Master would conquer Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest. In that case, those two guys should be Djinns from Packhorse Master.\u201cWhy?\u201dKim Suho whispered.I clenched my teeth. Packhorse Master\u2019s Djinns were fairly powerful Djinns. They were disguised as Heroes, being at least intermediate rank in power. Even Kim Suho would have trouble dealing with them.\u201cThere are other people in here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Damn.\u201dFor now, I closely watched their movements as I eavesdropped on their conversation.\u2014Let\u2019s go back first. Rather than arguing with the rest about what we got out of the hidden stage, it\u2019ll be better to conquer it together.\u2014\u2026Yeah, you\u2019re right.Thankfully, they went back after confirming the hidden stage\u2019s location.\u201cLet\u2019s finish this fast.\u201dI concentrated magic power on my Thousand-Mile Eyes. In an instant, my vision expanded, and the Dungeon\u2019s internal structure entered my sight.The Swordsman of Destruction\u2019s location\u2026Straight, then two turns to the right. The Swordsman of Destruction was sleeping inside the boss room.*[Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest]A medium-scale Dungeon located in the valley of Suwon Mountain Range. By the time this Dungeon was close to being completely conquered, the owner of Chameleon Troupe\u2019s seat of Blue, an African-American man named Khalifa, looked around at the members of Packhorse Master. He had infiltrated the Packhorse Master guild.Seven of the nine members who participated in the Dungeon raid was sitting on the ground, collecting their breaths.\u201cJames, Johong, did you find something?\u201dThe guild master contacted the group\u2019s two scouts with a communication device.\u2014Yes, we discovered a hidden path. It seems to be a hidden stage.\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dKhalifa quietly listened in on their conversation.\u2014We\u2019re currently on our way back. We can conquer it together.\u201cNo, we\u2019ll go there. You guys can continue your investigation.\u201d\u2014Yes, understood.\u201cYou hear that guys? It\u2019s time to get up!\u201dThey were currently missing two men.In that case, now was the best time.Khalifa tapped his ears, transmitting a signal. Then, he unleashed his magic power in the shape of a door.Phase Shift. It was an ability that connected one space to another, so long as it was not too far apart. Naturally, this was part of Khalifa\u2019s Gift.\u201cCullen, what are you doing? Who told you to open a Portal?\u201dAlthough it had a few differences from a Portal, because it looked like one, almost everyone mistook it for an artificial Portal. Khalifa didn\u2019t go through the trouble to correct them.\u201c\u2026Cullen, close the Portal.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKhalifa silently put on a pair of sunglasses.\u201cCULLEN!\u201dAnnoyed by the guild master\u2019s loud shouting, he even put on earplugs.\u201cYou son of a bitch\u2026.\u201dEnraged, the guild master walked up to the Portal.It was then.A black blade shot out from the Portal.The blade cleanly severed him in two. Without even having to ask, the guild master was dead. Immediately, the guild master scattered into black dust.\u2026A thick silence descended.The group\u2019s leader had been killed by a single blow. Other Djinns simply stared into the Portal. They couldn\u2019t bring themselves to move or even speak.Soon, a woman walked out of the Portal.She had an average height, but a beautiful appearance. When the Djinns met her eyes, their consciousness was sucked into a deep abyss.One, two, three, four\u2026 six Djinns collapsed like lifeless dolls.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to keep one for the sake of stock price.\u201dBoss stared at Khalifa, murmuring in a cold voice. Khalifa grinned, then spoke.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Now then, should we go find the hidden stage?\u201d\u201cYou wait here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dKhalifa tilted his head. Boss retorted briefly.\u201cThe two people inside the hidden stage are candidates.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aha.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCandidates. They referred to individuals selected by Boss and the members of the Chameleon Troupe to have the qualification of becoming Chameleon Troupe\u2019s new color.\u201cIs it a\u2026 test?\u201dBoss liquified her body without answering Khalifa. In an instant, her body turned into a black liquid and stuck to the ground. In that state, she moved quickly.1.

Scout (2)The path to the boss room was wrought with monsters. I didn\u2019t plan on letting Kim Suho take care of them. Since they were at the level that I could kill with my gun, I wanted to kill them and pretend that I helped.Currently, there were six ghouls in front of me. They were low-intermediate rank grade 9 undead monsters.I tightly gripped the Desert Eagle. Even in the pitch black darkness, its platinum exterior shone brightly. I aimed at the ghouls\u2019 swollen right eyes, where their tiny brains were located.I pulled the trigger without hesitation. Six bullets shot out simultaneously, piercing the ghouls\u2019 vital point. A blue light seemed to flash, then the ghouls collapsed.\u201cOh, as expected\u2026.\u201dKim Suho exclaimed in awe. However, I didn\u2019t have time to feel happy. I operated in the principle of Strong Against Weak, Weak Against Strong. Although I could slaughter an army of weaklings, I wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against a single expert. No, I would have to run away from someone even slightly above me.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry, we don\u2019t have time.\u201dWe ran through the cave. Monsters were around every corner, but because they were weak, it was easy to take care of them.After running for about ten minutes taking care of ghouls, zombies, and ghosts, we arrived in front of a giant stone wall.At first glance, it seemed like a dead end, but strange symbols were written on the wall.These symbols were an ancient language that only existed in Dungeons. Thanks to modern technology, an ancient language of this level could be translated using a smartwatch. That\u2019s what Kim Suho did in the original story as well.I took out my smartwatch and scanned the symbols on the wall.\u2014\u2018This\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019 always accompanies each other.\u2014Observed from a close distance, \u2018This\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019 feels simultaneous.\u2014But from afar, \u2018This\u2019 comes before \u2018That\u2019.\u2014What is \u2018This\u2019?Kim Suho glanced at my smartwatch and saw the riddle.\u201c\u2026Ah, it must be a riddle. I heard there are Dungeons like this.\u201dIn the original story, Kim Suho was unable to solve this riddle and had to text Yoo Yeonha for help. Yoo Yeonha contacted an information guild and got the answer in five minutes.However, I didn\u2019t have time to wait.This riddle was something I half-heartedly made. The answer was lightning. \u2018This\u2019 was lightning, and \u2018That\u2019 was thunder.Although lightning accompanies thunder, light traveled faster than sound, making lightning visible before hearing thunder.\u201cLightning.\u201dI muttered the answer, and the stone wall reacted. The symbols on the wall glowed with a blue light, then disappeared into particles of light. Immediately afterwards, the stone wall rumbled and sunk underground.\u201cWhat, the answer is lightning?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHow did you figure that out so fast? \u2026Wow, you really are a genius.\u201dKim Suho was looking at me like I was some kind of a sage.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how I found out later. For now, let\u2019s clear the Dungeon before anyone else arrives.\u201dI pushed Kim Suho into the boss room.**\u201c\u2026.\u201dBoss stared blankly at Kim Hajin walking into the boss room.To be completely honest, she was in awe. Decisiveness, drive, boldness, and even intelligence. Although it was a mere hidden stage, he had come this far in just 10 minutes. That was something ordinary people couldn\u2019t do.\u201cTruly extraordinary\u2026.\u201dShe blurted out subconsciously. She had heard the same words from her master, the previous boss of the Chameleon Troupe, who no longer existed in this world. She suddenly wondered, \u2018what did Master see in me to say that\u2026?\u2019She let out a deep sigh.With what happened today, she became certain. Kim Hajin was someone who she wanted by her side.But before that could become reality, he had to meet a few conditions. The most important condition was whether he could kill a human being without hesitation.\u2014Argh, it\u2019s a maze. Why is a hidden stage so complicated?\u2014Quiet.Boss looked far behind her. Two Djinns from Packhorse Master were wandering around.Kim Hajin didn\u2019t know they were Djinns.Since that was the case\u2026 she decided to make use of them.**In the middle of an empty cave lied a throne made of stone. Sitting on this throne was the Swordsman of Destruction, staring down at us. He was completely covered in black armor. His eyes oozed with boredom, as though he only just woke up from his sleep.However, in the next instant, the swordsman\u2019s eyes burned blue. He met Kim Suho\u2019s eyes and made a small smile.It seemed it was true that the strong could recognize each other.\u2014\u2026What an interesting kid.A chilling sound resounded. Kim Suho\u2019s face was frozen in nervousness. A monster capable of speaking human language signified that it wasn\u2019t ordinary. Even in reality, monsters high-intermediate rank and above had intelligence on par with humans. Though of course, talking was still limited to humanoid monsters.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Suho quietly took out his sword. I felt like I understood what he was thinking. After all, I had written it myself.\u300cHe emitted extraordinary hostility and spirit. I became certain that he was at least high-intermediate rank. At the same time, I began to worry. Would I be able to defeat him? Soon, I even began to feel afraid.However, when the Swordsman of Destruction pulled out his sword, an unknown sense of confidence surged within me.My Gift was Sword Saint. I was someone who would stand on the peak of swordsmanship.Against a swordsman opponent, there should be no reason for me to lose\u2026\u300d\u201cThere should be no reason for you to lose.\u201dI emphasized his last thought.Startled, Kim Suho stared at me.\u201cHis real body is his sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sword?\u201dKim Suho stared at the swordsman\u2019s sword. Crimson sword qi waved around his black blade.\u201cThe voice just now came from that sword. That body should just be a corpse.\u201dIn the original story, Kim Suho figured this out while exchanging blows with the Swordsman of Destruction. However, I couldn\u2019t wait for him to realize this on his own in a situation where intruders could arrive at any time.The Swordsman of Destruction slowly raised his sword.His blade vibrated, letting out a stiff voice.\u2014Come. It\u2019s been a while since I last obtained a body.Kim Suho stepped up. I also took out my gun.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to attack his body. Just hit the sword. I\u2019ll support you from the back.\u201d\u201c\u2026I trust you.\u201dNow, it was Kim Suho\u2019s turn. The sword he had in his hand should be a high rank sword which he even took out loans to buy. The magic power of a Sword Saint rose up clearly from this high-class sword.The Swordsman of Destruction made the first move, rashly rushing in and striking down with his sword. Kim Suho raised his sword and blocked him.KWANG!The two swords clashed. The Swordsman of Destruction pulled his sword back and repeatedly struck down. It was as if he wanted to break Kim Suho\u2019s sword.However, not even a single scratch appeared on Kim Suho\u2019s sword. Normally, it would have already been destroyed multiple times by the Swordsman of Destruction\u2019s strength and the density of his magic power. However, a Sword Saint\u2019s magic power couldn\u2019t fall to a mere metal.Watching them fight, I slowly raised my gun.I couldn\u2019t use a shotgun as it might injure Kim Suho.Using a sniper rifle in this close range would lower the accuracy.Without a choice, I selected the handgun.Clang. Kwang. Koong. Kwaaaang!Under the thunderous noise, I aimed my gun at the swordsman\u2019s shoulder. Then, at the instant that his sword clashed with Kim Suho\u2019s, I fired.Shuuuuu\u2014The light bullet shot forward, leaving a white trail behind it, then digging into the swordsman\u2019s rotten body.For a fraction of a second, he stopped moving.Immediately, Kim Suho began to counterattack.He unleashed the magic power of a Sword Saint. His clear magic power rose up like a tornado, and his sword shone with a golden light.Next, he unleashed his own sword technique.A powerful strike that shot up like lightning, consecutive strikes that could seemingly sever rivers\u2026 the Swordsman of Destruction held up his sword to block them. However, each time the swords clashed, a crack appeared on the swordsman\u2019s sword. Because of the bullet in his shoulder, his movement had also slowed down.Kim Suho followed my advice and only attacked his sword.It was the right method of defeating it.The swordsman didn\u2019t last long. Although Kim Suho was striking the sword, the swordsman\u2019s body began to crumble.\u201cHuaaap!\u201dKim Suho dealt a final blow with a powerful shout.Just like that, the sword shattered, and the swordsman\u2019s body turned into dust and scattered into the air.In the place of the swordsman\u2026All that was left was a single branch.\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dDumbstruck, Kim Suho stared at the branch.\u201cW-What\u2019s this?\u201dHe looked around the room just in case he was missing something. However, there was no weapon or armor like the one he expected to see. The sword used by the Swordsman of Destruction had turned into dust, and the armor he was wearing had also disappeared.In other words, the only thing that could possibly be the reward was the single branch in front of him.\u201cThis is it\u2026?\u201dDisappointed, Kim Suho fell to the ground. I smirked and walked up to him.\u201cHey, this branch is\u2026.\u201dWhen I was about to tell him about Misteltein\u2026\u201cWho are you?\u201dA deep voice rang out.I quickly turned around.\u201c\u2026Shoot.\u201dI bit my lips.They were the two Djinns I saw before. One was holding a greatsword, and the other was holding a double-edged axe the size of his body.Didn\u2019t they say they were going to go back? How did they come back so quickly?\u201cOy, we just asked who you were. How did you get in here?\u201dThe axe-wielding baldy scowled intimidatingly, but the sword-wielding Caucasian man stopped him. He then spoke more politely.\u201cOur Packhorse Master guild put in an official declaration to take on this Dungeon. Who are you guys?\u201dPretending to answer him, I stepped up and kicked the branch to the corner of the cave.\u201c\u2026Ah, is that so? We didn\u2019t know. There was another pathway in here. That\u2019s where we came from.\u201d\u201cAnother pathway?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe Caucasian man\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cWhat did you do here?\u201d\u201cWe hunted a monster.\u201d\u201cAnd the reward?\u201d\u201cAs you can see\u2026 nothing.\u201dI raised my hands, smiling.Then, the baldy next to him whispered. He pointed at Kim Suho who was still on the ground.\u201cWait, isn\u2019t that\u2026 Kim Suho? You know, the rank 1 cadet in Cube?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dThe Caucasian man stopped and messaged his comrades.\u201cYes, this is James. Yes, something came up. There are two Cube cadets here. One of them is\u2026.\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, a clear command rang out.\u2014Kill them.**At the same time, in Cube\u2019s Fitness Center far away from Suwon\u2019s Kamak Mountain.\u201cHuaa\u2026.\u201dRachel just finished her 4-hour-long training session. Her day had finally come to an end.Letting out a sluggish sigh, she murmured quietly.\u201cI\u2019m sleepy\u2026.\u201d\u2018Now let\u2019s go back to my room, take a shower, and sleep. Since tomorrow is Saturday, I should be able to sleep in. Right, I should sleep until 3 P.M. That\u2019s a good plan.\u2019When she grabbed the changing room\u2019s doorknob with such happy thoughts, she happened to hear two cadets gossiping.\u2014\u2026Did you know Kim Hajin likes Rachel?Immediately, Rachel\u2019s shoulders strongly shook.\u2014What, really? No way.\u2014Yes way. Can\u2019t you see how he\u2019s been following her around recently? People are saying he\u2019s going to confess to her soon.\u2014What? Confess? I don\u2019t believe it. Someone like him?Rachel let go of the doorknob and slowed backed off. She was unable to understand what was happening and suddenly felt a bit dizzy. Confess? So suddenly? How did they know this?\u2026At that moment, she bumped into someone.\u201cAh!\u201dRachel quickly turned around. Chae Nayun was glaring at her with furrowed brows.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing.\u201d\u201cNo, not nothing. You\u2019re stepping on my foot.\u201dOnly then did Rachel begin to understand the situation.Indeed, she was stepping on Chae Nayun\u2019s foot.\u201c\u2026Ah, sorry.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dChae Nayun clicked her tongue and grabbed the doorknob.\u201cAh!\u201dRachel flinched. She didn\u2019t want more people to overhear their gossip\u2026 but before Rachel could stop her, Chae Nayun walked in.\u201c\u2026Hello? Rachel-ssi?\u201dThen, someone else approached her. It was Yoo Yeonha.\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going in?\u201dRachel scratched her cheek and backed off.\u201cNo, please go ahead.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dYoo Yeonha gave Rachel a meaningful look before walking into the changing room.The door then closed, and Rachel strained her ears once again.\u2014Oh hey! Nayun, Yeonha, have you guys heard?\u2014What.\u2014I hear Kim Hajin is going to\u2026\u201cT-Those girls\u2026!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t allow these rumors to spread. Rachel opened the door strongly and barged in. Seeing her, the two gossiping cadets fell silent.\u201cW-What? What about Kim Hajin?\u201dChae Nayun didn\u2019t even glance at Rachel as she urged the two cadets to speak.\u201cI-It\u2019s nothing!\u201dThey quickly ran away. Seeing them leave, Rachel let out a sigh of relief.\u201c\u2026Whew.\u201dYoo Yeonha, who was watching Rachel, suddenly made a meaningful smile as though she suddenly remembered something.\u201cOh right, Rachel-ssi.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in that person\u2019s team, right?\u201dRachel tilted her head.\u201cThat person\u2026?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s talking about Kim Hajin. For some reason, she can\u2019t call Kim Hajin by his name.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes I can.\u201dYoo Yeonha let out a dry cough.\u201cAnyways, how is he?\u201d\u201cYes? What do you mean by\u2026.\u201dThen for some reason, Yoo Yeonha made a somewhat angry face.\u201cRachel-ssi? Aren\u2019t you looking down on me too much? I know that the English Royal Court guild made him an offer. Everyone knows it.\u201dImmediately, Rachel\u2019s expression stiffened.\u201cThat\u2026 I don\u2019t know anything about\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be. The English Royal Court guild is only given two chances per year to contact cadets. What fool would spend one on a rank 334 cadet?\u201dYoo Yeonha cut Rachel off and continued to speak quietly.\u201cNot unless you personally witnessed what that rank 334 cadet is hiding.\u201dYoo Yeonha gave Rachel a cold glare. However, she soon put on a bright smile.\u201c\u2026Well, I\u2019m kidding. But I don\u2019t think you should use the Royal Court guild so easily. I know it\u2019s a special privilege acquired through an agreement between two countries, but doing so might create unnecessary enemies.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYoo Yeonha made a warning masked as advice.Right.This was a warning.At the same time, Rachel felt a cold emotion wavering deep inside her heart.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel glared at Yoo Yeonha with a look that could cut. Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t avoid Rachel\u2019s eyes, receiving it leisurely.\u201cWhat, what are you guys talking about?\u201dAnd Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t understand their conversation, even though she heard everything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Scout (3)\u2014Kill them.I could hear their communication. Immediately, I felt a chill run down my back.\u201c\u2026Are you sure?\u201dThe Caucasian man asked again. However, the answer was the same. The Caucasian man calmly nodded, gripping his greatsword. The baldy grinned as he held up his double-edged axe.\u201cBlame your curiosity.\u201dThe moment the Caucasian man muttered, the surroundings changed. A tide of darkness shot up from the right side, engulfing everyone.Kim Suho disappeared into the darkness, and I was left alone with the bald barbarian.It was an isolation barrier.\u201c\u2026Haha, big bro always leaves me with the boring work.\u201dBoring work. He was obviously referring to me, but I couldn\u2019t refute him either.Two golden axes were engraved on the chest region of his leather armor. It was a symbol used by Heroes to denote their rank. Two golden weapons indicated intermediate rank. Since there was nothing else other than the two golden axes, he was a grade 9 hero.\u201c\u2026Why is an intermediate rank Hero doing something like this to a cadet?\u201dAlthough I knew the answer, I asked anyway. The baldy smiled without replying. Unlike what his appearance might suggest, he didn\u2019t seem to be the talkative type.The baldy collected his magic power silently. A powerful current of magic power rose up around his axe, heating up the space within the isolation barrier.Sweat formed on the tip of my nose, and a cold sweat dripped down my back.I couldn\u2019t win against that baldy. His axe could easily split my skull in half, and with the isolation barrier surrounding us, I had no way to run.But there had to be something I could do\u2026.Suddenly, I had a flash of insight.I didn\u2019t know much about that baldy\u2019s personality.But from his barbaric appearance, I could surmise that he was belligerent, prideful, and reckless.It wasn\u2019t a really logical deduction, but people like him usually looked down on their opponents. He was a typical clich\u00e9 character that would have appeared several times in novels I\u2019ve read and written.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dI sighed almost subconsciously.I bent down and pretended to pick up a rock as I molded Aether into the rock.95% of Aether was turned into a rock, while the remaining 5% was used to form a transparent thread that wrapped around my wrist and was tied to the rock.Then, I muttered softly.\u201cScan.\u201dThe result was 30%.Although it was above the average, I was less fortunate than normal. The difference in 14% was huge in practice.\u201cWhat are you going to do with that?\u201dSeeing me holding the rock, the baldy showed interest. I fell into thought. Should I just throw it at him? Or tick him off a little more?\u201c\u2026I just thought this would be enough.\u201dI chose the latter. Immediately, his veins popped up in anger.My lips dried up.Will he charge at me in anger? Or will he examine me more closely?\u201cWhere is your confidence coming from?\u201dThe baldy widened his eyes and stood on guard. He seemed to be searching me for hidden weapons. Of course, with not even a tiny movement of magic power within my body, the baldy could only frown.\u201c\u2026You little brat.\u201dI stared at him as I fiddled with the Aether rock. The baldy stood still with his double-bladed axe. Though he called me a brat condescendingly, he seemed to be wondering what I would do.\u201cI\u2019m gonna throw this.\u201dSince he was letting me have the first attack, I accepted it gladly.I threw the rock with all my strength. It flew quickly and accurately.However, before the rock could reach his head, he leaned slightly to the side. The rock easily flew by him.A big smile emerged on the baldy\u2019s face.However, I wasn\u2019t disappointed. This was within my expectations.He easily dodged the rock. Me acting like there was something about the rock had forced him to dodge it. Since he could see that there was nothing to it, he undoubtedly had his guard down now.I had saved Stigma\u2019s magic power for this exact moment.\u201cHuup!\u201dI poured all of Stigma\u2019s magic power into the Aether thread that connected the rock and my wrist. Then, I yanked it with all the strength I could muster.Stigma\u2019s magic power flared up explosively on the transparent Aether thread. This burning of magic power could undoubtedly be seen with the naked eye.Immediately, the leisurely smile on the baldy\u2019s face disappeared. Taken aback by the sudden eruption of magic power, he readied his qi reinforcement. However, it was too late.Before his qi reinforcement could fully form, the rock that flew by his head came back with even more power, striking his head like lightning.Thwack.With the sound of a rock cracking, the light disappeared from the baldy\u2019s eyes.Thud.His muscular body fell to the ground.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI staggered toward him. He wasn\u2019t dead yet. Djinns had abnormally high recuperative power. I had to end him quickly\u2026I aimed my gun loaded with a light bullet at the back of his head. I didn\u2019t have the magic power to transform it into the shotgun mode.Without even a moment of hesitation, I pulled the trigger.KWANG!The light bullet struck his head squarely.Psssh\u2026However, the bullet was blocked by his dense skull and was unable to pierce through.The baldy suddenly raised his head.\u201cGAAH!\u201dHe then let out a loud roar. The soundwave struck my stomach. Although Aether formed a barrier before it was too late, a huge shock shook my body nonetheless.I was sent flying back and struck the wall. Immediately, my vision grew thin. A mere sound attack without physical contact transmitted shock that seemingly ruptured my organs.\u201c\u2026You son of\u2026 a bitch\u2026\u201dThe baldy staggered up as he cursed. His face didn\u2019t seem human. His skin turned pitch black, his eyes were glowing red, and most importantly, sheep horns had grown on his head.\u2026Devil Transformation.I closed my eyes and sighed.No matter how lucky I was, this was the end of the line. I should have ended things before it got to this stage, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to use this, but you\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the sound of something cutting through flesh rang out in the empty cave.Puzzled, I opened my eyes.A black blade going through the baldy\u2019s chest.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dThe baldy stared at the blade piercing through him, then fell down and lost consciousness. Before his body could touch the ground, it transformed into black dust and scattered.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn place of the baldy was Chameleon Troupe\u2019s Boss.Stunned, I stared at her in a daze.She let out a dry cough, then spoke briefly.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dBoss stared at me with a very calm expression.Chameleon Troupe\u2019s boss. I somewhat understood why she was here. Chameleon Troupe was supposed to interfere with Packhorse Master.But what I couldn\u2019t understand was why she kept appearing in front of me.\u201c\u2026We\u2019re running into each other rather often, huh.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dBoss answered sincerely at my somewhat sarcastic remark.\u201cBecause I was watching over you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dBoss approached me silently, then handed me a business card. This time, it wasn\u2019t a guild business card belonging to Li Xiaopeng.[Jeronimo Mercenary \u2013 Yi Saeyeon.]Jeronimo Mercenary. Although it was a mercenary group second only to Vast Expanse, in truth it was Chameleon Troupe\u2019s disguise. In other words, Jeronimo Mercenary Group was Chameleon Troupe.\u201cJeronimo\u2026?\u201dMy eyes widened.I wasn\u2019t pretending to be surprised. I truly was.One of the important events I wrote was unfolding in front of my eyes in a completely different way.\u300c\u2026She stood before Shin Jonghak. He already knew who she was as he had seen her many times before.\u201cNice to see you.\u201dAfter appearing out of nowhere, she greeted him out of the blue. Shin Jonghak laughed, unable to comprehend the situation.\u201cAren\u2019t you showing yourself too frequently?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dShe made a small smile.\u201cBecause I was watching over you.\u201dThen, she handed Shin Jonghak a small business card.\u2018Jeronimo Mercenary\u2019.When Shin Jonghak saw this, his eyes glimmered with a bright light.\u300d**Yoo Yeonha\u2019s room, Dorm 6\u2019s penthouse.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThree people were sitting in a circle, watching each other silently.None of them wanted to lose an inch, leading to the creation of this ill-matched group.It all started with what Yoo Yeonha said out of courtesy.\u2018Since we ran into each other, would you like to come for a night snack at my place?\u2019Anyone could tell these were empty words. In reality, there was only a single bag of chips on the table in front of them.However, Rachel accepted this offer.\u201c\u2026Would you like some juice?\u201d\u201cNo thanks.\u201dUnable to endure the awkward atmosphere, Yoo Yeonha made an offer, which Rachel refused.After that, another 10 minutes of silence continued.When the bored Chae Nayun sprawled down on the couch and scratched her belly half-asleep\u2026\u201cI want to ask.\u201dYoo Yeonha opened her mouth. She was talking to Rachel.\u201cHow did you find out?\u201dIt was a vague question, but Rachel knew what she was referring to. She was asking about Kim Hajin.\u201c\u2026I found out naturally.\u201dAt Rachel\u2019s nonchalant answer, Yoo Yeonha smiled somewhat scornfully.\u201cBut you don\u2019t know why that person is hiding his power, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel closed her mouth. She was convinced that Kim Hajin was hiding his power, but she didn\u2019t know why.At that moment, Chae Nayun woke up from her sleep and interjected.\u201cHey, what are you talking about? \u201cThen, Yoo Yeonha made a triumphant smile.\u201cWell, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s easy to find out.\u201dRachel glared at Yoo Yeonha, annoyed by the triumphant air she put on. Yoo Yeonha got up leisurely. She then brought orange juice and poured it into wine glasses.Staring at the glass of orange juice, Rachel asked.\u201cDoes knowing that change anything?\u201d\u201cIt changes everything. Isn\u2019t that obvious? It\u2019s like how Essence of the Strait is bigger than most government guilds.\u201d\u201cNo, what I\u2019m talking about is\u2026\u201dIn truth, Rachel wasn\u2019t too concerned about Kim Hajin. However, she didn\u2019t want to lose to Yoo Yeonha.\u201cRather than finding out about it myself, it\u2019s better to wait until that person tells me about it himself.\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s face immediately turned cold. Her investigation had been done in private. Kim Hajin didn\u2019t ask for it, nor was it for the good of the public.\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what I think.\u201dWith that, Rachel got up from her seat.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be off. It\u2019s gotten too late.\u201dRachel walked to the front door. Yoo Yeonha glared at her exiting form with strange eyes.\u201c\u2026Wait, why am I the only one out of the loop? Hey, Yoo Yeonha, are you sure you were speaking in Korean?\u201dMeanwhile, Chae Nayun grumbled in frustration.**\u201cHuu\u2026.\u201dThe barrier shattered.Soon, Kim Suho appeared with a haggard expression. James was sprawled on the ground, unconscious, and Kim Suho was holding a branch in his hand.I immediately had a hunch.That Kim Suho won by himself.Of course, Misteltein was an amazing weapon even without being awakened. Since that Djinn was also a sword user, Kim Suho would have been well-suited to fighting him.I spoke to Kim Suho.\u201cYou won?\u201d\u201c\u2026So did you.\u201dWe looked at each other and laughed.But soon, Kim Suho put on a serious face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Anyways, Hajin, I don\u2019t think this is an ordinary branch.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? To me, it looks amazing at first glance.\u201d\u201cReally? How?\u201d\u201cTake a seat.\u201dFirst, I sat Kim Suho down. I had trouble staying standing as I felt a bit dizzy.Both physically and psychologically\u2026 I was quite exhausted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Words Without Legs (1)I tried to explain the true value of the branch logically. The evidence I provided was rather simplistic, but it was persuasive nonetheless.I said that it was impossible for a simple branch to be the reward for killing the Swordsman of Destruction. So rather than concluding that this branch was an ordinary branch, it was more logical to assume that it was special.I then pretended to think about folktales and legends related to a branch and said there was one folktale that fit the bill.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s only one branch that comes to mind. Misteltein.\u201dMisteltein, the branch that slew the Nordic God of Light, Baldur.When Kim Suho heard this divine name of myths, his eyes widened in shock. I continued my explanation.\u201cBut as you know, a divine weapon needs to undergo one or more awakenings to fully reveal itself. This branch must be the unawakened Misteltein.\u201dI stared at the branch on the ground. It really did look like an ordinary branch.\u201cThat\u2019s why it looks so simple.\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026 then we should figure out how to awaken it, right?\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026.\u201dI stared at the Caucasian man Kim Suho defeated. He was collapsed on the ground. It didn\u2019t look like he was pretending to be unconscious either.The fact that his body was there meant that Kim Suho had not killed him.Of course, Kim Suho didn\u2019t have a real reason to kill him, as it looked like the man didn\u2019t reveal that he was a Djinn.In reality, Devil Transformation was close to being a forbidden, secret technique among Djinns who infiltrated human society. The baldy only used it because he felt he would have died otherwise.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get out of here first?\u201dI spoke as I pointed at the Caucasian man. As I didn\u2019t know when he would wake up, it didn\u2019t feel right staying here any longer.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201dI didn\u2019t reveal to Kim Suho that the Caucasian man was a Djinn.It was because I was worried about the stock price plummeting. The worst thing that could happen was Packhorse Master\u2019s stock becoming trash. After all, I threw all the money I made so far into it.\u201cOh right, what happened to the man you fought?\u201dKim Suho suddenly asked.\u201c\u2026He ran away.\u201d\u201cOh, then what should we do about that one? Shouldn\u2019t we report him to the Association?\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have any evidence. Plus, this place is the hidden stage of the Dungeon they were conquering. Since we are the ones who entered without going through proper procedures, we might end up getting punished instead.\u201dOf course, this was all a lie to protect my wealth.We walked out of the Dungeon while talking about various things.The outside world was already dark. The mountain was eerily lit up by the moon, and the cries of wolves and owls rang out.It was practically a scene from Hometown Legends.[1]I was scared, but I didn\u2019t have the strength to continue walking. I sat down on the ground to rest.\u201c\u2026Auu.\u201dMy whole body was plagued with pain and fatigue, especially my upper arm. Because I used all of Stigma\u2019s magic power in one blow, it kept throbbing painfully. I couldn\u2019t even move my left arm.Kim Suho sat down next to me. I pointed at the branch in his hand.\u201cPut that branch down for a minute.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dThen, using only my right arm, I took out the Butterfly Seedling Dust from my belt bag.\u201cTake a look.\u201dI proudly showed him the Butterfly Seedling Dust. Its blue glow made it look like a treasure even at a glance.Kim Suho asked in surprise.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201dI stopped in the middle of my sentence. Then, I looked at Kim Suho\u2019s eyes, which shone with curiosity.This dust was supposed to belong to Kim Suho, but since it ended up in my hands, I thought to use it to give Kim Suho a favorable impression of me.\u201cIt\u2019s a family keepsake\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Keepsake?\u201d\u201cN-No, it\u2019s not a keepsake. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s very important to me.\u201dI quickly corrected myself. Admittedly, saying that it was a family keepsake was going a bit overboard.\u201cAnyway, this mystical dust can act as a catalyst for awakening hidden potentials of objects and humans. It was a gift from an elemental. You\u2019ve heard about elementals, right?\u201d\u2018I\u2019m using this precious item on Misteltein. Just for you. So, feel grateful.\u2019That was the nuance I suggested with my words.It seemed to have worked as Kim Suho put on a serious face.\u201cIf I put this on Misteltein\u2026 something should change.\u201dI knew that it would undergo its first awakening. Afterwards, the branch would take the form of a sword on its own based on Kim Suho\u2019s increase in skill and the demonic energy cut down by Misteltein.\u201cI\u2019m going to apply it.\u201dI went to apply the dust on the branch.\u201c\u2026Wait.\u201dBut suddenly, Kim Suho grabbed my wrist. He looked at me with a worried face.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it was important to you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dI laughed subconsciously.\u201cIt\u2019s important, so it should be used at a time like this. Where else would I use it, if not on a divine grade weapon like Misteltein?\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026.\u201d\u201cJust shut up and take it.\u201dI cut him off and swiped Kim Suho\u2019s hand away. Kim Suho scratched the back of his neck and looked at me half-gratefully, half-worriedly. I could tell that he was deeply touched. It seemed making a big deal out of this was worth it.I carefully sprinkled the Butterfly Seedling Dust on Misteltein.The dust seeped into Misteltein, and change was quick to happen.The dust\u2019s blue light flowed through the branch, and soon the surface of the branch turned black.Now, it no longer looked like an ordinary branch.However, there was another change. A leaf sprouted up from the tip of the branch, then fell to the ground.Was it like this in the original story?\u201cSee, I was right.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dKim Suho looked down at Misteltein and muttered in awe.From this black branch, Kim Suho should be able to feel the hidden power of legends and myths.\u201cThen, as promised\u2026\u201dI gave Misteltein to Kim Suho. Then, I picked up the leaf on the ground.\u201cYou take the branch, and I\u2019ll take the leaf.\u201d\u201cHajin\u2026 are you sure? Why don\u2019t we share this weapon? You can use it whenever you need it.\u201d\u201cPlease, I\u2019m not a swordsman. I\u2019ll just die if I fight with a sword.\u201dI made Kim Suho back down, then stealthily turned on my smartwatch.===[Misteltein Leaf]\u2014A byproduct left by the god-slaying branch after its awakening.You can drink a tea brewed with it, which will increase your body\u2019s health, or you can grind it and use it to make an amazing weapon.===I was more than satisfied with this outcome. I smacked my knees and got up.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dKamak Mountain was too dangerous for us to stay overnight. We went down the mountain together. Kim Suho took the lead as I followed behind him.In the middle of walking down the mountain\u2026 something grabbed my foot strongly. My body leaned forward.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThud. I fell to the ground.I wasn\u2019t hurt. A strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu came over me.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026.\u2019I inspected my foot.As expected, I had tripped on a root.I dug it up carefully. It was a ginseng.I swallowed hard.It had a thick body and several roots branched out of it.It was smaller than the last one I obtained, but it was undoubtedly a ginseng.Jackpot.\u201cHm\u2026.\u201dI stealthily put it in my cross bag, then chased after Kim Suho who went ahead.After 30 minutes of hiking down, Kim Suho and I arrived at the Portal Station.Currently, it was 1:53 A.M. The Portal closed at 2:00.We barely made it on time.\u201cHajin.\u201dIn front of the Portal Station, Kim Suho turned to face me. His soft voice flowed into my ears.\u201cLet\u2019s split up here.\u201d\u201cHm? What about you?\u201d\u201cSince I came all the way here, I\u2019m going to stop by and see my family.\u201dKim Suho smiled.\u201cAnd thank you for today.\u201dAt that moment, a bright moonlight shone down on his face. The silver light revealed his honest eyes and clear smile.\u2026His appearance evoked something inside me. I remembered something I forgot for a moment.The man in front of me, Kim Suho, was this world\u2019s main character.A man who only walked the path of righteousness.A man who never compromised or abandoned his beliefs.An ally of justice with conviction stronger than steel, and a seeker of truth who always treaded the correct path.An existence that was already extinct in the modern world, but one that I always hoped would exist.A righteous hero, one that I could trust more than anyone else in this world.That was Suho (\u5b88\u8b77).[2]Just like his name, he was the true savior who would protect this world.\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dI spoke as we separated.\u201cSee you later.\u201d**I came back to the dorm. The room was pitch black.The sound of the door opening and closing seemed to have awoken Evandel as she trudged into my arms. I went to the couch with Evandel in my embrace. I was dead tired, but I still had one more thing to do.[Jeronimo Mercenary]I looked it up on the internet.[Peak of mercenaries, Jeronimo. Mission success rate 99.7%]Jeronimo Mercenary had 23 members. Their profiles were shown on the portal site along with photos.They were all famous in the field of mercenaries, but in reality, these 23 members were disguises of 5~6 members of the Chameleon Troupe. The one who made this possible was Jain, who had the Gift \u2018Camouflage\u2019.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI took out the business card I received.[Jeronimo Mercenary]Boss scouted me, not Shin Jonghak, into Jeronimo Mercenary. I didn\u2019t know why, but it seemed she wanted me to fill in Chameleon Troupe\u2019s empty seat.I looked down at my smartwatch. Someone had sent me messages four hours ago.[Yo][Can you help me study?][I\u2019ll buy you food][Answer me][You gonna ignore me? \u3161\u3161][Oi \u3161\u3161]It was Chae Nayun. When I saw her messages, I thought about her older brother, Chae Jinyoon. This thought then connected to my thoughts about Chameleon Troupe.With Chameleon Troupe\u2019s help, I might be able to kill Chae Jinyoon.Without anyone finding out.\u2026Without anyone finding out.**Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest. Everything had already been taken care of in regards to Packhorse Master. Now, Chameleon Troupe\u2019s boss and Jain were watching a video on Kim Hajin.\u201cA simple rock with that much power\u2026 indeed, he\u2019s full of potential. You were right, Boss.\u201dJain laughed lightly as she admitted to being wrong.Although it was the result of pouring out magic power, it wasn\u2019t easy to create such destructive power with just a rock.But what Jain liked more than his combat prowess was his mercilessness.If the enemy wasn\u2019t a Djinn, he would have lost his life when he was struck by the rock. At the time, Kim Hajin didn\u2019t know that his enemy was a Djinn.Kim Hajin had attacked him with calm yet firm killing intent.\u201cBut Boss, why aren\u2019t you watching it until the end? I want to see his Devil Transformation.\u201d\u201cThis is enough. Plus, I don\u2019t want to see that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201dJain asked, tilting her head. Boss pouted a little and murmured.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s gross.\u201d**The weekend flew by in a breeze, and Monday arrived.A new week had begun.\u201cAs you all know, Class Competitions will start this Friday. I\u2019m taking volunteers to participate in the events! There\u2019s a variety of them, so each person will have to participate in at least one event.\u201dBefore the start of class, during morning announcements, Yi Yeonghan reminded the class of the upcoming Class Competitions.\u201cOh right.\u201dI only just remembered it.Class Competitions.It was the first and final event before the midterms.Just like its name suggested, classes would compete against each other in several events covering all sorts of topics. There were combat-related events like duels, dungeon time attacks, and magic battles, but also entertainment events like gaming, singing, and soccer.If this was an official competition, only combat events would have been allowed, but this was a festival of sorts for cadets.Naturally, the cadets began to chatter about the events they wanted to participate in.\u201cWhat are you going to do, Rachel-ssi?\u201dI asked Rachel, who was sitting next to me. Then, Rachel flinched slightly before replying with an awkward smile.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 planning on doing the quiz event.\u201d\u201cOh, the quiz event. Maybe I should do that too.\u201d\u201cQuiz event is already full.\u201dJin Hoseung cut in. I turned toward Jin Hoseung, then faced Rachel again. She nodded.\u201cY-Yes\u2026 it\u2019s already full. Unfortunately\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cNow, now, soccer and basketball are already full. Calm down, everyone.\u201dHearing Yi Yeonghan explaining to the class, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of superhuman sports events they would be.\u201cWe need someone for singing and archery\u2026.\u201dYi Yeonghan paused momentarily and looked at me. At first, I thought he was looking at someone else. But seeing him grin when he met my eyes, I knew he was looking at me. Soon, other cadets also turned to face me.I let out a dry cough and spoke.\u201c\u2026I can handle archery.\u201d\u201cPerfect.\u201dSmiling, Yi Yeonghan put my name down.Not just in archery, but also singing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWait, hey!

Words Without Legs (2)Evening, after the end of classes.Tomer was fitting in naturally among cadets. It was the result of the effort she put in for the past two weeks, going so far as to kill her temper.Now that she had a plan for the direction of her mission, she tried her best to get close to other cadets. As a result, both magicians and cadets saw Tomer favorably.Now, she was at a point where she could invite cadets to a caf\u00e9 on her own initiative.\u201cWow, Kim Hajin likes Rachel? Really?\u201dAfter ordering coffee and honey bread that suited their tastes, female cadets began to gossip earnestly.The topic of their conversation was Kim Hajin and Rachel. Tomer had stealthily brought up the subject.\u201cThey\u2019ve been pretty close lately\u2026 but isn\u2019t it because they\u2019re on the same team?\u201dThere were many male cadets who secretly admired Rachel. Not just many, but a lot.But no one had ever been bold enough to directly go after her. It was because of Rachel\u2019s identity and her future path that was the result of her identity.Once Rachel graduated from Cube, she would most likely enter the Royal Court guild, becoming the youngest guild executive.\u201cI guess Kim Hajin is perfect for the Royal Court guild. He rose to rank 334 this time.\u201dThe English Royal Court was the world\u2019s 60th ranked guild.Cube cadets in the 400~500 rank range would have fantasies of joining this guild and becoming the head of a snake.However, no powerful cadet was blinded by love to enter the Royal Court guild to chase after Rachel, and Rachel wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with cadets who were only at the 400~500 rank positions.\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m in the same team. Trust me, you would say the same thing if you saw his eyes. How do I say this\u2026 his eyes turned heart-shaped!\u201dHowever, Tomer tenaciously instigated them, even making ridiculous claims.\u201cReally? \u2026Oh yeah, isn\u2019t Kim Hajin singing in the upcoming Class Competitions?\u201dSuddenly, one of the cadets widened her eyes and raised her voice.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to confess, is he!?\u201d\u201cKyaaak! Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps. I\u2019m going to stab him to death if he does\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Eh? Stab him to death?\u201dJust how were these cadets who spoke such ferocious things different from Djinns?Tomer thought seriously.**\u201cSinging\u2026.\u201dI sighed and murmured as soon as I returned to my room.Back on Earth, I often went karaokeing after school, so I knew how to sing.But of course, that didn\u2019t mean I was a good singer.I was average, not so bad and not so good.\u201cArgh, why do I have to sing?\u201dOf course, I had the horn-flute to improve my voice, so I was confident that I would be better than the average person. But cadets from other classes would have volunteered to sing, so they were undoubtedly great singers.Furthermore, I had no experience singing in front of a crowd. Rather than being nervous in front of hundreds of eyes, I preferred being in a position where I wouldn\u2019t have to be nervous.\u201cWill I need to eat a serenity pill like I did for the presentation\u2026?\u201d\u201cSinging~? I can sing the Pororo song!\u201dEvandel, who was in the middle of making a nightingale, shouted with a blooming smile. I replied with a grin.\u201cReally? Let me hear it later.\u201d\u201cUn! But why singing~?\u201d\u201cAh, well\u2026 I got done in by a villain, so I have to sing now.\u201d\u201cA villain!?\u201dEvandel\u2019s eyes suddenly shot open, and she strongly twisted the nightingale\u2019s neck. I\u2019ve been letting her watch superhero cartoons lately, so her reaction was big.\u201cVillain! Villaiiin!\u201d\u201cAh, no, I misspoke. Let go of that nightingale. It\u2019s going to die.\u201d\u201cUn? \u2026Ahh!\u201dStartled, she looked down at the nightingale. Unfortunately, it had already lost form and was beginning to melt.\u201cIi, iiinng\u2026.\u201dSeeing the nightingale she worked hard on going limp, Evandel began to tear up. I silently called Evandel into my arms.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You have to make a mistake, so you know not to make the same mistake next time.\u201dI consoled the sobbing Evandel and turned on the laptop.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s been a while, but I planned to use my laptop\u2019s hacking functionality.The target was Tomer\u2019s personal smartwatch.Last night, I met Tomer at a convenience store, and she approached me to say hello.But at the time, she was wearing a personal smartwatch rather than the cadet smartwatch provided by Cube. Its design was a clear imitation of the cadet smartwatch, so it might have tricked instructors and other cadets, but it couldn\u2019t trick my laptop.[80 SP will be used. Would you like to continue?]\u201cReally?\u201dIt seemed to be a highly secure smartwatch as it took quite a bit of SP. I was spending too much SP lately\u2026I held back my tears and clicked Yes.[Tomer, you will have to pick up an item during this week\u2019s Wednesday class. It will help you in your mission. I\u2019ll tell you about the details tomorrow.]An unknown person had sent this message to Tomer today.I began to read other messages stored on her smartwatch and came to ascertain that her target was Rachel.\u2026Ah, another message just arrived.[Wednesday\u2019s class will be Mock Artifact Scramble. There is an administrative center in the B-3 zone on the lowest floor. The item will be left there. The administrative center will be empty from 11:00 to noon, so take it during that time.]Tomer ended up becoming a spy without even knowing it.Lowest floor. B-3 zone.While I was repeating those words to myself, I received a message on my smartwatch.A picture of a problem along with a few lines of text.When I saw the message, I thought it was Rachel.[Can you please teach me how to solve this problem?]But the sender was Chae Nayun.**Inside a tranquil library, the only sounds present were the sound of pencils scratching on paper and the sound of pages turning.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn this dead-silent atmosphere, Chae Nayun was staring fixedly at a reference book. She tried to study, but unable to achieve her goal, she could only mess with her hair idly.[It is important to calculate the density of magic power in a Dungeon. This is one of the most important skills for a Hero to have. This is because a Dungeon\u2019s magic power density can suddenly change depending on what happens inside the Dungeon.Take a look at the following formula\u2026\u2026\u2026Example 1) Suppose that a magic power explosion happens in a tiny-scale Dungeon with six cobalt kobold goblins\u2026]\u201cWhy do I have to learn this?\u201dChae Nayun murmured silently and leaned back.She couldn\u2019t even solve the first example. She was okay with memorization courses, but she could do nothing about the damned Phenomenon Realm Analysis II, which was full of calculations.\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe glanced to the side in despair. Rachel was sitting there with an empty seat between them.In truth, Chae Nayun sat here on purpose. She wanted to peek at Rachel.From the side, Rachel looked a bit sullen. With her chin resting on her palm, she seemed to be in deep thought, worrying about something.\u2018I guess she has her own troubles.\u2019It seemed she couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion, as she suddenly turned on her smartwatch. Then, she hesitated for a moment before shaking her head and turning it off.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s up with her?\u201dChar Nayun muttered softly and turned back to her reference book.[Example 1) Suppose that a magic power explosion happens in\u2026]She stared at the words, but nothing entered her mind. Without a choice, she held up her smartwatch. Then, she took a picture of the page with the watch\u2019s built-in camera.Next, she looked through her contact list. Someone who could help her\u2026 was Kim Hajin.[Help me with this]She typed this message, then erased it. It felt too impudent.[Can you help me with this? I\u2019ll buy you food]\u201cNo, this one doesn\u2019t feel right either.\u201d[You\u2019re a genius if you can solve this! \u314b\u314b\u314b]\u201cThis seems a bit stupid\u2026\u201dAfter much thought, she made her message as courteous as it could be.[Can you please teach me how to solve this problem?]Then, she put down her smartwatch.1 minute, three minutes, five minutes\u2026 Time flew by.\u2018Is he not going to reply?\u2019 When Chae Nayun was about to put her reference book away with a sullen face, her smartwatch rang.\u201cOoh!\u201dChae Nayun hurriedly checked the content.Kim Hajin had sent a very kind and detailed solution.\u201cHeehee.\u201dChae Nayun smiled brightly and took her reference book back out. At the same time, she received another message.This time, it was a message from Yi Yeonghan for everyone in Veritas class.[On Wednesday this week, we will have a Mock Artifact Scramble. Be prepared everyone~]**\u201cToday\u2019s combat training is Mock Artifact Scramble!\u201dToday was Wednesday. Just like I read in Tomer\u2019s smartwatch and Yi Yeonghan\u2019s announcement, Wednesday was set aside for a single combat training from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M.Mock Artifact Scramble. Just like its name suggested, it was a competition to obtain artifacts.125 cadets of the Veritas class gathered on the first floor of Underground Plaza, where the scramble would take place.\u201cArtifact Scrambles are something Heroes will experience at least once every year.\u201dReal artifact scrambles happened in places outside of government control. This was because artifacts found inside a country belonged to the government by law.In this world, numerous countries collapsed during Outcall, and many of their territories remain ownerless to this day.Most of Africa was overrun by monsters, and Central Asia was dominated by the Djinns\u2019 rule. In these regions, artifacts belonged to whoever found them.\u201cThe size of the artifact excavation site is \u2018massive\u2019, and the concept is \u2018brawl\u2019. You will not know the enemy command structure, nor will you have a way to contact your allies and nor will you have the locations of the artifacts!\u201dMock Artifact Scrambles often used the brawl-format because of a Djinn with a Gift called \u2018Brawl\u2019.In real life, artifact scrambles happened between guilds, or between guilds and Djinn groups. The former only happened 20~30 years ago when laws regarding artifact scrambles weren\u2019t in place. Nowadays, artifact scrambles were mostly fights against Djinns.\u201cWe separated you into Team White or Team Black. Team White will be defenders, and Team Black will be attackers. Remember that the concept is \u2018brawl\u2019! In addition, you can shout \u2018surrender\u2019, and you will be considered eliminated.\u201dUntil the 90\u2019s, humans were in an advantage due to their efficient command structure and sturdy organizations. However, the situation was reversed because of one Djinn.Bermut.His Gift randomly distributed humans and Djinns in an area. This effectively destroyed humans\u2019 formations, and since Djinns were able to use Devil Transformation, they were stronger than humans in one-on-one battles.\u201cNow, we will take away your vision.\u201dWith that, my vision turned dark. A few surprised cadets let out short shrieks.\u201cIt\u2019s an instructor\u2019s magic. Stay calm. You don\u2019t need to try to disable it.\u201dIt seemed a high-intermediate rank Hero could easily blind 125 people.Of course, that didn\u2019t apply to me.When I opened my eyes, I could clearly see what was in front of me.\u201cWe will now guide you to your designated locations.\u201dArtifact excavation sites were usually huge, having multiple floors and even a residential area. Most artifacts were buried deep underground, so excavating them took at least 2 to 3 weeks.Although excavation sites were underground, it didn\u2019t mean that they looked like caverns or tunnels.Because of technicians with extraordinary Gifts, excavation sites looked more like futuristic underground bunkers.\u201cHey, hey, don\u2019t step on my foot.\u201d\u201cAh! Somebody hit me.\u201dCadets were led underground together.15 were placed on the first floor, and 25 were placed on the slightly bigger second floor.Chae Nayun was placed in the middle of the third underground floor. Rachel was also nearby, placed on a balcony that was connected to the third floor\u2019s residential area.Their fight was inevitable.As for me, I was placed in a small room on the fourth floor. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to see where Shin Jonghak and Kim Suho would be placed.\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dBut a problem arose.Yoo Yeonha was in the room right next to me.Considering the layout of the floor, I needed to cross her to get out to the hall.In addition, I was in Team Black, and Yoo Yeonha was in Team White. We were enemies.At that moment, a loud voice rang out from the speaker above me.\u2014Artifacts are being kept or moved by NPCs. Team White must protect the artifacts, and Team Black must steal them. Now, we will start the countdown.The opened doors all closed, and the countdown began.5, 4, 3, 2, 1.Once the countdown ended, the blinding magic disappeared.I checked the magazine of my cadet training issue handgun. Then, I checked the coordinate I needed to get to.The lowest floor\u2019s B-3 zone.\u2014I heard a sound next door\u2026At that moment, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s voice rang out. I quickly turned to face the closed door.Tak, tak.Yoo Yeonha walked forward, intentionally making loud footsteps. Then, she knocked on the door of the room I was in.\u2014I know you\u2019re there. Are you in Team Black or Team White? For the record, I\u2019m in Team White.I stayed silent.Yoo Yeonha then hummed joyfully and grabbed the doorknob.\u2014No answer? I assume that means you\u2019re in Team Black. How unfortunate, you must have been looking forward to today\u2019s class. Consider yourself unlucky\u2026Ssss\u2014The door opened, and Yoo Yeonha appeared with a bright face.Then, her eyes met mine.\u201c\u2026!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn an instant, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s expression froze. Her smiling lips trembled, and the wide eyes turned stiff.We were on the opposite team.In other words, we had to fight.But for some reason\u2026 it looked like Yoo Yeonha was scared of fighting me.Gulp.Yoo Yeonha swallowed hard. Her hands were shaking faintly, and I could clearly see sweat forming on her forehead.After a brief confrontation, my neck felt itchy, so I moved my hand up to scratch it.However, Yoo Yeonha reacted oddly even to this simple movement.\u201cStay, stay away!\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI tilted my head. You were the one who came to me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Words Without Legs (3)With Kim Hajin in front of her, Yoo Yeonha was torn between fighting him or running away. Although she came into the room confident in her abilities, she didn\u2019t expect to meet such a powerful enemy from the beginning.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Hajin stood still, seemingly unaware of her worry. However, his relaxed attitude made Yoo Yeonha even more nervous. She couldn\u2019t take his gaze head-on. This was the first time she had ever felt like this. It wasn\u2019t like this before\u2026.Then suddenly, Kim Hajin raised his hand.In truth, Kim Hajin was only trying to scratch an itch on the back of his neck.\u201cStay, stay away!\u201dBut Yoo Yeonha, who didn\u2019t know this, shouted subconsciously.Kim Hajin stared at her silently, then slowly dropped his hand.His gun was already in his right hand. It wasn\u2019t the Desert Eagle Yoo Yeonha gave him, but a normal cadet handgun.However, Kim Hajin had destroyed Kim Horak\u2019s qi reinforcement even with an ordinary gun. It was precisely why he received the attention of top-ranking guilds for a while.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Hajin raised his gun. Yoo Yeonha could feel beads of sweat flowing down her face.First, she calmly examined her surroundings. Behind her was a narrow, straight hallway, making it difficult for her to escape the range of his gun. She only had two choices: fight, or be beaten.Yoo Yeonha looked down at the whip in her hand. Then, she suddenly thought of something.\u2018Perhaps this is the best chance for me confirm his skills. My current estimate of his strength only comes from observation. If I fight him now, I should be able to see a glimpse of his real power\u2026.\u2019At the same time, she had a different thought. This time, it was more cowardly.\u2018If I fight Kim Hajin and lose, I\u2019ll likely be the first one to be eliminated. I don\u2019t want that to happen, but struggling for my life doesn\u2019t suit my style either. It\u2019s definitely not because I hate pain.\u2019After calmly weighing her options, Yoo Yeonha sighed.Then, she opened her eyes wide as though she came to a decision.Glaring at Kim Hajin with eyes sharper than the glare of a lynx, she swung her whip. Her whip moved fluidly like it was part of her limb, then it grabbed onto Kim Hajin\u2019s gun.Shweeek!In the blink of an eye, Kim Hajin\u2019s gun was snatched out of his hands.Yoo Yeonha stared blankly at the gun that fell into her hand.\u201cI, I did it! Ha, haha!\u201d\u2018I never thought I\u2019d succeed! Ahahaha\u2014!\u2019Yoo Yeonha laughed proudly and thought, \u2018maybe this person isn\u2019t that amazing after all!\u2019\u201cEven if it\u2019s you, without a weapon\u2026\u201dBut in the next moment\u2026The gun flew back into Kim Hajin\u2019s hand as though it was enchanted by something.\u201cAh, aah! W-Where are you going!?\u201dYoo Yeonha tried to grab the gun midair, but it was too late.The \u2018Aether wire\u2019 Kim Hajin secretly shot out adhered to the gun and retrieved it. With Aether\u2019s Detail Materialization trait, Aether wire was invisible unless one\u2019s eyes were imbued with magic power. As a result, Yoo Yeonha thought that this phenomenon was the result of Kim Hajin\u2019s magic power.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe smile on Yoo Yeonha\u2019s face quickly disappeared. She stared at Kim Hajin even more nervously than before. Now, she was left with one choice. Since she was the one who made the first move, she believed she had to endure whatever came her way\u2026.Yoo Yeonha swallowed hard.\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201dThen, Kim Hajin let out a deep sigh and held up his gun.He aimed it forward, and Yoo Yeonha shuddered. In front of his steel muzzle, her mind blanked out.How should I dodge it?Will it hurt?Maybe I can dodge it?All sorts of thoughts flashed by her head, but Kim Hajin didn\u2019t fire. He smirked once, then put his gun back into his holster.\u2018What?\u2019While Yoo Yeonha was puzzled, he trudged up to her and tapped on her shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s still early, so let\u2019s take it easy.\u201dAfter murmuring incomprehensible words, he walked past her to the outside.Yoo Yeonha watched him leave in a daze.**\u201cArgh, it still hurts.\u201dMy right wrist was sore. Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip only lightly grazed it when she was snatching my gun, but it tore my skin and turned it red.If it had hit me directly, it would have broken my bones for sure. As I thought, Yoo Yeonha was quite strong as well.\u201cEhew, what a relief.\u201dWith my bluff working well, I safely went past Yoo Yeonha and entered the fourth-floor lobby.The fourth-floor lobby was quite huge but oddly silent. There were no voices nor were there any noticeable presences.What\u2019s going on? Did everyone go elsewhere?I turned on my smartwatch.All cadets participating in the Mock Artifact Scramble were wearing \u2018life-detection devices\u2019. These devices accurately measured the HP of each cadet, eliminating those that received critical damage.Through the smartwatch which was connected to the laptop, I checked the GPS coordinates of these devices.There were only ten cadets on this floor, including me and Yoo Yeonha.Six of these ten were already traveling in teams.\u201cTomer\u2026.\u201dNext, I checked Tomer\u2019s GPS coordinate.Currently, she was in a bathroom on the seventh floor. It seemed she was planning on killing time there, as she showed no sign of movement.In that case, I had to chase after her.\u2026Then suddenly, I felt curious about what the other cadets were doing.A fight had broken out on the third floor, the floor above me, but the big match had yet to start. In other words, Chae Nayun and Rachel had yet to meet.However, on the fifth-floor lobby, a big match that anyone would want to see was starting. The cadets facing each other were that great.Shin Jonghak and Kim Suho. The two cadets, who could be said to be the representatives of Team Black and Team White, had met.I put on the CCTV watching their fight.\u2014I knew this day would come, Kim Suho.Shin Jonghak muttered in a serious tone.\u2014\u2026.However, Kim Suho faced Shin Jonghak silently.\u2014Come. I\u2019ll show you the difference between our level.Kim Suho pulled out his sword in response to Shin Jonghak\u2019s provocation. Shin Jonghak also held up his spear.Kim Suho was the first to attack. He charged in and swung his sword. Shin Jonghak stepped back as he blocked Kim Suho\u2019s attack. Sparks flashed at the clash between a spear and a sword. They both properly utilized the strengths and weaknesses of their weapons for offense and defense.At that moment, someone quickly shot past me.Stomp, stomp, stomp\u2014 A harsh stair-climbing sound rang out.I glanced up and saw Yoo Yeonha. She was running away faster than anyone I had ever seen before.\u201c\u2026Oh right.\u201dThanks to her footsteps, I snapped back to reality.Although a marvelous, intense exchange of spear and sword was happening below me, I didn\u2019t have the time to leisurely watch them.I headed to the emergency stairs. As it was smaller than the staircase in the central lobby, I would be able to avoid enemy encounters.**\u201cI, I surrender!\u201dA male cadet shouted surrender in front of Chae Nayun\u2019s sword. The moment he said the safe word, he was blindfolded. He would now be transported to the third floor\u2019s \u2018elimination lounge\u2019, where other cadets eliminated from the third floor would be waiting.\u201cWhew\u2026 easy.\u201dChae Nayun murmured proudly as she wiped off her sweat.This was already her third kill.\u201cIt\u2019s only been three months since I switched to a sword and I\u2019m already this strong. I must be really talented with the sword.\u201dWhile Chae Nayun was brimming with confidence, someone shouted softly at her.\u201cNayun\u2014!\u201dChae Nayun turned toward the direction of the voice. It was Yi Jiyoon, who was wearing a white cadet uniform. She ran toward Chae Nayun in short, quick steps.\u201cWhew, thank god.\u201dClinging to Chae Nayun, Yi Jiyoon let out a sigh of relief.\u201cWere you hiding this entire time?\u201dA supporter like Yi Jiyoon was weak in brawls like this. An attack-focused supporter like Yoo Yeonha would be able to shine depending on the situation, but Yi Jiyoon was a purely support-oriented supporter.\u201cNo, I managed to defeat one with my weakening debuff.\u201d\u201cOh really? That\u2019s good. Anyways, it\u2019s nice to see you.\u201dChae Nayun was also happy to see Yi Jiyoon. She was a supporter that enhanced warriors in particular. She provided various physical buffs that made warriors feel like they became Superhuman.\u201cAhh, I really thought I was dead\u2026.\u201dYi Jiyoon calmed her heart for a bit, then spoke as if she suddenly remembered it.\u201cOh yeah, Rachel\u2019s on this floor.\u201d\u201cRachel?\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYeah, I was so surprised! I barely managed to escape because I ran away the moment I saw her.\u201dIt was then.Stomp, stomp, stomp\u2014\u00a0Someone ran upstairs out of breath.\u201cWait.\u201dThe two stared at the staircase nervously. Yi Jiyoon held up her bow, while Chae Nayun pointed her sword at the stairs.However, the person who showed up was someone on their team, Yoo Yeonha.Yoo Yeonha seemed to be relieved as well, as she let out a sigh of relief when she saw Yi Jiyoon. Chae Nayun tilted her head and asked.\u201cYoo Yeonha, why are you sweating so much?\u201d\u201cHuh? Uh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dYoo Yeonha looked haggard, unlike her usual self.Chae Nayun asked in doubt.\u201cWho\u2019s downstairs?\u201dYoo Yeonha replied softly.\u201c\u2026Kim Hajin.\u201d\u201c\u201dKim Hajin?\u201d\u201dYi Jiyoon and Chae Nayun both asked back.\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cOh, then Kim Hajin must be eliminated.\u201dYi Jiyoon asked innocently. Yoo Yeonha shook her head with a bitter smile.\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t get eliminated.\u201d\u2018But I almost did.\u2019 Embarrassed, Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t say the last part out loud.\u201cReally?\u201dChae Nayun, who was scratching her cheek and pretending to be unconcerned, asked in a casual tone.\u201cSo, uh, what was he doing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dYoo Yeonha replied half-heartedly, but then Yi Jiyoon butt in with a strange smile.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s looking for Rachel?\u201dAt Yi Jiyoon\u2019s remark, Chae Nayun tilted her head.\u201cEh? Why Rachel?\u201d\u201cBecause Kim Hajin likes Rachel.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dThis time, both Chae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha were confused.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cEh? You guys don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201c\u2026K-Know what? What about Kim Hajin?\u201dChae Nayun stuttered as she asked again. Yi Jiyoon tilted her head.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know? I thought everyone has heard the rumors by now.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s just a stupid, groundless rumor.\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke firmly. As far as she was concerned, there were more important things to worry about at the moment than such absurd rumors. After all, this Mock Artifact Scramble held great weight in their grades.\u201cAnyways, did you locate the artifacts?\u201d\u201cAh, yeah, I have one on me. I ran into an NPC on my way here.\u201dYi Jiyoon took out a small box from her uniform pocket. Yoo Yeonha\u2019s expression quickly brightened.\u201cI\u2019m glad. First, let\u2019s transport this to the first floor.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAnd Yi Jiyoon, you\u2019re mistaken. That rumor probably spread because Kim Hajin and Rachel are on the same team\u2026.\u201dWhile Chae Nayun was murmuring somewhat seriously\u2026Arrows suddenly rained down. Yoo Yeonha quickly swung her whip and smacked them away.\u201cWho is it!?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChae Nayun shouted with enraged eyes. Although the rain of arrows was mostly blocked by Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip, Chae Nayun was still irritated by the ambush.The three of them turned to the balcony and saw Rachel and other cadets in Team Black.\u201cRachel! How can you ambush us like a coward!\u201dChae Nayun trembled with anger.However, Rachel looked down at them calmly as she pulled out her rapier.\u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201dAt her soft voice, the members of Team Black reacted simultaneously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fake and Real (1)Two archers shot arrows from the balcony, while four warriors charged forward. The cadet at the core of this ambush was Rachel. She entrusted Yi Jiyoon and Yoo Yeonha to the other three warriors and dealt with Chae Nayun herself.As Chae Nayun was a beginner who only just recently switched to a sword, Rachel was confident in her ability to defeat Chae Nayun.\u201cDammit\u2026.\u201dOn the other hand, Chae Nayun clenched her teeth as she exchanged blows with Rachel. She could feel the difference in their skill and experience.Every time she swung her sword once, Rachel swung her rapier twice. Furthermore, Rachel easily parried attacks she couldn\u2019t parry.It wasn\u2019t that there were distractions. Other than Rachel, everyone was focused on dealing with Yi Jiyoon and Yoo Yeonha. As a result, Chae Nayun and Rachel were having a purely one-on-one battle.Clang! Clang!Every time Chae Nayun\u2019s sword clashed with Rachel\u2019s rapier, Chae Nayun felt like her hands were being torn apart.As expected, Rachel was an expert who carried immense strength in her thin rapier.The only thing Chae Nayun could do was to block her attacks.\u201cGoddammit\u2014!\u201dHowever, Chae Nayun didn\u2019t want to lose.At the very least, she didn\u2019t want to lose to Rachel.Her desire to win and unyielding spirit led to an incredible eruption of magic power.Chae Nayun\u2019s magic power exploded, soaring high and gathering around her sword. Her magic power formed a giant sword that was both long and wide.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe vicious yet imposing appearance of the giant sword made Rachel flinch.Chae Nayun swung this giant sword with all her strength.However, a large movement left room for openings.Rachel didn\u2019t receive her attack, instead, she rolled to the side and dodged. As a result, Chae Nayun\u2019s sword only hit the ground.Immediately afterward, something Rachel didn\u2019t expect happened.KOONG!Struck with Chae Nayun\u2019s sword, the floor collapsed.Rachel, who had rolled to the side to avoid Chae Nayun\u2019s attack, fell to the next level without having a chance to be surprised.Thud.After landing on the fourth floor, Rachel stared at the hole above her as she felt pain on her waist. Was the floor supposed to collapse that easily?\u201cWhere did you go!?A lion-like roar rang out from above. Rachel quickly got up. She wanted to return to the battlefield as quickly as possible. Her teammates were too weak to contend with Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun without her\u2026But at that moment, someone appeared in front of her.Rachel turned stiff.Wearing a white cadet uniform, which was the symbol of Team White, he held up his sword.It was Kim Suho.He had defeated Shin Jonghak on the fifth floor and had climbed up to the fourth floor.Rachel bit her lips.From the looks of it, Kim Suho had no intention of going easy. The moment he confirmed that Rachel was in Team Black, he charged toward her. Rachel received his sword with her rapier.A power on a completely different level pressed down on her, making her tremble.**I stopped in front of the sixth-floor bathroom.\u201cIs there an artifact around here\u2026?\u201dI even pretended to be looking for artifacts to trick the administrators who should be watching me. I double checked the message Tomer received on my smartwatch.[There is an administrative center in the B-3 zone of the lowest floor. The item will be left there. The administrative center will be empty from 11:00 to noon, so take it during that time.]The lowest floor was floor 7. B-3 zone referred to the seventh floor\u2019s room 3 of sector B.\u201cArtifact~ are you here~?\u201dI checked the time as I went into the bathroom. Currently, it was 10:45 A.M. I still had about 15 minutes left.\u201c\u2026Eh? What\u2019s this?\u201dHowever, I found a holographic man carrying something in his arms, hiding in a toilet stall.I opened the stall\u2019s door. The holographic NPC flinched after seeing me. Startled, I also raised my gun.\u201cThere really was one here?\u201dWithout firing, I reached forward and grabbed the artifact. The man looked too real as he became pale in fear.After having the artifact stolen, the NPC ran away.With this, I managed to obtain an artifact.I put the artifact in my pocket, then looked below me.In the tile right below me, in the toilet stall of the seventh-floor bathroom, Tomer was still lying in wait.\u201cHmm.\u201dI fell into thought. If I wanted to receive this item in place of Tomer, I had to eliminate her. But how?I began to look around for anything that I could use.Then, I found it.I was inside the sixth-floor bathroom. There was a vent connecting this bathroom to the seventh-floor bathroom.\u201c\u2026Perhaps?\u201dI looked at my upper arm on which two lines were tattooed in the shape of a cross. Stigma\u2019s magic power could be used in more ways than I imagined.I sent my will into Stigma.\u2018Become a magical smoke that can put Tomer to sleep.\u201dIn an instant, 1.5 streaks of Stigma were used up, and a grey smoke began to rise from my upper arm.I stared at the smoke in a daze. Surprisingly, the smoke moved according to my will.\u201cWith this\u2026\u201dI should be able to do it.I sent the smoke down to the seventh-floor bathroom through the vent.Using my Thousand-Mile Eyes, I watched the process.The smoke danced in front of Tomer\u2019s nose. She frowned and tried to wave the smoke away, but the smoke went into her nose, causing her to cough.Soon, her eyes started to droop and blink. Tomer yawned and checked her watch.\u2018I can\u2019t fall asleep.\u2019 Tomer mumbled and tried to get up. However, she collapsed before she could. She had fallen asleep on the toilet.\u201cWhew.\u201dPerfect. Now that Tomer was asleep, I could go to the administrative center instead of her.I went down to the seventh floor.The moment I arrived, the time became 11 A.M. I headed to the B-3 zone without hesitation. The pathway to the administrative center was hidden under a decorative flower bed.I went down the pathway.\u201cNo one\u2019s here.\u201dJust like the message Tomer received indicated, no one was inside the administrative center, which had about twenty monitors like a security room. I approached the large desk in the center of the room. A black box was sitting on top.===[Awl of Weakening] [High rank \u2013 Enchant] [Poison attribute]*An awl that weakens the pricked target.*Enchanted with the high-rank magic effect \u2018Weakening\u2019.===Inside the black box was an awl that looked special even at first glance.\u201cWow, what\u2019s this?\u201dI was surprised. It was a high-rank enchantment. Although the item itself wasn\u2019t an artifact, it would easily fetch 1.5 billion won in market value.It was an unexpected gain.\u201cKuhum.\u201dI let out a dry cough and looked around the room.\u201cFrom now on this is mine.\u201dI put the awl in my pocket and left the room. I didn\u2019t forget to delete the CCTV footage by hacking into its server.Afterward, I left the B-3 zone nonchalantly, then went back up to the sixth floor.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dBut when I arrived on the sixth floor, I was slightly surprised. I found Rachel not so far away.\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201dFor some reason, she looked very haggard. She looked exhausted as though someone had beaten her, and her cadet uniform was tattered.I ran up to her.\u201cRachel-ssi.\u201dI called her name once she was visible with the naked eye.\u201c\u2026!\u201dRachel jumped even at the slightest noise. Her slender shoulders trembled as she turned her head toward me.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m on the same team.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 whew.\u201dShe sighed in relief.By the looks of it, she seemed to be troubled. I approached her with a thin smile.\u201cDid something happen? You don\u2019t look well.\u201dRachel looked up at me and replied briefly.\u201cI tried to ambush the enemy but failed.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dRachel continued speaking in a weak voice.\u201cThen I met Kim Suho and lost.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dShe dropped her head sullenly. However, she wasn\u2019t finished yet.\u201cI barely ran away from Kim Suho, but Chae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha chased after me\u2026. After I escaped from them, magicians started shooting magic at me\u2026.\u201dLike a tattletale, Rachel recounted what happened with downcast eyes.Then suddenly, she asked.\u201c\u2026How many eliminations did Hajin-ssi get?\u201d\u201cI have none.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I have one.\u201dPoints were given based on the number of artifacts acquired and the number of eliminations. At this rate, both of us would rank near the bottom. Ah, I would be fine since I had an artifact.In any case, I didn\u2019t mind scoring near the bottom. I only needed to maintain an average grade overall.But Rachel was different. Her goal was the first place. If she didn\u2019t score well on this artifact scramble, it would be difficult to recover from falling behind.It seemed she knew this as well, as she stared at the floor with devastated eyes. Then, she kicked a poor rock. The rock flew across the room and hit a wall.I rummaged through my pocket and spoke.\u201cWe still have time. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201dRachel slowly raised her head.Looking at her, I took out the artifact in my pocket.\u201cHere. You can have this.\u201dRachel eyes immediately opened wide.\u201cPlease carry it upstairs. Rachel-ssi is faster than me.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, this is yours\u2014\u201d\u201cJust take it.\u201dI cut her off before she could refuse. I just felt like helping her out.\u201cYou see that emergency staircase on the right? It should be\u2026\u201dI examined the emergency staircase with my Thousand-Mile Eyes. A few quick-witted cadets were blocking the way, but they were on the same team as Rachel.\u201cFairly empty.\u201dI smiled as I told her where to go.\u201cOver there!\u201dAt that moment, a thunderous shout rang out. Chae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha ran in along with other members of Team White.In the blink of an eye, Rachel and I were faced with enemies.There were six on their side versus just Rachel and me.This surprisingly became a drama production.\u201c\u2026Kim Hajin.\u201dChae Nayun pointed her sword at me. Then, she discovered the artifact in Rachel\u2019s hands and widened her eyes.\u201cAh, she\u2019s holding an artifact! Who did you steal that from!?\u201d\u201cQuick, run away. I\u2019ll delay them as long as possible.\u201dRachel hesitated, then murmured at my urging.\u201c\u2026Yes, thank you.\u201dWith that, she ran.A white team archer shot an arrow at Rachel. \u2018Hmph. As if I\u2019ll let that happen.\u2019 I shot a bullet, predicting the trajectory of the arrow. The arrow was struck down by the bullet, and the archer stared at me with a shocked face.\u201cJunyoung and I will chase Rachel.\u201dTwo cadets from the white team ignored me and tried to chase after Rachel. However\u2026\u201cNo.\u201dYoo Yeonha stopped them.\u201c\u2026Stay on your toes. He\u2019s a tough opponent.\u201dWith that comment, she tightened the grip on her whip.I looked around the room for a moment. There were plenty of things to grab onto. If it came down to it, I should be able to run away with Parkour.\u201cWhat, you want to fight six of us alone? Are you crazy?\u201dChae Nayun asked. I shrugged without answering. For now, my goal was to buy time.\u201cWhat should we be afraid of? It\u2019s just one guy with a gun! I\u2019m going in!\u201dThen, suddenly, a warrior wielding an axe charged toward me. I fired several times along the predicted path he would take. With that, I was able to delay his charge for a moment, but Yoo Yeonha\u2019s whip and an archer\u2019s arrow flew toward me even more threateningly.I activated Bullet Time.Immediately, my sense of time slowed down. I could clearly see and predict the trajectory of the whip and arrow.I fired at the arrow and dodged the whip.However, something unexpected happened.The archer\u2019s arrow changed course because of my bullet, turning sideways to the chest of the axe-wielding warrior. His HP must have been low from a previous battle as he was eliminated on the spot.\u201cAh, fuck! Hey, watch where you\u2019re shoot\u2014\u201dBefore the axe-wielding warrior could finish speaking, he was blindfolded and muzzled. Uuuup, uuuup! It was a bit pitiful how he struggled. But the arrow struck his chest just now, which undoubtedly counted as a critical blow.Just to be clear, this happened purely by luck.\u201cHe changed the arrow\u2019s trajectory.\u2026\u201dBut Yoo Yeonha seemed to think it was my intention, as she muttered seriously.**On the other hand, Rachel safely joined up with other members of the black team with the artifact.\u201cRachel stole an artifact!\u201dSix members of Team Black cheered when they saw Rachel alive, but Rachel was having many complicated thoughts.Obviously, it was because of Kim Hajin.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRachel stared at the artifact in her hand. Kim Hajin had given it to her with a warm smile, and she felt like she could still feel his warmth from it.\u201cHaa.\u201dShe sighed.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have received it.\u2019She wasn\u2019t deaf. She knew what kind of rumors Kim Hajin\u2019s actions created, and she had heard about the rumors going around cadets. Until now, she was telling herself that it wasn\u2019t true, that it was only gossip.But with what happened today, she had to admit that Kim Hajin\u2019s feelings were real.Thinking about it, she felt she should have noticed it earlier. After he became her teammate, he always stayed near her, whether from a distance or close range\u2026The countless rumors she heard entered her mind once more.That Kim Hajin would confess to her, that he would serenade her\u2014However, Rachel shook off such thoughts.She felt that she wasn\u2019t in a position to share her feelings with someone. For her country, for her parents, and for the Royal Court guild, she had long since given up on such matters.\u2026But perhaps, it was all an excuse.She remembered what her mother and father told her in the past. That when someone she truly loves appears, she would want to be with him even if she had to throw everything away.But even now, she never felt such a desperate longing.She didn\u2019t want to give up on the countless values she put before herself.\u201c\u2026Ah, right!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the middle of a deep contemplation, Rachel suddenly remembered that she left Kim Hajin behind. She became frantic. Kim Hajin was currently fighting six people by himself!\u201cLet\u2019s go! We need to go save someone!\u201d\u201cEh? Where are we going?\u201d\u201cFollow me!\u201dRachel ran down to the sixth floor along with the other members of Team Black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fake and Real (2)Rachel returned to the sixth floor, other members of Team Black following suit. They asked what was going on as they chased after her, but Rachel only ran.\u201c\u2026What.\u201dWhen they arrived on the sixth floor, they saw three cadets lying on the ground. They were all from the white team, and their hands and feet were tied together, leaving them wriggling like caterpillars.\u201cUm, what\u2019s this?\u201dThe members of Team Black were befuddled by this bizarre scene. Rachel\u2019s head also drew a blank, but she soon realized what happened. She thought that even Kim Hajin wouldn\u2019t be able to handle six cadets at once, but it seemed she was wrong.\u201cUm, Rachel-ssi?\u201d\u201cAh, it looks like the situation is already taken care of.\u201dRachel replied somewhat in awe.At that moment, a spearman walked in from the other side of the lobby.\u201cAh, it\u2019s Shin Jonghak! Jonghak~!\u201dYi Kyungrak, one of Shin Jonghak\u2019s lackies, ran up to him. Looking at him, Shin Jonghak made a leisurely smile.Although he lost to Kim Suho, he avoided taking critical damage. After escaping to the sixth floor\u2019s residential area, he was catching his breath.\u201cNice to see you.\u201dShin Jonghak spoke to his team members, then was surprised when he saw Rachel.Rachel gave a slight bow in greeting, and Shin Jonghak greeted back with a light nod.\u201cJonghak, do you know what happened here?\u201dYi Kyungrak asked as he pointed at the tied up cadets on the ground. Shin Jonghak replied in a perfectly calm manner.\u201cI do. I eliminated two of them.\u201dImmediately, Rachel furrowed her brows.Although what Shin Jonghak said was the truth, Rachel thought he was trying to steal Kim Hajin\u2019s achievement.What really happened was that Shin Jonghak saw Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun fighting with some nimble guy, and used the opportunity to eliminate two cadets by ambushing them.\u201cKuhum. Then from now\u2026 I\u2019ll take command.\u201dShin Jonghak spoke as he glanced at Rachel. Rachel looked at the other members of the black team. They looked more comfortable with Shin Jonghak being their leader.However, Rachel didn\u2019t want to be with someone who would steal someone else\u2019s achievements. Not to mention, she was the one with the artifact.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave here.\u201d\u201cAh, you should come with us.\u201dYi Kyungrak tried to dissuade her, looking visibly wistful, but Rachel was resolute. She walked to the east emergency staircase, and Shin Jonghak watched her leave for a while before leading the black team to the central staircase.From then, the Mock Artifact Scramble resumed at a quick pace.Shin Jonghak gathered all surviving members of the black team and managed to steal two artifacts. Rachel also made great achievements through guerilla tactics.On the other hand, the white team protected many of their artifacts despite being chased around by Rachel. Kim Suho displayed outstanding leadership and might, safely transporting five artifacts to designated locations.Thanks to Kim Suho and Chae Nayun\u2019s performance, Team White came out victorious in the scramble. However, Rachel and Shin Jonghak also managed to get satisfactory individual grades.\u2026For the record, Kim Hajin, who miraculously survived Chae Nayun and Yoo Yeonha\u2019s joint attack, spent the rest of his time hiding in the fourth floor bathroom.**\u201c\u2026Huaaam.\u201dSeventh floor bathroom.Tomer finally opened her eyes. After waking up, she blankly stared at the ceiling for a moment. She was still a bit drowsy.\u201cOh right, the mission.\u201dShe then remembered her mission and checked her smartwatch.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dBut when she saw the smartwatch screen, she fell into a daze.Currently, it was 3:02 P.M.Thinking her smartwatch was broken, she rummaged through her pockets and took out the cadet smartwatch.On it, a more definitive truth was being shown.+Mock Artifact Scramble Results+[Final survivors \u2013 Black Team: 12 / White Team: 11][Artifact Possession \u2013 Black Team: 3 / White Team: 5][White Team MVP \u2013 Kim Suho, Chae Nayun][Black Team MVP \u2013 Shin Jonghak, Rachel]+White Team Victory+\u201c\u2026What?\u201dTomer slapped her cheeks, thinking it was all a dream.However, the smartwatch screen remained unchanged. Next, she tried slapping herself harder. But everything was still the same.\u201cNo way, no way, no way\u2026.\u201dShe hurriedly ran out of the bathroom.With classes over, all lights were turned off and the seventh floor lobby was pitch black.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dDevastated, Tomer dropped to the floor.**After the end of combat training.Cadets were sitting on a grass field. Some were frowning as they were treated with potions, but most were talking about the artifact scramble either happily or regretfully.\u201cJamer, is Jamer not out yet?\u201dAmong the cadets was the instructor Kim Soohyuk, who was calling Tomer\u2019s false name and looking for her.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dOn the other hand, Chae Nayun was sitting alone, picking on poor grass.There were many things she was unhappy with. Of course, the scramble ended with the white team\u2019s victory.But her fight with Rachel didn\u2019t come to conclusion, and even in a one versus six situation \u2013 though Shin Jonghak interfered in the middle \u2013 she was unable to defeat Kim Hajin.Most importantly\u2026 although she didn\u2019t act like it, she was concerned about what Yi Jiyoon said during the scramble.\u201cHmm~\u201dThen, someone came up to her, making an audible sound. Chae Nayun turned her gaze. It was Yoo Yeonha.Yoo Yeonha struck up a conversation with a grin.\u201cAre you bothered?\u201d\u201c\u2026What do I have to be bothered by?\u201dChae Nayun retorted bluntly at the sudden question. Yoo Yeonha rebutted with a nod.\u201cOh really? I just thought you were bothered by what Yi Jiyoon said.\u201d\u201cW-What, are you crazy? Why would I be bothered by that? I don\u2019t even remember what she said.\u201d\u201cBut still~\u201dYoo Yeonha stared at Kim Hajin. He was sitting with his team in a shade under a big tree. In other words, he was with Rachel.Yoo Yeonha spoke straightforwardly.\u201cAt this rate, he might get taken away.\u201d\u201cWh, what? Taken away? Can you stop spouting shit. He was never mine in the first place.\u201dEven though she said that, her actions clearly contradicted her words, her fists clenched and shook slightly. Yoo Yeonha looked at her for a moment, then continued speaking.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe in those rumors either, but he might be searching for someone else because you keep pushing him away.\u201dThen, Chae Nayun\u2019s gaze slowly turned toward Kim Hajin. She saw Rachel next to him.Chae Nayun furrowed her brows and looked away.\u201c\u2026If his feelings change that easily, he isn\u2019t my type to begin with.\u201d\u201cPft.\u201dYoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Chae Nayun\u2019s self-justifying excuse. Chae Nayun seemed to want to strike back, but Yoo Yeonha continued talking first.\u201cNayun.\u201d\u201cWhat now?\u201d\u201cBetween Kim Suho and Kim Hajin, who is it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2014! It\u2019s not like that!\u201dChae Nayun shouted with a reddened face. Gazes of nearby cadets fell on them, but Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t stop laughing.\u201cThen is it Jonghak?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dShe reacted much colder than last time. Shin Jonghak was clearly out of the picture. Somewhat relieved, Yoo Yeonha blurted out feeling a bit bitter.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m jealous.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cI have no one, but you get to choose from three.\u201d\u201cUeek.\u201dChae Nayun simply shook her head, not bothering to answer Yoo Yeonha.It was then.Shin Jonghak approached them, wagging his butt.After getting nine eliminations and stealing two artifacts in this Mock Artifact Scramble, his mood was through the roof.\u201cYo~ Chae Nayun.\u201d\u201cOh, Shin Jonghak. Your team lost, how do you feel?\u201dChae Nayun snickered as she made fun of him. However, Shin Jonghak was satisfied with being the MVP of his team, so he rebutted leisurely.\u201cIt was inevitable. You were in the white team.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201dAt that moment, Tomer walked out of the excavation site. Chae Nayun glanced over as well. Kim Soohyuk was approaching her with a scary expression.\u201cJamer, why did you come out so late?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI checked your smartwatch GPS, and it looks like you stayed in the seventh floor bathroom the entire time.\u201dFor some reason, Tomer looked completely lost as she couldn\u2019t even reply quickly.**Once the scramble ended, I returned to my room. My body was aching all over the place. Perhaps I should have killed myself during the scramble. Because I didn\u2019t write about the Mock Artifact Scramble in detail, I stayed until the end to see how everything panned out, but I only ended up fatigued.\u201cHajin~ Hajin, Hajin~\u201dBut the fatigue melted away when Evandel ran up to me with a bright smile. I held her up and looked around the room. Nightingale, crow-tit, dog, cat\u2026 Evandel made all sorts of animals.\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget to keep them inside the room, right?\u201d\u201cUn!\u201dEvandel replied energetically as she checked my hands and pockets. However, I didn\u2019t bring anything back. Next, she peeked over my shoulder and even checked my back. There wasn\u2019t any food there either.Evandel gave me a confused look.\u201cHajin, you didn\u2019t bring anything\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 sorry. I was tired, so I forgot.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dEvandel closed her mouth. Her sparkling eyes became filled with disappointment and betrayal, and began to tear up. I stopped her from crying with just one sentence.\u201cI ordered chicken and pizza. It\u2019ll arrive soon.\u201dEvandel\u2019s expression immediately brightened up.\u201cAha~ I see~ I see~\u201dOf course, it was a lie. I would have to order them while I pretend to take a dump.\u201cI need to use the bathroom.\u201dI put Evandel down and walked into the bathroom. Sitting down on the toilet, I ordered a chicken and pizza set.Then, I checked the most recent news.\u201c\u2026Oh!\u201dI exclaimed loudly.Finally, the news I was waiting for was trending on the front page.[New guild Packhorse Master conquers Suwon Devil\u2019s Nest!]August 14th came and went a long time ago without any news, so I\u2019ve been worried thinking that something went wrong.But after seeing this news, I knew once again that I was rich.I quickly entered the guild stock market.As expected, 1.5 billion won had turned into 10.3 billion won.\u201cBravo.\u201dI was happy, but also a little worried. Should I sell this now or later? The stock price was supposed to shoot up ten times, but currently it had only gone up seven times. Perhaps I could check again tomorrow.Of course, even if I sold everything now, I would get 10.3 billion won. That was enough for me to live the rest of my life doing whatever I wanted.I could do whatever I wanted\u2026 but the money would be gone once I returned to my world.\u201c\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, an odd feeling rose up from my heart. It was difficult to describe, but if I had to put it, it was a mixture of bitterness and heart-wrenching emptiness.\u201cAh, rather than that\u2026\u201dI slapped my cheeks and shook off these thoughts.Currently, there was another thing I needed to worry about.\u201cSinging, singing\u2026. Yi Yeonghan you son of a bitch.\u201dMy next biggest concern was singing.Until the end of the next midterms, no special enemies would infiltrate Cube, so I only had \u2018singing\u2019 to worry about.\u2026Yi Yeonghan, you fuck.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dI was thinking about what to do, when I suddenly remembered about \u2018art\u2019.I quickly accessed my laptop.[Art (1/3)]According to the laptop, I could create up to three Arts. Currently, Parkour was the only Art I had.However, I would be crazy to fill one of these precious spots with singing.Not unless I could delete an Art whenever I wanted.Just in case this was possible, I tried deleting Parkour.[Parkour Art will be deleted. 200 SP will be refunded, but you will not attain the level of the Art you achieved.]\u201cOh geez.\u201dFrightened, I canceled immediately. Thankfully, I found out that Arts could be deleted. Not only that, a portion of SP was even refunded. In that case, singing was worth considering.I projected up a hologram keyboard and tried writing an Art.===[Master Singer]\u2014Allows you to sing masterfully.===\u201c\u2026It\u2019s only singing. How expensive can it be?\u201dI tried hitting save.===[Master Singer] [Practical]\u2014Allows you to sing masterfully.\u2014Allows you to clearly imbue emotions in your singing.[500 SP will be used. Would you like to save?]===500 SP. 500 SP\u2026. It was more expensive than I thought. It seemed this Art made someone sing at an artistic level.\u201cI don\u2019t really want to sing that\u00a0well.\u201dI had no intention of shocking the crowd by being able to hit high notes. It wasn\u2019t like I planned on becoming a singer. 500 SP was too expensive to avoid a one-time embarrassment.If I had to explain it, I wanted to sound like a ballad singer, someone like Sung Sikyung or Kyuhyun.\u201c\u2026Is it possible?\u201dI tried to change the content of the Art.\u2014Allows you to sing beautifully.[150 SP will be used. Would you like to save?]150 SP wasn\u2019t cheap either, but it was acceptable. It looked like there would be at least 4000 spectators. Singing in front of such a crowd would net me 60~70 SP as well.\u201cYi Yeonghan, you son of a bitch.\u201dI cursed the source of this evil once again, then hit save.\u201cAh, aaah, aaaaaah. Oho oho, oho oho.\u201dI tried making noises as I pressed my neck.\u201cHyohyohyo, yohyohyohyo, yohyohyo. Yodelei~ yodelei~\u201dI couldn\u2019t really tell the difference.Tok, tok.At that moment, Evandel knocked on the bathroom door.\u2014Hajin~ someone knocked on the door. Hehe, I think the chicken is here.\u201dEvandel seemed to be drooling already.\u201cUh, yeah, got it.\u201dI quickly ran out and received the chicken and pizza.When I came back in, Evandel was sitting modestly in front of the kitchen table, wearing plastic gloves. I placed the chicken and pizza on the table, then opened it up nicely.\u201cMake sure to chew carefully.\u201d\u201cUn!\u201dThen, I went back to practicing. Ah, Aaah, aaaaaah.Woong\u2014Then suddenly, my smartwatch rang.[Hajin, you have to sing, right? Don\u2019t you need to practice?]Jin Hoseung messaged in our team\u2019s group chat.[\u314b\u314b\u314b Wanna go karaoke? What do you think, Rachel-ssi?]That was from Yi Bokgyu. I secretly looked forward to Rachel\u2019s reply. With my new Art and the hornflute I had, I was confident in being able to sing well.[I have to study\u2026 I want to go, but\u2026 I don\u2019t have the time \u3160.\u3160]However, it seemed Rachel was unavailable.\u201cDamn.\u201dThen there was no reason for me to go either. Why would I go karaoke with a bunch of guys?I replied that I couldn\u2019t go, then took off my watch.**Jeronimo Mercenary\u2019s office, located in the center of Seoul.Jain was currently staring at a monitor, wearing the face of the world\u2019s 58th ranked mercenary, Yohan Zestiops.\u201c\u2026This will do.\u201dShe was looking for a mission for an apprentice mercenary. The mission had to involve killing someone, but that person had to be an evildoer who deserved death.After finding a mission that met the criteria, she contacted her boss.\u201cYeah, Boss, I found one.\u201d\u2014What is it?\u201cAn Italian Mafia. He\u2019s apparently a Djinn. No, he\u2019s like a Djinn.\u201d\u2014\u2026Not bad.\u201cAh, but are you sure he accepted your offer?\u201dThat was the problem. Jain wasn\u2019t sure whether Kim Hajin had decided to join Jeronimo Mercenary.\u2014I received a positive reply.\u201c\u2026Really? What did he say?\u201d\u2014Mm\u2026 hold on.Boss went silent as she seemed to search through her message log.\u2014I got a message that says, \u2018I\u2019ll contact you soon when I have time\u2026.\u2019 Mm, I think this is a very positive reply.Jain felt a headache the moment she heard Boss\u2019 words.\u201cBoss, you\u2026 when did you get that message?\u201d\u2014The day I gave him our business card.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat was two weeks ago.\u201d\u2014Yeah, so he should be contacting me at any time now. So make sure you have that mission ready.Boss said what she wanted to say and hung up.Jain sighed from the bottom of her heart. Was it because Boss never experienced normal social life? Or was she like this naturally? In any case, she was too dense.\u201cTsk. I guess I have no choice other than to do as I\u2019m told.\u201dJain placed the mafia assassination mission in the \u2018confirmed\u2019 folder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fake and Real (3)\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dThursday, after end of classes.Currently, I was standing in front of the Dorm 2 entrance.Dorm 2 was the girls\u2019 dorm, so it was the last place I expected to visit.But I had no other choice. If I didn\u2019t get it over with today, it would be too late. Class Competitions were starting tomorrow, and once that was over, everyone would be busy preparing for the midterms in two weeks. It wasn\u2019t that I would be busy, but the person I was planning on meeting was.After taking in a deep breath, I walked into Dorm 2\u2019s pretty entrance.Not long afterwards, I ran into someone unexpected.Wearing comfortable clothes, she seemed to be on her way to the library. I greeted her.\u201cRachel-ssi!\u201dWhen Rachel saw me, she stopped in place and swallowed hard. It didn\u2019t look like she planned on moving from that spot, so I approached her first.\u201cAre you going to the library?\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cAh, I have something to do.\u201dI replied with a smile. Then, I examined her carefully.During exam periods, she looked a bit different. Her hair seemed more disheveled and unkempt. She seemed to be pushing herself because I was her competitor.\u201cOh right, you haven\u2019t been asking me any questions lately.\u201d\u201c\u2026I thought I should try to solve them myself before going to seek help\u2026 Also, Hajin-ssi needs to study too.\u201d\u201cOh really? If you\u2019re having trouble, you can always ask me. I\u2019m fine with it.\u201dIn response, Rachel nodded silently.I wanted to go with her to the library, but I didn\u2019t have time.\u201cThen you should get going. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dRachel trotted off. She seemed to be in a haste to get to the library. Did she want to study that much?In any case, I headed deeper into the dorm.My destination was a pavilion near room 201. Someone was waiting there by the time I arrived. I walked up to her. She seemed to have seen me too as she lightly waved her hand.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dYoo Yeonha spoke with a bright smile. Just like always, her casual clothes were black. Her white skin suited her black blouse and black skirts.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo, why did you call me?\u201dYoo Yeonha looked at me with eyes full of interest.The reason I came to her was simple.It was because of the ginseng I found when I went to Suwon with Kim Suho. It was a five-year-old ginseng, and I thought carefully about how to use it.I didn\u2019t plan on selling it as I now had more than enough money.The best use of it would be to produce medicine, but I didn\u2019t have the connections and equipment to do so. I tried using Stigma\u2019s magic power just in case that was possible, but it seemed two streaks of Stigma was nowhere close to being enough.\u201cYou made a pharmaceutical firm, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha flinched at my straightforward question. But anyone could have found out about it. Most people in Cube already knew that Yoo Yeonha was doing business.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been about two months. My close acquaintances all know about it. What about it?\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s pharmaceutical firm was destined to succeed.I had Hosup do a quick background check, and it seemed it wasn\u2019t going so well currently. Although she had the researchers and necessary equipment in place, she was lacking materials.It was understandable. For the current Yoo Yeonha, finding a proper ginseng digger would be difficult. Most skilled ginseng diggers already had exclusive contracts with giant pharmaceutical companies, and these companies were true giants that wouldn\u2019t flinch at Essence of the Strait\u2019s name.However, \u2018pharmaceutics\u2019 was a huge industry in this world, so Yoo Yeonha wouldn\u2019t give up.Eventually, her pharmaceutical firm would become one of the top three pharmaceutical companies. Thanks to the \u2018connections\u2019 Yoo Yeonha was always obsessed about, it would only take ten years.\u201cHere.\u201dI threw her the ginseng. Yoo Yeonha received it with a confused look. Once she identified it, her jaws dropped.With this, I hoped I could be considered one of her \u2018connections\u2019.\u201cT-This\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a five-year-old ginseng. Use it for research, and you can pay me back later with a high quality medicine.\u201dThat\u2019s what I said.The person in charge of Yoo Yeonha\u2019s pharmaceutical firm\u2026 if I remembered correctly, his Gift was \u2018Researcher\u2019.With this Gift, he never forgot a technique he acquired. I wouldn\u2019t have to wait long until I could receive high-intermediate rank medicines.Yoo Yeonha looked back and forth between me and the ginseng, then put the ginseng away.\u201cWhere did you get this? Ginsengs don\u2019t appear often in the market these days\u2026.\u201dImmediately after saying that, Yoo Yeonha flinched. The market she was referring to was Violet Banquet, a black market. She started to sweat a little bit, and I smirked.\u201cIt\u2019s possible, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, yes, of course. I\u2019ll even pay you back with interest. It will take a while though.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dI gave her a thumbs up. Yoo Yeonha stared at me calmly, then made a mischievous smile.\u201c\u2026By the way, have you prepared for the singing competition?\u201d\u201cYeah, I picked a song, and I went to a rehearsal this morning.\u201d\u201cThis morning?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t in class for the morning announcements.\u201dCube even hired professional musicians for the Class Competitions. They were all people with Gifts related to music, and they arranged the song I chose in under an hour.\u201cHuhu, then can I look forward to it?\u201dYoo Yeonha seemed to be laughing at the thought of me singing, but I retorted confidently.\u201cYeah, look forward to it. It\u2019ll go beyond your expectations.\u201dThen suddenly, Yoo Yeonha\u2019s smartwatch vibrated. It was a call. Yoo Yeonha glanced at her smartwatch, then looked back at me.\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019ll return today\u2019s favor two\u2026 no, threefold in the future.\u201dWhen I tactfully turned to take my leave, Yoo Yeonha picked up the call with earphones.But suddenly, I grew curious of its content, so I strained my ears. My Gift, Observation and Reading, activated, making me eavesdrop on Yoo Yeonha\u2019s call.\u2014\u2026Yes, I\u2019m in Daehyun hospital. Nurses are saying that Chae Jinyoon\u2019s finger just moved. I stopped by to check if it was true.When I heard this voice, my feet suddenly stopped in place.I quickly turned around and faced Yoo Yeonha.\u201cReally?\u201d\u2014Yes, but\u2026\u201cAh, hold on a minute.\u201dYoo Yeonha put the call on hold and glanced up at me. I asked without caring about being tactful.\u201c\u2026What is it for?\u201d\u201cUh, well, just networking.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 what\u2019s up with that face?\u201dI turned around without answering her.I felt a stinging pain on my temple. I pondered as I walked in a daze.Chae Jinyoon\u2019s finger moved.Of course, it might have been a mistake by the nurses, or even a simple convulsion. But regardless, this news made my heart beat harshly.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAfter walking for a while, I came across a bench. I sat down.I fell in thought, almost soullessly.The point the seed germinates.I needed to know the specific time.Now that my feet were on fire, I remembered the Book of Truth. I immediately opened it and asked.\u2018When will the Devil\u2019s Seed in Chae Jinyoon germinate?\u2019The Book of Truth didn\u2019t tell me the answer, meaning Stigma\u2019s magic power wasn\u2019t enough.I broadened the scope of the question and asked again.\u2018Give me an approximate estimate on how much the Devil\u2019s Seed in Chae Jinyoon has developed.\u2019This time, all two streaks of Stigma were sucked away.Then, the number 89% was engraved in the book\u2019s page.89%.Assuming that the seed has a five-year incubation period, I only had half a year left.Half a year.Six months.Before the end of winter and the return of spring\u2026 that was it.I didn\u2019t have much time.With a stiff face, I held up my smartwatch.\u2018When will you contact me again?\u2019Boss\u2019 message entered my eyes.**\u2014Cube\u2019s first-year Class Competitions begins now!The first-year cadets\u2019 long awaited Class Competitions finally began.The first day of Class Competitions started with a soccer tournament. Everyone from Veritas class went out to cheer for the eleven classmates who were participating. While most cadets were rejoicing at the fact that there would be no Phenomenon Realm Analysis class, the soccer match began.\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dThat was my reaction after observing the match for just twenty minutes.I was glad I wasn\u2019t participating.That was how intense it was. Although using magic power was forbidden, cadets were existences whose physical abilities had transcended those of humans. For these monsters who could run 100 meters in 3 seconds, it was impossible to hold a normal soccer match.The soccer ball flew back and forth, as did the players. I watched this wuxia world soccer match like I was watching a movie.Then suddenly, Rachel, who was sitting next to me, poked my shoulder.\u201cHm?\u201dWhen I turned around, Rachel looked at me and mumbled.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s singing\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cWhat song\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat song am I singing?\u201dRachel nodded. She seemed a bit worried, but also scared. Was she worried that I would fail? How kind.I replied with a smile.\u201cHave you heard of If?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like she knew. I couldn\u2019t blame her. If was a song released in 2008.Perhaps because I mentioned a couple real singers when I was writing this novel, \u2018Taeyeon\u2019 existed in this world as well. Naturally, her song, \u2018If\u2019, also existed.Although it was a song from a female artist, I chose the song because I empathized with the song\u2019s lyrics, specifically the line, \u2018I\u2019m afraid to meet because of the goodbye that would come in the future\u2019.\u201cRachel-ssi probably hasn\u2019t heard of it. It was released in 2008.\u201d\u201c\u20262008?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dI had to lower the key, but the musicians Cube hired made all the necessary arrangements. They even praised me, calling me a great singer.\u201cWhooa!\u201dAt that moment, the crowd broke out into cheers. I looked at the match and saw Kim Suho doing a goal celebration. Now that I think about it, the Class Competitions was a way to make Kim Suho shine.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThen, I discovered Chae Nayun sitting in the front seat, happily cheering.A part of me immediately felt uneasy.Did Chae Nayun hear the news? Did she know that her older brother would wake up in half a year?At that moment, Chae Nayun turned around and met my eyes. I gave her a weak smile, then turned away.\u2026Time passed by, and the 90-minute-long soccer match ended.Our class was the obvious winner.Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak scored three goals and two goals respectively, and the opponent didn\u2019t score a single time thanks to Yi Yeonghan\u2019s miraculous saves and Kim Horak\u2019s stalwart defense.**Outdoor competitions continued until 5 P.M. Afterwards, cadets moved to the indoor auditorium to watch today\u2019s final event, the singing competition.In the auditorium that had a maximum capacity of 4000 people, second and third-year cadets could also be seen.\u201cOh right, Class Competitions are only for first-years. That\u2019s why there are so many seniors here.\u201dChae Nayun, who was looking around the auditorium wondering why there were so many upperclassmen, finally came to a realization. Yoo Yeonha retorted lightly.\u201cYeah, our second-year seniors can\u2019t participate even if they wanted to, so they\u2019re spectating instead.\u201d\u201cIs Kim Hajin really going to represent our class?\u201dAs she said that, Chae Nayun looked around. Kim Hajin was nowhere to be seen. He was likely in the waiting room, and Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t help but worry.No matter how much she thought about it, Kim Hajin didn\u2019t look like the type who could sing well. He looked like a stereotypical tone-deaf person. Wouldn\u2019t he just embarrass their class?\u201cHe looked confident. He told me to look forward to it, so I am.\u201dYoo Yeonha snickered and turned her gaze to the stage.The emcee appeared at that moment.He exchanged small talk with the audience, then started the singing competition at exactly 6 o\u2019clock.The first on stage was Neilee, a female American cadet from the World class.\u2014I\u2026 chose a song called Promise.Neilee sang an R&B song called Promise.\u201cOh, I know this song.\u201dChae Nayun got excited as it was one of the songs she liked.Neilee met Chae Nayun\u2019s expectations, heating up the atmosphere with her explosive voice and vibrations.\u201c\u2026She\u2019s gotta be the first place winner.\u201d\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a great singer.\u201dKim Suho suddenly replied to Chae Nayun\u2019s mutter. He had approached her before she noticed.\u201cKim Suho? When did you get here?\u201d\u201cJust now. So when is Hajin coming up?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAfter Neilee, a Chinese cadet from Cultivation class named Jin Harim came up. He sang a song called \u2018Sad Day\u2019, yet another song laced with high notes.It was the same for the cadet after Jin Harim.Cadets chosen as their representatives all chose songs with high notes and powerful climax.The competition continued and eventually reached the ninth stage.\u201cAuu, my ears.\u201dChae Nayun and many of the cadets in the audience were growing tired of hearing the same kind of songs. It was then.Tak, tak.Kim Hajin walked up to the stage with resounding footsteps.He was dressed nicely unlike his usual self. His black jacket and jeans suiting him well, and he seemed taller than usual as though he had shoe inserts.\u201cOoh, look at Hajin~\u201dThe corners of Kim Suho\u2019s mouth were practically hung on his ears as he looked at Kim Hajin. Chae Nayun was dumbstruck looking at such Kim Suho.\u2014Please introduce yourself.The emcee told Kim Hajin.Until then, the audience was still noisy. Perhaps because the eighth contender sang too well, everyone was busy talking among themselves to pay attention to Kim Hajin.However\u2026\u2014I\u2019m Kim Hajin from the Veritas class.A single sentence by Kim Hajin silenced the crowd. The way his voice rang on the microphone was surprisingly pleasant.\u2014I prepared a song called If.\u2014If?\u2014Yes. I don\u2019t think many people have heard of it. It was released in 2008.Then, the audience began to stir.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c2008? Is it trot?\u201d[1]\u201cIs he an attention whore?\u201d2008.That was when first-year cadets were born. Hearing that the music was from almost two decades ago, most cadets seemed to think it was old-fashioned.However, Kim Hajin remained unperturbed and began.\u2014Then I\u2019ll start.The lights went off other than the stage light shining on Kim Hajin, and monotonous piano accompaniment rang out. Soon, Kim Hajin\u2019s breath melted into the piano sound\u2026\u2014If I were to go\u2026And the first line of the song rang out. That was enough. That single line scattered the audience\u2019s complaints away.His soft vocals seemingly embraced the auditorium.First line, second line\u2026. As the slow song progressed, the auditorium grew quieter until only his voice filled the huge auditorium.\u2014Because I\u2019m like a fool, and can only watch you from afar\u2026With his eyes closed, Kim Hajin recited the lyrics like he was savoring them. There wasn\u2019t a single high note or fancy technique. However, his impossibly beautiful voice captivated the entire audience. Heavy, delicate, sweet, and temperate; everyone held their breaths as they savored this moment.\u201c\u2026His voice.\u201dChae Nayun murmured in a daze. Sincere goosebumps rose up on her arms, while her eyes captured Kim Hajin\u2019s singing figure. His voice seemed to flutter in front of her, shining brilliantly to the point that she felt like she could touch it if she reached out just a bit.\u2014Because I\u2019m afraid of the sadness and hurt that comes after our meeting.The final line of the song was the nail in the coffin. A cold falsetto perfectly melded into the heated atmosphere. Even after the song ended, the audience was in a daze as though they just woke up from a dream.Soon, they applauded.However, Chae Nayun stayed still without any motion.The song no one in the audience had heard about was brilliantly perfected by Kim Hajin. Its lyrics were still lingering in her ears.\u201cThank you.\u201dKim Hajin made a bashful smile as he bowed to the audience.At that moment, his eyes met Rachel\u2019s. For some reason, Rachel\u2019s eyes were wet with sorrow.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018This music is pretty sad.\u2019Thinking so, Kim Hajin smiled lightly.But behind Rachel was Chae Nayun. When he discovered Chae Nayun, the smile on his face disappeared, and he turned around feeling a bit uncomfortable.Soon, he received an alert on his smartwatch.[You obtain 98 SP!][Luck bonus activates!

Worry (1)The singing competition ended, and the results came out before the lingering aftertaste of the music disappeared.Veritas class\u2019 Kim Hajin didn\u2019t get first or even second place. He got fourth.Although his choice of music and voice were great, how well someone nailed high notes was still used to grade someone\u2019s singing.However, Kim Hajin was undoubtedly first place in terms of cadets\u2019 topic of conversation. His performance was already uploaded and gaining hits on several cadets\u2019 social media.\u201c\u2026Ah~ it feels like I went to a concert.\u201d\u201cRight? Who was your favorite?\u201d\u201cKim Hajin, Neilee, and Harim. But Kim Hajin really caught me off guard. I heard he goes out a lot. Maybe learned how to sing at karaokes.\u201dCurrently, Rachel was still sitting in the audience, now listening to other cadets\u2019 conversations. She needed some time to organize all the complicated thoughts coursing through her head.Today, Kim Hajin showed a good performance. He didn\u2019t confess to her like many people were saying he would. She was having trouble sleeping lately because she kept having nightmares about it. She was glad that it was over now.However, the song Kim Hajin chose kept bothering her. His voice felt sincere, and the lyrics that said he wanted to get closer but was afraid of being rejected.It was a meaningful song.\u2018Perhaps he realized I was avoiding him. Now that I think about it, I\u2019ve been avoiding him too noticeably lately. There\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t have found out\u2026\u2019Feeling sorry, Rachel let out a small sigh.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dA strong voice interrupted her thoughts. Rachel slowly turned her head towards the direction of the sound.There, she saw Chae Nayun, who spoke as she pointed at the exit.\u201cAren\u2019t you leaving?\u201dIt was only then that Rachel caught sight of her surroundings. The auditorium was already empty.\u201cAh.\u201dRachel got up and began walking to the exit. Chae Nayun stared at her back with a strange gleam in her eyes. Then, she followed Rachel.It was already 10, and darkness blanketed the outside world.Rachel trudged forward with a face full of worries. Chae Nayun gave her sideway glances, then went ahead and joined up with cadets who were waiting for her.\u201cChae Nayun, where are you going next? \u2026Huaam.\u201d\u201cBack to my room.\u201dAfter retorting briefly, she looked around.\u201cBy the way, where did he go?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201c\u2026Kim Hajin.\u201dYoo Yeonha replied to her question.\u201cThat person went that way. To the church.\u201d\u201cChurch?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dCube also had religious facilities to support cadets who came from various backgrounds. Most religious cadets were Protestants, and there were some devout cadets who wanted to become priests in the future.\u201cWhy a church?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 why, does it bother you?\u201d\u201cOh please\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun replied indifferently, but kept glancing at Rachel. She was walking towards the direction of the dorm.For the record, dorms were on the opposite direction of the church.\u201cWell, if you aren\u2019t doing anything else, I\u2019m going to bed. \u2026Huaam.\u201dShin Jonghak yawned. Today, he participated in three competitions: the soccer match, Dungeon speedrun, and duel. He was justifiably exhausted.Chae Nayun waved her hand as if to say, \u2018I don\u2019t need you.\u2019\u201cYes, please just go back and sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dYoo Yeonha meaningfully watched Chae Nayun\u2019s oddly temperamental attitude.\u201cNayun, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just gonna go back and play some games before sleep.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 you\u2019re not gonna go to the church, right?\u201d\u201cW-Why would I go there? I never believed in a religion my entire life.\u201dChae Nayun grumbled with an uncomfortable expression.**I sat down on the worship chair. The wood creaked as it embraced my body.I stared at the cross hanging in front of me. A dark light shone through the stained glass on the side. I turned my gaze sideways. The colorful art inscribed on the glass glistened in the darkness.This was the sanctuary of God.A holy place of confession for those who wished to confess and atone their sins.Sitting in this huge chapel and reflecting on myself, an unknown reverence and holiness embraced me\u2026\u201c\u2026or so I expected, but well\u2026 there\u2019s nothing special.\u201dI scratched the back of my neck. There wasn\u2019t some grand reason that I came to the church. It was just that in movies, main characters often visited a church when they were in anguish. Then, they would suddenly be enlightened to their direction in life!\u201cHaam.\u201dBut it seemed that only happened in movies. Or maybe, it was because I was an extra and not a main character. In any case, the silence was only making me sleepy.After making a big yawn, I stared at my smartwatch again.[You might have to kill a person.][But you will receive a hefty reward.][You won\u2019t have to worry about hiding your identity. As Jeronimo Mercenary\u2019s apprentice mercenary, we will guarantee your identity will be kept a secret. If you want, we can extend this guarantee even when you become an official mercenary.]This was the reply she sent in response to my message, \u2018how much will working there pay?\u2019To be honest, I wasn\u2019t short on money and only asked them that to play along with their methods. As Boss was socially inept, she only knew how to appease people with money.\u201cMercenary\u2026.\u201dAnyone could become a mercenary by law. They could even hold the position concurrently with another job. I heard there were many Heroes who worked as mercenaries part-time because they were chased on money.About 50 to 100 Cube graduates and probably half of the cadets who had to drop out would end up being mercenaries.It wasn\u2019t a bad choice for me.Chameleon Troupe participated in huge events like major artifact scrambles and the conquering of the Tower of Dimension. If I joined them, I at least wouldn\u2019t have to worry about straying from the main storyline.And most importantly\u2026 I would be able to kill Chae Jinyoon without difficulty. Even if he was a third-generation chaebol, 5 years had passed since he fell into a coma. The security around him should have gotten lax.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dBut still, the fact that I had to kill someone got on my mind.Chameleon Troupe would continue to kill many people.The only difference between Chameleon Troupe and Evil Society was that Chameleon Troupe didn\u2019t kill needlessly. They were no different in that they killed people and plundered their wealth.Would I be able to commit these crimes?I had doubts in this regard. This world was no longer just a world inside a novel\u2026.While I was pondering with my eyes closed, I felt the door creak open.I slowly opened my eyes.Footsteps continued slowly, and soon, someone sat down next to me.\u201cAre you Christian?\u201dThe voice echoed inside the church.I glanced to the side, then spoke with a grin.\u201c\u2026No. What about you?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026.\u201dKim Suho gazed at the cross as he answered.\u201cNo, me neither.\u201dDespite what he said, Kim Suho\u2019s eyes carried a hint of reminiscence.\u201cThen what\u2019s up with that meaningful gaze?\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\u201cYou looked like a devout believer. I would have believed you if you said you wanted to become the Pope.\u201d\u201cPft, it\u2019s not like that\u2026 I just remembered something from the past.\u201dThe past. Indeed, Kim Suho\u2019s past was a bit special.I made a small smile.\u201cYou used to go to a church?\u201d\u201cNo, but something like that.\u201d\u201cCatholic?\u201dKim Suho shook his head.\u201cBuddhism?\u201dThis time, he smiled without answering. He was saying no.\u201cMormonism? Zoroastrianism? Hinduism? Islam? Greek Orthodox? Confucianism? Taoism?\u201d\u201cHahaha, no, none of them. I wasn\u2019t really a faithful believer either.\u201dHearing Kim Suho say this, I threw out a sentence nonchalantly.\u201cThen what, is it a religion from another world?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dFor a moment, Kim Suho\u2019s eyes opened wide. I just threw a tiny stone in Kim Suho\u2019s heart, but I pretended to be oblivious and smiled.\u201c\u2026Please.\u201dKim Suho laughed and shook his head. Then he suddenly wore a serious expression and asked.\u201cBut Hajin\u2026\u201dHe asked with an unconcealable sorrow and reminiscence.\u201cDo you think there are other worlds? You know, like Lord of the Rings.\u201dTolkien died in 1973. As Outcall happened around that time, Tolkien\u2019s work stood firmly in this world as a timeless masterpiece.Without meeting Kim Suho\u2019s eyes, I looked at the cross in front of me.The crucified son of God entered my eyes.\u201c\u2026Outcall happened 50 years ago. Even without looking through Earth\u2019s history and just looking at anno domini (A.D.), you\u2019ll see that there were no monsters in this world for 1970 years.\u201dI faced Kim Suho once again.\u201cThen rather than saying that monsters suddenly appeared on Earth, it would make more sense to say existences from a different world crossed over to ours.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Suho was silent.I wondered what was on his mind.In truth, Kim Suho and I had similar circumstances. However, he came to this world when he was young and he even had another family. So unlike me, he didn\u2019t have to feel lonely. He probably only missed his family back home every once in a while\u2026Kim Suho\u2019s lips moved slowly.\u201cThen do you\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s part of the \u2018Otherworld Theory\u2019 presented by Dr. Jerus.\u201dI shrugged and cut him off.Kim Suho jumped slightly in surprise, then laughed.\u201c\u2026Ah, is that one of the theories explaining Outcall?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s being criticized for being completely groundless, but I think it\u2019s pretty convincing. Outcall happened out of the blue. I think it\u2019s stupid to use logic to explain something illogical.\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dWe became silent, but the silence didn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable. Then, I suddenly grew curious and broke the silence.\u201cOh right, are you using Misteltein well?\u201d\u201cOf course. Just like you suggested, I\u2019ve been going out frequently hunting monsters. I feel like it\u2019s gotten harder.\u201d\u201cHaha, really? Then in the future, let\u2019s go together to find better equipment. Oh by the way, you don\u2019t have an agent, right? I\u2019ll introduce one to you.\u201dKim Suho had to get stronger.He had to be faster than now, and he had to get stronger than in the original story. In a way, Kim Suho was the only method I had in dealing with uncertain danger.My goal was to finish the main story. However, it didn\u2019t have to be me that finished it.Even if I died in the middle, if Kim Suho could continue the main story\u2026.Kim Suho interrupted my thoughts.\u201cAn agent, huh\u2026 by the way, what could be better than Misteltein?\u201d\u201cWho knows? The world is big and full of artifacts.\u201dWith that as my final thought, I got up.I\u2019ve been here long enough, and I thought about my worries more than enough.\u201cI\u2019ll leave first.\u201d\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019m gonna stay here a little longer.\u201d\u201cSee you later.\u201dI left the church, leaving Kim Suho behind.**\u201cHu\u2026.\u201d3 A.M. It was now Saturday.[Victory]Looking at the text in front of me, I breathed a sigh of relief. I almost lost this time. If Random Consolidation System was just 3% lower, I would have been defeated.\u2014Wow, you\u2019re amazing as expected, hyung-nim. I went all out this time too.Jajangman messaged me.\u2014I almost lost. You\u2019re getting stronger by the day\u2026 I might not be able to win anymore after a couple months.I couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so I put on my helmet to play a match or two. Jajangman happened to be up, so I ended up playing seven matches with him.\u2014\u314b\u314b\u314b True, I\u2019ve been getting stronger quickly \u314bJajangman and I became close enough to call each other brothers. It was probably because I could act my original age (26) online.\u2014Why are you up so late?I changed the topic.Currently, it was 3 A.M. I already beat him seven times in a row, and I was getting sleepy.\u2014Oh, well, something happened today\u2026 I can\u2019t fall asleep \u314b\u314b\u2014What happened?\u2014It\u2019s not really something I should say\u2026 \u314b\u314bOh? From the looks of it, it was a relationship problem. Well, Jajangman was a teenager, so he was at that age. Half of his life should be about friends and the other half about girls.I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little jealous. After all, I had to worry about killing someone or figuring out a way back home.\u2014Tell me. I\u2019m 8 years older than you, so I have more life experience.\u2014Well, it\u2019s nothing big\u2026 just that, um\u2026\u2014Yeah?\u2014It\u2019s like\u2026 you don\u2019t really want it, but you don\u2019t want someone else to have it either.Aha, I get it. This son of a bitch, he\u2019s the popular type!\u2014So you\u2019re the one on the receiving end?\u2014Kuhum, well, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m experienced with giving things out~\u2018Why does he sound so much like a dick today?\u2019 I smirked and replied back.\u2014But why so suddenly?\u2014No reason, just that it\u2019s been on my mind recently.\u2014On your mind?\u2014Yes \u314b\u314b;; A little bit.\u2014Really? Well, you\u2019ve gotta have a reason, right?This was getting interesting.\u2014Yes, so um\u2026 that person sang in a talent show we had today. I think the song was aimed at me.\u2014Whoa\u2026A girl appealing to a guy with a song? She must be quite the assertive one. Or maybe Jajangman was just really handsome.\u2014Then can\u2019t you just accept her feelings?\u2014No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u2014Why not? What if someone steals her away? You might regret it later.This was coming from experience. As a 26 year old, I had relationship experience, and I knew girls who had crushes on me.At the time, I rejected them because I wasn\u2019t interested, but when I saw them going out with other guys later, I always felt a bit sour.I even remembered thinking, \u2018that girl used to like me\u2014\u2019, like a loser.\u2014Wow, you\u2019re saying the same thing as my friend. \u314b\u314b But I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll regret it.\u2014Of course you don\u2019t feel that way right now, but you will later. Plus, didn\u2019t you say that she was on your mind?\u2014Just a little bit. No, a tiny bit.Just a little bit. No, a tiny bit.From this message, I could feel that he was a proudful person who didn\u2019t like losing. It seemed he really was too young. You had to lose every once in a while to not regret it later on.\u2014But doesn\u2019t the fact that you\u2019re staying up late because of her contradict what you\u2019re saying?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014Yes? Uh\u2026 no\u2026 right?\u2014Trust me. I\u2019ve been through the same thing. From today, you\u2019ll suddenly only see her good points. Once she gets a boyfriend, it\u2019ll be too late.After sending that message, I waited for his reply.1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes\u2026No matter how long I waited, there was no reply.\u201cDid he fall asleep?\u201d\u2018Damn, I was wondering what he planned to do.\u2019I opened up the in-console clock. It was already 3:40. It was time for me to sleep. I hurriedly took off the helmet and fell on my bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Worry (2)Saturday\u2019s Class Competitions start with archery.Just like for the soccer match, a large crowd gathered at Cube\u2019s archery range. In this world, archery was a rather extreme sports, so many people wanted to see it.It was boring to just shoot a faraway target. What fun would it be to shoot targets 1km away, which ordinary people couldn\u2019t even see? In this world\u2019s world of sports, distance records had little meaning.Instead, archery sports came with all sorts of magic effects and summoned monsters that hindered the archers. These effects provided something to see for the audience, making the sports far more thrilling than simply shooting a target. Naturally, being professional archers came with great honor and wealth.\u201c\u2026Mm.\u201dAnd currently, I was sitting in the waiting room, watching the archery match happening outside.The rule of the competition was simple.Two archery representatives would stand in their own 75-meter-wide lane. They would both only have one chance, and the final score would be the farthest distance they reached.But one important thing to note was that the competition wasn\u2019t done in a tournament format. Because each archery match cost a surprising amount of money, representatives from each class would only participate in one match. In other words, there would be six archery matches in total, with two representatives going up per match. First place to twelfth place rankings would then be determined by the score they achieved when they were up.\u2014The match between Acceptance class and Cultivation class ended. Currently, the first place record is 320 meters, held by Eustass Haim.The fifth match came to an end.However, the first place record was only 320 meters. I would soon find out why.\u201cThe last match will be between Veritas class and Virtue class. Representatives, please come out.\u201dA staff called me over. Veritas class\u2019 representative was me, Kim Hajin, and Virtue class\u2019 representative was a French cadet named Baire Moren.Moren was someone I knew. He was one of the top sharpshooters in Cube. In the future, he would join Creator\u2019s Sacred Grace and constantly oppose Kim Suho. In being an opportunist, he would join Kim Suho\u2019s side in the end. In terms of pure archery skill, he should surpass Chae Nayun.I glanced at Moren and checked my Gift\u2019s proficiency grade.===\u25b7\u300cMaster Sharpshooter\u300d[Intermediate rank] [Spirit attribute] [Evolving \u2014 Grade 6] [Proficiency EXP 27%]===Its growth halted at grade 6, and its proficiency experience was low as well.Although I was slightly worried, I wasn\u2019t confident.In losing, that is.\u201cYes, the representatives are coming. Cadet Kim Hajin, cadet Moren, please head out to the field.\u201dI left the waiting room with my bow hanging on my back.**Noon.The sunlight shone down perpendicularly, making no shade.Chae Nayun was sitting with a bag of popcorn and a can of Coke.\u201c\u2026Why are there so many magicians?\u201dChae Nayun murmured as she looked around the archery range. She spent most of her morning loitering around the school, then arrived at the archery range with food when it was Kim Hajin\u2019s turn to go. She was surprised how many robed magicians were around.\u201cAn 8-star magician is coming today. They\u2019re probably here to see her face.\u201dYoo Yeonha pointed at the VIP observatory a little ways away.\u201cOh, Magician Ah Hae-In?\u201dAh Hae-In. She was a French-born 8-star magician, who became a naturalized Korean citizen at the age of 11.As one of the world\u2019s 300 8-star magicians, she was young and extremely beautiful. Although her personality was often described in strange ways, she was practically an idol to young magicians.\u201cI heard she was coming. So this is where she was. I was wondering why I could feel the earthquake from so far away.\u201dEarthquakes were the most common magic effect used in competitive archery. There were also effects like summoned monsters and plant traps, which Chae Nayun was looking forward to seeing.She couldn\u2019t wait to see Kim Hajin suffer.\u2014Next is Veritas class\u2019 representative, Kim Hajin, and Virtue class\u2019 representative, Baire Moren.\u201cOh, it\u2019s our class\u2019 turn.\u201dChae Nayun looked at the archery range with popcorn in her hand.Kim Hajin and Baire Moren came out side by side. They shook hands, then split off into their own lanes.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha observed Kim Hajin\u2019s movements with her chin on her hand.Just now, Kim Hajin got up on the archery plate. The way he walked and carried himself exuded confidence.\u201cLooks like we have nothing to worry about.\u201dThe Class Competitions event was a matter of pride for cadets. Furthermore, Veritas class was the favored winner because of its cadets. As a result, every time Veritas class lost, they felt bitter for a while because of the sense of pride and belonging they had with the class.In a way, it was similar to what Koreans felt when they lost in international competitions.\u201c\u2026By the way, what is he mumbling?\u201dAt that moment, Chae Nayun furrowed her brows. Yoo Yeonha turned her gaze to the two competitors.Indeed, Baire Moren was saying something to Kim Hajin.\u201cTrash talk, I guess? Baire Moren is supposedly sly and ill-tempered.\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201dYoo Yeonha rarely gave false information, so Chae Nayun believed her wholeheartedly.\u2018Now that I look more closely, it does look like he\u2019s provoking Kim Hajin. I see, Moren is a piece of shit.\u2019*VIP observatory, where Ah Hae-In was sitting in. To greet the honored 8-star magician, the observatory was adorned with all sorts of decorations and food.\u201c\u2026Grand Duchess Ah Hae-In, is that child your nephew?\u201dDuring a break, a 5-star magician who volunteered to be her attendant carefully asked.\u201cUnofficially, yes. Officially, I\u2019m the founder of the Ah clan, so I have no relatives.\u201dAh Hae-In grinned as she looked down at the archery range. A part of the reason she came today was to see her nephew. As expected, he grew up well. He stood out especially because he was next to some average-looking guy.The 5-star magician looked at Ah Hae-In in admiration, then spoke with a trembling voice.\u201c\u2026Ah, it\u2019s starting.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201dAh Hae-In placed her hand on an orb placed on a supporting platform in front of the observatory.\u201cI just need to continue doing what I did before, right?\u201d\u201cYes, you can start with a light earthquake.\u201d\u201cI can do what I want starting from the 350-meter range, right? Since no one managed to get to 350 meters yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, but the obstacles have to be the same for both lanes.\u201dAh Hae-In burst into laughter at the 5-star magician\u2019s admonishment. Then, she shot back at him.\u201cWould I be able to do that? Don\u2019t you know how much I cherish my nephew?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 ahaha\u2026. Well, it\u2019s not a test, but a small festival for cadets. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter what you do. Do as you wish, Grand Duchess. Cadets will feel honored just by having you participate\u2026.\u201dThe subordinate magician showed excessive loyalty.There was a good reason for it too. 8-star magicians were nobles among nobles, with only 87 of them existing in Korea. The title \u2018Grand Duchess\u2019 wasn\u2019t just for show. As Class Competitions had several events, offering a single archery event as bribe wouldn\u2019t cause much of a problem.In fact, if the Grand Duchess came to Cube as a guest lecturer in exchange for this favor, it would be a huge boon for Cube.\u201cIf you say so.\u201dSatisfied, Ah Hae-In smiled.**\u201cDamn.\u201dThere was a reason why the first place cadet only reached 320 meters.I only passed the 250-meter mark just now, but my legs were sore. It was because of the earthquake that just shook the ground I was standing on.\u201cWow, you\u2019re pretty good. I guess it\u2019s true that you have a Specialized Gift.\u201dMoren spoke from next to me. However, he looked relaxed. Naturally, I had some doubts about what was happening. It was a justifiable suspicion. The extent of obstructive effects were clearly different for when I was shooting and when he was shooting.\u201cTsk, you sure are relaxed.\u201d\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not you who just trained lazily?\u201d\u201c\u2026Ehew.\u201dHe kept provoking me with a smiling face, making it all the more irritating.I opened my eyes wide and stared at the observatory where the magician in charge of the obstructions should be staying.With my Thousand-Mile Eyes, I saw a Western woman using magic inside the observatory. Her red hair and white skin blended well together. Engraved on her black cape were eight golden stars, and some magician was standing next to her, flattering her.\u201cHm\u2026.\u201dI knew of one woman with such a setting.Ah Hae-In.Thinking about it now, she had some sort of a relationship with Moren\u2026 I stealthily turned on my smartwatch and opened my settings book.\u2026Aha.\u201cHey, your aunt is over there. Are you gonna go say hi afterwards?\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201dMoren\u2019s expression and voice were saying he was oblivious, but the corner of his mouth was slightly curled up. This son of a bitch definitely knew what was going on.\u201cYour aunt keeps harassing me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Are you making excuses because you think you\u2019re going to miss? Just hurry up and shoot, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dI raised my bow. Immediately, an earthquake broke out beneath me. It wasn\u2019t just an earthquake. Suddenly, hail began to hammer down from the sky.I was now in the 300-meter mark. It seemed a new trial was beginning.The hail struck my shoulders and fingers, and blocked my vision. It was cold and painful.However, my desire to win grew stronger.I focused all my senses on my bow and target.TANG!The arrow shot forward and successfully hit its mark.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201d\u201cWow, congrats.\u201dNext was Moren\u2019s turn. However, the hail falling on him was small and soft. If the hail I faced were like 228cm and 521kg hulks, the ones this guy was facing were\u2026 like Evandels.Moren hit his mark without difficulty.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn next.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe favoritism continued to escalate. I had no choice but to smile forcefully and keep pushing forward.In the end, I reached the 350-meter mark after a painstaking effort.\u2014Both sides have surpassed the first place record! From the 350-meter mark, the target will move 50% faster and the participants\u2019 turn order will change! In other words, Baire Moren will go first!Moren sighed as he raised his bow. It seemed he was nervous.I wondered what the next obstacle was.When I was looking at the lanes half in worry and half in expectation\u2026Huge vines suddenly shot up from the ground.\u201cWhoa! What\u2019s this!?\u201dMoren shouted in surprise. 10-meter-tall vines shot up as if to swallow the entire lane. Among them, a few that were especially close to Moren swirled around him, then KWANG!They slammed down on the ground next to him.However, Moren remained poised. All archers cultivated patience and calm.Unless he stepped off of the archery plate, he didn\u2019t need to worry about being attacked by the vines.Not to mention, the vines were acting warm towards him. Almost like reeds, they only swayed back and forth. It was almost as if they were fanning him to cool him off.\u201c\u2026Ah!\u201dStill, Moren failed.Under the pressure from constant earthquakes and hail, he was unable to hit the target that got 50% faster. This was his limit.\u2014Ah! Moren regrettably misses his target!It was my turn once again. To be honest, I was worried. I raised my bow, swallowing my fear.Then just as expected, the damned vines became fiercer. They were swaying freely when it was Moren\u2019s turn, but now they were spazzing out violently.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI stopped thinking for a moment.Anyone could see the favoritism that was going on. But I could just tear through it as well. In a way, I also had an incredible backing in the form of Lady Luck.I nocked an arrow and pulled on the bowstring.Immediately, the vines became even more astringent, almost like they were just dumped by their lovers\u2026 I could feel their rage and agitation.Then it was time for me to get serious too.I activated Bullet Time. In an instant, the world slowed down. At the same time, the target shot up from a point 350 meters away.But no matter how I thought about it, I couldn\u2019t hit that target.The angle simply made it impossible.The target flew through the air, and the monster vines moved meticulously, completely blocking the path between me and the target.I was running out of time.The target could disappear at any moment.I tightened my grip and bit my lips.In a situation where I couldn\u2019t use magic power, would I be able to shoot an arrow through those vines with precise control?\u2026Just when I was thinking about giving up, a thought flashed across my mind.\u201cScan.\u201dI murmured silently.I scanned my bow and arrow. The numbers 40 and 41 popped up.The elasticity of the bowstring, the flexibility of the arrow, all concepts making up the two objects were strengthened.I opened my eyes wide and peered through vines at the target I had to hit.Accurately tracing the predicted trajectory of the target, I nocked the arrow leaning slightly to the right.Then, I pulled the bowstring.Shwiiik\u2014!The arrow flew forward, bending in a strange way. It flew right, dodging all the obstacles in the path, then curled left before flying straight like a bullet.The result was obvious.\u2014\u2026Veritas class\u2019 Kim Hajin! He succeeds on the 350-meter mark!\u201c\u2026The hell, how did that arrow bend?\u201dAfter watching my arrow in complete shock, Moren uttered with an expression of disbelief.\u201cDid you use magic power?\u201d\u201cYou think your aunt wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I did?\u201d\u201cThen what\u2026\u201dI chucked my bow in front of me. Now that I got first place even through such blatant favoritism, I felt I needed to make things clear.\u201cThis is the difference in our league.\u201dI turned around and checked my smartwatch.I felt something just now.100%.I had to have received a gift.\u201c\u2026I knew it.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were several alerts on the smartwatch.[You performed a curving arrow. Master Sharpshooter\u2019s proficiency EXP increases by 15%.][Low rank Gift, Curve Shot, has been added to Master Sharpshooter.]===\u25a1Curve Shot\u2014Long ranged attacks will curve depending on the shooter\u2019s will. (The extent of curving will change depending on the Gift\u2019s grade and the type of weapon.)===\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe corner of my mouth twitched.Curve Shot.Another low rank Gift got added to Master Sharpshooter.To reiterate, my Gift\u2019s strongest point was its scope of use. Proficiency gained by using a gun could be used on a bow. Likewise, a Gift obtained by using a bow could be used with a gun.In other words, I was now able to shoot curving bullets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Initiation (1)Ordinary people might not have seen what happened due to being blindsided by the angle.The vines filling up the sky were overwhelmingly big, and Kim Hajin\u2019s arrow was like a needle in comparison.However, every cadet could see what happened. Kim Hajin\u2019s arrow had clearly curved.In a way, it was a common sight. If it was a magic arrow, that is.However, magic power wasn\u2019t involved in Kim Hajin\u2019s archery.As such, they could hardly believe his arrow\u2019s flight path even after seeing it with their own eyes. Rather than an arrow, it was more like a well-trained raptor, cutting through the tiny gap between the vines and chomping down on its prey.\u201cWhooa!\u201dAt that moment, Chae Nayun felt a catharsis and squeezed the popcorn bag in her hand. Popcorn shot out of the crumpled bag and fell on the front seat like hail.\u201cAh, fuck, what is it!?\u201d\u201cFucking hell, who did\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s Nayun.\u201d\u201cAh, sorry. You guys can eat that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? Oh\u2026 Uh, sure.\u201dThe cadets sitting in front of her began to munch on popcorn. Chae Nayun watched them for a moment, then turned towards Yoo Yeonha.\u201cHey, Yoo Yeonha, you saw that, right?\u201dHearing Chae Nayun\u2019s awestruck voice, Yoo Yeonha grinned.\u201cLooks like he didn\u2019t want to go easy this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh? What are you talking about?\u201dYoo Yeonha\u2019s eyes were fixed on the archery range as she muttered. Chae Nayun turned her gaze to the archery range following Yoo Yeonha.Ah. Kim Hajin threw his bow away just now. He seemed somewhat angry.\u201cThe favoritism was too harsh. It looks like he\u2019s quite mad.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 surprisingly, he has quite a temper\u2026. Oh yeah, it was too obvious starting from the half-way mark. Is the magician discriminating against Kim Hajin because of his looks!?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hu, huhum.\u201dYoo Yeonha barely held back the laughter that rose up from her heart. She didn\u2019t think Kim Hajin was that ugly, but it was true that he was uglier than Moren.\u201cIt\u2019s not because of his looks. Grand Duchess Ah Hae-In must have intervened. Moren is her nephew.\u201dAh Hae-In was the greatest expert of summoning magic, a Master rank magician who was bestowed the title \u2018One Man Army\u2019 by the Magic Tower Association. She could apparently summon and control seven high rank monsters. As most high rank monsters had intelligence, it was difficult to even estimate how amazing she was.\u201cDidn\u2019t Grand Duchess Ah Hae-In become a naturalized Korean citizen a long time ago? How can she have relatives?\u201d\u201cMoren is her old relative. Her older sister still has French citizenship. Moren is her older sister\u2019s son.\u201dGrand Duchess Ah Hae-In was a celebrity who proudly claimed an S-rank grade on Yoo Yeonha\u2019s talent book. Naturally, Yoo Yeonha knew all about Ah Hae-In\u2019s family background.\u201c\u2026How do you know all this?\u201dThat was what Chae Nayun wanted to know. As far as she was aware, there was nothing Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t know when it came to people.\u201cYou should take some time to study too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too lazy.\u201dChae Nayun retorted briefly, then stared at Kim Hajin. The judge asked Kim Hajin if he wanted to participate in the 375-meter range, but Kim Hajin shook his head. Then, he turned towards the crowd.At that moment, their eyes met.Kim Hajin looked at Chae Nayun. Although he quickly averted his gaze, Chae Nayun still received an odd feeling.\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe carefully placed her hand over her heart. It was beating a bit differently than usual. Chae Nayun couldn\u2019t help but remember what her teacher told her.That she would begin to only see his good points\u2026\u201cNo way, I\u2019m not crazy\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun laughed it off.Then, the host of the competition shouted loudly.\u2014Veritas class\u2019 Kim Hajin succeeds at the 350-meter mark, achieving the first place record!Clap, clap, clap\u2014 The competition ended with the applauses from the crowd.But when Chae Nayun was about to go back, she saw Kim Suho heading to the waiting room.Chae Nayun asked Yoo Yeonha.\u201cHey Yeonha, wanna go to the waiting room?\u201d\u201cNo~\u201dYoo Yeonha stretched and got up.\u201cI\u2019m busy. I have to go work.\u201dShe had many things to do today. The analysis of the ginseng Kim Hajin invested would arrive in the afternoon, and there was also a meeting planned for Falling Blossom.In this meeting, she hoped to gain even a hint on Kim Hajin\u2019s past. That way, she would be able to repay her gratitude at least somewhat.\u201cHow do you have so much work as a cadet?\u201d\u201cI know right~?\u201dAfter replying quietly, she began to head back to her dorm.\u201c\u2026.\u201dWaiting room, dorm, waiting room, dorm.Chae Nayun hesitated between the two, and in the end, she sighed and began walking back to her dorm.**\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dThe archery competition was now over. Currently, the 5-star magician was at a loss for words.Even with an incredible level of favoritism shown towards Baire Moren, it was Kim Hajin who came out victorious.In that case, how was he supposed to react?Even he wasn\u2019t so audacious as to say, \u2018I\u2019ll punish that cadet for beating Grand Duchess\u2019 nephew\u2014!\u2019\u201cPft.\u201dBut contrary to his expectations, Ah Hae-In was full of smiles.\u201cWhy are you so scared? It\u2019s only natural that my nephew would lose against someone like him.\u201dOnly then did the 5-star magician\u2019s throat clear.\u201cHa, haha\u2026 is, is that so?\u201d\u201cOf course. Anyways, I\u2019m jealous. That\u2019s what a Specialized Gift is?\u201dWhen she was young, becoming a Hero was her dream. However, no matter how much effort she put in, her body wouldn\u2019t develop. Her body and Gift were only specialized for magic, leaving her with no choice but to become a magician.\u201cTell my nephew I want to see him. I want to take him out for lunch to console him.\u201d\u201cYes, understood.\u201dAh Hae-In got up from her seat. The 5-star magician bowed as he glanced up at her.She barely passed 164cm thanks to the kill heels hidden under her cape, but her real height was only 151cm (there was a rumor that she was even shorter, and that her official height was the result of her tiptoeing during her physical measurements). Furthermore, her small face lacked even a single wrinkle, and her eyes were sparkly like a child\u2019s.The 5-star magician secretly had doubts.What sane person would believe Ah Hae-In to be 30 years old? What sane person would connect her appearance to her title, One Man Army, without hesitation?Weren\u2019t most Caucasians tall? Why was the Grand Duchess so short? Even the 5-star magician\u2019s fourth grade son seemed taller than her.\u2026It was then.Ah Hae-In suddenly turned around. She stabbed at the magician\u2019s heart with sharp eyes that she never showed before.\u201cWhat did you just think?\u201d\u201cY-Yes? Ah, n-nothing. I just thought the golden stars on your cape were beautiful\u2026.\u201d\u201cTsk.\u201dAh Hae-In lightly clicked her tongue. The magician felt a mysterious chill. Even in reality, the magic power Ah Hae-In released from her body cooled the internal temperature.\u201cDon\u2019t stare at me when I\u2019m standing. I don\u2019t like it.\u201dAfter giving the magician a sharp admonishment, Ah Hae-In left the observatory.The magician stood in a daze for a while.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dThe only thing he knew was that the points he won by flattering her all day, even going so far as to mess with the final match, had returned to zero.**Sunday, 3 A.M.At this late time when children should have gone to bed long ago, Rachel opened her eyes in her wide bed.Her eyes hurt, perhaps because she shut her eyes too tightly trying to fall asleep.She sighed and raised her body.The penthouse room\u2019s wide space entered her sight. Her room was huge, but empty. She had no talents for decorating, so she left the room the way it was when she received it. The only things inside were the standard furniture, a couch, a bed, and a TV.The size of the room perhaps had something to do with how empty it felt.\u201c\u2026Ehew.\u201dLately, she was being wrought with insomnia. Of course, insomnia was a chronic disease she was suffering with ever since \u2018that incident\u2019, but lately, it became too severe.Every time she laid down to sleep, anxiousness and apprehension coiled around her, and embarrassing moments from recent days rose up in her mind.Especially the Mock Artifact Scramble.That was a class full of hurt. Even if Kim Suho was her opponent, she never expected to lose so helplessly.Furthermore, although her fight with Chae Nayun didn\u2019t come to a conclusion, she thought of it as her loss. After all, Chae Nayun had only switched to a sword a few months ago.If Kim Hajin wasn\u2019t there, Rachel\u2019s rising star title might have crumbled.Kim Hajin\u2026She stopped thinking there.Rachel turned on her smartwatch. She only had 37 numbers on her contacts. She had lived most of her life without friends. Still, she entered the one group chat she was in. There were 153 unread messages.[Kim Hajin you little bastard, you were amazing today. How did you make that arrow curve? \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b][I know right?

His voice was clearer. Should I go buy a Bluetooth radio tomorrow? Bluetooth\u2026 blue tooth\u2026 that reminds me of Rome\u2026 et tu, Brute\u2026.\u2019Rachel\u2019s random thoughts cut off, and she fell asleep.**Sunday. With a final Dungeon speedrun event, the Class Competitions came to an end.The first place naturally belonged to Veritas class, where all the top ranking cadets were gathered, but that didn\u2019t mean they won overwhelmingly.Because other classes scored the majority of points in non-combat-oriented events like gaming, drawing, dancing, and cooking, the difference between the first and second place was only about 30 points.In any case, Veritas class still won, and they held a big celebratory afterparty, sponsored by Shin Jonghak.\u201cYummy, yummy.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t participate and was spending time with Evandel at home.Evandel was munching on a chicken wing next to me as I examined a document.==Apprentice Mercenary Mission==[Difficulty: D][Reward: 300,000,000 Korean won or an item of a equivalent value][Goal: Assassinate Siemens, the advisor of the chief of Colaion Mafia\u2019s Southern Torino Branch.[Siemens is a notorious mafioso known for committing murder, rape, blackmail, and human trafficking.

Especially in Italy, the Mafia became much tighter after Outcall, and their unity rivaled that of a country\u2019s because of monsters lessening government crackdown.The advisor of a Mafia branch chief\u2026 he had to be at least as strong as a low rank grade 1 Hero.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cA Djinn\u2026.\u201dBut if he was a Djinn, I would feel less guilty killing him.Furthermore, \u2018assassination\u2019 was likely my specialty. Using the Desert Eagle\u2019s sniper mode, I could attack from at most 2km away. Though, I would have to fire within 1km since my attack power would plummet otherwise.In any case, I had no plans to immediately accept this mission.The world outside of Cube was the wild. Even if I fully prepared myself to go out, I couldn\u2019t I say I really was.\u201cLet\u2019s see~\u201d[Physique (0/3)]For now, I planned on creating this so-called Physique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Initiation (2)Physique.By definition, it was the innate physiological property or health-related trait of a person\u2019s body.The same definition applied to this world\u2019s meaning of Physique, making it somewhat similar to Gifts. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to call it the body\u2019s Gift.Recovering quicker, taking in mana better, having superior organ functions; there were all kinds of Physiques.However, the Physique I planned to create now was a little more complex.===[Magic Dysfunction Physique]\u25a1Magic Dysfunction\u2014Physique that prevents the body\u2019s emission of magic power, trapping mana inside the body.===Magic Dysfunction Physique.A body that can\u2019t use magic power.At first glance, it was easy to see it as an undesirable negative Physique.However, that wasn\u2019t the case for me.Since I couldn\u2019t use the magic power in my body anyways, I wouldn\u2019t be suffering any loss. Stigma\u2019s magic power was a different entity than my body\u2019s magic power.That was the important thing.I wasn\u2019t suffering a loss.So I could just give up on it.But objectively, being unable to use magic power was a huge flaw. In other words, this was a huge restriction. By applying a negative effect that served as a huge restriction, I could apply an equally powerful positive effect at cheaper cost.===Energy Conversion\u2014Mana stored in your body will not disappear; instead, it will be converted into energy and stored. Stored energy can increase your physical stats up to twice their base values, but will be used every time you move your body.===This was the positive effect.Simply put, my physical stats would increase up to two times if I just ate well and slept well.However, the stored energy would be used up with physical activity, so I would get weaker as the fight dragged on. Still, having my stats doubled could prevent me from dying from an ambush.I thought of this Physique to protect myself from my greatest weakness \u2013 ambush. I could only trust in my luck so much. After all, my stats were just too pitiful.===[Strength 2.570][Stamina 2.580][Speed 3.265][Perception 4.220][Vitality 2.670][Magic power 1.930]===Nothing increased over 0.2 points since a month ago. At this rate, I would only be in the 4~5 point range in 10 years. With those stats of a low rank Hero, there was no way I would survive in the main story.As such, this Physique was the best way to bridge the gap.Without hesitation, I clicked on\u2026\u201cOh, wait\u2026.\u201dI tried changing my Physique just to see.[Mana Affinity Physique][You do not have enough SP]\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me how much I need?\u201dI got my reply pretty quickly.[About 5500 SP is required.]\u201c\u2026Fine, fine.\u201dI changed it back to Magic Dysfunction Physique and hit save.[500 SP will be consumed. Would you like to save?]Because of the restriction of being unable to emit magic power, I needed much less SP than expected. With 500 SP, I would have about 350 left in my bank.Currently, my singing performance was spreading through social media like wild fire, raising my SP periodically.I hit Enter.\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dSuddenly, a golden light erupted from the laptop screen, and several messages popped up.[Your special stat, accumulation of luck, activates!][Golden characters rain down, forming words!]Then, a new low rank Physique appeared.===\u25a1Blessing in Disguise\u2014With a certain chance, a tiny portion of your stored energy will lead to a permanent stat increase. (the stat increase chance is affected by your invariable luck stat.)===\u201c\u2026The heck.\u201dI became absent-minded for a moment.This\u2026 it seemed like a weaker version of the \u2018Getting Stronger Everyday\u2019 Gift I thought of long ago.\u2026In any case, it was free so I had nothing to complain about. Even a 0.001 increase per day would be a net gain.\u201cNice!\u201dUnable to hold back my joy, I hugged Evandel who was munching on a chicken leg next to me.\u201cAk, what is it?\u201dEvandel continued eating even in my arms. Nom, nom, nom, nom.\u00a0She sped up, thinking I was trying to steal her food.**The week after Class Competitions.Cube suddenly became desolate.It was because cadets knew exams were coming up in two weeks.Cadets moved back and forth between the Fitness Center and the library with tired faces, and they looked even more dreary during class. Naturally, they were less energetic for team challenges.\u201cHuu.\u201dDays went by in this way.Currently, it was Thursday after class.I stood in front of Cube\u2019s Portal Station.My destination was Seoul.There were things I needed to bring from Seoul before the next main story began.While I was checking my wallet and cadet card in front of the Portal Station\u2019s automatic door, a voice rang out from my right hand.\u201cHajin, Hajin.\u201d\u201c\u2026Like I said, you\u2019re not allowed to talk.\u201d\u201cIt feels stuffy.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dCurrently, Evandel was inside a pet cage. When I told her I was going to Seoul, she threw a tantrum saying she also wanted to go, so I had no choice but to bring her along.\u201cI want to get out of here.\u201dShe transformed into a rather unique puppy. She looked like a short-haired Pomeranian, but she had long golden hair growing on her head. Because of it, she looked cuter and more high-class.\u201cI\u2019ll take you out once we arrive, so wait until then.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dEvandel whimpered instead of talking. I let out a dry cough and approached a Portal worker.\u201cOh? A star is here.\u201dThat was the first thing the Portal worker said.I tilted my head.\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cHaha, I was just listening to it. If.\u201dThe Portal worker laughed and showed me her watch.[Kim Hajin (Singing Competition vers.) \u2013 If.mp3]\u201cThere\u2019s an mp3 version of it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s extracted from the video. Many people downloaded it, you know.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 really?\u201d\u201cYes. You were great.\u201dThe Portal worker smiled as she wrote my name down.\u201cTake care. Though, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going with your pet.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, thank you.\u201d**===[Athenian Citizen\u2019s Obsidian Bracelet] [Magic Artifact]A bracelet with magic seals. Used by an ancient Athenian noble.I went to the Seoul Magic Tower and brought back the obsidian bracelet I left. The obsidian bracelet had a new magic seal \u2013 magic power reinforcement. It was similar in function to qi reinforcement.\u2014You will only be able to use it once, so only use it when it\u2019s absolutely necessary.That was what the artificer told me, but that was because he didn\u2019t realize the bracelet\u2019s Automatic Recharge function. Still, I was impressed with his honesty. I made a note to myself to recommend him to Yoo Yeonha\u2019s future Magic Tower.Next, I went to SH Agency\u2019s office. There was something I had to pick up from Park Soohyuk.When I went there, I was shocked by the scale of the agency\u2019s office.\u201cWe already have 11 employees and 5 hunters with exclusive contracts. Ah, this office is thanks to Lady Yoo\u2019s investment.\u201dPark Soohyuk spoke proudly. Lady Yoo was obviously Yoo Yeonha.\u201cThat\u2019s great. You didn\u2019t forget what I invested right?\u201d\u201cOf course not. You gave it in stocks. I\u2019ll multiply in tenfold and give it back.\u201d\u201cOho.\u201dI looked around the office in awe. The interior design was sleek, and there was even a caf\u00e9. It was also located in a good environment.\u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs. What you ordered is in the parking lot.\u201dPark Soohyuk spoke with a smile.I went downstairs with Park Soohyuk to pick up the bike I ordered before.\u201cOh, is that it?\u201dOnce I arrived at the parking lot, I saw a sparkly motorcycle taking up two parking spaces.\u201cBy the way, Hajin, where did you get this puppy? She\u2019s adorable.\u201dPark Soohyuk smiled like a dad looking at Evandel in his arms. Evandel was smiling brightly as she calmly leaned against his chest.Little did he know, Evandel was cuter in her human form.\u201cUh\u2026 try contacting a pet adoption center.\u201dI replied half-heartedly and examined the bike.===[Agusta Vigilante] [Masterpiece]\u25a1High rank Mana Frame\u25a1Weight Reduction & Reinforcement Preservation\u2014Reduces the weight of the vehicle and increases its speed. Reinforcement Preservation prevents the weakness to strong impact that would result from Weight Reduction.\u25a1Mana Booster\u2014Uses mana for instantaneous acceleration.===It was labeled as a masterpiece even though it was a manufactured product.It was worth its cost, but its size made it cumbersome to bring along.\u201cAh, Hajin, I have to go now. My employees are looking for me.\u201d\u201cOh, okay, I\u2019ll see you later then, Hyung.\u201d\u201cSee you~\u201dLuckily, Park Soohyuk had to leave. He put Evandel down and quickly ran off.Once he disappeared, I looked around the parking lot.As expected, there were security cameras.\u201cTsk.\u201dWithout any other choice, I picked up Evandel and got on Agusta. I slowly drove to a nearby alley.Then, I added a setting.===\u25a1Portability\u2014By using Stigma\u2019s magic power, it can transform into a suitcase.[100 SP will be consumed.]===Thanks to having Stigma\u2019s magic power be a requirement, I only needed 100 SP for the modification. A vehicle was something I desperately needed for the next main story, and also the \u2018work\u2019 I planned on doing.I hit save without hesitation.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201dI tried imbuing Stigma\u2019s magic power into the bike. The motorcycle then creaked and was dismantled. Then, it reassembled into a suitcase form.I picked it up by the handle.It was heavy. It had to be at least 20kg.But well, with my strength, it wasn\u2019t the least bit burdening.\u201cThis is great.\u201dHolding the suitcase in my hand, I muttered in satisfaction. Evandel stood on her hind legs and asked.\u201cHajin, Hajin, where are we going next~?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go eat. How\u2019s steak?\u201d\u201cSteak?\u201dOh right, she\u2019s never eaten steak before.\u201cIt\u2019s really yummy.\u201d\u201cYummy?\u201d\u201cYeah, but first\u2026 transform back into a human. I think it\u2019s okay now.\u201d**Seoul Cheongdam-dong intersection.Yoo Yeonha was walking down the street with her mother, Jin Yeojung, for the first time in a while.\u201cTake a good look. All this land will become yours in the future.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already thought about how to use it.\u201dThis cleanly arranged intersection was Jin Yeojung\u2019s property.She was one of Korea\u2019s top real estate chaebols and an extraordinary businesswoman who invested her rich farmer father\u2019s money to make billions of won. Not only did she own Essence of the Strait\u2019s guild building, she also owned the buildings of Essence of the Strait\u2019s businesses, like \u2018Essential Armory\u2019 and \u2018Essential Insurance\u2019.There was a reason why Yoo Jinwoong the Berserker was like a child in front of his wife.\u201cYes, I believe you Yeonha. You\u2019re not a kid like your father.\u201d\u201cDad isn\u2019t that bad. He\u2019s gotten better lately\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha suddenly stopped her sentence and sniffed the air. A delicious smell had entered her nose. She glanced at her mother, then slowly looked around the intersection.In a nearby alley, there was a food stand selling spicy rice cakes, sundae, and tempura.\u2018Ah, I know that place. It was even featured on a TV show for being delicious. I want to try it, I want to try it\u2026\u2019\u201c\u2026Yeonha?\u201dAt that moment, Jin Yeojung\u2019s cold voice rang out. Startled, Yoo Yeonha turned back to her mother.Jin Yeojung looked at the food stand Yoo Yeonha was looking at, and furrowed her brows.\u201cYeonha, don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t quit yet.\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, sssp, of course not. I\u2019m not a child\u2026 ssp. I already graduated from that a long time ago.\u201dYoo Yeonha shook her head nonchalantly.\u201cThen why are you drooling?\u201d\u201cYes? Ah~ my mouth has been dry lately.\u201dYoo Yeonha quickly averted her gaze elsewhere.At that moment, her eyes widened.\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dShe saw someone familiar.\u201cWhat are you talking about.

Initiation (3)I came to a steakhouse with Evandel. It was supposedly a famous restaurant and as expected, it was jam-packed with people.\u201cI\u2019ll help you with your order.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, can we have eight steaks in the most expensive order.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dThe waiter tilted his head. Evandel and I could easily finish eight dishes. Three for me, five for Evandel.\u201cEight?\u201d\u201cYes, and all in medium please.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 yes.\u201dAfter ordering, I noticed that other customers were giving us strange looks. Even though Seoul had many foreigners, it seemed Evandel\u2019s appearance naturally drew people\u2019s attention. For this reason, I didn\u2019t take off my sunglasses. That way, people would think Evandel was a child of a Western noble and I was her guard or attendant.\u201cHere you go. This is garlic steak.\u201dOur first order came out, a steak accompanied with garlic. Evandel\u2019s eyes glistened at the steak\u2019s savory smell and appetizing plating. I cut the steak in bite-sized chunks and gave it to Evandel.Evandel\u2019s hands trembled in excitement as she stabbed her fork into one.Then, a piece of steak entered her mouth.\u201c\u2026!\u201dEvandel quivered with a face of ecstasy. Afterwards, her hand busily moved from piece to piece.I stared at her silently, then spoke when I saw the chance.\u201cEvandel, do you think you could stay home alone for the weekend?\u201dEvandel, who was chewing on a piece of steak, suddenly stopped. She looked up at me silently. She wasn\u2019t chewing on the steak in her mouth and was only staring at me with a fork in hand.For some reason, I felt uneasy. To think she would stop eating\u2026. She\u2019s not going to cry, right?\u201c\u2026In exchange!\u201dI spoke up before I could confirm my suspicion.\u201cI\u2019ll buy lots of toys for you today.\u201d\u201c\u2026Lots?\u201d\u201cYes, lots.\u201dI was overflowing with money, so I planned on buying anything and everything as long as they could keep her company.Evandel looked at me, then nodded with a half-sulking, half-sad face. She stopped eating steak. When she was about to put her fork down\u2026.\u201cNext is the Tomahawk steak.\u201dThe waiter brought a gigantic piece of meat. It had an overwhelming size that was just as big as Evandel\u2019s head.\u201cUwhoa! What\u2019s this!!\u201dEvandel quickly regained her energy.*After eating at the steakhouse, we went to the New World Shopping Mall.At first, I planned to take her to the floor selling toys. However, Evandel fixed her attention on a strange place. Evandel stared at this place silently and didn\u2019t respond to me calling her.What caught her attention was a pet store on the first floor and a white cat sitting in a glass cage.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn a daze, Evandel exchanged looks with the cat. I also turned my attention to the pet store. Admittedly, the white kitten was adorable.Cat\u2026 I immediately calculated the size of my dorm room.A 60-square-meter room with two rooms.It was enough to raise a child and a cat.And well, I\u2019ve always wanted a dog or a cat as well.\u201cHajin, Hajin.\u201dAfter staring at the cat for a long time, Evandel pulled on my sleeve. It was easy to tell what her intention was.\u201cI want to play with Hayang.\u201d[1]Evandel pointed at the cat with her finger. She had even given the cat a name.\u201cHayang? You mean that cat?\u201d\u201cUn!\u201dEvandel replied with a bright smile. I glanced at the cat.Meow\u2014 When our eyes met, the cat raised its tail and meowed.I couldn\u2019t help but smile. I went on my knees and got on Evandel\u2019s eye-level.\u201c\u2026But Evandel, if we raise Hayang, what are you going to do about your ghost friends?\u201d\u201cGhost friends?\u201d\u201cYeah. They might fight.\u201dThere were ten or so animals that Evandel made.Evandel fell in thought at my words, then spoke resolutely.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure they don\u2019t fight.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really? Then, promise.\u201dI raised my pinky. Evandel moved her hand clumsily and promised me. I rubbed Evandel\u2019s squishy cheeks with my fingers and got up.Then, I went into the pet store and asked the employee.\u201cHello, how much is that cat?\u201d**Two days later, Friday 5 P.M., end of classes.Before I opened the door and left, I looked back.\u201cHayang, you\u2026 why did you bite this! Do you want me to scold you?!\u201dEvandel was training our new cat with a stern face. I wondered if it was possible to train a cat, but that cat cost 6 million won. It would only make sense for it to understand a few human words.In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if it could talk.\u201cEvandel, I\u2019ll be back soon, so have fun with Hayang, okay?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not having fun.\u201dEvandel corrected me with a glaring look.\u201c\u2026Uh, right, don\u2019t scold it too much. I\u2019m going.\u201d\u201cUn.\u201dEvandel didn\u2019t pay much attention to me and only focused her attention on Hayang.I felt a bit disappointed, but I also felt relieved.I left the dorm relaxed.My first destination was Cube\u2019s Portal Station.\u201cTo Seoul.\u201d\u201cYes, cadet Kim Hajin, confirmed.\u201dAfter arriving in Seoul, I took the Portal connecting Seoul to Torino.To take an international Portal, you needed a passport and a form of identification. I gave the Portal worker a fake identity and a fake passport, both of which were prepared by the Jeronimo Mercenary.As expected of fake identification created by Chameleon Troupe, they were extremely effective. The Portal worker didn\u2019t give me any suspicious looks, and I managed to arrive in Italy in just 30 minutes.\u201c\u2026Interesting.\u201dSouthern Torino looked completely unfamiliar. It was to be expected since it was a foreign country, and even in reality, Italy was a rather special country. The reason for it was obviously the existence of the Mafia.Italy\u2019s government were anti-Mafia on the surface but the reality was different.In my setting, Italy\u2019s Mafia weren\u2019t simple organized crime syndicates.They cooperated with the government if a monster outbreak occurred, and a few large Mafia families operated publicly, disguised as guilds.In a way, they were freedom-seekers operating within the boundary of the law.Of course, there were exceptions every now and then.In any case, the Mafia formed their headquarters in Torino and Milano, which was faraway from the central government.Important characters of these regions were the Colaion family and the Fermun brother and sister.The Colaion family was the biggest Mafia family in Milano and Torino, and the Fermun brother and sister were elite soldiers groomed by them.In other words, I was currently on my way to kill a member of the Italy\u2019s biggest Mafia family\u2026.Ah, no, this mission could have come from the Colaion family itself. After all, my target used his position to sully the family\u2019s reputation.\u201cLittle Apprentice, over here.\u201dWhen I was stealthily moving to the hotel, someone called me. A lethargic yet deep voice. I turned to the direction of the voice.\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201dThere, I saw Boss. She raised her hand without even a single change in her expression, almost like a child waiting for the traffic light to change.**Same time, Cube\u2019s martial arts training room.\u201cAh~ I\u2019m so tired.\u2019Chae Nayun let out a sluggish breath and collapsed on the floor. Kim Suho, who was sparring with her until just a moment ago, didn\u2019t know where to place his eyes. Because her training uniform became stuck to her skin from sweat, her breast area was being highlighted too much.However, Chae Nayun didn\u2019t pay any attention to it and glanced sideways. Yoo Yeonha was sitting nearby and pondering with a serious face.\u201cYoo Yeonha, what are you doing? I even went out of my way to find you a sparring partner.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha averted Chae Nayun\u2019s gaze, then replied briefly.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m just thinking about something.\u201dCurrently, Yoo Yeonha was thinking about last night. Why was Kim Hajin with that child, and who was she?A daughter? No, it was impossible for a 17-year-old to have such a grown up daughter. Then was she his niece? No, an orphan couldn\u2019t possibly have a neice. Then could it be that he\u2019s a\u2026 lolicon? No way, Kim Hajin wasn\u2019t such a person.\u201cEhhh? It doesn\u2019t look simple~ Is it Shin Jonghak again?\u201dYoo Yeonha flinched, hearing Chae Nayun bring up Shin Jonghak.\u201cW-What about Jonghak?\u201d\u201cUh, nothing, I was just wondering if you got rejected.\u201dYoo Yeonha immediately clenched her teeth. She felt rage suddenly rising up from her heart. Mentioning Shin Jonghak\u2026 she was annoyed anyways because he rejected her offer of studying together\u2026Yoo Yeonha blurted out angrily.\u201cOh right, Nayun, Kim Hajin says he doesn\u2019t like you anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about? Are you crazy?\u201d\u201cOh, is that true?\u201dSuddenly, even Kim Suho showed interested. Yoo Yeonha shrugged.\u201cOf course. He says he likes Rachel more now. You\u2019ve heard the rumors, right? I mean, even if I were him, I would like Rachel more than Nayun.\u201d\u201cW-Wha, what? Are you crazy?\u201dChae Nayun shot up. However, Yoo Yeonha wasn\u2019t intimidated and continued with a bright smile.\u201cI\u2019m just saying. It\u2019s not like it matters, right? You said you don\u2019t like him.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dChae Nayun was at a loss for words. She simply didn\u2019t know how to respond. After all, it was true that she said that.\u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dChae Nayun glared at Yoo Yeonha once, then sat down far away from her. Yoo Yeonha didn\u2019t look at her either.An awkward atmosphere descended between the two.\u201c\u2026Hey, guys, don\u2019t be like this. You were getting along until just now. Yoo Yeonha, do you want to spar with me? I\u2019ll help. You came here to train too, right? You too, Chae Nayun. Ah, where did Yi Yeonghan go\u2026?\u201dKim Suho, who was stuck between the two, muttered helplessly.**Italy, Torino.I took out my bike in a deserted alley. Boss seemed surprised by the bike that popped out of nowhere, as she rubbed her face filled with curiosity.I asked her.\u201cDid you come to help?\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be helping you.\u201dSaying that, she got on my bike. Standing next to it, I tilted my head.\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cCome, Little Apprentice. I want to go driving.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI was a bit dumbfounded, but I got on in front of her and grabbed the handle. Woong\u2014 The engine noise was soft.I left the alley and drove into the road.\u201cLittle Apprentice, let\u2019s go around Torino just once. We still have a lot of time.\u201dBoss whispered softly.\u201c\u2026Sure.\u201dI did as she said.===[Horse Saddle] [Antique]A horse saddle used by a nameless cavalryman 500 years ago.If you sit on this saddle, you will be able to handle rides better.===Driving was easy thanks to the saddle I bought in Clancy Islet. I glanced back when I had the chance. Boss\u2019 hair was fluttering in the wind.\u201c\u2026Tonight at 9, there is a fellowship party planned in Torino\u2019s Leolen Mansion.\u201dBoss suddenly spoke while we were still driving.\u201cYour target will serve as the party host. If you arrive around 8:30, he might be preparing for the party in the mansion\u2019s garden. That will be a golden opportunity for your attack.\u201dI carefully listened to Boss\u2019 advice.\u201cThere is a forest next to the mansion, and inside that forest is an abandoned church. That church\u2019s steeple is the perfect high-ground to snipe a target.\u201dHearing that, I immediately turned on the bike\u2019s navigation system.I searched for an abandoned church near Leolen Mansion, and the navigation outputted one result.I set that place as my destination and turned the handle. It didn\u2019t take long for me to get there. Although the road disappeared in the middle, my bike drove through the forest without problem.Just as Boss said, there was a church buried inside the forest.I stopped the bike near the church. The dilapidated church was covered in moss and vines, but climbing to its steeple did seem like it would grant a direct view to the mansion.I got off the bike and checked the current time.[8:10 P.M.]At that moment, Boss suddenly asked.\u201cLittle Apprentice, can I watch you work?\u201dMy answer was obvious.\u201cI\u2019d feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s no need to.\u201dBoss grumbled and got off the bike. She was about to leave, but suddenly stopped and glanced at my right hand and left arm.On my right ring finger was a ring, and on my left wrist was an obsidian bracelet.Her gaze was fixed on these two items.\u201c\u2026Oh right.\u201dI suddenly remembered. Boss liked pretty equipment regardless of its function. That was her personality. I remember writing that she loved sparkly items to death.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThen suddenly, Boss raised her head.Our eyes met.She gave me a somewhat envious look. When I stared back silently, she smacked her lips and spoke.\u201cWhat are those accessories? They look nice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a normal ring and a normal bracelet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay with the bracelet, but that ring\u2026 do you want to\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for sale.\u201dI gave a stern reply. Boss narrowed her eyes and leered at me.\u201cI never said I\u2019d buy it. I have many items prettier than that ring in my vault. For example, Persian King Darius\u2019\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m jealous.\u201dI cut her off and jumped up to the top of the church\u2019s steeple. As I got used to Parkour, my movements were smooth and nimble even in my eyes.I looked down from the top of the steeple.Boss was glaring at me with a somewhat unhappy look.\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d\u201c\u2026I was planning to.\u201dOnly then did she turn away and leave.I checked the time with my smartwatch[8:30 P.M.]Then, I peered at the mansion using the Thousand-Mile Eyes.It was about a kilometer away, a distance most Heroes could cover in 30~40 seconds. Factoring in the time it takes to react to the assassination and figure out my location, I predicted that I had about a minute.In other words, I had to escape in one minute.\u201c\u2026Huu.\u201dI took a deep breath and took out the Desert Eagle.Fusing with Stigma\u2019s magic power and Aether, the Desert Eagle transformed into a vicious anti-material sniper rifle.\u201cScan.\u201dRandom Consolidation System activated three times.First was on the Desert Eagle, then Aether, then my bullet.The numbers I got were 25, 31, and 22.\u201c\u2026Today\u2019s luck isn\u2019t that good, huh.\u201dEven with a slightly lacking luck, I was using a modified bullet. To erase the evidence that would be left behind on the corpse, I added a property to the bullet that made it vaporize after penetration. Since I also planned to use an ample amount of Stigma\u2019s magic power, a single bullet should be able to finish the job.[8:35 P.M.]I covered my face with the mask I brought and peered at the faraway mansion with the Thousand-Mile EyesAll kinds of preparations were done in the garden: waiters, champagne bottles, food, music\u2026Among them was my target.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026.\u201dI held my breath and raised my gun.I checked my target\u2019s face from a kilometer away. The target was a Caucasian man with a handsome beard and well-defined facial lines. Currently, he was shouting at a group of waiters.\u2014Andiamo! \u00c8 una mossa veloce, bug!I didn\u2019t understand what he was saying.But I had to kill him before the fellowship party began and the number of eyes watching increased.I placed the man\u2019s figure in my eyes and put my finger on the trigger.1.

Initiation (4)Paolo Bettina Fermun and Vanessa Jeriel Fermun.The two Fermun brother and sister were looking out of the window in Leolen Mansion\u2019s hallway. They could see Siemens yelling at waiters in the garden below.\u201c\u2026I hope it\u2019ll go well.\u201dIn truth, Venessa Fermun was the one who requested the Jeronimo Mercenary to assassinate Siemens. She did not want a dirty cockroach like him tarnishing the honor of their godfather.\u201cI\u2019m sure it will. They\u2019re the Jeronimo after all.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I think we provided too little compensation. What if they do things half-heartedly?\u201dTo the infamous Jeronimo Mercenary, killing a member of the Italian Mafia was a trivial matter. Venessa Fermun didn\u2019t offer that great of a reward either.Of course, Venessa and Paolo Fermun considered taking the matter into their own hands, but they quickly changed their mind when they realized how big of a risk it entailed.To the Mafia, killing a member of one\u2019s own family was the most heinous crime. It was looked down upon even if it was through proper procedures, and Siemens was even an individual who gained the trust of the branch chief.\u201cWhat does Uncle Ezio see in that man?\u201dVenessa muttered with her teeth clenched. It was then.She met eyes with Siemens through the window. Siemens looked at Vanessa with a lustful smile. The way his serpentine eyes scanned her grossed Vanessa out.\u201cTsk\u2026 I hope the Jeronimo will show no mercy.\u201dVanessa prayed inwardly.\u201cMay he burn to ashes.\u201d**\u201c\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t pull the trigger. It was because I saw a faint blue light surrounding the garden. If my eyes were correct, that should be a mana barrier, a defensive mechanism that blocked attacks from the outside.Of course, it would have been stranger if there wasn\u2019t any security for a Mafia family\u2019s fellowship party.Breaking that barrier\u2026 seemed possible. It didn\u2019t look particularly strong.Since the party hasn\u2019t started yet, they probably had the intensity lowered to save mana.The anti-magic attribute should be able to easily penetrate a mana barrier of that degree.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI poured almost all of Stigma\u2019s remaining magic power into the bullet, giving it the property of anti-magic.Then, I took a deep breath.Once I pulled the trigger, there would be no going back.With my hands, I would be killing someone who I didn\u2019t know to be human or Djinn.However, it was a resolve I needed to make.I needed to stay in this world for at least the next ten years.During that time, I would need to kill many people. These murders would be by necessity.As such, I needed to be more bold. My emotions needed to be worn down even more.I hoped today\u2019s experience would serve as the trigger.I clenched my teeth and placed the target in my eyes. Was he a human or a Djinn?I hoped he was a Djinn.But if that was the case, what was the difference between a Djinn and a human? Were Djinns deserving of death? What about humans? Was I supposed to hesitate to kill them? Also, was I trying to kill a character in a novel, or was I trying to kill a living, breathing human being?All sorts of thoughts emerged in my head, and my mind became chaotic.I closed my eyes, then reopened them. I cooled my heated head.I couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion to a problem without answer. I also didn\u2019t have time to distinguish between reality and imagination, and question my morals.I put my finger on the trigger and pulled it slowly. The trigger was pushed softly, then was hooked to the end with a click.I pushed the trigger through.There wasn\u2019t a loud noise, only the sound of the forest\u2019s leaves rustling at the raging wind pressure.The bullet that flew out of a muzzle shot through the air at an incredible speed.There was a tiny gap between the firing of the bullet and its impact. However, the target couldn\u2019t escape during that time.The bullet\u2019s anti-magic attribute crushed through the mana barrier, and the target who was standing in the garden\u2026 was shot dead with his eyes still open.**Boss watched the scene from afar. Kim Hajin\u2019s bullet shattered the mana barrier and pierced the target\u2019s head. The shattered crumbs of the mana barrier fell down on the collapsed target like snow.A white bullet, blue glass-like fragments, and crimson blood. The harmony of the three drew a beautiful picture, and Boss quietly closed her eyes.Crimson blood.Hot blood.The target wasn\u2019t a Djinn.Bodyguards in the scene quickly rushed up to the target. They guessed the position of the sniper through the target\u2019s collapsed posture and began racing forward.Boss opened her notebook. Kim Hajin\u2019s location was being displayed in real time. Currently, he was in the middle of running away. He quickly reached the city streets, then slowed down when he reached a certain point. It seemed he got off his bike.Boss began to run to where he stopped.One minute was enough.He was sitting on the terrace of a coffee shop wearing a pair of sunglasses and a suitcase on one side.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBoss felt a bit proud. Was that the attitude of a person who just killed a man?However, she soon realized she was wrong. His hands were shaking, and his forehead was dripping with cold sweat.Boss approached him slowly.\u201cLittle Apprentice.\u201dWhen she called him, his shoulders shook. Boss sat down in front of him and stared at him. His eyes were hidden beneath his sunglasses.\u201cYou did well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did I?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKim Hajin stared at her for a long time without a word, then spoke in a shaking voice.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good.\u201dBoss didn\u2019t have anything to say to him. At that moment, a staff brought over a cup of Americano coffee. Kim Hajin picked it up with shaking hands, and\u2026\u201cAak! Fuck, that\u2019s hot!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe stuck out his tongue as if to cool it off, then carefully blew on the surface before taking another sip.He looked fine from the outside, but it seemed his mental state was all over the place.Boss gave him a compassionate look.\u201cKuhum. Ah~ damn it. I ordered an ice coffee too\u2026.\u201dEmbarassed, Kim Hajin let out a dry cough. Boss nodded and asked back.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201c\u2026People say there\u2019s a first time for everything. That was it.\u201d\u201cRight, it\u2019s not easy to make money.\u201dBoss held the coffee cup Kim Hajin put down. Then, she unleashed her magic power and blew away the heat.\u201cBut Little Apprentice, money is the only thing you can trust, especially for people like us.\u201d\u201c\u2026Us?\u201dKim Hajin tilted his head, looking confused.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a family. We grew up without ever having a family.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKim Hajin seemed to fall in thought at Boss\u2019 words. He then nodded and replied with a grin.\u201cWell, I guess so.\u201dBoss liked his answer. She liked him the more she got to know him.Today was especially so.His bullet broke the mana barrier and killed the target. What broke the mana barrier was undoubtedly the power of anti-magic.\u2018My eyes weren\u2019t wrong. Kim Hajin will certainly become the silver bullet that will kill him.\u2019 Boss thought joyfully.\u201cOh right, can you give me the reward as an item?\u201dKim Hajin suddenly spoke.\u201cItem?\u201d\u201cYes, item.\u201dKim Hajin knew Boss had many precious and valuable items. Since Boss didn\u2019t know much about their market price, he knew that choosing an \u2018item worth 300 million won\u2019 would net him a rarer and more expensive product.Simply put, Boss was bit of a pushover. Kim Hajin was also aware of the incredible luck he had.Boss, who didn\u2019t know about Kim Hajin\u2019s thoughts, nodded after a little bit of thinking.\u201cUnderstood. I will prepare your reward myself.\u201d\u201cGreat. Then since I\u2019m done with the mission, I\u2019ll go back now. Have a nice day, Li Xiaopeng-ssi.\u201d\u2018If I knew it would end so quickly, I wouldn\u2019t have bought that cat\u2026\u2019 Kim Hajin got up as he muttered incomprehensible things.However, Boss grabbed his sleeve before he took off.\u201cWait.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cFrom now, don\u2019t call me Li Xiaopeng.\u201dBoss raised her head and looked at Kim Hajin.\u201cCall me Boss instead.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn that instant, a cool breeze blew past them. Boss\u2019 hair fluttered in the air, and Kim Hajin stared into her eyes.After swallowing hard, he slowly moved his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cGood\u2026 Huh?\u201dBoss, who was full of confidence, suddenly fell into a daze.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dBoss frowned.However, Kim Hajin wasn\u2019t fazed in the slightest and even spoke more daringly.\u201cIt\u2019s up to me to decide where I belong. Now is too early to decide, so\u2026 hahaha.\u201d**Late night.I returned to Cube. I felt drowsy, but the sensation of the trigger and the image of fresh blood shooting up into the air were still vivid in my mind.Feeling somewhat dirty, I walked along the dark road blankly.\u201cHuu.\u201dBefore I noticed, I was inside my dorm, standing in front of my room.When I opened the door using the fingerprint scanner, I saw Evandel and Hayang sleeping on the couch in each other\u2019s embrace.I walked up to them and stroked Evandel\u2019s sleeping head.\u201c\u2026.?\u201dEvandel opened her eyes narrowly. With a face full of drowsiness, she smiled sweetly. I held her in my arms. Evandel rubbed her cheek on my shoulder and asked.\u201cDid you bring yummy food\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dI had forgotten. I should have brought some Italian food.\u201cUun?\u201d\u201cTomorrow. We can eat it tomorrow. It\u2019s late now, so you should sleep.\u201dI went into the bedroom and put her on the bed. As the bed was Evandel\u2019s sleeping place, I slept on the living room couch.\u201cYou\u2019re up too?\u201dWhen I went back to the couch, Hayang was sitting straight and yawning. I smiled and lied down on the couch. Hayang looked at me for a moment, then hopped onto my stomach. After taking a big yawn, she curled herself into a ball.\u201c\u2026Hayang\u2019s surprisingly cute.\u201dI stroked Hayang\u2019s back and slowly fell asleep.**The midterms began. However, Cube\u2019s second semester midterm period was more bleak and desolate than the first midterm period. It was because entrees of reporters and family members were prohibited due to the trouble that happened during the last midterm.There were even rumors that Cube was planning to get rid of midterms entirely.Although things were going a bit differently than in the original story, I didn\u2019t care too much. Even in my novel, I glimpsed over the second semester, so I didn\u2019t know much of what would happen in the first place.\u2014Today\u2019s test was way too hard.\u2014Yeah, what was up with that hell-mode difficulty? Shouldn\u2019t we sue the professor?After the end of the first written exam, I could hear many cadets complaining.They were saying how the exam was unfair, but for a first place cadet like me, written exams were just days where classes ended early.\u201cHey, Kim Hajin.\u201dAt that moment, someone ran past me and blocked my path.It was Chae Nayun.I tilted my head silently.It seemed Chae Nayun didn\u2019t know what to say after her grand appearance as she fiddled with her fingers and glanced at me. After a little while, she finally spoke.\u201c\u2026Are you going to the library?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m going back to my room.\u201dThen, Chae Nayun\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not going to study?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dI retorted bluntly and began walking once more. Chae Nayun followed after me.\u201cThen um, you don\u2019t have study guides or anything?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dChae Nayun\u2019s shoulders flinched. In the next moment, she blocked my path again and stared into my eyes. Her eyes were a bit pitiful.\u201c\u2026Can you help me out? I bombed today\u2019s exam too.\u201d\u201cNow? It\u2019s the middle of the exam week.\u201d\u201cI can stay up and cram. Apparently just having key points memorized will boost your score by 10 points.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re better off asking Yoo Yeonha for something like that.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2026 had a fight with Yoo Yeonha.\u201dAt that moment, I received a message on my smartwatch.It was from Kim Hosup.[Hajin-chan! I found out who Agus Benjamin is!]Immediately, my eyes widened.Agus Benjamin, or his real name Fernin Jesus.Tomer\u2019s father had finally been located.[Where is he?]I quickly sent a reply.[Nowhere. He already passed away.]\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d[What do you mean? Can you explain in more detail?][He was living in a Korean retirement center until 4 years ago, which was when he passed away. Who would have thought? What a twist, what a twist.]\u201c\u2026.\u201dI finally understood why the Book of Truth couldn\u2019t locate Fernin Jesus.It was because he was already dead.[Got it. Thanks.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[By the way, Hajin, I decided to quit my job. I put in my resume at the place you recommended.][That\u2019s a good idea. For now, can you tell me the location of that retirement center?]After sending this message, I checked today\u2019s date.September 7th.The next main story was coming up. If I could deal with Tomer before then, that would be a great burden off my back.\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll buy you something delici\u2014\u201dIgnoring Chae Nayun who was murmuring to herself, I ran to the Portal Station.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Past\u201c\u2026Wow.\u201dMilano, Italy.Inside Colaion family\u2019s Leolen Mansion, Vanessa and Paolo were watching the CCTV footage of Friday\u2019s assassination incident.\u201cPerfection as expected.\u201dJeronimo\u2019s workmanship was flawless. Siemens was instantly killed, and the assassin disappeared as though he never existed. He had escaped from Torino, which was deep inside Colaion family\u2019s sphere of influence, without leaving behind a trace.\u201cBut what killed him?\u201dPaolo asked. Vanessa rested her chin on her hand and replayed the tape. However, the CCTV\u2019s low quality footage couldn\u2019t capture exactly what happened.\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 think it was a bullet.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dGuns were indispensable weapons even in the current era.Although they were called well-assembled toys compared to artifacts, in terms of market size, the firearm market was the same as the artifact market.This was because cold weapon artifacts were mostly traded between two guilds, two individuals, or between a guild and an individual. Alternatively, they were traded in auction houses or special markets like the Violet Banquet.On the other hand, guns were usable by even ordinary civilians, and high-class masterpiece guns were even capable of killing low-intermediate rank monsters.In other words, the firearm trade was much more active and frequent than artifact trade.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be anyone in Jeronimo Mercenary who uses a gun.\u201dBut that was the extent of guns. A tool for self-defense used by ordinary people against weak monsters.There was no reason for the powerful to use guns.\u201cBut it looks like a bullet no matter how I look at it\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow would a magic bullet pierce through the barrier? Anyways\u2026\u201dVanessa\u2019s expression stiffened intimidatingly.\u201cYou better keep quiet about the whole thing. Don\u2019t open your mouth no matter what happens. We know nothing of what happened, got it?\u201dThis matter was a secret they had to carry to their graves.Godfather Colaion cared the most about the safety of his family. He would surely be enraged by Siemens\u2019 death. No matter how much of a fool Siemens was, it was Godfather Colaion\u2019s unbreakable creed that the punishment of a family member be carried out openly.\u201c\u2026Of course, I know.\u201dPaolo nodded as if to ask why she would mention such an obvious thing.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHowever, Vanessa was worried. In movies, it was always someone like him who slipped up\u2026.Unable to trust her own brother\u2019s words, Vanessa even took out a \u2018magic contract\u2019.**[Sunshine Haven]The retirement center that Fernin Jesus stayed in was located in the outskirts of Seoul. However, its name and appearance made it seem more like a comfy resting place than a retirement center.I carefully walked up to the entrance and knocked on the door.Soon, the door opened, and a middle-aged woman, who was likely a caregiver, appeared. She looked at me and smiled. Just when I was about to smile back and introduce myself, she spoke.\u201cWow, it\u2019s been a while, Hajin!\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dCaught off guard, my head stiffened. A short silence descended as I felt like a hammer hit the back of the head. However, I quickly regained my composure.Kim Hajin, or rather, Kim Chundong.Chundong wasn\u2019t a rock, but a person. It was entirely possible that he moved around and did things on his own accord.Thinking about it now, this place was only 10 minutes away from Chundong\u2019s original house.\u201cAh\u2026 yes, nice to meet you. It\u2019s been a while.\u201dThat\u2019s what I said.Thankfully, it must not have been too out of character, as the caregiver reacted normally.\u201cYou must be busy with Hero training lately. What brings you here? Ah, come in.\u201dThe caregiver invited me inside, and I followed her in.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI took a full look around. The place was bigger than it seemed from the outside. In the living room were six people talking to each other as they played Go and Shogi. Then, they noticed me and laughed heartily.\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a year! How has it been?\u201dAt that moment, the caregiver asked.\u201cAh, you see\u2026.\u201dI hesitated to speak. I didn\u2019t know how to bring up this topic.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201c\u2026Um, it\u2019s about Agus ajusshi.\u201d\u201cAgus\u2026 Oh, that South-American man?\u201dI nodded.It seemed Chundong had some sort of a relationship with Agus Benjamin. I wasn\u2019t too surprised since Chundong\u2019s past was completely in the hands of the co-author. He must have done something to make things difficult once again. But as far as I was concerned, this situation wasn\u2019t too bad. The co-author probably didn\u2019t expect me to arrive here so soon.\u201cYes, I was wondering if there was anything he left behind.\u201d\u201cLet me think\u2026 I don\u2019t think he specifically asked us to take care of it, but there was something.\u201d\u201cA letter?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, yes, a letter. How did you know?\u201dMy eyes opened wide.A letter.Thankfully, it seemed the plot device I put in was left unchanged.\u201cWhere is that letter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in the memorial along with his ashes. Why?\u201d\u201cAh, well\u2026.\u201dI needed to think about how to answer this question. I knew nothing about Chundong\u2019s personality, but from the caregiver\u2019s soft gaze and the smiles of other retirees\u2026 I could surmise that he was amiable.\u201cHe and I had a promise.\u201d\u201cOh, did you? Right, you did like introducing yourself to retirees and listening to their stories\u2026 I think his ashes are kept inside Seoho Memorial.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dI bowed.After exchanging a few words of pleasantries, I left to the memorial the caregiver told me about.[Seoho Memorial]\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dIt was also my first time coming to a memorial. Like going to foreign countries, I was experiencing many new things in this world.I scratched my neck and walked inside.There were thousands of urns stored inside the memorial, but my Thousand-Mile Eyes could quickly locate the name I was looking for.Agus Benjamin, written in Korean.His urn was placed inside a drawer along with a letter.\u201cLetter\u2026.\u201dJust like the caregiver said, there was an old letter placed next to his urn.I walked up to the drawer. However, I withdrew my hand before I opened it.I already knew what was inside the letter. It shouldn\u2019t be me, but his daughter who opens it.\u2026But what if the content was different?Because of this worry, I opened the drawer and took out the letter. It was written in squiggly letters that I couldn\u2019t read. After translating it with my smartwatch, I saw that it was the same as what I created in my setting.Feeling relieved, I placed the letter back and turned around.Then, I entered Violet Banquet.In this situation, the Truth Agency could only tell its client one thing.[We have located Fernin Jesus.][The price for the information will be 300 million won.][If you\u2019d like to hear the answer, please complete the payment.]**Same time, Cube\u2019s penthouse.While Kim Hajin was reading Agus Benjamin\u2019s letter at the memorial, Yoo Yeonha received a report from Team 3 of the Falling Blossom.\u201c\u2026Volunteer work?\u201dTeam 3 reverse-traced Kim Hajin\u2019s past, and Yoo Yeonha managed to discover a new piece of information.\u2014Yes, from when he was 11 to when he entered Cube, he seemed to have volunteered often in orphanages, retirement centers, and nursing homes.\u201cVolunteer work\u2026.\u201dYoo Yeonha pondered.Being born an orphan, but realizing his talent and entering Agent Military Academy.It was a beautiful rags-to-riches story.If it was her, she would have thrown her shabby and ragged past into the trash.However, Kim Hajin didn\u2019t forget his past. In fact, he continued his volunteer work in order to not forget.Yoo Yeonha remembered seeing someone like him. Of course, not in real life, but in a movie.\u201c\u2026Hm.\u201dShe finally understood a few things. Kim Hajin was a cadet, but he often liked to leave Cube. Because of this, bad rumors about him had spread, but the truth couldn\u2019t have been more dazzling.\u201c\u2026Amazing.\u201dYoo Yeonha exclaimed in awe.Not forgetting his past and trying to find it.Not viewing his strength as a mean of gaining fame, but using it only when necessary.His way of life, which was faithful to his beliefs and principles, was something Yoo Yeonha couldn\u2019t help but admire, even if it differed from her own values.\u201cRather than that, isn\u2019t there anything more? Like about his birth.\u201d\u2014We\u2019re looking into it as much as we can, but we\u2019re at a complete standstill. There is no other trace of his past left.\u201cDig deeper.\u201dAlthough she was somewhat unhappy, she let it go.\u201cAnd next?\u201d\u2014An incident broke out in Torino at the Colaion family\u2019s mansion.\u201cColaion?\u201dYoo Yeonha raised her eyebrows.Yoo Yeonha was planning on forming a partnership with the Colaion family.Her goal was to smuggle artifacts.The Italian Mafia had many \u2018black artifacts\u2019, which were artifacts that haven\u2019t been reported to the central government. This was because artifacts dug up by the Mafia were prohibited from being exported, so that Italy\u2019s government and numerous guilds could buy them for a cheap price.What Yoo Yeonha wanted were such artifacts.\u201cWhat incident?\u201d\u2014One of their executives was assassinated. But because they think the assassin came from Korea, they are asking us to search for the assassin.\u201c\u2026Search, you say.\u201dYoo Yeonha pondered. Considering Team 3\u2019s full force, finding a mere assassin wasn\u2019t a difficult task.\u201cWhat do you think? Can you do it?\u201d\u2014It\u2019s not impossible.\u201cOh? And why is that?\u201d\u2014We just hired a rather useful recruit.Yoo Yeonha frowned. Because of her deeply suspicious personality, she didn\u2019t trust people who she didn\u2019t handpick.\u201c\u2026Is that so?\u201d\u2014Yes, I will send you his profile now.Then, Yoo Yeonha opened the profile with an unsatisfactory look.===[Kim Hosup]\u201417 years old, 168 cm, 78kg\u2014Agent Military Academy graduate\u2014Gift: [Superhigh Speed Network]\u25a1Connects his brain with a computer, showing incredible ability in information searching and tracking.\u25a1Search speed increases with higher computer specs and internet speed.===**Late night, Tuesday. I left my room and came outside Dorm 1.\u201cAh! Kim Hajin! Over here~!\u201dThe person who called me outside shouted as she waved her hand.When I stopped near her, Chae Nayun ran up to me, smiling.\u201cAh, is this it? The study guide?\u201d\u201cYeah, so stop texting me.\u201dI gave her a study guide she had been pestering me about. I wasn\u2019t the one who wrote it, as I just copied what I found by hacking Yoo Yeonha\u2019s personal database. Yoo Yeonha had a habit of saving everything she wrote.\u201cAh~ Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pay you back for this favor for sure.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to. Just study harder.\u201dI stared fixedly at Chae Nayun. Lately, Chae Nayun has been looking more and more pitiful. I just felt like helping her. I didn\u2019t even know what was right anymore.In the past, I wasn\u2019t able to look straight at her face when I thought about the \u2018day\u2019 that would inevitably come. But now\u2026 I just had to not be found out. Just like how I assassinated that Mafioso, I just had to kill him and escape unnoticed.But because of this thought, I kept\u2026\u201cOkay! But again, thank you sooo much! I\u2019ll go study immediately!\u201dChae Nayun smacked my arm, then ran off to her dorm, hugging the notebook I gave her.\u201c\u2026That hurt.\u201dI rubbed my arm as I watched her leave.Why did she always hit me so hard?*Because Cube was so empty during the written exam week, time seemed to fly by. Before I noticed, Friday came around.\u201cHey~\u201d1:30 P.M. after the end of the final written exam.Chae Nayun appeared in front of me with a bright face.She was practically living in the library for the past couple days. It seemed everything went well.\u201cThanks, I survived because of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u201cYeah, I must have gotten at least five problems I wouldn\u2019t have gotten otherwise. That\u2019s a big difference, right?\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dNext week was the combat exam week. Naturally, I was a bit nervous. My goal was to bring my ranking up to about 200.But what was more important was what came afterwards.The \u2018incident\u2019 that would happen after the combat exam.\u201cOh right, do you want to go there after the combat exam? It\u2019ll be on me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Where?\u201d\u201cHan Jung Gak. It\u2019s a really famous Korean restaurant in Ganghwa Island. You\u2019ve heard of it, right? It\u2019s just as famous as the restaurant you took me to in Paris. Kim Suho and you\u2026\u201dHan Jung Gak. It was the highest class restaurant I had in my setting. I was curious what the food there tasted like. It would undoubtedly be the pinnacle of Korean food.However\u2026\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cWhat, why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the time. You can go with Kim Suho.\u201d\u201c\u2026What, are you jealous?\u201dJealous? That was a word I couldn\u2019t just gloss over. Naturally, I frowned.I glared at Chae Nayun and snapped back.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cUh, fine, if you don\u2019t want to come, don\u2019t. I just wanted to pay you back for treating me in Paris\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201dAfter cutting her off resolutely, I headed back inside.\u201cAh, wait! Just the two of us can\u2019t go even if I wanted to! My dad will get mad if he finds out~!\u201dChae Nayun kept talking nonsense until the end.**The weekend flew by and Monday came around.The combat exam week had begun.The first combat exam was a team challenge.It had similar rules to the first semester\u2019s duels, but was done between two teams.\u201cTeam Rachel will be on offense, Team Yohei will be on defense!\u201dTeam Rachel was in the first battle of the day.Our opponent was Team Yohei[1]. Team Yohei\u2019s leader was Miyamoto Yohei, a top-class warrior from Cultivation class. Apparently, Yohei\u2019s ancestor was that famous Miyamoto Musashi.For the record, this wasn\u2019t a part of my setting.\u201cReady!\u201dThere were many spectators watching the battle. Of course, it was practically empty compared to the previous midterm exam, but many cadets still came by to watch. It was to be expected as Rachel\u2019s team and Yohei\u2019s team were participating.\u201cGet into formation.\u201dRachel spoke. We got into a formation we prepared for beforehand. The two warriors, Rachel and Jin Hoseung, stood in the front, and the supporter, Yi Bokgyu, stood in a protective position between me and Tomer.I raised my cadet handgun and spoke to Yi Bokgyu.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to protect me. Focus on protecting Jamer.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna go take their magician\u2019s head.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was about time for me to display my strength.And just as always, my strength operated by the principle of Strong Against Weak, Weak Against Strong.Now that I had Curve Shot, a magician hiding in the backline was nothing but a prey.\u201cWait, shouldn\u2019t you\u2026\u201dWhile Yi Bokgyu was worrying, the judge shouted loudly.\u201cDUEL, BEGIN!\u201d1.

Ghost (1)The team duel arena was completely different from the first semester\u2019s one-on-one duel arena.Unlike the first semester\u2019s Colosseum-like circular arena, the team duel took place in a rectangular arena that was 130 meters in width and 250 meters in length.As soon as the judge signaled the start of the duel, the arena transformed into a mountainous ground with rocks and shrubbery. They served as obstacles separating the two teams, but they helped me more than they hindered me.\u201cJin Hoseung-ssi and I will charge forward. Everyone else can slowly chase after us while supporting us from the back.\u201dRachel spoke.However, I jumped up to a nearby tree.\u201cUm, Hajin-ssi?\u201dRachel\u2019s confused voice rang out from below. I smiled and gestured.\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll support everyone from above.\u201dClaiming high ground was the job of sharpshooters.As Rachel also knew this, she nodded and entrusted me with the job.Then, Rachel and Jin Hoseung charged forward. I chased after them, jumping from tree to tree.\u201c\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, a sharp arrow cut through the air and shot towards me. I quickly bent my waist like a bow, and as the arrow shot past me with a narrow margin, time seemed to slow down.\u201cWow.\u201dAt my current light-bodied state, this level of dodging was easy to do. Because of my new Physique, my speed stat was around 6.3 points. I was practically a ninja for now.I turned to the direction the arrow came from. The opposing team\u2019s archer shot a second magic arrow. This time, I struck down his arrow with a bullet. Although the bullet disintegrated the moment it touched the arrow, it still managed to twist the arrow\u2019s path. The archer frowned.It seemed he didn\u2019t want to fight me.\u201cDaeyun! Handle their sharpshooter!\u201dHe shouted at a teammate behind him, then aimed his bow forward, where Rachel and Jin Hoseung were charging in.I also glanced at the battlefield. Immediately, I felt like I could hear a clear background music of freedom.\u201c\u2026The heck.\u201dYohei looked like he came straight out of a manhwa.Standing in the middle of the battlefield, he was biting on a tiny branch with his eyes closed. He looked comfortable and at ease, even with Rachel and Jin Hoseung charging straight towards him. In fact, he still had his katana in its sheath.\u201cRonin, be free and wild like the wind.\u201dBy the time Rachel and Jin Hoseung got in range, Yohei blurted out some incomprehensible words and opened his eyes.When Rachel\u2019s rapier and Jin Hoseung\u2019s saber were about to cut down Yohei\u2026 the katana sleeping inside his sheath flashed with a cold light.A quick-draw.A katana soared up in response to a rapier and saber. Yohei parried the two attacks like lightning and counterattacked with a beam of light. His sword was lighter than wind, yet fiercer than a storm.I watched the clashing of three warriors in a daze.Currently, Yohei was fighting two cadets on his own, with Rachel being one of them.Still, they were evenly matched. It was thanks to all sorts of buff magic and the extra magic power he was being supplied with by his teammate.It was then that I understood their team\u2019s formation.Yohei was standing in the frontline, a sharpshooter was positioned in the middle, and a supporter and a warrior were protecting their magician in the back.It was the so-called four-protect-one.Their strategy was to throw everything they had onto Yohei.Their sharpshooter was positioned in the middle to support both the frontline and the backline, while the magician was pouring buffs and magic power to Yohei.It was an efficient strategy for a defensive team.As long as the magician didn\u2019t die.And as long as there wasn\u2019t a hyena like me lurking around.I made a detour and looped around to the magician, who was being protected by two people.It seemed I wasn\u2019t talented in moving stealthily as their warrior discovered me.A muscular warrior with a buzz cut threw his axe at me. The axe flew like a boomerang, cutting down on the greenery around me, then returned to the warrior\u2019s hand.When he spotted me and the gun in my hand, he frowned.\u201cWhy is a sharpshooter here alone\u2026?\u201dWithout answering him, I fired a barrage of bullets.The warrior stabbed his axe into the ground without being flustered. When he imbued magic power into it, the axe grew big, and the supporter standing next to the magician also raised his shield and blocked the barrage of bullets.Meanwhile, I looked for the blind spots in their defense.Although their magician was hidden behind the supporter, I felt like I could reach him if I shot from above.During combat training classes, cadets wore special protectors that absorbed damage to their vital points. Obviously, it was to protect cadets from being severely injured. By design, cadets were instantly eliminated if their neck protectors were hit.At that moment, their warrior and supporter exchanged glances that seemed to say, \u2018you protect the magician, I\u2019ll get that sharpshooter.\u2019The warrior charged at me with his axe.I didn\u2019t particularly mind it. In an obstacle-filled environment perfect for utilizing Parkour, a slow warrior was unable catch up to me.I hopped from tree to tree and kept my eyes on their magician\u2019s position. Their supporter must have felt my gaze as he performed something quite unique.\u201c\u2014Conjunction.\u201dIn an instant, his kite shield multiplied and surrounded them.However, there were still gaps in their defense.By design, shields were incapable of forming a perfect protective cover. Tiny gaps inevitably existed between them.That was where I aimed.\u201cHuaaap!\u201dThe warrior swung his axe. His axe turned giant and crushed the tree I was standing on. I jumped off at the same time, then made a big turn in the air.Psssh\u2014\u00a0Pieces of the tree scattered into the air, and my body turned upside down 10 meters in the air.At the same time, I activated Bullet Time.Time slowed down, and I held up my gun. I could see a tiny gap between two kite shields.Since the speed and trajectory of my bullets were completely within my control, my job was simple.I twisted the gun slightly to the right and fired.Whish\u2014The bullet I fired curved oddly in midair.I could clearly see the bullet\u2019s movement.The bullet, which logically should have flown straight, suddenly dropped down. Then, almost as if it was a homing missile with a designated target, it dug through the tiny gap between two shields.\u201cAak!\u201dThe magician\u2019s scream rang out.Because the magician trusted the shields, he didn\u2019t pay attention to his safety. If he had even a single layer of Barrier around him, he wouldn\u2019t have died instantly.However, the magician tried to conserve his magic power, and as a result\u2026\u2014Team Yohei, magician Yoo Soohwan eliminated.His neck protector was struck by my bullet.\u201cAgh, this sly bastard\u2026!\u201dThe enraged warrior and supporter rushed toward me.\u201cCome on, sly?\u201dI climbed up a tree. Then, just as a monkey would throw banana peels from a tree, I fired constantly.\u201cGet down! Get down here!\u201dEvery time the warrior threw his axe, I repeatedly hopped to another tree and continued provoking him.Meanwhile, the frontline battle was coming to a close.With the magician\u2019s magic power support cut off, Rachel and Jin Hoseung began to push back Yohei, and the opposing team\u2019s sharpshooter was busy dodging Tomer\u2019s magic attacks.With the only two people who could help them chasing after me\u2026This battle was practically over.**10 minutes later, the victor\u2019s waiting room.As soon as the duel ended, I asked Yoo Yeonha about information on Yohei.[He has the wind attribute, the rarest attribute among water, wind, earth, and fire. His Gift lets him use his magic power to display wind-like movements.][Just like how wind is constant and intangible, he can send several sword strikes simultaneously and dodge his opponents\u2019 attacks fluidly. The name of his Gift is \u2018Covenant of Wind\u2019.][In summary, his Gift and physical abilities are both excellent. But because he\u2019s lacking in magic power, he is weak in drawn-out fights.][It seemed he formed his team to make-up for this weakness. The magician Yoo Soohwan has a magic called \u2018Target Chain\u2019, which transmits spells and magic power to a connected target from a long range.][If he survived until the end, this fight would have been more difficult. Yohei\u2019s battle sense is said to be second only to Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak.]Yoo Yeonha\u2019s message was thorough like a report. Cadets often kept their Gifts secret, but she was even knowledgeable about that. It seemed asking her was a good idea.At that moment, the waiting room door opened, and Rachel walked in.With the same expression she always wore, she spoke.\u201cGood work, everyone.\u201dAlthough her face didn\u2019t show it, her voice was full of joy. Anyone could see that Rachel was currently ecstatic.\u201cEspecially\u2026.\u201dRachel looked at me and made a thin smile.\u201cHajin-ssi. We were able to win thanks to Hajin-ssi eliminating their magician.\u201d\u201c\u2026I shouldn\u2019t be praised. I went off on my own.\u201d\u201cIf you failed, we would have called you a troll. But since you succeeded, you\u2019re a hero. I was shocked. I thought you were Guan Yu[1]\u00a0when you suddenly said you were going to take their magician\u2019s head.\u201dYi Bokgyu said with a smile. Rachel continued looking at me for a while, then nodded warmly.\u201cYes, well done.\u201d\u201cBy the way, where\u2019s Jamer?\u201dJin Hoseung then asked as he looked around the room.\u201cJamer?\u201d\u201cOh right, Jamer\u2019s not here. She did well too.\u201dWhen I tilted my head, Yi Bokgyu added.\u201cJamer\u2026 Ah.\u201dI kept getting confused.Jamer and Tomer.Tomer was her real name and Jamer was her fake name.Anyways, why hasn\u2019t Tomer responded to the message I sent her about having found Fernin Jesus? Violet Banquet had a trustworthy system. Although I asked her for 300 million won, she shouldn\u2019t be worrying about being scammed.\u2026Did she not have the money?\u201cLet me go find her.\u201dI stealthily left the waiting room.I walked down the hallway and searched for Tomer.She wasn\u2019t in the bathroom and she wasn\u2019t in a different waiting room.Soon, I found her in an alley near a vending machine.Tomer was hiding and calling someone.I eavesdropped on her call as I walked towards her.\u2014Um, if you could loan me some money\u2026Just like I thought, Tomer didn\u2019t have the money to pay for the information.At Tomer\u2019s careful question, the caller responded.\u2014Is that all you\u2019re going to say? How long are you going to drag out what should only take two weeks to do?He was clearly irritated.\u2014\u2026Sorry.\u2014If you can\u2019t close it out by the end of the week, prepare to receive punishment. Oh right, didn\u2019t you also lose the item team leader sent you?\u2014Ah, about that\u2026. I\u2019m really sorry, but I\u2019m pressed on money, so\u2026.\u2014Are you out of your mind? You sold it because you needed money!?\u2014No, no, I didn\u2019t sell it. I just lost it\u2026.\u2014Yeah, I\u2019m proud of you.Tomer hung up the call dejectedly after being yelled at for a long time.\u201cHaa.\u201dShe let out a deep sigh and turned around.I was standing in front of her.\u201c\u2026Hiik!\u201dShe immediately froze.However, nothing from the call would have indicated that she was a Djinn. She seemed to have realized it too as she breathed out a sigh of relief.I asked her as I put coins into the vending machine.\u201cWhat happened? You\u2019re short on money?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTomer walked past me silently.\u201cWant me to lend you some?\u201dBut what I said carelessly seemed to have drawn her attention as she turned her head and looked at me.\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t know how much I need.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re a magician. I can loan you as much as you want if you\u2019re willing to write a promissory note.\u201dMagicians could rake in money if they wanted.Clunk, clunk\u2014A bottle of Sprite rolled down from the vending machine.\u201cI might not look like it, but I\u2019m quite rich.\u201d**I left the duel arena, carrying my exhausted body along.Our team\u2019s second duel was at 3 P.M.\u201cThere are only two duels left, so cheer up, Kim Hajin!\u201d\u201cHey, Kim Hajin!\u201dWhen I was encouraging myself, a familiar voice rang out behind me. I turned around and saw Chae Nayun walking up to me.\u201cKim Suho wanted me to tell you he liked your match.\u201d\u201cKim Suho did?\u201d\u201cYeah, he went straight into his own match. By the way, how did you do that?\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201d\u201cYour bullet curved. What trickery is that?\u201dChae Nayun asked with a furtive voice. I retorted simply.\u201cMy Gift.\u201d\u201c\u2026What a boring explanation. \u2026Huaam~\u201dChae Nayun suddenly yawned and interlocked her fingers together behind her neck.\u201cAh~ I want to fight too. My matches don\u2019t start until after noon.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dI tried to ignore her and go on my way, but I stopped because I saw someone in front of me.Shin Jonghak and Yoo Yeonha were only about ten steps away.Shin Jonghak\u2019s dry and cold gaze fell on me. It felt like he was looking at me in disdain because of the emotionlessness in his eyes.It was almost like I was in a haunted house.He was handsome, but scary.\u201c\u2026.\u201dShin Jonghak quietly looked back and forth between me and Chae Nayun. After receiving his gaze for a moment, Chae Nayun frowned and shot back.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201c\u2026Haha.\u201dShin Jonghak\u2019s laughter flowed out from the crevice between his teeth. Shin Jonghak liked this side of Chae Nayun, although Yoo Yeonha who was standing next to him didn\u2019t seem to understand why.Shin Jonghak sauntered toward us.Almost as if to switch places with him, I walked past him.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201dYoo Yeonha asked. Her eyes were still fixed on Shin Jonghak.\u201cYeah. What about you? Are you going to your match?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s at 11 A.M.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dAs I walked past her, I suddenly remembered something.\u201cOh right, hey.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dOnly then did Yoo Yeonha turn to face me.I spoke briefly and simply.\u201cBullets. 5.56 mm.\u201d\u201c\u2026You want me to get you some?\u201d\u201cYeah, but a lot of them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026 but what do you need assault rifle bullets for?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll need them in the future.\u201d\u201cHmm, hold on.\u201dYoo Yeonha immediately turned on her smartwatch.\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cAbout\u2026 six hundred?\u201d\u201cSix\u2026 what?\u201d\u201cSix hundred.\u201d\u201c\u2026You know that high rank 5.56 mm magic bullets are at least 200,000 won per bullet, right?\u201d\u201cSo in total it\u2019ll be 120 million. Is it too much?\u201dI gave her a look of disappointment. After looking at me in a daze, Yoo Yeonha suddenly put on the smile of a queen.\u201c\u2026Pft. I can do something like that with my eyes closed, so don\u2019t try to scratch my pride needlessly. So, do you also need a weapon to go with it?\u201d\u201cNo, the bullets are all I need.\u201dI was about to place my hand on Yoo Yeonha\u2019s shoulder out of habit, but I realized it half-way through and stopped.Kuhum. I let out a dry cough, then put my hands in my pocket. Yoo Yeonha hated people touching her.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026. Ah, wait.\u201dThis time, Yoo Yeonha grabbed me.\u201cIt\u2019s about that ginseng.\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to make medicine with it in two weeks. So I was wondering\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you asking if I have any more?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. It\u2019s looking like it\u2019ll take a long time for us to look for proper traders.\u201dI rubbed my chin and pondered.Ginseng.To be honest, I felt like I could obtain one by hiking a few times.\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure that I\u2019ll be able to, but if I do, I\u2019ll trade it for your company\u2019s shares. How about it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dWhile we were talking, I could hear Shin Jonghak\u2019s voice from the back.\u2014Chae Nayun, why are you staying close with someone like him?\u2014What? What are you spouting so suddenly?\u2014\u2026.You didn\u2019t forget about what happened before, right? You were the one who said he was weird and told me to squash him.\u2014Eh? Ah, no, um\u2026 I misunderstood him at the time\u2026\u2018Someone like him\u2019.It was a bit unpleasant to hear, but that\u2019s just how Shin Jonghak was.He had strong pride in his bloodline and status.Even in reality, they were something to be proud of.Although the nobleness of his bloodline couldn\u2019t compare to a royalty\u2019s, Shin Jonghak\u2019s ancestor was a prime minister who served a king, and Shin Jonghak\u2019s grandfather, Shin Myungchul, was a true noble who saved starving Koreans after Outcall.\u201c\u2026Just ignore him.
