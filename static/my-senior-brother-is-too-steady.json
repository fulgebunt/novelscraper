The sun rose from the east as the stars faded into the vault of heaven.On the north-west of the East Continent of Purvavideha1, at an inconspicuous corner near the Middle Continent, a gigantic array formation covered the dozens of emerald mountains below it. The array formation was smooth as silk and appeared similar to an inverted crystal bowl.Under the bright sun rays, the walls of the array formation radiated colorful bursts of light. Waves of visible spiritual energy drifted within the array formation.Divine creatures and spiritual beasts were playing in the mountains. Shadows appeared briefly in between the clouds occasionally.Waves of smoke spiraled upwards as music from the string instruments danced in the air.Many people were sitting in a lotus position and practicing breathing exercises at the clearing beside the houses in the woods. Some were also floating freely in the sky. It appeared like a picture of an immortal mountain.As the morning rays shone on the array formation, a white cloud drifted towards it from the East Ocean.Two shadows were standing on the cloud\u2014one was tall, and the other was shorter. The taller person was an old Daoist priest. Beside him was a sweet girl, who seemed to be around eight or nine years old.\u201cThe clouds were never-ending, and so were our thoughts. Yet, why is there a need to worry when the gentle breeze blew at our sides?\u201dThe old Daoist priest sang emotionally.\u201cWhen the Primordial World was created, the Great Dragon-Phoenix War soon erupted. Time flew by in a snap of the fingers.\u201cThe pavilion leading to the Platform of the Immortals could not be seen. Only the magnificent songs from above the heavens could be heard.\u201cOvercoming one\u2019s obstacles, helping others with their obstacles, and crossing the river of troubles. Laughing at humans, laughing at the gods, and preventing disasters.\u201cWhy does one miss his homeland? Their ancestors have risked their lives and achieved serenity.\u201cLing\u2019e, listen up!\u201cAccording to the legends, after the ancient Great Mage-Demon War, the humans won the upper hand in achieving Heavenly Dao. The humans at the Qi Refinement Realm gradually occupied most places apart from the North Continent of Uttarakuru. We are spread out across the Trichiliocosm and can be found within thousands of first-order clusters. However, the South Continent of Jambudvipa was where humans\u2019 destiny lies, and thus we are prohibited from entering there.\u201cWe are now in the East Continent. This is one of the best cultivation places in the Three Realms.\u201cLing\u2019e, look at these immortal mountains in front. Don\u2019t they look delicately beautiful and magnificent?\u201dThe little girl nodded obediently. Her beautiful eyes batted lightly. An eager smile appeared between her chubby cheeks that were full of baby fats.She opened her mouth and answered, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s very magnificent, indeed!\u201d Her voice sounded like the chirpings of a newborn bird\u2014it was melodious yet timid.\u201cBeing able to occupy a spirit meridian close to the Middle Continent proves that our sect is indeed very powerful!\u201dThe old Daoist priest combed through his beard and smiled in contentment. He shook his horsetail whisk to express his pride in his sect.The girl in a lotus dress asked softly, \u201cMaster, why don\u2019t we choose to occupy a spirit meridian in the Middle Continent instead?\u201dThe old Daoist priest did not have an answer to that. He forced a laugh and said, \u201cThere are too many powerful people in the Middle Continent. We would face many troubles daily if we occupied a spirit meridian in the Middle Continent. This place is more tranquil and free, Ling\u2019e.\u201dThe little girl cupped her hands, lowered her head, and replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019m listening!\u201d\u201cI am leading you into the path to immortality. From now onwards, you must focus on your cultivation. Do not slack off in the process. You must aim to succeed in your cultivation early, go down the path to become an immortal, pursue immortality, and reap the fruits to your efforts in practicing Dao!\u201dThe little girl tilted her head and asked softly, \u201cBut, Master\u2026 have you ascended to become an immortal?\u201dThe old Daoist priest covered his mouth and coughed. \u201cI made some mistakes in my cultivation several years ago. However, I will reach Immortal Ascension in about 10 to 20 years.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me into the array formation.\u201cYou must remember that the name of our sect is the Immortal Du Sect. Our ancestor who created the sect is the famous Perfected Du\u2019e from West Kunlun. The Dao that we inherited is the Single Qi Heaven Regularization Dao. This is a complex but exceptional cultivation technique to achieve immortality!\u201cDo you remember what I have said? This will lead you in your cultivation in the future. You must not forget it.\u201d\u201cYes! I have remembered it all!\u201dThe little girl nodded her head earnestly. The old Daoist priest flicked his horsetail whisk and directed the white cloud to gradually approach the array formation in front. He took out a palm-size jade token and held it in his hand.As the jade token emitted beautiful green lights, a crack slowly appeared on the array formation that protected the mountains. The old Daoist priest and the little girl entered the array formation on the white cloud.Just as the master and disciple entered the array formation, a few white cranes glided in between the clouds and approached them. A few youngsters, who were clad in Daoist robes or colorful dresses, were standing on the cranes. They were the inner sect disciples who were currently responsible for patrolling the mountains.They came forward and greeted the old Daoist priest by the title Martial Uncle Qi Yuan. After finding out that this little girl was the old Daoist priest\u2019s new disciple, they left swiftly on the white cranes.The little girl\u2019s large eyes sparkled and reflected the two graceful female disciples\u2019 silhouettes as they left.\u201cMaster, when can Ling\u2019e move freely in the air on the immortal cranes?\u201d\u201cYou will be able to do that on any objects once you manage to cultivate the Five Qi in your chest.\u201d The old Daoist priest combed through his beard and smiled. \u201cYou may think that what you saw were immortal cranes, but they were actually all formed from some Dharma artifacts. Do not be impatient. Cultivation takes time.\u201cI will first bring you to our mountain peak before settling the various administrative procedures pertaining to you entering the sect.\u201cIncluding you and me, our line of succession only has three people. Despite so, we occupy a mountain within the sect. It is our absolute honor to be awarded that.\u201dWhen Qi Yuan talked about that, his old and wrinkled face displayed some pride.However, the little girl\u2019s focus was not on the fact that they \u2018occupied their own mountain\u2019. She counted with her fingers.\u2018Three people?\u2019\u201cMaster, but there are only two of us.\u201d\u201cOh? Didn\u2019t I tell you on the way here? Look at my memory.\u201dQi Yuan lifted his head and looked at the clouds that were drifting by. He said nonchalantly, \u201cYou have a Senior Martial Brother before you. I took him in as a disciple 100 years ago. Now, he could be\u2026 yeah, could be considered a talented cultivator who is responsible for his own cultivation.\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 Hehehe\u2026\u201dThe little girl stood on tiptoe. \u201cMaster, your laugh is so weird.\u201d\u201cLing\u2019e, you must remember\u2026\u201d Qi Yuan looked down at his precious disciple, whom he had just picked up from a third-order universe. His expression was solemn, and there was light in his eyes. The creases on his face seemed to form a huge word\u2014solemn.The little was exceptionally gifted in cultivation and was a little clever. Since she was young, she had been familiar with ceremonial formalities and was very knowledgeable. Seeing how solemn her master appeared, she focused her attention and listened attentively.The old Daoist priest suddenly sighed softly and appeared like a balloon that was losing air. He said in a hushed voice, \u201cYour big Senior Martial Brother had also experienced some problems with his cultivation. He seemed to be saying nonsense all the time and would harbor some unorthodox and controversial opinions.\u201cYou can ask him to teach and help you with your cultivation in the future, but you must most definitely ensure that you do not heed his morals on being a man!\u201cI will focus my attention on teaching you how to behave and conduct yourself.\u201dThe little girl blinked. Although she did not really understand what her master said, she nodded and answered obediently, \u201cYes! I will follow what you said!\u201dThe old Daoist priest finally let out a breath after hearing that. He pointed the horsetail whisk that he was holding in front and shook it.\u201cLook. This is our Little Qiong Peak.\u201dAs one\u2019s gaze followed the direction of the horsetail whisk\u2019s tail, they would see a \u2018malnourished\u2019 and short mountain peak that was situated in the middle of several tall mountain peaks.All other places within the sect looked like sculptures and drawings in the forest or sky-high roofs and pagodas on the mountain peak. Meanwhile, this mountain peak was much more rustic and simple. It looked like a place where no one would usually go.Many precious creatures were walking in the lush bushes. The only infrastructure there were the two straw huts beside the small lake by the hillside and the few herb gardens beside the straw huts.The old Daoist priest seemed very satisfied with his mountain peak. He drove the white cloud, landed directly at the hillside with the little girl, and passed a simple array formation.This array formation could only prevent outsiders from detecting what was happening inside. Because of the restrictions in the Immortal Du Sect, within the gigantic array formation that protected the mountains, only the array formation at the restricted area in the mountain behind had defensive properties.As they landed in front of the hut, the white cloud dissipated by itself.The little girl\u2019s canvas boots stepped on the short grass that was still dripping morning dew. The grass was gentle and soft. The scent of the grass and trees lingered in the gentle breeze. She could not help but indulge herself in the beautiful lake view and scenery. A gasp leaked from in between her soft, pink lips.The surface of the small lake twinkled as the morning rays on the mountain shone on it.The few spiritual fish in the lake leaped above the water surface, and crystal-like water droplets accompanied them. They seemed to be welcoming the little cultivator that newly arrived.The old Daoist priest smiled as he observed his little disciple\u2019s reactions. He raised his voice and said, \u201cChangshou, why aren\u2019t you here to meet your Junior Martial Sister?\u201dThe little girl instinctively looked at the hut with shut doors. Anticipation grew in her heart.Her senior martial brother had been cultivating in the immortal sect. He must be wise, heroic, and charming. He would definitely be similar to the demon-slaying heroes that she had been hearing about from the legendary tales from a young age.However, the hut was quiet. No noise could be heard from inside.The old Daoist priest shouted again, \u201cChangshou? Why are you hiding in the house? Are you being shy?\u201dThe old Daoist priest muttered to himself while dragging the little girl towards the hut. \u201cThis is weird. I could detect that his aura was still lingering in the room.\u201d He lifted his hands and pushed the two wooden doors open. A strange medicinal scent blew in his face. The old Daoist priest darted his eyes and saw the origin of the aura that he had detected\u2014a paper doll that was placed on the wooden bed!\u201cOh?\u201dThe old Daoist priest and the young girl suddenly started wobbling back and forth. The expression on the old Daoist priest\u2019s face changed immediately. He dragged the little girl and started evacuating hastily. While he was moving, he could not help but curse out loud, \u201cOh, no! It\u2019s the Immortal Enervating Scent that Changshou had concocted!\u201dThe little girl felt that the universe was spinning. Although her master pulled her, she started falling to one side immediately.Splash!\u2018Water sounds?\u2019As she was falling, the little girl could not resist looking in the direction of the splash.On the surface of the lake, a lean silhouette appeared to be reaching for the skies. He was only wearing black trousers. His sturdy and evenly-distributed muscles were shimmering faintly under the sunlight. As he moved, two streams of sparkling water followed the movements of his long drenched hair.The amount of sunlight was just right. When this young man\u2019s relatively handsome face showed up before the little girl\u2019s eyes, her face flushed red instantly.However, she had yet to start on her cultivation, and there was no way she could withstand the effects of the medicinal scent. She had already lost consciousness before landing on the ground. Her face was still burning red.Just as she had expected\u2014the valiant big senior martial brother of her dreams!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLan Ling\u2019e had a dream.In her dream, she was accepted as a disciple by an old immortal. He brought her to the immortals\u2019 abode, where she saw a dashing senior martial brother leaping from the water.Umm\u2026 That seemed to be not just a dream. It was what had just happened.While she was in a daze, Lan Ling\u2019e heard her master\u2019s voice. Surprisingly, he sounded a little fierce, different from the kind old deity she thought he was.\u201cRascal! You don\u2019t listen to me now that you\u2019ve grown up, isn\u2019t it? How dare you scheme against me!?\u201dAfterward, Lan Ling\u2019e heard a gentle and calm voice.\u201cEase your anger, Master. I am only taking precautions. Since I was planning on practicing the Water Escape technique, I set this trap for any possible burglars before going to the lake. I did not know that you would come back today all of a sudden, and hence did not have time to tear down those traps. Please, forgive me, Master.\u201dHer senior martial brother spoke at a comfortable pace, making people want to lean in to listen on.Soon after, Lan Ling\u2019e heard her master heave a long sigh.The old Daoist priest was sitting beside the bamboo bed. He clapped his hands and complained reluctantly, \u201cChangshou, we are in the sect mountains. Is there a need for this kind of trap?\u201cGuarding against burglars? Our Little Qiong Peak could almost change its name to Little Poor Peak1! Which burglar would choose us as their target?\u201d\u2018Changshou? Senior Martial Brother\u2019s name is Changshou?\u2019It was an ordinary Dao name. At the same time, it showcased his rustic and pure aspirations.Lan Ling\u2019e suddenly discovered that although she could hear the commotion outside, she could not open her eyes at all. Her eyelids weighed like bricks, and her energy seemed to be sucked out of her body.Her senior martial brother started talking again. His voice was warm and made her feel as though her mother was there.\u201cMaster, this is not true. There could still be dangers within the sect mountains.\u201cIn recent years, the competition between different peaks has been intensifying, yet the elders in the sect are not concerned about this. I am the only\u2014no, one of the two\u2014disciples in our line of succession. It is a must that I remain vigilant.\u201cWe do not have much presence in the sect, to begin with, and we do not have any backing either. Who knows? Maybe someone could be devising plans to steal our plot of land.\u201dAfter her senior martial brother finished speaking, Lan Ling\u2019e heard her old master complain.\u201cThe Immortal Du Sect has strict sect rules. How could that happen?\u201cForget it! I am in no position to criticize you! You and your weird logic! Why aren\u2019t you improving on your cultivation instead?\u201cYou will wait here until Ling\u2019e wakes up. This is my identity token. Bring her to the main peak for registration and collect her identity token and monthly allowance as an official disciple!\u201cThis is really getting on my nerves!\u201dThe old Daoist priest waved his sleeve and stood up from the bamboo chair. He staggered a little because of the effects of the medicinal scent\u2014that made his face flush.\u201cGetting on my nerves!\u201d\u201cTake it slow, Master.\u201d\u201cHmph! I shall be in secluded cultivation to comprehend the miraculous Dao technique!\u201dThe Daoist priest, Qi Yuan, stomped his feet on the ground fiercely and transformed into a wisp of smoke as he vanished from the straw hut.In the blink of an eye, a string of clanking noises was heard from the opposite straw hut. The Daoist priest had lost his balance again after reversing the Dharma spell.The young man standing at the door sighed softly.As he sighed, the little girl, who was lying on the bamboo bed, opened her eyes slightly and saw the silhouette that had his head held low and was in deep thought.\u2018Senior Martial Brother looks so tall.\u2019\u201cMaster\u2019s cultivation base is still too weak, and his soul is not powerful enough. I doubt he can make it past the Heavenly Tribulation during Immortal Ascension.\u201d\u2018Those words, what do they mean?\u2019A wave of fatigue swept her, and Lan Ling\u2019e closed her eyes unconsciously. Very soon, she heard footsteps approaching.Even though she was only nine years old, Lan Ling\u2019e had gained awareness of her surroundings from a young age. Moreover, she had been born in a powerful and wealthy family in the world where ordinary human beings lived. At a young age, she had learned about ceremonial formalities and the laws. She had partial knowledge about all kinds of stuff.The current situation she was in was considered disregarding ceremonial formalities and the laws to Lan Ling\u2019e. She was alone in a room with a man, and the unfamiliar man was gradually approaching her.However, if that man was her senior martial brother, she could treat him like a blood-related brother in the future. That seemed\u2026 acceptable\u2026\u201cJunior Sister Lan, I am your Senior Martial Brother Li Changshou. I am going to alleviate the effects of the Immortal Enervating Scent for you now. If you can hear me, please do not treat me as a pervert. I am a morally upright man.\u201cUmm\u2026 what nonsense am I saying? She has just started on her cultivation. How could she withstand the medicinal effects?\u201d\u2018Pervert? Morally upright? This cultivation language is so hard to understand. Senior Martial Brother is a cultivator, indeed!\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e tried her best to respond to avoid being too disrespectful in front of her senior martial brother. However, she did not have a hint of energy left in her. The only thing she could control was her thoughts.All of a sudden, she felt a huge hand resting gently on her forehead. Wisps of cool and refreshing air entered from her forehead and circulated throughout her entire body. That made her feel especially comfortable.\u2018Senior Martial Brother is healing me\u2026\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s head was in a mess. Her thoughts were scattered. The situation she was in felt surreal and real at the same time.Li Changshou looked at the little girl lying flat on the bed. He creased his eyebrows and thought it through.Even though his master had said that he wanted to accept another disciple for a long time and he was mentally prepared to welcome a new junior martial sister or brother, Li Changshou was still a little concerned about it.\u2018I should take this chance to check her souls and spirits.\u2019Li Changshou emitted a cooling stream of air and touched Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s life source gently.\u2018Yes. The soul is perfectly compatible with the body. There is nothing inconsistent in her body. It is very unlikely that she had been possessed. She seems to be pretty talented and has a close affinity with the Water and Wood Elements.\u2019However, Li Changshou did not know how her personality was.Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s personality should have been developed at this age. Li Changshou merely hoped that she wasn\u2019t someone who would cause trouble everywhere.However, Li Changshou could tell from her looks that she would become a beautiful woman when she grew up. Since ancient times, beautiful women had been the reasons for war. This was a potential reason for conflicts, so he had to try his best to avoid it.\u2018I should also check if she is hiding any demon seedlings or something of that sort.\u2019Yes. That was also a vital thing to check. Although there was not a high probability of that happening, he should not leave it to chances. It was always good to take necessary precautionary measures.At the same time\u2026\u2018Ay?\u2019While Lan Ling\u2019e was unconscious, she felt the huge hand leave her forehead and start sliding all over her body. Her face turned a little red.\u2018Senior\u2026 Senior Brother\u2026 Isn\u2019t this way too\u2026 This is way too inappropriate\u2026\u2019Not long after, Li Changshou nodded his head. After the thorough check that he had conducted, there seemed not to be any problems with his junior martial sister\u2014she was not possessed, there were no demon seedlings planted in her, and she was not under the influence of any Gu poison or curse. Moreover, she indeed had talent in cultivation.Lan Ling\u2019e had officially passed the entrance check!After that would be regarding his junior martial sister\u2019s training courses, and Li Changshou had to prepare for that thoroughly.It would be best if his junior martial sister were not someone who would create troubles. In that case, his chances of being affected by karma, later on, would be similar to how his chances were now.Li Changshou was in a daze as he sat on the edge of the bed. Afterward, he laughed dryly and muttered, \u201cI can somehow understand why there were so many people who were obsessed with lolitas in his previous life. How could anyone withstand their cuteness?\u201d\u2018Obsessed with lolitas? Cute? Previous life?\u2019Although Lan Ling\u2019e did not understand what he said, she felt that her master\u2019s words were indeed right. Her senior martial brother was a little weird.Maybe because of the effects of the cooling streams of air, Lan Ling\u2019e felt that she had recovered some of her energy. She could not resist the urge to open her eyes. Her lips parted slightly, and a groan was produced from her throat.Her vision turned from blurry to clear. Lan Ling\u2019e could finally have a good look at her senior martial brother up close. He indeed possessed defined features. The more she looked at him, the more handsome he seemed. He was even more charming than her mother\u2019s personal guards.However, this senior brother\u2019s expression now\u2014made her a little fearful!\u2018Senior Brother\u2019s stare looks so terrifying!\u2019Gulp!Lan Ling\u2019e gulped down her saliva. She looked weak, helpless, and pitiful.She heard the teenage cultivator sitting on the edge of the bed, asking, \u201cDid you hear everything that I said just now?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e was instantly a little nervous. Her voice trembled as she replied, \u201cN\u2026 no\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d\u2018What\u2019s wrong with Senior Brother? Did I do anything to upset him? From Senior Brother\u2019s expression, he seems unsatisfied with me?\u2019\u201cSenior Brother\u2026\u201dThe teenager on the edge of the bed stood up slowly. He lowered his head and looked down at the beautiful little girl. His gaze had a little hesitation in it. However, very quickly, he spoke with a low-pitched voice.\u201cLook at me. Do not mention what I had said to anyone.\u201d\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e answered softly. Her face was flushed, and she was at a loss.Afterward, she saw her senior brother shake his head and walk towards the window. He stared outside the window and seemed to be in a daze.His name was Li Changshou. When he had been being accepted as a disciple, he had insisted on keeping Changshou as his Dao name.The reason was similar to Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s guess. Li Changshou wanted to live longer1. It would be best if his lifespan was as long as heaven and earth.At that instant, Li Changshou was recalling the information that he had exposed when talking to himself.\u2018The biggest slip should be the words \u2018previous life.\u2019 F*ck!\u2019Li Changshou had been extremely cautious these few hundred years. He did not expect that he would expose his secret to this new junior sister of his! He had kept the secret in his heart for too long and could not resist the urge to talk to himself!Li Changshou rubbed his chin as his gaze swept to the little girl that was attempting to leave the bed.He must indeed kill her to shut her up. Kill her to shut her up!Lan Ling\u2019e took a lot of effort to sit up straight on the bed. She saw her senior brother\u2019s cold stare coincidentally and could not help but shiver.\u201cSenior Brother?\u201d\u201cDo not tell anyone about what I had just said!\u201d\u201cYes! Ling\u2019e will remember this!\u201d\u201cYou must not mention this to anyone, including Master!\u201d\u201cOkay, Senior Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cGood. Make an oath in the name of the miraculous Dao!\u201d\u201cUmm? Umm\u2026\u201dUnder the sunlight, parallel black vertical lines appeared on the forehead of the little girl sitting on the bed. With the technical guidance\u2014or rather, supervision\u2014by the person beside her, she raised her petite hand and started reciting the thousand-word long Dao oath that considered various possible situations and listed the various preconditions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her body was wobbling as she walked, and her steps were faltering.\u201cHere.\u201d A hand from beside her was suddenly held out in front of her. There was a light green pill on the palm.Li Changshou said warmly, \u201cQi Cultivation and Condensation Pill. It does not contain any poison, and its medicinal effects are very gentle. Those who have not started on their cultivation can use this to restore their energy.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e answered timidly, \u201cThank you, Senior Brother.\u201d She took the pill, turned her body around, and placed the pill into her mouth.The pill melted immediately when it came into contact with her saliva. It tasted like sweet and clear spring water. A soft \u2018mmmh\u2019 slipped out of her mouth. She was energized immediately.\u2018This Junior Sister is indeed a little cute.\u2019Li Changshou\u2019s huge hand reached out from the sides and caressed her head as he spoke warmly.\u201cIn the future, you will be a member of the Little Qiong Peak. I will first bring you around to familiarize yourself with the environment. After the effects of the medicinal scent wear off\u2014cough\u2014after Master has finished a round of Qi circulation, he will teach you the entrance-level cultivation method. If you have any questions regarding your cultivation, feel free to find me.\u201d\u201cThank you, Senior Brother.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e held her hands behind her back and squeaked.Li Changshou held his hands behind his back and walked towards the lake. \u201cLet us first look at the spiritual fish in the lake. These are all good stuff, and they are also an integral part of our Little Qiong Peak\u2019s capital.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e caught up to him hurriedly. She stepped on the soft grass, tiptoed, and looked into the lake.The lake water was abnormally clear. The fish inside were all playing around without any troubles in their mind.\u201cLook.\u201d Li Changshou pointed at some spiritual fish with colorful scales. \u201cAren\u2019t they pretty?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e nodded violently. The spiritual fish mesmerized her, and gasps of awe escaped from her mouth.She heard her senior brother\u2019s gentle voice from beside her.\u201cOnce you have cultivated your first breath of Qi, we will organize a spiritual fish buffet. This species of spiritual fish with colorful scales are called snakeheads. Not only are they delicious, but they could also be served pan-fried, steamed, roasted, or fried. What\u2019s even rarer is its ability to improve the quality of the spiritual energy that cultivators produce for the first time.\u201dTwo parallel black vertical lines hung on Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s forehead. \u201cAre\u2026 are you going to eat them?\u201d\u201cOtherwise, why would I breed them?\u201dLi Changshou waved his left hand, and his left sleeve followed his movement. He scattered a handful of rice grains and shouted, \u201cFeeding time!\u201dMany spiritual fish swarmed from all directions, and the lake was instantly flooded. Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cHere.\u201d The huge hand handed over a delicate canvas bag. \u201cThis is fish feed. If you like it, I\u2019ll hand you the mission of feeding the fish daily.\u201d\u201cYes! Thank you, Senior Brother!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e answered happily and took the canvas bag over. She took some rice grains out and scattered them on the lake.Ling\u2019e seemed extremely cautious, as though the fish feed could hurt the spiritual fish\u2019s beautiful scales.Li Changshou smiled calmly beside her.Now, he had fewer chores to do daily and could spend that time on his cultivation!From that perspective, having a junior sister sounded like a good idea.Lan Ling\u2019e waved her hand and scattered the fish feed a handful at a time. The spiritual fish in the water swarmed around her. She was having a great time playing with the fish.Li Changshou waited for a while beside her. He flicked his finger slightly, and two small streams of water exploded on the lake\u2019s surface. Two snakeheads were thrown out of the water. He summoned them over using telekinesis, wrapped them in a ball of water, and placed them in his sleeve.Lan Ling\u2019e was dumbfounded by what she saw. \u201cSenior Brother, why did you put the fish in your sleeve?\u201d\u201cTo give them away,\u201d Li Changshou answered nonchalantly. \u201cThe Immortal Du Sect might be an immortal cultivation sect, but we still observe the social norms that ordinary humans follow. I will be bringing you for registration later on. I can\u2019t possibly go there empty-handed, can I?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked. Although she did not really understand what he said, she nodded obediently and said, \u201cThank you for your efforts, Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Come here once you have finished playing with the fish.\u201dLi Changshou held his hands behind his back and drifted to the herb garden near the lake. Lan Ling\u2019e looked at the school of fish in the lake, waved to them, and followed behind Li Changshou hurriedly.While they were by the herb garden, Li Changshou briefly described the hundreds of spiritual herbs in the garden and their effects.Lan Ling\u2019e tried her best to memorize everything he said. She did not know that her senior brother was attempting to assign her the role as the new gardener. As she listened to her senior brother\u2019s warm voice, Lan Ling\u2019e could not help but think of her mother, whose voice was equally warm and gentle.The scenery at the Little Qiong Peak was beautiful, but there was not much that needed introduction.Li Changshou circled the surroundings of the straw hut twice with his new junior sister and assigned a region to build her new straw hut. He used his Dharmic power to summon a white cloud and flew to the middle of the mountains with Lan Ling\u2019e.Lan Ling\u2019e could not contain her question. \u201cSenior Brother, can you fly on the immortal cranes as well?\u201d\u201cYes. As long as one knows how to maneuver on objects.\u201d Li Changshou tapped the white cloud with his foot. The white cloud suddenly emitted a soft sheep and transformed into a gigantic immortal crane. The immortal crane extended its wings and flew them forward.Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s huge eyes instantly sparkled. She dragged her senior brother\u2019s Daoist robe with her tiny hands and expressed her amazement.\u201cThese are just simple illusion techniques. As compared to this, there are some other things that you have to remember when flying around in the sect.\u201d\u201cWhat are those, Senior Brother?\u201dLi Changshou cleared his throat and sorted through the lessons that he had prepared beforehand in his head. He decided to start teaching his junior sister the little details.Therefore, he said sincerely, \u201cFirstly, you have to take note of the altitude you are flying at in the sect. You mustn\u2019t fly too high or too low. Many seniors and powerful cultivators fly at a high altitude. It is very easy to offend them if you meet them.\u201cYou must remember this, Junior Sister. If you are noticed by a senior or powerful cultivator, there is a 50% chance of you leaving a good impression, and there is also a 50% chance of you leaving a bad impression.\u201cYou might not receive any benefits if you leave a good impression on them. However, there will definitely be potential risks if you leave a bad impression on them.\u201cTherefore, the best solution is to prevent them from noticing you. If you meet them, it is enough that you greet them and behave as you are supposed to.\u201d\u201cOh! Ling\u2019e will remember this!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, you cannot fly at an altitude that is too low either. If you fly too low, there is a high possibility of you flying past some buildings on the mountain peaks.\u201cAlthough the sect seems peaceful on the surface, there is still a lot of competition beneath that. Many people are concerned about the lame rankings. If you fly too low, you will likely be targeted by them.\u201cTherefore, after testing it out for 100 years, I have concluded a suitable altitude to fly within the sect\u2014300 to 500 feet above our accommodation. It is very unlikely that you\u2019ll meet other disciples in the sect at this altitude, much fewer seniors or powerful cultivators.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e tried her best to ingrain the huge chunk of words that her senior brother said in her heart. While doing so, she could not stop herself from lifting her head and looking at her senior brother\u2019s distinct features.\u2018Senior Brother is indeed very handsome. He is very thoughtful, as well.\u2019\u2026Even though her senior brother reminded her endlessly while they were moving, Lan Ling\u2019e soon arrived at the main peak in the Immortal Du Sect.That mountain peak was at the center of all the mountains in the sect. It was also the tallest and straightest mountain. It looked similar to a sword that pointed at the heavens and pierced through the clouds.Therefore, it was also known as the Heaven-Breaking Peak.There was an immortal palace at the summit of the Heaven-Breaking Peak. That was where the Sect Leader, Elders, and Peak Leaders held their meetings. It was a region that normally prohibited flying. The disciples and others in the sect were prohibited from going near this place without permission. At the hillside of the Heaven-Breaking Peak, there was a pavilion and palace built on the slope. Many people would go in and out of that place daily.After hearing her senior brother\u2019s introduction, Ling\u2019e learned that this was the \u2018office\u2019 in the Immortal Du Sect where matters within the sect were handled. The disciples from the various peaks would come here every month to receive their monthly allowance and report their cultivation progress every once a while.As Lan Ling\u2019e was walking on the bluestone path, to her surprise, she found out that she and her senior brother were seemingly \u2018invisible\u2019. There were many fellow disciples in the sect, but no one paid attention to them.Even if people\u2019s gaze swept across them, they would look away without stopping.Li Changshou\u2019s voice sounded near Ling\u2019e\u2019s ears. He was still teaching her persistently. \u201cLing\u2019e, you have to remember this. Do not attract attention to yourself. Do your best to reduce your presence. This is the best method to avoid dealing with karma. I have modified a Dao technique to conceal one\u2019s aura. I\u2019ll teach it to you once you start on your cultivation.\u201d\u201cYes! Thank you, Senior Brother.\u201dLi Changshou replied with smiling eyes, \u201cNo need to thank me. This is what I should be doing as your senior brother.\u201d He brought Li Changshou to the sidewalk and entered a building that had a plaque with \u2018Bai Fan Hall\u2019 written on it.In the building, Lan Ling\u2019e saw her senior brother take the two spiritual fish out and chat passionately with the middle-aged Daoist who was in charge of registration within the sect.\u2018Senior Brother seems so mature\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is the breath of all living things. All methods for cultivation start from Qi. All divine powers were created using Qi. A Heavenly Cycle is completed when one practiced breathing exercises and allowed the Qi to circulate in their body.\u201cToday, I will be teaching you the basics of our sect\u2019s Single Qi Heaven Regularization Chant.\u201cThis is the technique for establishing one\u2019s Dao foundation. It is a brilliant foundation establishment technique even if one were to compare it with other techniques in the five continents. Even if you want to practice other cultivation techniques in the future, this technique will still be able to help you establish your foundation.\u201cLing\u2019e\u2026 Ling\u2019e?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e was standing under the shade of the willow beside the lake. Her gaze kept turning towards the middle of the lake involuntarily, and she stuck the tip of her tongue out nervously.The old Daoist priest, Qi Yuan, looked towards the middle of the lake and smiled. \u201cYour Senior Brother is trying to comprehend Water Escape techniques. Do not be distracted by him. Listen to me. I\u2019ll explain this basic cultivation technique to you.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e focused her attention and concentrated on the marvelous technique that her master was teaching. She tried her best to understand the meaning of those words.However, after a while\u2026Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s almond-shaped eyes widened into a circle. She pointed at the lake and exclaimed, \u201cMaster! Senior Brother has disappeared!\u201dQi Yuan turned his head and looked over. He smiled helplessly and said, \u201cThat is an escape technique! Come. Let\u2019s go inside the room to practice! Your Senior Brother is interested in all kinds of escape techniques. This should be the sixth escape technique that he has mastered.\u201d\u201cMaster, what are escape techniques?\u201dQi Yuan combed his beard and said while smiling, \u201cEscape techniques are a kind of Dharma spell. It enables the practitioner to travel instantly to different places. Water Escape allows one to swoop through the water and move faster than the fish. Look. Your Senior Brother has appeared beside the lake. His escape speed is really remarkable.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e tiptoed and looked over just in time to see her senior brother appear at the far end of the lake. He stood quietly on the water surface.Ling\u2019e complimented softly, \u201cSenior Brother is so impressive!\u201d\u201cSpeaking of escape techniques, your Senior Brother\u2019s escape techniques are indeed very impressive compared to others in our Immortal Du Sect.\u201d Qi Yuan looked a little helpless. \u201cIf he spent half the amount of effort in other Dharmic spells as he did in escape techniques, I would be much more assured.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked her eyes gently and followed her master into the straw hut.Qi Yuan summoned two meditation cushions and closed the wooden door of the straw hut. He hit his little disciple\u2019s head softly with the horsetail whisk in his hand. \u201cPay attention!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e crossed her legs and sat down properly hurriedly. She could finally concentrate this time.Li Changshou was walking on the surface of the lake. After taking two steps, he suddenly transformed into a stream of water and disappeared. In a few breaths\u2019 time, he reappeared in the middle of the lake.\u2018Water Escape worked, yet it took so long.\u2019However, he could integrate himself into the water while performing the Water Escape technique\u2014that could shield him from attacks using some Dharma treasures.\u2018Water benefits all yet it doesn\u2019t demand credit for its contributions. Water can make everything float without collapsing. It is indeed something worth exploring.\u2019Li Changshou stood with his hands behind his back. After thinking for a while, he continued walking on the water surface. However, he would disappear and reappear with every few steps.After continuous attempts, Li Changshou did not need to walk on the water surface to perform the Water Escape technique anymore. As long as he came into contact with the lake, Li Changshou could immediately perform the Water Escape technique.However, Li Changshou was still not satisfied. He continued thinking about ways to improve his Water Escape technique and was completely oblivious to the time passed.That continued until the evening when Qi Yuan sent a voice message asking him to go back.\u201cLing\u2019e has yet to practice inedia, but she should not be eating satiety pills all the time. While you are constructing the straw hut, later on, build a stove as well. Make her a meal every day until the day she practices inedia.\u201dLi Changshou cupped his hands and said, \u201cAt your command, Master.\u201d\u201cI shall proceed with my cultivation. Ling\u2019e, if you face any troubles, you can speak to your Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e copied her senior brother\u2019s actions and answered with her hands cupped. However, her tummy growled at that very moment, making her face flush.Qi Yuan laughed out loud. He transformed into a wisp of smoke and vanished. Li Changshou was also full of smiles, yet he turned and looked at the lake to avoid making his junior sister feel awkward.\u201cSenior Brother! Did Master just use the Smoke Escape technique?\u201d\u201cHuh? Smoke Escape technique?\u201d Li Changshou was momentarily stunned. Afterward, he broke into a burst of laughter. \u201cThat was just an illusion spell. It is mainly used to protect one\u2019s life when one is battling with their enemy. It can be used to deal damage or trap the enemy. It can be considered one of Master\u2019s best spells. Do you want to learn it? You will have to wait until your cultivation sees some improvements. Master will teach this to you then if you ask him to.\u201d\u201cWhat about Senior Brother\u2019s Water Escape technique? Can Ling\u2019e learn that now?\u201d\u201cWater Escape can only be learned later. You will need to reach the Soul Formation Realm of Qi Refinement before learning this, as well as the other element escape techniques. Leave that at the back of your mind as of now, rookie cultivator. You have only just completed your first meditation session.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked and asked, \u201cWhat does rookie mean? Does it refer to a clumsy beginner?\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s eyes turned into a line as he smiled. He brought Lan Ling\u2019e over to the empty space beside the herb garden. \u201cWhat do you want to eat? We have a lot of wildlife around here. If you do not have any dietary restrictions, I will recommend you some.\u201d\u2018Wildlife?\u2019\u201cSenior Brother, are we eating\u2026 these medicinal herbs this afternoon?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Li Changshou stretched his right palm in front of him. A piece of stone flew towards him from one side and spun one round in his palm. Afterward, it flew towards the forest with a piercing whizz.Lan Ling\u2019e could not help but exclaim in awe. Meanwhile, a commotion stirred in the forest, startling flocks of birds.Very soon, a golden pheasant that was born with tri-colored feathers swooped in the air. The stone was etched in the golden pheasant\u2019s chest\u2014that spiritual beast was long dead.The stone flew into the forest and back. Afterward, Li Changshou threw it at a nearby bush casually. That made Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s eyes shine brightly.Not before long, Li Changshou had skillfully set up a barbeque rack beside the lake. He stripped the feathers of the golden pheasant and removed its innards. He took out a few bottles of seasoning ingredients that he valued a lot and started \u2018seducing\u2019 his junior sister, her saliva, more specifically.\u201cSenior Brother, what Dharma spell was that with the stone? How could it fly back after it\u2019s been thrown?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just simple telekinesis.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and replied, \u201cThis can only be considered a simple spell.\u201cIn today\u2019s cultivation world, or rather, in the entire five continents, the most popular fighting tactics was to use some Dharma treasures. Cultivators would incorporate their cultivation powers into their Dharma treasures, or use them to hit others.\u201cTelekinesis is only the basics of controlling Dharma treasures.\u201cYou have just started on your cultivation. It is no surprise that you do not know about that. I will slowly explain them to you in the future.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e knelt at one side. She arranged a strand of hair beside her ear with her hand and said softly like a mosquito, \u201cSenior Brother\u2019s spells all seem very impressive.\u201dLi Changshou shook his head slightly. Then he explained to Ling\u2019e sincerely, \u201cYou are wrong, Junior Sister. These are not impressive.\u201cOur master and I are both cultivators who have yet to experience Immortal Ascension.\u201cThis Primordial World is too savage. Immortal Ascension is only equivalent to leaving the beginner\u2019s village. There are seven or eight more realms after Immortal Ascension. Only then could one be considered a powerful cultivator. Each realm could stop countless of \u2018geniuses\u2019 in their tracks.\u201cThe Primordial World has existed for a duration too long to count. There are countless of top-notch cultivators around. This makes it even harder for new cultivators to climb to the very top.\u201cMoreover, cultivation powers are ultimately just a foundation. If two individuals at the same cultivation realm were to battle, the outcome of the one without any powerful Dharma treasures would be\u2026 losing one\u2019s Dao and dying!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e shrank her neck. Her senior brother\u2019s words were like a demon\u2019s voice. They made her hairs stand.His voice continued reverberating in the air.\u201cEven if you have powerful Dharma treasures, death is still inevitable if you do not possess powerful mystical abilities. Even if you have sufficient Dharma treasures and mystical abilities, you might still face disasters if you are unlucky. Death is still inevitable. To sum it all\u2026\u201d\u201cLose\u2026 losing one\u2019s Dao and dying?\u201dLi Changshou showed a kind smile and complimented her. \u201cGood. You have understood it pretty quickly.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e asked softly, \u201cHowever, Senior Brother, isn\u2019t the purpose of cultivation to live forever? Shouldn\u2019t our aim be striving to protect oneself and live an unrestrained life?\u201d\u201cNo. You might have gotten it wrong. Cultivating is not something that is admirable.\u201d Li Changshou shook his head and sighed. \u201cThe purpose of cultivation is to become stronger so that we will be able to face all kinds of difficult situations and ultimately survive.\u201cLiving forever is just a realm in cultivation. When you reach that realm, you will not die naturally. However, you might still lose your life to various disasters.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e asked nervously, \u201cThen, Senior Brother, what should we do to truly stay alive?\u201dLi Changshou rotated the barbeque rack in his hand slowly and replied methodically, \u201cFirst, avoid dealing with karma. Try your best not to be involved in weird situations. The best solution is to stay at home and practice your cultivation. Avoid walking around unnecessarily and avoid coming into contact with anybody else.\u201cOf course, it is hard to achieve this.\u201cFor example, you and me. We have come into contact because we are under the guidance of the same master. That creates a cause. If any one of us face any troubles, the other will inevitably be implicated. This is an effect.\u201cTherefore, even if we tried our best to avoid karma, which is the combination of cause and effect, we will not be able to avoid it completely. Hence, we should learn to analyze the situation. We must make reasonable judgments based on the situation to avoid landing ourselves in danger.\u201cIf we did everything we could but still found ourselves in a potentially dangerous situation, we are only left with the second solution.\u201d\u201cWhat is the second solution?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e wiped the saliva at the corner of her mouth. The golden pheasant that was on the rack was almost done and was emitting a delicious scent.\u201cHole cards.\u201d\u201cHole cards? What are they?\u201d\u201cHole cards refer to your various hidden abilities.\u201d Li Changshou tore a piece of chicken and handed it over to Ling\u2019e, who was eagerly waiting while continuing to teach her.He had prepared the entrance educational talk for his future junior sister for a long time. He was currently consolidating the information that he had prepared for months!\u201cYou can conceal 30% of your abilities and only showcase 70% of that to others. In this case, if someone targeted you, you would be able to shock them with your abilities and win the fight.\u201cTo be precise, if you have any powerful Dharma spells, mystical abilities, or Dharma treasures in the future, you can hide them and use them as your hole cards. No one will know about them until you use them at crucial moments. They will be your royal flush that will end the game.\u201cYou can also conceal a portion of your cultivation level. That can also be one of your hole cards.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e finished the chicken in her hands in a few bites. Her eyes lit up as she reminisced about its delicious taste. She could not help but lick her fingers in satisfaction.She thought through her senior brother\u2019s advice and asked softly, \u201cHowever, Senior Brother, what can I do if I still fail to beat the other party even after revealing all my hole cards?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where the third solution applies.\u201d With a flick of his finger, the cooked golden pheasant was dissected in front of Li Changshou. It turned into chicken pieces that were full of spiritual energy and floated in front of Lan Ling\u2019e.\u201cThe third solution is very simple. That is to\u2014run!\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e blinked her eyes. Although the barbequed meat attracted most of her attention, Lan Ling\u2019e still tried her best to understand what her senior brother was talking about.Li Changshou said casually, \u201cAs the saying goes, while the green hills last, there\u2019ll be wood to burn.\u201cActing rashly would only bury your hopes for the future. You only have one precious life. Of course, some people who are extremely lucky and have good temperaments may go lucky and receive a second chance.\u201cCough. Back to the serious business!\u201cIf you want to escape from the hands of a powerful cultivator, you will require excellent reactions to danger. This is where I want to emphasize the importance of learning escape techniques. The more escape techniques you master, the greater your chances for survival\u2026\u201dThe sun was setting as the delicious aroma of the meat permeated in the air.A young cultivator was passionately teaching his new junior sister by the clear lake. The little girl, who was munching on the pieces of barbecued meat, was listening attentively.This would definitely be an important lesson that would influence her entire life as an immortal.However, although Little Ling\u2019e could not stop exclaiming about how the lessons made a lot of sense, she felt that something was amiss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She concentrated intensely on the question that was about to be posed.\u201cAssuming that your cultivation has reached the Ninth Stage of the Soul Formation Realm. While flying in the air, you noticed a cultivator who was at the Sixth Stage of the Soul Formation Realm molesting a female cultivator at the Qi Refinement Realm. What would you do?\u201cHere are three options.\u201cOne, you go forwards and bash him up. You will then become the incarnation of justice!\u201cTwo, you throw a Dharma treasure from far away and leave nonchalantly. By doing so, you will ruin his mood.\u201cThree, you pretend that nothing happened and leave from the sides.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked her eyes. The question and options did not seem to be something people of her age could understand.Li Changshou smiled. His eyes formed a thin line as he gave Ling\u2019e a reminder. \u201cThis question only has one correct answer. Make your choice.\u201d\u201cOne?\u201d answered Lan Ling\u2019e, uncertain.Li Changshou replied nonchalantly, \u201cHow do you know if this person has concealed his real cultivation level? What if he is a powerful cultivator who is at the Void Return Realm and merely displayed his cultivation level as the Sixth Stage of the Soul Formation Realm? Normally, those who would do such disgusting things blatantly would definitely be despicable and shameless people. How could you place your hopes on his honesty!?\u201d\u201cThen, two?\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e frowned.\u201cDo not forget that you are a female cultivator as well, Junior Sister.\u201d Li Changshou sighed. \u201cIf the assumptions in option one were true, that beast would become even more brutish when he sees how beautiful you are. Would you be at his mercy as well?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e\u2019s face flushed red. She felt a sudden pang of dizziness hit her. Then she replied timidly, \u201cHowever, Senior Brother, the third option is not something that we cultivators should be doing. When I was young my father told me that my siblings and I should stand up for the weak and punish the bullies. Father said that if everyone chooses not to lend a helping hand to those in need, won\u2019t the victims\u2014\u201d\u201cNo. Junior Sister, you must remember that your idea will only be absolutely correct if you are in a peaceful and kind environment. However, the Primordial World is not a peaceful place. There are countless powerful cultivators around. Cultivators could go to engage in a fight just to obtain one Dharma treasure or spiritual root. Most cultivators who survive are those who are malicious.\u201dLi Changshou looked at the lake surface with his hands behind his back and sighed. \u201cIt is hard for those who are kind-hearted and righteous to survive in this world. The only thing we should do is to prevent ourselves from committing evil deeds. However, there is no need for us to stop others from committing them.\u201cWe should attempt to survive instead of being the hero when we are still weak. When we stand at the pinnacle and become the ones who make the rules, we can then change the environment for the weak in the primordial world.\u201cTherefore, do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e nodded heavily. Her eyes were full of light.At that moment, the martial brother and sister duo did not notice the wisp of smoke that drifted over from the straw hut a short distance away. The smoke floated behind them without a sound.Li Changshou lowered his voice and said, \u201cJunior Sister! I\u2019ll give you another chance. Say your answer out loud happily and firmly! If you see a male cultivator molesting a female cultivator, what should you do?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e eyes sparkled. Although her voice was not very loud, she sounded exceptionally firm. \u201cOption three. Pretend that I did not see anything! And slide away from one side!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Li Changshou could not help but to give his junior sister a big thumbs-up. He felt a little touched by her answer.Li Changshou had achieved such effects with only two days of lessons. If this continued, in a few years\u2019 time, he would not have to worry about his junior sister causing troubles and implicating him!\u2018Having a junior sister who knows how to survive by reducing the amount of attention she gets is truly\u2014\u2019All of a sudden, a gust of cold wind blew behind him. The martial brother and sister duo felt their hair standing. An old and cold voice sounded from behind them.\u201cLi! Chang! Shou!\u201dScre\u2014 Screech\u2014That was the sound of Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s teeth clattering.The corner of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched as he turned around to have a look. He instantly pulled a smiley face.\u201cMaster, you have completed your secluded cultivation? Are you starting with Junior Sister\u2019s lessons today\u2014\u201cMaster! We can talk through this! Why are you taking your horsetail whisk out?\u201cI am your biological disciple! You cannot torture your elder disciple once you found a younger one, Master!\u201d\u201cRascal!\u201dThe old Daoist priest\u2019s long beard was flying in the air, and his eyes bulged wide open. He lifted his horsetail whisk and was about to hit Li Changshou with it.\u201cIt is enough that you are cowardly. How can you teach that to your Junior Sister? I have to teach you a lesson today!\u201dHowever, when the horsetail whisk was about to land, Li Changshou\u2019s silhouette was engulfed by a green light. He instantly appeared on the other side of the willow. He cupped his hands and begged for mercy again.\u201cHow dare you run away using the Wood Escape technique!? You deserve a beating!\u201dQi Yuan was fuming with anger. He raised his horsetail whisk and ran after Li Changshou.Li Changshou\u2019s silhouette drifted backward to avoid his master\u2019s blows. Qi Yuan cast a Dharmic spell, and his horsetail whisk grew insanely long. Shadows of the horsetail whisk encapsulated the ground beside the lake. However, Li Changshou moved like a pond loach. He always seemed to be able to find a hole to slip through.\u201cEase your anger, Master. I did all that with Junior Sister\u2019s interest in mind.\u201d\u201cThe Immortal Du Sect belongs to the school of human cultivators. It is one of the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools! Why do we have someone like you, who is full of unorthodox and evil ideas, in our sect?\u201d\u201cIt was all because of your eye for talent, Master.\u201d\u201cPooh! I am going to kick you out of our sect today! Wa! You are really getting on my nerves!\u201d\u201cMaster, you do not look handsome anymore when you\u2019re angry\u2026\u201dUnder the shade of the willow, Lan Ling\u2019e was originally very worried when she saw Master chasing behind her senior brother. However, she gradually burst out laughing from the \u2018antics\u2019 by her master and senior brother.Lan Ling\u2019e could tell that their master was not actually trying to punish Li Changshou, as the latter managed to escape his blows very easily.After chasing for a while, her senior brother seemed to have slipped and fallen onto the ground. Her master leaped over and pinned him to the ground. He used his horsetail whisk and whipped her senior brother\u2019s buttocks, producing a series of rhythmic sounds in the process.After a while, Qi Yuan had finished punishing his elder disciple. He arranged his Dao robe, which had become a little messy, and shouted at his pitiful disciple, who was lying on the ground, \u201cReflect your actions! You are not allowed to teach your Junior Sister about how to behave in the future! Finish the construction of her straw hut!\u201d\u201cHaiz. Yes. At your command, Master\u2026\u201d\u201cCome over, Ling\u2019e! I shall teach you instead! Forget all the despicable things that your Senior Brother has taught you!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Ling\u2019e answered softly. She looked worriedly at her senior brother\u2019s swollen buttocks that were covered by his robe. That was when she saw Li Changshou\u2019s right hand, which was hidden under his sleeve.Li Changshou waved his right hand at her slightly and showed a thumbs-up sign.Lan Ling\u2019e put her worry behind. She saw how pitiful her senior brother looked as he was lying on the ground, lowered her head, and giggled. Then, she chased after her master, who had left before her.Her steps were gradually quicker, and her walking gradually turned into running.Li Changshou sighed as he lay there. A white cloud drifted towards him and carried him up.\u2018Master had really gone all out!\u2019Li Changshou touched his buttocks and took in a cold breath. Afterward, he sighed once again.If he had known that his master was really going to hit him, Li Changshou would not have let himself be caught.No, he couldn\u2019t do that. He had to take into account his master\u2019s dignity, as well. After all, there was little hope of him ascending to become an immortal. He faced immense pressure, and life was tough for him.From the Dharma spells that his master had used just now, he might seem powerful on the outside, but he was actually weak on the inside. His aiming with his Qi energy was intermittent. That showed that Qi Yuan was overly eager to increase his cultivation realm and had done that too early.Forget about it. Li Changshou had to think of a way to increase his master\u2019s chances of surviving the Heavenly Tribulation.Li Changshou scratched his head and was engrossed in his thoughts as he lay down flat on the cloud. He slowly drifted to the third straw hut that was almost completed.\u2026These few days seemed like a dream.At some point in her nine-year-old life, Lan Ling\u2019e had been shopping in the market with her mother. That had been when she had caught the eye of an old immortal and had been accepted by him as a disciple.Although her parents could not bear to part with her, that had been great news to them. If she could succeed in her cultivation, her family clan could benefit from her glory. Therefore, after the ceremony where she had been officially accepted as his disciple, she had followed her master to the Immortal Du Sect with her mother\u2019s advice in mind.Thereafter, she met her senior brother, who appeared a little strange.Her senior brother had a lot of opinions that sounded correct when one first listened to them but made one sense that there was something wrong with them.Qi Yuan had warned her multiple times that her senior brother was a weird person, and she should not learn from his behavior. However, Lan Ling\u2019e had a gut feeling that her senior brother was a very powerful cultivator.There were not many formalities and rules in the mountain. There were delicious delicacies everywhere in the lake and the mountain. Cultivation was also something that was very interesting. Life was not as boring as Lan Ling\u2019e had previously imagined.Of course, Lan Ling\u2019e was the happiest when she hung out with her senior brother. They would barbeque, feed the fish, and take a stroll together. They would also find mouth-watering wildlife animals to fill their stomachs before sitting quietly beside the lake when her senior brother would share his unorthodox opinions with her.Would such days continue forever?Lan Ling\u2019e heaved a sigh as she snuggled her blanket that was made using an unknown material. She tossed around and faced the window.Suddenly, Lan Ling\u2019e felt that she saw a shadow moving. Her drowsy eyes enlarged slightly, and she was instantly awake due to the shock. Lan Ling\u2019e could not prevent her petite body from trembling.Outside of the window, Li Changshou lay flat on a white cloud and waved at her.\u201cNight lessons, young lady.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Ling\u2019e blinked her eyes. Afterward, she shrank under her blanket and gave a slight nod. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cNow, please listen to the second question!\u201d\u2018Umm. Senior Brother is indeed a weird person.\u2019\u2026Therefore, ten years later\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cChangshou, do you still remember the mantra I taught you yesterday? Recite it for me once.\u201d\u201cLi Changshou! How can you be so afraid of death while pursuing Qi Refinement? If you don\u2019t go all out, how can you obtain your chance?!\u201d\u2018Pui, why is Master always changing his attitude so quickly?\u2019\u2018These two memories are only tens of years apart. When I just entered, Master was so warm and affectionate. Tens of years later, Master is now\u2014extremely fierce!\u2019Li Changshou could not hold in his laugh. A while later, he discovered that his Dao Body seemed to still be in a deep sleep. The exhaustion that developed because of his continuous training could still be felt.\u2018Is this a dream?\u2019He had not dreamt in a long time. The higher one\u2019s cultivation, the less they would sleep. Each time they slept, it would feel like this. Since they spent more time training harder, they would accumulate more exhaustion. Their Dharmic powers might still be full, but they would still require a good sleep to recover and alleviate the accumulated stress in their souls.\u201cOld Tian, Old Tian, don\u2019t act like you\u2019re freaking sleeping! Wake up, Old Tian!\u201dOnce again, he heard that fellow shouting with all his might. The wailing sounded far away, but it was still crystal clear.Li Changshou smiled bitterly. He seemed to turn around in the dark, to face the mess of memories.As the memories came, he felt as if he was appreciating flowers while riding a horse\u2014it was like he was watching another person\u2019s life story.In this story, no cultivators were flying around, nor were any spirits in the sky. Perhaps there were spirits, but they were not known to man.The main lead of the story was Tian Zuguang, and the story took place on an azure planet called Earth.One could tell from Tian Zuguang\u2019s name that the person who named him had high hopes for him. They hoped that he would obtain honor and glory for his ancestors.He had tried his best already. Before he turned 28, his life was quite smooth-sailing. However, once he turned 28, he was diagnosed with an incurable disease.Just before he died, he was seated in a wheelchair, breathing gently. He felt as if the last bit of energy was being plucked out of his body. In his subconscious mind, he was falling into a bottomless abyss.From the bottom of his heart, he felt an intense indignance. It was like the fire he felt for life had erupted all of a sudden. He held onto the arms of his wheelchair and used all the energy left in his body to stand up. However, before he could take a single step, he fell face-first onto the ground.That was the origins of this saying, which his best friend in his previous life was now shouting, \u201cOld Tian, Old Tian, don\u2019t act like you\u2019re freaking sleeping! Wake up, Old Tian!\u201dThe memories stopped. What followed was a little break. That break lasted for about three years. The image that came after that became even clearer.It was of a little boy dressed in open-crotch pants. His hair was braided, and he ran across the field. Very quickly, he matured. When he was seven or eight years old, he bumped into an old immortal. The old immortal took him in as his disciple\u2014that was probably ill-fate!Ill-fate!Li Changshou sighed softly. He sealed this memory and kept it in the deepest recesses of his mind.No matter what, these were the memories he treasured the most\u2014that was true even though the memories were slowly being rubbed away by time.He could not slack or relax. The environment around him was not as peaceful and stable as it looked.That was all Li Changshou could think. He turned around in the dark and felt the exhaustion slowly leave his body. He expanded his spiritual awareness from his body and found that there was nothing out of the ordinary. At that moment, he did not want to wake up.The inertia, which he had not felt in a long time, finally appeared.It was good that he had gotten another chance to live. He was also extremely grateful to the person who had opened the backdoor for him. He did not know if he was a real \u2018great god\u2019, but\u2026Couldn\u2019t he have given Li Changshou the entirety of modern life?Although he could not return to modern life now, he could at least have had a good, stable life if he had been sent back to the prosperous Tang Dynasty or the strong Ming Dynasty. He could have lived his life happily and married three or four women in the process.In a split second, he discovered he had been sent to a world of cultivation and immortals. What\u2019s more, this world seemed to be the most ruthless, emotionless, and ridiculous of its kind\u2014the Ancient Primordial Times!Fifteen years after his Master took him in, Li Changshou relied on the classics in the Immortal Du Sect as well as the various little stories from his Master to understand the environment he was in.From that day onward, he lit the green \u2018self-isolation\u2019 button.That\u2019s right. He came to the ancient world of the afterlife. It was the legendary Primordial Times\u2014the short period between two calamities of the Primordial Times.Looking down the path of the Primordial Times, the effects of the Great Mage-Demon War were still continuing. The humans were celebrating, but the remaining power that the demons held was still immense. What\u2019s more, with the mother of all mankind\u2014one of the six saints, Nuwa\u2014as their security, the demons remained in the various parts of the world. They continued to dream of their resurgence while they fought against the Qi-refining human warriors.The six saints had already taken their places. What\u2019s more, they schemed against one another and caused countless lives to be lost for their little pride.The two elders of the Western School had taken over and practically controlled the West Continent, where there were few spirit meridians. They spread their Western teachings all over, trying to undermine the foundation of Dao Sect non-stop.The three schools in Dao Sect\u2014Ren, Chan, and Jie\u2014had already risen. The twelve Gold Celestials of the Chan School had just made a name for themselves. They were now the hot topic of discussion in the recent thousands of years among cultivators.The 10,000 Celestials of the Jie School were gaining momentum as well. From various paths, strong men were rising up and gathering under the seat of Grandmaster of Heaven. They quarreled with those of Chan School daily, but they did not start any fights.These were the Dao Sect\u2019s best years. The three schools were rising, and bringing the human race up together with them. There were Dao sects all around the Middle Continent. The footsteps of disciples of the three schools could be found all around the Trichiliocosm. As Dao Sect\u2019s Dao heritage spread throughout the Three Realms, Essence Soul Dao and the human race\u2019s cultivators became the mainstream of the Primordial Times.This was also when ordinary cultivators were at their worst. The competition on the path to ascension was extremely fierce. The Heavenly Courts had only just been established a while ago. They acted only in ways that would please the immortals of the three schools. There was no order at all in the five continents and in the entire Trichiliocosm. Cultivators who wanted to grow had to depend on their own hard work and pure luck.Luck played a much bigger part, too!The only thing Li Changshou could celebrate was that while his own Master was not strong\u2014more accurately, he was not strong at all\u2014he had some background in the Ren School.Still, Li Changshou strongly suspected that the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s true founder was just Perfected Du\u2019e\u2019s disciple in name.As for West Kun Lun\u2019s Perfected Du\u2019e, the only thing Li Changshou could recall was that this immortal had nurtured disciples during the Great God-Conferment War. He was then named General Heng of the Heng-Ha Generals. The rest were just irrelevant rumors.Li Changshou was also 80% sure that Perfected Du\u2019e was just Grand Pure One\u2019s disciple in name. Among all the celestials, he did not rank highly at all.As for Li Changshou, he had no background, no mystical abilities, and no luck. How could he make a name for himself in this age?What a joke. It would be good enough if he could survive.Thus, from that year, Li Changshou had set a goal for himself: to survive. He had to live for as long as he could. He wanted to avoid all kinds of calamities and seek peace and stability. He needed to live a good second life, which had not come by easily.It was not in his destiny to stand out from the crowd and become famous.Even if he worked as hard as he could to cultivate, would he be able to overtake the three schools\u2019 leaders?Even if he placed his life on the line to look for chances for himself, would he be able to avoid those so-called sons of misfortune?The next calamity was going to be the Great God-Conferment War. He had to stay as far away from it as possible. Rather than trying to be named a Celestial in the Heavenly Courts, Li Changshou might do better cultivating on his own as quickly as he could. He would rely on the Heavenly Courts while it was in decline. Then, he would be made a Heavenly Court Elder\u2026Civil Servant of the Primordial Times? That was possible.Who cared if he would not be able to obtain a Longevity Fruit? As long as he could peacefully and stably live as long as he was meant to, he would be able to answer to his resurrected self in this life!Thus, from that day onward, Li Changshou\u2019s ultimate goal was to live until he died of old age!For the sake of this goal, he\u2026\u201cSenior Brother?\u201d\u201cSenior Brother!\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, why are you sleeping here? People have started gathering at the main peak. If we don\u2019t head over now, we will be late!\u201dLi Changshou heard a sweet voice by his ear. He stopped letting his imagination run wild and slowly opened his eyes.The person in front of him was a young girl. She had a delicate face, with bright eyes, willow-leaf eyebrows, beautiful ears, and thin lips. These were outstanding features, which went perfectly with her bright-orange face. Her beautiful eyebrows were pulled down in a slight frown, which made her extra loveable. Each eye movement of hers was also filled with spirit.\u201cBeauty, who are you?\u201d\u201cSenior Brother!\u201dThe young woman reached out and pinched Li Changshou\u2019s nose. Then, she lightly rubbed it. \u201cYou\u2019re dazed again!\u201d\u201cAh, Ling\u2019e. In the blink of an eye, you have grown up!\u201dLi Changshou yawned. His body floated above the grass and out. Thirty feet away, he stood upright.\u201cI\u2019ve already been on the mountain for ten years!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e stomped her foot, pouting slightly. She looked unbelievably cute at that moment.It was not just her beautiful face. Now, even her body had matured completely. Her slim legs were very well-proportioned compared to her waist. She had a fairy skirt on, which perfectly complemented the charming curve in the middle of her body. Her skin was white as snow and smooth as silk. She was intoxicating.Ding~The sound of the bell echoed throughout the clouds. Lan Ling\u2019e hurried him. \u201cSenior Brother, quick, ride the clouds! If we don\u2019t go now, we\u2019ll be late!\u201dLi Changshou frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to ride the clouds yet?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e stuck her chest out and raised her chin. Indignantly, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t fly fast!\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Li Changshou replied reluctantly. He summoned a cloud and hopped on it.Lan Ling\u2019 e\u2019s eyes displayed a little slyness. She tapped the grass with her pink cloth shoes and floated next to Li Changshou. She was just about to reach out to grab her Senior Brother\u2019s arm when Li Changshou avoided her.Li Changshou gave her a straight face as he said, \u201cWe already made a pact. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d\u201cI know! Senior Brother, you are really petty!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e whined as she moved half a step to the side, angrily.\u201cThat\u2019s the way. We have to keep a three-foot distance.\u201cYou\u2019re Immortal Du Sect\u2019s rising talent. You\u2019re the Fairy Ling\u2019e in thousands of men\u2019s hearts. Senior Brother doesn\u2019t want to be cursed by their black magic.\u201dLi Changshou reached out and stretched his back. Then, he turned around to look in the direction of the thatched cottage. \u201cIs Master still in seclusion?\u201d\u201cYes, Master is focusing in seclusion. He might emerge to endure the Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation at any time! For all we know, by the time we return, Master might be an immortal already!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e laughed softly, her eyes filled with hope. She turned to her Senior Brother and fell into a daze. Suddenly, she blushed slightly. She pursed her lips, and then said in a soft voice, \u201cThe sect has brought together several groups of disciples to go out and train, but Senior Brother, you have never joined a single one of them. Are you coming this time because you\u2019re worried about me?\u201dA big hand appeared in front of her face. Behind it was Li Changshou\u2019s numb and emotionless expression. Very quickly, he spat out a string of responses.\u201cNo.\u201cPlease pardon me for rejecting you.\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl.\u201cI\u2019ve just always seen you as a little sister.\u201d\u201cHmph, I didn\u2019t say anything! You\u2019re so irritating! I\u2019m not going to care about you anymore!\u201dBlack lines filled Lan Ling\u2019 e\u2019s forehead. Her lips were pouted so that they resembled a little bun. She turned around and showed her angry back view to her Senior Brother, her fists clenched by her side.Li Changshou smiled peacefully. He looked up to the clouds in the sky, calculating which angle they should travel at, and how long it would take for him and his Junior Sister to arrive at the gathering point.However, calculating was useless. With this outstanding Junior Sister by his side, hoping to minimize her presence\u2014it was getting more and more challenging!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e landed in front of Bai Fan Hall, hundreds of other people were already gathered there.From afar, Li Changshou saw that the young men and women dressed in Dao robes and long skirts were chatting and laughing happily. Few people among them were ugly.In this place, there were as many female cultivators as males. Most of them were beautiful and had slim figures. One could say that they were all beautiful in different ways, but a few of them were particularly outstanding. They looked like cranes among a flock of chickens and the moon among ordinary stars.Take Lan Ling\u2019e, who was beside Li Changshou, for example\u2026\u201cIsn\u2019t that Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Ling\u2019e? She is really getting more and more beautiful. I heard that her qualifications are good, too. She only joined our sect ten years ago, but she\u2019s already at the Eighth Stage of Qi Refinement. She\u2019s about to break through into the Soul Formation soon.\u201d\u201cI heard that even the Grand Elder is interested in recruiting her. None of the rest of us have that kind of good fortune.\u201d\u201cWho is that next to her?\u201d\u201cOh, I guess it\u2019s her Senior Brother. I don\u2019t think there are many people on the Little Qiong Peak. This man seems to be among the top 300 people in the sect. I don\u2019t have much of an impression of him.\u201d\u201cI remember. His Dao name seems to be Changshou.\u201d\u201cThis Dao name is really\u2026 simple and ordinary, yet very unique.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t discuss disciples from other peaks behind their backs! Behave yourselves! If the elders of the sect hear this, they\u2019ll think that the people from our sect are ill-disciplined!\u201dThe whispers entered Li Changshou\u2019s ears, but he acted like he did not hear them. The corners of his lips curled up into a small smile. He did not bother scanning to size up the group. Instead, he led Lan Ling\u2019e into the hall to report their attendance. Then, they went to an empty corner to wait.The bell kept ringing. More and more young cultivators flew in from various peaks.This was the Priming Meet that the Immortal Du Sect organized for their disciples every five years. The intention was to allow disciples to see the outside world so that they could improve their cultivation and comprehension.Every sect\u2019s official disciples would casually apply to take part in activities like this. What\u2019s more, there were twelve destinations to choose from, which would cater well to disciples of various stages.The Immortal Du Sect conducted mass-recruitment of disciples every 200 years. That meant that there were 200 years between each generation.It was said that the fastest-progressing disciple in this generation of disciples was already at the Sixth Stage of Void Return Realm. He had already caught up to many other \u2018oldies\u2019 who had spent 1,000 years cultivating but had only average potential.Qi Refinement, Soul Formation, Void Return, Dao Requital. These were the four main realms one had to go through before becoming immortal. They would also decide one\u2019s skills and strength, as well as the upper limits of one\u2019s cultivation and journey after becoming an immortal.Lan Ling\u2019e had only joined the sect ten years ago. The Master she looked up to was someone who did not have much fame and had not even become an immortal yet. Still, she was able to get to the Eighth Stage of Qi Refinement. Naturally, she attracted a lot of attention.Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e kept three feet between them as they sat under the shade of a tree. Many people looked at them\u2014most of these people thought that the relationship between the Senior Brother and Junior Sister was not good.Lan Ling\u2019e folded the shoot of a willow branch and then twirled it gently between her fingers. Several times, she wanted to speak. However, she held herself back each time.The first term of their vow: they had to keep a three-foot distance between them in front of outsiders.The second term of their vow: they could not engage in conversation in front of outsiders if there were nothing meaningful to discuss.\u201cSenior Brother, where are you going?\u201d\u201cGuess.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t tell me. I\u2019ve been asking you for several days now.\u201d Ling\u2019e tutted. Then she softly mumbled to herself, \u201cIn any case, I\u2019m following you wherever you go. I\u2019m going to stick close to you.\u201dLi Changshou smiled nonchalantly, his lips parting. His voice traveled into Lan Ling\u2019 e\u2019s ears\u2014he was using a method of voice transmission.\u201cJunior Sister, you have now achieved at least initial success in all areas of Qi Refinement. It\u2019s time for you to learn to face difficulties independently.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e rebutted indignantly, \u201cI was sent by Master to keep an eye on you. He told me not to let you cause trouble, Senior Brother. You cannot destroy the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s reputation!\u201dLi Changshou smiled slightly but did not say anything in response.The bell rang six times. One by one, figures flew out of the Bai Fan Hall. In total, more than 60 cultivators lined up in the air.Each of them looked different. Some had white hair and wrinkles, while others looked youthful, like 28-year-olds. However, most of them showed maturity and stability.Each of the 63 people seemed to release a bit of their aura. The place in front of the Bai Fan Hall fell absolutely silent. A wisp of immortal light surrounded the figures in the sky.Those were immortals from various peaks. They were in charge of ensuring security during this Priming Meet.A crane cried. A red-crowned, white crane emerged from the clouds and landed on a thin, old man sitting cross-legged.If one took a closer look at this old man, they would see that he had a faint cloud tagging along behind him. On either side of him were two green lotuses. The way he carried himself was extraordinary\u2014not even a bit of his aura leaked, but people around him could feel his majesty.He was the Assistant Sect Lord of the Immortal Du Sect, Exalted Zhong Yu. It was said that he was a Heaven Immortal, among the top ten people in the Immortal Du Sect.Exalted Zhong Yu did not give a long, draggy speech. His eyelids drooped as his lips parted, and his voice echoed throughout the main peak.\u201cAll of you should remember the sect rules as you go out this time. Hold the name of our Immortal Du Sect high. Do not do anything that would bring us shame.\u201cThere will be a total of twelve destinations during this Priming Meet. Recently, there have been reports of demon attacks in several sects in the Coast of the East Ocean. I hope that you can defeat these demons and protect the Dao, as well as our fellow men.\u201cElder Ge, you may begin.\u201dOnce he finished speaking, Exalted Zhong Yu ascended his crane and left. He did not stay a second longer than he needed to. The disciples all bowed down as he took his leave.An elder standing in front of the hall cupped his hands to receive the orders. Then, he shouted, \u201cThose who are heading to the Coast of the East Ocean to kill the demons, stand on the far left. You must be at least at the Sixth Stage of Qi Refinement! Those who are headed there will be rewarded according to the number of demons you kill.\u201dThe disciples below quickly started moving. Nearly half of the disciples headed towards the left. Immediately, that area became crowded.This was a common occurrence during each Priming Meet. Among the twelve destinations, one would always be relatively less dangerous and difficult but would offer generous rewards.Lan Ling\u2019e turned to look at her Senior Brother and noticed that his legs were not moving.\u2018Indeed, Senior Brother was not hoping to reap material benefits\u2026\u2019\u201cJunior Sister, your cultivation level is quite low. Go with the majority.\u201d Li Changshou tried to persuade her using voice transmission. The corners of Lan Ling\u2019 e\u2019s mouth curled downward, as she remained still with her Senior Brother.They listened as Elder Ge continued to shout, \u201cThose who are headed towards the south-east region of the Middle Continent to kill demons, go to the right side to wait. You must be at least at the Eighth Stage of Qi Refinement.\u201dThis time, tens of disciples moved. However, each of them was of relatively high cultivation. All of them were in the Soul Formation Realm.Just like that, Elder Ge kept shouting instructions. One by one, the disciples chose their destinations and went to their assigned area.Elder Ge kept announcing more destinations, but the minimum required cultivation level kept increasing. By the time Elder Ge announced that the minimum cultivation level was the Second Stage of Soul Formation, Lan Ling\u2019e turned to glare at her Senior Brother grudgingly.Her true cultivation level was the Second Stage of Soul Formation.\u201cSenior Brother, where exactly are you going?\u201dLi Changshou kept smiling without saying anything in response.Very quickly, only 23 people remained in their original positions. There were only two more unannounced destinations.Among these 23 people, apart from the Senior Brother and Junior Sister duo in the corner, the rest were Immortal Seedlings from various peaks. These were people selected from this generation of disciples to be specially nurtured. They were also among the top few of all the disciples.Elder Ge glanced at Lan Ling\u2019e and continued shouting, \u201cThose who are headed to Lin Yun Island on the East Ocean, go into the hall to wait. You must be at least at the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation.\u201dAmong the remaining 20-odd people, 17 moved at the same time. All of them released a wisp of their aura\u2014they were all in the Second or Third Stage of Void Return Realm!There were various cheers and exclamations around as the 17 disciples headed into the hall.At that moment, only six people remained in their original positions. All the disciples quickly turned to look at the young woman, dressed in a fiery-red fairy skirt and carrying a broad-bladed sword on her back.The young woman had her eyes closed at that moment, as she remained in her position. She looked like an otherworldly fairy, like an immortal from the Nine Heavens. A few words seemed to float around her body: \u2018Stay away\u2019.She was among the most famous disciples of this generation in the Immortal Du Sect. Not only was she a stunning and natural beauty, but she carried herself exceedingly well, had an immaculate figure, and amazing potential for cultivation. At that moment, she was exposing a wisp of her own aura. She was at the Fourth Stage of Void Return.She had joined the sect more than 60 years ago. Potential like hers was highly valued in the Immortal Du Sect. She had also entered the line of the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2019s Head very early on.\u2018Youqin Xuanya wants to go to the North Continent, too? That\u2019s not bad.\u2019In the corner, Li Changshou smiled subtly. Journeying with such an attention-grabbing machine would take the attention away from himself.Lan Ling\u2019e sniffed around by the side for a few seconds. Suddenly, she discovered an unfamiliar smell.She turned to see Li Changshou\u2019s smile. At the same time, she saw the young lady in the fiery-red fairy skirt shifting back and forth.\u2018Indeed, there is something!\u2019She heard a few hushed discussions in the crowd.\u201cSenior Sister Xuanya wants to go and retrieve herbs from the North Continent?\u201d\u201cSince Senior Sister Xuanya is going to the North Continent, it looks like Senior Brother Yuan Qing will head there as well.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that expected? Senior Brother Yuan Qing hasn\u2019t moved yet. He\u2019s waiting for Senior Sister Xuanya to make her move.\u201d\u201cBe careful of your words and guard your heart. You don\u2019t want to offend either of these cultivation talents from the Heaven-Breaking Peak.\u201dIn the air, Elder Ge frowned and looked at Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e. He slowly shook his head and continued shouting, \u201cThose headed to Chaos Treasure Forest in the south-east region of the North Continent, go into the hall to wait. That place is perilous, and disciples often get hurt inside. You must be at least at the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation!\u201dThe young lady in the fiery-red skirt opened her clear phoenix eyes. She tapped the floor lightly with the tips of her toes. Immediately, her skirt flowed in the wind, making her look like a blooming Fire Spirit Flower. Everyone\u2019s eyes followed her as she flew into the hall.Behind her followed a young cultivator who looked gentle, cultured, and refined. He revealed his own aura\u2014he was in the Fifth Stage of Void Return!His eyes had not left the fiery-red body in front of him. Naturally, this man was the Senior Brother Yuan Qing whom the others were talking about.Li Changshou walked into the hall, as well. Since Youqin Xuanya had already grabbed everyone\u2019s attention, no one seemed to notice him walking in at that moment. This made him extremely comfortable.He had only taken two steps forward when an inexplicable chill ran down his spine. Eyes filled with grudge bore into his back\u2026\u201cSenior Brother, why are you going to the North Continent all of a sudden?\u201dLi Changshou felt a cold breeze blow past his back. He halted, turned around, and replied in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to collect herbs.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother? Don\u2019t we have enough herbs at home? You\u2014\u201d\u201cLittle Qiong Peak[s Ling\u2019e!\u201d A shout came from the sky. It was Elder Ge, frowning at the Senior Brother and Junior Sister duo. He asked, \u201cAre you taking part in this Priming Meet?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e tilted her head upwards and answered, \u201cI am.\u201d She felt everyone\u2019s eyes land on her and immediately blushed.Her expression had been cold just a second ago, but it looked extremely warm now. One could say that she was a natural at changing her expression.Lan Ling\u2019e quickly said, \u201cI have worried you, Elder. I am of low cultivation, and I could not make up my mind. I have decided to follow my Senior Brothers and Sisters to the Coast of the East Ocean.\u201dElder Ge nodded, smiling benevolently. In a warm voice, he said, \u201cTake your position. Don\u2019t delay the good hour to set off.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e heaved a sigh of relief and then turned to look for her Senior Brother. However, he was gone without a trace.\u2018He really\u2026 why would he go to such a dangerous place?\u2019She pouted and whined under her breath, \u201cHe did not even tell me to take care! Take care of yourself, stupid Senior Brother!\u201dWhen she turned around, Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s expression reverted to normal. She walked towards the group of countless handsome men from various peaks with welcoming smiles in the distance.\u2026In the hall, more than ten pairs of eyes landed on Li Changshou, who was standing in the corner. Most of them were filled with suspicion\u2014they had no idea who that man was.Li Changshou quietly exposed his own aura.He was in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation. He had barely passed and was considered average among this generation of disciples.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYuan Qing, Xuanya, you are ranked second and sixth among this generation of disciples. Why do you want to collect herbs?\u201cLiu Yan\u2019er from the Dou Lin Peak, and Wang Ji from the Little Ling Peak, you are also among the top 20 talents in this generation. Why are you all rushing to Chaos Treasure Forest? Are we so petty towards our younger disciples now?\u201cThe North Continent is not a kind place. Nobody chose that place the past two times\u2026 Eh?\u201dIn the corner of the Bai Fan Hall, a female immortal, who reeked of alcohol, tilted her head. She stared at Li Changshou, who was hiding behind the four outstanding disciples. Then, she looked down at the bamboo batten in her hands, before looking up again at Li Changshou. She did this two more times, her expression darkening.\u201cLittle Qiong Peak\u2019s Li Changshou.\u201cWhat is your cultivation level? You\u2019ve just gotten to the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation. Why are you going to Chaos Treasure Forest?\u201cGo, go, go! Go to the East Ocean to fight the prawn demons!\u201dThe female immortal was ruthless with her words, but her reaction was very reasonable. It was evident that she was concerned about Li Changshou\u2019s safety.The female immortal had two wine gourds hanging from her waist, one big and one small. She was dressed very simply, wearing long pants and a short-sleeve top. She had light-brown, medium-length hair. Among the 3,000 female cultivators that had silky, long hair, she was a rare breed.In terms of image, she looked like the random disciples who were collapsing under long periods of stress and giving up on themselves.It was a good thing that she had a cloth belt tied around her waist, a burlap, short-sleeve top that was falling apart, and a suppressive force being emitted from her body from time to time. All of these traits, combined together, allowed people around her to infer that she was a relatively powerful female immortal.That person\u2019s Dao name was Jiu Jiu. She had joined the Heaven-Breaking Peak and looked over 20 years old. In fact, she was about 800 to 900 years old, and she had become an immortal more than 600 years ago. The disciples in her generation were top-notch, too. They could fight on their own now.She was the only guard from the sect who was heading towards Chaos Treasure Forest. One could tell that she was no ordinary woman.Li Changshou maintained a somber expression as he cupped his hands and bowed at the reputable Immortal Jiu. He said, \u201cAunt-Master Jiu, this disciple needs to look for a few herbs. A certain herb can only be found in the North Continent. I will have to trouble Aunt-Master Jiu this time.\u201d\u201cWhat herb?\u201d The female immortal pursed her lips. There was a hint of contempt on that otherwise beautiful face.\u201cI am on good terms with your Master. I\u2019ll give you this. Take it, and go to Elder Qi Ling in the Dao Sutra Pavilion.\u201dWhile she spoke, the female immortal pulled a jade piece out of her top, which was covered in wine. Then, she tossed it to Li Changshou.\u201cTell him to charge it on my monthly account. Take whatever herb you need!\u201cIs North Continent a place that\u2019s suitable for cultivators in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation to go to?\u201cIf you die there, they\u2019ll deduct ten years\u2019 worth of wine money from me. Your crybaby Master will surely come running to me, crying\u2026\u201cAhya, just thinking about it irritates me!\u201dThe two men and women standing by the side looked surprised as their gazes landed on the jade piece.The elders in the sect had jade pieces that certified their identity. Why was she casually handing this over to a disciple in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation, who was not even from the same peak as she was?\u201cAunt-Master.\u201d Li Changshou smiled bitterly, holding the jade piece up and taking two steps forward. He handed the jade piece back to the female immortal and said, \u201cIf I had a choice, I would not want to take the risk at the North Continent, either. However, I am helpless now.\u201cAccording to the sect\u2019s rules, Aunt-Masters cannot reject the requests of disciples to go out and train. Please grant my request, Aunt-Master.\u201dJiu Jiu frowned slightly and focused her attention on the junior bowing in front of her. She tutted and snatched the jade piece back.\u201cReally! That whoever\u2026 Yuan Qing, Xuanya.\u201dThe lady dressed in the fiery-red skirt and the gentle, cultured young cultivator cupped their hands at the same time.\u201cI am here!\u201dJiu Jiu snapped impatiently. \u201cBoth of you take care of him if you have the means to do so.\u201dYouqin Xuanya answered emotionlessly, \u201cYour disciple receives your orders.\u201dYuan Qing glanced at Li Changshou with a hint of warmth in his eyes. \u201cAunt-Master, rest assured.\u201d The corners of his mouth twisted up in a smile as he said kindly, \u201cI will surely look out for Junior Brother Changshou.\u201dJiu Jiu could not help but express her frustration. She turned to Li Changshou and ridiculed him. \u201cHe joined the sect even earlier than you and Xuanya.\u201cReally, Li Changshou, how do you do it? You\u2019ve cultivated for more than 100 years, but you still haven\u2019t reached the Void Return Realm\u2026 Forget it.\u201cGiven the conditions at your Little Qiong Peak, it\u2019s good enough that you can keep up with the majority of the disciples here.\u201d\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Yuan Qing looked awkward, but quickly cupped his hands and bowed. \u201cI apologize, Senior Brother Changshou. Please don\u2019t take this to heart.\u201dLi Changshou smiled slightly and shook his head, emotions filling his heart.A facially-paralyzed woman and a big, warm man\u2014they were very compatible\u2026However, this had nothing to do with him.Li Changshou felt two more glares boring into his back, but he did not bother verifying this. Instead, he thanked Jiu Jiu, and cupped his hands and bowed to Xuanya and Yuan Qing. Then, he retreated behind the four disciples quietly.The two glares were from the remaining two disciples.Liu Yan\u2019er was dressed in a light-yellow silk dress, and Wang Ji was dressed in a green Dao robe. They were both considered expert disciples in the Void Return Realm in this generation. They were both good immortal seedlings.Their glares contained no good intentions, but there were no ill-intentions either. At the very most, there was contempt.Li Changshou stood in his place quietly, listening to the sound of people flying through the air non-stop. Batch by batch, the disciples were being led through the sky by their immortal guards.He released a wisp of spiritual awareness to inspect his storage Dharma artifacts.This was not because he was particularly organized and needed to keep his herbs, Dharma artifacts, and the like separately\u2014the items he stored in these storage Dharma artifacts were all exactly the same. There were pills, Dharma artifacts, spirit stones, and the like, split equally into three groups.The wristband he wore on his left hand was his main storage Dharma artifact. As a precaution, the pendant around his neck acted as a backup storage Dharma artifact. The cloth bag he tied around his thigh was his backup, backup storage Dharma artifact.There was nothing wrong with being extra prepared when one was going out to train. This was especially true when one was going to a dangerous place like the North Continent.This time, Li Changshou brought more than half of all his assets with him.He had given the remainder to his Junior Sister for her own protection.\u2026About half a day later, a huge gourd slowly ascended into the sky in front of the hall.Immortal Jiu Jiu hugged her arms and stood at the mouth of the gourd\u2014her mannerisms looking very extraordinary. The few young disciples stood quietly at various parts of the gourd. All of them were very stable.When the gourd left the big array formation, Immortal Jiu Jiu produced a seal with both her hands. The wine gourd emitted wisps of green light, which formed a layer outside the gourd, separating it from the surrounding wind.Then, Immortal Jiu Jiu pointed towards the north-west direction and slowly sped up.\u201cEveryone, relax. Don\u2019t be nervous. We won\u2019t be under as many rules once we leave the sect.\u201dJiu Jiu yawned and then minded her own business as she sat down at the mouth of the gourd. She rested each of her two legs on either side of the mouth and then leaned back without regard for her image. Casually, she picked up one of the wine gourds hanging around her waist, and a satisfied grin spread across her face.She slowly drank a mouthful of wine, causing her face to flush red gradually. Her sighs and groans were carried away by the wind, and her entire body exuded a sense of self-satisfaction and comfort. Then, she turned around and sized up the five young disciples behind her.The one furthest from her was Li Changshou, who was seated at the back of the gourd.Li Changshou was a distance from the rest of the disciples. He remained tense and did not bother cultivating as the rest were doing. Between his left fingers, he pressed two yellow paper talismans.Liu Yan\u2019er and Wang Ji were seated in the center of the gourd, meditating quietly.The nearest to Jiu Jiu was Youqin Xuanya. She was seated just a foot behind Jiu Jiu. Her sword was lying horizontally in front of her.Behind Youqin Xuanya was the charming and graceful Yuan Qing. He said in a warm tone, \u201cJunior Sister, I will help you find the Fire-Loathing Enlightenment Herb this time.\u201dYet, Youqin Xuanyan frowned slightly and replied nonchalantly, \u201cSenior Brother Yuan Qing, you don\u2019t have to worry about me. This concerns my own cultivation. I don\u2019t need outsiders to interfere.\u201dYuan Qing smiled warmly. \u201cHaving an additional person searching would increase our chances of finding it.\u201dYouqin Xuanya did not say anything in reply. She closed her eyes and remained seated, wisps of flame-like aura encircling her. She looked incomparably beautiful.\u201cPfft.\u201d Jiu Jiu was amused as she watched by the side. She raised her eyebrow at Yuan Qing.Yuan Qing made a helpless expression, and then remained seated three feet away from Youqin Xuanya. His smile slowly dissipated.\u2018Pui, it\u2019s another good show of unrequited love.\u2019Jiu Jiu drank another mouthful of immortal wine, which tasted extremely good and left infinite joy in the aftertaste. Then, reluctantly, she hung the wine gourd back around her waist.She leaned back against the side of the wine gourd, and then looked up to survey the white clouds underneath the blue sky. She seemed to be somewhere else.After flying in this manner for some time, Jiu Jiu could not help but reach for the wine gourd around her waist again. However, she hesitated for a while and then stopped. Then, she said, \u201cWe need two days and three nights to get to the North Continent. Are you planning to sit there and meditate the entire time?\u201cWang Ji, sing a song for Aunt-Master.\u201d\u201cAunt-Master Jiu\u2026\u201d Wang Ji spoke up. \u201cSince when did I know how to sing?\u201dJiu Jiu cast him a contemptuous look. \u201cWhich one of you can? Changshou, can you?\u201dLi Changshou shook his head, maintaining a somber expression. Using his voice transmission technique, he reminded Jiu Jiu, \u201cAunt-Master, there seems to be someone among the clouds behind us.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dJiu Jiu looked up and silently replied Li Changshou via voice transmission as well. \u201cIn the vastness of the five continents, there are many cultivators who know how to fly. Don\u2019t make a big deal out of nothing. We are not far from the Immortal Du Sect.\u201dAlthough she said this, Jiu Jiu released her immortal senses to check. A while later, the wine gourd slowed down at an even pace.A moment later, the wine gourd came to a complete halt in the sky. Jiu Jiu sat down in a relaxed manner, and then shouted, \u201cI wonder what this Dao friend is seeking, following us for such a long time?\u201dThe four other people seated in the wine gourd opened their eyes. They turned to glance at Li Changshou behind them, who had his right hand in his sleeve. His fingers maintained a hard grip around his storage Dharma artifact.From among the clouds behind them, a burly figure emerged. This man was dressed in chain mail, and his expression looked crazed\u2014dense, thick aura formed around him. A huge, broad axe was attached to his back.\u201cAn immortal?\u201dLi Changshou studied him more closely. This person had only ascended to immortality a short while ago. He did not feel much suppressive force from him.A thousand feet from them, the burly man cupped his fists toward Jiu Jiu. Then, he shouted, \u201cI am a front guard from the East Continent\u2019s Hong Lin Country. I have come specially to protect Her Highness, the Sixth Princess. If I have offended you, please forgive me!\u201d\u201cSixth Princess?\u201dJiu Jiu tilted her head and then studied the two female disciples behind her.Li Changshou\u2019s gaze automatically landed on the slightly round-faced and fiery Liu Yan\u2019er. However, Liu Yan\u2019er was looking at the other young female disciple.They heard Youqin Xuanya say in an extremely icy tone, \u201cGo back. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\u2018Princess? Front guard?\u2019\u2018He only appeared when they began their journey to the North Continent?\u2019Li Changshou scrunched up his nose slightly. He smelled\u2026 an inevitable trap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I go back like that, it will be hard for me to explain it to him!\u201cRecently, the enemy countries have been making trouble for us. Our Country Lord is worried that they might assassinate you. Your Highness, please allow me to accompany you on this expedition. Once you get back to the Immortal Du Sect, I will go back.\u201dYouqin Xuanya frowned slightly. There was a hint of frustration on her normally emotionless face.Yuan Qing spoke up to persuade her. \u201cJunior Sister Xuanya, we are going to the North Continent. That\u2019s a dangerous place. With General Yuwen with us, there would be more people to look out for you.\u201dLi Changshou suddenly said matter-of-factly, \u201cJunior Brother Yuan Qing, did you know this general beforehand? I didn\u2019t hear the general report his name earlier.\u201d\u201cEn, that\u2019s right.\u201d Yuan Qing glanced at Li Changshou and smiled. \u201cJunior Sister Xuanya and I grew up together. We also joined the Immortal Du Sect together.\u201cThis general\u2019s name is Yuwen Ling. He is Xuanya\u2019s father\u2019s most trusted general. Normally, he is in charge of guarding Xuanya\u2019s father himself. The fact that he was sent here personally shows that the situation is quite arduous.\u201d\u2018So the facially-paralyzed woman and the big, warm man were childhood friends\u2026\u2019Li Changshou cupped his hands and said, \u201cI spoke too much.\u201dYuwen Ling frowned and shouted, \u201cSixth Princess, Your Highness!\u201dYouqin Xuanya turned to look at Jiu Jiu, who was slumped by the wine gourd\u2019s mouth. There was a pleading look on her face.\u201cDon\u2019t get in our way, don\u2019t get in our way,\u201d Immortal Jiu Jiu lazily said as she waved her hands by the side of the gourd, \u201cSince he is your guard, he can come with us. A burly man who has just ascended to immortality would not be able to cause much trouble in our midst, anyway.\u201cHey, Hunk, sit at the back of the gourd.\u201cDon\u2019t make a sound afterward. It\u2019s not appropriate for me to allow you to come with us. The good thing is that the sect\u2019s rules do not prohibit our disciples\u2019 guards from following us on expeditions.\u201dYuwen Ling cupped his hands and said, \u201cThank you, Immortal Elder.\u201dOnce he finished speaking, the burly man with his huge axe floated to the gourd\u2019s back. Jiu Jiu pointed, and a gap appeared in the immortal glow around the huge gourd.While watching the situation, Li Changshou took two steps to the side expressionlessly. Then, from the side, he walked towards the front of the gourd and cupped his hands, asking, \u201cAunt-Master Jiu, can your disciple sit behind you?\u201dJiu Jiu did not know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cWhy? You\u2019re already more than 100 years old, are you afraid of death?\u201cCome and sit. Your Master said you have a very cautious personality. He was right about you.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Li, please sit here.\u201d Youqin Xuanya stood up willingly. She smiled at Li Changshou apologetically and moved back two steps.\u201cThank you,\u201d Li Changshou replied, nodding. He did not care about the two sharp glares behind him. Instead, he sat down where Youqin Xuanya was seated earlier.The two glares were again coming from Liu Yan\u2019er and Wang Ji. It was obvious that they were offended by Li Changshou\u2019s \u2018rudeness\u2019. They must have thought that he was not behaving as gracefully as disciples from the Immortal Du Sect were expected to.Naturally, Li Changshou chose not to mind them.Immortal Jiu Jiu continued to steer her wind gourd across the sky, towards the north. As if to mock Li Changshou, Liu Yan\u2019er, and Wang Ji started a conversation with Yuwen Ling on purpose.However, Yuwen Ling\u2014this burly man\u2014was quite taciturn. The conversation between the three of them was extremely awkward, and they quickly ran out of things to talk about.Yuan Qing seemed to have had it. He took the initiative to join the conversation. Only then did the mood lighten up, and the conversation flow became smooth.Li Changshou did not even bother turning around. He kept his right hand firmly around his sleeve and released a wisp of spiritual awareness to keep an eye on his surroundings.Before he had decided to go to the North Continent on his own, Li Changshou had pondered about it deeply. He had taken the time to speak to a few attendants in the Bai Fan Hall, who he was close to, until he understood the situation. He had found out that the immortal, who would be guarding the disciples on their trip this time, would be the same one who was in charge of this trip the past few times\u2014Immortal Jiu Jiu.Although Jiu Jiu had been training for less than 1,000 years, her skills could not be underestimated. She also had a set of awesome mystical abilities, and a few pieces of Dharma treasures, which had been given to her by the Sect Master. It was said that her cultivation level was approaching the Heaven Immortal Realm.After ascending to immortality, cultivators normally went through the following realms in order: Essence Immortal, Perfected Immortal, Heaven Immortal, Golden Immortal, Zenith Heaven, and Boundless Chaos. This was known as the Heaven Immortal Dao.The most important thing was that Jiu Jiu was among the few people who were acquainted with his Master.Initially, Li Changshou had thought that few people would head to the North Continent to train. With this immortal\u2019s protection, he would be much safer than if he had gone there on his own.However, he did not expect that he would encounter such a situation along the way.Li Changshou stole a glance at Yuan Qing and Yuwen Ling and quietly began to ponder. He closed his eyes slowly. He was in no mood to cultivate. Instead, he remained vigilant to activate his Wind Escape.It was a good thing that he was seated closer to Aunt-Master Jiu. He felt safer.\u2018Er?\u2019\u201cHehehe\u2026 I\u2019ll just have a little sip. We\u2019re still a long way from our destination. Nothing could go wrong, nothing could go wrong\u2026\u201dImmortal Jiu, who was still seated at the mouth of the gourd, smiled strangely. She hugged her wine gourd filled with wine and sipped at it stealthily. Her face flushed even redder as she licked her lips, savoring the taste of the wine.Li Changshou was rendered speechless.Indeed, he should find a reason to leave the team and advance on his own.His Master was his priority.\u2026Half a day passed, and he still hadn\u2019t spoken.The sun was setting in the west as if fighting with the stars in the sky.Seated on the wine gourd, which measured more than 100 feet, surrounded by a mild immortal glow, and smelling the alcohol in the air, Li Changshou held up a bamboo slip and read quietly.The others, including Yuwen Ling, who was seated right at the back, were already cultivating.Jiu Jiu\u2019s eyes were half-open. She lay down at the front of the wine gourd, allowing the wind to mess up her short hair. Indeed, she looked very different from most other immortals. However, one could also say that she looked full of character.Li Changshou quietly appreciated the Dao technique recorded on the slip, imagining how the Dao technique would work. However, he never retracted his spiritual awareness. He remained on the lookout for any danger within 100 feet of himself.This was because he had intentionally gone through cautious training before. For him, this was not much of a burden.A wine gourd suddenly appeared in front of his eyes. Li Changshou shook his head with a somber expression and said, \u201cThank you, Aunt-Master. Your disciple does not take kindly to wine.\u201d\u201cBoring,\u201d Jiu Jiu replied, rolling her eyes. She jumped up from the \u2018stopper\u2019 of the wine gourd and sat at the edges of the wine gourd\u2019s mouth. Gently, she swung the cleanest part of her body\u2014her slender legs.She burped, and then asked seemingly subconsciously, \u201cChangshou, your Master is going to ascend to immortality soon, right?\u201d\u201cThe tribulation should be about three to five years away,\u201d replied Li Changshou while setting his book down on his legs. He turned his attention to Aunt-Master Jiu in front of him.Jiu Jiu was actually one of the few people who would go to the Little Qiong Peak after Li Changshou joined the sect about 100 years ago.\u201cAi.\u201d Jiu Jiu sighed. She turned her back to Li Changshou and began to educate him in a deliberately aged tone.\u201cWe got along quite well back then. Your Master is pitiful. His potential was not bad, but after he was injured, his Dao base suffered. Until now, he is having difficulty making up for it.\u201cChangshou, don\u2019t despise your Master just because he hasn\u2019t ascended to immortality yet. His understanding of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Dao techniques is not worse than any 1,000-year-old immortal\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, Aunt-Master?\u201d Li Changshou smiled slightly, causing his eyes to narrow as well. Extremely few people, apart from his Master and Junior Sister, had ever seen this expression on his face.Li Changshou said, \u201cMy Master has always been giving his best to teach my Junior Sister and I. To me, Master is like my parent.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, what is up with your cultivation level? It\u2019s been so many years, but you\u2019re still at the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation. You can\u2019t even break through the Void Return Realm?\u201dJiu Jiu turned around to stare at the Little Qiong Peak. \u201cWhen your Aunt-Master joined the sect, I heard people say that your Little Qiong Peak was filled with bad luck. It looks like that\u2019s quite true.\u201cShow me your hand. I will see your potential. I remember your potential being quite good when you joined the sect, right? Don\u2019t tell me that foolish Master of yours really messed you up!?\u201dLi Changshou immediately frowned. \u2018Aunt-Master Jiu has good intentions, but\u2026\u2019If she came into contact with Li Changshou\u2019s body and inspected it, given her formidable skills as a Perfected Immortal, she would surely be able to tell Li Changshou\u2019s true cultivation level despite his use of Dharma spells to hide it!Jiu Jiu was already reaching out towards Li Changshou with her alcohol-scented right hand. He subconsciously rubbed his bottom and smiled shyly. \u201cAunt-Master, men, and women should not get too close. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\u201cMen and women should not get too close? Who said that? I\u2019ve never heard that!\u201dJiu Jiu immediately cast Li Changshou a look of contempt. \u201cThe cultivators in my generation chase freedom. We want to live our lives freely. Why should you care about the customs and rules of the world?!\u201cHurry, show me your hand!\u201cHas something gone wrong with your cultivation? I remember that your potential was quite good.\u201d\u201cAunt-Master, that\u2019s inappropriate! Your disciple found out a few years ago that I will convulse all over whenever I come into contact with females!\u201dLi Changshou stood up suddenly and turned away. Two images emerged from his body as he quickly and smoothly appeared again behind Youqin Xuanya, smiling bitterly at Jiu Jiu.Jiu Jiu blinked, suddenly realizing something.\u2018The footwork that this fella used as he moved his body\u2026\u2019\u201cDragon Swimming Across Clouds? That\u2019s not bad, brat. You\u2019ve learned such difficult footwork?\u201d Jiu Jiu\u2019s expression became strange. \u201cYour Master said that you were only interested in escape techniques. You haven\u2019t been spending the past hundred years on this, have you?!\u201d\u201cYour disciple has always been working hard on cultivating. I have never been re\u2014 What!?\u201dHe felt a soft touch.Li Changshou looked down and saw fair, slender fingers gently stroking his inner thigh. A few black lines immediately appeared on his forehead.He traced the slender fingers with his eyes, down to a smooth, fair arm, which resembled an exquisite statue made out of Mutton Fat white jade. He continued to trace the arm and saw a fiery-red shoulder strap, collar, and finally a slightly-tilted, slightly-curious, charming face.Youqin Xuanya!\u2018Found out a few years ago that I will convulse all over whenever I come into contact with females!\u2019The corners of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth kept twitching wildly, but he made a decision a split second later.This was one ruthless person. He had no regard for his outer-appearance now. His entire body began to tremble, and he gritted his teeth as he caused his own muscles to twist and turn. His face was contorted with pain, and his eyes rolled back as white foam began to form in his mouth.\u2018D*mn it! Youqin Xuanya, aren\u2019t you an ice mountain?! Wretch!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Senior Brother, please be magnanimous.\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s expression remained somber as he was seated at the front of the wine gourd. He watched Youqin Xuanya as she cupped her hands and bowed her head. In his heart, he wanted very badly to curse her. Yet, he had no choice but to simply say that it did not matter.Li Changshou felt that the gazes of the others were no longer filled with content and dissatisfaction. Instead, they were filled with pity and sympathy.\u201cChangshou,\u201d Jiu Jiu coughed. She said in a sincere tone, \u201cThis must be a mental demon. Perhaps it\u2019s a result of being cooped up on that mountain, cultivating with your Master.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Changshou.\u201d Yuan Qing floated to Li Changshou\u2019s side, holding a bottle of pills. He said in a low voice, \u201cThese are pills to clear your heart and focus your mind. Perhaps they will help Senior Brother\u2019s condition.\u201d\u201cThank you, I appreciate it.\u201dLi Changshou smiled awkwardly. Yuan Qing seemed to understand something at once. Adeptly, he changed the topic.Li Changshou took this chance to observe everyone else\u2019s reaction.Yuwen Ling remained unfazed by the entire fiasco. He sat quietly in the corner with his eyes closed, fully focused on his own meditation.Liu Yan\u2019er was looking at Li Changshou with pity in her eyes, while Wang Qi was looking at him with sorrow.He was probably thinking, \u2018This Senior Brother (or Junior Brother) has average cultivation potential, and even has to deal with a mental demon like that. Finding a Dao companion in the future will probably be considered a luxury for him. His cultivation journey will be difficult.\u2019Finding a Dao companion to cultivate together with was an oft-sighted thing within the Immortal Du Sect.After Yuan Qing finished talking about random things, he walked to the back of the wine gourd. Wang Qi then stepped up to chat with Li Changshou.Li Changshou maintained a subtle smile the entire time, without saying much in reply.Apart from Yuan Qing, the other disciples of his generation, who had their minds fully set on cultivating, were considered old in age, but their thinking was exceptionally naive.That was right. These few disciples of his generation were the cream of the crop. Most of their time was spent on cultivating and training. They had few opportunities to socialize.This little fiasco quickly came to an end.A while later, peace was restored in the wine gourd. Everyone went back to cultivating and meditating, while Li Changshou picked up his bamboo slip and began reading it again. His mood was not affected in the least bit.Immortal Jiu Jiu hugged her arms and sat cross-legged, right in front of the wine gourd. At that moment, she was deep in thought. She was thinking about how to help Li Changshou deal with his mental demons and resume cultivating happily.\u2018Do I have to use the beauty of women? I have to cure the ill with poison?\u2019Immortal Jiu looked down at herself, as a sly grin spread across her face.Li Changshou did not mind the new addition to his \u2018character settings\u2019.Although he had only done this to avoid Aunt-Master Jiu from discovering his true cultivation level and potential, he would have to remember this little detail for the rest of the journey.In any case, remaining cautious was not going to be difficult for Li Changshou.\u201cSenior Brother Changshou,\u201d a voice called out from behind him. Li Changshou turned around to see Youqin Xuanya looking at him apologetically.Li Changshou really wanted to say, \u201cPlease be as aloof and proud as an Ice Mountain Beauty should be.\u201d However, he had no choice but to smile slightly and wave his hand, gesturing for her not to say anything more. Then, he turned back around and continued reading.Youqin Xuanya pursed her lips, the apologetic look not leaving her face.With his spiritual awareness, Li Changshou caught the slight frown on Yuan Qing\u2019s face, even as he had his eyes closed.\u2026After two days, they slowly passed by the East Continent, which had a huge land area, few people, and many immortal sects.For the entire journey, the huge wine gourd had been flying among the clouds. Day and night, it did not rest. Finally, they made it to the north-west region of the East Continent.Li Changshou did not cultivate the entire journey. Instead, he focused all of his attention on the small area around him. He could even see the figures flying through the sky from time to time.It was a good thing that they did not meet with any obstacles along the way.Jiu Jiu stretched her body as the huge wine gourd slowed down and flew downwards, towards the towering mountains and precipitous ridges below.Immortal Jiu yawned, and then shouted at the people behind her, \u201cBe alert! We\u2019re going to enter the boundaries of the continent.\u201cAll of you, listen up!\u201cThe North Continent is not a kind place. You are coming here to train! Do not risk your lives to obtain any treasures or herbs.\u201cI will bring you to an entry point to the North Continent after this. Remember this place. If you want to come to the North Continent on your own in the future, do not try to barge in blindly.\u201dThe five disciples stood up at once, cupping their hands and bowing to Immortal Jiu. Together, they said, \u201cYes, Aunt-Master, we understand.\u201dJiu Jiu nodded, satisfied.Liu Yan\u2019er asked softly, \u201cAunt-Master, isn\u2019t the North Continent one of the four continents? Why are there entry points? Could the Miasma Qi here have formed a natural array?\u201dJiu Jiu pursed her lips and said nonchalantly, \u201cWho among you knows? Explain it to her.\u201dYuan Qing, who was standing behind, smiled and said, \u201cTo cultivators in the Void Return realm, who already have knowledge of the Heavenly Cycle, Miasma Qi in the North Continent is not hard to fend against.\u201cThe most troublesome things here are the poisonous insects and herbs born out of the Miasma Qi, as well as the ferocious and poisonous beasts all around. They are extremely hard to deal with.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant!\u201dJiu Jiu rolled her eyes and chided Yuan Qing. \u201cShe\u2019s asking why there are entry points. What are you talking about?\u201dYuan Qing smiled awkwardly, and could only cup his hands.Yuwen Ling said in a low voice, \u201cBecause of the demons.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s because of the demons. The hunky general knows his stuff.\u201dJiu Jiu looked down and steered the huge wine gourd towards a valley in the mountainous region. With a serious expression, she said, \u201cHumans have gathered in the South Continent, leaving the North Continent to the mage race.\u201cIn ancient times, a few Saints chopped off the four legs of a Connate Black Turtle in order to hold the crumbling sky up. These formed the heavenly pillars.\u201cThe Black Turtle felt deeply resentful and frustrated. Hence, it used its huge body and boundless skills to turn into the Miasma Qi in the North Continent, which cannot be dissipated until this day. Look towards the north-west region. That\u2019s not a rain cloud.\u201dThe few disciples turned to the north-west region at the same time. At that moment, they were already very close to the mountain peaks. It was the perfect spot from which they could see the gray, billowing clouds covering the sky.The clouds looked formless and vast.Jiu Jiu spoke again. \u201cThe Miasma Qi has given birth to many poisonous insects and herbs so that ordinary living beings cannot go near them. In recent times, this place has also become the breeding ground of many strange flowers and fruits. There are many different types of ferocious and poisonous beasts in there. Even Heaven Immortals who come here don\u2019t dare to go too deep into the continent.\u201cAfter the Great Mage-Demon War, the remnants of the mage race were let loose here. They went to the extreme north of the North Continent. There, it was icy and snowy, and there were fewer insects and demons as a result. They tried hard to survive, but it is said that they are on the verge of extinction. It is quite a pity.\u201cThe demons, who harbored deep-seated hatred towards the mage race, as well as the demons that had been chased away by human cultivators, have all gathered at the North Continent too.\u201cAs time went by, this narrow region, which expanded by about tens of thousands of kilometers from east to west, became the most important living space for demons.\u201dAt that point, Jiu Jiu surveyed the expressions on the disciples\u2019 faces and found that apart from Li Changshou, everyone else looked quite nervous.The effect was not bad. She could try harder.Jiu Jiu clicked her tongue, smiled, and continued in a low voice, \u201cLook at the mountains around you. There are many great and old demons hidden there. Some of them have terrifying skills, and they love to eat human cultivators for dessert.\u201dThe disciples looked even more shocked, but Li Changshou nodded calmly, looking down.Jiu Jiu finally lost interest. She pointed below the wine gourd and said expressionlessly, \u201cThe town underneath us is the entry point to the North Continent that the experts of our human race have worked hard to establish. It is said that the demons have stopped fighting in these thousands of years as well. I don\u2019t know when they will start all over again.\u201cWhen we enter the town, I will bring you to buy Miasma-Repelling Talismans and Detoxifying Pills.\u201cWe have these in our sect as well, but due to some rotten rule set by somebody I don\u2019t know, I have to allow you to experience the life of independent cultivators. I have to teach you how to trade.\u201cRemember, you cannot randomly fly into the sky of this town. There are various high-level cultivators keeping watch here. They have to exercise a certain amount of caution towards other cultivators. We will land at the hillside in the south-east region, and walk a short distance there.\u201dThe five disciples cupped their hands and received the orders, bearing Immortal Jiu Jiu\u2019s words in their mind.This town was located in a valley. On either side of the valley were sheer cliffs and precipitous rock faces. Grottos had been carved into these cliffs and rock faces. There were also walkways and stairs.Different types of structures filled the valley. From afar, it looked quite messy.There were imposing and well-lit palaces and lofty and majestic pagodas. However, there were more structures made out of wood and soil. There was no order to the entire town. One could only see narrow pathways that they could barely pass through.Of course, most cultivators could fly in the sky. There was no need for them to walk.One could tell that many cultivators came to the North Continent. Many people passed through this place. Thus, many cultivators would set up stalls at the top of their wooden or soil buildings. One could find various herbs and treasures produced in the North Continent at these stalls.These herbs and treasures were mostly marked \u2018poisonous\u2019.Jiu Jiu was familiar with the area. She summoned a white cloud and led the five disciples and Yuwen Ling halfway across the town. She compared various stalls, left and right, before finally asking them to take their spirit stones out to buy pills and talismans at a good bargain.\u2018Eh? Why is this brat not moving?\u2019Jiu Jiu looked at Li Changshou, who remained behind her with his hands clasped behind his back. Her heart dropped slightly. At once, she retrieved a purse and tossed it over her shoulder, right into Li Changshou\u2019s hands.Purses like these were considered simple storage Dharma treasures. Normally, they were used to store a set amount of spirit stones.Jiu Jiu spat, \u201cI knew that your Master wouldn\u2019t have much to give you. I just don\u2019t understand why he wants to guard that little mountain.\u201cDetoxifying Pills and Miasma-Repelling Talismans are necessary. Go and buy some. A man should not be dawdling!\u201dLi Changshou was stunned. He looked up at the Aunt-Master in front of him, who did not like dressing up, and could not help but smile warmly.Only his Master and Junior Sister had ever seen a smile like that on his face.He was just about to explain that he had already prepared everything he needed. However, before he could speak, a slender hand stretched out beside him. That hand held a stack of yellow paper talismans, and two, fat, ceramic bottles.It was the young girl dressed in the fiery-red skirt, with a huge sword hanging on her back.Youqin Xuanya turned to look elsewhere, trying her hardest to stay calm as she said, \u201cTake it as an apology to Senior Brother. Before this\u2026\u201dAs she spoke, her fingers twitched. Skilfully, she transported the pills and talismans straight into Li Changshou\u2019s hands. Then, she turned around and acted like nothing had happened, as she surveyed the stall next door.Li Changshou\u2019s interest was piqued. He cupped his hands towards her back but said nothing else.\u2018This Ice Mountain really does not live up to her name.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf one were to travel about 150 kilometers toward the north from this town, they would arrive at the boundaries of the North Continent\u2019s Miasma Qi. At the extreme end, the region was the training ground for disciples of the Immortal Du Sect\u2014the Chaos Treasure Forest.Outside the Miasma Qi, there was a bare desert mountain. It was a stark contrast to the unending blackness of the jungle covered in Miasma Qi. This contrast also drew an obvious border between the two regions.As they got closer to the forest covered in Miasma Qi, Jiu Jiu seemed to be a whole other person. Her eyes were filled with caution and wariness, as her immortal senses inspected the area within tens of kilometers from them. Every gust of wind and movement of the grass was checked.She led the group to fly at a low altitude. Then, she used a good amount of immortal power to conjure a white cloud. The huge wine gourd shrunk to about three feet, and she hung it on her back. The mouth of the wine gourd continued to glow light-blue. It looked like it was ready to fly out and spit at people at any moment.At last, when they reached the Miasma-Qi-covered forest border, Jiu Jiu got off the white cloud, turned around, and addressed the five disciples.\u201cAccording to the rules, each expedition should last 20 days. The timer starts from the moment you enter the Chaos Treasure Forest. If you come out on your own, anytime before the end of these 20 days, your expedition will be counted as a failure. You will then return to endure the punishment.\u201dJiu Jiu blinked, her tone suddenly easing. \u201cActually, the punishment is as simple as a deduction of your monthly allowance or something. You won\u2019t get seriously hurt. If you run into danger, survival is most important. If you find it too tiring, come out at once. Don\u2019t force yourself to stay in there. I will wait for all of you here. Since this expedition is meant to push you beyond your limit, I cannot follow behind you all the time. I also cannot become your personal bodyguard. The hunk will stay here as well. You will wait for her here.\u201dYuwen Ling cupped his hands and made a request. \u201cI came on orders to protect Her Highness, the Sixth Princess. Immortal Elder, please allow me\u2014\u201dJiu Jiu calmly interrupted, \u201cDo you want to stay here on your own or be tied here by me?\u201dYouqin Xuanya spoke up from the side. \u201cGeneral Yuwen, please stay outside. Follow Aunt-Master Jiu\u2019s instructions.\u201d She seemed faintly imposing as well. It was obvious that she had given countless orders growing up.Yuwen Ling answered in a low voice, \u201cThis General receives your orders!\u201d Then, he frowned and turned to Yuan Qing.Yuan Qing immediately said, \u201cGeneral Yuwen, do not worry. I will protect Junior Sister Xuanya even if it costs me my life.\u201dYouqin Xuanya gave no response whatsoever. Instead, she maintained her icy-cold expression, which she put on daily.On the other hand, Li Changshou, who had been standing behind Jiu Jiu the entire time, turned to study Yuan Qing and Yuwen Ling.\u2018Indeed, there is something fishy going on with these two.\u2019Jiu Jiu cleared her throat and continued, \u201cI will give you all two warnings. First, help each other out when you get inside. Remember that you are from the same sect. Take care to avoid moving on your own. Yuan Qing, Xuanya, both of you are of higher cultivation levels. If you have extra energy, look out for the others.\u201dYuan Qing smiled and answered, \u201cRest assured, Aunt-Master.\u201dYouqin Xuanya also answered, \u201cYour disciple receives your orders.\u201dImmortal Jiu Jiu added, \u201cSecond, do not push your luck. Do not risk your lives to look for herbs. Ferocious beasts would normally guard the most valuable herbs. These ferocious beasts are not stupid, and you are the greatest nourishment they would get.\u201dAt that point, Jiu Jiu suddenly made a move. Her left hand shot out as quickly as an illusion, as she gently pinched Youqin Xuanya\u2019s face. \u201cEspecially fine, tender, premium-grade meat like yours!\u201d\u201cAunt-Master, please maintain your dignity,\u201d said Youqin Xuanya, frowning.Jiu Jiu sniggered by the side. \u201cWhoa, so smooth. I really envy you, natural beauties. Your Aunt-Master doesn\u2019t have what it takes. My skin is so dry. I also don\u2019t have anyone behind me shouting, \u2018Junior Sister Jiu Jiu, Junior Sister Jiu Jiu\u2019 all day.\u201dWhile joking, Jiu Jiu retrieved five crescent-shaped jade stones. She tossed one into each of the five disciples\u2019 hands.\u201cHere, this is a communication jade in case you need any help. If you run into any trouble, just break it. Your Aunt-Master will be able to sense it, and I will go and help you at once.\u201cUsing the communication jade means that you give up on your expedition. When you get back, they will deduct your monthly allowance. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201cGo, go. Be careful! Don\u2019t die in there!\u201dThe five disciples kept their communication jades, cupping their hands and bowing to Immortal Jiu Jiu one by one. Then, they stuck on their respective Miasma-Repelling Talismans. With Youqin Xuanya and Yuan Qing at the front of the group, they headed into the Miasma-Qi-covered Forest.Li Changshou remained half a step behind them because he first stuck the Miasma-Repelling Talisman on his Dao robe. Then, he swiftly lifted up the inner-layer of his robe and stuck another talisman on his inner thigh. Finally, he stuck a third talisman at the back of his collar on his inner shirt.This would cover all bases. There would be no need for him to worry that the talismans would fall off on their own. He would just have to take care to change them every few days.He heard the sound of the wind, as a pair of footsteps quickly traveled towards him.Li Changshou looked disheveled as he took two steps forward, easily dodging the figure running towards him.Jiu Jiu chided him in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re still not going? Remember to follow them closely! You are only in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation! You\u2019re such a careful person, what are you doing in such a rotten place?!\u201d\u201cTake care, Aunt-Master.\u201d Li Changshou turned and cupped his hands, the corners of his lips twitching slightly. He sent a voice transmission to Immortal Jiu at the same time.Then, he walked away briskly, trailing at the back of the group of five.The Miasma Qi engulfed them. Immediately, the Miasma-Repelling Talismans of the four people in front emitted a soft glow. A thin, transparent protective layer appeared around each of their bodies.Li Changshou\u2019s situation was more amazing. Three layers were covering his body so that even breathing felt difficult. However, the air that he tried hard to breathe in felt especially fresh.Wang Ji cleared his throat and said, \u201cSenior Brother Changshou can come with me later on. I\u2019m just here to try my luck. I\u2019m not looking for any herbs in particular. Junior Brother Yuan Qing and the others need not be burdened.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201d Li Changshou smiled at Wang Ji knowingly, while the latter raised his eyebrows in response. A kind of chemistry had developed between the two\u2014this was probably chemistry among lightbulbs.\u2026While moving around within the North Continent, those who had not yet ascended to immortality had to avoid flying. Three feet above the ground, the Miasma Qi would feel extremely thick. What\u2019s more, with so many poisonous insects and ferocious beasts around, it would be much safer for them to remain on the ground.At that moment, there was only one path to take. What looked like burnt, black wood lined that pathway. Most of the branches there did not have leaves on them. However, another type of life seemed to flow within them.As the five of them walked down the path, they tried to expand their spiritual awareness as much as possible. From time to time, they would spot one or two poisonous beasts, hiding in the darkness and watching the invaders coldly.There seemed to be no daylight in the forest, and danger lurked in every corner.The Chaos Treasure Forest contained several types of treasures and tens of different types of herbs. However, since they were at the extreme end of the forest, where the risks were the lowest, 70 to 80% of the herbs had already been taken away by human cultivators and demons. It was undoubtedly going to be quite difficult for the five to find the spiritual herbs they wanted.What\u2019s more, the herb that Li Changshou was looking for was not within the Chaos Treasure Forest. It was located deeper into the region.As they walked, Li Changshou retrieved a map made of sheepskin, which was as big as his palm. He looked at the different markings he had made on the map and confirmed the direction he had to travel in later on.First, he had to look for a good reason to leave the group. Most importantly, he had to ensure that Aunt-Master Jiu, who was stealthily following them in the sky, would not step out to stop him.After about an hour, the forest became even darker\u2014the stench of something rotting filled the air. Groups of insects were crying out, and the predators hidden in the darkness kept their eyes on the five living and breathing beings, waiting for the opportunity to pounce.In the swamp scattered with bones, there were seductive but poisonous flowers and fruits seated on high trees, and demonic spiders laughing cruelly.The few disciples from the Immortal Du Sect were considered skillful, daring people. As time went by, they walked quicker and grew accustomed to their surroundings.Li Changshou followed closely behind the four of them. At that moment, he was still far from the place where he had to change direction. Thus, he felt no urgency to leave the group.All of a sudden, they heard the stifling roar of a beast. The poisonous insects\u2019 crying was suddenly amplified, as a ferocious and fiendish energy aura surged towards them!A poisonous beast could no longer resist\u2014it was going to attack them!Youqin Xuanya, who was right in front of the group, immediately raised her hand to stop everyone from moving forward. The huge sword on her back began to tremble slightly.Yuan Qing gently shook his right hand, and a green immortal sword flew into his palm. He looked especially threatening, ready to attack at any moment.Just as the four people in front of him turned their attention to the black figure rushing out of the forest on their front-left, Li Changshou turned to the right. He took one step forward, stood behind Wang Ji, and said, \u201cBe careful, on the right.\u201dThe moment Li Changshou finished speaking, a ten-feet-tall, black figure jumped out from their front-left!This was a black-skinned leopard, which had two wings growing out of its back. Its front claws flashed black and green. The moment it appeared, it jumped towards the four of them at once!Yuan Qing shouted in a low voice, \u201cEvil Beast, you\u2019re courting death!\u201d A gentle breeze blew past Youqin Xuanya as he rushed past her. An eight-inch beam of green light shot out of the edge of the three-foot sword. His footwork released many remnant images underneath his feet!Out of the sword-light emerged an elongated \u2018Z\u2019. Just as the black leopard raised its claws, its black blood shot towards the sky!At once, its body was cut into multiple different pieces!At that moment, two black figures jumped out from the front-right side of the forest and headed straight for Liu Yan\u2019er and Youqin Xuanya.\u201cLet me!\u201d shouted Wang Ji, rushing to Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s side. Flames now surrounded both of his hands, and he waved them at the two black leopards, attempting to force them back.However, before his flames exploded, a fiery-red figure brushed past him. The sword that she hadn\u2019t unsheathed before cut through the air. As the sword brushed past them, the two black leopards immediately flew backward, like two huge sandbags.It was just a single wave of the sword. There was no follow-up move. Yet, the two black leopards were already high up in the sky. Two fiery-red lotus flowers appeared in the leopards\u2019 bodies. They exploded, blowing the bodies into pieces. The flames completely swallowed the remains and black blood!In the blink of an eye, nothing remained of the two black leopards.Wang Ji smiled awkwardly, retracting the balls of flames in his hands and stepping backward.Li Changshou\u2019s eyes brightened. \u2018This Youqin Xuanya has mastered the Nine Lotus Li Fire Skill?\u2019The three black leopards had been killed in the blink of an eye. The number of eyes that were fixed on these five disciples from within the darkness halved.The five of them took their places once again and got on their way. Youqin Xuanya and Yuan Qing began to display simple footwork, but the three people behind them could keep up easily.That was until a fork appeared in the path. Then, the group came to a stop at the same time.Youqin Xuanya turned around and said, \u201cSenior Brother, Senior Sister, I am going in this direction to look for the Fire-Loathing Enlightenment Herb. It was recorded in our sect that people have spotted this herb in this direction. Please take care of yourselves. Don\u2019t go too far in.\u201dLiu Yan\u2019er also said that she was searching for a herb, and was headed in the other direction.The group began to split up. Naturally, Yuan Qing was going to stick with Youqin Xuanya. He had come specially to help and protect her.Wang Ji was there to experience the outside world. At the same time, he agreed to help Liu Yan\u2019er look for the herb she wanted.Thus, the four of them all turned to Li Changshou.\u201cI\u2019m going this way. I have to separate from all of you now,\u201d said Li Changshou while pointing in a completely different direction.Youqin Xuanya asked, \u201cSenior Brother Changshou, what herb are you looking for?\u201dLi Changshou answered seriously, \u201cIt\u2019s not convenient for me to say. However, don\u2019t worry about me. Take care.\u201dYuan Qing tried to persuade him. \u201cSenior Brother Changshou, why not go with Senior Sister Yan\u2019er\u2014\u201dBefore Yuan Qing could finish speaking, Li Changshou took one step towards the path he chose. He employed simple footwork and floated away, his hair not even dancing in the wind. Still, very quickly, he disappeared around the corner into the forest ahead.\u201cReally, he\u2019s taking our good intentions for granted,\u201d Liu Yan\u2019er muttered irritably.Yuan Qing and Wang Ji shook their heads as well. They guessed that Li Changshou was just being proud, and he wanted to prove himself too badly.Youqin Xuanya, on the other hand, seemed to have something on her mind. She turned around and began walking on the path she selected. Her back view, coupled with the sword on her back, looked more delicate than before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did he have to go on a third path?!\u201dAmong the clouds above the Chaos Treasure Forest, Jiu Jiu was seated atop a grey cloud. She smacked her knee in frustration, and then picked up a wine gourd to take a huge gulp. She wanted to resolve the worry in her heart.She did not expect so many disciples to come to the North Continent during this Priming Meet. Four of them were even among the most treasured immortal seedlings in the sect. She could not allow anything to happen to them.Now, five of them were being so bold as to split into three groups. Jiu Jiu began to feel pressured.\u2018They are all really young cows that do not fear tigers! Youths who know no fear!\u2019Yet, Jiu Jiu recalled what she was like when she was still a young disciple. Wasn\u2019t she just as ambitious as they were?Jiu Jiu picked up her wine gourd and removed the stopper. Then, she paused and replaced it.\u2018Forget it. I\u2019ll wait for 20 days.\u2019Due to the Miasma Qi, Perfected Jiu Jiu\u2019s immortal senses could not expand too far.The good thing was that they were in the outer region of the North Continent. The beasts there were not that skillful. Moreover, few human cultivators or demons would remain in these outer regions. Instead, most of them would travel deeper.After pondering for a moment, Jiu Jiu turned to look at Yuwen Ling, who was standing on a gray cloud behind her. She wanted to ask him to follow Youqin Xuanya and Yuan Qing so that she could relieve some stress. However, just before she said it out loud, Jiu Jiu blinked.\u2018Aunt-Master Jiu, this person has come for unknown reasons and is slightly suspicious. Don\u2019t trust him easily.\u2019She recalled the voice transmission that Li Changshou had sent to her when she had been chasing him away. Jiu Jiu did not take Li Changshou\u2019s word for it. After all, the hunk looked like he would collapse with a single blow from her.However, for some reason, Jiu Jiu really hesitated.\u2018Forget it. The five of them have not wandered outside my immortal awareness for now. I don\u2019t need to panic.\u2019She steered the gray cloud forward, and then turned around to say, \u201cHunk, follow me closely.\u201d\u201cRest assured, Exalted Immortal,\u201d replied Yuwen Ling, cupping his hands. He maintained a three-foot distance between them as he followed behind Jiu Jiu.The group chose three different paths. Naturally, the further they walked, the further apart they became.After pondering about it for a while, Jiu Jiu decided to follow behind Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er temporarily. As for Yuan Qing and Youqin Xuanya, she was slightly more relieved.As for Li Changshou, Jiu Jiu was worried, but she could not just let the pairs wander off on their own while she protected the man who went solo. This would make it too obvious that she was being biased.Jiu Jiu was prepared to follow behind all three groups in turn. At the very most, she would ensure that she spent equal time following and protecting each of them!The Priming Meet rules were that the immortals only had to send the disciples to the destination and allow them to train inside. There was no need for them to bother about anything else.As the saying went, \u201cWhether one survived or not would be up to fate.\u201d The disciples would be able to grow much faster in such dangerous circumstances. However, pushing them into such dangerous circumstances came with the risk of losing them or injuring them.According to Jiu Jiu\u2019s immortal senses, Youqin Xuanya and Yuan Qing were advancing very quickly towards the region that they wanted to reach. The pool where the Fire-Loathing Enlightenment Herbs grew was considered one of the safest places within the Chaos Treasure Forest.Those two did not dare to fly. However, they were advancing quite quickly. They were not talking much and were running one in front of the other. From time to time, poisonous beasts would attempt to attack them, but they would deal with them easily.\u2018Indeed, the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2019s disciples are the most reliable.\u2019Jiu Jiu looked further down and could see Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s situation. Both of them were talking as they walked. It looked like they were taking at least a slight interest in each other. Although poisonous insects and beasts often tried to attack them, they dealt with them accordingly. Their skills were quite commendable.\u2018Nothing huge is happening, but why do I feel so oddly unsatisfied?\u2019Jiu Jiu pursed her lips, wanting to observe Li Changshou\u2019s situation. She focused her immortal senses and discovered that he was missing!Had he been torn into pieces by poisonous beasts so quickly?! Or had he been swallowed whole?!Jiu Jiu frowned and quickly intensified the search using her immortal senses.That was not right. He was using a technique to shield himself from her immortal senses. She could still sense the brat\u2019s aura in the north, and he was also moving at top speed. He was moving at least double the speed of Youqin Xuanya and Yuan Qing!\u2018Brat, you\u2019re a Soul Formation cultivator in the Ninth Stage, yet you are flying towards the deeper regions of the Chaos Treasure Forest? Are you rushing to die?!\u2019Jiu Jiu tilted her chin upward and groaned wordlessly, causing her already-torn top to shake violently.She glanced at Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er, who were currently studying a poisonous flower. Then, she pointed forward with her left hand and sped up to chase Li Changshou.She would catch this fellow and throw him to Wang Ji to be taken care of!A moment later, Jiu Jiu finally caught up with Li Changshou and traveled the same way he was advancing. However, when she looked down to study him, she frowned even more deeply.That brat seemed to be using a Track-Concealing Talisman to hide his aura. That would allow him to avoid detection from ferocious beasts far away.What\u2019s more, Li Changshou was not risking flying. Instead, he was using his brilliant Dragon Swimming Across Clouds footwork and causing afterimages to form underneath his feet. This cultivator in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation was at peak performance.\u2018That\u2019s not right. The herb tripod hanging from this fella\u2019s waist\u2026\u2019Jiu Jiu scrunched up her nose after smelling a strange odor. She looked down to study it for a while, and then immediately looked shocked.\u2018It\u2019s the Saliva of the Red Yang Poisonous Dragon?!\u2019Red Yang Poisonous Dragons lived in the North Sea. They loved eating demons, poisonous beasts, and ordinary living beings. However, they were too violent and conducted massacres everywhere. As a result, the already lacking luck of the dragon race had run out. Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragon race had purged them.\u2018The Saliva of Red Yang Poisonous Dragons is not considered a rare treasure, but it\u2019s still quite expensive. Where did this brat, Li Changshou, get it?\u2019With this hanging on his belt, ordinary poisonous beasts and insects would not dare to go near him. It was no wonder that he was advancing so fearlessly.Jiu Jiu\u2019s eyebrows twitched as she mumbled, \u201cThis fella was quite well-prepared. It looks like he was really determined to find that herb. What herb is he looking for?\u201dYuwen Ling\u2019s rough voice sounded behind her. \u201cImmortal Elder, why don\u2019t you ask him?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. He would become a good-for-nothing even after ascending to immortality if he knew that he\u2019s training under the protection of an immortal.\u201d Jiu Jiu stretched her body, then turned to face Yuwen Ling, who was standing behind her. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go and see how the royalty from your house is doing. Don\u2019t say that this Aunt-Master is biased behind my back.\u201dYuwen Ling immediately nodded in response, looking very eager. He played the role of a loyal guard perfectly.However, when Jiu Jiu turned to fly away, Yuwen Ling retrieved a black beetle from his thigh and threw it into the gray cloud underneath him.This move was very subtle, and it was only done when Jiu Jiu turned her immortal awareness to focus on the other four disciples. Even though Jiu Jiu\u2019s cultivation level was far higher than Yuwen Ling\u2019s, she did not notice that subtle movement.After the two of them flew away, the beetle continued to fly with the gray cloud, following Li Changshou closely.\u2026\u201cEh?\u201dLi Changshou looked up into the sky. While he was speeding along, he noticed something out of the ordinary. It was almost like there were a pair of eyes in the sky, keeping watch on him.However, on closer inspection, he could not find anything strange.\u2018Aunt-Master? Perhaps not. The gaze feels malicious.\u2019Li Changshou lived according to the principle of being safe rather than sorry. He stopped and conjured a seal with both his hands. He muttered several words under his breath, and thin waves began to appear in the gray ground in front of him.As he advanced forward, his body quickly got sucked into the ground. At once, he disappeared.Li Changshou used one of the escape techniques of the Five Elements, Earth Escape.A moment later, Li Changshou\u2019s figure appeared among the bushes 25 kilometers ahead. Around him, there were countless poisonous insects and a few poisonous beasts running in all directions.The feeling of being watched had indeed disappeared.Li Changshou quickly found his bearings, lowered his head, and continued sprinting forward. At the same time, he retrieved two talismans from inside his sleeve, sticking one on each thigh. This helped him to speed up a fraction more.Soul Movement Thousand-Mile Talisman\u2014it was considered quite an average talisman, which could increase the speed of the user\u2019s movement. It was normally only used by cultivators in the beginning phases of the Qi Refinement Realm.Li Changshou had already guessed that since there were five of them on this journey, they would most likely meet extraordinary circumstances.The Chaos Treasure Forest was extremely dangerous, but they were on the extreme outer regions of the North Continent. Cultivators in the Void Return Realm would easily be able to deal with the dangers as long as they were cautious. That meant the Chaos Treasure Forest\u2019s dangers were not particularly applicable.However, the external factors, namely Yuwen Ling, whom they had met halfway, Yuan Qing, who looked warm and kind all the time, as well as Youqin Xuanya, who looked cold on the outside, but was devoid of shrewdness on the inside, complicated the whole situation. Most importantly, Her Highness Youqin Xuanya was a royal princess from the secular world.Li Changshou had his personal theory and firmly believed that there was some kind of story to be unraveled in there.The person that had been planning all of these behind the scenes must have thought that there were no holes in his plan. However, the guard of royalty in the secular world had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, instead of going to the immortal sect directly to explain the situation and resolve the situation by stopping Youqin Xuanya from going out. This was not logical!\u2018Forget it. This has nothing to do with me.\u2019As Li Changshou ran, he retrieved his simple map and studied it again. There was a hint of frustration in his eyes.If he had a choice, Li Changshou would choose not to come to such a dangerous place. This went completely against his life principle, to stay on the mountain until he died of old age.However, he had to do it for his Master.\u201cKeep purity a priority and remain unaffected by everything else. Then, it would be easy to avoid all types of evil!\u201dLi Changshou said to himself, perking himself up. Then, he continued to speed through the black forest filled with poisonous obstacles.A moment later, he felt like he was being watched once again.He frowned and cursed in his heart how troublesome this was. This time, Li Changshou did not expose more of his escape techniques. Instead, he checked the fighting equipment in his storage Dharma treasures. His spiritual awareness also began searching for a place to hide.Although he was cautious, Li Changshou was not a coward. There was a difference between both of these things.A long period followed. Li Changshou continued to have this feeling of being watched, but he did not find anyone hiding, nor did anyone try to assassinate him.He remained on high alert for two whole days and nights, displaying his Earth Escape technique several more times. The feeling of being watched did not go away.Li Changshou tried to analyze his current position. Of course, he was already deep inside the Chaos Treasure Forest. He must have already traveled outside of the limits of Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu\u2019s immortal awareness.He did not stop moving, but he did not feel exhausted. The tough training that he had been through for several years prior was proving to have outstanding effects.All of a sudden, Li Changshou sensed murderous intent!Li Changshou\u2019s spiritual awareness did not detect any threat. It was obvious that the other party had the means to avoid his spiritual awareness.He scanned the source of the murderous intent\u2014on his left, in the darkness of the forest. Li Changshou continued to advance, but the tips of his left fingers were already moving subtly, creating thin ropes, which resembled spiderwebs, and spreading them out. His right hand began summoning a gentle breeze, undetected.It was the best way of investigating\u2014the Spiderweb of Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spiders.Shortly after, a blurry image appeared in Li Changshou\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA figure rushed forward, dressed in a gray, hemp garment, and wearing a conical bamboo hat on his head. He was traveling so fast that his figure seemed to twist and turn. Around him, a light-gray layer of light appeared.The web of Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spiders could only detect this aura.According to Li Changshou\u2019s observation, this person was quite strong. There was a long sword hanging from his waist, which was probably a top-notch, killer weapon. A violent aura engulfed the man. Li Changshou guessed that he was used to licking the blood off the tip of his sword.He sucked in a deep breath and adjusted his aura. Then his speed began to increase.A moment later, the attacker sped up as well. What\u2019s more, he adjusted the angle at which he was advancing. Li Changshou confirmed that he was the target for sure.The other party was probably in the Sixth or Seventh Stage of Void Return. However, he could have been hiding his true cultivation level. On second thought, Li Changshou predicted that the man was approximately in the Sixth Stage of Dao Requital.This was because the person was using a movement technique to catch up to Li Changshou, instead of flying, which was much more efficient. There was a low chance that the person was an immortal.Li Changshou frowned. He had indeed been sucked into a strange situation.How should he deal with this?Li Changshou\u2019s first reaction was to use his escape techniques, but he quickly realized that he had been under surveillance for the past two days. This meant that his follower had ways to track him down.If he escaped this time, and the other party remained relentless in attacking him, Li Changshou would be in even greater danger.2.5 kilometers in front of Li Changshou was a huge plain, filled with poisonous herbs, and devoid of trees.Li Changshou groaned softly in his heart. His right hand grabbed onto two small paper dolls, as the aura in his body gathered in that palm.\u201cThe five elements take turns; there is huge value in metamorphosis. In muddiness, there are no obstacles. The Earth remains the center!\u201dCreases and folds appeared in the gray-white ground in front of him. Once again, Li Changshou employed Earth Escape. However, before his body made it underground, his right hand turned into a burst of light.The man chasing Li Changshou frowned. He tutted and felt the fast-traveling aura underground. Once again, he jumped away and sped up, chasing after him as fast as he could.A moment later, Li Changshou appeared among poisonous herbs. He shook the poisonous dirt off his body, frightening off a few poisonous insects at the same time. Then, he raised his hand and changed a few of his Miasma-Repelling Talismans. Immediately after, he had to resume sprinting once again.At that moment, he heard the hiss of a sword beside him!A cold light beam proved to be 30% quicker than the hissing. It was headed right for Li Changshou\u2019s neck!Li Changshou turned around at once, but he had no time to react at all. The thin and long Dharma sword hit him in the neck, causing his head to fly backward!There was a wisp of smoke, gently twisting around. The cultivator, who had on the conical bamboo hat and was dressed in gray, appeared behind Li Changshou. The veil in front of his bamboo hat floated upwards, revealing a cold smile on his lips.\u201cHe is indeed in the Soul Formation Realm. Without any effort at all\u2014 You!\u201dHe stopped mid-sentence, looking down suddenly at his own legs.\u2018Li Changshou\u2019, who had just been beheaded, was now holding onto this man\u2019s ankles!The assassin reacted swiftly. At once, he jumped backward. Then, his vision became blurry. It was almost as if all of the energy had been sucked out of his body\u2014his Dharmic powers and aura became extremely idle. It felt impossible to activate them!At that moment, the assassin looked closely at the corpse\u2019s belt, which was still hanging onto his ankles. There was an opened pot\u2026He had fallen for his trick!The man tried his hardest to bite his tongue so that he could sober up. Yet, he could not even muster up enough energy to bite his tongue. His vision was becoming blurry!It was a self-created incapacitating agent, the Soft Immortal Disperser.At that moment, a beam of light flew on top of the assassin\u2019s head and hovered there. It was a strange-looking paper umbrella, embedded with spirit stones of various colors.The paper umbrella turned slowly. The spirit stones embedded in it flew out in all directions. An isolation array formation measuring 150 feet in diameter suddenly appeared, with the umbrella as its base. The area that it covered was isolated entirely from the rest of the world!It was a self-made Dharma treasure, the Heaven-Changing Treasure Umbrella.Li Changshou slowly emerged from the ground with his right hand raised. The three paper dolls expanded in the wind. Two crushing sounds were heard, as they took on Li Changshou\u2019s form and charged forward.That was a Dao Sect technique, the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts.The paper dolls had not even reached the assassin when Li Changshou held out a short, bronze crossbow in his left hand. Without any hesitation, he pulled the trigger of the crossbow and caused a wooden arrow to shoot out, aiming straight for the area between the assassin\u2019s eyebrows!The bamboo hat flew upwards, revealing a skinny, sinister face.The arrow pierced through the assassin\u2019s forehead, causing the light in his eyes to slowly dissipate.\u201cYou\u2014\u201dThe assassin let out one last furious roar, but it sounded powerless. His mouth remained open until the three paper dolls reached him.Paper Doll One produced three long nails, which pierced the assassin in his three dantian points\u2014top, middle, and bottom. This locked his three immortal souls and fixed his seven mortal forms!Paper Doll Two used both of its hands to conjure a seal. It also opened its mouth, producing pure-white flames, which engulfed the assassin\u2019s body. These flames instantly ignited the assassin\u2019s flesh. Like a snowman, it turned into liquid and dissipated.That fellow did not even have the energy to cry out in pain.Paper Doll Three kept muttering words under its breath. It was using a curse that would subdue souls and extinguish demons. Waves appeared in front of the doll, causing the shadow, which appeared in the white flames, to disappear!At that moment, the assassin\u2019s soul was completely destroyed. All that was left was a handful of remains that were still being consumed by the white flames.Li Changshou still could not relax. He tossed out a pearl as big as his thumb. The pearl spun around, absorbing light-green wisps of light. Not a single bit of the assassin\u2019s soul remained.Li Changshou carried his bronze crossbow and walked forward. Carefully, he picked up the pearl. The white flames had already been extinguished. Only black ashes, half of a sword, and a small ring, remained on the ground.The three paper dolls sat on the ground cross-legged. At once, they started to chant sutras.The first paper doll recited the Dao Sect\u2019s Salvation Sutra, the second recited the Western School\u2019s legendary Rebirth Curse, and the third recited the Dao Sect\u2019s Blessing-Destruction Curse.Li Changshou picked up the jade and stone ring and held it in the palm of his hand. He felt no urge to break the restrictions on the ring. Instead, he used his Dharmic powers to form layers around the ring, before tossing it into the storage Dharma artifact marked \u2018Heaven Number Four\u2019.After that, he looked at his pearl, a look of understanding appearing on his face. He made a detour around the three paper dolls and then employed Earth Escape again.When the three paper dolls finished chanting their respective sutras, little waves began to appear in the ground. Li Changshou\u2019s arms danced around, causing the ashes left behind by the assassin to be scattered by the wind.The three paper dolls sprung up into the sky as well, and then turned into three palm-sized paper cutouts, before flying back into Li Changshou\u2019s sleeves.The umbrella retracted itself, and the spirit stones flew back where they belonged. At the same time, the huge array disappeared.Li Changshou picked up the sword and pointed it, causing a gust of sword aura to fly out. It pierced through the poisonous fog above and directly hit a black beetle, reducing it to dust.The entire movement was smooth. It was almost as if Li Changshou had practiced this countless times before.He turned around and surveyed the surroundings, which had already reverted to its original state. Then, he turned to the beheaded paper doll and lightly touched it. The paper doll caught fire, leaving behind no traces of what happened.Li Changshou took one step forward and got sucked into the ground. Just like that, he disappeared.\u2018Ai, to refine a paper doll took a lot of effort as well\u2026\u2019However, it was worth it, given that he had obtained that fellow\u2019s \u2018family background\u2019 in exchange.Li Changshou searched the remnant souls in the pearl and found many memories inside. Through those memories, he learned the assassin\u2019s motive and the plan behind this entire journey.The assassin that had tried to kill him was nicknamed Assassin Turtledove. He was in the Second Stage of Dao Requital. He was a cultivator, hired by someone with spirit stones, to go there and do his dirty work.The person had tried to kill Li Changshou in order to obtain the communications talisman from him. He had wanted to use that communications talisman to lure the tiger away from its cave\u2014he had wanted to lure Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu there.Once Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu appeared, Assassin Turtledove would attack Liu Yan\u2019er and Wang Ji. He would then use them as bait to lure Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu and trap her in an array formation. After that, they could focus on their real target\u2014the Sixth Princess of whatever country, Youqin Xuanya!However, Assassin Turtledove did not want to kill Youqin Xuanya. This entire plan was meant to achieve a more despicable objective.According to the pieces of Assassin Turtledove\u2019s memory, Li Changshou guessed that the mastermind behind this entire plan was either the Junior Brother from his sect, Yuan Qing, or a certain powerful person behind Yuan Qing.The corners of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched. In his heart, he cursed, \u2018Indeed, one cannot only judge others based on their looks. Warm, kind men are mostly fake.\u2019Yet, this had nothing to do with Li Changshou.The other party was spending so much effort just to lure Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu into an array formation and trap her. It was obvious that this person did not dare to fight Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu head-on. That meant that Li Changshou did not need to worry about the safety of a certain Perfected Immortal.After a gentle breeze, the poisonous Miasma was back. Peace was restored to the forest. The poisonous herbs swayed gently in the wind. Apart from a bunch of poisonous herbs burnt to a crisp, nothing else was left behind.Nobody would have thought that just a second ago, a fatal battle had taken place there.A moment later, all that would be heard there would be the gentle breeze, sounding like an endless, melodic groan.\u201cI killed you in just ten minutes, and I even scattered your ashes!\u201d\u2026On the Coast of the East Ocean, on a certain beach, hundreds of disciples were fighting the endless wave of prawn demons emerging from the sea.In one corner of the war zone, a few young cultivators in the Qi Refinement Realm hid behind some reefs. They kept muttering curses to activate their Dharma artifacts, attempting to help the Senior Brothers and Sisters fighting in front of them. However, their eyes could not leave a certain figure fighting a short distance away from them.Lan Ling\u2019e held a porcelain bottle in her hands, gently pouring out some powder. She breathed some spiritual energy onto the piles of powder, scattering them outwards onto tens of oncoming prawn demons at once.The prawn demons were not that intelligent, to begin with. Once the dust hit them, their legs turned to jelly. Then, they lay on the ground with froth coming out their mouths, and their eyes darting around rapidly.Lan Ling\u2019e then took out her short sword and floated forward. One by one, she finished them off. Lan Ling\u2019e was extremely accurate as she pierced the demon soul of each prawn demon powerfully with a single move.Soon, she turned around and floated back to her original position, waiting for the next wave of demons to come. The entire time, Lan Ling\u2019e remained oblivious that she had become the center of many other disciples\u2019 attention.\u2018The poisonous powder that Senior Brother refined for me is so useful. I wonder if Senior Brother is safe. The North Continent is so dangerous. It is said that even a single insect could kill an immortal. Ai, stinking Senior Brother always asks others to play it safe, while he takes risks. He didn\u2019t even bring his intelligent and brave Junior Sister along!\u2019The more Lan Ling\u2019e thought about it, the angrier she became. Suddenly, a cold shadow appeared in front of her.\u201cJunior Sister Ling\u2019e, be careful!\u201d\u201cQuickly, dodge!\u201dAll of a sudden, she heard several anxious shouts by her ear. Lan Ling\u2019e looked up instinctively and saw seven or eight prawn demons right in front of her. More than ten claws were waving in front of her face, ready to strike!There were also various pits in the ground. The prawn demons were emerging from underground!At that intense moment, Lan Ling\u2019e softly cried out. She retrieved another porcelain bottle from inside her sleeves and threw it out. Her Senior Brother\u2019s hoarse voice sounded in her mind, \u201cIf you find yourself in an emergency, or if you\u2019re surrounded by enemies, throw this bottle.\u201dBang!The porcelain bottle exploded among the prawn demons, and greens moke emerged from the bottle, engulfing the prawn demons at once.In the next moment, all of the prawn demons were hovering in mid-air.The sea breeze blew. Despite the tough exterior shells on the prawn demons\u2019 bodies, they disappeared in mid-air and turned into multicolored bubbles, which slowly floated away with the wind.Lan Ling\u2019e heaved a long sigh of relief. Yet, all of a sudden, she realized that the atmosphere around her had grown strange.She turned around and saw that a few Senior Brothers and Sisters, who had been rushing over to rescue her, had halted a distance away. All of them had weird expressions on their faces.Lan Ling\u2019e blinked slowly, confused.Clank\u2014A sword belonging to a male disciple in the Soul Formation Realm landed beside her. He quickly bent down to pick it up.\u201cJunior Sister Ling\u2019e, go ahead, go ahead.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just passing by\u2026 passing by\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAssassin Turtledove\u2019s aura is gone. That Immortal Du Sect disciple in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation has disappeared as well. This is very strange.\u201dDeep in the dense forest, in a mysterious valley, several black figures were hidden in the shrubbery. They seemed to be discussing something via voice transmission.One of them scolded, \u201cThere\u2019s an 80% chance that he took the money, killed the person, and then ran away! Hmph! People like that cannot be trusted. We have to nurture our own subordinates. They will be more reliable!\u201d\u201cIs the Dragon-Trapping Array ready?\u201d\u201cIt has been set up. We can trap the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Perfected Immortal.\u201d\u201cVery good. Although there have been unexpected changes in the situation, it should not be too big of a problem,\u201d the man in charge said in a low voice. \u201cSend a message to Fourth Young Master later. Arrange for a wave of people to attack him on purpose. That will lure the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Perfected Immortal over.\u201d\u201cWe will personally capture those two disciples and bring them to the trapping array. Then, we will trap the Perfected Immortal. This matter concerns the restoration of our country, and the Sixth Princess is our best bet. We have to control her. At the same time, Fourth Young Master will get what he desires.\u201dThe black figures chuckled. The man in charge clenched his fist, and then everyone left one by one, very quickly.Half a day later, a few men in black clothes suddenly attacked Yuan Qing and Youqin Xuanya. Yuan Qing immediately crushed his communication talisman.Jiu Jiu, who was sitting cross-legged above Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er, immediately jumped. She turned around and charged towards the south-east. Yuwen Ling gave all that he could in order to keep up with Jiu Jiu.The moment Jiu Jiu flew away, more than ten types of aurae appeared below. There were two cultivators in the Dao Requital Realm among them, who knocked Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er unconscious and took them away at once.An hour later, Jiu Jiu flew back quickly, leaving Yuwen Ling hovering over Yuan Qing and Youqin Xuanya to keep watch.At that moment, Jiu Jiu smelled something out of the ordinary. However, she was traveling too fast. By the time she found Liu Yan\u2019er and Wang Ji, she already found herself deep in a certain array. There were white clouds all around her, and even as far as her immortal awareness could reach, she could only see a patch of white.She took Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er in her arms and then flew around the trapping array. Jiu Jiu was no expert in array formations, to begin with, and soon, she found herself right where she started.\u2018At least, I left the hunky general to watch over Yuan Qing and Xuanya.\u2019Jiu Jiu heaved a sigh of relief. She wanted to quieten her heart down to look for a way to break out of the array formation. However, once again, she recalled the warning Li Changshou had given her before entering the Chaos Treasure Forest.\u201cAunt-Master Jiu, this person has come for unknown reasons and is slightly suspicious. Don\u2019t trust him easily.\u201d\u2018Could this Yuwen Ling be\u2014\u2019At that moment, beads of cold sweat appeared on Jiu Jiu\u2019s forehead.It was all linked in a chain\u2014it looked like she had fallen into their trap right from the beginning!\u2018What has happened to Li Changshou? His cultivation level is low. Could he have been killed? There\u2019s an 80% chance that these people are after Xuanya and Yuan Qing. I should have realized this sooner!\u2019Jiu Jiu could not help but shout curses. \u201cYou lousy baddies! If you have what it takes, come and fight 300 rounds with me! How can you still call yourselves cultivators after using these wretched tricks?!\u201dYet, there were nothing but poisonous insects and a few similarly-lost poisonous beasts in the array. There was no response.\u201cAiya!\u201dJiu Jiu tossed the two unconscious people onto the ground, and then paced back and forth. The threads in her already tattered short-sleeve top tightened. It threatened to snap at any time under the immense pressure.\u201cThese array formations and whatnot frustrate me to death!\u201d\u2026\u2018Immortal-Emancipating Herb, this is really hard to find.\u201dOn the twelfth day in the North Continent, Li Changshou emerged from the Chaos Treasure Forest. Then, he headed 800 kilometers towards the north-west. Finally, he arrived at the marked-out region on his map \u2018on time\u2019.This region measured about 150 kilometers in radius. The terrain was extremely complicated as there were hills, swamps, mountain ranges, and the like. As Li Changshou traveled deeper into the North Continent, the poisonous beasts and insects became even more ferocious.Li Changshou remained extremely cautious throughout. Very carefully, he searched for the \u2018poisonous herb\u2019 that he wanted. After searching for six days consecutively, he found all sorts of poisonous herbs and spirit herbs. Yet, he found no trace of the one he had taken the risk of coming to the North Continent for in the first place.At noon, it started raining, and each raindrop falling from the sky was extremely poisonous.Li Changshou did not dare to stay out and wander around. Thus, he found a precipice and dug a hole in it, hiding inside. He released his spiritual awareness to inspect his surroundings. Li Changshou was going to wait for the rain to stop before he continued his search for the herb.In these six days, he had searched almost every area in the region. Unfortunately, he had found no trace of the Immortal-Emancipating Herb.\u2018Immortal-Emancipating Herb, Immortal-Emancipating Herb, why are you playing hide-and-seek with me? Why not come out and meet me?\u2019Li Changshou yawned and sat cross-legged in his cave. Then, he began to adjust his body back to his peak state.He had learned from an ancient text that this region was where the Immortal-Emancipating Herb grew.Coming here would be the lowest price he had to pay for finding this herb. If he did not succeed, Li Changshou decided that he would go back to the town on his way back to try his luck.So what if he had to spend the spirit stones and treasures that he had spent years cheating\u2026 ahem, working and saving up? It would all be worth it if he could obtain an Immortal-Emancipating Herb.Well, if even that didn\u2019t work, Li Changshou would have no other way. He could only start planning again when he returned to the mountain.The rain started all of a sudden, and it showed no signs of stopping any time soon.It was rare for Li Changshou to get some rest. He slowly relaxed his mind. Although he had the Saliva of Red Yang Poisonous Dragon, and he could prevent poisonous beasts and insects from coming close, he was in a dangerous place after all. It was difficult for him to tell himself to relax.\u2018Aunt-Master Jiu should be fine, right?\u2019Li Changshou thought about the cultivator he killed nine days ago. He took out the Soul-Conserving Pearl, intending to look at the snapshots of memories within. However, the remnant soul inside it was gone.\u2018Forget it. This has nothing to do with me, anyway.\u2019That fellow had a well-thought-out plan. He also had the insider-help of the warm Yuan Qing. Given Aunt-Master Jiu\u2019s intelligence, she probably would easily walk into the trapping array.Aunt-Master Jiu had a high cultivation level and an adorable personality, but sometimes she was too rash. Once the alcohol went to her head, she would not be careful.Youqin Xuanya was more pitiful. She had cultivated for so long within the immortal sect, yet she still could not avoid the political fights in the world. Her childhood friend, who had always been by her side, was also harboring unfathomable motives.Li Changshou never saw himself as a hero, and he would never try to save the princess. He had no intention of changing his own fate. In his eyes, Youqin Xuanya was only well-packaged trouble. He would avoid this karma and being implicated as much as possible.Boom! Boom!The sounds of thunder reverberated in the sky.Li Changshou began to inspect his various resources. He had enough pills and talismans, and the Saliva of Red Yang Poisonous Dragon could last him nine more days. That would be enough for him to leave this area after he completed his search. If he could move faster after the rain and complete his search of this area sooner, he would be able to head north or west to continue searching.\u2018Immortal-Emancipating Herb, Immortal-Emancipating Herb, I am getting very irritated.\u2019Boom!The precipice suddenly shook.The way it shook startled Li Changshou. Thus, he quickly used his spiritual senses to survey the surroundings and detected a strange occurrence in the clouds above him. The clouds had formed a whirlpool, and lightning was flashing within. It looked like something was trying to \u2018squeeze\u2019 out.Li Changshou squeezed his fingers together to analyze the situation, and found that huge changes were occurring in Heaven and Earth!Li Changshou produced a cover with his Dharmic powers and burst out of the cave. He quickly landed on the ground, prepared to employ the Dragon Swimming Across Clouds footwork.Yet, the moment he landed, Li Changshou heard another a booming sound from above. A fiery-red figure charged out of the whirlpool. At the speed of lightning, the figure dropped onto the ground.The figure landed just thirty feet in front of Li Changshou and was covered in mud.Li Changshou quickly retreated, the three paper dolls already in his palm!However, when Li Changshou saw the figure wrapped in a layer of light-red light, he frowned.\u2018This\u2026\u2019Was Heaven upset that his search for herbs was going too smoothly? Was that why Heaven was making things more difficult for him?Or had he offended some kind of demon, which controlled his fate so that he could not avoid this disaster?The figure dressed in the fiery-red skirt and lying in front of him was no outsider\u2014it was Youqin Xuanya!Youqin Xuanya was seriously injured. There was an open wound on her left shoulder, so deep that Li Changshou could see her bone. Fresh blood mixed with the poisonous rain and flowed down her jade-like arm. Her right hand clutched her big sword tightly\u2014she seemed to have lost her sword sheath. Her sword was covered in scratches that resembled spider webs.There were at least ten wounds on her body, and yet she was not in critical danger.Just as Li Changshou recognized her, Youqin Xuanya saw a figure in front of her in the rain. She bowed her head and spat out a mouthful of blood. Her eyes were filled with determination as she used her sword to get onto her feet. It was then that she realized the figure in front of her looked familiar.Li Changshou frowned. Just then, he used his spiritual senses to survey the surroundings. No attackers were pursuing her.He recalled what happened earlier. It seemed like Youqin Xuanya had activated some kind of treasure to escape\u2014she must have used a cosmic technique to get there.The most frustrating thing was she appeared there, out of all places.Li Changshou had come face to face with his fellow sect member, yet he did not try to rescue her. If Youqin Xuanya survived and returned to complain to the sect\u2019s elders about him, he would be in deep trouble. Yet, Li Changshou did not want to be implicated in this conflict. This matter had nothing to do with him in the first place.Although he would be in deep trouble if Youqin Xuanya told on him, the most he would suffer would be a deduction in monthly allowance.Li Changshou mumbled to himself and turned around calmly, \u201cAh, the rain is so heavy. My vision is impaired. I can\u2019t see anything.\u201d He faced the cliff wall behind him and lifted up his hands, ready to employ the Earth Escape.If he stayed there any longer, he would be a fool!\u2018Quickly!\u2019\u201cSenior\u2026 Senior Brother Changshou?\u201dYouqin Xuanya looked at Li Changshou\u2019s back through the rain, astonished. She bowed her head and coughed out another mouthful of blood. Then, she said anxiously, \u201cQuickly, run, don\u2019t care about me! Your cultivation level is too low. There are\u2026 many of them\u2014\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, Youqin Xuanya\u2019s eyelids weighed down. Her aura was in a complete mess, and her wounds were grievous. She and her sword fell back into the mud at the same time.A flash of lightning appeared In the dark clouds, and the rain became even heavier.\u2018Forget it. On account of your good conscience, I will use Earth Escape to help you halfway. After that, I really cannot help you. I can only let Heaven decide your fate.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cough, cough!\u201dIt was just a few coughs, but Youqin Xuanya felt pain all over her body. This caused Youqin Xuanya to jolt awake from her sleep.\u2018Where am I?\u2019Youqin Xuanya sat up cautiously. A hint of red glow appeared in her black eyes, causing the dark cave to become as well-lit as if it were exposed to broad daylight. Everything became clear to her.It was natural for cultivators like her, who were in the Fourth Stage of Void Return, to be able to see in the dark. There was no need for her to learn special techniques to do so.The first thing she saw was the huge, round boulder at the mouth of the cave. The boulder had probably been dug out from the ground\u2014it looked one with the rest of the cave. The little gap that it left allowed a bit of light through.It must have been night time as the light rays looked extremely dim.Youqin Xuanya released her spiritual awareness and found that there were several poisonous beasts within kilometers of her. However, apart from her, there were no other humans.\u2018Have I been saved?\u2019Several images surfaced in her heart. Many thieves had surrounded her. Youqin Xuanya had been captured after a bitter fight, but while the enemies had been preparing poison, she had found a chance to slip away. That was when she retrieved the Life-Saving Talisman from her Master and escaped 500 kilometers away.Youqin Xuanya could not choose her destination. It was an extremely risky move, but she had landed in a place where it had been pouring. In the heavy rain, she had seen a Senior Brother whom she had met only recently.\u2018Did he save me?\u2019Not far away from her hand, Youqin Xuanya saw two stacks of talismans and a couple of porcelain bottles. She was shocked.Then, Youqin Xuanya looked down at her body. Her normally pale, fair face suddenly flushed red. Gently, she bit her delicate, thin lip.What a pity. An extreme beauty like her was looking uncharacteristically shy and bashful. Yet, there was no one around to appreciate the view.Li Changshou had already left a long time ago.Youqin Xuanya became so shy because the wounds all around her body had already been treated and bandaged.The bandages were the Blood-Stopping Qi-Gathering Bands distributed to the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s disciples. These were made out of linen infused with various types of herbs and medicines.Speaking truthfully, the bandaging was done quite perfectly. The insides of the Blood-Stopping Qi-Gathering Bands were even smeared with spirit ointment used for treating poisoned wounds. Currently, most of her wounds had mostly recovered. It was just that the pain had not yet subsided.However, the wounds in her shoulder and below her left rib were particularly deep. What\u2019s more, the bandage went across her chest. This meant that the person had to remove the top part of her dress by sliding it off her shoulders.Youqin Xuanya suddenly lifted up her right hand to slap herself across the cheek. With a strong voice, she said, \u201cSenior Brother Changshou saved my life. He also dressed my wounds so patiently. How can I doubt my Senior Brother\u2019s character?\u201dCalm and peace were quickly recovered in her gaze. She surveyed herself internally and found that her aura had stabilized. Overall, the wounds in her body were recovering well.It was obvious that someone had adjusted her aura.Youqin Xuanya tilted her head to look at the place where she was lying down earlier. There was a neat stack of sheepskin, which had been placed under her head as a pillow. There was also some blood on it, which looked like a line of words.She picked it up to study it closely, and found a line of words, as well a simple map.\u2018We are from the same sect. It is not a big deal to help one another out. This place is 1,000 kilometers from the Chaos Treasure Forest. Below is a map. You can make a detour to leave this place.\u2018Make survival your priority. There are Miasma-Repelling Talismans, Track-Concealing Talismans, Detoxifying Pills, and Essence-Nurturing Pills beside you.\u2018Junior Sister, I\u2019ll give you a word of advice: There is no knowing what is in a man\u2019s heart. Do not trust others so easily. The road ahead is dangerous. I hope you will take good care of yourself.\u2018\u2014Written by a man who does not want to leave his name.\u2019Youqin Xuanya blinked as she reread the last line. There was a deeper meaning hidden within.Suddenly, the words flashed lighter and darker. A few seconds later, they disappeared completely. The good thing was that the map below had not been enchanted in the same way as the words were. The drawings and scale of the map were quite detailed. He had even marked out Youqin Xuanya\u2019s current location.It was worth mentioning that the path marked out on the map was completely opposite from the path that Li Changshou had taken.\u2018Senior Brother Changshou is a considerate and kind man.\u2019Youqin Xuanya frowned subtly, rolled up the sheepskin, and put it away. A serious expression appeared on her face as she muttered, \u201cThere is no use thanking you in words for this big favor. If Xuanya survives this, I will give my all to repay Senior Brother.\u201dOnce she finished speaking, she gave a Dao salute to the sheepskin and kept the map.She lowered her head and saw that a Miasma-Repelling Talisman and Track-Concealing Talisman were stuck on her shoulder. At that moment, both of them were still effective. There was no need to change them yet.After packing the pills and talismans, Youqin Xuanya began to adjust her aura, so that she was once again at her peak state.Her huge sword was lying in the corner. The spirit glow around it was recovering as well.Slowly, two figures appeared in her heart. The one on the left was her so-called childhood friend, Yuan Qing. He had joined the sect at the same time as she did and would appear whenever she needed help.Long ago, Youqin Xuanya had realized that the person who had grown up and joined the sect with her was not as simple as he appeared. That was why she had purposely been maintaining a distance all this time.However, she had not expected to find an evil, incorrigible man underneath the kind, warm disguise he had been putting on every single day!\u2018What happened over these few days? There is no knowing one man\u2019s heart. Senior Brother Changshou\u2019s words were true indeed.\u2019At that thought, Youqin Xuanya laughed mirthlessly. All of a sudden, the world seemed like such a cold place. She was infuriated, but also extremely lost.Yet, among the two people who appeared in her heart, the one on the right looked quite blurry and faint at first. However, he became clearer as time went by. It was just the side view of someone turning around and a back view that she had a deeper impression of.Before this Priming Meet, Xuanya had never met Senior Brother Changshou. When she had found out that a cultivator in the Ninth Stage of Soul Formation was going to the North Continent to look for herbs, she had felt shocked.The thing that had left the deepest impression on Youqin Xuanya was that this Senior Brother had a disease that would make him convulse every time he came into contact with women.\u2018Wait! Senior Brother Changshou has an illness like that, and yet he endured the pain of the convulsions and the frothing to treat more than ten of my wounds!\u2019This was a display of utter selflessness and righteousness!In her mind, Youqin Xuanya filled in the gaps in her memory with her imagination: In the dark, narrow cave, a certain Senior Brother was trembling and panting. His limbs were deformed, and his expression was twisted with pain, and yet his eyes remained resolute. He extended a helping hand to her\u2026Slap!Youqin Xuanya slapped herself once again.\u2018Senior Brother endured the pain to treat me! How dare I doubt his character earlier?! Youqin Xuanya, when did you become so despicable?\u2019Youqin Xuanya bit her lip and gave another Dao salute to the sheepskin map.\u201cIf I have the opportunity to repay Senior Brother Changshou in the future, I must not be stingy, and I must not hesitate.\u201dAs she made this promise out loud, Youqin Xuanya\u2019s gaze became more resolute. She packed her items and raised her hand to grip the handle of her sword.Youqin Xuanya went into a half-kneeling position, as her bloodied dress spread out around her. With her left hand, she held up the tip of her sword and made it stand erect in front of her. Her aura began to surge and tremble at once!\u2018Survive!\u2019Youqin Xuanya would expose Yuan Qing and repay Senior Brother Changshou, the kind, and righteous man. She would send a message to His Majesty, her father, and make him beware of these wretched traitors!Youqin Xuanya\u2019s right hand, which maintained a tight grip around the handle of the sword, began to flash fiery-red.\u201cNine Spirit-Gathering Essence, Thousand Mind-Strengthening Lotus!\u201d she shouted in a low voice, and her huge sword emitted beams of fiery-red light. Clear patterns appeared overhead, and the scratches on the sword disappeared one by one.Youqin Xuanya\u2019s long hair danced around as fiery-red lotuses appeared around her, lighting up her delicate skin and starry eyes.\u201cImmortals are in the north, and men are in the south. The Heavens swallow clouds of fire, and the glory of the four seas are extraordinary! Fire Lin Sword Case! Open!\u201dThere were three resounding \u2018clanks\u2019, resonating with all the swords within five kilometers!The boulder at the mouth of the cave exploded, and a fiery-red figure shot out of the cave. Tens of flying swords revolved around her!After flying hundreds of feet, Youqin Xuanya got rid of the fiery-red glow around her body and quickly disappeared into the dense, dark forest. She turned to face the south-west first, and then sped up toward the north-east direction!\u2018According to my instincts, I should be heading in the south-west direction. As long as I follow the directions Senior Brother Changshou left for me, I should be able to avoid those evil thieves. I must! Survive!\u201d\u2026Presently, 300 kilometers north of the cave where Youqin Xuanya was hidden, Li Changshou was climbing up a cliff, carefully inspecting the Miasma-Qi-filled cracks.After working for half a day, Li Changshou could only shake his head and leave. This meant that he had not gained anything from this area, which the ancient texts described as a place with Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.Li Changshou found a plain and sat down cross-legged. He pulled out a dagger and began to draw a map on the ground of the areas where he had searched. Then, he fell into deep thought.He would head north and continue searching for three more days.He had expended so much effort, and yet he could not find the Immortal-Emancipating Herb. Naturally, he felt indignant. After all, he had spent so much time preparing for this searching trip to the North Continent beforehand.\u201cKeep trying!\u201d He slapped his knee and stood up, heading towards the north. In the night, he only left shadows behind him.Perhaps due to the heavy rain the day before, gaps had appeared in the Miasma Qi in this region. Coincidentally, the moonlight shone through the gaps and lit up the path in front of Li Changshou.The cultural hipster in Li Changshou acted up. He found a good spot, where he could remain hidden, and basked in the moonlight, appreciating the moon.\u2018Ah, the moon is so long\u2026\u2018Heh, the shape is so white\u2026\u2018Ah, the crescent moon is round and big\u2026\u2019As the poisonous fog traveled towards him, the rare moonlight disappeared.\u2018Older Brother, is this getting old?\u2019Li Changshou raised his eyebrows and shook his head, laughing. Then, he stood up and advanced forward, becoming one with the night.Dao companions and whatnot\u2014having those would be even scarier than having a Junior Sister. It would be a nuclear warhead of unstable karma\u2026He could not afford it and dared not think about it.What\u2019s more, compared to Youqin Xuanya, an extremely beautiful cultivator in his generation who had a complicated background, Li Changshou felt that he would feel much safer being with a strong female immortal like Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs Li Changshou covered a larger area, the amount of Saliva of Red Yang Poisonous Dragon he had kept reducing.His search had not borne fruit in the area the ancient texts talked about or around the Chaos Treasure Forest.Three days after he incidentally rescued Youqin Xuanya, Li Changshou still had not found the Immortal-Emancipating Herb. However, as he had been venturing deeper into the North Continent, he had found many other useful, poisonous, and spirit herbs.He had even caught two precious Corpse-Burning Bugs, which could be refined into Corpse Calcining Powder. This would give Li Changshou a total of twelve ways of dealing with corpses.Even though he was beginning to feel frustrated, Li Changshou never forgot that he was in a dangerous place like the North Continent. This meant that he remained extremely cautious the entire time.Logically, while Immortal-Emancipating Herbs were extremely valuable, they were considered quite unconventional herbs. Few people should have been seeking them.The regions that Li Changshou had been searching had the right conditions for Immortal-Emancipating Herbs to thrive. Yet, there was not a single seedling in sight\u2014it was all very strange.Li Changshou tried his best to make time between his training in order to read all the classical texts on poisons and herbs. Was all that he read fake?\u2018Indeed, Master, the old man, is very unlucky.\u2019Li Changshou could only comfort himself in this manner. He wanted to get rid of the indignance in his heart as he began to think about when he should head back.He had to walk 100 kilometers more towards the west!If he still could not find the herb, Li Changshou would give it a rest. He would go to the town and see if there were any herbs on sale. Of course, there was only a slim chance of that happening.Li Changshou moved his feet quickly, casting shadows underneath his feet. He wanted to complete the last segment of his quest.After searching for 25 kilometers, he found nothing.Li Changshou searched a total of 50 kilometers, through all the areas in which Immortal-Emancipating Herbs could possibly grow. Still, he found no trace of them. Surprisingly, he found several precious spirit herbs, which he could use to create Soft Immortal Dispersers.\u2018Look, herbs that would be useful to me are lining up to get into my storage Dharma artifacts. Yet, no matter how hard I try, I cannot find herbs that would be useful to Master. This is probably because of the differences in our character and manners. Since I cannot obtain Immortal-Emancipating Herbs, I will not be able to create the Immortal-Melting Pill. This method will not work then. It\u2019s a good thing that I had already prepared Plan Two and Plan Three. Although these plans will not be as safe as creating Immortal-Melting Pills, they will at least be of help to Master.\u2019Buzz\u2014There was a movement in the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy. People were fighting somewhere.Li Changshou\u2019s spiritual awareness immediately reached out to look for the source of this movement. However, the Miasma Qi in front of him was too rich. With the poisonous Qi moving around, he could only search a maximum radius of ten kilometers.The fight was happening more than 15 kilometers away. He could vaguely sense several figures moving and twisting around.Was the area where this \u2018itinerant cultivator\u2019 activity was taking place, just ahead?There were many cultivators in the North Continent. Normally, they would head 500 kilometers deep into the North Continent in order to look for valuable and mysterious flowers and fruits. They would then trade these flowers and fruits for other resources that would help their own cultivation and training.Assassin Turtledove, who Li Changshou had killed earlier, was one example. He had already been in the Dao Requital Realm. On days when he had not been doing others\u2019 dirty work, he would collect these flowers and fruits, and trade them for other resources.Li Changshou immediately thought of retreating. Thus, he stopped moving and hid behind a rock, pondering his next moves very carefully.Li Changshou had read all the ancient texts about this region. Cultivators were fighting on the path that he was supposed to take. If he did not retreat now, when should he?As the saying went, \u201cGentlemen should not remain in dangerous places.\u201d This journey to the North Continent could only end in regret.All of a sudden, Li Changshou jumped!By chance, his spiritual senses detected three ordinary-looking, emerald green herbs swaying in the breeze on the cliff\u2019s peak, 11.5 kilometers north-west of where he was.They were shaped like Orchid Grass, but they were much shorter. There were also strange patterns on their leaves. Each herb seemed to be wrapped in a dull glow.Immortal-Emancipating Herbs!They were Immortal-Emancipating Herbs, which could poison Essence Immortals and seriously injure the essence souls of Perfected Immortals!What\u2019s more, from the density of the patterns, Li Changshou could tell that the herb in the center was about 3,000 years old. The other two herbs on either side of it were also more than 1,000 years old!Li Changshou nearly jumped out from behind the rock.However, he immediately recited a Heart-Cleansing Curse silently to calm himself down. He had not gotten the herb yet and thus could not afford to celebrate too early.\u2018Calm down. I can only have a small celebration after I obtain the herb and leave the North Continent. That\u2019s not right. Refining the pill would be extremely troublesome as well. At the very least, it would not be too late to rejoice after I get back to the mountain and successfully create the Immortal-Melting Pill. Let\u2019s begin!\u2019Li Changshou employed Earth Escape and headed straight for the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs. At the same time, his spiritual awareness spread outwards underground, allowing him to survey the area around the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.Beside the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs was a bald, old cypress tree. He could transition from Earth Escape to Wood Escape in order to get close to the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.However, to poisonous beasts, poisonous herbs, which were thousands of years old, would be considered extremely nourishing. There was no way that the herbs would remain unguarded.Indeed, Li Changshou quickly discovered a Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent nearby.This snake was treacherously hiding lower down the cliff. It even knew how to hide its own aura. Its thirty-feet-long body camouflaged with the rocks around it, but its blue-green scales glowed mystically.If Li Changshou had not scanned the area, inch by inch, he would not have realized that there was a poisonous beast hiding nearby.There was a huge bulge in the center of the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent\u2019s head. It looked extremely ugly and could easily invoke bold ideas in the minds of humans.Its triangular-shaped head was already beginning to elongate. Its body was also thicker than ordinary serpents. Clearly, this snake was on its path to immortality.The oldest Immortal-Emancipating Herb was probably the key to its ascension to immortality. However, at that moment, it was just not poisonous or powerful enough.\u2018This will not be easy.\u2019Li Changshou also noticed that there were many bones below the cliff. Among them were many human-shaped bones.Li Changshou could not fight using brute force, so he had to use his intelligence.Poisonous beasts like that, which were close to immortality, were considered extremely poisonous, demonic beasts. Although Li Changshou carried poisons with nine types of effects, which could threaten even ordinary Essence Immortals, they would prove useless on a beast like that.Based on his own Dharma spells, Li Changshou could fight the beast using brute force. However, the surroundings were too dangerous, with instabilities all around.\u2018How should I outsmart the serpent? Should I use Wood Escape to get there, pluck the herb, and run? Most serpents are extremely nimble. This plan might not work.\u2019Li Changshou pondered deeply as he traveled back and forth in the earth swiftly. Soon, his mind ran through ten different plans.As Li Changshou got closer to the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs he yearned for, the battle taking place in the distance also became clearer to his spiritual awareness. When he turned his attention to the battle, his breath caught in his throat, causing him to cough several times underground. He nearly turned around and left right there and then.\u2018Why have I bumped into her? Is this Youqin Xuanya charmed? She should change her name to Toxic Xuanya. I already drew a map to direct her to the south. What is she doing here? She\u2019s a full 1,000 kilometers away from where she is supposed to be!\u2019The corners of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched several times. He felt like there was a strange lapse in his knowledge.\u2018Why is there a suppressive force belonging to immortals among the people chasing her?\u2019A spark appeared in Li Changshou\u2019s mind. As his spiritual awareness focused on the battle, a brilliant plan to obtain the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs surfaced.On further thought, if not for the battle occurring on this path, he would not have noticed the three Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.What\u2019s more, according to his current line of sight, there was a high chance they would not detect him.From this angle, perhaps he should thank \u2018Toxic Xuanya\u2019.\u201cI saved you the last time, and I\u2019m going to make use of you this time. I\u2019ll take it that we\u2019re even,\u201d mumbled Li Changshou under his breath. He paused before employing Earth Escape once again.Li Changshou activated his Dharmic powers and used all his strength to control his aura. He silently traveled towards the cliff as fast as he could. Then, he began to observe the people attacking Youqin Xuanya.At that moment, flaming swords were revolving around Youqin Xuanya. She was floating in mid-air and moving towards the cliff as well. The swords were revolving around her at top speed, forming a dense shield.However, with a single look, Li Changshou could tell that Youqin Xuanya was only strong in appearance but weak in reality. She had not mastered the sword defense Dharma spell yet. Youqin Xuanya knew a fixed style of using it, but she did not know how to react according to her circumstances. While she was defending herself, Youqin Xuanya could not deal effective counter-attacks.Six people, all dressed in black, were attacking Youqin Xuanya just then. Two of them were in the Dao Requital Realm, and four were in the Void Return Realm. Although they were using all their efforts to attack Youqin Xuanya, they were not critically injuring her. Apparently, they wanted to keep her alive.Li Changshou\u2019s luck was not bad either. There were two other Essence Immortals from this group who were in the Dragon-Trapping Array at that moment. A certain Perfected Immortal in the same array was also powerful enough to keep both Essence Immortals busy.\u2018These few fellas would probably not be able to defeat the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent.\u2019Fortunately, there were two more types of aura in the air, belonging to two people who had not acted yet. What\u2019s more, Li Changshou was quite familiar with them.It was Yuwen Ling, the front guard from whatever country Youqin Xuanya was from, along with Yuan Qing, a Junior Brother from his sect, who came from the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Within a 15 kilometer radius, Li Changshou could only sense one immortal\u2014Yuwen Ling. He guessed that the suppressive force, which he sensed earlier, belonged to him as well.Li Changshou\u2019s mind began to race.\u2018Speaking of which\u2026 why isn\u2019t the big, warm man, Yuan Qing, dealing any blows yet? Is he going to drag this on? Does he really think that there are no other powerful people in the Immortal Du Sect?\u2019The Immortal Du Sect was a medial-class immortal cultivation sect, but it was also widely recognized as one of the Three Schools. Even though several immortals had royal status, the Immortal Du Sect would not hold these earthly royalties in high esteem.If Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu and the five disciples did not return to the sect at the designated time, immortals would be sent to the North Continent to search for them. Yuan Qing and his group were courting death by continuing to take their time.\u2018There are no two ways about it. Isn\u2019t this fake, warm guy coveting after the fake ice mountain\u2019s body? Pui, despicable!\u2019At that moment, in Li Changshou\u2019s eyes, Yuwen Ling, the immortal seated in the clouds, and the people that were attacking Youqin Xuanya could be labeled as Tool Number One, Two, Three, Four, and so on.Li Changshou focused his spiritual senses on Youqin Xuanya and employed the Wind Speech Incantation to speak directly into Youqin Xuanya\u2019s ear.\u201cTake the position that you are facing now as north. Retreat eight feet towards the south-west.\u201dYouqin Xuanya, who was using her sword defense to withstand the attacks of the Dharma treasures in front, jumped.\u2018Senior Brother Changshou! Why is he here?\u2019Although she felt slightly suspicious, Youqin Xuanya subconsciously followed Li Changshou\u2019s directions. She used the support of the flying swords and remained close to the ground as she moved backward. Two beams of light immediately scratched the side of her sword array formation!They were a short knife and a spike. They flew towards Youqin Xuanya at top speed, but landed on the ground!\u201cMove back some more, six feet towards the west.\u201d Li Changshou\u2019s voice sounded slightly urgent.Youqin Xuanya trusted him and followed his directions. Two more beams of light brushed her sides.Then, Li Changshou\u2019s hoarse voice sounded in her ear once again. \u201cDon\u2019t daydream. Use any additional energy you have to counter-attack. Control your expression. Don\u2019t let them become suspicious.\u201cThere is a poisonous beast at the bottom of the cliff. Lure them over and make use of the poisonous beast to defeat them. Move three feet to the west, then move five feet south-west.\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s dark gaze brightened up once again.She pursed her lips and said, \u201cYes\u201d in her heart in response.Youqin Xuanya dodged left and right swiftly. Very slowly, she covered her poise and calm. In the eyes of her six attackers and the two observers above, Youqin Xuanya suddenly became much more nimble.A breakthrough in battle?Youqin Xuanya managed to dodge most of the six opponents\u2019 attacks. She had only been using her flying swords as a shield earlier, but now she seemed to have realized how to deal counter-attacks as well.Just like that, Youqin Xuanya became much less stressed. Calmly and methodically, she retreated towards the cliff\u2019s bottom, where the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent was hidden.At the same time, Li Changshou arrived among the rock strata at the top of the cliff. He was 1,000 feet from the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent seemed to have realized something was amiss as well. At the bottom of its cliff, it lifted its head to survey its surroundings.There was a plain in front of the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs. The strong-looking, black cypress tree was about 160 feet from the edge of the cliff, and the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs were located under its shade.Li Changshou found the roots of the black-skinned cypress tree. While among the rock strata, he stopped using Earth Escape. Then, he fought against the surrounding pressure, gritted his teeth, and employed Wood Escape instead. He drilled into the roots of the cypress tree, hid his aura, and penetrated upwards.The old cypress tree: \u201c\u2026\u201dOh?Ooo\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Retreat six inches towards the west. The poisonous beast is beginning to move towards its left.\u201dLi Changshou remained in the warm and comfortable tree trunk of the old cypress tree as he kept sending voice transmissions to Youqin Xuanya.Youqin Xuanya was now about 3,000 feet from the old cypress tree.This cliff was a protruding, horizontal structure. At that moment, the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent was slithering out from the narrow slit in a rock, where it had been hiding. It kept close to the stone wall below the cliff and stuck its head out beside the old cypress tree trunk.It was already alerted by Youqin Xuanya and her six attackers. However, Yuwen Ling, who was still in the sky, still had not noticed it.This saved Li Changshou the hassle of coming up with more plans and schemes.Li Changshou was already working at full capacity. Firstly, he had to actively keep his aura hidden. Secondly, he had to keep guiding Youqin Xuanya. Thirdly, he had to keep an eye on the poisonous beast\u2019s movements\u2014he could not allow Toxic Xuanya to be harmed.The flour had not even been milled\u2014he could not possibly give the donkey up to be barbequed1.\u2018She\u2019s coming.\u2019Youqin Xuanya was only 1,000 feet from the old cypress tree now!The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent was captivated by the few people who were engaged in battle. It stuck close to the rock wall and slowly slithered forward, blocking their path to the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs, but not wander too far away.It was an experienced hunter, well-versed in the art of ambush. It remained patient as it waited for Youqin Xuanya and her attackers to come closer. At that moment, these people were as good as a meal on a plate for the serpent.Li Changshou could already imagine how horrific and exciting it would be once this three-feet-long serpent jumped out without warning.This world was just that terrifying.After this\u2026As he chanted the Wood Escape mantra, Li Changshou wandered freely up and down the trunk of the old cypress tree. Slowly, he dove into one of its stolons.Li Changshou kept sending voice transmissions to Youqin Xuanya.\u201cAdvance three feet to the east. Retreat nine feet, south-west. The poisonous beast already has its eyes on you. Listen to my directions closely. When I say jump, use all of your energy to burst up into the sky. Do not hesitate.\u201dYouqin Xuanya muttered a sound of acknowledgment in her heart. She kept waving her hands around, directing the flaming, flying swords around her to shuttle back and forth.Her rapidly developing sword defense and her dress fluttering in the wind made her look like an immortal dancing in flames. She looked exceptionally charming and captivating.In the air, Yuwen Ling held onto Yuan Qing\u2019s shoulder, helping to shield him from the surrounding Miasma Qi.Yuan Qing kept his eyes on Youqin Xuanya underneath him. There was obvious infatuation in his eyes.\u201cGeneral Yuwen! Do not let Xuanya escape this time!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Fourth Young Master. We neglected that she had a Precious Shifting Talisman the previous time,\u201d answered Yuwen Ling in a low voice. \u201cShe does not have many Dharmic powers. Once she gets to the edge of the cliff, I will step out to pressure her further. Fourth Young Master, you can then appear by her side and protect her. If she only has hatred for you, Fourth Young Master, the Love Parasite will only be half as effective. We have to turn that hatred into positive feelings towards you.\u201dYuan Qing\u2019s expression twisted as he nodded and said, \u201cThank you for your hard work, General Yuwen.\u201dYuwen Ling replied in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m confused about how you did it as well, Fourth Young Master. Even after 60 years, you did not manage to move the Sixth Princess. If we fail today, or if the Love Parasite does not work, we will have to kill the Sixth Princess on the spot. Fourth Young Master, please be prepared.\u201dYuan Qing clenched his fists, his eyes filling with fury. However, he said nothing in response.Underneath him, Youqin Xuanya was already nearing the edge of the cliff. She approached the shade of the huge, old cypress tree.Li Changshou was already in the roots of that tree. All of a sudden, his eyes lit up. The words \u2018jump\u2019 traveled into Youqin Xuanya\u2019s ears through Li Changshou\u2019s voice transmission!There was an explosion of light as the flying swords rushed under Youqin Xuanya\u2019s feet, carrying her body up into the air. The beams of light that were directed at her hit the ground one by one!The six people, who had been attacking Youqin Xuanya, had no idea about the dangers in front of them. Thus, they charged straight into the shade of the old cypress tree!They did not even think about stopping. All they thought about was charging forward and jumping up to continue their attack. Little did they know that within the tree hid the line between life and death!Hu\u2014There was the sound of something cutting through the air. The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent, which had been waiting at the edge of the cliff, jumped out without any warning!\u201cRetreat!\u201d Yuwen Ling shouted from mid-air, but the poisonous beast had already clamped its teeth down on the masked man on the far left!The serpent\u2019s sharp teeth cut through the flesh as it flung its head violently. The top half of the man\u2019s body was torn off at once.From inside the roots of the old cypress tree, Li Changshou considered what his own fate would have been if he had fought the poisonous beast alone. It would not have been easy for him to win.The remaining five people tried to retreat at once, but how would the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent allow these delicacies to escape?Several shadows shot out of the serpent\u2019s tail, causing one of the men to fall down on the ground, thus blocking the others\u2019 escape route. The scales on its body opened up, emitting rich, poisonous fog, which engulfed the group of men.\u201cHow dare you, wretched beast?!\u201dThere was a furious howl in the sky. A tall and sturdy figure cut through the clouds and cast his broad axe to the side as he charged towards the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent.The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent, which had a fleshy horn on the top of its head, immediately felt threatened. Thus, it raised its head to knock away the broad axe.The evil-looking bulge on the top of its head was the hardest part of its body!The sound of metal hitting metal echoed throughout the surroundings. The broad axe had been deflected, while the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent\u2019s head thrashed around on the ground. A huge gash had appeared in the bulge, and golden blood was gushing out of the wound.The poisonous beast cried out in rage, and its tail leaped up all of a sudden.Yuwen Ling had finally landed from the sky. He raised his hand to summon his broad axe back. Once again, he was ready to strike with it!Inside the root of the tree, Li Changshou held three paper dolls in his right hand. He hesitated for a couple of seconds, before pulling out a fourth one. He paused again and then pulled out a fifth and a sixth!In his left hand, he held his strongest incapacitating agent\u2014his supreme-grade Soft Immortal Disperser.Li Changshou waited for the right time to use his Soft Immortal Disperser. He wanted to be sure that the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent was dying before he stepped out.The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent would not be affected by poison, but Yuwen Ling would.At the same time, Li Changshou did not neglect to expand his spiritual awareness and keep an eye on the area within a five-kilometer radius. He was looking for any hidden dangers.On the other side, Youqin Xuanya had already acted according to Li Changshou\u2019s instructions. She had retreated all the way to the back of the cliff, just like Li Changshou had told her.Without Yuwen Ling protecting him, Yuan Qing did not dare to remain among the clouds. Finally, he had to make his move. He charged towards Youqin Xuanya from the sky, his three-feet-long green sword at the ready. He wanted to stop Youqin Xuanya from leaving.However, Youqin Xuanya had no intention to leave. She directed all of her flying swords towards Yuan Qing, suppressing him at once.Even though Yuan Qing\u2019s cultivation level was slightly higher than Youqin Xuanya\u2019s, it was extremely difficult for him to defend himself against her attacks.Yet, Youqin Xuanya was very distracted. She was keeping an eye on the battle taking place near the edge of the cliff with her spiritual awareness.She could sense that Li Changshou, who had been sending her voice transmissions the entire time, was there. However, at that moment, she did not know his exact position. As a result, she became increasingly anxious.Little did she know that the entire situation was in the palm of Li Changshou\u2019s hands.The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent took Yuwen Ling, an early-stage Essence Immortal, as its biggest threat. It had no intention of retreating and continued to guard the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs faithfully.Yuwen Ling held onto his broad axe and attacked the serpent relentlessly. He was protecting his three subordinates, who had been knocked out cold by the serpent\u2019s poison.Under these circumstances, Yuwen Ling could not show mercy\u2014both sides had to fight till death!Li Changshou waited patiently and silently inside the root of the old cypress tree. He was waiting for the opportune time to act. As he waited, he prepared his escape route.The entire situation had happened suddenly. He was reacting as the situation developed. Thus, he decided to slightly lower his expectations of himself.As long as he was 80% to 90% confident this time, he would act. It was not realistic to always pursue full confidence.A while into the battle, a few slightly-bald branches of the old cypress tree were cut into half. Yuwen Ling\u2019s broad axe also made several deep gorges in the cliff, causing part of it to collapse.The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent was not yet immortal as well. Even though it was fighting an early-stage Essence Immortal, who did not have any particularly amazing Dharma treasures, it soon could not hang on any longer. Poisonous blood was flowing out from multiple wounds around its body. Li Changshou guessed that it would be slaughtered at any moment.\u2018Thank you for your hard work, Lunkhead.\u2019Li Changshou thanked the serpent in his heart. Then, his left hand shook slightly, pouring the colorless supreme-grade Soft Immortal Disperser out from its bottle, and wrapping it with his Dharma powers. He carried the Soft Immortal Disperser to the trunk of the tree and then allowed it to seep out towards Yuwen Ling.Very quickly, Yuwen Ling\u2019s movements slowed down, and his vision became blurry.\u2018This wretched serpent\u2019s poison is so powerful!\u2019 Yuwen Ling cursed in his heart. His eyes widened and became bloodshot as he tried to fight the drowsiness overcoming him. His head felt extremely heavy, and his legs felt extremely light. He let out a furious, guttural cry.Yuwen Ling did not dream of fighting continuously anymore. At once, he decided to deal a final, powerful blow. His body flew up into the sky as he released immortal powers to keep the serpent still. His broad axe headed straight for the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent\u2019s neck!The Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent immediately thought of retreating. It started to turn away, but as it did, it looked reluctantly at the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs at the edge of the cliff.It was this moment of hesitation that took away its chance to escape.The broad axe, steadied by two muscular arms, landed squarely on its neck. The serpent\u2019s head flew up into the sky as its poisonous blood splattered around the ground.Yuwen Ling landed on the ground. However, his legs could no longer hold his weight. He stumbled backward and only managed to remain standing with the support of his broad axe.He pulled out a Detoxifying Pill and slipped it into his mouth, but his movements were already extremely slow.\u2018What kind of poison is this? Why is it so powerful?!\u2019\u201cGeneral\u2026 We\u2026\u201dThere was a weak voice coming from behind him. As Yuwen Ling tried to turn around, his legs turned to jelly, causing him to almost fall over.The Detoxifying Pill was not effective at all. The sky was spinning before his eyes.Just then, he heard something cutting through the sky!A wooden arrow appeared in his peripheral vision and pierced Yuwen Ling\u2019s neck. The hunk\u2019s body swayed as he turned around and looked in the direction of the old cypress tree furiously.There, \u2018Li Changshou\u201ds body emerged from the tree. He threw out his Heaven-Changing Treasure Umbrella and lifted up his bronze crossbow. At the same time, he scattered three paper dolls.Pew, pew, pew!The paper dolls turned into clones of Li Changshou and charged towards Yuwen Ling!\u2018Li Changshou\u2019 circled around and arrived back at Yuwen Ling\u2019s side. Rapidly, he pulled out another wooden arrow for his bronze crossbow and readied himself to pull the trigger.The crossbow glowed with a strange light. The speed at which it shot the arrow was extraordinary.Yuwen Ling was so heavily poisoned that he could not put up a fight. Once again, the arrow pierced into his neck. His immortal blood rushed out and dyed the ground.The three paper dolls rushed towards Yuwen Ling and stood on three different sides of him, dispersing more green fog from inside their individual porcelain bottles.The green fog seemed to have a life of its own as it wrapped around Yuwen Ling. The sturdy man\u2019s body emitted buzzing sounds. With the last bit of strength in his body, he raised his head and howled\u2014it was a howl of pure pain!Unfortunately, the Heaven-Changing Treasure Umbrella had already set up the array. The area was isolated from the outside world, and so the howl was not heard by anyone.Yuwen Ling\u2019s immortal body was rotting in the green fog. His white bones were already showing at several parts of his body, and transparent bubbles were appearing in his skin at others.He tried hard to deal counter-attacks. His broad axe moved lazily and slowly, allowing the three paper dolls to nimbly dodge his swings.Whoop!The third arrow pierced Yuwen Ling in his rotting chest, right through the heart!The three paper dolls began to conjure hand seals, spewing white flames from their mouths, which consumed Yuwen Ling!It was only then that Yuwen Ling recognized Li Changshou. Listlessly, he shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 you\u2026\u201dThis Essence Immortal had just ascended to immortality a while ago. However, at that moment, he was on the brink of death.Immortals were immortals after all\u2014how could they be happy about their lives ending?While in the white flames, Yuwen Ling suddenly closed his eyes. Immortal light began to shoot out of his terrifying-looking body, and faint images appeared at the top of his head!His essence soul left his body!Yuwen Ling\u2019s essence soul shouted, \u201cDie!\u201d It withstood the effects of the Soft Immortal Disperser and dealt Li Changshou a blow!This blow carried with it the force of Mount Tai, and it felt like there was a flood crashing through the mountains!Li Changshou immediately tried to dodge, but a hand had a death-like grip on his ankle. He looked down and saw that it was one of the masked men that had been heavily poisoned by the poisonous beast\u2014he was suddenly moving!The man was writhing around. Li Changshou did not know how he was withstanding the poison in his body, but while his three immortal souls and seven mortal forms were being destroyed, the man used everything in him to destroy Li Changshou\u2019s last chance of survival.\u2018Pui, a miscalculation.\u2019Li Changshou shook his head slightly, as Yuwen Ling\u2019s attack finally reached him. The impact caused the upper half of his body to be blown to pieces.Yuwen Ling\u2019s essence soul laughed mirthlessly.\u2018This boy\u2019s Dharma powers are quite good, but he still has not ascended to immortality\u2026\u2019Whoosh\u2026Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh\u2026Once again, the sounds of something cutting through the air could be heard from underneath the cypress tree. Seven spikes shot out, piercing various points on Yuwen Ling\u2019s essence soul at the same time!Each spike carried complicated restrictions and white flames of the underworld!Yuwen Ling\u2019s essence soul looked down in shock. The three paper dolls around him did not stop spewing flames. Before his essence soul jumped out of his body, his physical body had already been reduced to bones.At that moment, the masked man, whose own soul was burning, looked up to find the lower half of a paper doll dancing in the wind as it combusted into flames.That man had destroyed his last hope of reincarnation in order to bring half of a paper doll down with him.Under the old cypress tree, \u2018Li Changshou\u2019 suddenly appeared. He opened his left palm and faced Yuwen Ling\u2019s essence soul. Then, he lightly clenched his fist. The seven Soul-Extinguishing Spikes, which he expended a lot of effort refining, suddenly exploded!Li Changshou used his spiritual senses to focus on the rack of immortal bones that could not seem to be completely burnt from inside the roots of the cypress tree. While frowning slightly, he made Paper Doll Five throw out a Soul-Conserving Pearl. Then, he increased the intensity of the flames that Paper Dolls One, Two, and Three were spewing.The Cold Flames of the Underworld were not powerful enough on immortals. Li Changshou had to think of another way to obtain the True Samadhi Flames from the sect.He waited for a while longer before the rack of bones finally collapsed and reduced to a pile of ash on the ground. The three paper dolls read their respective sutras. It was only then that Li Changshou finally moved.Li Changshou would only be at peace if he did the ceremonial step of scattering the ashes himself!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only had an axe, a storage Dharma treasure\u2026\u2019As Li Changshou had expected, cultivators living in the mortal world were idlers in the cultivation \u2018industry\u2019.As the black ashes rained down, Li Changshou stored the ring-shaped storage Dharma treasure and the axe into his storage bag that was marked Heaven Number Four. Then, he put away the Soul-Bewitching Pearl, jumped to the edge of the cliff, and squatted down in front of the Immortal-Emancipating Herb.Li Changshou took out the two jade containers that he had prepared beforehand. He placed two detoxifying pills below his tongue and encased his hands in eighteen layers of Dharma powers. Then, he dug out two of the older poisonous herbs with their roots intact very swiftly and carefully and sealed them in the jade containers.Not causing the extinction of medicinal herbs while harvesting them would prevent the loss of one\u2019s good fortune.\u2018Finally\u2026\u2019 Li Changshou displayed a faint smile.He stood up quickly and did not dare to stay there for long. He was worried that Yuwen Ling had other companions.He rushed to the head of the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent, took out a storage bag labeled Earth Number Two, and stored the serpent\u2019s head in it. He sealed the storage bag with a talisman and stored it into a storage Dharma artifact labeled Black Number Four.Li Changshou should be able to extract a powerful poison from this that his junior sister could use to protect herself. The serpent\u2019s body was too big and sturdy to be dissected. He could only give up his plan of taking the serpent\u2019s body back with him.The serpent\u2019s venom was still boiling around him. The corpses of the masked men were burned to ashes by the three \u2018Attacking\u2019 paper dolls.As long as it was not an immortal, the Cold Flames of the Underworld could burn almost everything effortlessly. The remaining ashes of those people had mixed with that of their general and were waiting to be blown away by the wind.Afterward, Li Changshou and the four paper dolls moved simultaneously to scatter two medicinal powder bottles all over the place.The human blood on the ground was ignited instantly. A series of green flames appeared, and the bloodstains on the ground vanished in the blink of an eye.Yeah, purifying the Primordial World and protecting North Continent\u2019s environment was every human cultivator\u2019s obligation!Li Changshou collected a few storage Dharma artifacts. His gaze swept across his surroundings, and his spiritual senses scanned for any signs of trouble in the five-kilometer radius around him while he started forming a hand seal.After confirming that he did not omit anything, the silhouettes beside him turned back into paper dolls and scurried into Li Changshou\u2019s sleeve.Li Changshou closed the umbrella, slipped into the rock strata, and left the place.After the array formation had dissipated, a soft breeze swept across the area as the poisonous Miasma Qi in the surroundings filled the void.Only a headless serpent carcass was left on the cypress tree, pools of deadly serpent blood, intersecting cracks on the ground, and a cliff about to collapse.The old cypress tree had a change of \u2018hairstyle\u2019. Its sparse branches swayed in the wind as though it was bidding goodbye to Li Changshou, who was hiding in the ground.\u2026Li Changshou utilized the Earth Escape technique and snuck to the place where his junior martial sister and brother were battling.Toxic Xuanya was fighting against Yuan Qing with the sword that she was controlling. Yuan Qing was struggling to fight back. There were multiple wounds on his body, and his robe was drenched in blood.\u2018This Yuan Qing, did he use medicinal pills to reach the Void Return Realm? This is the capability of the second-highest-ranking disciple amongst all the sect disciples from the same generation? If all the other rascals in the current disciple ranking are similar to him, Ling\u2019e will be able to reach the top 100 in the Immortal Sect Competition that\u2019s a few years from now. If I prepare more medicinal pills and self-made Dharma artifacts for her\u2026\u2019Li Changshou snuck near them. He analyzed the tempo that Youqin Xuanya executed her moves, stretched a hand out of the ground, and threw a porcelain bottle towards Yuan Qing.That empty porcelain bottle previously contained the transcendent-grade Soft Immortal Disperser.Yuan Qing had already damaged two flying swords. He heard the quiet sound of something tearing through the air behind him and waved the sword in his hand behind. His sword blow landed handsomely and precisely on the porcelain bottle and shattered it immediately.\u2018Huh? Where did that porcelain bottle come from?\u2019Yuan Qing blinked his eyes. He did not even have the time to retract his sword. His body staggered, and he was about lunge forward.At that time, four flying swords pierced the air in front of him!Yuan Qing was lunging forward. He seemingly opened his arms and \u2018welcomed\u2019 the flying swords that were coming at him!Youqin Xuanya originally did not plan on killing Yuan Qing. Even though she thought that Yuan Qing was despicable and shameless, he was still an inner sect disciple. She needed to bring him back to the sect for their masters to punish him.However, Yuan Qing had abruptly stopped fighting back\u2026As Li Changshou had predicted, Youqin Xuanya was unfamiliar with this set of sword-kinesis technique, so she was unable to retract her swords in time. Those four flying swords pierced through Yuan Qing\u2019s neck, forehead, chest, and abdomen immediately.Her move was incredibly precise. The flying swords destroyed her three souls and penetrated Yuan Qing\u2019s dantian. She had attacked smoothly and cleanly, meaning there was absolutely no chance for him to survive.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Youqin Xuanya was stunned. She suddenly recalled something and heaved a sigh.She landed on the ground, jumped off her flying sword, and walked towards Yuan Qing\u2019s corpse.Yuan Qing left in peace.Yuan Qing was indeed peaceful when he died. He had not sensed any impending dangers when he had lost consciousness. Moreover, he could not wake up after the swords pierced his body. Therefore, the corners of his mouth were still lifted.Even if there was only a sniff of Soft Immortal Disperser left in the bottle, that was still not something that Yuan Qing could handle.Meanwhile, Youqin Xuanya saw the smile on Yuan Qing\u2019s face.\u201cEven though you might be evil at heart, I suppose you still have a tint of remorse in your heart, do you? Were you also pressurized by someone?\u201dYouqin Xuanya seemed to feel a little pity for him. She shook her head. The flying swords turned around and stuck together, and a blazing fire ignited. The flying swords integrated into one huge sword and hung behind her back.Li Changshou could not resist the urge to give her a thumbs up after hearing her murmurs.\u2018Just like her nickname, Junior Sister is toxic. She has an exceptional ability to make herself chicken soup for the soul!\u2019Speaking of which, she did not even leave after killing her opponent in this unknown place but instead stayed to reminisce and be sentimental about the situation. It was apparent that she had not suffered the cruel beating of life. She had strong nerves indeed.At that moment, Youqin Xuanya lifted her head and looked at the edge of the cliff. There was nothing there. She could not sense that there was a living person there at all. The terrifying demonic serpent was motionless too.\u2018I wonder how Senior Brother Changshou is doing. I\u2019ll bring Yuan Qing\u2019s body over and have a look,\u2019 she thought.Youqin Xuanya walked towards Yuan Qing and was about to wrap his body with a layer of Dharma power when she felt her eyelids turn heavy. Her body slowly collapsed on the ground.Clank!The huge sword crashed on the ground as well.Simultaneously, tiny cracks appeared on the ground below Yuan Qing. The porcelain fragments were silently buried into the ground.The cracks quickly extended to the ground below Youqin Xuanya. A hand stretched out from the crack and casually grabbed her by the hair. The hand tugged harshly without showing any mercy and dragged the unconscious Youqin Xuanya into the ground, which trembled a few times, and the cracks disappeared. The ground returned to its previously flat and sturdy state.The defense abilities of a cultivator\u2019s body exceeded that of a mortal tremendously. That included their scalp and hair follicles. It was impossible to make a cultivator that was at the Void Return Realm bald just by tugging at their hair.Li Changshou merely wanted to get that person away as quickly as possible and immediately leave this troublesome place.As for Yuan Qing\u2019s corpse, Li Changshou was not the one who had killed him. There was no need for him to scatter his ashes. It was enough that he dealt with the porcelain fragments.The Soft Immortal Disperser was only an incapacitating agent that would completely disperse two days after a person was dead. It was almost undetectable.Moreover, Li Changshou would face a tougher problem if the sects\u2019 immortals failed to find Yuan Qing\u2019s corpse when they arrived.Under the ground, Li Changshou dragged the unconscious Youqin Xuanya with him and headed directly in the south-east direction. They moved like two fish in the pond, and they disappeared in no time.\u2026\u201cAh! This stupid array formation is simply way\u2026 too\u2026 irritating!\u201dAccompanied by Jiu Jiu\u2019s angry howl, the ground beneath her feet trembled continuously. The venomous insects and beasts all trembled in fear and horror. Because the big array formation was sealed, the ground beneath Perfected Immortal Jiu remained sturdy and did not collapse.At the corner of the array formation, Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er were sitting together. They seemed to be drained of energy and appeared weary.They had been trapped in that place for a long time, so it was only normal that they were not in their best psychological state. However, this environment also helped to drive their relationship forward. They now called each other Senior Sister Yan\u2019er and Junior Brother Ji Ji.On a side note, there were multiple pronunciations and meanings for the word \u2018Ji\u2019 in Wang Ji\u2019s name. The pronunciation of his name was not Qi\u2014which stood for strange\u2014but instead Ji\u2014which stood for unlucky and illegitimate.The reason why Jiu Jiu was so irascible was mostly because of the actions of this Daoist couple.After venting the anger in her heart, Jiu Jiu hugged her arms, crossed her legs, and levitated three feet above the ground. She continued thinking of a solution.Liu Yan\u2019er walked towards her slowly and said gently, \u201cAunt-Master, do not worry too much. Good people are blessed by heaven. Junior Brother and Junior Sister might be waiting for us in the town.\u201dJiu Jiu snorted and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long that their corpses might have disappeared!\u201d\u201cAunt-Master\u2026\u201dLiu Yan\u2019er continued trying to convince her. \u201cMartial Aunt, didn\u2019t you mention yesterday that there should have been someone from the sect here to help us? Maybe, we might be able to escape in no time.\u201d\u201cAiya!\u201d Jiu Jiu disheveled her medium length hair with both her hands. \u201cWho knows if those three are dead or alive!? If anything has happened to Li Changshou, how am I going to answer to his master? If those two precious immortal seedlings are dead, 100 years of wine money will be gone for me!\u201dA few black parallel vertical lines appeared on Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s forehead. Although Martial Aunt Jiu did not explicitly say that, Liu Yan\u2019er knew that she was still concerned about them. However, she felt that Aunt-Master Jiu was indeed more concerned about her wine money.All of a sudden, a gentle breeze blew within the big array formation. Then a sigh sounded from all directions.Afterward, a nonchalant and old voice resonated in the array formation.\u201cLittle Jiu, do you admit your wrongdoings?\u201dJiu Jiu could not resist a shiver. Her skinny legs landed on the ground, and she replied, \u201cMa\u2026 Master?\u201dLiu Yan\u2019er was also shocked. She asked in surprise, \u201cDid the Exalted Wang Qing come and find us personally?\u201dThe white fog around them dissipated quickly. The immortal and spiritual senses of the three individuals trapped in the array formation were finally released and expanded towards their surroundings without obstructions.At that moment, two silhouettes flew from afar and crashed in front of Jiu Jiu.They were two elders with white hair. They were clad in black and had reached the Essence Immortal Realm. They were currently severely wounded and unconscious. There was a palm mark imprinted on both their bodies.Wang Ji shouted anxiously, \u201cAunt-Master Jiu, it\u2019s them! They are the ones who attacked Senior Sister Yan\u2019er and me!\u201dJiu Jiu knelt down without any hesitation. She touched the ground with her forehead and said dejectedly, \u201cMaster, I have been tricked. I lost contact with three young disciples. I am willing to accept all reprimands and punishment. Master, please find them quickly to check if they are alive!\u201dJust then, the white fog that was surrounding them had dissipated completely. A few silhouettes appeared in the distance.The Daoist priest that was standing at the front was less than five feet tall. When he saw Jiu Jiu kneeling on the floor, he could not help but to feel a little awkward. He lowered his head, coughed, and asked while smiling, \u201cOur Master is not here. It\u2019s me\u2014cough\u2014your handsome and chic\u2026 Fifth Senior Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dThere was killing intent!The short Daoist priest shivered as he tried to salvage the situation. The little junior sister that was standing far away and was clad in a linen robe was jumping on her feet. She darted over immediately!She moved like an arrow shot using a divine bow. There were sonic booms as she moved!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you so aggressive, Little Jiu? I have overcome many hardships to raise you up. Anyway, back to business.\u201dThe Dao name of the short Daoist priest was Jiu Wu. When Jiu Jiu had been accepted as a disciple, the Exalted Wang Qing had started undergoing secluded cultivation regularly. Jiu Wu was indeed the person who had raised her up.Although they were martial siblings, their relationship was similar to that of a dad and his daughter. They were used to fooling around together.Jiu Jiu looked as though she was about to have an outburst. Jiu Wu\u2019s eyes circled, and he changed the topic of the conversation immediately. He pointed at the people behind him and threw a series of questions at her.\u201cTheir masters are all here. Who are the missing ones? Where did they go missing? How long have you been trapped here?\u201dJiu Jiu\u2019s face turned gloomy. She cupped her hands and bowed to those people standing behind. Jiu Jiu was at a loss for words momentarily, so she lowered her head and bit her lips.Liu Yan\u2019er and Wang Ji looked elated. They flew there from the corner and paid their respects hurriedly to their master, uncle-masters, and aunt-masters.Many powerful immortals were standing behind Daoist priest Jiu Wu. There was Jiang Jingshan from the Heaven-Breaking Peak. She was a Perfected Immortal, the master of Youqin Xuanya, and was the disciple of the current sect leader of the Immortal Du Sect.There was also Lin Qi from the Heaven-Breaking Peak. He was a Perfected Immortal and the master of Yuan Qing.The immortals from the Du Lin Peak and Little Ling Peak were from the same generation as Jiu Jiu. They had found their respective beloved disciples, so there was no need for further explanation about their identities.Jiu Jiu\u2019s gaze fell on the white-headed old Daoist priest that was standing at the end of the cluster.He was Qi Yuan from the Little Qiong Peak. He was also Li Changshou\u2019s master.This old Daoist priest looked haggard. Jiu Jiu could not look at him in the eye. She lowered her head and sighed. She knew internally that Li Changshou was a very important disciple to this old Daoist priest. He was hopeful and hesitant about Li Changshou.Jiu Jiu said in a low voice, \u201cSenior Brother Qi Yuan, the last time I saw Changshou, he was heading towards the north. Yuan Qing and Xuanya headed north-west. They were accompanied by a general from the Xuanya clan. His name is Yuwen Ling. If I am not wrong, this is a plan against Xuanya.\u201d\u201cHaiz.\u201d The old Daoist priest Qi Yuan laughed bitterly. He cupped his hands at Jiu Jiu, bowed deeply, and said, \u201cLife and death are all destined. It\u2019s all part of the priming process outside the sect. I have yet to ascend to become an immortal. It is hard for me to do anything in the North Continent. Please\u2026 please help me search for the whereabouts of my disciple. The Little Qiong Peak will be incredibly grateful for that!\u201dJiu Wu replied anxiously, \u201cPeople who are from the same family need not be very polite to each other. Rest assured, Junior Brother Qi Yuan. We will split up to search for the missing disciples. Jiu Jiu and I will head north with you.\u201cNinth Junior Sister, snap out of your daze! Pull yourself together! We\u2019ll talk about the punishment only after we find them!\u201cThese two Essence Immortals were guarding the array formation. When I found them, they were busy mending the array formation. It is apparent that they are two of the culprits that plotted against you lot. Both search parties will grill one of them. Let\u2019s see if we can get anything from them!\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go!\u201dJiang Jingshan and Lin Qi completely agreed to the idea without raising any doubts. It was apparent that they were all extremely anxious.As the short priest Jiu Wu waved his sleeve, the two unconscious Essence Immortals appeared beside him by telekinesis. He threw one of them to Lin Qi.They did not say anything else. At that moment, the most important task at hand was to search and rescue the missing disciples.They agreed to a frequency to transmit letters to one another and designated an area for each group to search. Finally, they decided to split into three groups.Wang Ji\u2019s master would bring Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er to the nearby town to ask around.Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s master would head north-west to search with Jiang Jingshan and Lin Qi.Jiu Wu would head north to search with Qi Yuan and Jiu Jiu.These immortals from the Immortal Du Sect stepped on the journey in search of their disciples hurriedly.At the same time, a pretty girl who did not wish to be named was hiding in a newly formed cave far north. She started a bonfire and held a bamboo book roll in her hand as she waited for the arrival of her powerful aids. She was not at all flustered but was instead a little too comfortable.Youqin Xuanya sat cross-legged inside the cave. She closed her eyes and meditated. Every once in a while, she would open her eyes to look at the silhouette that was at the entrance of the cave.She wanted to start a conversation with him, but she could sense that Li Changshou did not want to talk every single time.After killing Yuan Qing, Youqin Xuanya had lost her consciousness for three days. When she woke up about twelve hours ago, she had found that her wounds were almost healed. The only thing that was hurting was her scalp.\u201cSenior Brother Changshou, are we going to wait here?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Li Changshou replied casually. \u201cI have left Immortal Du Sect\u2019s secret markings in many places within a 150-kilometer radius from here. I have also set up an array formation that conceals our tracks outside the cave. This place should be safe for now. According to what you have described, Yuan Qing has other accomplices. We could land in their hands if we head further south. Counting the number of days that have passed, no matter if Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu managed to escape or not, the immortals that were sent from the sect to help us would have reached the North Continent already.\u201dLi Changshou paused, lifted his head, and looked at Youqin Xuanya. \u201cIf you are still worried, we can also make a detour and walk for around 1,500 kilometers. However, there is still a chance for us to be caught by them.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 am not worried\u2026\u201d Youqin Xuanya replied softly. She lifted her head and looked at Li Changshou. Their lines of sight crossed.Youqin Xuanya used to think that she was an upright person who would not do anything that hurt her conscience. However, for an unknown reason, she could not look at Li Changshou in the eye. She lowered her head and looked away.She felt that her heart was a little empty. It felt as though there was a cat\u2019s paw scratching the walls of her heart.She was a little uneasy and unsure.\u2018The reason should be because Senior Brother has saved me twice,\u2019 she thought.Youqin Xuanya thought that she should find a way to return the favor, even if she was still currently enjoying the protection by Senior Brother Li Changshou.\u201cSenior Brother, is there anything I can do for you?\u201d she asked meekly.Li Changshou answered casually, \u201cYes. Do not release your spiritual senses for no reason.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Youqin Xuanya replied solemnly. She felt a little dejected internally.She seemed to have become a burden to him.Crack!A crackling sound was heard from the bonfire, and the flames became smaller.Li Changshou took out a grey and dry piece of wood from his sleeve and placed it in the bonfire to make the flames bigger.It was only then that Youqin Xuanya noticed there was something peculiar with the flames. Not only was there not a hint of smoke, but the flames also emitted a light fragrance.\u201cSenior Brother, is there anything special about this fire?\u201dLi Changshou looked at the bonfire and replied calmly, \u201cThis is not an expensive piece of wood. It was obtained from the Northern Vitality Winter Pine Trees that were grown in the south of the North Sea. This pinewood is not a spiritual root. It was only a normal tree in ancient times. Its characteristic is its ability to grow in the winter. This kind of pinewood had almost become extinct after Miasma Qi engulfed the North Continent. However, its quantity managed to multiply eventually. From then on, the Northern Vitality Winter Pine Trees had a special characteristic. The trees are not afraid of Miasma Qi, and the aura that they emit would chase away venomous insects and beasts. This small bonfire ensures that there are no poisonous creatures within 3,000 feet from us. From what I\u2019ve heard, there are currently huge forests of Northern Vitality Winter Pine Trees in the Mages\u2019 colonies. This pinewood is not worth many spirit stones, and not many people use it either.\u201dYouqin Xuanya was engrossed in his descriptions. Her eyes reflected Li Changshou\u2019s side profile. She said softly, \u201cSenior Brother, you are really knowledgeable\u2026\u201d\u201cThe books in the sect have records about this,\u201d Li Changshou replied calmly. He lifted the bamboo book in his hand and continued reading it. It appeared that he did not want to continue the conversation.Youqin Xuanya pursed her lips as she was in deep thoughts.After a while\u2026\u201cSenior Brother, have you found the medicinal herb that you were looking for?\u201d\u201cI am pretty lucky to have found it.\u201d Li Changshou smiled. He was in a good mood as he thought about that.Youqin Xuanya did not want the conversation to end just like that. She continued asking, \u201cSenior Brother, you seem to have prepared a lot for this trip.\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Li Changshou replied without even lifting his head. \u201cI have started preparing for this trip to the North Continent from fifteen years ago. I have collated many things day in, day out that could prevent myself from being poisoned.\u201d\u2018Fifteen years?\u2019Youqin Xuanya battered her eyes. \u201cThen\u2026 What happened to Yuwen Ling and those evil robbers?\u201dLi Changshou replied, \u201cThey died when they were fighting the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent that was about to experience Immortal Ascension. We were very lucky to have escaped. The serpent\u2019s venom is very deadly.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Youqin Xuanya sighed. \u201cThose evil robbers would definitely pay for what they did. Yet, I did not expect that karma would strike so early.\u201dLi Changshou went along with the direction of the conversation. \u201cUmm\u2026 Tox\u2014cough\u2014Junior Sister Youqin, I have a favor to ask from you.\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead, Senior Brother!\u201dYouqin Xuanya was immediately energized. Her eyes sparkled as she looked intensely at Li Changshou. \u201cI would even sacrifice my life to repay your kindness when you saved me.\u201d\u201cThe situation\u2019s not that complicated,\u201d Li Changshou smiled and answered, \u201cThis trip has been very bizarre, and we have experienced so many twists and turns in the trip. Our masters and seniors will definitely ask about the details when we return to the sect. I have always been avoiding trouble, and I do not want to attract too much attention. Neither do I want to drag myself into any difficult situations. Therefore, I hope that you can avoid being too detailed about things pertaining to me when you describe the events to your master and seniors. My cultivation level is not very high. The only thing I am confident about is my Earth Escape technique. I think others might laugh at me because of this.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother\u2026\u201d Youqin Xuanya\u2019s expression changed. She felt that a spark of lightning raced across her heart.Li Changshou had helped others without thinking about the rewards and avoided the chance to build a reputation for himself. He was wholeheartedly dedicated to pursuing immortality and had been a modest gentleman.A whirlpool of emotions stirred in her heart. Youqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes were soft as water, but her heart was very sentimental.\u2018Senior Brother Changshou is really a gentleman. I can never achieve the level of magnanimity that he possesses. Yuan Qing was also a far cry away from him,\u2019 she thought,\u2018Youqin Xuanya, most of the people you surround yourself with are superficial and arrogant. Therefore, you thought that everyone in the same generation is similar. However, you did not know that there is such a person amongst sect disciples of the same generation. If I can become close friends with Senior Brother Changshou, this trip will not be wasted\u2026\u2019\u201cRest assured, Senior Brother.\u201d Youqin Xuanya assured him. \u201cXuanya understands what you mean. I will follow as you say.\u201dLi Changshou blinked his eyes. Did that fellow really understand him?He had a strange feeling that her poison was not thoroughly cured.\u2018Forget about it.\u2019 Li Changshou was not going to leave the Little Qiong Peak when he returned. Even if there were troubles caused by this incident, they should subside within months.He could only avoid karma by keeping a low profile.As long as there was nothing abnormal after this trip, his trip to the North Continent could end on a happy note.All of a sudden, Li Changshou\u2019s expression changed. The webs of the Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spiders that he had placed outside the cave had suddenly captured an image.A few silhouettes were speeding in the air from hundreds of kilometers away. The person situated at the outermost of the group was clad in linen robe and had a lean figure.They were flying too fast, such that he could not make out her features. However, from the tightness of the short linen robe and the astonishing curves that could be seen when the wind pressed the robe against her figure\u2014Jiu Jiu!\u201cGet ready. They are here.\u201dLi Changshou laughed. The weights on his chest could finally be lifted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xuanya!\u201d\u201cChangshou! Aiya! Why did you come to such a dangerous place?\u201dAs Li Changshou stood at the cave entrance, he could not resist a smile when he saw the two silhouettes rushing down from the clouds.He did not expect that his master would join the search party.His old master was very emotional. He grabbed the familiar horsetail whisk and looked as though he was about to give Li Changshou a warm beating on his buttocks. Despite so, Li Changshou was still very touched to see his master.Li Changshou did not plan to hide away from the beating in front of the seniors in the sect. He wanted to allow his master to hit him a few times to appease his anger.He would not be hurt by that anyway.Jiu Jiu jumped down from the clouds along with Qi Yuan. Jiu Jiu had originally wanted to check if Li Changshou was alright. However, she remembered that Qi Yuan was also there. Therefore, she rushed to Youqin Xuanya instead.Seeing that his master lifted his horsetail whisk and was about to land a blow, Li Changshou showed a bitter expression. He closed his eyes and was prepared to be hit. However, the horsetail whisk only landed softly on his shoulder. His master did not use much force.Li Changshou heard Qi Yuan chide. \u201cWhy did you come to the dangerous North Continent? If Ling\u2019e did not wake me up, you would be dead by now. I would not even know where I could find your corpse!\u201dLi Changshou lowered his head and answered politely, \u201cMaster, I have been cultivating quietly in the sect for a long time and wanted to move around. Please forgive me for not informing you before I left.\u201d Then his gaze turned to the corner of his eyes.Jiu Jiu lifted Youqin Xuanya up with a hug and was spinning in circles. She was smiling like a child. Youqin Xuanya\u2019s cheeks were faintly red. She shouted, \u201cAunt-Master\u201d multiple times, but was still unable to escape from her hug.Their dresses danced in the wind along with their long, black hair. This \u2018Two-People Rotation\u2019 looked extremely pretty.\u2026Objectively speaking, Youqin Xuanya had a perfect figure. Her curves were also impeccable. Compared to Youqin Xuanya, Aunt-Master Jiu was a little short. Her face was also a little round. They had completely opposite styles.Li Changshou stopped looking only after a glance. He listened attentively to his master\u2019s neverending scoldings. The critics that he had just now were merely a habit that he had in his previous life as a gentleman. There were no inherent meanings to that.On the flip side, Li Changshou was more concerned about the actions of the short Daoist priest.Jiu Wu dragged the old Daoist priest that had been knocked unconscious and dropped him in front of them.When he saw that Li Changshou and Youqin Xuanya were completely fine, the short Daoist priest secretly shook his wrist. The old Daoist priest that he was carrying using his hand twitched. His aura soon disappeared.If Li Changshou was not wrong, that old Daoist priest\u2019s essence spirit was directly shattered by that move.Jiu Wu acted like nothing had happened. He threw the old Daoist priest\u2019s corpse into a nearby forest and looked at the reunion scene with a smile.\u2018This is a scary person. Killing people was as easy as killing an insect to him.\u2019Li Changshou\u2019s fingers that were hidden inside his sleeve pinched together as he cast a Dharma spell to predict the identity of that short Daoist priest. News about this priest surfaced in his mind. He categorized the information he knew.\u2018Jiu Wu, the Fifth Senior Brother of Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu. He is a biological disciple of the powerful Exalted Wang Qing in the Immortal Du Sect. He had been cultivating in the sect for about 2,000 years. His cultivation has reached the peak of the Perfected Immortal Realm and is a half-step to the Heaven Immortal Realm. He has a childlike personality and likes to fool around with people. However, in reality, he is very intelligent and also a little cunning. He is very loyal to the sect. He often leaves the sect to handle all kinds of matters, and he has many friends both within and outside of the sect. He likes to make wine and refine pills. His weakness is not very obvious.\u2019Li Changshou quickly concluded that he did not have to make friends with him deliberately. It was sufficient that he did his part as a disciple of the sect.On the other side, Jiu Jiu had finally let Youqin Xuanya down. She lifted her head and was grateful that she could probably keep most of her wine money.Youqin Xuanya heard Qi Yuan scold Li Changshou.\u201cWhat were you thinking? What gave you the courage to come here when you are only at the Soul Formation Realm? Were you hindering others?\u201d\u201cUncle-Master Qi Yuan!\u201dYouqin Xuanya cut him off. She spoke in a serious tone. \u201cSenior Brother Changshou did not hinder anyone. It was the complete opposite, actually. He had helped me several times\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I did not hinder anyone. I have been very helpful.\u201d Li Changshou cut Youqin Xuanya off. He showed a smug expression on his face, smiled, and said, \u201cMaster, I have news for you. I have achieved a breakthrough and have reached the Void Return Realm because of this priming trip.\u201dAs Li Changshou spoke, he emitted his aura, which indicated that he was at the First Stage of the Void Return Realm.His aura was still a little shaky. It appeared as though he had just achieved a breakthrough.Youqin Xuanya was a little confused.\u2018Why does Senior Brother\u2026 seem like a completely different person? He appeared calm and steady earlier, yet he was now a little frivolous.\u2019Li Changshou winked at her. Youqin Xuanya was a little stunned. She suddenly recalled what Li Changshou had told her earlier.She pursed her lips and did not know what to say.\u201cChangshou, you have achieved a breakthrough?\u201dQi Yuan was very emotional. He sensed Li Changshou\u2019s aura carefully, and a smile crept up his face while his eyes lit up.However, before Qi Yuan\u2019s smile blossomed completely, his expression turned angry immediately. \u201cYou have only gained enlightenment and reached the Void Return Realm after 100 years! How dare you be so complacent!? Look at Xuanya! She is your Junior Sister, but she has already reached the Fourth Stage of the Void Return Realm!\u201dLi Changshou smiled awkwardly. He seemed a little upset that his master scolded him. In reality, he was not at all upset internally. He even found it a little funny.\u201cIt is impressive to have reached the Void Return Realm in 100 years. That is already a superior-class talent.\u201d Jiu Wu smiled at the sides and said, \u201cJunior Brother Qi Yuan, my Second Senior Brother had only reached the Void Return Realm after 200 years. After that, he experienced a quantum leap after those years of accumulation. Within 20 years, he had survived the tribulation and had become an immortal. Cultivation depends largely on fate. Do not be so hard on your disciple. Oh right, Xuanya, do you know where Yuan Qing is?\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s expression darkened. She took two steps backward and knelt on one knee with the large sword on her back. She cupped her hands, lowered her head, and said, \u201cYuan Qing is dead. I killed him. Please punish me, Uncle-Master!\u201dJiu Wu furrowed his eyebrows and asked, \u201cDid you kill him personally?\u201d\u201cYes. My four swords pierced through his body and shattered his essence soul.\u201d Youqin Xuanya lowered her head and added, \u201cThis was entirely my fault. It has nothing to do with Senior Brother Changshou. He merely helped me to escape and saved my life using the Earth Escape technique. I am willing to accept all punishments by the sect!\u201dJiu Wu frowned and sank into deep thought.Jiu Jiu jumped towards Li Changshou. She had originally wanted to poke him using her elbow but decided against that. She did not touch Li Changshou\u2019s arm.\u201cHey. What happened?\u201d she asked softly.Li Changshou shook his head and remained silent.Jiu Wu heard Jiu Jiu\u2019s question and looked over. The short Daoist priest\u2019s gaze appeared like two sharp arrows that were about to pierce Li Changshou\u2019s eyes.Jiu Wu asked solemnly, \u201cMartial Nephew, why aren\u2019t you saying anything for Xuanya?\u201d\u201cI do not know exactly what happened,\u201d replied Li Changshou. He looked back at Jiu Wu collectedly.\u201cYou seem really collected,\u201d said Jiu Wu and sighed. \u201cActually, I had already searched through that Essence Immortal\u2019s spirit and soul on the way here. I know what happened roughly. Yuan Qing had an evil plan of bringing the battle of the mortal world\u2019s monarchy into the Immortal Du Sect. That is an unforgivable crime in itself. However, Martial Niece Xuanya, it is a huge offense to kill your fellow sect member. Whatever the reason may be, this is an indisputable crime\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu scolded him in an annoyed tone, \u201cWe can simply change this stupid rule. Yuan Qing made the first move, didn\u2019t he? Xuanya was only retaliating!\u201dYouqin Xuanya pursed her lips and remained silent.Seeing that, Li Changshou coughed and said, \u201cUncle-Master Jiu Wu, why don\u2019t we leave this place first? We can first meet up with the other Uncle-Masters and Aunt-Masters. Junior Sister Xuanya can then explain the entire story to everyone. As long as Junior Sister Xuanya tells the truth, I believe that the sect will understand her actions.\u201dThe last part of the sentence was actually directed at Youqin Xuanya.Youqin Xuanya looked at Li Changshou. Her eyes showed how helpless and bitter she was.Li Changshou sighed internally. He displayed a faint smile and gave her a slight nod.He could treat it like he was giving her some encouragement.Jiu Wu said, \u201cWe\u2019ll follow your suggestion. Let\u2019s first meet up with the others.\u201dAfter he finished his sentence, Jiu Wu scratched his head. He was also thinking of a way that could exempt Youqin Xuanya from the punishment.However, he recalled that Yuan Qing\u2019s master was also there\u2014that gave him a headache.The short Daoist priest produced a white cloud and made them come on board. He also reminded Youqin Xuanya to follow behind him closely to look out for her.Li Changshou followed his master closely. They stepped onto the white cloud and sat cross-legged.Qi Yuan was completely different from how drained he previously appeared. He appeared as though he had lost his parents when he had arrived. Now, he looked as though everything in life was going smoothly.He was now the master of a disciple who was at the Void Return Realm!Before the white cloud had lifted into the air, Jiu Wu seemed to have thought of something. He turned his body to face Li Changshou and asked while smiling, \u201cMartial Nephew Changshou?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dJiu Wu asked nonchalantly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you collect the spiderwebs of the Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spiders? These are incredibly rare items.\u201dLi Changshou gave a natural smile and replied, \u201cThank you for the concern. It is hard to collect these back after they were used. I have kept a few nests of Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spiders as pets in the Little Qiong Peak. If you are interested in these strange things, I can give you a nest when we return to the sect.\u201dJiu Wu raised one of his eyebrows. \u201cI shall not decline the offer then. You have great potential, little guy. We should get to know each other more in the future.\u201d\u201cAt your orders,\u201d Li Changshou smiled warmly and amiably. He did not say anything else.The more he said, the more mistakes he might make. Jiu Wu seemed to have seen through him a little. However, he asked for a \u2018sum of money\u2019 to make him keep quiet. That meant that Jiu Wu did not want to interfere with the cultivation of the disciples in the sect.However, Qi Yuan furrowed his eyebrows and looked at Li Changshou. His expression was solemn as he said, \u201cHow can you be so selfish? If your Uncle-Master did not come over to save you, who knows what could have happened to you!? How many immortal spider nests do you have? You should keep one nest and give the rest to Uncle-Master Jiu Wu!\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dA breath of air in his dantian gushed upwards. Li Changshou covered his mouth and coughed a few times.He tried to maintain his smile while he bit his molars harshly and said, \u201cYes\u2026 At your order\u2026\u201dJiu Wu was sitting at the front. The situation behind him was hilarious to him. He sat there and laughed out loud. However, he did not say anything.A round face peeked over from beside him. Jiu Jiu had shifted behind the old Daoist priest Qi Yuan. She leaned forward from Li Changshou\u2019s left-hand side and stared at him.Li Changshou leaned backward instinctively.As he had expected, when he leaned back, his field of vision was much clearer. He could see directly from the collars of the linen robe.\u201cCough.\u201dHe could effectively guard against Aunt-Master\u2019s sudden pranks.Jiu Jiu blinked her eyes. \u201cWhat are the spiderwebs that you were talking about? I feel like there is something weird with you and Fifth Brother.\u201dLi Changshou replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a rare material. I can\u2019t really explain it clearly. Why don\u2019t you ask Uncle-Master Jiu Wu?\u201d\u201cHmph. You don\u2019t want to explain it? Fine.\u201dJiu Jiu sat with her back straight. Suddenly, she seemed to have recalled something. She slapped her knees forcefully and said seriously, \u201cOh, right! Senior Brother Qi Yuan! Fifth Senior Brother! Look, look at Changshou\u2019s symptoms. Did something go wrong with his cultivation? Is he suffering from some mental demons?\u201d\u201cMental demons?\u201dQi Yuan, Jiu Wu, and Youqin Xuanya looked over at the same time. Jiu Jiu lifted her hand and poked Li Changshou\u2019s ear lobe.Her actions were extremely fluid. She had already lifted her hand when she was talking. There was no time for Li Changshou to react.Li Changshou was engulfed in black lines. His left hand trembled, making the muscles in his entire body shiver as well. His eyes rolled, and white foam appeared in his mouth. He sounded as though he was choking and out of breath.\u2018F*ck!\u2019Was this Aunt-Master toxic as well?No. This cloud itself was toxic! Everyone with the word Jiu in their Dao name had something wrong with them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was very concerned and asked Li Changshou when the symptoms appeared. He held Li Changshou\u2019s wrist and checked it carefully.The Daoist priest Qi Yuan was only at the Ninth Stage of the Dao Requital Realm. He was a step away from becoming an immortal. Therefore, Li Changshou could easily trick him when he attempted to detect the problem\u2014that helped Li Changshou solve the \u2018minor crisis\u2019.\u201cYour six senses are unsteady, and the heart is clouded,\u201d Qi Yuan warned in a serious tone. \u201cChangshou, you have to enter secluded cultivation for a period of time after you return to the sect. Do not leave our peak and walk about. I will remind Ling\u2019e not to disturb you. You have some problems with your inner self. Thankfully, the problem is not severe. You will be fine after a period of rest.\u201dLi Changshou nodded his head solemnly. \u201cYes, Master.\u201dYouqin Xuanya was sitting at the front. She was originally a little worried. After hearing that, she heaved a sigh of relief. Her expression fell in the eyes of Jiu Wu, who was sitting beside her.\u2018Interesting,\u2019 he thought.Jiu Wu lifted one of his eyebrows that were short and hairy. His expression seemed a little playful.After hearing Qi Yuan\u2019s words, Jiu Jiu was finally reassured. She jumped towards Youqin Xuanya and asked softly about what had happened.Li Changshou looked at the Soul-Bewitching Pearl in his storage Dharma artifact. There were still a few tattered souls that he had yet to dissolve. He could find a lot of memory pieces from within. Therefore, he released a stream of spiritual senses, placed the Soul-Bewitching Pearl in a deeper corner, and sealed it with a talisman.Everything would be good if he was not implicated.Jiu Wu was much more powerful than Jiu Jiu, but he did not dare to travel at full speed in the North Continent as well.This short Daoist priest was very cautious. He did not speak a word as he traveled. His eyes were on the alert as they swept past all areas\u2014that left a good impression on Li Changshou.Finally, they left the North Continent safely.After they had exited the place that was engulfed in Miasma Qi, Jiu Wu flew 50 kilometers in the south direction. He found a deserted mountain and notified the other sect members to meet him there.After waiting for about an hour, Wang Ji\u2019s master arrived first with Wang Ji and Liu Yan\u2019er.Youqin Xuanya\u2019s master, Jiang Jingshan, and Yuan Qing\u2019s master, Lin Qi, arrived after another four hours.Jiang Jingshan was a \u2018standard\u2019 female immortal. She was beautiful and appeared as though clear breezes surrounded her. She had an elaborate hairstyle and was wearing heavenly clothes. Jiang Jingshan looked heavenly but approachable.\u201cLittle Ya!\u201dWhen Jiang Jingshan saw a beloved disciple kneeling on the ground, she cried out her name. Youqin Xuanya was covered in bandages, while her dress was covered with bloodstains. She appeared extremely tired and seemed like a completely different person.Jiang Jingshan seemed devastated. She rushed towards Youqin Xuanya in just two steps and engulfed her in a hug.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here! I\u2019m here! I must be blinded by Yuan Qing when I accepted that bandit\u2019s request. How could I send you to search for the Fire-Loathing Enlightenment Herb and treat it as a priming opportunity? It\u2019s all my fault!\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes turned red. She took a deep breath and calmed herself down before replying in a hushed tone, \u201cIt\u2019s my incapability that made you worry about me.\u201dLin Qi, who arrived together with Jiang Jingshan, had just heard about Yuan Qing\u2019s death. He was not enraged. He looked at Youqin Xuanya and her master and asked solemnly, \u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201dWhen they had parted ways in search of the missing disciples, they had brought away one of the Essence Immortals that had been Yuwen Ling\u2019s accomplices. After hearing about the events from that Essence Immortal, they killed him as well.Jiu Wu said, \u201cDo not panic, Junior Brother Lin Qi. Let Xuanya explain the entire situation. Xuanya, try to be as specific as you can. Do not hide anything!\u201dJiang Jingshan motioned at her disciple. \u201cLittle Ya, say whatever you want. I have your back!\u201d\u201cAt your orders.\u201d Youqin Xuanya looked at Li Changshou, who was standing behind the crowd. Her emotions were rather unstable, but she calmed down when she saw him.She heaved a sigh before describing the events from when the five disciples parted ways. She was extremely detailed in her description and said everything that she knew.She talked from the afternoon to sunset and finished when the sky was filled with stars.\u2018Why didn\u2019t Sister Poisonous start telling the story from when the world was created?\u2019 Li Changshou thought sarcastically.He walked a little further away and started meditating while Youqin Xuanya described the entire situation that happened.After Jiu Jiu had been trapped, Yuan Qing had not attacked Youqin Xuanya immediately. He had hired a bunch of evil robbers to attack them beforehand to earn the reputation as the hero who saved the beauty.However, the \u2018beauty\u2019 Youqin Xuanya was much stronger than the \u2018hero\u2019 Yuan Qing, putting him in an awkward situation.Thereafter, Yuan Qing had changed his plans. He had had his accomplices pressurize them to make it seem as though they would not survive the attacks. He had then seized the opportunity to confess his feelings for Youqin Xuanya.However, Youqin Xuanya had firmly rejected his proposal to \u2018die together and meet again in their afterlives\u2019 even when she had been facing doom.Yuan Qing\u2019s plans had all failed, and that had angered him. Thus, he revealed his true self and tried to control Youqin Xuanya using a Love Parasite. However, Youqin Xuanya had found an opportunity to run away with a Precious Shifting Talisman. She had met Li Changshou on the way, and he saved her.After her injuries had recovered, Youqin Xuanya had wanted to take a detour and return to the Chaos Treasure Forest. However, after a few days, she had found that she had lost her way and had been unluckily found by Yuan Qing and his accomplices. They engaged in another battle.Li Changshou had happened to be walking past the battle again.Under the instruction of Li Changshou, Youqin Xuanya had lured those people to the nest of a powerful venomous creature. That bunch of people had been eventually poisoned by the creature and lost their life. Meanwhile, Youqin Xuanya had killed Yuan Qing by herself.When Youqin Xuanya said that, Li Changshou could not help but to exclaim internally, \u2018Yuan Qing had so many chances. Why couldn\u2019t he make use of it?\u2019Li Changshou was a little indignant for Yuwen Ling and Yuan Qing\u2019s other subordinates.After Youqin Xuanya finished her story, many eyes turned to Li Changshou.Jiang Jingshan led Youqin Xuanya over and thanked Li Changshou formally. She added that she would send them precious gifts when they returned to the sect. Li Changshou declined the offers \u2018demurely\u2019.Qi Yuan was afraid that Li Changshou would say something wrong, so he quickly accepted their thanks with a happy face.Only Yuan Qing\u2019s master, Lin Qi, was the most awkward.\u201cHaiz.\u201d Lin Qi sighed and exclaimed, \u201cI was blind when I accepted him as a disciple. I\u2019ll accept the punishment for that when we return to the mountains.\u201dJiu Wu consoled him. \u201cYuan Qing was extremely cunning. He had been devious since the day he entered the sect. You had accepted him as a disciple during the Sect Founding Ceremony previously. This is not your fault, Junior Brother.\u201dLin Qi shook his head, dejectedly. He did not want to say anything else.While Youqin Xuanya killing Yuan Qing was understandable and acceptable, she still had to receive punishment for killing her senior brother.The punishment would not be very severe. She was likely to be confined in the mountains for a couple of years to think through her wrongdoings.Jiu Wu praised Li Changshou as well. He said that the sect would definitely reward him after they returned. They would not rip him of the rewards that he deserved.The group did not return to the Immortal Du Sect together.Li Changshou, Liu Yan\u2019er, Wang Ji, and their masters took their time to return to the sect.Meanwhile, the others rushed back to the Immortal Du Sect to receive their punishments and admit their wrongdoings.The reason why they were in such a hurry was because of Jiang Jingshan.Youqin Xuanya\u2019s master was not an ordinary person. She was a disciple of the Sect Leader and held a high-ranking position in the sect. Her cultivation was impressive, and she had many Dharma treasures. Jiang Jingshan and her Dao companion were very respectful towards each other. Her Dao companion was a powerful cultivator who was at the Heaven Immortal Realm.Although the incident at the North Continent had ended, Jiang Jingshan would not allow her disciple to suffer such grievances.Before she made her way back, Jiang Jingshan had sent a letter to her Dao companion, requesting him to find a few sect members who had time in their hands. When she returned, they could head to the South Continent to demolish the mortal world organization supporting Yuan Qing. They would not allow any potential risks to be around!The journey back to the mountain was peaceful and mundane.However, while they were on their way, Li Changshou would always shiver when he heard Liu Yan\u2019er calling her \u2018Junior Brother Ji Ji\u2019 fondly.Cough\u2026 That\u2019s a cultural difference. In Li Changshou\u2019s original world, \u2018Junior Brother Ji Ji\u2019 sounded similar to \u2018Junior Brother D*ck\u2019\u2026\u2026The Little Qiong Peak was very peaceful at night. A white cloud stopped above the mountain. Li Changshou drifted off the cloud, while Qi Yuan headed to the other mountains on the cloud with a happy face.Li Changshou\u2019s master had just received an invitation from Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s master to gather and enjoy some wine.When Li Changshou crossed the isolation array formation that he had set up and stepped on the familiar grass patch, he let out a breath comfortably.\u2018Everything\u2019s so peaceful.\u2019\u201cSenior Brother!\u201dA happy cry sounded from beside him. Li Changshou turned his head and saw the green lights that were surrounding his junior sister\u2019s straw hut.The little array formation that was used to prevent outsiders from detecting what was happening inside had a crack, which was created from within the array formation. The voice he heard sounded from the crack.He heard another stream of water sounds. Ling\u2019e was shouting happily from the other side, \u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019re back! Are you injured? What happened previously? Why did you take so long to come back?\u201dBefore the sentence was finished, Li Changshou saw a beautiful silhouette rushing out from the straw hut. She was covered in a thin piece of blanket. That made her figure even more charming. Her long hair was wet, and there were water droplets on her soft skin.She did not bother about that. She jumped happily when she saw Li Changshou.Lan Ling\u2019e had just entered the wooden bathtub and was bathing. Maybe it was because of the water that entered her eyes while she was bathing, there was a film of water on her almond-shaped eyes. She spread her arms open and lunged forward.Li Changshou wanted to hide from her hug. However, when he saw Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s pitiful eyes, he sighed and stood where he was. He allowed his junior sister to fall in his chest.\u201cAnnoying Senior Brother, you have scared me! You left for so long. I thought something bad happened to you!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e spoke with a crying tone. She choked while she sobbed. However, before her tears fell, she felt a huge hand caress her head.\u201cSenior Brother\u2026\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e looked up. Her eyes were sparkling, and her lips were pursed together.Li Changshou suddenly said, \u201cOh, right. Master\u2026\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e suddenly realized something. She thought that their master had returned together with her senior brother. She yelped, turned around hurriedly, and raced back to the straw hut. She jumped into the huge wooden bathtub with her blanket and hid under the water.It was okay for her senior brother to see her scantily clad. However, she could not let any males other than her senior brother see her body!Not even her master!Lan Ling\u2019e detected the surroundings outside of the straw hut with her spiritual senses and lifted her head above the water curiously.Li Changshou\u2019s voice sounded from outside the hut. \u201cMaster had been invited to other mountains for a celebration. Allow me to rest. I\u2019ll talk to you about this priming journey at about three to five in the morning.\u201dAfter saying that, he operated the array formation around her straw hut again and went back to his house.Lan Ling\u2019e looked down at the thin blanket in the wooden bathtub. Her cheeks turned rosy.\u201cAnnoying Senior Brother\u2026\u201d she mumbled.She sank her head into the water and left a string of air bubbles on the water surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQi Yuan drank until midnight before he returned to the Little Qiong Peak.It had already been seven or eight years since Li Changshou had last seen his master look this happy. As he walked, he hummed a melody that Li Changshou had never heard before.When he passed by Li Changshou at the door, Qi Yuan shouted, \u201cChangshou? Are you cultivating?\u201d\u201cMaster, your disciple is taking a break. I am relaxing my heart and mind today and preparing to cultivate tomorrow,\u201d replied Li Changshou, who was seated on the straw bed with his eyes closed. He was just about to stand up and open the door for his master when he heard the latter laugh.\u201cRest, rest. I am going back into seclusion. You did well this time. You used your escape techniques to save Martial Niece Youqin Xuanya of the Heaven-Breaking Peak. You have really glorified our Little Qiong Peak this time. However, you cannot become too proud of yourself. You must make cultivation your priority. Do not spend more time and effort than before on your escape techniques. Your own Dao Realm should be at the core!\u201d\u201cYour disciple understands,\u201d replied Li Changshou from inside the house.Qi Yuan smiled as he stroked his beard, and said, \u201cMm, keep working hard to solidify your cultivation level. You cannot act with undue haste when cultivating. You have to progress steadily, step by step. That is the only way you will be able to cross major hurdles. Go ahead and rest. Your Master is going into seclusion. Ling\u2019e has become haggard from worrying about you over the past few days. Remember to comfort her later on.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied Li Changshou in a warm tone.Qi Yuan laughed and then continued humming as he walked into his own straw hut. After he entered, he activated several arrays around his house.One needed silence while cultivating in seclusion. Noise-cancellation-type arrays and vigilance-type arrays were necessary.Li Changshou looked at the jade boxes in his storage Dharma artifacts, and then heaved a sigh of relief. He would prepare for several more days before starting to build the Pill Chamber, which he had been dreaming about for a long time. Finally, he would be able to refine Immortal-Melting Pills.If he could refine Immortal-Melting Pills successfully, and persuade his master to use these pills while he was enduring the Heavenly Tribulation, there would be a 90% chance that his master would survive.To Postnatal living beings who wanted to live long, becoming an immortal through the Heavenly Tribulation was suffering that could not be avoided.Once the Heavenly Lightning struck, the decision would be made on their life or death.Since the ancient days, nobody dared to say with complete confidence that they would be able to make it through the Heavenly Tribulation alive.Since he had been injured before, Qi Yuan\u2019s Dao base was compromised, and his own cultivation level was not stable. The power of his soul was also about half that of ordinary cultivators in the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital.If Li Changshou did not find other ways to help him, his master would surely die during the Heavenly Tribulation.Yet, Qi Yuan insisted on enduring the Heavenly Tribulation to become an immortal.Qi Yuan was not only the Master of Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e, but he was also the Peak Leader of the Little Qiong Peak. He was the only Peak Leader in the Immortal Du Sect, who had not yet ascended to immortality. The other senior Peak Leaders would never inform the Little Qiong Peak about the decisions they made.In comparison, Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu, who had joined the Immortal Du Sect several years after Qi Yuan, was already a Perfected Immortal. Unfortunately, Qi Yuan was far behind her.Before ascending to immortality, human cultivators had to be younger than 3,000 years old. This was the Dao limit. Qi Yuan actually had hundreds, maybe even over 1,000, of years to go.However, Li Changshou knew that his master did not want to suppress his cultivation level any longer\u2014much less did his master want to wait until he was running out of time before he took a gamble and tried ascending to immortality.At times, Li Changshou even felt like his Master was hoping to die in the Heavenly Tribulation. Perhaps he wanted to endure the Heavenly Tribulation with this expectation of death, in the hopes that he would be able to survive!Perhaps all of this sounded noble and enthusiastic. However, to Li Changshou, his master\u2019s mindset was both stubborn and silly.That was why Li Changshou had begun preparing 15 years ago\u2026That was the reason Li Changshou had decided to act against his principles for the very first time, by leaving the security of his own mountain and going to the North Continent. When he had found the Immortal-Emancipating Herb, he had also decided to take the risk and plot against the Three-Eyed Blue Wave Serpent, Yuwen Ling, and the others.The core of Li Changshou\u2019s first plan to \u2018Help Master Endure the Tribulation\u2019 involved refining Immortal-Melting Pills from Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.When the time came for his master to endure the Heavenly Tribulation, Qi Yuan would only have to make it through the first tribulation in order to develop a wisp of immortal spiritual aura. Then, he would be able to swallow the Immortal-Melting Pill. The pill would allow him to feign death and activate the \u2018Deliverance by Execution\u2019. Then, he could avoid enduring the subsequent tribulations.If immortals failed to endure the Heavenly Tribulation, they could go through Deliverance by Execution and become Turbid Immortals.Turbid Immortals could not compare to Essence Immortals in terms of cultivation and mystical abilities. However, they had similar lifespans. They could also continue to cultivate.According to the classic texts, the highest cultivation level that Turbid Immortals could achieve was the Perfected Immortal Realm. This route was often referred to as the Earth Immortal Dao, in contrast to the Heaven Immortal Dao.As part of this first plan, Li Changshou had even managed to chart out the later years of his master\u2019s life.Qi Yuan would become an Earth Immortal and accumulate hundreds of years of cultivation. Then, he would go to the Heavenly Courts, which had just been set up and were lacking manpower. There, he would get an easy role as the Earth God of a small region, a Mountain God, or a River God. All he would have to do was enjoy fragrant offerings and enjoy a lifespan as long as ordinary Perfected Immortals.If Qi Yuan managed to achieve something that would earn him rewards from the Heavenly Courts, he might even be able to live as long as Heaven Immortals.At the same time, Qi Yuan could build a network in the Heavenly Courts. Once Li Changshou and his junior sister were ready, they could go to the Heavenly Courts and apply for an easy role as well. In the future, they could become elders of the Management Organization of the Three Realms. Then, they would enjoy an easy life until they died of old age.That was a perfect plan.\u201cRefining this pill would not be considered cumbersome. If I could get a Perfected Immortal like Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu to help me, and if I could prepare more ingredients, I would be able to produce it. However\u2026\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s master was a model cultivator in the sect. He was the type that would rather suffer and die than lose his reputation. Persuading him to use such a method to survive would probably be much more difficult than finding the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.Still, as his disciple, Li Changshou had to endure this karma. This was a responsibility that he could not shy away from.If this did not work, he would have to cheat and lie. He would have no choice but to wrap the Immortal-Melting Pill in candy and tell his master that it was a life-saving immortal pill.Just thinking about this made Li Changshou smile.The birds and bees cried out outside his window as he began to think about his own experience during this journey. He reflected on the areas in which he fell short.Li Changshou was not good enough when he dealt with the Essence Immortal. He was also not fast enough in cleaning up.He could improve on his Man-Forming Paper Cutouts. The clones he produced still did not look 100% realistic.Li Changshou was also slow in transitioning between the escape techniques of the Five Elements. When he entered the roots of the old cypress tree, there were waves in the ground.After a self-reflection period, Li Changshou found that he still had time to improve on these shortcomings. After all, there was no need for Li Changshou to go out on more expeditions. He would just remain on the mountain to cultivate.As for his own Heavenly Tribulation, Li Changshou was in no hurry. As long as he was not 99% sure that he would survive the tribulation, Li Changshou would not take that step.The remaining 1% chance was left in case there were spasms in the Heavenly Dao.Dong!A rock knocked into the wooden wall of his straw hut. Li Changshou pinched his fingers together to count and realized that it was already past five in the morning.He got to his feet and walked out of the straw hut, towards the house where his junior sister lived.\u2026In the ten years since his junior sister had joined the sect, Lan Ling\u2019e had been receiving lessons, make-up lessons, and life guidance from 03:00 to 05:00 a.m.When Li Changshou arrived in front of her straw hut, he knocked on her door gently, causing it to open slightly on its own. Then, he pushed it and walked in.A pink curtain flew towards him. Even the carpet underneath his feet had become pink.Through the translucent screen, he saw a familiar figure lying on the bed, facing inwards. Her gauzy dress gave Li Changshou glimpses of a beautiful view.The obstructed view, however, was the most forgiving\u2014it spared one from developing dirty thoughts.Li Changshou did not spare her a second glance. He sat at the host\u2019s seat and said nonchalantly, \u201cStop pretending to be asleep. You don\u2019t normally sleep in such a graceful position.\u201dHe heard whining coming from behind the screen. \u201cSenior Brother, I just learned how to produce the Soft Immortal Disperser. Now, I\u2019m feeling quite dizzy and lightheaded. I can\u2019t do anything else. My body is weak, and I have no energy.\u201dLi Changshou nodded. He stood up and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow then. It\u2019s no big deal anyway.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e immediately shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d Then, indignantly, she said, \u201cSit down! I\u2019m coming out now! Hmph. You better explain clearly why you came back so late!\u201dThere was a lot of swishing around before Lan Ling\u2019e finally walked out from behind the screen in a long dress. She sat on the left side of the table and glared at Li Changshou furiously.Li Changshou smiled helplessly and said, \u201cActually, we met with an accident. Do you know Yuan Qing of the Heaven-Breaking Peak?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied Lan Ling\u2019e. She blinked and said, \u201cHe\u2019s the disciple from the Heaven-Breaking Peak who went to the North Continent with you. He\u2019s ranked second in our generation. It\u2019s said that he\u2019s quite gentle.\u201d\u201cRemember: Men only put on an act of being gentle. He plotted against Youqin Xuanya this time, and Youqin Xuanya killed him.\u201dLi Changshou shook his head and organized the images surfacing in his memories.\u201cEverything he did was an example of losing the big picture for the sake of minor gains. He gave up his own identity as a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, and insisted on obtaining worldly, transient royal powers.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e supported her chin with her hand and leaned forward on the table. Softly, she said, \u201cSenior Brother, what happened?\u201dLi Changshou slowly explained, \u201cYouqin Xuanya is the Sixth Princess of a country in the South Continent. Yuan Qing is the son of a concubine, belonging to a distinguished family. He is referred to as Fourth Young Master.\u201cYuan Qing\u2019s mother was probably a concubine, but she was a powerful one. She was the young mistress of another distinguished family and held some power herself.\u201cThese people set their sights on the Sixth Princess, who had been sent as a disciple to the Immortal Du Sect.\u201cIf Yuan Qing married the Sixth Princess, not only would he become the prince of that worldly country, but he would also be able to hold more power in his own household. At the same time, there would be a possibility of him governing an entire country in the future. That was why they expended so much effort and made sure Yuan Qing entered the Immortal Du Sect as well.\u201cHowever, Yuan Qing was not very successful. Even after 60 years, he failed to win the beauty\u2019s heart. The people supporting him grew worried. At last, they decided that they could not wait any longer. They decided to take this risk\u2026\u201dLi Changshou briefly explained everything that had happened to his junior sister.\u201cNow, not only did these people fail, they incurred huge losses. Both families are going to be implicated. Their Country Lord might have to uproot all of them in order to appease the Immortal Du Sect.\u201dSeeing Lan Ling\u2019e in deep thought, Li Changshou said warmly, \u201cLittle E, what dis you learn from this story?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e hummed in a low voice. Then, she decisively said, \u201cWomen should never become concubines! Otherwise, we would have to expend a lot of effort to gain a bit of power!\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dLi Changshou could not help but rest his forehead on his hand. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cThis Yuan Qing\u2019s plan was awful. What\u2019s more, the influential members of these distinguished families severely underestimated the power of the Immortal Du Sect and the value of its disciples.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e began her analysis very seriously. \u201cI think that they should have worked to beat down Youqin Xuanya. They should have tolerated their desire for several thousand years until Yuan Qing became a Heaven Immortal. Then, he could have secretly become a king of a worldly country. Using his powers, he could have collected the wealth of his people and donated it to the Immortal Du Sect. That would have increased his status and importance in the sect. That way, he would have succeeded in terms of his immortal cultivation and his worldly pursuits! Wanting to rise to power as the husband of a princess would be fantasizing. These kings have no lack of sons.\u201dLi Changshou was rendered speechless.\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s take this as music to the ears. You come from a distinguished, worldly family as well. I wanted to remind you to be cautious.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Senior Brother. Ling\u2019e will not go anywhere without you.\u201dLi Changshou could not help but shake his head and laugh. \u201cHand me your medicine sachet. I\u2019ll fill it up for you. You must have used quite a bit this time.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e immediately looked guilty. She slowly sat upright and crossed her long, slender legs. She rested both of her hands on her knees and averted her beautiful eyes. She was acting\u2014obedient, cute, and distracted.\u2018Come on. I didn\u2019t waste the poisonous powder and pills that Senior Brother gave me this time\u2026\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He began to mumble to himself in a low voice, as if a violent storm was brewing, \u201cMy Junior Sister is a wastrel! She was fighting prawn demons, who had as much battle skills as ordinary mortals. Yet, she used up more than 80% of the poisonous powder that I prepared for her\u2026 This amount was enough to kill 100,000-strong mortal armies!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e knelt on the futon in front of him, two streams of tears flowing down her cheeks. She tried to look as pitiful as possible so that she could escape the righteous punishment of her senior brother.The corners of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched as he picked up a purse and asked, \u201cDid you kill great demons at the East Ocean?\u201d\u201cWell, Senior Brother said to use this if I met with any danger\u2026 Those prawn demons nearly killed me! I poured out the powder subconsciously!\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cI remember preparing nine bottles of this for you.\u201d\u201cI was nearly killed several times\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and continued crying. Indignantly, she whined, \u201cSenior Brother, don\u2019t be angry. I know that you put a lot of effort into producing these things. I didn\u2019t waste them on purpose.\u201dLi Changshou could not find it in himself to blow up at his junior sister while she looked like that. He sighed and said, \u201cEffort is a small thing, but the ingredients are hard to find. Few people in the Immortal Du Sect know how to produce poisonous pills. I used my own monthly allowance to exchange for these ingredients bit by bit.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, I thought about this, too.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked, and then patted the girdle wrapped around her slender waist. Then, she retrieved seven or eight simple storage Dharma artifacts.\u201cThat\u2019s why I exchanged the rewards that I earned this time for poisonous herbs and medicines that I found in the sect! We did not incur a loss this time. I think we even made a profit!\u201dLi Changshou did not know whether to laugh or cry. He studied Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s widened eyes, which looked like two clear gems. There was a hint of evasion.\u2018This lass\u2026\u2019\u201cWhat else do you have to account for? Tell me everything while my mood is still quite good.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e sucked in a deep breath and raised up her arms all of a sudden. With all her might, she leaned over, lowered her head, and knocked her palms and forehead against the ground at the same time. Her long hair fell on either side of her face.She was kowtowing to admit her mistake!Lan Ling\u2019e closed her eyes tightly and plucked up her courage to shout,\u201cSenior Brother! Ling\u2019e did you wrong! Two Uncle-Masters became interested in the poisonous powder that you produced. They took several bottles of my most powerful poisons! I really did not know how to turn them down. Senior Brother, I accidentally exposed the fact that you are highly-skilled in producing poisons!\u201dThe house became so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s shoulders kept trembling.She was not afraid of being scolded by her senior brother. In fact, she wanted her senior brother to hit her to release his frustrations.Her senior brother had taught her everything she knew. She understood his principles. That was why she was so nervous. Lan Ling\u2019e was worried that he would \u2018abandon\u2019 her and not want anything to do with her in the future.\u2018Why\u2026 is it so quiet\u2026? I\u2019m done for, I\u2019m done for. Senior Brother is completely disappointed in me this time! Lan Ling\u2019e, Lan Ling\u2019e. How did you lose control of yourself the moment you stepped outside? You even neglected to take care of yourself and ended up showing off in front of others. Now, other elders in the sect have their eyes on you\u2026\u2019In the entire world, Lan Ling\u2019e probably understood her senior brother\u2019s character the best.Li Changshou could hide 90% of his skills as his trump cards. In everything, he prioritized being low-key. He would never incur unnecessary karma.Lan Ling\u2019e was probably the only person who was cared for and loved by her senior brother, and it was only because they shared the same master. Otherwise, her senior brother would probably have never spared her a second glance!Lan Ling\u2019e sobbed as she said, \u201cSenior Brother, you can hit me if you want, but please don\u2019t abandon me\u2026 I know that I was wrong. I will never unnecessarily show off in front of others again!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e caught a glimpse of a hand reaching out towards her, and instinctively squeezed her eyes shut.Ever since Lan Ling\u2019e had joined the sect, she had never endured physical punishment. Would her first time be a good bashing from her senior brother?It was a good thing if he would hit her. At the very least, her senior brother could employ such a method of punishment on her.The hand, which carried countless worries, finally landed. However, it did not hit her. Instead, it made a bend and pinched her ear, and then twisted left and right.\u201cOw, Senior Brother, be gentle\u2026 It hurts\u2026 My ear is falling off\u2026\u201d\u201cStop using this tone with me. If Master hears you, he might think I\u2019m doing something else.\u201dLi Changshou let go of the small ear and said matter-of-factly, \u201cGet up. That\u2019s no big deal.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e immediately sat upright and got to her feet. This movement revealed a considerable amount of her slender figure.Frustrated, she looked at her senior brother and asked softly, \u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019re not hiding your skills? Are you going to have a face-off with the sect?\u201d\u201cA face-off? What face-off?\u201dOnce again, Li Changshou didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know you well?\u201cSince I gave you the poisonous powder to protect yourself, I was already prepared for you to do something like that. Actually, I purposely allowed you to reveal these poisons. I had other important considerations, as well.\u201cCome and sit down.\u201cWas Senior Wan Linyun of the Pill Tripod Peak among the two elders who took the poisons from you?\u201cThis senior has a disease in his left leg, so he walks with a copper cane. He looks quite cold, too. However, when he talks to others, he tends to put on a stiff smile.\u201d\u2018Purposely allowed me to reveal? Other important considerations?\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e was stunned. \u201cSenior Brother, how did you know? It was that elder indeed. Didn\u2019t you just return last night? The person who first asked me for the poisonous powder was Elder Ge, the organizer of the Priming Meet. Two days ago, at noon, the old man with the cane came over. He gave me many herbs and took those. Senior Brother!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e reacted quickly and turned to look into Li Changshou\u2019s deep eyes. Through gritted teeth, she said, \u201cYou planned it all!\u201d\u201cWhy put it that way between us, Junior Sister? I was just trying to protect you. The more you knew, the more burdened you would feel.\u201dLi Changshou waved his hand nonchalantly and smiled. \u201cThe poisonous powder that I gave you was made with careful attention being paid to matching the quantity and toxicology of various herbs. There were no high-level refining methods involved. It doesn\u2019t matter even if more people take note.\u201cDisciples of various peaks can obtain the recipe from the Dao Sutra Outer Hall. They can also obtain the herbs from the Bai Fan Hall.\u201cNow, within the sect\u2014and even in other immortal cultivation sects in the five continents\u2014most people underestimate poisons\u2019 power. They think that this is an embarrassing skill. People who make use of poisons are often excluded and looked down upon.\u201cThus, it\u2019s not a big deal even if people find out that I am well-versed in refining poisons. It would not attract the attention of observers. Instead, they would think that I\u2019m an average disciple who has gone down the wrong path.\u201dLi Changshou paused mid-sentence, a knowing smile spreading across his face.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, the poisonous powder I gave you contains several strange poisons, which are mentioned in the Poison Sutra I copied from the Dao Sutra Pavilion. The author of that Poison Sutra is this Elder Wan Linyun. I think he is the elder with the deepest comprehension of poisons in our Immortal Du Sect. If I can build connections with this elder through this encounter, perhaps I will be able to obtain some guidance from him in this respect.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e whined indignantly. \u201cDo you have to make use of me in your plan?! If this was the case, couldn\u2019t you have just informed me in advance? You made use of your gentle and adorable Junior Sister. You really are\u2026 too much\u2026\u201dLi Changshou cast a sideways glance at her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject. We\u2019re talking about you wasting the poisonous pills. I have to make you suffer for it so that you will remember this lesson. I will punish you by making you do logging in the back mountain tomorrow to reclaim the land. You\u2019re not allowed to use your Dharmic powers as well.\u201d\u201cSo be it. That\u2019s no big deal,\u201d replied Lan Ling\u2019e as she lowered her gaze\u2014submission was written all over her face.Finally, she could not hold it in any longer and asked, \u201cWhat are we reclaiming the land for?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a Pill Chamber to refine pills and poisons. Through you, I allowed the Sect\u2019s Management to find out that I am good at refining poisons. After this, I will be able to naturally and systematically tinker more pills and poisons in our Little Qiong Peak. I won\u2019t have to do all of this in hiding anymore.\u201dOnce he finished speaking, Li Changshou stood up and picked up all the medicine sachets. Then, he stretched and said, \u201cOnce I finish meditating at noon, I will find a suitable position to build the Pill Chamber.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019re obviously trying to slack off. How could you ask your gentle Junior Sister to log?!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e made a face at Li Changshou\u2019s back as she whined.\u201cThis is for you, the gentle cultivator.\u201dWhen Li Changshou reached the door, he suddenly recalled something. He pulled a jade box out from his sleeve and tossed it to his junior sister.\u201cA present?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e immediately forgot her frustration and caught the jade box excitedly.She was just about to open it when she suddenly realized something. Using her Dharmic powers to hold onto her box, she sent it ten feet away before opening it from afar.A subtle fragrance entered her nose. There was a white flower with six petals lying in the jade box.\u2018It\u2019s a herb. I thought it was jewelry or something.\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e was just about to curse at her senior brother but found that he had already left the room. All that remained was his slightly-exhausted, hoarse voice, saying, \u201cNext time, before you take a bath, put this in warm water. It\u2019ll expand your meridians, detoxify and nourish the face, and make your skin glow. See you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you, Senior Brother. See you tomorrow\u2026\u201dHu\u2026Lan Ling\u2019e heaved a huge sigh of relief and slumped down on her chair. Then, she smiled excitedly.She made it through safely!Her senior brother still pampered her. At first, Lan Ling\u2019e thought that she would receive a harsh dressing down after wasting so much poisonous powder. She did not expect that her senior brother would just pinch her ear.Yet, it looked like her senior brother had everything planned for the Priming Meet, down to the little details.Lan Ling\u2019e was unhappy about it\u2014she could not help but feel that her senior brother still did not trust her.\u2018Forget it, that\u2019s what Senior Brother is like.\u2019He always burned his cut hair until not even dust remained, and used poison to melt his cut nails until they melted completely. Even after his junior sister got drunk on purpose, he would use Immortal-Trapping Locks to tie her to the bed before tucking her in.\u2018Er, I seemed to have revealed a little too much.\u2019 Lan Ling\u2019e blushed. \u2018I did not get drunk on purpose last year!\u2019\u2026After returning to his own straw hut, Li Changshou meditated by his bedside. In his mind, he began planning to build the Pill Chamber.Before this, he had been using the herb tripod, which he always carried with him. However, that had not been enough to satisfy his needs. What\u2019s more, in order to produce much stronger pills like the Immortal-Melting Pill, he needed a bigger and better quality herb tripod.First, he had to build the Pill Chamber. Then, he would go to the Bai Fan Hall to look for familiar martial uncles and martial aunts for help.He could desire better tripods, but he could not expect them. This all depended on his luck.It would be best if he could find an old, worn-out herb tripod. He would try to salvage it and see if he could produce any miracles. Actually, Li Changshou had already been thinking about the Pill Chamber for 30 to 40 years now. He had just been hesitating.Mediocrity was the best disguise.From the isolation array formation, which surrounded the place where he lived with his master, to the array formation outside his and his junior sister\u2019s straw huts, and the mountains, water, and trees around the Little Qiong Peak, everything looked ordinary. There was nothing special to speak of.When building this Pill Chamber, Li Changshou would have to make arrangements both inside and outside to prevent others from discovering his \u2018little techniques\u2019 when refining pills and poisons.From the beginning of his cultivation journey, Li Changshou understood that any intentional disguise would not hide his true progress from experts. Instead, they might attract special attention\u2014being observed by these experts was not necessarily a good thing.On the flip side, not being noticed by them would ensure that nothing unexpectedly bad would happen to Li Changshou, or at the very least, the chances of that happening were slim.\u201cThe Pill Chamber cannot be too close to our accommodations. If poisonous aura leaks\u2026\u201d Li Changshou mumbled to himself in a low voice and pulled out a storage Dharma artifact, which he used exclusively to store books. From inside, he pulled out a thick stack of sheepskin.There were array formations and blueprints of structures drawn on each sheepskin. There were also signs of many modifications being done on each drawing. The ink on the oldest sheepskin among them seemed to be fading.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was dressed in her training attire, which was embroidered with orchids and grass. Her hair was tied up with purple silk. Currently, she was waving her big axe non-stop. Yet, she looked inexplicably graceful.Through gritted teeth, this young woman spoke with \u2018kind regards\u2019.\u201cYou won\u2019t let me use Dharmic powers, what if my bulging muscles grow on my legs and arms?! I\u2019m a female cultivator! Really\u2026 and you said you would watch me log. Where are you?! You\u2019ve gone back to meditate! Hmph, stinky Senior Brother. I will uproot you, break your trunks and branches, cut off your roots and leave no inch of grass behind! Break!\u201dCrack!The old tree swayed back and forth slowly, before it finally tumbled to the ground, scaring all of the birds in the forest.All of a sudden, she heard a voice from behind her.\u201cAre you\u2026 Little Ling\u2019e?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e jumped up, holding her axe. Immediately, she became cautious. When she landed on the ground, she turned around and looked up at the person floating in the air. For some reason, she looked familiar.The female immortal was seated cross-legged on a ten-feet-long wine gourd, and was dressed in a dirty-looking hemp garment. \u2018D*mn, her hemp garment looks like it\u2019s going to be torn apart at any moment. Oh, so it\u2019s Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu!\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e quickly set her axe down and cupped her hands in a Dao salute towards Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu. In the back of her mind, she recalled several model greetings that her senior brother had taught her. From among them, she chose the most appropriate one and gently said, \u201cYour disciple Ling\u2019e pays her greetings to Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu. Your disciple\u2019s cultivation is low, and I did not welcome you fast enough. Please forgive me, Aunt-Master.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t stand on ceremony,\u201d replied Jiu Jiu. Immediately, she developed a liking towards this martial niece standing underneath her, who was polite and courteous with her words.Jiu Jiu kept her huge wine gourd and jumped down from the sky.\u201cIs your Senior Brother here? I am looking for him.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother should be cultivating,\u201d answered Lan Ling\u2019e gently and submissively. \u201cAunt-Master, may I invite you to go in and wait, while I ask Master to come out of seclusion to welcome you? This humble house always falls short in showing hospitality. Aunt-Master, please forgive us.\u201d\u201cAi, don\u2019t go to all that trouble. I came just to look for your Senior Brother. Your Master is about to ascend to immortality. Let him stay in seclusion, and don\u2019t disturb him.\u201dJiu Jiu waved her hand, and then turned around to survey her surroundings. \u201cLittle Ling\u2019e, what are you logging for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a method of cultivation. Aunt-Master, I have embarrassed myself in front of you.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e\u2019s reply came quickly and naturally. Yet, she felt confused inside.\u2018What is this Martial Aunt looking for my Senior Brother for?\u2019Cultivators enjoyed long lifespans after ascending to immortality. There were also many cross-generational Dao couples in the sect.The martial aunt standing in front of Lan Ling\u2019e had a beautiful face and a full figure. Although she looked unkempt, she was naturally pretty, and had great potential as well.\u2018More importantly, Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu went on an expedition with Senior Brother before\u2026 Something\u2019s fishy!\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e immediately became wary. The cogs in her mind spun, as she thought of a way to find out why Jiu Jiu was here.However, before she could speak, several waves appeared in the ground a short distance from her. Li Changshou\u2019s figure slowly emerged. Then, he cupped his hands and bowed to Jiu Jiu.Shortly after, Jiu Jiu and Li Changshou were seated cross-legged at either side of the short table in Li Changshou\u2019s straw hut.Jiu Jiu had come to give Li Changshou his reward for this Priming Meet. At the same time, she brought Jiang Jingshan\u2019s thank-you gift to Li Changshou. Two storage Dharma treasures sat on the sort table.Li Changshou did not stand on ceremony and accepted them both.In the storage ring that Uncle-Master Jiang gave to him, Li Changshou saw a hill of Dharma treasures and spirit stones. His heart filled with appreciation.As he surveyed the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s earth meridians earlier, Li Changshou worried about the resources he would need to build the various array formations. However, after receiving Uncle-Master Jiang\u2019s gift, half of his problems were solved.Li Changshou asked, \u201cAunt-Master, why didn\u2019t you go to the South Continent?\u201d\u201cAi!\u201d Jiu Jiu sighed. Listlessly, she slumped on the table. Her eyes looked dull. \u201cI wanted to go and play around, but when I got back to the mountain, they questioned and reprimanded me until now. I just came out from the Punishment Hall. I\u2019m worrying now. The elders have punished me with an alcohol ban lasting three years. Ah, they might as well tie me to the Lightning-Conducting Pillar to be struck for three years\u2026\u201dLi Changshou could not help but smile. It was only then that he realized Jiu Jiu\u2019s little Dharma wine gourd was gone. The elders of the sect must have taken it away.Just then, Lan Ling\u2019e entered the house carrying tea. When she saw this scene, she pursed her lips.\u2018They look so casual. This Martial Aunt gets along so well with Senior Brother. There is something wrong with her indeed.\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e served the tea, and then carried her own meditation cushion to her senior brother\u2019s side. She knelt down and sat on her feet obediently, and even intentionally placed her arm on her senior brother.Jiu Jiu saw this and stared at Li Changshou. \u201cEh? Changshou, your condition?\u201d\u201cNothing happens when Junior Sister touches me. I think it\u2019s because we have known each other for a long time,\u201d replied Li Changshou calmly. \u201cWhen females other than Junior Sister touch me, I will start to convulse.\u201d\u201cCough! Cough, cough!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e began coughing uncontrollably. Her pained expression could probably be attributed to her efforts to try and keep in her laughter.\u201cOh, I see.\u201dJiu Jiu did not become suspicious. She remained slumped on the table as she sighed listlessly. Both her eyes were still devoid of light.\u201cThree years. How can I endure three years? How can I go into seclusion without wine? How can I cultivate? I won\u2019t even be able to sleep. I will have no energy to do anything. This rascal, Yuan Qing. Why did he have to set all of these up? He could have just gotten himself into trouble. Now, I have to endure three years of punishment as well.\u201dLi Changshou frowned and pondered deeply as he rubbed his chin and sighed.When Lan Ling\u2019e saw this expression on her senior brother\u2019s face, she instinctively moved aside and sat upright. She looked steadily forward, not daring to say a single word.Lan Ling\u2019e stole a glance at the angle at which Li Changshou\u2019s eyebrows were tilted downward. Then, she confirmed that her senior brother was going to play a trick on someone!Every time her senior brother made that expression, either she or her master would be used in his plan!\u201cAunt-Master Jiu, why don\u2019t we negotiate something?\u201d\u201cHuh? Negotiate what?\u201d asked Jiu Jiu wearily.\u201cFor the three years that Aunt-Master is not allowed to drink wine, if you\u2019re unable to cultivate, why not come and build array formations together with your disciple?\u201d Li Changshou\u2019s expression was serious as he continued, \u201cAs thanks for your help, your disciple will help Aunt-Master brew three premium kinds of wine that have already ceased to exist. Three years later, Aunt-Master can enjoy them. What\u2019s more, you will get a drink that can replace wine.\u201d\u201cPremium wine that has ceased to exist? A drink that can replace wine?\u201dJiu Jiu immediately perked up and sat upright. \u201cWhat is it? Are you trying to bluff me into doing work for you for free? Let\u2019s make this clear, I\u2019m not good at array formations.\u201d\u201cAunt-Master, you will only need to use your immortal powers to stabilize the base of the array formation and suppress the spiritual powers,\u201d replied Li Changshou as he smiled calmly. Then, he asked, \u201cAunt-Master, do you like to drink wine or the taste of wine? Do you like the taste of wine or the feeling you get when you drink too much?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Jiu Jiu said softly, \u201cBoth. I joined the sect when I was three years old. Coincidentally, my Fifth Senior Brother, who was put in charge of taking care of me, loved drinking wine. Once, he accidentally threw me in a wine vat to be bathed. Since then, I could not get my hands off of this stuff. If you really want to know, the taste of the wine is important to me, but so is the floating feeling I get when I drink enough of it.\u201d\u201cAunt-Master, please look at this.\u201dLi Changshou pointed to the tea cup in front of him. From inside his sleeve, he pulled out a small, jade pot. He opened the jade pot and put a drop of light-green liquid into the tea cup.A moment later, a fragrant smell floated across the room. The drink in the tea cup turned green.Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cTry it, Aunt-Master. See if you get the same floating feeling.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Jiu Jiu blinked, picked up the tea cup, and smelled the drink out of habit. She could only smell a light fragrance. Then, she lowered her head and took a sip. At once, her eyes lit up.She raised her hand and downed the rest of the drink at one go.Jiu Jiu\u2019s face slowly flushed red. A distant look appeared in her eyes, and she grinned helplessly.\u201cGood stuff\u2026 good job\u2026\u201dClang!The tea cup dropped onto the table as Jiu Jiu slowly lay back down. She slowly adjusted herself on the ground, and then started giggling. Then she said, \u201cSeventh Senior Brother, you\u2019re not ashamed? You stick to Sixth Senior Sister all day. Even after cultivating together for so many years, you haven\u2019t gotten a child!\u201cYou\u2019re all getting into pairs one by one. Am I destined to be alone just because I\u2019m ninth? Hmph, once I become a Heaven Immortal, I\u2019m going to find a few beautiful men to serve and massage me every day\u2026\u201cLittle Changshou\u2026 don\u2019t you ever, ever, ever look down on your Master. Your Master was so formidable back then\u2026\u201dSlowly, Jiu Jiu began to snore. She hugged her futon and lay down on the ground, fast asleep.Lan Ling\u2019e asked curiously, \u201cSenior Brother, what is this?\u201d\u201cDrunken Immortal,\u201d replied Li Changshou using voice transmission. \u201cNot only is this meant to be an incapacitating agent, but it is also a good wine. However, it does not contain any alcohol. Apart from making one drunk, it has no other effect. I eliminated this at first.\u201cAccording to the ancient texts, long ago, immortals who loved drinking all tried this immortal brew. However, they became extremely addicted to alcohol and downed these in one go.\u201cThese are made in the same way that wine is made. However, while immortal fruits and grains are used for making wine, 32 types of herbs are used to make Drunken Immortal.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e asked worriedly, \u201cCan you really make three types of these?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and nodded. He glanced at Jiu Jiu, who was in deep sleep, and thought about the Pill Chamber that he would obtain soon. Then, he sent another voice transmission to Lan Ling\u2019e. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about three types, I can even make 13 types. If I have the help of a Perfected Immortal, a lot of things that I previously thought would be impossible would now be attainable. Once the Pill Chamber is complete, it would be safer and more secure.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d replied Lan Ling\u2019e, pouting. As she looked at her martial aunt, who looked exceptionally loveable while she was sleeping, Lan Ling\u2019e could not help but feel threatened.Thus, two years later\u2026\u2026Clang!Someone kicked open the wooden door of Li Changshou\u2019s straw hut. Jiu Jiu, dressed in a hemp garment, rushed into the house agitatedly.\u201cQuick! This month\u2019s Drunken Immortal and Beauty\u2019s Charm\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re not in?\u201cAiya, why are you refining pills again?! I should just tie you to the medicine furnace!\u201dJiu Jiu stomped her foot and cursed under her breath. Then, she hurriedly turned around and jumped into the air, wanting to head towards the dense forest behind the straw hut.Yet, she suddenly stopped herself. She tilted her head and stared at the deep forest in front of her, as she felt the faint movement of spiritual energy. Black lines appeared on her forehead as memories of being pathetically trapped inside more than ten times over the past six months surfaced in her mind.If she did not already know what lay in front of her, she would not have been able to tell that there were more than 28 bright arrays and 76 dark arrays inside. In addition, there were trapping arrays and mazes, which were all linked!\u201cWhere is the Life Gate? Did I really help to build this place?\u201cIs it here? That doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201cIs it here?\u201cAhya! These array formations are so irritating!\u201cLi Changshou, get out here! Otherwise, I\u2019ll tear your entire house down!\u201dA gentle breeze blew past the forest. Several trees swayed, as the flow of spiritual energy in the forest sped up.Li Changshou\u2019s hoarse voice could be heard in the wind. \u201cThe array formation has been undone. Your disciple is looking after the furnace. It\u2019s not convenient for me to come out and welcome you.\u201dJiu Jiu blinked and carefully advanced 100 feet. Once she made sure she was safe, Jiu Jiu charged towards the center of the forest furiously.There, a small, elegant structure stood quietly. Clear air drifted out of it, carrying a fresh fragrance throughout the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe structure was 100 feet tall and divided into two levels. From afar, it looked like a wine gourd. The chief designer, Li Changshou, probably had inspiration from the Dharma treasure that Jiu Jiu constantly carried with her\u2014the Evil-Vanquishing Ruyi Sword.That was the wine gourd that could expand and minimize, and carry people into the air.The structure stood inside a pond. 800 feet in front of the door was a well. Water from the well and the pond mixed.If one looked down at the structure from the sky, they would see a Yin-Yang diagram embedded in the forest, measuring about 1,000 feet in diameter. The pond was in the shape of the Yin and Yang fish, while the structure and the well formed the eyes of the fish.This was a Feng Shui array formation, which could attract good luck and avert evil. What\u2019s more, since the Immortal Du Sect belonged to the Ren School, the Yin-Yang diagram held a significant place.If one looked up in front of the structure, they would be able to see a wooden sign. On it was written \u2018Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Pill Chamber\u2019.If one looked closer, they would find two lines of words underneath: \u2018Permitted by the Bai Fan Hall to build small infrastructure for refining pills.\u2019Simply put, this was a licensed building!Walking through the main door, the first thing one would see would be a wooden screen. Behind the screen was a huge pill furnace which stood about 60 feet tall.This pill furnace took up a lot of space. Its base was broad, and it narrowed at the top. Made out of huge slabs of violet gold, it was engraved with magic clouds and leaves and came with many restrictions.The only catch was that there were large quantities of \u2018patches\u2019 in the pill furnace\u2019s upper parts. This made it look quite unpresentable.Someone had thrown this pill furnace away. However, only the top half of the pill furnace had been destroyed by the explosion. Li Changshou had made use of his network in the Bai Fan Hall to obtain this pill furnace. Then, he had taken another six months to repair it. Finally, he managed to activate it.The pill furnace had three legs, two ears, and a full, round belly. There were \u2018windows\u2019 on each of the four sides of the furnace, which were shaped like Yin-Yang fish. The fire-congealing array and spirit-equalizing array underneath the furnace were working well.After Li Changshou repaired the furnace, it recovered 70% of its original efficiency and power.What was rarer was that Li Changshou did not have to pay a single cent in order to obtain this furnace.The violet gold could suppress huge amounts of the medicinal properties of spirit herbs. One could say that this furnace was the most valuable thing on the Little Qiong Peak now.The entire structure was built around this pill furnace.There were several shelves around the furnace. On the shelves were jade bottles, wine gourds, and jade boxes of all sizes. There were also several spirit pills and herbs that were produced by this pill furnace. However, these were quite common pills and herbs.The place was kept neat and tidy by Lan Ling\u2019e. This junior sister was currently cultivating in seclusion as she was trying hard to improve her cultivation level.When Jiu Jiu jumped into the Pill Chamber from outside, she saw Li Changshou standing beside the pill furnace, dressed in a light-blue robe. He held more than ten pale-gold pills in his palm. It looked like he was trying to improve his comprehension of alchemy.\u201cLittle Changshou, what new pill did you create this time?\u201d Jiu Jiu walked over curiously.\u201cAunt-Master, do you want to try it? I just produced pills to clear your heart and focus your mind. I altered the flavor slightly. I think it would be quite effective,\u201d said Li Changshou casually.He slowly handed two spirit pills to Jiu Jiu, who popped them directly into her mouth. She chewed them for a while and then swallowed them. Soon after, she belched, emitting a clear fragrance.\u201cVery sweet!\u201d Jiu Jiu held out her right hand and said, \u201cGive me a few more!\u201dLi Changshou took a white-jade bottle and filled it with pills. Then, he handed the bottle over to Jiu Jiu.Jiu Jiu did not retract her hand. Instead, she said, \u201cThis month\u2019s Drunken Immortal and Beauty\u2019s Charm!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t forget Aunt-Master\u2019s share.\u201dLi Changshou gave her a small smile, before handing her two palm-sized jade pots obediently.Unable to wait any longer, Jiu Jiu opened the pot and sucked in a deep breath. Finally, she sighed satisfactorily.\u201cGood. Changshou, your ability to refine pills and make wine are advancing at the same time. Do you need my help today? You have not been building any more array formations these two months. I can\u2019t possibly take all of these for nothing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need your help today,\u201d replied Li Changshou, smiling. \u201cIn 20 days, I want to activate the pill furnace and refine a more difficult immortal pill. I hope that Aunt-Master will be able to assist me then.\u201dJiu Jiu patted her chest joyfully, causing her hemp garment to sway. \u201cNo problem! Count on me! 20 days, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, 20 days,\u201d replied Li Changshou with a serious expression. \u201cRefining this pill is extremely important to me. What\u2019s more, the moment I start the process, I cannot stop. If Aunt-Master cannot spare the time, please inform your disciple. Apart from this, I wonder if Aunt-Master can keep this matter a secret for me.\u201d\u201cWhat pill is that? Why are you so secretive?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a poisonous Immortal-Melting Pill.\u201dJiu Jiu jumped. \u201cThe Immortal-Melting Pill? Isn\u2019t it said that this thing could kill even Perfected Immortals? I think I heard Fifth Senior Brother talking about this a long time ago. What do you want to produce this for?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and answered, \u201cPoison is a type of medicine. It\u2019s just like dishes with different flavors\u2014sweet, salty, and spicy. Poisonous pills can be used to kill or save people. Don\u2019t worry, Aunt-Master. Your disciple does not have any enemies. I love leading the life of a cultivator. I would not do anything to harm others. If I can successfully produce the Immortal-Melting Pill, I will give you a year\u2019s worth of Beauty\u2019s Charm as thanks. This is on top of the amount that we agreed upon earlier.\u201d\u201cDeal!\u201dJiu Jiu\u2019s stretched out her right hand and clenched her fist in front of Li Changshou\u2019s face. Li Changshou imitated her and touched his fist to hers. Immediately, Jiu Jiu grinned.\u201cI will come back in 20 days.\u201d\u201cTake care, Aunt-Master.\u201dStill laughing, Jiu Jiu mounted her wine gourd and flew up into the air, above Little Qiong Peak.When she looked back, Jiu Jiu saw thin fog rising out of the forest she just left. In the blink of an eye, the fog covered the entire forest. However, after a gentle breeze, the fog disappeared.The forest within a 15-kilometer radius looked exactly the same as before, but Jiu Jiu knew that the huge array within had already been activated.\u201cIf I want to prank Number Seven and Number Eight in the future, I can trick them into coming here,\u201d Jiu Jiu mumbled under her breath.However, soon afterward, Li Changshou\u2019s serious expression surfaced in her mind once more. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell this fellow in advance. Otherwise, I will have to endure his fervent lectures again.\u201dShaking her head, Jiu Jiu steered her wine gourd higher into the air. Soon, she arrived at the back mountain of the Heaven-Breaking Peak. She flew through several overlapping arrays and disappeared into thin air.This was where Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s eight or nine disciples secluded themselves to cultivate. A building had been built among the mountain.The \u2018Nine Jiu Immortals\u2019 was only one of the lines in the Heaven-Breaking Peak. However, the one with the lowest cultivation and who had entered the peak the latest among them was Jiu Jiu, who was already a Perfected Immortal. Naturally, the treatment she got was vastly different from Qi Yuan and his disciples.Not only was there an excellent spirit-gathering array there, but there were also many disciples who were in charge of odd jobs. On top of these, protective arrays, which were restricted by the sect, had been set up around various buildings. One could say that this was an ideal place for cultivators to live.Jiu Jiu was the youngest and was naturally pampered and loved by her senior brothers and sisters. Her accommodation was close to Jiu Wu\u2019s and was in an ideal spot to be protected by her other senior brothers and sisters as well.If Jiu Jiu went into seclusion, the others would surely guard her house vigilantly.Under the watchful eyes of several handymen, Jiu Jiu flew back into her building, kicked off her cloth shoes, and jumped barefoot into her bed, which was carved out from jasper. She hugged the two jade pots, which she just brought back with her, and then began to giggle.\u201cShould I drink you or you first this time? Little Shoushou is not bad. He could think of making such things. Three years are about to go by. The \u2018Ganges River\u2019s Dry Wine\u2019 that he buried the last time is going to emerge soon. Then, I will drink to my heart\u2019s content! Slurp! I will enjoy some Beauty\u2019s Charm today.\u201d\u201cCough! Cough, cough!\u201dOutside the building, a short, five-foot-tall Daoist coughed. Jiu Jiu, who had been lying down on her bed, covered both jade pots and looked outside cautiously. When she saw who it was, she heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cFifth Senior Brother, just come in. I didn\u2019t even activate any arrays.\u201d\u201cI was just reprimanded by Big Senior Sister before. We might be close, but I must not forget my manners,\u201d answered Jiu Wu as he laughed. He took two steps forward and paused again.There was no space for him to advance.He surveyed the wine jars, blouses, and undergarments scattered around the floor. Finally, Jiu Wu smacked his forehead and said, \u201cLittle Jiu, you\u2019re already 1,800 years old. Why can\u2019t you tidy up your own house?\u201dJiu Jiu sniffed and waved her hand, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no weird smell anyway. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201dShe casually put her jade pots into her storage Dharma treasures, and then sat cross-legged on her bed.With much difficulty, Jiu Wu opened a path in the mess on the ground. Then, he sat beside the short table and spoke in a low voice. \u201cJiu Jiu, you\u2019ve been going to the Little Qiong Peak very often recently.\u201d Jiu Wu laughed. \u201cWhat do you do there?\u201d\u201cI play. What else can I do there?\u201d Jiu Jiu blinked. \u201cFifth Senior Brother, why are you suddenly asking me this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Jiu Wu waved his hand and then scratched his head. He thought about the tasks his various senior and junior sisters gave him. All of a sudden, he did not know what to say.\u2018How should I put this? I can\u2019t possibly ask my Junior Sister if she has fallen in love with someone in the Little Qiong Peak, can I?\u2019Jiu Wu regained his composure. \u201cCough! I remember the first tens of years after you joined the sect. You were quite close to that Junior Brother Qi Yuan.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d replied Jiu Jiu, nodding. \u201cBack then, Senior Brother Qi Yuan took very good care of me.\u201dJiu Wu hesitated. \u201cThen are\u2026 you\u2026?\u201dJiu Jiu frowned. \u201cFifth Senior Brother, what\u2019s the matter with you today? Why are you stuttering?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Ai!\u201dJiu Wu stomped his foot and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be straightforward! Little Jiu, you\u2019ve been heading to the Little Qiong Peak every day during this period. Even though you\u2019re on an alcohol ban, you look extremely energetic! Your Senior Sisters were wondering if you\u2026 er, if you were\u2026\u201d\u201cWere what?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Jiu Jiu frowned, her eyes filled with confusion.Jiu Wu\u2019s voice became sharp as his heart raced. He sucked in a deep breath and spat, \u201cAre you?! Going to break through\u2014\u201d\u201cIs it so easy to break through?\u201d Jiu Jiu rolled her eyes. \u201cTell my Senior Sisters not to worry. If I hit a bottleneck, I will ask you about it. I will not be hard-headed and try to force my way through.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll go back then. Continue cultivating.\u201dJiu Wu quickly excused himself as he stood up and walked to the door. At the door, he turned around again and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right Little Jiu. The spider that you brought back from the Little Qiong Peak the last time is dead. Ask Martial Nephew Changshou if he has any more. I\u2019ll use my treasured pills to trade.\u201d\u201cAlright, I got it. I\u2019ll ask him for you the next time I go there.\u201dJiu Wu smiled subtly.\u2018Gee, since Jiu Jiu brought back the Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spider the last time, I obtained spiderwebs, which would help me see things from a distance. Life has become much more interesting since. Especially when I place the webs in the waterhole where my Dao companion often bathes in. The scene is\u2026\u2019\u201cCough, cough.\u201d Jiu Wu lowered his head and walked away quickly.\u2018Fifth Senior Brother is acting so strangely today. Forget it. Maybe he quarreled with Fourth Senior Sister.\u2019Jiu Jiu shook her head and activated the array outside her building. Then, she lay down on her mattress and retrieved her two jade pots. Once again, she tried to resolve her beautiful dilemma.\u2026At the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Pill Chamber\u2026Li Changshou stood in front of the pill furnace. The ingredients he required for the pills had already been prepared. He turned towards the futon on the left.He held a jade token in his left hand as he tried to sense the changes happening in various parts of the huge array. Once he confirmed for the third time that there were no dangers, he activated the pill furnace\u2019s restrictions. Flames immediately appeared inside.Li Changshou sat down on the futon on the left. However, just as he was sitting down, a plume of green smoke exploded beside him. His figure disappeared, leaving behind a paper doll.In the blink of an eye, the paper doll took on Li Changshou\u2019s form. The green smoke quickly entered his nostrils and disappeared.Illusive techniques were the old Daoist priest Qi Yuan\u2019s forte. Naturally, his older disciple had mastered it a long time ago.In fact, the number of things Li Changshou now knew how to create illusions of was many times that of his master\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu is\u2026 perfect.\u2019Li Changshou had turned into green smoke. As he twisted and turned through narrow gaps, and charged downwards at top speed, he passed by array formation after array formation. Each one made Li Changshou feel a deep sense of satisfaction.Why did he say Aunt-Master was perfect?Jiu Jiu knew very little about array formations. She was a Perfected Immortal and was approaching the Heaven Immortal Realm. Her foundations were sturdy, and her immortal powers were pure. She also had unexpectedly strong control over her own immortal powers.Most importantly, she could follow the directions of the younger generation!Perhaps calling them \u2018directions\u2019 would be overboard. Li Changshou admitted that there was an element of trickery. However, one was willing to beat, and the other was willing to endure beatings. Both were willing parties\u2014it was beautiful.\u2018Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu helped me out a lot this time. I have to thank the elders in the Punishment Hall for punishing Aunt-Master Jiu in this manner. I also have to thank Uncle-Master Jiu Wu for throwing Aunt-Master Jiu into a wine vat to be bathed when she was young. I also have to thank myself, for finding those few pieces of torn sheepskin in the bookshelf at the corner of the Dao Sutra Outer Hall. That was how I successfully \u2018tested\u2019 incapacitating agents used in battles like the Drunken Immortal and Soft Immortal Disperser\u2026\u2019The green smoke descended about 1,000 feet before stopping in the middle of a narrow gap between two rocks. Li Changshou then transformed into a human again.In his hands, he held a jade token, which could control the array formation. His fingers rubbed the surface several times, causing the diagram on the jade token to change slightly.At the same time, ripples appeared in the rocks in front of him like water. Li Changshou walked into the rock, and then the rock reverted to its original state.Uninhibited, Li Changshou took a few steps into the big rock. A small wooden door appeared in front of him. He pushed it open and walked into a secret room, which measured 30 feet per side.He took out the array-controlling jade token and turned it around in his palm. Once again, the array formation outside changed slightly. The secret underground room immediately disappeared in the various gaps around the array formation.Even Heaven Immortals, who were intentionally looking for this room, would not be able to find out its location from any direction unless they destroyed the array formation outside.This was Li Changshou\u2019s main objective in building this Pill Chamber.\u2018Men need their secret spaces.\u2019There were two bookshelves in the secret room, filled with old, ancient texts.Li Changshou sat behind the desk and retrieved tens of sheepskin. He studied them closely and then took out the jade token again. After closing his eyes, a complex, three-dimensional structure surfaced in his mind.This three-dimensional structure looked like a building in a city that he often saw in his previous life. However, this \u2018building\u2019 was embedded inside the Little Qiong Peak.Li Changshou breathed out slowly.\u2018It\u2019s been a long time since I last felt so hidden and safe\u2026\u2019\u201cAh.\u201d Li Changshou sighed as a smile spread across his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to bathe here. What a joke. I cannot relax, even for a second. I have to keep checking the different parts of this huge array formation.\u201dIt was a good thing that Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu was of such a high cultivation level. That was the only reason he could turn his dreams into reality\u2014a huge, three-dimensional, complex group of arrays!Li Changshou had carefully pieced together the puzzle through Jiu Jiu\u2019s hands, based on the design and ideals he had for this array formation.Based on Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu\u2019s understanding, she had helped Li Changshou put together more than 100 medium and small-sized array formations. Moreover, these array formations overlapped to form a natural-like array formation, which covered the environment within a 30-kilometer radius of the Pill Chamber.The combined effort of Li Changshou and Jiu Jiu produced this huge array. This huge array\u2014a Perfected Immortal\u2019s handiwork\u2014could not be broken even by Heaven Immortals.Perhaps only Heaven Immortals with a deep understanding of array formations would be able to break it.However, Jiu Jiu only knew of this first step. She did not know of the second, third, and fourth steps.The foundation of the main array formations was made out of precious ingredients, spirit stones, and specially-refined treasures. Since the foundations were all interconnected, the Heaven and Earth powers were activated. That allowed the huge array to have multiple different effects.The Array Formation Dao was vast and deep. Li Changshou knew that he had not yet learned enough about array formations to be called an expert.He had to have a realistic and clear view of his own understanding and skills.However, he could not help his bold and unconstrained imagination. What\u2019s more, he could repeatedly expound on these imaginations to make his dreams become a reality, step by step.About 60 to 70 years ago, when Li Changshou\u2019s had been enjoying a break from cultivating, he had studied the array formations set up around the Immortal Du Sect. By chance, he had discovered that the foundations of common array formations in Primordial Times were mostly laid on a horizontal plane.At the time, he thought, \u2018What if they could be laid on a vertical plane? The effect should be the same.\u2019Take the spherical mountain-protecting array formation, for example. If its foundation were laid vertically, the half-sphere would be able to rotate 90-degrees.Of course, most mountain-protecting array formations needed to make use of power from the earth meridians. It was not possible to lay their foundations vertically.However, protective array formations aside, mazes, trapping array formations, and killing array formations could rotate freely.\u2018On this basis, what would happen if I lay the array foundations on an oblique plane? What would happen if I laid the foundations of several array formations in a criss-cross fashion? For example, between two array formations, one could be laid horizontally and the other vertically. They would share 1/3 of their foundations. When I activate the horizontal array, the vertical one will be deactivated, and vice versa. That would create an \u2018interference-free switching array\u2019!\u2019Li Changshou had slowly fumbled his way and eventually figured out how to allow spiritual power to flow through the array formation. He had also resolved problems with applying the theory to various array formations\u2019 foundations.All his work had culminated to this day.Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Pill Chamber\u2019s huge, three-dimensional, complex array formation was the successful realization of Li Changshou\u2019s theory!If one divided up the huge arrays on the horizontal plane, they would find three layers.Jiu Jiu only knew about the top layer\u2014the array formation surrounding the Pill Chamber. This contained more than 100 trapping arrays and mazes.The layer was about 1,000 feet deep into the mountain. There were also a middle layer and a bottom layer underneath. Jiu Jiu also helped with burying the foundations of the huge, core arrays in the middle and bottom layers.However, this was only the situation when the arrays in this area were activated in the horizontal plane.These array foundations also had several hidden programs laid vertically and obliquely. Among them were many killing array formations.At that moment, the secret room, which Li Changshou was in, was the center of all the array formations.The secret room would only appear in this rock when all the vertical core array formations had been activated, and all the horizontal ones were reversed.There was no need to fear even great masters of Earth Escape. Without the jade token in Li Changshou\u2019s hand and his special controlling hand techniques, one would have to break the Little Qiong Peak into pieces in order to find this secret room.If the day came where the Little Qiong Peak had to be broken apart, even the Immortal Du Sect might perish. Before then, there would be a 99% chance that Li Changshou would already be\u2026\u2018Cough, there\u2019s no meaning in living and perishing with the sect. It is more righteous to remain alive in order to take revenge for my fellow masters and disciples!\u2019On a side note, the arrays on the bottom layer were meant to absorb the earth meridians\u2019 energy.In order to avoid absorbing too much power from earth and spirit meridians, which would attract the attention of other cultivators or seniors in the sect, Li Changshou had to avoid all the spirit meridians. Instead, he chose to absorb \u2018turbid\u2019 power, which the earth had the most of, and then use the cleaning array left behind by the mage race to filter the power.Although this would slightly impact the power of the killing arrays, it was the most appropriate solution.What\u2019s more, even if experts in the sect noticed the group of arrays on the Little Qiong Peak, as long as he did not activate the vertical and oblique planes, they would only see trapping arrays and mazes. They could not blame him for breaking the sect\u2019s rules.Before this, he had been using mediocrity as his disguise. This was known as \u2018passively camouflaging\u2019.Now, however, he was forced to do more since he needed a Pill Chamber to refine pills. He had to take \u2018active disguise\u2019 to the extreme. As for the direction he would take in the future, Li Changshou had already thought about it.He would take all the array formations\u2019 foundations under the Pill Chamber as his base. From there, he would slowly expand outwards. Little Qiong Peak would become a fortress in the sect, which no one would notice.He had only one life, and the Primordial Times were way too exciting.\u2018For cultivators in my generation, seeking longevity and the Great Dao should come first. It would not be too late to appreciate the Trichiliocosm\u2019s beautiful views after that.\u2019\u201cFinally,\u201d said Li Changshou as he rubbed his hands together. He kept his sheepskin and jade token and retrieved several storage sacks. Then, he poured out several storage Dharma treasures from within.After two years, he could finally take stock of the surprise rewards he had reaped from his expedition to the North Continent.\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll see how poor that Immortal Yuwen Ling was.\u201dLi Changshou chuckled as he took out two paper dolls and turned them into his clones. The clones lifted up two storage Dharma treasures, took one corner of the room, and began to melt them.Half a day later, the paper doll manning the furnace almost ran out of power. Li Changshou kept his rewards, got to his feet, and left the secret room.He held an embroidered case in his hand. Inside the case were two sleeping \u2018beetles\u2019.If he was not wrong, these should be\u2014Love Parasites!\u201cGood stuff,\u201d exclaimed Li Changshou. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity I have no use for them now. I\u2019ll keep them first. In the future, if the immortal and spirit beasts I rear do not show signs of reproducing, I can use this to push them. That would increase their reproduction rate and save these rare breeds.\u201d\u2026Time flew by. It was now the day that Jiu Jiu had agreed to help Li Changshou with refining the pills.Jiu Jiu yawned as she put on a hemp garment that one of her senior sisters had washed for her. Sleepily, she mounted her wine gourd and headed towards the Little Qiong Peak.As one of the main Perfected Immortals in the sect, Jiu Jiu had many powerful figures behind her. Thus, she flew without many restrictions. She could go wherever she wanted to go, except for the prohibited areas.\u201cIs today the 20th day?\u201dJiu Jiu squeezed her fingers together and counted. Immediately, she felt confused.Before this, she had tried the Drunken Immortal \u2018concentrate\u2019 because she had been seeking excitement. In the end, she had slept for five or six days straight.As she rushed along, she neglected to expand her immortal awareness. Thus, she failed to notice the floating cloud in the forest beneath her.Once Jiu Jiu arrived at the Little Qiong Peak, two heads popped out of the cloud. The one on the left was the short Daoist, Jiu Wu. The one on the right looked like a teenage girl, no more than 16 or 17 years old.Although she looked like a teenage girl, with beautiful features and full curves, she was filled with youthful energy. Both of them were about the same age\u2014more than 2,000 years old.The teenage girl\u2019s Dao name was Jiu Shi, and she was the fourth disciple of Exalted Wang Qing. She was also Jiu Wu\u2019s Dao companion and the girl whom Jiu Wu often used the Strong-Pupil Three-Headed Spider\u2019s web to spy on.Jiu Wu said in a low voice, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right for us to do this. This is the Little Qiong Peak after all.\u201dThe teenage girl retorted irritatedly, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? If they\u2019re unhappy with us, we\u2019ll just have to fight the Peak Leader of this peak!\u201d Then, she narrowed her apricot eyes and said, \u201cShe came here the moment she woke up. There must be something wrong. When have you seen Little Jiu this hardworking? I want to see whether this Junior Brother Qi Yuan has grown three heads or six arms. How can he attract our Little Jiu here every day even before ascending to immortality?\u201dJiu Wu smiled bitterly as he raised his short, thick eyebrows. \u201cThere are array formations here? I can\u2019t sense Little Jiu\u2019s aura anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat array formation do we have to fear? Haven\u2019t we all learned these?\u201d Jiu Wu pursed her lips and grabbed Jiu Wu\u2019s collar. Without another word, they hid their figures and auras and turned into two shadows, which flew towards the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s forest.\u201cWe are both halfway to the Heaven Immortal Realm. Must we fear array formations set up by someone who hasn\u2019t even ascended to immortality?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Senior Sister! My dear wife! It\u2019s not appropriate for us to go in stealthily. Why not approach them openly? We can directly ask them anything that we want to, can\u2019t we?\u201dIn the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s forest, two shadows suddenly came to a halt. Two figures appeared, one tall and one short. The two of them continued to use their hidden immortal senses to survey the sorcery around them.Jiu Wu stood in front of his Dao companion, who stood taller than him. He tried to persuade her earnestly. \u201cLittle Jiu has grown up. We cannot always remain by her side. No matter what, she is an immortal, who is 962 years and six months old. She is not a kid anymore!\u201dJiu Shi, who had just been stopped by her Dao companion, rolled her eyes and tutted. \u201cWhat can we ask if we approach them openly? Obviously, we have to be stealthy in order to find out the truth about things like that! Have you forgotten how we found out about Little Six and Little Seven? If we had not caught them on the mattress, they would never have admitted it! Quickly, hide! Don\u2019t reveal your steps!\u201dJiu Shi stomped her foot and grabbed Jiu Wu\u2019s collar again. Then, she lifted him up.The two of them turned into shadows and disappeared further into the forest.Jiu Wu could not help but laugh bitterly. He could brag about being resourceful and intelligent in front of others, but in front of the woman he loved, he could not do anything.Still, after traveling less than 1,000 feet, they had no choice but to stop again.Both of their figures appeared on top of a huge tree. They began to survey the situation in front of them.\u201cThis array formation is quite exquisitely made,\u201d praised Jiu Wu. \u201cThe boundaries of the array formation seem to blend into the surroundings. They\u2019re just rough around the edges, revealing a bit of their spiritual power.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Jiu Shi tilted her head, causing her two pigtails to sway.She took a closer look and nonchalantly said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a Bewildering and Confusing Array Formation. Can\u2019t you and I handle it? Let\u2019s go into the array. Look at your expression. Are you unwilling? Do you still want to sleep on the bed tonight?\u201dUpon coming face to face with this threat, Jiu Wu immediately admitted defeat. \u201cYes, yes, of course, I do. It\u2019s rare for Shi Shi to be out of seclusion\u2026\u201cForget it! I\u2019ll go in front. If anything happens, I\u2019ll be responsible.\u201dJiu Wu sighed as he succumbed to Jiu Shi\u2019s \u2018tyrannical abuse\u2019. He jumped down from the top of the tree and clasped his hands behind his back as he advanced. He scanned his surroundings as his mind wandered.Jiu Wu was not thinking about whether he could undo the array formation. Actually, he did not think much about the Little Qiong Peak at all. After all, there were no immortals in the Little Qiong Peak. How powerful could their arrays be?Instead, what he was thinking about was what it would be like if they really bumped into Little Jiu and Junior Brother Qi Yuan. It would be extremely awkward for sure.Especially\u2026\u2018There\u2019s an 80% chance that Junior Brother Qi Yuan will not be able to make it through the Heavenly Tribulation. Is our Junior sister going to be made a widow shortly after finding a Dao companion for herself? What should we do about this?\u2019\u201cPick up the pace!\u201d Jiu Shi, who was behind Jiu Wu, rushed him. \u201cIf you keep dilly-dallying like that, we won\u2019t be able to see anything when we arrive!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t rush. I\u2019m going to find the exit of this array formation.\u201dJiu Wu quickly predicted where the Life Gate of that array formation was located. Thus, he led Jiu Shi out of the very first maze.Yet, Jiu Wu quickly stopped again. He raised his left hand, gesturing for Jiu Shi to stop walking.\u201cEh? A chain array formation?\u201dJiu Wu rejoiced in his heart. Rubbing his chin, he sighed and said, \u201cAlthough they are simple array formations placed one after another, the fact that this person could form a chain out of them shows that he is quite smart and artistic.\u201d\u201cLong-winded!\u201d Jiu Shi tutted and then moved two steps in front of her junior brother.She expanded her immortal awareness and quickly searched for the exit of the array formation. Curtly, she said, \u201cFollow me.\u201dJiu Wu smiled helplessly and followed behind his Dao companion and senior sister. In his heart, he wondered what he would do if the situation turned into a mess later.At the same time, in the Pill Chamber more than five kilometers away\u2026Li Changshou, who was tidying up the herbs and medicine, frowned. His expression unchanging, he turned to look at Jiu Jiu, who was meditating. He began to ponder but said nothing.\u2018The person beside Uncle-Master Jiu Wu should be one of the Nine Jiu Immortals, too. That\u2019s just as well. Both of them can help me test out the effectiveness of the arrays on the bottom later.\u2019\u201cAunt-Master Jiu?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here. Are we starting?\u201d\u201cWe have to wait a while more,\u201d replied Li Changshou, smiling. \u201cWhen you get back to the Heaven-Breaking Peak, if someone asks Aunt-Master Jiu what you\u2019ve been doing here, you can just tell them the truth. However, it\u2019ll be best if you could keep the arrangement and quantity of the array formations here a secret for your disciple.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I understand all these principles!\u201dJiu Jiu patted her chest hard.\u201cYour Aunt-Master is not the kind who forgets herself after obtaining benefits. On account of the fact that you\u2019ve given me so much Beauty\u2019s Charm, I promise to keep my lips sealed!\u201dLi Changshou gave her a small smile and continued to weigh the various herbs and ingredients.Finally, he could start refining the Immortal-Melting Pill.However, he could only begin after the two Perfected Immortals outside left.In the forest\u2026An hour had passed since the two elder Perfected Immortals of the Nine Jiu Immortals had entered the array formation.\u201cYou solve this array,\u201d mumbled Jiu Shi. \u201cI am mainly trained in refining weapons. I can\u2019t beat you and Third Senior Brother when it comes to array formations.\u201dJiu Wu smiled subtly and kept his hands behind his back as he walked past his Dao companion. His short figure emitted manliness and pride!\u201cFollow me closely. This array formation is called the Quick Revolving Array Formation. It\u2019s still quite a basic maze, but the Life Gate is in a strange position. It\u2019s located at the top.\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Jiu Wu located the array\u2019s exit. He led Jiu Shi and jumped out of the array formation, into the next. Then, everything around them began to rotate at once.Another hour later\u2026\u201cThis is strange. I think we made one full circle to return to our starting point.\u201d Jiu Wu\u2019s expression turned somber as he squeezed his fingers to analyze the situation. \u201cWe just passed through 24 array formations, which were linked together. Yet, these small array formations seem to form a huge, concealed array. We were led right back to our starting point as we followed the directions of the Life Gates. The creator got the best results with the least expense by setting up the array formations in this manner. I can\u2019t say that he\u2019s an expert, but this is very interesting. Hmm, it is very interesting, indeed.\u201dJiu Shi smacked her forehead and scolded, \u201cResolve this! How long has it been?! According to your timing each time, you would have gotten us through three or four array formations by now!\u201dJiu Wu cleared his throat. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s time for me to get serious. Follow me!\u201dAt once, he pulled his Dao companion and walked briskly into the maze. Both of them quickly disappeared into the forest.Two hours later\u2026\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense. This shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201dJiu Wu set cross-legged on the ground, on top of a pile of leaves. He squeezed the fingers of both of his hands, analyzing the situation.Jiu Shi rubbed her clean, smooth, beautiful chin as she paced back and forth. She kept chanting the incantations for array formations that she knew, but they were of no use at that moment.Their current problem was not finding Jiu Jiu in this huge array.Instead, the main problem was that they were already\u2014completely lost in this chain array!No matter which direction they traveled, even up or down, they would find themselves in another maze!They kept coming back full circle. No matter how hard they tried, they could not find the exit!Jiu Shi said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we blow this array formation up?\u201d\u201cWe cannot. Did we come here to catch people or to blow up the mountain?\u201d Jiu Wu smiled bitterly. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, if word gets out that we got stuck in an array formation on the Little Qiong Peak, where there are no immortals, how can we show our faces in public again?\u201dJiu Shi complained, \u201cAren\u2019t you an expert in array formations?\u201d\u201cThese are basic array formations indeed, but there is no set way to break out of chain arrays. We can only grind our way out slowly, or look for a tear between arrays. However, the person who set up these arrays covered up these tears perfectly.\u201dJiu Wu smacked his forehead and said, \u201cCome, I\u2019ve found a way to get out of this array formation. Let\u2019s try again!\u201dThus, another two hours later\u2026Crash!Five feet above the ground, a flat forehead kept knocking itself against the trunk of a huge tree.The short Daoist\u2019s eyes were hollow and caved in. His normally bright and alert gaze was now dim and lifeless. Leaves and branches clung to his brown robe. The aura in his body was a mess.He knocked his forehead into the tree trunk again as he laughed mirthlessly. Then, he mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s fake. The comprehension of array formations that I had was all fake\u2026 Even basic array formations can form such a high-level maze and trapping array when grouped together. It looks like I\u2019ve been on the wrong path all these years\u2026 Have I been on the wrong Dao all this time, too? My Inaction Sutra is wrong as well, right? Hehe\u2026 After all, I\u2019m just an average Perfected Immortal. Hehe\u2026\u201dJiu Shi stood by the side, at a complete loss as to what to do. She quickly got down on one knee and hugged her Dao companion.\u201cJunior Brother, don\u2019t scare me like that. We can just blow up this array formation.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that. How can the person that created such an array not have been prepared for someone to try and blow it up? For all we know, it might turn into a killing array immediately\u2026 Senior Sister?\u201dJiu Wu\u2019s lips trembled as he looked up at the movingly beautiful immortal. He smiled, distressed.\u201cIt turns out that I\u2019m not good enough for you.\u201dJiu Shi quickly hugged Jiu Wu even tighter. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that. We have made an oath to the Great Dao that we would not leave each other forever, for better or for worse!\u201d\u201cI am really not good enough\u2026\u201dHu\u2026A gentle breeze blew past. A dense, white fog suddenly appeared in the forest. As quickly as it came, it dissipated.At the same time, both of them heard a conversation not far away.\u201cAunt-Master Jiu, let\u2019s test it out. After this, we will throw these two herbs into the furnace. Then, you can\u2014\u201d\u201cMm, no problem.\u201dJiu Wu and Jiu Shi exchanged a look. The latter immediately used her skills to turn them both into shadows. Then, they escaped towards the sound.Soon, they realized that they had just been a mere 1,000 feet away from Jiu Jiu all along!They hid behind a huge tree and stealthily stretched their necks to look into the Pill Chamber.Since they were going to activate the furnace and refine pills, the windows on both sides of the Pill Chamber were open. From Jiu Wu\u2019s angle, they could see Li Changshou and Jiu Jiu discussing something in front of the furnace.Unknowingly, it was evening. The rays of the setting sun shone through the window and onto Jiu Jiu.Both her hands were clasped behind her back. She was on the toes of her left foot, and her body was leaning forward as she listened to the tall cultivator in front of her describe the steps of pill refinement in detail.In the sunlight, her shoulder-length hair seemed to glow. Her skin looked shiny and moist, and her round, star-like eyes looked clear and translucent.Her long, slender neck and curvy figure made her emit beauty from top to toe.Beside her stood a male cultivator dressed in an azure robe, whose long hair was tied up simply with a Dao hoop.\u2018Eh?\u2019\u201cMartial Nephew Changshou? Could this array have been\u2026\u201d mumbled Jiu Wu, his face a mask of confusion.Before he could finish speaking, a soft hand covered his mouth. Beside him, Jiu Shi giggled and sent a voice transmission. \u201cShh! Let\u2019s go. We can talk when we get back. Let\u2019s not disturb them.\u201dJiu Wu looked confused. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving just like that?\u201d\u201cOtherwise\u2026? He\u2019s quite handsome, this young one. He looks quite reliable, too. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s only in the Void Return Realm\u2026 That\u2019s not really a problem, either.\u201dJiu Shi gave a small smile and held onto Jiu Wu as she activated her Dao technique.Just then, a green leaf left its home on the tree and swayed back and forth as it descended onto Jiu Wu\u2019s head.\u2026\u2018They\u2019re finally gone.\u2019Li Changshou heaved a sigh of relief. Once again, he activated the huge array formation and checked various parts of it multiple times.\u2018That\u2019s good. Nothing was exposed.\u2019The trapping array worked unexpectedly well. What\u2019s more, the message, which the trapping array sent to intruders, matched Li Changshou\u2019s original predictions.\u201cLet\u2019s begin refining the pill.\u201d As he said this, he turned around and walked towards a plain. He retrieved a pouch, which was marked Metaphysics Number Eleven, held it up in front of him, and shook it. A bunch of things fell out and landed on the ground.Dharma robes, which looked like space suits, gloves, which could withstand corrosion by most fatal poisons, poison-resistant talismans, detoxifying spirit pills, corrosion-resistant tweezers and clips, strangely-shaped containers, and so on.With wonder, Jiu Jiu asked, \u201cWhat are these?\u201d\u201cNecessary precautions we must take when refining pills,\u201d answered Li Changshou, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared a set for you, Aunt-Master. We can put them on together. Although Aunt-Master\u2019s immortal powers are rich, poison can seep through even the smallest of openings. It\u2019s best to be careful.\u201d\u201cAlright. Little Martial Nephew, you\u2019re quite considerate for your Aunt-Master.\u201dJiu Jiu blinked as she curiously moved closer to Li Changshou\u2019s side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His five-feet-tall body swayed in front of his own building, as his immortal powers flowed weakly. He no longer felt exhausted.Three days had passed since he and Jiu Shi had returned from the Little Qiong Peak. He just sent his Dao companion into seclusion. In his heart, he began to think about whether he should continue cultivating or walk around the Bai Fan Hall.At that moment, a huge wine gourd landed from above.Jiu Wu immediately perked up and clasped his hands behind his back, looking as serious as he would on any ordinary day. He cleared his throat and shouted, \u201cLittle Jiu! Come to Senior Brother\u2019s for a while.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother? I was going to look for you. I brought you what you wanted\u2026 Ha\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu stuck out her head from the wine gourd. Unable to hold in her yawn, she put her hand over her mouth. Jiu Wu noted that even her body seemed to be slumped over.The wine gourd swayed back and forth and finally landed in front of Jiu Wu\u2019s building.The Nine Jiu Immortals each had great potential. They were also some of the best cultivators of their generation. Apart from Jiu Jiu, each of them had developed their own \u2018side occupation\u2019.Jiu Shi was an expert in refining equipment and treasures, while Jiu Wu was an expert in brewing wine and refining pills. Thus, every corner of the ground floor of Jiu Wu\u2019s building was filled with wine vats, materials for treasure, and pill furnaces.It was obvious that this was the source of Jiu Jiu\u2019s habit of not cleaning up after herself. The only difference was her habit seemed to be more intensified.Jiu Wu yawned again. Treating Jiu Wu\u2019s house like her own, she sat at a round table without invitation and threw a little cage over to Jiu Wu.\u201cSenior Brother, this is the little spider you wanted. Don\u2019t kill it. Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed asking a junior for things all the time?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rare that you didn\u2019t forget,\u201d answered Jiu Wu. He opened the wooden cage and glanced at the black cloth. A grin spread across his face.There was a pair of spiders inside, which were separated from each other. Each of them had three huge heads and many strong pupils.Jiu Jiu yawned once again, looking exhausted. \u201cSenior Brother, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going home.\u201d\u201cWait, let me look for some things.\u201d Jiu Wu jogged to a cool, dark place in his house and hung the cage there. Then, he turned around and jogged to a bookshelf.Jiu Jiu slumped onto the table listlessly. \u201cSenior Brother, what are you doing? I\u2019m very tired now. I want to drink something and sleep for a few days.\u201d\u2018Tired?\u2019Jiu Wu, who had been searching the bookshelf, turned around to study Jiu Jiu. It was only then that he recalled he could not tell his junior sister\u2019s cultivation level just by looking at her now, much less her physical situation.However, when he thought about the scene he witnessed in the Pill Chamber, he immediately sighed in his heart. He felt the sadness of a father.\u2018Forget it, when a girl is of age, she must be married off. Dao companions are prevalent in the sect. My Junior Sister would not be able to escape her fate\u2026\u2018Where did this practice come from?\u2018One had to look at the older generation of Heaven Immortals. Among the ten-odd elders of our Immortal Du Sect, there were four pairs of loving Dao companions. The young follow the examples set by the old. There\u2019s really no one else to blame.\u2019Jiu Jiu sighed in frustration as she lay on the table, thinking about her experience refining pills with a certain martial nephew\u2026Although it was an interesting and curious experience, and her martial nephew gave her many benefits, including poisonous pills that could poison Perfected Immortals, she could not relax the entire time. To her, this was quite exhausting.Jiu Jiu had never felt this tired in her life. Faintly, Jiu Jiu mumbled, \u201cHe is just a kid in the Void Return Realm, yet he was able to torment me for so long. I\u2019m so tired!\u201dCrack!The jade slip in Jiu Wu\u2019s hand slipped out and landed on the floor. The short Daoist raised his hand and heaved a long sigh. His eyes began to well up.\u2018Little Jiu has really\u2026 grown up\u2026\u2019It was finally time for this Fifth Senior Brother, who had played her father for so long, to let her enjoy her life of cultivation.Jiu Wu picked up the jade slip once again and looked at the huge words carved into it.\u2018Overall Principles of Array Formations, by the useless Wang Qing.\u2019Jiu Wu took two more jade slips out from the bookshelf\u2019s corner before walking back towards Jiu Jiu.\u201cLittle Jiu, hand these things to Martial Nephew Changshou on my behalf,\u201d said Jiu Wu warmly as he used his immortal powers to transport the jade slips in front of Jiu Jiu. \u201cThese are outlines of array formations written by Master, as well as the lessons Third Senior Sister and I have learned after studying array formations all these years.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Jiu Jiu picked up the jade slips and then threw them into her storage Dharma treasure. Confused, she asked, \u201cSenior Brother, why are you suddenly so concerned about Little Shoushou?\u201d\u2018Little\u2026 Little Shoushou? Didn\u2019t I only develop a nickname like that for Little Shi Shi when we were flirting?\u2019Jiu Wu raised his head and sucked in a deep breath. Then, with a kind and warm smile on his face, he said gently, \u201cAfter we met in the North Continent the last time, I realized he is quite an earnest young man. That\u2019s right. Your Fourth Senior Sister has also made several new clothes for you.\u201dJiu Wu retrieved a sack and handed it to Jiu Jiu.\u201cHere are some rouge and jewelry for women as well. If you like them, you can ask your Senior Sister to make more for you\u2026\u201d\u201cClothes? What clothes?\u201dJiu Jiu picked up the sack and reached in, pulling out a thin, gauzy dress at random. Immediately, a few black lines appeared on her forehead.\u201cSenior Brother\u2026 since when have I worn something like that?\u201d\u201cCough, don\u2019t blame your Senior Brother for being nosy. Junior Sister, although you are naturally beautiful, you need to dress up once in a while. That\u2019s right, did you and Martial Nephew Changshou\u2026 start two years ago?\u201d\u201cTwo years ago? Start?\u201dJiu Jiu scanned Jiu Wu from head to toe, frowning and pursing her lips. Suddenly, she threw the gauzy dress back into the sack. Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, she asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you think Little Shoushou and I are together!?\u201dJiu Wu paused. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201d Jiu Jiu made a face of disgust. \u201cWhat do you take your Junior Sister for?! Am I the kind who would go after martial nephews?! I can\u2019t bring myself to go after young, tender flesh!\u201dJiu Wu stared at Jiu Jiu. \u201cThen why have you been going to the Little Qiong Peak so often over the last two years?!\u201d\u201cI was helping to set up array formations,\u201d answered Jiu Jiu as she spread out her hands. \u201cI was banned from wine for three years. Martial Nephew gave me good drinks to replace wine. In return, I helped him set up array formations.\u201dJiu Wu\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cJunior Sister, you were the one who set up the array formation on the Little Qiong Peak?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I did it myself!\u201dJiu Jiu raised her eyebrows proudly. However, she quickly explained the situation. \u201cSenior Brother, you know I\u2019m not interested in array formations. Changshou was the one who told me where to place what. Then, when the array formation was coming into shape, I was in charge of suppressing the spiritual energy flow. However, during this period, there was no need for me to set up any more array formations. I could not take the benefits for nothing, could I? These few days, I helped him refine a pill\u2026\u201cSenior Brother?\u201cSenior Brother, what\u2019s the matter? Your expression is so strange.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201dA realization dawned on Jiu Wu. He stood up and paced the room. \u201cThe chain array formation was not set up by someone who had not ascended to immortality. It\u2019s no wonder that only simple mazes and trapping arrays were used! He used his smarts and your hands in order to develop something like that. Amazing\u2026 amazing! This Li Changshou does not have elite-level potential, but he is in the Void Return Realm even though he joined the sect about 100 years ago. That means he is slightly better than average. If one nurtures him, he will have no problem ascending to immortality. He can make something of himself with hard work.\u201dAt the side, Jiu Jiu yawned and stood up quietly. Her head was lowered, her body was bent over, and her arms were hanging by her side as she drifted towards the door.\u201cSenior Brother, I\u2019m going back to rest. Refining pills is so tiring.\u201d\u201cAi, Little Jiu, the three jade slips that I handed to you!\u201d Jiu Wu quickly said, \u201cI think you should give them back to me. These are treasures belonging to our line of succession. We should not hand them out so easily.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just some of the lessons you learned. Why do you have to be so stingy?\u201d Jiu Jiu rolled her eyes and tossed two bottles to Jiu Wu. \u201cI\u2019ll make the decision. I\u2019m using a few poisonous pills that Little Shoushou made in order to obtain these lessons from you. That should do it, right?\u201cThese are poisonous pills that can injure even Perfected Immortals! It was a product of some of my hard work, too.\u201d\u201cThose are not just ordinary lessons\u2014 Poisonous pills!?\u201dJiu Wu caught the bottles and frowned as he studied them.Jiu Wu was already drifting out of Jiu Wu\u2019s building and returning to her own. What\u2019s more, she was activating the huge array outside her building.Jiu Wu could not help but laugh. \u2018There is nothing wrong with Ninth Junior Sister giving him these jade slips. After all, Li Changshou is a disciple of their own sect as well.\u2019Jiu Wu surrounded his body with immortal power and sent the bottles tens of feet away from himself. Then, he opened the bottles from afar. Looking in, he discovered that there were three red pills in each bottle. They were emitting a light fragrance.\u201cThey are Bone- and Mind-Rotting Pills and Soul-Transforming Killing PIlls? They are of good quality as well. Although they are poisonous pills, they are of similar quality as immortal pills. Were these refined using Little Jiu\u2019s powers as well? This Li Changshou is something.\u201dJiu Wu could not help but laugh again. Then, he spotted something else on the bottles. He brought them closer so that he could study the bottles.There were two lines of words on the bottles. Placing the bottles side-by-side, he realized that the sentences flowed.The short Daoist mumbled as he held the bottles up, \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find some peace on the road to immortality; refrain from worldly riches and make a gentlemen\u2019s agreement.\u201d Finally, a small smile appeared on his lips.\u201cThis fella had indeed discovered Shi Shi and I. That was why he intentionally undid the array formation. With these words, he is explaining that there is a working relationship between him and Little Jiu. He\u2019s asking us not to worry.\u201cThat\u2019s not right. How did he know that these two bottles would end up in the hands of Shi Shi or me? Little Jiu would not have noticed the words on the bottles. Even if she did, she would not care. It\u2019s obvious that the message is meant for us. What\u2019s more, it was probably written using Dharmic powers a while ago. These were the remnants of the writing.\u201cIs he also trying to tell me to act like I did not realize the various abnormalities on the Little Qiong Peak?\u201dThe short Daoist kept the bottles, clasped his hands behind his back, and walked towards the side of the table. He rubbed his chin and pondered deeply.Jiu Wu recalled the time he had spotted Li Changshou and Youqin Xuanya\u2019s traces in the North Continent. At the time, he had also stumbled upon many set-ups within a 50-kilometer radius.Jiu Wu looked up and saw the wooden cage hanging in the cool, dark place.These demonic spiders were extremely hard to rear. Yet, they kept reproducing at the Little Qiong Peak.In addition to the chain array formations and poisonous pills that he saw over the past few days\u2026Jiu Wu sighed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re formidable, young man. You remained inconspicuous and hidden. Before you went to the North Continent, not many people knew about you. You are not ranked among the younger generation of cultivators, either. You don\u2019t want people to pay attention to you so that you can hide in a quiet place and cultivate. I don\u2019t want to disturb you, too. However, as an attendant of the Immortal Du Sect, I cannot let my guard down with you.\u201cPui, some peace, gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2026 Meet at 11:45 PM1?\u201dJiu Wu halted, the smile slowly disappearing from his face.\u2026At 11:45 PM, Jiu Wu rode a cloud towards the Little Qiong Peak.At that moment, the array formation around the Pill Chamber had already been deactivated. A tall figure stood at the door of the Pill Chamber. He cupped his hands and bowed towards Jiu Wu.Jiu Wu smiled and landed from the sky. From outside the Pill Chamber, he smelled mellow and rich wine.Li Changshou greeted him. \u201cYour disciple pays his greetings to Uncle-Master.\u201d\u201cGood use of \u2018gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2019 and \u2018some peace\u2019,\u201d said Jiu Wu as he smiled and shook his head. He sighed softly and said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid I wouldn\u2019t turn up? What if I dragged you to the Punishment Hall to be questioned?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d said Li Changshou, with his hands still cupped, and his body still bowed. Warmly, he continued, \u201cYour disciple was not sure either. What\u2019s more, ever since I met Uncle-Master at the North Continent, I have been worried. Yet, I knew that Uncle-Master is a person of virtue and prestige. You would not purposely make life difficult for a disciple in your sect.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, your disciple is just unwilling to attract too much attention. I am completely loyal to the Immortal Du Sect. I also know my responsibilities as a disciple of the sect. I act righteously according to my conscience, and I am not afraid to be questioned.\u201cUncle-Master, please come in and rest.\u201cYour disciple knows that Uncle-Master is an expert in brewing wine. I asked my Junior Sister to prepare several dishes to go with wine. May I be so bold as to invite Uncle-Master to have a taste of the wine I brewed?\u201cUncle-Master, if you have any questions, please ask me tonight. Your disciple will consider carefully and answer you truthfully. I just hope to dispel the worries in Uncle-Master\u2019s heart, so that your disciple can continue to cultivate peacefully as before.\u201dJiu Wu smiled and nodded. With his hands behind his back, he walked into the Pill Chamber.The pure moonlight shone through a window. Under the moonlight, a short table was filled with fine delicacies. A luminous cup was already filled with premium wine.In fact, that was the Ganges River\u2019s Dry Wine that Li Changshou had brewed for Jiu Jiu. He had opened one small vat in advance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moon hung high in the west, and cups and dishes lay in complete disorder on the table.Li Changshou stood in front of the Pill Chamber, looking in the direction that Jiu Wu left. The smile slowly disappeared from his face.One could say that he had this Uncle-Master under control for now.From that day in the North Continent, when Jiu Wu had given him a knowing look, Li Changshou knew that this short and meticulous Daoist had grown \u2018curious\u2019 about him.In addition, he had become much closer to Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu during that period. Asking Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu to help him with so many things would inevitably pique Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2019s \u2018interest\u2019.Curiosity and interest could both easily turn into suspicion. This was a hidden threat to Li Changshou.\u2018How could I deal with the threat Uncle-Master Jiu Wu posed? It was simple. I had to kill him. Cough, I\u2019m joking. I have no feud with Uncle-Master Jiu Wu. What\u2019s more, Uncle-Master Jiu Wu is strong and powerful and is a reputable attendant in the sect. The sect would be greatly shaken if anything untoward happens to any one of the Nine Jiu Immortals. Plotting against Jiu Wu would be akin to courting death. Among the remaining options, the most appropriate and reliable was to invite Uncle-Master Jiu Wu over to have an open discussion.\u2019Li Changshou had to make an oath in front of Uncle-Master Jiu Wu that he would not do anything to harm anyone in the sect.At the same time, he had to expose some of his hidden cultivation. That would make Uncle-Master Jiu Wu feel like he knew this disciple inside and out.This way, Jiu Wu would stop dwelling on Li Changshou so much, and he would also develop a liking towards this disciple.These had to be done on Li Changshou\u2019s initiative in order to lower the chances of a future threat being realized.Li Changshou thought about every detail of his chat with Jiu Wu. Everything played like a film in slow motion in his head. Scene by scene, he reviewed his own performance.Li Changshou had gone over the topics they covered during the conversation, the pace and direction, and even his expressions and gestures, time and time again, before it took place.He reviewed the entire conversation once through and confirmed that he probably did not reveal any more than he intended to. This would prevent Uncle-Master from making any more connections.\u2018Would he develop any misunderstandings because of what I said?\u2019Li Changshou still could not relax. He recalled the conversation again and listened closely to every word and phrase.Then, he touched his cheek as he recalled every expression and gesture of his, as well as Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2019s ever-changing gaze\u2026Li Changshou probably made no mistake.In his peripheral vision, a slender figure dressed in light-pink appeared. Li Changshou turned and saw Lan Ling\u2019e floating through the sky in a cloud.Her hair danced gently in the wind as the flowers on her light-pink dress glowed.Holding on to an empty wicker basket, she leaped in front of Li Changshou. She had light make-up on her face. In the candlelight, she looked exceptionally delicate and beautiful.\u201cSenior Brother! How did it go? Did you settle the problem with Uncle-Master?\u201d\u201cYou could say so,\u201d replied Li Changshou, smiling. \u201cActually, these are just remnant side-effects from my trip to the North Continent. If I don\u2019t go out anymore after this, I will probably not attract the attention of high-skilled elders like him.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked. \u201cSenior Brother, how did you do it? Did you expose your hidden cultivation to Uncle-Master Jiu Wu?\u201dLi Changshou stared at his junior sister and helplessly sent a voice transmission.\u201cI revealed a part of it. Otherwise, I would not have convinced him. Didn\u2019t I tell you many times before not to say these things out loud?! The walls have ears, and the wind has immortal awareness. You\u2019ve really not learned much from all my lessons over the past ten years. For all we know, a well-informed person might be listening to our conversation right now.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Lan Ling\u2019e, pouting. Then, she said gloomily, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I was just concerned about you. I\u2019m going to keep the plates now.\u201dShe bowed her head and took two steps forward. Suddenly, she turned her head, leaned forward, and rested a slender hand on her senior brother\u2019s shoulder. Then, she whispered in Li Changshou\u2019s ear, \u201cSenior Brother, what is your current cultivation level? Have you caught up with Master? Are you going to become an immortal?\u201d\u201cGuess.\u201dLi Changshou shot her a sideway glance and began humming a melody. Clasping his hands behind his back, he walked out of the Pill Chamber.Lan Ling\u2019e made a face at Li Changshou\u2019s back, then quickly kept the empty dishes on the table.At the same time, on a cloud returning to the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026\u201cThe wine was quite strong. It\u2019s Ganges River\u2019s Dry Wine indeed. It\u2019s getting to my head, too\u2026\u201dJiu Wu\u2019s face became flushed, and he felt intoxicated. His entire body seemed to be swaying, but his eyes remained clear.This was because he used sorcery to keep his essence soul from becoming drunk.As he approached the Heaven-Breaking Peak, Jiu Wu laughed gently. Sorrow filled his heart.\u2018This Martial Nephew Changshou is already in the Fifth Stage of Void Return! He\u2019s among the top few disciples in his generation! He could achieve such progress in just 100-odd years. He has excellent potential, indeed! Even his comprehension is amazing. When I assessed his Array Formation Dao earlier, he understood many things I was saying without needing me to explain. The rarest of all is his good nature. Compared to the likes of Yuan Qing, he is like the mood against sludge.\u2019Jiu Wu bowed his head and heaved a long sigh. Then he said in a low voice, \u201cHe did not explain, but how can I not understand his reasons for hiding his cultivation level?\u201cWhen we were drinking, he visibly held himself back several times. The subtle expressions, which he tried to hide, already revealed the helplessness in his heart.\u201cMartial Nephew Changshou is hiding his cultivation level to avoid bringing trouble to the Little Qiong Peak, which already has few people, to begin with. Even if it meant that he would not be properly nurtured and focused on by the sect, he chose to prevent trouble from befalling Junior Brother Qi Yuan and his other disciples.\u201cA good disciple. A good disciple indeed.\u201cIf Junior Brother Qi Yuan fails to endure the Heavenly Tribulation, I will ask Big Senior Sister or Second Senior Brother to invite Martial Nephew Changshou and his junior sister to the Heaven-Breaking Peak.\u201dAs he wallowed in sorrow, the Heaven-Breaking Peak came into view.Jiu Wu looked at his junior sister\u2019s building and found that she had already activated a protective array formation. She was probably already resting.\u201cI will bring some books and texts to Junior Sister later, and ask her to pass them onto Martial Nephew Changshou.\u201cMm, I should look for the Skills-Imparting Elder to have a chat one day. It should not be a problem for immortal seedlings like him to start working on the Inaction Sutra before ascending to immortality.\u201cLittle Qiong Peak\u2026\u201cJunior Brother Qi Yuan has a good disciple. I cannot help but admire him.\u201dShaking his head and sighing, Jiu Wu returned to his own building. Then, he activated the surrounding array formation and drifted to his bed, where remnants of Jiu Shi\u2019s fragrance lingered. There, he sat cross-legged and began to meditate.\u2026Two days had passed since Li Changshou had spoken to Jiu Wu in the night.Li Changshou could finally be sure that this Uncle-Master would not do anything else to him.This comforted Li Changshou. Peace had finally been restored to his life as a cultivator, and things were just as it had been for the past 100-odd years.In fact, all of these things had only happened because of those Immortal-Emancipating Herbs.The Immortal-Melting Pill was already complete, and the ups-and-downs were over. Li Changshou was satisfied with both the process and the outcome.In the afternoon, Li Changshou went to the Pill Chamber and wrapped one Immortal-Melting Pill in a thin layer of candy.Currently, Li Changshou could say that he was done with all the preparations required for the first plan.He looked at the additional 11 Immortal-Melting Pills that he had produced and then divided them into three portions. Carefully, he put them away.Few people refined pills like that, but they were treasures to people who had no hope of becoming immortals, but who wanted to escape the Heavenly Tribulation and live a long life. If Li Changshou had the opportunity, he would go to a noisy marketplace and sell a few of these. There, he would trade these for more precious materials to make array formation foundations.Of course, he had to keep two as spare.Li Changshou knew that he now had an 80% chance of making it through the Heavenly Tribulation and that these chances would keep increasing as he kept cultivating.He also knew that his junior sister would advance quickly towards Immortal Ascension and that her chances of making it through the Heavenly Tribulation would be above 60% as well.However, one could not be too sure about these things. Nobody would be able to tell what would happen in the future.At the very least, if he kept an extra Immortal-Melting Pill on hand, he would not have to fear that the Heavenly Tribulation would go wrong and kill him.Li Changshou would also keep an extra pill for his junior sister. That would allow her to replicate their master\u2019s plan for old age.As a disciple and a senior brother, this was the most that Li Changshou could do for them.Looking at the Immortal-Melting Pill caused Li Changshou to fall into deep thought once again.\u2018What if, I\u2019m just saying what if, Master cannot even make it through the first tribulation? If he is reduced to ashes when the first bolt of lightning strikes, what should I do? The preparations for the first plan are done. I should get started on the second and third plans while I\u2019m at it. It would be best if Master suddenly has an epiphany and makes it through the Heavenly Tribulation to become an ordinary immortal.\u2019Li Changshou sighed and stood up, keeping the candy-wrapped Immortal-Melting Pills in his sleeves. Slowly, he walked out of the Pill Chamber.An hour later\u2026Li Changshou stood in front of the place where his master was secluding himself. He cleared his throat, gave a Dao salute towards the door, and shouted, \u201cMaster! Your disciple wants to ask you a few questions about cultivation! Your disciple is deeply sorry for disturbing Master while you are cultivating!\u201dSoon, the wooden door opened, and the old Daoist priest, Qi Yuan, walked out, smiling. He waved his hand at Li Changshou.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go to the lake. Your master has been neglecting to teach you these few years as well.\u201dLi Changshou sighed softly in his heart.\u2018Master opened the door so quickly. It\u2019s obvious he was not meditating. Is it hard for him to meditate now? It looks like the Heavenly Tribulation is really right around the corner.\u2019They arrived at the side of the lake, underneath a willow. Qi Yuan pulled out two meditation cushions and sat opposite Li Changshou.Qi Yuan said in a warm tone, \u201cFeel free to ask me any questions.\u201dThen, Qi Yuan\u2019s gaze darkened. He sighed and said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it through the Heavenly Tribulation, I might not have a chance to answer your questions in the future.\u201d\u201cMaster, what are you talking about?\u201d Li Changshou smiled. \u201cYou will make it through the Heavenly Tribulation for sure.\u201cMaster, haven\u2019t you always said that if we don\u2019t have confidence in ourselves, we will not be able to face the obstacles and training that the Great Dao gives us?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so afraid of death, yet you are turning around to teach your master!\u201d Qi Yuan chided Li Changshou with a serious expression.Li Changshou grinned and quickly cut to the chase. He began to ask questions about his own cultivation.Li Changshou\u2019s first three questions were quite ordinary. They were all questions that most cultivators in the Void Return Realm would have. Qi Yuan explained the answers in great detail.Li Changshou\u2019s fourth question was \u201cWhat does \u2018A soul returns to its soul, aura returns to its aura; the five elements function in a cycle, the world is restored to order\u2019 mean?\u201dQi Yuan paused, and then walked towards the lake, deep in thought.Li Changshou did not stop. Instead, he asked three more questions, which were obviously \u2018outside the syllabus\u2019. At that moment, Qi Yuan did not know how to respond to Li Changshou.Li Changshou was not making his master look bad on purpose. He merely wanted to remind his master tactfully that if there was a bottleneck in his cultivation journey, these few paths remained accessible to him to explore.Currently, Qi Yuan was well aware that the chances of him making it through the Heavenly Tribulation were slim. He wanted to try his best to teach his disciple well and was deeply considering his own understanding of these problems. He dared not mislead his own disciple.Slowly, Qi Yuan fell into deep thought.Shortly after, Qi Yuan closed his eyes to focus.Subsequently, flower petals appeared around the old Daoist. This was a common sight for cultivators who were approaching the Heavenly Tribulation.However, the flower petals around Qi Yuan were extremely faint. The silhouettes of the petals were also blurry\u2026Very carefully, Li Changshou set up a simple, noise-cancellation layer around his master. Then, he turned around and headed back to his straw hut to busy himself.This was the main part of the second plan. He needed to try his best to improve his master\u2019s skill, as well as his master\u2019s comprehension and understanding of the Great Dao.\u2018Ai, if only I could give master a portion of the epiphanies I have every once in a while.\u2019Li Changshou sighed in his heart and then prepared the supplementary steps of this plan.The supplementary portion of the second plan was awesome.Li Changshou took out a pouch marked Metaphysics Number 32. From inside, he retrieved several three-feet-long, purple logs and six six-feet-long, multi-colored, metal rods. He began to fiddle with them quietly.Lightning-Conducting Logs were common materials used in setting up lightning-elemental array formations. They could conduct the power of thunder and lightning.The Lightning-Accumulating Seven Deity Metal was also a common material used in lightning-elemental array formations. They could accumulate and distribute the power of thunder and lightning.According to Li Changshou\u2019s knowledge, the destruction caused to cultivators by the Heavenly Tribulation could mostly be attributed to the power of thunder and lightning. Only a small fraction could be attributed to the attacks of the Great Dao.If he could build a Two-Times Lightning-Diverting Rod, it could help cultivators mid-way through the Heavenly Tribulation. When the lightning struck, more than half of the power of thunder and lightning could be diverted out of their bodies. This might increase one\u2019s chances of making it through the Heavenly Tribulation.What\u2019s more, theoretically, this should not trigger an amplification of the Heavenly Tribulation\u2019s power.No matter what, Li Changshou had to give it a shot!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSenior Brother, what do you have here? Is this also a tool that could speed up the installation of array formations?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e swore to the Grand Pure One it was the only thing she asked before she was called and imprisoned by her senior brother in a wooden cage. She had become a lab rat for that \u2018technical product\u2019.The wooden cage was about the height of a man. It was made of 36 connected lightning-conducting logs. Its interior was also coated with a delicate layer of colorful iron web.The lightning-conducting logs were pieced and tied together. That made the wooden cage appear a little shabby.There was a rainbow-colored long needle at the tip of the wooden cage and a hexagram made of lightning-accumulating Seven Deity Metal at the bottom. However, the hexagram was not an array formation, and it did not contain any restrictions. It was just a plain and simple hexagram-shaped pattern.When cultivators underwent Tribulation Transcendence, they could not rely on array formations to block the attacks. The rays of lightning during Heavenly Tribulation could disregard all array formations.There were many miraculous uses for postnatal Dharma treasures that were refined by cultivators. They mainly relied on the restrictions inscribed on both the interior and exterior of the Dharma treasures.After years of research, Li Changshou was certain about one thing\u2014the principles behind restrictions were similar to that of array formations. Both relied on specific symbols and patterns to draw spiritual energy. The only differences were in the complexity and size of the symbols and patterns.Restrictions were inscribed onto Dharma treasures. The Dharma treasures were similar to the base of an array formation. Cultivators could activate the restrictions and produce an enormous force by injecting immortal powers into the Dharma treasures.In array formations, the base acted as nodes. By drawing on Heaven and Earth\u2019s powers, spiritual energy would flow within the base of the array formations.Although the principles behind restrictions and array formations were similar, they served completely different purposes.Advanced postnatal Dharma treasures could usually compress a complete restriction into the size of a fingernail.On the other hand, the strength of array formations was directly proportional to their sizes. Array formations had to integrate with heaven and earth so as to utilize their powers.Therefore, although Li Changshou was skilled in creating array formations, he was not proficient in refining Dharma artifacts.There was nothing he could do about that. He had only been cultivating for 112 years, and he had tried his best to reduce his sleeping time throughout the years. Nevertheless, cultivation and other skills such as alchemy, refining poisons, and array formations all required an immense amount of time to achieve mastery.He would die to be able to spend the 24 hours he had every day as though he had 48 hours instead. Nonetheless, the duration of his cultivation was ultimately too short. He had to compromise some of his avocations. There was no way he could achieve mastery in all his avocations.Back to the issue of blocking Heavenly Tribulation\u2026Heavenly Tribulation could overlook array formations and most defense-type Dharma treasures. Only some rare Dharma treasures could reduce the Heavenly Tribulation\u2019s impact. Those did not include the connate Dharma treasures and ultimate Dharma treasures as they were too rare to be found.However, Li Changshou had an advantage that no one else had\u2014nine years of compulsory education.The wooden cage that he had made was inspired by the Faraday Cage1 that was in his high school physics textbook. It could be used to block out lightning and was often used in breathtaking high-voltage magic tricks.Li Changshou had almost forgotten about the principles behind the cage, but he could still recall its structure.Li Changshou instructed Lan Ling\u2019e, \u201cDo not touch the web around you.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e shivered in the cage. She stepped on a wooden plank and looked at her senior brother pitifully. \u201cSenior Brother, what exactly are you doing?\u201d\u201cJust don\u2019t move,\u201d Li Changshou replied calmly. He took out a few talismans from his sleeve and threw them about 100 feet above the wooden cage casually while pointing at the talismans with his left hand.A few cracks were heard, and lighting soon struck down from the clear sky.A few bolts of lightning struck directly on the lightning-conducting logs above the wooden cage. The iron web surrounding the wooden cage was lit up by tiny electric currents instantly. The lightning-accumulating Seven Deity Metal at the bottom of the wooden cage instantly scattered the electric currents and integrated them into the ground.Lan Ling\u2019e was hugging her head and cowering in fear. She looked up slowly and glanced around in astonishment. Praises escaped her mouth.\u201cWhat is this treasure? It could actually block the lightning bolts successfully!\u201dLi Changshou replied nonchalantly, \u201cThis is the Faraday Cage. Stay in there a while longer. I\u2019ll try increasing the voltage.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother! Why don\u2019t we stop here? Aiya!\u201dBefore Lan Ling\u2019e could finish her sentence, Li Changshou had taken a stack of yellow paper talismans from his sleeve. He activated them using his Dharmic powers and threw them above the wooden cage.These talismans produced bolts of lightning and filled the sky with thunderbolts.Boom!The lightning bolts crashed towards the wooden cage below!In a split second, the sky was engulfed by lightning. The birds on the Little Qiong Peak flocked above the forest, and the spiritual beasts were filled with uneasiness.The experiments showed that the Faraday Cage\u2019s effects were pretty remarkable. The only concern that he had was whether the Heavenly Tribulation would demolish the cage.He only hoped that the cage could block the first bolt of heavenly lightning during the Heavenly Tribulation for his master.\u201cCome on out. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d Li Changshou called out before starting to think of ways to reinforce the wooden cage.Lan Ling\u2019e could not resist the urge to complain. \u201cSenior Brother, you could have placed a fish in the cage! Wouldn\u2019t that achieve the same result?\u201d\u201cI wanted you to participate in this. We both helped Master during his Tribulation Transcendence,\u201d Li Changshou replied while smiling.Lan Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and arranged her beautiful hair behind her ears. \u201cSenior Brother, are we going to continue experimenting?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cMy cultivation level might not be high, but I can definitely help with these things.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t stay in there for the next experiments. We\u2019ll do as you have said. Let\u2019s grab a bucket and experiment with fish.\u201dLi Changshou took out a bunch of colorful and long strings. He continued burying his head in the tasks. \u201cWe are now testing the intensity of the lightning strikes. There\u2019s no way you can handle the impacts if they land on you.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e responded in agreement, turned around, and rushed to the side of the lake. She carefully avoided her master, who was meditating in the soundproof field, and jumped onto the lake.After a while, lightning appeared above the Little Qiong Peak again.That lasted for about three days. Those who noticed the lightning thought that someone was practicing lightning Dharma spells on the mountain peak. Nobody paid attention to the weird occurrences.That continued until Qi Yuan woke up from his meditation. Satisfied with the outcome of his meditation, he turned around to find that the lush grass and beautiful scenery beside the lake had been thoroughly demolished. Parallel black vertical lines appeared on his forehead that was full of wrinkles. A large hole had formed on the bank of the lake. His two disciples were squatting at the bottom of the hole and were working on a large birdcage.Qi Yuan sighed in despair and chided them. \u201cWhat are you two doing instead of cultivating?!\u201d\u201cMaster! You\u2019re awake!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e called out in excitement. \u201cSenior Brother has made a treasure that could help you with the Heavenly Tribulation! We have tested it out hundreds of times with lightning strikes. The fish are still alive!\u201dLi Changshou added, \u201cPlease wait a moment, Master. This object will be completed soon.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Qi Yuan\u2019s expression changed instantly. He was curious about the new innovation his elder disciple was working on.However, the moment he stepped forward, his expression changed again. He stood still and looked at the sky in the east.Lan Ling\u2019e lifted her head and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Master?\u201d\u201cHaiz.\u201d Qi Yuan stood with his hands behind his back. He replied gently, \u201cThe Heavenly Tribulation is here.\u201dThose words made Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s smiles disappear instantly.They jumped out of the hole hurriedly and looked towards the direction their master was looking at. A sea of dark clouds appeared in the east and was moving towards the Immortal Du Sect at fast speed.\u201cLing\u2019e, quickly!\u201d Li Changshou shouted immediately. \u201cLing\u2019e, quickly! Bring the cage to the Tribulation Transcendence venue that Master had picked in the mountains behind! Make sure that the six poles of Seven Deity Metal are buried in the ground!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e carried the Faraday Cage with her skinny arms and rushed towards the mountains behind on a cloud. She did not have time to be concerned about her \u2018fairy image\u2019.At that moment, Li Changshou was even more worried than his master. He took out a brocade box from his sleeve and rushed towards Qi Yuan.\u201cMaster, this is a precious pill that I have specially refined for you. It\u2026 it can help you block one bolt of heavenly lightning. After the first lightning bolt, you can consume this immediately if you think that you cannot handle the next strike.\u201dQi Yuan looked at Li Changshou with a smile and said in a hushed voice, \u201cKeep this precious pill for yourself. You can use it during your Tribulation Transcendence. Don\u2019t waste it on me.\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dLi Changshou knelt down in front of Qi Yuan and squeezed the brocade box into Qi Yuan\u2019s hands. He said anxiously, \u201cMaster, you have raised and taught me for so many years. You are the one who guided me on the path to pursue Dao, and you had never been harsh on me or asked anything from me. This is the only thing I can do for you, Master. If you do not accept this pill, I will destroy it immediately!\u201dQi Yuan smiled bitterly and said, \u201cWhy do you have to do this? How could I possibly not know about my condition?\u201d\u201cOh, right! I have 11 more of those pills!\u201d Li Changshou changed his strategy immediately. \u201cI can swear to the miraculous Dao that I definitely have 11 more similar pills! And, every cultivator can only consume one of the pills!\u201dQi Yuan was a little hesitant. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cDefinitely!\u201d\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Qi Yuan grabbed the brocade box with his hand and said, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s head to the back mountains. Let\u2019s not allow the Heavenly Tribulation to destroy our accommodation.\u201dThe grey cloud soon reached the Immortal Du Sect.Li Changshou hopped on a white cloud hurriedly and pulled his master to the back mountains.\u201cMaster, you can save your Dharma powers now. Oh, right. Master, do you have sufficient medicinal pills with you? You can use all kinds of medicinal pills during Tribulation Transcendence. Have you prepared enough pills to treat your injuries and recover your energy? Why did the Heavenly Tribulation come without any warning?!\u201d\u201cI have prepared them. I have prepared them.\u201d Qi Yuan smiled as he looked at Li Changshou, who was standing in front of him. He recalled the demure and lost little boy Li Changshou was when he brought him to the mountains initially.In a whizz, so many years had passed.Although the little kid then became a little wild, he had ultimately grown up.Qi Yuan spent the last of the resources that the Little Qiong Peak had on him. His only wish was that Li Changshou could successfully become an immortal.\u201cChangshou, if I do not manage to survive the Heavenly Tribulation, the Little Qiong Peak will be left in your hands. If the sect wants to reclaim our Little Qiong Peak, do not obstruct them. Listen to the sect\u2019s arrangement. I have begged a few fellow sect members that I am familiar with for a favor. They will bring you and Ling\u2019e to their peak to cultivate.\u201d\u201cMaster, you will definitely survive the Heavenly Tribulation!\u201dLi Changshou asserted, \u201cBe confident! Do not be depressed. This is an obstacle that the Heavenly Dao wants you to overcome. Everything will be okay once you have overcome it. If living things do not fight for a chance to survive, what is the point of their existence?! There is always a slim chance of survival in every desperate situation. Only when you fight for your survival will you survive the situation!\u201dQi Yuan sighed. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cMy dear disciple, don\u2019t you know these principles? Why do you still live so cautiously every day?\u201dLi Changshou replied solemnly, \u201cI have never forgotten these principles that you have taught me. The only reason for my cautiousness was to avoid landing myself in those desperate situations.\u201dIn no time, they reached the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s back mountains. Lan Ling\u2019e was waving from an empty space in the forest. Li Changshou pulled his master and jumped down. He pushed his master into the newly constructed wooden cage without any room for debate.Afterward, he lowered his head and started checking the condition of the birdcage. He took out a couple of porcelain bottles, threw them into his master\u2019s hands, and closed the wooden cage door. Then, he pulled Lan Ling\u2019e and started retreating quickly.The grey cloud had already appeared above the Immortal Du Sect and shielded the light from outside. The Immortal Du Sect was engulfed in darkness.Li Changshou yelled at the top of his lungs, \u201cMaster! Do your best to fight it! The precious pill must be used after the first bolt of heavenly lightning!\u201dQi Yuan nodded his head solemnly. He lifted his head and looked at the tribulation cloud. Waves of Dharma powers swarmed him. His sleeves and the seams of his Dao robe were moving without the presence of any wind.Lan Ling\u2019e shouted, \u201cMaster, you can do this!\u201d\u201cI will fight for myself this time!\u201dQi Yuan looked at the sky. His eyes were sparkling.A fight against destiny!All of a sudden, the cry of a dragon sounded above the clouds. A 10,000-feet long azure dragon that was covered in shimmering red scales emerged from the grey clouds. Its claw slammed onto the mountain-protecting array formation.The lights in the mountain-protecting array formation flickered as the mountains trembled. Loud booms sounded from the ground on all sides!At the same time, a deep voice sounded from the skies!\u201cThe person in charge of the Immortal Du Sect, come out and reply to me!\u201dWait!Azure dragon? Calling out people?This grey cloud was situated outside the mountain-protecting array formation. It did not have the ability to disregard all array formations\u2026Although it has a suppressive force, upon closer inspection, it was not the heavenly suppressive force.\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t that Master\u2019s Tribulation Cloud?\u201dLi Changshou tilted her head. He could not stop himself from cupping his forehead. Qi Yuan, standing inside the Faraday\u2019s Cage, also twitched the corner of his lip.This old Daoist priest turned around quietly and squatted down slowly.\u2018Oh my Grand Pure One, I have embarrassed myself thoroughly this time!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe situation became a little awkward.Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e both lifted their heads and looked at the skies simultaneously.The azure dragon was circulating above the mountain-protecting array formation while the grey clouds tumbled in the sky.The suppressive force that was similar to that of a Heaven Immortal seeped through the mountain-protecting array formation and engulfed the entire Immortal Du Sect. Many silhouettes appeared on the various mountain peaks. They were members of the Immortal Du Sect, who were shocked by the violent tremors.All of a sudden, many beams of light emerged from the Heaven-Breaking Peak and flew out of the mountain-protecting array formation. The light beams turned into four silhouettes that were levitating in the sky and were looking at the clouds in the distance.The male immortal, who stood at the front, wore a green and white robe. He stood with his hands behind his back in the sky. He was lean and tall like a cypress tree, and there were two long wisps of white hair at his temples. He appeared cool and distant.The moment he appeared, the suppressive force from the sky faded away immediately. The azure dragon flew into the clouds instantly and did not dare to be near the mountain-protecting array formation.That was the first time Li Changshou saw Exalted Wang Qing.That\u2019s right. That handsome man with white hair at his temples was the master of the Nine Jiu Immortals. He was a Heaven Immortal from the Immortal Du Sect, and his Dao name was Wang Qing.Behind Exalted Wang Qing was an old Daoist priest that was holding a horsetail whisk and had a smile on his face. There was also an old lady who was using a wooden walking stick and was also smiling.The last person was a beautiful fairy clad in a rainbow-colored dress. However, no one could see her clearly through the thin layer of fog that was surrounding her.The red-scaled azure dragon yelled from the clouds, \u201cAre you people the ones in charge of the matters within the Immortal Du Sect?\u201dExalted Wang Qing did not even lift his head. His calm voice resonated within and outside of the array formation.\u201cI am merely an unfettered cultivator in the sect. I am not in the position to handle the matters in the Immortal Du Sect. I just think that you, little dragon, seem a little rude. Thus, I\u2019m here to teach you a lesson.\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201d The red dragon yelled in anger from the clouds. Most of the grey clouds that engulfed the sky scattered, and a dragon claw that contained Raging-Lightning Heavenly Fire crashed towards Exalted Wang Qing!The dragon claw drew bigger as it cut through the sky. In a split second, its diameter had expanded to thousands of feet. It covered the entire sky and blocked out the sun. It appeared as though it was about to smash the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s mountain-protecting array formation and the Heaven-Breaking Peak apart!When they saw that, many disciples held their breath, some sect members, who were at a higher cultivation level, looked stressed as well.Lan Ling\u2019e was standing beside Li Changshou. She grabbed her senior brother\u2019s arm involuntarily. Her cultivation level was too low, and the dragon\u2019s suppressive force suppressed her. That made her extremely uneasy.Li Changshou released a wisp of aura and enclosed Lan Ling\u2019e in it in the nick of time. That helped to relieve some of the pressure that she was feeling and prevented her from suffering from mental demons.Suddenly, the dragon\u2019s claw, which covered the entire sky and appeared as magnificent as the mountain ranges, stopped above the mountain-protecting array formation without any warning!The strong winds that followed the motion of the dragon\u2019s claw made the thin and silk-like walls of the mountain-protecting array formation shimmer.However, the enormous dragon claw mysteriously stopped in the air. It could not even move an inch closer!Li Changshou utilized his Dharma powers on his eyes and saw that Exalted Wang Qing had lifted his left arm in the air. His fingers formed a finger sword and pointed on the huge dragon claw!He managed to block the dragon claw that was as enormous as a mountain with just one finger!Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s long hair danced wildly in the air while his robe rustled.\u201cHumph!\u201dA disdainful snort reverberated in the air thousands of kilometers away!Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s left arm vibrated. The next moment, the mountain-like dragon claw shattered instantly into pieces and exploded in the sky!The azure dragon that was tossing in the clouds appeared once again. However, it was enclosed in an invisible film of energy. Its gigantic torso twisted and struggled continuously and was thrown into the sky.After a few moments, the azure dragon returned from the sky, boiling in anger. It let out an angry wail.Exalted Wang Qing lifted his head slightly. There was killing intent in his eyes.The azure dragon stopped its wail. Strong red lights shone around its body, and it turned into a burly man, who had a dragon\u2019s head and was clad in armor. The man appeared shocked and angry.Exalted Wang Qing said coldly, \u201cHow dare you cause trouble at the Immortal Du Sect when you have only just become a Heaven Immortal? Are you tired of staying alive?\u201dThe burly man with a dragon\u2019s head wailed in anger. He did not dare to attack rashly. Instead, he yelled from the skies, \u201cImmortal Du Sect! Seems like you want to do this the hard way!\u201cI am a special envoy from the Dragon Palace in the East Ocean and a frontline warrior for the Dragon Palace Water Troops!\u201cHow dare you behave so rudely!? I will definitely report this to the Dragon King. Not before long, we will prepare the troops and tread down this little mountain of yours!\u201dThe old Daoist priest standing behind Exalted Wang Qing laughed instantly. \u201cIt is such a rare occurrence to see the Dragon Palace behave so boldly.\u201cHowever, aren\u2019t you going overboard trying to establish your authority on our Immortal Du Sect?\u201cAfter all, the Immortal Du Sect belongs to the human school. The luck of the human schools protects us. The East Ocean Dragon did not live peacefully in the East Ocean to replenish its own luck but instead allowed an evil dragon to cause trouble everywhere. Furthermore, you attacked our mountain-protecting array formation without saying anything.Are you a frontline warrior, trying to spark a war between us human cultivators and the dragon race?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dThe burly man with the dragon\u2019s head bulged his eyes wide open. He did not dare to answer that question absentmindedly.The current predicament they were in now was different from before. During the Great Mage-Demon War, the human race was weak and feeble. However, the human race was now the protagonist of Heaven and Earth. It was even more prosperous than the ancient mages and demons.The human race did not even need the entire population of human cultivators to attack the dragon race. The immortal sects in the East Continent could do so if they invited one or two mighty figures from the Three Schools. The dragon race might not even be able to handle that attack.The dragon was stuck in a predicament.The old lady from the Immortal Du Sect stepped forward at the right time. She tried sorting out the situation with a smile on her face. She said some nice words and gave the dragon an out.The dragon accepted her offer and started stating his purpose with a stoic face.\u201cSome days ago, the Immortal Du Sect came to destroy the demons at the East Ocean. However, your disciples hurt the soldiers that the dragon race had been developing by accident!\u201cHowever, our Dragon King decided to let this matter go. Three years from now, we will be holding a Demon-Sweeping Meet at the East Ocean. We are inviting all immortal sects from the East Continent to attend the meet to discuss future demon-sweeping matters.\u201cThe East Ocean Dragon Palace is full of treasures. We will heavily reward disciples from the human race who perform well during the meet.\u201cThis is the invitation card. You must not miss the event!\u201cHmph!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, the burly man with a dragon\u2019s head threw down a shining invitation card. Then he transformed into an azure dragon, plunged into the clouds, and left.The old lady kept away the invitation card and shouted, \u201cTake your time as you leave, frontline warrior. We shall not send you off.\u201dJokes about the Dragon Palace sparked throughout the Immortal Du Sect instantly.The four inner sect elders had an internal discussion before leaving the mountain to confront the dragon. Exalted Wang Qing would play the bad cop, the old Daoist priest would threaten the dragon, and the old lady would play the good cop.These three Heaven Immortals had staged a play on their own and played the arrogant general from the Dragon Palace.The dragon originally wanted to establish an opening gambit to the Immortal Du Sect. However, he had thoroughly made a joke out of himself. He did not even dare to say any harsh words and left dejectedly.Dragons could shape the clouds while tigers could shape the wind. It was a rare and spectacular sight to see the azure dragon move through the clouds.\u201cSenior Brother, so this is the world of the powerful?\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e asked softly.Li Changshou shook his head slightly and transmitted his voice to her, \u201cThey could only be considered as experts. They are not yet the most powerful cultivators\u2026\u201dAfterward, the senior brother and junior sister duo recalled what happened previously. They lowered their heads and looked in front of them simultaneously.Beside the Faraday Cage, Qi Yuan was silently closing the wooden door of the cage and was prepared to escape from the sides.Lan Ling\u2019e continued staring at the skies and pretended that she did not notice her master\u2019s actions.Meanwhile, Li Changshou closed his eyes and was in deep thoughts. He appeared as though he was amazed by the rare battle between the expert cultivators that he had just witnessed.Qi Yuan knew that his two disciples did so to protect his pride.A few black vertical lines appeared on his wrinkled forehead. His face fell, and his lips twitched, but no words came out from his mouth.\u201cCough! Umm\u2026 Cough!\u201cNo one is allowed to laugh!\u201cThis is the first time I am experiencing Tribulation Transcendence. I lack the experience!\u201cI shall\u2026 first head back to secluded cultivation!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Qi Yuan turned around, covered his face, and walked away. He was extremely fast on his cloud.The senior brother and junior sister duo held their laughter until Qi Yuan returned to the straw hut and reinstated the layers of array formations.This mistake could be treated as a Tribulation Transcendence drill.Fortunately, they did not alert the disciples from the other peaks, so there was no other audience. Moreover, the dragon had attracted all the attention. Otherwise, Qi Yuan would now be\u2026 He might wish that he was dead.\u2026It was also a good thing that they did not experience a sudden Tribulation Transcendence.After the situation died down, Li Changshou started to worry if his master would take out and inspect the precious pill that he gave him.However, thinking from another perspective, his master might not even recognize the Immortal-Melting Pill, even if he were to inspect it.Qi Yuan was not proficient in concocting pills. He was only proficient in array formations.Since 1,000 years ago, when he first entered the sect, Qi Yuan had spent most of his time improving his cultivation level. However, because of the damage in his Dao base, his cultivation road had been tough.The main reason why Qi Yuan did not have a high possibility of surviving the Heavenly Tribulation was because of the damage in his Dao base.Li Changshou\u2019s third strategy to help his master survive the Heavenly Tribulation was to repair his Dao base.However, although the third strategy seemed to be able to solve the problem from its roots, in reality, it was the most dangerous and toughest strategy yet.The damage to his Dao base was due to an injury he had when he was younger.Li Changshou had tried asking his master several times about the exact reason for the injury, but Qi Yuan had never answered those questions directly. He had merely responded that he had made some mistakes during his cultivation.After that injury, the seniors from the sect had used many pills to save his life.During that time, Qi Yuan was the only person in the Little Qiong Peak. His Martial Grandmaster had left the mountains to travel about 900 years ago. He had never returned.While Qi Yuan had been repairing his Dao base, the sect had offered him many healing pills. However, they were short of a few precious treasures.After the injury to Qi Yuan\u2019s Dao base had stabilized, he had cultivated for another couple hundreds of years. It appeared as though he had fully recovered. However, the damage to his Dao base was irreversible, and it was almost impossible to repair the damage done.When a tree grew in a crooked direction, and it continued growing it that position, it would ultimately become an old crooked tree.The Dao injury that Qi Yuan suffered was similar to that.To replenish Qi Yuan\u2019s Dao base, Li Changshou had to destroy his cultivation level that he had accumulated for hundreds of years. He had to carefully tear open the Dao injury that had already sealed up and heal it using rare treasures.Not only would the process be perilous, but it would also cause Qi Yuan to suffer from immense pain. Moreover, it was hard to find rare treasures, and Li Changshou was also not completely confident that he could amend the Dao injury.Therefore, Li Changshou prioritized the first two strategies. He kept the third strategy and the other six alternative strategies to himself and decided to use them only when the situation required him to.After the incident, Qi Yuan underwent another two more months of secluded cultivation.Two months later, Qi Yuan wanted to reestablish his authority as the master and also answer the few questions that Li Changshou had previously asked.However, Li Changshou was prepared for that. After he heard Qi Yuan\u2019s explanations, he asked a few more new questions. Qi Yuan was once again unable to answer those questions. He headed back to the straw hut, started on his secluded cultivation again, and continued improving on his Dao.During that period, Li Changshou thought of a few more tools that could be used during Tribulation Transcendence.When his master came out from secluded cultivation, Li Changshou could sense wisps of aura changes that were surrounding him.That was a sign that he had been targeted by the Heavenly Dao and was about to experience Tribulation Transcendence.In no more than two years, his master would definitely start to fight the Heavenly Tribulation. He would not be of any help then.After all, Tribulation Transcendence was his master\u2019s matter. Others could not step in.Therefore, after a year and nine months\u2026Qi Yuan\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation was like an old lady who had just been married. It appeared shy and hesitant at the beginning. However, at the crucial moments, it came like a storm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His brand new cyan, silk Dao robe, was a pretty good defensive Dharma treasure. It also made Qi Yuan look a few years younger than he was.Qi Yuan was approaching the Heavenly Tribulation. Naturally, his expression was somber.A few wisps of inexplicable aura revolved around Qi Yuan. From time to time, a petal would appear and fly past him, before disappearing with the breeze on the mountain.Qi Yuan\u2019s pair of disciples stood on treetops, 1,000 feet from him.Lan Ling\u2019e looked nervously at her master, as she fiddled with a lock of her fine black hair, which hung down her forehead.Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s body had matured even more during these few years. It looked like her slender waist, wrapped with a belt, could be held in one hand. Her long, tasseled skirt outlined the curves on her lower body, making her look flawless from every angle.Compared to two years ago, her beautiful face looked even gentler. However, she still looked very delicate and quick-witted.Li Changshou stood on another treetop, not far from Lan Ling\u2019e, dressed in his regular, long robe as he normally was. In his left hand, he held a bamboo slip. In his right hand, he held a carving knife. His spiritual awareness was focused on his master and his surroundings, as he waited for the signs of the approaching Heavenly Tribulation.There was nothing else to say.He had already finished what needed to be done. He just needed his master to make it through the first tribulation next. Then, it would be up to him to decide when he would use the \u2018precious pill\u2019.Now, Li Changshou\u2019s primary task was to observe and record the process of his master enduring the Heavenly Tribulation.This was because the Immortal Du Sect only recruited disciples once every 200 years. When Li Changshou entered the sect, the previous generation of disciples had just completed their ascension to immortality.Most of the disciples that were limited by their potential and comprehension, and who were fated not to become immortals, had already left the sect and returned to their hometowns. In these 100 years, the Immortal Du Sect had been focusing on nurturing the youngest generation of disciples. There were very few people from the previous generation who were still ascending to immortality.His master\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation would be the sixth time Li Changshou witnessed a cultivator from the Immortal Du Sect enduring the Heavenly Tribulation. What\u2019s more, it was rare for him to be able to observe the entire process up-close. He had to record every detail down and analyze it later.Hu\u2026A breeze blew past the forest. Qi Yuan, who was in the wooden cage, looked up at the sky as rays of light lit up around him.In the blink of an eye, these rays congealed into pillars of light, which shot into the sky!\u2018It\u2019s here. This is the sign of Immortal Ascension!\u2019Li Changshou gripped his carving knife tightly, lifted up his bamboo slip, and began to write at tremendous speed. He began to record every detail that he was observing.\u2018The pillars of light remained for ten minutes. The sky above the Little Qiong Peak changed color!\u2019Li Changshou could sense that the Heaven and Earth\u2019s spiritual energy was gathering at the Little Qiong Peak from all directions. The energy stopped 1,000 feet above his master\u2019s head. Instantly, they turned into gray clouds of the tribulation.At that moment, figures flew out from various peaks in the mountain-protecting array formation. They flew into the sky and looked towards the Little Qiong Peak.Below the clouds of the tribulation, there was a silvery-white lightning spot. Small electric arcs also appeared around Qi Yuan\u2019s body.Li Changshou squeezed his fingers together to calculate. Almost immediately, he raised his head and sent a voice transmission to his master.\u201cMaster, according to the surface area and thickness of the Tribulation Cloud, I guess this would be the common Heavenly Tribulation with five bolts of heavenly lightning.\u201dQi Yuan\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. He thought that it would be the weakest Heavenly Tribulation, with three bolts of lightning. He did not think that he would have to endure five bolts of lightning.The maximum number of bolts was nine, but Heavenly Tribulations with four, five, or six lightning bolts were common.There was a saying that the number of lightning bolts in one\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation would depend on the cultivator\u2019s potential before and after ascending to immortality.The more bolts of lightning, the broader one\u2019s path would be, and the more potential one would have after ascending to immortality. This also meant that it would be harder for that person to make it through the Heavenly Tribulation.After sending the voice transmission, Li Changshou lowered his head and continued writing with his carving knife.Boom! Boom!The Tribulation Cloud began to tremble continuously as the lightning spot became more obvious. When the lightning spot reached its critical state, it turned into a blinding pillar of lightning, which struck the old Daoist priest directly on his head!The moment the lightning struck, the earth seemed to change color!The bolt of lightning was accompanied by a wave of the Great Dao, which carried all the power of nature in Heaven and Earth.However, to the astonishment of the immortals and cultivators observing this Heavenly Tribulation, the power of the lightning was completely absorbed by the wooden cage, which contained Qi Yuan! Logically, no Dharma treasure should have been able to fend against the Heavenly Tribulation.Flashes of lightning appeared in various parts of the wooden cage, but Qi Yuan remained unaffected inside. No sparks appeared on any part of his body, except in his gray hair, which was dancing around in all directions.Lan Ling\u2019e immediately shouted excitedly, \u201cSenior Brother! The birdcage works!\u201dLi Changshou began to grin as well, but before his grin fully spread across his face, the unfathomable wave of the Great Dao appeared. The cage, which had been lit up by the flashes of lightning, suddenly exploded into pieces.\u2018Alright, the Heavenly Dao does not tolerate tricks indeed. That\u2019s fine. At the very least, Master has made it through the first bolt of lightning.\u2019However, at that moment, Li Changshou realized a problem. Since his master did not personally withstand the first bolt of lightning, there was no hint of immortal energy in his body.The Faraday Cage helped to divert the first bolt of lightning, but it also took away the benefits that were to come with it.\u2018You win some, and you lose some. That\u2019s a common principle of the Great Dao. It\u2019s a good thing that Master did not swallow that Immortal-Melting Pill. Otherwise, I would have personally killed him\u2026\u2019A bigger lightning spot appeared on top of the Tribulation Cloud. It contained even more power than the one before.Qi Yuan\u2019s expression darkened. He adjusted his Dharmic powers in his body and slowly floated into the air.\u2018I have to endure the Immortal Ascension Tribulation with brute force!\u2019Crack!Ss\u2014The second bolt of lightning struck harshly. The lightning pillar, which was formed by the electric arcs, seemed to swallow Qi Yuan\u2019s body whole!Beads of sweat formed on Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s foreheads. They watched as their master endured the force of the lightning pillar for a split second, before collapsing onto the ground. Lan Ling\u2019e immediately squeezed her eyes shut, not daring to watch any longer.It was only when the sound of thunder dissipated, and her senior brother heaved a sigh of relief that Lan Ling\u2019e finally opened her eyes.The old Daoist priest Qi Yuan looked battered and exhausted as he slowly sat up inside a shallow pit in the ground. He turned to the side and coughed out blood. Then, he ate several pills and sat upright once again.He still had plenty Dharmic powers. A faint immortal glow circled around his body.Qi Yuan had made it through that second bolt of lightning.Li Changshou paused his writing and reached into his right sleeve with his left hand. He gripped onto a paper doll and a pill.\u2018From the way Master looks, he might be able to make it through the third bolt of lightning. However, he will surely not make it through the fourth. If Master is rendered paralyzed by the third bolt of lightning, I will have to force the Immortal-Melting Pill into his mouth.\u2019A bigger lightning spot appeared in the Tribulation Cloud. Qi Yuan got to his feet and quickly conjured a seal with both of his hands. Layers of Dharmic shields appeared in front of him.Yet, they were useless.This time, there was a loud explosive noise. It seemed like there was an entire army in the Tribulation Cloud, charging forward. A pillar of lightning as thick as a millstone carried murderous aura as it struck downwards. In the blink of an eye, it knocked down all the shields that Qi Yuan had set up, pressed him into the shallow pit, and shot power out at an insane rate.Upon feeling the strong wind from the impact, Lan Ling\u2019e could no longer hold in her panic. She screamed, \u201cMaster!\u201dHowever, her screams were quickly swallowed by the raging wind.Qi Yuan barely made it through the third bolt of lightning\u2026This was a helpless situation. The quantity and quality of the bolts of lightning had been set since Qi Yuan had begun his cultivation journey. Subsequently, Qi Yuan had injured his Dao base. This had caused him to lose the strength and power that he rightfully should have had when he reached the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital.This was why Qi Yuan was having such a hard time enduring the Heavenly Tribulation\u2014he could barely make it through the third bolt of lightning.A huge pit was left behind by that bolt of lightning. As Qi Yuan lay at the bottom of the pit, he used the last bit of Dharmic powers in his body to carry himself out of it. Standing below the Heavenly Tribulation, he raised his head to look at the even scarier, even bigger lightning spot.Fresh blood was flowing out of the wounds in his body, but his gaze was filled with determination!\u2018Heaven, how can you be so unfair?!\u2018Yet, I have no complaints towards you. Heaven and Earth follow the order of the Great Dao\u2019s cycle. This is all part of my fate. So what if I die?!\u2018However, there is one thing!\u2018I cannot die lying beaten and battered on the ground. My disciples are watching me. So what if their master is a useless piece of trash?! So what if their master cannot give them the protection that disciples of other peaks have?!\u2018I still have to die standing!\u2018I still need to maintain the pride of human cultivators!\u2018I still need to give Changshou and Ling\u2019e something to boast about. I need them to know that their master has the perseverance that is needed of a Dao Heart!\u2018What\u2019s more, I have the precious pill that my older disciple took great pains to make for me. I can use it to endure the last bolt of lightning!\u2019Qi Yuan took out the embroidered case and retrieved the pill. Without any hesitation, he swallowed it.\u2018Come, Heavenly Dao! I know that I am merely struggling in vain in the face of death. Still, I have to take this gamble. I have to make it to the last bolt of lightning! If I die by that last bolt of lightning, it should not be too embarrassing\u2026\u2019Inside the lightning spot, the power of Heaven and Earth congealed at a crazy rate. The fourth bolt of lightning was going to strike at any moment!\u201cAh!\u201d Qi Yuan shouted furiously. His hair and beard stood on the ends, and his entire body twisted in pain!\u201cCough!\u201dThe old Daoist priest lowered his head and coughed, spitting out a mouthful of blood. Astonished, he looked at his own body and found that wisps of sanguine glow were appearing.\u2018What is happening? Why am I starting to break down? Grand Pure One above, what is happening? What did this wretched disciple feed\u2026 me\u2026?\u2019The lightning spot, which had been growing insanely above his head moments ago, suddenly halted. The Tribulation Cloud stopped whirling as well.It was like this Heavenly Tribulation had great expectations of him, and wanted to perform well for its lover. \u03a5et, at the last moment, it realized that he was no more than an exhausted, middle-aged, mortal man. Suddenly, it decided to cut the performance.At once, Qi Yuan turned to look at his older disciple, who was grinning.The old Daoist priest\u2019s consciousness melted away. Like a snowman thrown into a furnace, he was reduced to liquid!His soul, body, and even his clothes turned into a puddle of \u2018blood-water\u2019, which floated in the air.The Tribulation Cloud trembled and turned into pure spiritual energy. The energy dissipated and left behind a ray of sunlight, which illuminated the Little Qiong Peak.All the bystanders were confused. They observed the spot where Qi Yuan melted away and focused on the pool of blood-water.All of a sudden, the ground emitted turbid energy. Three-colored immortal light shone from the clouds into the pool of blood-water.From out of nowhere, they heard bamboo string instruments playing a beautiful melody.The pure yet turbid energy slowly gathered, forming a human outline out of the blood-water.There was a series of explosions. Qi Yuan\u2019s figure appeared in the air once again, wearing the same clothes he was in before the Heavenly Tribulation began.The sanguine glow disappeared, and petals danced around the old Daoist priest\u2019s body. He stood on what looked like a muddy, magic cloud, as a faint lotus flower blossomed on top of his head, before melting into his body.Qi Yuan opened his mouth and breathed out a breath of fresh air. The aura in his body began to flow once again.The phenomena accompanying this Immortal Ascension seemed quite pathetic.At that moment, Qi Yuan seemed to understand something. He turned to face Li Changshou, his eyes filled with helplessness. Yet, they welled up slightly.\u2018Our roles as master and disciple must be cast aside for now.\u2019Qi Yuan\u2019s expression was complicated as he gave Li Changshou a Dao salute.Li Changshou quickly kept his bamboo slip, carving knife, paper doll, and pill, and returned the salute. For a long time, he did not dare to stand up.The wind carried sounds of multiple discussions\u2026\u201cDeliverance by Execution! He used Deliverance by Execution to become a Turbid Immortal!\u201d\u201cIt was an Immortal-Melting Pill! There are still people who know how to refine a pill like that?!\u201d\u201cJunior Brother actually chose this route. Not bad! At the very least, he survived.\u201d\u201cA Turbid Immortal. In fact, they are the same as most ordinary immortals. It\u2019s not easy to become a Heaven Immortal as well. Most of us will not be able to advance past the Perfected Immortal Realm anyway.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShortly after the Heavenly Tribulation ended, Qi Yuan went through a long, complex journey in his heart.In the beginning, he thought, \u2018Heh, I was delivered by execution under the Heavenly Tribulation and became a Turbid Immortal\u2026\u2018And this happened in front of everyone. I decisively ate an immortal pill that helped me employ Deliverance by Execution and used it to avoid the tribulation\u2026\u2018Hehehe, from now on, I cannot raise my head outside the sect again.\u2019Soon after that, Qi Yuan recalled the scene when his own disciple knelt down in front of him and handed him this immortal pill.\u2018Forget it. Changshou had good intentions.\u2018As his master, I kept thinking about the ideals of dying in the Heavenly Tribulation. I neglected the efforts my own disciples went to to make sure I survived.\u2018It must not have been easy for him to get this pill. Changshou had endured so much for this. He just broke through the Void Return Realm in the North Continent. How can I waste his effort?\u2018So what if I\u2019m a Turbid Immortal?\u2018The road ahead is not sealed. I\u2019ll be much stronger than if I were a Ghost Immortal, or if my soul was destroyed. I will be able to protect my two disciples, as well. That\u2019s enough.\u2019That was why Qi Yuan gave Li Changshou a Dao salute.Again, figures emerged from various places to congratulate Qi Yuan.Qi Yuan was stunned at first. Then, he cupped his hands and greeted them one by one, catching up with old friends he had not seen in a long time.\u2018Turbid Immortals are immortals too. I can live and enjoy tens of thousands of years. I can work hard to become a Perfected Immortal and take in more disciples. This will bring glory to my Little Qiong Peak!\u2019Qi Yuan slowly cheered himself up.At the same time, while he was surrounded by people congratulating him, Qi Yuan heard a voice transmission from his older disciple.\u201cMaster, if someone asks you what pill you ate to employ Deliverance by Execution, tell them it was an Immortal-Melting Pill.\u201cThe recipe to make this pill can be found in the second last bookshelf in the north-west corner of the Dao Sutra Outer Hall. It is recorded on sheepskin.\u201cAfter that, if people ask you if you have any spare Immortal-Melting Pills, you can give out a maximum of three pills. As much as possible, make sure that those people you promise are immortals who are reliable, close to you, and have a real need for the Immortal-Melting Pills.\u201cIt is very difficult to make these things. What\u2019s more, it can immediately poison immortals. One could easily get in trouble with these things.\u201dQi Yuan hesitated for a moment and then turned to face his two disciples. He subtly smiled and nodded, indicating that he understood Li Changshou\u2019s directions.Li Changshou felt the last weight on his chest lift. He was finally relieved and energized, and he was breathing smoothly once again. He turned to Ling\u2019e and said, \u201cJunior Sister, you wait here. If Master invites people in for tea and a chat, remember to serve them well.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e quickly asked, \u201cSenior Brother, where are you going? Aren\u2019t you celebrating with Master?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and answered, \u201cI\u2019m going to rest while waiting for Master to finish what he has to do. According to the traditions of the sect, Immortal Ascension is a huge matter. Many people will come forth to congratulate Master. We don\u2019t have to be anxious.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d answered Lan Ling\u2019e. \u201cQuickly, go and rest, Senior Brother. You have been working hard during this period. I will watch Master!\u201dThus, while many immortals rushed towards the Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou snuck away and hid in his Pill Chamber.He did not activate the huge array formation around the Pill Chamber. He only activated the array formations within 1,000 feet of it.He moved a rocking chair and sat in front of the Pill Chamber, looking out into the forest and the water body. His eyelids fluttered shut as he gently rocked back and forth.\u2018After working so hard for so long, Master has finally made it through the Heavenly Tribulation.\u2018After observing Master\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation, I feel more confident about making it through mine. I will wait for what I have accumulated to be enriched. Then, I will not need to suppress my cultivation level anymore. I can start to risk the Heavenly Tribulation.\u2018However, I cannot go through the Heavenly Tribulation inside the sect. Otherwise, at least half of the trump cards that I have worked so hard to hide in these 100 years would be exposed.\u2018Yet, speaking of this, Master\u2019s skills were really bad before he went through the Heavenly Tribulation. The Immortal-Melting Pill almost immediately melted his body and soul\u2026\u2019Li Changshou closed his eyes and hummed the immortal melody that he had heard when his master turned into an immortal. Soon, he entered the realm of enlightenment, halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness.He controlled his breathing as his soul merged with Heaven and Earth.A lotus flower with nine petals floated out of his chest. The lotus flower looked fresh, bright, and full of life as it held the Dao, which Li Changshou had comprehended. Everything looked mysterious yet natural\u2014it was hard to describe in words.This lotus flower slowly faded away with the wind. However, like a magnet, it pulled many more lotus flowers out of various parts of Li Changshou\u2019s body. They revolved around him, as Li Changshou\u2019s narrowed eyes reflected a sense of peace.Very quickly, Li Changshou regained his composure. He batted the surrounding lotus flowers away and sealed his own aura, which he had almost revealed.The Pill Chamber was not completely safe. If he wanted to cultivate, he had to go to the secret underground room.For all he knew, a Heaven Immortal as powerful and skilled as Exalted Wang Qing might be sweeping his immortal senses past the Little Qiong Peak.He lay back down on the chair and rested for a bit.A white cloud suddenly floated over from the lake in front of the mountain.Li Changshou immediately opened his eyes to observe it. When he saw the short Daoist on the white cloud, he quickly deactivated the array formations around the Pill Chamber and stood up to welcome him.\u201cYour disciple pays his greetings to Uncle-Master Jiu.\u201dJiu Wu smiled and chided. \u201cYour master is hosting a banquet and attending to guests, yet you are hiding here and slacking away. Your Junior Sister\u2019s slender legs are going to break from all the running around!\u201d\u201cYour disciple does not like crowds. I had no choice but to ask my skillful Junior Sister to work harder,\u201d replied Li Changshou, smiling. He waited for Jiu Wu to get closer to the Pill Chamber before he reactivated the tens of array formations around them. Cupping his hands, Li Chanshou said, \u201cUncle-Master, please take a seat inside.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I don\u2019t have time for that now. I must go out on a trip. I made some time before that to come here and tell you two things.\u201d Jiu Wu waved his hand, retrieved a jade slip from inside his sleeve, then tossed it to Li Changshou.Joyfully, Jiu Wu said, \u201cLook. See what this is. Don\u2019t say Uncle-Master only drank your dry wine without giving this \u2018friend of wine and meat\u2019 any benefits!\u201dLi Changshou was rendered speechless.\u2018Friends of meat and wine? We have only drunk wine together seven or eight times in the past two years. What\u2019s more, each time this Uncle-Master appeared, I used Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu\u2019s Ganges River\u2019s Dry Wine to entertain him.\u2019Using his left hand, Li Changshou reached out and grabbed the jade slip. He allowed it to float beside him as he used a wisp of spiritual awareness to analyze it.\u2018Oh? Volume One of the Inaction Sutra?\u2019Li Changshou felt slightly shocked. He raised his chin to look up at Jiu Wu, who remained on the cloud. \u201cUncle-Master, is this\u2026 appropriate?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking if it is appropriate?\u201d Jiu Wu grinned. \u201cThe unspoken rule in the sect is that the top 20 disciples of each generation will be allowed to try comprehending Volume One of the Inaction Sutra in advance. Ordinary disciples can only get a hold of this book after they ascend to immortality. You\u2019re probably in the Sixth Stage of Void Return now, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re most definitely one of the top ten disciples in the sect. I remember you seemed to have broken through another stage when we last drank together.\u201d\u2018The last time\u2026\u2019Li Changshou was helpless as well. In order to avoid going through the Heavenly Tribulation unprepared, he had to suppress his cultivation level and stop himself from reaching the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital.However, a few months ago, while he had been drinking with Jiu Wu, they had discussed poems. A strange feeling had suddenly washed over him, and he accidentally had an epiphany.It was a good thing that he still had three more minor realms as a buffer. What\u2019s more, at the time, Jiu Wu had been dazed from drinking.He heard Jiu Wu add, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I did not reveal the fact that you are at the Sixth Stage of Void Return. Volume One of the Inaction Sutra is the reward for this trip. I spent a lot of effort talking to the elder of the Reward Hall in order to get this in advance for you. That\u2019s why I brought it over here early.\u201cWhat do you say? Do you want to learn it? This is the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s main Dao heritage!\u201d\u201cI do,\u201d replied Li Changshou, smiling as he nodded. Yet, he handed the jade slip back to Jiu Wu. \u201cHowever, I have never liked going out of the mountain. I\u2019m afraid I will have to turn down Uncle-Master\u2019s good intentions.\u201dJiu Wu frowned and narrowed his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. How did you know you would have to go out?\u201d\u201cThe East Ocean\u2019s Dragon Palace invited us to the Demon-Sweeping Meet,\u201d answered Li Changshou, his expression serious. \u201cNews has been spreading within the sect. It would be difficult for me to remain in the dark. Many fellow, outstanding disciples are fighting for opportunities to go to the Demon-Sweeping Meet and make a name for themselves. Uncle-Master, why do you want a lazy person like me to add to the numbers?\u201dConfused, Jiu Wu asked, \u201cSince you know that people are fighting for this opportunity, why are you unwilling to go?\u201dLi Changshou mumbled under his breath for a couple of seconds and replied, \u201cWhen we went to the East Ocean to get rid of demons during the last Priming Meet, we killed several Prawn Soldiers and Crab Generals who were out of line. If the Immortal Du Sect sends disciples to the East Ocean again this time, the East Ocean\u2019s Dragon Palace will surely make life difficult for us. Uncle-Master, you know this. Your disciple really does not want to get involved in something as troublesome as this.\u201d\u201cYou are very observant!\u201d Jiu Wu laughed softly as he mumbled to himself on the cloud.Suddenly, he lowered the white cloud and said in a deeply worried tone, \u201cActually, I did not want to trouble you. However, Changshou, there are not many intelligent disciples in your generation. Even the most experienced disciple, Yuan Qing, got into trouble and executed.\u201cApart from the East Ocean\u2019s Dragon Palace, there are other immortal sects whom our disciples do not get along well with. Their disciples might make life difficult for ours there as well\u2026\u201cA few other elders are worried that our young disciples would not be able to take it. They might easily get agitated by their provocative words, and cause trouble that would make a joke out of us.\u201cOther people in the sect also have no idea that you, Li Changshou, are full of schemes\u2014cough\u2014they don\u2019t know that you, Martial Nephew Changshou, are hiding so much. However, I know that you are stable and reliable. You are also resourceful and decisive. That is why I thought of asking you to come along. When the need arises, you can guide your fellow disciples.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, I will be leading the team personally this time. A few elders in the sect will go along together as well. You will be absolutely safe. What do you say? Would you think about it? This is the Inaction Sutra we are talking about. It\u2019s the real secret to a long life.\u201dIndeed, the Inaction Sutra was tempting to Li Changshou, however\u2026\u201cUncle-Master, your disciple still wants to remain on the mountain and cultivate in peace.\u201dThe corners of Jiu Wu\u2019s lips twitched downwards. He sighed and looked up at the sky. \u201cForget it. Your Uncle-Master is not an evil man. I would not force you to do something you don\u2019t want to. Ai, I guess we have to rearrange the ranks of the disciples to fill up the gaps\u2026\u201dLi Changshou pondered slightly harder, obviously weighing the pros and cons carefully once again. Then, he nodded slowly and said in a low voice, \u201cYour disciple can show his face as a cultivator in the Second Stage of Void Return. I will also follow Uncle-Master\u2019s instructions and try my best to remind my fellow disciples on the trip when the need arises. However, if they do not listen to me, I will not be able to do anything more.\u201d\u201cHaha, don\u2019t worry. They would have no choice but to listen to you.\u201d Jiu Wu tossed the jade slip back to Li Changshou and said, \u201cTake this. Comprehend it well. Get to the Dao Requital Realm as soon as you can.\u201d\u2018Brat, I knew you would not take the bait unless I gave you some benefits. The elder of the Rewards Hall already gave me permission to pass this sutra onto you a year and a half ago. It\u2019s a good thing that I held back and used it at the right time.\u2019Once he finished speaking, Jiu Wu steered his cloud upwards, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. Then, he disappeared on his way.Li Changshou studied the jade slip in his hand and fell into deep thought.It was becoming more difficult to suppress his cultivation level in these two years. Once he reached the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital, he would not be able to control his advancement. He now had the Inaction Sutra, and he could look for a secluded place at the vast East Ocean.What\u2019s more, Volume One of the Inaction Sutra would be easy to get a hold of. It was not a deceptive half-book like The Nine Palms to Defeat Dragons. As long as he did not incur a loss this time, he would take it as a win.\u2026It was daybreak on the day after Qi Yuan ascended to immortality.Lan Ling\u2019e massaged her shoulders in exhaustion as she sat in front of the now-empty straw hut.The night before, her master had gone to attend a banquet at another peak with a bunch of Uncle- and Aunt-Masters she had never seen before. She had spent four hours after that cleaning the interior and exterior of her master\u2019s hut.\u201cAnnoying Senior Brother. You should have come to help!\u201dImmediately after she muttered this complaint, Lan Ling\u2019e saw a huge wine gourd in the sky in her peripheral vision. At once, she pouted.\u2018Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu is here to look for Senior Brother again\u2026 There must be something wrong with them! The longest interval between Aunt-Master\u2019s visits in these few years was merely 20 days! Hmph! We\u2019re both female cultivators. So what if you\u2019re a Perfected Immortal? That\u2019s not right. For a Perfected Immortal to mature to this extent is quite ridiculous\u2026\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e immediately wept and sobbed in her heart.\u2018Senior Brother must like\u2014\u2019\u201cExcuse me.\u201dA greeting suddenly sounded behind Lan Ling\u2019e. She subconsciously jumped, gripping a silver spike with her hand as her skirt fluttered in the wind. At once, she turned to face the source of the voice.Then, Lan Ling\u2019e hesitated.The person speaking was dressed in an ice-blue, one-shouldered dress. There was a broad-bladed sword in its sheath on her back. Her long hair was tied up in a simple ponytail and flowing in the wind. Her exquisite yet cold face looked extremely familiar.\u201cDoes Senior Brother Changshou live here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Is there something going on between Senior Brother and this beautiful Senior Sister Youqin as well?\u2019Li Changshou\u2019s only official Junior Sister, Lan Ling\u2019e, was seated cross-legged on a meditation cushion, in front of a short table in her straw hut. In her hands, she held a teacup filled with smoking-hot tea. She looked to be in deep thought.She glanced towards her left, where the Ice Mountain Youqin Xuanya sat. She was seated with her eyes closed as she meditated, waiting quietly for Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s senior brother to appear.Then, Lan Ling\u2019e glanced towards her right. There, her Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu was slumped across the table and snoring gently, looking like she had been deprived of sleep for a long time.The atmosphere was slightly awkward.\u2018Why are they all looking for Senior Brother? He had only been to the North Continent once to look for herbs. Now, two female cultivators have their eyes on him? If Senior Brother goes on the next Priming Meet one year later, wouldn\u2019t I run out of seats in my house?!\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e sighed in her heart. She did not understand which part of her senior brother was attractive. He was extremely cautious and afraid of death. \u2018Why would girls apart from me like him? What\u2019s more, the person on my left is the brightest star of our generation of disciples.\u2018On second thought, however\u2026\u2018Senior Sister Youqin is very beautiful indeed. Even when she\u2019s meditating, she looks captivating. If I were Senior Brother, I would not be able to resist her charm.\u2018Er, that\u2019s not right. Senior Brother might simply like\u2026\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e turned to glance at her right once again. Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu was slumped over the table.Lan Ling\u2019e looked up at the copper mirror behind the door, and could not help but rest her forehead on her hand.\u2018I probably would be able to mature further in the future. Maybe.\u2019The problem with her senior brother aside, as the owner of this straw hut, Lan Ling\u2019e felt that she could not let the atmosphere become even more awkward than it already was.\u201cSenior Sister Youqin,\u201d said Lan Ling\u2019e, smiling slightly. In a soft voice, she asked, \u201cWhat brought you to our Little Qiong Peak?\u201dYouqin Xuanya opened her eyes and answered in a gentle tone, \u201cAfter I went back to the mountain, I was punished and made to stay in seclusion on the Heaven-Breaking Peak to reflect on my actions. I did not get an opportunity to come here and thank Senior Brother Changshou. I just came out of my meditation today and realized that I had served my sentence. With Master\u2019s permission, I came to the Little Qiong Peak to thank Senior Brother Changshou.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e could not help but tilt her head. \u201cWhat did my Senior Brother do\u2026 to deserve your thanks?\u201d\u201cHe saved my life,\u201d answered Youqin Xuanya, pursing her lips gently. She lowered her head slightly, but Lan Ling\u2019e saw a hint of a spark in her treasure-like eyes. \u201cHe did that twice at that.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked.The expression on Youqin Xuanya\u2019s face was similar to the one on Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s each time she looked at the copper mirror and thought about her senior brother!\u2018Aunt-Master Jiu was already giving me immense pressure. Now, Youqin Xuanya seemed to drop out of the sky!\u2019Once again, Lan Ling\u2019e rested her forehead on her hand. Her affectionate heart cried out in frustration and anger. From time to time, she felt deep sorrow as well. All of a sudden, her entire body felt terrible.\u2018I have to win over Senior Brother at all costs as soon as possible to avoid sleepless nights\u2026\u2019\u201cEn? Little Ya, what are you doing here?\u201dJiu Jiu suddenly sputtered as she sat up and rubbed her eyes.Youqin Xuanya respectfully repeated what she had just said. As she did this, she stood up and bowed towards Jiu Jiu. She only sat back down after she got Jiu Jiu\u2019s permission to do so.After that, Jiu Jiu turned to face Lan Ling\u2019e. She pouted and then yawned. Finally, she asked, \u201cHas the huge array behind been deactivated?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e answered, \u201cNot yet, Aunt-Master Jiu. Senior Brother seems to be refining pills or cultivating. I sent him a voice transmission earlier to call him over, but he did not respond.\u201d\u201cAlright. We already set the time to refine pills\u2026 perhaps he is in the midst of comprehending something.\u201dJiu Jiu turned to face Lan Ling\u2019e, and then glanced at Youqin Xuanya. As if suddenly recalling something, she smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Little Ya is here. Ling\u2019e, let\u2019s play that!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e asked softly, \u201cAunt-Master, play what?\u201dJiu Jiu\u2019s eyes seemed to light up as she replied, \u201cThe game that we played together with your senior brother last month! DIdn\u2019t you say that it was the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s reserved item?\u201d\u201cWell, of course, we can. Please wait for a while, Aunt-Master.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e tapped her finger gently, causing the short table in front of her to shift towards the entrance. A huge space suddenly appeared between the three ladies.She took a clean beast\u2019s skin out of her storage Dharma artifact and laid it out in front of the three of them. On the beast\u2019s skin was a long path that led through the clouds. The cloud path was divided into little squares. There were also many peaks and huge ponds drawn around the path.Lan Ling\u2019e asked, \u201cDo you want to play, Senior Sister Youqin?\u201dYouqin Xuanya hesitated for a while as she looked at the \u2018map\u2019, not understanding what it was for.Jiu Jiu suddenly spoke up from the side. \u201cThis was made by Little Changshou. It\u2019s very interesting.\u201dAfter hearing this, Youqin Xuanya immediately nodded and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s Senior Brother Changshou\u2019s work, please allow me to be included.\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, please take a look at the rules. They are written here.\u201dYouqin Xuanya looked where Lan Ling\u2019e pointed and saw familiar handwriting. She read the rules out in a soft voice.\u201cRoad to Immortality, also known as \u2018Immortal Life Simulation\u2019 or \u2018Immortal Monopoly\u2019\u2026\u201cParticipants are to place the wooden game piece representing themselves on the starting point of the immortal path. Throw the die and move your wooden piece along on the path according to the number displayed on the die. Each time you land, different events would be activated on the road to immortality.\u201cAt the start of the game, each person will have 300 spirit stones. This will be represented in numbers. The first person to reach the end of the road will win. If any of the participants wants to end the game early, the person with the most number of spirit stones will win.\u201cRemember: do not use your immortal or spirit senses to check the various treasure chests. You are not allowed to use your Dharmic powers to control the die either.\u201dBy the time Youqin Xuanya finished reading the instructions, Lan Ling\u2019e had already set up the treasure chests of various colors by the side. There were many square cards in each treasure chest. Each of the chests also had all kinds of labels.After that, Lan Ling\u2019e retrieved three game pieces, each a different color. She placed them at the start of the path and then took out a six-sided die.Then, the game began.Youqin Xuanya thought, \u2018Where have I seen something like that before?\u2019 At that moment, she felt confused.Jiu Jiu smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll play one round, and you\u2019ll understand, Xuanya! Come, come, let\u2019s begin! I\u2019ll throw the die first!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e immediately stopped Jiu Jiu. \u201cWe have to play \u2018Rock, Paper, Scissors\u2019 to decide the order in which we throw the die.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. You lasses really know nothing about respecting your elders. Let\u2019s play Rock, Paper, Scissors!\u201dYouqin Xuanya looked at the bouncing Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu, and then at the serious-looking Lan Ling\u2019e, who had just lectured her Aunt-Master. She felt uncomfortable, but she went along with Rock, Paper, Scissors anyway to decide who was going to throw the die first\u2026She won!Youqin Xuanya had her turn first. She threw the die and got a five. Then, she held her wooden game piece and advanced five steps on the path in the clouds, before looking at the words underneath her game piece.\u201cYou performed exceedingly well when cleaning up the sect\u2019s stairs. The elders of the sect rewarded you with 20 spirit stones.\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, you can write \u2018+20\u2019 behind your current number of spirit stones!\u201d\u201cOh, alright,\u201d replied Youqin Xuanya, as she followed Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s instructions. She was beginning to understand the rules of the game.Jiu Jiu picked up the die and blew into her palm before throwing it carefully.When she saw the number three on the die, she immediately grinned. Then, Jiu Jiu moved her wooden piece forward three steps, landing on top of a square with a purple pentagram on it.\u201cQuickly, pass me the purple treasure chest! I\u2019ll pick a card, I\u2019ll pick a card!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e handed the purple treasure chest over, as Jiu Jiu reached in and groped about. Soon, she pulled out a wooden card.\u201cGood stuff, good stuff!\u201cLing\u2019e, it\u2019s your turn! Throw the die! Give your Aunt-Master a huge golden pill!\u201dYouqin Xuanya observed the wooden card closely and saw the words \u2018Me too\u2019 written on the front. There were two lines of words on the back.\u2018Once all the players in this round get their turn, the person with this card can choose to duplicate any of the benefits that they obtained in this round.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s my turn! Hehe!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e threw the die and got a two. It was an empty square\u2014she got nothing.Jiu Jiu cast her a contemptuous look, and then held out the wooden card to Youqin Xuanya, shouting, \u201cMe too!\u201cWhat is this? It\u2019s rare to get a card like that, yet I only got 20 spirit stones from it.\u201dEven Youqin Xuanya could not help but laugh softly. Very naturally, she picked up the die and threw it. This time, she triggered a random event. From the blue treasure chest, she pulled out a bamboo card.\u2018Found a Good Partner: You\u2019ve found a Dao companion who would spend the rest of your life with you. You held a wedding banquet. Other players give you 100 spirit stones each as a gift.\u2019Jiu Jiu and Lan Ling\u2019e whined at once.Youqin Xuanya gently exclaimed, \u201cCan I look at the rest of the cards? Senior Brother Changshou is indeed mysterious and creative!\u201dAlthough they were bursting with excitement, Jiu Jiu and Lan Ling\u2019e had no choice but to pause the game. They poured out the bamboo, wooden, copper, and jade cards from their respective boxes so that Youqin Xuanya could take a look.There were 12 cards for each material, targeting skills, random positive events, random negative events, and treasures, respectively.\u2018What does this look like\u2026?\u2019\u2018I\u2019m Too Distressed: You\u2019ve met with many difficulties on your cultivation journey. You are overcome with sorrow that you had to go through so much to get to this cultivation level. In order to comfort you, the other players each give you 50 spirit stones.\u2019\u2018Epiphany: Move one step forward.\u2019\u2018Distracted: You were distracted by poems and songs, and ended up shouting and dancing for too long. This delayed your cultivation journey. You lose the next two turns.\u2019\u2018Huge Cheat Card: You activate the Huge Cheat Technique and successfully cheat one target of your choice. You get either 200 spirit stones or any treasure of your choice from this person.\u2019\u201cWait, wait, wait, wait! Did Senior Brother Changshou make all of these?\u201d asked Youqin Xuanya, shocked. The two ladies beside her could only nod in affirmation.\u201cStop looking, Xiaoya! Let\u2019s continue!\u201d\u201cYes, Aunt-Master. Your disciple has gone overboard. This thing is extremely interesting.\u201d\u201cPui, pui! Look at me! Haha, I get to pick another card! Appear, \u2018Me Too\u2019!\u201d\u201cAunt-Master Jiu, you cannot cheat.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t. Do I need to cheat when playing with the both of you?\u201dSlowly, the straw hut was filled with laughter and jokes. The awkward atmosphere that was present before soon disappeared.It was evening time.Li Changshou had just advanced another small step in his cultivation journey after having read Volume One of the Inaction Sutra. Slowly, he walked out of the forest.He had been in the secret room the entire time, but now, he had his own aura solidified. Nobody would be able to see his true cultivation level.From afar, he could hear laughter coming from the straw huts. He expanded his spiritual awareness and discovered Youqin Xuanya.\u2018Toxic\u2026 Why is she here?\u2019After some thought, Li Changshou quietly walked back into the Pill Chamber. The gentle breeze carried in the joyous laughter.He heard Jiu Jiu\u2019s loud and carefree laugh. \u201cHahaha! Me too! Your Aunt-Master is going to be rich!\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s laugh was more restrained, but she whined uncharacteristically, \u201cAi, I\u2019m really unlucky. Your disciple got \u2018Distracted\u2019 again.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e, who was emerging victorious in this round, smiled brightly as she said to the other two ladies, \u201cI got \u2018I\u2019m Too Distressed\u2019! It\u2019s time to collect spirit stones!\u201dLi Changshou could not help but laugh softly. He activated the array formations on the outside and thought about having to set out towards the East Ocean in a few days.\u2018I\u2019ll go and check my storage Dharma artifacts again. With Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu\u2019s help these few years, I\u2019ve managed to produce several poisonous pills that can kill even Perfected Immortals. I will deal with these pills later on and turn them into poisonous powder or fluid. They will be more convenient in battle. Although I will not need to use them this time, it never hurts to be more prepared.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the morning, Li Changshou finally returned to the vicinity of the straw hut after working throughout the night in the Pill Chamber.Before he came close to the straw hut, he faintly smelled wine. He expanded his spiritual awareness to look into his junior sister\u2019s room, and then could not help but smack his forehead.\u2018I should make a detour.\u2019The scene in the straw house was not bad.Various cards from the Immortal Life Simulation were scattered across the ground, along with the \u2018Poker\u2019 cards, which Li Changshou had made for his junior sister several years ago.These cards were quite extravagant. Li Changshou had used the special paper, which had been used to create his paper dolls. This paper came from the sap of a precious tree, and the manufacturing process was extremely complicated.It was obvious that these people had been playing all night. At last, they had been knocked unconscious by the wine that Jiu Jiu had produced\u2026Li Changshou\u2019s spiritual awareness detected a huge sword on the ground, along with a long skirt, a blouse, and several shoes and socks.Jiu Jiu and Lan Ling\u2019e both lay on the mattress, snoring. Jiu Jiu was hugging Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s thigh, while the latter was hugging Jiu Jiu\u2019s jade-like arm.Youqin Xuanya was lying down quite elegantly in the corner of the mattress. However, in her hand, she held\u2026 someone\u2019s pink undergarment.\u2018I cannot look. I cannot look.\u2019Li Changshou activated the array formation next to the straw hut, and then turned around and walked towards the willow beside the lake. He retrieved two incomplete paper dolls and used his Dharmic powers to work on them.Man-Forming Paper Cutouts was considered an advanced mystical ability. It was recorded in the Dao sects\u2019 36 Ways of the Big Dipper. It was only by chance that Li Changshou had managed to learn this mystical ability.50 years had passed since he had learned this ability, and he had only achieved initial success.After Li Changshou became an immortal, the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts would become truly powerful. The paper dolls he created would contain a bit of his essence soul, and he would truly be able to move out of his own body for a limited amount of time.Man-Forming Paper Cutouts was also one of the mystical abilities of his main cultivation. He could hurt his enemies without putting himself in danger. It was perfect for him.The other array formations, talismans, pills, and poisons were just his side-endeavors. They could be considered hobbies and extra ways in which he could protect himself and get on with his true pursuit.Half a day later, Li Changshou kept his two new paper dolls. He glanced at the straw hut and discovered that there was no sign that the three ladies had regained consciousness.\u2018Master has not returned from his banquet either. I guess he will be out for a long time.\u2019His master had only become a Turbid Immortal, but his status within the sect had obviously improved.People who had not ascended to immortality were mere mortals, who could live no longer than 3,000 years.The people whom Qi Yuan knew in his early days had maintained a distance from him in these hundreds of years for various reasons. It could have been that they did not see as much value in Qi Yuan as they did initially, or that they did not want to feel too sad by Qi Yuan\u2019s passing, or that they did not want to give Qi Yuan undue pressure.However, since Qi Yuan was now a Turbid Immortal, if all went well in the future, he could become a Perfected Immortal.Although his reputation suffered, he now had a long life to look forward to. The friends that Qi Yuan made back then returned once again.People in immortal sects were quite practical as well.\u2018Master\u2019s cultivation journey from now on would be a difficult problem as well.\u2019As he thought about this, Li Changshou suddenly turned to look outside the mountain.Whoosh\u2026There was the sound of something cutting through the sky. Li Changshou immediately hid on the other side of the willow, raised his left arm, and pointed his left hand towards the little jade sword, which was shooting towards him. The jade sword stopped in the air 100 feet away from him.A middle-aged man\u2019s hoarse voice sounded from inside the jade sword. \u201cLittle Changshou of the Little Qiong Peak, come to the Bai Fan Hall for a discussion as soon as possible.\u201dLi Changshou answered, \u201cAt your command, Master.\u201dThe jade sword immediately turned around and towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak.A while later, two more jade swords flew towards Li Changshou from the same direction. However, these headed straight into his junior sister\u2019s straw hut.At once, realization dawned on Li Changshou.He shook his head and mounted a white cloud, advancing ahead of the rest. He wanted to avoid Jiu Jiu and Youqin Xuanya, who were both headed to the Bai Fan Hall as well.\u2026This gathering probably concerned the trip to the East Ocean for the Demon-Sweeping Meet.In order to avoid attracting any attention, Li Changshou sat under a tree outside the hall for some time.Indeed, no one noticed him.Ten-odd figures appeared in the south-west corner of the Bai Fan Hall. Li Changshou finally walked in and blended into the shadows in the corner.\u2018Uncle-Master Jiu Wu is devious, petty, narrow-minded, and likes taking advantage of others. However, at the very least, he has some good points, such as being a man of his word.\u2019At that moment, in the eyes of others, Li Changshou was an \u2018exemplary\u2019 disciple in the Second Stage of Void Return. Jiu Wu had not revealed Li Changshou\u2019s true cultivation level as being the Sixth Stage of Void Return.When Li Changshou arrived, six of the top ten disciples of his generation were already there. There were also six or seven Perfected Immortals who were over 1,000 years old.The various immortal sects naturally saw huge events like the Demon-Sweeping Meet as arenas of competition, since various immortal sects would be gathered. How could these sects show off their disciples\u2019 talent and potential? They could do so by showing their disciples\u2019 cultivation levels and ages.If one was of a young age, but with a high cultivation level, it would show that he had a high level of talent and comprehension. This would bring glory to his sect.This was why Jiu Jiu would never miss events like these unless she happened to be in seclusion.Li Changshou waited for a while inside the hall, as Perfected Immortals kept walking in. Two or three more young disciples entered.When Jiu Jiu and Youqin Xuanya finally arrived, there were a total of 11 young disciples and 16 Perfected Immortals.These represented all the people who were asked to gather here today.Elder Ge, who was in charge of expeditions outside the sect, arrived together with two other elders. They began to explain the purpose of their gathering in detail.Elder Ge said, \u201cThe East Ocean\u2019s Dragon Palace is organizing a Demon-Sweeping Meet at the Coast of the East Ocean. They have invited the main immortal sects in the East Continent to join them. The Immortal Du Sect is among those invited.\u201cI believe you have all seen or heard about the wretched dragon invading our sect earlier.\u201cOn top of that, this wretched dragon purposely gave us the wrong date for the Meet. He wanted to see our Immortal Du Sect make a fool of ourselves.\u201cFortunately, the various immortal sects in the East Continent look out for one another. We found out long ago that the Meet will take place in seven days. In four days, our Immortal Du Sect will head towards the East Ocean together with the other immortal sects.\u201cThe Sect Master has given orders for Exalted Wang Qing to lead our disciples this time. Other elders who have borne fruit from the Heaven Immortal Dao will follow along\u2026\u201cAll of you, Perfected Immortals, will follow along as well.\u201dOnce Elder Ge finished speaking, he scanned the 27 people in front of him. Then, he spoke again.\u201cThe Dragon Palace is organizing this Demon-Sweeping Meet for none other than three purposes.\u201cFirstly, they want to draw a clear boundary between the East Ocean and the Coast of the East Ocean.\u201cSecondly, they want to recover their lost glory from the various immortal sects who went to the East Ocean to get rid of demons the last time.\u201cThirdly, they want to give their dragon disciples a chance to show off their military strength.\u201cThe dragon race will surely hold up certain treasures for good luck during this Demon-Sweeping Meet. Young disciples should constantly share learning points with one another and defend and attack accordingly.\u201cThe ten of you\u2026\u201dElder Ge scanned the ten young disciples standing at the back and then glanced at the corner in which Li Changshou was standing. He corrected himself.\u201cThe eleven of you have the highest cultivation level in your generation. You are\u2026 er, the sharpest as well.\u201cA few years ago, we went to the East Ocean to get rid of demons. The Dragon Palace will surely target us during this Meet. Other immortal sects whom we have feuds with will also create stumbling blocks for us in secret. They want to watch you, young disciples, make a fool of yourselves.\u201cRemember this! You cannot bring shame to the Immortal Du Sect. You cannot throw aside the poise of the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools!\u201cIf someone challenges you in secret, do not bother about them. Let them witness your prowess while you officially swap pointers with them during battle!\u201cThe various immortal sects had a discussion earlier. The younger generation of disciples from the East Continent, who will be heading to the East Ocean, are all under 150 years old. Few of them are in the Dao Requital Realm.\u201cIf you are able to obtain those treasures, take them as individual rewards for your efforts.\u201cDo you understand?\u201dMany of the eleven disciples looked overjoyed. Together, they answered, \u201cYour disciples will bear your teachings in mind, Elder Ge.\u201dElder Ge nodded and mumbled to himself for a while. Then, he said, \u201cThere is one more thing. Exalted Wang Qing intentionally instructed me on this\u2026\u201dEveryone kept quiet and listened closely.\u201cWhere is Li Changshou of the Little Qiong Peak?\u201d\u201cYour disciple is here,\u201d answered Li Changshou. He cursed in his heart. He had indeed underestimated how sly the rascal Jiu Wu could be. However, he remained neutral as he bowed.Elder Ge said in a low voice, \u201cAll the young disciples must listen to your instructions during this expedition. You will be\u2026 the leader of the younger team.\u201dAt that moment, not only did the ten other disciples look confused, but the 16 Perfected Immortals also turned around to size up Li Changshou.\u2018Why is a disciple in the Second Stage of Void Return being made the leader?\u2019Li Changshou sensed everyone else staring at him. The corners of his lips twitched downwards.\u2018He\u2019s doing this on purpose. Jiu Wu must be doing this on purpose! This short Daoist is forcing me to expose my trump cards!\u2019Before this, Li Changshou thought that there wouldn\u2019t be many problems even if he followed the team along to the East Ocean. This was because there would be Heaven Immortals and Perfected Immortals in the sect protecting them.At the same time, he hoped to find a vast land with few people near the East Ocean, where he could seclude himself and endure the Heavenly Tribulation.Little did Li Changshou know that Jiu Wu had set up a trap for him!Before this, Li Changshou had hoped that he would not incur any losses on this trip. Now, it looked like he would lose blood for sure\u2026Jiu Jiu asked happily, \u201cHow did Master know about this rascal?\u201dHowever, a few disciples and Perfected Immortals from other peaks could not hold in their questions any longer. They were about to start their questioning when Li Changshou spoke up.\u201cYour disciple thinks this is inappropriate.\u201d Li Changshou spoke quickly. He was frowning, and his head was lowered. His aura was slightly messed up, and beads of perspiration formed on his forehead.He spoke again in a low voice. \u201cI beg Elder to retract his orders.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Elder Ge frowned. \u201cAre you unsatisfied with Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s orders?\u201d\u201cYour disciple would not dare, but there is something fishy about this.\u201d Li Changshou kept his head lowered. He hesitated for a while and asked softly, \u201cYour disciple will venture boldly and ask whether Exalted Wang Qing gave these orders himself, or whether Uncle-Master Jiu Wu passed them down?\u201dElder Ge frowned and said, \u201cJiu Wu passed them down.\u201dLi Changshou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart, and carefully changed his expression to look slightly panicked and slightly helpless, as if to say, \u201cI knew this was the case.\u201dJiu Wu must have used Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s name on purpose. He had probably not informed Exalted Wang Qing about something as small as that, which only concerned the younger disciples.Creating a fake story like that would mean nothing to Jiu Wu. Not only would Exalted Wang Qing not pursue the matter, but he might even lie on behalf of his beloved disciple if need be. One could say that Jiu Wu was merely acting first and reporting later.However, this left a big enough gap for Li Changshou to work with.Li Changshou immediately decided on his counter-attack.\u2018Uncle-Master, since you tried to set me up, don\u2019t blame me for returning the favor!\u2019Leading the younger team would be akin to becoming the shepherd of the younger generation. This was very significant, and it would definitely push Li Changshou to the heart of the struggle.Once word got out, immortals and younger disciples from various peaks would probably have their eyes on Li Changshou. Trouble would also come after him, wave after wave!He could not take on a task like that!Li Changshou looked extremely guilty as he sighed and said, \u201cI won\u2019t hide it from Elder. In recent years, your disciple has gotten much closer to Uncle-Master Jiu Wu of the Heaven-Breaking Peak. We have gotten into the habit of appreciating wine together.\u201cBefore this, while Uncle-Master Jiu Wu and I were drinking wine together, he joked drunkenly that he could make even an unknown and mediocre disciple like me become exalted by the other disciples in the sect.\u201cI did not think that Uncle-Master Jiu Wu would take his own words so seriously. I guess to protect his own pride, he made such an arrangement. I am now extremely terrified.\u201dElder Ge frowned deeply, but a look of realization illuminated the other disciples\u2019 faces.\u2018So that was what happened\u2026\u2019At once, the stares lost their enmity. Most people were surprised that a sect attendant like Jiu Wu would use his power in such an unrestrained manner. At the same time, they felt pity for Li Changshou.Jiu Jiu could not help but mumble, \u201cWhy is Fifth Senior Brother so childish?! Seriously!\u201dJiu Wu, who was standing thousands of kilometers away, could not help but sneeze continuously while he flew.In the Bai Fan Hall, Li Changshou sighed again and said, \u201cYour disciple does not dare to put Elder in a spot. I also do not dare to blame Uncle-Master Jiu Wu for his good intentions.\u201cHowever, your disciple cannot take on such a responsibility.\u201cElder, would you please appoint another disciple with outstanding skills and character to lead the team? I will be thick-skinned and continue to travel to the Coast of the East Ocean together with the team.\u201cIf Exalted Wang Qing really gave these orders, your disciple would not shrink from my responsibility, and I would follow those orders to the best of my ability. I would not hesitate to risk my life for the sect.\u201cHowever, if Uncle-Master Jiu Wu is just playing a trick on me, your disciple will not dare to masquerade as a leader. I can only hope that I would at least be a token member of the group.\u201cElder, I hope you will wisely analyze this situation!\u201dOnce he finished speaking, Li Changshou lowered his head and bowed. He did not stand up again for a long time.The other immortals felt sorrowful. All of them thought that Jiu Wu had really played a trick on this poor disciple.\u2018It must not be easy.\u2019One of the female disciples even gently said, \u201cJunior Brother Changshou, why don\u2019t you be the leader? We understand your situation. We will not complain.\u201dThe other disciples nodded in agreement.\u201cChangshou makes sense,\u201d said Elder Ge. His eyes were filled with admiration for Li Changshou.Elder Ge added, \u201cCoincidentally, Jiu Wu has gone to the Middle Continent, and I cannot contact him. It will not be appropriate to bother Senior Brother Wang Qing about this either. Well, as you said, we will find another leader.\u201dOnce Elder Ge finished speaking, Youqin Xuanya stepped forward, cupped her hands, and bowed. In a determined voice, she said, \u201cYour disciple is willing to bear the burden!\u201dLi Changshou felt slightly surprised. \u2018Why does Toxic\u2026 seem to understand my intentions today? She has indeed grown from her years in seclusion. Her toxicity has dissipated\u2026\u2019Before Li Changshou could heave a sigh of relief, Youqin Xuanya spoke again.\u201cI hope that Elder will form two teams. Senior Brother Changshou and I can share the responsibility. That would please both sides!\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dLi Changshou immediately choked.\u2018F*ck! Her toxicity did not dissipate. It has become worse!\u2019Just then, Youqin Xuanya turned to glance at Li Changshou. Her eyes were filled with determination, and she looked extremely serious about this plan. However, she also looked slightly shy.\u2018Leave it to me, Senior Brother Changshou. Xuanya will not put you in a spot.\u2019At that moment, Li Changshou felt like he was being torn apart\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Changshou stood in a neutral position on an ordinary-looking white cloud. He drifted at ordinary altitude and returned to the Little Qiong Peak in an ordinary manner.Yet, his heart felt far from the peace he was expressing.At first, he had successfully averted the responsibility of leading the team. He had not expected Youqin Xuanya to kick the role back to him out of nowhere.Soon after that, she had even locked the door shut and placed two Heaven-Immortal-grade seals over it.Fortunately, Li Changshou had already dumped the blame on Jiu Wu. He painted himself to be an innocent victim who had been played by his uncle-master. Now, he was not in that much danger.As for ruining Jiu Wu\u2019s reputation, he could not be blamed. Jiu Wu had set up the trap first. Li Changshou had only accidentally kicked the short Daoist\u2019s head when he was trying to climb out of the pit.In any case, nobody would stand up and fight against one of the Nine Jiu Immortals. One could say that the matter had come to a close.Li Changshou pondered deeply in his heart why Jiu Wu would do something like that.\u2018Perhaps the short Daoist found it fun.\u2019Jiu Wu had tried to encourage Li Changshou to make a name for himself while they had been drinking together the past few times. Jiu Wu had said that this would give him important opportunities to be nurtured.Li Changshou could also feel that this uncle-master had a strange sense of responsibility towards him. For some reason, he wanted to make Li Changshou expose the fact that he was in the Sixth Stage of Void Return by leading the team this time. From there, he hoped the sect would pay more attention to Li Changshou, and do more to nurture this outstanding disciple into an immortal seedling.\u2018Yet, to do it this way\u2026 is meaningless! You\u2019re purely causing trouble for me!\u2019Li Changshou could not help but rub his temples.His cultivation level was his biggest trump card. Even revealing a bit of his true cultivation level would increase the threat to his safety. Other people would begin to pay attention to him and even fear him.The Immortal Du Sect looked harmonious on the outside, but there were many undercurrents. There were only that many resources inside the sect and yet the number of disciples on the various peaks kept increasing. The competition between the peaks was extraordinarily intense.\u2018Do you think I don\u2019t know how my master got injured back then?\u2019He did not have the exact evidence for it. However, after theorizing and verifying, he concluded that someone in the sect had set up his master!Even after this, his master refused to talk about what had happened. Li Changshou guessed that the person who had plotted against his master was still relatively powerful in the sect. He must have wanted to paralyze Li Changshou\u2019s master and break the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s line of succession. However, Li Changshou\u2019s master had worked hard to get back on the cultivation path and had not given that rascal another chance.Immortal Du Sect\u2019s rules were very strict. Disciples who had not ascended to immortality but who wanted to go out on expeditions had to first report to the Bai Fan Hall to make preparations. They were only allowed to step out of the mountain-protecting array after they got permission.If these people were immortal seedlings who harbored great potential, the sect would even send Essence Immortals or Perfected Immortal out with them.80 to 90 years ago, Li Changshou had already guessed that his master had probably gotten injured under one of a few circumstances.First, he had gone out on an expedition.Second, he had been in a competition within the sect.The chances of it being the latter were higher.A few thousand years ago, when Jiu Wu had entered the sect, he had taken Exalted Wang Qing as his master. He had started in a better position than most and advanced extremely quickly. He was from the strongest line of succession in the Heaven-Breaking Peak. He had been so sheltered that he could not see \u2018dogs\u2019, who would do anything for personal gain, in the sect.Yet, Li Changshou could not help but guard against them. The Little Qiong Peak was the weakest in the sect. This made it necessary for Li Changshou to see through the peaceful environment and hold back one\u2014cough\u2014two, three\u2026 or even ten moves.\u2018Forget it. What has happened has happened. There\u2019s no suitable way to turn down this role.\u2019If he pleaded illness or said that he was showing signs of Qi Deviation, there was an 80% chance that the experts in the sect would step in and investigate his claims.If he acted like he was having an epiphany at such a critical juncture, and insisted that he needed to go into seclusion to cultivate, there was a 90% chance that someone would inspect his body as well.\u2018What if I beat Ling\u2019e until she is half-dead and then say that I have to remain behind to take care of her?\u2018Er, I\u2019m just joking, I\u2019m just joking. I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt her. After all, she is the adorable junior sister whom I watched grow up\u2026\u2018Alright.\u2018I have a backup plan.\u2019In four days, he would depart for the East Ocean. As long as he did not speak unnecessarily and allowed Youqin Xuanya to become the true and indisputable leader of the younger team, Li Changshou would be able to remain inconspicuous.For this, he decided\u2026 to adopt a certain persona. He would act elegantly, maintain a mild temperament, and dress plainly.\u2018Speaking of which, when Youqin Xuanya went to the North Continent the last time, she probably suffered some kind of trauma. She went into seclusion for several years once she returned to the Heaven-Breaking Peak, and kept achieving breakthroughs in her cultivation level. She is now already in the Eighth Stage of Void Return. She has far surpassed her senior brother from the Heaven-Breaking Peak, who had been at the top in terms of cultivation.\u2018That\u2019s probably why Youqin Xuanya dared to step up today and take over the role by force.\u2019Achieving continuous breakthroughs was something that one could chance upon but not seek. It was not necessarily a good thing either. For all Li Changshou knew, this was a foreshadow of the Heavenly Tribulation that Youqin Xuanya would have to endure in the future.The principle of more haste less speed applied to cultivation as well. The realm that Li Changshou was in was the same. He had to advance slowly and steadily, step-by-step, one breakthrough at a time.About 60 years ago, when he had broken through the Void Return Realm in secret, Li Changshou had witnessed how the Heavenly Tribulation had disintegrated someone from his sect.After that, he had begun to suppress his own cultivation level. He focused on comprehending the details at each realm, constantly revising what he already knew in order to learn more.He made sure that he had a complete and solid grasp of every bit of progress. Only then would he take the next step. Also, he would do so cautiously so that he could increase the chances of survival through the Heavenly Tribulation.At that time, Li Changshou had already made up his mind. Even if it took him 200 years to set a firm foundation, he would do whatever was necessary to prepare for the Heavenly Tribulation.Yet, for some reason, his cultivation progress did not slow down because of this decision. Instead, it became increasingly hard for him to suppress his cultivation.This was probably the unique trial that the Great Dao wanted to put him through.\u2026When he returned to the Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou saw his junior sister cultivating.Li Changshou remained silent under a tree, and then shook his head and blessed Jiu Wu. He hoped the latter would have children soon, and that whether they turned out to be male or female, they would be eight feet tall.Then, Li Changshou turned around and went back to business.He began to create a folding Faraday Cage.His master\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation had already proved that the Faraday Cage could fend off and weaken the lightning\u2019s power.The Faraday Cage Li Changshou had made for his master had been blasted apart after channeling the first bolt of lightning away. However, he knew that the Heavenly Dao definitely permitted this thing.One Faraday Cage could fend off one bolt of lightning?That meant he had to prepare nine in order to make it through the Heavenly Tribulation without getting injured.At that, Li Changshou could only shake his head and smile.To his master, enduring the Heavenly Tribulation meant facing death. Yet, to Li Changshou, as long as he could be 90% sure that he would not die, it would be the greatest benefit he ever gained in his cultivation journey!First, the Heavenly Tribulation was the critical step for cultivators to turn from caterpillars to butterflies.Once the thunder tribulation descended, one would sublime.The mortal body would be transformed into an immortal one, and the soul would form an immortal nascent. The one enduring the Heavenly Tribulation would be transported to a whole new world. At that moment, he would become a stronger ant in the Primordial World.Apart from that, the Heavenly Tribulation was a chance to meet the Great Dao face to face.If a cultivator could gain insight while enduring the tribulation, there was a chance that, at that moment, between life and death, they could see the difficulties of their cultivation journey ahead. Then, they might be able to ascend.Immortal Du Sect\u2019s records showed that Exalted Wang Qing had broken through the Perfected Immortal Realm an hour after enduring the Heavenly Tribulation. He had skipped the Essence Immortal Realm, but it had not resulted in an unstable foundation. Instead, he continued to progress in his cultivation journey with irresistible force.The ancient texts also described cultivators ascending after enduring the Heavenly Tribulation in ancient times. Some of them had even managed to break through the Heaven Immortal Realm.Of course, Li Changshou did not harbor such high hopes. He was aiming for much less.He wanted to make it through the Heavenly Tribulation safely and make sure that his Dao base was complete and flawless.In order to scale this high mountain of longevity, he had to have a firm foundation!Li Changshou was creating this Faraday Cage to help him endure the final second last bolt of lightning.He was certain that he had to endure the first few bolts because he wanted to reap the greatest benefits. Also, he was 100% confident that he could make it through them!To ensure he was prepared for a breakdown of apparatus, this foldable Faraday Cage was the sixth one he was making in those two days.With this powerful piece of equipment, he could be more assured of survival. In fact, he was 99% sure that he would at least be able to survive the Heavenly Tribulation.In addition, he could make time to study the Inaction Sutra. Once he broke through the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital with that strong foundation, he could be 95% sure that he would smoothly endure the Heavenly Tribulation.These were enough to make him put his life on the line.It was also worth mentioning that in the early days of his cultivation journey, when Li Changshou had been calculating the chances of him making it through the Heavenly Tribulation, he had shamelessly assumed that he would be enduring nine bolts of lightning.He was putting pressure on himself to remain humble and keep working hard.Why was this shameless?After all, only prodigies would endure nine bolts of lightning in the Heavenly Tribulation. Li Changshou did not think he was a cultivation prodigy.It was just that while other people rested, he would use his spare time to train hard.\u201cOh, yes! There\u2019s another urgent matter. I\u2019ll note it down.\u201dLi Changshou suddenly recalled something and stopped working on his cage. He retrieved a jade slip and used his spiritual awareness to write a title and a paragraph underneath it.Etiquette to Adhere to When Enduring the Heavenly TribulationThe Heavenly Tribulation is the Heavenly Dao\u2019s training for cultivators. Although the Heavenly Dao is completely impartial, the Dao Ancestors probably gave the Heavenly Tribulation a hint of humanity when they formed it.I will keep in mind the principles of being safe rather than sorry and not aiming for outstanding results but merely to avoid mistakes. When facing the Heavenly Tribulation, I have to pay attention not to point the middle finger or curse. I also cannot countdown the number of lightning bolts in my heart. I must keep telling myself that the Heavenly Dao is a great gift and the intersection of risk and opportunity. It is the fundamental calamity that proves everyone is equal.I\u2019ll first give the Heavenly Tribulation a Dao salute\u2026\u201cShould I thank it? What if the Heavenly Dao delivers the first bolt of lightning while I am too busy thanking it?\u2019 Li Changshou mumbled to himself for a while and then continued writing with his spiritual senses.He had worked so hard and paid attention to such detail. Although he was already very skilled, he still had to prepare for the other aspects of enduring the tribulation several times.Of course, he could relax with the Inaction Sutra.\u2026Four days passed quickly. Li Changshou had been working for three and a half days in his Pill Chamber. He spent the remaining half a day assembling everything.On the journey, 16 Perfected Immortals sat together with 11 disciples on a huge, white cloud. They each sat cross-legged, minding their own space.A few Heaven Immortals took a cloud each. Those clouds floated above, giving them a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation below.Exalted Wang Qing was on the lotus-flower-shaped cloud, right in front of the group.With so many experts guarding them, Li Changshou felt comfortable.He was seated in the corner, enjoying the gentle breeze in the sky. His spiritual awareness was scanning his surroundings, and he held two paper dolls between his fingers.As the true leader of the group, Youqin Xuanya was seated right in front. She was dressed in her favorite fiery red dress and had a delicate Phoenix tail hairpin on her head. Once again, she looked like a blooming Fire Spirit Flower. Her attractiveness and extraordinary pride\u2026As the fake leader, Li Changshou hid in a corner in the back. He kept his eyes narrowed as he meditated. His robe was clean, but it was very ordinary. Anyone could get their hands on a robe like that from the Bai Fan Hall.Yet, it was obvious that Youqin Xuanya did not want to remain in front alone and be the image of par excellence.Less than an hour after they started cruising, Youqin Xuanya elegantly and slowly stood up. She walked with her large sword on her back towards the empty space next to Li Changshou.\u201cSenior Brother Changshou,\u201d said Youqin Xuanya in a low voice. \u201cCan I sit here?\u201dLi Changshou thought, \u2018You can sit down, but I\u2019ll move somewhere else later on.\u2019\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, don\u2019t stand on ceremony. Please.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and pointed to a spot slightly further away from him.Youqin Xuanya nodded subtly, picked up her dress slightly, and then sat down, cross-legged. She looked extremely elegant as she did so.Li Changshou subconsciously glanced at her hands\u2026She was wearing a thick pair of gloves, which did not seem to match her dress.It was quite considerate of her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We should work together and protect the reputation of the Immortal Du Sect.\u201d\u201cYes. Junior Sister Youqin is right.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Changshou, before the elder left, he told me that later on, the Heaven Immortal Elders within the sect will go to the main platform, while we will go to the tribunal platform. Things will easily go wrong during this period. We have to be careful.\u201d\u201cYes. Junior Sister Youqin is right.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Changshou, how has your cultivation been all these years?\u201d\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, you are\u2026 I\u2019m doing well with my cultivation. Everything is pretty smooth,\u201d Li Changshou answered with a smile and added another sentence in his heart, \u2018It was thanks to the fact that you were punished to ponder over your mistake.\u2019Youqin Xuanya pursed her thin lips. She couldn\u2019t find a new topic at the moment but tried to keep the conversation going.Unfortunately, she had spent most of her life cultivating. She could not just recite a paragraph of the Dao sutra.Perhaps, Li Changshou saw her thinking hard, so he took the initiative to say, \u201cYou should rest first since you still have a huge responsibility later on.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Youqin Xuanya nodded her head in agreement. She closed her eyes and pursed her lips before feeling relaxed and restored to her usual self.Because of Li Changshou\u2019s words, those young disciples, who were secretly observing the two of them, felt comfortable towards his self-knowledge.There was still some distance to the Coast of the East Ocean after flying for four hours. Along the way, the Immortal Du Sect encountered seven to eight teams that represented their sects.In order to deal with the invitation by the East Ocean\u2019s Dragon Palace to the Meet, various immortal sects that received the invitation had secretly discussed various aspects.For example, they had sent more than ten disciples and Perfected Immortals with around 30 people in total this time.This would show that the human cultivators did not value this Demon-Sweeping Meet so much. However, they still gave the Dragon Palace some respect, so they reluctantly attended this event.As another example, they had to be careful when exchanging pointers during this Meet and try avoiding the sanguine glow. The immortal sects also had to put their feud on usual days aside temporarily and could not make a fool out of themselves for the dragon race to see.There were many similar agreements in place, as well.The main purpose that these immortal sects had made these agreements was to let human cultivators have dignity before the dragon race and manifest their presence.There was a slightly weird agreement among them\u2014the young disciples of various immortal sects had to be younger than 150 years old.Why was that so?Most of these young disciples did not dare to ask even when they had doubts. On the other hand, Li Changshou had a slight knowledge of it.The dragon race\u2019s dragon egg had to be incubated for at least 150 years before it would break from its shell. The young dragon was equivalent to cultivating in the dragon egg during that time.The young dragon of the Dragon Palace would possess extraordinary powers and become immortals after cultivating for 100 years. If they were the bloodline of the Dragon King, they would have even more formidable mystical abilities.The Dragon Palace would let the young dragon show off its strength every time based on previous similar experiences of the Meet. They would use this chance to jeer at the human cultivators.When the young disciples, who were younger than 150 years old, won against these young dragons, it naturally showed how skillful they were. The immortal sects would be happy with that. Even if they lost, they would not have lost their dignity either.The human race gathered in the South Continent, while the experts of the human cultivators gathered in the Middle Continent.If the immortal sects of the East Continent could not hold their heads high before the Dragon Palace, they would also face censure from the major sects of the Middle Continent. Therefore, all the immortal sects in the East Continent were conscious of their dignity.As they approached the Coast of the East Ocean, the sky was filled with white clouds lingering with an immortal glow.Although there were few Exalted Immortals in the East Continent, less than a hundred of them were qualified enough to receive the Dragon Palace\u2019s invitation.However, in order to draw the border of the East Ocean clearly this time, the Dragon Palace had not only invited the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools, such as the Immortal Du Sect, which had a profound foundation but also invited all the immortal sects from the edge of the East Ocean.As a result, even if an immortal sect sent 30 people out, there would still be many attending the Meet. The sky near the Meet was a little\u2026 crowded.All the disciples of the Immortal Du Sect stood up at this moment. Youqin Xuanya also returned to her initial spot and listened to the instructions from the Martial Uncles and Martial Aunts in front.Li Changshou did not take a further look at his surroundings. He stood at the corner quietly, looked down, and listened with his heart.A disciple up ahead exclaimed in awe, \u201cAs expected, it\u2019s the Demon-Sweeping Meet held by the Dragon Palace. It looks very magnificent with all the immortals here.\u201cEveryone has to give the Dragon Palace some respect. After all, they are one of the three major races since ancient times.\u201dA male immortal turned around to reprimand him. \u201cSpeak cautiously and observe more! Do not follow them! You will easily violate a taboo!\u201d\u201cOkay. It was a slip of my tongue. Please forgive me, Martial Uncle.\u201dAnother female disciple suddenly said, \u201cIs that the place for the Meet this time?\u201dEveryone looked at where she was pointing before they suddenly exclaimed in awe.Li Changshou also looked at the sky and couldn\u2019t help raising his eyebrows.How magnificent!What a good array formation!Some distance away from them in the south-east direction was a huge waterspout.This waterspout was just like the long stem of a lotus flower. It diverted a huge amount of ocean water to the sky, causing a massive water lotus platform to form.The waterspout was stabilized by the immortal powers and stayed still. The water lotus platform above it was steady and wide, and the surrounding clouds and mists filled the sky. It was just like an immortal realm on the ocean.That was the main venue of the Demon-Sweeping Meet.A Perfected Immortal inside said with a smile, \u201cThe Dragon Palace has never disappointed us with such a huge spectacle.\u201dUpon hearing that, Li Changshou laughed softly and looked at Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu standing beside a few female immortals.Throughout this journey, Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu seemed to have changed into another person. She was gentle and quiet. Not only had she not touched the little wine gourd on her waist, but she also had not dared to utter a word.After all, her Master was above her. That side of hers was actually pretty lovable.In the past few years, the more those working together with Martial Aunt to refine pills and set up array formation interacted with her, the more they found it a pity that she spoke well.Cough. That was a joke.As they approached the waterspout and lotus platform, they could increasingly sense how spectacular it was and constantly lamented how the Dragon Palace had spent money.A dense mass of Prawn Soldiers and Crab Generals stood on the surface of the ocean. They were incomparable to those little demons that Lan Ling\u2019 e had killed previously, as each of them had a condensed aura.Even the weakest Prawn Soldier\u2019s aura fluctuation could be compared to a Dao Requital Realm cultivator. Clearly, they were the elite troops of the Dragon Palace.Presently, the Heavenly Courts were not doing well, and the Heavenly River had no troops either. They had created a general for Heavenly Courts\u2019 water troops. The most powerful water troops in the world were the Dragon Palace of the Four Seas.As the white clouds approached this water lotus flower, the waterspout, which had a diameter of 5 kilometers, produced a dragon roar.Dozens of azure dragons of all kinds of colors emerged from the waterspout and flew around the waterspout!Layers of water curtains fell upon the top of the edge of the water lotus platform. Under the sunlight, rainbows hung over the sky\u2026At another glance, around 3,000 of those figures rose from the sky above the water lotus platform.They were the flood dragon troops of the dragon race, and they were wearing bright silver-white armor. Most of them appeared in human form with tanned skin and dragon horns on their heads.Their body was like the immortal flood dragons, which had a close bloodline to the dragon race, and they were the main combat force of the Dragon Palace. They had been very famous since ancient times.These 3,000 immortal flood dragons were distributed evenly as they circled the water lotus platform. They were in charge of maintaining the order of the Demon-Sweeping Meet.The flood dragon troops stood still in the air and emanated their grandness, looking very magnificent. They unexpectedly had a cultivation of Perfected Immortal Realm, and they caused a considerable impact to the human cultivators.\u2018A starving camel was still bigger than a horse. Even if they could not become enemies, they did not need to be nice either. It was best not to accumulate karma with them.\u2019This was what Li Changshou was thinking.A senior sister up ahead asked, \u201cDoes the Dragon Palace value this Meet so much?\u201dAnother Perfected Immortal woman within the sect laughed softly and answered, \u201cThe Dragon Palace likes to engage in these to show their power. Actually, who doesn\u2019t know what predicament the dragon race is now facing?\u201dUpon hearing that, Li Changshou had even more thoughts.Based on the current performance, the dragon race, who were once the overlord of the world, was still unwilling to remain out of the limelight.Now that they were eager to excel, they could still be regarded as the powerful dragon race.After thinking about God Conferment, the cautious Heavenly Courts used their means to bestow rain\u2026After the Heavenly Courts became powerful, the dragon race would be beheaded even if they slightly violated the laws of heaven of bestowing the wrong amount of rain. Thereafter, the dragon\u2019s liver and the phoenix\u2019s marrow would become an immortal dish for the Immortal Emperor\u2026What kind of tragedy had these ancient Big Three experienced before and after the God Conferment?Li Changshou felt sentimental and made a resolute decision not to roam outside before he attained the Zenith Heaven!Although it was still long before reaching the Great God-Conferment Tribulation, he had to start his preparations early.Li Changshou silently pondered as he stood on the cloud. The white cloud of the Immortal Du Sect floated along with dozens of white clouds and reached the water lotus platform first.Immediately, a shiny golden turtle emerged from the water lotus platform.It carried on its back two Turtle Ministers, who were clad in a red embroidered robe with a turtle shell and had a small head at the end of the neck, looking very comical.The turtle on the left cleared its throat, fanned with the little fan in its hand, and said in a gentle, charming, low voice, \u201cFellow Heaven Immortals and Elders, please proceed to the platform at the front.\u201dWas it the legendary\u2026 voice from the Dragon Palace?Then, the turtle on the right shouted in a sharp and ear-piercing manner, \u201cFellow disciples of the immortal sects, please enter the venue!\u201cThe tables and chairs have been prepared at the tribunal platform! There are signs for the immortal sects with a higher rank in the East Continent! Look carefully!\u201cThose who are illiterate can ask those maidservants!\u201cImmortal sects with a lower rank do not have a sign. Please find a seat at the back!\u201dThey seemed like the workers of the same gender in the brothel of the mortal world.\u201cPfff\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu, who had been silent, could not help but cover her mouth and laugh. Everyone in the Immortal Du Sect was also entertained by these two turtle immortals.How dramatic!Everyone in the Immortal Du Sect naturally did not need to worry that they would have no seats. Apart from that, their seats were closest to the front.At that moment, Exalted Wang Qing and a few Heaven Immortal Elders flew to the high platform suspended in the air.16 inner sect Perfected Immortals, who were voluntarily protecting the disciples, abandoned the white cloud and flew towards the seating area for the Immortal Du Sect.It was as if Li Changshou and Youqin Xuanya, who were the team leaders, were non-existent.The various immortal sects had previously discussed, and each sent 30 people over, which the Dragon Palace clearly knew about. However, only 25 meditation cushions and 25 short tables had been prepared at each of the sect\u2019s seating areas.25 sets of fruits and refreshments had also been prepared.However, this was just a trivial matter. A few of the female disciples took out their meditation cushions and joined two tables.Those smaller immortal sects were treated more poorly, as they only had rows of stone meditation cushions without even any short tables, let alone fine wine and fruits.Li Changshou sat near the corner of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s seating area, and a clam maidservant stood beside him to serve the Immortal Du Sect.He scanned the fruits and fine wine in front of him and was surprised. He took and sized up a crystal grape before throwing it into his mouth.A clam maidservant, who looked rather pretty, covered her mouth and laughed lightly. She did not say anything but only secretly sized up Li Changshou.Soon, Li Changshou opened his mouth to burp before he confirmed what he had eaten.The Dragon Palace also teased people in such a way. They gave each of the people in Immortal Du Sect a frozen immortal grape called the Little Postnatal Spiritual Root.After carefully observing the area of the other sects, he realized that they had another kind of immortal grapes.The frozen immortal grapes were indeed good stuff. When taken in small amounts, it could nourish a cultivator\u2019s Primordial Spirit, condition aura, and provide recuperation for wounded people. It was also exceptionally fragrant and expensive.However, there was also a shortcoming of it. When taken in large amounts\u2026 one would fart. In other words, the anus would relax, and the gas would pass out of the body.It was also continuous, which was hard to endure that even immortals could not prevent it from happening.After giving some thoughts, Li Changshou reminded Youqin Xuanya.\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, before you eat these, ask the Martial Uncles and Martial Aunts whether there is anything wrong with them. I see that the other sects have already started eating them. Don\u2019t say that I was the one who reminded you. Just say that you find something amiss with these.\u201dYouqin Xuanya blinked and turned to Li Changshou. She pinched a round peeled grape and delivered it into her mouth as she tilted her head.Li Changshou was rendered speechless.\u2018Fine. Take it as if I did not bring this up.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPfff\u2026Pfff\u2026Every time they reached a new segment, it was actually a good habit to check the emergency exit if they were to stay for a long time.Just like the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Bai Fan Hall, there were two side doors and a back door apart from the main door. In addition to those, there was also a small directional shifting array formation, which not many people knew about. The array formation should be located at the seclusion place of the Sect Leader.Li Changshou was still a brat. When he had gone to Bai Fan Hall to obtain his monthly allowance with his Master for the second time, he had figured it out.The dragon race, which was a different race, had a conflict of interest with the other immortal sects over the territory in the East Ocean. Furthermore, the Dragon Palace was situated above an array formation. Nobody knew whether there was a killing array formation in the water lotus platform.Therefore, shouldn\u2019t he search for a chance to escape during a crisis first?The Martial Uncles and Martial Aunts did not say anything. There were a total of 11 disciples, including him, but only six of them took the fruits in front and ate them?\u2018Where have all your customs gone to? All of you are immortal seedlings. Had the Immortal Du Sect taken advantage or owe all of you anything? Or maybe all of you felt uncomfortable for not eating grapes? Cough. I\u2019ll go\u2026\u2019The grapes in front of the few Martial Uncles and Martial Aunts were only left with the branches\u2026\u2018Forget it. It has nothing to do with me.\u2019Li Changshou sat up properly, pretending as if nothing had happened. He closed his eyes and temporarily abandoned the disciples from his sect.He released his spiritual senses and started searching for the emergency exit here as he minded his own business.While flying to the seating area, Li Changshou had figured out the topography roughly. At the moment, he was analyzing the elements of the array formation on the water lotus platform as well as the possible exits out of the place.Although water could be seen everywhere here, it was clearly more suitable to use the Wind Escape technique to escape from this place.First, it was because the Water Escape technique was slower. Li Changshou had just started cultivating more than ten years ago and was more proficient in the Wind Escape technique.Second, there were strong winds above the ocean, and\u2014All of a sudden, such a force could not be suppressed at all costs. It was a release of two shots of gunfire!This released a strange smell, which instantly diffused, and the slight fragrance with an inexplicable sour smell\u2026It should have been because he had eaten a pill to nourish his skin and stabilize his appearance the previous day\u2026 It was the smell of the herb to retain his youthful appearance\u2026 The alchemist failed to tweak the pill to the best.That was because the cultivator had not eaten the Five Grains. Their bodies had no impurities and were as crystal clear as this grape flesh. Thus, they would appear to be very outstanding once they had any impurities in their body.However, this smell was somewhat\u2026 incredible.Li Changshou opened his eyes slightly. He looked at where the sound came from and found out that it was from a senior sister.This senior sister was sitting calmly at the moment. If she hadn\u2019t been clutching at the corners of her dress, it would seem as if nothing had happened.The two junior brothers beside her had been awkward to the point that they did not know whether to sit or stand. Their lips then started trembling!Actually, this was also a lesson to be learned.Fortunately, the Dragon Palace only teased people and did not give them any Gu poison.Since they were humans, who had never farted before?Although everyone had started practicing Inedia at the Sixth Stage of Qi Refinement, they should have learned to control the impure gas in their bodies.There were 27 people from the Immortal Du Sect. At the moment, eight of them had a change in their expressions, while three of them had produced a sound from the relaxation of their anus.Youqin Xuanya suddenly stood up and hurriedly walked to two Martial Uncles, who had the most seniority here, before she said in a low voice, \u201cMartial Uncles, you have been careless to only take note of the little trap within the fruits now.\u201dLi Changshou was truly helpless.How could he feel safe with such a team?Such teamwork was not as good as him releasing two paper dolls\u2026It was better to not leave the sect in the future. After he went back, he would think of a way to deal with Martial Uncle Jiu Wu so that he would not cause more trouble for him.Youqin Xuanya raised her head to look at Li Changshou. Then, she bit her lips, and her face turned red. She quickly hurried back to her seat and continued closing her eyes to bear with it.She was actually still doing fine and had only eaten one grape just like Li Changshou.However, Li Changshou had eaten it on purpose and used his Dharma powers to bind it so that the grape could release some medicinal effects inside his body. Therefore, he had only burped.Afterward, Li Changshou spat out that grape without anyone noticing, which Youqin Xuanya did not do so.Soon, a dear friend of hers was out of control.Not long later\u2026Was it a chain reaction?Yes, this junior sister\u2019s face had turned red from embarrassment. She had probably started to doubt life. After all, everyone had the impression that a fairy like her had to be dignified and could not fart.A while later\u2026He wanted to ask how hard had his senior sister squeezed her sphincter muscle to be able to release gas with a warble tone and pitch!Li Changshou could not help but lower his head and cover his forehead. He had not expected that he had a hidden ability to roast people.He had no choice, as he was purely forced by the situation.At that moment, he heard a Martial Uncle say, \u201cPay more attention. These fruits before your eyes contain some traps. The Dragon Palace wants to see us make a joke out of ourselves. Those grapes definitely cannot be eaten, and neither can the wine at the side be drunk. This wine is also brewed by such grapes!\u201dWine?Because Li Changshou had never thought of drinking the wine, he had subconsciously neglected the fine wine in the luminous cup.At the same time, Li Changshou instantly sensed someone looking at him.As he followed the direction of the gaze, he saw Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu slightly trembling while seated. Her pair of big eyes were staring at him to plead for help, and she had changed from sitting cross-legged to sitting like a duck.The teacup in front of her had been emptied without a drop of it left!This was a personal habit, which was understandable.However, why had Martial Aunt suddenly stood up and even walked over?Before Li Changshou could not even say anything, Jiu Jiu had rapidly rushed over like lightning and even put her meditation cushion beside him, looking very apologetic.Her gaze was clearly saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Martial Nephew! I will make it up to you after we return!\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s Martial Aunt sat three feet away from him, but her left hand was placed gently under the hem of Li Changshou\u2019s Daoist robe. Then, the hem of his Daoist robe started to flutter lightly up and down\u2026Following this rhythm, there was a sound produced from Jiu Jiu, who was seated three feet away.It was a dynamic rhythm.The clam maidservant at the side tried not to laugh to the point that she had nearly bitten through her lips!Li Changshou pretended as if nothing had happened and could not help but mutter, \u201cThere are not many people now. Let\u2019s set up two noise isolation array formations here. The Dragon Palace should not have any opinions on that. After all, we still have to discuss later how to deal with the troop deployment and array formation set up from various sects.\u201dA female Perfected Immortal, who was eating a grape up ahead, instantly captured the message. She said loudly, \u201cWe will next discuss how to deploy troops and set up the array formation!\u201dThen, she used her immortal powers to open a transparent boundary slightly above her head to bring together the 27 people.The Martial Uncle, who had reminded them through a voice transmission first, sighed helplessly.\u201cHurry up and take care of this matter! I\u2019m being serious here!\u201dInstantly, dozens of people had awkward expressions on their faces, and peals of laughter started lingering.Li Changshou shot a glance at Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu, who was close to him. He realized that the latter looked at him in contempt as if she was saying that he was not meticulous.Her sounds had never ceased. The Daoist robe on Li Changshou\u2019s back fluttered up and down, up and down\u2026He looked up to the sky expressionlessly.\u2018Little Martial Aunt, have you ever seen someone\u2019s clothing fluttering up after farting?\u2019Anyway, it was a din of drums and gongs followed by a dead silence.Figures were landing in the seating area beside them. However, it was the representative team of the East Continent\u2019s Jie School, the East Carefree Forest Sect.The two Perfected Immortals leading the team even cupped their fists and gave a Dao salute to everyone in the Immortal Du Sect. The two Martial Uncles right at the front forced a smile and gave a Dao salute in return before everyone got seated.After confirming there were no movements in the noise isolation boundary, a Perfected Immortal of the Immortal Du Sect raised his hand to disperse it and said as if nothing had happened, \u201cThe 11 of you, remember what I\u2019ve said just now. Do not commit any mistakes.\u201dAfter all the disciples replied in unison, Li Changshou responded, \u201cYes, Martial Uncle, I understand.\u201dRight at that moment, an ocean breeze blew from the Immortal Du Sect to the East Carefree Forest Sect.After the sounds of clanging, a few of the young disciples from the other party swayed.A little girl with bright eyes and white teeth had a change in her expression and shouted to the front, \u201cThird Martial Aunt, there is a demonic aura!\u201dA female immortal reprimanded her with a smile, \u201cThere is nothing to get worked up. This is the fishy smell of the ocean.\u201d\u201cThere are so many Prawn Soldiers and Crab Generals under this place, and there are clam maidservants at the side\u2026 Let\u2019s not talk about these. This is the Dragon Palace.\u201dThere were a total of eight patient clam maidservants at the side of both teams representing their sects. They emitted an immortal glow and retracted themselves back into their clamshells. The eight pure-white clamshells swayed.Li Changshou secretly observed all the sects\u2019 reactions with interest and could obtain many pieces of information from it.For example, Toxic Xuanya was truly innocent. Her neck had turned pink from embarrassment. She was actually still breathing hard, trying to save herself from the catastrophe she had caused.The Martial Uncles and Martial Aunts over 1,000 years old were a group of wily old foxes. They remained unperturbed without having any change in their expressions.A Martial Uncle of the Immortal Du Sect sent a voice transmission to the other 26 people, \u201cAs long as we remain unperturbed, we can treat it as if nothing happened.\u201dAll the disciples immediately adjusted themselves.Li Changshou retracted his gaze of scanning everywhere. He looked at Jiu Jiu, who had returned to her seat and then shifted his gaze to the big clamshells near him.Had these clam maidservants hidden because they were afraid of being hit?Without the disturbance of the Primordial World, he started to focus on analyzing the theory of the array formation circulation here and the fastest escape route for him during an emergency.\u2026\u201cThe idle wind blows past the main hall, and I sing. I find the immortal forest lonesome unconsciously, and cooked wine to wash the emerald ripples.\u201dOn the white cloud, a short singing voice was heard. The new immortals of the Immortal Du Sect returned from their tipsiness.Old Daoist priest Qi Yuan landed before all the older disciples and shouted. When he found nobody responding to him, he looked at the young disciples, who were in seclusion and diligently cultivating. Then, he returned to his straw hut in a wobble.Just when he was about to push the door open, Qi Yuan seemed to have recalled something and said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating in seclusion for the past decade. I have never strolled on the Little Qiong Peak before. I should enjoy the scenery everywhere. I have temporarily guarded the inheritance left behind.\u201dQi Yuan sighed softly and flew towards the nearby forest with his hands behind his back.If this old Daoist priest took another step forward and pushed open the wooden door before him, he could have seen a letter left on the table.Similar letters were not only placed on the table, but also on his meditation cushion, bed, and somewhere on the roof beam that he could see when he looked up.Li Changshou was afraid that his Master would not be able to see them.Li Changshou also had times where he miscalculated. His drunken Master did not return to his little hut directly\u2026The contents of the letter were actually very simple. He congratulated his Master in attaining Immortal Ascension and later explained that he had been sent to the East Ocean and would only return after around seven to eight days. Lastly, he told his Master not to go to the area at the back at the moment. The newly-constructed Pill Chamber nearby had many mazes and trapping array formations.Before he left, he had activated more than half of them\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough completing apprenticeship was unfavorable, and they had been played tricks on by the Dragon Palace at first, everyone in the Immortal Du Sect became cautious as a result.Li Changshou was slightly relieved at this and had never let his guard down.More and more people gradually surrounded them. Li Changshou felt that such an environment was rather unsuitable. Especially when strangers were all near him, he had to constantly pay attention to every single movement at all times.A Wind Speech Incantation was used in the dark.Whenever the breeze blew past, it would transmit pieces of information to Li Changshou while he processed them thoroughly.When he used his spiritual senses to examine other people, it was akin to using his line of sight to look at them. The latter would sense it if they were vigilant.This was considered as active detection.When using the Wind Speech Incantation, he could voluntarily receive pieces of information apart from being able to pass a voice transmission to the person focusing his spiritual senses.This was known as passive detection by Li Changshou. Its advantage was that it would not consume his soul power, while its disadvantage was that all sorts of information could be transmitted through. Hence, he needed to constantly analyze them.Long ago, Li Changshou had consciously trained his detection skills, willpower, and concentration.Most Dao Requital cultivators of the same cultivation realm as him could only have lasted for a few hours before their mind wandered, and they relaxed their supervision of the surroundings.When Li Changshou used the Wind Speech Incantation to observe his surroundings, he could already do it without stopping for hundreds of hours!However, it was indeed sorrowful for an immortal cultivator to be a human surveillance system\u2026At least, Li Changshou could feel at ease.Since he was using the Wind Speech Incantation to observe his surroundings, Li Changshou could hear the voices and peals of laughter from all the cultivators and listen to many interesting stories from them.The Perfected Immortals there were mostly discussing this Meet and the main platform above where Heaven Immortals gathered.Most of the Perfected Immortals were concerned about what agreement they would reach with the Dragon Palace, how the border of the East Ocean would be divided, and whether the dragon race would make things difficult for the human cultivators.On the other hand, the young disciples were always discussing Heavenly Tribulation.Most of the cultivators were afraid of Heavenly Tribulation because it was incomparably dangerous. It was a trial that nobody could avoid.Of course, if they stopped cultivating or reached a bottleneck at the Qi Refinement, Soul Requital, Void Return, or Dao Requital Realms, they could not break through and did not need to face the Heavenly Tribulation.As long as most of the cultivators in Immortal Du Sect did not undergo Qi Deviation, they would have a chance to face Heavenly Tribulation.This was because the Immortal Du Sect was considered a prestigious immortal sect in the East Continent. Those with ordinary potential could not enter this sect. Their Dao heritage was complete, and cultivation techniques were brilliant. The system within the sect was robust, and they had good welfare.This might not be the case for other immortal sects.Looking at the Primordial World and Trichiliocosm, 90% of the human race did not have the potential for cultivating or Immortal Ascension, while 95% of them were mortals.Among the community of cultivators, 90% of them could not attain Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation due to the limitation of their potential and their incomplete cultivation techniques.In the end, only 10% to 20% of them could survive the Immortal Ascension Tribulation.Based on these numbers, not many humans seemed to be able to become immortals.In fact, the number of immortals from the human race had crushed the total number of immortals of the two races during the golden period of the mages and demons!There was no choice. The human race was really good at giving birth\u2026 Their base number was simply too big.After Li Changshou widely read ancient texts, he had concluded that the three main reasons why the human race could rapidly rise after the Great Mage-Demon War period and defeat the mage race and the demon race.Firstly, Goddess Nuwa had entrusted the connate Dao Body.Secondly, humans reproduced very quickly and could adapt very well to their surroundings.Thirdly, the forefathers of the human race had brought about cohesion and centripetal force.Li Changshou did not believe arguments on things such as the Heavenly Dao undertaking the human race.How could the impartial Heavenly Dao be biased to one race?The Heavenly Dao deduced all the changes in all creatures in the world and had foretold that the human race would gain the upper hand. It was more like a kind of prophecy and not predestination for the human race.The saying that the human race relied on the Three Schools of the Dao Sect to gain the upper hand was even more ridiculous.After the human race had risen in power, the three founders of the Dao Sect made use of the human race\u2019s destiny to validate their Dao and establish the Three Schools to obtain endless merits.Even though it was wrong of him to assess this as a Dao Sect disciple, Li Changshou had always felt that the three Saints of the Dao Sect had received the glow of the human race. However, he also felt that they had not done much for the human race.The Ren School was also known as \u2018humans\u2019. The Grand Pure One had only taken in the Great Venerable One from the first generation of the human race as his disciple. The founder of the Immortal Du Sect, Perfected Du\u2019e, had unclear cultivation. She should neither be from the human race nor the teachings of the Grand Pure One.The Grand Pure One had yet to go to the mortal world of the human race to impart the Dao De Jing[1].As a result, Li Changshou did not dare to comprehend the classical texts of the Dao De Jing that he had memorized!The Chan School was not bad either. The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning had taken in many human race experts of the first generation as his disciples. Those disciples of the Chan School had established their own sects in the Middle Continent and promoted the way of cultivation among the human cultivators.However, the Jie School had gone overboard.It was akin to the Grandmaster of Heaven taking the human race\u2019s destiny to help out the other races. There were only a few disciples from the human race. It could be said that he had done things relatively improperly.Among the relationship between the human race and the Three Schools of the Dao Sect, the former was just a foundation to the latter, while the latter was just something that made the former better, which provided more insurance for the prosperity of the human race.The Primordial World was full of schemes.The elders, who had truly contributed to the emergence of the human race, might either be leading a carefree retired life in the Fire Cloud Cave or had entered reincarnation again.These opinions were definitely criticized as deviating from the Dao. Li Changshou was only casually thinking and did not tell anyone about these theories.For example, Li Changshou had only taught Ling\u2019 e how to not accumulate karma and how to escape during an emergency and trained her to be responsible for her own actions. She definitely could not follow her senior brother\u2019s outstanding nature of having his morals high up to the clouds when she encountered any problems.Ling\u2019e\u2019s potential was actually pretty good. She had the potential to become an immortal seedling and was also diligent.Li Changshou had always felt that the potential of immortal cultivation might be some hidden inheritance.80 of the ancestors were mortals. However, there might be an outstanding immortal cultivator genius, which was the case for Ling\u2019 e.Li Changshou remained silent for a while before he heard another interesting topic\u2014the success rate for the Tribulation Transcendence of human cultivators.This could not be lumped together. Different disciples from different Dao heritages were worlds apart in their success rate for their Tribulation Transcendence.As for the cultivators with Dao heritage outside the Three Schools, they did not have superior-class cultivation techniques or the protection under the Three Schools. Out of the 10 people going through Tribulation Transcendence, only one would survive.On the other hand, as long as the cultivators with Dao heritage from the Three Schools did not commit any mistakes, the cultivators from the Chan School and Ren School could obtain a 50% to 60% success rate in the Heavenly Tribulation.It was worth mentioning that the average survival rate of those from the Dao heritage of the Three Schools barely reached 30% because this value had been pulled down greatly by the Jie School.The Chan School pursued excellency, so their disciples had a higher rate of Immortal Ascension, and their number of Dao heritage was in the middle.The Ren School pursued fate, so the Immortal Ascension rate of their disciples was in the middle. However, the Grand Pure One did not like taking in disciples. Therefore, their Dao heritage was meager.The Jie School pursued education for everyone, so their disciples were a mix of humans, demons, and spirits. Their survival rate was based on their destiny, and their Immortal Ascension depended on their looks. Therefore, their Dao heritage was widely distributed in the Trichiliocosm.No matter how brilliant the Dharmic Dao from the Three Schools was, how prosperous their destiny was, or how much the Saint\u2019s connate treasure could suppress their destiny, their Immortal Ascension rate still could not be pulled up.Moreover, the Grandmaster of Heaven did not have any treasures to suppress it. What he had control of was such a lethal killing weapon like the Four Swords of Zhu Xian.Thus, Li Changshou had always been very grateful that his Master had brought him into the Ren School.\u201cLittle Changshou, come here.\u201dWhen Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu suddenly sent him a voice transmission, Li Changshou was distracted right away and looked at her, who was waving at him.Li Changshou slightly nodded to her, expressing that he did not want to move.Jiu Jiu stared at him with a threatening gaze.Li Changshou pretended as if he had not seen anything. He continued closing his eyes and maintained his Wind Speech Incantation.After some time, Jiu Jiu walked over with a smile and sat behind Li Changshou\u2019s short table.Jiu Jiu whispered, \u201cMartial Nephew Changshou, did you bring anything fun over?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Li Changshou answered through a voice transmission. \u201cThat was a reserved item from the Little Qiong Peak, which also means that it cannot be brought out of that place.\u201dJiu Jiu\u2019s expression sank, but she still maintained her upright posture. She complained through a voice transmission, \u201cI\u2019m so bored. This errand is bothersome, and I still have to wait two to three days here before it officially begins\u2026 Master is above, so I can\u2019t even slip away.\u201dLi Changshou smiled slightly and pondered how he should let his Martial Aunt return to her seat as soon as possible.It was not good to be attracting so much attention like this.Li Changshou fished out a woodcut six-colored Rubik\u2019s cube from his sleeve and lightly played it in his hands. He had a rather smooth play with the polished cube and very soon attracted Jiu Jiu\u2019s attention.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dLi Changshou stopped his actions and showed her the scattered colors of the Rubik\u2019s cube. Then, he returned the cube to its original state in a flash.Jiu Jiu\u2019s eyes lit up.Li Changshou scrambled the Rubik\u2019s cube again and put it beside him before he sent a voice transmission. \u201cDon\u2019t give it to anyone else.\u201d\u201cOkay, don\u2019t worry! I know about your rules!\u201dJiu Jiu agreed, took the Rubik\u2019s cube, and lowered her head to start trying it out. She was soon immersed in it and slowly got up to return to her short table.Finally, it was peaceful again.Li Changshou continued portraying as a human surveillance system, which nobody had noticed and waited for this Demon-Sweeping Meet to end.Half a day later, the immortal sects had more or less arrived. Handsome guys and pretty ladies had filled the water lotus platform. If one had nothing to do and scanned them, they were quite outstanding.Suddenly, gongs and drums were heard. A white cloud floated over in the sky with dozens of \u2018ocean people\u2019 in purple robes and red robes on it. They were the large orchestra sent over by the Dragon Palace.It seemed that the clam maidservants played the zither, while the mermaids sang softly.The flood dragons played the bamboo flutes, the prawns beat the drums, the turtle immortals played the brass instruments, and the crabs beat the gongs.A woman with a graceful posture in a thin, skimpy dress came over and danced in the middle of the spacious venue.Her dancing posture was graceful, and she waved her sleeves.The two-day large-scale joint literary and art performance by the Dragon Palace had officially begun.Li Changshou was not distracted because of this. However, there were lesser chatterings around him. Most of the people were watching them singing and dancing. Hence, he had much lesser information to deal with.It would be good in the next few days if things were as peaceful as it is now.As Li Changshou prayed for that, he analyzed what trouble he could be encountering.The errand should not have anything to do with him. He was only at the Second Stage of the Void Return Realm. There was no place for him on such occasions.That also meant that it was not a matter that concerned the young disciples.Except\u2026\u2018Huh?\u2019 Junior Sister Youqin Xuanya stood up and walked over to him with her meditation cushion as she carried a huge sword on her back.\u2018This\u2026\u2019Everyone was on good terms. Was there a need to be so overbearing?After Youqin Xuanya took two steps, Li Changshou sent her a voice transmission helplessly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Junior Sister Youqin. I want to rest alone.\u201dIt was better to reject her so that she would not think about it.Youqin Xuanya, who was 20 feet away, slightly froze. She looked up at Li Changshou and put the meditation cushion beside a female Perfected Immortal.That female Perfected Immortal even said with a laugh, \u201cCome, Little Ya. Why don\u2019t you take a look at the melody I have written recently?\u201d\u201cYes, Martial Aunt\u2026\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Changshou, are you not feeling well?\u201d Youqin Xuanya asked softly, looking deeply concerned with her beautiful eyes.Li Changshou shook his head calmly and gestured to her with a slight smile, and his eyes closed.This was a little awkward\u2026However, this junior sister did not lean toward him and attract others\u2019 attention, which was a good thing.Li Changshou sensed that when Junior Sister Youqin Xuanya had gotten up, many people around had gathered their gaze toward the Immortal Du Sect.Although everyone was cultivators, Youqin Xuanya\u2019s manners, looks, and figure were just too outstanding. It was hard not to attract attention to those qualities.If anyone wanted to take her as a wife, they would feel more at ease after feeding her fat.This was a conscientious suggestion from Senior Brother Li Changshou.[1] The Book of the Dao and Its VirtuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both would be happening later in the day.Li Changshou was completely disinterested in the Dragon Palace\u2019s treasures.No one would mind possessing more Dharma treasures. However, there were too many people coveting for too little treasures this time. His Second Stage Void Return Realm cultivation was not enough for him to compete for the treasures.Additionally, he predicted that a great calamity would befall upon the Dragon Palace from today onwards. It was best that he was not involved with any related karma.If he did become involved, then it would be Jiu Wu\u2019s fault.Based on the position of the sun in the sky, it seemed the Demon-Sweeping Meet was about to officially start.Li Changshou looked at the platform floating in the air. After a two-day conference, the Heaven Immortals from the various sects should have finished discussing the matters of the East Ocean\u2019s border and more.Yet, all these had nothing to do with him.Nearby, Jiu Jiu was still trying to figure out how to solve the six-colored Rubik\u2019s cube, thus proving that one\u2019s cultivation realm and intelligence were not correlated. At least, she successfully spent two mundane days without alcohol.Youqin Xuanya seemed to have come to some form of realization the last time Li Changshou accidentally rejected her. She would look back at him every one hour but make no move to approach him.Thus, two days passed by quite peacefully.Li Changshou was lazily reading the sutra when he suddenly felt piercing, a hostile gaze landing on him.Calmly, Li Changshou lifted the bamboo slip he was holding and focused on analyzing the information the Wind Speech Incantation provided. He discovered the blurry figure of a young man in the direction of the gaze.\u2018Oh? An enemy of mine? How can that be?\u2019Li Changshou lifted his head and saw that that person was standing at the edge of the venue, 1,000 feet away from where the various Immortal Sects were seated.More accurately, it was not a human for short anther-like dragon horns were growing from the forehead.A young dragon of the dragon race?It should be a young dragon about to participate in the fight between the various sects happening soon.Li Changshou was very confused as he realized that that dragon had been staring intensely at him without looking away.He silently leaned back, and the dragon\u2019s gaze followed his movement. It was staring at him without a doubt.Upon closer examination, there was a streak of pale-blue light in the dragon\u2019s eyes.Did that dragon see through his concealed cultivation?It should not be possible. The technique Li Changshou was using to conceal his cultivation level was one of a kind, for it was derived through the detailed analysis of the Dharma spells people around him used.\u2018Could it be because I have the lowest cultivation among the people from the Immortal Du Sect here? That\u2019s why he targeted me?\u2019Li Changshou started hypothesizing. Just then, through the Wind Speech Incantation, he captured that the edges of the young man\u2019s lips twitched and formed a small, confident smile.\u2018Perhaps, this young dragon is not confident but was asked to win against someone later on. Therefore, it seeks out the weakest individual of a major sect? This method is so uncultivated\u2026\u2019Li Changshou glanced at the dragon and stared into its sapphire eyes calmly. The blue streak of light in its eyes gradually receded as it silently locked eyes with Li Changshou, who was several thousand feet away.According to the 10-second eye contact rule[1], the two of them should be\u2026Their eye contact was interrupted by a red body. A Turtle Immortal stood before the young man.\u201cWhy are you here, Your Highness? It is your turn soon!\u201dPrince? The Dragon King\u2019s son?There was nothing good about being targeted by someone like that.Li Changshou could not comprehend how and why the Dragon King\u2019s son could find him, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, among the crowd present.Was his appearance attractive to male dragons?Li Changshou contemplated, analyzing the whole incident in detail and thinking if he should immediately find an excuse to leave the venue.Presently, the dragon race was actually in a very awkward position.They possessed many experts from the ancient times and countless treasures. Yet, they were rejected by Heaven and Earth after destroying the Primordial World in the Ancient War.There might be many experts in the dragon race, and hence, it seemed strong. In fact, however, its strength could not keep up with the improvement and development of the human race.In addition, the dragon race mainly relied on bloodlines to gain strength. Following the death of the strongest Ancestral Dragon during the Ancient War, no dragon stronger than the Ancestral Dragon had been born from then on.After the six Saints ascended the throne during the Primordial Times, the dragon race had to become cautious in fear of invoking the wrath of the Saints and resulting in the eradication of the dragon race. However, the dragon race was still living in a dream where dragons were overlords.A few years ago, the East Ocean Dragon Palace had purposely sent out a batch of newly-trained soldiers to create trouble at the Coast of the East Ocean. The Immortal Du Sect had sent out disciples to kill demons in the East Ocean and protect the human race. This had served as a warning and humiliation for the Dragon Palace.However, the Dragon Palace had not dared to retaliate, for the Immortal Du Sect possessed the Dao heritage of the Three Schools, which was also why the Demon-Sweeping Meet was held. The dragon race wished to seize this opportunity to showcase its prowess and negotiate with the cultivators of the human race to equally split the East Ocean borders.After that, the Dragon Palace had sent a wretched dragon to deliver the invitation card to the Immortal Du Sect. However, that wretched dragon had been sent flying by Exalted Wang Qing with one move. This was another slap to the face, and it was even worse this time round.Yet, the Dragon Palace still had not dared to do anything to the Immortal Du Sect. As a result, dragons in power of the Dragon Palace had set up this little trap with the intention to use this opportunity to take a bit of revenge.While it was childish, it also showed how helpless the dragon race was and how awkward of a situation they were in.In Li Changshou\u2019s opinion, the dragon race was strong in appearance but weak in reality. Old habits would die hard. The whole dragon race had become twisted in its own way.\u2018Is this dragon eyeing me because of these reasons?\u2019Li Changshou fell silent for a few beats, before making a swift decision to sit on the fence and observe the situation.It was safer for him to stay by his own sect than take off on his own in such a place where the strong converged. If there was an expert from the Dragon Palace, who wanted to release their anger on a weakling like him, it would truly be deleterious for him.Li Changshou decided to admit defeat immediately using his weak cultivation as an excuse, should that dragon choose him to exchange pointers with later.The performers left the stage, and a Turtle Immortal with white eyebrows stepped onto the stage with a golden shell beneath his feet. Then, he started to slowly narrate the past glory of the dragon race, which Li Changshou could not be bothered to listen to.He sensed that gaze again. Hence, he chose to stop the Wind Speech Incantation, looked over, and saw that the person about to step onto the stage was the young man from the dragon race.\u2026\u2018I, the Second Prince of the East Ocean Dragon Palace, must do something big today.\u2019Ao Yi stood behind a few flood dragon troops calmly. He only stepped forward when the Turtle Minister introduced him.The immortal armor vest he wore shone faintly, making his young face gentle-looking.Ao Yi was well-aware that he could be considered somewhat of a star in today\u2019s Demon-Sweeping Meet.This was his 10-years-old birthday celebration.Don\u2019t misunderstand, however, for this was, in fact, the 10th hour since he had broken out from his shell. More than 230 years ago, Ao Yi had already gained consciousness in the dragon egg and could move about in the egg for six hours every day.That phenomenon was known as Egg Shift, a specialized term used by the dragon race.From then on, various \u2018teachers\u2019 would utilize these six hours to continuously teach him etiquette, the arts, music, immortal techniques, and so on.The reason? Because he was the second son of the current East Ocean Dragon King, and his inherited bloodline was even purer than his elder brother\u2019s. In the future, he would most likely be able to attain the Zenith Heaven Realm and become a pillar of support for the dragon race.In the first few decades, what Ao Yi had learned made him feel that the dragon race was the strongest race in the entire universe. They were natural-born experts and the Primordial World\u2019s true owner.Yet, he remembered vividly an incident that had happened one morning 163 years ago. At that point in time, he could already remain awake in the dragon egg for 10 hours at a time.A music teacher seemed to be drunk during the lesson, as he narrated to Ao Yi many facts about the dragon race\u2019s current deplorable circumstances.The dragon race was not the strongest. There were the Saints living in the sky and humans living on the land\u2026During the Ancient War, the dragon, phoenix, and qilin race had destroyed the boundless Primordial World, resulting in the deaths of countless living beings. From then on, the dragon race had been deemed responsible, carrying a sin forever unabsolvable. Heaven and Earth rejected them, and the Heavenly Dao sealed their luck.Consequently, they could only stay within the Four Seas and continuously use the bodies of the dragon race\u2019s experts to repair the unstable Ocean Eye of the Four Seas. This way, they could slowly wash off their sins.What was the Ocean Eye?That was the Heaven Earth polluted spring, the most dangerous purgatory!Upon learning that, Ao Yi started to worry as he began to muse about the matter every day.As the Dragon King\u2019s son and the successor to the Ancestral Dragon\u2019s bloodline, what should and could he do for the dragon race?Gradually, he discovered a pitiful truth. The majority of the dragon race still believed that they were the strongest race. Many even attributed the punishment of guarding the Four Sea passed down from the Heavenly Dao as the best proof of their character and willingness to benefit all living beings!Even more, individuals made a ruckus about how the dragon race was once an overlord of this universe and how it was an ancient race far superior to the weak human race!Today, the phoenix and qilin races were almost extinct, and mages and demons became insignificant. The very fact that the prosperity of the dragon race in the ancient times was still being revered by the human race was the evidence that the dragon race was the strongest\u2026How pitiful!How laughable!The comfort enjoyed by the dragon race today was obtained through sacrificing countless dragons to repair the Ocean Eye!There were Saints living in the sky who could exterminate the dragon race with one finger!There were humans living on the land, successfully developing into a powerful force the dragon race could no longer hinder!Despite that, many individuals of the dragon race were still daydreaming about the past glory and were unwilling to wake up from it. Therefore, the dragon race persisted in declaring battles against the human race, although it did not dare to really go into war with the human race.A few days ago, Ao Yi\u2019s elder brother, the Crown Prince of the Dragon Palace, had sent people to create trouble for the Immortal Du Sect. Yet he hadn\u2019t dared to personally send a declaration of war to the Immortal Du Sect!\u2018This is the dragon race! This is the ancient overlord that has been rotten to its core and became twisted! What can I, a 10-years-old young dragon, do?\u2019Ao Yi looked towards the suspended platform, as though he could see his father, the Zenith Heaven King.Golden Immortals could only be destroyed by tribulations. Furthermore, even if the king was to retire from the throne, it would be his uncles to succeed the throne and not Ao Yi. As a result, he would not be able to use the authority as a king to change the dragon race\u2019s situation.Ao Yi scoffed. \u2018To put it bluntly, I\u2019m simply a vessel and pretty puppet for the dragon race to fight for and gain some pride back.\u2019That was all he was worth.\u2018Son, in today\u2019s Demon-Sweeping Meet, you must choose a disciple from the Immortal Du Sect to exchange pointers with. Remember, win, and let your father become happy.\u2019This was the instruction his mother gave him.\u2018Your Highness, please show some mercy and not hurt anyone. Otherwise, the consequence will be quite dire.\u2019This was the instruction a minister working under his father gave him.Yet all of them had no idea what he wanted to do.\u201cLet\u2019s welcome our birthday prince, the Second Prince of the East Ocean Dragon Palace, to the stage!\u201d shouted the Turtle Minister.Ao Yi calmly stepped onto the stage. All eyes landed on him, but he did not bother to look at the non-dragon beings.The Turtle Minster was still narrating the script he had memorized. Soon, Ao Yi would need to personally choose an opponent to exchange pointers with. This was a freestyle performance before the official start of the Demon-Sweeping Meet.He had to exact small revenge on the lowly Immortal Du Sect in front of everyone.Naturally, Ao Yi was aware of his true strength, due to what he had learned when in the dragon egg, his bloodline, and his innate mystical abilities. He had hatched from the dragon egg merely 10 years ago, but the dragons that had just attained Immortal Ascension were no longer his match.Today, however, the surrounding Immortal Sects of the East Ocean had gathered here!He, the 10-years-old Second Prince of the East Ocean Dragon Palace, was going to do something big!Just now, he was observing the strength of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s disciples and had set his sights on the weakest of them all.Perhaps the regal dragon race felt that the two slaps to the face the Immortal Du Sect had given were insufficient.Was that still unable to wake them up from the daydream?Alright!Today, he, the Dragon King\u2019s second son, would lose to the weakest person of the Immortal Du Sect fairly and squarely!Would this slap to the face be sufficient?\u2018Wake up, dragon race!\u2018Wake up, my fellow dragons who are slumbering in the ancient dreams!\u2018It\u2019s still not too late. We, as the dragon race, need to let go of our arrogance. We need to seek a true path, by letting the talented dragon descendants enter the various sects and cultivate their arts and Dao, just like any other human disciples!\u2019One Turtle Minister smiled and said, \u201cToday, our birthday prince will be the one to find a talent from an Immortal Sect to exchange blows and pointers\u2026\u201d\u2018Here it goes.\u2019 Ao Yi breathed in cautiously, stepped up, and looked in the direction of the Immortal Du Sect.Everyone in the venue followed his gaze.\u201cYou.\u201dAo Yi lifted his right hand and pointed at the weakest individual from the Immortal Du Sect, whom he had already selected. Then, he announced with his childish voice, \u201cExchange pointers with me.\u201d[1] When a male and a female maintain eye contact for 10 seconds, it may be seen as a sign of romantic interest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was sitting in the shadows and was practically invisible at this point.Why was this world so cruel to him?There were nearly 8,000 cultivators present. Of the younger disciples, his cultivation level was neither high nor low. After all, some disciples from the minor sects had yet to attain the Void Refinement Realm.Why would the Second Prince choose him out of so many people?Li Changshou could not understand, no matter what. However, he knew that it was not the right time for him to be lost in thought. He needed to do something to extract himself from this sticky situation.Numerous gazes landed on him, and multiple spiritual and immortal senses probed at him.Fortunately, so long as no one took Li Changshou\u2019s hand to check his body, his true cultivation level should not be revealed.However, this did not guarantee that Li Changshou\u2019s cultivation level remained hidden from the elders sitting on the suspended platform.At this very moment, Li Changshou was really tempted to press that little dragon called Ao Yi onto the floor, force open the dragon\u2019s mouth, and stuff some Immortal-Melting Pills and Demon-Subduing Bone-Corroding Pills inside!\u201cMartial Nephew Changshou? Martial Nephew Changshou?\u201dA female immortal of the Immortal Du Sect anxiously sent a voice transmission to him. Li Changshou immediately collected his thoughts, lifted his head, and looked over.\u201cAhem!\u201dA male Perfected Immortal from the Immortal Du Sect cleared his throat, stood up, bowed towards Ao Yi, standing proudly on the square, and said with a smile, \u201cYour Highness, you wish to exchange pointers with our Martial Nephew Changshou here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ao Yi replied impatiently. \u201cI choose him.\u201dThe moment he completed that sentence, a few voice transmissions entered his ear.\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re mistaken. That person is just in the Second Stage Void Return Realm.\u201d\u201cYour Highness! Please choose that lady in red! She is in the Eighth Stage Void Return Realm!\u201dThe edges of Ao Yi\u2019s lips twitched slightly, but he remained unmoved.Li Changshou stood up, cupped his fists at the Perfected Immortals from his sect, bowed, and said, \u201cUncle-Master, my cultivation level is still low, and my ranking in the sect is not in the Top 100. I\u2019m afraid that I will not be the prince\u2019s match and will bring shame to our Immortal Du Sect\u2019s name.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we let the prince choose from the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s disciples present once more? An inner sect disciple in the Top 10 would be a better candidate\u2026\u201cI shall not disgrace myself and the sect.\u201dThe other 10 Immortal Du Sect disciples stood up as well. Youqin Xuanya even stepped forward and stood in front of Li Changshou.Ao Yi frowned. This cultivator was weak and cowardly.The Second Prince of the Dragon Palace declared, \u201cI am not changing my mind!\u201cWhy? Does the Immortal Du Sect look down on the East Ocean Dragon Palace so much?\u201dLi Changshou immediately frowned. Was this fellow still intent on exchanging pointers with him?Where did it go wrong?At the same time, on the suspended platform, the nearly 300 human Heaven Immortals looked down and stared at the situation below. The close-to-100 dragon experts observed the scene with a frown.The old Dragon King was the only one still smiling on the suspended platform, as though he had fallen asleep. He did not seem to care about what was going on below, seemingly having predicted this situation.As Li Changshou hesitated, an Uncle-Master of his turned and smiled helplessly at him.\u201cMartial Nephew Changshou, why don\u2019t you exchange some moves with the prince?\u201dThe male Perfected Immortal was also afraid of putting Li Changshou on the spot, so he went straight to the point. \u201cThe original intention is to let you broaden your horizons. Unexpectedly, the prince chose you as his opponent.\u201cJust showcase what you have learned. There is no need for you to go for the win. Simply make sure to not let the prince feel bored about it, that\u2019s all.\u201dThen, another Uncle-Master sent a voice transmission to him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Martial Nephew Changshou. Go ahead and exchange some pointers with him. We will keep our eye on the situation.\u201cThis little dragon is a prince of the Dragon Palace. He is quite capable. If you feel that the tides are not in your favor, admit defeat immediately. Remember, safety always comes first.\u201cGiven your low cultivation level, it is okay if you lose. There is no need for our disciples to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the sect\u2019s pride!\u201dLi Changshou silently sighed, gave a small smile, and cupped his fists at the elders and peers looking at him with concerned gazes. Then, he walked briskly down the stairs and headed towards the square.He decided to do whatever he could accomplish as a Second Stage Void Return disciple.The star today was Ao Yi. Li Changshou assumed that the dragon chose him intending to secure a win.He shall fulfill this wish then. After a few moves, he would admit defeat, preferably in an elegant way.\u201cChangshou! Martial Nephew!\u201d Jiu Jiu suddenly shouted from the side. She removed the large gourd she was carrying on her back, blinked rapidly at Li Changshou, and hollered, \u201cYou forgot to take your Evil-Vanquishing Ruyi Sword with you! I am almost finished with comprehension. Let me return this to you.\u201dLi Changshou momentarily was caught between laughter and tears, but he felt the care and concern this Aunt-Master of his had for him.The Evil-Vanquishing Ruyi Sword was a supreme-grade Dharma treasure refined by Exalted Wang Qing. It was said to possess the potential to transform into a powerful numinous treasure.This was Aunt-Master Jiu\u2019s natal Dharma treasure. She actually used such an excuse to lend it to Li Changshou\u2026\u201cI\u2019m heading over to exchange pointers with the Second Prince.\u201d Li Changshou replied gently, \u201cThis exchange is not a life-and-death battle, so there is no need for a deadly Dharma treasure like this.\u201dWith that, Li Changshou stepped onto the square, choosing not to accept Aunt-Master Jiu\u2019s gourd. Then, his gaze locked with the Second Prince\u2019s.The edges of Ao Yi\u2019s lips lifted, his eyes burning with desperation.\u2018Very good. Come.\u2018Defeat me, the Second Prince of the Dragon Palace, head-on!\u2018Use your full strength to throw a Dharma spell or a kick and punch at me! I will definitely vomit blood like a fountain!\u2019Li Changshou felt uneasy instead, for that look in his opponent\u2019s eyes\u2026\u2018What is he trying to do? Why is his gaze so intense?\u2018Is this Second Prince of the Dragon Palace truly trying to kill me, an Immortal Du Sect disciple, here?\u2018Can it be because I am not an immortal seedling, so the Immortal Du Sect will not react badly even if I am to die? This way, the Dragon Palace can exact some revenge as well.\u2018Yes, this should be the plan.\u2018I need to exercise caution.\u2019Thus, Li Changshou became even warier.The immortal armor Ao Yi was wearing let out a bright gleam. He took one step forward with an explosive amount of aura.Li Changshou was around 300 feet away from him, and the former could already sense that Ao Yi\u2019s lifeforce had locked onto him.He immediately activated his Dharma powers, concealed his aura, and focused on circulating his self-created Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra. This way, his Dharma power fluctuations were completely in tandem with when a Second Stage Void Return cultivator exerted their full strength.Then, he took half a step forward. The lifeforce of one man and one dragon clashed!\u2018Come!\u2019A streak of light flew across Ao Yi\u2019s blue eyes. He gave up on using the Dharma treasure to initiate a ranged attack and was about to charge forward with the intention of placing his own face in the direct line of punches the weakest disciple of the Immortal Du Sect threw!\u201cHold on!\u201d Li Changshou hollered.Ao Yi lost his bearings and almost fell face-first onto the clean stage.What was wrong?Ao Yi looked over with a frown. The rest of the spectators were puzzled as well.The fight was about to start, so what was that about?Li Changshou explained, \u201cSince we are exchanging pointers, we need to set some ground rules first. There should be a righteous and reputable referee to determine the results. We must also create a boundary, where we cannot step out of. Without any rules in place, it does not seem to fit into the Dragon Palace\u2019s way of treating matters seriously and fairly!\u201d\u2018Why is this person so troublesome\u2026\u2019 Ao Yi felt resigned. However, the Turtle Minister standing at the side felt that Li Changshou\u2019s suggestion made sense and could not be refuted.Indeed, the Dragon Palace failed to make sufficient preparations for this segment.The Turtle Minister came forward immediately and personally took on the role of a \u2018referee\u2019 as it used its immortal power to draw a circle with a 2,000-feet circumference.\u201cFor this battle between the prince and the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s talent, both parties should not overdo it. The usage of killing Dharma treasures is not allowed\u2026\u201dThe boundary was drawn, and the rules were established. The battle suddenly became much more official.Li Changshou and Ao Yi looked at each other again. While standing 300 feet apart, their lifeforce clashed again.Ao Yi stood rooted to the spot as some withered snowflakes appeared and floated around him. There was a flickering flame within each snowflake.\u2018My aura must be strong, and the defeat needs to be extremely tragic!\u2018Breath in and hold the breath.\u2019Ao Yi steadied himself once more and was about to charge forward!\u201cHold on!\u201d Li Changshou hollered once more.Ao Yi\u2019s feet slipped, and he hopped forward twice.This fellow would always shout \u2018hold on\u2019 just as he was about to circulate his Dharma powers!Li Changshou said, \u201cYour Highness, why don\u2019t we battle with our wits instead\u2014\u201d\u201cSo noisy! Here I come!\u201d Ao Yi growled, ferociously charging forward!His body was like an arrow being fired as the ice flare around him shone brightly, leaving a mirage of him at the original spot. However, his front had a glaringly obvious flaw!Li Changshou tightly clutched a stack of talismans in his hand. In the very instant Ao Yi came dangerously close to him, he swayed, evading to the side in a shagged yet graceful fashion.The Dragon Swimming Across Clouds was a superior-class movement technique that he had revealed to the Immortal Du Sect before. However, this was only a movement technique and not some formidable mystical ability.While brushing past Li Changshou, Ao Yi frowned as he stared at Li Changshou\u2019s panicked expression.Ao Yi silently thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on? Is it so difficult to attack head-on? Perhaps I\u2019m too ferocious and scared him away. Don\u2019t be afraid and hit me directly! I will make you win fabulously!\u2019After running for 200 feet more, Ao Yi suavely somersaulted in the air and stabilized his footing before charging at Li Changshou once again.Li Changshou took out six talismans and made some Dharma hand seals. The talisman patterns on the talismans shone, sprouting a number of fire snakes at the opponent!Ao Yi did not evade but lunged forward, the fire consuming his body. In the next moment, however, he dashed through the ordinary fire!Ferocious and unstoppable!Li Changshou completed some abstruse footwork easier this time round, but he was still a little flustered. He evaded Ao Yi\u2019s attack once more and even threw two talismans at Ao Yi.Ao Yi sneered and immediately changed his attack method. He closely tailed after Li Changshou but willingly charged straight into all talisman flames!Li Changshou executed the Dragon Swimming Across Clouds with the Dharma powers of a Second Stage Void Return cultivator. As he went into offense and defense, alternatively, he quickly fell into a disadvantageous position and \u2018fortunately\u2019 managed to get to the spot he had chosen.In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than 10 blows!Ao Yi\u2019s frown deepened. Making use of his \u2018superior\u2019 strength, he continuously delivered flaws and his own face to his opponent to target.However, perhaps his opponent was purposely avoiding his vital parts and did not dare to attack a prince of the Dragon Palace, or the opponent\u2019s strength was truly too weak, and he could not grasp the opportunity offered to him on a platter.His opponent simply refused to make use of the flaws offered!Fortunately, although their talisman techniques were not strong, he had already suffered from numerous fire attacks.In just a moment, he could directly enact the scene of a live dragon \u2018exploding\u2019!Finally, Li Changshou and Ao Yi had the very first body-contact\u2026Thirty feet behind Li Changshou was the boundary, having been \u2018forced\u2019 to that position. His eyes gained a determined gaze. He threw out a dozen talismans, Dharma powers gathering at his palm and transforming into thunder streaks!Daybreak Five-Thunder Technique!This was considered a slightly advanced Dharma spell of the Immortal Du Sect. Most Void Return disciples had already mastered this technique.Thunder flashed, and fire sparks burst!Ao Yi charged within the resulting cloud of thunder and fire. His fist finally smacked onto Li Changshou\u2019s palm!\u2018Eh?\u2019Ao Yi frowned. His innate sensitive battle instinct sensed danger the moment this clash happened.\u2018Eh?\u2019At the same time, Li Changshou was a little befuddled.This punch was thrown without any strength behind it.Even so, Li Changshou still followed with the script he curated. His body tilted backward as he staggered a few steps back. After using some hand movements to shift Ao Yi\u2019s fist to the side, Li Changshou continued to move backward.Ao Yi seized this opportunity as well and purposely slipped a little. Stumbling, he made some steps to the left as he mused, \u201cThis should be enough!\u201dAt that very moment, Ao Yi heard a cough coming from the side. His sapphire eyes shifted to the side, and he looked from the corner of his eyes.Li Changshou lowered his head and coughed a few times, his fingertips covered with some blood. Then, he looked towards the sky, let out a long sigh, and murmured with a despondent expression, \u201cForget it, I still lost. My capabilities are insufficient. I need to head back and cultivate more.\u201dHe took half a step back, coincidentally crossing the previously drawn boundary.The various immortals, cultivators, and members of the dragon and ocean race on the lotus platform looked on with pity.The movement techniques, talisman techniques, and thunder techniques Li Changshou just exhibited were quite impressive for a Second Stage Void Return disciple.\u2018Admit\u2026 He admitted defeat!?\u2019Ao Yi was stunned for a moment. He looked down and saw the shimmering border in front of Li Changshou, unable to process it immediately.\u2018Why in the world did you admit defeat? Why did you admit defeat first? Did you not wish to win? Aren\u2019t you a cultivator of the human race?\u2019Then, he heard the Turtle Minster at the side shout, \u201cFor this battle, the Second Prince\u2026\u201dAo Yi\u2019s eyes widened as his face contorted.\u2018How can this be allowed!? My perfect plan! The most important step of the plan to wake up the dragon race! How dare you admit defeat!? I even volunteered to be hit! This, this!\u2019The Second Prince\u2019s face suddenly became flushed.The Turtle Minster\u2019s announcement was still at: \u201c\u2026is the\u2026\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Ao Yi tilted his head up suddenly and gave a deep roar.At the same time, pale-gold dragon blood suddenly started sprouting from his surroundings, while even cracks appeared on his immortal armor.The Heaven Immortal Turtle Minister was frightened.Ao Yi stared at Li Changshou and said with a trembling voice, \u201cSuch powerful\u2026 talisman\u2026 technique\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, his body started falling backward and landed on the \u2018blood pool\u2019. The surrounding dragon experts swarmed into the square. The whole venue descended into utter chaos!Li Changshou was rendered speechless.\u2018The acting skills of this little brother from the dragon race are impassible and at a newbie level.\u2019A few Perfected Immortals from the Immortal Du Sect rushed from the sides, stood in front of Li Changshou, and protected him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus, he quickly started to think of a solution.That fellow\u2019s acting was very fake, but he was still a prince. It would not be good if the Dragon Palace made use of this opportunity to create trouble.Jiu Jiu stood in front of Li Changshou, using her petite body to block half of his.She asked in a low voice, \u201cAre you injured, Martial Nephew Changshou?\u201d\u201cMy aura is a little unstable, and that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t worry, Aunt-Master. The punches of the Second Prince were quite powerful, after all. But I\u2019m fine,\u201d Li Changshou replied in a low voice, having already come up with a solution for this situation at hand.With a worried and guilty expression, he sighed and lamented, \u201cI wonder how the Second Prince\u2019s injuries are. My talisman techniques should not have been able to break through the immortal armor he was wearing. Could it be because I repeatedly used my movement technique to evade and lacked the courage to meet him head-on? And that is why, in his anxiety, his Dharma powers went haywire? Why don\u2019t you help to check his body, Aunt-Master? After all, I don\u2019t know how advanced the Dragon Palace\u2019s medical skills are and if they could diagnose a sickness like this.\u201dJiu Jiu laughed humorlessly and chided. \u201cThere are many experts in the Dragon Palace, so how can such a thing be impossible? Don\u2019t worry about it!\u201dUpon hearing that, the ministers of the Dragon Palace looked towards Ao Yi. Shortly, the Turtle Minster, who was the first to reach Ao Yi, shouted, \u201cHis Highness is alright. It is just that something went awry during the circulation of his Dharma powers, causing his Dharma powers to break through his body. His Highness has simply lost consciousness as a result. He will regain consciousness soon and is, in fact, fine\u2026\u201dA Dragon Palace general wearing silver armor immediately inquired, \u201cThen what do we do about this battle, Minister?\u201dThe Turtle Minister fell silent. It looked at the boundary and then glanced at the unconscious Ao Yi.This time, Li Changshou did not need to worry about the situation.A male Perfected Immortal of the Immortal Du Sect standing at the side smiled and replied, \u201cThe Second Prince is, of course, the winner. It was only after my Martial Nephew stepped out of the boundary that the Second Prince sustained inner injuries. The outcome is obvious. I have a Qi-Regulating Pill, made using a secret pill formula from the Immortal Du Sect. The Dragon Palace might not have much care for an ordinary pill like this, but it is a little token from the Immortal Du Sect.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe Turtle minister gestured for the Dragon Palace general to accept the pill. Thus, this matter closed.The Turtle Minister immediately called some immortal prawn soldiers over, placed the unconscious Second Prince Ao Yi on a jade chair, and directed the soldiers to carry it out.The Immortal Du Sect\u2019s immortals cupped their fists and returned to the sect\u2019s spot while protecting Li Changshou among them.While walking, Li Changshou suddenly whispered to Jiu Jiu beside him, \u201cAunt-Master, I have read on an ancient book that the type of grape on our table is very useful for when one\u2019s Qi goes awry during cultivation.\u201d\u201cThat grape was given by the Dragon Palace. Wouldn\u2019t they know it better than you?\u201d Jiu Jiu reprimanded, \u201cAnd you, why did you jump out of the boundary? You might have won if you simply stood there for a while longer.\u201dLi Changshou replied with a bitter smile, \u201cI simply couldn\u2019t hold my own any longer.\u201dJiu Jiu became unhappy and scolded Li Changshou, \u201cWhen we return, I will personally make sure that you focus when you cultivate. If your cultivation level is so weak, what use is there to play around with alchemy and array formations?\u201cYour own cultivation level is the foundation of Dao!\u201cOtherwise, if you chance upon any formidable Dharma treasure, you will not be able to wield it at its full capability!\u201dLi Changshou lowered his head as he replied, relieved, \u201cYes, I know my mistake now.\u201dHe could clearly sense that the gazes on him started to dissipate\u2026Youqin Xuanya, who was carrying a huge sword, approached him and looked at him in concern.\u201cSenior Brother Changshou, how are your injuries?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing. My aura is slightly unstable, that\u2019s all,\u201d answered Li Changshou, looking guilty. \u201cMy capability is insufficient, causing Junior Sister and the rest of the sect to worry, and resulting in the sect to lose face.\u201dA senior brother instantly sent a voice transmission to him, \u201cEvidently, that Dragon Palace\u2019s Second Prince was purposely seeking trouble and intentionally chose you, Junior Brother Changshou!\u201cWait and see, Junior Brother. I will let the dragons participating later to know how powerful we can be!\u201dLi Changshou looked at that senior brother in gratitude.\u201cSenior Brother Changshou, you can return to your seat first and rest. There\u2019s no need for you to continue standing.\u201d\u201cThe Dragon Palace is too much. That Second Prince is despicable.\u201dJiu Jiu reminded, \u201cSit well and don\u2019t complain! There are so many Heaven Immortals watching from above!\u201dAll disciples were reprimanded, but some of them continued to be indignant at the injustice Li Changshou faced. As a result, they were scolded by the other Perfected Immortals of the Immortal Du Sect.The reaction of those people was actually expected.Li Changshou knew that this reaction was so big not because of him, but because of the collective pride as a sect.He returned to his seat, and his fluctuating aura swiftly calmed down. Youqin Xuanya looked back at him several times as she walked away from him.Then, the concern on her face disappeared, and her expression turned increasingly cold.The Immortal Du Sect\u2019s number one disciple\u2019s eyes started to burn furiously. She removed the large sword from her back and placed it down on the short table. After pointing a few places on the blade and removing the seal on it, numerous flame patterns appeared on the large sword. Then they slowly transformed into several long thin flying swords.Suddenly, the temperature of the seating area where the young Immortal Du Sect disciples gathered dropped.She took out two bottles of pills and checked them to make sure that there were sufficient pills to aid in recovering one\u2019s Dharma powers.Then, she took out a handkerchief and slowly wiped the set of flying swords. Her face was cold and expressionless, her eyes looking\u2026 a little scary.\u201cJunior Sister Youqin.\u201dShe heard Li Changshou\u2019s voice transmission, and Youqin Xuanya\u2019s movements stopped. At the same time, she turned around to look at him.\u201cWhen it\u2019s your turn later, please exercise restraint. We\u2019re in the Dragon Palace, and we should not clash with them directly.\u201dYouqin Xuanya nodded her head slightly. Her murderous gaze softened and became gentler.In that instant, she might be puckering her lips or smiling, or perhaps both.However, her expression and gaze were indeed trying to tell Li Changshou not to worry.The three Immortal Du Sect disciples separating Li Changshou and Youqin Xuanya saw that expression on the latter for the very first time. All of them were surprised and were strangely also feeling like they were in the way\u2026 and very extra.Youqin Xuanya continued to meticulously wipe her flying swords. It seemed like she did not change her mind simply because of Li Changshou\u2019s voice transmission.Li Changshou did not continue to bother himself with it since there was nothing he could do either.He cast the Wind Speech Incantation, this time for the purpose of listening in to the discussion and gossip happening in the venue. This way, he would obtain some real-life feedback after his performance.Soon, voices entered his ear with the wind flow, from near and far away, in a crescendo\u2026\u201cThat Immortal Du Sect disciple is not bad. That Dragon Palace\u2019s Second Prince was too impatient and failed to use his full strength.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t that Turtle Minister say so? After all, the Second Prince is only 10 years old. It is normal for him to be slightly hot-blooded.\u201d\u201cI myself might not win against the Second Prince. It is a pity that the Immortal Du Sect disciple went out of the boundary first\u2026\u201dAfter carefully analyzing for a while, Li Changshou felt assured. His image as an excellent disciple of the Immortal Du Sect was believable and without any flaws.As he was sitting with the top ten immortal seedlings of the sect, he would soon be compared and forgotten since the outsiders would not see anything noteworthy about him.The Turtle Minister officially announced the result once more\u2014the Dragon Palace\u2019s Second Prince won the round.However, due to his impatience, the Second Prince\u2019s aura had gone awry, causing him to sustain internal injuries. He had already returned to the Dragon Palace to recuperate. The celebratory segments after would hence be canceled.This small incident temporarily ended.From that incident, Li Changshou witnessed firsthand the unpredictability of the Primordial World and the complexity of the dragon\u2019s heart. Li Changshou felt that he was still too young, having underestimated the human heart and dragon nature, thus failing to consider the matter completely.But how could he know that that little dragon would pull such a trick?Ao Yi was actually so unruly that he attempted to intentionally lose to him!Fortunately, Li Changshou had stepped out of the boundary and admitted defeat first. Otherwise, the whole situation might be worse than it was now.Next time, if he encountered a similar situation, Li Changshou would punch himself in the face to cause severe injuries so that he could directly exit the battle.Li Changshou recalled the battle scene, which appeared peaceful on the surface but was actually quite bizarre.The instant the fist and the palm clashed two pitch-black figures seemed to appear behind the human and the dragon, looking coldly at each other\u2019s eyes.\u2018You dare to deceive me?\u2019\u2018Back at you, my friend.\u2019The little dragon most likely had other plans as well.Li Changshou\u2019s biggest hope right now was to be able to return to the sect safely.After balancing the pros and cons, it would be worthwhile to leave this dangerous environment successfully even if he needed to expose some of his trump cards.After all, the reason he concealed trump cards was so that he would be able to live well.Who knew what kind of tricks there were up the dragon\u2019s sleeves!?\u2026The Demon-Sweeping Meet officially started after a performance.The Dragon Palace took out 12 immortal Dharma treasures to serve as the final prize of the battles between disciples happening later on.Battles happened as the participants played offensive and defensive. Countless disciples entered the segment. The venue was split into several areas as well.Each round had an immortal treasure as the prize. If someone could successfully defend the place nine consecutive times, and defeat the warrior the Dragon Palace sent out, they could take the immortal treasure away.The warriors were some young dragons, with the strength equivalent to that of an average first- or second-stage Dao Requital cultivator.The difficulty of defending the treasure was not low. However, the disciples from the various immortal sects were very excited since it was hard for them to obtain immortal treasures.The moment the battle started, the numerous disciples exhibited their techniques. The whole scene was very spectacular.However, two hours passed, and only an early-stage Dao Requital disciple from a major sect won nine consecutive rounds, obtaining the opportunity to meet the warrior head-on. Nonetheless, the battle ended with the cultivator losing.At that moment, Youqin Xuanya slapped on the short table and flew on the sky with 12 transparent flying swords encircling her. Then, she landed before the dragon youngster.\u201cOne battle.\u201dToday, Youqin Xuanya from the Immortal Du Sect shocked everyone present at the Dragon Palace.She controlled the swords and fire, seizing four immortal treasures, defeating several dozens of cultivators, and injuring four Dao Requital youngsters from the dragon race in total. Her reputation rose in the East Continent.The female cultivator certainly would have an extraordinary future ahead, and, after that drawn-out battle, she became the focal point of all gazes. She dragged her exhausted body, covered with injuries, and was carrying a large sword on her back, taking slow steps towards the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s seating area.She rejected the offers of help from the rest of the members from the sect and ignored the Uncle-Masters\u2019 advice that she should rest immediately. After bypassing her seat, she continued on slightly\u2026Her head was lowered, body hunched, and slender hands were slightly trembling due to overexerting her Dharma powers.However, she succeeded in placing the four immortal treasures emitting rainbow lights onto the short table in front of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Second Stage Void Return disciple, someone that most people had already forgotten about\u2026Then, she smiled tiredly at the male disciple who was looking at her\u2026At that moment, all cultivators present gained profound respect for Youqin Xuanya. The Perfected Immortals from the various immortal sects were impressed as well.Li Changshou looked back at her with a conflicted gaze, having been rendered speechless. He stood up with the intention to hold her up, but Youqin Xuanya thought of his injuries and immediately evaded his hands.Hence, Li Changshou could only give a Dao salute at Youqin Xuanya\u2019s back while silently \u2018blessing\u2019 Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2026 a few hundred times.\u2026Inside an extravagant underwater palace hall.The youngster lying on the 1,000-feet-long bed suddenly opened his eyes. He reached back and grabbed hold of the maidservant who was kneeling beside him and was currently peeling grapes for him.\u201cDid I lose? Did I lose?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness. You won\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? How\u2019s that possible! I evidently\u2014\u201d\u201cSecond Prince! Second Prince!\u201d\u201cSomeone! The prince fainted once again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhite clouds floated above the azure ocean.Just like when they had been on the journey to the East Ocean, a huge white cloud floated towards the north-west gate while carrying 16 Perfected Immortals and 11 disciples, and a few Heaven Immortals protecting the order in all four directions above.Those who left first dumped the huge white clouds behind. The cloud path was very wide and did not seem crowded.This was the third day after Li Changshou\u2019s insane battle with Ao Yi, and the Demon-Sweeping Meet had also ended successfully.The fake leader, Li Changshou, sat at the corner and had retired from glory. Thus, nobody paid attention to him.Since the true leader, Youqin Xuanya, had an outstanding performance at the Meet, her name had spread everywhere. She had beaten 36 cultivators and four dragon race disciples consecutively. As a result, she had risen to fame. She was now being surrounded in the middle of the white cloud.Among Youqin Xuanya\u2019s opponents on that day and those four dragon race disciples, seven to eight of them were at the First Stage or Second Stage of the Dao Requital Realm. On the other hand, given her cultivation at the Eight Stage of the Void Return Realm, she had relied on her firm mind and clever techniques accumulated with hard work.Furthermore, the power and grade of her flying sword surpassed that of an ordinary immortal treasure. It had experienced many fierce battles and gnawed those bones in succession.The power supporting her perseverance was not the four immortal treasures that the Dragon Palace had used.Under everyone\u2019s gaze, she put those four immortal treasures before her senior brother, who had previously been bullied and humiliated by the dragon race. Then, she returned to her own seat and meditated cross-legged, which was akin to giving everyone a clear answer.She was not contending for the Dharma treasures but striving for determination!\u2018I, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, am not easily dealt with by other people! The Senior Brother from my sect is not what anybody can bully either!\u2019At that time, the eyes of a few sentimental Martial Aunts had gone red.If Li Changshou had not been the one being implicated, he would definitely have given Youqin Xuanya a thumbs-up and told her that she had been cool.However, he had been bullied by the dragon race. After being protected by his junior sister, he was a lucky one who had obtained four immortal treasures for no reason\u2014that was relatively awkward.These four immortal treasures were like four hot potatoes. Fortunately, Li Changshou reacted in time and entrusted them to Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu, who was in the line of succession in the Heaven-Breaking Peak, for safekeeping. When they returned to the mountains, they would be given to Youqin Xuanya\u2019s Master, Martial Uncle Jiang Jingshan.This was proper handling that would not cause any more unnecessary trouble.However, the feeling of being protected and receiving help to stand up for himself was slightly strange.Li Changshou had gained some benefits on the journey to the East Ocean.In the next two days, competitions between cultivators of the same seniority helped him broaden his combat methods.These cultivators came from different immortal sects and had different main cultivation techniques. Although the Five-Element Yin-Yang Dao technique was their main one, it had many different kinds of styles and complicated combinations.Li Changshou had been watching at the side for two days. He had learned some very useful little tricks, which supplemented the tactical setups for the paper dolls.Broadening his horizons and raising his experiences were also a kind of cultivation.Due to Youqin Xuanya\u2019s blow, the Immortal Du Sect had been the biggest winner for the Meet this time. Not only had they taken away one-third of the Dharma treasures, but they had also boosted their sect\u2019s reputation by a lot.During the next ceremony to take in disciples, they might even be able to recruit a few immortal seedlings because of this.After Youqin Xuanya left, although disciples of the same seniority as her, such as Li Changshou, had to enter the battle as well, their best record was only seven consecutive wins.The senior brother, who had said he wanted to stand up for him, had won three out of four battles and had not been able to meet the remaining young dragons.Just when she left the range of the East Ocean, Jiu Jiu returned to being an obedient fairy and suddenly heard a voice transmission from above.She hurriedly flew into the sky on the cloud to the side of her Master, Exalted Wang Qing.Soon, Jiu Jiu flew down from the sky and was full of smiles.She landed back on the white cloud, where most of the teams were and took out a pill bottle before putting it beside Youqin Xuanya.Previously, Youqin Xuanya had spent a lot of effort. Ever since the huge battle two days ago, she had been mediating and cultivating.Then, Jiu Jiu walked to Li Changshou and sized him up as she cranked her head before she muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s strange. How come Master has praised you more than Xuanya?\u201dLi Changshou had to worry about that.Had Exalted Wang Qing seen through his true cultivation level?No, that was not right. If that was the case, he should have reproached him for not winning the glory for their sect. He should not have been praising him for no reason instead.\u201cHere, this is for you. This is a reward from my master. This is not considered a reward within the sect.\u201dJiu Jiu threw out a jade token before she sat cross-legged three feet from Li Changshou.A few disciples perked their ears to hear what was happening.Youqin Xuanya had received the pill rewarded by Exalted Wang Qing, which was nothing. However, Li Changshou had lost his only battle. How could he receive a reward?In that jade token, there should be some kind of high-level immortal techniques, right? After all, it was the reward that Exalted Wang Qing had personally given.Jiu Jiu grinned, pretended to be stern, cleared her throat, and said, \u201cMaster said that you have dealt with the Prince of the Dragon Palace well.\u201cThe Second Prince of the Dragon Palace is full of evil tricks. He should have wanted to let you beat him up with serious injuries and lose to you on purpose. Then, the Dragon Palace would seize the chance to take action on the Immortal Du Sect.\u201cMaster said that if you had not seen through him in time, used the deceptive technique, and admitted defeat first, we might not be able to return to the mountains.\u201cHe also said that Fifth Senior Brother had mentioned you a few times before him, saying that you are meticulous in your thoughts, prudent in your execution, and very reliable in handling matters.\u201cHe had not chosen the wrong person to lead the team of disciples this time.\u201dThe burden in Li Changshou\u2019s heart fell instantly.Exalted Wang Qing had actually seen through the conspiracy of the Dragon Palace!Indeed, he had the height and outlook of a Heaven Immortal, which was totally different from their insignificant outlook!Although Li Changshou had previously done a meticulous analysis, deduced that the Prince of the Dragon Palace wanted to dishonor the Dragon Palace, and reversed the bad atmosphere of the Dragon Palace, he had not expected such logic behind that and even such a vicious scheme!Li Changshou thought back right away and realized that he was not standing at a height high enough. From the start, due to his first impression, he had believed that the Dragon Palace did not dare to deal with the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools directly. At the very most, they would let Ao Yi kill an insignificant disciple like him in the competition.\u2018Oh? After thinking about it carefully, Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s logic seems to have many loopholes. Forget it, forget it. From the present outcome, Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s analysis is beneficial to me.\u2019This Exalted One was\u2026Very great!Very warm!Very considerate!A few of the disciples suddenly saw the light and were enlightened, while a few Perfected Immortals appeared to have known it before. Most of them looked at Li Changshou in admiration.For no reason, he had received a surge of favorable impressions from the others.This was much better than having bad impressions.Li Changshou supposed that he would receive rich rewards after he returned to the mountain, even though he had received the Inaction Sutra in advance.Li Changshou looked down at the jade token and realized that there was a profound thunder spell engraved on it\u2060\u2014True Heaven Yang-Thunder Mantra.After pondering slightly, Li Changshou sent a voice transmission to Jiu Jiu at his side and handed the jade token over to her.Jiu Jiu looked at Li Changshou in shock.She had been cultivating for nearly 1,000 years, but she had never heard of something so absurd!The elder in the sect had bestowed a treasure, while the junior still wanted to be picky and wanted her to ask whether this thunder spell could be changed into the True Samadhi Flames cultivation technique, which was more useful to alchemy!Li Changshou naturally knew it was inappropriate for him to be doing this. However, Jiu Jiu was on good terms with her master, and he indeed wanted the True Samadhi Flames more than anything.If he could obtain the True Samadhi Flames, his strength would soar greatly.Therefore, he could only be thick-skinned.\u201cI am going to get scolded by Master!\u201dJiu Jiu rolled her eyes and took the jade token. She flew into the sky in a huff but restored her obedient look halfway.Very soon, Jiu Jiu turned back without a hitch and used a handkerchief to wrap two jade tokens. While nobody was noticing, she threw it to Li Changshou.Exalted Wang Qing did not take back the True Heaven Yang-Thunder Mantra.The Dharma spell engraved on the new jade token was of a similar grade to the thunder spell. It was written with three big words: True Samadhi Flames!After carefully reading a few sentences of the opening, he heard the cultivation outline of \u2018essence flame\u2019, \u2018spirit flame\u2019, and \u2018Qi flame\u2019. He felt a sense of satisfaction.He had finally obtained it. It was seriously real.Perhaps, this matter might leave an impression on Exalted Wang Qing that he was greedy and discontented.However, everything was worth it!After Li Changshou returned to the mountain, he would take root and cultivate honestly at the Little Qiong Peak.He would pay no attention to external matters, and study the True Flame Sutra wholeheartedly!The True Samadhi Flames were not only used to injure his enemies.It was a wider type of True Flame handed down by the Dao Sect. It was famous for its great power and a lower threshold for cultivation. However, it was not easy for him to obtain the cultivation technique of the True Samadhi Flames.When Li Changshou had initial success with the True Samadhi Flames, he could record the techniques in an ancient text and use the True Samadhi Flames to enhance his soul and Dao Body. That way, he would be more confident when he faced the Heavenly Tribulation!From today onward, he only needed to go out of the mountain once more\u2014survive the Heavenly Tribulation!If he could successfully go through the Heavenly Tribulation, he could keep a low-profile and seek longevity in the mountains in the future!He dreamt about being able to feed fish, grow flowers, refine pills, and set up array formations. When he was bored, Li Changshou could tease his junior sisters. When he had nothing to do, he could be a backup civil servant of the Heavenly Courts\u2026This was probably the life he yearned for the most at present.Would trouble descend from the sky?Li Changshou looked at Youqin Xuanya, who was being protected tightly and could not help but reveal a slight smile.After Junior Sister Youqin Xuanya returned to the mountains, she should be able to be valued by the sect the most. From a certain degree, it would also become the shackles that restricted her movement.As long as Li Changshou dealt with Martial Uncle Jiu Wu, later on, there would be no way for trouble. The Little Qiong Peak would also definitely restore to its usual peace!As for Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu, it was a good thing even if she came over often. That way, after Immortal Ascension, Li Changshou would produce some special pills and set up some formidable array formations, which would all be thanks to her help.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Jiu Jiu sent a voice transmission at the side before she curled her lips. \u201cI know you\u2019re uneasy at a glance.\u201dLi Changshou replied with a smile, \u201cCan you solve the Rubik\u2019s cube?\u201dJiu Jiu smiled in satisfaction. She threw the Rubik\u2019s cube with six colors on each side back and answered indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy since I found a way. Give me something else fun.\u201dLi Changshou smiled and nodded his head. He took out a 5\u00d75 Rubik\u2019s cube and handed it to her.Jiu Jiu looked at the dazzling cube and its color. Shocked, she quickly sat in meditation and cultivated seriously.Deep in the East Ocean, the prawn soldiers, crab generals, and flood dragon troops heavily guarded the Crystal Palace at the bottom of the ocean that was covered by array formations.The singing and dancing in the main hall did not cease, and the feast to celebrate the Demon-Sweeping Meet had ended smoothly.The experts in the Dragon Palace watched comfortably as the most outstanding young disciples from the immortal sect in the East Continent took out all sorts of Dharma treasures for the battle.The Dragon King seemed to be drunk on the throne carved by crystal corals, leaning on the soft cushion made by the Brilliant Nine-Winged Gold Silkworms, which would be changed monthly, with a few beautiful young ladies at the side. These ladies gently fanned the Dragon King and massaged his shoulders, back, and dragon legs.Being born as a dragon was that boring, cozy, and dull.The Civil and Military Chancellors of the Dragon Palace drank toast after toast while they talked cheerfully about the battles of those human disciples they had seen.Outside the main hall, the young dragon, which had just woken up for half a day, ascended the steps with a firm gaze.He was the Second Prince of the East Ocean, Ao Yi. He was going to do\u2026 something big!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was looking at the three small paths in front of him while feeling at a loss and helpless.A few days later, he still could not walk out of it\u2026He had actually spent many years studying the array formation. However, he had limited skills in the array formation.After all, in the past hundreds of years, Qi Yuan had spent most of his time mending his Dao base. To study the array formation method, he had also taken the array diagrams, set them up several times, and remembered how to set them up, which was considered having initial success in enlightenment.Therefore, when he faced the trapping chain array formations\u2026\u201cWhich expert set this up at the Little Qiong Peak? What plans does he have?\u201d Qi Yuan mumbled in a low voice and tried to recall his previous itinerary.While Qi Yuan was in a daze, and at a loss, he found another new path.The forest up ahead was verdant. There were no misleading white mists, and the scenery was very ordinary.Qi Yuan cautiously moved forward and very soon found something new.There was a wooden sign hung on the treetop up ahead with three words written: \u2018Are you lost?\u2019Qi Yuan subconsciously nodded his head before he then trembled and became vigilant.Why did the handwriting seem so familiar?Qi Yuan stared at the wooden sign for a while and saw another wooden sign hung on the tree behind. He took two steps forward, and there were some changes in his surrounding scenery. However, the wooden sign behind was still there.On the wooden sign, it was written: \u2018What brings you here to the Little Qiong Peak, Sir?\u2019\u201cI live here!\u201d Qi Yuan berated furiously, but his hands kept trembling.Could it be\u2026 Could it be that this was the passage of time as in the legends?In ancient legends, a connate person had entered a canyon. After he had walked out from the other side of the canyon tens of thousands of years later, he had not felt that he had aged.Could it be that such an absurd thing also happened to him?Had the current Little Qiong Peak no longer been the Little Qiong Peak when he was still around? Had it been the Little Qiong Peak thousands or hundreds of years later?Upon seeing that there was still a wooden sign behind, Qi Yuan once again went towards it. When he stood before the wooden sign, the surrounding scenery changed again as though it was teleportation. The array formations were changing.Behind the wooden sign was another wooden sign.Qi Yuan found the handwritings on those wooden signs increasingly familiar. It was as if there was a shadow following him and kept faintly asking him questions beside his ears. It was driving him to a certain trap, but he actually did not dare to retreat.\u2018Are you someone from the Immortal Du Sect, Sir?\u2018This array formation is to protect an important place like the Pill Chamber, and it is in accordance with the sect rules.\u2019Pill Chamber? He seemed to have heard it from his disciple.\u2018Did you enter the Little Qiong Peak without permission, Sir?\u2019\u201cDo I still need to barge? I am the Peak Leader of Little Qiong Peak!\u201d\u2018Please do not destroy the grasses and trees here. This path leads to an open space without sound isolation array formations.\u2019Huh? This was an exit left by the person who had set up the array formation?\u2018This is an improvised guide sign.\u2019\u2018The open space is up ahead.\u2019\u2018You have reached. Please take three steps forward.\u2019Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks and subconsciously held his breath. He looked at the huge tree in front and took three steps forward doubtfully.The scenery before his eyes changed again. An open space surrounded by overgrowth appeared before his eyes. There were stacks of fallen leaves on the ground and a small table with a bucket of spiritual spring water at the side.\u201cWhat\u2026 What is this place?\u201dQi Yuan saw another wooden sign up ahead and walked over. He found the handwriting on the wooden sign very familiar, and yet, he could recall where he had seen it.\u2018Sir, please wait here. If I can\u2019t rush over in time, I should be in seclusion or at a crucial period in alchemy. If you are unable to wait, you can use your immortal powers to call someone over to save you. The Little Qiong Peak sincerely welcomes your arrival, but do visit directly next time. Do not go near the Pill Chamber. Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Peak Leader, Qi Yuan, pays respect here.\u2019Qi Yuan\u2019s hands trembled, and he took two steps back before hitting onto a tree.His retreat had unconsciously been blocked.\u201cWas\u2026 Was this set up by myself?\u201dQi Yuan\u2019s eyes widened as if he had seen a ghost, and his drunkenness had been obliterated instantly. He scanned the whole area and could only slightly sense his head spinning.Could it be that that person had been possessed?No, that was not right. Could it be because a Turbid Immortal was impure?When he had been drinking just now, a senior from the sect had reminded him that Turbid Immortals were easily contaminated by the Earth Qi, and their Dao Heart would easily meet evil spirits.\u2018Could it be\u2026 Could it be that I\u2019m just a mental demon in the true Qi Yuan?\u2019Qi Yuan\u2019s hands could not help but start trembling. He rushed to the wooden sign again to look at the handwriting on it. Then, he was in disbelief.Wasn\u2019t the handwriting on this wooden sign his own handwriting!?Qi Yuan slipped and landed on his butt on the ground, which was full of fallen leaves. He looked stunned with a flustered gaze, and his long, messy grayish-white hair looked even worse.Passage of time, Turbid Immortal, mental demon\u2026Passage of time, Turbid Immortal, mental demon\u2026\u201cWho am I? Could it be that I\u2019m actually my mental demon?\u201cNo, that is impossible. I\u2019m not a mental demon but Qi Yuan.\u201cI am Qi Yuan, Qi Yuan is me. I have stepped into the passage of time, so I cannot be a mental demon!\u201cNo, that is not right!\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201cNo\u2026\u201dQi Yuan put his hand on his head and suddenly raised his head before screaming loudly, which shocked the birds in the distance of the Little Qiong Peak. It had also occasionally made the few figures, who were passing by in the sky, to look at the forest of the Little Qiong Peak curiously.All of a sudden, a startled female voice was heard.\u201cMaster?\u201dQi Yuan stopped shouting and asked in a tremble, \u201cLing\u2019e?\u201d\u201cMaster, are you trapped in the array formation?\u201d\u201cAre you really Ling\u2019e?\u201d\u201cYes, Master. How can I be fake?\u201d\u201cNo, no. You can be a mental demon\u2026 My mental demon\u2026\u201dOutside the array formation, Lan Ling\u2019e, who had rushed over, could not help but cup her forehead.She was done for. Her master had been ruined by her senior brother.She groaned in a low voice and had an idea. She quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t move! There are a lot of array formations here!\u201cDon\u2019t move toward Ling\u2019e\u2019s voice either! If you leave that small area, you cannot hear anything from the outside!\u201cI will go in to find you!\u201cHowever, I need to spend some time to find the array formation path to your location. Only Senior Brother can undo this array formation. This place is set up by him. Master, wait patiently for a while.\u201dQi Yuan froze slightly. Very soon, he heard an \u2018Aiya\u2019 from outside.Just now, what had his disciple said?\u2018Senior Brother? This place had been set up by Changshou?\u2019Qi Yuan was full of doubts. Since he was lost in thoughts, he gradually calmed down.After one hour, Lan Ling\u2019e, who had fallen leaves on her and a badly battered face, appeared before her master with a bitter smile. She then did a Dao salute to him.\u201cMaster, I have found you.\u201dQi Yuan could not help but stare at Lan Ling\u2019e. While being unperturbed, she executed a few Dharma spells, which were all taught by Qi Yuan.\u201cMaster, I\u2019m really Ling\u2019e\u2026\u201dQi Yuan was relieved and replied with a bitter smile, \u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Ling\u2019e bit her lips and muttered to herself. She was thinking about how she was going to help her senior brother.Soon, she took out a storage sack and walked to the side of the short table. She then took out two cushions and teapots and said with a smile, \u201cMaster, have a rest here first. Let me slowly report to you.\u201dQi Yuan was still looking very doubtful. However, when he sat on the cushion and saw Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s familiar skill of brewing tea, many of his doubts had vanished.The forest was extremely quiet, and only the rustling of the breeze on the treetops could be heard.Since the surrounding trees had been covered, the azure sky seemed to be only left with this small area.In a flash, this old Daoist priest understood what was going on.He sized up the place and asked in a low voice, \u201cThis place was set up by your Senior Brother?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e answered, \u201cIt should be said that he had designed this place, while the Perfected Immortal of the Heaven-Breaking Peak, Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu, set this up.\u201d\u201cOh, no wonder,\u201d Qi Yuan answered with a bitter smile. \u201cSo, Junior Sister Jiu Jiu helped with it.\u201d\u201cActually, Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu is not proficient in array formations. Senior Brother was the one telling her to put this here and put that there.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e paused and lowered her head before she said, \u201cMaster, have you never realized that?\u201dQi Yuan held up his teacup and sipped a mouthful of tea. It was indeed his favorite chrysanthemum lotus seed tea.\u201cRealize what? That you like your Senior Brother?\u201d\u201cOh, god!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e instantly blushed.Qi Yuan frowned and fixed his eyes on her. \u201cDon\u2019t you like Changshou?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t tell you this directly. I will feel shy\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e soon calmed down and said softly, \u201cSenior Brother is actually not ordinary.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dQi Yuan looked at her with a pampering look and said with a smile, \u201cIn your eyes, your Senior Brother is naturally not ordinary.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, Master.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e lifted her hand to tidy up the strand of hair at the side of her ear. \u201cSenior Brother is actually much more competent than you think he is.\u201cFor example, he had used these basic array formations to set up a chain array here.\u201cAlthough he allowed Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu to help him, there would be no difference even if he set up this place alone.\u201dQi Yuan froze at once.Lan Ling\u2019e added, \u201cFor more than 10 years after I joined the sect, Senior Brother has taught me a lot of things.\u201cMany instances, I would be confused after you talked about the Dao. Senior Brother would always come over to explain the quintessence to me.\u201cOften, he could point out the true meaning in one or two sentences. Therefore, I am at such a cultivation level.\u201dQi Yuan frowned and looked at her, not knowing what to say at the moment.Lan Ling\u2019e said gently, \u201cLook, Master. What stage is my cultivation currently at?\u201dQi Yuan stroked his beard and mumbled before answering, \u201cNinth Stage of the Qi Refinement Realm?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e picked up the sword with both hands and performed a complex seal. Her surrounding aura suddenly rushed outward. \u201cWhat about now?\u201dQi Yuan widened his eyes. \u201cFifth Stage of the Soul Formation Realm! Lan Ling\u2019e, when did you!?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e made a silent gesture and once again performed a seal with both hands. Her surrounding aura was rapidly restrained.She said in a low voice, \u201cThis is the Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra that Senior Brother has imparted to me. It can hide my cultivation level as long as I don\u2019t come into contact with any Perfected Immortals. I can also reveal whatever cultivation realm I want.\u201dThere was only shock on Qi Yuan\u2019s face.\u201cMaster, Senior Brother has entered the sect for 100 years. You spent most of your time in seclusion to break through to the Immortal Realm. Your understanding and concern towards him are simply too insufficient.\u201dWhile Lan Ling\u2019e supported the teacup base with her left hand, her right hand took the teacup, and she gently sipped a mouthful of tea. She no longer looked doubtful.\u201cWhile Senior Brother has been taken to the East Ocean by Martial Uncle Jiu Wu, I want to let you know about these clearly.\u201cI\u2019ve always been watching him at the side do many things for you, but you don\u2019t know anything about it. Every time you meet him, it\u2019s either you scold him or say how bad he is.\u201cMaster, Senior Brother is probably not far from Immortal Ascension.\u201cIf my guess is right, the Immortal-Melting Pill that you used was also refined from the Immortal-Emancipating Herbs that Senior Brother had dug up after going to the Priming Meet a few years ago.\u201cMaster, you were worried about Immortal Ascension. Senior Brother was also most concerned about your Heavenly Tribulation and had put in a lot of effort for that.\u201cWhat you only saw was a Faraday Cage\u2026 Actually, Senior Brother has created more than 10 treasures to resist against the Heavenly Tribulation in the past two years. However, they were ineffective in the follow-up tests.\u201cI\u2019ve seen him being vexed a few times. He squatted in front of the treasure that had been struck by the Thunder Tribulation.\u201cThe only time I saw him got nervous was the moment you went through Tribulation Transcendence.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e looked at Qi Yuan. The latter was at a loss as he sat there.\u201cMaster, Senior Brother is really not ordinary. I\u2019m not just spouting nonsense\u2026\u201dSlowly, Lan Ling\u2019e talked about what she knew about her senior brother.Although she had concealed a lot of things that he had told her, she had not exaggerated anything.Qi Yuan gradually came back to his senses. When she asked Lan Ling\u2019e to execute another Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra, he saw that she had a lot of immortal pills and poisonous pills. As a result, he sat there and immersed himself in thoughts.A moment later, Qi Yuan asked while feeling uneasy, \u201cLing\u2019e, tell me\u2026 tell me what I should do? Should I reward your Senior Brother when he returns?\u201d\u201cMaster, you\u2019d better take it as if I didn\u2019t say anything today and pretend nothing happened. Treat him as you usually do,\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e replied with a smile. \u201cWhen he comes in to receive us in a moment, whack his butt with the horsetail whisk\u2026\u201cBut don\u2019t use all your strength.\u201cEvery time you want to beat him, he actually deliberately exposed his flaws for you to catch him on purpose.\u201dQi Yuan was shocked and said with a bitter smile, \u201cAm I that horrible?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e quickly shouted, \u201cMaster, you are wise and heroic! Your immortal techniques are endless!\u201dQi Yuan hesitated to reply, \u201cThen I will pretend that I didn\u2019t hear anything?\u201d\u201cWhat Senior Brother wants the most is for people to not notice him. Afterward, he would have amassed wealth while keeping a low profile.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e pouted. \u201cI need to pretend to be more stupid in front of him. I will pretend to be muddled when I need to. Otherwise, he will definitely drift apart from me\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e then started to criticize how Li Changshou usually bullied her, trying to relieve the sadness in her master\u2019s heart.Very soon, Qi Yuan was full of smiles thanks to her and was energetic again.\u201cYou! Hahaha!\u201dQi Yuan got up and walked to the side. He looked at the array formations set up at this place, which he did not understand, without allowing his disciple to see the tears at the side of his eyes.\u201cAs his Master, I\u2019ve been too selfish. I\u2019ve only thought about Tribulation Transcendence and seclusion.\u201cAfter I took in your Senior Brother and imparted cultivation techniques to him, I\u2019ve always been in seclusion.\u201cI thought that after going through the Heavenly Tribulation this time, I would teach both of you to cultivate well. However, I realized that I\u2019ve always been the one getting all the attention.\u201cForget it, forget it. I don\u2019t care. I won\u2019t care anymore.\u201cWith such a disciple, I can comfortably tell all the ancestors of the Little Qiong Peak!\u201dQi Yuan then turned to look at Lan Ling\u2019e and said with a smile, \u201cMy little disciple is also now so intelligent.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e laughed embarrassingly and mumbled softly, \u201cI\u2019ve always been working hard so that I can be a match for Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cUm, have tea, Master! The tea is getting cold! Don\u2019t reveal anything I\u2019ve told you today!\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. We will both pretend to be stupid and put on an act before your Senior Brother.\u201d After Qi Yuan sat back at the short table, he took out the horsetail whisk. \u201cI will teach him a lesson later on. Join me and see what it feels like.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cCan I, Master?\u201d\u201cOf course. After deceiving me for so many years, I have to teach him a proper lesson!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e cheered excitedly and was eager to give it a try.Qi Yuan said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will later enter seclusion to be enlightened on the cultivation technique of a Turbid Immortal. From today onward, the Little Qiong Peak is all for the both of you.\u201dHe then looked at the tea before him. As he looked at his reflection, he could not help but shake his head and smile lightly.Seriously\u2026 it was wonderful!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the way back to the Immortal Du Sect, Li Changshou thought, \u2018After coming out for a few days, it should be fine in the mountains, right?\u2019His master should still be drinking tea at the other peaks. He had also told his little junior sister to enter seclusion and cultivate.The most probable inconvenient situation was that someone would go to the Little Qiong Peak and trespass the array formation around the Pill Chamber by accident. Even though the trapping arrays and mazes did not cause direct damage, if anyone stopped in between them for a long time, they would easily lose their mind and nourish the mental demons.However, after he had nearly driven Martial Uncle Jiu Wu crazy the other time, Li Changshou had also done some changes to the chain arrays.He had left behind a \u2018guest\u2019 path.If a thief trespassed the array formation, he would drive them crazy and just silence them. However, there was a mountain-protecting array formation in the immortal sect. How could thieves enter?Under normal circumstances, the person who entered the array formation should be those from the same sect as him and had strange goals\u2060. Killing and driving them crazy was not appropriate.Hence, Li Changshou had set up some guide signs on the dead-end path to draw the trespasser into a comfortable environment to temporarily stabilize the person.This way, he could avoid being awkward afterward and not let the other party run everywhere. He could still set up other things with ample time.Moreover, if he managed to trap a Perfected Immortal, who constantly made a move everywhere, it would likely trigger the hidden killing arrays.It was none of his business whether the trespasser died or got injured. At that time, it would be troublesome when the sect found out that he had gone against the rules.The role of the array formation was to stop other people from approaching the Pill Chamber on the surface. The \u2018guest room\u2019 set up in the array formation could solve these two more critical problems properly.This was a necessary measure taken by Li Changshou after careful deliberations.Moreover, he had also used his master\u2019s name and imitated his handwriting on the wooden guide signs.After all, his master was the Peak Leader, while he was just an older disciple of the Little Qiong Peak.\u2018I\u2019m finally going to return.\u2019Li Changshou scanned the mountains in the distance and planned his journey.After he returned, he would continue to suppress his cultivation level and ponder through the True Samadhi Flames.In this current minor realm, if Li Changshou wanted to suppress his natural speed of breaking through with his life, he should still be able to suppress it for another two years or so.Two years was only enough for him to barely cultivate his True Samadhi Flames into the initial stage.The next time he went out of the mountains would be for the official Tribulation Transcendence.Then again, how should he explain to his master about the Pill Chamber and the chain arrays around it? If his master asked how he had set up the chain arrays, should he reveal some of his hidden strength?Li Changshou naturally trusted his master, but if his master spoke the truth after being drunk\u2026Forget it. His master and junior sister were the closest people to him. Their scope of power and treatment here should be unbiased.Li Changshou would go back and find his master to talk about it so that his master would understand him to the extent at which his junior sister understood him.As he approached the sect mountain, the night breeze was unexpectedly somewhat warm.\u2026When Li Changshou returned to the Immortal Du Sect, it was already in the middle of the night, where the moon was bright, and the stars were sparse.Everyone dispersed in front of the Bai Fan Hall, and Li Changshou also bade his leave to Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu before drifting toward the Little Qiong Peak on the white cloud.Youqin Xuanya clearly wanted to say a few words to Li Changshou. However, just when she landed on the ground, she was told to go to the Bai Fan Hall by a few martial uncles. She had no chance to get away.Li Changshou drifted away on the white cloud without anyone noticing him. People were happy with their happy events, and he had reaped great benefits in the past few days.However, Li Changshou\u2019s expression nearly sank when he recalled his journey to the East Ocean.He still was not sure why the Dragon Prince had chosen him that day.Just in case he once again met the unconventional Ao Yi, Li Changshou had to stay away from these ancient nobles in the future.The Little Qiong Peak was extremely quiet. From afar, Li Changshou realized that his little junior sister and master were not in their own respective straw huts. He scanned the array formations with his spiritual sense and saw them being trapped at the edge of the array formation.How had they ended up being trapped together inside?His master had always been in seclusion, so he did not know about the array formations at the back. On the other hand, Lan Ling\u2019e was watching when he had set up the array formations. How had they gone in together?Could they have thought that the scenery there was good, so both of them had gone in together to have tea and enjoy the stars?Li Changshou drifted over on the white cloud. He was not in a hurry to let the two of them out. He would first check the array formation inside out. Just now, he had felt that the jade token used to control the array formations was left outside the trapping arrays.The breeze blew, and the white mists in the forest came and disappeared. The dense forest seemed to have less thicket.Lan Ling\u2019e immediately cheered. \u201cMaster! Senior Brother is back!\u201dQi Yuan perked up and wanted to get up. However, he seemed to have recalled something. He sat properly, showed his usual face, and picked up the specks of dust!\u201cCough! You brat\u2026 How great, Li Changshou! Aren\u2019t you coming over to receive your punishment!?\u201dLi Changshou, who was drifting over in the sky, blinked and sensed that something was unusual.As soon as he landed on the ground, his master whipped him with the horsetail whisk.After he had advanced to a Turbid Immortal, Qi Yuan\u2019s strength had soared. This horsetail whisk had whipped out a sky of white nets in a blink of an eye! If not for Li Changshou\u2019s endurance, he would have escaped!Li Changshou had been tied under the white net.Lan Ling\u2019e at the side immediately pounced on her prey like a tiger and pushed Li Changshou down.A few sounds of miserable howling and peals of laughter were heard in the forest.However, the \u2018lesson\u2019 that they were going to teach Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s senior brother was not that intense as she had expected.Thanks to her senior brother, who did not retaliate at all, and her master, who had been watching from the start, she did not know where to start.She was just a little junior sister. If her master did not demonstrate it, she could not hit her senior brother for real.She lifted her head to see her senior brother looking at her with a warning gaze.\u2018Hmph!\u2019As her heart raced, she was about to land her empty hands down fiercely. However, just when she was about to do that, her delicate hands could only eventually land on where her master had hit her senior brother several times. When she thought about how he had been beaten swollen by her master there, she could not help but gently\u2026 rub it.\u201cUm, Ling\u2019e has indeed grown up.\u201dLi Changshou was relieved yet helpless. He educated her earnestly, \u201cA woman has to restrain herself. Drooling and habits are different matters. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t understand you. After all, you are at that age. However, as a cultivator, you still have to restrain the urge. What if you give rise to the mental demons? Am I right?\u201d\u201cNo! I\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e instantly blushed and looked at her master with a flustered look. She realized that her master was also looking at her with a frown. He wanted to say something but hesitated and looked awkward.\u201cJust now, I was just\u2026 Stupid Senior Brother! You\u2019re bullying me!\u201d\u201cA gentleman takes action instead of reasoning things. Why are you so fierce?\u201d\u201cHmph! I can\u2019t win over you!\u201d\u201cMaster, if you don\u2019t take good care of her, how will she get married in the future?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business! I will die at the Little Qiong Peak of old age!\u201dQi Yuan had already turned to leave. He had a slight smile on his face and slowly drifted toward his straw hut.After some time, Li Changshou walked out of the forest with a head full of leaves and untidy clothes. As he looked at the few bite marks on his arm, he was caught between laughter and tears.His junior sister was born in the Year of the Rabbit. This was proven.Lan Ling\u2019e, who was behind him, blushed and pretended to look at the sky as if nothing had happened.When he reached the straw hut, Qi Yuan sent a voice transmission to their ears.\u201cI am going to start seclusion to be enlightened about the Dao cultivation of a Turbid Immortal. Changshou, you are in charge of taking care of everything at our Little Qiong Peak. You can find me to discuss anything at any time.\u201cLing\u2019e, you still have to take note of your speech and actions. You have to respect your senior brother.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e replied as soft as the sound of a mosquito, \u201cYes\u2026 Yes, Master\u2026\u201dThen, the layers of array formations around Qi Yuan\u2019s straw hut lit up and were isolated away from the outside.Li Changshou turned around and looked at her. \u201cYou told Master?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e instantly stammered, \u201cThis\u2026 Um\u2026 This\u2026 A little\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it just a little or a lot?\u201d\u201cDefinitely just a little!\u201dLi Changshou had a serious look. \u201cEnter the house.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e slightly trembled, and her expression sank. She instantly switched into a crying mode. After she entered her own straw hut, she took the cushion, closed her legs, and knelt. She lowered her head and pretended to cry.As he activated the surrounding array formations, Li Changshou said faintly, \u201cTell me. What did you tell Master?\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, Master forced me to tell him\u2026\u201dLi Changshou was helpless. If someone heard this, they might have thought there was a human tragedy at the Little Qiong Peak.In his master\u2019s retirement plan, should he add a wife for him?He could consider this.Li Changshou actually did not care much about his little junior sister beating around the bush as she told him about what she had told their master.After all, there was a limit to what she knew.Based on his understanding of Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s personality, he already had a hunch regarding the situation today.\u2026In the dead of night, the array formations around the Pill Chamber had been completely activated. Li Changshou used the furnace to refine pills casually. He let the paper doll clones guard them, while the real paper dolls in the hidden underground chamber.Everything was going well.Li Changshou took out three jade tokens to play with and put away the thunder spell and Inaction Sutra. He then took out the True Samadhi Flames cultivation technique and forcibly engraved it in his head before he was lost in thoughts.The Great God-Conferment Tribulation\u2026Although it was the most ideal state to secretly become a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, that required a long time.As the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools, the Immortal Du Sect was very likely involved in the Great God-Conferment Tribulation.The Great God-Conferment Tribulation was not just a plot like King Wu of Zhou overthrowing the tyrant King Zhou of Shang in the South Continent of the mortal world. The Three Realms should be involved in this, and this targeted the Great Tribulation of the disciples from the Three Schools.Presently, the Middle Continent was becoming more and more prosperous. When the time came, they would naturally be destroyed miserably by the Great Tribulation. The East Continent\u2019s immortal sects probably could not escape from the tribulation either.However, Li Changshou did not intend to avoid this Great Tribulation.It was very simple. He wanted to climb ashore in advance.The Great God-Conferment Tribulation was actually the process by which the Jade Emperor of the Heavenly Courts established the authority to dominate Heaven and Earth. The nominal cause was that Jade Emperor Hao Tian had complained to the Dao Ancestor that the Three Schools\u2019 disciples were rude and did not follow the orders of the Heavenly Courts. His title, as the ruler of the Three Realms, existed in name only. He did not have the dignity of a man, so he could not lift his head before the Queen Mother of the West. His manly grandeur had totally collapsed\u2026Cough. That had gone off track.Based on the God Conferment results, the Three Schools\u2019 disciples had become immortal in the Heavenly Courts. The Saints no longer took the initiative to manifest them in the world, and they laid the foundation for the Heavenly Courts to manage the Three Realms.In that case, as long as Li Changshou got into the Heavenly Courts in advance and became an elder during the difficult times, he did not need to be a high-ranking official. He just had to conceal his cultivation level and become a low-ranking official so that his name could be in the Immortal Registry.After the Great God-Conferment Tribulation, his name would have been in the Immortal Registry, and he would have nothing to do with the tribulation. How could the God-Conferment calamity fall upon him again?Confer the gods in the Heavenly Courts again? That was unreasonable.When the conferred gods were appointed to the Heavenly Courts, there would be many geniuses. He could then succeed easily and seize the chance to retire. He could obtain the seniority of an elder of the Heavenly Courts and return to the mountains to continue cultivating steadily.What could he have against that?Li Changshou knocked on the table with his fingers and carefully considered the specific plan.His name had to be in the Heavenly Courts\u2019 Immortal Registry before the Jade Emperor complained to the Dao Ancestor, in which he still had ample time. Letting his master become the Earth God was also a crucial step, as it could save him a lot of planning.Li Changshou would have to see whether his master was willing or not.Although the land was small and plentiful, and he would have little authority, he would be the Earth God after all.The Earth God might even find a\u2026 wife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn front of the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou sat quietly on the sling chair. He opened his left palm, and a ball of blue flame gradually burned.This was not the complete version of the True Samadhi Flames, so it was fine even if he revealed it. After all, it had been three months since Exalted Wang Qing had rewarded him the True Samadhi Flames cultivation technique. It was reasonable for him to be able to cultivate the most simple Qi flame.Provided that he put in a lot of Dharma powers, the Qi flame\u2019s power was simply not as good as one-third of the Cold Nether Fire.Once he combined the Qi flame, essence flame, and spirit flame into one as the True Samadhi Flames, its power would probably be much stronger than the Cold Nether Fire!Li Changshou had figured out the cultivation technique theory of the True Samadhi Flames.He roughly had to use his Qi, essence, and spirit to cultivate three fire seedlings and integrate them into the True Samadhi Flames. This flame could often survive in the Dao Body, burn evil spirits, and remove impurities, which could all be used to protect oneself.What made Li Changshou the most satisfied was that the flame\u2019s power was actually related to the fire seedling condensed by his essence, Qi, and spirit.In other words, the power of the True Samadhi Flames could constantly increase alongside his cultivation level. He would not be wasting too much time on a spell that he would not be able to put to full use after mastering it.A white cloud drifted over from the horizons. Li Changshou turned his left hand into a fist and extinguished that ball of flame.He got up and cupped his fists at the white cloud.The short Daoist on the white cloud revealed a slight smile and looked down. While maintaining at the height of 100 feet above, he said warmly, \u201cMartial Nephew Changshou, I heard that you reaped great benefits on your journey to the East Ocean three months ago. You also dealt with the Prince of the Dragon Palace properly when he provoked you. I did not recommend you for nothing.\u201dLi Changshou suddenly revealed a warm, gentle smile and said, \u201cThanks to your good intention, I was able to obtain the fire spell and thunder spell. I\u2019ve specially prepared a feast for you today. Take it as a return feast for nurturing me.\u201dJiu Wu, who had just returned to the mountains, smiled with his thick eyebrows and big eyes while clicking his tongue.\u201cWhy do I feel that\u2026 something\u2019s up? You usually are unwilling to offer wine to me here. You went to the East Ocean after being coaxed and deceived by me. Martial Nephew Changshou, could it be that you want to use the poisonous pills to plot against me?\u201dLi Changshou was caught between laughter and tears and responded, \u201cI\u2019m only a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak. Martial Uncle, you are a Perfected Immortal, the line of succession of the Heaven-Breaking Peak, and the sectarian officers that the elders think highly of. Even if I have the thoughts to plot against you, I don\u2019t have the guts at all. Moreover, I obtained huge benefits on the journey to the East Ocean.\u201dWhile he said that, Li Changshou fished out two Night Pearls from his sleeve. \u201cThese are the photo-taking balls. After improving them, I\u2019ve turned them into sound-recording balls. Martial Uncle, one for you, and one for me. The entire feast today will be recorded in this ball. What do you think?\u201dJiu Wu became happy right away. With his hands behind his back, he jumped down the white cloud and looked up at Li Changshou. Then, he reached out to take the sound-recording ball.\u201cI want to see what\u2019s in your gourd.\u201d\u201cMartial Uncle, you should do it first.\u201d Li Changshou had an increasingly warm smile.Two short tables were placed at the side of the furnace. Little Ling\u2019e displayed the culinary skills that her senior brother had helped her to nurture. The table was filled with sumptuous food and drinks, and there were three wine jars stacked up at the side.The two of them sat down. At the same time, they turned on the sound-recording ball before placing it at the corner of the table.Afterward, Jiu Wu picked up jade chopsticks and tried each plate of dishes and jars of wine.\u201cAre you really treating me to wine?\u201d Jiu Wu said with a smile, \u201cCould it be that there is some kind of harmless medicine inside each of these dishes and would be an incapacitating toxin when mixed together?\u201dLi Changshou could not help but support his forehead with his hand. He shook his head and said with a sigh, \u201cMartial Uncle, what have you experienced outside that you have to surmise my intentions like this? After all, I\u2019m not an evil person.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 It was just a joke.\u201dJiu Wu waved his hand and took the initiative to take up the wine jar to start the drinking. The two of them drank without restraint.After some time, half of the wine jar\u2019s contents had gone into their stomach. Jiu Wu had really only eaten the vegetables and not moved a single bit.Li Changshou slowly picked up each of the dishes and kept praising his junior sister\u2019s culinary skills.When the two of them got slightly drunk, Li Changshou lifted the third wine jar.\u2018It\u2019s here. It\u2019s easy to guess this fellow\u2019s tricks.\u2019Jiu Wu laughed up his sleeves and wanted to see how Li Changshou was going to perform his tricks.Li Changshou said, \u201cMartial Uncle, this is a thank-you gift from me. It\u2019s the Bone-Strengthening Poisonous Dragon Wine.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Jiu Wu frowned and used his immortal powers to take the wine jar. He placed it dozens of feet away from him and opened it. He could not resist the smell and took a bit of wine over before he pinched it with his fingers to feel.Jiu Wu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cGood wine!\u201dLi Changshou said seriously, \u201cThis has been brewed by 36 kinds of poisonous herbs and 12 kinds of poisonous insects, and is accompanied by the Ganges River\u2019s Dry Wine. After soaking them for three months, its toxicity neutralizes. It replenishes spirit, strengthens bones, and raises a man\u2019s grandeur. However, there is something about it\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you are able to bear with it. This thing has a rather strong medicinal effect.\u201dJiu Wu frowned at Li Changshou, who also blinked his eyes at him. The two of them gave a knowing smile.They knew about it.Jiu Wu said with a smile, \u201cWhat can I not bear with? I\u2019m a person with a Dao companion!\u201d\u201cThat was why I brewed this medicinal wine. Martial Uncle, please try it.\u201d\u201cBring it here!\u201dJiu Wu felt great ease. He took this jar of tonic wine and tried a sip of it. After analyzing it carefully for a while, he gulped down a huge mouthful of wine and felt energized at once!\u201cCoincidentally, I\u2019ve just come out of seclusion recently. I have nothing to be scared of!\u201d\u201cMartial Uncle, don\u2019t drink too much in one go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a Perfected Immortal. What should I be afraid of?\u201dThen, the two of them had another cup of wine. Jiu Wu had already been slightly drunk, and his cup and dishes were in a mess.\u201cLittle Changshou, tell me. How are you planning to plot against me?\u201d Jiu Wu hugged the wine jar and frowned. \u201cI\u2019m almost done drinking. I\u2019ll leave soon.\u201dLi Changshou shook his head with a bitter smile and said with a sigh, \u201cActually, I asked you over because I need your help.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cThere is a Nine Color Glazed Array in the array formation that Martial Uncle has given me. I\u2019ve analyzed it for half a month with Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu, but I am still unable to set it up. I want to ask for your guidance.\u201dJiu Wu became happy right away. This Nine Color Glazed Array was a trapping array that he had invented. Even if Li Changshou used this array formation to trap him, he could still get out of it.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll take a look.\u201dJiu Wu put away the medicinal wine. Each of them took the sound-recording ball and went to an open space at the back of the Pill Chamber.There were 81 small copper mirrors on the ground placed in a mysterious position. At one glance, Jiu Wu could see the problem and pointed it out to Li Changshou with a laugh.Li Changshou walked forward with a happy expression. Based on Jiu Wu\u2019s instructions, he adjusted a few copper mirrors, and the 81 copper mirrors instantly flashed brightly. The trapping array had been activated and trapped the two of them.Due to the silvery light around, the plants and birds could no longer be seen.Jiu Wu was calm. He smiled and said, \u201cChangshou, is this how you plan to plot against me? You\u2019ve taken your revenge by being trapped here with me? It\u2019s not nice to deceive yourself.\u201dLi Changshou turned over and replied with a smile, \u201cWhat are you saying, Martial Uncle? Why would I do that?\u201dA wisp of flame blossomed on Li Changshou\u2019s legs and arms all of a sudden.Jiu Wu froze and hurriedly shouted, \u201cWhy are you on fire!\u201d\u201cMartial Uncle, why did you\u2026\u201d Li Changshou shouted in a trembling voice and threw the sound-recording ball in his hand in a random direction.In a blink of an eye, his surroundings had been devoured by the flames. He transformed into a paper doll and was instantly burned in the flame.Jiu Wu\u2019s eyes widened immediately.The spirit flame of the True Samadhi Flames?The Man-Forming Paper Cutouts from the 36 Ways of the Big Dipper?This brat had learned to ignite a spirit flame so quickly? Was there such a brilliant mystical ability?Something was amiss\u2026Jiu Wu suddenly turned around and was surrounded by bright silvery light. At the moment, only he was left in the trapping array.This brat had actually used the sound-recording ball to clear his name!Jiu Wu suddenly saw the light and just scoffed. He calmly started to solve the array formation.\u201cChangshou, you\u2019re still too inexperienced. What crimes are you going to accuse me of at the Punishment Hall?\u201cSheesh! I have overestimated your thinking.\u201cI have many good friends.\u201cMoreover, I was the one who invented this array formation. Can I not find where the Life Gate is?\u201dWhile he said that, Jiu Wu took a few steps forward. The surrounding light and shadows rapidly rotated from a place glowing with white light, to a place glowing with golden light.Jiu Wu\u2019s smile immediately grew stiff. He lowered his head and predicted with his fingers. He could not help but scold, \u201cHow come it\u2019s a chain array again?\u201dHe moved at a fast pace and quickly arrived at a twinkling place.He walked again and turned back to his initial spot filled with silvery light.Even though he leaped up and rushed into the air, he landed in a place with golden light again!By this time, Jiu Wu had realized that this array formation had been altered beyond his imagination. His escape technique had been blocked, and the basic array formation was indeed the Nine Color Glazed Array that he had invented!He had come up with this array formation painstakingly, and it could not be solved by someone who was not a Heaven Immortal.Jiu Wu\u2019s five-feet-tall Dao Body shook and gave off the smell of wine. He quickly predicted in his heart\u2014this scheme had started when Changshou asked Jiu Jiu to talk to him and invite him over to the feast!When he reached the Little Qiong Peak, he found his \u2018Marital Nephew Changshou\u2019 sitting there, cultivating the \u2018Qi flame\u2019 using his immortal senses. He was at fault for not checking for the real one!The feast was just a show, and his true revenge was this array formation.Since Jiu Wu was the one who had invented the trapping array formation, he stepped into the array formation in full confidence, but had forgotten that this brat loved to set up chain arrays the most!However, he had been trapped. So what?Jiu Wu sat cross-legged. He was a Perfected Immortal. So what if he would be trapped for a few months?\u2018Is this how this brat takes his revenge?\u2019Jiu Wu chuckled to himself, but his smile suddenly turned rigid.\u2018So\u2026 So hot\u2026\u2019Jiu Wu\u2019s blood vessels all over his body seemed to be surging frantically. Then he started to sweat, and the turbid Yang Qi in his body quickly expanded\u2026\u2018Oh, no! It\u2019s that medicinal wine! Why did I drink so much earlier?\u2019Jiu Wu felt his immortal body seemed to be burning, and he was breathing heavily as if he was breathing out fire. He had started to break out in hot sweat all over!He immediately attempted to deplete the medicinal effect, but he realized that it had already entered his blood vessels!Jiu Wu instantly stood up, looking very anxious.\u201cMartial Nephew Chang\u2026 Changshou! Let me out!\u201dThat was not right!This fellow wanted to see how pitiful he was!\u2018Bear with it! I have to bear with it!\u2019Jiu Wu was a half-step Heaven Immortal. Could he not resist this bit of medicinal effect? He just had to remember that Shi Shi was waiting for him at the hut, and he could do it after he returned!He was feeling worse. He definitely could not think of his senior sister!He could not make a fool out of himself. This brat\u2019s sound-recording ball was still being used on him!Then, Jiu Wu crushed the sound-recording ball in his hand and meditated again. He quickly recited the Heart Movement Sutra and Heart Cleansing Mantra.An hour later\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll go\u2026 This is a matter of eating. How can I bear this!\u201cChangshou!\u201cChangshou! I admit defeat! In the future, I won\u2019t dare to plot against you anymore! How\u2019s that!\u201dNobody answered him.Jiu Wu turned in circles anxiously. His immortal powers suppressed his turbid Yang Qi, and he walked at will in the trapping array.All of a sudden, he saw a wooden sign written with a few lines of words. He quickly went over to take a look.This was?\u201cHeavenly Dao Oath? Remembrance Oath Sutra? He is this ruthless?\u201cFrom now onward, Jiu Wu shall not be allowed to do anything without permission from the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s disciples of the Little Qiong Peak, disciples of Daoist Priest Qi Yuan, and Martial Nephew Changshou\u2026\u201cI shall not reveal any information about Martial Nephew Changshou to anybody, any Dharma artifacts, any tools\u2026\u201cI shall not\u2026\u201cBut this is making it difficult for me!\u201cThe contents of this oath are sloppy and ordinary. It\u2019s just a matter of keeping it a secret and not making any arrangements in the future.\u201cThe consequences of breaking the oath is so vicious! I have to lose my manly grandeur!\u201dJiu Wu stamped his feet from the anxiety and threw the wooden sign on the ground.\u201cHow can I be coerced!\u201dThe short Daoist bowed and slowly lay down. He continued suppressing his Yang Qi and clenched his teeth to bear with it.A few moments later\u2026He was yelling with red eyes. He stood up, took the wooden sign, and started reciting the Remembrance Oath Mantra aloud. The Heavenly Dao felt it, and there was a dull thunder sound above the Little Qiong Peak!After he finished reading the oath, which was over hundreds of words, the surrounding array formations slowly dissipated, and even the outer array formations closed.Jiu Wu turned around, but he did not find anyone. He leaped up in a flurry and flew towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak.\u201cShi Shi!\u201cShi Shi, you must not enter seclusion! Shi Shi\u2026\u201dAfter Jiu Wu left, Li Changshou\u2019s figure gradually emerged from the grassland. He took his sound-recording ball and carefully put it away. He integrated this trapping array into the surrounding array formations.When he walked to the wooden sign, he looked at the handwriting on it that was starting to fade quickly. Li Changshou revealed an indifferent smile.He had settled this temporarily.\u2026Two months later, it was the day to perform alchemy together.\u201cLittle Shoushou, do you still have the medicinal wine you gave Fifth Senior Brother? Fourth Senior Sister said that she wants to use a few Dharma spell books to exchange for the recipe of the medicinal wine. You\u2019ll take your pick on the Dharma spells.\u201d\u201cThere is still half a jar over there. I\u2019ll give you the recipe later after I sort it out. I\u2019ll choose the strongest Dharma spell,\u201d Li Changshou answered without looking up and continued to separate the herbs in his hands.Jiu Jiu went to the corner. \u201cJust this? It smells very strange!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s only that,\u201d Li Changshou replied with a smile.Just when he lowered his head to continue with his work, he seemed to have remembered something. He said, \u201cWomen cannot drink this wine as they wish! This is the Yang wine specially prepared for men. Something will happen if a woman drinks it.\u201dClang-dong!A wooden ladle dropped to the ground, and wine was splashed out. Jiu Jiu stared at Li Changshou.\u201cWhat\u2026 if a woman drinks this?\u201dShe was so fast?Li Changshou was shocked and could not help having a bitter smile.\u201cUm\u2026 grow a beard? Something like that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She said in lingering fear, \u201cI thought my Yin and Yang would be out of balance, and I would turn into a manly woman.\u201dLi Changshou laughed softly and shook his head. He had always respected his martial aunt\u2019s logical thinking.\u201cMartial Aunt, after I finish refining this furnace of pills, I will probably be in seclusion from half a year to one year and cultivate the True Samadhi Flames. I have prepared a year\u2019s worth of those few kinds of wine for you. However, it won\u2019t be good for you if you drink too much of these. You should drink in moderation. It\u2019s at the same old place on the shelf at the side of the medicinal wine jar.\u201d\u201cHalf a year?\u201dJiu Jiu took those few wine pots and replaced them with a few empty ones. She walked over with her hands at her back and warned him seriously, \u201cAlthough the True Samadhi Flames can be cultivated at the Void Return Realm, what is needed in the beginning is to burn your essence, Qi, and spirit to condense the fire seedling! Don\u2019t rush! Don\u2019t cultivate the Dharma spell into deficit essence Qi, and end up losing your essence, Qi, and spirit! That would be horrible!\u201dLi Changshou nodded his head with a smile and continued to bury his head to separate the herbs.Jiu Jiu yawned helplessly and mumbled, \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck in a bottleneck in the past few years. I have problems in breaking through my cultivation level.\u201cHowever, I have encountered such situations a few times in the past. After I was stuck at the bottleneck for a few years, I managed to break through for no reason.\u201cAfter I break through, I will be entering seclusion for a few years. It might be decades, so you might not see me for a very long time.\u201dLi Changshou replied with a smile, \u201cMartial Aunt, you\u2019ve already mainly cultivated the Inaction Sutra, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jiu Jiu took a bamboo chair over and sat at the side of the table. She rested her head on the table while being bored to death. \u201cWhen you ascend to an immortal, you can also cultivate the Inaction Sutra. If you have good potential, you can also cultivate it at the Void Return Realm.\u201cUnfortunately\u2026\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I heard Fifth Senior Brother say that your master seems to be starting to achieve enlightenment on the Inaction Sutra.\u201d\u201cYes. Two months ago, my master obtained a sutra sent by the sectarian officer within the sect.\u201d Li Changshou casually said, \u201cActually, given your attitude, you\u2019re most suitable to cultivate the Inaction Sutra.\u201dJiu Jiu blinked her eyes. \u201cLittle Changshou, you\u2019re saying the same thing as my master.\u201dLi Changshou replied, \u201cPreviously, Martial Uncle Jiu Wu had also given me Volume One of the Inaction Sutra. Aren\u2019t these words from the sutra?\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d Jiu Jiu murmured to herself and quietly watched Li Changshou sort out the herbs at the side. Unconsciously, she got lost in thoughts\u2026A moment later.\u201cLittle Shoushou\u2026 you\u2019re actually pretty good-looking\u2026 Hehehe\u2026 Why did I not realize that in the past?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dLi Changshou, who had prepared for alchemy, turned his head. He found that his martial aunt had fallen asleep on the table and was mumbling in her sleep.After Immortal Ascension, her immortal body was still pure. Although his martial aunt did not tidy up her mid-length hair all year round, it was still smooth and shiny black.She had a phoenix tail braid without any head ornaments, and she did not put on any cosmetics. She gave people the feeling that she was simple and pure.His martial aunt, who had fallen into a deep sleep, could be described as having good skin and a clear mind.Unfortunately, she was too lively when asleep.Li Changshou shook his head with a smile and walked out of the Pill Chamber quietly. He looked at the little spiritual fish he had raised in the pond, which was shaped like Yin-Yang fish, and waited for Jiu Jiu to take a breather and wake up.After all, he had something to ask her. He could not be too harsh on his martial aunt, as he wanted to use her pure immortal powers for alchemy.After two days, Li Changshou was done with refining pills and temporarily sealed up the Pill Chamber. Then, he activated the array formations within 1.5 kilometers of the Pill Chamber.After he sent Jiu Jiu away, he went to find Lan Ling\u2019e to tell her about his seclusion.Li Changshou was going to condense the fire seedling of the True Samadhi Flames during his seclusion this time, which would take him around half a year.Lan Ling\u2019e, who was dressed in a loose training attire and analyzing the technique of spreading medicine, was suddenly somewhat bewildered.\u201cSenior Brother, are you not entering seclusion in the Pill Chamber?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cause the place to explode while cultivating the True Samadhi Flames,\u201d Li Changshou replied with a smile. \u201cI will do a wooden raft later on and enter seclusion in the middle of the lake. That would be better.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked and wanted to say something but hesitated.Li Changshou put a few porcelain bottles in her hands and told her about the usage and dosage of those bottles of pills.With her mind constantly pondering, Lan Ling\u2019e still asked softly, \u201cSenior Brother, you don\u2019t need to\u2026 hide the True Samadhi Flames?\u201cIsn\u2019t that Dharma spell very formidable?\u201dLi Changshou knocked on his junior sister\u2019s head, with naturally not much force.Despite facing each other, Li Changshou still explained carefully to her by voice transmission, \u201cYou\u2019ve not had my lessons in the past few years. Have you forgotten what I\u2019ve taught you? The True Samadhi Flames were bestowed by the master of Jiu Wu and Jiu Jiu. If I hide it and don\u2019t use it, the others will have more doubts. It\u2019s considered a trump card if the others cannot imagine, guess, or think of any information exposed based on your daily life, rather than just talking about its power.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e stuck her tongue out and learned obediently with her head lowered.Li Changshou took another two porcelain bottles and sent a voice transmission. \u201cPlace these two bottles of pills in front of our master\u2019s house. These are the immortal pills for him to refine, and they have cleansing effects. Don\u2019t try them secretly. You will explode from the medicinal effect of the immortal pills.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e was happy right away. \u201cThen after Master eats them, wouldn\u2019t he\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard.\u201d Li Changshou shook his head and sighed lightly. He wandered to the forest and was prepared to create the wooden rafts that he would be using later on.Lan Ling\u2019e opened the jade bottle to smell it, and pure essence Qi rushed forth.She took a breath lightly and felt heavy in her head. She returned to her house while feeling dizzy and quickly mediated to dispel the medicinal effect.Li Changshou laughed softly upon seeing that. He found an old forest, pulled up his sleeves, and started going all out.Two days later\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e, who had just awakened from her meditation, got up to look outside the window. She opened her mouth and took a few breaths before she felt helpless\u2026\u2018I will do a small wooden raft later on.\u2019When Lan Ling\u2019e recalled what her senior brother had said and looked at the big, \u2018simple\u2019 500-feet tower ship that had just been launched on the lake, she could not help slap her forehead.What had her senior brother misunderstood regarding the size?Lan Ling\u2019e lowered her head to look at the curve on her training attire, and the corners of her mouth twitched.\u2018Stupid Senior Brother, he actually\u2026 lost the concept of size thanks to Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu!\u2019Actually, Li Changshou was not someone who emphasized pleasure. He put more importance on usability when he created some fun things.The small wooden raft was just formed simply by wood, and there were no restrictions. In terms of the difficulty in making it, it was indeed just a gadget.The place where he would enter seclusion had to have a simple warning array, isolation array, and anti-probe array. He needed some space to place and hide the base of these array formations.Apart from that, he still had some plans up his sleeves.The two-floor-high tower ship had a total of seven rooms of similar sizes, with each room interconnected and placed with a cushion.After he later entered seclusion and activated the surrounding array formations, he would also place a few paper dolls in each room.If someone came into contact with the array formations, the paper dolls\u2019 restrictions would be activated right away and transform into his own figure, which would be enough to pass off as genuine!That was simply a necessity to avoid being plotted against!Unfortunately, such a design was still not perfect. He would still have a one-seventh chance of being stabbed to death.\u201cLing\u2019e, I\u2019m going to start seclusion now.\u201dAfter receiving Li Changshou\u2019s voice transmission, Li Changshou quickly walked to the door and waved her hand at him, who was standing on the tower ship.When Li Changshou conjured a seal with both hands, layers of array formations on the wooden raft were activated, covering a huge area of the lake below. The little wooden raft became fuzzier under the layers of light.In a short while, a lot of white mists emerged on the surface of the water. Lan Ling\u2019e could no longer see where her senior brother was.Li Changshou put paper dolls in each room and secretly went to a cabin room. He fumbled to set up an array formation in the corner and opened a secret compartment, where the clear lake water was underneath\u2026After conjuring a seal, he used his Illusion Spell to transform into a spiritual fish, entered the water without a sound, and swam towards the bottom of the water that had been shrouded by layers of array formations, leaving only seven paper dolls in each cabin room.He had made such a huge wooden raft because he wanted to let these few layers of array formations cover the underwater.It was Li Changshou\u2019s third seclusion place at the bottom.When his master had brought little Ling\u2019e up the mountain in the past, he had also entered seclusion here and achieved initial success in condensing the Cold Nether Fire.In the Five Elements, water was able to restrain fire. It was actually an exceptional technique to prevent self-explosion caused by the convergence of too much fire when cultivating a fire spell underwater.However\u2026 a small part of the Little Qiong Peak, which used to be green and lush, was suddenly bare.\u2026The East Ocean, Crystal Palace.\u201cHow dare you, Ao Yi!\u201cHow dare you spout nonsense and disrespect your elders! You have disgraced the prestige of the race, and defamed the honor of the race!\u201cDo\u2026 Do you know what kind of offense this is!\u201dIn the spacious, empty palace of the second prince, the young Ao Yi from the dragon race had been tied to an iron pillar by chains. He closed his eyes tightly and vaguely heard the scoldings at the side of his ear.He sneered and endured the pain on his back, still looking very firm.Ao Yi now felt that this Crystal Palace was very absurd and incomparably ridiculous.When he had stood at the celebration feast on the other day, he faced his father and said, \u201cI want to become a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect and cultivate like the Saint of the Three Schools!\u201dThat shock, disbelief, and change in expression of the dragon\u2019s head\u2026Those ridiculous scoldings due to his disgraceful behavior and disgrace brought upon the dragon race\u2026The aura rushing forth from those dragon experts crushed his 10-year-old body on the spot!The ones who had scolded him on that day were either his father\u2019s brothers or the older dragons. They had the right to scold this nephew of theirs.Those chancellors of those races of the ocean and those generals of the dragon race without the bloodline of the Dragon King had also not dared to utter a word. However, they shot him a contemptuous look.When he had gone to pay respect to the Saints, he had been regarded as disgraceful.When he had gone out to become a disciple and cultivate, he had been regarded as a rebel of the dragon race.This was ridiculous, really ridiculous\u2026\u201cThis is extremely ridiculous!\u201d Ao Yi could not help but berate with a painful look on his delicate face.Ice-cold force appeared on the iron pillar behind his back, and icicles pierced through his fair, clear, and smooth back, causing Ao Yi to tremble from the pain.However, he still had a sober gaze, and his determination did not vanish at all!A few moments ago, his mother had just left and persuaded him to admit his mistakes early\u2026\u201cMy son, are the skills from our race not enough for you to learn? Are the treasures from our race not enough for you to play with?\u201cWhy did you have to do such absurd things, and even say those absurd words before so many uncles of our race?\u201cYou want to join the Saints, but did you know that they don\u2019t take in disciples from the dragon race except for the Jie School?\u201cThat Chan School\u2019s master had taken in an illegitimate dragon as his disciple in the past. He had used his treasures to strip away the last destiny from the dragon race and placed them on his disciple.\u201cHow can our race forget such a humiliation?\u201cMy son, who has confused you?\u2019How could Ao Yi not understand these words from his mother and know the truth?One of the 12 Golden Immortals of the Chan School, Perfected Yellow Dragon, was clearly a bloodline of the Ancestral Dragon. Back then, he had only been seriously injured and landed in the Kunlun Mountains. He had been cared for by the Three Pure Ones, who had yet to become Saints, and became an ornamental dragon of the Three Pure Ones.Before the Ancient Saint had appeared, the dragon race had treated that as a disgrace. They had severed all ties with Perfected Yellow Dragon and even removed his name from the Dragon Registry.Afterward, the Three Pure Ones had become Saints. The dragon race had not been able to put down their dignity to curry favor with Perfected Yellow Dragon. Instead, they had started to spread rumors within the race and called him an illegitimate dragon.As for the so-called Saints did not take in disciples of the dragon race\u2026After the Three Pure Ones had become Saints, a group of experts from the dragon race had brought the young dragon forward to be a disciple at the Golden Turtle Island and were very respectful to the Saints.However, they had heard that the Grandmaster of Heaven took in the least disciples. He had only allowed the most outstanding disciples of the dragon race to become disciples of the Saints. They had not become a disciple of the Saints directly. The experts of the dragon race had turned back and felt that the Saints were humiliating them\u2026What kind of absurdity was that?This was absurd!Ao Yi trembled lightly all over, and the light on the iron pillar on his back gradually weakened.\u2018I, Ao Yi, have to endure this.\u2019Only he, the Second Prince of the Dragon King, could completely become humble and a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, which had a rank in the middle of the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools\u2026Even if he knelt before the Immortal Du Sect and became an in-name disciple\u2026 could he break through the pointless arrogance of the dragon race and tear apart their twisted self-esteem!If these humiliations still could not awaken the dead-drunk dragon race, then he would stand on the peak of all spirits as a Saint!At that time, he would ask these ancient elders\u2026 what was the way out for the dragon race!?After taking a breath, Ao Yi opened his mouth and screamed, \u201cLet me out! I want to see my father! I want to go to the Immortal Du Sect, and become a disciple and learn the Dao!\u201dA group of maidservants outside the hall felt sorry for him on their teary, delicate faces. However, they were stopped by the flood dragon troops and could not go near the Second Prince.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree months later, above the Crystal Palace deep in the East Ocean\u2026After a series of matters\u2014the young dragon rebelling, his mother pleading for him, and his father ordering a thorough investigation\u2014a fish spirit, who was a musician teaching the prince in the ocean, became a scapegoat. The fish spirit had been cut into pieces on the spot and put between scallions, ginger, vinegar, and garlic\u2026It was unfortunate and lamentable.During the Primordial Times, there was no wasabi, and the way of sashimi had yet to be perfected.Presently, the Second Prince of the Dragon Palace, Ao Yi, was tied to a huge immortal cowrie ship, which was speeding to the border between the South Ocean and the East Ocean.Besides Ao Yi, there were only a few flood dragon troops and a Turtle Immortal with white eyebrows and beard on the ship.This Turtle Immortal, who had retired a long time ago, sat beside Ao Yi and was trying to persuade him with deep sighs.\u201cYour Majesty, how did you get involved with the tiny Immortal Du Sect?\u201cWhat virtues and capabilities do they have? Even if His Majesty let you become a disciple there, he would not dare to take you in either.\u201cYou have to think of His Majesty too. He is now holding his ground amid the opinions of the masses, and suppressing all the voices so that you can go and become a disciple of a Saint!\u201cThis time, I will take you to become a disciple under the great immortal of the Three Saints of that Dao Sect, the Black Cloud Immortal.\u201cAlthough this great immortal does not have a high reputation, he is ranked first among the seven immortals in the Jie School and is thought highly of by the Three Saints of the Dao Sect. He only has one golden turtle, who comes from the same race as me, as his disciple. Back then, we had some friendly relations too.\u201cYour Majesty, this is going according to your wishes.\u201cDon\u2019t create any more big trouble!\u201dAo Yi turned his head to look at one side, still looking unresigned.However, he was only 10 years old, after all. Even though he had received many years of \u2018egg education\u2019, he had truly been born for 10 years.The old turtle kept persuading him at the side, and Ao Yi gradually hesitated.\u201cDoes this great immortal have any methods to become a Saint?\u201d\u201cThat is for sure!\u201dThe Turtle Immortal seized the opportunity and started telling Ao Yi about how impressive this great immortal was, and how the Grandmaster of Heaven liked him. However, he was rather low-profile and did not reveal his talents outside.Soon, the Turtle Immortal sighed and sent a voice transmission to Ao Yi.\u201cYour Majesty, I can see what you\u2019re trying to do. However, this isn\u2019t as simple as you think it is. You will not obtain a good outcome by just tormenting yourself.\u201cFlaunting is just like a dream. It becomes frozen after you wake up from the dream. Nobody is willing to wake up from it.\u201cYou have to empathize with His Majesty. He is the person sitting at the highest seat in the dragon race, so he cannot do anything easily. Otherwise, the place will be in danger.\u201dAo Yi pondered and then gradually nodded his head.\u2018In short, I can now roam around the huge Primordial World at will outside the Dragon Palace.\u2019To become a disciple of the great immortal, he still had to rely on his status as the prince of the Dragon Palace. How could he get rid of the embarrassment of the Dragon Palace?Which of the few other disciples of the Dragon Palace could become a disciple of a great immortal?What he needed to search was the way out for the dragon race, and not the way out for himself, the Second Prince of the East Ocean\u2019s Dragon Palace!He had to first secure this Turtle immortal. He would talk about any other things someday in the future.In the roaring ocean breeze, Ao Yi gradually revealed a smile on his face, showing the \u2018innocence\u2019 that was just like his own age. That Turtle Immortal was gradually relieved.\u2026Deep in the dense forest of the Heaven-Breaking Peak in the Immortal Du Sect at the Nine Jiu Immortals\u2019 cultivation ground.Jiu Jiu\u2019s huge gourd drifted over from the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s direction. As if she had no energy, she walked back to her own house in a crestfallen manner. She slowly sat down on the wooden steps in front of the house and slowly leaned down.She lay down softly, just like a melting clay figurine, hugging her gourd and lying there for a long while.\u201cI\u2019m so bored. It has only been three months since Little Shoushou entered seclusion. Why do I feel that it seems more than three years? Nobody is playing with me\u2026\u201d\u201cEven Senior Sister is accompanied by Senior Brother, while he goes to accompany someone else.\u201cAfter Big Senior Sister and Second Senior Brother, Fourth Senior Sister and Fifth Senior Brother, Sixth Senior Sister and Seventh Senior Brother, it should be time for Eighth Senior Brother to be with Ninth Junior Sister. I didn\u2019t expect Eighth Senior Brother to follow in Third Senior Sister\u2019s steps and go out of the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026\u201cAs the Ninth Junior Sister with a bitter fate, I have to be lonely without anyone accompanying me\u2026\u201cI\u2019m even Master\u2019s final disciple. Ugh\u2026\u201dThe windows of the house next door were pushed open, looking radiant. Jiu Shi, who had seemed to be hundreds of years younger recently, looked over at this side. After hearing Jiu Jiu harping on something, she could not help laughing.Jiu Shi drifted out from the window, wearing a rainbow-colored dress like a fairy in a painting, and landed beside Jiu Jiu. She sat on the wooden steps and pinched Jiu Jiu\u2019s nose.\u201cSenior Sister.\u201d Jiu Jiu hugged Jiu Shi and closed her eyes before she howled in grief, \u201cAccompany me to the Little Qiong Peak! I want to play Fight the Great God! I want to play Immortal Life Simulation!\u201dJiu Shi suddenly laughed softly and patted her little junior sister\u2019s head. \u201cFoolish Junior Sister, how can I go to the Little Qiong Peak?\u201d\u201cHuh? Why not, Senior Sister?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you feel embarrassed if I go there?\u201d\u201cWhat should I be embarrassed about?\u201dJiu Jiu cranked her head. \u201cFourth Senior Sister, did you misunderstand something? I\u2019m just having an aunt-nephew relationship with Little Shoushou.\u201d\u201cOh? Is that so?\u201dJiu Shi smiled with her eyes full of aggression.Jiu Jiu could not help but blink and shrink her neck. \u201cIsn\u2019t\u2026 that so?\u201d\u201cRight. A martial aunt and martial nephew perform alchemy and set up array formations every day, are with each other for the whole day, and are very intimate.\u201d\u201cWhat intimate! He is sick!\u201dJiu Shi froze and quickly asked, \u201cWhat illness does he have? Martial Nephew Changshou has an unmentionable disease? That is a huge problem.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an unmentionable disease. Little Shoushou cannot be touched by any woman besides his junior sister. Otherwise, he would twitch all over.\u201dJiu Jiu said with a smile, \u201cHe watched his junior sister grow up, so he is fine with her. He\u2019s also fine with me if it\u2019s just touching fists or high-five.\u201dJiu Shi hugged her arms and muttered to herself before suddenly saying, \u201cHow did this illness come about? Can you tell me in detail?\u201d\u201cWhen I brought Little Shoushou to the North Continent the last time\u2026\u201dA moment later, Jiu Shi hugged her Ninth Junior Sister and laughed. She said something to Jiu Jiu, which made the latter be at a loss. Then, she could not help but rest her forehead on her hand.\u201cThis brat actually dared to deceive me!\u201d\u201cCalm down, Little Jiu. Such a man who preserves his chastity is a treasure rarely seen in the world. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity.\u201dJiu Jiu was suddenly embarrassed and stamped her feet in anger. \u201cSenior Sister, what are you talking about! How I can be with him!\u201cOh my, I\u2019m going back to seclusion!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to be a guard at the Priming Meet after a few days?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right\u2026 Can\u2019t I enter seclusion for a few days?\u201dJiu Jiu got away and went to her house. Jiu Shi laughed softly and drifted after her.\u201cLittle Jiu, you don\u2019t have to be shy in front of me. I\u2019ll teach you how to dress and apply makeup first\u2026\u201d\u201cEh, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cCome on! Let me have a look at your current figure.\u201d\u201cFourth Senior Sister, don\u2019t touch me anyhow\u2026 This is annoying! Aiya!\u201dAs the sun set in the west, the laughter of the two fairies drifted here and there nearby.In the house next door, a short Daoist, who looked deeply in trouble and haggard, shook his head and activated the array outside Jiu Jiu\u2019s house.Then, he looked at the complete dine-and-dash meal on the table in front, and the corners of his mouth could not help but twitch.Jiu Jiu was still going to be a guard at the Priming Meet in the North Continent this time because there had been a small problem the other time. This time, the sect had sent a Perfected Immortal to go with her.Only two people were going to the North Continent.On the day of the Priming Meet, the disciple representative Youqin Xuanya, whose reputation had recently surged more and more, carried her own huge sword on her back and was wearing a fiery-red dress. She appeared at the venue on time.However, when everyone had split into teams, she did not join in the practice. Instead, she turned and went back to her cave abode for seclusion.Thus, the two disciples heading to the North Continent received superb treatment of having secret guards exclusive for a Perfected Immortal.Going to and from the North Continent took several months. In the few months after returning, Jiu Jiu had kept remembering what her Fourth Senior Sister had told her previously.Gradually, Jiu Jiu, who had thought that she had no other feelings for Li Changshou besides being purely playmates, started to immerse in self-doubt.Could it be that she had feelings for Little Changshou and she didn\u2019t know about that?That was impossible. Although having a martial aunt-martial nephew relationship was a little exciting, she had always been taking care of Little Changshou as her junior. However, she had been careless and had been fed by him\u2026As Jiu Jiu thought more about this, she felt so confused that she could not concentrate while meditating.Another few months had passed again. When the paper crane, which brought the message that Li Changshou wanted to invite her for alchemy, landed in her hand, Jiu Jiu jumped in joy.Then, she froze.\u201cMy heart couldn\u2019t have been really moved by a martial nephew, who is only around 100 years old, right?\u201d\u2018There are some words that you will only know after asking.\u2019Fourth Senior Sister\u2019s laughter was still winding around her ear. Jiu Jiu sat on the bed and muttered to herself before she lifted her hand to smash the bed board.\u2018What are you afraid of? Just go ask him!\u2019Jiu Jiu changed into a clean hemp garment, sat on the huge gourd, and rushed to the Little Qiong Peak.This time, Li Changshou wanted to refine poisonous pills so that he could be more prepared when he went out for the Tribulation Transcendence.By the time Jiu Jiu rushed over, Li Changshou had prepared various kinds of poisonous herbs and put himself in layers of protective equipment.After Jiu Jiu had worn such a cumbersome \u2018protective suit\u2019 for the first time, she had never heeded his advice to wear it for the second time.This made Li Changshou extra careful in controlling the poisonous pills\u2019 toxin circulation when he was refining pills each time, lest he accidentally provided immortal powers for his martial aunt.During alchemy, the two of them were talking endlessly just like before.However, Jiu Jiu was still thinking about what her Fourth Senior Sister had said. Despite the 32-hours alchemy and her trying to ask dozens of times, she could not find the appropriate context.\u2018It\u2019s just one sentence. Why is it so hard to ask?\u2018I couldn\u2019t have\u2026\u2018How is that possible? Am I someone who goes for someone younger? Ask him, and everything will be fine!\u2019Jiu Jiu took a deep breath and lifted her hand to tidy up her hair ends at the side of her ear while looking at Li Changshou, who was concentrating at the side.With her utmost effort, she asked in the weakest tone, \u201cHow\u2026 did I\u2026 perform during the alchemy this time?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing well as usual,\u201d Li Changshou answered with a laugh in his suit. \u201cMartial Aunt, your immortal powers are indeed very helpful.\u201dThe poisonous pills trembled slightly, and Li Changshou immediately adjusted the pill effect.Jiu Jiu blinked her eyes and continued to adjust her voice.\u201cThen Martial Nephew Changshou\u2026 what do you\u2026 think of me\u2026\u201dDuring the crucial moment for the pill formation, Li Changshou, who was concentrating on controlling the properties of the poisonous pills, could not hear her properly since he was wearing too many anti-poison Dharma artifacts and Jiu Jiu had spoken too softly. He only heard \u2018Martial Nephew\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019.However, the topic they had always been discussing seemed to be\u2026Li Changshou nodded lightly and replied with a smile without turning back, \u201cVery much and very stable. What is even rarer is that it is pure, without any impurities.\u201dLi Changshou frowned and stared at the poisonous pills that were going to form soon in the furnace. He added, \u201cIf only I could also have[1] it.\u201dJiu Jiu opened her mouth slightly\u2014she was petrified!She pointed at Li Changshou with a trembling finger.\u201cDo\u2026 Do you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201dLi Changshou answered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did I say anything wrong?\u201d\u2018Did I say anything wrong!\u2018Very strong, and what is even rarer is that it is pure, to the point without any impurities.\u2018If I could only have it\u2026\u2019Who was so disgraceful like that?Jiu Jiu\u2019s slightly round face instantly blushed red from her neck downward. Wisps of white smoke seeped through her forehead.She took half a step back and wanted to say something, but her voice was trembling. She turned around and dashed to the distance. After two steps, she rushed into the air and flew toward the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026\u201cEh?\u201dLi Changshou was disturbed by the sound of the wind and turned around to look in confusion.\u2018She left? She\u2019s not going to take her wine reward today?\u2019Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu\u2019s immortal powers were indeed very stable, powerful, and pure. Otherwise, she could not have achieved pill formation in her first furnace of pills and saved his eight other materials!He wished he could have such genuine immortal powers like Martial Aunt Jiu. However, he was going to go through the Tribulation Transcendence soon.\u2018Um, Martial Aunt wouldn\u2019t have misunderstood anything, right?\u2019 Li Changshou quickly reacted. \u2018Nevermind. Concentrate and prepare for pill formation!\u2019He could just explain these trivial matters later on.In between the group of mountain peaks in the Immortal Du Sect\u2026Jiu Jiu, who sat and flew on the huge gourd, took the wine gourd on her waist and raised her head before making gulping sounds. Then, she hit the forest halfway up the mountains on the Heaven-Breaking Peak just like an arrow taking off, causing the entire forest to shake lightly and birds flying everywhere\u2026A little fairy in a hemp garment was lying on the fallen leaves of the thick growth of grass under the tree in the forest. She covered her face with her pair of delicate hands and breathed heavily.But soon, she heaved a sigh of relief. Her delicate face was flushed red. One of her fair arms covered her forehead while the other was lifted to block the sunlight from the gaps in the treetop.\u201cVery pure\u2026\u201cPooh! What am I talking about? Seriously!\u201dShe took out\u2026 those brightly-colored immortal dresses, which her Fifth Senior Brother had given and Fourth Senior Sister had made for her, from the storage sack.\u201cWhat am I thinking about again? He\u2019s my martial nephew!\u201dJiu Jiu quickly threw the storage sack. Not long after that, she turned to look at it.It was not that she could not give it a try. She just would not let anyone else see\u2026[1] It can also mean be pregnant in this context.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wouldn\u2019t I corrupt someone\u2019s eyes if I wear this out?\u201cThis is even more alluring. The most important place is not even covered well! Did Fourth Senior Sister wear this for Fifth Senior Brother to see?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. I think I have to wear them all\u2026Hee hee, he he\u2026Since early morning, Jiu Jiu had been busy in her house until the afternoon. She had always been standing in front of her house with her delicate hands on the doorknob, unable to pull it open for the time being.\u2018I just have to go out for a stroll!\u2018Yes, I just have to go out for a stroll\u2026\u2019After taking in a light breath, Jiu Jiu slowly pulled open the wooden door in front of her and stepped out with her blue embroidered flower cloth shoes.In a split second, there was a rainbow in the mountain farmland shrouded by this large array formation.A few gazes were seen, and voices were heard\u2026When they heard a few clanking sounds, the disciples going to draw water in the Pill Chamber had a slip on their carrying poles, the disciples clearing up the weeds in the flowerbed dropped their hoes, while the young ladies holding onto a few bottles of pills threw the trays in their hands.\u201cAhem!\u201dJiu Jiu cleared her throat and walked half a step forward with her hands behind her back. She subconsciously straightened her body with her head high, scanning every place calmly.A few male disciples quickly lowered their heads and pretended not to see it, but they secretly looked up to take a few peeks. A young man, who had just gone up the mountains not long ago, flushed red.\u2018It\u2019s no big deal! Isn\u2019t wearing anything the same? I didn\u2019t offend public morals. I\u2019m wearing more than my usual short dress and blouse.\u2019Jiu Jiu licked her lips, looking very hesitant. However, she quickly made up her mind. She had nearly forgotten to summon the huge gourd that she had brought out and turned it ten feet long.She was supposed to get used to sitting up. However, it was awkward when she thought about her current dressing\u2014she was in a light pink dress, which was made from unknown material but was still light.Therefore, she gathered up her dress and gently crossed her leg over the other. She sat on the front of the huge gourd and rose to the sky.Just when she flew out of the Heaven-Breaking Peak, she saw a short Daoist with dark circles on both eyes on the white clouds. He drifted over slowly while holding onto a scroll.Jiu Jiu stopped her gourd, used her immortal power on it, and coughed deliberately.\u201cCough! Cough, cough!\u201dJiu Wu, who passed by, looked up at her and revealed a courteous smile to her. He cupped his fists while holding onto the scroll and landed halfway on the mountain.Jiu Jiu froze and rolled her eyes before sitting on the gourd and continued her journey.Jiu Wu, who had landed in a large array, looked down all of a sudden.\u201cI seem to have seen\u2026 Junior Sister just now?\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. She has always been wearing the same set of clothes for hundreds of years. How could she have dressed like that?\u201cI must have seen it wrongly.\u201cI\u2019m at the losing end recently. Fortunately, Senior Sister is finally in seclusion. I can finally replenish my strength.\u201dAfter sighing, Jiu Wu continued studying the \u201932 Methods of Cultivating Essence and Consolidating Qi\u2019 scroll in his hands while going towards his house.Just when he walked into his house, the short Daoist smelled a lingering fragrance from a fairy and could not help but feel an inexplicable chill.His body had responded. It was purely a physical response.He had always been deeply attracted to Fourth Senior Sister, with his love being more than gold. He definitely was not afraid at all!Jiu Wu then recalled his heroic performance during this period and revealed a knowing smile\u2026Ever since he had drunk the Poisonous Dragon Wine concocted by Martial Nephew Changshou, even though his waist had become more flexible, he had much more confidence before his senior sister, and he was on better terms with his Dao companion. Cultivating the Dao to seek longevity became more pleasurable and interesting.However, he was still unhappy about that brat playing tricks on him.Jiu Wu muttered to himself and was lost in thoughts as he sat behind the desk.\u2018Pay someone back his own coins?\u2018Develop something similar to this pill to lure him to this array formation?\u2018This brat might really endure it and won\u2019t be embarrassed\u2026 Then I\u2019ll ask Little Jiu to help add fuel to the fire?\u2018Um, that will not work. Am I giving him benefits or playing a trick on him? If Junior Sister doesn\u2019t retaliate, wouldn\u2019t I be at the losing end!?\u2018I\u2019m restricted by that oath to have a battle of wits and guts with this brat! I have lesser ways, but this is even more interesting.\u2019\u201cWait for it, little thief! I will eventually find your loophole!\u201d\u2026When Jiu Jiu flew to the sky above the Little Qiong Peak, she pursed her lips and could not help muttering to herself, \u201cSeriously, how come these few people I met on the way sized me up with a strange gaze? Aren\u2019t they afraid of being beaten up?\u201dThe huge gourd slowly landed. Her spiritual senses scanned the Little Ling Peak to find that Li Changshou was teaching Lan Ling\u2019e.Jiu Jiu blinked her eyes and deliberately concealed her aura fluctuation. She wanted to see how the two of them would react when she suddenly appeared.She wouldn\u2019t scare them, right?Jiu Jiu frowned and felt somewhat helpless.As she sneakily approached the straw hut, she heard a clear voice from inside even from a distance.\u201cThe state of mind is insignificant, and the Dao manifests in it; The Qi returns to the sea, and condenses in the primordial soul.\u201cIn this sentence, the hardest thing to understand is \u2018the Qi returns to the sea\u2019. The Qi here does not refer to one\u2019s cultivated Dharma powers, clear Qi, or turbid Qi. It refers to the little connate essence Qi in one\u2019s body.\u201cThis is a treasure from the mother\u2019s womb, and is very important for cultivators\u2026\u201dLi Changshou was sitting on a round-backed chair in the house, looking very relaxed. Lan Ling\u2019e was listening carefully to him on the meditation cushion.Jiu Jiu walked into the house quietly on tiptoes. Then, she turned around and lifted her arms to do a tiger claw posture while rushing inside and shouting, \u201cHurrah!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e, who sat sitting with her eyes closed, could not help but laugh. On the other hand, Li Changshou put the sutra from his hand down helplessly and looked at Jiu Jiu, who had changed her dressing, with a smile.Jiu Jiu widened her eyes and said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys frightened?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e pretended to be flustered and slightly shouted, \u201cAiya! I\u2019ve been scared by Martial Aunt!\u201dHowever, just when she turned her head, she could not help but exclaim, \u201cMartial Aunt, why are you suddenly\u2026 suddenly wearing a dress?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t I wear it?\u201dJiu Jiu secretly observed Li Changshou\u2019s reaction. When she turned in a circle in front of Lan Ling\u2019e, her dress and beautiful hair floated lightly, causing the house to be filled with a faint fragrance.At that moment, Lan Ling\u2019e was also secretly watching her senior brother\u2019s reaction. When she found him nodding his head with a smile, she was slightly relieved.\u2018It\u2019s good that Senior Brother wasn\u2019t startled.\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e said in a soft laugh, \u201cOf course, you can. Martial Aunt is usually very pretty, but you\u2019re even more dazzling now. I wouldn\u2019t dare to drift on the white cloud with you!\u201dJiu Jiu blinked her eyes at Li Changshou. \u201cChangshou, what\u2026 do you think?\u201d\u201cVery nice.\u201d Li Changshou nodded his head and praised her.When a woman had a good relationship with himself, just like his junior sister and martial aunt in front of him, and they suddenly changed into a new dress or a new piece of head ornament, and sought praises, he should not be stingy with praises as an elegant man.However, when he thought that there might have been misunderstandings the day before, Li Changshou added, \u201cI might be a little not used to it after looking at it all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dJiu Jiu looked down at what she had matched after carefully picking them for half a day, looking somewhat disappointed.At the side, Lan Ling\u2019e sighed in her heart.\u2018Senior Brother is still like this, as expected\u2026\u2018It\u2019s really too hard to approach such a person like him who can\u2019t wait to refuse any karma.\u2018This is troublesome, indeed.\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e very soon revealed a faint, slight smile and took the initiative to go over. She whispered at Jiu Jiu\u2019s ear, \u201cMartial Aunt, is this your first time dressing up like this?\u201dJiu Jiu quickly replied, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I wanted to change my dressing style all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re dressed like this, having light makeup is more suitable.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e whispered something at Jiu Jiu\u2019s ear, and Jiu Jiu\u2019s eyes lit up before she pulled Lan Ling\u2019e to behind the screen at the side.Upon seeing that, Li Changshou shook his head slightly and continued to read with the slip held up. When he heard them chattering with a low voice, he thought a little in his heart without any change in his expression.Not long after, amid Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s constant exclamation, Jiu Jiu came out from behind the screen and looked at Li Changshou while being pleased with herself.\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201dLi Changshou looked up and smiled even wider.At that moment, it seemed that his martial aunt had become another person. She had put on face powder, drew the ends of her eyebrows thinly, put on some rouge, moistened her red lips, wore a thin silk skirt and a lined jacket, and had phoenix tail braids. She seemed more exquisite than before and had more feminine charms.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Li Changshou showed her a thumbs-up. \u201cYou are the top three most beautiful among the women I\u2019ve seen!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dJiu Jiu blinked her eyes. For some reason, the kind of strange, subtle feelings entangled in her heart over the past two days had dissipated. She felt happy and relieved as a result.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true. Do you have a misunderstanding of your own charms?\u201d Li Changshou replied with a smile, \u201cMartial Aunt, you usually don\u2019t wear makeup, and you\u2019re already a person that many male disciples in the sect admire.\u201d\u201cPooh, how can that be?\u201d Jiu Jiu rolled her eyes, but her eyes were still smiling. She said indifferently, \u201cI don\u2019t care much about these. After all, I cultivate the Dao to seek longevity.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. Are you still giving a lesson?\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do so, let\u2019s play Fight the Great Gods!\u201dLi Changshou said, \u201cGiving a lesson is something I need to do after all\u2026\u201d\u201cMartial Aunt, you rarely come here!\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e hugged Jiu Jiu\u2019s arm. \u201cFight the Great Gods!\u201dLi Changshou could not help but rest his forehead on his hand. How could it be \u2018rarely\u2019 when she came around seven to eight times a month?Jiu Jiu firmly agreed. \u201cFight the Great Gods!\u201d\u201cAlright. Since the two of you are so excited, we\u2019ll find a chance to give Ling\u2019e another lesson later on.\u201dLi Changshou shook his head. The two of them were already cheering at the side, and skillfully set up the short table and cushions.When she sat down, Jiu Jiu felt somewhat awkward. She used Li Changshou\u2019s straw hut next door to change back into her most comfortable hemp garment, short blouse, and short skirt. She replaced the shoes with embroidered flowers into soft, comfortable, special straw shoes and removed the light makeup on her face.This straw was not just ordinary straw. This was the immortal grass that Jiu Wu had meticulously nurtured\u2026This was indeed much more comfortable.Before Jiu Jiu went out of the straw hut, she recalled Li Changshou\u2019s tone earlier on.\u2018Top three most beautiful!\u2019Jiu Jiu unconsciously smiled and mumbled, \u201cThis brat is really disgraceful. He even dared to say such things.\u201dJiu Jiu opened the door and rushed to the straw hut next door like the wind. Competing voices were heard after some time\u2026\u201cFight the Great Gods!\u201d\u201cDouble!\u201d\u201cExtra double!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the great god this round. I\u2019m a little immortal. Extra double. I have 12 Spirit Stones at the moment.\u201d\u201cMake your move, Ling\u2019e!\u201cI have 17 cards. Can you defeat me today?\u201d\u2026When it was quiet in the middle of the night, Li Changshou left the straw hut.His martial aunt and junior sister were a little drunk. At the moment, they were sound asleep on the bed. He was in charge of closing the door and opening the array, lest their pitiful look was seen by others the next morning.When he returned to the Pill Chamber, he entered the secret underground room. Li Changshou sat on the meditation cushion at the corner, closed his eyes, and concealed his spirit and Qi.A ball of orange-red flame slowly condensed between his palms and was later absorbed into his body. It started to slowly roam around and forge his primordial soul and Dao Body.Nine-petaled lotus flowers slowly circulated him. At the moment, these lotus flowers were the size of a fist, and the veined patterns on them were incomparably clear. They had become more perfect and had indistinct, mysterious Dao runes.However, Li Changshou still felt that it was lacking. Thus, he was hesitant to enter the Ninth Stage of the Dao Requital Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve broken through the bottleneck! Ling\u2019e, remember to tell your senior brother. I\u2019ll go back first to seclusion!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 huh? She broke through after waking up?\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e responded in a daze. When she opened her eyes, she saw Jiu Jiu finding her shoes on the floor.At that moment, Martial Aunt Jiu was rather excited. Her cultivation level once again took another firm step towards the Heaven Immortal Realm. She rushed out of the straw hut and hopped onto the gourd before quickly going to the Heaven-Breaking Peak.\u201cRemember to let your senior brother know that I\u2019ll help him with alchemy once I come out of seclusion\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e was in a daze at the side of the bed for a while. After yawning twice, she walked to the dresser.When she recalled the trivial matter that her martial aunt had done the day before, Lan Ling\u2019e smiled and then sighed.\u2018It\u2019s really carefree after Immortal Ascension.\u2019\u201cJunior Sister.\u201dA voice transmission entered her ear, and she subconsciously responded, \u201cHere!\u201dLi Changshou continued his voice transmission. \u201cI\u2019ve heard what Martial Aunt has said. I will roughly enter seclusion for three months. After that, I might go out. Do you need any pills? I will only return after three to five years this time.\u201d\u2018Senior Brother\u2026 is going out to go through his Tribulation Transcendence?\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e was happy but then pouted unhappily.She was naturally happy for her senior brother and was unhappy because he would only return after three to five years. He had not left her for that long ever since she had gone up the mountains.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I need. Senior Brother, you just have to take good care of yourself,\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e mumbled softly.Peals of laughter were heard in the voice transmission. Li Changshou warned her, \u201cI will wake up Master before I leave and tell him not to enter seclusion in the next few years. Remember not to run all around the place. You have to always remember what I\u2019ve previously told you at all times, and don\u2019t be carelessly bullied.\u201d\u201cI got it, Senior Brother. It isn\u2019t too late to say these after you come out of seclusion.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e turned her eyes. \u201cAre you going to slip away?\u201dLi Changshou laughed in the Pill Chamber and did not send a voice transmission anymore.He looked down at the wisp of blue light emerging in his palm.He had not expected the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital to come much earlier.Currently, his Dao Realm was like\u2026 having rapid growth. It had the urge to soar at any time. Thankfully, it could still be suppressed.After attaining the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital, he would very likely face the Heavenly Tribulation.The Tribulation Transcendence had to be also put in his itinerary.Li Changshou had long decided to go out to face the Tribulation Transcendence. Firstly, he did not want to reveal his cultivation level. Secondly, he did not want others to watch his Heavenly Tribulation.After all, the Tribulation Transcendence was his own matter, and the mountain-protecting array formation was not affected at all.He would find a hidden place outside without any people to go through his Tribulation Transcendence, which was not much different from the sect\u2019s safety factor.However, if he wanted to successfully slip away from the sect, he had to spend some effort.Li Changshou sighed lightly.\u201cFortunately, there are still fish.\u201d\u2026The rules of the Immortal Du Sect were strict, but most were targeted at the disciples that had yet to achieve Immortal Ascension. They restricted the disciples\u2019 speech and actions, supervised their cultivation, and ensured their safety.Among the Immortal Du Sect disciples, Li Changshou was an outstanding cultivator in the Second Stage of the Void Return Realm. Therefore, there were rather strict restrictions on him to go out.This was one of the reasons he had chosen to go to the Priming Meet in the North Continent to search for herbs.For the sake of going out of the sect to face Tribulation Transcendence, Li Changshou had already prepared to go to the Bai Fan Hall to apply for a reason to go out. The disciples had one chance to go back to their hometown and visit the grave.Since he had joined the immortal sect, he was not linked to the mortal world anymore. Hence, he should completely sever ties with them.However, a human heart was grown from the flesh, while the Dao Heart also had tribulation in the mortal world.The forefathers of the human race thought highly of loyalty and filial piety. Although cultivators had broken free from the mortal world, they could not mourn in front of their parents who had raised them. They should visit their graveand worship them.The Immortal Du Sect had done pretty well in this by learning from many major sects from the Middle Continent.After new disciples, who came from the mortal world, entered the sect, an outer sect sectarian officer would be especially in charge of that. Every decade, they would look after the new disciples\u2019 parents and give them gold and silver for their livelihood. They would also tell them how the disciples were doing in the sect, and give them some pills to remove their illnesses and talismans to avoid a calamity. However, they would not extend their lifespan.Life and death were destined, and fate was limited. The Immortal Du Sect did not want to attract too much unnecessary karma, either.After the disciples\u2019 parents passed away, they would also let that disciple know and allow them to go back to their hometown for three years to pay respects to their parents so that they could completely break off any links with the mortal world.Eighteen years ago, Li Changshou had been informed by the sect that his parents in the mortal world had both passed away.Under the care of the Immortal Du Sect, his parents, who were ordinary herdsmen in the nomadic tribe in the South Continent, had lived over 100 years old without suffering any illnesses or calamity in their lifetime.Li Changshou actually did not have much impression on his parents in this lifetime. After all, he had been brought to the mountains by his master very early on. He had exchanged a lifetime of clothing and food for them. They did not need to worry or suffer illnesses, and they had faced fewer calamities.When he had received the notice from the sect, Li Changshou had wanted to visit their graveright away. However, since he was prepared to go through Tribulation Transcendence outside, it had been suppressed temporarily.This was somewhat troublesome.If the outer sectarian officer passed by the disciples\u2019 hometown while doing errands outside in the three years that the disciples visited their parents\u2019 graves, they would have to take a look at the disciples\u2019 current situation.Li Changshou had made preparations regarding this point. He had long been on good terms with the \u2018elders\u2019 of the Bai Fan Hall, who were in charge of the disciples.He truly had a good friendship with them.This elder was not like the other elders.Most of the elders in the Bai Fan Hall were old Perfected Immortals. For example, Elder Ge was in charge of matters inside and out of the sect.The true elders of the Immortal Du Sect were cultivating in different peaks, and they did not ask about miscellaneous matters. They could not obtain this reputation unless they were at the Heaven Immortal Realm.Three months later.Li Changshou shouted to wake up his master, who was in seclusion, and told him that he had to go back to his hometown to visit the grave, and his master had to take care of his junior sister.Old Daoist priest Qi Yuan naturally allowed him. He did not think much about it, and he even persuaded Li Changshou to put down the link he had with the mortal world early and concentrate on the Immortal Dao.On the other hand, Lan Ling\u2019e could not bear to part with him and asked softly, \u201cCan I\u2026 accompany Senior Brother there\u2026\u201d\u201cHave a guess.\u201d Li Changshou smiled, and Lan Ling\u2019e knew the answer right away. She responded while looking down.She was still reluctant to part with him.Li Changshou captured a few spiritual fish from the lake, put them into his sleeves, and flew to the Heaven-Breaking Peak on the white cloud.Lan Ling\u2019e stood quietly at the side of the lake and watched her senior brother\u2019s back view. She muttered in her heart, \u2018Have a safe Tribulation Transcendence\u2019, and returned to her straw hut for cultivation after staying there for half a day.When he reached the Bai Fan Hall, Li Changshou found the elder that he was close with and told him that he wanted to visit the grave. Elder Wei, who was on duty that day, gladly allowed him to do so.\u201cChangshou, I remember that your family is in the north-east region of the South Continent. Coincidentally, an officer is going to the South Continent tomorrow for some matters. I\u2019ll let him take you along.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Li Changshou took out a few spiritual fish from his sleeve. \u201cElder, there is something I need to trouble you with.\u201d\u201cYou little brat.\u201d Elder Wei beamed with joy immediately and took the spiritual fish, which had been wrapped with a ball of water. He took a porcelain jar out and put the spiritual fish inside to raise them temporarily.\u201cSome people are good, some love to drink, and some love delicacies. It\u2019s very hard to nurture them like this, and they can be said to be delicious snakeheads.\u201d Elder Wei said with a smile, \u201cTell me. What are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cI want to seize this chance to put myself to the test for a few years in the South Continent,\u201d Li Changshou said in a low voice. \u201cCan you tell the officers not to go to my hometown to take a look and not to let them bring me there\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. You may leave.\u201d Elder Wei picked up the bamboo slip in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll be saving a piece of bamboo. You\u2019re a good seedling for immortal cultivation, and you have an endless future from today onward. Remember, you cannot create trouble, go against the sect\u2019s rules, or be reluctant to part with the flourishing mortal world and let the mortal world blind your Dao heart.\u201dLi Changshou responded repeatedly and said with cupped fists, \u201cThank you, Elder!\u201d\u201cThis is just a trivial matter. Be on your way. Go early and come back early.\u201dElder Wei gestured with his hand and took out a jade token, which was used for a disciple to go out, before handing it to Li Changshou. He told Li Changshou a few things, telling him not to go everywhere in places with many people in the mortal world, lest the turbid Qi in the mortal world affected his Dao base.This elder was not pretending to be deeply concerned about Li Changshou. After all, Li Changshou had given his over 100 spiritual fish all these years\u2026The disciples would often make an excuse of going back to their hometown and visiting the grave, but they would remain in the mortal world for several years and be caught by the sectarian officers. They would be reprimanded and have their monthly allowance deducted. Elder Wei did not find such things a surprise anymore.Li Changshou had given a few spiritual fish so that this elder would not record him visiting his parents\u2019 gravein the book. Naturally, the sectarian officers would not check it.In Elder Wei\u2019s opinion, it was not a huge matter unless the young disciples wanted to enjoy the mortal world.However, this was very crucial in Li Changshou\u2019s Tribulation Transcendence plan, and it was a small step to make it a success.\u2026After leaving the Heaven-Breaking Peak and flying southwards on the white cloud, Li Changshou very soon flew outside the mountains.He took the jade token and said that he needed to return to his hometown to visit the grave. The immortal, who was in charge of guarding the gates, told Li Changshou to be careful outside the sect. Li Changshou thanked him and flew out on the white cloud.500 kilometers around the sect was actually still considered the land of the Immortal Du Sect.The spirit meridian ores, which were important in a few areas of the sect, were distributed in the southern area.Li Changshou flew 1,000 kilometers on the white cloud and landed in a forest. After he observed in the hidden corners of the forest for two days and confirmed that nobody from the sect had followed him, he then executed the Earth Escape technique and went southwards.On the way, he executed the Earth Escape when he met mountains, and the Water Escape when he met water.He also encountered cultivators fighting, ran into mountain demons having an internal fight, bumped into people seeking pleasure, and witnessed thousands of mortals having hand-to-hand battles.After he took a look around, he stopped in his tracks.Just like an unnoticeable ghost, Li Changshou walked 5,000 kilometers and another 5,000 kilometers\u2026Half a month later, he reached a grassland in the northwest district of the South Continent, which was not far from the East Continent.Based on the sect\u2019s information, Li Changshou successfully found his parent\u2019s graveon a hillside.This grave was very exquisite. At one glance, he knew that a lot of money had been spent on it. The corner of the gravestone also had the symbol of the Immortal Du Sect, and an inscription was also written with \u2018Eldest Son Changshou\u2019.There were many weeds grown in front of the grave. Li Changshou took out a short knife and carefully cleared the surrounding of the grave.Then, he knelt before the gravestone and offered fruits, meat, and fish that he had prepared on the way. He burned two stacks of joss paper, put three fragrant joss sticks, and kowtowed four times. He felt less restraint now.Afterward, he found an ordinary corner near his parents\u2019 grave and meditated and cultivated there. This was also considered visiting the grave.Seven days later, Li Changshou was once again prepared to set off on his journey and hurried to the preselected place for his Tribulation Transcendence.Where was the place?It was actually in the East Ocean. However, it was in the East Ocean of the South Continent.Since it was a territory in the mortal world, few cultivators appeared there. The mortal world was filled with turbid Qi and disorder, and only a few demons were causing trouble.Most of the human race was gathered in the mortal world of the South Continent. The Dragon Palace did not have any stationed troops there, as they were afraid of bumping into the human race.At the mortal world\u2019s border, he found a hidden, ordinary island on the vast ocean. It was the best place for Tribulation Transcendence!Li Changshou took out a storage sack from his sleeve and took out something from it. It was a bunch of eyebrow pencils, face powder, and makeup materials that he had ground and invented.Then, he started to carefully disguise himself for the first time.He had a few foundational principles when it came to figures and looks. It was not enough if he only simply used the illusion technique or the Illusion Spell.He had to first use the makeup skills and physics to change his appearance. After that, he pasted a unique Ultra-Thin Hydrating Silk Mask and used the illusion technique to transform into an old Daoist priest before he executed the Illusion Spell.This way, even if an expert saw through four layers of his spell, they could not see his true appearance.Most of the cultivators who roamed outside would use the illusion technique, so it was not strange for him to use it.After tidying up for half a day, Li Changshou turned in an old, cold-faced Daoist priest before he quietly used his Earth Escape and went to the East Ocean to search for a place for seclusion and Tribulation Transcendence.At the same time\u2026At the common border of the South Ocean and East Ocean, an immortal glow was seen, which was similar to the immortal island of big turtles.In a treasured pond in the corner of the immortal island, the Island Pet that had recently arrived, which was a small azure dragon that was 100 feet long, was slowly observing the surroundings with eyes that had just peeked out of the water!The dragon spat out bubbles from its mouth with its eyes smiling.\u2018Very good.\u2019It was time for the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal to talk about the Dao again. The nearby cultivating immortals had gone to listen to the Dao.\u2018I\u2019m afraid you guys did not expect that when the prince was six years old, he had memorized the Four Seas\u2019 water routes by heart.\u2018Since then, he has headed to the South Continent and headed towards the East Continent along the coast of the South Continent to hide his tracks through the turbid Qi. Then, he reached the common border of the South and East Continents and hid his tracks as he headed to the East Continent.\u2018If the Immortal Du Sect did not have the guts to take in disciples, I can also go to the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools in the Middle Continent!\u2019The azure dragon laughed coldly and shrunk its body. Soon, it turned three feet long and swam toward the water seam at the bottom of the water.When it left the scope of the immortal island and was at the end of the island, a pair of big, terrifying turtle eyes opened in the area that resembled a golden turtlehead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How come there are so many tyrannical immortal senses searching nearby all of a sudden?\u2019On the continuous coastline of the Coast of the East Ocean and the eastern area of the South Continent\u2026In the fishing village with dozens of simple stone houses, Li Changshou turned into a cold-looking old Daoist priest, who was holding onto a cup of hot water served by a few old women. He surveyed the surface of the ocean while drinking it.He had just given out some talismans in the village and received a passionate wave of appreciation from the villagers. He also used this to conceal himself so that his movements at the East Ocean\u2019s side would become more reasonable.Many human itinerant cultivators would use such a method to earn more luck and merit for themselves.However, Li Changshou had understood one reason very early on\u2014helping the good begot good karma, and helping the bad begot bad karma.He could not be sure whether the talismans he had given out helped the good people or the bad people. Therefore, the most suitable method was to give out some Sleeping Aid Talismans, which had been drawn wrongly and did not have any effects, for free. This way, he would not get karma.On the surface of the ocean in the distance, an azure dragon\u2019s figure quietly passed by and very soon disappeared into the clouds.\u2018It\u2019s indeed the dragon race. They seem to be searching for something.\u2019Presently, it was not suitable for him to go out of the ocean, lest he met these people from the dragon race.Thus, Li Changshou went through the hardships of living in the wilderness. He walked along the side of the ocean and walked from north to south to see life in the mortal world so that he could obtain some enlightenment from it.Half a month later, Li Changshou walked more than 500 kilometers southwards. He could finally be sure that those experts from the dragon race had left the ocean region, which they had repeatedly checked.After carefully thinking, Li Changshou still decided not to change his original plan to go through Tribulation Transcendence on this ocean region.Two months later, he finally decided to completely settle down in this place of dozens of kilometers in radius.He secretly executed his illusion techniques one night and transformed into a fish, which was neither big nor small, and entered the somewhat warm ocean waters.He executed the Water Escape and went towards the few islands that he had previously seen on the fishermen\u2019s nautical chart.The place for Tribulation Transcendence could not be too far from the mortal world.The human race\u2019s mortal world was an emergency refuge for him. If he met any sneak attacks before or after the Tribulation Transcendence, he could hide in the vast ocean.The place for Tribulation Transcendence could not be too near to the mortal world either.The mortal world was filled with turbid Qi and disorder, so the cultivators\u2019 Dao Body and Primordial Soul were easily contaminated. If he could go through Tribulation Transcendence successfully, he would absorb the world\u2019s spiritual energy when he ascended to an immortal.Although it was not a big deal absorbing the turbid Qi in the mortal world, it was still somewhat unpleasant.His master\u2019s Tribulation Transcendence had not been perfect, so he had absorbed the spiritual energy for a very short time.Two months ago, what had the dragon race been searching for?Li Changshou was somewhat curious at this point.Who or what treasure could have attracted the other party to dispatch a great number of forces to search at the East Ocean border?Even though he could not see the figures of the experts from the dragon race, their aura was not hidden, and he could sense them from a distance.Nevermind. This was none of his business.Li Changshou would secretly go through the Heavenly Tribulation and then find a place to cultivate for three years to stabilize his Dao, conceal his aura, and improve on this Turtle Breathing Mantra. After that, he would return to the sect and continue to lead a stable life of a younger generation disciple of the Immortal Du Sect.He was now almost unable to suppress his cultivation realm, and he could reach the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital at any time.In the ocean water, Li Changshou slowly touched the islands of several hectares nearby and carefully observed them, but could not find a place that satisfied him.It was not that these small islands were not enough for him to conceal himself. Their structure was a little complicated, and there were too many hiding places, which made it easy for people to explore deeply.This was not a good place for seclusion and Tribulation Transcendence.Li Changshou thought about it and continued searching south because the dragon experts had moved from south to north two to three months ago.He would swim faster and search for it more slowly. He calmed down and searched for a place of his own destiny.In the middle of the night, Li Changshou\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up, and his spiritual senses found a pretty good island.The island was generally circular, and in fact, a few hills protruded out of the sea. His spiritual senses scanned the place, and the structure of the place was clear at a glance. It would not attract anyone to examine it in detail.After transforming into a fish and approaching this island, Li Changshou was increasingly pleased. He executed the Water Escape technique and hovered around the island for more than ten weeks from afar before deciding to approach and investigate.There were still over 5 kilometers to go\u2026Eh? There seemed to be something amiss with the ocean current.Li Changshou saw a small vortex in the ocean water and used his spiritual senses to inspect it inch by inch. Soon, he discovered that there was a very hidden rock cave underwater.The cave was very narrow, with an overall structure sloping upward that connected to a small waterhole somewhere on the island.\u2018Not bad. This is a good place. There is even a natural emergency exit!\u2019The more Li Changshou looked at it, the more satisfied he was.He had decided. It would be this place!\u2026\u2018You want to capture me back? Dream on!\u2019Ao Yi transformed into a human form. His body was stuck to the cold, hard rock wall, and he was carefully probing the situation 1.5 kilometers around the island while secretly circulating the mystic technique from the dragon race: Subterranean Dragon Mantra.He knew that he could not probe too far with his spiritual senses. Otherwise, he would easily be exposed.However, because of this, he could not determine if his people were still staying here.It was fine. He had the patience to continue to wait even if he had already been hiding in this place for three months.For the pursuit of being born as a dragon.For the bloodline circulating in him.For the responsibility as a prince of the dragon race!As long as he climbed ashore and left the Dragon Palace\u2019s scope of power, the situation would be much more favorable to him.Ao Yi was also somewhat helpless, as he hadn\u2019t expected that it wasn\u2019t those immortals on the island who were searching for him.That Black Cloud Immortal had directly informed the Dragon Palace, which sent a large number of experts to intercept him from the north to the south!On that day, if Ao Yi hadn\u2019t reacted in time and had been advancing stealthily through the water, he would have almost collided head-on with the people from his race!He was considered pretty lucky. He quickly found this circular island while diving under the sea and followed the topography before discovering this hidden rock crevice.Unexpectedly, he had really escaped the search by the experts of his race.\u2018Hmph, this is such a perfect hiding place that only I can find!\u2019When Ao Yi thought of this, he felt proud of himself.Suddenly, Ao Yi sensed danger approaching.It wasn\u2019t that he had detected something, but that his bloodline came with the ability to predict crises.\u2018Am I going to get discovered?\u2019Ao Yi got anxious. He didn\u2019t dare to move and stayed close to the rock wall while his Subterranean Dragon Mantra circulated wildly.At the moment, he only hated the ancestors of the dragon race for being too proud and not studying a brilliant method of transforming and hiding!Suddenly, an old Daoist priest showed up just outside the rock cave, burrowing into the rock crevice and approaching his place.Ao Yi was relieved. He frowned and focused. He made a decision in his heart and quietly prepared his strongest attack.This old Daoist priest\u2019s aura wasn\u2019t strong, and he hadn\u2019t discovered that he had executed the Subterranean Dragon Mantra, so Ao Yi could ambush him with one hand. If he went any further, he would be dead for sure!\u2018A immortal\u2019s kindness is bullied by an immortal; a dragon\u2019s kindness is ridden by an immortal!\u2019That was what a teacher had taught him during egg education!That old Daoist priest quickly approached\u2026100 feet\u202680 feet\u202650 feet\u2026He was here!Ao Yi\u2019s eyes narrowed. When the old Daoist priest was no more than 30 feet away from him, he stayed close to the rock wall and violently attacked while his figure stormed with a blue light!An azure dragon head emerged from the cold ocean water and narrow crevices of the ocean suddenly and opened its big crocodile-like mouth to swallow the cold-faced old Daoist priest, Li Changshou!That was his natural supernatural power: Devouring everything!Li Changshou was clearly stunned\u2026However, his reaction was also incomparably swift. He subconsciously dodged towards the side, and his left hand quickly buckled the two porcelain bottles.In a flash, the dragon head flickered with dazzling blue light in the ocean water, and the dragon\u2019s mouth directly bit off Li Changshou\u2019s left arm before swallowing it in one gulp!Li Changshou muffled a snort and retreated sharply while his right hand quickly performed spells!The cold-faced old Daoist priest had dodged Ao Yi\u2019s fierce attack, so Li Changshou\u2019s quick reflexes surprised Ao Yi.He immediately chased downward but had not expected the other party to execute a Water Escape Spell. His body whooshed out of the rock cave!Ao Yi could not let him escape like that!Ao Yi felt very anxious, and he immediately chased after him, but he suddenly felt dizzy\u2026What had he swallowed just now?Ao Yi quickly checked, but he saw an extra tiny \u2018white paper\u2019 arm in his stomach, two porcelain bottles that were going to be melted away by his mystical abilities, and two clumps of medicine that had quietly dissolved\u2026In a split second, his head was heavy, his tail was light, and he felt drowsy!An incapacitating agent?What a powerful incapacitating agent!Ao Yi understood that someone had schemed him. The bloodline power within his dragon body erupted, and his forehead flashed with blue light.In such a dangerous situation, Ao Yi would surely die if he fell unconscious. He could only kill the old Daoist priest with a broken arm before these two medicinal powers took complete effect!Charge!Crash\u2026The ocean water opened up ahead, and the azure dragon broke through the rock crevice.In order to fight against the spread of the medicinal effects, Ao Yi instantly bulged his body. However, in that instant, he saw the cold-faced old Daoist priest standing quietly in the dark waters ahead\u2026He opened his dragon mouth and lunged forward!Mysterious prismatic ice appeared in the surrounding ocean water with flames burning within it. It was being shot at the old Daoist priest at the same time!\u2018His arm is fine? That\u2019s not right. This is not the same person!\u2019Ao Yi\u2019s increasingly huge dragon head sank. His dizziness became even more intense, and his thinking became very sluggish, which made him anxious in his heart.At the same time, Ao Yi also felt similar medicinal effects gathering from the ocean water in all directions, drilling into all parts of his body and directly eroding his dragon soul!Several identical figures suddenly emerged behind that old Daoist priest, with each of them holding an opened porcelain bottle in their hands!They used the Water Escape at the same time, and their six figures scattered in the ocean, easily dodging Ao Yi\u2019s dragon body that was rushing in by inertia.Six bottles of Soft Immortal Disperser at the front and back, and one bottle of transcendent-grade Soft Immortal Disperser\u2026Ao Yi had stabilized his figure in the ocean waters, and his dragon eyes were turbid. His 100-feet-long dragon body was swaying but was immediately about to rush to the surface\u2026As if they could read Ao Yi\u2019s thoughts, the six figures reunited above again.The twelve robe sleeves of these paper doll clones drummed in the ocean water, and the storage sack that they carried within them opened, causing talismans to quickly fly out and weave a huge net in the ocean water!108 talismans were like 108 small array bases, on which Dharma powers circulated. The water-element aura in the ocean water was being induced rapidly.Talismanic Array\u00b7Water-Element Earth-Shaking Seal!In the blink of an eye, a 1,000-feet diameter four-directional seal condensed and smashed down on the head of the azure dragon approaching from below!The radiance around the huge seal shone with the force of a landslide, for it was condensed by spiritual energy. It directly ignored the resistance of the ocean.The azure dragon below roared with his head held high. Its pale mane exploded, and its dragon claws stuck straight. With an indomitable momentum, it charged straight at the huge seal!At this point, Ao Yi had no more energy to think, as the intense dizziness made it impossible for him to continue judging. He had a strong intent to fight, and his dragon heart refused to give in!\u2018I, Ao Yi, am the Second Prince of the East Ocean Dragon Palace!\u2019\u201cAng\u2026\u201dThe azure dragon roared, and the huge seal landed on him!Visible shock waves burst through the ocean!Tremendous waves surged under 5 kilometers within the ocean, and the side islands were constantly shaking!At another glance!The huge seal shattered, and the azure dragon was actually unscathed!However, the big eyes of the dragon\u2019s head slowly closed, and the huge body seemed to have lost all its strength. It fell 1,000 feet towards the bottom of the ocean\u2026\u2018Are all the dragons, which have yet to become immortals, so resistant? It seems that the formula of the Soft Immortal Disperser needs some improvements.\u2019In the rocky crevice of the ocean floor that was 3,000 feet away, Li Changshou frowned for a while, and his spiritual senses monitored the surrounding 15 kilometers of land.Fighting in the water was naturally different from fighting on the land. It had forced him to use some \u2018tactics\u2019 of his Dharma powers.It was time to validate the effects of the True Samadhi Flames.The talismanic array just now had been powerful.Li Changshou\u2019s eyes narrowed as he casually took six compact silver flying swords from his sleeve and threw them at the paper doll clones.These six flying swords brought out rays of white light. In the blink of an eye, they turned into three-feet-long swords that were steadily caught by the six paper doll clones.Li Changshou spread his left hand, and the six paper doll clones danced with their swords. Their bodies intertwined, and they set up a hexagram sword array formation.As he pressed with his left hand, the six paper dolls had their heads faced head down and feet up. They circulated the sword array formation towards the azure dragon below, strangling it. Above the six immortal swords, streams of True Samadhi Flames simultaneously ignited.As if there was nothing in the surrounding ocean water, the power of the True Samadhi Flames was not affected at all!All of a sudden, Li Changshou felt helpless for a while, and the six immortal swords that were about to pierce the azure dragon\u2019s skin stopped.This was not because Li Changshou\u2019s benevolent heart felt moved.This dragon had attacked viciously just now and wanted to kill him. It was reasonable for him to kill it as a counterattack.He would end the karma on the spot, retreat, and go to the South Ocean for Tribulation Transcendence and successfully return to the mountains\u2026 This was the plan that Li Changshou had made the moment he was attacked by the dragon.However, a shimmering purple triangular scale appeared behind the azure dragon. The mystic techniques of the talismanic pattern engraved on it was something Li Changshou had seen in ancient books.If he killed this dragon, his Primordial Spirit would immediately be locked by the mystic techniques of the dragon race, and he would be hunted down by the dragon race endlessly.According to the rules of the dragon race, if he saw this purple scale flashing and stopped, not only would the person who had made the move not be hunted down and killed, but he would also receive a thank-you gift from the Dragon Palace\u2026The information recorded in that ancient book had been released by the Dragon Palace itself, which was equivalent to giving its own important young dragon another way out. It had been verified several times since ancient times and was not fake.Who was this young dragon? He definitely had a noble status.He was the target that the dragon experts were searching for with a probability of 80%.Li Changshou shook his head as the six paper doll clones swiftly returned and began searching various places for traces they might have left.However, just as Li Changshou packed up from the battlefield and was about to leave, he looked again at the Second Prince of the East Ocean Dragon Palace, who had somehow transformed into a human form and was sleeping heavily below.It was actually him?Why was he there?Those dragon experts were searching from south to north\u2026Li Changshou then recalled that this little dragon had deliberately lost to himself previously\u2026Could it be that his deduction that day had been correct, and this second prince was indeed trying to go against and humiliate the dragon race during the Demon-Sweeping Meet? But he ended up \u2018winning\u2019 and his scheme failed?After that, could it be that he had used another excuse to become a disciple of the Saints and continued to provoke the dragon race?In the end, this fellow had been sent to the land of the Jie School to become a disciple\u2026 and escaped to this place?This really could be a drama series!If Ao Yi had escaped from the south and appeared here, looking at this guy\u2019s course of action, he obviously wanted to go to the Middle Continent or the East Continent. It was even possible that his goal was to escape to the Immortal Du Sect\u2026Li Changshou\u2019s eyes narrowed.If this little thing really reached the Immortal Du Sect, the sect would most likely first stabilize this dragon and then find the Dragon Palace to inquire about the matter. It might end up making quite a mess.Forget it. After all, the Immortal Du Sect was his sect. This little dragon had the mystic techniques of the dragon race to protect himself and couldn\u2019t be killed directly\u2026This was truly troublesome.This time, he was on the losing end. He had used so many incapacitating agents and could not even collect the dragon\u2019s blood.Li Changshou released a few more paper dolls and took out the Beauty\u2019s Charm Concentrate that he had concocted for his martial aunt in advance.A moment later, a bamboo raft was floating gently on the ocean surface.Ao Yi, who reeked of alcohol, lay on the bamboo raft while his body shone with a faint purple light.Ao Yi\u2019s mouth smiled serenely, while he was holding a \u2018wine pot\u2019 made of seashells in his hand and drifted to the deep northern ocean on the ocean current.Having drunk more than twenty bottles of the Beauty\u2019s Charm Concentrate, he was expected to sleep for tens of days.Ao Yi\u2019s entire body had been thoroughly washed dozens of times, and no more half of his aura outside of himself remained\u2026Even that little bit of paper that had been swallowed by Ao Yi that couldn\u2019t be digested by the dragon stomach was also removed by Li Changshou using the paper dolls.As for the Dragon Palace\u2019s thank-you gift, Li Changshou was not the least bit interested and had already disappeared towards the south.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Primordial World was indeed very frightening\u2026Amid the constant \u2018ding-ding\u2019 sound, Ao Yi sat at the bedside of the 100-feet-long extravagant bed. Both his hands were trembling, and the warm, nourishing tea in his hands continuously spilled outwards. The actual amount of tea he drank was minimal.He was trembling\u2014his whole body was trembling.The reason he was trembling was not that he was afraid of his mother, a Turtle Immortal, and a few uncles from the dragon race, who sat before him. He was similarly not concerned about his punishment.Although he had just hatched from the dragon egg around 11 to 12 years ago, he believed that his mind was quite strong.Before he had been sent to the North Ocean Golden Turtle Island to find the Jie School, he had suffered the torture of being pierced by an ice pillar for three months. Even then, he had not conceded defeat.Now, however, the trembling occurred naturally and was not something he could control.Ao Yi sensed that there was completely no strength in his body, and he developed a phobia. This phobia\u2026 was the reason he was trembling!This phobia came in the shape of a face belonging to an expressionless old human Daoist priest.\u2018How could the human race be so cunning?\u2019Ao Yi trembled even more vigorously when he recalled that hasty battle.His mother hastily urged a few old dragons to check on him. Yet, the only conclusion they gave was\u2014alcohol overconsumption.Ao Yi\u2019s developing Adam apple quivered, and he gulped down one mouthful of the nourishing tea made from dozens of valuable spirit herbs. Suddenly, he spat that mouthful out and hacked violently.A few maidservants rushed over, but Ao Yi howled abruptly, his eyes filled with terror.\u201cDon\u2019t come closer! What are you guys trying to do?\u201dThe beautiful, dainty maidservants hastily bowed and begged for forgiveness before quickly retreating.Breathing heavily, Ao Yi rested his forehead on his palm as the trembles in his body slowly ceased. \u201cLeave me alone. Don\u2019t come any closer\u2026\u201d\u201cMy son.\u201d His elegant and gracious mother shouted in concern, \u201cWhat is going on with you?\u201dAo Yi slowly placed the empty white-jade-glazed cup beside him. His hand trembled, accidentally smashing the expensive cup onto the jade-stone floor.He clutched his forehead with both hands and attempted to unravel the phobia he had.The way to combat fear was to face it directly!\u2018Incapacitating agent\u2026 A powerful incapacitating agent\u2026\u2019Ao Yi recalled the four-directional seal coming down on his head, making him feel dizzy, and then he completely lost consciousness\u2026However, his body and bloodline retained many memories and sensations.When he was unconscious, he was like a dried fish with its innards removed, all parts of his body inside and out being repeatedly washed with seawater\u2026Then, he was being coated with a layer of soap powder before being washed thoroughly again\u2026During this process, seven to eight palms slapped him continuously, and numerous techniques landed on him. It was a process that was exceedingly similar to when a master chef of the Dragon Palace was slapping the meat of the supreme-grade Snowflake Horned Divine Cow to make the meat quality become even more perfect\u2026When he was unconscious, Ao Yi had the feeling that he was about to be eaten by the demon-like human!Additionally, every piece of flesh on him was being pan-fried, sliced thinly, deep-fried, and stewed\u2014using all sorts of methods to cook, so that the flavor of the dragon meat would flourish!This food preparation segment was repeated several dozen times and more!Several dozen times!That old Daoist priest was not a human, but a terrifying dragon-eating ferocious beast!No, that was the true side of the human race!Over the two weeks he was in a coma, Ao Yi repeatedly recalled that experience. When he woke up and saw his mother, he thought that he was still dreaming, and what he had experienced was merely a nightmare he made before he hatched from the dragon egg\u2026However, this was not a nightmare.\u2018Was this how the human race battled with the dragon race?\u2018Could this be the reason why the dragon race does not dare to openly engage in a war with the human race?\u2018There\u2019s no way the dragon race could win, no way.\u2019The aura of the old Daoist priest was clearly not strong and should be weaker than Ao Yi. Yet the priest could do this to him\u2026To him?Then, he heard two uncles murmuring beside him, \u201cThe protection dragon scale was activated. That evil-doer did not kill Nephew Ao Yi but forced him to drink lots of alcohol. Why didn\u2019t that person come to the Dragon Palace to receive a token of gratitude?\u201d\u201cPerhaps they were afraid that we would go back on our promise. Sigh, but according to the rules, we need to thank them.\u201d\u2018Wha\u2026 what? The Dragon Palace needs to thank that dragon-eating ferocious human?\u2019Ao Yi stood up unsteadily. Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly saw the image of that old Daoist priest pressing him down onto the seabed, forcing him to be repeatedly washed and cleansed by the ocean water\u2026Yet, the dragon race, his own family, wanted to express their gratitude to that demonic human?Was this part of the plan of that old human Daoist priest as well?Any human cultivator could easily deal with him, a dragon with the Dragon King\u2019s bloodline flowing in his veins?Ao Yi\u2019s legs weakened. He sat back on the edge of the bed and took a deep breath.\u2018The Primordial World is truly\u2026 frightening.\u2019\u2026At the same time, at the South Ocean, on a coral island near the South Continent.The expressionless old Daoist priest Li Changshou had transformed into was currently sitting on an indent at the reef. His aura was slightly fluctuating as spiritual energy rose from the ocean water and gathered near him.His breathing was natural, while the Heaven and Earth were clear and bright, making one forget themselves.Occasionally, a blue light flickered on Li Changshou\u2019s forehead. A few nine-petal lotus flowers floated beside, circling around him.The blue light was experiencing its first bloom. Nature sounds and ocean waves emitted from Li Changshou\u2019s body, merging with the sound of the ocean water washing up the small island.Suddenly, thunder rumbled. Blue light radiated from his body, head to toe, countless nine-petal lotus flowers bloomed, and he started to give off a light fragrance.The sea creatures within a one-kilometer radius were attracted by the fragrance and swam over. The lotus flowers flew towards some living organisms that possessed intelligence.However, Li Changshou opened his eyes without warning, his eyes filled with blue light. The lotus flowers started to crumble. The sea organisms also sensed danger, and they instantly turned tails and escaped afar\u2026Humanizing living organisms was considered a benevolent act. One could receive merits as a reward from the Heavenly Dao.On the other hand, if these organisms transformed into demons and wreaked havoc on the human race, one would have to suffer from negative karma. The merits received might not even be enough to offset the negative karma\u2026The breakthrough was a success.Li Changshou breathed in deeply and repeatedly inspected his insides. Even if one was nitpicking, his Dao base was still considered very sturdy.Was it time for him to face his Immortal Ascension Tribulation?Li Changshou looked up at the sky, which was cloudless and blue. It seemed that he was still lacking, for this situation differed from the scenario he imagined where he needed to face off a Heavenly Tribulation upon attaining the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital.After all, he always prepared himself for the worst-case scenarios.Closing his eyes and focusing, Li Changshou continued to meditate and cultivate. The Qi-Gathering Minor Array created using Spirit Stones gave out regular bursts of spiritual energy that was all absorbed by him.At various locations in the one-kilometer radius, a few paper dolls hid at the sea bed to survey the area, ready to attract any people trying to sneak an attack on him.There were not many apparatuses set up on the reef, for they would all be destroyed when the Heavenly Tribulation struck.Hence, he had set up various arrays at a place further away, all being used for escaping and not for defense.Those arrays would allow him to swiftly teleport away after completing the Heavenly Tribulation.This place was the ideal place he had found to complete the Tribulation Transcendence. There were no cultivators around in the 100-kilometer radius. Even if some cultivators happened to fly by, they would be at least 10 kilometers away.This situation had something to do with how the major mortal cities on land were distributed.After meditating and cultivating for two weeks, Li Changshou suddenly felt uneasy. A strange abstruse Dao rune appeared beside him.The Heavenly Tribulation was about to arrive.Grandmaster Heavenly Dao was very \u2018magnanimous\u2019 to appear long after he attained the Ninth Stage of Dao Requital, two weeks after he stabilized his cultivation realm, and right after he solidified his Dao base.Li Changshou transformed into a fish and utilized the Water Escape\u2019s benefits to circle around and check the 10-kilometer radius, before swimming back to the reef.\u2018Come!\u2019 He was prepared.This feeling was actually quite mysterious.It felt as though he was about to face the biggest test of his entire life the sleepless night before the day of the test after studying for 12 long bitter years\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient. Stay calm and focus.\u201dLi Changshou silently chanted the Mind Calming-and-Clearing Chant, occasionally taking out the Inaction Sutra, which he held in his hands to closely gain insight from.The more insights he had, the more ready he would be, and the greater the chance of him surviving the Heavenly Tribulation.Three days passed, and the premonition that the Heavenly Tribulation was about to arrive grew stronger.The Mind Clearing Chant lost its effectiveness, and he could no longer calm his mind to gain further insights. The air within a 300-meters radius became oppressed, making the other living organisms to subconsciously avoid the area.His master\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation that arrived last time was bashful and slow to come. Thus, Li Changshou wondered if his Heavenly Tribulation would be gentle, wild, or ferocious.Li Changshou guessed that his Heavenly Tribulation would have seven or eight Heavenly Lightnings.Therefore, he relaxed and did not force himself to calm down. Rather, he attempted to thoroughly experience the uneasiness and anxiety he was feeling.This was a reaction all living organisms would feel when sensing Heaven\u2019s power\u2014it had nothing to do with how high or low one\u2019s Dao Realm was.The Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation was also known as the Dao Completion Tribulation. Since a long time ago, Li Changshou had been contemplating why it involved \u2018Dao Completion\u2019.Today, he obtained his answer.Qi Refinement, Soul Formation, Void Return, and Dao Requital were all part of the process in the learning and imitation of nature for cultivators. Through this process, they could realize their Dao, which would become the foundation of their path to becoming immortals.The Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation was the test implemented by the Heavenly Dao to the cultivators\u2019 Dao. It was to see if their Dao was qualified to become immortal.At the same time, the Heavenly Tribulation was a tribulation to help cultivators leave their mortality so that they could attain greater heights using their own Dao.Born as humans, ascended to become immortals.The terms \u2018Dao\u2019 and \u2018Dao Realm\u2019 should not be lumped together. Li Changshou felt that one should not give their own Dao a name of its own.It was just like how human nature could be sturdy, anxious, bashful, or panicky.The Dao was natural.\u201cI am natural.\u201dLi Changshou closed his eyes and smiled. There was a sudden gust of wind that whirled towards the sky.Thunder rumbled and the wind and clouds transformed suddenly. Several thousand feet above in the sky, gray Tribulation Clouds swarmed over, covering the nearby area of around a one-kilometer radius.Sometimes mountain ranges seemed to appear above the clouds. Other times they looked like pagodas, an army troop, or a cluster of drums and gongs.Many strange images appeared by the Tribulation Cloud. Below the Tribulation Cloud, however, the air started to churn. From afar, it looked as though a waterspout was forming.Halfway through the formation of this waterspout, lightning flashed within, and thunder rumbled!Li Changshou slowly stood up from the reef and patted his clothes. He pointed the air casually, and 12 Faraday Cages surrounded him. Various pills hidden in his sleeves were ready for consumption.His Dao Body shone with blue light. His essence soul had completed its condensation.After breathing out a mouthful of impure gas, Li Changshou looked up, and then he respectfully did a Dao salute, choosing to do the most proper ancient salute.Then he announced, \u201cDao Sect\u2019s disciple wishes to inform the Heaven today: I sincerely accept the Dao Completion Tribulation that the Heaven is about to gift me. I wish to establish my own Dao and become a worry-free immortal.\u201cShould the Heavenly Tribulation come and I cannot withstand it, resulting in my death, it is because my Dao is not qualified to share its lifespan with the Heaven and Earth. I will have no grievances if this occurs.\u201cThe Heavenly Dao is righteous.\u201cThank you, Heavenly Dao, for the concern and gifting me the Immortal Ascension opportunity!\u201dBoom\u2014The Tribulation Cloud seemed to reply and not have heard him at the same time, for the strength of the Heavenly Tribulation remained the same.A number of large lightning spots flickered within the Tribulation Cloud vortex. Some electric arcs appeared around Li Changshou.Slowly, he levitated from the ground. The 12 Faraday Cages split up equidistant on the ocean surface, in preparation for later.When he flew to 90 feet above the ground, three silvery-white lightning spots flared, and silver electric snakes burst forth!These thunder and lightning spots gathered and formed numerous thunders the size of a bowl, striking at Li Changshou. He did not sense any danger, but he still activated his Dharma powers and spread them over his body.His Dao Body emitted faint light before the lightning completely engulfed him!\u2018The power of the first lightning bolt is equivalent to the third thunder of Master\u2019s Tribulation Transcendence?\u2019His Heavenly Tribulation should, indeed, not be underestimated.Li Changshou blocked all lightning that fell on him. He looked up at the sky and waited calmly.The aftereffects of being \u2018struck\u2019 by the lightning\u2026 were itchy and numbing. Some Immortal Qi was condensing in his body, and even his essence soul was submerged in the lightning.Unexpectedly, it was quite comfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Why was Master having such a hard time trying to survive his tribulation? Was it because he failed to thank the Heavenly Dao?\u2019Li Changshou was puzzled. He recalled the sensation of the second Heavenly Tribulation he experienced and analyzed the impact the power of the Heavenly Dao had on him.It should not be because he thanked the Heavenly Dao before the Tribulation Transcendence occurred. The Heavenly Dao was fair. He did that with the mentality of giving it a try, so that should not actually have any effects whatsoever.He felt that the earlier two bolts of lightning were quite comfortable because they could not cause him any real harm.This logic was actually quite easy to understand.For example, many types of customers. who visited a brothel to play, would be flirtatiously hit by a woman who shouted, \u201cAiya, why did you come only now?\u201dDue to her professional ethics, she would have placed the same amount of strength behind each hit. However, based upon the strength in their bodies, each customer would feel differently about that hit\u2026The situation was something like that.The third Lightning Tribulation was churning above Li Changshou, but he had gained many insights.The previous two Heavenly Lightnings seemed to have opened a door before him by just a crack, allowing him to take a peek of a mysterious yet profound world.\u2018This should be the result of the Great Dao, or the Heavenly Dao, coming into contact with my own Dao.\u2018Could this be the key to completing ascension?\u2019Boom!The ocean surface rippled as a result of the rumbling thunder\u2019s shockwaves.Amid the rumbling thunder, several lightning spots flickered. Another coarse bolt of lightning struck!After being struck by the bolt of lightning, Li Changshou, who was hovering mid-air, dropped by 30 feet before he managed to stabilize his body and block most of the lightning that struck him. Several bolts of lightning cracked and split above his head, striking everywhere on the ocean surface.Fortunately, the 12 Faraday Cages were some distance away, or else some might have been destroyed as a result.This time, he sustained some injuries because of the Heavenly Tribulation.Li Changshou stared at the handful of long hair he was holding. Thankfully, it was still the long white hair he had dyed for completing the disguise.His Heavenly Tribulation was not any different from that of the other cultivators.The Dao robe he was wearing became slightly charred.Before the Tribulation Transcendence arrived, he had removed all metal items he had on him. The charred area on his robe was caused by the explosion of a jade pearl accessory.Li Changshou\u2019s body was currently covered with small flashing electric arcs.Immortal aura gathered around his arms and shoulders. A fingernail-sized portion at the top of his head was starting to convert to an immortal body.He flew back up to 90 feet above the ground. As he called upon all his Dharma powers and the converted Immortal Qi in him, he waited for the fourth Heavenly Tribulation to arrive.Roars could be heard from the vortex above him, and the Tribulation Cloud was churning continuously.Various strange phenomena appeared at the Tribulation Cloud once more, as though there were several dozens of ferocious beasts confined within the cloud itself, which were trying to escape their bindings, charge below, and swallow Li Changshou whole.\u201cThings happen in threes; the Heavenly Tribulation is about to undergo a change.\u201dA simple, rusty carving knife appeared in Li Changshou\u2019s right hand. However, he hesitated slightly and put it away again, choosing to continue using his flesh body, Primordial Spirit, and Dharma powers to resist against the Heavenly Tribulation. This way, the Great Dao and his own Dao would continue to clash together.This was the feeling he was seeking!The door that had just been cracked open was pushed open half-way. He could already see the various beautiful sceneries in front of him, calling for him.His Primordial Spirit was engulfed in the lightning, entering a mysterious state. It even started to absorb the small electric arcs to promote the transformation of his body.These situations showed that Li Changshou would definitely be able to \u2018ascend\u2019 once he survived the Heavenly Tribulation.However, the probability of him ascending now was not big. It would all depend on the subsequent Lightning Tribulations to see if he would be able to obtain a greater opportunity.Sizzle\u2014Six large lightning spots arranged in a hexagonal shape appeared inside the vortex overhead. An indistinct face of a white tiger could be seen.In the very next moment, the white tiger roared. Lightning surged violently, condensing to form a lightning pillar that shot down.The fourth Heavenly Tribulation rained down!The abundant power of the Great Dao charged below, following the lead of the lightning. Li Changshou grunted as his hovering body was forced down several dozen feet once more.On a beach several hundred kilometers away, a group of fishermen looked over. Some of them started to prostrate themselves in that direction.A few immortals and cultivators would occasionally pass by in the 150-kilometer radius. They would also glance over and sense the violent power of the Heavenly Tribulation.\u201cWho would come to a place like this to undergo their Tribulation Transcendence?\u201d\u201cSuch frightening Tribulation Cloud, to be able to cover such a large area. Could that be the legendary Eight Lightnings?\u201dOne would naturally avoid the area where a Tribulation Transcendence was occurring to prevent themselves from suffering from accidental injuries.The lightning dispersed. Li Changshou flew back up again.\u2018The fourth Lightning Tribulation is not bad. It is powerful and accurate enough, enabling me to gain many insights without causing any injuries to my Primordial Spirit.\u2019This was quite a wonderful Lightning Tribulation. If the fifth and sixth bolts of lightning remained this way, it would be good.However, Li Changshou secretly felt disappointed.After calculating the intensity, the speed at which the Tribulation Cloud was being depleted, and the pattern he derived previously, his Heavenly Tribulation should be the Eight Lightnings Tribulation without a doubt.He had known that his advantage laid in his understanding capabilities, his provocative thinking, and his flexible learning methods. His own aptitude did not provide him with much of an advantage.The rule of the Heavenly Dao stated that the aptitude one had upon first starting to cultivate would determine the Heavenly Tribulation they would have to transcend.Indeed, his Heavenly Tribulation was impressive.Yet, when the Heavenly Tribulation arrived, he discovered that it was different from the \u2018Nine Extremities Lightning Tribulation\u2019 he had been worried about for the past 60 years.Therefore, he felt slightly disappointed.Nonetheless, there were also two sides to a coin for everything. Li Changshou should be able to successfully transcend the Eight Lightnings Heavenly Tribulation without any problem, and without revealing too many trump cards.More importantly, the clash between the Great Dao and his Dao would allow him to gain many benefits, expand his horizons, and obtain a large number of insights.\u2018Being able to become closer to attaining ascension is a good thing.\u2019Boom\u2014The fifth Lightning Tribulation landed. Li Changshou put in his all to resist it, the amount of immortal energy in his body increasing.Seven-colored light shone from his forehead. This was the sign that his body was starting to transform faster to become an immortal body!Then, the sixth\u2026The seventh\u2026When looking at this from a distance away, one could see the Tribulation Cloud churning. Numerous ancient ferocious beasts appeared above the cloud.Such as the Qiongqi, with its wings spread out in preparation for flight, the Qilin covered in a gray layer of flame, the Taotie, which had a huge mouth growing on its belly, and the Taowu, which was covered in long spikes.[1]There were 32 ferocious beasts in total, which took turns appearing on the Tribulation Cloud.A huge lightning pillar would appear each time these ferocious beasts clashed, attacking the person hovering mid-air below.Several kilometers away, an old Daoist priest was heading towards the South Ocean Immortal Island with his disciple to visit a good friend. He looked curiously at where Li Changshou was transcending the tribulation.The old Daoist priest squeezed his fingers together to make a prediction. With sparkling eyes, he blurted out, \u201cThat is\u2026 the legendary Heavenly Tribulation, ranked in the fourth place! The 32-Beasts 8-Extremes 8-Desolate Immortal Tribulation!\u201dThe intelligent young lady beside him complained, \u201cIs there something wrong, Master?\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201d The old Daoist priest shook his head and sighed before saying, \u201cA cultivating genius is about to meet their demise because of their Heavenly Tribulation. Han Zhi, let\u2019s go.\u201cThis kind of Heavenly Tribulation\u2026 is something impossible to survive!\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s not a good thing to possess exceptional aptitude!\u201cWith a superior-class immortal cultivation aptitude like yours, Han Zhi, you will also need to be extra meticulous when dealing with the Heavenly Tribulation you will be facing.\u201dAfter he said that, the old Daoist priest continued on his way with Han Zhi.This was the only immortal who was able to threaten Li Changshou\u2019s Tribulation Transcendence in this whole process.However, this immortal did not take a second glance and left with his disciple, along with the pity he felt for the cultivator about to die from the Tribulation Transcendence\u2026He left quietly, having passed by the area coincidentally.This was, in fact, an affirmation of the preparation work Li Changshou had done before his Tribulation Transcendence. All his efforts put into finding this place was not for naught.Back at where Li Changshou was, seven lightning pillars fell together. The sound of rumbling thunder echoed, and the living organisms in the nearby area, spanning for several kilometers, became uneasy.Only five minutes had passed since the Heavenly Tribulation started.The Tribulation Cloud above had shrunk to half its size, with the feral roaring of the ferocious beasts reverberating in the air. 32 lighting spots flashed continuously in the cloud, in preparation of the last Tribulation Lightning of this Heavenly Tribulation!Li Changshou, who was situated below the cloud, frowned and took a deep breath to suppress the tremor in his body caused by the clash between his Dharma powers and the immortal power.Just now, the seventh Dao lightning pillar was already 10 feet wide.This time, it should be bigger and stronger!Li Changshou\u2019s Dao robe was already ridden with a dozen holes. However, from his forehead to his neck, he was radiating with seven-colored immortal light spots.When his immortal base stabilized, this immortal light quickly disappeared.However\u2026\u2018My Heavenly Tribulation is unexpectedly\u2026 disappointing.\u2019This was exactly the way an exceptional Heavenly Tribulation should be, to provide the cultivators with sufficient benefits and a powerful tribulation experience. Thus, it would promote the sublimation of the cultivator, allowing them to become a true immortal.Li Changshou\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation, however, seemed to be quite weak in strength.This was far too gentle\u2014only his body from the neck up had become an immortal body.This was the result of Li Changshou only using his Dharma powers, flesh body, and Primordial Spirit to resist the Lightning Tribulation. He had yet to use the other methods he had prepared beforehand in this process.\u2018It\u2019s alright. There is still the eighth Heavenly Lighting.\u2019 Li Changshou consoled himself, but he was starting to have a foreboding feeling.Lightning spots flashed continuously above as lightning coagulated. The power of the Heavenly Tribulation churned viciously, as though it wanted to tear Li Changshou apart with this very last bolt of lightning.Various scenes appeared before Li Changshou\u2019s eyes.The various occasions he had frantically suppressed his cultivation realm, repeatedly accumulated his understanding, and treated every little breakthrough as a huge accomplishment in his life\u2026 All the hardships he had endured, all the years he had bitterly cultivated, all the fears he had faced and all the caution he had to practice\u2026His Dao Body was sturdy like a Dharma treasure, and his essence soul was complete and flawless.Finally, all his efforts, struggles, and risks he had accomplished would come to fruition today.The 32 lightning spots flared at the same time. Countless silver snakes and electric serpents danced madly in the sky, condensing into three huge horizontal lightning pillars in the vortex. In a bright flash, they ferociously dropped down toward Li Changshou!There was only a sea of lightning in the space between Heaven and the Earth.At the border of the mortal world, above the South Ocean, divine lightning purified the world!Li Changshou was finally moved. He raised both his hands to welcome the sublimation of his life!His heart was racing!It was all because he could already sense that his own Dao would find its place in this world from today onwards!Today marked the beginning of his immortal path, and tomorrow would bring the adventure of his lifetime!Crash\u2026The Lightning Tribulation engulfed Li Changshou completely. The corals below immediately melted, and electric sparks danced on the ocean surface!A short moment later, when lightning sparks started falling, angelic music could be heard. A small ganoderma-shaped celebratory cloud rose from the ocean surface and stuck itself to Li Changshou\u2019s feet.A ray of immortal light shone from the Tribulation Cloud, engulfing Li Changshou. He was beside himself.Immortal, ascended!Dao, completed!This was the path for immortals!This!Wait, something was not right!Li Changshou looked down, and his expression immediately turned to that of astonishment!Only his body from the head to his chest was transformed into an immortal body and emitted seven-colored immortal light. On the other hand, his hands, arms, and the rest of his body below his chest remained the same.He had gained some immortal energy in addition to his original Dao Body\u2026In other words, he was just like an incomplete statue, half of him made from supreme-grade rainbow jade while the other half from soil and dirt!His Primordial Spirit occasionally flowed with seven-colored immortal power, and occasionally\u2026 looked the same!As though it sensed that Li Changshou discovered that something was amiss, the angelic music from above ceased, and the congratulatory clouds dissipated. All strange phenomena disappeared as well.The Tribulation Cloud, which had turned white, was still in the process of dispersing\u2026Li Changshou quickly came back to his senses.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Such a situation was not recorded in the ancient books he had read!The Heavenly Tribulation was over, but its power was insufficient?Could it be that his foundation was far too solid, to the extent that the Eight Lightnings Heavenly Tribulation could not affect it, and thus his Dao Body could not be transformed into an immortal body?\u2018Sh*t\u2026\u2019What was he supposed to do now?Cut off his own limbs and let his upper body ascend?His lower body was very important, as well!Moreover, his Primordial Spirit was currently in a half-baked immortal nascent state. There was no way he could slaughter his own Primordial Spirit!Was it even possible to do that? This was not some form of sword technique that could be removed as one wished!Li Changshou lifted his head and looked at the Tribulation Cloud that had almost completely dispersed. His mind raced frantically, and he looked anxious.At that moment, he cared for nothing but to resolve this awkward situation immediately.He did not wish to become an incomplete immortal!The door toward the immortal realm was already open. He had successfully transcended the tribulation, but his Dao base was stuck!Lifting his hand, Li Changshou took two hasty steps forward and quickly hollered at the last bit of the Tribulation Cloud still remaining in the sky,\u201cHold on!\u201dThe huge Heavenly Tribulation Cloud paused before speeding up and dissipated.Li Changshou was rendered speechless.\u2018Ran\u2026 ran away?\u2019Before he could curse, he suddenly heard a low \u2018dong\u2019 sound, which made his essence soul and Dao Body tremble.An indescribable oppressive might from the Heaven locked onto him![1] Qiongqi, Taotie and Taowu are all famous ferocious beasts of the Chinese mythology.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe words \u2018hold on\u2019 determined life and death!This time, the judgment\u2019s subject seemed to be himself\u2026The moment Li Changshou shouted, and when he felt the oppression descending from the skies, a realization dawned on him.Li Changshou, along with the omniscient Grandmaster Heavenly Dao, might be responsible for his current predicament.Buzz, buzz, buzz\u2014Suddenly, ripples mysteriously appeared in the sky, accompanied by rumbling sounds.This alarming oppression covered a 50-kilometer radius, making the living organisms in the area to quiver and remain motionless in fear.Boom!Li Changshou looked up again. A 10-feet-wide gray cloud had unknowingly appeared in the sky.Two crevices suddenly and slowly split open in the gray cloud, as though two huge eyes were gradually opening. The entire gray cloud condensed to form the expressionless face of an old Daoist priest, his empty eyes staring down at Li Changshou.\u2018Heavenly Dao? Dao Ancestor?\u2019In that instant, Li Changshou felt that he was completely exposed, and he sensed a strong feeling of danger.His instincts were no longer probing him, but were hollering like a metal kettle filled with boiling water!Even the immortal light emitting from his upper body retreated forcibly into his body!What should he do?His current situation was one where the Heavenly Dao would certainly kill him if he was perceived to be an abnormality in the Primordial World!That was even if he did nothing, and if he was not involved in any karma!Li Changshou did not want to care so much anymore.Bearing down on the oppression, he yelled, \u201cI have no intention to challenge Heaven\u2019s authority! This is truly accidental! Grandmaster Heavenly Dao, please hold on a moment!\u201d\u2018What am I talking about, making the Heavenly Dao wait for me?\u2019What the hell, it was the Violet Clouds Divine Lightning Alarm!Li Changshou hastily opened his Dao robe, removed the 60-pockets Dharma treasure shorts he was wearing inside, and put it away inside his bangle.He did not expect that he would need to reveal some of his trump cards in such a situation.This was something completely unexpected, given how much preparation he had made for the Heavenly Tribulation.Initially, the Heavenly Dao was not that vigilant toward him.A cloth rope with a jade fragment was wrapped around his left shoulder. That jade fragment shone with faint esoteric Dao runes.It was the Nameless Jade Fragment. When Li Changshou was five, a group of tomb raiders had come by with some ancient wares to trade with the tribe for livestock and money. This jade fragment was treated as an ordinary jade. After Li Changshou had discovered that an ancient character, translated as the word \u2018fire\u2019, was inscribed on it, he obtained it through wheedling.Its function was unknown.However, ten years after Li Changshou had joined the sect, he had secretly placed the jade fragment beside his Master. Upon using the predictive technique he had just learned, he discovered that he could no longer predict his Master\u2019s future moves, which was something he could do previously.The jade fragment\u2019s function was to avoid being found through prediction, and it was something he always carried along with him.The cloth rope was originally a piece of linen splattered with blood. It was found in-between an ancient animal-skin scroll that held historical records of the human race. This linen cloth should belong to a piece of clothing some human expert wore after getting injured.According to the records written on the animal skin, any human wearing it would gain the protection of the Saints of the human race. However, it had to be used with pure intentions.After taking off the cloth rope and Nameless Jade Fragment and stuffing them back into his bangle, Li Changshou took out a dagger from it before looking behind him.The oppression falling on him from the sky had reduced slightly.Li Changshou was delighted, but he quickly calmed down again. He twisted his head and looked at a spot on the back of his left shoulder. There was an ancient talisman directly tattooed onto his skin, which was currently emitting faint flashes of light.Li Changshou slid his dagger through the talisman, breaking it instantly\u2026Fortunately, when the wound healed, later on, the talisman would repair itself as well.That was the Ancient Secret Talisman of the Mage Race. It was used to evade and provide protection from disasters, trouble, and predictions. It was made by the Mage Ancestor to defend against the demon race.Its effect would be activated after being carved on animal skin, but carving on flesh and blood would procure greater effects.There was a similar secret talisman carved at the side of his torso, which Li Changshou cut through as well\u2026The oppression falling on him from the sky, immediately, reduced once more.That was not all\u2026Li Changshou grasped hold of the keyword \u201cprotection against prediction\u201d, so he instantly put away all the other items he usually carried with him.For example, the two old coins sewn into a pocket in his underwear.They were claimed to be the first version of coins used by humans from the ancient times, thus containing some merits within, combined with the ability to protect against prediction and evade disasters.A demon bone fragment was tied to his ankle, and a rainbow fish scale was pasted on his thigh\u2026In total, there were about seven miscellaneous \u2018strange\u2019 trinkets Li Changshou had used on his Master\u2014as his test subject\u2014to see if one could use them to evade from prediction techniques\u2026As these items were not Dharma treasures, they were hard to be discovered but easy to obtain.Speaking of the Primordial Times, other than the various Dharma treasures, mystical abilities, and experts, the most memorable thing was the mysterious prediction technique.Experts with high cultivation levels and proficient in prediction would borrow the power from the Heavenly Dao, pinch their fingers together and instantly know what was going on at places far away.Li Changshou himself could be considered a \u2018small secret\u2019, having reincarnated to this Primordial World while retaining his memories from his past life. Thus, he had to keep his guard up at all times. He had obtained these trinkets through hard work and luck.However, he would never expect that even the Heavenly Dao would be affected!The oppression was slowly disappearing by this point, along with the old Daoist priest\u2019s face on the gray cloud. However, the gray cloud was still floating above his head.Li Changshou broke out into cold sweat. He might have collapsed onto the ocean surface if his psychological capability was not strong enough.He had obtained these items purely to prevent others from using the prediction technique on him, and not to use against the Heavenly Dao.\u2018Any intentional disguise when one was at a very low cultivation level would instead attract attention from experts, drawing trouble to oneself.\u2019As he understood this logic early on, Li Changshou had always been using a common disguise when he was in the sect.Why would he purposely go against the Heavenly Dao?Maybe\u2026Probably\u2026Could it be that there were different forms of the Heavenly Dao?Opportunistic, energy-saving, fully-operational, high-performing?Cough. That was a joke.The Heavenly Dao monitored all living organisms but did not pay special attention to any, especially those who had yet to become an immortal and were not destructive.The Eight Lightnings Tribulation Li Changshou just experienced was based on how the Heavenly Dao calculated his potential. The strength was already configured.It was only when something wrong occurred after he transcended the tribulation that the Heavenly Dao paid attention to him.Originally, the Heavenly Dao would adjust the strength of the Heavenly Tribulation for other cultivators like Li Changshou, whose cultivation exceeded expectations. This way, the cultivator would undergo a trial hard enough. If the cultivator could not withstand it fully, they would die, and their Dao would disappear.However, it was unexpected that Li Changshou possessed so many strange trinkets that provided protection against prediction. Therefore, the Heavenly Dao misjudged while it was in the \u2018energy-saving mode\u2019.Also, the Heavenly Dao scrutinized him, a \u2018half-immortal\u2019, exposing all his secrets.The oppression he felt served as a warning and not as a way to investigate the matter.It was the Violet Clouds Divine Lightning Alarm.\u2018It is still okay. Might be because I was polite earlier.\u2019Li Changshou regulated his breathing and wore on his short-sleeved shirt and Dao robe, as he contemplated how he should thank Grandmaster Heavenly Dao.An explosive rumble suddenly reverberated in the air, and the surrounding scenery changed!Li Changshou cupped his fists together and did a Dao salute.Then he shouted once more, \u201cDao Sect\u2019s disciple wishes to inform the Heaven today!\u201cWhat happened with the Tribulation Transcendence is unintentional on my part! Those were just methods I used to avoid man-made incidents or disasters!\u201cThe Dao base I possess currently is built on the Dao Sect manuals I obtained, based on the teachings of the Dao Sect\u2019s founder, and through the hard work, I had put into cultivating!\u201cPlease rain down another Lighting Tribulation, looking at how hard I had worked to attain my cultivation level!\u201cAlso, please allow me to change the location to avoid any accidental death!\u201dThe gray cloud above started to gradually expand. A strong gust of wind blew from all directions, and numerous gray clouds rose from the ocean surface within the radius of thousands of kilometers as they gathered above Li Changshou\u2019s head.Li Changshou seemed to immediately come to a realization, for he turned heads and dashed toward the ocean.Previously, in order to prevent people from causing trouble before the Tribulation Transcendence occurred, he had especially sought out several potential locations and set up an array at the ocean bed used to speed up movement in the water.No one would have predicted that he would head over to the second location, not because of people interrupting, but because he needed to transcend his second Heavenly Tribulation!Two times of the Immortal Ascension Tribulation? Such a thing was unheard of\u2026Evidently, it was not too over-the-board for him to make so many precautions to face the Heavenly Tribulation!This time, the Tribulation Cloud hovered over the ocean in a 1,000-kilometer radius. The thickness of the Tribulation Cloud was ten times more than before.Li Changshou swiftly moved across the ocean surface, the huge Tribulation Cloud floating at the same speed above him towards the East.Above the Tribulation Cloud, there was a majestic heaven palace with countless gray human figures loitered around it. In addition, a dignified emperor was seated inside the palace.These human figures were made from the Tribulation Cloud, and they had indistinguishable facial features.Underneath the heaven palace were two huge statues of a dragon waving its claws, and a phoenix with wings expanded. They seemed to be about to come to life in the next instant and fight each other.Below the two statues was a war between a hoard of ferocious beasts and a crowd of towering human figures, as though they were reenacting the Demon-Mage War.Lastly, furthest below were a number of silvery-white lightning spots with a tinge of purple, scattered around the Tribulation Cloud, but were swiftly congealing. This was the formation of a 10-feet-diameter lightning pond!The lightning inside this pond was like liquid, as the pond was slowly being filled.The second location Li Changshou picked was 150 kilometers away. The arrays he had set up in advance helped Li Changshou to move swiftly over water.In the very instant he arrived at the second island, a rumbling sound could be heard.Without much care about anything else, Li Changshou grabbed hold of a sack and threw it hard. Six folded Faraday Cages were flung in all directions, for he did not have the time to open them\u2026Before the sack could fall onto the ground, Li Changshou was already clutching a carving knife in his left hand and a wooden sword in his right hand! Several talismans flew out of his sleeve opening!Upon sensing something, Li Changshou stumbled when he lifted his head.What was this?The lightning pond in the sky tilted slightly, and a \u2018lightning waterfall\u2019 poured toward him\u2026Countless bolts of lightning lit up the sky in an instant!Li Changshou waved his carving knife swiftly and carved several ancient characters in the air. The Dharma powers in his body were activated. His upper body started to emit seven-colored immortal light as he accumulated his immortal energy aura at the top of his body.Boom!Li Changshou was completely submerged in the lightning waterfall. The ancient characters were almost immediately crushed, and he was also pressed to the melted ground\u2026Some time later, the lightning waterfall dissipated. Li Changshou jumped out of the deep square pit, his Dao robe tattered and aura unstable. After bending his head, he spat out a mouthful of blood.Was this his real Heavenly Tribulation?\u2018Strong\u2026 Strong enough.\u2019Li Changshou waved his carving knife and wrote a few ancient characters in the air. The content of these words was from the manual Cultivation Composition, which was written by the ancient human ancestors.These words seemed to assemble into some kind of array, lined up according to the original text before they gradually rose up to hover above Li Changshou\u2019s head.At the same time, a ball of True Samadhi Flame appeared beside him and engulfed his body.Numerous nine-petaled lotus flowers, the size of a basin, slowly bloomed around him.This was the strange phenomenon that appeared when he exerted his full strength to stimulate his Dharma powers!\u2018Come, Heavenly Tribulation!\u2019Li Changshou looked up, his long hair and Dao robe fluttering in the wind. The lightning pond tilted once more, and another lightning waterfall fell!This time, however, Li Changshou bent his knees and pushed himself into the sky. With bright eyes, he actively sought to welcome the lightning waterfall head-on!\u2018Nine Lightnings Heavenly Tribulation! I have been waiting for you for a very long time.\u2019\u2026\u201cMaster, why are we stopping again?\u201dA white cloud had stopped above the South Ocean. A young girl being pulled along by an old Daoist priest asked the question.The old Daoist priest stared at Li Changshou\u2019s second location for Tribulation Transcendence and could not help but gasp.\u201cWhat\u2026 What kind of Heavenly Tribulation is this?There is a heaven palace above, a dragon and a phoenix in the middle, and Godfiends below. Can this be the Ninth Heaven Godfiend Tribulation, which is ranked second place?\u201dThen, the old Daoist priest shook his head and sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the South Ocean today? Did these cultivation geniuses meet up to transcend their tribulations?Unfortunately, another fella is about to die because of their Heavenly Tribulation.Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. It\u2019s useless to watch this anymore.\u201dThe young girl asked softly, \u201cMaster, is that person unable to survive a Heavenly Tribulation like this?\u201dThe old Daoist priest questioned, \u201cDid you sense the surrounding spiritual energy surging toward the Tribulation Transcendence location when that Eight Lightnings Tribulation was happening?\u201dThe young girl shook her head.\u201cExactly. It is extremely difficult to survive the Eight Lightnings Tribulation, and the 32 Violent Tribulations are even more so the case. The cultivator we encountered just now had died, and yet, another one came.\u201dWith a bitter smile, the old Daoist priest added, \u201cHeaven will become jealous if one\u2019s aptitude is exceptional. There were too many experts in the Primordial Times. If the Heavenly Tribulation failed to suppress the cultivator, a Great Tribulation might arrive soon after.\u201cLet\u2019s go. There is no need to watch people die.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the white cloud continued on its trajectory toward the south. Nonetheless, the young girl took a few extra curious glances at the ocean thousands of miles away.The extremely large Tribulation Cloud was almost covering the entire ocean.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Within the 50-kilometer radius of the Tribulation Transcendence location, the waves rose to frightening heights.The Heaven Earth spiritual energy from the surroundings convened over as well. The lightning liquid from the lightning pond in the Tribulation Cloud cascaded down multiple times.Half of the island below was already destroyed. Fortunately, Li Changshou had chosen desolate locations where there were no living organisms around. As for the organisms living in the ocean, they had already fled.The lightning waterfall repeatedly descended, and the wind and rain became increasingly violent.What was originally a cultivator\u2019s Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation, which should not affect a large area, had unexpectedly become a situation where Heaven was punishing a tyrant.The Immortal Ascension Tribulation was one of the many types of Heavenly Tribulation. Its ferocity was considered quite weak, for, during the Primordial Times, Immortal Ascension was nothing significant.The true, formidable tribulation should occur when a peak Heaven Immortal attained a breakthrough to become a Golden Immortal. If their negative karma was far greater than their merits, the Heavenly Dao would not allow them to gain immortality, and the Immortal Tribulation would descend.It was a Heavenly Tribulation that could kill Golden Immortals. The Tribulation Cloud would cover thousands of kilometers, and there were different types, unlike the Lightning Tribulation.Boom!Rumble\u2014At the same time, at a place 515 kilometers south-east from the Tribulation Transcendence location.The young girl called Han Zhi, who was still on the cloud, inquired softly, \u201cWhy are we stopping again, Master?\u201dThe old Daoist priest frowned slightly as he used his powerful immortal sense to scrutinize the ocean thousands of kilometers away.Despite having the strength of a half-step Golden Immortal, he still could not see through that area heavily concealed by the Tribulation Cloud.The density of the Heavenly Tribulation power there seemed to be a little overabundant.However, based on how the Tribulation Cloud trembled and shuddered, he could still deduce if Lightning Tribulations were descending.\u201cThere is something amiss about that Heavenly Tribulation. It is already the seventh bolt, and it has yet to disperse!\u201dThe old Daoist priest pinched his fingers together to make a prediction. Then, he suddenly turned his body as he stared at the Tribulation Transcendence location, which was currently further away.\u201cThere seems to be something else other than the Heavenly Tribulation\u2026\u201dThe young girl, Han Zhi, complained, \u201cMaster, why are we not heading over to take a look?\u201d\u201cIf we are too close to it and manage to witness an Immortal Ascension Tribulation of this caliber, I am afraid that you might develop a phobia of Heavenly Tribulation.\u201d The old Daoist priest frowned and added, \u201cLet us wait a while more here and see if he can survive the eighth bolt. Logically, he should not be able to\u2026\u201dBoom! Boom!The world shook again. The eighth Heavenly Tribulation fell, and one could see the lightning waterfall from thousands of kilometers away!The Tribulation Cloud was still not dissipating?\u201cThe cultivator was able to survive the eighth bolt? Could he be a reincarnated mighty figure?\u201cLet\u2019s go, Han Zhi. Let\u2019s head over to take a look!\u201dThe old Daoist priest did not know how many gasps he made. He flew in the direction of where Li Changshou was transcending the tribulation, pulling his disciple along and with the white cloud underneath his feet to provide him with speed.However, they had just started moving when they saw a silvery-white giant lightning ball tinged in purple forming inside the Tribulation Cloud!It was as though a mythical lightning bird rose from the ocean, thus becoming the second sun in the sky!The lightning ball landed with a boom. The Heavenly Tribulation power had reached its maximal, causing the waves to rise like great mountains!The old Daoist priest continued to advance. Even at the cultivation realm he was in, more than 1,000 kilometers was still considered quite a significant distance for him.Hu\u2026Gusts of strong wind suddenly blew over the ocean. They were generated by the spiritual energy around rushing toward the island Li Changshou was on.The spiritual energy was gathering so quickly that seven-colored rays of lights were formed.\u201cA storm is brewing, Master!\u201d Han Zhi shouted in shock, \u201cThat person survived the tribulation!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This is a sign of a successful Immortal Ascension when the immortal is absorbing the spiritual energy!\u201d The old Daoist priest looked excited. \u201cLet\u2019s go! This person must be a reincarnation of some mighty figure. Look at the amount of spiritual energy. The man, no, the immortal, will directly ascend to become a Heaven Immortal!Quickly! Let\u2019s head over and befriend him! If we convince him to join our sect, it will be wonderful!\u201dThen, following his speech, a violet bolt of lightning flashed in the sky above the Ninth Heaven. It pierced through the Tribulation Cloud and landed on that island!The old Daoist priest\u2019s eyes widened. His flushed face turned beetroot under the illumination of the divine violet lightning\u2026What was going on with him today?When he had thought that the person would fail, the latter had succeeded.He had just said that the person had managed to survive the tribulation, and another divine bolt of lightning suddenly struck\u2026He swore that his words did not cause this!Han Zhi grumbled, \u201cMaster, what is that?\u201d\u201cHeavenly punishment! A true heavenly punishment.\u201d The old Daoist priest replied solemnly, \u201cThe Heavenly Dao felt that he was an abnormality. Even if he transcended the tribulation, he would still be subjected to the heavenly punishment.\u201cIt is over. This person is dead for sure. There is nothing good about the arrival of the heavenly punishment\u2026\u201dThis time, before he could finish speaking, the wind howled violently around them the moment he said that the person was dead for sure. Boundless spiritual energy once again congealed toward the island.\u201cEh? This mouth of mine!\u201dCrack!The young girl beside extended her hand and covered her master\u2019s mouth. \u201cStop speaking, Master. Let\u2019s quickly head over to take a look.\u201dThe old Daoist priest shook his head with a smile. He pointed ahead, and the white cloud sped up.They were 400 kilometers away from the island, which was surrounded by a sea of ganoderma-shaped auspicious clouds.The Tribulation Cloud in the sky split into various white clouds before swiftly congregating into a funnel shape, in which the tip of the funnel was pointed at the person undergoing the Tribulation Transcendence.Pure spiritual energy flowed down from the white cloud, concentrating on the human figure, which could be vaguely seen.A beam of golden light shone from the Ninth Heaven and enveloped that person.There were many shadows of fairies dancing to the encompassing immortal music inside the light pillar. As they danced, they scattered flower petals around.A white-haired old man riding a crane even flew over and executed multiple Dao salutes at the human figure below.These were all Heaven Earth phenomena.The current Heavenly Tribulation power was already very scant.By the time the old Daoist priest and his disciple were around 300 kilometers away, the phenomena were still present in the sky. The human figure, which had already completely absorbed the Tribulation Cloud, suddenly turned around and jumped into the ocean\u2026The old Daoist priest was momentarily stunned. He hastily used his immortal power to send a voice transmission,\u201cDao friend!\u201cWe are cultivators from the Golden Turtle Island, and we came specifically to congratulate you!\u201dYet, there was a burst of immortal light in the ocean, and the person disappeared.\u201cWhy did he escape, Master?\u201d asked Han Zhi while frowning. \u201cActing as though we are bad people.\u201d\u201cSigh. How would he know if we were good or bad people?\u201dThe old Daoist priest lamented and pinched his fingers together to make a prediction. However, he failed.\u2018He evaded the divine prediction?\u2018That person should be a reincarnation of some mighty figure without a doubt. Otherwise, they would not have been so cautious.\u2018I am quite proficient in the skill of prediction, and yet I failed to find any traces of him.\u2018He clearly cultivated in the ancient times and knew the dangers of the cultivation world.\u2019\u201cHan Zhi, do you still want to head over and take a look? That person had already left.\u201d\u201cYes, Master. I want to know just how powerful this Heavenly Tribulation was.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The old Daoist priest looked at her lovingly, controlled the cloud underneath their feet, and led his disciple.A moment later, they finally landed on the island. However, the young girl\u2019s face had on a look of\u2026 disappointment.Half of the small island was gone. A square deep hole underneath the ocean water replaced the destroyed side of the island.\u201cMaster, is this how all Immortal Ascension Tribulations are like?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the old Daoist priest replied with a smile as he stared at the tattered, blood-stained shirt floating on the ocean water. \u201cYour Heavenly Tribulation will certainly not be as powerful, and will at most be 10% of this strength.\u201dHan Zhi\u2019s mouth twitched. This statement sounded so\u2026The old Daoist priest pointed at the tattered shirt below, causing it to be engulfed in flames and quickly turned into dust.\u201cThe person was in a hurry to leave and left this item behind.\u201d The old Daoist priest explained with a smile, \u201cIt can be considered developing virtuous karma with him, by helping him remove any latent danger. Let\u2019s go, or else another expert will come over to check this place. It would be troublesome to attempt explaining this situation.\u201dHan Zhi nodded her head slightly. As her master was dragging her towards the south-east, she looked down and stared at the pitch-dark pit at the bottom of the ocean.\u2026\u2018Was the bloodied shirt discovered by someone?\u2019Li Changshou silently calculated. He used his immortal power, executed the Water Escape with his full strength, and anxiously hurried toward the west.He had sensed the old Daoist priest and young girl approaching, which was why he had given up on recuperating on the spot, absorbed the last breath of spiritual energy and fled.That bloodied shirt had been taken from a mortal soldier\u2019s dead body when he had been in the mortal world. Li Chngshou had soaked it with spiritual energy, so it should be able to interfere with those who wanted to pursue him.He had personally chanted the Expiation Sutra for that soldier, helping the latter swiftly head to the underworld and reincarnate.\u201cAhem!\u201dThe water torrent formed using the Water Escape technique vibrated slightly as blood trickled into it. The blood had yet to disperse before it was washed away by the torrent.At that moment, Li Changshou\u2019s entire body was shining with seven-colored immortal light. However, spiderweb-like cracks covered his body from his chest to his waist.In truth, his immortal body was not that bad. Worse still was his immortal nascent, which was collapsed unmoving by the dantian\u2026Everyone would understand that logic, but why\u2026 would there be a tenth lightning bolt for a nine-lightning tribulation?\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dLi Changshou could not help but cough twice. Feeling pain all over his body was nothing, but it was difficult to deal with having to repeatedly vomit blood.Since the ancient times, how many cultivators, who had passed their Tribulation Transcendence successfully, would end up in such a wretched state?He stopped inside the water and checked his jade fragment and the trinkets he had previously removed from his body.He started to become dizzy, and his body began to sway in the water.Li Changshou naturally knew that the last violet divine lightning was actually the heavenly punishment for obscuring the divine prediction\u2026That heavenly punishment had caused the severe injuries he sustained.Fortunately, Li Changshou had reacted swiftly. In the instant he had sensed that the heavenly punishment was about to arrive, he had taken out the few defense Dharma treasures he owned\u2026One could not block the Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation using Dharma treasures, but it was possible for heavenly punishments to a small extent.These Dharma treasures were not of extremely good quality, so they had helped Li Changshou to dampen some power from the heavenly punishment. This had allowed him to escape.When the violet divine bolt of lightning had landed, Li Changshou had felt relieved.He did not owe the Heavenly Dao any karma.\u201cPew!\u201dBlood spurted, but Li Changshou used his hand to stop the blood flow.His Primordial Spirit and immortal nascent were too severely injured, and he would need to find a place to silently recuperate. If he did not do so, the cultivation realm he had attained after frantically absorbing spiritual energy from the Tribulation Transcendence would drop\u2026He had gained countless insights when he had been transcending the tribulation. These would form the foundation of his continual ascension and would need to be absorbed quickly.Li Changshou extended his immortal sense and madly searched the ocean. After a short while, he smiled and dashed southwards toward the recesses of the ocean.Moments later, deep roars could be heard. A 200-feet-long monster fish left the domain it had lived in for the past hundreds of years, and swiftly swam westwards.There was a lump on its back, flashing with immortal light, and one white jade lotus flower would occasionally appear.Li Changshou, who was hidden inside the monster fish, completely concealed his aura.Despite having severe injuries, he did not forget to circulate the Turtle Breathing Mantra.The monster fish did not know what was wrong with itself, to continuously want to swim toward the west while remaining hundreds of kilometers away from the coast\u2026Li Changshou originally planned to recuperate inside the monster fish. However, a few days later, his injuries were almost healed. Both his immortal body and nascent could gradually self-heal.He relaxed, and the insights flowed to him, forcibly pulling Li Changshou\u2019s consciousness into the abstruse immortal realm\u2026This was known as the door of perception, and it was a mysterious realm.Li Changshou was lost inside a strange realm. He could sense the changes in his environment and control the rough direction of where the monster fish was swimming. Yet, he could not wake up.He did not sense the passing of time while he was lost in this esoteric Dao Realm.However, a bit of his immortal sense continued to drift around the monster fish, so as to provide him with timely warnings.The monster fish continued to swim westwards, and five months passed. One day, two huge metal spikes reached into the ocean and pierced through the fish.Li Changshou was alarmed. However, as he did not sense any danger, he did not leave that abstruse Dao Realm. He waited quietly at the back of the fish and continued to experience and understand that Dao Realm.In actual fact, he was unable to leave even if he wanted to\u2026The monster fish, with Li Changshou inside, was dragged by two boats onto the coast and then into a relatively large village by a group of strong and fit young people who wore primitive clothes.With a rough scan of the outside with his immortal sense, Li Changshou discovered that the majority of the people there were mortals, with only a few of them capable of completing Qi Refinement and Soul Formation.He sensed his body sliding out of the fish the moment it was sliced open.Then, a dramatic scene played out.These fishermen treated Li Changshou as the Sea God and started prostrating and dancing in celebration around him. They even started a celebration banquet that lasted for several days, while putting him on a pedestal\u2026After all, when he slid out from the fish, his body shone with immortal light and was completely dirt-free. He looked very heroic.Li Changshou remained in this state for the next two months, while these fishermen treated him as their god.A young girl around 13 years old was selected to be the maidservant to guard by Li Changshou\u2019s side day and night.Another two weeks passed before Li Changshou finally managed to absorb all insights and break free from that abstruse realm. While he closed his eyes and checked his insides for a while, morning arrived. The young girl in the adjacent room woke up.Upon hearing the light footsteps, Li Changshou opened his eyes and stood up, prepared to thank the young girl before quickly leaving this place.Li Changshou spoke the moment the young girl lifted her leg and was about to cross the threshold.\u201cThank you, mi\u2014\u201dThe door curtain opened, and an arm as thick as Li Changshou\u2019s thigh reached inside.Li Changshou blinked.Did he sense wrongly? It was a young man and not a young lady?He immediately changed the address. \u201cThank you, mister, for saving me!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dA figure entered the room. First was a beautiful face, then a short fit body and 3,000 flowy black hair strands\u2026The young girl spoke in a hoarse voice. \u201cHey! Why did you wake up, Sir Immortal?\u201d\u2018Immortal?\u2019Li Changshou took note of this detail and started to feel wary.According to how the fishermen before that had been addressing him, shouldn\u2019t he be called Sea God instead?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He hid in the trunk of a large tree in the oceanside forest and used his immortal senses to scan all over this village.As the saying went, \u201cEach place has its own way of supporting its own inhabitants.\u201d\u2018Could this village\u2019s water and soil have been mixed with strong medicine?\u2019As far as his immortal sense could see, a group of strong men and women were busy everywhere, and they weren\u2019t just ordinary strong men and women. They had a kind of\u2026 indescribable, aristocratic strength.As far as his immortal sense could see, there were men and women with prominent muscles all over their bodies. Each of them had arms nearly as thick as his junior sister\u2019s waist, and dozens of kilograms of millstones were rolled around by a few children as toys.Other than a small number of old people and children, most of the people in this village were about the same size as the young lady he had seen earlier.\u2018I might be overthinking. This village probably pursues the beauty of muscles.\u2019Li Changshou smiled in his heart. When he was observing this village, he vaguely felt his immortal body and Primordial Spirit that had yet to fully recover.The immortal sense was much better than the spiritual sense. Not only did it have a further detection range, but the images \u2018seen\u2019 were also clearer and more vivid.Before the Tribulation Transcendence, Li Changshou\u2019s spiritual sense could at most detect a range within a few dozens of kilometers. However, all he saw were blurred images, and he could only see clear images within 15 kilometers.Now, it was different, as he could casually release his immortal sense and observe up to 1,000 kilometers away.Just at that moment, even from 500 kilometers away, he could roughly distinguish the two figures wrestling on the forest meadow and their approximate fighting movements\u2026It seemed that they were not fighting there\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t need to care about these details. Anyway, my detection skills have been greatly enhanced!\u2019Li Changshou returned his attention to the village 50 kilometers away.The young lady, who had taken care of him for some time, hurriedly rushed into the wooden house, where he had been staying earlier, with a group of people and found a pile of gold and silver that he had left on his bed.It had been more than nine months since he had left the Immortal Du Sect, and he could still stay outside for at most three or four years. After that, his master and the sectarian officers would go looking for him.\u2018During this period, I should find an island and enter seclusion.\u2019There were still many things to do, and he must now think clearly and arrange his schedule one thing at a time.Naturally, there was no need to mention about recuperating and stabilizing his cultivation realm.He had to find a way to conceal his immortal power and immortal body, and simulate his original mortal Dao body.Since he had chosen to conceal his cultivation level as a trump card in the beginning, he had to stick to that path to the end. If he was suddenly exposed, he would definitely be suspected by the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s higher-ups.The development of the third version of the Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra had to be on his schedule.In addition, Li Changshou had to face an awkward fact.Because after he had passed the Heavenly Tribulation, his strength had taken a big step forward, and he had gained the rumored \u2018ascension\u2019.This was naturally a good thing, but one-third of the defensive methods he relied on before were completely meaningless, and one-third of them had their effectiveness greatly diminished.For example, the Soft Immortal Disperser and many poisonous pills had already been a bit useless.When he wasn\u2019t powerful enough, the incapacitating agents and poisonous pills were powerful weapons to protect himself.Right now, the poisonous pills were no longer as effective as him making a move on his own.Many poisonous pills, which he had refined to deal with Perfected Immortals, could only be stored for future uses. Otherwise, he could go to the border of the Middle Continent and trade them for treasured herbs in the marketplace.The power of that bronze crossbow could be increased according to the user\u2019s Dharma powers and immortal power.This offensive weapon that consumed very little immortal power could be kept. Later on, he would use his immortal power to brandish it and develop its potential. Then, he could let the paper dolls use it.The same went for the True Samadhi Flames. Their power increased with his strength, and he only needed to replenish his cultivation and condense the immortal fire.The paper dolls\u2019 mystical abilities needed to be comprehended again, and future paper dolls would have more wonderful uses and power than before.The Five-Element Escape technique could also be used to enter a whole new realm.The sword array Dharma treasure needed to be brandished again as well.Some powerful talismans that had previously been impossible to draw could now be made.The Heavenly Precious Umbrella could create some more powerful arrays.\u201cWait, wait, wait, wait\u2026\u201dAfter taking a closer look, Li Changshou had many things to do, and three or four years might not be enough.It was a good idea to first pick the most important ones and upgrade the most commonly used escape techniques.There were priorities, and his life came first.So what even if he had ascended? What could he do after ascending to an immortal?Through Immortal Ascension, he had become a stronger ant.Ascension had given wings to this ant to fly to the sky. However, he was still a flying ant, only with clearer goals.Age wasn\u2019t counted in the Primordial World, and it had been countless years since then. Even though the Great Tribulation continued to descend, there were still too many surviving experts.There were the Heavenly Dao, Dao Ancestors, and Six Saints above.There were mighty ancient figures, the Three Schools\u2019 elders, remnants of mages and demons, experts of the human race, and all kinds of superior beings reincarnating below.Right now, he was not even a third-rate expert and was not even close to achieving that.The important point was that he was especially poor.His immortal sense captured noises in the distant village, and the sturdy young lady crouched there bawling as she hugged the pile of gold and silver that Li Changshou had left behind.\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who lost the immortal! I didn\u2019t sell the immortal either!\u201dUpon seeing her squat on the ground and crying like a child, the group of \u2018iron towers\u2019 and \u2018King Kongs\u2019 around her were still ruthlessly blaming her.\u201cI told you to take care of the Sea God. How can you lose sight of such a big one?\u201d\u201cOh, did you have to run out and yell for someone? Couldn\u2019t you just stand at the window and shout \u2018the Sea God is awake, the Sea God is awake\u2019? Why did you have to run around!\u201d\u201cI told you that the Sea God is not an immortal!\u201cXiong Lingli! Don\u2019t listen to your father! You can\u2019t offend the Sea God!\u201cHurry. Take these gold and silver to the village chief\u2019s house! Lest these things provoke the Sea God!\u201dXiong\u2026The surname suited them\u2014the posture of a true bear[1].The group of adults scolded the young girl for a while before they then dispersed. They did not punish the young girl and began to search for their \u2018Sea God\u2019 inside and outside the village.Li Changshou continued to observe in secret.This village was somewhat strange, which was also the only reason why Li Changshou would stay 50 kilometers away and didn\u2019t leave.There were always demons when things were abnormal, and it was also possible that there was a hidden treasure.Thousands of people in the village relied on fishing and hunting to make a living and lived a full life. The place was in good weather with no natural disasters.As for man-made disasters, a few thousand regular troops from the mortal kingdom tribe would not be able to take down this village, let alone those small gangs of bandits and sea pirates.However, the vast majority of the people in this village did not cultivate and were all mortals, yet they were all as sturdy as young girls, which was somewhat unjustifiable.First of all, their nutrition was definitely not up to par.The people didn\u2019t train their muscles deliberately either.Of the several possibilities Li Changshou could think of, the most probable one was that there were special water veins or ingredients, and they were large in quantity.Often, the kind of magical objects that mortals didn\u2019t care about would be a treasure for alchemy, blacksmithing, array formation set-up, and cultivation.Together with the fact that there were no traces of any foreign cultivators in this place, the few cultivators, who were at the Soul Formation Stage, in the village should be cultivating some sort of defective techniques, which were not uncommon within the human race in the mortal world.Only then did Li Changshou become slightly more interested and decided to stay 50 kilometers away to do some observation.The group of strong people searched the village to no avail.After searching with their utmost best for half a day, an old man cried out in desperation, \u201cThe Sea God has returned to the big sea!\u201dTherefore, this group of villagers, most of whom had the surname Xiong, returned to the village and began a lively bonfire assembly to celebrate the Sea God\u2019s return to the sea.After Li Changshou observed for three days, he went to secretly check the water source of the place, investigated the food commonly eaten in this village, and searched the nearby 50 kilometers, but did not find any abnormalities.Could it be that they really had an inherited body type?Li Changshou didn\u2019t want to spend too much time here and decided to leave since he couldn\u2019t find the reason for the abnormality of this place.In the middle of the night, Li Changshou squeezed out from the trunk of the large tree, transformed into a medium-sized fish, and plunged into the warm seawater to find the next place for seclusion.This place was in the southwestern part of the South Continent and the scope under the influence of the Southern Ocean Dragon Palace.Because the Southern Ocean Dragon Palace was too far from land and not as active as the Eastern Ocean Dragon Palace, this sea was unusually quiet and peaceful. Li Changshou soon found a small deserted island where he entered seclusion.Three months later, Li Changshou\u2019s Dao injuries had completely healed, and his Water Escape and Earth Escape had also greatly improved. He had cultivated the True Samadhi Flames once again and condensed the immortal fire.Five months later, the immortal light around Li Changshou, who was sitting in a lotus position in the reef cave, had completely dwindled. His breathing was no longer clear, he had no threatening gaze, and his body\u2019s faint fragrance had disappeared.Standing up, he lowered his head and sized up for a while, and his own aura no longer fluctuated in the slightest bit.Walking to the reef\u2019s side, Li Changshou stood quietly and observed the creatures\u2019 reactions in the seawater.Previously, because of the immortals\u2019 existence, the fish and shrimps in the sea would dodge.Now that he was standing here, the fish and shrimps in the sea were only alarmed for a little while before they played as usual.After thinking about it, Li Changshou first simulated the aura of the Seventh Stage of the Void Return Realm. He hid part of it before revealing the aura of the Third Stage of the Void Return Realm.The Third Version of the Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra was a phenomenal success.\u2018I\u2019ll pass the second version to Ling\u2019e when I go back.\u2019Exhaling lightly, Li Changshou was in quite a good mood and did not want to waste any more time. He was about to return to the rock cave where he was hiding before to continue his cultivation.He was just about to turn around when a ray of seven-colored precious light suddenly appeared in the northern sky.Li Changshou\u2019s immortal sense immediately scanned and discovered that the source of that precious light was the village that the young lady, Xiong Lingli, was from.There was indeed good stuff in that village!However, making such a big commotion would most likely attract the attention of other cultivators, and he might easily fall into danger if he rashly went over there.After some deliberation, Li Changshou took out a paper doll from his sleeve and blew at it.The paper doll shook a few times and slowly came to life. It stretched its small arms and legs and jumped up in Li Changshou\u2019s hands before landing on the sea surface.The little paper doll took two steps on the seawater and transformed into the figure of a middle-aged Daoist. It caught the three storage sacks thrown by Li Changshou, turned around, and disappeared into the seawater.Li Changshou returned to the rock cave and closed his eyes while he put his mind on the paper doll.He put his mind in a very relaxed state.He would pick up treasures if he could. If he had to do more than a \u2018pick up\u2019, then he would let the paper doll do it.After all, as his cultivation realm rose, the more advanced the paper doll was, the more laborious it would be to produce it.Since this was the mortal world, it was unlikely that there would be any powerful Dharma treasures.\u2026At the border of the South Ocean and the East Ocean, the corner of the island that resembled a large turtle.\u201cFellow Daoists, I\u2019m speaking the truth.\u201cOn the way back last time, I came across a man who had survived the Nine Heavens Godfiend Tribulation. I said that he couldn\u2019t go through it, but he did!\u201cThe Heavenly Punishment even struck this man after his Tribulation Transcendence, and I felt again that he definitely would not make it, but\u2026\u201cFellow Daoists, guess what happened next.\u201dNext to the precious pond, an old Daoist priest was chatting with more than a dozen cultivators of similar Dao cultivations in a lively manner.In the corner under the pond, Ao Yi regained his original azure dragon form and entrenched at the bottom of the pond without moving.The Primordial World was truly terrifying.The nightmare still hadn\u2019t subsided, but Ao Yi took the initiative to request his mother this time to send himself back to the territory of the immortals from the Jie School.That was because Ao Yi knew that there were some human tribes among the Jie School, so he could observe them and learn from them what the dragon race lacked, especially their craftiness and schemes.The topic of the cultivators at the side of the pond was unwittingly changed to the little dragon at the bottom of the pond.One of them said with a sigh, \u201cThe gap at the bottom of the pond has been set up with a restriction. I don\u2019t know what exactly this Dragon Prince finds so bad about our Golden Turtle Island that he actually escaped.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for a child not to want to listen to an old man.\u201dThe old Daoist priest, who was telling the story of encountering the Tribulation Transcendence just now, laughed and stroked his beard as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as we treat this Dragon Palace\u2019s prince well, he will appreciate our kindness and cultivate at ease here.\u201dThe cultivators nodded their heads in unison.Ao Yi, who was in the pond, moved his dragon head but ignored them.[1] Xiong can also mean bear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat was going on?As his immortal sense was disturbed by the precious light from the north, Li Changshou and other paper doll clones approached the village and hid in the treetop of a large tree. Only then could they see the situation inside the village.Hundreds of villagers were gathered around the village gate, where a stage had been set up with several figures dressed in Daoist robes jumping on it. Someone was preaching there.He saw that the source of the precious light was actually a clay statue behind those \u2018preachers\u2019.Li Changshou smiled in his heart, and the paper dolls transformed into middle-aged men before they jumped off the treetop and left right away.He thought that some kind of treasure was born and thought of going over and picking it up.Nowadays, where could there be so many treasures for him to pick up?If such preaching happened outside the South Continent, it was 80% a propaganda activity conducted by some great sects to recruit disciples.However, if something happened within the South Continent, it would either be money swindling or collecting incense offerings and merit.This was commonly seen.The cultivation level displayed by those preachers were all at the Third or Fourth Stages of the Soul Formation Realm.The old Daoist, who was guarding that three-foot-tall clay statue, displayed a cultivation level at the peak of the Void Return Realm and was close to the Dao Requital Realm.In short, it was something that had nothing to do with Li Changshou.The paper dolls conjured hand seals, hid behind a tree, and began to execute the Earth Escape.The sound of a chanting sutra came with the wind and reached the paper dolls\u2019 ears and Li Changshou\u2019s heart. He heard the sutra being chanted.\u201cWith great aspirations to validate the supreme Dao, it is the enlightenment of the West\u2026\u201d\u2018The Western school?\u2019The paper dolls conjured hand seals a little faster. As soon as a few ripples appeared on the ground in front of them, the paper dolls couldn\u2019t wait to get into it.They ran even faster than before.At the same time, Li Changshou\u2019s original body on the deserted island also stood up and cast an Illusion Spell to transform into a fish, which headed straight towards the east.The Western school caused great karma, so what was he waiting for if he wasn\u2019t going to leave this place?Unexpectedly, this was still the southwestern part of the South Continent, which was very far away from the Aparagod\u0101n\u012bya Continent. Yet, the Western school had already come here to collect incense offerings.However, as Li Changshou was about to retreat, his immortal sense suddenly captured something strange in the seawater in the southeast direction.About 80 kilometers away, there was a dense cloud of demonic aura that was now swimming in the direction of the precious shining light.Li Changshou immediately stopped and fell into the bottom of the sea, doing his best to conceal his tracks.He stopped the paper dolls, which were still traveling underground as well, and they stayed still.\u2018Was a sea demon attracted to the precious light of the village? This is not a good thing.\u2019After carefully observing it, the cultivation level of the great demon in the sea was equivalent to a cultivator at the early-stage Perfected Immortal Realm. The body wrapped in the demonic aura was a big, odd-looking fish, which was somewhat similar to a manta ray. However, its body was larger and more than 1,000 feet in length and width.If he considered that the other party was concealing its cultivation level, it was probably around the late-stage Perfected Immortal Realm.Under the rich demonic aura, this demon\u2019s body was also wrapped around a wisp of sanguine glow, which was like flames.This was a sign that this creature was vicious, and its karmic hindrance had taken shape due to its sins.Li Changshou\u2019s heart was pounding.Of course, it wasn\u2019t that he had any special preference for such a strange, bizarre object. It was purely because he was attracted to the power of the negative karma on this great demon.Removing such a thick negative karma would earn him a lot of merits!\u2018Should I kill this great demon at the same time?\u2019Li Changshou\u2019s heart was racing with thoughts.After Immortal Ascension, his foundation was too weak, and he didn\u2019t have many treasures.Merits were a good thing, and quite rare.If he locked himself in the sect to cultivate and did not do good deeds that contributed to Heaven and Earth\u2019s stability, he would not get a single one for hundreds of years.If he was a ruthless person who was dedicated to validating the Dao with power, he would have to avoid being blessed with merit, thus ensuring that the later stages would not be influenced by the Heavenly Dao.However, Li Changshou didn\u2019t have such lofty aspirations, and the problem he was considering was practical.If there were more merits to protect him, he would be safer as well.If he could obtain great merits in the future, he wouldn\u2019t follow the elders\u2019 example of cultivating Dharma treasures. Instead, he would first create a Golden Body of Merit!A Golden Body of Merit was equivalent to having a gold token for a death penalty exemption. There was no need to be too afraid no matter what calamities he would encounter.At that time, even if a Saint were to forcefully hit him, he would have to hesitate whether to lose several times the merit power of the Golden Body of Merit.Of course, the Golden Body of Merit was extremely difficult to obtain, and it required a massive amount of merit power.To this day, the Heavenly Dao was becoming more perfect. There weren\u2019t many chances for him to obtain great merits.Going to the Heavenly Courts would be a better chance to earn merits. Li Changshou had also previously considered related matters.Let\u2019s talk about matters on hand first.Killing this great demon would certainly give a huge amount of merits.As the saying went, \u201cSand accumulates into mountains, and water drips into oceans.\u201d Everything had to have a beginning.It went as far as to get karma from the demon race.The human race and the demon race were archenemies. Even if Li Changshou was polite to the demon race, if he fell into the hands of a demon race expert one day, he would only be thrown into the deep-fryer.He did not need to be polite towards the demon race.However, if he considered that the other party might have hidden their cultivation level, Li Changshou would also have to take a slight risk.This was the South Ocean and not a place for demons to gather. There was only this great demon\u2019s demonic aura within a radius of 1,000 kilometers, and there was an island with just random little demons.Now that Li Changshou had succeeded in evolving the Water Escape and Earth Escape, it was no problem traveling 50,000 kilometers in a day. After he killed that thing, Li Changshou would immediately run away and hide in the mortal world. He did not need to be afraid of other demons taking revenge on him.Moreover, he had the ability to stop it while ensuring his own safety. However, watching this big fish demon kill the people from his fellow race was a bit unreasonable.After all, he had gone through two lifetimes.Despite Li Changshou wondering whether the people from the Xiong Village were from the same race as him, he held reservations.\u2026With the mindset of giving it a try, Li Changshou cast the Water Escape and was ten times faster than that great demon. He quietly rushed to a sea region 50 kilometers from the shore.Except for the Three Schools\u2019 Immortal Sects, most of the escape techniques in the Primordial World were quite hard to find.Nowadays, valuing treasures over spells was prevalent in the cultivator community, causing many to belittle the escape technique\u2019s role.After predicting the great demon\u2019s route, Li Changshou\u2019s robe sleeves shook, and six paper dolls flew out from his sleeves, transforming into men and women with different looks, figures, and aura.The six paper dolls immediately got busy at the bottom of the sea and began to quietly set up a trapping array suitable for casting in the water.The Precious Umbrella was useless for the time being and hadn\u2019t been upgraded yet.Li Changshou retreated towards the shore, met up with the paper dolls hidden underground, put the paper dolls away, and then found a forest by the sea to hide.He closed his eyes and put his heart into the rustling of leaves in the wind within a radius of 50 kilometers.A moment later, huge waves surged on the sea 50 kilometers away!A circular array appeared on the surface of the sea, trapping this giant wave directly!The hundred-meter-long demon didn\u2019t notice the ambush and crashed into the temporary trapping array. Then, it noticed that something was wrong and immediately started jerking!The six paper dolls had appeared from all over and rushed to the demon\u2019s surroundings, each sprinkling several bottles of poisonous powder and using their immortal powers to adhere to the great demon\u2019s body.In a split second, the seawater around the demon became turbid. The demon\u2019s body was corroded, and its soul was severely damaged!\u201cWho! are\u2026 you guys\u2026\u201dThis time, Li Changshou had sacrificed the last two bottles of transcendent-grade Soft Immortal Disperser.Although this great demon had a higher Dao cultivation realm, it was significantly less resistant to medicine than the Second Prince of the Eastern Ocean Dragon Palace that he had encountered previously, and his actions immediately became incomparably slower.Li Changshou was highly tense.After the six paper dolls had finished scattering the poisonous powder in their hands, each of them held a sword and charged forward in a criss-cross manner. A talisman, which was established by the immortal light, also appeared in the sea.The sword array and the True Samadhi Flames had shown their power at the same time!The talismanic array was like chains, locking this great demon in all directions. The talismanic power erupted, sealed, electrocuted, froze, roasted, and so on.The demon body, which had been mostly corroded by the poisonous powder, had lost much of its defensive power.Six strokes of the immortal sword wrapped in True Samadhi Flames sliced through, and the great demon\u2019s body immediately had six more intersecting cracks!Wisps of True Samadhi Flames penetrated the cracks everywhere and ignited using this demon\u2019s essence, Qi, and spirit as fuel.The huge fire wrapped around this great demon in the sea in the blink of an eye, but the latter couldn\u2019t utter any screams.Among the trees on the shore, Li Changshou clenched his left fist while the six paper dolls each held fire swords and rushed into each part of this demon\u2019s body.Within the array wall, the flame burst forth in the seawater!The surface of the sea exploded into columns of water, and several pieces of the wrecked body wrapped in the True Samadhi Flames rose into the sky. The demon\u2019s soul was locked in midair by long chains of talismanic arrays and was directly engulfed by the True Samadhi Flames!Li Changshou cast the Five-Element escape technique\u2014from Wood Escape to Earth Escape and Water Escape. His figure rushed towards the place where the trapping array was.When he arrived in the array, three paper dolls were sitting in a lotus position on the sea\u2019s surface and chanting the Salvation Sutra, the Rebirth Mantra, and the Blessing Mantra.The three paper dolls disposed of the poisonous powder remaining in the seawater and opened their mouths to suck the polluted seawater and indestructible flames into their stomach for recycling later on.The True Samadhi Flames were really fierce. In ten minutes, the great demon\u2019s huge body was already nothing more than a puddle of ashes on the surface of the sea.Li Changshou got out of the water, and a question suddenly popped in his mind.The power of True Samadhi Flames was too strong. If he needed to use it for alchemy within the sect and a bystander suddenly asked him how his True Samadhi Flames cultivation was coming along, wouldn\u2019t that be\u2026It was time to figure out how to reduce the power of this True Flame. It would be best if the power was controllable and could be adjusted at will.Li Changshou threw out the Soul-Bewitching Pearl. As his sleeve robe lifted, the pile of ashes and seawater was taken into his palm, clumped into a ball of water, and thrown into the air before exploding apart lightly.It was unexpectedly somewhat relieving\u2026As the chanting continued, Li Changshou gripped the Soul-Bewitching Pearl and checked the remnant memories inside.Well, this great demon really wasn\u2019t from the South Ocean. It originally lived in the West Ocean.There weren\u2019t many powerful people among their ancestors. The demon race deep in the ocean had been unable to help themselves up due to the lack of luck.This fish demon had killed countless people, and countless fishermen had been buried in their hands. He was killing it on behalf of the heavens.A ray of golden light suddenly flew up on the sea\u2019s surface and entered Li Changshou\u2019s arm.Li Changshou was suddenly flooded with a small amount of enlightenment, feeling that his own Dao had additional protection, and his quest for longevity seemed to have become slightly smoother.This was merit.By rough estimation, probably by killing a few millions of these murderous demons, he would be able to condense the Golden Body of Merit. Or he should forget it. It was nice to stay in the mountains without going out.\u201cEh?\u201dLi Changshou furrowed his brows as he saw something strange in the thing\u2019s memory fragments.It had snuck an attack on the village, pretended to be repulsed by a clay statue, and returned to the sea to lurk\u2026Then, it had snuck an attack on other villages, pretended to be repulsed by clay statues, and returned to the sea to lurk\u2026The corner of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but twitch. The chanting had just ended, and he immediately packed up his paper dolls, Dharma treasures, and storage sacks.He did not recycle the array base. He hastily destroyed the array, cast illusion techniques, and Illusion Spells, and madly executed the Water Escape towards the east.This great demon was from the Western school!It was with those preachers in Xiong Village!They first propagated the essence of the Western school there, waited for the demon to sneak an attack, used the clay statue to pretend to repel the demon, and revealed the \u2018miracle\u2019. Thus, they reaped a harvest of a group of die-hard believers to provide incense offerings for the Western school!This scheme was certainly contemptible. However, Li Changshou was not so righteous to debunk this matter and did not want to have anything to do with the Western school.The Two Saints of the West, who loved to send people westward, were also plotting to confer the gods.Many of the unnecessary conflicts between the Dao Sects before and after the God-Conferment Tribulation had been plotted by these two Saints!After the god conferment, Laozi had turned the barbarians into Buddhas with one hand and forced the Western school to become a Mahayana Buddhist Sect.It was a matter of propaganda. The Five Saints had been involved!The Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal had only been a pawn in this game of chess that the Saints were casually playing with, let alone a small immortal like him, who had just passed through Tribulation Transcendence.\u2018I can\u2019t afford to provoke them. I should quickly slip away.\u2019Li Changshou used the Water Escape and Earth Escape alternatively to the east as fast as lightning.He originally thought that he was already at the limit of 50,000 kilometers per day, but he didn\u2019t expect that he had exceeded that in half a day.He still had the potential after being frightened.After Li Changshou went ashore, he found a place to do a touch-up on his makeup and got all the physical disguises and magical disguises ready.This time, Li Changshou transformed into a weak scholar and rushed towards the northeast.His right hand hiding in his sleeve grasped onto the Soul-Bewitching Pearl as he scrutinized this large demon\u2019s fragmented memories.Not long after, he actually found some more useful information.Li Changshou even heard of the Three Schools\u2019 Immortal Sects right in the middle of a conversation about them, which was spoken by someone else to this great demon.\u2026When Li Changshou fled 25,000 to 30,000 kilometers\u2026Outside the Xiong Village, a group of strong men and women were bored and yawned while watching these people on the platform jumping around.These cultivators were also a bit puzzled and constantly communicated with their eyes.Theoretically, their boss should have appeared. Why was there no sight of him?Had their boss overslept? Had he gotten the place wrong?This prayer dance had been danced three times, and the simple villagers below had grown tired of watching it.\u201cAhem!\u201dThe old Daoist priest coughed and stopped the chanting. He first shook his head and then shouted in an odd tone, \u201cIf you believe in God, you can be protected by them! You are invulnerable!\u201cWang Cai, come demonstrate for everyone.\u201dThe young man who had been chosen agreed to it. Immediately, he secretly was able to put a talisman on himself and knelt in front of the clay statue to offer incense. A golden light then appeared in front of his chest and on his back.This talisman was called the Vajra Talisman, which was considered a relatively early-stage talisman. It naturally had no problem resisting the weapons in the mortal world.However, the young disciple took half a step forward and was just about to follow the \u2018process\u2019 of calling out for one or two people to come up and slash him with the blade.As far as his eye could see, his thoughts gathered, and his heart pounded wildly, signaling madly.When looking at the field, the humanoid creatures seemed so strong that it was unbelievable. Wang Cai\u2019s entire body was gradually engulfed by shadows, and the corners of his mouth twitched a few times.Suddenly, he found a young lady with swollen eyes and looked rather cute behind the group of people. He pointed at the young girl with a happy heart and said, \u201cYoung lady, can you come up here and try to slash me?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh.\u201dXiong Lingli looked up and wiped her tears. Her little face looked very pitiful.The moment she squeezed out of the crowd, Wang Cai\u2019s legs couldn\u2019t help but shiver.This was a personal habit, which was understandable.Xiong Lingli asked softly, \u201cDo I really have to hit you?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dWang Cai turned his head to look at the second person on the team, and that old Daoist priest glared at him. Wang Cai could only agree while his mind was constantly telling him, \u2018This young lady is just a little stronger. She\u2019s just a mortal. Right, she\u2019s just a mortal. We are cultivators. We\u2026 will not be scared.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His own Dharma powers rushed like tidal waves, unable to calm down for a long time. As they flew, he would spray a mouthful of blood at the side.Fortunately, he had reached the Soul Formation Realm. With such injuries, he\u2026Pfft!Maybe, he would really die.The old Daoist priest quickly shouted, \u201cWang Cai! Wang Cai!\u201dWang Cai, whose mouth was covered in blood, turned his head and forced a smile at his master. He said in a trembling voice, \u201cMaster, I\u2019m fine. We\u2019re cultivators\u2026\u201cMaster, let\u2019s not\u2026 come to this village anymore, okay?\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t. We won\u2019t come anymore.\u201d The old Daoist priest felt quite moved. \u201cHurry. We will find a stable place. You should meditate quickly.\u201cAlso, vomit blood towards your senior brother next time. I\u2019ve just gotten my Daoist robe not long ago.\u201dWang Cai replied weakly, \u201cYes. Master\u2026 can you give me one pill?\u201dThe old Daoist priest said with a sigh, \u201cI only have a healing pill. I don\u2019t have a Qi-Regulating pill. Bear with it for a while. You\u2019ll be fine after you go back and meditate.\u201dAt the village gate, that group of villagers rushed out.They were all full of disgust a moment ago, but now, they were watching the backs of the five people in the air with eyes wide open.An auntie said in a low voice, \u201cThey can fly?\u201d\u201cCould it be that they really are the messengers sent by God to help us?\u201d\u201cHey, God\u2019s messenger, don\u2019t go!\u201d\u201cGo after them, go after them!\u201dA hunting uncle roared, and a group of people at the village gate instantly surged out, causing it to shake and collapse.The five people in the air turned their heads, and their expressions changed uniformly.They saw a big group of strong men and women speeding along at the back, causing a thick cloud of smoke and dust on the ground to drift up.It was like a magnificent army of 1,000 men and horses galloping, and each of them was shouting something.\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dTheir voices were too strong, and their yells were too noisy!This old Daoist\u2019s face changed drastically. He took out two talismans and flung them out. The air suddenly broke out in a gale, and two white clouds rose towards the sky, quickly dumping behind the group of villagers chasing after them below.\u201cMaster, why are they chasing us? We didn\u2019t sell them any talismans!\u201dThe old Daoist cursed angrily, \u201cDid you guys cheat the young lady in the village again?\u201d\u201cMaster, we\u2019ve been dancing all day, and the boss never came. Therefore, we didn\u2019t have a chance to cheat her even if we wanted to\u2026\u201d\u201cCough! Cough, cough!\u201dWang Cai said in a trembling voice, \u201cWe absolutely cannot afford to cheat anyone! We would really die\u2026 Pfft!\u201d\u201cVomit over there!\u201d\u201cI swallowed it back, Master.\u201d\u201cGood disciple.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll cast some more Dharma powers.\u201d The old Daoist cast his power again. \u201cThis remote place is really full of strange things. Let\u2019s quickly meet up with the boss before we do anything else!\u201dNot long after, these two white clouds flew farther and farther up in the sky.The villagers of the Xiong Village, who were chasing below, retreated without success. One by one, they hung their heads and felt dejected.First, they had allowed a Sea God to run away. Then, an Earth God left as well. When all the people of the village gathered for a meeting in the evening, they were all a bit downhearted.Was their village so unpromising to the gods?They were all fragile mortals, and they all need protection as well.Xiong Lingli, who was the main person involved in both incidents, was not scolded. Instead, she was only punished to serve tea to the old people of the village.The village chief saw that everyone was in low spirits. The old man, who was wearing a large gold chain left behind by Li Changshou, gradually got an idea in his heart.\u201cLet\u2019s all cheer up! Don\u2019t we still have the Sea God?\u201cAll these years, some natural disasters have been happening during fishing on the sea. There were generally no accidents during hunting.\u201cIn my opinion, let\u2019s make a statue for the Sea God and worship him on time. We will definitely be blessed!\u201dA few cultivators in the village and Xiong Lingli\u2019s father were about to speak. However, the graceful woman at the side with a rarely seen figure in the village gently pressed on his stout arm, indicating that he should not speak.Soon, the Xiong Village villagers began to discuss how they should worship and give offerings to the Sea God.When Xiong Lingli\u2019s mother, who was that graceful woman, took out the portrait she had painted on the beast\u2019s hide while Sea God had been sleeping, this group of villagers got excited. In the night, they began to search for the stones to create the god statue and carried a pile of large stones back to the village.During the late night, Xiong Lingli was sound asleep on the bed where Li Changshou had lain.In the next room, the couple was snuggling on the edge of the bed.Xiong Laosan said in a deep voice, \u201cDear, why didn\u2019t you let me remind everyone previously that it was an immortal, not some Sea God?\u201d\u201cThe matter of offering sacrifices is nothing more than giving everyone a little comfort in their hearts. Would an immortal care about us?\u201d The woman sighed softly. \u201cI originally thought that Lingli would be able to become this immortal\u2019s disciple and learn the brilliant methods of immortal cultivation. But I never expected that the immortal would leave after waking up.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you teach me the cultivation method, dear?\u201d Xiong Laosan said with a laugh. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fine to pass it on to Lingli?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just a superficial Qi Refinement technique. How could it be compared to those of the immortals?\u201d The woman thought for a while. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to send Lingli to become a disciple at an immortal sect, but the road to the Middle Continent is too far, and I can\u2019t bear to give her a bumpy ride.\u201d\u201cIn that case, shall we have another child?\u201d Xiong Laosan chuckled. \u201cWith another child, how about letting this older child just leave home and wander around?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying. Our child is sleeping next door\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to knock her out!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Just be careful.\u201d\u201cHeh, heh.\u201dNot long after, Xiong Lingli, who was sound asleep, heard some familiar noises. She rolled over and continued to sleep.Seemingly dreaming of how she had been accused during the day, this young girl sobbed a few times softly and fell into a deep sleep.\u2026A few months later, on the grassland, Li Changshou, who had been hurrying on his journey, found that the Western school did not pursue him. He had gone around the mortal world once and had finally returned to this place.Having made a simple earth cave next to his parents\u2019 grave, Li Changshou stayed there temporarily.Although the mortal world had rich turbid Qi, he had no plans to improve his cultivation, so there was no harm in staying there temporarily.He shouldn\u2019t have been in a rush walking in the mortal world with a magnificent landscape. Since he was afraid that the Western school would find him, he hadn\u2019t taken it easy.The mountains in the vast South Continent were beautiful with rushing rivers. However, there was no beautiful scenery that would make him stop his escape technique.Tribes from countless cities had expedited countless humanistic landscapes over the years, but none of them could make him look back for a while.\u2018I seek longevity, and I am not envious of the mortal world.\u2019While sitting in the earth cave in a lotus position, Li Changshou\u2019s mind was blank. He comprehended his own Dao and pondered on the method to control the power of the True Samadhi Flames.The fire seedling of the True Samadhi Flames was ignited by the essence, Qi, and spirit. It was theoretically unlikely for him to reduce the power of the True Samadhi Flames.However, he could change his way of thinking.For example, after returning to the mountain, he could ask Lan Ling\u2019e for help, so that she could get a few strands of essence, Qi, and spirit out. He would then condense them into a fire seedling by himself and store them in his body.It was just that Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s cultivation was still shallow and she had yet to reach the Void Return Realm. Hence, the kind of fire seedling condensed would be too weak.Being too strong or too weak were both unattractive.Also, it was easy to deteriorate Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s health.With a twirl of his fingertips, Li Changshou had an extra wisp of True Samadhi Flames in his palm, and he began to think of other solutions.There was a solution to every problem. Li Changshou took a few days to figure out the solution.He just wouldn\u2019t use it.\u2018Ahem, I\u2019ll just use the Qi flame.\u2019He would use the power of the Primordial Spirit within the Qi flame to simulate his spirit flame\u2019s fluctuations and the essence flame. The power of his own Qi flame alone at this time was quite strong, but it was not too outstanding.Life was probably like this\u2014It was hard to be perfect.The method of increasing his strength, concealing his aura, and simulating his aura could deceive the seniors of higher cultivation. However, it also left a small flaw to the True Samadhi Flames.After going back, he should always pay attention to this matter.When a Perfected Immortal grasped his wrist, it would be difficult for the other party to see his true cultivation level even if they deliberately probed.This illness that caused him to twitch when a woman touched him could also be healed.Having made this journey in the mortal world, Li Changshou had reaped some benefits.\u2018Speaking of earning merits, engaging in some inventions for the human race seems to give merits as well.\u2019After stroking his chin for a while to ponder, he quickly dismissed such thoughts.There were still relatively many opportunities to earn merits among the human race, such as medicine and production tools.However, the prerequisite for doing so was that he had to be strong enough.By relying on his own accumulation at this point, as soon as great merits or abnormal phenomena were granted by the Heavenly Dao, it would definitely be known by the Six Saints.The most likely outcome for himself was that the old Saints would see through him. Then, they would extract his soul and dissect it\u2026\u2018I should just cultivate honestly.\u201dLi Changshou laughed softly in his heart, dispelling these vivid thoughts.While sitting steadily, he could be carefree\u2026\u2018I\u2019ll go?\u2019What did that mean?Without warning, some fine fuzzy images and a wisp of fuzzy sensation appeared in Li Changshou\u2019s heart.In that image, a group of strong men and women were\u2026 kneeling and praying for blessings at his feet?He quickly predicted with his fingers and was soon caught between laughter and tears.What was going on?Had the Xiong Village really made a statue of him and worshiped him as a Sea God?The Heavenly Dao was self-perpetuating. Was he also receiving incense offerings now?Didn\u2019t this seem like coercion?Li Changshou shook his head and smiled bitterly. He was not too worried about the matter at first.After all, it was only a village with 1,000 people. After they made up an inaccurate Sea God and found that it didn\u2019t work after a few months, they would naturally stop worshipping.He would not get too much karma from this.But soon, Li Changshou realized that things weren\u2019t that simple.Wasn\u2019t he now equivalent to competing with the Western school for incense offerings alone?If the Western school\u2019s Saints sensed this and they predicted with their fingers\u2026\u2018No, I have to rush back to the Immortal Du Sect and return to the Grand Pure One\u2019s territory!\u2019With the old ones up there, he did not need to fear those two in-name disciples, who brainwashed and undermined people!Among the Six Saints, only the Three Pure Ones and Nuwa were considered to be the progenitors of the Dao.Of course, it was unlikely that the Grand Pure One came from the Immortal Du Sect.As long as the Western school had fears, that would be enough.Li Changshou was immediately alert, and his figure disappeared in the earth cave, heading towards the East Continent.The journey was much faster than when he came, and there was much less excitement on the way.Occasionally, he would skim onto spiritual beasts, hear children\u2019s pastoral songs, and also get to see a couple pack up their valuables to elope and get chased by a group of villagers. That uninterrupted expedition was still bloodshed.Li Changshou left the South Continent and entered the East Continent. While he explored, he rushed to the Immortal Du Sect.After two days, when there were still 10,000 kilometers away from the Immortal Du Sect, he deliberately slowed down the speed of his Earth Escape to meet the limit of a disciple at the Third Stage or Fourth Stage of the Void Return Realm and slowly approached his own sect.After entering the 1,000 kilometers range, Li Changshou finally heaved a sigh of relief.It was truly a great blessing in life to have the protection of an immortal sect!However, Li Changshou had said that he was returning home to guard his parents\u2019 grave. If he couldn\u2019t last three years, he was afraid that he would become the topic and attract bystanders\u2019 attention when he returned to the mountain.It was not good to be abnormal. Most of the disciples would stay in the mortal world and enjoy for two more years.It was finally peaceful in this place.Li Changshou found a mountain hideout near the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s spiritual mine and was prepared to cultivate there for two years before returning to the mountain.The Primordial World was truly dangerous!The human heart was too complicated!He had clearly done nothing to the Xiong Village, and yet, they were worshipping him, forcing him to compete with the Western school for incense offerings!Now that he had survived the Tribulation Transcendence, he had to implement the idea of staying in the mountain and never going out!The mortal world was a dangerous place. There was no peace on earth!If he wandered around again, he would just\u2026 just\u2026Well, the oath of the Primordial World was very accurate, and he couldn\u2019t speak the words from his heart at will.\u2026\u201cSenior Brother!\u201dUnder the willow tree by the lake, Lan Ling\u2019er, who was meditating in her loose training attire, suddenly opened her eyes and breathed more heavily.\u201cIt\u2019s a dream.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e exhaled softly. She had fallen asleep accidentally while meditating just now and dreamt that her senior brother was trapped by a group of strong, strange people. The scene was very chaotic, and her senior brother was about to be pinned down on the ground.Fortunately, she sensed someone coming outside and woke up from her dream.\u2018Oh?\u2019Lan Ling\u2019e looked up at the figure she had sensed. That was a somewhat familiar senior sister, who she didn\u2019t quite know and was drifting on the cloud and wandering around the Little Qiong Peak surroundings, seemingly hesitant to enter the isolation array.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a scorching smell in the air.What should she do?She really didn\u2019t want to meddle in other people\u2019s business, especially those that had nothing to do with her senior brother.Three of them, who were strangers to her, were sitting on each side of the short table that she had moved over.The one sitting across from Lan Ling\u2019e was the first to arrive, a Senior Sister of the Du Lin Peak, Liu Yan\u2019er.Lan Ling\u2019e had thought that this new senior sister, who had come to find Li Changshou, was a \u2018dangerous person\u2019 just like Senior Sister Youqin. However, after they had chatted for a while, Lan Ling\u2019e realized that she had misunderstood her.This senior sister was obviously looking for Li Changshou for some serious business.It all started seven years ago at the Priming Meet when Senior Sister Liu Yan\u2019er had fallen in love with Senior Brother Wang Qi, who had gone to the North Continent with her.After returning to the mountain, the two of them used cranes to send letters and exchanged glances, and their affection gradually grew stronger.Recently, Senior Sister Yan\u2019er and Senior Brother Qi had a plan to cultivate together. They decided to go to the Bai Fan Hall to officially register themselves as Dao companions, and they cultivated together on the Du Lin Peak or Little Ling Peak.However, nobody had expected that Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s junior brother, someone from the Du Lin Peak, on Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s left side, Liu Sizhe, would suddenly step out.He was against this marriage!He had been secretly in love with her for 100 years.Ever since Liu Sizhe had entered the sect from a young age, he had always been following behind his gentle senior sister, who had the same surname with him, and called her \u2018Senior Sister\u2019, \u2018Senior Sister\u2019.Gradually, the young man had worries. He had a pretty girl in his heart.However, Liu Sizhe felt that his cultivation level was not as good as his senior sister, so he couldn\u2019t protect her. He kept this thought in his heart, cultivated hard, tried to get enlightened, and gradually stood out in the sect.Liu Sizhe was now the disciple who ranked sixth in the sect. He had already reached the Sixth Stage of the Void Return Realm, had received a treasure bestowed by the sect, and had teachings handed down from the Peak Leader of the Du Lin Peak.Surprisingly, when he wanted to express his feelings to his senior sister, he saw his beloved senior sister was about to be led away by a fellow disciple from the Little Ling Peak!When Liu Sizhe immediately stepped forward to express his feelings to his senior sister, Liu Yan\u2019er was shocked at the time but rejected Liu Sizhe right away.\u201cJunior Brother, I have always treated you as my closest junior brother.\u201dLiu Sizhe was unhappy with that. He kept questioning Liu Yan\u2019er about her affair with Wang Qi and even invited the latter to a private fight.Junior Brother Qi Qi\u2026Wang Qi, who was from the Little Ling Peak, was not weak either. Ever since his return from the North Continent, his cultivation level had broken through successively, and he had restrained his wanderlust a lot. Now, he had just cultivated to the Sixth Stage of the Void Return Realm, and his ranking had been raised to the eighth.After Wang Qi asked Liu Yan\u2019er about it, he fully respected her opinion and did not agree to the fight.As a result, things became more and more deadlocked, and Liu Sizhe and Wang Qi did not give way to the other at all.These days, it even caused a confrontation between the Du Lin Peak and Little Ling Peak disciples, provoking a reprimand from the sects\u2019 elders.This matter had to be resolved as soon as possible.On this day, Liu Yan\u2019er came to the Little Qiong Peak with no other reason than to find Li Changshou, who had traveled with them at that time and ask him to testify about it.This way, he could explain to Liu Sizhe how Senior Sister Yan\u2019er and Junior Brother Qi Qi had fallen in love at first sight.Unexpectedly, as soon as Liu Yan\u2019er arrived, Wang Qi and Liu Sizhe caught up with her from behind, resulting in such an awkward situation.Lan Ling\u2019er also felt slightly distressed as she looked at the short table that was almost about to be blown apart by the anger of the two.It was made by Senior Brother himself.\u201cSenior Brothers?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dTwo serious, dignified faces looked over at the same time, and Lan Ling\u2019e drew her neck back.Lan Ling\u2019e said with a smile, \u201cCan the both of you wait aside? We ladies have some words that are inconvenient to be overheard by you guys.\u201dLiu Sizhe and Wang Qi both looked towards Liu Yan\u2019er, who had a helpless and urging gaze.Suddenly, these two stood up and walked towards the side of the lake.Wang Qi, however, was very considerate and made a Dharma boundary under the tree.Upon seeing that, Liu Sizhe also walked back and made another thicker, stronger layer on the periphery of the boundary.Their eyes met, and they turned hostile.Inside the boundary, Liu Yan\u2019er felt overwrought.\u201cSenior Sister Yan\u2019er, my senior brother has gone to break off his ties with the mortal world. He won\u2019t be back for at least another year.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e paused and reminded her, \u201cYou can find Senior Sister Youqin to discuss this matter.\u201d\u201cI went there earlier.\u201d Liu Yan\u2019er sighed lightly. \u201cJunior Sister Youqin is in seclusion, and I don\u2019t dare to disturb her. Only Junior Brother Li Changshou would have a say in this.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e was a bit puzzled. \u201cBut what if my senior brother proves that you have fallen in love at first sight?\u201d\u201cThis junior brother of mine is very inflexible,\u201d said Liu Yan\u2019er with a bitter smile. \u201cHe now thinks that I\u2019m using Junior Brother Qi Qi as a shield to not delay his quest for immortality.\u201cBut I really\u2026\u201cWhat should I do? I went to Martial Aunt Jiu\u2019s side and asked her too. She\u2019s also in seclusion.\u201cJunior Brother Changshou is not here either.\u201dLan Ling\u2019er was just about to tactfully express that this had nothing to do with the Little Qiong Peak.Before she could compose her language, she suddenly felt that the earth seemed to have trembled.When she looked up, she saw that the two senior brothers were already \u2018wrestling\u2019 with each other\u2019s legs in the open space in front of the straw hut!Because the sect forbade disciples to fight privately, one needed to report to the Bai Fan Hall in advance in the case of any enmity, and the sect would arrange a method to break the enmity.As immortal seedlings, Wang Qi, and Liu Sizhe were very restrained at this time.They just put their respective left feet forward and touched with it their knees. Their eyes were as if they were trying to devour someone!Liu Yan\u2019er raised her hand to cover her forehead for a moment, not knowing how to express goodwill.Lan Ling\u2019e blinked. This situation\u2026 was similar to the way the spiritual beasts in the beast pen at the back of the mountain competed for a mate!Lan Ling\u2019e laughed softly in her heart and made up her mind.She got up and walked out of the boundary, shouting to the two, \u201cStop fighting! You guys can\u2019t kill the other by fighting like that!\u201cUm, no.\u201cPlease note, Senior Brothers. Disciples are forbidden to fight in private in the sect, and this is also the Little Qiong Peak.\u201cSince the two of you are here, why don\u2019t you follow the Little Qiong Peak rules? No matter who Senior Sister Yan\u2019er chooses in the end, you guys have a competition here first to see who is better.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dThe two of them jumped away from each other. Although their knees were in severe pain, they both acted as normal and nodded their heads.Liu Sizhe asked, \u201cWhat rules?\u201d\u201cMy senior brother loves to brew wine.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e smiled slightly. \u201cI will invite the two of you to taste it.\u201dA few moments later\u2026With two clanging sounds, Wang Qi and Liu Sizhe lay on the short table. The wine jar in their hands dropped, even though they had only drunk one-third of the contents.After all, it was the diluted Beauty\u2019s Charm that Jiu Jiu used.Liu Yan\u2019er gently exhaled and smiled gratefully at Lan Ling\u2019e.However, she had no intention to leave right away.\u201cSenior Sister Yan\u2019er, I have a method that might help you make a decision.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e felt helpless and motioned for Liu Yan\u2019er to lean forward a little before she whispered something in her ear.Liu Yan\u2019er said with a frown, \u201cWill that be okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just to make Senior Brother Liu back out of an awkward situation. If he can even accept someone else\u2019s children, we can think of other ways.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e winked. \u201cBut remember to tell Senior Brother Wang Qi and find someone to witness it in advance, lest your reputation is tarnished, Senior Sister.\u201d\u201cI understand! If this matter can be accomplished, it\u2019ll be all thanks to you!\u201dLiu Yan\u2019er got up excitedly and made a Dao salute. Lan Ling\u2019e waved her hand at once.Soon, this senior sister used two clouds to take the two drunken junior brothers into the air and drove the clouds towards the direction of the Du Lin Peak.\u201cSeriously. They have to find my senior brother for everything. Is he that free?\u201dNot knowing what trouble she had caused, Lan Ling\u2019e snorted softly. She took a handkerchief, took this short table to the side of the lake, and carefully cleaned it.\u2018Should I tell Master to go to the Du Lin Peak to watch the fun? Forget it. It\u2019s better not to cause any trouble, or else Senior Brother will definitely scold me again when he comes back.\u2019\u201cStupid Senior Brother! What\u2019s wrong with bringing your junior sister with you to sever ties with the mortal world? I\u2019ll even kowtow on behalf of you!\u201cSeriously\u2026\u201cWhen I do that In the future, I\u2019ll drag you there even if you don\u2019t want to go! Hmph!\u201d\u2026In a valley near the Heaven Number Six Spiritual Meridian 1,000 kilometers southwest of the gate of Immortal Du Sect.Li Changshou woke up from his meditation and murmured with his eyes at ease, \u201cI wonder if Ling\u2019e is in trouble.\u201dHis cultivation realm was strengthening. Although his cultivation level hadn\u2019t improved, his strength was growing at a rate visible to the naked eye.After checking the spider webs put around him, as well as the small warning arrays everywhere, Li Changshou changed to another rock cave and continued in seclusion.In the blink of an eye, a year had passed since he had arrived at the surroundings of the Immortal Du Sect.Although he was just outside the sect, he did not want to go back too early. In addition to the three years of visiting his parents\u2019 grave, he also had to consider the time spent on the journey back so that he could do something that a disciple at the Fourth Stage of the Void Return Realm should.During the three years that they did not return to their sects, the immortal seedlings from various peaks should improve a stage or two in their cultivation realm, right?He could just keep up with the mainstream disciples while showing himself at the Fourth Stage of the Void Return Realm. He could enjoy most of the treatments as a disciple and not receive too much attention from the sect.The closer it got to the day of returning to the mountain, the more troubled Li Changshou felt.As the saying went, \u201cA man without money is no man at all.\u201dHis current assets were seriously incomparable to his own cultivation realm.He had been in a similar situation when he played games in his previous life and got a huge gift pack but didn\u2019t get any good equipment that he could use.Where could he get some precious materials?Little Qiong Peak\u2019s complex array formation would require many precious materials if he wanted to modify and improve it.To improve his own means of defending against an enemy, he also needed many precious materials.It would be nice if he had an endless supply of Spirit Stones to spend.Li Changshou quietly pondered with his chin on his hand.He had actually had a devious idea to open a small branch at the side of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s spiritual mine, and the problem of the Spirit Stones would be directly solved.However, Li Changshou felt that this was truly improper.After all, the Immortal Du Sect had been grooming him for so many years. Now that he was a bit stronger, he was going to dig into the spiritual mine of his own sect?He was no longer taking the wool from the sect, but directly digging for mutton.\u201cTake a walk at the nearest marketplace? Sell some of the poisonous immortal pills?\u201dLi Changshou gave it some thought but then felt that going out like that was unnecessary.He was now a little suspicious that he might have a constitution to cause trouble.During the Tribulation Transcendence, he had miscalculated that the Heavenly Dao would miscalculate. He had gone through the Heavenly Tribulation twice and incurred Heavenly Punishment.He had been seriously injured by the Heavenly Punishment and fled towards the west by getting inside a fish\u2019s body.Because at that time, the shadow of a man, who he discovered had come to his place of Tribulation Transcendence, had come from the east.In the end, a huge fish like that could even be fished to shore by a mortal!He had come across the Xiong Village and ended up with the Sea God\u2019s name.He had his original face at that time, and all his own disguises had been destroyed in the Heavenly Tribulation. The god statue that had been built by the Xiong Village a year ago was his original face.If he took the initiative to go to the marketplace, which was mixed with bad elements, wouldn\u2019t that cause more trouble?Oh, that was right. His god statue should have collapsed, right?Since he did not manifest it, it would definitely have collapsed.Li Changshou predicted with his fingers, and he froze. Then, he felt helpless.\u2018Damn it! Ahem. An immortal shouldn\u2019t swear.\u2019What was going on?How had there been more than 100 of his god statues?His incense merit had unconsciously gotten so much?! It was much more than killing one great demon!What was going on?Because he carried some objects that blocked the divine prediction, he had to take the initiative to predict for him to sense where the \u2018believers\u2019 were worshiping him.\u2018It couldn\u2019t have\u2026\u2018Could it be\u2026\u2018Is it possible that\u2026\u2018Village Chief!\u2018I know the secrets of those groups of strong people in the Xiong Village! They have been praying to a Sea God every day!\u2018After praying to this Sea God, not only would their bodies become stronger, but they would also reap double the harvest when fishing out in the sea! There were no illnesses or disasters, so it was accurate!\u2019\u201cHurry! Let\u2019s do one too!\u201dThe corners of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched madly as he mentally recreated this image.What\u2026 What should he do?If he said that he really didn\u2019t want to rob the Western school of its incense merit, would they believe him?What kind of poison could get rid of a Saint?Was he being downhearted now?!Li Changshou tilted his head, and a small shadow flew out of his opened mouth, but he was shocked to the point that his Primordial Spirit went out of his body. However, then he sucked it back hard.\u2018Think of a way! I have to think of a way!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018What other ways can I think of?\u2019While bathing in the morning light, Li Changshou rode the clouds and drifted slowly towards the Immortal Du Sect.On this day, the weather was fine. It was indeed a good day to return to the sect.He couldn\u2019t wait to fly back on the second day of the \u2018reasonable period to return to the sect\u2019.It was just too dangerous out there.It was better to be put under the protection of the Ren School\u2019s glory so that he could have a peace of mind.After taking out his jade token, which allowed him to go out of the sect, and arriving at the sect, Li Changshou made a Dao salute to the immortal guarding the gate. Then he said, \u201cLittle Qiong Peak\u2019s disciple, Li Changshou, has returned after breaking all ties with the mortal world.\u201dThe immortal took the jade token from Li Changshou\u2019s hand with a smile and asked, \u201cDid you gain anything this time?\u201dLi Changshou replied, \u201cActually, I did not gain anything, but I feel less worried. Henceforth, I can pursue the path of immortality with all my heart.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d The immortal smiled and waved his hand. \u201cCultivate well.\u201d\u201cYes, I still have to report to the Bai Fan Hall.\u201dLi Changshou made another Dao salute and rode the clouds at the right altitude, heading towards the Bai Fan Hall of the Heaven-Breaking Peak.The immortal guarding the gate nodded with a smile, feeling that this was a good disciple of the younger generation.After reaching the Bai Fan Hall and finding the elder on duty that day, Li Changshou finally brought his journey of going back home to a close.The journey out for Tribulation Transcendence had come to a successful end.As if\u2026 it was successful\u2026Li Changshou secretly predicted with his fingers and couldn\u2019t help but sigh softly in his heart.There had already been 132 god statues. Another two villages had started to worship the Sea God overnight\u2026He clearly didn\u2019t do anything at all.With a sigh in his heart, Li Changshou asked the elder on duty at the Bai Fan Hall, \u201cMay I pay homage to the ancestor statue in the hall?\u201d\u201cDefinitely,\u201d the elder said with a smile. \u201cThe ancestor statue there is for disciples to pay homage to. You may do so.\u201cThe Immortal Du Sect is a line of succession of the Ren School. Although there are many rules for disciples to follow, what you actually seek is to be free from restraint. You have to be mindful of your manners and must not offend your ancestors.\u201d\u201cThank you, Elder. I understand,\u201d Li Changshou replied with a rather solemn face. He carefully tidied up his robe and inner shirt, walked to the circular platform in the middle of the main hall, and looked up at the portrait above.In the portrait, an old Daoist with a blurred face, which couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, was sitting on top of a blue ox with precious light shining behind him.It was the portrait that had been painted during the Grand Pure One\u2019s theophany.His face was blurred because no one dared to draw the Saint\u2019s real face, as it would be known to the Saint, and the person might be punished.Li Changshou first cupped his fists in front and slowly did a Dao salute. He took two steps forward, lit incense, and made offerings. Then, he took three steps back, lifted the hem of his robe, and knelt on a meditation cushion.Two sectarian officers and an elder at the Immortal Du Sect happened to see the scene, and they all nodded slightly.It was rare to see a disciple like that who would come to worship their ancestor on a normal day.A few moments later\u2026\u201cWhy is this disciple still kneeling there?\u201d\u201cFocusing his mind would make it more accurate. He probably wants to be blessed by the ancestors and always have peace on his immortal path.\u201dMore than ten elders and stewards came from the various \u2018compartments\u2019 of the main hall after a few more moments, looking curiously at that direction.\u201cThis disciple couldn\u2019t have encountered some problems, right?\u201d\u201cWe have eaten a lot of his spiritual fish. Why don\u2019t we ask and help him?\u201d\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t ask us for help first, we cannot find out anything. Who doesn\u2019t have any worries?\u201dAn hour later\u2026\u201cEveryone, please return. You can stop looking. This disciple has just returned from the mortal world. His state of mind should be unstable, so he wants to calm his mind.\u201dThe surrounding people gradually dispersed.A few elders secretly thought that Li Changshou would later come over to get his monthly allowance and ask about cultivation so that he could secretly obtain some benefits.This disciple should be in trouble, but the ancestor was \u2018that one\u2019. So how could he meddle in such an insignificant disciple\u2019s affairs?At last, Li Changshou paid homage for two hours and slowly got up, feeling much more at ease.The only way to confront the Saints was to cozy up to them!This was the only way he could think of.Even if he was thus given little attention within the sect, after weighing the pros and cons, he had to come here to pay homage to the Ren School\u2019s sect master, so that he could be less existent there.The sect\u2019s rules restricted anyone from hanging one\u2019s ancestor\u2019s portrait for paying homage. Therefore, only one ancestor portrait was found there.After leaving the Bai Fan Hall, Li Changshou rode the clouds towards the Little Qiong Peak.Actually, on second thought, he could have been overthinking.How could a Saint really put himself down to target him, who was a small immortal of the Ren School?After becoming a Saint, the great calamity would not be destroyed, and the fight would be for dignity and propaganda.However, what if something happened?Wouldn\u2019t the Saint also have \u2018humanity\u2019 since they were \u2018saint people\u2019?Of course, the Saints weren\u2019t human beings born only in the ancient past. The three Dao sect masters had been transformed by Pangu\u2019s Primordial Spirit, and the other three were all connate beings with unknown followings.If those two elders of the Western school suddenly got angry over something, they would really get even with someone insignificant like him.Heh, you even dare to cause trouble?The corner of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched a few times.It seemed that the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s complex array needed to be some array that covered the secrets of Heaven!However, these types of array formation diagrams were not even necessarily available to the Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect, let alone the precious treasures needed to set them up.The Dao of the world was difficult.While still immersed in his thoughts, Li Changshou had floated above the Little Qiong Peak. When he looked down, he saw Lan Ling\u2019e meditating under the tree.\u2018Actually, it\u2019s also a matter of probability. Cultivate in peace.\u2019Li Changshou breathed and exhaled for a while. After adjusting his state of mind, he slowly fell towards the isolation array below.Soon, Lan Ling\u2019e, who was under the tree, cheered and rushed up with a few steps forward.However, Li Changshou made a gesture to her to be silent and stand still. Then, he walked over to his master\u2019s straw hut and bowed, saying that he had returned from the mortal world.A few peals of laughter could be heard from inside the house. Old Daoist priest Qi Yuan encouraged Li Changshou before going back to his seclusion and activating several arrays outside the house again.It was a crucial moment for his master to comprehend the Inaction Sutra.As he scanned with his immortal sense, the scenery from all over the Little Qiong Peak was imprinted into his heart. Some of Li Changshou\u2019s uneasiness faded away.No matter what, cultivation was still a necessity, and so was life.Even though he had previously thought of making a trip to the South Ocean to smash all of his god statues, he let them be at the thought that he could easily cause more unknown events by showing up.\u201cSenior Brother!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e blinked her bright eyes and raised her hands at her sides, fluttering a few times like a young bird. \u201cSenior Brother?\u201dLi Changshou, however, had a serious expression. \u201cCome in with me.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e shivered and put on a bitter face. After she followed behind her senior brother with her head lowered, she entered her straw hut while feeling grieved.She moved the meditation cushion, put her legs together, knelt on it, lowered her head, and put on an expression.She was very proficient in this.Li Changshou sat in the round-backed chair and activated the arrays around the straw hut.While looking at his junior sister in front of him who had put on a certain expression and adopted a posture, he sighed in a low voice.\u201cI only left for three years. You!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e closed her eyes instantly and raised her hands to grab her earlobes before she quickly shouted, \u201cSenior Brother, I know I was wrong!\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for the duel between Senior Brother Liu Sizhe and Senior Brother Wang Qi!\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this to happen! It was just a random idea the other day. I really just wanted to get rid of them. I didn\u2019t put in much thought and allowed things to get worse!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Li Changshou was startled. \u201cI\u2019m asking you\u2026 about one-third of the spiritual fish that are missing in the lake.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e froze. Then, her body bent and twisted, and she sat still there.She brought this upon herself. She had confessed to everything.\u2026More than a year ago, after Liu Yan\u2019er had left with her two junior brothers, something happened the next day.Liu Yan\u2019er informed Wang Qi that she would report to her master and the Peak Leader beforehand. Then, she would use a trick and tell Liu Sizhe that she was pregnant, hoping that Liu Sizhe would stop bothering her. She did not want Liu Sizhe to have a duel with Wang Qi.The two of them had not been seriously injured from the duel and were considered on par with each other. However, they had been punished by the sect because of having a private duel.Liu Sizhe had been punished with 20 years of seclusion and could not set foot outside of the Du Lin Peak.Wang Qi had also been punished by having his monthly allowance suspended for three years. He then became Dao companions with Liu Yan\u2019er and cultivated at the Little Ling Peak.\u201cSenior Brother\u2026 I was wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cHow were you wrong?\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 given Senior Sister Yan\u2019er this bad idea without considering their reactions.\u201d Lan Ling\u2019e responded with her head down. \u201cAs a result, it caused all three of them to be punished by the sect rules.\u201dLi Changshou pursed his lips and scolded her, \u201cIt really took you just a few years to spit out everything I\u2019ve taught you over the years.\u201cForget it!\u201cThat\u2019s the way you are. I shouldn\u2019t expect so much from you. Forget it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t just forget about it! Senior Brother, just request anything from me!\u201dLan Ling\u2019e panicked. \u201cI\u2019ll never get into trouble again!\u201cDon\u2019t give up on me, Senior Brother!\u201cI\u2019ll cultivate quietly by your side from now on, and I won\u2019t say a word to any stranger!\u201d\u201cSo tell me again, where have you gone wrong?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e\u2019s eyes were red, and she was at a loss for words. \u201cI.. I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have bothered with other people\u2019s issues!\u201dLi Changshou poked his finger on the table and said with a sigh, \u201cDo you know whether Liu Yan\u2019er\u2019s marriage destiny is to marry Liu Sizhe or Wang Qi?\u201cOne has been secretly in love with her for 100 years, while the other has known her for a few years. Why would Liu Yan\u2019er hesitate? Why couldn\u2019t she reject Liu Sizhe harshly? It\u2019s because she\u2019s hesitant.\u201cLiu Yan\u2019er is already 156 years old. Could she still not think of any other ways?\u201cIt\u2019s not that she cannot, but she doesn\u2019t want to!\u201cThis is equivalent to directly extinguishing someone\u2019s path, making her originally undecided marriage destiny a fait accompli.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you were to follow others\u2019 fate, but if you were to change the fate of others, you would have to bear the karma from the three of them.\u201cHow much of your own luck have you destroyed!\u201cDon\u2019t always think you\u2019re the smartest and have the best ideas. No one is much dumber than someone else. Only humans like to pretend to be smart!\u201cThis matter is the best portrayal of your unstable mind.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and said with a trembling voice, \u201cSenior brother, what should I do to remedy this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done too much wrong. Later on, go and apologize to Senior Sister Liu Yan\u2019er and beg for her forgiveness.\u201d Li Changshou leaned back on the round-backed chair and rubbed his eyebrows. \u201cIt seems you still don\u2019t quite understand.\u201cI\u2019ll give you the simplest example.\u201cIf Senior Sister Liu Yan\u2019er and Junior Brother Wang Qi fall out in the future, who will she blame first?\u201dLan Ling\u2019e furrowed her brows and replied in a low voice, \u201cMe, the outsider\u2026 who came up with the idea to help her reject another person.\u201dLi Changshou said with a bitter laugh, \u201cSo why interfere in someone else\u2019s private affairs?\u201cWho could explain the word \u2018love\u2019 even since ancient times?\u201cThis isn\u2019t a necessity for cultivating the Dao to seek longevity. What you think about most every day is also this matter. In the long run, you will only waste your qualification and comprehension.\u201cAfter you\u2019ve offered an apology to Senior Sister Yan\u2019er, you should also reflect well. When Liu Sizhe comes out of seclusion, so will you.\u201dLi Changshou stood up and said again, \u201cThis time, you will not be punished much. Take a slate and copy the Steadiness Sutra 300 times.\u201cWhen you really understand your mistakes, find Liu Yan\u2019er, and apologize to her.\u201dWith that, Li Changshou\u2019s expression darkened, and he was about to leave with his hands behind him.Lan Ling\u2019e shouted again, \u201cSenior Brother, there\u2019s one more thing.\u201dLi Changshou couldn\u2019t help but walk back. He raised his hand to press down on her head, rubbing her head a few times. While expecting better from her, he messed up her hair that she had carefully combed up.\u201cWhat other troubles have you gotten into? Can you tell me everything at one go? I\u2019m easily frightened out of mind by you!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t cause any trouble. This is sort of an unexpected benefit. I really only got into this trouble\u2026\u201dLan Ling\u2019e whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s about Master\u2019s injury back then. Because of Senior Sister Yan\u2019er, I heard a rumor\u2026\u201cSenior Brother, come closer.\u201dShe mumbled everything to him.Li Changshou leaned over to listen for a while before he had a slight frown. He soon returned to normal.\u201cDon\u2019t bother about this matter. Copy the Steadiness Sutra first. Apologize and find me at the Pill Chamber.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Lan Ling\u2019e, watching her senior brother drift off to the Pill Chamber.She was done for. Her senior brother\u2019s impression on her had regressed at least ten years\u2026Then, she sighed faintly and carried the meditation cushion to the willow tree.She took out a slate and a Dharmic carving knife. She rubbed away the tears at the corner of her eyes with the back of her hand and lay down with her messy hair before silently copying a certain sutra written by her senior brother more than ten years ago.After writing it once, she wiped her tears again. She erased the mark on the slate and continued writing a second time.The willow branches dangled, caressing her hair that was swept by the wind as if they were supervising her homework.\u2026Steadiness Sutra.Primordial Times\u2014AnonymousMind your own business; immortals are already established, and it is hard to compete.In the face of injustice, ponder your own strength; in times of trouble, reflect on yourself.If you have many friends, you will face many issues; if you have a few friends, you will avoid calamity.Do not make an enemy, for it will be dangerous to do so; strike first, and you will perish next.Do not restrain yourself, do not be afraid of yourself; you will be peaceful when everything is steady.When one diverts in cultivation, one retreats and advances; one gains opportunity and plans accordingly.How tragic that a former good old man was plotted against.With demon powers, there are many schemes. After being knocked unconscious, one would be thrown into the iron pot.The old tribe was imprudent but has a heaven-defying power. Nothing can be done about it.The ancient tribes forcefully fought over luck, but eventually grew lonely.Both were divided into Heaven and Earth and fell after being provoked.New men arise and wish for rituals and music. They become sages, and there will be many wise men.My generation has escaped bad luck, has a complete path to immortality, and obtained the Dao Fruits.Be steady in all things and reject karma. Avoid forcibly taking over something, and one can be happy.Avoiding natural disasters requires change, and avoiding man-made disasters is trouble-free.Approach the Dao and brighten the path of immortality. The Steadiness Sutra will accompany you.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe trouble that Ling\u2019e has caused this time will definitely cause her to lose a lot of her luck. She should be able to make up for it after being grounded for twenty years without any further incidents.In the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou sat on the rocking chair. His eyes narrowed slightly as thoughts ran through his mind.This matter had nothing to do with him being her senior brother, there was no need for him to do anything about the aftermath.Only, with Ling\u2019e\u2019s personality\u2026Perhaps he and Master had pampered her too much. It was time for her to be trained.The world is dangerous. As a senior brother, he could say this countless times, but it would never come close to having her experience it personally.As he thought about this, Li Changshou gently tapped the armrest of the rocking chair.He could hear the rustling of leaves around him.Feeling a little poetic all of a sudden, he said, \u201cHow poor.\u201d\u201cHow about I nurture my Junior Sister\u2019s intelligence, beauty, poetry, and create a \u2018coincidence\u2019 for her to run into a wealthy family. I\u2019ll marry her off, give her some gifts and then steal the sect\u2019s dowry?\u201dJust kidding. Just kidding. He was only angered by little Junior Sister, but it wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d throw her out.Now that he had become an immortal and ascended for a period of time, it was time for him to lower his Junior Sister\u2019s access to the information.In the eyes of others, he was now an outstanding Fourth Stage Void Return disciple.In Jiu Wu\u2019s eyes, he should be an immortal seedling of level seven or eight Void Return.In Junior Sister\u2019s eyes, he should be an Essence Immortal Immortal\u2026That was adequate.The secret was known only to himself and hence, a secret. If someone else knew about it, it would be called \u201cNews\u201d.After sitting idle for half a day, his immortal senses captured that Ling\u2019e had been copying sutras under the tree. Li Changshou\u2019s anger subsided greatly.Ling\u2019e told him about the rumors regarding Master\u2026If it were true, then the incident this time round concerning the three \u2013 Wang, Liu and Liu \u2013 would be very similar to what his master had experienced eight or nine hundred years ago. However, the outcome was completely different.Back then, Master\u2019s lover\u2026 had been snatched away by someone.His master\u2019s love rival had shattered his master\u2019s Dao base and attempted to cripple him. However, the punishment from the sect only required that person to reflect upon himself for a hundred years.Moreover, the other party had transcended the tribulation to become an immortal in the course of that hundred years.So far, these were the only things he knew.This matter had been suppressed because it was inglorious. It had been nearly 900 years since then, and no one had mentioned it again\u2026There were actually two disciples from the Little Qiong Peak among her Master\u2019s generation. Her Master also had a Senior Sister. Li Changshou and Lan Ling\u2019e should have had an Uncle-Master.Qi Yuan and his Senior Sister, Li Changshou\u2019s Uncle-Master, were childhood friends.However, before his Master was ambushed, this Uncle-Master left the sect. He said that he went to look for Grandmaster, but just like Grandmaster, he never returned\u2026He did not know what had happened.Come to think of it, was it really okay for a disciple of the Ren School to be so unruly?Had the Immortal Du Sect been set up?Could it be that someone had gotten the Moon Elder[1], who was not regarded highly by anyone in the Heavenly Courts, to give their disciples a random bunch of red threads?The three schools of the Dao Sect analyzed the situation carefully. In fact, each of them had their own shortcomings.Most of the Immortals of the Chan School were scheming and they made people feel that they were calculative.Jie School had a mixture of good and bad people; their rules were not strict. It gave people a sense of disharmony.On the other hand, the Ren School, supposedly free from karma and that had few Dao regulations, started behaving as if they had fallen under a spell. They began a trend of finding themselves a Dao companion, among themselves!If within the Sect there were things like \u2018Yin Yang Sky-Refining Mantra\u2019, \u2018Gathering Heart Technique\u2019, \u2018Wolf Like Tiger Chant\u2019, and \u2018Too Difficult to be Single Curse\u2019, that would have been reasonable.However, given this atmosphere in the Immortal Du Sect, which had adopted the Inaction Sutra as their core path\u2026Shouldn\u2019t the normal way of life involve cultivating peacefully on one\u2019s own peak and to avoid all karma, and finding something like managing the sect a very troublesome chore?\u201cIf ever given a chance, we should investigate Ren School\u2019s religious teachings in the Central Deity Continent and see if they share similarities.\u201dLi Changshou mumbled to himself and took note of this matter.Of course, he could not care too much about others. It was good enough that he could take care of himself and not stir these troubles.It was necessary to take a long term view on his Master\u2019s matter. However, now that he had a clue, there was no need for him to rely on blind guesses.If his master really had such a deadly enemy, he, as a disciple, would have to plan well.Avoiding karma is not fear of karma;Li Changshou had been plotting this for many years.The other party\u2019s cultivation level was about the same as his Master\u2019s a thousand years ago.He had heard that the person with the best potential in his Master\u2019s generation was Martial Aunt Jiu Jiu\u2026For now, he would treat his Master\u2019s enemy as a late-stage Perfected Immortal. If he hid his cultivation base, he would be a Heavenly Immortal.Now, as long as he could obtain powerful poisonous herbs, he could refine some pills that could kill Heavenly Immortals\u2026In the future, he would prepare hundreds of millions of these pills and poisonous powders for his Master to protect himself. When the time was right, he would let his master deliberately act more lively. If the other party could not help but attack his master again, he would let his master retaliate. That way, he would be able to account to the sect\u2026The other party could very well have the backing of another peak in the sect. He still had to consider what to do next.His advantage lay in being in the \u2018shadow\u2019. Also, the other party probably looked down on their Little Qiong Peak.As for the level he wanted to achieve, it was all his Master\u2019s wish.If Master wanted to take revenge for what happened back then, as the eldest disciple, he would secretly help.If his Master was unwilling to take revenge, then he would do his small part as a disciple and destroy the other party\u2019s cultivation base.The other party had already become a Heaven Immortal, while his Master could only be a Turbid Immortal in the future.After careful assessment, he realized that his Master had suffered a loss.After all, he had lost his Uncle-Master\u2026Li Changshou did not want to avoid this karma and was willing to reveal part of his trump card.If he did not move, it would be fine; but if he did, he would make it impossible for the opponent to retaliate.He closed his eyes and continued to ponder.Gradually, the array formations outside the Pill Chamber were activated.Little Qiong Peak, which had been silent for more than three years, began to gather Primordial Energy once again\u2026After Ling\u2019e copied the \u2018Steadiness Sutra\u2019 three hundred times, she went to Little Spirit Peak to apologize to Liu Yan\u2019er and asked for forgiveness.When Ling\u2019e arrived at the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou reprimanded her a few more times. He gave her the second version of the Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra and taught her two days of cultivation homework. The punishment for her not leaving the Little Qiong Peak for twenty years had officially begun.\u201cI hope you have taken heed, where this matter is concerned.\u201d\u201cI understand, Senior Brother.\u201d Ling\u2019e bit her lips. \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll copy the scriptures every day.\u201dLi Changshou handed over a treasure pouch and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m strict with you. But you grew up in the sect, and also in an aristocratic family of the mortal world. You do not understand the difficulties of the world.\u201cLet me tell you about this trip. I\u2026 Forget it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Ling\u2019e blinked, her eyes filled with curiosity. \u201cSenior Brother, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dLi Changshou stood with his hands behind his back. He looked up slightly and smiled bitterly. \u201cGo back and cultivate\u2026 Ling\u2019e?\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cHurry up and cultivate. Don\u2019t think about other things.\u201cYou must strive to reach the fifth-stage of the Dao Requital Realm before the next grand ceremony, so that you\u2019ll be valued by the sect.\u201dLi Changshou rubbed his eyebrows and sighed softly. \u201cThis way, even if I were to disappear on that day, you will still be taken care of by the sect to cultivate.\u201dLing\u2019e asked softly, \u201cSenior Brother, are you\u2026 running away?\u201d\u201cWhy should I run away? Go back and rest. I\u2019m going to start refining pills.\u201dLi Changshou chuckled. Ling\u2019e was puzzled.When she came out of the Pill Chamber, Ling\u2019e tilted her head and thought for a while. Then, she turned to look at the Pill Chamber\u2026Why did it feel like her Senior Brother was a little strange?In the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou started refining pills skillfully. He refined the \u201cclarifying\u201d immortal pill for his Master. The materials he used were not poisonous, so he did not need to wear a safety suit.Once the fire in the furnace stabilized, Li Changshou started to think about another important matter.Money.\u201cLittle Qiong Peak, Little Qiong Peak. I am truly crazy poor.\u201dHe needed a large amount of precious materials and spirit stones. Otherwise, he would not be able to do anything.He wasn\u2019t looking to make a fortune. He only wanted to have a stable source of income outside the monthly allowance of a disciple.In the mountains\u2026Cough. In the mountains, safety is one of the great benefits. But one of the disadvantages is that I can\u2019t get any precious materials or spirit stones.Could those idols at the South Sea be disguised as offerings harvesting machinery and sold to the Western School?Forget it. It would be akin to seeking death if he did this, and he\u2019d have to avoid the South Sea for the rest of his life.How was he going to make money?The most beneficial thing to me now is, one, to access the Dao Repository accessible only to the Sect\u2019s Immortals.Secondly, I need to do some subcontract work, making pills for the sect, so that I can earn some extra money and use the pill-concocting as an excuse to obtain some herbs. This also brings a considerable amount of benefits.He did not need to spend too much time in isolation for the next few decades. Although he had accepted the enlightenment of his ascension, he had yet to fully digest it. It would not be a problem for him to take out a few hours to refine pills every day.There were also people from the various peaks who could carry out tasks such as contract pill refining. They only needed to register at Bai Fan Hall, which would then assign the jobs.However, he had to plan this properly with his master. He could not take on the Immortal Pill assignment on his own.Why not choose Martial-Uncle Jiu Jiu to collaborate?It was not that he could not trust Uncle-Master Jiu Jiu. She was currently in seclusion, and she did not know much about pills. Furthermore, she was too high-profiled in the sect, so it was easier for people to suspect her.Moreover, if Master were to become active, he could also lure his past enemy to surface, killing many birds with one stone.Li Changshou rubbed his chin and pondered for a while. When he saw that the fire in the cauldron was unstable, he casually threw a wisp of True Flames over.Then he suddenly froze.Did I\u2026 use my true strength, the True Samadhi Flames just now?Crack, crack\u2026Boom!The Pill Chamber trembled violently, and the roof was instantly sent flying!After a while, Li Changshou, whose face was charred black, opened his mouth. He was speechless. He felt bitter in his heart.Looking at the pile of metal lumps that looked like blooming lotus flowers, he thought about himself, the intense effort that he had put in to repair the Elixir Furnace\u2026Ha, hehe\u2026Indeed, it was faster to earn money by trading joss sticks and incense oil with the Western School\u2026\u201cWe solemnly promise that we will not produce incense. We are just porters for incense offerings\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s really the Little Poor Peak. I\u2019m even poorer now.\u201dLi Changshou was amused by himself. He smiled and shook his head. Then, he got up and started to pack up the ruined cauldron.Fortunately, it was just a wisp of True Samadhi Flames. If he had thrown a mass of it, the Pill Chamber could have been razed to the ground and would have had to be rebuilt tomorrow.\u2026At the place where the clouds in the sky disappeared, and the Immortal Island connected to the Cloud Galaxy Ring.The Heavenly Courts, which had been established not long ago, were floating in the middle of the Central Deity Continent, suppressing the Primordial Destiny.At present, the Heavenly Courts were somewhat deserted. The five Heavenly Gates that led to the five continents each had their own soldiers. However, the well-situated grounds of the Heavenly Courts and the NIne-layered Celestial Palace were barren.If not for the fact that the Grand Pure One had created an incarnation to become the Grand Supreme Elder when the Heavenly Courts had just been established, and used this to protect the Heavenly Courts and the Jade Emperor\u2026Perhaps the huge Heavenly Court would have been captured by those ambitious old demons by now.The Ninth-Heaven of the Heavenly Court\u2019s Honorable Dao Sect was a Dao Cultivation Ground reserved for the Three Pure Ones. Immortal light could be seen in it, but there was only a small Dao Temple. It was the place where the Grand Pure One\u2019s father cultivated daily.The Lingxiao Treasure Hall was located on the 8th Heaven. It was magnificent and glorious, but it did not have much of a presence in the primordial times.In the surroundings of the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, there were many garrisons. As the Jade Emperor\u2019s Dao Ancestor, Hong Jun, who had been serving Lord of August Heaven Hao Tian for tens of thousands of years, he was obviously worried about his own safety.Within the Seventh Heaven, there were many \u201cdepartments of Foreign Affairs\u201d of the Heavenly Courts, as well as the immortals\u2019 residences. This was also the seat of the Tushita Palace.On the 7th Heaven, in an inconspicuous corner, an elegant immortal palace was built on an immortal island. The immortal island floated in a sea of clouds\u2026The most eye-catching thing about this immortal palace was not its architectural style, but the red silks hanging everywhere.Could it be, there was a marriage of immortals in the Heavenly Courts?However, that was not the case. This was the place where the Heavenly Courts oversaw all weddings in the Three Realms. There was a plaque with gold and jade embedded on it.[Marriages of Heaven and Earth]Moon Elder\u2019s palace.[1] In Chinese mythology, the god of marriage and love is Yue Lao, or the \u201cMoon Elder\u201d. A divine matchmaker, he pairs up couples using a read thread.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He drank the tea that the young boy had brought over and wiped the sweat off his forehead.He had just dealt with a Heavenly General who had insisted on being match-made with a fairy from the Jade Pool with his help.Can this match be made so casually?Even though he was the Moon Elder, he was not to manipulate the fate of others.Although there were in fact, many ways to do it in secret, it still depended on who the person being match-made was!Elder Yue had spent a lot of effort to deceive and lure away the Heavenly General. He was so tired that he was sweating profusely.He wished to reject her without making her unhappy. Furthermore, he could not afford to offend the person he liked\u2026Elder Yue\u2019s task was really too difficult.Most marriages were formed naturally, while a small number was bestowed by the heavens.As a Moon Elder, he indeed had some rights to make changes. However, the pair of golden scissors and the red string were treasures of the Heavenly merit. They could not be used recklessly!Even if it was just a marriage between a pair of mortals, mishandling would not only damage the merit that he had worked hard to accumulate, also cause him to be punished by the Jade Emperor, who was serious, responsible, and hardworking\u2026What were naturally-formed marriages?In the apse, there was a mysterious universe that was almost endless and contained countless tiny clay figurines. It was mandatory for all living beings in the world to be married. There were respective clay figurines for each of the three marriages of the Heaven, Earth, and Man.Marriage was a mandatory rite of passage.The clay figurines mostly corresponded to humans and only a small number corresponded to demons and witches.When they interact in the mortal world, the clay figurines in the apse would approach each other. Then, there would be a red string emerging from each of them. After the two red strings intertwined, a marriage would be formed.Love develops over time as red strings move and intertwine gradually.It was love at first sight. He only touched it lightly and wrapped it around the red string.Occasionally, some clay figurines would drift in the wrong direction, and the red strings would get entangled with that of other marriages. There would naturally be an intervention in the affected marriage\u2026What was a marriage bestowed by the heavens?When a living being was born and detected, clay figurines would form and be bound by the red string of fate. That was the marriage bestowed by the heavens.Other than that, there were also some people who were naturally \u201crebellious\u201d. They would break free from the red string of their marriage and drag half of it around.Occasionally, they would encounter clay figurines that were in the same situation. When the red strings were tied together, there would be burning passion, and when they were broken, all fate would be severed.The Heavenly General\u2019s request was not difficult for the Moon Elder.All he had to do was tie the Heavenly General\u2019s red string to that fairy. Even if it resulted in a marriage, there would not be any negative karma.However, the Moon Elder had to consider the Jade Pool fairy\u2019s background.Hundreds of years ago, the Queen Mother had already sent people to reprimand him. Now, he dared not do anything to the Jade Pool fairy that would violate the rules.Elder Yue was originally just a Heaven Immortal cultivator. However, he was amongst the first batch of Immortals to join the newly formed Heavenly Courts. He was upright and serious when it came to working. Ten thousand years ago, the Jade Emperor bestowed him the position of the Moon Elder.After assuming the position of the Moon Elder for ten thousand years, he experienced many benefits from it. For that, he had been conscientious and did not dare to slack off.However, the problem was that more and more Immortals of the Heavenly Courts had learned about the secret of the red string of Fate. They also knew that the Moon Elder could change it.There were people sneaking into the tiny Hall of Marriage every few days\u2026Some of them were officials from the same Hall and it was indeed inexorable.Some of them wanted to try and get his help by sending him gifts, but the Moon Elder did not accept any of them\u2026 What kind of gift would be more valuable than the rewards given by the Heavenly Courts?However, there was another situation where the Moon Elder could not and did not dare to reject the powerful old Daoist priests who had strong backgrounds. In front of big shots like them, he was just an insignificant immortal. For example\u2026\u201cMaster!\u201dOutside the hall, two young boys with braids scurried in gleefully and yelled,\u201cThe Great Daoist Master is here! He\u2019s almost reaching the front of the hall!\u201dThe Moon Elder shocked. He quickly got up and strode towards the front of the hall.The Great Daoist Master was an impressive figure. He was the only personal disciple of the Grand Pure One, the master of the Ren Sect. His Dao was unfathomable, and his backer was the Grand Pure One!Due to the fact that he was the senior of the Three Pure Ones, the first disciple of Chan Sect, Guang Chengzi of the Yuxu Palace, and the eldest disciple of Jie Sect, all addressed the Great Daoist Master as their senior even though he had entered the small courtyard of Kunlun Mountain a little later.He was the eldest Senior Apprentice of the True Dao Sect.The Great Daoist Master did not have a clear Dao name because the Grand Pure One had not given him one, lest he accumulated any bad karma.Due to the fact that he was known as the Great Daoist Master in Xuandu Temple that was led by the Grand Pure One, he gradually assumed that name over time\u2026Great Daoist Master Xuan Du of Xuandu Temple!Since then, the word Xuandu could be used to refer to him, the first disciple of the Ren Sect, or the location.Moon Elder knew clearly that the first disciple of Ren Sect was completely different from the few registered disciples of the Grand Pure One!Due to the fact that the Heavenly Courts had just risen and were still rather weak, the Venerable One of Xuandu Temple had been temporarily staying in Tushita\u2026After all, if any troublemakers from Zenith Heaven or Golden Immortals were to create trouble in the Heavenly Courts, it would not be appropriate for the Saints to personally deal with them. Xuan Du would just have to destroy them.That Venerable One had visited the Moon Elder several times and the latter naturally understood what he wanted.The Moon Elder quickly walked out of the hall and raised his head, only to see a young Daoist who drifted over from the clouds that were not too far away.He was dressed in a black Daoist robe and although his features were unclear, he seemed rather decent.He was standing tall and upright, while his robe swayed gently. There was not a single piece of jade accessory on his body. However, he gave off a genuine vibe that was like a piece of unpolished jade. It was an aura that could only be possessed by someone with extremely profound Dao.It was said that the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du was the first batch of humans in the world. He had no parents and was created by Lady Nuwa. He had some merits that were gained from creating humans, and the luck of joining Ren Sect.Before he reached the hall, the Great Daoist Master cupped his hands and bowed to the Moon Elder. He smiled and asked, \u201cHow have you been?\u201d\u201cGood, I\u2019ve been well.\u201dThe Moon Elder nodded repeatedly. If others did not know, they would have thought that the Heavenly Courts\u2019 immortal was a hunchback.\u201cGreat Daoist Master, please come in\u2026 or would you like to repeat the previous practice?\u201d\u201cThank you, Moon Elder.\u201d The Great Daoist Master Xuan Du smiled warmly and entered the Moon Elder\u2019s hall, after which he followed the Moon Elder to the apse.Once they entered the apse, they saw a mysterious starry sky ahead.The Moon Elder held onto a basin and swirled it gently, after which a ray of starlight flew across the starry sky and stopped, hovering in front of the two of them.That scene was actually a Postnatal Merit Numinous Treasure\u2014the Acacia Tree.As the starlight faded, five heaps of clay figurines were formed. The clay figurines of each heap were of different sizes, and on each of them were several words condensed from starlight. They were divided into different categories.For example, the ones from the leftmost heap had the words \u201cImmortal Du Sect\u201d written on them.The other piles had the words \u2018Unfettered Immortals\u2019 and \u2018Unfettered Sect\u2019 written on them. In fact, they were the Dao bearings of the Ren Sect.Xuan Du sighed softly and smiled. \u201cHow many couples have you brought together in the last thousand years?\u201dThe Moon Elder lowered his head and said, \u201cAccording to your instructions, I matchmake every couple that I discover share some affinity with each other.\u201d\u201cOver the past thousand years, a total of 362 pairs of clay figurines have been made.\u201dThe Great Daoist Master Xuan Du nodded and said warmly, \u201cWell, not bad. How many newlyweds have given birth to offspring?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 You have to go to Hell to check on that from the register. We only deal with matters regarding marriage here.\u201dXuan Du could not help but laugh. He liked to squint his eyes when he smiled, and his smile was rather warm.\u201cI forgot about this matter. Moon Elder, don\u2019t blame me.\u201dHe continued with a sigh, \u201cTeacher has really given me a difficult task. He wants the Ren Sect to flourish, but he wouldn\u2019t let me accept any disciples\u2026\u201dXuan Du placed his hands behind his back and sighed. He scanned the surroundings and said, \u201cWe can only resort to this. Moon Elder, could you show me the number of marriages that have been sealed recently?\u201d\u201cYes, Great Daoist Master, please wait a moment.\u201dThe basin in Elder Yue\u2019s hand was swirled once again. Soon, dozens of clay figurines flew forward. The distance between the clay figurines varied according to the closeness of their respective relationships and the possibility of a marriage between them.Every clay figurine had one or two red strings while some had three or four, but there wouldn\u2019t be too many.Those who were more sentimental and had longer relationships would have long red strings.Those who had shorter relationships would have shorter red strings.Soon, Xuan Du\u2019s attention was caught by the four clay figurines that were leaning against each other. He took two steps forward and looked at the four clay figurines that were below \u201cImmortal Du Sect\u201d.The Moon Elder smiled and said, \u201cThis is the power of the Three Stars surrounding the moon. They are very blessed.\u201dGreat Daoist Master Xuan Du nodded his head gently and stared at them for a while.\u201cGreat Daoist Master, look, there are fine red threads on his wrist and ankles. However, there is a thread emerging from the red string\u2026\u201d\u201cSome people are like this. This person must have been dedicated to cultivating his Dao and did not want to interfere with the matters of the world.\u201d\u201cWhat a waste.\u201d Xuan Du looked at the three red strings hovering around the clay figurines and smiled. \u201cMoon Elder, can you help him lengthen the red string so that it can be connected with the three other red strings on him?\u201d\u201cOf course I can. However, Great Mage, we can only help. It\u2019s not easy to change it\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let nature take its course. At the same time, I\u2019ll give some help.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019ll do it right now.\u201dAt that moment, the Moon Elder immediately raised the potted Acacia Tree and tipped it towards the clay figurine gently.At the same time, in the Pill Chamber of the Little Qiong Peak of the Immortal Du Sect of Dongsheng Immortal Region, Li Changshou, who had just taken a shower and was worrying about the new Pill Furnace, suddenly developed inappropriate thoughts.\u201cEh?\u201dLi Changshou chuckled and dispelled the image in his heart.In the apse of the Moon Elder Hall, the Acacia Tree was slowly tapped against the clay figurine which then took a step back out of nowhere\u2026He took a step back.\u201cHuh?\u201dMoon Elder frowned and changed the direction. He carried the small potted Acacia Tree and continued to poke the clay figurine.In the Pill Chamber of Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou\u2019s mind was filled with images, which were all a combination of the past and the present. For example, there were images of his Uncle-Master in a sailor suit, his female junior in a student attire, and\u2026Uh, why would I fantasize about being poisoned while wearing a Mecha?\u201cThe Dao Heart is solid, and illusions cannot destroy it!\u201dLi Changshou shook his head and continued thinking about the new Pill Furnace.In the Moon Elder Hall, the Acacia Tree caused the clay figurine to tilt towards the left.\u201cHey! I will!\u201dMoon Elder\u2019s eyes widened and he grabbed the Acacia Tree before changing directions again. He pointed it at the clay figurine and this time, the clay figurine\u2026 did a backflip and dodged nimbly.\u201cHahaha!\u201dThe Grandmaster Xuan Du could not help but laugh out loud.Moon Elder\u2019s expression immediately grew sullen. He had actually made a fool of himself in front of the Great Daoist Master over a trivial matter!\u201cBig!\u201dThe Moon Elder touched the Acacia Tree which expanded instantly, while its branches and leaves rushed towards the clay figurine.Li Changshou, who was on the ground, frowned. A beautiful Pill Furnace appeared in his mind. When the Pill Furnace opened, a few figures flew out\u2026Li Changshou sat down cross-legged and began to chant the Qi Condensation Curse.What a joke. He had never seen anything as such in his previous life.Perhaps, his mental state became unstable after he became an immortal, so much so that he kept thinking about random things.What was the point of a fleeting moment of pleasure?At the very least, he had to obtain immortality before thinking about such things! That would be being eternally shameless!No, being immortal might not be able to allow him to protect himself\u2026 He could not afford to offend the affinity of marriage, which was dispensable.Li Changshou hollered, \u201cQuiet!\u201dThe clay figurine in the Moon Elder Hall immediately sensed something and reacted.It retreated\u2026Dodged\u2026Leaped\u2026It jumped left and right\u2026Revolved\u2026It allowed the leaves of the Acacia Tree to sweep over freely, for they would not touch it.The Moon Elder was so anxious that his forehead was full of sweat. He was almost infuriated to the point that his aura surged.The Great Daoist Master who was standing at the side smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, Moon Elder.\u201dAt that moment, his left hand glowed with starlight while Yin and Yang appeared in his palm. He then grabbed at the clay figurine that was far away.Elder Yue\u2019s eyes widened. Just as he was about to shout \u2018No\u2019, the Great Mage grabbed the clay figurine\u2019s left arm.However\u2026Crack!The clay figurine\u2019s left arm was broken in an instant, and its body jumped out nimbly. After it stopped, it even posed provocatively, seemingly taunting them to come forward.The entire scene was dead silent.\u201cGreat Daoist Master\u2026 you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t force yourself\u2026\u201d\u201cAhem, can I make up for this?\u201d\u201cYes, you can. However, it will take a lot of time. Fortunately, he doesn\u2019t have any red string on his left arm. It will be easier to repair it\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you then, Moon Elder.\u201d\u201cGo ahead and get busy, Moon Elder. I\u2019ll come back later and bring you some pills that have been formulated\u2026 Please take care of this kid, thank you!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Great Daoist Master Xuan Du hurriedly bowed and left. He disappeared quickly, leaving the Moon Elder to deal with the mess.A moment ago, in the Pill Room of the Immortal Du Sect.Li Changshou frowned as his heart was in chaos.He shook his head helplessly and reached into his breast pocket, and into the No. 6 Earth Treasure Bag, after which he took out one of his trump cards that would calm his mind.A scroll was slowly unrolled, revealing the painting of a row of exquisitely drawn\u2026 old women who were wearing thick makeup, and fairy clothing\u2026Li Changshou looked at it carefully and mumbled, \u201cIf your feelings are genuine, you won\u2019t just lust over the beauty that she had when she was young, but also accept her nagging when she gets old. \u201dInstantly, the images in his mind were shattered one by one, and he felt at ease.\u201cHowever, why would immortals grow old?\u201dHe smiled conceitedly and put away the precious painting of \u201cAged Beauties\u201d. He was instantly much more at ease.Men should be more ruthless to themselves.It was one thing for him to think of his female junior and Uncle-Master by chance at times, but why did he think of poison?Tsk, it\u2019s toxic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhy is my left armpit so itchy recently?While refining pills, Li Changshou stretched his left arm and frowned slightly.He now had an immortal body. He was as pure as jade from the inside out.How could someone as pure as him suddenly\u2026 feel an itch in his armpit?It was not a trivial matter, but Li Changshou did not find anything wrong with himself after checking for half a month.Could it be the after-effects of Heaven\u2019s Punishment? That shouldn\u2019t be the case.After thinking about it, he could only boil it down to his immortal body still being imperfect. He had to slowly consolidate his cultivation level.After he ascended, Li Changshou felt that his mentality had changed slightly. Although the change was not obvious, he was still a little more confident.As a result\u2026 he even dared to gain enlightenment of the Dao in the Pill Chamber!Sigh, I should be more careful.Let\u2019s follow the old rules and strengthen a small realm before going on to the next realm.At present, he still had a very long lifespan and the Great God-Conferment Tribulation was also very far away. There was no need to be too anxious.Only by stabilizing his foundations and strengthening his immortal foundation would he be able to learn about the path towards immortality. Only then would he be strong enough to protect his own life in the future.His immortal sense allowed him to sense that Fairy had flown over from the straw hut. Li Changshou closed some of the array formations and allowed her to reach the Pill Chamber without any obstructions.Soon, Fairy jumped from the cloud to the Pill Chamber.\u201cSenior! Are you\u2026 roasting your hand?\u201d\u201cRoasting my hand? This is alchemy.\u201dIn the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou turned around and moved away to reveal the three-foot-tall pocket-sized pill furnace.The blue fairy blinked as she held onto the food container. She looked at the Pill Chamber that had become much more spacious and the small three-foot-tall Pill Furnace on the ground. She then drew the outline of a larger Pill Furnace with her finger\u2026\u201cWhat about the bigger one?\u201d\u201cIt blew up half a month ago.\u201d Li Changshou lowered his head and sighed. He carefully controlled the fire of the small Pill Furnace.There were no restrictions or array formations for the Pill Furnace, nor were there any methods for the flames in the Pill Furnace to be stabilized. It had become as troublesome as it used to many years ago, and he needed to constantly control the fire. Some elixirs could not be refined either.\u201cSenior Brother, you have to be careful when refining pills. Is this also that dangerous?\u201dThe blue fairy was a little worried as she gave him a reminder. She carried the dark purple, hollowed-out phoenix food container and placed it on a short table beside her.She looked up and saw that the roof seemed to have been replaced tooShe got busy at the side and put the two tables together, before activating simple restrictions on the table. Then, she took out the delicacies she had just prepared and slowly laid them on the table.When Li Changshou was not in the mountains, the blue fairy would be wearing her same few loose-fit training suits most of the time.When he was around, she would definitely change into beautiful fairy dresses even if she wouldn\u2019t be seeing him for a few days. Occasionally, she would fill her eyebrows in and put on some lipstick\u2026\u201cSenior, are you still going to invite Uncle-Master Jiu Wu this time?\u201d\u201cYes, Uncle-Master Jiu Wu sent me a letter via a paper crane yesterday. He said that he wanted to come and talk to me about something today.\u201dLi Changshou took a deep breath. The flames in the Pill Furnace gradually subsided, and the medicinal pills began to emit a medicinal fragrance.Thinking about how he had fooled Jiu Wu a few years ago and made him take those oaths, Li Changshou smiled.He thought I shall treat this banquet as an apology to Uncle-Master Jiu Wu.After laying out the dishes and warming the wine, the blue fairy looked at the pouch hanging on her waist and giggled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d While waiting for the pill to be ready, Li Changshou asked casually, \u201cYou\u2019ve recovered so quickly? It seems that you have forgotten the lesson from last time.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t! I definitely didn\u2019t!\u201dThe blue fairy quickly frowned and put on a look of distress. She lamented, \u201cSenior Brother, it was my fault for making you angry previously\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cWhat did you make for me? Take it out.\u201dFairy\u2019s eyes lit up, and she said gleefully, \u201cHehe, Senior, you\u2019ve indeed peeked at me!\u201dLi Changshou said helplessly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to peek. I can easily guess what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Fairy was a little disappointed. She tossed the pouch at him and walked out of the door with pursed lips.\u201cStinky Senior, here\u2019s the robe I made for you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going back to cultivate. I\u2019ll come back later to clean up the dishes!\u201dLi Changshou caught the pouch and looked inside. When he saw that it was an ordinary, dark-green-colored robe, he put on a satisfied smile.Indeed, nurturing and grooming his female junior was not a waste of effort\u2026He was very satisfied with the robe.Sitting on the rocking chair outside the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou waited quietly for Jiu Wu to arrive. He closed his eyes and pondered over the divine powers and mystical abilities.Soon, a short Daoist appeared outside the Little Qiong Peak.Li Changshou stood up and welcomed him. He closed the array formation around him and bowed to his Uncle-Master. Everything was the same as before.However, this time, the short Daoist walked a few rounds around the place and finally landed far away from him. He looked around while keeping his hands behind his back.His gaze was filled with vigilance.Li Changshou smiled without saying a word. He stood quietly by the door and waited. When he saw his Uncle-Master walking over, he did not say anything.The two of them looked at each other and smiled when they were 30 feet away.\u201cAhem!\u201dJiu Wu coughed lightly and said indifferently, \u201cWhy? Do you not need me to guide you in setting up array formations this time?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare in advance. Uncle-Master, when you said that you would be coming, I asked Junior Sister to make some dishes and wine. Uncle-Master, if you\u2019d like to guide me in array formation cultivation, I do have some doubts.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Jiu Wu immediately shook his head and declined, \u201cI\u2019m old and I can\u2019t guide you, I can\u2019t anymore.\u201d\u201cUncle-Master, your attainment in array formations is far beyond what I can achieve.\u201dLi Changshou continued with a serious expression, \u201cI\u2019ve only developed some new ideas in some insignificant aspects. If I really want to set up a powerful array, I will need an immortal like you, who is truly good at array formations and has a high cultivation level, as well as sufficient materials.\u201dJiu Wu raised his thick eyebrows and smiled.\u201cAre you not going to leave a Shadow Sphere for me this time?\u201dLi Changshou shook his head with a smile. Just as he was about to turn around and invite his Uncle-Master into the room, Jiu Wu smiled smugly and took out from his Daoist robe\u2026two fist-sized glass spheres.\u201cHeh-heh, I brought some!\u201dLi Changshou was rendered speechless.\u201cAs long as you\u2019re happy, Uncle-Master.\u201d Li Changshou made an inviting gesture and said, \u201cI have nothing to ask of you this time. I just want to listen to your teachings. Please come in.\u201dThus, he took his time to inspect and scrutinize.Jiu Wu noticed the changes in the Pill Furnace. He could not help but analyze in his head and speculate what kind of arrangement a small Pill Furnace would create.Finally, after much effort, Jiu Wu and Li Changshou sat down.Looking at the banquet in front of him\u2026Jiu Wu squinted and took out a rabbit, which was a spiritual beast, from his sleeve. Then, he started to feed the food to the rabbit.Li Changshou was also happy as he watched and waited quietly for Jiu Wu to finish.Finally, when Jiu Wu confirmed that Li Changshou did not spike the food today, he picked up a pair of jade chopsticks and cleared his throat. With a troubled expression, he said,\u201cYour Uncle-Master Jiu Shi has been in seclusion recently, in a bid to seek a breakthrough. Apprentice-Nephew\u2026 please don\u2019t say the same thing as you did previously.\u201dLi Changshou said, \u201cI can swear that at this moment, I sincerely want to invite you to drink and chat!\u201d\u201cIn that case, take an oath.\u201d Jiu Wu nodded. \u201cCome, hurry, and do it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just making a casual remark. If you really swear, wouldn\u2019t that mean that you really have a guilty conscience?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cUncle-Master, I would like to toast you.\u201dJiu Wu laughed. He raised his wine glass and tipped it towards Li Changshou from afar, but only took a sip.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about business before we drink.\u201d Jiu Wu said, \u201cThis time, according to the promise I made last time, I will discuss it with you in advance. If you agree to this, the sect will definitely reward you handsomely.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t agree, I\u2019ll pretend that I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Li Changshou pondered for a moment and understood what was going on. He continued, \u201cIf you want to promote the Chain Array in the sect, you don\u2019t have to ask me.\u201dJiu Wu frowned. \u201cHow did you know? I didn\u2019t mention this to anyone!\u201d\u201cI guessed it.\u201d Li Changshou picked up a mouthful of the spiritual fish that his junior sister had cooked. The white and tender fish melted in his mouth, and it was sweet and fragrant. The aftertaste lingered on his lips and teeth.\u201cSo you agree?\u201d Jiu Wu smiled. \u201cCome, tell me. How did you set up the Chain Array?\u201dSo he did not understand\u2026Li Changshou said, \u201cActually, I\u2019ve read about it briefly in the ancient books and made a summary.\u201dLi Changshou took out a sheepskin scroll immediately.Of course, he would not reveal his trump card so easily.What he was revealing now was actually just a theoretical plan that was used to solve the key difficulty in forming the Chain Array formation\u2014the adaptability of different array formations.It was a solution that he developed in the earlier stage.There were also reference materials included, which were all ancient books that no one cared about and were hidden in the outer hall of the Dao Repository.The plan was completely different from the idea of the \u2018formation base unit\u2019 that he was currently using. The disadvantage was that it was a waste of materials, but it could also achieve the effect of setting up a Chain Array.On the first day that the array formations around the Pill Chamber had been set up, he had been waiting to reveal the sheepskin scroll. Today, he had finally \u2018got what he wanted\u2019.Jiu Wu grabbed it and read it carefully.After a while, the short Daoist could not help but slap his thigh and praise Li Changshou.\u201cI thought I would have to spend some effort to persuade you, but I didn\u2019t expect you to take it out so readily! I haven\u2019t thought so highly of you for nothing. I haven\u2019t thought so highly of you for nothing!\u201d\u201cCan you really offer this to the sect?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and nodded. He agreed, \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cAh, I never thought you would! I used my own standards to judge and misunderstood you. I even thought that you were the type to keep the good stuff to yourself!\u201dJiu Wu sighed with emotion. He picked up the wine glass and drank the wine in one gulp. \u201cI deserve punishment, I deserve punishment!\u201dLi Changshou said seriously, \u201cThe sect is my home, and its prosperity depends on everyone. Uncle-Master, um\u2026 what rewards can the sect give?\u201dJiu Wu smiled and said, \u201cWe will definitely not miss your portion out! What do you want?\u201d\u201cIf possible,\u201d Li Changshou said as he pointed at the Pill Furnace beside him.Jiu Wu was stunned at first, after which he nodded and agreed.He even said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t find the pill furnace that you like in the sect, I will ask your Uncle-Master Jiu Shi to make one for you when he comes out of seclusion!\u201d\u201cHis weapon refinement techniques are not comparable to the Heaven Immortal Elders in the sect but she is quite skilled!\u201dLi Changshou immediately smiled and toasted Jiu Wu.All of a sudden, everyone toasted. The two got along very well\u2026When they drank till they were slightly tipsy, Li Changshou suggested that they roast the rabbit that was used for taste-picking in the Pill Furnace, and they really proceeded to do so.It tasted pretty good.After drinking the wine, Jiu Wu returned and came to look for Li Changshou three days later. He then brought him to Pill Tripod Peak to select a new Pill Furnace.Pill Tripod Peak was a branch of the Immortal Du Sect that specialized in alchemy and weapon refinement. Although there were not many pills and Dharma treasures produced, they had quite a good reputation in the East Continent of Purvavideha, and were considered a rare highlight of the Immortal Du Sect.Li Changshou and Jiu Wu had just left the Little Qiong Peak when a beautiful figure flew over from the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Li Changshou frowned slightly when his immortal senses captured this beautiful figure.There was no need to take a closer look at her face. Just by looking at her slim and perfect figure, as well as the familiar red dress, he could tell who she was.Youqin Xuanya!On the Little Qiong Peak, Fairy was cultivating under a tree\u2026Li Changshou thought about it for a while and decided not to interfere. He continued to chat with his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu.The two shared similar interests when they were not plotting against each other.\u2026Under the willow tree, Youqin Xuanya stood quietly and explained her intentions.Although she wanted to go to the Little Qiong Peak to meet that Senior she could not show up there for no reason. After coming out of seclusion this time, she thought about it for a few days and nights before finally coming up with a solution.She decided to use the excuse of asking for some insights about Earth Escape cultivation.After saying this, Youqin Xuanya lowered her head and waited quietly. Deep down, she felt that her excuse was too far-fetched. She did not know if she could deceive him\u2026She heard some rustling sounds, but he did not hear Fairy\u2019s reply.Youqin Xuanya looked up and saw a stone slate with a few lines engraved on it:\u201cSenior has just gone out.\u201d\u201cI was punished by Senior so I cannot speak.\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, please go inside and wait for a while.\u201dThe fairy laughed in her head. She had promised her senior not to talk to strangers and she felt that Senior Sister Youqin could be considered a stranger even though they had slept together.She thought that if she said that, Senior Sister Youqin would definitely leave.\u201cGone out\u201d was actually a little vague. It was very easy for people to think that he had left the sect.\u201cThat\u2019s good too.\u201dAlso?\u201cSorry to disturb you, Junior Sister.\u201dYouqin Xuanya cupped her hands and bowed to Fairy before walking to the straw hut at the side.Fairy tilted her head. Just as she was about to speak, she could not help but smack her forehead\u2026This senior sister\u2026isn\u2019t toxic, is she?Don\u2019t you understand the ways of the world?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Secondly, he was interested in Wan Linyun, a master of concocting poisons.Most of the knowledge that Li Changshou had now about poison-refining theories and nearly half of his poison formulas were obtained from Wan Linyun.Wan Linyun was an Elder of the sect and a Heaven Immortal of Pill Tripod Peak who liked to refine and concoct poison. His competency could not be judged by his cultivation level or his Dharma treasures.When Li Changshou\u2019s Little Junior Sister went to the East Ocean to kill the prawn demons, Li Changshou considered using her poisonous powder to attract the attention of this elderAfter all, he was an expert in the sect. Although he had taken away the poisonous powder that Li Changshou had refined, he didn\u2019t do much afterward\u2026Li Changshou did not dare to take the initiative.As a disciple of the sect, he would definitely seem like a malicious person who was planning to murder his enemy, if he were to take the initiative to seek guidance from the elder who had the best poison-refining techniques in the sect.However, if an elder in the sect, who liked to refine poison, insisted on teaching his disciple how to refine poison, others would have a better impression of Li Changshou\u2026The slight difference between taking the initiative and being passive was obvious.When rushing to Pill Tripod Peak on a cloud with Jiu Wuyun, Li Changshou was deep in thought. It was not easy for him to get a chance to go to Pill Tripod Peak. He wondered if he should arrange for an \u201cencounter\u201d with that poison-refining master.He could not be too deliberate or too casual about it.It would be great if he could obtain some poisonous pills and Poison Sutra from Elder Wan Linyun. Even if he could only get some attention, it would be worth it.The white clouds passed through two mountains and Jiu Wu said smilingly with his hands behind his back, \u201cLook, that\u2019s Pill Tripod Peak.\u201dLi Changshou smiled and nodded. He looked at the wine pot-shaped mountain peak in front of him, his eyes filled with anticipation.Let\u2019s see if I can meet Senior Wan Linyun this time. Some things will be ruined if they\u2019re forced.There was a caster and an alchemist on Pill Tripod Peak.There were not many people who refined Qi on this peak\u2014 There were only a hundred-odd of them.There were three Immortal Elders, thirty-odd Perfected Immortals, Essence Immortals, and more than ten disciples. The rest were all disciples who performed miscellaneous chores.Li Changshou and Jiu Wu landed in the small courtyard on the mountainside of Pill Tripod Peak, where a handyman disciple led the way and served tea.Soon, a male Perfected Immortal dressed in a blue robe and a crown with an Eight Trigram arrived. He was slightly chubby and looked rather well-supplemented.He seemed to have\u2026 suffered the side effects of consuming too many pills.\u201cJunior Jiu Wu, why haven\u2019t you been visiting frequently in the past few years?\u201dJiu Wu sighed and said, \u201cSigh, I\u2019m always sent to travel around and I don\u2019t have time to rest at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because the people in the sect find you trustworthy, Junior!\u201d the round-faced Immortal said with a smile. He looked at Li Changshou and gestured for him to enter. \u201cThe Hundred Mortal Hall has already given me the order. There are a few Pill Furnaces that are free for use. I\u2019ll take you guys there to pick one out.\u201dLi Changshou stood behind Jiu Wu. Although he was much taller than his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu, he still looked rather insignificant.Jiu Wu also made an introduction for Li Changshou. The round-faced Immortal was called Liu Feixian. He was also an executive of the sect, just like Jiu Wu, and was usually in charge of handling the miscellaneous affairs of Pill Tripod Peak.Li Changshou bowed and addressed him as \u2018Uncle-Master\u2019. Liu Feixian smiled and gave Li Changshou some words of encouragement, after which he stopped talking.The three of them rode away from the small courtyard on the clouds and drifted towards a secluded valley.Liu Feixian and Jiu Wu chatted along the way. Li Changshou stood behind them and observed them instead of looking at the surrounding scenery.There was a huge array outside the secluded valley. It blocked the detection of immortal senses and had a certain protective effect.Inside the array formation, the fragrance of flowers wafted up into their noses and the sounds of birds drifted into their ears, while immortal light was emitted in all directions.There were dozens of houses that seemed to have decorated the forest. At that moment, most of them had activated the array formation outside the house. The immortals and disciples inside were probably cultivating.Laughter could be heard in the forest, along the path leading to the ethereal area.Compared to his Little Qiong Peak, the place was indeed\u2026 much more ostentatious.After following the two Perfected Immortals, they arrived at a large house that was covered by an array formation.Liu Feixian quickly closed the array formation and opened the door. There were thick layers of dust all over the place and a few ten-feet-tall Pill Furnaces were placed in a corner. There were also some other miscellaneous items.Li Changshou immediately selected one of the Pill Furnaces.The material of the Pill Furnace was not as good as that of the violet-gold one that he had repaired. However, it was a brand-new treasure which did not lack any of the necessary restrictions. The overall power of the Pill Furnace was slightly higher than the one in the blast furnace.This was not bad. After all, he was a disciple on Void Return, on the surface, and did not need an excellent Pill Furnace\u2026At the side, Jiu Wu smiled and chided, \u201cSenior Liu, aren\u2019t you being a little too stingy by giving me these Pill Furnaces? Apprentice-Nephew Changshou had contributed greatly this time. The sect has also decided to reward him by letting him come to Pill Tripod Peak to select a furnace. On the way here, I\u2019ve already gone all out and decided to be thick-skinned, so don\u2019t think of getting rid of him so easily!\u201dLiu Feixian\u2019s expression was slightly awkward. He quickly said, \u201cJunior, you should have said so earlier. Come, let\u2019s go to another place.\u201dLi Changshou thanked Jiu Wu from the bottom of his heart. Just as he was about to say that the furnaces there were good enough, he suddenly heard a soft gasp from outside.\u201cChangshou? Are you the disciple of Little Qiong Peak?\u201dJiu Wu was stunned and so was Liu Feixian but Li Changshou was delighted.A gust of breeze blew past, and a thin old man appeared outside the door with a walking stick.The walking stick was wrapped in a layer of bronze. The old man\u2019s wrinkled face was a little cold and austere, but his eyes were bright and energetic. His grayish-white hair fluttered in the wind, and the Daoist robe that he was wearing gave off a pungent smell\u2026Elder Wan Linyun!Liu Feixian and Jiu Wu hurriedly bowed.Jiu Wu quickly sent a voice transmission to Li Changshou. \u201cThis is the elder of Pill Tripod Peak! You can just call him Granduncle-Master.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Li Changshou, a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak. I hereby pay my respects to you, Granduncle-Master.\u201dThe old man nodded in response. The corners of his mouth quivered as he tried to put on\u2026 a sinister smile.Liu Feixian and Jiu Wu shuddered and subconsciously took two steps back.They wondered How did we offend this Poison Immortal who rarely goes out?Wan Linyun did not make any small talk. He pointed at Li Changshou and asked, \u201cHow do you refine the Fox Heart Pill?\u201dThe event that I foreshadowed years ago has finally happened!Li Changshou remained silent and thought about it for a while. He hung his head low and maintained his posture. His speech was clear but he was slightly nervous.He said, \u201cIn terms of the ratio of herbs, three portions of blood from the heart of the Spirit Fox, one portion of muddy grass, two portions of the honey-black Soul-Breaking Herb, one portion of Hongyu grass, a small portion of water, and a small amount of non-sooting powder\u2026 The Fox Heart Pill will be obtained after 12 hours of condensation with cold fire.\u201dElder Wan Linyun nodded slowly while the smile on his lips turned even more\u2026 frightening!\u201cIf I add two portions of withered orchid powder and refine it for 12 hours, what would I get?\u201dLi Changshou answered, \u201cThe Dark Fox Heart Pill.\u201d\u201cIf I remove the honey-black Soul-Breaking Herb, add three portions of Danyang Lotus Powder, two portions of Snow Sand, refine it for 24 hours with White Fire, what do I get?\u201dLi Changshou pondered for a while. This time, he took a little longer.Jiu Wu, who was standing at the side, immediately became anxious. He shot Liu Fei a look.However, Liu Feixian kept shaking her head, hinting for Jiu Wu to not speak\u2026This elder could kill two Perfected Immortals effortlessly!Standing outside the door, Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s smile turned colder. He squinted slightly as his eyes glistened.Jiu Wu pondered over his words. He was not familiar with Wan Linyun, but judging from his expression\u2026No matter how he looked at it, it seemed like he was going to melt Li Changshou!However, Li Changshou replied, \u201cA useless pill.\u201dThe corners of Jiu Wu\u2019s mouth twitched, and he was about to beg for mercy.However, Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s smile disappeared at that moment. He looked serious and asked, \u201cWhy is it useless?\u201d\u201cThe medicinal properties have been neutralized.\u201d Li Changshou frowned and continued, \u201cThe White Fire was originally a gentle, and neutral fire. Now, the temperature in the pill is neutral, and the medicinal properties of the herbs are offset\u2026\u201cAlthough a pill can be formed, it will be useless.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Wan Linyun took half a step forward with his walking stick.Jiu Wu hurriedly stepped forward and bowed. \u201cElder, this young junior is highly regarded by my master. If I offend you, please forgive me on account of my master!\u201dWan Linyun glanced at the short Daoist Jiu Wu and remained silent. He continued looking at Li Changshou and asked, \u201cYou said medicinal properties, but these are obviously poisonous.\u201dLi Changshou had a slightly nervous expression. However, he lowered his head and bent down to say the words that he had been waiting to say for decades. Given the things that the Elder Wan Linyun had done in his life, he felt that the words he was going to say would most likely pierce Wan Linyun\u2019s heart.\u201cPoison is a type of medicine, just like how culinary dishes can be sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy. It\u2019s the same for herbs.\u201dEveryone in the house fell silent. Liu Feixian turned to glare at Li Changshou, his eyes filled with anxiety.What kind of nonsense was that?How can he classify poison and medicine as the same thing!?!The short Daoist, Jiu Wu, sensed that a pair of eyes was staring at him from above. He looked up and happened to see Wan Linyun\u2019s narrow eyes and\u2026 Wan Linyun sneered coldly.The elder said, \u201cCan I borrow him for a few days?\u201d\u201cPlease, go ahead.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wan Linyun nodded and said to Li Changshou, \u201cYou, follow me.\u201dLi Changshou lowered his head and acknowledged. After bowing to Jiu Wu and Liu Feixian, he slowly left the place and followed behind the elder.Before he could take more than ten steps, Elder Wan Linyun turned his head and asked, \u201cHow do you refine the Dark Jade Pill?\u201d\u201cI only know the remnant formula. The main ingredients are three portions of Nether Water and two Eagle Orchids that are between a thousand and three thousand years old\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do the Eagle Orchids have to be between a thousand to three thousand years old?\u201d\u201cEven if the medicinal properties don\u2019t clash with each other, they can\u2019t help but affect each other. If it\u2019s too old, the medicinal properties will be too strong. That would easily break the balance of the pills. I read a sutra that says that it\u2019s not true that the older the pill, the better. It\u2019s most important for it to be of an appropriate age.\u201d\u201cWhere did you see that sutra?\u201d\u201cIn the outer hall of the Dao Repository. There are a few bookshelves there that contain a lot of sutras regarding alchemy. I have read them carefully and pondered over many things\u2026 Could it be that you have written those sutras about poison?\u201d\u201cHehe, not bad.\u201dWhile they were chatting amidst the breeze, the two of them disappeared on a narrow road.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dJiu Wu heaved a sigh of relief and wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.The Heaven Immortal Elder did not show any signs of being a Heaven Immortal just now. However, the fact that he had poisoned a Heaven Immortal was really hair-raising\u2026The slightly chubby immortal came over and asked, \u201cWhere\u2026 is this junior from? I\u2019ve never seen such an amiable Uncle-Master before!\u201d\u201cYou call that amiable?\u201dJiu Wu glared at Liu Feixian and was about to reply when he suddenly thought of something and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I can\u2019t say anything.\u201dLiu Feixian tilted his head and frowned.\u2026Half a month later\u2026In the evening, Li Changshou rode on a white cloud and left Pill Tripod Peak calmly to head towards Little Qiong Peak.There were no hiccups along the way. When he returned to the Little Qiong Peak, Youqin Xuanya was already gone.Upon returning to the Pill Chamber, he took out a twenty-feet-tall black Pill Chamber from his Dharma treasure that doubled as a storage space. His expression did not change much.After he activated the various array formations around him, he switched the beams and used paper effigies to guard the place. He then entered the secret underground chamber and sat behind the desk with a stern expression.He brushed his left hand across the table and placed some jade pendants and jade bottles all over the table\u2026Li Changshou smiled and felt emotional.Finally, he had squeezed everything out of the Elder\u2019s\u2026 Poison Sutra!He even obtained a large number of poisonous pills from the elder!However, he also owed him a huge favor because of that. In the future, he had to find an opportunity to return the favor and sever the karma.Those poisonous scriptures were very important to Li Changshou.The poisonous pills that the Elder Wan Linyun had asked him to bring back as samples were even more important!That could solve a huge problem for Li Changshou\u2014 giving an explanation to the sect about where the poisonous pills that he might use, and could kill Heaven Immortals had come from!He could just say that they were given by Elder Wan Linyun.There was no such thing as a free-for-all opportunity in this world. It was nothing more than a plan that would span across years and decades.This toxic Immortal Elder\u2026The elder\u2019s signature cold smile appeared in Li Changshou\u2019s mind, and Li Changshou grinned widely.Actually, his personality was quite cute. He was focused on refining poisonous pills and wasn\u2019t too scheming.Suddenly, Li Changshou felt something\u2026 itching between his legs.It was similar to the itchiness that would often appear in his armpit lately.Hiss\u2026What the hell?Li Changshou tilted his head and quickly stopped thinking about the poison-refining elder. He carefully observed his condition and confirmed that there was no problem with his sexual orientation.He was shocked. He thought that he had suddenly developed some strange fetish after looking at the \u201cAged Beauties\u201d painting.Li Changshou frowned.What\u2019s wrong with me? My body has been behaving strangely lately.He felt that he had to strengthen his immortal foundation after becoming an immortal.\u2026A moment ago\u2026In the Moon Elder Hall of the Heavenly Courts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How would you know what love is!?!\u201dIn the front hall, a drunk Heavenly General was wailing.The Moon Elder looked extremely helpless and he could only say some comforting words, but he did not dare to agree and promise to help that Heavenly General get married.What had the Moon Elder not encountered in the past ten thousand years?He had been through many such situations.He could only comfort him continuously and try to knock some sense into him. He then contacted the other Heavenly Generals to get them to deal with this matter.Marriage Affinity mainly depended on one\u2019s own hard work. If he wanted to develop a romance with that fairy, he would have to think long and hard for a solution he could use to move her\u2026Before that, Elder Yue was repairing the clay figurine that Xuan Du had damaged.The clay figurine was formed from the power of the Heavenly Dao and hence constantly detected Heavenly Dao. Although it could be repaired, the process was very complicated.The main thing to do was to temporarily remove the clay figurine from the Wheel of Destiny. After the repairs were completed, he would put it back.Just a moment ago, the Moon Elder was about to finish the repairing process but the Heavenly General suddenly arrived and complained to him.Since the clay figurine could not be away from the Wheel of Marriage for too long, the Moon Elder handed over the last bit of the repair process, which was easy work, to his two disciples to handle.In the apse, the two boys carefully installed the clay figurine\u2019s new left arm and a wisp of mysterious Dao emanated from the clay figurine, causing the arm to instantly fuse and become one with its body.Then\u2026The younger boy pointed at the remaining clay on the table and asked softly, \u201cSenior, what should we do?\u201d\u201cOh no! I made a mistake at the shoulder! There\u2019s a small crack! Oh no, I can\u2019t stuff it in.\u201d\u201cIn this case, will Master punish us?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dThe older boy pondered for a moment and looked at the clay figurine in his hand. His eyes lit up.He discovered that the width of the bottom of the clay figurine was just right because his legs were slightly parted.The boys looked at each other, after which the two of them carefully placed the clay between the legs of the clay figurine together.After that, the older boy took out a small hairpin and used it to poke the clay inwards, creating a deeper indent.It was a success!As soon as the two boys were done with the mending, the drunk Heavenly General in the front hall was taken away by two of his friends.The Moon Elder walked over with his hands behind her back and asked in a gentle voice, \u201cHave the two of you mended the clay figurine?\u201d\u201cYes Master, we have mended it!\u201dThe Moon Elder grabbed the clay figurine and looked at it. He nodded in satisfaction and tossed two bottles of pills at his disciples.\u201cNot bad. Go to the front hall and cultivate.\u201dAfter saying that, the Moon Elder carried the clay figurine into the starry sky and gently pushed the clay figurines that had been summoned from the Immortal Du Sect backwards.The Wheel of Marriage appeared and the Great Dao wheel rotated.The male clay figurine slowly floated back to its original position and the three female clay figurines around it detected its movement. The three red strings slowly extended towards the clay figurine that had just returned.The Moon Elder heaved a sigh of relief. It was finally settled.He then noticed the clay figurine swaying its body to dodge an incoming red string.\u201cIs this fellow really dedicated to cultivating Dao?\u201dThe Moon Elder smiled and looked at the three red strings on the clay figurines which did not seem to have changed much.\u201cInteresting. It depends on how long you can hide. I can\u2019t force you on this matter. We have to bring couples together, we can\u2019t make things difficult for them.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, the male clay figurine gently avoided the other red string, after which the clay that the two boys had just stuck in between its legs slid off and floated in the sea of stars\u2026The Moon Elder was stunned for a moment and his face instantly stiffened. He tilted his head and looked at the male clay figurine that had just been repaired, only to see that it was surrounded by three other male clay figurines\u2026How\u2026 how could this happen? This had never happened before!Could this lad be any more ruthless?!No, this could be because some of the fragments were accidentally added to it when I was repairing the clay doll.Come to think of it\u2026The clay figurine is only a carrier of the red string. The main reason why the left arm is important is that it might produce a new red string of marriage\u2026The Great Daoist Master probably would not notice it\u2026This is a Heavenly Dao marriage clay figurine that has no other symbolic meaning. At most, there would be a subtle connection with the person but his body will not be affected\u2026Right?\u201cRemember to focus on this!\u201dThe warnings that the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du\u2019s had given when he left in a hurry were still ringing in his ears. The Moon Elder\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed and he hurriedly took a few steps forward and squeezed the speck of clay in the air with his hand.He crushed it, ground it into the powder, put it into his sleeve, and looked around. He then walked quickly to the clay figurine and studied it carefully. He carefully smeared the powder in his hand on the left shoulder of the figurine. It seemed that the amendments made were not perfect, and there was a tiny crack there\u2026\u201cNothing happened. Haha, nothing happened. The power of the Three Stars is a blessing! It\u2019s a huge blessing!\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 Hahaha\u2026\u201dThe two boys at the door quietly slipped away\u2026Not long after, the Moon Elder stood there with his hands clasped behind his back. He muttered, \u201cIf there are really any negative effects\u2026 it would be our fault. What should I do?\u201d\u2026In the secret underground chamber of Little Qiong Peak,Li Changshou sat cross-legged on the prayer mat and cultivated quietly. His body was like glass, and his immortal soul was unsullied. A ball of True Samadhi Flames slowly circulated in his body, illuminating his skin as though it was translucent. There was an immortal glow within.After checking carefully, he still did not find anything unusual about his body.He thought for a while and went into peaceful seclusion for a few months. He only relaxed a little when his small cultivation realm was almost perfected.There should be no problem.Although he had perfected his small realm, Li Changshou was not in a hurry to achieve breakthrough immediately. He followed his original plan and tried to gain enlightenment about the realm again.The first step was to learn new things through revision.The second step was to change one\u2019s perspective and verify the results of Dao before checking for mistakes and making up for them.The third step was to suppress one\u2019s cultivation level and strive for perfection.He had to repeat those three steps several times before he could minimize the probability of \u2018disruption\u2019. Only then would he be able to stabilize his realm.The primeval opportunity had been snatched away by the Connate pioneers. If he wanted to have the ability to protect himself in the future, he could only seek stability in the early, intermediate, and late stages, and then accumulate in the last stage.His ideas and train of thought had always been clear.Most of the experts in the Primordial Times have already established their strength.What he wanted to pursue was the height that he could reach in the future. He did not want to fight for time.After being in seclusion for another half a year, Li Changshou finally confirmed that there was nothing wrong with his body. The itchiness in his body did not appear again.As he had ascended a while ago, he had already understood the first volume of the Inaction Sutra.However, he did not have the right opportunity to study the second volume of the Inaction Sutra. Furthermore, it was a taboo for him to cultivate the core cultivation techniques of his sect. There were also some risks involved.There was no wall in the world that was impenetrable.Putting aside the tricks and trump cards that Li Changshou had kept, his final amulet was actually to not violate the core rules of the Immortal Du Sect and harm the interests of the Immortal Du Sect.Let\u2019s take it slow.\u201cThe Inaction Sutra\u201d is vast and profound. There is a general outline in the first volume.He had to study it carefully and slowly understand the words, one by one. He would definitely gain something from doing so.Maybe he could come up with something new.After another hundred years, the immortal seedlings of the same generation as him in the sect would begin to undergo Tribulation Transcendence, one after another. He could also arrange for them to go out and \u201ccoincidentally\u201d transcend the Immortal Ascension Tribulation. By then, it would not be too late for him to cultivate the second volume of the Inaction Scripture.After returning to the Pill Chamber from the secret chamber, he put away the paper effigy that he had been working on for a long time. It was already realistic enough to be a clone.Li Changshou sat beside the Pill Furnace and began to refine it slowly.This Pill Furnace was called the Thousand Poisons Hundred Golden Furnace. It was a superior immortal treasure and the Pill Furnace that Elder Wan Linyun had kept as a spare.The furnace was forged with Hundred Refined Bright Fire Gold, and mixed with hundreds of precious materials. Even ordinary Golden Immortals would not blast it immediately to refine pills, much less a Heaven Immortal like Wan Linyun.Looking closely at the outer wall of the Pill Furnace, he realized that pure spiritual energy was flowing under the black metallic luster. There were hundreds of poisonous insects and twelve types of poisonous spiritual beasts carved on the surface of the Pill Furnace.However, the Pill Furnace did not have any poisonous corrosive properties. On the contrary, it could suppress the toxicity of the pill and increase its safety.Originally, Elder Wan Linyun wanted Li Changshou to take another Pill Furnace that was even more precious and could increase the rate of formation of the pills, as well as improve their quality. However, Li Changshou insisted on choosing this Pill Furnace that was used as a backup\u2026That made Elder Wan Linyun sigh.After all, the Primordial Times were far away and it was difficult to obtain treasures. Hence, treasures were more precious to most people who would defy rules for them.There were too few young people who would not be shaken by the treasures.However, Li Changshou was focused on safety,Li Changshou was very satisfied with the Pill Furnace after refining a furnace full of poisonous pills\u2026Next, he could discuss the plan to make money with his master.\u201cI\u2019ll have to let you use these small arrays to protect yourself first,\u201d Li Changshou muttered. \u201cOnce I have the precious materials, I\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re safe and sound here. No one will be able to bully you.\u201dThat Pill Furnace was not a spirit treasure. Naturally, it would not give him any response.It had been some time since he returned. It was time for him to pay a second visit to Elder Wan Linyun at the Pill Tripod Peak.He could not just disappear after receiving the benefits.Hmm\u2026 I\u2019ll go catch a few spiritual fish and get Fairy to prepare some dishes. I\u2019ll bring two jars of fine wine with me to visit him.As Li Changshou planned his agenda, he slowly walked out of the Pill Chamber and rode a cloud towards the straw hut.His immortal senses easily penetrated through the array formation around the Fairy\u2019s straw hut and he saw her leaning against the window and resting.Her black hair cascaded down her shoulders and waist. Her curvy figure that was hidden under her thin shirt was exquisite.If not for the occasional chuckling and the way she would address him as \u2018Senior\u2019, which would kill most of the mood, such a beautiful scene was enough to make one enthralled.On the stone slab beside her hand, there was an incomplete relief of Li Changshou riding on the clouds and returning\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re not cultivating properly.\u201dLi Changshou shook his head. However, he did not disturb Fairy. Instead, he rolled up his sleeves and went to the kitchen by the lake to start cooking.After being busy for four hours, he whipped up a scrumptious meal.During the first two years when Fairy had just arrived at the mountain, she was still a young girl who was used to living in luxury, could not bear the hardships in the mountain. Li Changshou\u2019s culinary skills had been honed at that time.After that, Li Changshou actively nurtured his junior\u2019s tenacious and hardworking spirit. After she abstained from eating, he had also imparted all his culinary skills to her.He placed the remaining dishes on the plate into two food containers, one of which he quietly placed beside his junior. He then placed the other in front of his master\u2019s door.Afterward, Li Changshou carried a few dishes and two jars of wine with him as he hovered at a suitable height. He avoided the busy Cloud Path and headed for Pill Tripod Peak.Not long after he left, Fairy\u2019s nose twitched slightly. She was attracted by the fragrance of the dishes and slowly opened her eyes.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe blue fairy licked her lips and she saw the food container beside her hand, as well as the bamboo piece on it.\u201cDon\u2019t slack off in cultivation. Only by working hard, can you reap the fruit of your labor and become immortal.\u201dFairy was stunned for a moment, after which she smiled happily.Senior had dropped by!He even cooked for me!Oh?That\u2019s abnormal.Fairy stood up instantly resting her right elbow on her left hand and pinching her smooth chin with her right hand. She began pondering quietly.Hmph, Senior must be trying to test if I still remember the contents of his lecture!With a tap of her finger, a talisman flew out from her sleeve and stuck to the food container.She then threw the food container out of the window while flames flickered on the talisman, causing the food container to explode immediately.Although her shot was not perfect, it was at least outstanding!Fairy smiled smugly and then walked out of her straw hut to search for her senior.However, her attention was quickly caught by the identical-looking food container in front of her master\u2019s door.The smug smile on Fairy\u2019s face gradually froze. She raised her hand and placed it on her forehead while groaning softly.The food was really cooked by Senior.I haven\u2019t eaten it for many years\u2026 Why am I\u2026Sigh, Senior has led me astray!\u201cMaster is in seclusion. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t notice. The food is outside the array formation.\u201dIt\u2019s going to turn bad if it\u2019s left there\u2026Fairy looked around before tiptoeing towards her Master\u2019s wooden door. She looked down and picked up the food container from the ground.Master, I don\u2019t want to snatch food from you but you\u2019re busy getting enlightenment about the Immortal Dao, so you definitely won\u2019t come out of seclusion. It\u2019s not good to waste food, right?Screech\u2014The wooden door slowly opened. The Daoist priest Qi Yuan, who was stretching his back, looked down and saw his little disciple standing in front of the door. He smiled warmly.\u201cFairy, what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Master\u2026 Senior made some dishes and asked me to send them to you.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Qi Yuan immediately grinned widely and grabbed the food container. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for you guys to be so filial. It wouldn\u2019t be too late for me to go to the Heaven-Breaking Peak after I eat it.\u201dFairy turned around and allowed her back to face her master. She pouted and looked aggrieved.I\u2019m crying, Master. I\u2019m really crying, Master\u2026She took a deep breath and asked casually, \u201cMaster, do you have something to settle at the Heaven-Breaking Peak?\u201d\u201cAhem!\u201dThe Daoist priest pretended to be calm and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Well, I\u2019ve become an immortal and previously, I received a notice from the Hundred Mortal Hall that the Little Qiong Peak can now participate in the gathering that happens once every ten years.\u201d\u201cOh, huh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOld Qing enjoyed the meal.Wan Linyun only drank a little bit of the wine that Li Changshou had brought over, leaving two jars behind.This elder did not like to drink wine and was not very interested in the dishes. He only talked about poison and the theories revolving around it while dining with Li Changshou. He had a whale of a timeWhen he returned from Pill Tripod Peak, Li Changshou obtained a bunch of herbs from Elder Wan Linyun.He was a little embarrassed. After all, he had only gone over to take a look. However, the elder\u2026 was indeed too enthusiastic.There were few Qi cultivators who were interested in the things related to the word \u2018poison\u2019.Li Changshou\u2019s level in concocting poisons was not low either. He could indeed have a conversation about it.I can\u2019t go to Pill Tripod Peak too often, I have to avoid being noticed,I shall go back again two years later.As Li Changshou thought about it, he landed in front of the Pill Chamber on the Little Qiong Peak.Sitting on the rocking chair, he held onto a roll of bamboo slip that had been processed by immortal spells and could be preserved for a long time. He then began the enlightenment and reading session for the day.Sensing that the array around the Pill Chamber had been unlocked, dejection was written all over Fairy\u2019s pretty face She flew over silently and hesitated\u2026She wanted to ask her Senior to praise her for her culinary skills, but was afraid that he might blame her for letting him down.Li Changshou waited for a while, but she did not speak. He looked up at her and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSenior.\u201d The blue fairy lowered her head and continued, \u201cMaster has gone to attend the Peak Leaders\u2019 Meet. Is there going to be any problem?\u201dLi Changshou thought for a while, and then shook his head slightly.He answered, \u201cThere won\u2019t be any problems. Master\u2019s enemy can no longer become a Peak Leader. Don\u2019t worry. Master would probably only be listening in from the corner. He\u2019s of the least seniority there, and he doesn\u2019t dare to speak up. Given Master\u2019s respectful and courteous temperament, he must be sitting on pins and needles now.\u201dIn the corner of the Hundred Mortal Hall on Heaven-Breaking Peak, the old Daoist priest, who was sitting in the corner with his head hung low, shifted his butt slightly to make himself sit upright.In the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou looked at Fairy, who was a little distracted. He smiled and said, \u201cYou did well this time. You knew that you should be worried about Master, and you also came over to discuss with me. Why have you never been so meticulous and attentive before? Alright, I won\u2019t bother with what happened last time. Just focus on your cultivation from now on.\u201dFairy blinked and asked, \u201cSenior, were you praising me just now?\u201dLi Changshou could not help but laugh. \u201cAm I so fierce that I scold you every day?\u201d\u201cAll you do is berate me all the time\u2026\u201dFairy grimaced and slipped into a better mood.It was like a frosted eggplant previous, but now, it was like a shiny tomato.\u201cSenior, this furnace looks amazing.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch it. It will bite.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 Senior, I\u2019m not twelve or thirteen years old\u2026 I\u2019m going to poke it! Psst, ouch! Why is there a lightning spell!?!\u201d\u201cI added a safety device to prevent others from opening this Pill Furnace.\u201dLi Changshou smiled calmly and continued reading outside the door.Standing beside the Pill Furnace, Fairy tilted her head while pressing her reddened fingers, scrutinizing the relief on it.Afterward, she wandered around the house for half a round, and found a scripture that she had read half of previously. She dragged the meditation cushion outside the door and waited together with Li Changshou.They were like deities who were guarding the door.The afternoon sun was warm, and the wind in the forest was gentle.The insects chirped and the butterflies danced while the immortals drifted far away on the clouds.Li Changshou had an epiphany, but he remained calm. He accepted all the things that he had comprehended without showing any fluctuations in his aura.Now that his cultivation level was higher, he could finally grasp the initiative to enter the Dao Enlightenment state.He had been the most worried about his epiphany. In fact, he had been drawn into the state of comprehending the Dao during a battle of Dao with others\u2026\u201cSenior, what level are you at now?\u201d\u201cFourth-stage of Void Return Realm.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s impressive,\u201d the blue fairy replied casually. She lowered her head and continued reading the scroll, and did bear some things in mind.\u2026In the Heavenly Courts, the Moon Elder Hall was surrounded by a huge array.Two boys were holding onto two wooden signs while being seated in front of the tightly shut door of the hall.The one on the right read:\u201cMoon Elder is not at home.\u201dThe one on the right read:\u201cMay Heavenly Dao Protect This Place\u201dThe younger boy mumbled, \u201cSenior, if we don\u2019t tell Master the truth, will we blow things up?\u201d\u201cShh, do you want to be turned back into your original state by Master?\u201d The older boy rolled his eyes and continued, \u201cWe were originally just two branches of the Acacia Tree. It was not easy for us to obtain the opportunity to be morphed by our Master. Don\u2019t worry, Master will definitely have a solution.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The younger boy pursed his lips and felt helpless.After that, the two boys waited, day after day. They waited for half a year, but the Moon Elder never returned.Where did the Moon Elder go?In fact, he did not stray too far away from the Hall of Marriage. He went to an even more remote immortal palace where he found an immortal official who had been idling all year round. He presented him with some gifts and prepared to make up for his mistakes.The Moon Elder knew very well that he did not have any backing or a strong background. Hence, he didn\u2019t dare to offend anyone.However, it was also because of that that he was appointed the position of the Moon Elder by the Jade Emperor. Only then would he not be biased towards any faction.Usually, the generals and fairies would come and ask for him to bring them together with someone else, and those were all trivial matters.If the Moon Elder really made use of the authority given by the Heavenly Dao to manipulate marriages, he would not only receive negative karma but also cause a big problem.However, the Heavenly Dao was constantly monitoring the Moon Elder Hall.Once the Moon Elder harbors intentions to jeopardize, he would be warned by the Heavenly Dao during the first time, punished during the second, and destroyed by the Purple Heaven Divine Thunder during the third\u2026The Heavenly Courts were in decline and the Dao Sect was powerful.Even if he was an ordinary disciple, the Moon Elder would not want to offend him.The root cause of the mistakes in the clay figurines was the rash action of the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du. However, Xuan Du had the protection of the Sage, and the connate treasure of the Sage, the Taiji Diagram, which was used to suppress him. He did not have any karma, and was extremely strong\u2026How could he, the insignificant Moon Elder, dare to push the blame to the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du?He had to bear the responsibility.The Moon Elder pondered for half the night.The longer he dragged the matter on, the easier it would be for him to make mistakes. He had to deal with it as soon as possible.After some thought, the Moon Elder made up his mind. She left the Hall of Marriage and went to the Divine Might Hall.At that moment, the Moon Elder and the person in charge of the Divine Might Hall\u2014an unknown immortal official in golden armor\u2014were standing together in front of the Heavenly Dao treasure, the \u2018Starry and Dreamy Astrometer\u2019.As the immortal official operated the Starry Dream Astrometer, he gave the Moon Elder a detailed explanation.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Moon Elder\u2026 I can\u2019t give dreams to the Heaven Golden Immortals because they have transcended the world. However, Golden Immortals and Heaven Immortals are not a problem, what more a young Qi cultivator who has only lived for over a hundred years.\u201dHe continued, \u201cHowever, there is one thing you should know. You can only talk in the dreams but you can\u2019t do anything. This is a treasure that the Heavenly Dao has bestowed to show off the Heavenly Courts\u2019 might. It\u2019s used to scare people. That\u2019s why I named this place the Divine Might Hall.\u201d\u201cAs long as the other party is distracted or is drunk, mentally exhausted, tired, and weak; that is to say, when the mind is relaxed, or when he is experiencing enlightenment, you would be able to invite him to enter the dream. However, if the other party is unwilling to enter the dream, there would be no other way. Are you looking for the disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, Li Changshou? Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s just a young disciple. I just need a moment\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? Why can\u2019t I find this person?\u201dThe golden-armored immortal official\u2019s neck protruded forward, as he stared at the unchanged Starry Dream Astrometer.The Moon Elder stood at the side and smiled warmly as he continued to wait.The golden-armored immortal official quickly said, \u201cMoon Elder, are you sure this is his name? Do you have his birth characters?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I have his birth characters at the Hall of Marriage,\u201d the Moon Elder answered with a smile and quickly took out a note from his sleeve.This time, the golden-armored immortal official lowered his head and fiddled with the huge Starry Dream Astrometer that finally began to operate slowly.An hour later, the immortal official heaved a long sigh of relief and wiped the sweat off his forehead.\u201cPhew. The Starry Dream Astrometer has found him. He is in the Immortal Du Sect.\u201dIt was no wonder that he is a disciple who enjoys the protection of the Connate treasure. It was so difficult to find him!\u201cMoon Elder look over here. When this star is ignited, it means that he is asleep or distracted. We can then invite him into the dream\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d the Moon Elder asked softly.The immortal official smiled and said, \u201cYes, Moon Elder, please wait a moment. Normally, he will definitely be distracted within half a day.\u201dThe Moon Elder hurriedly thanked him while standing at the side. The immortal official waved his hand repeatedly, politely saying that he was just doing him a favor on the account that they belonged to the same hall.However, half a day later\u2026One day later\u2026Two days later\u2026\u201cWhy is it not lit yet?\u201d the immortal official in charge of sending dreams murmured with a frown.The Moon Elder smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m alright, I just have to trouble you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a small matter. I rarely have any visitors here. I don\u2019t believe that he can stay focused and not be distracted for a month.\u201dA month passed.The Moon Elder and the immortal official sat cross-legged in front of the Starry Dream Astrometer, keeping their eyes fixed on a dim star.Two months later\u2026The immortal official\u2019s eyes turned bloodshot.He said hoarsely, \u201cIs this treasure broken?How could a disciple of an immortal sect stay in his immortal sect for such a long time without relaxing? I wouldn\u2019t have to wait so long for those Golden Immortals to get distracted\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe Moon Elder said in a low voice, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we forget about it?\u201dThe immortal official waved his hand and refuted, \u201cNo!I have to do what I promised!\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to the Hall of Marriage first, Moon Elder? I\u2019ll continue waiting here! I\u2019ll inform you when I have news!\u201dThe Moon Elder hurriedly said, \u201cThe Heavenly Dao is in charge of marriage. I only deal with those who visit to ask to get married. It\u2019s peaceful to hide here. Well, thank you fellow Daoist.\u201dIf there were any matrimonial fates that the Heavenly Dao in the Hall of Marriage wanted him to sever, the Moon Elder would be able to sense it. By staying there, nothing would be affected.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re welcome.\u201dThree months later\u2026The immortal official turned to look at the Moon Elder. Due to the fact that he had not blinked for a long time, his eyes were bulging and his eye sockets had sunken in. However, he was anxious.It must be faulty!The treasure given by the Heavenly Dao is faulty, isn\u2019t it?It had been a long time, but there was still no movement. He had lost face in front of the Moon Elder!He had plans to ask the Moon Elder to help him with matchmaking in the future. How could he let this treasure fumble the ball!?!The immortal official muttered dejectedly under his breath, \u201cIsn\u2019t this heavenly device one with the Heavenly Courts? How could there be a malfunction?\u201dThe Moon Elder frowned and said, \u201cFellow Daoist, why don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cWait! I\u2019ll continue to wait! If you have something to do, go back first. I\u2019m bent on waiting for this kid! If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll go down and meet him!\u201dThe Moon Elder quickly said that there was no need for that and continued to wait patiently by the side. He used his immortal senses to observe the Hall of Marriage, for fear that some great immortal would appear.Half a year later\u2026The immortal official lied on the ground and sighed before saying softly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we change our train of thought?I\u2019ll first invite the other disciples of the Immortal Du Sect and to the dream and then ask someone else to inform this kid to meet you in his dream. How does that sound?\u201dMoon Elder, who was still in a daze, suddenly perked up. \u201cGood idea!\u201d\u201cI just feel like I\u2019ve been played by this little disciple. My divine might is not restored\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 How did he do it? He didn\u2019t even give me a single chance in half a year!\u201dThus, half a day later\u2026Just as Li Changshou was pondering over the Inaction Sutra, Fairy rushed out of the forest, forcing him to stop cultivating and close the outer array formation.\u201cSenior!\u201d\u201cOne of the Heavenly God in golden armor visited me in my dream just now. He said that he wanted to give you a dream so he\u2019d like you to relax your mind. He said that the Moon Elder from the Hall of Marriage of the Heavenly Courts wants to see you for something!\u201dDream? Moon Elder?Li Changshou frowned and realized that things might not be simple.Since they had looked for him for no reason, there must be a trap that he had yet to see!Before this, his mind was in a mess, and after that, it was filled with distracting thoughts. He had no choice but to take out his secret treasure\u2014the Aged Beauties Portrait.Then, his armpits began to itch for no reason\u2026There must be something wrong with this!Back when he seemed to be analyzing the reason for the door of the Immortal Du Sect to be a little crooked, he had considered the possibility of the Moon Elder and the Red String of Fate.Could it be that the Moon Elder is really behind this?However, how could Moon Elder dare to lay his hands on Ren Sect\u2026The blue fairy hurriedly said, \u201cSenior, quickly enter your dreams.\u201dLi Changshou squinted as he said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m not going for now.\u201d\u201cFor now\u2026 can you turn that down too?\u201d\u201cIf they could enter my dream, why did they have to ask you to inform me?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and explained, \u201cThis time, the Moon Elder should be asking me for help. There\u2019s no need to worry. Let me consider it carefully.\u201d\u201cFairy, go to the reclining chair and sleep for a while. It\u2019s fine if you just stare blankly into space. Don\u2019t focus. If that golden-armored Heavenly God tries to give you the dream again, ask him for the details of the matter. I\u2019m busy refining pills here, so I can\u2019t enter the dream.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Okay.\u201dFairy blinked her and replied obediently before walking towards the rocking chair outside the door.Sigh, Senior has used me as a treasure again.She sighed softly but a smile appeared on her lips.She was quite glad to be of some help to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey were in front of the Starry Dream Astrometer in the Divine Might Hall of the Heavenly Courts.After the second dream was sent to the blue fairy, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect\u2026The Golden-armored immortal official\u2019s mind returned from the Starry Dream Astrometer. He grabbed a long spear and gritted his teeth.He barked, \u201cHe actually refused! He even said that he was refining pills! Moon Elder, I will go down and bring him up!\u201dThe Moon Elder was stunned and quickly stepped forward to stop him.He knew that the immortal official was just putting on an act. Regardless of how small Ren Sect may be, they were still a sect. The Immortal Du Sect might not take them seriously, let alone let them nab their disciple.However, he had a request for them, after all\u2026\u201cYou can\u2019t, Immortal Official. You can\u2019t. Let\u2019s think about this from the long-term perspective and discuss it!\u201dThe Moon Elder tried to calm him down for a while. Finally, the golden-armored immortal official was \u201cappeased\u201d.The Moon Elder asked, \u201cWhat did they say?\u201dThe immortal official answered, \u201cHis junior sister is very polite and courteous. She said that her senior is in the midst of refining pills and cannot be distracted. She also asked for the reason that we\u2019re asking to meet him, and wanted us to let her know if it\u2019s something urgent.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThe Moon Elder immediately felt troubled.He could not tell anyone about this matter because it concerned his own reputation. If it were to spread to His Majesty\u2019s ears, the latter would definitely blame him.The Moon Elder pondered for a while and asked, \u201cMay I ask for your help to look for his junior sister again? Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too polite, Moon Elder. It\u2019s just a small matter!\u201dThe immortal official turned around and faced the Starry Dream Astrometer. He could not help but grin.Every time he sent a dream, a large amount of his Primordial Spirit would be consumed. If he were to do it a few more times, he would definitely faint\u2026In the Pill Chamber of the Immortal Du Sect, Li Changshou listened to his junior\u2019s description of the situation and gave her some instructions.Soon, Fairy was stunned and she saw a layer of clouds.\u201cSenior! They\u2019re here again!\u201d\u201cGo.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and nodded.Fairy closed her eyes and quickly entered the dream while Li Changshou observed her condition from the side.She just fell asleep\u2026There was no circulation of Dao runes or any other movement.Li Changshou raised his hand and poked Fairy\u2019s arm while she hummed softly and seemed to be half-asleep.The Heavenly Courts are indeed worthy of being an organization established by the Heavenly Dao, for the sake of controlling heaven and earth. The dream must have been triggered by some treasure of the Heavenly Dao. How magical.Using his immortal senses, Li Changshou scanned the various parts of the Little Qiong Peak and fell into deep thought.The mastermind behind this might not be just the Moon Elder alone.Moon Elder is probably just a tool, like the golden-armored Heavenly God\u2026The Immortal Seal Tribulation had yet to arrive. The Heavenly Courts have just been established, and even the Jade Emperor has to be cautious. The Moon Elder that the Jade Emperor had appointed, should be a timid person.Now, for example, the personal disciple of the Master of the Three Sects had to address the Jade Emperor as Uncle-Master Hao Tian after he went to the Heavenly Courts, while the Jade Emperor has to treat the second-generation disciples of the sect with respect\u2026There are only a few people in Ren Sect, and behind them is the Grand Pure One.The Grand Pure One had already entered the Tushita Palace of the Heavenly Courts. The Jade Emperor would definitely not dare to plot against Ren Sect, nor would he have any motive to do so.Moreover, the Heavenly Courts is still a safe haven and the Western schools cannot have control for now\u2026Although the disciples of the Chan and Jie Sects are not on good terms, they had not fallen out with each other.Ren Sect does not have much Dao heritage, to begin with, and does not have any feud with Jie Sect and Chan Sect. The possibility of them causing trouble is not high either.According to elimination, Ren Sect is the only one that would dare to and might cause trouble for the Ren\u2026 SectCould it be that there is an expert in Ren Sect who feels that the Ren Sect has too little Dao inheritors and wants to use the Red String of Fate to bring about more offspring?This is similar to my plan to use the Love Hex to urge a pair of rare spiritual beasts to mate and reproduce\u2026Who is this expert?Could it be the founder of the Immortal Du Sect who is also the Perfected One who cultivated in the Kunlun Mountain?That\u2019s unlikely\u2026As an in-name disciple of a Sage, the founder of the sect was also very careful in his cultivation. He basically did not have much of a presence and did not dare to endure the backlash of karma.Anyone who had heard the Sage preach could claim to be an in-name disciple.After giving it some thought, he realized that the Sage of Ren Sect only had one personal disciple who would have the time, influential abilities, and power to get the Moon Elder to help him with this matter\u2026The Great Daoist Master Xuan Du!It should be him.However, this time, it was the Moon Elder who wanted to visit him in his dream. Li Changshou recalled his strange behavior previously\u2026The current situation was very likely to be related to his marriage. The Great Daoist Master had probably caused some issues which the Moon Elder had to settle.I knew it. How could someone so toxic have a good impression of me for no reason?Li Changshou raised his eyebrows, but he was puzzled.If Youqin Xuanya only had a good impression of me because of Moon Elder\u2019s arrangements, why me?Could I have been targeted by the Great Daoist Master?I have to find out more later.In terms of marriage, I should be able to use my little junior sister as my shield.That was probably one of the few benefits that his master could think of when he accepted Fairy as a disciple.\u201cThe good fortune of the Heavenly Dao is truly unpredictable.\u201d\u201cThe Primordial World is so vast that we might end up as mayflies.\u201dLi Changshou sighed softly and continued to think about how he could stop being passive.He put his hands behind his back and waited for his little junior sister to wake up. At the same time, he began to activate the surrounding array formations.Since the Moon Elder does not dare to offend anyone and wants to threaten or negotiate with me, the weakest party\u2026 what advantages can I get from this?No, I can\u2019t force it.It would be best if I can act as I wish.As a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, he had his own plans. There was no need for him to rely on others. He would only be at ease if he could take the initiative.However, if he could maintain a good relationship with the Moon Elder, it would be easier for him, his, and Fairy to go to heaven in the future\u2026The Heavenly Courts definitely had a wide network of connections since the Moon Elder was in charge of marriage.This time, he could start from this. He could sell a favor to Moon Elder and let him know that he had done him a favor on purpose. At the same time, he could not expose anything\u2026Indeed, he needed to deal with it carefully.A moment later, Fairy woke up.After pondering for a while, she told Li Changshou about the things that the Moon Elder and the Gold-armored Heavenly God wanted her to relay to him.\u201cMoon Elder said that he had previously counted the clay figurines of marriage and accidentally touched yours, causing it to be damaged. Moon Elder feels uneasy about this so he wants to meet you to discuss this matter and he also wants to see if there is anything wrong with you.\u201dLi Changshou suddenly realized that the Moon Elder was intending to look for him to resolve the karma.That\u2019s easy.Fairy was a little nervous as she whispered,\u201cSenior, are you alright? If the clay figurine is damaged, will there be no means for you to get married in the future?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Li Changshou shook his head and said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll just meet him.\u201dNo matter what, the Moon Elder had come looking for him with a sincere attitude.He only needed to be mindful of his status as a young disciple of the Immortal Du Sect and act accordingly.\u201cJunior Sister, protect me.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Fairy answered in a crisp voice.She jumped up from the reclining chair gracefully while holding a few treasures in her hands.Li Changshou lied down on the reclining chair, clasping the two paper effigies and trying to calm himself down so that he could relax his mind.As expected, he gradually entered a foggy dream.In front of him was an immortal pavilion situated on the peak of the mountain. In the pavilion, there was a thin old man dressed in a wedding robe who was bowing to him.Li Changshou felt like he was stepping on a cloud. He suddenly got an idea and rode the cloud forward before bowing to the old man.\u201cI\u2019m Li Changshou, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect. Greetings, Senior.\u201dThe Moon Elder smiled happily. \u201cI finally get to see you. Don\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201d\u201cThis is a dream. It\u2019s not easy to entertain you. Please sit down and talk.\u201dLi Changshou nodded with a smile. The two of them bowed to each other and took their seats.They looked at each other and smiled. However, both of them had some thoughts in mind.The Moon Elder thought This person should be easy to talk to.However, what Li Changshou thought was This Moon Elder doesn\u2019t look\u2026 that weak either.\u201cSenior, please tell me what it is. I know that you are busy, so I don\u2019t want to hold you up.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201d The Moon Elder deliberated over his words before clearing his throat and saying, \u201cIn the past two years, your body has been fine, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cI just feel a little itchy at times. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dThe Moon Elder frowned and quickly asked, \u201cWell, um\u2026 do you still feel your Yang energy condensing? Does your heart race, and do you feel any\u2026 sexual urges?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\u201cWait for a moment.\u201d Elder Yue waved his hand casually, and the potted Acacia Tree appeared in his hand. \u201cThis is the spiritual treasure, the Acacia Tree. I\u2019ll poke you with the branch to see if you feel anything.\u201dLi Changshou nodded cooperatively, but deep down, he was thinking to himself,This dream is indeed extraordinary.Come to think of it, there seem to be some books that recorded the matters of dream-traversing\u2026One of the branches of the Acacia Tree extended towards Li Changshou who allowed it to poke him, while his mind was filled with thoughts. His breathing quickened slightly.Moon Elder paused for a while and asked with concern, \u201cDo you feel anything?\u201d\u201cYes, I do\u2026\u201dLi Changshou smiled in his heart as he could feel the Yang energy surging in his body, but he pretended to frown. \u201cBut not much.\u201d\u201cWell, Well\u2026\u201d Elder Yue frowned and smiled bitterly. He continued, \u201cLet\u2019s try a few more times.\u201dLi Changshou coughed and quickly refuted.If he was poked again, something might really happen!\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Senior. I\u2019ll go back and recuperate. My Junior Sister is still beside me. It\u2019s not convenient.\u201dThe Moon Elder frowned.Li Changshou hesitated for a while before continuing to speak with a smile\u2026\u2026An hour later\u2026In front of the Starry Dream Astrometer in the Heavenly Courts, the Moon Elder\u2019s body moved and he woke up. He could not help but smile as he stroked his beard emotionally.He touched his sleeve and realized that the Dharma treasure ring that doubled as storage space was gone. He heaved a sigh of relief.It was completed.\u201cWhat a good junior. He has the demeanor of a disciple of a reputable sect!\u201dThe golden-armored immortal official beside him coughed and slipped but he quickly regained his balance. He looked at the Moon Elder with a smile.Although he did not participate in the dream just now, he had used his immortal power to create it.He had almost drained the power of his Primordial Spirit, especially since he had repeatedly sent dreams\u2026\u201cMoon Elder, is everything alright?\u201d\u201cThank you, Fellow Daoist. Thank you, Fellow Daoist!\u201d The Moon Elder took out a brocade box from his chest pocket. \u201cThis is a small token of gratitude for you. Thank you.\u201dThe immortal official\u2019s face was full of righteousness as he rejected him resolutely. \u201cAh, I\u2019m not a greedy immortal!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let you help me for nothing. I\u2019m really sorry about that,\u201d Elder Yue said politely.One pushed and the other refuted, but the brocade box was soon placed in the immortal official\u2019s sleeve.The Moon Elder performed a Dao salute and left the Divine Might Hall.After sending the Moon Elder off, the immortal official sat in front of the hall and heaved a sigh of relief.He was much thinner than he used to be half a year ago.On the other side, the Moon Elder was in a good mood as he flew forward with a smile on his face.Changshou is such a good junior.It is no wonder that this disciple of the Immortal Du Sect was able to obtain the Three Stars and Moon. He respects his elders and knows his manners. He was even considerate towards me, an insignificant immortal.Most people would only talk to me about marriage.During the long conversation with Changshou, he never brought up anything about marriage!That made the Moon Elder feel very comfortable.Li Changshou was smart to say \u2018Let nature take its course\u2019, and he is much more brilliant than the generals of the Heavenly Courts!At the end of the day, isn\u2019t marriage just a matter of letting nature take its course?Changshou is extremely thoughtful to have made a vow to make me, an old man, feel at ease\u2026However, when they were taking an oath, the content of Li Changshou\u2019s oath was rather long-winded.However, after careful consideration, the Moon Elder felt that it was very perfect. He had considered all the conditions and circumstances.He swore an oath on Dao that both parties would not mention the matter of the clay figurine being damaged, in the future. The Moon Elder would not interfere with Li Changshou\u2019s marriage, and Li Changshou would not tell anyone about his dream.Actually, the Moon Elder had taken a closer look at the clay figurine and discovered that it had been engulfed by the power of the Heavenly Dao. Hence, it was not damaged at all. It could grow, give rise to red strings, and had complete functions.The Moon Elder was just worried\u2026However, he did not expect Li Changshou to be so worried about affecting his position as Moon Elder. Those words had really tugged at his heartstrings!Was it easy for him?He did not have any background, and his cultivation level was not high either. He had been appointed to assume his current position by the Jade Emperor. He had to deal with the outside world, and run errands for the Heavenly Courts and the Heavenly Dao.He didn\u2019t dare to offend the higher-ranking officials of the Heavenly Courts.He did not dare to offend those who had higher cultivation levels than him.He did not dare to provoke anyone with a powerful background\u2026However, the Hall of Marriage was a sensitive place. If he had any selfish motives, he would easily be turned to ashes by the Purple Heaven Divine Thunder\u2026\u201cSenior, your life is too hard.\u201dThe Moon Elder looked up at the sky with his hands behind his back, his eyes filled with emotions.The ten-thousand-year-old Moon Elder knew how hard his life was!Those who understand me will live longer!If possible, I\u2019d really like to make this disciple from the Immortal Du Sect my soul mate!Yes, he had mentioned his master\u2019s story.After going through so many difficulties, Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan did not care about the criticisms about him. Instead, he used his willpower to transform into a Turbid Immortal.Changshou was using this story to encourage me to continue persisting in this difficult life I live\u2026If Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan wants to join the Heavenly Courts in the future, I must help him!Those compensation gifts for my friend Changshou are really nothing!He hated that he had prepared too little!In the Pill Chamber in Little Qiong Peak of the Immortal Du,Li Changshou woke up from his dream and quickly checked his surroundings. In an instant, he realized that Little Junior Sister was 30 feet away, with her back facing him. Her face was red.Li Changshou looked down at his robe\u2026Um\u2026it\u2019s hard to explain.In his dream, he had been poked by the Acacia Tree. There was nothing he could do about it. After all, he was a normal male immortal and had not severed his feelings and lust.Li Changshou slowly stood up and tidied his clothes without leaving a trace. He put away the ring that had appeared out of nowhere and smiled.\u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d\u201cSenior\u2026 Senior.\u201d Fairy\u2019s shoulders trembled and she did not even dare to look back at him. She said in a trembling voice, \u201cI-I\u2019ll go back first\u2026 I\u2019ll come back later!\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, she fled without looking back. White smoke rose from her head\u2026Li Changshou smiled and closed the array formation around her. He could not help but complain in his head. Seriously, she isn\u2019t even that fond of me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHas the Heavenly Courts become so wealthy?In the secret chamber of Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou looked at the pile of superior-grade Spirit Stones that were giving out an aura on the ring that the Moon Elder gave him. He suddenly looked like a pauper.\u201cIt\u2019s different. We\u2019re different\u2026\u201dLi Changshou shook his head and sighed.The Spirit Stones could be used to buy a large amount of precious materials from the town outside the Immortal Gate and used to condense stronger array foundations. He could also use them to strengthen the array formation of the Little Qiong Peak.Li Changshou\u2019s previous plan to update the array formation could be completed by one-third!However, direct costs did not seem reasonable.He could use the superior-grade Spirit Stones stones as his first capital.I should buy some herbs in the town, and bring them back for refining pills. I\u2019ll then use the pills to exchange for treasures and Spirit Stones. That way, I\u2019d be able to profit continuously!There would be no middleman taking a part of the profits!Li Changshou frowned and pondered\u2026It would be too dangerous for him to do it using his own body. There were countless people who had lost their lives for a few Spirit Stones, and he ought to weigh the pros and cons clearly.However, if his paper effigies could complete those dangerous tasks, things would be different\u2026It would be equivalent to making money with zero risks.If that was really the case, he would be able to do both things at once.He could get his master to retrieve the Immortal Pill from the Hundred Mortal Hall and accumulate herbs.On the other hand, he would use the paper effigies to collect herbs and sell pills in the town outside the gate\u2026It should not be a difficult task for him to earn more than ten Immortal Treasures within fifty years!In just seventy to eighty years, he would be able to accumulate more than half of the treasures required for the \u2018Composite Defense System\u2019 that he had planned for Little Qiong Peak!Not only would he be able to obtain the \u201cwealth\u201d that he lacked the most, but he would also be able to nourish his master and junior sister\u2026The problem was, how could he make the paper effigies go to the town?It was actually quite troublesome for young disciples to go out.However, his master was not within the sect\u2019s restrictions and had already become an immortal\u2019s master. He could go out for any random reason.Turbid Immortals were also considered immortals.I should get Master to bring my paper clone out and once he\u2019s away from the mountain-protection array formation, the paper clone would be able to go to the town to trade easily\u2026The first step would be completed.Next would be the key problem \u2014 the limitations of the mystical abilities of the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts.The Immortal Du Sect\u2019s gate was closer to Linhai Town, which was relatively famous in the East Continent. Although it was only more than 20,000 kilometers away\u2026 the furthest Li Changshou\u2019s paper effigies could go was a thousand kilometers away from him\u2026The current Man-Forming Paper Cutouts, or rather, their mystical abilities would not allow the paper effigies to reach the nearest town.The Primordial Word is really too vast\u2026It was impossible to imagine how vast the land was when the ancient dragons, phoenix, unicorns, and hundreds of other beasts flourished!Let\u2019s get back to business.Li Changshou was in deep thought for half a day. He did a detailed calculation, drew up a plan, and conducted a risk assessment for the pill business. Finally, he made up his mind.He had to work hard to get rich!He had to change mystical abilities!If immortals wanted to do something good, they would first have to benefit from it.After the Wind Escape and Fire Escape had completed their advancements, he would focus on improving the mystical abilities of the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts!If he wanted his main body to remain in the mountain, the paper effigy would have to go to the town outside the gate to make the business transactions. He would have to make the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts undergo magical changes.The changes had to be extraordinary!The principle of the original Man-Forming Paper Cutouts was to store one\u2019s Dharma powers and immortal power in the paper effigies.The transformation of the paper effigies into humanoids was actually similar to the blindfold method. Due to the special material of the paper effigies and their spiritual energy, they could be passed off as the real thing.After Li Changshou became an immortal, the mystical abilities of his Man-Forming Paper Cutouts were perfected. Within the range of his immortal senses, he could place a portion of his attention on the paper effigies.Now, when Li Changshou was not controlling the paper effigies, they would be like living creatures that could complete the simple instructions of the person exhibiting their mystical abilities.For example, they could perform chores like sweeping, removing weeds, massaging, dancing, simple fighting, and some indescribable functions.However, what Li Changshou needed now was not those effects.He wanted the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts to evolve into an incarnate through the cheapest and easiest methods!It was equivalent to creating some \u2018paper bodies\u2019 that could be changed at any time. He could store a portion of immortal power in them and control them at will.As long as the paper effigy incarnate could unleash 10% or 50% of his strength, it would be enough.\u201cTo do this, I have to use the restrictions to refine Dharma treasures\u2026\u201d Li Changshou muttered to himself.This time, he was quick. Soon, he had already decided on the cultivation plan for the next ten years\u2014He wanted to practice refining and deal with mystical abilities!ITAL If I don\u2019t know, I can just learn. If I don\u2019t know, I can just watch.Now that I have a sufficient lifespan, it\u2019s time for me to start refining.\u201cLet\u2019s focus on studying the restrictions that can put one\u2019s mind at ease.\u201dHe then looked back at the ring\u2026It was needless to say that he was grateful for the strong support that the Moon Elder had given for the construction of the Little Qiong Peak!Apart from high-quality Spirit Stones, Li Changshou also saw numerous porcelain bottles and gourds that contained pills.Furthermore, they were pills that were similar to the Poisonous Dragon Wine\u2026It could only be said that as expected of the Moon Elder, the pills he gave were rather unique.Li Changshou wanted to burn those pills with the True Samadhi Flames, but he hesitated.It would be such a waste.These are the elixirs that the Moon Elder has refined, which are a blessing for many male cultivators!They would be able to save marriages and give couples a blissful life.Both immortals and mortals could use them.He took out some empty porcelain bottles and classified the elixirs into different categories. He then burned the porcelain bottles and refined the Moon Elder\u2019s aura.\u201cI\u2019ll keep them as gifts for the future, or exchange them for something else\u2026\u201dIf they were popular, he could try to reverse-engine the recipe and find a way to refine the elixirs. He could then produce it in large quantities and sell them for a lot of profits!\u201cTsk, it\u2019s not good to be blinded by wealth. Having more money is only for better cultivation. The Dao is the foundation of the Qi cultivators.\u201dAfter lecturing himself, Li Changshou could not help but laugh.He transferred all the items in the ring to his three main Dharma treasures storage space and sealed the ring\u2026He carefully recalled the conversation he had with the Moon Elder a few times. After confirming that there was no mistake in his expression and words, he temporarily put the matter aside.There was still some time before he had to go to the Heavenly Courts. His master had yet to reach the Perfected Immortal Realm. There was no need to rush things.After that, Li Changshou exited the secret underground chamber quietly and left the Little Qiong Peak on a cloud.\u2026The Dao Repository was located in the middle of the mountain behind the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Li Changshou did not attract anyone\u2019s attention.Even the elders in the outer hall, who had been cultivating all year round, could not be bothered to open their eyes to look at him.Afterward, Li Changshou started his research in the alchemy room.\u201cI wonder when Uncle-Master will come out of seclusion.\u201dIn the outer hall of the Dao Repository, the refining prohibitions that could be found were more basic.If Uncle-Master could go to the inner hall and help me memorize some high-level restrictions that had been made public by the Perfected Immortals in the sect, that would be great.There was no restriction within the sect and the Perfected Immortal Immortals would impart that knowledge to their disciples who had yet to become immortals.Li Changshou tapped his fingers on the table as he considered everything in his heart. Then, he thought of an elder in the sect.Elder Wan Linyun.The Thousand Poison Golden Furnace that he was using now was refined by Elder Wan Linyun himself. He could naturally ask the latter to teach him some refining methods.However, he had already received too many benefits from Wan Linyun. No matter how thick-skinned he was, he still felt a little embarrassed\u2026\u201cIf there\u2019s no other way, I\u2019ll ask about the restrictions on the Dharma treasure that I have entrusted my spiritual energy to.\u201dLi Changshou sighed softly.He owed more and more favors to that elder. It was really not a good thing and he felt that he had to think of ways to repay them in the future.After staying in the Pill Chamber for half a day, he went to the secret chamber again.He took out a few paper effigies and scattered them on the table, after which they immediately seemed to have come alive. After standing on the table, they began\u2026Jumping, leaping, fighting, and dancing.Li Changshou focused his attention and carefully tried to feel it. Soon, he began to gain some enlightenment\u2026Not long after, he took out his carving knife and bamboo slip, and started to make the first notes on his research on \u201cPaper Effigies Evolving Into Avatars\u201dThe innovation of mystical abilities could only be possible with continuous trials.If he wanted to complete the transformation of his mystical abilities, he had to be bold, ambitious, and expand his train of thought. He had to be careful, conscientious, and steady. The theory and practice had to be combined\u2026Thus, six years later.\u2026In the blue sky, a few white clouds floated across slowly.In front of the gate of the Immortal Du Sect Mountain, Qi Yuan, who was dressed in a brown Daoist robe, held a whisk and informed the immortal who was guarding the gate that he was going out.\u201cJunior Qi Yuan, how many days are you going out for?\u201d\u201cI will be back in about three days. I have some inspiration and I\u2019d like to go out to take a look.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The immortal guarding the gate did not probe further. A rift was formed in the mountain-protection array formation and Qi Yuan went out on his own. mountain-protecting array formationQi Yuan thanked him and rode a cloud out of the mountain-protection array formation, heading towards the East Ocean.After flying for about a thousand kilometers, Qi Yuan heard a voice transmission.\u201cMaster, find a secret place to place the box in. You can go to the spirit mine and wait there. You don\u2019t have to go too far away from the sect. I will return in three days. You can bring the box back.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201d Qi Yuan replied and asked softly at his sleeve, \u201cDon\u2019t you need me to do more?\u201dLi Changshou continued to transmit.\u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m only going to the town to sell some pills and herbs. That way, I can earn some Spirit Stones and precious materials.\u201dQi Yuan sighed in his heart, his eyes filled with guilt, but he followed his disciple\u2019s instructions and flew into a forest on the mountain.After finding a place where humans were scarce, he placed a fist-sized, square sandalwood box on the grass patch under a tree.After doing all that, Qi Yuan pretended to stroll around and enjoy the scenery. A wisp of immortal senses was also observing the box.A moment later, a crack was formed in the box. A diamond-shaped gem the size of a fingernail extended out and swayed around.The gem flickered.Li Changshou sent another voice transmission to Qi Yuan.\u201cMaster, please retract your immortal senses first.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Qi Yuan retracted his immortal senses, but he was rather puzzled.Immediately, the diamond-shaped gem outside the box stopped flickering.A \u201creed rod\u201d that looked like a diving mirror prodded out and looked around.Afterward, the lid of the box was gently lifted, and a pale yellow paper effigy jumped out.This paper effigy was several times thicker and slightly bigger than an ordinary paper one. There was a small cloth bag hanging on its shoulder.It held its waist and swayed back and forth while rays of light surrounded it.In the blink of an eye, the paper effigy transformed into a thin, eight-foot-tall Daoist who was dressed in a green Daoist robe. His long hair was tied up casually, and he carried a long sword on his back.The aura of the paper Daoist fluctuated slightly. After stabilizing himself in the Essence Immortal Realm, he quickly reduced to the Dao Requital Realm and concealed himself.The paper Daoist\u2019s gaze flickered slightly. There was a hint of spiritual light in it and he was no different from a living person.He took out a mirror and looked at himself before muttering, \u201cAh, the appearance still resembles me after all.\u201dHe shook his head and put away the square box on the ground. He conjured a seal with both hands and disappeared into the ground.That was the result of Li Changshou\u2019s six-year research!Mystical Abilities; Improved Test Version: Cut paper turns into a human!The paper effigy had already been considered an avatar in reality.However, due to Li Changshou\u2019s decision to take shortcuts, the avatar was actually just an empty shell.Apart from that, there were many other imperfections in the paper Daoist No.1.For example, Li Changshou had no choice but to place a portion of the Primordial Spirit in his body. If his avatar was killed, his Primordial Spirit would suffer slight damages.That alone required constant improvement.Li Changshou had put in a lot of effort to prevent the paper cutout avatar from being killed.For example, the sword on the paper effigy\u2019s back seemed like a sword but was actually a Dharma artifact composed of poison and drugs.Originally, Li Changshou did not plan to test the combat power of Avatar No.1.However, the human heart was vicious. He had encountered a mishap because his wealth was flaunted, during his first trip out.After leaving the vicinity of the Immortal Du Sect, he used the Earth Escape for half a day and rushed to the famous Linhai Town in the East Continent.To be safe, he sold small batches of pills in different locations and shops. He also discovered several shops belonging to the Immortal Du Sect\u2026He then used the Spirit Stones he had exchanged for, as well as a portion of the Immortal Stones, to purchase a large number of spirit herbs, poisonous herbs, precious materials, and young spiritual beasts.Not counting the first bucket of gold, the profits from the pills this time was about 60% of his cost, which was already impressive.In order to conceal his presence, he set up a stall there for half a day, where he peddled the Dharma artifacts that he had refined and some pills that were of good quality.The prices were moderate and he managed to sell several Spirit Stones.However, Li Changshou realized that his paper avatar was still being targeted by someone despite his conscientiousness\u2026There was still half a day left before the three-day deadline. Li Changshou quietly left the \u2018town\u2019, which was comparable to the capitals of the wealthy nations in the mortal world. He rode a cloud and flew towards the forest where he could use Earth Escape.However, a few figures followed them out of Linhai Town. Each of them hid their cultivation and tailed them quietly.Look, this is the Primordial world.Li Changshou sighed softly in his heart and flew even more anxiously.On the trimmed sleeves formed by the clone, there were paper dolls holding small swords and porcelain bottles. They were rubbing their palms and ready to attack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInitially, Li Changshou was not used to shifting his consciousness onto the paper effigy.It was the kind of feeling\u2026 where he felt very fragile, light, weak, helpless, vulnerable, and insecure\u2026However, he was able to get used to it after a while.After leaving the town, Li Changshou was certain that someone was tailing him. Pretending not to know, he rode a cloud towards the place he had reserved.Due to the fact that there was an Anti-Five-Element Array formation around Linhai Town, he could not use any escape technique. Therefore, he had to pull some distance away before he could use Earth Escape.Two of the strange men who had been following him had already rushed up to the spot in front of him and set up some array formations and traps in the forest.I must have been targeted by those people when I took out the superior-grade Spirit Stones.Li Changshou thought to himself and felt helpless.Spirit Stones were considered hard currency in the East Continent and the Central Deity Continent because they had the most uses. Moreover, the Qi cultivators needed them and the production was stable.However, superior-grade Spirit Stones were usually produced in the core of the spirit meridian. They were rare and precious, and their value was much higher than ordinary Spirit Stones.The 300-feet dense forest in front should be where they\u2019re attacking.He had just left the boundary of the Anti-Five-Element Array, which was where he could use the Earth Escape\u2026They had obviously planned this meticulously.The combat ability of the paper effigy was debatable, and its defense was definitely inferior. It was only as strong as a cultivator who was at the Void Return Stage.However, he had instilled his immortal power into it. He could directly cast powerful Dharma spells\u2026The place was quite close to the town Although it was remote, the strong Primordial Energy fluctuations would definitely attract the attention of many Qi cultivators.Furthermore, the paper effigy had expended too much immortal power and was prone to being unable to go home because he was deprived.The paper effigy had a third of his assets.Even though he had paper effigy No. 2 and No. 3 as backups, it was best not to lose anything\u2026He had to end the battle quickly and not let the other party touch him!The closer he got to the traps set up by the other party, the more he felt that they were looking at him.He did not feel alarmed because his main body wasn\u2019t there.Li Changshou looked at the diamond-shaped gemstone hanging on his waist, which was the second product of his refinement that he was satisfied with. It was the Sensing Stone.The first product that he was satisfied with was the Soul-Bewitching Pearl.In the past six years, apart from adding restrictions like \u2018Mind Entrust\u2019 and \u2018Stable Immortality\u2019 to the paper effigies, he had also created that pearl.The gem was purple-red in color, which meant that three immortal senses and spiritual senses were locked onto him.In the forest in front, the two figures hiding behind the trees were keeping their guards up.There was another person hiding behind the clouds in the sky. He seemed to be passing by, but he maintained the same speed and was going in the same direction as Li Changshou\u2026So brazen?The town was indeed chaotic. There were many itinerant cultivators and there were no rules outside the town.He was still a thousand feet away from the enemy\u2019s trap\u2026500 feet\u2026100 feet\u2026Li Changshou suddenly realized something and mumbled, \u201cI forgot to buy something.\u201dHe then turned around and was about to leave the town.Suddenly, a ray of light fell from above. Two figures appeared from behind and in front of him respectively. They rushed towards Li Changshou, and the light from the treasure in their hands flickered!The corners of Li Changshou\u2019s lips twitched slightly. However, he immediately acted as his expression changed drastically as he plunged into the forest.\u201cYou! Who are you!\u201dIt was a close call. A three-feet-long square seal landed right in front of him!The wind blew, causing Li Changshou\u2019s long hair to dance wildly!As soon as he landed, five figures rushed towards him from behind.Li Changshou took two steps back and gripped the hilt of his sword with his right hand.He shouted, \u201cWait! We can talk!\u201dThe five of them did not stop at all. The two of them used their techniques and threw treasures at Li Changshou.Li Changshou\u2019s eyes widened. He pulled the sword on his back out by three inches. Wisps of colorless powder were activated by his immortal power and floated towards the five of them.With exquisite footwork, he dodged the incoming Dharma treasures, Dharma spells, and talismans, looking rather pathetic.The assassin with the highest cultivation level in the sky opened his left palm and aimed it at Li Changshou.A mysterious wave appeared around Li Changshou, and his movements slowed down.The treasure seal was smashed downwards once again!The aura around Li Changshou\u2019s body trembled. He revealed his Essence Immortal cultivation level and forcefully pushed away the ripples around him. Once again, he avoided the seal by a close shave!There was anger in his eyes. He growled, \u201cDon\u2019t force me to attack with the sword!\u201dIn the air, the middle-aged Daoist, whose cultivation level was at the early-stage of Perfected Immortal Realm, laughed coldly. He put away the seal before throwing it at Li Changshou\u2019s forehead again.The four of them used their Dharma spells and divine powers again to seal the corner that Li Changshou was retreating towards\u2026In the Primordial world, smashing someone else with a brick was a form of assault that had prevailed for a long time.All of a sudden, the Dao Requital cultivator who had the weakest cultivation level among them, shouted in a trembling voice, \u201cLittle\u2026\u201dThe few of them looked over and at the same time, their vision became blurry.The Perfected Immortal who was in the air turned pale. Just as he was about to turn around and fly away, he staggered and fell from the sky!The four people on the ground fell even faster, and they instantly lied on the ground in the forest.Li Changshou waved his left hand, and the Sky Treasure Umbrella rose in the sky, forming an isolation array formation.Li Changshou, who had been grabbing the hilt of his sword, stopped in his tracks. He suddenly rushed forward and finally pulled out his long\u2026 sword?It was not a sword!Half of the sword was at the bottom of the hilt. The sword blade had no edge, but the tip of the sword was made of seven Dharma treasure ropes!Li Changshou swung the strange sword, and the rope on it instantly lengthened. It was like Qi Yuan\u2019s whisk. In the blink of an eye, he had tied up the Perfected Immortal who had yet to land on the ground!Li Changshou casually pulled the rope and the five figures instantly gathered in front of him!At the same time, three paper effigies jumped out from Li Changshou\u2019s sleeve. Before they landed on the ground, they turned into three sullen-faced old Daoists.Paper Effigy No. 1 took out a Demon-Suppressing Wooden Fish while Paper Effigy No. 2 held onto a Soul-Conquering Golden Bell and took out two cans of Immortal-Incinerating Powder. Paper Effigy No. 3 acted like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey\u2026They landed in front of Li Changshou and Paper Effigy No. 2 immediately sprinkled the Immortal-Burning Powder. Paper Effigy No. 3 took away their storage Dharma treasures.A few balls of True Samadhi Flames darted out of Li Changshou\u2019s palm and reached between the five of them.The flames instantly expanded\u2026The wooden fish sounded, the bell rang, and the chant sounded.Li Changshou\u2019s gaze was fixed in the direction of the town. He noticed that there seemed to be some people looking in his direction, but no one came over.He scanned his surroundings with his immortal senses and was on guard. The Soul-Bewitching Pearls that he threw out began to rotate rapidly, absorbing the souls of five people at once.Ever since he counterattacked, there was only a pile of ashes left in front of him. It had not even been ten minutes.Li Changshou activated the Earth Escape technique and stabbed the sword back into the scabbard on his back. The paper effigies jumped back into his sleeve one after another.The few pieces of Dharma treasures on the ground that had been half-destroyed by the True Samadhi Flames were also stored in a treasure pouch that was especially used for storing trash.At the final step, Li Changshou\u2019s sleeves trembled. The ashes drifted in the wind and transformed into nutrients for the plants and vegetation.After retracting the improved Sky Treasure Umbrella, he stepped into the quicksand on the ground, and his figure flew towards the north.The people who were investigating the place only managed to catch a glimpse of his back view as he left, as well as the words he muttered to himself\u2026\u201cI told you not to force me to draw my sword.\u201dThis sword cultivator is so powerful\u2026\u2026Li Changshou thought to himself that the paper effigies\u2019 immortal power reserves were still quite rich. Hence, he first traveled 10,000 kilometers to the north, then turned to the east and took a stroll before returning to the Immortal Du Sect.The situation was really dangerous\u2026Fortunately, the Perfected Immortal was careless and underestimated his opponent. He was used to using Dharma treasures to attack others. Before he could unleash much of his strength, he was defeated by the poisonous powder that he had released.Now, Li Changshou already had a drug that could replace the Soft Immortal Disperser\u2014 Soul Intoxication Powder.There were a total of six types of poisonous powder that were released when he drew his sword. When the Perfected Immortal fell from the sky, half of his body was already dead. In the end, he was engulfed by the True Samadhi Flames. His Primordial Spirit was still trembling.If I was that careless, I would have died.Li Changshou sighed and gave himself a warning.He won and felt the joy of getting their assets for no reason.There was actually nothing to be happy about. After all, the fact that he was being targeted by others, meant that he was still not steady enough and was too reckless.I shall go back and write a reflection letter. Next time, I\u2019ll ask Master to come out for a few more days.However\u2026Looking at the treasure pouches in his sleeve, which were filled with spiritual herbs, poisonous herbs, and young spiritual beasts, he reckoned that he would be busy for three to five years.He wanted to become rich!He wanted to have more money to protect Dao!Li Changshou rushed all the way back to the forest at the time that he had settled on.The paper effigy quickly placed the square box inside the soil. He looked at his Sensing Stone and realized that it was glistening a little.Li Changshou soon found his master, who was hiding five kilometers away, and sent a voice transmission. \u201cMaster, please retract your immortal senses.\u201dQi Yuan, who was curiously sizing up the paper effigy, immediately responded and retracted his immortal senses.The diamond-shaped immortal stone was no longer shining.The paper effigy slowly shrugged his shoulders and mumbled, \u201cLittle\u2026 Little\u2026 Little\u2026\u201dWisps of immortal light surrounded the thickened paper effigy which reappeared again. The small cloth bag on its shoulder was bulging. It nimbly jumped into the box and put on the lid.\u201cAlright, Master. Take back the box. Just pretend that nothing happened and return to the mountain. Next time, let\u2019s find a suitable reason to come out for a walk.\u201dThe old Daoist priest Qi Yuan chuckled. He rode a cloud and took away the square box.Li Changshou\u2019s conscious returned to his original body in the Pill Chamber. He immediately heaved a long sigh of relief.That feeling of being fragile, helpless, weak, and pitiful finally disappeared.The main body is still the most comfortable\u2026 and safe.\u2026What exactly will Senior Changshou like?In the Heaven-Breaking Peak of the Immortal Du Sect, not far from where the Jiuyi Jiu Xian lived, was a cave abode on a rock wall.The exterior of the cave abode looked ordinary, but the interior was very exquisite.As soon as he entered the cave abode, he found himself in an elegant \u2018Hall\u2019. On his left, he could see a ten-feet-long lotus pond. The bottom of the pond was covered in spiritual jade. The water in the pond emitted a bright glow and there were one or two carps under the lotus leaves.On the right was a spacious guest room. There were meditation cushions, seats, and a partition. There were curtains on both sides, and there were murals of mountains and rivers on the walls.As he continued to explore, he discovered that there were two forks. One of them led to the owner of the abode, where the Perfected Immortal Jiang Jingshan cultivated and lived.The other led to the room of Youqin Xuanya, Jiang Jingshan\u2019s personal disciple. She was the head disciple of the younger generation of the Immortal Du Sect.Youqin Xuanya, who had just woken up from her Dao Enlightenment state, was thinking about a question\u2026Master had previously said that exchanging gifts is an effective method for improving friendships.She wanted to give Senior Changshou a present and also wanted to receive a gift from him. That could prove that he treated her as a \u2018friend\u2019.Friends needed to constantly communicate and improve their friendship. A friendship where they could talk about everything was something that Youqin Xuanya yearned for.Unfortunately, she still\u2026 didn\u2019t have a single friend.My cultivation level is not high, so I only have the Earth Escape technique. If others find out, I\u2019m afraid I will become a laughing stock.Earth Escape.Youqin Xuanya blinked her eyes. As her eyelashes fluttered, she had already thought of something.She turned around and walked towards the wardrobe.The furnishings in the room were actually very simple, but the furniture was made of extraordinary materials.She took out a jewelry box from the wardrobe. As soon as she opened it, it shone brightly, and she could see many spiritual lights flashing.They were all rewards that her parents had given her before she went to the Immortal Du Sect to seek immortality.Although the mortal world in the Southern Continent was currently a chaotic place, the karma between the human emperors was too great. No Qi cultivators dared to interfere with the lives of the emperors.However, that did not stop the emperors from using various methods to obtain the Qi Refinement technique.Almost half of the human emperors in the mortal world had methods to increase their lifespans. Youqin Kingdom was a classic example of a place where immortals and mortals co-existed. From the emperor to the generals, all of them had cultivation levels that were comparable to a small immortal.Youqin Xuanya searched the jewelry box for a while and soon picked up a yellow pearl.It was not a Dharma treasure, but a pearl formed from spirit meridians. It contained the pure power of the Five Elements of Earth. Although it was not a valuable treasure, it had a certain effect on earth-type Dharma spells.The Earth Escape technique was also ordinary.Such heaven-made pearls were hundreds of times more precious than Dharma treasures and Dharma artifacts that offered the same effect.\u201cWill Senior think that the gift is too insignificant?\u201dYouqin Xuanya pondered for a while before making a decision. She took out a small brocade box and placed the pearl inside.After some thought, she took out another brocade handkerchief and hesitated for an hour before writing something on it \u2013 \u201cFor you, Senior Changshou.\u201dAfter covering the pearl with the square handkerchief, she closed the brocade box. She pursed her lips and smiled. Even her footsteps were much lighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis Perfected Immortal\u2026\u201cWhy is he even poorer than I was when I was transcending the tribulation?\u201dIn the secret underground chamber, Li Changshou looked at the seven or eight storage Dharma treasures in front of him. He took out the items inside one by one and placed them into the treasure pouch that sorted garbage.No matter how low the chances of him being recognized were, Li Changshou would not use those Dharma treasures that were his spoils.Of course, the first-grade Numinous Treasure was an exception.The problem was that the incapacitating agents and poisonous pills he used were also costly.They were all good things that would not be sold. A portion of the poisonous herbs came from Elder Wan Linyun and their value could not be calculated.The result of being tailed was actually\u2026 being disadvantaged.The Perfected Immortal did not have much wealth, which also reflected the embarrassing predicament of most itinerant cultivators.With the rise of the human race, the Dao Sect prospered, and Daoism was everywhere. The Immortal Sect emerged and controlled most of the resources.It was not easy for itinerant cultivators who did not rely on the Immortal Sect to maintain their daily cultivation and accumulate much wealth.At that time, Li Changshou had given the other party a chance to stop. It was purely because he could not bear to use the poisonous powder in his Dharma artifact. That was why he told them to stop\u2026If the other party stopped, he could just knock them unconscious. After all, pills that could kill Perfected Immortals were too expensive.However, they did not stop. They were very professional and decisive. He was determined to kill him and seize his treasures.That made Li Changshou feel very helpless.Superior-grade Spirit Stones might not be that attractive, but they felt that he might have had other treasures since he had those Superior-grade Spirit Stones of the Dao Realm\u2026That was the reason they wanted to give it a try.The matter taught Li Changshou a lesson. Firstly, he had to formulate a detailed trade plan to avoid being targeted again.Secondly, if he was tempted by someone else\u2019s treasure in the future and wanted to plot against them, he would have to think about the consequences that those guys faced for attacking him.\u201cNo matter how good a treasure is, you have to be alive to use them.\u201dThe Dharma treasures which were akin to trash could not be used at present. Once his refining skills improved, he might be able to use them.However, the more he came into contact with the restrictions of refining, the more he found the \u2018subject\u2019 to be profound. Moreover, there were not many shortcuts that he could take.If he wanted to modify or create restrictions, it would require him to conduct tens of thousands of years of research.Moreover, the most powerful Dharma treasures that surfaced in the Primordial Times were not refined using precious materials. They were naturally made.The pinnacle of Dharma treasure refinement was the Merit Postnatal Numinous treasure. It was more important to have merit.Instead of focusing on the path of refining, he might as well spend his energy on array formations and continue to pursue the flame coverage of \u201cminiaturization of array formation\u201d.He decided to focus on the types of storage Dharma artifacts and refining devices required by the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts.I\u2019d better spend my spare time and energy on refining pills and alchemy.His main profession?Of course, it was a\u2026 ahem, to seek Dao Enlightenment and Immortality!Li Changshou sat behind his desk and began to classify into groups, the spiritual herbs and poisonous herbs that he had obtained.Later, I\u2019ll refine pills and send some to Elder Wan Linyun.Although it seems a little pretentious, it\u2019s still a token of my appreciation.After he was done with his work, Li Changshou placed the Dharma artifact spheres that had suppressed the young spiritual beasts aside. He would take them to the spiritual beast enclosure for rearing later.There were two young spiritual beasts that were meant for Fairy. She had been complaining for a long time that most of the spiritual beasts were poisonous creatures and that it was difficult for her to even find a rabbit or a deer\u2026This time, Li Changshou gave her two spiritual beasts that looked and tasted good. If she was willing to raise them, they could become her pet. Otherwise, she could also eat them after a few years.Li Changshou took out the sword-shaped Dharma artifact that looked like a sword but was not actually one. It was a Dharma artifact known as the Poison Disperser. Li Changshou smiled calmly\u2026He went to the side and put on a pair of special poison-resistant gloves, a mask, and protective suits. He then grabbed a pair of self-made tweezers and some test tubes. He put the antidote pills in his hand and continued to work.In order to fight well, he had to refine his weapons before the battle.Everything was the same. The pleasure and gains had to come after hard work.\u2026After staying in the secret chamber for two days, Li Changshou left the Pill Chamber, only to find that the Little Qiong Peak was surprisingly rather lively today.His immortal senses had been lingering in the array formation around the Pill Chamber.Liu Yan\u2019er and Wang Qi, the pair of Dao companions, had come to visit Fairy for a chat over tea.Li Changshou knew what happened.After Fairy went to apologize the last time, Liu Yan\u2019er was afraid that she would think too much. Thus, she sent a long message to Fairy using a paper crane.The two of them grew closer and became familiar with each other.On the surface, Fairy\u2019s cultivation level had already reached the third-stage of the Soul Formation Realm. At such a young age, she had reached the standards of becoming a junior immortal.Since Fairy was grounded for twenty years, Liu Yan\u2019er had also come to the Little Qiong Peak to visit her a few times in the past few years.Today, Liu Yan\u2019er and her Junior Wang Qi visited Fairy together. However, apart from cultivating, they simply strolled around casually.However\u2026Li Changshou used his immortal senses to \u2018look\u2019 at the person sitting beside him. She was like a fairy formed from ice-blue snow lotus. She was Youqin Xuanya who was playing an Immortal Life Simulation with the three of them\u2026Why is she here?Has her cultivation level reached the second-stage of the Dao Requital Realm?Without Yuan Qing\u2019s harassment, would her cultivation level improve rapidly?Not bad. She\u2019s definitely going to be the head disciple of the current generation.However, it isn\u2019t appropriate for Youqin Xuanya to come to the Little Qiong Peak all the time. She is too dazzling, and every move of hers is being watched by everyone in the sect.Li Changshou pondered quietly.Since she was a guest, he could not chase her away. He could not offend the Sect Leader because of such a small matter.After coming out of the forest, Li Changshou walked straight back to his straw hut and did not hide his whereabouts.He activated the concealment array formation and changed into a Daoist robe. He sat under the huge sign hanging on the wall and quietly meditated to think about how he should solve the problem regarding Youqin Xuanya.Many Qi cultivators liked to hang signs with large words in their living quarters.For powerful mighty figures who had survived since the ancient times, they liked to hang the words \u2018Heaven and Earth\u2019.In the past tens of thousands of years, the Qi cultivators liked to hang signs that read \u2018Dao\u2019 or \u2018Great Dao\u2019.Those were quite common. The Qi cultivators would often hang the signs according to their preferences. Examples of some words on the signs would be \u2018calming\u2019, \u2018force\u2019, \u2018Xuan\u2019, and \u2018Miao\u2019.Some of the more odd ones would be \u2018return\u2019 or \u2018sister\u2019.The words on the sign that was hung on the wall behind Li Changshou were impressive. There were probably not many Qi cultivators who could be similar to him in the vast Primordial Times.The word \u2018stable\u2019 was written on the sign!\u201cSenior!\u201dFairy was waving her hands while standing outside the array formation\u2019s light wall.Li Changshou smiled helplessly, stood up, opened the door, and exited.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cSenior, come over, have some tea and chat! Senior Sister Youqin\u2026 has been waiting for you for a long time.\u201dFairy winked at him. They exchanged glances and understood what was going on.She thought Senior, Senior Sister Youqin is here to look for you again. I can\u2019t deal with her. You can do it yourself!Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired from refining pills just now. I want to rest. I saw that you guys were having fun, so I didn\u2019t disturb you.\u201dYouqin Xuanya immediately took two steps forward towards the straw hut.She said, \u201cSenior Changshou, you can rest if you\u2019re tired. I don\u2019t have anything important to do. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been in seclusion for too long and have been wandering around the sect. I want to seek your guidance.\u201dLi Changshou bowed to Youqin Xuanya and the other two. \u201cI apologize for my negligence. Please forgive me.\u201dThe three of them returned their greetings. Wang Qi and Liu Yan\u2019er said that it was alright.Liu Yan\u2019er seemed to have noticed something as she smiled playfully.Youqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes were extremely bright at that moment. There was a hint of hesitation on her usually sullen and beautiful face.However, she was not a shy person. Very quickly, she retrieved a brocade box from her bracelet and walked towards Li Changshou\u2026\u201cSenior Changshou, this is a gift for you.\u201dLi Changshou was stunned.He was still waiting for Youqin Xuanya to explain what the gift was for. Was she asking for a favor, or did she want to personally thank him for saving her life?In the end, Youqin Xuanya handed the brocade box over to him.There was not much expression on her beautiful, flawless face. However, there was a hint of nervousness in her eyes.Li Changshou was rendered speechless.Forget it. I can\u2019t blame her for being fond of me. It must be because of Moon Elder\u2019s mistake.However, he had to return to normal.Since he did not fancy her, he should not let her read too into things. If he did not solve the issue immediately, it would constantly cause chaos.\u201cThank you, Junior Youqin,\u201d Li Changshou replied with a smile and took the brocade box from her.He then took out a Dharma artifact sphere that was suppressing the young spiritual beasts and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t prepare anything because I was in a hurry. This is a gift for you, Junior. Please don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Okay!\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s lips curled up slightly as she held the little spiritual beast Dharma artifact sphere in her palm.\u201cThank you, Senior Changshou.\u201dAt the side, Fairy could not help but purse her lips. However, she did not say anything.Li Changshou held onto the brocade box and said slowly,\u201dI gained a lot from my trip to the Northern Continent with you, Junior Youqin. From now on, if you have nothing to do, you can come to the Little Qiong Peak. Fairy and I don\u2019t have many good friends in the sect. Other than Junior Wang Qi and Senior Sister Yan\u2019er, we only interact with Uncle-Master Jiu Jiu and Uncle-Master Jiu Wu, who are seniors and experts.\u201d\u201cJunior Youqin, if you don\u2019t mind, you and I can be fellow disciples and good friends.\u201dHearing that, Wang Qi and Liu Yan\u2019er immediately understood something. Both of them were puzzled.Logically speaking, being able to obtain Youqin Xuanya\u2019s affection would be a great opportunity for Li Changshou. Why did he reject her so decisively?Wang Qi suddenly understood and thought to himself, It is probably because their cultivation levels are not on the same level. Senior Changshou feels that he is far inferior to this head disciple, so he rejected her\u2026 that should be it.Fairy felt helpless.Her senior\u2019s troublesome character\u2026Although Fairy was quite happy that her senior had rejected other female Qi cultivators, especially Youqin Xuanya, that also meant that if she wanted to win his heart, she would have a hard time taking the crucial step.Senior, what kind of girls do you like?Fairy was puzzled.However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, Youqin Xuanya actually smiled knowingly when she heard Li Changshou\u2019s words!Her gaze was rather lively. Although she did not show much emotion, everyone could sense that she was in a good mood.It was not a fake smile, but a genuine one that came from the bottom of her heart.Her beautiful face was flushed red, which made Fairy, a female cultivator feel tempted.\u201cReally?\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s tone became a little more serious.Even her tone was happy\u2026\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Changshou nodded with a smile, but he was puzzled.I\u2019ve already made it so clear and obvious. Does Youqin not understand?Youqin Xuanya immediately cupped her hands and lowered her head. She said firmly, \u201cSenior, please give me your guidance from now on!\u201cJunior Sister Fairy, please advise me! I will definitely come over often!\u201dUh?A few question marks appeared in Li Changshou\u2019s head.Wait a minute, I\u2019m a little confused about this situation\u2026On the other side, Wang Qi scratched the back of his head. Liu Yan\u2019er was confused.Fairy, on the other hand, felt a huge ripple in her heart. Her eyes flickered, and she felt a sense of pity for him.Is she that lowly?Senior Sister Youqin actually\u2026 just wanted to be friends with Senior. Is she not going to ask for anything else?Compared to her, I\u2019m so much more blissful\u2026 I get to be around him everyday\u2026I\u2019m so fortunate\u2026\u201cSenior Sister.\u201d Ling\u2019e took two steps forward and bowed to Youqin Xuanya. \u201cPlease guide me from now on!\u201dLi Changshou could not help but tilt his head.Why are these two forging ties? It\u2019s going to be terrible if they become equally toxic!\u201cYes.\u201d Youqin Xuanya nodded with a smile, her eyes twinkling.Seeing that Li Changshou\u2019s expression was a little sullen, she quickly said, \u201cSenior Changshou, please rest well. When I come out of seclusion again, I\u2019ll come and visit you. Please do not force yourself to cultivate and refine pills.\u201d\u201cYou too, Junior Sister Fairy\u2026\u201d\u201cIn this case, I\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, take care. Come here often.\u201d\u201cYes, definitely!\u201dYouqin Xuanya bade farewell to Wang Qi and Liu Yan\u2019er. She rode on a cloud and drifted away. It was as if her hair that was fluttering in the wind had become much livelier.On the other hand, Wang Qi and Liu Yan\u2019er expressed that they were too shocked, so they took their leave as well.Li Changshou frowned as he watched the three of them leave.He really could not figure out a way to deal with the toxic girl\u2026Didn\u2019t I explain clearly just now?In the future, we\u2019re going to be fellow disciples and good friends. Doesn\u2019t that mean that I\u2019m rejecting her romantically?This\u2026She must be poisoned!\u201cStinky Senior, where is my gift?!\u201dLi Changshou took out another spiritual beast sphere from his sleeve and handed it to his junior sister. He stood still, doubting everything that happened.Fairy praised, \u201cSenior Sister Youqin is so beautiful. Her cultivation level is also very high.\u201d\u201cHeh, hehe.\u201d Li Changshou sighed. He felt a little helpless about Youqin Xuanya. \u201cHow can it not be high?\u201cWith her personality, she probably won\u2019t encounter any mental demons in her life.\u201dFairy was confused. \u201cHuh? Why? Didn\u2019t you say that if the Dao Heart is unstable, the demons would appear at any time?\u201dLi Changshou looked up at the sky. He could not give a specific answer.\u201cIt\u2019s probably destiny.\u201dBeside him, Fairy had already started to unseal the Dharma artifact sphere. Very quickly, she exclaimed in admiration and took out the young spiritual beast inside.\u201cWow! So cute! Is this\u2026 the son of the Hundred-Toothed Golden Beast? Thank you, Senior!\u201d\u201cYes, as long as you like it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He built a small water enclosure for the pink bamboo rat, which could swallow most of the low-quality materials. He then added two layers of simple array formations to restrict its movement.Fairy would go to the spiritual beast enclosure thrice a month. Most of the spiritual beasts could absorb the Heaven and Earth Primordial Energy and would not starve to death.Li Changshou placed the Earth Spirit Pearl that Youqin Xuanya had given him, in an eye-catching spot of the Pill Chamber. He did not carry it with him.This treasure is exorbitant.In the future, he would be able to create the array discs of the Five-Element Array with four other treasures of the same quality.For now, it was not very useful.Li Changshou still did not understand why Youqin Xuanya was there\u2026Forget it.He could only say that she had lived up to her toxicity.When she comes to Little Qiong Peak again, I\u2019ll just rest in the Pill Chamber and get Fairy to play, chat, and drink tea with me.After the trivial incident, Li Changshou stayed put in the Pill Chamber and began to refine pills.Money is the most important thing.He had done some simple research when he went to Linhai Town previously.The pills that he was refining at this moment were the mainstream pills that the itinerant cultivators required. The pills had healing effects and would heal and improve the user\u2019s physical state. It would also assist in breaking through bottlenecks.The low-level elixirs could be used by cultivators at the Void Return Stage. They could also satisfy the daily needs of high-end Itinerant Immortals.He did it for the sake of earning more money and for quicker sales to ensure profitability.Based on Li Changshou\u2019s rich experience in alchemy, the success rate was not low.Most of the Qi cultivators relied on their intuition and experience to refine pills. The words \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018quantifiable\u2019 in the pill formula were an eyesore to them, just like the little genies that often went to the Southern Continent for a walk\u2026Li Changshou was already prepared for it.When he first came into contact with alchemy, he continuously wrote summaries of his notes and he would also continuously try to figure out the exact amount of ingredients needed for the pill formula.He also used the duration of the pill refinement as a limit. He recorded the changes in the temperature during the pill refinement, wrote down the order of placement of the herbs, the age of the herbs, the size of the cut, and so on. He then found the perfect plan\u2026That would guarantee the success rate!While he was refining the mainstream pills, Li Changshou also planned to refine some advanced pills that were on the same level as the upper limit of his current level.Spirit Pills of Rank One and Rank Two.Ordinary immortal pills were only divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower grades.Middle-grade immortal pills were bestsellers in the town. Many immortals who were not good at alchemy would purchase them in bulk.Pills that surpassed immortal pills would be called Spirit Pills that had varying ranks from one to nine.However, the ones that could be called Spirit Pills were all treasures.At the same time, the Nine Revolution Golden Pill was the signature sign of the Ren Sect Leader transforming into a Grand Supreme ElderHence, the inheritors of the Ren Sect were all good at alchemy. However, Li Changshou did not dare to use the unique pill formula of Ren Sect, because it would increase the difficulty\u2026There was nothing he could do about it.Li Changshou\u2019s plan for refining pills was simple.He decided to reject the cost-effective route and prioritize the improvement of the quality of the elixir.At first, he lowered the price slightly and tried to break into the pill industry of Linhai Town.Once it\u2019s stable, I guarantee all my pills will be in high demand and sell out in all stores!Although he could refine Spirit Pills, he did not dare to buy too many ten-thousand-year-old spirit herbs because he had yet to guarantee the success rate of the pill refinement.He would only use the remaining spirit herbs and take a gamble after it was guaranteed that he would profit from the middle-grade pills.Money had to be earned in a stable manner.\u2026After refining the precious materials that he had exchanged this time, into the foundation of the array formation, he \u201cplumped up\u201d the Recovery Array of Little Qiong Peak.Li Changshou kept his schedule full and maximized all 24 hours in a day.He would spend six hours on Dao enlightenment, four hours on perfecting the mystical abilities of the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts, two hours on reading ancient books, and increasing his knowledge. For the remaining six hours, he would enter the Pill Chamber and focus on refining pills.Since he was going to sell that batch of pills outside of the sect, he need not worry about attracting attention from the sect\u2026The feeling was very similar to how he felt when he first came into contact with alchemy and figured out a bunch of equations. Back then, he barely slept and would hold onto the small Pill Furnace even when he was meditating.He would stay awake through sunrise and sunset.When Li Changshou focused on refining pills and cultivating, he did not notice the passage of time.That was what cultivation was like.The time seemed to have become very slow. He did not need to be as anxious as mortals who had to get busy to make ends meet or work for three meals a day and a roof over his head. He did not need to worry that his lifespan would only be a hundred years.Once in a while, he would get tired from pill refinement. He would then take a walk in the mountains, look around, tease his junior, and take care of the spiritual fish in the lake, spiritual beasts in the mountains, and herbs in the fields\u2026He was extremely satisfied with this life.The month had passed.His heart was filled with calmness.He made himself become stable\u2026In the Primordial world, there were four distinct seasons, only in the Southern Continent. Other than the North Continent, most places were in spring all year round.Li Changshou had spent more than three years refining the pills.The paper effigy was even more perfect. It had three to four obvious flaws. For example, the paper effigy\u2019s face could finally change according to his mood.Moreover, through the stupid way of thickening the paper effigy and increasing the restrictions, Li Changshou managed to increase the power that the paper effigy could exert to the level of a Perfected ImmortalThis way, he would be able to gain more security.Li Changshou was prepared to wait for his master to come out of seclusion before discussing with him his plan to make his master walk out of the Mountain-protection array formation for a while. He would then use the paper effigy to go to Linhai Town for the second time.When the paper effigy goes out this time, it will exhibit its cultivation level that is in the late-stage of the Essence Immortal.Of course, other than that, there are many other things to take note of\u2026Li Changshou sat on the rocking chair and sorted his thoughts. He took out a jade tablet and wrote down the various materials he needed to trade for this time.Once I successfully sell this batch of pills, the core of the Recovery Array can be improved and the Incapacitating Array outside the Pill Chamber will also be strengthened\u2026\u201cI wonder when Uncle-Master will come out of seclusion. I miss him quite a bit.\u201dLi Changshou took a look at the treasure pouch he had prepared for his Uncle-Master Jiu Jiu, which contained pleasant-tasting pills, as well as his favorite wine.I can bury the underground array formation myself but I still need Uncle-Master\u2019s help with the larger one on the surface.After listing the things that he had to do, Li Changshou stood up and stretched.Later, I\u2019ll visit Elder Wan Linyun and make preparations to leave.Sigh\u2026This fruitful, tiring, and leisurely cultivation period\u2026It would be good if I can keep it up.\u2026Hmph, these human Qi cultivators who have been blessed by heaven and earth are cultivating leisurely and discussing Dao everyday.In the Treasure Pool of the Golden Ao Island, a green dragon swam slowly in the pool with a hint of helplessness in its narrow eyes.At that moment, he was no longer the young dragon in his teens.However, there was some trauma that lingered in his heart and never dissipated.Gradually, Ao Yi felt uneasy when he saw the human-shaped old Daoist priest.He knew that he had already reached the Demonic-resistant realm, but he could not overcome it.He also had issues with his health because of that but he refused to face them.Not far away, there were a few Golden Immortals from the Jie Sect who were explaining the Great Dao of Longevity to the many immortals who had yet to mature.Ao Yi wanted to go over and listen, but there\u2026There were simply too many old Daoist masters.There were also a few people who had sullen expressions on their faces, which inevitably reminded him of some painful memories.Through his observation of the human Qi cultivators on the island over the years, Ao Yi had discovered many problems and had many more doubts.Sometimes, he wondered if he had misunderstood the human race.Was the sullen-faced old Daoist that I encountered back then an anomaly among humans?No, definitely not!Although the human Qi cultivators were friendly and happy every day, were in harmony with demons, spirits, and ghouls which they saw as their own and built a rapport with, they were in fact\u2026 filthy-hearted!On the surface, most human Qi cultivators would call him \u201cjunior\u201d and \u201cFellow Daoist\u201d.However, they secretly treated him, the Second Prince of the East Ocean, as a display piece!Is it a big deal to be the main character now\u2026In the past few years, there were a few dragon spirits on Golden Ao Island. Occasionally, they would chat with Ao Yi to comfort him.In terms of cultivation, the Great Black Clouds Immortal had imparted some immortal spells to him in his dream. After throwing two numinous treasures out of thin air, he did not bother about him anymore.Although his master didn\u2019t pay much attention to him, Ao Yi wasn\u2019t resentful towards him.Since he had escaped once, this was the price he had to pay.With the constant activation of the Dragon King\u2019s bloodline, Ao Yi\u2019s cultivation level had steadily reached the Primordial Immortal Realm. He had obtained even more dragon-type mystical abilities.It was not difficult for the dragons to transcend the Immortal Ascension. They could go into the Tribulation Cloud and rely on the Thunder Tribulation to change their scales.When will I be able to hear the sage speak?Ao Yi sighed in his heart.The Jie Sect was divided into inner and outer sects. There were only a few inner sect disciples who specialized in the Dao that the Sect Master of the Heaven Ascension Sect had passed down.The inner sect disciples of the Sage were the Daoist Duobao, Mother of Golden Spirit, Mother Wudang, Mother of Turtle Spirit, and a few of their disciples.It was impossible to count the number of outer sect disciples because there were simply too many of them.The four senior outer sect disciples were Zhao Gongming, Yun Xiao, Bi Xiao, and Qiong Xiao. When the four of them became Sect Masters of the Heaven Ascension Sect, they already had their own Dao, so they were considered outer sect disciples.Those who had settled down and planted their roots in the Three Thousand Worlds were all disciples of the Heaven Ascension Sect.The Grandmaster of Heaven and his four inner sect disciples lived in Green Touring Palace all year round.Green Touring Palace was the Dao bearing of a Sage. It was said that only the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals could find it.There was a path to the Green Touring Palace on Golden Ao Island, but no one knew where it was.In any case, Ao Yi had secretly searched the entire Golden Ao Island, but he could not find Sage\u2019s trail.That meant that he wasn\u2019t fated.Due to the impartial teaching that existed in Jie Sect, there were more and more Dao inheritors in the three Daoist sects.Ao Yi had completely understood Ren Sect.This sect master himself was a Sage and a personal disciple of another Sage. However, the Chan Sect and Jie Sect dared not provoke him at all. The ones who taught Daoism in the Central Deity Continent were common and no one dared to offend them.The Grand Pure One was the head of the six Sages and was also known as the strongest ancestor.If I had persevered a little back then and risked my life to learn Dao, I might have been able to get some luck for the dragon race and find a way out.As for the Immortal Du Sect\u2026At that moment, Ao Yi despised it a little.The Immortal Du Sect did belong to Ren Sect and there were also Dao inheritors of the Sage. However, they were not very powerful and there were no experts who were famous in the sect.After listening to the sutras mentioned by the Golden Immortals, Ao Yi sighed in his heart and slowly sank to the bottom of the pool.He curled up in the corner and cultivated quietly.I can\u2019t sleep. If I do, I\u2019ll get nightmares and dream of being slaughtered and treated like food.The more Ao Yi found out, the more he realized how deep and terrifying the water was during the Primordial Times.The Dragon-Phoenix Tribulation not only destroyed the dragons, but also the true experts of the dragon race.The Saints of Heaven and Earth were in power and the dragons can only retreat from the world. The human race and the Dao Sect were the main characters of the world.His previous thoughts were indeed a little childish.There\u2019s no point feeling ashamed while in hindsight.You can never awaken a dragon pretending to be drunk.However, in order to make the dragon race prosper again, the only way was to let the descendants of the dragon race enter the Sage Court.What should I, Ao Yi, do?Actually, he had developed a good idea a few years ago.Become famous.As long as he could become the Crown Prince of the Dragon Palace, become a disciple of the sect, and rise to fame, he would be able to influence the thoughts of his clansmen and slowly make them swallow their pride\u2026That would be the opportunity for him to alter his fate and was something he could do.While he was cultivating, Ao Yi suddenly heard two cultivators passing by the pool. They were having a conversation.\u201cThis time, I\u2019m going to a few Immortal Sects in the Eastern Continent to discuss Dao. According to the old and crude rules of these Immortal Sects, we might have to let the young disciples compete again. I don\u2019t have any young disciples\u2026\u201dAo Yi, who was at the bottom of the pool, was shocked. He waved his tail and his body shrunk rapidly. At the same time, he emerged from the pool.The Azure Dragon emerged from the water, its azure scales glistening.The two Heavenly Immortal cultivators turned to take a look, only to see that the Azure dragon had transformed into an elegant young man. He slowly descended from the sky and bowed to them.\u201cFellow\u2026 Fellow Daoists,\u201d said Ao Yi. He continued, \u201cI would like to get an eyeopener. I have been cultivating for a short period of time, so I can be considered a young disciple of Jie Sect.\u201dHe had no choice. He was the disciple of the Black Clouds Immortal There were too many Qi cultivators on the Golden Ao Island, and he was often confused about their seniority.The young man looked like he was thirteen or fourteen years old\u2026He did not know what was going on. Ever since he had been tricked by those old Daoists, his human form and body\u2026 stopped growing.The two Heaven Immortals of Jie Sect looked at each other and quickly greeted him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qi Yuan wore a long robe and carried a horsetail whisk. He floated from the Little Qiong Peak to the opening.Qi Yuan bowed and answered, \u201cI\u2019m just going out for a walk, nothing much. Recently, I\u2019ve been feeling uneasy.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dThe old Perfected Immortal guarding the gate did not probe further. He smiled kindly and opened the gate, letting Qi Yuan ride the cloud towards the sky outside the mountain.Qi Yuan was quite famous on the mountain because he had conducted a Deliverance by Execution and become a Turbid Immortal.However, his reputation was not always good. Occasionally, people would mock him.After Li Changshou finished refining that batch of pills, he waited for another four months before his master came out of seclusion and went out for a stroll.He discussed the matter with his master. This time, he asked his master to stay out for a few more days and give the paper effigy more time to operate.After that, Li Changshou repeatedly reminded his master not to stray too far from the sect\u2026In order to allow his master to hide his tracks, Li Changshou offered the second version of the Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra to his master. He did not want his master to be targeted and schemed against while he was waiting for his return.Li Changshou\u2019s main body was also in the mountain gate. If something happened to his master, he would be able to detect it and rush over to help.It was Li Changshou\u2019s decision to let his master and junior sister have the same level of access to the information.Qi Yuan put the box away and left quietly.The paper effigy appeared once again. It was obvious that he was a little bloated. The sling bag on his shoulder had also been replaced by a backpack.This time, Li Changshou transformed into an old Daoist priest and decided to sell pills using that identity in the future.He exhibited Earth Escape and the paper effigy quickly rushed to Linhai Town.Half a day later, Li Changshou walked half a round in the direction of the east. He changed the shape of his route from an exclamation mark to a question mark.Finally, he emerged from an empty forest on the west side. He rode a cloud, carried his sword, and floated towards the magnificent town in front of him.The style and color of the sword, sword hilt, and sword sheath that was hung on his back had all been changed. The scabbard had a new restriction that would isolate immortal senses.Of course, the core function would not change.It looked like a sword, but in reality, it was a Dharma artifact that was made of a mixture of incapacitating agents and poison dispersers. It could produce colorless poison powder without anyone noticing. It could also be used to poison the enemy\u2019s Essence Soul and organs without anyone noticing. That would increase the chances of killing a Perfected Immortal.Naturally, he could not find that outside. Just like the Sky Treasure Umbrella, it was Li Changshou\u2019s personal Dharma treasure.This time, Li Changshou had prepared a second Dharma artifact that was similar.It was a flute that would release poison through the holes when it was being played. However, there was a hidden danger.He had to take a deep breath. Otherwise, it would be easy for him to draw in the poison.Otherwise, it would really be as funny as a person warning others not to touch the poisonous sword that would kill anyone who was in contact with it, even though he was holding onto it.There were four entrances to the array formation in the town, just like the city gates of the mortal world. However, the entrance where he was at, was left behind by the array formation and was not one of the city walls.The authority in charge of maintaining peace in that place was the Great Immortal Sect of the East Continent, the Linhai Sword Sect. According to the primordial rules, they would send people to collect the \u201centrance fee\u201d in front of the array formation.The fee could be in the form of Spirit Stones, treasures, precious materials, or spirit herbs. It could be anything of a little value.A small town of this scale could actually bring a lot of benefits to the Immortal Sect. However, they usually had to station a large number of masters there in order to prevent anyone from stirring trouble. They also had to be mighty figures.The Immortal Du Sect had tried to build a small town in the past. However, because of their geographical location and poor management, they did not manage it well.The town only existed for a few thousand years, and since then there were no lone cultivators staying there or visiting the town. The Immortal Du Sect had suffered major losses.Li Changshou understood that.After all, the people in the sect had cultivated the \u2018Inaction Sutra\u2019 and the disciples liked to be quiet. They would spend any energy they had on finding Dao companions\u2026After teasing his own master in his heart, Li Changshou manipulated the paper effigy to reveal his cultivation in the late-stage of the Essence Immortal. He then rode the cloud and waited behind a dozen figures.On the side, there was a steady stream of people going out. Most of them were floating on clouds.There was no need to pay tolls when they went out. If they wanted to go in again, they would have to queue up and pay the entrance fee.When it was almost Li Changshou\u2019s turn to enter the sect, he caught a glimpse of seven or eight figures who were about to leave the town\u2026They were two elderly cultivators, three middle-aged cultivators, and three young men and women.They flew a little higher than the others and were about to fly out through the gap in the array formation. Two pairs of immortal soldiers patrolling around Linhai Town were guarding them. They were very domineering.Li Changshou\u2019s attention was actually attracted by the young man.This person\u2026 has horns on his head but\u2026 no tail\u2026Ao Yi?Why have I run into this little dragon again?Li Changshou was speechless. Am I fated with this little dragon?But then again, why is this little dragon\u2026 still the same as when he was defeated previously? Its height is the same too.Maybe, dragons go through longer puberty periods than humans do. He probably still hasn\u2019t developed much yet.The paper effigy looked away and it happened to be his turn to pay the entrance fee.Li Changshou handed the Spirit Stones in his hand to the female immortal seated behind the table.The female immortal smiled and said, \u201cFellow Daoist, you seem to be a stranger. Can you tell me why you are here?\u201dHence, Li Changshou introduced himself using a fake name and said that he was there to buy some pills and herbs. The female immortal noted the information down and allowed him to enter the town.During this process, Ao Yi and the two girls followed behind the five Heaven Immortals of Jie School and ascended above the paper effigy\u2026The five Heaven Immortals were in a good mood. They were discussing whether they should return to Golden Ao Island or continue to discuss the Dao with the immortals of their sect.Li Changshou heard one of the old Daoist priests giving Ao Yi a compliment.\u201cHow long have you been cultivating, Junior Ao Yi? You\u2019ve actually already become an Essence Immortal. You do live up to the reputation of the Dragon King. Your potential is astonishing\u2026\u201dJunior?Indeed, Ao Yi had become a disciple of Jie School, and he should have been taken under the wing of a second-generation expert.At that moment, Li Changshou felt that Ao Yi had become much more mature. His gaze was restrained and his expression was calm.Although he was still a teenager, he still looked steady, composed, experienced, and tempered by fate.However\u2026 it had nothing to do with Li Changshou.The paper effigy entered Linhai Town and rode a cloud, flying past lofts and stone houses as he headed to the place where medicine shops were rampant.I have to snatch business from my sect again.Li Changshou sighed.Medicine was the main business of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s shop in the town.However, he would only visit that place for a few days, once every few years. Although it would affect his sect\u2019s business to a certain extent, it should not cause the sect\u2019s business to be poor.After all, he was just an individual peddler.Although his goods were of high quality and were sold in large quantities at low prices\u2026\u2026After the Qi Refinement cultivators of the Golden Ao Island left the town, they flew in the southwest direction. They then changed directions all of a sudden and sped towards the northwest.In fact, the experts of a few Immortal Sects in the Eastern Continent had invited the Heaven Immortals whom they were familiar with, from the Golden Ao Island.Golden Ao Island was a rather well-known teaching venue of Jie School, where Qi Refinement cultivators would be invited for a discussion about the Dao by some immortal sects.Originally, they had already gone out to discuss the Dao for three months. They had been eating and drinking for free at the few immortal sects in the East Continent\u2026 Ahem, they had been preaching and reading scriptures\u2026This trip is complete. It\u2019s time to return.Since Ao Yi had performed extremely well during the Dao discussion, he easily defeated the Essence Immortals sent by the few immortal sects.Furthermore, Ao Yi\u2019s seniority was the same as the five Jie School Heaven Immortals, so they could not directly reward him.Thus, they brought Ao Yi to Linhai Town where they chose many gifts for him.Ao Yi distributed those gifts to the two young Apprentice-Nieces beside him, who were elated. The few Golden Ao Island Heaven Immortals were quite pleased too.If the son of a Great Immortal Sect\u2019s Sect Leader was said to own a treasure vault, Ao Yi, the Crown Prince of the Dragon Palace in the East Ocean could be considered as having his home in a vault.Ao Yi did not feel the pinch at all when he gifted the disciples of the few \u201csenior brothers\u201d to make them happy.If necessary, he would take out a voice transmission talisman and inform his family about his plans. He would then be able to give every Qi Refinement cultivator of Golden Ao Island a generous gift tomorrow.After leaving the town, the group wanted to visit Golden Ao Island.However, Ao Yi pondered for a moment. After a few moments of silence, he suddenly said, \u201cSenior Brothers, I have a request.\u201dThe five of them immediately turned around and looked at Ao Yi with concern.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an unreasonable request. If there\u2019s a request, there must be a response. Junior Brother Ao Yi, just speak your mind.\u201d\u201cThe Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island are on good terms with each other. We are inseparable and we share the same glory and humiliation!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not just so for us in Golden Ao Island. It\u2019s the same for everyone in Jie School. If any one of us is in trouble, everyone will come to help!\u201dAo Yi smiled in his heart, but his expression was still very serious. He said in a low voice, \u201cActually, I have a hidden secret.\u201dThe two girls at the side looked over instantly, their eyes glistening.One of the young girls had her hair in a dozen braids that made her look suave and cute. She was Han Zhi, who had witnessed Li Changshou\u2019s tribulation.Among the five Heaven Immortals, one of them was Han Zhi\u2019s master, the old Daoist priest Yuan Ze.Ao Yi sighed. \u201cDuring the Demon-Sweeping Meet in the East Ocean back then, I was only ten years old. I was ordered to help the Dragon Palace find someone to spar with, but I lost to a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect who was in the Void Return stage. I haven\u2019t been able to let this matter go.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI have already transcended the tribulation to become an immortal. Although I am only at the Essence Immortal realm, I still want to spar with that person and discuss the Dao.\u201d\u201cIs that it?\u201d Yuan Ze asked with a smile.A look of shame appeared on Ao Yi\u2019s face. He lowered his head and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d replied another middle-aged Daoist who smiled. With a wave of his hand, the white cloud drifted towards the Immortal Du Sect. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go to Immortal Du Sect for a walk.\u201dDaoist Zhong Yu, the Deputy Sect Master of the Immortal Du Sect, had a good relationship with him.\u201cThe Immortal Du Sect is a subsidiary of the Ren School. The Golden Ao Island is also the teaching venue for the Jie School. Why can\u2019t we pay a visit?\u201dThe others agreed.One of them smiled and said, \u201cShould we inform them in advance? Otherwise, something awkward will happen.\u201dThe old Daoist priest, Yuan Ze, waved his hand and said, \u201cNo need, no need for that. We\u2019re not looking for them for a fight. Let\u2019s discuss the Dao and let the young people spar.\u201dAt the end of the line, the two young girls who were holding hands looked at each other.A young girl activated the bracelet-shaped Dharma artifact on her wrist so as to prevent their conversation from being overheard.She said softly, \u201cHan Zhi, your master is doing it again.\u201dHan Zhi pursed her lips and said gloomily, \u201cMake some preparations.\u201d\u201cSigh, my master is as good as a Heavenly Dao artifact. When I was undergoing the Tribulation Transcendence, Master told me not to worry and that I would only have six Heavenly Tribulations. However, I ended up summoning eight Heavenly Tribulations. I almost died\u2026 My aptitude and accumulation should be at most seven.\u201dThe other girl immediately covered her mouth and chuckled. \u201cYou also benefited from this and ascended for a while.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of this\u2026\u201d Han Zhi seemed to be in a daze. She continued, \u201cI experienced eight Heavenly Tribulations personally, and it was the eight Heavenly Tribulations that were ranked at the bottom. Only then did I know how terrifying this Immortal Ascension Tribulation was. I can\u2019t imagine what kind of person it was for him to survive nine Heavenly Tribulations in the South Sea that day.\u201d\u201cIt must have been the reincarnation of an ancient, powerful figure.\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201dThe two girls chuckled. Soon, the topic was shifted onto the young man of the dragon race in front of them.He looked like a delicate and handsome young man, which made the young girl very happy.Half a day later, the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s thin and smooth mountain-protecting array formation could be seen. The group of people drifted over while chatting and laughing.The smile on Ao Yi\u2019s lips had a deeper meaning.\u2026\u201cEh?\u201dIn the forest on the mountain, Qi Yuan, who was thinking about the \u201cQi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra\u201d, looked up at the sky and saw the Golden Ao Island floating above the clouds.He felt the pressure of a few Heaven Immortals and felt a little puzzled. He did not know where those masters had come from and why they were going to the Immortal Du Sect.\u201cIt has nothing to do with Little Qiong Peak.\u201dQi Yuan smiled and looked at the transmission talisman his eldest disciple had given him. He also felt that it was probably just a few experts who had come to visit him together, so he did not tell Li Changshou about it.He continued to ponder over the hidden Qi technique that was created by his disciple.Very quickly, the Daoist priest, Qi Yuan, restrained his aura completely. He excitedly cast a Manifestation Spell and turned into a tree stump.After carefully detecting for a while\u2026\u201cIndeed. It\u2019s surprisingly safe.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At that moment, his mental state was no longer the same as when he was ten years old.He was there to look for Li Changshou.Ao Yi didn\u2019t even know Li Changshou\u2019s name and Li Changshou\u2019s exact status in the Immortal Du Sect.However, Ao Yi knew that he had to get back at the Immortal Du Sect today!In the Demon-Sweeping Meet, Ao Yi was the one who performed alone but he credited his \u2018success\u2019 to Li Changshou.Ao Yi felt that if he wanted to make a name for himself, there should be no black marks on him. He had to reverse the results of the competition that happened when he was ten years old!He could use this opportunity to build an image and portray himself as a man who has become courageous after being ashamed. He could then fight with the most powerful cultivator in the younger generation of the Immortal Du Sect. He could challenge the strongest cultivator in the younger generation of all the Immortal Sects in the entire Eastern Continent. From then on, he would soar high in the sky\u2026He wanted to be the role model for the dragon race. He wanted to obtain their approval first.He wanted to set an example for the descendants of the dragon race and establish his influence!He would then think of a way to make the dragon race slowly let go of their pride. That was the only way to save the dragon race\u2026Ao Yi slowly took a deep breath and pondered about how he should speak later.His five seniors had already arrived outside the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s array formation. They did not leave the sect and simply released their auras.The Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island are here to cause trouble\u2026Ahem, to discuss the Dao!\u2026Seeing that the few Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island had suddenly come to pay a visit, everyone in the Immortal Du Sect was immediately alarmed by the sounds of the bell ringing.When the bell rang at first, all the Peak Leaders and elders who were not in seclusion rushed to the Heaven-Breaking Peak.However, the deputy Sect Leader and the elders felt that it was too grand. The few Qi Refinement cultivators were only there to visit their friends\u2026Golden Ao Island was a well-known teaching venue for Jie School in the Primordial World. Compared to them, the Immortal Du Sect was less famous and smaller.However, the Immortal Du Sect was still part of the Ren School. It would be embarrassing for them to be that flamboyant when welcoming a few unknown immortals.If the person who visited was a famous immortal from Jie School, such as the outer sect disciple, Zhao Gongming, who was cultivating in the Grotto-heaven on Mount Emei, the members of the Immortal Du Sect would naturally send all the immortals out to welcome him personally.However, a few Heaven Immortals arrived instead\u2026Soon, more than half of the Peak Leaders were sent back, leaving behind only ten-odd elders of the Heaven Immortal realm.The elders and the Deputy Sect Leader, Exalted Zhong Yu, led a few intelligent Perfected Immortals to entertain the Qi Refinement cultivators from Golden Ao Island.In the eyes of the elders, Jiu Wu was a clever \u2018junior\u2019.Following the elder\u2019s orders, Jiu Wu got busy. He invited eight people of Golden Ao Island to the Immortal Hall of the Heaven-Breaking Peak in the Immortal Du Hall and led a few disciples to offer incense.If there were guests at the Dragon Palace, the ones who served tea and water would be beautiful sea maidens.However, Immortal Du Sect did the opposite. The servers were all-male disciples who looked decent and had stable Dao foundations.That was probably the difference between a force and an immortal sect.After the guests were seated, the two of them looked at each other. Before they could even speak, they started to laugh loudly\u2026Jiu Wu was knowledgeable and knew that it was a regular routine. The longer he smiled more, the less hostile he would seem.There was nothing too enjoyable in the Primordial World.After laughing, the Deputy Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect, Zhong Yu, spoke first. \u201cFellow Daoists, you have truly brought glory to the Immortal Du Sect\u2026\u201dThe two of them exchanged a few pleasantries. The Qi Refinement cultivators stated that they were there to discuss the Dao with the members of the Immortal Du Sect.All the elders in the Immortal Du Sect smiled. Immediately, someone secretly invited a few elders with the highest cultivation level in the sect to support them.Preaching and discussing the Dao was a rather popular thing in the primordial world. In fact, each of them had their own understanding of the Dao and hence would just compete with each other, meet, and exchange pointers\u2026However, before the Dao discussion started, the group of people from the Jie School raised an absurd request to Jiu Wu\u2026A middle-aged Heaven Immortal slowly said, \u201cMy junior brother, Ao Yi, was just ten years old during the previous Demon-Sweeping Meet. He was sent by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace to compete with your disciple. In the end, he was defeated by your disciple.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThis time, my junior brother has transcended the tribulation and become an immortal. He wants to spar with that disciple of yours again. I wonder if that\u2019d be convenient.\u201dUpon hearing that, the elders of the Immortal Du Sect looked at each other. One of the elders smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a sparring session between the young juniors. It\u2019s not a big deal. However, Crown Prince Ao Yi is the son of the Dragon King. His cultivation level is definitely not comparable to the young disciples of the human race.\u201d\u201cNow that Crown Prince Ao Yi has become an immortal, there\u2019s no need for that. He doesn\u2019t necessarily have to spar with a young disciple of our sect.\u201dHearing that, Ao Yi immediately stood up and bowed to the elders of the Immortal Du Sect.\u201cTo be honest, I bore a grudge since that incident. I was afraid that it would turn into a problem that would hinder my cultivation in the future. That\u2019s why I decided to be thick-skinned and ask to spar with the disciple from the Immortal Du Sect again.\u201d\u201cWhen we are sparring, I will ask Senior Brothers to seal my cultivation realm.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThe few elders of the Immortal Du Sect looked troubled.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d The Deputy Sect Master, Exalted Zhong Yu, smiled and said, \u201cSomeone, call Xuanya over.\u201dA Perfected Immortal executive immediately received the order and turned around to leave the Immortal Du Hall in quick steps, heading towards the other side of the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Ao Yi recalled something and said, \u201cThe person who sparred with me that day should not be a disciple called Xuan Ya. I heard someone calling him\u2026 Changshou.\u201d\u201cChangshou?\u201d\u201cWhich peak is that disciple from?\u201dAt that moment, the few Heaven Immortal elders of the Immortal Du Sect, who had been in seclusion all year round, pinched their fingers and made some deductions. They looked puzzled.The other elders knew about the matter and smiled without saying a word.When Jiu Wu saw the situation, his mind was filled with thoughts.It seems that the Crown Prince from the Dragon Palace has joined the Jie School and is here to seek revenge on Disciple-Nephew Changshou!Changshou should only be at the eighth-stage of the Void Return realm. He is much weaker than Ao Yi whose dragon mystical abilities are quite powerful.There is no one behind Little Qiong Peak. If I don\u2019t explain and speak up for Little Changshou, Little Changshou might be tricked by this little dragon!With that thought in mind, Jiu Wu immediately stood up and bowed.He said loudly, \u201cChangshou is a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak and the eldest disciple of Junior Qi Yuan. I was the one who recommended him to go to the Demon-Sweeping Meet in the East Ocean previously. However, I heard from Ninth Junior Sister that Prince Ao Yi had won that sparring session. Disciple-Nephew Changshou missed and moved out of the boundary that was set!\u201dThe elders of the Immortal Du Sect, as well as the few Qi Refinement cultivators of the Golden Ao Island, looked at Ao Yi.Ao Yi muttered to himself with a gloomy expression as he sighed, \u201cNo, I lost. I lost in every aspect.\u201d\u201cI was injured by Daoist Changshou\u2019s talisman and had to rest for over a month. However, he was not injured. He must have intentionally given in to me so that the Dragon Palace wouldn\u2019t lose face. I came here today to look for Fellow Daoist Changshou to resolve this karma and thank him in person\u2026\u201dHis words were rather sincere but they also seemed to have other connotations.An elder from the Immortal Du Sect smiled and said, \u201cJiu Wu, go and call Changshou over.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Yes.\u201d Jiu Wu lowered his head and answered. He then turned around quickly and rode a cloud towards the Little Qiong Peak.While riding the cloud, Jiu Wu had already thought of many ways to deal with the situation.The elders in the sect definitely would not want to see their disciples lose.Ao Yi had sealed his own cultivation level. If he seals himself up to the level of the Grade Four Void Return realm, which Disciple-Nephew Changshou has disguised himself as, his cultivation level would be exposed to the Heaven Immortals on both sides during sparring. Wouldn\u2019t that ruin the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s reputation?I must persuade Disciple-Nephew Changshou to give up his plan to disguise himself. In the upcoming battle, he must go all out to fight this battle!Jiu Wu made up his mind. He took out a few immortal treasures and shoved them to Li Changshou so that he could practice along the way.However, what Jiu Wu did not expect was\u2026He missed.Jiu Wu\u2019s immortal senses swept across the place. Ling\u2019e was meditating in the straw hut by the lake. The spiritual energy in the surrounding forest of the Pill Chamber seemed to be calm, but the dangers were\u2026 clear to him.Jiu Wu did not dare to enter the array formation. He hovered above the Pill Chamber and activated his immortal powers before shouting with all his might.\u201cChangshou!\u201d\u201cChangshou\u2026\u201dIn the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou was lying on a rocking chair and resting.However, his real body was hiding in the secret underground chamber with his eyes closed and focusing in a corner.His mind and attention were on the paper effigy which was twenty thousand kilometers away\u2026As long as someone barged into the outer array formation, the jade pendant in his hand would vibrate and wake Li Changshou up\u2026That was also one of the major flaws of the current state of the paper effigy. Once it left the range of his immortal senses, he had to place all his attention on it.Jiu Wu called Li Changshou twice, but to no avail. He was so anxious that his forehead was full of sweat. He started to spin in the air.Ling\u2019e stuck her head out of the straw hut and recalled her senior\u2019s instructions.\u201cUncle-Master Jiu Wu! Senior Brother is in seclusion! He won\u2019t come out until he breaks through!\u201dUpon hearing that, Jiu Wu stomped his feet.\u201cHey! Why is he in reclusion at this juncture!?!\u201d\u201cWhat should we do now!?\u201dLing\u2019e did not understand what was going on. Just as she was about to continue shouting, Jiu Wu drove the cloud away in a hurry.In order to break through the bottleneck, the Qi Refinement cultivators would usually choose to enter seclusion without any distractions.Although it was not a coincidence that Li Changshou was in seclusion, he could still go back and explain.However, as an executive of the Immortal Du Sect, Jiu Wu could not help but think\u2026If I were to say that Changshou is in seclusion, wouldn\u2019t it make others think that he is avoiding the battle? Moreover, why would a disciple at the Void Return stage be in seclusion for no reason?That would definitely cause Changshou to provoke the prideful elders.What should I do? I made an oath to keep a secret for Changshou\u2026Eh? Array Formation!The array formations outside the Pill Chamber of Little Qiong Peak were designed by Changshou, and his Junior was the one who set them up. This could be considered a manifestation of Changshou\u2019s ability to create array formations.Jiu Wu\u2019s eyes lit up. He had an idea.When they returned to the Immortal Du Hall on the cloud, the elders saw Jiu Wu returning alone and their faces grew sullen.The ones who had been chatting happily in the main hall quickly quietened down as well.\u201cJiu Wu, what\u2019s going on?\u201dThe skinny Exalted Zhong Yu asked calmly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t that disciple come over?\u201d\u201cDeputy Sect Leader.\u201d Jiu Wu lowered his head and said, \u201cUnfortunately, Disciple-Nephew Changshou has already broken through to the next realm while in seclusion. I didn\u2019t dare to disturb him. I\u2019m afraid that he will take the wrong path at a critical juncture.\u201dExalted Zhong Yu stroked his beard and smiled lightly. He looked at the few Heaven Immortals from Jie School and sighed. \u201cPlease forgive me. My disciple of the Immortal Du Sect Changshou has been working hard to cultivate lately and has gone into seclusion.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we invite Crown Prince Ao Yi to choose any disciple of our sect to spar with? How about that?\u201dYouqin Xuanya, who had just arrived, took half a step forward, clad in a red dress with a huge sword on her back.She was about to stand up and fight Ao Yi, but her master quietly pulled her back.Jiang Jingshan, who had come with Youqin Xuanya, frowned and looked at the long sword hanging on Ao Yi\u2019s waist.Jiang Jingshan could sense the fluctuations of the Numinous Treasure.Ao Yi stood up again. He pondered for a while and hesitated.He had come to the Immortal Du Sect to spar with that fellow, Li Changshou It was a plan that he had come up with after thinking for a long time.Moreover, he had already spread the word.He had also told his seniors that there were a thorn and an emotional trauma that existed in his heart because of this.I can\u2019t spar with anyone else\u2026His plan could not be disrupted just like that!Ao Yi asked in a low voice, \u201cHow long will he be in seclusion?\u201dHe continued, \u201cAfter the Dao discussion ends, I\u2019ll wait outside the sect for his breakthrough.\u201dThe elders and middle-aged cultivators present were instantly moved by Ao Yi\u2019s persistence.Jiu Wu observed secretly. When he saw that an elder was about to speak, he reckoned that he would definitely make him think of a way to wake Li Changshou up\u2026\u201cAhem!\u201dThe short Daoist spoke first. He took two steps forward and bowed.\u201cDeputy Sect Leader, elders, and seniors! Although Disciple-Nephew Changshou is in seclusion, his best ability is not using talisman techniques. Instead, he\u2019s best at\u2026 array formations!\u201dWhile he was thinking about how to avoid the oath he made that day, Jiu Wu introduced Li Changshou to them and mentioned that the Little Qiong Peak was designed by Li Changshou and that Jiu Jiu had set up the array formations outside the Little Qiong Peak. He also proposed another method for sparring\u2026Sigh, Changshou, I can only do this much for you.\u2026A moment later, a cloud flew over from the Little Qiong Peak.The two Heaven Immortal elders from the Immortal Du Sect accompanied the Yuan Ze from Golden Ao Island and watched from afar with the two girls.Han Zhi stared at Ao Yi\u2019s back and asked with concern, \u201cUncle-Master, are you good at breaking array formations?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Yuan Ze waved his hand. \u201cThe array formation here doesn\u2019t seem profound. How can it trap Junior Brother Ao Yi?\u201dHan Zhi could not help but support her forehead with one hand. Her eyes were filled with worry as well.Below, Jiu Wu ushered Ao Yi and slowly landed outside the Pill Chamber\u2019s array formations.Jiu Wu gestured for Ao Yi to enter the array formation.At this moment\u2026The paper effigy was strolling around Linhai Town and immediately turned around to go to the nearby \u2018inn\u2019. He rented a room with various array formations and set up several array formations of his own. The paper effigy then sat on the ground, appearing as though he was cultivating.The paper effigy held onto a few porcelain bottles and closed his eyes. Li Changshou\u2019s mind was instantly drawn back into his body.Who was challenging the array?Li Changshou was dismayed as he scanned the surroundings with his immortal senses.Uh\u2026What is going on?He remained distracted for a while before he snapped back to his senses. At that moment, Ao Yi\u2019s was dizzy. Together with Jiu Wu, he saw the wooden sign\u2026It read: \u201cAre you lost?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Changshou was puzzled.Why!Why would there suddenly be three Heaven Immortals on the Little Qiong Peak?Two of them are elders from the sect, and one of them is a stranger. However, I saw him at the entrance of Linhai Town before, and his aura was somewhat familiar\u2026Why!?!Are Ao Yi and Jiu Wu walking around in the outer array formation?There is a young man with dragon horns in front, and a short Daoist is floating behind him. The former is in a hurry, while the latter has a sinister smile\u2026They even followed the guidance of the wooden sign and headed towards the meeting room that I had created\u2026How did these two come together?It must be a special fate that brought you two together\u2026What in the world is this?Did Uncle-Master Jiu Wu arrange this again?That doesn\u2019t make sense. After all these years, my relationship with Uncle-Master Jiu Wu has gotten better and he has also taken the Great Dao Oath\u2026Huh?In the direction of the main peak, there was still plenty of the aura belonging to the Heaven Immortals. They were all gathered in the main hall that was usually closed\u2026Li Changshou reacted quickly.He had chanced upon the members of the Jie School in Linhai Town and heard some of their conversations. It seemed that they were looking for an immortal sect to discuss the Dao and spar.He never expected that the Jie School was looking for the Immortal Du Sect to discuss the Dao!Ao Yi had some grudges with the Immortal Du Sect.After all, Ao Yi was the Second Prince of the Dragon Palace in the East Ocean Dragon Palace. In recent decades, there had been tension between the Dragon Palace and the Immortal Sect of the East Continent\u2026Could it be that the little dragon wants to cause a conflict between the two factions?That shouldn\u2019t be the case. Ao Yi doesn\u2019t seem so stupid. If he really did that, the Dragon race would be defeated by the Sect Leader of Jie School in the blink of an eye\u2026Although this little dragon is indeed\u2026 not very smart\u2026Did he damage his brain from overindulging in Beauty\u2019s Charm?Li Changshou pondered. At first, he was completely confused by the situation, but he quickly realized what was going on.At that moment, he could vaguely sense that all the members of the Immortal Du Sect were looking at the Little Qiong Peak.They were using their immortal senses and spiritual senses to stare at the surroundings of the Pill Chamber\u2026Among the Immortal Du Sect disciples, the cultivation level that I displayed should be above average. There should not be any problems with this aspect.There must be a reason for everything.He had encountered Ao Yi before his Tribulation Transcendence. That was also a coincidence.He was sure that Ao Yi did not recognize him. At that time, all the people who had appeared were the same sullen-faced old Daoist priests. Their auras and scents had been simulated.In this case, it\u2019s likely that something happened during the Demon-Sweeping Meet in the East Ocean\u2026This little dragon is probably unhappy because he did not lose to me on purpose the previous time. He\u2019s probably displeased about that. After so many years, he actually traveled tens of thousands of kilometers to come here and spar with me again?Li Changshou sighed in the secret underground chamber\u2026\u201cI will never understand what that dragon and that girl are thinking.\u201dWhat should he do now?Li Changshou observed the paper effigy avatar in the Pill Chamber and saw that the three Sensing Stones on the paper effigy flickered slightly. That was obviously caused by his immortal senses.After a moment of hesitation, he turned into a wisp of green smoke and went back to the Pill Chamber.In the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou disappeared before reappearing.He stepped onto the meditation cushion behind the Pill Furnace, sat down, and closed his eyes to meditate. He first followed the instructions that he had given to his junior and pretended to focus on gaining Dao enlightenment\u2026Li Changshou thought that if he were to break through the bottleneck in seclusion, he would have a breakthrough. Hence, he secretly adjusted the Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra.Superficial disguise: Fifth Stage of the Void Return realm.Inner disguise: Ninth Stage of the Void Return realm.Deep disguise: Essence Immortal realm.After doing all that, Li Changshou began to examine himself maniacally. He finally confirmed that there was nothing else on Little Qiong Peak that could expose the details of his trump cards\u2026At that moment, Ling\u2019e was obediently hiding in her straw hut, pretending to be cultivating.Junior Sister is doing well this time.I shall praise her later.Li Changshou knew that he could only pretend to be in seclusion and comprehend the Dao. He would wait for the experts in the sect to wake up or be alarmed by the commotion in the array formation\u2026He could only advance by retreating and find an opportunity to divert their attention!They were in the array.Following the instructions on the wooden signs, they arrived at the Open-space Tearoom. Ao Yi and Jiu Wu could not help but look at each other.At that moment, Ao Yi\u2019s body was still like that of a child that was 12 or 13 years old. Including his horns, he was six feet tall and a head taller than Jiu Wu.After he read the words written on the wooden signs, he turned to look at his surroundings, his eyes filled with confusion.Jiu Wu smiled and said, \u201cCrown Prince Ao Yi, this is obviously another fork in the road.\u201dAo Yi frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019ve found a way out of these basic array formations. Why can\u2019t I leave this place?\u201d\u201cThis is a Chain Array. It was created by Disciple-Nephew Changshou,\u201d said Jiu Wu. He continued, \u201cThere will be a succeeding array formation after the previous path of life. If you want to break this array formation, you have to have high attainments in creating array formations.\u201d\u201cCrown Prince Ao Yi, don\u2019t force yourself.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201dAo Yi snorted and said indifferently, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll be trapped here today!\u201dHe then took out an ice-blue pearl from his chest pocket. The pearl glistened, and the spiritual energy within the array was instantly blocked.Ao Yi smiled indifferently before turning around and walking back. He soon discovered a new path.Jiu Wu hurriedly followed and caught up behind him. However, the smile on the short Daoist\u2019s face grew wider.When he joined forces with Jiu Shi and his wife back then, they were all confused by the array formation. The current array formation was obviously more perfect than the one they tried to break\u2026In essence, the Chain Array was made up of some basic array formations. However, Li Changshou\u2019s meticulous and detailed design made it ingenious.An hour later\u2026Ao Yi looked at the wooden sign in front of him and his mouth twitched.It read: \u201cAre you lost?\u201dHe had returned to the same place!\u201cDamn it!\u201dAo Yi\u2019s delicate face twitched as he gritted his teeth. He then shook his head and walked down another path.In the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou opened his left eye.This little dragon seems to have a Dharma treasure that can break the array formation. However, he has been circling around the periphery. He obviously doesn\u2019t know much about array formations.After thinking about it, Li Changshou secretly removed several array formations that were within a thousand feet of the Pill Chamber, allowing the Heaven Immortals to take a closer look at the Pill Chamber so that they could see that he was meditating in seclusion.That would seem more reasonable.\u2026Another hour later\u2026Hovering in the sky above the Little Qiong Peak, the three Heaven Immortals had different expressions. The elders of the Immortal Du Sect naturally smiled, but they could not laugh too much.The old Daoist priest Yuan Ze also had a smile on his face. However, he also frowned a few times.They could roughly see the situation inside the array formation. When Yuan Ze saw Ao Yi turning around like a headless fly, he felt a little anxious.Inside the array, Ao Yi\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, and he had an unstable state of mind. He held onto a sword and a pearl in his hand as he walked through the array swiftly.Jiu Wu floated slowly from behind, while keeping his guard up against Ao Yi who might use his Numinous Treasure sword to break the array\u2026In a while, Jiu Wu would ask his master to take action and get the two of them out so that the prince of the Dragon Palace could admit defeat.Apprentice-nephew doesn\u2019t need to come out of seclusion. I\u2019ve already settled everything!Gradually, Ao Yi\u2019s breathing quickened\u2026However, Ao Yi was still awake. Although he was anxious, he did not do anything out of line.He had agreed to break the array formation. If he managed to clear it, he would have won!The array formation here is indeed a basic array formation set up by cultivators at the Void Return Stage. However, I can\u2019t even leave\u2026In fact, I can\u2019t even find the core of the array formation!When I was in Dan Sect, I learned so many principles about array formations\u2026 Is the dragon race this weak in the face of array formations?No, the dragon race can still rise!Jiu Wu whispered, \u201cCrown Prince Ao Yi, why don\u2019t you forget\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m breaking the array!\u201dAo Yi turned around and growled.\u201cYes, please go ahead.\u201dJiu Wu smiled and followed closely behind. He was afraid that he would lose Ao Yi.On a cloud outside the array, the two young ladies discussed for a while. Han Zhi said softly, \u201cMaster, you have also taught me many techniques in creating array formations.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go and give it a try with Senior Sister Rourou? This has nothing to do with Uncle-Master Ao Yi\u2019s sparring. I\u2019m just a little enticed.\u201dThe old Daoist priest Yuan Ze looked at the two Elders from the Immortal Du Sect and nodded in agreement.They wanted to see how profound the array formations outside the Pill Chamber of Little Qiong Peak were\u2026They ended up chancing upon a talented practitioner of array formations!After this, I must tell the people of Hundred Mortal Hall to focus on groom Changshou.\u201cGo, go.\u201d Old Daoist Yuan Ze waved his hand. Han Zhi and the young lady floated down and entered the array.A few moments later\u2026The two girls in the Essence Immortal realm looked at the wooden sign, feeling rather dumbfounded and dismayed.It read: \u201cAre you lost?\u201dHan Zhi said in a low voice, \u201cThe person who set up this array is too arrogant!\u201d\u201cThere are wooden planks behind.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see what tricks he has up his sleeves. Let\u2019s go and take a look!\u201dThere were more guests in the Open-space Tearoom than there had ever been in the past ten-odd years.\u2026In the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou, who was using his immortal sense to observe everything, sighed silently in his heart. He continued pretending to be in seclusion and trying to break through.Fortunately, he had given the secret of the array formation to the sect through Jiu Wu and obtained the Pill Furnace from the sect.That was the last hidden danger which he had gotten rid of in advance.However, after today, the array formations around the Pill Chamber would probably become a scenic spot in the sect\u2026Little Qiong Peak Reservation Project\u2014The Great Adventure of the Enchanting Formation!Furthermore, with this incident and all the previous events, my \u201cextraordinary disciple\u201d had attracted too much attention.The matter really gave Li Changshou a headache\u2026The image of an outstanding disciple was too weak. He could not hold on any longer!This time, I shall take the opportunity to reveal the level of an \u201cinferior junior immortal\u201d. Otherwise, if the situation gets too abnormal, it would be even more difficult to explain.Li Changshou quickly pondered.Disguising is a matter of balance in all aspects. One had to act appropriately in order to make people feel that they had seen through him. That was actually a higher level of disguise.The way he dealt with Jiu Wu back then was for the sake of exposing Jiu Wu so that the latter would think that he knew everything about him\u2026This time, I can only continue using this method to deal with the experts in the sect. Perhaps, I would be able to obtain many benefits from this\u2026Now, I can only reveal the cultivation level of a quasi-immortal junior immortal. I can divert their attention to my own cultivation level and conceal other abnormalities.I want them to think that my talent is not too bad and that it was no wonder I could cause so much trouble.After that, I will need a few years to settle down. Then, I will deliberately break through the bottleneck and go back to being an outstanding disciple. The sect will then not pay much attention to me, a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak.If I reveal some of my trump cards, I can make up for it in the future.If all my other trump cards are exposed, it would be quite troublesome\u2026In the future, I have to be extra careful.The trump cards that he had hidden painstakingly were meant for him to deal with all kinds of dangers and to survive better.No matter how little he revealed, it would still be a loss during this situation.Now that I think of it\u2026 I should have given Ao Yi some Heart-diminishing Powder back in the ocean!I would have used just a tiny dosage!Another hour passed\u2026The rays of the setting sun covered the sky, illuminating the elders of the Immortal Du Sect. There was a smile on each of the wrinkled faces that were as bright as chrysanthemums.The two Qi Refinement cultivators from Golden Ao Island and three Immortal Du Sect elders arrived.In the hearts of the elders of the Immortal Du Sect, Li Changshou and Jiu Jiu were worthy of being praised. They also praised Jiu Wu, who had come up with that idea to brush Ao Yi off.It was indeed a smart move.One of the elders from the Immortal Du Sect took the initiative to step forward. He stroked his beard and smiled.\u201cThe array formations here were meticulously designed by Li Changshou, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect. He used the chain array formation techniques that he had studied for many years and came up with the design. They were then set up by my Apprentice-nephew Jiu Jiu, who\u2019s a Perfected Immortal.\u201d\u201cAlthough they are all basic array formations, they can in fact, only be set up in the Perfected Immortal realm. It\u2019s normal that Prince Ao Yi and the two fairies couldn\u2019t break them.\u201d\u201cFine!\u201dThe old Daoist Yuan Ze sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take the three of them out. Junior Ao Yi lost again this time.\u201dYuan Ze then floated towards the array below with his hands behind his back.With the abilities of a Heaven Immortal, he could blow and make the array foundation collapse with his immortal power. However, that would be too embarrassing.The old Daoist priest Yuan Ze had been watching outside for half a day. He felt that he had already figured out the method to break the array formation. At this moment, he was full of confidence. He was going to help the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island turn the tables\u2026His juniors have really embarrassed themselves this time and that could not be helped.However\u2026To Yuan Ze\u2019s surprise\u2026A few moments later\u2026He saw the wooden sign that read: \u201cAre you lost?\u201dThe old Heaven Immortal could not help but let out a long sigh as he thought This array formation indeed has a hidden secret.He turned around, frowned, and continued trying to break the array. The few Heaven Immortals on the cloud looked at each other, not knowing what to say.After Li Changshou returned from his Tribulation Transcendence, he had indeed secretly activated the outer layer of array formations. However, he had only changed the foundations of a few of them.It would be easy for the Heaven Immortal Yuan Ze to forcefully break the array formation. However, he was still a little angry and insisted on breaking the array formation that was actually a closed Chain Array\u2026Theoretically, the only way to break through the array formation was to do it with brute force and destroy one of the array formation foundations.However, how could he use brute force?The matter concerned the level of the array formation skills of the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island!The matter concerned his pride!Once again\u2026 One hour later\u2026Ao Yi and Jiu Wu stood rooted to the ground as they watched the Heaven Immortal Daoists walking back and forth.\u201cSenior Brother Yuan Ze!\u201d Ao Yi shouted and took a step forward. The scenery around him suddenly changed.The old Daoist priest Yuan Ze raised his sleeve to cover his face when he heard that. However, the array formation changed, and his figure quickly disappeared out of Ao Yi\u2019s sight.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Ao Yi\u2019s eyes widened as his entire body trembled.Jiu Wu hurried over and smiled. \u201cPrince, it\u2019s getting late. Why don\u2019t we? Huh?\u201d\u201cI can definitely break this array! I can definitely break this array!\u201dAo Yi shouted in a trembling voice. He lifted his sword and continued to run forward while his body trembled.\u2026The Pill Chamber was filled with starlight.Li Changshou\u2019s immortal senses were fixed on the group of Heaven Immortals and Perfected Immortals in the sky who seemed to want to enter the array formation\u2026Why don\u2019t I deal with it tonight and escape with Master and Junior?Indeed, I should escape.I can\u2019t stay in the Immortal Du Sect any longer!That was, of course, a joke. He had worked hard to manage the Little Qiong Peak for numerous years and it was obviously a relatively safer place.At that moment, a wisp of immortal senses suddenly descended from the sky and was fixed on Li Changshou. It gently disturbed his spirit.The disturbance was slight.Li Changshou understood that the experts in the sect were waking him up, but they were afraid that it would affect his mental state\u2026It was thoughtful of them to care so much about a disciple.Li Changshou opened his eyes while in a daze. It was exactly the same as the scene when he was woken up in the midst of cultivation.The Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s voice sounded in his ears. \u201cDon\u2019t cultivate any more. Let the person in the array out. When Ao Yi came to spar with you previously, he was already at the Essence Immortal realm. He might suppress his cultivation level and attack you later. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to win, but you cannot lose too quickly in your own immortal sect.\u201dLi Changshou quickly stood up and bowed to the sky. \u201cI will do as you say.\u201dSuppress his cultivation level to fight me?He walked quickly to the door of the Pill Chamber and looked forward. He made up his mind and clenched his fists tightly!I\u2019ll go all out!The jade pendant rotated slightly, and a gentle breeze blew across the forest.Li Changshou, on the other hand, flew up in front of the Pill Chamber and slowly rose into the air. His cultivation level which was at the Void Return Stage was undoubtedly revealed!It seemed that he had just broken through the realm and was still a little unstable\u2026In the sky and in the forest, the elders, the immortals, and the two fairies of Jie School, Jiu Wu, Ao Yi, and the old Heaven Immortal looked over at the same time\u2026In the immortal sect, all eyes were on Li Changshou.That made Li Changshou feel slightly uncomfortable, but he could only try his best to endure this wave.Jiu Wu quickly reminded him, \u201cYou did not hide your cultivation level!\u201dLi Changshou was stunned. He bowed to Jiu Wu and said,\u201cI\u2019m Li Changshou, a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak. I hereby greet you, my elders, Uncle-Masters, and Seniors.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come on, go up! Don\u2019t embarrass your master!\u201dAo Yi could see in the corner of his eyes, the old Daoist Yuan Ze hurriedly floating back to the sky with the two young girls. They were flying rather quickly and when they returned to the crowd, it was as if nothing happened\u2026Then, Li Changshou flew into the air and bowed.\u201cI\u2019m Li Changshou, a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak. Hello\u2026\u201dA familiar voice slowly traveled through the night sky. Ao Yi\u2019s legs trembled as he staggered forward.He had lost\u2026Actually, he had lost again.When he was ten years old, he wanted to lose, but Li Changshou admitted defeat before him. In fact, he was the real loser\u2026Today\u2026I have the Water-Condensed Spiritual Pearl that Mother had given me, but I can\u2019t even break these simple trapping array formations.I have the Ice Glazed Sword that Master had bestowed upon me, but I can\u2019t sever the confusion in this area.How can I have the cheek to challenge that person with this sword?However, how could he be willing to succumb?It was not easy for him to come up with a plan to make a name for himself. He wanted to use the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island who liked to talk about the Dao everywhere they went, to challenge the elites of the human race\u2026Why did things go awry right at the start of the plan\u2026Ao Yi remained standing, his eyes filled with confusion. He did not know what he should do next. He thought Should I bow to Li Changshou and say, \u201cI\u2019m not as good as you.\u201dOr should I continue with my plan, be thick-skinned and spar with this human disciple again\u2026Ao Yi sighed in his heart. However, he did not want to do such a shameless thing.After putting away the pearl, he put his sword back into his sheath and took two steps forward. He bowed to Li Changshou, who was in front of the Pill Chamber.\u201cI, Ao Yi, have experienced the wonders of your array formation today.\u201dAo Yi then turned around to leave.However, a Heaven Immortal who was hovering in the air frowned slightly and said calmly,\u201cSince our young friend Changshou has already come out of seclusion, there\u2019s no need to engage in an array formation sparring session. Just let the two of them spar as per normal. This is not about winning or losing. Today, we, Golden Ao Island just want to help Junior Ao Yi get rid of the demon in his heart that resulted from his previous loss.\u201dAo Yi looked up and hesitated.However, one of the elders from the Immortal Du Sect said, \u201cChangshou, are you willing to spar with the prince of the Dragon Palace again? He will seal his own cultivation level and be on the same level as you, the seventh stage of Void Return.\u201dLi Changshou did not hesitate. He had expected their reaction a long time ago.The sparring session was inevitable because both parties were already competing in terms of array formations and honor.He lowered his head and said, \u201cDisciple, follow the sect\u2019s arrangements.\u201dAll of a sudden, the elders in the air beamed with joy.The elders had already reached a tacit agreement. They decided that after the Golden Ao Island group left, they would reward Li Changshou, their young disciple who had given them a surprise.The group returned to the Heaven-Breaking Peak immediately.When they came from Heaven-Breaking Peak, the five or six of them were the only ones in the sky. When they returned, the sky was filled with clouds, and the starry sky was pitch dark.Li Changshou obediently followed behind the immortals. Jiu Wu rushed over from the side, grabbed his arm, and leaned backward\u2026\u201cThis is for you.\u201dJiu Wu stuffed his hand into Li Changshou\u2019s sleeve and placed a treasure pouch in it. Then, he said,He then said through a voice transmission, \u201cThis prince of the Dragon Palace has two Postnatal Numinous treasures on him. That sword is not to be underestimated. If he wants to hurt you later, you can use the item in the treasure pouch to smash him.\u201d\u201cThis is my master\u2019s Purple Seal, which is also a Numinous treasure. I asked him for it because I wanted to lend it to you. Remember, it\u2019s a loan! It\u2019s not a gift for you!\u201dLi Changshou could not help but laugh. He took out the treasure pouch and stuffed it back into Jiu Wu\u2019s sleeve.Huh? There are a few treasure pouches sewn on Uncle-Master\u2019s sleeve too?I wonder what\u2019s in there.\u201cUncle-Master, you don\u2019t have to worry. I have my ways to deal with him later.\u201d Li Changshou sent a voice transmission back. \u201cI will not let him win this battle\u2026 as long as he doesn\u2019t fight and transform into a dragon.\u201dJiu Wu was confused. Li Changshou muttered under his breath using the voice transmission again.The short Daoist immediately raised his eyebrows and sneered. \u201cT\u2026 this isn\u2019t appropriate, is it?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cYou have to be flexible with the rules. This is a principle that my master often teaches.\u201d\u201cRight, where\u2019s your master? You should have let him come and take a look at you when you are sparring with someone.\u201dYou should have let him come and take a look when you are sparring with someone.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Li Changshou used his immortal sense to look at the tree stump that had fallen asleep in the forest a few hundred kilometers outside the mountain. The corners of his mouth twitched slightly, and he left behind a wisp of immortal sense that surrounded it.He answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Master has been in a bad mood recently, so he probably went out for a stroll.\u201dJiu Wu sighed softly. \u201cRight. Your master has become a Turbid Immortal. The Immortal Path is definitely not that easy. Don\u2019t think too much about it. Just fight this round well. It doesn\u2019t matter if we win or not. Just don\u2019t lose pathetically.\u201dLi Changshou nodded.In front of them, an elder had already turned to look at the two of them. Jiu Wu did not dare to say anything. He rode a cloud and chased after the rest with Li Changshou.\u2026A moment later, in the square in front of the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2019s Immortal Ascension Hall, one of the elders threw out dozens of Night Luminescent Dharma Pearls which illuminated the place and made it seem like it was daytime.More than a hundred figures stood in front of the hall. In the Immortal Du Sect, more than half of the Qi Refinement cultivators were watching them using their spiritual senses and immortal senses.The people from Jin Ao Island did not say anything else.After discussing with the elders for a while, Jiu Wu took the initiative to step forward and said loudly,\u201cWhen sparring and discussing the Dao, one\u2019s intention should be to test one\u2019s own Dao and understanding. It should be a revelation of your own theoretical knowledge and not a fight. Both parties should spar appropriately and not hurt each other.\u201d\u201cThis open space in front of the hall is the border. We will proceed according to the rules of the Dragon Palace. Even if you are going to lose, you\u2019re not to use any lethal treasures.\u201dAo Yi and Li Changshou agreed.Ao Yi then put away the Numinous Treasure sword that was hanging at his waist, took out a pair of silvery-white gloves, and slowly put them on.He then turned around and cupped his hands together while facing the five Heaven Immortals of Golden Ao Island.\u201cSenior Brothers, please help me seal my cultivation level to the seventh stage of Void Return.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d A middle-aged Daoist priest nodded slightly. He drew a talisman out of thin air with his left hand and struck Ao Yi. Ao Yi\u2019s aura instantly fell.\u201cThis talisman can seal your cultivation level for two hours.\u201d\u201cThank you, Senior Brother.\u201dAfter that, Ao Yi and Li Changshou walked towards the arena. They were fifteen feet away from each other, and their auras were intertwined.Suddenly, someone shouted, \u201cSenior Brother Changshou!\u201dLi Changshou looked over. It was Youqin Xuanya, who was clad in a red dress. She was looking at him from the front of the hall, and her eyes were filled with worry.\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and nodded, purely out of courtesy.Li Changshou looked at Ao Yi and said, \u201cPrince Ao Yi, today is a little different from the Demon-Sweeping Meet. I might have an unfair advantage.\u201dThere was shame written all over Ao Yi\u2019s face. He replied in a clear voice, \u201cFellow Daoist, please go ahead and attack as you wish.\u201dLi Changshou nodded. He lifted the front of his Daoist robe with one hand, placed it behind his back, and made an inviting gesture.The opening was full of vigor!However, Li Changshou had already made up his mind.He had thought about his battle strategy carefully.I\u2019m going to be steady yet mischievous\u2026 Ahem, I want to win. I won\u2019t expose anything!Ao Yi took a deep breath, and his expression turned grave. There were Mysterious Ice fireballs around him.Yellow paper talismans flew out from Li Changshou\u2019s sleeves. In the blink of an eye, over a hundred talismans were released!Ao Yi had experienced that move before. However, he felt that the power of those yellow paper talismans was much stronger than before.Ao Yi stopped in his tracks and charged forward. A few Mysterious Ice fireballs turned into dragon shadows that circled around Li Changshou and charged at him together!This time, Li Changshou did not use any footwork to dodge. Instead, he remained standing quietly and rapidly chanted spells. He was chanting so quickly that the syllables were almost indistinct as if he were humming a song.Ao Yi pounced at him in the blink of an eye!He punched Li Changshou\u2019s chest immediately with power that was strong enough to split a mountain. At this moment, Ao Yi was frowning and all ready to put away his fist.However\u2026Swoosh!Li Changshou bent down and instantly entered the ground that resembled rippling water!Earth Escape!Due to the fact that Li Changshou had used Earth Escape to save Youqin Xuanya twice during the previous trip to the Northern Continent, the sect had long known that Li Changshou had that technique. Hence, he could use it openly now.Ao Yi\u2019s punch missed. His body landed on the ground and he rushed forward by more than ten steps\u2026The Second Prince, Ao Yi turned his head and saw that the yellow talismans behind him had already formed an array. Flames erupted consecutively!Although it was just an ordinary fire spell, it could still unleash quite a bit of power with the support of Li Changshou\u2019s Stage-seven Void Return Dharma powers.Ao Yi covered his face with his arms and dodged from left to right. However, he was continuously hit by the condensing flames\u2026Li Changshou was quietly wandering underground, searching for an opportunity to launch a sneak attack.He could lose or win. After comparing the two, he felt that there was actually no difference to him.The important thing was how he lost and won.If he had a head-on confrontation with Ao Yi and fought a grand battle, his image would be remembered by the disciples in the sect regardless of whether he lost or won.However, if he were to rely on Earth Escape and the talismans, he would not have to face Ao Yi head-on. It would not be a pity if he lost and it would not be great if he won either. Most people would think that he wasn\u2019t that competent\u2026A disadvantaged junior immortal who was good at array formations and Earth Escape would instantly have a good image.To others, winning using such a method was just a trick. No one would treat him like a hero.Uh, the negative side may not be true. This is just a loophole and is not within my consideration.It wouldn\u2019t matter even if he got a bad reputation because of that.What Li Changshou wanted was for the matter to blow over quickly so that he could resume cultivation while his life returns to its original stability!So\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Little Dragon!Flames continuously erupted from the array formations, causing Ao Yi to be in a sorry state. However, he did not sustain too many injuries.Ao Yi was anxious and kept searching for Li Changshou.The ground was calm and peaceful as if there was a lingering aura\u2026Over there!Ao Yi immediately rushed forward and threw a punch. A hole suddenly appeared on the ground, but Li Changshou was nowhere to be seen.At that moment, a huge hand secretly reached out from the ground behind Ao Yi. It was stuck to a talisman, but it could not be seen through his immortal senses. There was a sharp dagger in Li Changshou\u2019s hand, which was a Dharma treasure dagger. He then aimed at the back of Ao Yi\u2019s leg.Bang!A small bloodied arrow shot out. Ao Yi immediately leaped up and turned around to take a look. The huge hand was instantly retracted into the ground!Ao Yi took a breath of cold air. However, he missed again when he tried to smack it quickly.He could only widen his eyes and jump into the sky!The talismans that had been waiting to attack for a long time, unleashed their power simultaneously. Without them realizing, dozens of yellow paper talismans appeared in the sky. They burst into flames in the sky and knocked Ao Yi down!This time, there were some extraordinary True Flames in the spell which burned Ao Yi\u2019s flesh, and his body was covered in burns that made him feel overwhelmed with excruciating pain. He was in a sorry state\u2026It was the True Samadhi Flames that were of appropriate power, which Li Changshou simulated with his own spiritual power.As soon as Ao Yi landed on the ground, another palm that could not be detected by his immortal senses, extended from Ao Yi\u2019s blind spot\u2026This time, it was holding onto a short sword that was a Dharma treasure. It was aimed at Ao Yi\u2019s knee.Bang!The second arrow darted out!The sounds of someone chuckling could be heard in front of the hall\u2026Ao Yi turned his head and glared at Li Changshou with anger. The hand sunk back into the ground, but Li Changshou was nowhere to be seen!A frown appeared on Ao Yi\u2019s delicate face. He captured the remaining aura on the ground and punched the ground, forming a hole that was half a meter deep.The square in front of the main hall was paved with very sturdy and refined stones.His cultivation level had been sealed, yet he was able to create a pit with a single punch. Ao Yi\u2019s strength had also impressed the immortals from both sides.However, it was useless.The lingering aura was originally used by Li Changshou to lure the enemy. When Ao Yi pounced on him, he launched a sneak attack from behind. Ao Yi was so angry that he had no choice but to hide in the air.However, the array formation above him changed. A pillar of fire smashed down from the sky and pressed Ao Yi onto the ground again!As soon as Ao Yi landed on the ground, his legs seemed to have fallen into a quagmire. The ground froze instantly, and he was locked in place!The words \u2018I might not win\u2019, which Li Changshou said, echoed in Ao Yi\u2019s mind. He suddenly realized something\u2026The battle was different from that of the Demon-Sweeping Meet. They were on the concrete ground, not the \u201cground\u201d formed by the Water Lotus Platform!This disciple of the Immortal Du Sect could execute the technique that he\u2019s most proficient in\u2014Earth Escape!I have to admit that this Earth Escape technique is very powerful!However!\u201cHa!\u201dAo Yi hollered, and his hands quickly formed a seal. The Mysterious Ice flames around him formed the image of an azure dragon!The dragon\u2019s shadow howled in all directions and was blasted at the ground. Stone fragments flew everywhere, and the light and shadow effects were instantly maximized!Li Changshou, who was hiding underground, could not help but exclaim in admiration when he saw it\u2026This Dragon Prince actually knows the Eighteen Dragon-subduing Palms!?!Would he really not be scolded for being a traitor by his Father, the Dragon Emperor?At this moment, there should be background music\u2026Standing in front of the hall, the elders of the Immortal Du Sect did not know whether to laugh or cry.They naturally felt that it would not be nice for Li Changshou to avoid battle using his escape technique.However, the prince could not do anything to their disciple. Li Changshou was already in an invincible position. The elders felt that that was a good thing.Only a few elders who were in charge of managing the internal affairs of the sect felt their hearts ache\u2026It would cost a lot of precious materials to repair the square!Look!Ao Yi\u2019s dragon shadow was smashing everything in sight.Amidst the smoke, Li Changshou\u2019s palm crept out from behind Ao Yi. This time, he was holding a three-feet long sword\u2026He aimed it at Ao Yi\u2019s thigh and jabbed it forward again.Ding!This time, he did not launch the bleeding arrow!Ao Yi turned his head and glowered furiously. A layer of dragon scales appeared on his thigh, and his feet were pulled out of the ground!However, the talismans on the top began to erupt wildly again, not giving Ao Yi any time to think.Li Changshou hid under the ground and quietly waited for the next opportunity to attack. He secretly controlled the talisman arrays and continuously replenished the talismans that were required for the array formation\u2026The talisman array in the sky formed the shape of a snake before forming a figure-8 at the next moment. They would condense into balls of fire and thick pillars of flames, making Ao Yi look extremely pathetic\u2026As soon as Ao Yi landed on the ground, the hand that could not be detected with his spiritual senses and immortal senses was pulled out from the blind spot in his line of sight. It was holding onto a dagger, a short sword, and a long sword, all of which were stabbing at his calf continuously.Ao Yi kept roaring, but he had no choice but to stay enraged and incapacitated.Li Changshou\u2019s repeated sneak attacks had already caused there to be many minor wounds on Ao Yi\u2019s legs.For a moment, the disciples from the Immortal Du Sect laughed happily.Youqin Xuanya, who was originally worried, could not help but smile.The Exalted Wang Qing, who had always been expressionless, turned around and looked at the wall in the hall. No one knew what he was thinking about, but his shoulders would occasionally tremble\u2026A moment later, Ao Yi\u2019s entire body was charred as he panted heavily. His long hair hung loosely over his shoulders.As the array formation exerted its power, his figure was once again pressed onto the ground by the pillar of fire. However, he forced himself not to collapse\u2026At that moment, a black shadow emerged from the ground behind Ao Yi\u2026A cold aura emanated from the field.Everyone knew that the black shadow was definitely the hand that appeared again. However\u2026 at this moment\u2026A cold light shot out from the dust. It was a spike, no, not a single one. There were countless spikes!This time, it was holding a Dharma artifact, the Spiked Mace!The hand that reached out of the ground raised the Spiked Mace, aimed it at the weakest spot behind Ao Yi, and silently leaned forward\u2026Ao Yi was searching everywhere. He was in a daze and did not notice danger approaching\u2026All of a sudden, the spectators widened their eyes.Youqin Xuanya, Han Zhi, Rourou, and many other female disciples of the Immortal Du Sect covered their faces, not daring to take another look.Two Qi Refinement cultivators from the Golden Ao Island were so angry that their hands were trembling.Many of the male disciples\u2019 Adam\u2019s apples vibrated. They swore in their hearts that they would never spar with Li Changshou of the Little Qiong Peak in the future!\u201cAlright! We admit defeat!\u201dThe old Daoist priest Yuan Ze shouted helplessly. The Spiked Mace disappeared from the ground.Ao Yi turned his head and looked at Yuan Ze in confusion. He then lowered his head and sighed.Indeed, he could not do anything about the Earth Escape.Ao Yi was relieved. He took two steps back in a sorry state. His aura surged and he sat on the ground\u2026It was true\u2026He had really lost\u2026He\u2026At that moment, a fair hand reached over towards Ao Yi from the side.Ao Yi looked up and saw Li Changshou\u2019s warm and gentle face.\u201cCan we consider this a draw? If we have a direct confrontation, I definitely won\u2019t be a match for you. I could only resort to sneaky moves. After all, this is the Immortal Du Sect. I can only do my best. I cannot let the sect lose. I hope you can understand. I\u2019m sorry for offending you.\u201dAo Yi\u2019s throat trembled, and he put on a strong smile. His eyes were red.Not all humans are like those sullen-faced monsters\u2026There are also gentle ones like Changshou\u2026Ao Yi reached out and grabbed Li Changshou\u2019s outstretched hand while standing up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat did it mean to hide one\u2019s identity after settling the matter?In Youqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes, that was what Li Changshou did.Senior Brother Changshou put in a lot of effort and went through a lot of hardships, and dangers. He barely managed to defeat the Second Prince of the Dragon Palace East Ocean, Ao Yi, who was also a member of the Jie School\u2026However, he is very humble and does not seek fame. He left quietly\u2026In reality\u2026 Li Changshou first pulled Ao Yi up and said that he had offended him.That was to eliminate potential hostility so that the Jie School and Ao Yi could reduce their hatred towards him.Li Changshou then confessed to the elders in front of the hall and claimed that he had won unfairly. He revealed that he had only used the escape technique and talisman technique that the sect had taught him, which gave him an edge. He also said that he was willing to receive punishment from the sect for damaging the sect\u2019s reputation.That was to further reduce his sense of guilt and exude authority for the sect. He also hinted to his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu that he wanted to return to the Little Qiong Peak.Li Changshou then bowed to the people from the Golden Ao Island, appearing rather ashamed\u2026With a few simple sentences and actions, Li Changshou seamlessly gave everyone an out.The elder of the Immortal Du Sect was a reasonable person. He could tell that Li Changshou did not want to become enemies with the Golden Ao Island and the Dragon Palace. Thus, he deliberately reprimanded him with a stern expression and asked him to return to the Little Qiong Peak to reflect on his mistakes.That elder was actually just putting on an act. He was implying that Li Changshou should return to the Little Qiong Peak and wait for his reward later.However, Youqin Xuanya kept frowning while standing at the side. If her master had not been holding her down, she would have definitely stood up and argued for her Senior Brother Changshou, who was still not considered a friend\u2026Youqin Xuanya sighed softly as she watched Li Changshou leave in the starry sky.She thought, When can I be as outstanding as Senior Brother?After Li Changshou left the Heaven-Breaking Peak, he sighed and thought to himself, I\u2019ve finally dealt with this. It\u2019s really troublesome.However, no matter what he did, the truth was that Little Qiong Peak was being watched by everyone in the sect.After the paper effigy returns from the outside world this time, I\u2019ll continue to refine pills in silence. I\u2019ll be able to peacefully refine pills for ten years and then continue my plan to become wealthy.No, eight to ten years wouldn\u2019t be enough, but at least, it will be stable\u2026I\u2019ll need at least twenty years!Judging from this little dragon\u2019s expression, he might come to Little Qiong Peak to apologize later.Li Changshou thought about it for a while and hid the Beauty\u2019s Charm in his treasure pouch. He did not want to be careless and mistakenly take out that item instead.Moreover, he was not the only one who could refine Beauty\u2019s Charm. There were countless Qi Refinement cultivators who enjoyed drinking it during the Primordial World.That alone made him certain that the East Ocean would not be able to discover any dirt on him.At this moment, it was extremely lively in the Heaven-Breaking Peak. All the Heaven Immortals had begun to preach and discuss the Dao. The people who had been watching the battle earlier had also stayed to listen to the Heaven Immortals from both factions.However, Li Changshou saw that the Heaven Immortal of the Golden Ao Island was boiling with fury just now. He reckoned that he would still have to meet with the Heaven Immortals of his sect in a while\u2026That had nothing to do with him. He had merely completed the mission given by the sect.Upon returning to the Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou first walked around the Pill Chamber.He thought about the mistakes that he could have made, and how could he salvage the situation if there had been any.If Master\u2019s enemy was watching today as well\u2026What would he think?It would be great if the enemy could attack me. I could give the enemy a chance to go out on purpose and find a place to humiliate him\u2026Before I attack, I can even use the Sound Sphere to prove that he was the one who wanted to harm me, a disciple. Thankfully, I have the poison that Elder Wan Linyun had given me for protection\u2026After that, even if I have to go into seclusion at the Little Qiong Peak for hundreds of years according to the sect rules, it would not be a problem at all. Anyway, my main body doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere.Li Changshou chuckled. He knew that it was just his wishful thinking.After all, he was just a quasi-immortal and a young junior immortal who was at the seventh stage of the Void Return. The enemy should not be able to sense any threat\u2026Let\u2019s see what happens next.Although Li Changshou wanted to ask his master who his enemy was, he was afraid that his master would feel upset after recalling the past.Secondly, he cared about his master\u2019s pride.If he asked the others, he might be suspected if the enemy were to appear again later\u2026The matter had to be planned carefully.He had been exposed for no reason this time, although it was not that he had not done enough\u2026There was no need to belittle himself. Li Changshou had already tried his best to protect himself.However, who would have thought\u2026He was happily shopping in Linhai Town, buying herbs and selling pills. When he opened his eyes, he saw Jiu Wu and Ao Yi, who were completely unrelated to each other, wandering around the trapped arrays around his Pill Chamber\u2026What the hell is that?Although there was a sign because he had run into the Heaven Immortal of Golden Ao Island in Linhai Town, he did not expect things to develop that way.I shall tell Master to reject all guests of Little Qiong Peak in the future.Li Changshou sighed and tried to sense the essence soul of the paper effigy. His mind instantly switched over. When he realized that the surroundings were silent and did not pose any threat, he immediately switched back to his main body.The \u201cinn\u201d was set up by the Linhai Sword Sect. The rent for a small room was not cheap.However, that place was relatively safe. The Heaven Immortal experts from the Linhai Sword Sect were stationed nearby, and the patrolling immortal soldiers were paying plenty of attention.Now, he could only wait for the sect to quieten down before thinking about getting rich.Li Changshou was still a little worried. He walked around the mountain twice and checked the locations where the array foundations were hidden underground.After getting busy for a while, he suddenly caught sight of a figure flying over from Pill Tripod Peak. It soon landed near the straw hut by the lake\u2026Li Changshou hurriedly drove back on the cloud. From afar, he saw a figure standing by the lake.Ling\u2019e stuck her head out of her straw hut and pointed at the lake beside Li Changshou. There was an old man with a bronze walking stick\u2026It was Elder Wan Linyun.\u2026\u201cElder, why are you here?\u201dLi Changshou hurriedly bowed.Wan Linyun turned to look at Li Changshou. There was a hint of appreciation in his eyes. The corners of his lips trembled slightly as he revealed a ruthless sneer.\u201cI used my immortal senses to watch you win against that dragon. However, you were reprimanded by the other elders, so I came by to take a look. You did well this time\u2026\u201d\u201cThe escape technique is one of your own abilities. You don\u2019t have to care too much about others\u2019 opinions. If someone in the sect blames you later, show them this.\u201dAs he spoke, Elder Wan Linyun pushed his slightly coarse palm forward and gave Li Changshou a black piece of jade that had immortal powers.Li Changshou held it with both hands and lowered his head to take a look. He saw that there was a wisp of Qi contained in the jade, and in the middle was the character \u2018Yun\u2019.\u201cTell them what I said,\u201d said Elder Wan Linyun fiercely. \u201cIn the future, I will protect Little Qiong Peak. Not everyone can reprimand you!\u201dLi Changshou felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in his heart, and he quickly thanked him.He knew that the elder was not plotting anything against the Little Poor Peak.Elder Wan Linyun had truly kept himself in recluse for many years and did not know the ways of the world.Previously, Li Changshou and a few elders had been putting on an act to give everyone a way out, but Elder Wan Linyun thought that Li Changshou had been reprimanded by the sect.The escape technique was looked down upon by the disciples.Poisons were also looked down upon by the disciples\u2026Li Changshou pondered in his heart. Perhaps Elder Wan Linyun was so excited because he recalled what happened back then\u2026Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s leg injury was caused by his own master who reprimanded him for studying the Poison Sutra, which was an insult to Dao.Tens of thousands of years later, Elder Wan Linyun went on the path of refining poison to prove to his master that poison was medicine. \u201cPoison is Medicine\u201d was written in the last words of Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s Poison Sutra.However, when Elder Wan Linyun used the poisonous pills to save the Immortal Du Sect from the demons ten thousand years ago, Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s master had already passed away\u2026Li Changshou held onto the jade and bowed deeply.\u201cElder, thank you for your concern.\u201dWan Linyun revealed a stiff smile and said, \u201cRest for a while. I still need to refine pills when I get back.\u201d\u201cI will visit the peak another day.\u201d\u201cYes, you can come anytime.\u201dWan Linyun put away his benevolent smile that could stop babies from crying. He tapped his walking stick and clouds appeared on the ground. He then headed towards Pill Tripod Peak.The elder was there to encourage Li Changshou.Other elders did not commend Li Changshou, but he did.The other seniors in the sects would not protect Li Changshou, but he would.It was just that simple\u2026Li Changshou held the jade pendant in his hand and stood by the lake. He looked into the distance for a long time before he calmed down.The Primordial World may be dangerous, but Primordials are not all evil.\u201cSenior Brother!\u201dLing\u2019e poked her head out from the window and said softly, \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming over again!\u201d\u201cI saw.\u201dLi Changshou put away the jade pendant and sighed. There are so many guests today\u2026\u201cJunior, you\u2019re quite obedient today.\u201d Li Changshou turned around and praised her.Ling\u2019e, who was lying on the window sill, grimaced and exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s all because I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll be scolded by you if I cause trouble for you!\u201d\u201cBy the way, Senior Brother, did you\u2026 admit defeat just now?\u201d\u201cWe won,\u201d Li Changshou said. \u201cHowever, we still have to care about these things in our sect.\u201d\u201cOh, right, pack up later and deliver some tea to my room. \u201cAo Yi, the prince of the Dragon Palace has brought a female companion over. The Little Qiong Peak has to send someone with good looks.\u201dLing\u2019e blinked, pursed her lips and chuckled.She hurriedly opened the isolation array formation outside her own room, which her senior had modified recently. She then started changing her clothes swiftly\u2026Soon, Ao Yi, Han Zhi, and Jiu Wu, who was leading the way, landed slowly while standing on the cloud.Li Changshou went forward to welcome them. He exchanged glances with Jiu Wu, and the two of them instantly understood each other.Previously, Li Changshou had guessed that Ao Yi would visit him and apologize. However, he did not expect that the prince Ao Yi would greet him with cupped hands.\u201cYour Highness, you don\u2019t have to be so polite. Please come in. Your Highness, I\u2019m sorry for being rude.\u201dLi Changshou then led Ao Yi and Han Zhixian into his straw hut.Before Ao Yi could mention what happened, Li Changshou asked, \u201cYour Highness, do you understand the Dao of Danqing?\u201dHe changed the topic to something unrelated.Ao Yi and Han Zhi were soon distracted by Li Changshou.Li Changshou, on the other hand, took out many paintings that he had collected and drawn when he was free. He allowed them to appreciate the paintings.The direction of the topic was completely controlled by Li Changshou. Ao Yi the dragon and Han Zhi the human nodded continuously while standing at the side. They found it to be especially interesting.Jiu Wu was initially worried that the atmosphere would be awkward, but very quickly, the short Daoist was attracted by the topic and joined in the discussion. He also took out his personal collection of paintings\u2026An hour later, Ling\u2019e, who had dressed up seriously, came over to serve tea. The eyes of the three guests lit up.Li Changshou\u2019s junior sister was dressed in a silk dress and wearing exquisite jade hair accessories with white pearl tassels.Her eyes, nose, and pink lips were beautiful. Her ears, eyelashes, and teeth were exquisite.She had gorgeous eyebrows and a jade-like neck.Her skin was as fair as snow, and her slender waist was extremely alluring.At first glance, he felt that she should have been the fairy dancing with the zither in the palace that day.When he looked at her for the second time, he felt that she was like a beauty who had walked out of those paintings\u2026Ling\u2019e\u2019s temperament, looks, and features were all slightly superior to the female immortal of Jie School, Han Zhi.When Ling\u2019e sat beside her senior brother, her clear and glistening gaze made Jiu Wu ponder.Little Jiu is not interested in Changshou, is she?If she, then this junior beside Changshou\u2026I have to remind Little Jiu.He felt a sense of threat because he was experienced.The conversation about Danqing lasted from midnight to daybreak. Ao Yi and Han Zhi both felt that Li Changshou was a refined person.The host, Li Changshou was happy. Seeing that they did not want to leave, Li Changshou had no choice but to change the topic to music\u2026However, Han Zhi suddenly heard her master\u2019s voice and whispered something into Ao Yi\u2019s ear.The young dragon frowned and muttered to himself. With a look of regret, he stood up and bade Li Changshou farewell.Something had happened at Heaven-Breaking Peak. Ao Yi\u2019s senior brothers were also intending to spar with two elders of the Immortal Du Sect. They had to rush over to take a look\u2026Li Changshou sent them out of the straw hut and walked them to the lake. Only then did they part reluctantly.I\u2019ve finally sent them away\u2026The second prince of the Dragon Palace, who looked like a young man, smiled and said, \u201cBrother Changshou, if you\u2019re free, please come to Golden Ao Island to play. We\u2019ll welcome you warmly and we can have a long talk.\u201d\u201cSure, sure.\u201dAo Yi and Han Zhi hurried to the Heaven-Breaking Peak. Jiu Wu gave Li Changshou a thumbs-up and chased after them.Li Changshou waved his hand and thought to himself,Let\u2019s meet again if fate allows\u2026Of course, it would be best if we don\u2019t.After Li Changshou sent away the troublesome ones, he stretched his back and focused his immortal senses on the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Exalted Wang Qing is going to attack again.Although Li Changshou wanted to go and take a look as well, he felt that there had been enough trouble that day. Therefore, he decided to watch the \u201csparring session\u201d between the Heaven Immortals from afar.In the straw hut, Ling\u2019e, who was in a good mood, had already started to pack her things diligently. She put away her cup and plate and tidied up the scattered paintings\u2026Her gaze was attracted by a scroll of painting that had some of its contents exposed. She tilted her head and looked at it. She then saw the sentence written when she lifted her head\u2026\u201cMy Love.\u201dThe handwriting belonged to Senior Brother\u2019s loved one?Hehe, I want to see what kind of woman you like.Ling\u2019e stole a glance at Li Changshou\u2019s back as he stood by the lake. She then pulled out the painting and slowly unrolled it.The thing was actually\u2026 a secret treasure for retirement.It was the secret treasure that Li Changshou had eliminated in his early years. It was the prototype of the tool he would use to calm his mind and heart\u2026It was named \u201cAged Beauties\u201d!Due to the exquisite workmanship and superior painting techniques that were used, Li Changshou had kept it as an emergency secret treasure.It had been thrown into the storage bag that contained all the completed paintings. It had been more than ten years since then. Yet, Li Changshou had accidentally taken it out again but he did not display it.Ling\u2019e kept unrolling the scroll, and soon, she saw many \u201cbeauties\u201d. Her hands began to tremble, and her legs turned to jelly. She fell to the side of the table.Uh\u2026What should I do?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayExalted Wang Qing is indeed powerful. His cultivation level is high, his mystical abilities are fierce, and he has many Dharma treasures.The main point is, he has scheming tricks too.Exalted Wang Qing and the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island were sparring outside the mountain-protecting array formation. The after-effects of the battle caused the array formation to sway back and forth, causing the Primordial Energy within a radius of hundreds of kilometers to fluctuate\u2026Hundreds of kilometers outside the mountain, an Earth Immortal Dao cultivator, who had turned himself into a tree stump, was still sleeping soundly. He was not disturbed at all\u2026Li Changshou was quite impressed by his master\u2019s ability to stay calm-as-usual and focused.In the battle, Exalted Wang Qing had displayed his domineering aura and style, giving Li Changshou some enlightenment about fights between many intermediate immortals.Apart from the Sect Leader and the Grand Elders, who were in seclusion all year round, Exalted Wang Qing was considered the strongest in the Immortal Du Sect.However, after cultivating for ten thousand years, Exalted Wang Qing was still unable to break through to the Golden Immortal realm. Even in the East Continent, he could not be considered an expert.Heaven Immortals still had limited lifespans. No matter how powerful their mystical abilities were or how many Dharma treasures they had, they would not be able to avoid aging and time would still take its toll on them.Only Golden Immortals\u2026 would enjoy immortality\u2026Only by using one\u2019s own Dao to protect one\u2019s own body would one be able to escape the fate of going through the standard cycle of life. Only then would one be able to live as long as heaven and earth. Only then would one be able to take the first step in the Primordial World.That was only the first step.It only meant that a true expert could somewhat take a serious look at him.Li Changshou, who had been watching the battle by the lake, stood still with his hands behind his back. After watching the battle, he had gained some insight. However, he quickly accepted all of it. He suppressed his cultivation level and did not make a breakthrough.This small realm is still not strong enough yet.Although it was stated in the Inaction Sutra said that one needed to let nature take its course, and that doing nothing is an achievement, it was mainly meant to prevent cultivators from forcing themselves to impatiently cultivate to a certain realm.Li Changshou\u2019s pursuit of perfection in the lower realms was against the true meaning of the Inaction Sutra, but there were no side effects.His long sleeve was flicked gently, and a gentle breeze blew past. There was nothing strange about it.He turned around, but his little junior sister was nowhere to be seen.Li Changshou scanned his surroundings with his immortal senses and saw Ling\u2019e sitting in front of her dressing table. She was facing the glazed glass mirror that he had given her, admiring her beauty\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re a narcissist.\u201dLi Changshou chuckled and turned around to leave the Pill Chamber.The array formations around the Pill Chamber were all activated. A few wooden plaques were erected outside the array formation. :There were some words engraved on them\u2014\u201dIf there\u2019s anything you need, please enter the array. You will be able to detect something when you\u2019re cultivating in seclusion.\u201dOnce again, he sat down cross-legged behind the Pill Furnace and held onto the jade token that could control the array.Li Changshou thought about it for a while and realized that there might be changes in the future. In the end, he had no choice but to shake his head helplessly.Karma is hard to predict.His trip to the Northern Continent had caused all sorts of troubles to arise.Due to the fact that he had gone out to transcend the tribulation, he ended up getting involved in the matter with the South Ocean Sea God\u2026Right, how much merit from incense offerings do I have now?Li Changshou felt the power of his merit. He could vaguely see a faint golden cloud around his essence soul.Li Changshou pinched his fingers and made some calculations before feeling his aura surging. He almost cursed!It has only been a few years, how could there be more than 600 statues?More than six hundred villages and towns are performing the useless worships to the Sea God?Are incense offerings really such a lucrative business in the mortal world!?!He carefully sensed the situation again before secretly gritting his teeth\u2026Outrageous!This Xiong Village is too outrageous!They actually did not delve into the manufacturing industry and the entire village claims themselves to be the messengers of the Sea God in the South Sea. They are showing off their exaggerated muscles everywhere and promoting the mystical abilities of the Sea God in the South Sea. They are using this opportunity to make a fortune!If you trust the Sea God, you\u2019ll have great strength!My foot!Li Changshou\u2019s lips twitched as he quickly thought of a solution.Things cannot continue developing like this. Otherwise, the Sea God Sect will truly rise!After so many years, the Western Sect may not have come looking for me and I\u2019ve also earned a lot of merits, he is definitely a huge snake in the grass!However, what could the Sea God, who was in charge of this matter, do?I can\u2019t show his face, I\u2019ll definitely be targeted.I have to stay far away from the South Sea. I have to stay in the Immortal Du Sect in the East Continent.The Immortal Du Sect had been in trouble several times. For example, the time when Elder Wan Linyun became famous was because the immortals in the sect killed some demons and provoked a group of them that attacked the Immortal Du Sect.When the Immortal Du Sect was first established, it had fought with other Immortal Sects for the spirit meridians, which resulted in a huge battle between Immortal Sects\u2026How could the old Saint care about such a conflict?Even the founder of the Immortal Du Sect, the Perfected Du\u2019e, wasn\u2019t too \u201cmotivated\u201d to appear.However, if the Western Sect dared to seek the Immortal Du Sect because of the incident that happened in the South Sea, the experts from Ren School would definitely deal with it.That was a battle between Saints. The nature of the battle was naturally different.\u201cI should go to the Hundred Mortal Hall and pay my respects.\u201dHowever, at the end of the day, isn\u2019t this all because the Western Sect is too incompetent?A group of them decided to sell incense offerings. They had put in a lot of effort to hatch a plot, but in the end, they could not even compete with a Sea God who did not even reveal his true body!Li Changshou raised his head and sighed. He then felt a little helpless.If the matter were to really cause trouble in the future, he could only say one thing\u2026\u201cYou are looking for the Sea God of the South Sea. What does it have to do with Li Changshou, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect?\u201dLi Changshou closed his eyes and focused his mind on the paper effigy. He observed the surroundings of the square and quickly got busy.After completing the elixirs and exchanging them for spiritual herbs and precious materials, I will go into seclusion and stay on the mountain for twenty years!I\u2019ll have to put the money-making matters aside for now.After all\u2026Staying alive is the most important.\u2026\u201cHow can I do that? My appearance has already been decided on\u2026\u201dAfter the Qi Refinement cultivators broke through to the Soul Formation Stage, they could change their appearance.Therefore, most of the women in the younger generation of the sect were beautiful, and the men were decent-looking as well.When one\u2019s cultivation level was high, they would also pay attention to their appearance.However, the Dao companions in the sect or the Qi Refinement cultivators who were already fond of someone else would conscientiously keep their appearances fixed\u2026Most men would keep themselves looking like they were in their thirties. They mostly looked handsome and mature.Women were different. The ones who cared would \u201clock\u201d their appearances whenever they felt that they looked the most beautiful.For example, Ling\u2019e knew that she herself, Youqin Xuanya, Liu Yan\u2019er, her Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu, as well as the other senior and junior sisters whom she was close to, had all locked their appearances. In the future, their appearances and figure would be the same\u2026That made it difficult for them to age naturally\u2026Although Ling\u2019e knew that it would be very difficult to win Li Changshou\u2019s heart and make him fall for her, she did not expect it\u2026 to be that tough!\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dLing\u2019e sighed softly. She recalled the contents of the painting that she had seen previously and thought about how she should deal with it.Very quickly, Ling\u2019e sat up and took out the small amount of rouge powder she had left. She pinched her chin with her left hand and revealed a thoughtful expression.She could only start with makeup\u2026Since Senior Brother pursues thrill, I, his junior sister, shall go all out!That\u2019d make me worthy of being his junior!\u2026Li Changshou could be considered to have made a fruitful trip to Linhai Town this time. Since he had decided to pause his plan to get rich, he focused on searching for the materials required for him to set up the array formation and reduced the accumulation of spiritual herbs and herbs.He could not have the best of both worlds. Given the current situation, the defense system of the Little Qiong Peak was of utmost priority.This time, the paper effigy had successfully sneaked back from Linhai Town. He drew a diagonal figure-eight as a return route.When he found his master, he heard rhythmic snoring beside the tree stump.The paper effigy looked at the Sensing Stone and realized that no one was investigating the place. He then searched the surroundings in detail.After confirming that the place was safe, the paper effigy returned to the tree stump. His body swayed as he chanted, \u201cLittle, Little, Little\u201d, and turned into his original appearance of a thick paper doll\u2026The paper effigy carried the bulging backpack on its back and raised the square box above its head. It ran to the tree stump and let out a \u201cheya!\u201d before throwing the square box out, after which it gently hit the tree stump.\u201cEh?\u201dThe tree stump, which was sleeping soundly, suddenly turned into a cloud of smoke. Old Daoist Qi Yuan stretched his back and stood up, looking at the square box beside his feet.\u201cMaster, I\u2019m back with the box.\u201d\u201cAre you done?\u201d Qi Yuan smiled and asked. He put the box into his sleeve and walked towards the sect.Li Changshou\u2019s mind immediately returned to his main body. He kept telling his master about what had happened previously.In other words, it was the matter about the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island visiting the sect to discuss the Dao, as well as the sparring session with Ao Yi which he had won.After hearing his recount, Qi Yuan felt regretful about the fact that he had missed out on such a lively event\u2026\u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry about going out later,\u201d Li Changshou said. He continued, \u201cMaster, you should focus on your cultivation and try your best to avoid going out. The last time we discussed the Dao, the people from Jie School fought a total of three battles. All of them were defeated. I\u2019m afraid there will be more issues that will surface after that.\u201dQi Yuan looked at the distant mountain gate and muttered softly, \u201cWhat issues can there be? There\u2019s no need for Jie School to go against us for such a trivial matter.\u201dLi Changshou replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of being interrupted. I\u2019m just afraid that someone might make use of this matter to create an issue. Now that the conflict between the Jie School and Chan School has worsened, there might be people thinking\u2026\u201d\u201cThinking about what?\u201d\u201cUsing someone else to achieve their agenda.\u201dQi Yuan shuddered and mumbled, \u201cChangshou, should we inform the sect about this?\u201dLi Changshou sent a voice transmission. \u201cMaster, we\u2019re easily targeted. For the sake of safety, it\u2019s best to wait and see for now. Besides, if I can think of this, the other experts in the sect definitely can too. \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dQi Yuan thought about it and realized that it was true.Li Changshou, who was meditating in the Pill Chamber, sensed that his junior was about to enter the array formation. Thus, he told his master, \u201cMaster, come back and we\u2019ll talk about this matter. I have one more thing to report to you.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Li Changshou closed the array formation around the Pill Chamber and let Ling\u2019e in.However, he kept his immortal senses fixed on his master until the latter entered the sect. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief.Master\u2019s cultivation level is too low and it\u2019d be worrying if he goes out.Li Changshou remained seated and carefully speculated if others would make use of the fact that Ao Yi and his group had visited for a Dao discussion.He had heard many people talking about the matter in Linhai Town, which was why he realized the possible consequences of the matter.Of course, the people who were talking about the matter were all talking about how powerful Exalted Wang Qing was. No one would mention the young disciple who liked to use the Earth Escape technique to sneak in some attacks.That made Li Changshou quite satisfied.In fact, Li Changshou had always felt that the Western Sect had contributed greatly to the Great God-Conferment Tribulation.It was because the Western Sect had obtained far too many benefits from it.They transcended others, snatched treasures, obtained pets\u2026The conflicts between the three sects that have arisen after the Three Pure Ones split up, have been greatly magnified and blown up. Could it be that the two Western Saints have schemed against them as well?This question\u2026\u201cSenior Brother~~\u201dA sweet voice suddenly sounded from outside the door.His junior sister was there again. Every once in a while, she would do such meaningless things.Li Changshou looked in the direction of the voice and immediately saw Ling\u2019e, who was clad in a long dress with wide sleeves and raising her left hand to cover her face. She was walking slowly into the Pill Chamber.\u201cJunior Sister, I\u2019m thinking about serious matters. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Li Changshou smiled. \u201cDid the Hundred Poisons Bees sting your face?\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019re so annoying!\u201dLing\u2019e chided him softly. Then, with a hint of shyness, she moved the sleeve away from her face and revealed\u2026She revealed\u2026 her face.She had thick makeup on, and she made her face look aged and wrinkled by pasting many pieces of paper on it\u2026Ling\u2019e looked at the look of shock on his face and smiled smugly in her head. She bowed at him and deliberately said in a hoarse voice, \u201cGreetings.\u201dLi Changshou opened his mouth and sat still on the meditation cushion. He could not move at all and looked like he had been petrified.\u2026On a deserted island in the South Ocean less than a hundred kilometers from the land, three Daoists were kneeling on a reef, their faces as pale as sheets.Buzz\u2014The sound of mosquitoes grew clearer in the waves. The three of them were Perfected Immortals, but cold sweat kept rolling down their foreheads.All of a sudden, an array formation appeared out of nowhere. Wisps of gray Qi floated in all directions, and the surroundings turned dark.Rays of blood-red light gathered at the side, forming a figure that was in a blood-colored dress.It was a woman who was so beautiful that she looked a little demonic. She was absolutely gorgeous and her figure was exaggeratedly stunning. Clad in nothing but a red robe, she walked towards the three of them barefooted.She stretched out her slender fingers and tapped one of them on the forehead. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. A streak of blood flashed across her seductive face\u2026The True Immortal, on the other hand, did not even get to let out a single scream. In an instant, he was reduced to dust that scattered with the wind.The woman snorted and she admired her long and slender fingers. She then said in a hoarse yet sultry voice, \u201cThis tastes horrible.\u201d\u201cI told you to search for the so-called Sea God\u2019s true body in the South Ocean, but you\u2019re only kneeling here and begging me to spare you. Why? Do you think I won\u2019t eat if I\u2019m not hungry?\u201dThe remaining two Daoists hurriedly lowered their heads. Their bodies were trembling, and they did not even dare to breathe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLord Envoy!\u201dOn the reef, a Daoist said in a shaky voice, \u201cWe have visited everywhere and we had also watched the Xiong Village from outside for a long time\u2026 However, we could not find the whereabouts of the Sea God at all!\u201d\u201cPlease have mercy on us, Lord Envoy! We are willing to search for mortal blood for you, for a thousand years!\u201d\u201cMortal?\u201d The woman\u2019s gaze was icy cold. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about mortal blood? Not only does it not contain any spiritual energy, but it will also even cause me to lose merit.\u201d\u201cAll of you have been following me for such a long time. You should know that I have already cleared all the negative karma left behind by my cultivation. I no longer kill mortals.\u201d\u201cAs for you two, hmph! On account that my sect is still in the midst of using humans, I will temporarily exempt both of you from being punished for performing poorly.\u201dThe two of them heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly exclaimed, \u201cThank you, Lord Envoy!\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord Envoy!\u201dThe woman glanced at the two of them coldly. The two Perfected Immortals quickly shut their mouths and continued to kneel, not daring to breathe.These human Qi Refinement cultivators are really useless.The woman snorted coldly and squinted her long and narrow phoenix-like eyes. She stared at the ocean that was far away, thinking about the orders she had received from the sect.Her Dao name was Wen Jing. She was originally a Blood-Winged Black Mosquito that had obtained the Dao. She was neither a demon nor a spirit. Instead, she was an ancient ferocious demon.Actually, she was a queen!Before the six ancient Saints had attained their Dao, she had led the Blood-Winged Black Mosquitoes to harm the Western living beings. Later on, she was restrained by the two Western Saints, but they did not kill her.Back then, the two Saints of the Western Sect had already obtained the Purple Qi bestowed by the Dao Ancestor. However, they had yet to comprehend the method of meritorious sanctification.It had been a long time since Daoist Wen Jing had succeeded in cultivating Dao in secret. She had become the Plague Envoy of the Western Sect and specialized in doing the dirty work that would harm the reputation of the Western Sect.She was a vicious person who would kill without batting an eyelid.The reason she chose such an enchanting appearance during her transformation was so as to make it easier for her to engage in dangerous schemes.After being forced to join the Western Sect, Daoist Wen Jing had been using incense offerings and merits to get rid of her negative karma. Now, her negative karma had been reduced to zero.However, the Heavenly Dao had sensed it and forbade her from obtaining any merit, thus making her feel infuriated.I really want to stab this prejudiced Heavenly Dao of the human race!Just as Daoist Wen Jing was thinking about it, she heard the two people who were at the side talking again\u2026\u201cLord Envoy, the South Ocean Sect has only occupied the periphery. The incense offerings we set up have occupied a large area in the Southwest region of the South Continent\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, we\u2026 didn\u2019t lose much this time.\u201d\u201cLord Envoy, why don\u2019t we secretly destroy the Xiong Village\u2026\u201dDaoist Wen Jing turned to look at her subordinate who was trembling and too afraid to say anything.He only hated himself for having a mouth!\u201cKilling mortals would only increase one\u2019s negative karma. There would be no benefits.The attractive Daoist who was clad in a blood-red robe criticized coldly, \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is the person who put up the incense offerings here. I want to suck away all of his merit and blood essence. This person has erected so many statues for offerings. His schemes are far more profound than the trash that you offer.\u201dShe took a few steps to the side, her body swaying in an alluring manner. However, the two of them did not even dare to lift their eyelids.Daoist Wen Jing pondered for a moment and said, \u201cThe South Ocean is far away from the West. There are only hundreds of thousands of living beings in this place. If we lose them, we lose them. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cNow, I have something more important to ask of you. In the East Continent, there is an immortal sect called the Immortal Du Sect. It can barely be considered an undertaker of the Ren School. A few days ago, it fought against a few lousy Heaven Immortals from the Golden Ao Island.\u201d\u201cToday, you will head to the East Continent to investigate this matter and see if there is anything you can do about it. If you do well, I will grant you some rewards and allow you to make up for your mistakes.\u201dThe two of them looked at each other, their eyes filled with the joy of surviving a calamity.They then exclaimed with vigor, \u201cYes, Lord!\u201d\u201cGo. You will know the consequences if you mess up or expose your identity.\u201dDaoist Wen Jing gently waved her slender fingers.The two of them quickly retreated. They jumped into the sea and left the array formation.\u201cThey\u2019re really pieces of garbage that can only be used to gather information.\u201dThere was a hint of coldness in Daoist Wen Jing\u2019s eyes. With a flick of her finger, two black mosquitoes flew out and landed on the napes of the two Perfected Immortals without making a sound. The two of them did not notice it at all\u2026\u201cIf anything happens to them, kill them. Do not leave any traces.\u201dThe black mosquito replied in his heart, \u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dThe person who had given her orders to make an issue out of the sparring session between the junior disciple of Ren School and the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island was a disciple of the Great Saint and Deputy Sect Master of the Western Sect.It seemed like a small matter, but Daoist Wen Jing knew very well that it involved the pride of the three Dao Sects and the saints.She had to devise a plan carefully and not reveal herself.If she was careless and exposed the fact that the Western Sect had been trying to split up the three sects, she would be killed by the two Saints of the Western Sect without the intervention of the experts of the Dao Sects.If that were to happen, she, the fierce demon, would become the culprit who had provoked the Three Sects\u2026Although she had been working hard for the Western Sect, it did not mean that she, Daoist Wen Jing, was willing to succumb.Succumb?She was the queen of a clan!If not for the fact that the Second Saint of the Western Sect had captured all the large black mosquitoes of her clan and used them as a threat towards her, she would have long sucked all the sanctimonious Deputy Sect Masters dry!\u201cHumph!\u201dDaoist Wen Jing swept her sleeve, and her enchanting figure turned into a streak of blood that disappeared along with the array formation around her.There was nothing on the surface of the ocean, leaving only the sounds of mosquitoes lingering in the air.Only the sounds could be heard but there was no trace of them at all.That was probably a secret technique passed down by the ancestors of the Mosquitoes.\u2026\u201cStinky Senior Brother!\u201dOn the Little Qiong Peak, Lan Ling\u2019e was kneeling under a willow tree by the lake. She used a handkerchief to wipe the water off her face and washed away the \u201cmakeup\u201d that she had painstakingly put on.\u201cBad Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cHe chose not to explain clearly what that painting is and caused me to make a fool out of myself!\u201d\u201cIn the end, he even said that my Dao Heart isn\u2019t stable because I behave abnormally every day, but I did all that to make him happy!\u201d\u201cIf he wants me to copy the scriptures a hundred times, so be it! What\u2019s the big deal!?!\u201dLi Changshou was in his master\u2019s straw hut, and he could not help but put his hand on his forehead when he heard Ling\u2019e complaining softly by the lake.Uh\u2026Qi Yuan sat on the round chair and gestured for Li Changshou to take a seat beside him. He asked, \u201cChangshou, do you have anything to discuss with me?\u201d\u201cMaster, let\u2019s activate the surrounding array formations. I\u2019m afraid that the walls have ears.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Yuan nodded and activated the array formations around the straw hut. He then stared at Li Changshou and scrutinized him.Previously, before Ling\u2019e revealed that her senior brother was extraordinary, Old Daoist Qi Yuan felt that his eldest disciple was timid and afraid of death, though he had excellent potential and his cultivation progress had always been quite good.However, after being trapped in the Bewitching Array of the Pill Chamber, Old Daoist Qi Yuan thought about the interaction that he had had with his eldest disciple in the past\u2026He still could not find any clues.However, the array formation around the Pill Chamber\u2026The mysterious \u201cQi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra\u201d\u2026And the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts that he could not understand\u2026\u201cChangshou.\u201d Qi Yuan leaned forward and said in a low voice, \u201cTell me honestly, which realm are you really at now?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cWhen I went home before this, I went through the Tribulation Transcendence.\u201dI accidentally ascended during the Tribulation Transcendence\u2026 Naturally, he could not say the latter half of the sentence directly.Qi Yuan nodded and felt a little more at ease.Finally, he confirmed the true cultivation level of his eldest disciple.After the Tribulation Transcendence, one would become an Essence Immortal.He only took 123 years to become an immortal. His aptitude is considered top-tier amongst all the junior immortals!Qi Yuan frowned again. \u201cThen why did you hide your cultivation level? Wouldn\u2019t it be good to show your cultivation level and receive the protection of the sect?\u201d\u201cMaster, the world is a difficult place to live in. The human heart is unpredictable.\u201dLi Changshou said softly, \u201cThink about it. When I was at the Void Return Stage, I had always been acting like I was at the Soul Formation Stage. If someone wanted to deal with me,they would naturally attack like they were dealing with a Qi Refinement cultivator who is at the Soul Formation stage. Then, there will be a high chance that the other party will reveal some loopholes and it\u2019ll be more likely for me to survive.\u201d\u201cYou should understand this logic.\u201dThe old Daoist priest, Qi Yuan, nodded and pondered. He felt that something was amiss, but he could not put his finger on it.Li Changshou continued, \u201cI have been pretending to be an outstanding disciple in the sect, whose strength is closely following that of the junior immortals. The monthly allowance I can obtain is only 20% less than those junior immortals.\u201d\u201cHowever, the benefit that I received is the fact that no one knows my abilities or name. Thus, no one will plot against me.\u201d\u201cMaster, think about it. If the Little Qiong Peak produces a junior immortal, others will definitely be jealous. If a head disciple appears, he might be targeted by the other peaks\u2026\u201d\u201cThere will also be competition for cultivation resources between the peaks. After all, the income in the sect is stable.\u201dQi Yuan pondered for a while before nodding slowly.In the past, he had always felt that his eldest disciple\u2019s evil ways were wayward and twisted. Now that his eldest disciple was stronger than him, he suddenly felt that those principles\u2026 actually made sense\u2026Qi Yuan stroked his beard and sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I haven\u2019t been thinking enough.\u201dLi Changshou raised his eyebrows. He did not expect his master to be more gullible than he had imagined\u2026Ahem, he\u2019s easier to convince than imagined.\u201cMaster, what I want to tell you today is about the way out that you, Junior, and I can take in the future.\u201d\u201cWay out?\u201dQi Yuan did not know whether to laugh or cry. He chided, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Isn\u2019t it wonderful for us to cultivate in the sect and enjoy ourselves every day? Or do you think that the sect is no longer enough for an immortal like you?\u201d\u201cThe sect is naturally very good to us. If the sect is in trouble, I will definitely help the entire sect while I am alive. I will definitely take revenge in the future.\u201dLi Changshou said seriously, \u201cBut Master, don\u2019t you want to live longer?\u201d\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Qi Yuan sighed and continued, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry about me. I am already satisfied with the fact that I could turn into a Turbid Immortal and have the chance to cultivate to the Perfected Immortal realm\u2026\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cMaster, there is a way that you can extend your lifespan after you reach the Perfected Immortal realm. Furthermore, it will be beneficial to me and Junior Sister in the future.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be good for you and Ling\u2019e? Tell me about it.\u201dLi Changshou pointed at the table and wrote two words on it.Heavenly Courts, ancient edition!Qi Yuan frowned and muttered to himself.Li Changshou sighed in his heart.Master should be repulsed by the Heavenly Courts\u2019 \u201cpublic residence\u201d, like most cultivators.It can\u2019t be helped. After all, cultivation in the mountains is free and easy and that\u2019s far better than being controlled by the heavens and being ordered around.Li Changshou had prepared a speech in advance to see if he could persuade his master to go to the Heavenly Courts.If Li Changshou\u2019s Master refused to, Li Changshou would not force him either. This time, he was just trying his luck\u2026\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dJust as Li Changshou was about to speak, Qi Yuan asked in confusion,\u201cHow does that place benefit my lifespan?\u201dHuh?Li Changshou was stunned. \u201cMaster, don\u2019t you know the benefits of this place?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard people mention that after the Great Magi-Demon War, a few saints set up that place on the ruined Demon Court.\u201d Qi Yuan frowned and continued, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of the details.\u201dLi Changshou was rendered speechless.At this moment, the presence of the Heavenly Courts\u2026 is simply too tempting!\u201cMaster, listen to my detailed explanation.\u201dQi Yuan nodded and listened to Li Changshou\u2019s explanation with interest.Half a day later.Li Changshou walked back to the Pill Chamber with his hands behind his back. The small box was already taken back by his master.He did not expect his master to accept his suggestion to take on a job in the Heavenly Courts. Moreover, he was quite curious as well. He would have more motivation to cultivate and advance to the Perfected Immortal realm in the future\u2026Now that I think about it, ever since Master became a Turbid Immortal, he had actually been somewhat out of place in the sect.If Master could break through to the Perfected Immortal realm as soon as possible and become a small minister in the Heavenly Courts or take on a small position, he would be much more relaxed\u2026Li Changshou gave his master numerous pills in a bid to help him increase his cultivation level.He was already a Turbid Immortal Immortal, so there was no need for him to be too particular about it. His future potential was limited, and it was not impossible for him to use pills to cultivate.When Master reaches the Perfected Immortal realm, I can use my strong ties and connection with Elder Moon to let Master become a clerk in the Heavenly Courts. That would not be a problem\u2026The second step of the plan is rather easy.Next, it would depend on when Master can break through to the Perfected Immortal realm. It would probably take another thousand years.Or even two thousand years\u2026However, it will definitely be way before the Great God-Conferment Tribulation is formed!It was much more difficult for a Turbid Immortal to cultivate for a Turbid than it was for a Heaven Immortal to become an Essence Immortal. One reason for that was also because he could not obtain all the Heavenly Tribulation opportunities.Before that, should I build a safe house outside the mountain?Li Changshou slowly pondered.If the three of them went to the Heavenly Courts and reported that the Immortal Du Sect was in danger of being exterminated, he could have a place to stay together with his master and junior\u2026After strolling in the forest for a while, Li Changshou decided to give up on that idea.The most important thing now is to get the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Recovery Array ready.In fact, he did not have that many precious materials that he could use to build a safe house that had a complete array formation.The moment Li Changshou returned to the Pill Chamber, his immortal senses captured Jiu Wu\u2019s figure.Uncle-Master Jiu Wu had indeed helped me a lot when Ao Yi suddenly came to visit me this time. Regardless of whether he had helped or not, I have to be grateful.The short Daoist seemed to be in a good mood. He entered the isolation array outside the Little Qiong Peak and burst into laughter.\u201cHahahaha!\u201d\u201cDisciple-Nephew Changshou, guess what I brought you? This time, you\u2019ve dealt with the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island quite well. The sect has given you many rewards!\u201dAs he spoke, the short Daoist stood on the cloud and threw two treasure pouches over. \u201cThese are all precious materials meant for setting up array formations. It can be said that the sect is encouraging you to continue studying array formations!\u201dLi Changshou used his immortal power to control the treasure pouches. He inspected it from afar before holding it in his hand.Jiu Wu was no longer surprised by that. He stopped a hundred feet in the air.Li Changshou cupped his hands and bowed. \u201cThank you, Uncle-Master.\u201d\u201cSigh, it\u2019s too early to thank us.\u201dJiu Wu took out a silver-white sword and threw it over casually. Pretending to be indifferent, he said, \u201cThis is your permit to enter the Dao Repository. I spent a bit of effort to ask for it from the other side.\u201d\u201cIn the inner hall of the Dao Repository, there are array formations and alchemy manuals that only Perfected Immortals can read. How is it?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dAs he spoke, Jiu Wu winked.Li Changshou\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He immediately grabbed the silver-white sword and fiddled with it twice. The corners of his lips curled up slightly.He did not expect that there to be such benefits this time!It was a slight loss for him when he exposed his cultivation and attracted attention previously.From the looks of it, he had really gained something!\u201cUncle-Master, come in and sit down.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Jiu Wu waved his hand and sighed. \u201cAh, I\u2019m meant to be a slave. I\u2019m going out again soon. Hurry and become an immortal soon, so you can become an executive of the sect as well. You will then know how tiring this job is.\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He asked, \u201cWhat are you going out for, Uncle-Master?\u201dJiu Wu smiled and said, \u201cThe Middle Continent seems to be going to organize an Immortal Sect Meeting for the Three Sects. It is estimated to be held in 50 or 100 years. I\u2019m going to attend it with two elders and have a detailed discussion with the great sects on behalf of Immortal Du Sect.\u201d\u201cHowever, the Immortal Du Sect is too new compared to those large sects. We don\u2019t dare to speak much. We can only listen to the other sects.\u201dA sect meeting between the three sects?What\u2026 is that?Is this related to the Great God-Conferment Tribulation?Li Changshou pondered for a while. Jiu Wu seemed to be in a hurry. After reminding him to cultivate properly, he immediately turned around and left.Li Changshou looked up and hurriedly said, \u201cUncle-Master, wait!\u201dHe should have shouted \u2018stop\u2019 instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter leaving the Little Qiong Peak, Jiu Wu looked at the porcelain bottle in his hand and thought to himself in amazement.I never expected that Disciple-Nephew Changshou would be so familiar with Elder Wan Linyun, who is the most aloof person in the sect.This is a good thing that could poison Heaven Immortals\u2026Changshou is very thoughtful. He actually gave me such expensive poisonous pills to protect myself.Jiu Wu chuckled and raised his sleeve to take a look. He chose to place the bottle of pills in a treasure pouch in his sleeve that was rather easily distinguished. He then continued to fly towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak.In front of the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou sat on a reclining chair and continued playing with the silver-white sword.The Dao Repository Inner Hall\u2026Tsk, the Dao Repository Inner Hall!It contains the core Dao bearings of the Immortal Du Sect, information about high-level Dharma spells, mystical abilities, alchemy, array formations, refining artifacts, and other precious manuals.There are also some medicinal herbs and precious materials that I could exchange for, using my monthly allowance!Li Changshou felt that he was smiling like a lecherous man who had seen a brothel and had also gotten a huge sum of money from his wealthy father\u2026He coughed twice and immediately regained his usual composure.He was indeed very happy about that.After transcending the tribulation and ascending, what he lacked the most were strong foundations.However\u2026 he could not go to the repository immediately.He decided to settle down for a while first. It would not be too late for him to head to the Dao Repository after the sect stopped paying that much attention to him.Anyway, Heaven-Splitting Peak was right there. It wouldn\u2019t run away. There was no reason for him to cause trouble for himself.The poisonous pills that were given to Jiu Wu were also a token of gratitude. They were indeed from Elder Wan Linyun.The high-grade immortal pills refined by every alchemist would be slightly different. The pills refined by Li Changshou had some slight \u201cpersonal characteristics\u201d.During such situations where he was giving pills and not a poisonous pill treatment, he could only use Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s poisonous pills\u2026His Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu had not come out of seclusion for a long time. If he had taken out the high-grade poisonous pills that he had refined in the sect, it would be difficult to explain clearly where the toxin-suppressing immortal power came from.Speaking of which, Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu has been in seclusion for so long\u2026 Could it be that he is about to break through to the Heaven Immortal realm this time?That\u2019s not right. He should still be a little lacking\u2026Li Changshou was actually more worried about his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu. His cultivation would inevitably be affected if he kept running around the sect.That was probably one of the reasons why cultivators of the Dao Sects were unwilling to cultivate in the Heavenly Courts.Li Changshou put away the silver sword and scanned the lake with his immortal senses. He realized that Ling\u2019e was still writing her scriptures. He sighed softly in his heart.It\u2019s a good thing that my mental endurance is strong enough, so you didn\u2019t succeed in scaring me.He activated the surrounding array formation and used the paper effigy as a disguise. He then turned into a wisp of green smoke and floated into the underground chamber.After some careful thought, he felt that he had to thank the Second Prince of the Dragon Palace, Ao Yi, for causing trouble for nothing\u2026Although it had always been troublesome to encounter Ao Yi, the outcome this time was not bad.During the Demon-Sweeping Meet in the Dragon Palace, he had finally obtained the True Samadhi Flames cultivation technique.After the Qi Refinement cultivators of Jie School had come to create trouble for him, he obtained the permission to enter the Dao Repository Inner Hall\u2026During the previous encounter, he was unlucky to have ended up losing a large amount of incapacitating agents. However, he did not dare to go to the Dragon Palace to get a \u2018thank you\u2019 gift bag\u2026If I meet the Prince of the Dragon Palace again\u2026Forget it, it\u2019s best that I don\u2019t.Li Changshou shook his head. He had already reached the center of the Recovery Array. He walked towards the rock layer in front of him\u2026At the same time\u2026In the Treasure Pool of Golden Ao Island, Ao Yi, who was hiding at the bottom of the pool and cultivating the Ice-Condensed Earth technique, shivered.The shiver made him wake up from the Dao Enlightenment realm.The scene of him losing to Li Changshou, a disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, surfaced in Ao Yi\u2019s heart. He did not feel any resentment, however.His mystical abilities were inferior but there was nothing to be resentful about.If I can\u2019t stop focusing on victory and bring myself to admit defeat, how am I going to influence the dragons?A look of relief flashed across Ao Yi\u2019s eyes.Then, he thought about how he and Li Changshou had spent a night admiring the Danqing paintings and reciting poems\u2026Judging from Brother Changshou\u2019s cultured personality, he is truly a gentleman-like person. He is refined and elegant, a rare gem among the humans.If I have the chance in the future, I must visit the Immortal Du Sect.As for the five senior brothers from Golden Ao Island, they had also suffered defeat in the Immortal Du Sect\u2026On the way back, the eight of them had agreed not to mention the matter after returning to Golden Ao Island.This is for the smooth development of the relationship between the two schools. We\u2019re not feeling embarrassed!\u201cUncle-Master Ao Yi?\u201dA voice suddenly called out from the side of the pool. The azure dragon looked up and saw through the clear water, the young girl Han Zhi who was standing by the pool.A smile appeared on the azure dragon as it transformed into a human body and swam up slowly.Although he did not know why his human body stopped growing, he still had a youthful figure\u2026There were some things that would not be hindered by his bodily size.The young girl who was standing by the pool asked, \u201cAre you not cultivating? Am I disturbing you, Uncle-Master?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I was thinking about something so I did not cultivate. Do you want to go to the East Ocean today?\u201d\u201cIs there beautiful scenery in the East Ocean?\u201d\u201cYes, there are a few beautiful places over there, like the Coral Treasure Forest, Sea Forest Falls\u2026\u201dSoon, the young couple rode the clouds and headed towards the East Ocean.At the end of the island, the pair of terrifying eyes opened again.However, this time, there were more fluctuations.It should be a friendly gaze.\u2026Li Changshou\u2019s immortal senses spread around the Little Qiong Peak as he walked along the stone path, in case anyone approached him.Next, Li Changshou was going to use a large number of precious materials to refine the array foundation, update and expand the array formation system of the Little Qiong Peak.The treasures that Jiu Wu had sent over to him were considered rewards from the sect. They could be used to modify the Confinement array formation and Bewitching Array. He could openly add some lethal array formations that could kill the intruders\u2026As for the outer layer of the array, he naturally had to wait for Jiu Jiu to come out of seclusion before setting it up. His master\u2019s strength was limited, and it would be difficult for him to suppress the spiritual power and stop it from surging when he set up the chain array.He pushed open the wooden door to see that the secret chamber was filled.Thirty-two jade squares were arranged diagonally and neatly. Inside each square, there was solidified \u201ctree pulp\u201d.It was the paper that was used for the Man-Forming Paper Cutouts.The tree saps had been processed dozens of times in an orderly manner. They retained the aura of living beings and could contain Dharma powers and immortal powers.When he was creating paper dolls, Li Changshou looked like he was only using a piece of paper to cut the paper. In fact, the paper itself was considered a Dharma treasure\u2026Li Changshou quickly folded the paper that had been hung up. Then, he covered it with a piece of beast skin that was engraved with special restrictions, after which he walked to the back of the desk.Making paper effigies really required plenty of paper. He had to make a batch of \u2018paper\u2019 every two years.As a result, the old spiritual trees that he had previously moved had become much thinner\u2026Now, we have to start saving paper.The paper effigy is still unstable. It would be a waste to use too much paper.At the thought that he would be able to come into contact with a bunch of high-level array formations and high-level Dharma treasures, and continue to perfect the paper effigy\u2019s incarnation technique, Li Changshou could not help but chuckle\u2026When one is happy, they would smile often and luck would shine on them.However, Li Changshou quickly suppressed his joy.Based on his experience in his previous life, the happier he was, the easier it would be for him to get into trouble.For example, when he graduated from university in his previous life, he had a girlfriend whom he was in a stable relationship with.At that time, his family had given him a sum of money to start a business. Li Changshou started to plan for the future happily and wanted to have the best of both worlds\u2014a successful relationship and career\u2026However\u2026Half a minute before he told her about his plan, his girlfriend broke up with him and officially became his ex-girlfriend.That was the best portrayal of happiness and sorrow!He snapped out of his thoughts and began to handle the materials.For the next half a year, Li Changshou got busy in the secret chamber. He focused on refining the array foundation and expanding the array formation inside the Little Qiong Peak.The wind chime that was made from the Stone of Sensation and was hung outside the Pill Chamber, had not shone for two months\u2026The commotion caused by the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island gradually calmed down.Li Changshou waited for another half a year before he came out of the secret chamber. He changed into a clean robe and flew at a suitable height towards the Dao Repository at the back of the Heaven-Breaking Peak.What was the Dao Repository?It was the place of Dao treasures.Only a small portion of the ancient books there was created by the Immortal Du Sect. Most of the treasures were external items.The past generations of Heaven Immortals and Perfected Immortals in the Immortal Du Sect would leave their useless cultivation techniques, manuals, and miscellaneous items in the Dao Repository.Some of the more valuable ancient books or the copies of profound cultivation technique volumes would be placed in the inner hall.The Dao Repository was huge. The outer hall could hold more than a thousand people. There were bookshelves filled with classics and spell books everywhere.In a few corners, there were also piles of miscellaneous items that had not been taken care of.Don\u2019t underestimate them.They were actually the foundation of the Immortal Du Sect!Li Changshou had once found the incomplete Secret Tome of the Witch Sect in those piles of junk that had been accumulating for countless years. He had also found blood-stained linen film in a piece of tattered beast skin\u2026At that time, he did not go to the outer hall to do those things rashly. He was appointed by the Hundred Mortal Hall to be in charge of cleaning the place.He spent a few years searching carefully.From then on, he received the Hundred Mortal Hall\u2019s commendation. They had given him double his initial monthly allowance for the past few years\u2026Now, Li Changshou no longer rummaged through the miscellaneous items.He had searched everywhere, but there was nothing useful!It was a pity that the carving knife that he had found inside had been destroyed by the Immortal Ascension Tribulation\u2026However, the Immortal Ascension could not destroy the Sutra-writing technique that he had comprehended through another beast-skin scroll.There were dozens of disciples in the outer hall of the Dao Repository.What was interesting was that more than ten people were gathered beside the bookshelves where the books about escape techniques were stored. They were reading about the Five-Element escape techniques that no one had been interested in, as well as other escape techniques that were unorthodox\u2026Li Changshou did not look further. He lowered his head and walked to the deepest part of the outer hall. He found the two doors that were embedded in the rock walls and emitted a faint glow\u2026The Night Luminescent Dharma Pearl emitted a gentle light. An elder was sitting on a meditation cushion in front of the door and resting with his eyes closed.The elder was not too tall. His face was thin, and his long hair was grayish-white. There were no wrinkles on his face, but he seemed to have aged.\u201cElder Qi Ling, there are experts in the sect. Their cultivation level is unknown. They have been guarding the Dao Repository all year round. They rarely go out, and their whereabouts are unknown.\u201dLi Changshou had heard the name of that elder from Jiu Jiu when he went to the North Continent.Li Changshou held the silver-white sword with both hands and bowed. He said, \u201cI wish to enter the inner sect to read the manuals.\u201dElder Qi Ling slowly opened his eyes. There was no change in his gray eyes. He simply stared at the small sword in Li Changshou\u2019s hand without looking at him.\u201cGo in.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAmidst the faint sounds that resulted from friction, the door to the Dao Repository\u2019s inner hall slowly opened. Li Changshou stepped in and disappeared in a flash.Finally\u2026He had sneaked in\u2026\u2026Li Changshou had just entered the inner hall of the Dao Repository.On the other side of the Heaven-Splitting Peak where the Nine Jiu Immortals lived, there was suddenly a thundering explosion. Lightning flashed and the array formation outside was instantly dispersed. A slender figure slowly rose into the sky.The few menial disciples, who were always busy with chores, raised their heads together, each with a look of admiration on their faces.The female immortal who was hovering in the air was surrounded by immortal light, which shone brightly on her face.Her hair fluttered in the wind, but her linen blouse was still tight and the hem of her short skirt swayed gently while she stuck her bare feet downwards\u2026Very quickly, she opened her pure and innocent eyes and revealed a confident smile.Late-stage of the Perfected Immortal realm!I surpassed Fifth Senior Brother and Sixth Senior Sister in one move!I did not expect to make such a huge advancement this time! I\u2019ve been in the Dao Enlightenment state all this while. Unknowingly, such a long time had passed!She placed his hands on his waist and felt smug for a while. She had been holding it in!Hehehe, where is Fifth Senior Brother?Where is Little Shoushou?Is there no one to welcome me out of seclusion?Jiu Jiu reached for her waist and grabbed the small gourd.Seriously, I made a huge leap in my seclusion this time. Master must praise me\u2026\u201cUh!\u201dJiu Jiu looked down at her beloved wine gourd and shook it gently, only to find that there was no sound of water inside.Oh no!I finished all the wine before I went into seclusion. Only then did I feel like I had broken through the bottleneck and entered the Dao Realm!Hiss\u2014After taking a deep breath, Jiu Jiu did not care about posing anymore. She quickly went back to her own pavilion, where she heard the sound of someone rummaging inside the room.Damn it, how could I have any stock!I can\u2019t keep wine!\u201cFifth Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cHelp!\u201dJiu Jiu rushed out of the attic and dashed to Jiu Wu\u2019s attic. However, from afar, she could see that the array formations around Jiu Wu\u2019s attic had been completely activated. There was a wooden sign hanging in front of the door. It read \u201cI have something to do.\u201d\u201cAh! Little Shoushou! Can you give me my salary in advance!?!\u201dJiu Jiu quickly summoned the huge gourd and rushed towards the Little Qiong Peak with it.She was as fast as a flash of light and she shocked a few of her fellow disciples who were passing by\u2026A moment later, in Little Qiong Peak, Ling\u2019e, who was cultivating quietly, suddenly heard the sound of something heavy falling outside the straw hut.Ling\u2019e immediately became alert. Her spiritual senses probed outward while she held a few porcelain bottles in her hand.However, just as she was about to stand up and check, she realized that the array formations outside the straw hut had been forcefully broken!A gray shadow rushed into the door and collapsed on the ground. Ling\u2019e was so frightened that she almost tossed the porcelain bottles in her hand out\u2026That\u2019s not right. The scale is terrifyingly large and the arrays are so elastic that others will bounce off of it\u2026\u201cLittle Aunt-Master?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you!?!\u201dLing\u2019e rushed forward and shouted anxiously.Jiu Jiu lay on the ground weakly. She slowly turned her head, revealing a dejected face that resembled that of a mortal that was on the verge of death in the desert\u2026Ling\u2019e was shocked and at a complete loss.\u201cLittle Aunt-Master, don\u2019t scare me! My senior brother just went to Heaven-Breaking Peak!\u201d\u201cQuick\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu\u2019s lips trembled as she extended her hand towards Ling\u2019e, filled with hope.It was as if she had used the last bit of energy she could muster to say those words\u2026\u201cGive me wine\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her face was red, and she held the empty wine pot in her hand. She let out two sighs of comfort and satisfaction.Beside her, Ling\u2019e was at a loss and did not know if she should laugh or cry. She persuaded, \u201cAunt-Master, you\u2019re too reliant on wine.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d Jiu Jiu sighed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s my habit and my interest. I can\u2019t just throw it away! If I throw it away, I\u2019ll lose my vitality!\u201d\u201cLittle Ling\u2019e, I haven\u2019t seen you for a few years and you\u2019ve gotten prettier again. Come and let me take a look at you!\u201d\u201cAunt-Master, the array formation is broken. Stop fooling around\u2026\u201dLing\u2019e smiled bitterly and dodged lightly. Jiu Jiu, who was slightly drunk, did not force her. She simply pinched Ling\u2019e\u2019s face and leaned back.To her, it was too tiring to sit. It was better to lie down comfortably.\u201cLing\u2019e, why did your senior brother go to the Heaven-Breaking Peak?\u201d\u201cHe should have gone to the Dao Repository Hall. He will probably return soon.\u201d\u201cOh, the Dao Repository Hall\u2026\u201dLing\u2019e folded her skirt and sat elegantly at the side, concocting a new pot of Drunken Immortal Wine for Jiu Jiu.Fortunately, Senior Brother left some kind of incapacitating agent with me\u2026 Ahem, I mean wine. Otherwise, given the situation just now, I\u2019m afraid Little Aunt-Master would have gone crazy.\u201cThank you, Little Ling\u2019e!\u201d\u201cHehe, the people from the Little Qiong Peak are so nice. They have glib tongues and offer me wine. I really like this place.\u201dJiu Jiu continued to mumble, \u201cWhen it comes to cultivation, everyone\u2019s Dao is different. Our Dao is wine. Is that okay?\u201dLing\u2019e chuckled. \u201cOf course.\u201dJiu Jiu lifted the wine pot and poured the remaining wine into her mouth twice before licking her lips.She had drunk a little too quickly just now and thus began to feel sleepy.\u201cLittle Ling\u2019e, let me borrow your bed\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, Jiu Jiu had already carried her gourd to the bed. She turned over and lay down, after which she began to snore.Ling\u2019e smiled bitterly. She tidied up the cups and plates on the table and sat down again. She felt rather dumbfounded by Jiu Jiu\u2019s \u201csin\u201d\u2026Finally, she let out a faint sigh and carried the meditation cushion to the straw hut to meditate.The array outside the house was broken by Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu.When she sleeps after getting drunk, she always ends up throwing some of her clothes and undergarments around\u2026I have to keep an eye on this place to prevent others from taking advantage of her.Ling\u2019e then meditated and tried to get some Dao enlightenment.However, she was thinking about her senior, Li Changshou.Ling\u2019e quickly got distracted and began to think about things like the type of woman her senior brother fancied.However, Ling\u2019e was wrong this time\u2026Li Changshou went to the Dao Repository Hall and did not return even after half a month.After Jiu Jiu woke up, she played the Immortal Life Simulation and dressed up puppets with Ling\u2019e, after which they played dress-up in real life.Finally, after she finished drinking all the wine that Ling\u2019e had, Jiu Jiu got bored again\u2026After waiting for half a month, she wanted to look for Li Changshou to show off her cultivation level and get some wine to drink. In the end, she could not help but stand up!\u201cThis fellow is wasting so much time by going to the Dao Repository Hall!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go to the Dao Repository Palace to find him!\u201d\u201cHey, Aunt-Master\u2026\u201dBefore Ling\u2019e could say anything, Jiu Jiu had already jumped into the air angrily. She sat in front of the gourd and sped towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak!However, when they reached the outer hall of the Dao Repository Palace, Jiu Jiu circled around twice, but she still could not find Li Changshou.She scanned the place with her immortal senses but she could not detect Li Changshou\u2019s aura at all.Has he gone somewhere else?Jiu Jiu carried the huge gourd on her back and sneaked to the inner hall. She sneakily approached Elder Qi Ling and suddenly shouted, \u201cElder!\u201dElder Qi Ling slowly opened his eyes. When he saw Jiu Jiu, he became more energetic and smiled.\u201cLittle Jiu, what are you finding? I\u2019ll go get it for you.\u201d\u201cElder, have you ever seen a disciple who\u2019s in the Void Return stage? His name is Li Changshou, a disciple of the Little Qiong Peak. He\u2019s about\u2026 this tall!\u201dJiu Jiu lifted her arm, stood on tiptoe, and tried to show how tall Li Changshou was.\u201cHe looks rather neat, but he has a very mean personality. He often uses good wine to threaten his adorable and kind Little Aunt-Master, and makes me be at his beck and call!\u201dElder Qi Ling thought about it carefully and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s in the inner hall.\u201dJiu Jiu was stunned. \u201cWhy did you let him go to the inner hall?\u201d\u201cIt seems that he has a permit\u2026\u201dQi Ling mumbled and was about to continue speaking when he realized that Jiu Jiu was no longer beside him.Jiu Jiu had already pushed open the door to the inner hall. She tilted her body and looked inside, but she could not find Li Changshou.\u201cHuh? He\u2019s not here anymore?\u201dJiu Jiu released her immortal senses and searched the place repeatedly. Finally, she found an inconspicuous corner and \u2018saw\u2019 Li Changshou, who was leaning against the wall and reading the jade slip\u2026This guy has hidden himself so well. Is he reading pornographic material?Jiu Jiu narrowed her eyes and smiled, as she got a terrible idea.\u201cElder, I\u2019m going in.\u201d\u201cGo, go.\u201dElder Qi Ling waved his hand without looking back. He closed his eyes and continued to meditate. The smile on his lips remained.Jiu Jiu tiptoed into the inner hall. Under the cover of the bookshelves and shelves, she secretly approached Li Changshou, who was in the corner.There were a few figures in the inner hall. They were all Perfected Immortals in the sect. Some of them were reading ancient books or meditating in the corner.The inner hall was much smaller than the outer hall.However, any one of the ancient books there could be exchanged for a large amount of precious materials and spirit herbs in the town.Apart from the Inaction Sutra, the various Peak Leaders and Elders\u2019 personal treasures could be found there too.For example, Li Changshou was currently reading the Heavenly Mortal Forbidden Tome. There were many advanced blacksmithing restrictions recorded in it, which could be used to forge advanced immortal treasures.Of course, the premise was that the forger had excellent techniques and high-quality materials.This jade slip itself was a Dharma treasure. The jade slip emitted a dense glow and it was guaranteed that the contents engraved on it would not be corroded over time.Hiding behind the bookshelf, Jiu Jiu licked her lips. In her mind, she could already imagine the scene of Li Changshou being scared out of his wits.It was too late!With excellent footwork, Jiu Jiu nimbly turned around. She raised her arm and grimaced, after which she immediately released her aura!\u201cAh!\u201dHowever\u2026Li Changshou raised his left hand and flicked his finger. A light blue pill accurately entered Jiu Jiu\u2019s mouth.\u201cHuh?\u201dJiu Jiu stopped in front of Li Changshou, tilted her head slightly, and chewed the pill.Jiu Jiu made some crunching sounds when she chewed. The fragrance of alcohol lingered in her heart, and a mouthful of sweet liquid slid down her throat. While she was doing so, a wisp of spiritual energy flowed throughout her body\u2026The slightly intoxicating and comfortable feeling made Jiu Jiu let out a soft snort. Her face was slightly flushed.\u201cWhoa\u2026 Delicious! What is this!?!\u201d\u201cShh!\u201dLi Changshou made a hand gesture and hushed her. He put down the jade slip and looked at his young Aunt-Master who was in front of him. He really wanted to\u2026 touch her head.Ahem, she\u2019s my senior so I can\u2019t do that.Little Aunt-Master has finally come out of seclusion.Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cThat was the Spirit Wine Pill which was refined using twelve-flavored spiritual herbs and the essence of alcohol. The effect is only to replenish one\u2019s Primordial Energy, but the taste is indeed rather delectable.\u201dJiu Jiu immediately reached her hand out and looked at the other corners of the inner hall like a thief. When she realized that no one was looking at her, she whispered, \u201cGive me a few more!\u201dShe also cared about her pride.She was a little embarrassed about being fed by her disciple-nephew.Li Changshou casually took out a treasure pouch and said, \u201cThere are sixty of them in here. It\u2019s a gift to congratulate you for coming out of seclusion.\u201d\u201cYou still know the right thing to do!\u201dJiu Jiu patted Li Changshou\u2019s arm in satisfaction. She grabbed the treasure pouch and took out a porcelain bottle that was also an enchanted armament.She placed the huge gourd on her back aside. Like Li Changshou, she leaned against the flat stone wall and looked over\u2026\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cThe various restrictions for refining,\u201d Li Changshou said. \u201cThere are a few restrictions. I want to see if I can use them on the foundation of the array formations.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Aunt-Master, do you have any intention of improving the array formation around the Pill Chamber of Little Qiong Peak?\u201dJiu Jiu blinked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just build the array formations of your Pill Chamber?\u201d\u201cIt had not even been a hundred years. Why are you still trying to improve it? Are you still planning to suppress your spiritual energy and set up the array formation like before?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201dJiu Jiu rolled her eyes and stretched out two fingers. \u201cI want Two-year-old immortal brew, Beauty\u2019s Charm, and the Ganges River\u2019s Dry Wine! I also want three hundred Spirit Pills!\u201dLi Changshou nodded decisively. \u201cDeal.\u201dJiu Jiu felt a little embarrassed, as if she had extorted her Disciple-Nephew.She had originally wanted to order some wine. She kept her hands behind her back and leaned against the stone wall, appearing slightly dazed.Li Changshou glanced at her and continued reading.\u201cI\u2019ll probably stay here for another month. Aunt-Master, you cultivate first. Wait for me for a while.\u201dJiu Jiu blinked and said softly, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll wait here then. One month\u2026 be over soon.\u201dLi Changshou suddenly recalled that his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu had gone to the Middle Continent to participate in the preparation for the Three Sects Assembly and had yet to return.If Aunt-Master had just broken through, she might not have any wine to drink.He took out another treasure pouch and handed it to Jiu Jiu. \u201cThis is your salary, I\u2019m giving it to you in advance. However, for now, I only have Beauty Brew.\u201dJiu Jiu scratched her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\u201cForget it then\u2026\u201dLi Changshou retracted his hand, but Jiu Jiu snatched the bag away.\u201cYou\u2019ve already taken it out! How can you take it back!?! Hmph, I\u2019ll accept it graciously!\u201d\u201cHmph, I\u2019ll accept it generously!\u201dLi Changshou smiled and continued to memorize the restrictions with his head hung low.Jiu Jiu yawned from the side and found a jade token, on which there were some spells. She read it slowly while she was beside Li Changshou and tossed two Spirit Wine Pills into her mouth.Li Changshou said, \u201cEat less. This thing will make you drunk.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 but they\u2019re really delicious!\u201dNot long after, Li Changshou heard faint snoring coming from the side\u2026Li Changshou sighed. He had a feeling that his Aunt-Master\u2019s personality only matched a fraction of her age.That was good.Li Changshou actually had other pills that were similar to the Spirit Wine Pill. However, he had to take them out slowly. It would not be nice if he gave them all to her at once.He focused his mind and continued to memorize.As a disciple who was at the Seventh Stage of Void Return, it would not be appropriate for him to enter the Dao Repository Hall all the time. It would be best if he could remember everything he needed.From now\u2026 I\u2019m an emotionless broken record.\u2026In the forbidden areas of the mountains in the north-east of the Middle Continent, there was an immortal island that hovered above the mountains.There were countless buildings and palaces on it. White clouds surrounded the island, and immortal sounds could be heard. Layers of array formations surrounded the island.This is what a great sect is like!It was the Golden Palace Sect which was founded by the Qi Refinement cultivator Chi Jingzi who was from the Chan School.Chi Jingzi cultivated in a Grotto-heaven blessed land\u2014the Heavenly Cloud Cave of Taihua Mountain. He had also once gone to the Golden Palace Sect.He was one of the top ten Immortal Sects of the Chan School, who was competent and strong\u2026The Golden Palace Sect was one of the organizers of the Sect Meeting between the three sect leaders.It was meant to ease tension and increase harmony.The Three Pure Ones were originally one. After the Great God Pangu split the heavens and earth and died, his Essence Soul transformed into the Grand Pure One, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning and the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasures. They were called the Three Friends and the reason that the Dao Sect\u2019s Three Pures were formed.The three of them were originally staying in the small courtyard on Kunlun Mountain. After that, they became Hong Jun\u2019s three personal disciples and changed the Xuan Sect to the Dao Sect. Hong Jun was made the Dao Ancestor.However, due to the different ideals of accepting and teaching disciples, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning and the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure were gradually at odds.After that, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning reprimanded the eldest disciple of the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasures, Duobao. In a moment of pique, the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasures moved to the South Ocean.When the Three Pure Ones became Saints, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning established his teachings. His intention was to \u2018advert the Great Dao and teach all living beings\u2019. He advocated that the laws were not easily passed down. The disciples needed virtue, good fortune, and good luck.The Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure had set up Jie School and was known as the Grandmaster of Heaven. His intention was to help all living beings obtain a chance of survival. He advocated impartial teaching. As long as a disciple was pleasing to his eye\u2026 that would do.\u201cI have established the Ren School and hid in the Nine Heavens. I have comprehended the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth, and I have advocated peace and tranquility. I have only accepted one disciple, the Great Daoist Master Xuandu.\u201dThe difference between the reason they accepted disciples was the source of the conflict between the two factions.However, the Three Pure Ones had deep ties with each other. The three sects originated from the same source. Jie School and Chan School were basically all related to Dao.Therefore, the Great Immortal Sect took the initiative to step forward and prepare for the Three Sects Origin Flow Conference. They wanted the Three Sects to reconcile.The people who came to discuss about the organization of the grand meeting, such as the Jie School and Chan School, were all the \u201cpowerful families\u201d of the Primordial World.There were only five to six people from the Ren School, so the Immortal Du Sect had been recruited to fill the vacancies\u2026However, more than a year had passed since the preparations for the meet began\u2026They still did not reach the main topic.Jiu Wu and the other two executives of the Immortal Du Sect followed behind the two elders. They would greet them, bow to them, and stroll around to meet up with their friends or attend Dao lectures every day.It was the segment of the Dao discussion that would occur before the \u2018Preparation Conference\u2019 began. It would probably last for three to five years.It was truly wise to begin preparations for the conference a hundred years in advance\u2026That night, Jiu Wu got drunk and was sent back to his residence by two Golden Palace Sect disciples.While in a daze, Jiu Wu seemed to have heard the sound of a mosquito\u2026Why are there mosquitoes here?He clapped his hands in the air casually and the sound of the mosquitoes disappeared.However, not far from the pavilion where the Immortal Du Sect was one of the buildings where the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island lived.A ray of sanguine light left the vicinity of Jiu Wu. It silently broke through the array formation at the outer perimeter of the pavilion and found an old Daoist priest who was meditating there\u2026Yuan Ze was in Golden Ao Island.Buzz\u2014\u201cEh?\u201dYuan Ze turned his head and looked around. He was a little suspicious. He was about to use his immortal senses to scan his surroundings when he felt some pain in his neck.In an instant, the Old Daoist Yuan Ze\u2019s body trembled. He lowered his head and remained seated, as if he was continuing to cultivate\u2026A streak of sanguine light quietly seeped into the old Daoist Yuan Ze\u2019s essence soul, staining his soul and consciousness.A moment later, the old Daoist priest Yuan Ze exhaled softly. His listless eyes gradually regained their luster as he said softly, \u201cMaster, rest assured!\u201d\u201cI swear on my life that I will succeed!\u201d5,000 kilometers away, in a desolate forest.Daoist Wen Jing sat cross-legged on a huge rock quietly. A charming smile appeared on her seductive face.It\u2019s too easy to plot against these Heaven Immortals.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The base of the array should face south, and six feet and three inches underground.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2026 ah\u2026 hey!\u201dThree months after Jiu Jiu came out of seclusion, three figures were getting busy outside the Pill Chamber on the Little Qiong Peak.Li Changshou commanded, and Ling\u2019e supported him.Jiu Jiu, on the other hand, was multitasking. She was in charge of suppressing the spiritual energy in the array formation, controlling the fluctuations of the array formations in various places, checking the positions of the bases of the array formations, and covering the refined ones with immortal power. She then slowly buried them underground\u2026Nothing should go wrong during this process.After setting down the foundation of the array formation, Jiu Jiu let out a long breath and leaned against the tree trunk while panting heavily\u2026\u201cHow many more?\u201dLi Changshou took a look at his treasure pouch. There were still about one-third of array formations left, which amounted to about sixty.However\u2026He only wanted Jiu Jiu to help him in name and wanted for her to remember the experience deeply. He did not actually need her to set up all the array foundations\u2026In reality, most of the array foundations he had set up this time had to be slightly adjusted later.Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cThere are only three left. Thank you, Aunt-Master.\u201dWhen she heard that there were only three more to go, Jiu Jiu\u2019s eyes were filled with relief like she had just survived a calamity.\u201cFinally, it\u2019s been a few months. I\u2019m almost done.\u201dStanding at the side, Ling\u2019e could tell from Li Changshou\u2019s expression that he was deep in thought.Senior Brother can already set up the array without Little Aunt-Master\u2019s help?Jiu Jiu took out a Spirit Wine Pill. With a few cracking sounds, she became energetic again!\u201cSettle them in one go!\u201dJiu Jiu jumped up and rushed to the next place where the array formation had to be buried.Ling\u2019e straightened her hair and chuckled. She picked up her bamboo basket and quickly followed.\u201cLittle Aunt-Master, have some fruits and get some rest.\u201d\u201cLittle Ling\u2019e is so considerate, unlike your senior who does nothing but order me around and make me do work for him!\u201d\u201cSenior is just sparing a thought for the safety of Little Qiong Peak. Thank you, Little Aunt-Master. Let me massage your shoulders\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, to the left\u2026 We both have hard lives.\u201dAs they laughed, Ling\u2019e and Jiu Jiu walked away from the forest.Li Changshou slowly followed them. He pondered about activating the array formation and perfecting the theory of the Chain Array.They worked for another half a day.At sunset, the remaining three array foundations were finally settled.Jiu Jiu acted like she was a completely different person. She was in high spirits. She pulled Ling\u2019e along and called Li Changshou to go to the straw hut to have a game of \u2018Battle The Almighty!\u2019Li Changshou sighed softly in his heart. The array formation had to be fine-tuned in detail for quite some time, so he was not in a hurry.When he walked out of the forest, Li Changshou suddenly had a sudden urge.This is\u2026Li Changshou looked at his Aunt-Master and junior who were jumping around in front of him. He retracted his right hand into his sleeve and immediately pinched his fingers to calculate. Very quickly, he understood something.The pill in the porcelain bottle that he had given Jiu Wu had been taken out!The porcelain bottle was naturally not an ordinary porcelain bottle. It was a Dharma artifact that could store immortal pills and preserve medicinal properties.Li Changshou had tampered with it by adding two restrictions, and put a wisp of his spiritual senses into it.As long as the pills inside were taken out, he would detect something!What is going on\u2026Did Uncle-Master Jiu Wu use the \u2018Corrosive Immortal Soul-Converging Pill\u2019 because he\u2019s in danger?Or could Uncle-Master Jiu Wu have taken out the pill to show it to others?Of course, he could not rule out the possibility that the bottle had shattered on its own\u2026Although Uncle-Master Jiu Wu is sometimes unreliable, he had always been cautious when he was outside.Otherwise, the sect would not have given him the important task of preparing and organizing the Three Sects Assembly, because he would have to be careful and not offend others\u2026There is most likely to be something wrong with Uncle-Master Jiu Wu.The Middle Continent is too far away from this place. I can\u2019t do anything immediately either.Li Changshou immediately had an idea\u2026He shouted, \u201cAunt-Master Jiu!\u201d\u201cEh? What\u2019s wrong? Come over and have fun! Hehehehe!\u201dLi Changshou coughed and spoke to Jiu Jiu seriously.After hearing his words, Jiu Jiu and Ling\u2019e\u2019s expressions changed.Weird\u2026Jiu Jiu asked in disbelief, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Changshou nodded solemnly.\u201cWell.\u201d Jiu Jiu could not help but blink. She raised her hand and pinched her thin earlobe. \u201cYou dreamed that my Fifth Senior Brother was in danger yesterday? He was being chased by seven or eight burly, bear-like people?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Li Changshou said with a serious expression. \u201cAfter thinking about it today, I can\u2019t stop feeling worried. As a Qi Refinement cultivator, my senses should be telling me something.\u201dJiu Jiu frowned and whispered, \u201cBut you\u2026\u201d\u201cIf Fifth Senior Brother is in trouble, the person dreaming of him should be my Fourth Senior Sister. Or, it could also be me. If I dream of him\u2026 that\u2019d be reasonable. After all, Fifth Senior Brother had always treated me like he was my brother and father\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026 did you dream of Senior Brother? What\u2019s going on!?!\u201d\u201cUncle-Master Jiu Wu and I are also considered good friends and close confidantes.\u201d Li Changshou smiled bitterly. \u201cLet\u2019s not dwell on the details.\u201cThere should be a way to contact Uncle-Master Jiu Wu. Aunt-Master, are you willing to believe me for once?\u201d\u201cOf course I believe you.\u201dJiu Jiu said seriously, \u201cOtherwise, we wouldn\u2019t take everything that you give us.\u201dLing\u2019e turned her head to the side. She knew that Li Changshou was talking about serious matters, and hence she held back her laughter.\u201cAunt-Master, please take this matter seriously,\u201d Li Changshou said. \u201cI rarely dream. There are a few instances that have been very accurate.\u201dJiu Jiu hesitated a little and said softly, \u201cBut we\u2019re going to disturb Fourth Senior Sister\u2019s seclusion just because of your dream\u2026 Okay, I\u2019ll try waking her up.\u201dLi Changshou added, \u201cPlease tell her that it was what you saw in your dream.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you afraid of being scolded?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of being scolded. I\u2019m just afraid of being misunderstood\u2026 Besides, I really don\u2019t want to attract any attention from the sect.\u201dJiu Jiu scoffed and chided, \u201cYou\u2019re making it sound as if everyone wants to stare at you! I\u2019ll go and call for Fourth Senior Sister now. Wait for me here!\u201d\u201cWhen I come back, we\u2019ll continue playing \u2018Fighting The God\u2019!\u201dLi Changshou and Ling\u2019e agreed at the same time. Jiu Jiu yawned and flew away with the huge gourd.Just as Jiu Jiu left, Ling\u2019e walked over with her hands behind her back. She knocked her slender shoulders lightly against Li Changshou.\u201cSenior Brother, are you serious?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cYour dream about Uncle-Master Jiu Wu being chased by a few burly men.\u201d\u201cOf course the dream wasn\u2019t real.\u201dLi Changshou stood with his hands behind his back. There was a hint of helplessness in his eyes as he said, \u201cHowever, it might be real that he\u2019s in trouble.\u201d\u201cGo back and pack your luggage. Bring all your useful items with you.\u201dLing\u2019e was stunned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Senior Brother?\u201d\u201cJust in case.\u201d Li Changshou\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and there was a glint in his eyes. \u201cEverything has to be prepared in advance.\u201dLan Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and blinked. She lowered her head and expressed assent before rushing to her straw hut.\u2026The message that Li Changshou revealed caused a huge commotion in the Immortal Du Sect.Jiu Jiu returned to the Heaven-Breaking Peak and told Jiu Shi about how Jiu Wu had been chased by a group of strong men.Even though Jiu Shi had been disturbed during her Dao Enlightenment, she was not unhappy. In front of Jiu Jiu, she took out the \u2018Ten Thousand Miles String\u2019 messenger talisman that she had refined with Jiu Wu\u2026Then\u2026There was no reply.Jiu Shi was first stunned, after which she took out a mirror which was a treasure.It was called the Heartfelt Treasure Mirror. It contained some blood from Jiu Wu\u2019s heart. She could use it to see what Jiu Wu was looking at, just by activating it.It was an excellent item that was mandatory for checking on one\u2019s Dao companion and being on guard against anyone who might try to come in between their relationship.However, the mirror did not respond to Jiu Shi\u2019s repeated urgings.At this moment, Jiu Shi was starting to panic. She quickly pulled Jiu Jiu to seek help from her Master\u2026In less than an hour, the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2019s bell was ringing at an anxious pace!A powerful pressure suddenly appeared on the Heaven-Splitting Peak. A figure shrouded in green light rushed out of the mountain-protecting array formation and darted towards the west!After a while, four figures rushed out of the mountain-protecting array formation and stood facing all directions.Among those four people, one of them was Exalted Wang Qing, whom Li Changshou was more familiar with.At the same time, wisps of Heaven Immortal aura appeared on the various peaks. The elders in the sect were alarmed\u2026The person who had soared into the sky and flew towards the Middle Continent was the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s\u2026Sect Leader.Li Changshou stood in front of the straw hut and carefully tried to detect something for a while. He managed to sense the mysterious Dao runes that were unique to the Golden Immortal realm.There was indeed a Golden Immortal in the Immortal Du Sect!Golden Immortals had immortality and their own Dao had already been acknowledged by the Heavenly Dao. If there was no calamity, they could live forever with their Dao.However, the Golden Immortal realm was an extremely blurry realm. There were obvious differences between Golden Immortals and their abilities varied. They could sometimes be worlds apart.The Dao Realm was only the foundation that was akin to a ticket to becoming an expert.Mystical abilities and treasures were the main factors that determined the strength of a Golden Immortal realm.The Sect Leader who was also a Golden Immortal realm was far from being comparable to the famous twelve Golden Immortals of Chan School.Moreover, the twelve Golden Immortals of the Chan School had made their \u201cgrand debut on the Primordial stage\u201d 129,600 years ago. At that time, they were only collectively known as the twelve Golden Immortals.For people like Guang Chengzi and Chi Jingzi, who had entered Saint\u2019s tutelage earlier, they should have long reached the realm of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals.The Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals were considered Golden Immortals that had the intent to achieve perfection in their own Dao. If they could not overcome a small tribulation, they would not be able to escape a great calamity.Most of the eight outer sect disciples and seven Immortal attendants of the Jie School should be in the Zenith Realm.As those thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Changshou began to miss his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2026Jiu Wu was only an Immortal. In the Primordial World, he could not even qualify to be cannon fodder.If anything were to happen, and he got into a terrible mishap, it would not come as a surprise\u2026That was how dangerous the Primordial world was.\u201cSenior Brother, is Uncle-Master Jiu Wu really in trouble?\u201d Ling\u2019e asked worriedly.\u201cYes.\u201d Li Changshou said calmly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. If this matter concerns the Three Sects, the Ren School will send experts to protect the Immortal Sect\u2026\u201dJust as he finished speaking, Jiu Jiu hurried over from the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Jiu Jiu had yet to land on the ground but she hurriedly yelled at Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e who were standing in front of the straw hut.\u201cChangshou, Ling\u2019e! Something happened!\u201dLi Changshou frowned and quickly asked, \u201cWhat happened? Aunt-Master, speak slowly.\u201dHow could Jiu Jiu slow down?She said anxiously, \u201cI can\u2019t contact Fifth Senior Brother\u2019s messenger talisman for now. Only one of the other two elders and two executives\u2019 messenger talismans are connected! However, they heard the sounds of a battle!\u201d\u201cThis matter has already alarmed the Sect Leader and several Grand Elders. The Sect Leader has already come out of seclusion and headed to the Middle Continent. We have already contacted the Golden Palace Sect. The Golden Palace Sect has also agreed to send a large number of experts to search\u2026\u201dLi Changshou hurriedly said, \u201cIn that case, there\u2019s no need to be anxious.\u201cAunt-Master, go inside and rest. We\u2019re too far away. We can\u2019t help much.\u201d\u201cHow can I not be anxious? I\u2019m dying of anxiety.\u201dJiu Jiu stomped her feet and paced around a few times. She then looked at Li Changshou with an apologetic look in her eyes and said softly, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be rushing you, actually. Thank you, Changshou. If you had not dreamed about it, things would have probably gotten worse.\u201dLi Changshou sighed and said, \u201cUncle-Master Jiu Wu and I have a strong relationship. You don\u2019t have to thank me for this matter. However, Aunt-Master, you have to remember to say that you were the one who dreamed of it.\u201d\u201cYes, I know\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu looked at Li Changshou and mumbled, \u201cActually, there\u2019s something I want to trouble you with.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201dJiu Jiu frowned and asked, \u201cCan you sleep again? Let\u2019s see if you can dream of what\u2019s going on there.\u201d\u201cI know that this is a little difficult for you. Dreams depend on your feelings and luck\u2026 but\u2026\u201dLi Changshou immediately nodded and agreed, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll try to dream of it.\u201d\u201cLing\u2019e, accompany Aunt-Master. Don\u2019t let her get too anxious.\u201d\u201cThank you, Little Shoushou\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu said in a low voice. Her expression was somewhat haggard due to her anxiety.Li Changshou responded, lowered his head, and walked towards his straw hut. Ling\u2019e held Jiu Jiu\u2019s arm and comforted her softly.Of course, Li Changshou could not dream of anything. He only went back to his room and lay down on his bed. He calmly analyzed the troubles that the Immortal Du Sect might encounter, as well as the possible ways that the matter would escalate in the future.To Li Changshou, being worried was the most useless emotion.He felt that it was worse than being angry and infuriated out of helplessness.This time, Li Changshou did not expect that he had secretly saved Jiu Wu and the two elders in the sect\u2026After realizing that the poison pill had been used, Li Changshou quickly informed Jiu Jiu.Jiu Jiu and Jiu Shi sensed that something might happen to Jiu Wu and immediately informed the sect.The disciples in the sect had all lost contact with Jiu Wu and reported the matter to the Sect Leader\u2026The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect came out of seclusion and quickly rushed to the Middle Continent. The Grand Elder also contacted a familiar fellow Daoist from the Golden Palace Sect\u2026The experts from the Golden Palace Sect had only gone out for a short while when they found a large array that concealed their surroundings a thousand miles away from the Golden Palace Sect. They then found the members of the Immortal Du Sect who had been surrounded.The few experts rushed forward and captured the people surrounding them and deliberately left some alive. However, the moment those people were captured, their essence soul strangely withered\u2026The people from the Immortal Du Sect did not know the reason for the appearance of the group of five people. Two Heaven Immortal realm elders were injured. Jiu Wu was also seriously injured. The other two Perfected Immortal realm executives\u2026 died.All three sects were enraged!It did not matter who died. What was important was that they were getting insulted!The experts from Ren School immediately stood up and protected Jiu Wu and the others. They swore to investigate the incident of the Immortal Sect being attacked\u2026When Li Changshou received the news from Jiu Jiu, Jiu Wu and the two elders were already escorted back to the Immortal Du Sect by the Sect Master and other experts.They had yet to find out who the culprit was.Li Changshou stood in front of the door of the Pill Chamber and heaved a sigh of relief\u2026He did not expect those little items that he had created when he occasionally got strange ideas, to really be useful at crucial moments. He decided to make more of them in the future.Also\u2026The Earth Meridians Escape Array below the Little Qiong Peak, as well as the safety room, should be put on the agenda as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cChangshou! If not for the poisonous pill that was made by Elder Wan Linyun, which you had given me, I would have really died!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dThey were in Jiu Wu\u2019s pavilion in the Nine Jiu Immortals\u2019 residence on the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Two and a half months had passed since he returned safely from the expedition to the Immortal Du Sect.Li Changshou waited for Jiu Wu\u2019s injuries to heal and the sect members to stop running fevers before bringing Ling\u2019e along to visit their Uncle-Master Jiu Wu.His master had been cultivating in seclusion and hence was not disturbed by that matter.In the past two and a half months, Li Changshou toiled day and night to make the array formations outside and inside Little Qiong Peak reach the maximum performance levels that he could achieve at the moment. He also used up all the treasures he had accumulated previously!However, he felt a little more at ease staying there.Just as he was led into Jiu Wu\u2019s pavilion by Jiu Jiu, Li Changshou heard Jiu Wu sighing with emotion while sitting cross-legged on the bed.Li Changshou bowed to Jiu Wu with a serious expression.Ling\u2019e put aside the tonic wine she was carrying and was dragged into the room at the side by Jiu Jiu.Li Changshou had brewed that tonic especially for Jiu Wu. It could nourish one\u2019s Primordial Energy, reduce losses, stabilize one\u2019s essence, and strengthen one\u2019s bones.Li Changshou sighed and walked to the side of the bed.As Li Changshou had repeatedly reminded Jiu Jiu, Jiu Jiu did not expose the fact that it was actually Li Changshou\u2019s dream.Even so, Jiu Wu was extremely grateful to Li Changshou because that poisonous pill had saved his life at the crucial moment.\u201cUncle-Master, how are your injuries?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Jiu Wu heaved a sigh of relief and said, \u201cHowever, two of my fellow disciples had met with a calamity. Their souls are scattered in the Middle Continent and they cannot return.\u201dLi Changshou nodded and could only sigh while lamenting that the world was unpredictable.After a while, Li Changshou cut straight to the chase\u2026\u201cUncle-Master, how\u2019s the investigation going?\u201d\u201cI have some clues, but it\u2019s as good as nothing.\u201d There was a hint of helplessness in Jiu Wu\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026 This matter might have something to do with a senior disciple of Chan School.\u201d\u201cSome people are not willing to let the meeting between the three sects happen successfully. It seems that they are hatching a scheme in secret.\u201dLi Changshou thought to himself\u2026This is definitely not that simple.However, he did not say anything else and only sighed. \u201cThis matter is really serious.\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d Jiu Wu shook his head and sighed. \u201cChangshou, tell me about your poisonous pill\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle-Master, do you want two more for self-defense?\u201dJiu Wu said firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I can use immortal treasures, immortal pills or anything you want to exchange for them!\u201dHowever, Li Changshou shook his head slowly. With a serious expression, he said, \u201cThe poisonous pill that I gave you previously was actually given to me by Elder Wan Linyun. He wanted me to use them to figure out how to refine pills.\u201d\u201cUncle-Master, why don\u2019t you go and look for Elder Wan Linyun\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle-Master, I will pass the message to you via voice transmission.\u201dHe mumbled.Jiu Wu quickly nodded and agreed while pondering.Although Elder Wan Linyun is indeed infamous, his poisonous pills are superb. I learned how powerful they were only after using them once\u2026Sometimes, poisonous pills can save lives as well as life-saving immortal pills can.Jiu Wu said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll bring Jiu Shi along to see Elder Wan Linyun later.\u201dLi Changshou nodded slightly before recalling that Elder Wan Linyun had created his mystical abilities.I shall go visit Elder later and ask him to impart me with the mystical abilities to create poison.Li Changshou asked Jiu Wu about many details regarding the attack suffered by the Golden Palace Sect previously in a concerned manner.Jiu Wu told him everything that he knew.When Li Changshou asked why the five of them were going out secretly, Jiu Wu said, \u201cI\u2019ve only told the Sect Leader and the elders about this. The sect has also ordered us not to inform any outsiders about this. If it were not for you, I would not have said anything.\u201d\u201cIt was a senior\u2026 Ah, I mean, an executive of the sect claimed that an expert from Ren School wanted to see the members of the Immortal Du Sect in secret. He told us some things about the meeting between the three sects and lured the four of us into an ambush.\u201d\u201cAmong those who ambushed us, there were three Heaven Immortals and sixteen Perfected Immortals. Before the battle started, the executive\u2019s body collapsed instantly\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen we looked back, we saw that his essence soul had also declined, just like those people who were attacking us. The power of his essence soul and souls were also sucked out of him. I can only vaguely deduce from the identity of the person who ambushed me, that he seemed to be an immortal from the Chan School.\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but there was a hint of fear on his face. He sighed with Jiu Wu again.The two of them mumbled to each other for a long time, causing a few wisps of spiritual senses and immortal senses to detect them.Soon, Li Changshou asked the last question.\u201cUncle-Master Jiu Wu, I found a jade slip in the Dao Repository Hall. It seems to mention something about\u2026 some underground earth meridians containing a Teleportation Array that would allow one to escape during danger\u2026\u201dJiu Wu smiled bitterly and said to Li Changshou, \u201cIndeed. The elders, Peak Leaders, and executives of the older generation all know about it. However, they did not tell anyone about it.\u201d\u201cAfter the calamity of the demons\u2019 sneak attack, which happened ten thousand years ago, the Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect also felt that he had to hold back. Therefore, he created a solution to escape for the disciples who were not competent enough.\u201d\u201cThat earth meridian leads to the East Ocean. If a powerful enemy attacks, the disciples of the sect can head underground in the Hundred Mortal Hall and use the teleportation array to leave, so as to avoid being attacked. However, there is a way down only in the Hundred Mortal Hall.Li Changshou was enlightened, but he smiled to himself and thought\u2026Now, I can officially announce that there are two paths that were connected to the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array!He had never seen a jade slip that was related to the escape route in the underground earth meridian.He had purely dug it out!Half a month ago, Li Changshou, who was preparing to create an escape route on Little Qiong Peak, dug through the earth meridian below the Little Qiong Peak and almost destroyed the array.The so-called Earth Meridian Teleportation Array was not complicated. Although it had the word \u2018teleportation\u2019, it was not an array for a great shift. It simply used the power of the Earth meridian to allow one to directly move through the Earth meridian and instantly appear thousands of kilometers away.The sect\u2019s arrangement had really saved Li Changshou a lot of effort.However, in order to be safe, Li Changshou had left a small Earth Vein Teleportation Array in a more remote location. It was in the opposite direction from the sect\u2019s Greater Teleportation Array.He had spent the last portion of precious materials he had on that.Jiu Wu instructed, \u201cThis matter cannot be spread to the outside world. It will easily make the disciples panic.\u201dLi Changshou nodded and agreed. He changed the topic and started talking about recuperation\u2026An hour later\u2026Jiu Shi carried a bowl of soup and a bottle of pills while entering from the side.She said gently, \u201cWu Wu, it\u2019s time to take your medicine.\u201dLi Changshou looked at the scene taking place before him and found that it resembled a famous painting from his previous life, which was named \u201cDa Lang, It\u2019s Time For Medicine\u201d. He got up and bade his Uncle-Master and Aunt-Master farewell.Ling\u2019e floated out from the house and bowed to Jiu Wu and Jiu Shi.Jiu Jiu had originally wanted to go to the Little Qiong Peak with them. However, she thought that she could not be too heartless, and hence accompanied Jiu Shi to send Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e out. She waved goodbye to the two of them and continued to stay by her Fifth Senior Brother, Jiu Wu\u2019s side\u2026Even though she wanted to play, it was not an appropriate time to do so.Li Changshou brought Ling\u2019e to the Hundred Mortal Hall where they paid respects to the portrait of the Grand Pure One together before returning to the Little Qiong Peak\u2026On the cloud path, Ling\u2019e noticed Li Changshou\u2019s gloomy expression and asked softly, \u201cSenior Brother, is the problem serious?\u201d\u201cThe information I know is too little. I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d Li Changshou sent a voice transmission to her. He continued, \u201cI\u2019ll go into seclusion in the Pill Chamber for a few days to think about this matter. If anything goes wrong in the sect, immediately crush the messenger talisman I gave you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of wasting it. I can still refine and produce more.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dLing\u2019e nodded wittily and watched Li Changshou leave the Pill Chamber. She stood on the cloud and sighed softly.Although she wanted to be like Li Changshou and make herself nervous\u2026He took a look at the various places in the sect, where clouds were curling up. He saw the immortal crane Cheng Xiang which was still as peaceful as before\u2026Senior Brother, are you\u2026 too sensitive?Ling\u2019e sighed softly and rode her cloud towards her straw hut.The array formation around the Pill Chamber was activated. At that moment, there was no more spiritual energy in the forest. It was rather calm.However, if someone with sharp spiritual senses were to stand outside the forest and look inside, their hair would stand on ends\u2026\u2026After entering the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou casually dropped a paper effigy and turned into green smoke as he returned to the underground secret chamber.He took out a stack of blank canvases and spread them out one by one on the ground. He then took off his shoes and walked on them.It was not because he needed a special \u201cposition\u201d to calm down and think\u2026An hour later, Li Changshou took out a charcoal pen that he made and sat down cross-legged. He wrote a line on the leftmost side of the painting.\u201cIf I\u2019m a schemer\u2026\u201dThen, he drew two arrowheads. One of them was straight, and he continued to write \u201cThe attack had nothing to do with the Dao discussion between the cultivators from Golden Ao Island.\u201dThe other arrowhead pointed to a large area of blank space below. He wrote \u201cIt\u2019s related to the Dao Discussion between the Golden Immortals\u201dAfter pondering for a while, he drew some arrows from each of the two articles. He listed out all the possible ways that the matter could escalate in and analyzed them one by one\u2026This time, I can\u2019t let any of the possibilities go, no matter how small it may be!\u201cThere is not much information that we know of now.\u201dHe only knew that the people from the Immortal Du Sect were very resourceful. They had the ability to control the mystical abilities of the Heaven Immortals and Perfected Immortals, and could instantly kill the puppets.There should be a few possible motives.They might have a feud with the Immortal Du Sect and are after the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s assets\u2026However, Li Changshou highlighted the most likely motive\u2014 Disrupting the meet and sowing discord between the three sects.He analyzed the source, verified the results, and did not let go of any links.Li Changshou lowered his head to write and draw. His immortal senses enveloped the entire Little Qiong Peak, and the charcoal pen in his hand became shorter and shorter.Three days later.Li Changshou heaved a long sigh of relief. He sat behind the study table in the secret underground chamber. In front of him was a \u2018black screen\u2019 that he had conjured with his immortal powers.On it were densely packed words, symbols, arrowheads, and sketches.There were dozens of possible \u201cstorylines\u201d and hundreds of possible scenarios\u2026Even if the culprit was unknown, he would be able to find the corresponding \u201cstorylines\u201d as long as the other party took the next step!Li Changshou was not looking for the culprit because he found it to be meaningless.It was because the other party was probably someone whom he could not come into contact with at the moment. Otherwise, he would die.Li Changshou only wanted to be able to react quickly when he detected the other party making a move. He wanted to make the right decision\u2026If he exposed his cultivation level, it would only increase the combat power of the sect by the level of an elder. It would not be of much use.There were enough elders on the peaks.It would be impossible for him to obtain the authority to speak in the Immortal Du Sect within a short period of time.Therefore, he might as well hide his cultivation trump card and secretly protect himself and the sect.Moreover, the actual effect was that it would be more useful for him to hide.Li Changshou took out three wooden tablets and a carving knife. He lowered his head and started playing with it.He used a potion that would disappear after someone looked at it, as ink. He wrote down three plans and placed one in each of the three brocade pouches.The first plan was to cry.He had already planted a trump card in his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2019s place. Jiu Wu would look for Elder Wan Linyun later.The brocade pouch would then be handed over to Jiu Wu by Elder Wan Linyun. He also strictly ordered Jiu Wu to stay in the sect for the time being. If the sect were to be attacked and the mountain-protecting array formation was broken, he had to ensure that Jiu Wu would open the brocade pouch.He had to actually cry and not just do so perfunctorily.Li Changshou wrote on the wooden sign:\u201cI went to the Hundred Mortal Hall to look for the Ancestral Master\u2019s portrait. I cried from the bottom of my heart. It is said that the Grand Pure One of the Immortal Du Sect is ingenious, and was originally not in any conflict with the world, but he was used by someone else. They want to destroy the Ren School, which is part of the Immortal Du Sect, so as to sow discord among the three sects. I hereby seek the Ancestral Master\u2019s help\u2026\u201dHe decided to give the second brocade pouch to Jiu Jiu. However, he could not give it to her directly and could only do so after something major happened.The third brocade pouch was for his master. He stated in a message on the wooden tablet that he needed his master\u2019s help to cover him. In fact, he wanted his master to escort Ling\u2019e away.If a sect war were to break out, his master would definitely be in charge. He had to deal with it in advance.Li Changshou did not need anyone to protect him. After discovering the various signs, his main body would definitely be in a safe place\u2026After sealing the brocade pouch, Li Changshou shouted,\u201dPrepare for battle!\u201dUh, he seemed to be the only person in the entire army.He casually brushed past the table, and two rows of paper effigies jumped out of his sleeve. They bowed at Li Changshou in unison.Li Changshou smiled and did it again.\u201d Prepare for battle!\u201dThe little paper effigies waved their hands with murderous intent.I\u2019m not going to joke anymore.There are three things that I need to do the most now.I have to quickly expand the \u2018Poison-inducing Dharmic Artifact Vault\u2019 and infinitely increase the amount of poisonous powder.Strengthening the paper effigy would allow me to split my attention. I cannot devote all my attention to the paper effigies.I must obtain Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s deep trust. He is a powerful force that is no weaker than a Golden Immortal!Li Changshou stood up and looked at the black screen in front of him. At the center of the screen, he saw the words \u201cPrime culprit\u201d written on it. His eyes glistened.I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re from the west or from the north. I don\u2019t care if you have a feud with the Immortal Du Sect, or with the Ren School and Chan School. Even if you don\u2019t want the three sects to get along well\u2026As long as you dare to take action!Hmph!I\u2019ll dare to run\u2026\u2026Half a year later, in the Golden Palace Sect in the Middle Continent.Three figures flew out of Immortal Island. They were the three Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island. They had agreed to return to Golden Ao Island, as they were getting tired of staying there.Those three people happened to be the ones who went to the Immortal Du Sect the other day.The other two heard Old Daoist Yuan Ze\u2019s complaints and felt the same way. They decided to return to Golden Ao Island to cultivate.It would be better to go back and live a carefree life instead of staying here and wasting time!The white clouds flew for a thousand kilometers, and the old Daoist Yuan Ze stood at the back. His eyes were bloodshot. He took two steps forward and suddenly said, \u201cFellow Daoists\u2026\u201dThe two of them turned around to look. Suddenly, they heard the buzzing of a mosquito. Before they could react, they felt a sharp pain at the back of their necks and were about to fall over.The old Daoist priest Yuan Ze held the two middle-aged men and continued to drive towards the southeast as if nothing had happened.Another half a month later.The old Daoist priest Yuan Ze rode the white cloud and stopped at a dense forest in the Demon Clan\u2019s territory at the border between the Middle Continent and the East Continent.As if they had agreed beforehand, black shadows gathered from all over the forest. They surrounded the three of them and knelt down.The group of figures consisted of demons, humans, and spirits. They were wrapped in black robes and were using all their strength to conceal their auras.The only thing they had in common was that there were some invisible and healed wounds on their necks.A demon carried three trays and knelt in front of the three of them. The tray glistened with blood, and there were three blood-colored lotus flowers the size of fists, each of which had seven petals.At that moment, only Yuan Ze and the other two could see a blood-colored figure flickering and floating around them\u2026Her face was blurry, and her figure was outrageously enchanting.She whispered something into their ears and her gentle voice seemed to have entered their hearts.\u201cTake it\u2026 consume it\u2026 This is the immortality that you\u2019ve always wanted\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Three Sects\u2019 Meet is meant to suppress the entire sect. You have a way to stop it now\u2026 Only you can stop it\u2026 Quickly destroy the Immortal Du Sect, the Immortal Du Sect\u2026\u201dThe three Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island, led by the old Daoist Yuan Ze, each held a Seven-Petal Blood Lotus and said in unison, \u201cYes, Lord!\u201d\u201cWe will not fail this time!\u201dTens of thousands of kilometers away, in a certain canyon, Daoist Wen Jing, who was sitting cross-legged on a jade-colored cushion, sneered.She did not bother about it. She turned around and flew towards the west.She controlled the Qi Refinement cultivators of the sect and arranged for the puppets to attack the five immortals of the Golden Palace Sect in order to attract everyone\u2019s attention.Then, she would have the Qi Refinement cultivators of the Jie School pretend to be working together with the demons to destroy the tiny Immortal Du Sect\u2026Her plan would then succeed.To her, it was just a small scheme. The three Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island were her facade.As long as that happened, the discord between the three sects would continue to worsen regardless of the outcome.It was both a shady yet open scheme.As for her\u2026How could she continue to show her face? If she accidentally provoked her senior from Ren School, she would not have the confidence to escape.Let\u2019s get out of this mess and return to the Western Sect to watch a good show from afar. That\u2019d be the wisest move.If I discover that the three of them have succeeded or failed, I\u2019ll just turn them into ashes, leaving behind clues that point to Ren School and Chan School. Then, everything would be over.If I succeed, what would those bastardly Deputy sect masters reward me with?Hmph, what are they going to use to show me respect!?!These cowards, if not for the protection you enjoy from the two old masters\u2026I will suck you all dry sooner or later!Daoist Wen Jing sneered and disappeared. Only the sound of a mosquito could be heard as she walked away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the mountain at the back of Little Qiong Peak.Standing beside a few withered old trees, Li Changshou frowned and sighed. He raised his hand and patted the trunk of one of them.\u201cThank you.\u201dA gust of wind blew over, and a few of the old trees\u2019 branches, which were completely devoid of green, swayed gently as if they were saying that they were fine.Actually, they were probably just trembling.There was nothing he could do about it. In order to get more paper effigies to engage in actual combat, Li Changshou had repeatedly gone there to obtain tree sap over the past six months. He had also used various methods to restore their vitality.He conducted various processes\u2026The old spirit trees, which could have lived for tens of thousands of years and had hope of producing wood spirits, could not hold on any longer.I\u2019ll just take good care of them.Li Changshou sighed and felt a little guilty.He looked at the tree branch that had been planted and resurrected not far away. He began muttering to himself, \u201cIf you can\u2019t survive, I will treat your children well.\u201dA gust of wind blew past, and the old trees trembled again.Perhaps, they\u2019re touched.Ahem, I\u2019m not going to joke any more.Li Changshou tapped the ground with the tip of his toes, and his figure drifted away with the wind.He floated near the lake and stood on the top of a tree in the bushes.He closed his eyes and focused. His long hair, which was tied up simply, fluttered in the wind. The bottom of his long robe swayed slightly along with the tree branches.When it was still, it was as light as a feather. When it moved, it looked like it would shatter the clouds and the earth.To achieve such an effect without using mystical abilities and Dharma spells was also a skill that could only be achieved when one\u2019s Qi was at a high level.Over the past six months\u2026Thanks to the efforts of the old trees, the first stage of the preparation plan was painstakingly completed.Fortunately, the people who secretly coveted the Immortal Du Sect gave him time to prepare.Otherwise, he would not be able to do that much if a huge battle broke out.In the past six months, the newly added array formation on the Little Qiong Peak had not been updated.However, those array formations had already become one.There seemed to be ancient patterns growing all over the forest. They merged with the mountains, grass, and trees, and no longer seemed daunting or invoked fear within people.Trapping Array Formations and Bewitching Array Formations were meant to block enemies. The lethal ones were meant to kill enemies.If danger could be detected ahead of time and the array could deter others from entering, it would definitely not be an excellent killing array.The array below the Little Qiong Peak was in the best state that he could imagine.Due to the fact that he had obtained a high-grade Dharma treasure, that is the Forbidden Secret Manual, the paper effigies had been slightly repaired. It had reached Li Changshou\u2019s minimum requirement. There was no need for him to place all his attention on them.There was still a long way to go before he could completely transform that mystical ability into an incarnation technique.For now, he could make do with it.After all, they did not have any feelings and could cast poisons, cause fires and chant sutras. He could indirectly control them and they were mystical treasures that could be used in various ways, all day long.Of course, there were also things that did not go his way.He had obtained the Divine Poison technique from Elder Wan Linyun. As he had not cultivated for long, he was only a beginner.That mystical ability could be considered to have turned concocting poison into a magical technique.It allowed him to be more efficient in releasing poison. He was more confident in his ability to do so too.Li Changshou opened his eyes and looked at the lake to see that his master and junior were studying the escape technique.Due to Li Changshou\u2019s insistence, his master could not reject him. He started cultivating the Earth Escape half a year ago\u2026Ling\u2019e had come into contact with the Five-Element Escape Technique earlier. At this moment, she was also studying the Water Escape Technique because Li Changshou had instructed her to train harder.Hence\u2026Occasionally, he would see a graceful figure in a fluttering dress, with her black hair dancing in the wind. She would emerge from the lake and fall, causing water droplets to splash up. It was considered a beautiful scene.It\u2019s just\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re too slow.\u201dLi Changshou frowned and shook his head.He had clearly taught Ling\u2019e all the tricks to quickly cast Water Escape, but she was still very interested in \u201cappearing\u201d and \u201cexiting\u201d. She was very concerned about her overall beauty.This narcissistic little girl\u2026Why doesn\u2019t she get two precious pearls and put them around herself to give her a soft light effect!?!Li Changshou could not say anything about that. After all, Ling\u2019e was already at the age where she would tend to be vain. Besides, she was naturally beautiful\u2026\u201cThose guys are still not going to make a move?\u201dLi Changshou muttered to himself and closed his eyes to sense it again.The sky was high, the air was clear, and they were close to the clouds.After counting the time, he realized that more than ten months had passed since Jiu Wu and the two elders returned with injuries.The members of the sect seemed to have quietened down once again. The attacks seemed to have ceased as well.Li Changshou tried to follow up on the matter involving Jiu Wu, but Jiu Wu had only given him vague replies.It should be that he did not manage to find anything after the investigation.The experts from the three Dao Sects were not stupid either. The low-level method of using someone else to kill was also rather obvious.However, it was impossible to find out who the mastermind was.The seeds of discord were gradually formed from suspicion\u2026That was the intelligent thing about the culprit.Li Changshou had been thinking about the manipulative ways of the instigator.Controlling the puppets would cause the puppets\u2019 essence souls to instantly decline.What mystical ability was that?It should be considered some sort of witchcraft.There are too many experts in the Primordial world. I can\u2019t even count how many there are out in the open, let alone those who have been hiding in the dark.His immortal senses slowly dispersed.They were about to enter the second stage of preparing for the battle. He was waiting for Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s messenger jade talisman. The two of them would act together\u2026\u2026After staying in the secret underground chamber for three days where he thought about what might happen next, Li Changshou rushed to Pill Tripod Peak immediately and met Elder Wan Linyun.His method of convincing Elder Wan Linyun was actually very simple.Li Changshou pulled tricks like conveying dreams, taking oaths, provoking him, making conjectures, and reasoning. The elder quickly believed in Li Changshou and felt that there might be powerful enemies headed for the Immortal Du Sect.Ever since Elder Moon appeared in his dream, Li Changshou had discovered that using the excuse of others appearing in his dreams was rather effective.It was not unusual for Qi Refinement cultivators to detect things and have heightened senses.However, he had just been dreaming about people\u2026 a little more frequent than others\u2026After hearing Li Changshou\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d, Elder Wan Linyun reminded the sect master and the other elders using his own name.If he used Li Changshou\u2019s name, the sect would take it a lot less seriously.However, Li Changshou could not control the effect of the reminder.He had done everything he could.\u201cElder, why haven\u2019t you left yet? It\u2019s time to set off,\u201d Li Changshou mumbled.He was slightly puzzled. He had been investigating Pill Tripod Peak with his immortal senses.He recalled that he had not done much in the past six months.Most of the time, he would refine poisons and paper effigies in the sealed Pill Chamber.The poison refinement this time was purely for the increment of power and quantity of the poisonous pills.Li Changshou refined everything he had obtained from Linhai Town, the poisonous herbs he had obtained from Elder Wan Linyun and from the North Continent, into poisonous pills.He also treated those poisonous pills specially and turned them into colorless and tasteless poisonous powder.Other than that, the poison-enhancing Dharmic Artifact, which was similar to a sword, did not have strict requirements for the materials needed. It was just difficult to refine. Li Changshou had also freed up a lot of time to make a few for all the paper effigies, from Paper Effigy No.1 to No.12.During this period of time, Li Changshou had found a great use for the paper effigies. He realized that he could use them as immortal power storage devices.He could inject immortal power into the paper effigy and extract immortal power from them whenever he needed to.If he were to face enemies in the future, his immortal power would be exhausted. He could throw out a few paper effigies and extract his immortal power from them\u2026Perfected Primordial Connate Treasure!The immortal power of his main body could be restored at any time. He managed to fill the twelve paper effigies with immortal power during the breaks he took when refining the poisonous pills.Actually, now that I think about it carefully, it\u2019s pretty useless.How could my immortal power ever be depleted?I didn\u2019t train my escape techniques all these years for nothing\u2026The end of the first stage of preparations was to settle the paper effigies.Previously, he had asked his master to risk his life to go out. Outside the mountain-protecting array, there were seven paper effigies in the hidden mountains and spirit meridians. Each paper effigy carried a large number of original paper dolls and had enough poisonous pills.Li Changshou\u2019s idea was simple\u2014If an enemy attacked the mountain-protecting array, he would be able to control the seven paper effigies from afar. He would surround them from the back and use his poisonous pills to achieve victory. He would then be able to kill the enemy!Besides, both his master and Ling\u2019e had a paper effigy each, which were meant to protect them all the time.Jiu Wu and Jiu Shi had gone to Pill Tripod Peak to visit Elder Wan Linyun.Elder Wan Linyun followed his instructions and handed the brocade pouch with the \u201ccrying-face\u201d to Jiu Wu. He also harshly and sternly instructed Jiu Wu to open the brocade sachet when his sect was in danger.Li Changshou wanted to carry out the second stage of preparations together with Elder Wan Linyun\u2026Here he comes.Li Changshou\u2019s immortal senses captured a stream of light that appeared on Pill Tripod Peak. He did not expect Elder Wan Linyun to rush to Little Qiong Peak.He looked down at his paper effigy avatar\u2026My cover probably won\u2019t be blown.As long as Elder Wan Linyun does not personally touch this body\u2026Forget it. I\u2019ll take the initiative to explain to Elder Wan Linyun later that it\u2019s an avatar made of Man-Forming Paper Cutouts.The more pure-hearted a person is, the more he cannot deceive others.Before Elder Wan Linyun could fly down, Li Changshou had already flown into the sky.At the same time, the paper cutout in the secret underground chamber also looked up.His attention was on the paper effigy.Although he had been focusing on training for a hundred years, he was not sure if he would look distracted.\u2026The reminders that Elder Wan Linyun had given to the sect should be effective.There were indeed more guards at the gate than usual.Li Changshou lowered his head and followed behind Elder Wan Linyun. The immortals in charge of guarding the mountain gate bowed at the same time and said, \u201cElder, are you going out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Elder Wan Linyun smiled coldly.The immortals\u2019 expressions stiffened. They lowered their heads and used the array controller to open the restricting array formation at the mountain gate. They respectfully sent the elder out for patrol.They did not dare to ask what Elder Wan Linyun was going to do outside.After exiting the mountain-protecting array, Li Changshou\u2019s detection of the seven paper effigies that he had put in place in the past became stronger.Wan Linyun turned to look at Li Changshou. A warm smile appeared on his thin face as he whispered, \u201cWhere are we going to patrol first?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to the east first, Elder.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cWe have to hide our auras. Elder, can you display the aura fluctuations of a Perfected Immortal?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s simple.\u201dElder Wan Linyun tapped the bronze staff in his hand and his aura changed.Li Changshou flew towards the east while observing the mountains and rivers around him. He pondered silently.The white cloud quickly flew a thousand kilometers out of the immortal sect. It gradually slowed down and they began to carefully search for something\u2026Elder Wan Linyun suddenly asked, \u201cLook at the valley over there. It\u2019s quite obscure. Could there be a strong enemy hidden there?\u201d\u201cElder.\u201d Li Changshou handed the pendant in his hand to Elder Wan Linyun. \u201cThis is a little trinket that I refined for fun. It\u2019s called the Sensing Stone.\u201d\u201cThe only effect is to detect if the immortal senses and spiritual senses of others have been focused on us.\u201d\u201cLook, at this moment, the Sensing Stone is light green. This is the result of my spiritual senses and your immortal senses investigating outside. If the color darkens, it means that the immortal senses and spiritual senses of other people are watching us.\u201d\u201cIf the color deepens, it means that other people\u2019s immortal senses and spiritual senses are watching us.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThe elder was instantly amused. He grabbed the Sensing Stone and scrutinized it. Very quickly, he could not help but laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the colorful flower juice that changes color when you encounter spiritual senses.\u201d\u201cI really can\u2019t hide from your discerning eyes, Elder.\u201d Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cRefining is not all about restrictions. Elder, you often teach me to be flexible and there, I\u2019ve done it, haven\u2019t I?\u201dWan Linyun immediately stroked his beard and smiled.The two of them searched the east for a while before turning to the north.When they came out this time, it was actually Li Changshou who wanted to explore the terrain outside.If a powerful enemy were to ambush the Immortal Du Sect, they would not be able to walk over in the air. Instead, they would have to use the terrain to approach the Immortal Du Sect first.Furthermore, it was very likely that the other party would set up the array in advance. They would gather a large number of puppets a certain distance away from the Immortal Du Sect before launching an attack.The second stage of the preparation of the battle was to continue thinking from the perspective of the other party and to find a place where the other party could hide.If they could counterattack in advance, their chances of winning would naturally be higher.After checking the east, they checked the north, followed by the west.Li Changshou\u2019s main body quickly drew the terrain within a radius of thousands of kilometers in detail, in the secret chamber of the Little Qiong Peak.When the two of them turned to the south-west direction, the color of the two Sensing Stones changed, and became darker.\u201cChangshou, look\u2026\u201d\u201cElder, just pretend that you didn\u2019t notice anything.\u201d Li Changshou immediately said via voice transmission.As for Elder Wan Linyun, who liked to keep a straight face, his expression remained unchanged.The two of them continued flying in their trajectory. They rode the clouds and searched everywhere. Li Changshou and Elder Wan Linyun discovered something strange at almost the same time in a dense forest on a hill facing the sun.Wisps of aura fluctuated.Elder Wan Linyun said, \u201cSomeone is indeed spying on the Immortal Du Sect. Changshou, go back first. I\u2019ll go meet them!\u201d\u201cElder, it\u2019s not good to alert the enemy. From the distance the enemy is hiding, we can tell that they are not prepared to make a move.\u201d Li Changshou continued, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the sect first before coming out again quietly. We can catch them off guard. That\u2019s the only way to succeed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Changshou, you make sense!\u201dElder Wan Linyun glanced at Li Changshou and revealed his signature sneer.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m older than you, I can\u2019t compare to you when it comes to scheming against others.\u201dLi Changshou smiled bitterly and said, \u201cElder, I\u2019m just a little clever. Your achievements in the Dao of alchemy are unprecedented in the Immortal Du Sect.\u201dWan Linyun smiled and shook his head as he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that my master failed to see it.\u201d\u201cChangshou, what should we do next?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026\u201dDo that.The two figures gradually drifted away from the hill, acting as if they did not seem to notice anything unusual.After they were about a thousand kilometers away, two immortal senses were locked onto them, and only disappeared when they were near the mountain gate\u2026Li Changshou said via voice transmission, \u201cElder, there are at least two Heaven Immortals there. Do you want to look for help?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Two more won\u2019t matter.\u201dElder Wan Linyun said calmly, \u201cChangshou, go ahead with your schemes. I will handle the matters of the battle.\u201d\u201cElder, have you forgotten that the version of me beside you now is just a paper effigy formed from Man-Forming Paper Cutouts using mystical abilities? I would like to see you destroy your enemies later.\u201dElder Wan Linyun nodded with a smile. The two of them looked at each other after entering the sect. They remained silent.In less than an hour, two wisps of green smoke floated out of the mountain gate and hid underground\u2026The immortals guarding the gate were being watched by the two attendants summoned by the Hundred Mortal Hall. None of them dared to make a sound or move at all.In Li Changshou\u2019s eyes, there were certain situations that he had to be wary of but could not guard against.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Changshou was extremely glad at that moment\u2026Fortunately, I had come with Elder Wan Linyun\u2026If I could not hold him back, this old man would have really charged forward and faced that group of burly men head-on!1The place was 2,500 kilometers away from the Immortal Du Sect. It was equivalent to the border of the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s \u201cfamous territory\u201d.According to the rules set by the East Continent, the resources and spirit meridians that were located within two thousand kilometers from the Immortal Du Sect would all belong to the Immortal Du Sect.The other party had deliberately set up the high-level Hidden array and Concealment array at such a precise distance that the Immortal Du Sect could not detect them at all\u2026The actions of the people inside were already very problematic!However, it seems a little tyrannical to form a feud just like that.However\u2026When Elder Wan Linyun took out a Dharma treasure that looked like the Yin-Yang Twin Fishes, he pulled Li Changshou\u2019s paper avatar and silently entered the array formation underground\u2026If it wasn\u2019t for Li Changshou\u2019s quick reflexes that allowed him to stop Wan Linyun, the late-stage Heaven Immortal, the latter would have already charged out and roared furiously, \u201cBastard, you are courting death!\u201dWithout Li Changshou, the demonic aura within Wan Linyun would surge and his negative karma would accumulate.There were dozens of great demons in the array. Their cultivation levels were at the Perfected Immortal realm and Heaven Immortal realm!Apart from that, there were more than a hundred people. Most of them were at the Perfected Immortal realm, and there were more than ten Heaven Immortals\u2026Elder Wan Linyun turned to glare at Li Changshou. Just as he was about to transmit his voice, Li Changshou gestured for him to keep quiet.He took out two jade pendants and handed one to Elder Wan Linyun.It was \u2018Heart Jade\u2019, one of the trinkets that Li Changshou made.The two of them held the jade pendant and could communicate through telepathy. There were no immortal powers, Dharmic powers, Primordial Energy, and air fluctuations. They were all well-hidden.The disadvantage was that they could not stray too far from each other.Li Changshou transmitted a message psychically. \u201cElder, you can think of what you want to say in your heart. I can hear it.\u201d\u201cAh! Changshou, why are you stopping me!?!\u201dElder Wan Linyun gritted his teeth and thought, When I destroy these demons, I\u2019ll kill the scums who are associated with them!\u201cElder, don\u2019t be impatient. Don\u2019t panic\u2026 Calm down. Impulsiveness is a demon!\u201dLi Changshou hurriedly said, \u201cElder, can you tell me how you intend to destroy these demons?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to use my mystical abilities and poisonous pills, of course!\u201d\u201cJust charge forward?\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to sneak attacks, we must launch an attack first and defeat one or two of them in an instant!\u201dElder Wan Linyun probably felt that the other party did not notice him. He calmed down and reminded Li Changshou,\u201dWhen encountering such a situation in the future, Changshou, you should not be rash. You will definitely be in danger if you are surrounded.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid! The closer they are to me, the more effective the poisonous pills and Poison Technique will be!\u201dLi Changshou transmitted his voice in his heart, \u201cBut Elder, think about it. What if you get injured and die here? We\u2019re outnumbered by them. That\u2019s one factor.\u201d\u201cWe have only roughly sensed their realm. If a Golden Immortal is hiding here and intentionally lures us into the trap, that would be the second thing to be wary of\u2026\u201dElder Wan Linyun frowned. There seemed to be an expression on his usually-expressionless old face, which suggested that he was deep in thought.Changshou\u2019s words make sense.Li Changshou continued to dissuade him.\u201cElder, you will definitely unleash your power in a while. With the mystical abilities that you have taught me and the poisonous pills that you have accumulated for tens of thousands of years, it will not be a problem to kill those enemies.\u201d\u201cHowever, what if they realize that something is amiss and flee in all directions? Wouldn\u2019t that leave behind a hidden danger to the sect? That\u2019s the third factor we have to consider.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Elder Wan Linyun agreed.Li Changshou added, \u201cAlthough there are many Heaven Immortals here, there are also humans, demons, and spirits. Elder, look, the people, demons, and spirits are mixed together, but there is no communication between them. Under normal circumstances, shouldn\u2019t humans be closer to humans, while demons get closer to demons?\u201d\u201cElder, take a look! The two big demons with blue fur have similar auras and are mixed with each other. They must have been together all year round. If they\u2019re not brothers, they might be husband and wife. Of course, they could also be homo\u2026 Ahem, okay, they\u2019re indeed a thousand feet away from each other now\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at it, look carefully. There must be something unusual about this.\u201d\u201cIt is highly possible that these people, demons, and spirits have already had their conscious taken away by others! Just like the Qi Refinement cultivators who attacked Uncle-Master Jiu Wu and the others outside the Golden Palace Sect, they might merely be puppets!\u201d\u201cThis is the fourth\u2026\u201dElder Wan Linyun squinted and nodded slowly. He felt somewhat ashamed.The old man said in his heart, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that you accompanied me here. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid I would have made a huge mistake!\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cElder, you are a man of integrity. You are not an insidious person, to begin with. It is normal for you not to think about this. I was just thinking about these things previously and was worried that something like this would happen. I didn\u2019t expect that it would actually happen\u2026\u201d\u201cSigh, Changshou, what do you think we should do?\u201dLi Changshou secretly heaved a sigh of relief\u2026He had finally convinced Elder Wan Linyun.Li Changshou asked in his heart, \u201cElder, have you refined a drug or a poisonous pill that is mild and hard to detect?\u201d\u201cOf course I do. Why do we need it?\u201dElder Wan Linyun\u2019s eyes were filled with a look of puzzlement. \u201cCan\u2019t we use the strongest poison directly?\u201d\u201cIf we release the poisonous fog here, these enemies would immediately react and flee, just like how a rabbit will definitely jump out of a Pill Furnace.\u201d\u201cHowever, if the lid of the Pill Furnace slowly turns hot and the rabbit loses consciousness first, it will be roasted unknowingly\u2026\u201dElder Wan Linyun\u2019s eyes lit up. He smiled coldly at Li Changshou and thought That\u2019s true.The elder took out seven or eight porcelain bottles from his ring and whispered,\u201cThese can intoxicate a Heaven Immortal\u2019s essence soul and make his body numb. It is called the Soul Intoxication Powder.\u201dLi Changshou blinked and asked, \u201cCould it be that this pill is also made from your formula?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Elder Wan Linyun sneered again. \u201cI was the one who came up with it out of boredom. After all, poisonous pills are too overbearing. However, the refinement process of this item is complicated. Therefore, the formula for it is not included in the Poison Sutra that I gave you previously. I will teach you when we get back.\u201dLi Changshou praised, \u201cElder, I have already obtained the pill formula in the Outer Hall. It was recorded in a damaged jade slip. I didn\u2019t expect it to be a precious pill that you created, Elder.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 Take these for self-defense. I\u2019ve forgotten about this before. This is just an incapacitating agent. It\u2019s suitable for your self-defense.\u201dElder Wan Linyun casually stuffed the porcelain bottles into Li Changshou\u2019s hands. Afraid that Li Changshou would refuse, he immediately took out more than ten porcelain bottles from his ring.Li Changshou had seen the Poison Immortal\u2019s reserve of poisonous pills\u2026He was jealous.Those were his assets!Li Changshou truly admired Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s penchant for giving whenever he was unhappy.Coincidentally, Li Changshou liked to take, take, take!\u201cChangshou, can I attack now?\u201d Wan Linyun asked.Li Changshou continued in his heart, \u201cElder, I think this place is just the vanguard of the other party. If they want to attack our sect, it is impossible that there are only so few experts. It\u2019s best not to let any of them go.\u201d\u201cIn that case, Changshou, how should we use these incapacitating agents to keep these thieves here?\u201d\u201cYou should first use your immortal powers to cover the entire array formation from underground. Then, you can let the incapacitating agent slowly seep out from underground\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ve refined quite a few of them. I wanted to use them to trap the enemies instead of killing them.\u201dElder Wan Linyun answered in his heart and revealed a smile.What he admired the most was Li Changshou\u2019s personality and the fact that he never liked to keep all the treasures for himself.According to Li Changshou\u2019s guidance, Elder Wan Linyun used eighteen bottles of Soul Intoxication Powder.He used wisps of immortal power to send the incapacitating agent to the feet of the people who were hiding. Then, he allowed the incapacitating agent to slowly spread out.Li Changshou was still worried and kept reminding him telepathically.\u201cElder, give more to those great demons. Their resistance is much stronger than that of us humans\u2026\u201d\u201cElder, be careful. The immortal power fluctuations might disturb them.\u201d\u201cElder, you must pay extra attention to those on the tree\u2026\u201dAn hour later\u2026The array was silent. A few figures fell from the tree and landed on the ground like sandbags\u2026Beneath the ground, Elder Wan Linyun marveled. He was about to rush out to kill these people.\u201cElder!\u201dLi Changshou hurriedly pulled the elder and said, \u201cWhy do we have to go out now? What if someone purposely pretends to be unconscious in a bid to lure us to appear? Wouldn\u2019t we be falling into their trap?\u201d\u201cHmm, you\u2019re right, Changshou. What should we do next?\u201dLi Changshou thought and said, \u201cUse the same method to release the poison\u2026 However, this time, it has to be a fierce and powerful poison that will not give the other party any chance to retaliate.\u201d\u201cWe have to consider that they will be able to escape from the effects of the incapacitating agents when they are in a life-and-death situation, so will their essence souls and souls\u2026\u201dAs he spoke, Elder Wan Linyun kept nodding to express his approval.The elder\u2019s eyes were filled with kindness and warmth.Previously, Elder Wan Linyun had been worried\u2026He was worried that Li Changshou\u2019s cultivation level was too low and could not exert the effects of the poisonous pill and end up wasting those pills that he had painstakingly refined.However, what happened today made Elder Wan Linyun realize\u2026 that his disciple was much more compatible with the Dao of poison than him!After Li Changshou gave a few more instructions, he said, \u201cIf you have doubts, you can kill those great demons first. I have Soul-Bewitching Pearls that can search for their incomplete memories and determine their origins.\u201d\u201cIf these human Qi Refinement cultivators attack, it would not be too late for us to kill them. Anyway, they\u2019re just demons and we can just kill them.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dElder Wan Linyun agreed. After some thought, he decided to use his full strength.The elder lifted his bronze staff from the ground and pointed it upwards. Wisps of thick green poisonous fog spread out from the ground and entered the bodies of the demons that had been bewitched.Not long after, the demons started trembling.At first, Li Changshou was a little worried. After all, he did not do it himself. Without the array formation to suppress him, he had wasted too much time and did not have any other tricks up his sleeves. Perhaps, one or two demons\u2019 souls might really escape\u2026However, not long after, Li Changshou was also shocked.What a powerful Heaven Immortal poison!It was a lethal poison that could kill the essence soul of the demon of the Heaven Immortal realm!Very quickly, all the great demons in this place revealed their true forms. A few high-level cultivators waved their hands a few times, but nothing happened.Their auras were gone, but their demonic power was still full.Elder Wan Linyun was about to leave when Li Changshou stopped him once again.It was the umpteenth time\u2026Why is this elder always trying to come out of the ground? He can just do everything underground!\u201cChangshou, are we still not going?\u201dLi Changshou smiled bitterly and said, \u201cElder, do you have the True Samadhi Flames or powerful True Flames? Just burn them from far away.\u201dWan Linyun said, \u201cOf course I do. I have some True Flames called the Omni-poison Soul-Refining Flames. Its power is above the True Samadhi Flames.\u201dThe skinny old man immediately followed Li Changshou\u2019s instructions and released balls of flames underground\u2026If someone was watching the array from the sky, they would probably be able to see a horror story.The figures that were hiding here first fainted silently, and those demons were gradually engulfed by the poisonous fog. Soon, their bodies twitched and they died without struggling at all\u2026Then, green flames appeared on the ground and devoured the bodies of the demons, producing piles of ashes\u2026From beginning to end, the demons did not struggle at all. They left peacefully\u2026The people who had been bewitched did not notice anything.At this moment, a figure finally emerged from the ground.She was a young woman in a long dress. She held a pearl in her hand and walked through the pile of ashes.The Soul-Bewitching Pearls extracted remnant souls, and searched for memory fragments\u2026After a while, a thick fog emerged from the ground, destroying the essence soul of the human Qi Refinement cultivators.Flames rose, and the interior of the concealment array\u2026 was green.The young lady paced back and forth while the Soul-Bewitching Pearl spun rapidly\u2026All of a sudden, a streak of sanguine light emerged from the green fire and flew towards the young lady, piercing her neck.The lady tilted her head and turned to look at the sanguine light. Then, she patted it gently.Crack!A mosquito with bloodied wings and a black body was killed by the woman.Another ray of sanguine light was about to fly over, but it was engulfed by balls of True Flames, instantly turning into a ball of blood.The mosquito was not a real mosquito. It seemed to be formed from condensed blood and put together through mystical abilities.\u2026At the same time, Daoist Wen Jing, who was dressed in the blood-colored robe, opened her eyes in a stone cave near a spirit mountain in the Aparagod\u0101n\u012bya Continent. Her eyes were filled with shock.She had been collecting puppets for a period of time. How could one-third of them be destroyed without a sound?Due to the fact that she was too far away, Daoist Wen Jing took a long time to realize that something was amiss.Most importantly\u2026 who was that woman just now?Why couldn\u2019t I find her essence soul?Could it be that some expert had taken action?Daoist Wen Jing narrowed her eyes and felt a little wary.The casualties may have caught her off guard.However, the three most important Qi Refinement cultivators of the Golden Ao Island were not affected because they were hiding behind the Blood Lotus. Their plan had not failed completely.Daoist Wen Jing continued to close her eyes to sense the array. However, she could no longer \u201csee\u201d what was happening inside the array.The puppets were all dead.\u2026In the forest in the East Continent.Underground.As they captured the light, Li Changshou and Wan Linyun exchanged glances\u2026Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s thoughts were rather simple. He sighed deep down.\u201cFortunately, Changshou, you are very alert. If we get ambushed, the Immortal Du Sect would be in danger!\u201dLi Changshou, on the other hand, was thinking too much\u2026Mosquitoes?It could control one\u2019s mind through mosquitoes?Was there such a powerful mosquito during the Primordial World?Could it be that\u2026 the Holy Mother of The Turtle Spirit had sucked dry the disciples of Jie School, as well as the twelfth-grade Golden Lotus and third-grade Bloodied-wing Black Mosquitoes!?!Could she really be this big boss?The Primordial world is really dangerous!\u201cElder, don\u2019t go out. Use the True Flames to burn this place.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dAt that moment, tragic green flames filled the air, and the trees were engulfed by the flames.Another hour later, the interior of the array was extremely clean. There was not a single trace left behind. The ground was barren, and not a single blade of grass could be seen.A few figures emerged from the ground. They quickly used their Dharma powers to gather all the ashes together.They also stored all the remaining and burned storage Dharma treasures, into a few treasure pouches together with other treasures.Then, one of them held a wooden fish and knocked it lightly. The rest of them began to recite the sutras.Underground, Wan Linyun asked in confusion, \u201cChangshou, what are you doing?\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cReciting the sutras and dispelling the karma. If the remnant soul is unable to be absorbed by the Soul-Bewitching Pearl, I\u2019ll send them to the underworld to reincarnate and avoid future troubles.\u201d\u201cLater, Elder, you will strike again and shatter these ashes before scattering them everywhere. Bury them where they should be.\u201d\u201cCultivation is supposed to be about taking in the Qi of Heaven and Earth. Allow them to return to nature after they die. This is also in line with the Dao of the Immortal Du Sect.\u201dElder Wan Linyun nodded with a smile.When the chanting stopped, the Poison Immortal waved his Daoist robe in the ground. The huge pile of ashes floated up and landed in various parts of the array formation.Li Changshou sighed softly in his heart.Perfect\u2026Although I did not do it personally\u2026The sense of accomplishment is still there\u2026Elder Wan Linyun blinked. \u201cPerfect? What do you mean?\u201dLi Changshou quickly said, \u201cOh, I mean we don\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201dThen, he quickly put away the jade pendant in his hand and stopped transmitting his thoughts.Elder Wan Linyun recalled the entire process of the two of them killing the enemy. He felt a surge of emotions in his heart as he looked at Li Changshou\u2026He liked him even more.Then, those figures drilled into the ground and turned into paper effigies, which Li Changshou kept in an empty treasure pouch.He had to disinfect it before he could continue using it\u2026He did not dare to underestimate Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s poison.\u201cElder, let\u2019s go back. Leave these things and the Soul-Bewitching Pearls to the sect. Let them deal with them.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Elder, there\u2019s another matter. This time, please don\u2019t say that I was here\u2026\u201dAnd was doing that.Li Changshou instructed him along the way. While being underground, they slipped back to the Immortal Du Sect\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cElder, you should go to Heaven-Breaking Peak first. I will return to the peak to cultivate soon.\u201dHe had just entered the mountain-protecting array and entered the mountain gate carved out of white jade.Li Changshou handed the Soul-Bewitching Pearl and the treasure pouch containing the battle spoils to Elder Wan Linyun respectfully.It was not that he did not want to hide and keep any of the treasures for himself.Most of the storage Dharma treasures that he had collected this time were destroyed in Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s poisonous flames. There was not much value left\u2026Moreover, it was a matter that concerned the survival of the sect.It was not easy for him to have someone to rely on in the vast Primordial world.To be frank, the Immortal Du Sect had always treated him well as an \u201coutstanding\u201d disciple. Even though he was the weakest and poorest disciple in the sect, he had never been put in a spot or reprimanded by anyone since he started cultivating.On the contrary, many elders of the Hundred Mortal Hall took care of him on account of the spiritual fish and snakeheads\u2026Therefore, Li Changshou did not want to see the sect fall.For example, he had revealed the two trump cards, the Soul-Bewitching Pearl and the Sensing Stone, in front of Elder Wan Linyun today.That was a small effort for him.His principle was to help only when he was certain that he could protect himself.Elder Wan Linyun squinted when he saw Li Changshou lowering his head to hand over the treasures and Soul-Bewitching Pearls. He revealed a cold smile and kept them in his sleeve.The Perfected Immortal executives at the immortal sect who were hanging their heads low and the immortals who were guarding the gate, were all worried for Li Changshou.They did not know who this disciple who was at the Void Return Stage was, but\u2026 they felt that he would be unpredictable after seeing Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s smile!Elder Wan Linyun immediately flew to the Heaven-Breaking Peak in a bid to talk to the Sect Leader and Grand Elder about the matter.Li Changshou turned around and bowed to the immortals in the sect.He then rode a cloud and flew at a low altitude. He found a cloud path that was rarely used and slowly drifted towards Little Qiong Peak.On the way back, Li Changshou had been thinking about the mosquito that the paper doll had killed\u2026This mosquito\u2026I wonder if mosquito repellent would work on them.When he returned to Little Qiong Peak, he saw that his junior and master were still practicing their escape techniques diligently.Li Changshou did not disturb them and went straight to the Pill Chamber.He activated various array formations and looked at the Sensing Stones that were hanging all over the place. Then, he let the paper effigy return to its original appearance\u2026A wisp of green smoke floated out from the ground and condensed into Li Changshou\u2019s figure. He lifted his hand and grabbed the paper effigy before putting it into his sleeve.He mumbled, \u201cSpeaking of mosquito-killing agents\u2026 What is going on? What are mosquitoes afraid of? Should I add poison to blood?\u201dLi Changshou was amused by his own thoughts.If it was really a ruthless character like Daoist Wen, he would definitely not be able to deal with them.However, Li Changshou could think of a way to deal with a mosquito that could control puppets and be smacked to death by paper effigies, like the ones he encountered today.The Man-Forming Paper Cutouts had natural targets to restrain!Come to think of it\u2026The various arrangements that I had made in the past six months have not been in vain.The sacrifice of those old trees was worth it!Li Changshou lamented in his heart. He took out the previous paper effigies, who had cleaned up the battlefield and recited the sutras.He opened the Pill Furnace and injected the True Samadhi Flames into the paper dolls with the original mystical abilities.The flames danced, and the paper effigies turned into ashes.Then, Li Changshou checked the pieces of items that could prevent deductions on his body\u2026After making sure that everything was fine, he heaved a sigh of relief.Very quickly, he was lost in his thoughts again. He quietly thought about what he might have exposed.The paper effigies that killed the mosquito had simulated his aura\u2026He and Elder Wan Linyun had never shown themselves\u2026The Elder\u2019s True Flames almost burnt that mountain down to nothing\u2026\u201cThere should not be any mistakes.\u201dHowever, Li Changshou realized that Elder Wan Linyun shared a similarity with his master. They were both easily triggered.Could it be that they had been cultivating in the mountains for too long and had forgotten about the dangers of the Primordial World?Fortunately, I managed to stop the elder in time the past few times. Otherwise, if he personally appeared and was ambushed by the mosquitoes, the consequences would have been unimaginable!As he paced back and forth in the Pill Chamber, he kept trying to figure out what was going on. His train of thought gradually became clearer\u2026What happened today was not beyond his expectations.Half a year ago, he had made a list of all the possible ways things could develop.The battle today only confirmed two or three storylines.\u201cAs expected.\u201dApart from the fact that the Immortal Du Sect was under the Ren School, there was nothing special about it.The reason why he had attracted the attention of others was that the Immortal Du Sect and the Qi Refinement cultivators of the Golden Ao Island had a little conflict earlier on.Some people wanted to make an issue of that.This mastermind had set up a trap in front of the Golden Palace Sect in the Middle Continent and set up an ambush on the Immortal Du Sect. That was to improve the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s reputation so that the three sects would know that there was a sect in the East Continent that taught Dao.After that, the mastermind would take advantage of the meet between the Three Sects and the Golden Palace Sect to control the puppets and destroy the Immortal Du Sect\u2026To the mastermind, the price and risks were very small but they could achieve a great goal!Li Changshou seemed to have seen a black shadow standing behind the Immortal Du Sect and reaching out to the Heaven-Breaking Peak.However, there was an even more magnificent figure behind the black figure. It was slightly blurry, and it wanted to slap the black figure in front of it away.The major sects were fighting in secret.The Immortal Du Sect had a chance of winning.The mastermind behind all of this did not dare to come down personally. He only dared to control the puppet remotely through mosquitoes!This point was verified through the memory fragments of the remnant soul. In the memories of those people and demons, there were the sounds of mosquitoes.The main point was what the Immortal Du Sect would do next.If Li Changshou\u2019s prediction was correct, there would be a series of sounds soon\u2026It was definitely not going to be the classic sutra of a certain monk in his afterlife.Suddenly\u2026Ding~Ding~The Heaven-Breaking Peak bell rang.The sound of the bell was extremely penetrating this time.\u2026Once the bell rang, two figures flew out from the various peaks and flew towards the Immortal Du Sect on the main peak.By the lake, Qi Yuan immediately rushed to Heaven-Breaking Peak on a cloud when he heard the bell ringing.After all, he was the master of a peak in name.When Li Changshou saw that, he quickly sent a few instructions to his master. He instructed his master to say silent no matter what he heard or saw and told him to just follow the sect\u2019s arrangements.The sound of the bell woke many disciples who were in seclusion. The Immortal Du Sect became livelier.The bell that rang during emergency situations might not even ring once every thousand years. The Qi Refinement cultivators of the various peaks were all watching, wondering what had happened\u2026Not long after, sixteen figures flew out of the Heaven-Breaking Peak and rushed out of the mountain-protecting array, heading towards the \u201clarge gray scene\u201d.The first person was the Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect, followed by Wan Linyun and the other experts in the sect.Li Changshou knew\u2026They were not testing the results of the battle. They should be searching for the main force of the enemy.However, they were destined to return empty-handed this time. At most, they would find some clues left behind when the other party left in a hurry.The next time the other party appeared, he would definitely launch a full-scale attack on the Immortal Du Sect. Moreover, it should not be too long until then\u2026Something would definitely happen in three years!The storm was brewing, and the small peaks were sitting alone.Li Changshou lay on the rocking chair, holding a jade slip that he had copied in the Dao Repository Hall. He quietly read the words and looked at the images on it.This feeling of being able to see through the entire situation was quite satisfying\u2026Of course, the best thing should be that nothing happened\u2026The jade slip was called the Hundred Spirit Records. It contained information about plenty of delicious\u2026 Ahem, plenty of rare spiritual beasts.There were actually many natural enemies of mosquitoes.However, if he wanted to find some spiritual beasts that had good spiritual powers, could restrain the Blood Mosquitoes that he had seen today, and could reproduce in large numbers, it would be very troublesome for him.Hard work does not disappoint.An hour later, Li Changshou\u2019s eyes lit up. He had indeed discovered a spiritual beast that he had been raising in the spiritual beast enclosure of the Little Qiong Peak\u2026A small smile appeared on his face as he retrieved a porcelain bottle from his pocket.Back then, when he went to the North Continent to pick herbs, he killed Yuan Qing\u2019s group and obtained a pair of Love Gu.Love Gu was a type of hex parasite. It was considered a witchcraft technique, not a Daoist technique.At first, Li Changshou wanted to give them to the most precious spiritual beasts he could obtain. He wanted them to mate and create some value\u2026However, he had yet to find a suitable target.Some time ago, when he was refining pills to strike a fortune, Li Changshou had studied many unorthodox pill formulas and accidentally found the method to sustain the Love Gu.He would feed the Love Gu with the Solidifying Poison Herb, turn it into a rock, and call it the Love Stone.He would then add the spiritual spring water and many herbs to the Love Stone. After soaking for 49 days, he could obtain a type of secret pharmaceutical water.The potion was a rare item. It had the same effect as the Acacia Tree of Elder Moon. It could even be used in alchemy\u2026The bottle of pills in Li Changshou\u2019s hand was refined from that pharmaceutical water.Of course, it was specially made for rare spiritual beasts!\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard\u2026 Big Jade and Small Jade.\u201dLi Changshou stood up, smiled, and floated back to the spiritual beast enclosure at the back of the mountain.Just as Ling\u2019e was practicing Water Escape, she stood on her tiptoes and looked in the direction of the Pill Chamber. She happened to see Li Changshou floating over with his hands behind his back.\u201cStupid Senior Brother, why didn\u2019t he come over to talk to me!?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing for days and nights without rest. He\u2019s not considerate at all\u2026\u201dThe direction Senior Brother went in\u2026Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and hurriedly followed him. She wanted to see what he was going to get up to in the spiritual beast enclosure.She did not want to talk to him!Not long after, Ling\u2019e flew to the sky above the spiritual beast enclosure to see him squatting beside a pool.Li Changshou waved at Ling\u2019e without looking back\u2026Ling\u2019e understood what he meant. She retracted her aura and floated to his side on the cloud. She folded her skirt and knelt on the grass, following his gaze.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cShh!\u201dLi Changshou gestured for her to keep quiet. Ling\u2019e could not help but hold her forehead with one hand, not daring to look further.On a lotus leaf in the pond in front of them, there were two extremely rare \u201cspirit-eating jade frogs\u201d that looked like jade. They were indescribable\u2026Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and looked away. She whispered to Li Changshou, \u201cSenior Brother, although I\u2019m deeply in love with you, you have to take note of your image! There are some things that cannot be made public. It will affect my evaluation of you.\u201dLi Changshou replied casually, \u201cThank you, then. Help me change your evaluation of me to mid-tier.\u201dLing\u2019e rolled her eyes and snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2026 I have a good evaluation of you!\u201dShe suddenly blinked and looked at the jade frog. She suddenly recalled something.\u201cSenior Brother, didn\u2019t you say that this kind of spiritual beast is very hard to reproduce? I thought you couldn\u2019t bear to use them when refining pills and drinking?\u201dLi Changshou waved the empty porcelain bottle in his hand and said with a smile, \u201cI have my own plans.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dLing\u2019e suddenly understood something. Her face turned red. At first, she felt a little disgusted. Then, she blinked and deliberately said,\u201cEh\u2014\u201cSenior Brother, you have indeed secretly refined this pill!\u201cThe books were right. It is inevitable for cultivators who liked to refine pills to have such thoughts! Ah, on account that I am your little junior sister\u2026 Senior Brother, do you still have any spiritual beasts to mate?\u201d\u201cI will do my best to help you!\u201dLi Changshou said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t have any bold ideas. I have placed a special restriction on every bottle of these pills.\u201d\u201cPetty miser\u2026 How can you be so wary of your junior sister? What kind of a senior brother are you!?!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it. After all, I have a junior sister who has complicated thoughts.\u201dLing\u2019e rolled her eyes and looked away at the spiritual beast enclosure at the side. However, her thoughts were elsewhere.Naturally, she did not know that Li Changshou was indeed busy with work.That spiritual beast would become an extremely important part of the defense system of Little Qiong Peak\u2026Moreover, after this calamity, the Jade Frogs would not be wasted. He could also call his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu over, cook the frogs in a hot pot and enjoy them for a meal.The taste should be pretty good!\u2026After half a day, the dozen or so experts who had gone out returned to the Heaven-Splitting Peak.After a while, the Sect Leader personally declared that all disciples would be forbidden from going out from that day onwards. The mountain-protecting array was completely sealed.Following that, the Sect Leader and the few Grand Elders discussed carefully with Elder Wan Linyun about what they should do next\u2026Elder Wan Linyun was about to be promoted to Grand Supreme. However, he did not care about that. He would usually still cultivate and refine pills silently at Pill Tripod Peak.At this moment, he was in the sect. His reputation and influence were not good, but his status was not low.Elder Wan Linyun had single-handedly killed many powerful enemies and resolved a crisis for the Immortal Du Sect. Therefore, the sect had to express their gratitude.However, it was inappropriate to use \u201crewards\u201d on an elder who had contributed so much. It was also inappropriate to call it a token of gratitude\u2026The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect thought about it and could only smile and say, \u201cElder Wan Linyun, you must have used a lot of precious poisonous pills this time. The sect should compensate you for the losses.\u201dElder Wan Linyun frowned slightly. He looked at the storage ring that the Sect Leader handed him and instinctively shook his head to reject him.It was only right for him to do that for the sect. He could not accept such a reward.However, soon, Elder Wan Linyun recalled something. The corners of his lips curled into a cold smile.On the other hand, he could treat it as a reward for Li Changshou\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201dWith that said, Elder Wan Linyun turned around and walked to the door with his walking stick, leaving them to look at his old and elegant back.The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect, who was actually of the same generation as Elder Wan Linyun, immediately frowned. He looked at the Grand Elders sitting behind him and asked softly, \u201cDid I say something wrong just now and make Elder Wan unhappy?\u201dThe Grand Elders could only smile bitterly. They were not too familiar with Elder Wan Linyun too\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay5,000 kilometers southwest of the Immortal Du Sect, black figures were sitting cross-legged quietly in a valley that was covered by an array formation.Outside the array, there were a few figures hiding in various spots, guarding against any surprise attacks.There were also three to four people underground\u2026In the deepest part of the valley, the three cultivators sat in the air in a triangular shape. There was a seven-petaled blood lotus beneath each of them, that was gently spinning.They had already absorbed half of the three blood lotuses from the Nether Blood Ocean.A mosquito-like voice sounded in their hearts. The three of them stopped cultivating and listened attentively.Soon, the three of them opened their eyes and lowered their heads.\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe sound of the mosquitoes gradually faded into the distance.Yuan Ze took a deep breath and said firmly, \u201cAlthough the vanguard suffered a setback this time, both of us have yet to achieve our Dao and are unable to make a move in time. When we obtain these good fortunes from Master, I will definitely be able to!\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist! Stop talking!\u201dThe middle-aged Daoist priest on the left quickly interrupted, \u201cInstead of just talking, we might as well take action. We should have done it earlier and completed the arrangements made by the Lord!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe old Daoist priest Yuan Ze laughed awkwardly.He slowly closed his eyes and muttered, \u201cWe\u2019re about to condense a Golden Immortal Dao Fruit. It\u2019s merely the Immortal Du Sect. Wouldn\u2019t it be easy for us to take it down?\u201dAfter he finished speaking, the old Daoist priest\u2019s lips curled into a smile, seemingly confident that they would be safe\u2026The two Qi Refinement cultivators on Golden Ao Island, who had also had their Essence Soul Dao corroded by the Blood Mosquitoes, could not help but frown and look at each other.He still said it in the end.Why don\u2019t we give Lord a warning\u2026 to change it?The two of them shook their heads and pondered. However, they soon regained their composure and slowly closed their eyes.Their minds were completely occupied by that voice\u2026Absorb lotus flowers, condense Dao Fruits, and destroy the Immortal Du Sect.There were no longer many opportunities for them to think on their own\u2026The three blood lotuses spun slowly once again. Rays of sanguine light darted out and entered their Daoist robes, before filling their void Dao Fruits\u2026\u2026\u201cXuanya, there have been some disturbances in the sect recently. The situation in the sect is not stable. Don\u2019t go into seclusion for the time being. If the sect gets into trouble, head to the Hundred Mortal Hall in time.\u201dStanding on the white cloud, Youqin Xuanya felt a cool breeze blowing at her. Her master\u2019s advice echoed in her heart.Disaster\u2026If the sect gets attacked, what should I do as the current Head Disciple?If a powerful enemy comes to attack the sect, we the disciples who have yet to be immortalized, would not be able to withstand it.If such a disaster really happens, and the mountain-protecting array slips into danger, the disciples of the various peaks would allow the sect to have more power to defend against external enemies by taking good care of themselves and not causing trouble for the Immortals in the sect.She hated the fact that she had yet to become an immortal. Hence, she could not help her Master and Grandmaster solve their problems.She had to do something.Youqin Xuanya pursed her thin lips. Her gaze was filled with more determination as she turned around and flew to the Hundred Mortal Hall.Soon, she received the Hundred Mortal Hall\u2019s permission and took the Token of Permission from the elder. She was about to visit every peak and notify the disciples of her generation that there were earth meridians in their sect that had gone off-path.After leaving the Hundred Mortal Hall, Youqin Xuanya thought for a while and headed straight\u2026 to Little Qiong Peak.The Little Qiong Peak only has the support of Uncle-Master Qi Yuan, Senior Brother Changshou, and Junior Sister Ling\u2019e. It\u2019s naturally the most prone to encountering enemies. It\u2019d be reasonable to inform them first.Youqin Xuanya found a reason for herself and flew to the Little Qiong Peak with some uneasiness.From afar, she could already see Ling\u2019e floating on the surface of the lake. She instantly felt much more relaxed. She stepped on the clouds and slowly descended.As soon as she entered the isolation array outside the Little Qiong Peak, she heard some noises\u2026Croak\u2026Croak\u2026The frogs that were both near and far away kept croaking while jade shadows flickered by the lake.The place was originally a spiritual land meant for cultivation, but it seemed to offer carefree pastoral pleasure.Youqin Xuanya landed by the lake and scrutinized the lively jade frogs. She was elated.Ever since Li Changshou gave her an extremely adorable pink spiritual beast that was a boar, he had unexpectedly opened a door to a new world for her.Although she had gone into seclusion too frequently and accidentally caused the death of the spiritual beast, which she mourned over for several months before burying it under the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026 Youqin Xuanya developed a strong penchant for such adorable spiritual beasts.Standing by the lake, she leaned over gently. The water of the lake reflected her intoxicating looks and her charming figure.Youqin Xuanya stared at the two small Spirit-Eating Jade Frogs. There was a faint smile on her face that was usually cold and beautiful.However, the two little frogs that had just been \u201cabnormal\u201d seemed to have noticed her gaze as they jumped back into the shallow water beside the lake at the same time. With a kick, they disappeared along with the ripples in the water.Youqin Xuanya raised her hand to adjust her hair, but her gaze was very gentle.At that moment, ripples appeared on the surface of the lake. Three pearls slowly rotated, emitting a gentle glow.Next, a beautiful figure slowly rose and emerged from the lake with two water balls in her hands. The one in her left hand contained a spiritual fish, while the one in her right contained a jade frog\u2026Under the soft light, Ling\u2019e squinted and said leisurely, \u201cBeautiful Senior Sister, Do you want this delicious snakehead or this delectable jade frog?\u201d\u201cOr do you want your cute and virtuous Junior Sister, Ling\u2019e, to make some tea and some snacks for you?\u201dYouqin Xuanya could not help but burst into laughter. In an instant, she looked just like a plum blossom blooming, and a snow lotus that was starting to bloom.Ling\u2019e jumped over from the lake and said with a smile, \u201cSenior Sister, go take a seat inside. Senior has gone to Pill Tripod Peak.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Youqin Xuanya replied gently and took two steps forward with Ling\u2019e.Youqin Xuanya suddenly snapped back to her senses. She seemed to have thought of something and was slightly stunned\u2026Delicious?\u201cAre these all edible?\u201dLing\u2019e blinked. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cSnakeheads are delicious. They can be fried, steamed, or brewed with soup. They can also be cooked with the seasoning specially made by Senior!\u201d\u201cThe head of the Jade Frog can also be turned into a dish, a gluttonous Jade Frog\u2026 Senior imparted his culinary skills to me back then!\u201dYouqin Xuanya frowned. \u201cSince we have already abstained from eating. Why must we eat these?\u201dLing\u2019e smiled and said, \u201cPerhaps Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu can explain this. Wine is useless for cultivation, but Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu still values it like it\u2019s her life. Isn\u2019t it the same with appetite?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to prove it to you.\u201d Ling\u2019e rolled up her sleeves, took out a bag of seasoning, and headed towards the kitchen beside the lake. \u201cSenior Sister, please wait a moment. I\u2019ll show you what I can do today!\u201dYouqin Xuanya blinked. Just as she was about to say something, Ling\u2019e was already humming a tune and leaping towards the stove.Some flames flew out from Ling\u2019e\u2019s fingertips and there was suddenly fire beneath the stove.With a snap of her fingers, a spiritual fish jumped out of the lake as if it had jumped onto the chopping board.Ling\u2019e took out a sharp Dharma artifact which was a dagger meant for removing the fishiness of fish, patted the spiritual fish until it was unconscious, and started to get busy\u2026Youqin Xuanya walked over curiously, but she temporarily forgot about the important matters.An hour later\u2026\u201cIt looks pretty good.\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, try it. My skills are not inferior to Senior\u2019s.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 How fragrant!\u201dYouqin Xuanya held onto a pair of jade chopsticks, and her eyes were glistening.At the side, Ling\u2019e had already taken out a short table. She took out a bottle of fruit wine that would not make one drunk. She and Youqin Xuanya enjoyed the fish over some drinks by the lake.Soon, a white cloud emerged from Pill Tripod Peak\u2026Ling\u2019e looked at the white cloud\u2019s height and immediately said, \u201cSenior is back. Senior Sister, don\u2019t you have something important to discuss with me and Senior?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Youqin Xuanya quickly put down her chopsticks and stood up to welcome him.This time, Li Changshou did not hide. He rode the cloud and floated over.\u201cSenior! Senior Sister Youqin has been waiting for you!\u201d Ling\u2019e called out.\u201cSenior Brother Changshou,\u201d Youqin Xuanya greeted gently and bowed to Li Changshou.\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, you don\u2019t have to be so polite.\u201d Li Changshou bowed to return the courtesy. \u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201dYouqin Xuanya looked at Li Changshou and told him about the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array. Then, she said, \u201cIf there are external enemies attacking the mountain, the mountain-protecting array will be in danger. Senior Brother Changshou and Junior Sister Ling\u2019e, you guys should head to the Hundred Mortal Hall. There is a way to escape there.\u201d\u201cWe have yet to become immortals. If we remain here, it would be a waste because we will just cause the elders in the sect to be distracted.\u201dLi Changshou frowned and asked, \u201cJunior Sister Youqin, have you told the disciples of the various peaks about this?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dYouqin Xuanya was a little embarrassed. \u201cI\u2026 decided to come to Little Qiong Peak first.\u201dShe continued, \u201cI was thinking if I could ask you to help me and go to the various peaks with me to discuss this matter with the other disciples of the same generation.\u201dLing\u2019e blinked and did not say anything else.Li Changshou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He reminded, \u201cYou should change the way you break the news to them. Do not mention the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array.\u201d\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, have you ever thought that the number of disciples in the current generation have probably only joined the sect for between tens to hundreds of years?\u201d\u201cIf an external enemy intentionally plants a snitch among them, wouldn\u2019t breaking the news to them explicitly be akin to cutting off the escape route for the disciples when an external enemy attacks the mountain?\u201dYouqin Xuanya was stunned. Then, she frowned slightly. \u201cWhat you said makes sense, Senior Brother Changshou. However, if you don\u2019t trust others, how can you convince them?\u201d<Li Changshou said seriously, \u201cTrust should come only after you know someone well. If you don\u2019t know them well, how can you believe them? There were twists and turns in human hearts. It\u2019s hard to know what their true colors are.\u201dHe continued, \u201cFurthermore, Junior Sister Youqin, why do you think that there is no one in our sect who is afraid of death and is willing to submit to the enemy to survive?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dYouqin Xuanya was at a loss for words. However, she did not know how to defend herself. She pondered continuously.Li Changshou said warmly, \u201cWe are grateful to the sect, but we can only speak for ourselves. We cannot ask others to be like us. The Dao of Heaven and Earth comes from the heart. Whether or not a Dao is proper, will also depend on the human heart. Junior Sister Youqin, you can see that in this world, no two people have exactly the same Dao, not even a master and his disciple.\u201dYouqing Xuanya said, \u201cI\u2019ve been enlightened\u2026\u201dYouqin Xuanya bowed deeply to Li Changshou, her eyes filled with admiration. She said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for being careless. Thank you for reminding me, Senior Brother Changshou.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, please teach me how to deal with this matter.\u201d\u201cJunior, you don\u2019t have to be so formal.\u201d Li Changshou even bowed to her. However, he concluded in his heart.To deal with someone like this toxic girl, it is surprisingly effective to reason with her\u2026Li Changshou smiled and said, \u201cSince you want to inform the disciples of the various peaks in advance, why don\u2019t you change your words? Just tell them to hurry to the Heaven-Breaking Peak to hide if any emergencies crop up in the sect.\u201d\u201cBy then, you will guide them to the Hundred Mortal Hall. It will be better than having everyone rush to the Hundred Mortal Hall at the same time.\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes lit up. She said softly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. If it wasn\u2019t for your guidance\u2026\u201d\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, you\u2019re just a little anxious. You can think of that idea if you just give it some thought.\u201dLi Changshou cut her off without a trace. Then, he made an inviting gesture. \u201cWe should not delay this matter. Junior Sister Youqin, don\u2019t procrastinate any longer.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Youqin Xuanya nodded slightly, bowed to Li Changshou, and rode a cloud towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Naturally, she had gone to discuss this matter with the elders of the Hundred Mortal Hall in a bid to remind them not to leak the news.After hearing Senior Brother Changshou\u2019s advice\u2026It is very likely that\u2026 there is really a spy!Beside the lake, Ling\u2019e winked at Li Changshou. Li Changshou smiled at her and rode a cloud to the Pill Chamber.A moment later.Li Changshou was seated by the desk in the secret underground chamber of the Pill Chamber.Li Changshou played with the storage ring that Elder Wan Linyun had given him, which was marked by the Sect Leader. He stared at the terrain map which he had previously drawn, on the flat table in front of him.There were huge amounts of poisonous herbs in the storage ring. It was likely a reward from the sect to Elder Wan Linyun.He had once again received a bunch of poisonous pills and incapacitating agents from Elder Wan Linyun\u2026Li Changshou decided to return the favor. He decided to use that batch of poisonous pills as \u201cpublic funds\u201d by using them on the guards who were secretly keeping watch.Now\u2026Li Changshou tapped his fingers on the table and began to analyze.If I were those guys, which direction would I choose to launch a sneak attack from?\u2026Half a year later, three thousand kilometers from the north-west of the Immortal Du Sect.Black shadows flew close to the ground and quickly rushed through a desolate valley. However, those people did not notice that there was a cobweb on a rock on the side of the cliff, that was floating gently in the wind.At the same time, they moved towards the dense forest more than 300 kilometers ahead.A wooden box that was buried under the tree was gently pushed open. A paper effigy covered in cloth jumped out and used Wood Escape immediately to delve into\u2026 the trunk of the old tree beside it.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey\u2019re coming\u2026Or rather, they\u2019re finally here.In the darkness, Li Changshou heaved a sigh of relief.He was not afraid of thieves stealing, but he was afraid of being targeted by thieves.Li Changshou felt a little pressured as these enemies did not appear for a long time.Ever since he obtained the ring given to him by Elder Wan Linyun half a year ago, Li Changshou had begun preparing for the third stage of the battle.Now, it was time to test the results\u2026If the other party wanted to launch a sneak attack, they would have to approach the Immortal Du Sect from underground. Then, they would attack.That would give Li Changshou a lot of room to maneuver.The direction in which the other party appeared, and their path\u2026I was right!Although for safety reasons, Li Changshou had also ambushed the paper effigies with \u2018Earth\u2019 characters under the ground of the other five possible paths, the enemies were behaving favorably.The path that they had chosen to launch a sneak attack was one of the three main paths that he had set up.The only thing that Li Changshou found to be unideal was that the opponent had launched a sneak attack two to three months apart from the time that he had expected\u2026In fact, Li Changshou had previously guessed that he and Elder Wan Linyun might have caused the mastermind to give up on destroying the Immortal Du Sect after they schemed against him\u2026However\u2026The enemies arrived late, but they still arrived.At that moment, the seven paper effigies with the \u2018Heaven\u2019 character remained motionless. They hid outside the mountain gate and waited quietly.Their purpose was still to surround the rear after the great battle.That battle tactic did not change.On the other hand, the six paper effigies that had the character \u2018Earth\u2019 written on them, were distributed along the six paths that Li Changshou had found in advance. He had spent two to three months setting up many simple poison arrays on those six paths.What was the Poison Array?Of course, they were array formations that poisonous pills were added to.What was different was that the poison arrays that Li Changshou had set up were very obscure and slightly bewitching. His goal was for the arrays to not be easily detected.Once someone entered the array, the poisonous powder and poisonous fog would explode instantly. None of their poisonous properties would be wasted!That was the true essence of the Poison Array that Li Changshou understood!When Li Changshou set up the poisonous arrays, he had never thought that he could use them to destroy his enemies.The reason was simple. Since the other party dared to attack the Immortal Du Sect, which was guarded by a Golden Immortal, they must have a Golden Immortal expert as well\u2026In fact, Li Changshou had even considered that the other party might have a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. He had also made the corresponding arrangements.However, with the poison array he had set up with the \u201cdivine\u201d paper effigies, he would be able to destroy the enemies easily even if their Golden Immortal was powerful.Therefore, the poisonous arrays could only be used as land mines that would instantly explode.Li Changshou decided to let the paper effigy lay in ambush only because he reckoned that the other party had at least two Golden Immortals. He did not call for Elder Lin Yun to help him.He wanted to prevent him from raising his bronze-skinned walking stick and going to fight the Golden Immortals for the sake of Ren School.The functions of the six paper effigies were to disturb the enemy, trap the enemy, expose the enemy\u2019s whereabouts, warn the sect in time, and weaken the enemy to a certain extent!Hiding in the trunk of a tree, Paper Effigy No. 3 with the \u2018Earth\u2019 character was wobbling. Its body expanded rapidly and transformed into a young and handsome immortal who was clad in a long robe.His aura and appearance were completely different from Li Changshou.At that moment, half of Li Changshou\u2019s attention was on the paper Daoist. Using the spider webs that he had set up previously, he monitored the group of black shadows that were rushing towards him from 200 kilometers away\u2026Li Changshou soon realized that there were dozens of figures traveling underground.The figures followed behind a few great demons who could only burrow into the ground. Although they concealed their auras, their obscurity was far inferior to Earth Escape.Has the perfected pangolin become smart?However, Li Changshou had considered that point before.Some of the poisonous arrays that he had set up were hidden rather deep below ground, and the large array foundations were also arranged diagonally\u2026\u201cEh? Something\u2019s not right.\u201dIn the darkness, Li Changshou frowned. Images overlapped in his heart, and he quickly organized them.There is also a group of ambushers in the southwest!The enemies have decided to split up!However\u2026It doesn\u2019t matter\u2026Li Changshou split his attention into two and multi-tasked to activate \u2018Earth\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 5.Using the paper effigy, he activated a layer of poisonous arrays in the south-west direction and found a pool to hide in.After carefully observing for a while, Li Changshou chuckled.The current situation was indeed beyond his expectations. He had to admit that there was a certain element of luck involved\u2026He had used two of the three \u201c\u2018sneak attack paths\u201d that he had set up the Poison Arrays in!The enemies are really warm and considerate. I\u2019m afraid that his efforts will be wasted.Soon, both of Li Changshou\u2019s paper effigies sensed the pressure from a Golden Immortal.There were two paths in the southwest and one in the north.Three Golden Immortals?Although Li Changshou had sensed that the Dao runes of the three Golden Immortals were a little strange, the suppression of the Golden Immortals was real.Three Golden Immortals\u2026The situation is a little unpredictable. It is indeed not easy to deal with.In the darkness, Li Changshou closed his eyes again and muttered in his heart\u2026\u2018Human\u2019 Paper Daoist No.3, activate!In the Pill Chamber of Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou, who was in a daze while sitting in front of the Pill Furnace, trembled. His eyes gradually glistened.He immediately shut down the array around the Little Qiong Peak and sent a voice transmission to Ling\u2019e.Ling\u2019e, who was cultivating the Water Escape and Earth Escape on the surface of the lake, was momentarily stunned. Then, she jumped into the air and rushed towards the straw hut by the lake\u2026\u201cMaster! Senior had fainted in the Pill Chamber! Quickly go and take a look!\u201dListening to Ling\u2019e\u2019s panicky shouting, Li Changshou\u2019s attention was attracted by the enemies that were three thousand kilometers north-west.The group of powerful enemies has entered the Poison Array\u2026They had been flying close to the ground and hiding their figures, but they had neglected the path ahead.More than ten figures at the front rushed into the first poison array in the northwest direction.The poisonous fog exploded, and two people immediately fell!However, the other ten-odd people\u2019s expressions did not change at all. Their reactions were also quite fast. The glows of immortal powers and demonic powers bloomed around them as they took out the antidotes and stuffed it into their mouths. They immediately retreated backward\u2026The formation that those people were charging at immediately became chaotic.\u201cThere\u2019s an array formation!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a simple trap made of poisonous pills. They are indeed cautious. They used their powers to blow open the array formation!\u201d\u201cBreak through quickly!\u201cDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to meet up!\u201dImmediately, a few Heaven Immortal realm demons moved forward and activated their divine powers, blowing away the Poison Arrays effortlessly.In that short moment, the dozen or so people who had rushed into the Poison Array previously spat out blood and howled miserably. Their essence souls flew away.The Myriad Poison Pill was of extraordinary quality.Current results: Six Perfected Immortals Down in One Day.Soon after, the group of enemies from the southwest also rushed into the forest where the first Poison Array was located.Li Changshou found the right time to activate the poisonous array formation. As the green fog danced in the air, five more Perfected Immortals were down.Another Heaven Immortal\u2019s essence soul had been poisoned, and he had lost his combat strength in a short period of time.Poison Array harassment tactic, Green Gate!Speaking of which, Elder Wan Linyun was too biased towards the color green. The poisonous fog and poisonous powder of the Poison Pill were an intense green color\u2026Li Changshou was different. He wanted the poison to be colorless and tasteless.Li Changshou maintained his escape technique to keep the paper effigies going. They then fused with the trees and ponds.Li Changshou, on the other hand, continued to observe in the dark. Through the two paper effigies, he controlled the subsequent Poison Array\u2026The ambushers still did not realize what was going on in front of them. They did not change their path at all and continued charging forward.It seems that these guys have a problem with thinking after being controlled.Li Changshou sighed in his heart and observed the situation inside the sect.Um\u2026It was still very peaceful.The Immortal Du Sect had arranged for secret guards to guard against the enemy from a distance of five hundred kilometers away from the sect.That was because the Sect Leader and the elders felt that that distance was enough for them to react in time after discovering the enemy.However, Li Changshou believed that the Sect Leader and the elders\u2026 were too confident.Of course, he would not stand out and say those things. He was just a \u201cpoor-quality junior immortal\u201d on the Little Qiong Peak.The only thing he could do was to secretly expand the surveillance range to 3,500 kilometers and focus on a few paths.He continued to monitor the southwest and northwest with his mind.The two groups of black shadows had a tacit understanding as well. Almost at the same time, they bypassed a Poison Array hidden by Li Changshou and charged into another one.The green fog exploded once again. The two places of explosions were thousands of kilometers apart, and seven to eight figures were swept up during each explosion.Li Changshou used the cobweb to search carefully. Indeed, he had once again captured the traces of the Blood Mosquitoes on the Perfected Immortals who had been poisoned.The Blood Mosquitoes that appeared this time quickly turned into blood Qi and dissipated.This situation\u2026It is very possible that the \u2018Daoist Wen\u2019 no longer cared about the matters in this place. She had probably left early to avoid being targeted by a master of the Ren School\u2026If that was the case, the Immortal Du Sect would have a higher chance of winning.In total, there were seventy-eight demons, humans, and spirits of the Heaven Immortal realm, three Golden Immortals who were in a strange state, and more than a thousand Perfected Immortals.The force formed an obvious suppression on the Immortal Du Sect.Moreover, Li Changshou was not sure if there were any other ambushers in the other directions that he could not detect\u2026He had to consider that.From the looks of it, this is indeed the tribulation of the Immortal Du Sect.The only Golden Immortal he knew in the sect was the Sect Leader. There were only over fifty Heaven Immortals and Elders. There were many Perfected Immortals and Essence Immortals in the sect, but he did not know how much combat power they could unleash.During normal circumstances, the Immortal Du Sect was used to being quiet and unoccupied. They rarely practiced the formations of a hundred or a thousand people.Had they spent half of the efforts they spent on their Dao companions, on practicing the arrays\u2026 Li Changshou wouldn\u2019t have had such a hard time!The attackers from both directions were also tough-headed. They advanced a hundred kilometers and suffered three consecutive losses. Only then did they slow down and start to use their Dharma treasures to test the situation.It\u2019s exactly as if they are trying to say\u2026Are you impressive just because you have plenty of Poison Arrays?I will use my life to resist!Li Changshou chuckled and did not think too much about it. He focused on controlling the two paper effigies and the opportunity to activate the Poison Array\u2026Soon, the battle results increased to more than forty Perfected Immortals, three Heaven Immortals, and four severely Heaven Immortals.Although Li Changshou had yet to injure his opponent, his opponent\u2019s speed had slowed down, giving Li Changshou more chances to prepare.The effect of the Poison Array is not bad. I can focus on it in the future\u2026Sensing that his master and junior were already approaching the Pill Chamber, Li Changshou split his attention and focused on the paper effigy.Due to the fact that he had set up too many paper effigies, Li Changshou had also made detailed arrangements.The \u2018Heavenly\u2019 paper effigies were in charge of surrounding the enemies after the battle began.They each carried a large number of original paper effigies and poisonous powder. Li Changshou ensured that their auras and looks did not have any similarities with his.Their entrance was after the battle erupted. When the battle ended, the paper effigies would quickly retreat.The \u2018Earth\u2019 paper effigies were responsible for warning Li Changshou and injuring the enemy before the battle. They were mainly used to control the Poison Array. Their auras and looks were completely different from Li Changshou.Two \u2018Earth\u2019 paper effigies were currently performing their intended functions.The \u2018Human\u2019 paper effigies were responsible for protecting his junior and master. Although there were few of them, they were all arranged beside the latter.For example, the \u2018Human\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 3 was in charge of accompanying his junior and master later. It was pretending to be Li Changshou\u2019s real body and was rushing to the earth meridians with Ling\u2019e to escape\u2026Little Qiong Peak\u2019s Recovery Array would be taken over by the \u2018Heaven\u2019 paper effigy. It was also a \u2018trap\u2019 that could bury powerful enemies.A few thumps could be heard outside the Pill Chamber. A few spirit-cultivation Jade-Eating Frogs had jumped into the pond\u2026Ling\u2019e and Qi Yuan yelled.\u201cSenior!\u201d\u201cChangshou, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dTwo figures rushed into the array formation outside the Pill Chamber\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He turned to glare at Ling\u2019e.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that your senior brother was unconscious? He\u2019s well, isn\u2019t he!?!\u201dLing\u2019e blinked and suddenly pointed at the spot behind Qi Yuan.\u201cMaster, look! Senior Brother\u2019s essence soul has left his body!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dQi Yuan turned around and saw his eldest disciple smiling apologetically at him.A refreshing fragrance wafted up the tip of Old Daoist Qi Yuan\u2019s nose. Before he could react, the medicinal effect had already taken effect on his essence soul.The Turbid Immortal, who had a weaker foundation, rolled his eyes and slowly fell to the ground\u2026\u201cLi Changshou\u201d was quick-witted. He pulled out a beast-skin sack and placed his master inside.He exclaimed gently, \u201cLittle!\u201dIt was a custom-made version of Li Changshou\u2019s Master\u2019s personalized sack, which was made of more than ten types of spiritual beast hides. It instantly turned into the size of a pouch and was handed to Ling\u2019e by Li Changshou.Ling\u2019e sealed the porcelain bottle in her hand and said uneasily, \u201cSenior Brother, will Master scold us to death in the future for plotting against him like this?\u201dLi Changshou stood with his hands behind his back.He said via voice transmission, \u201cYou know Master\u2019s personality as well. If a powerful enemy comes to attack, Master will definitely be the first to fight them. I will explain to Master later on.\u201d\u201cJunior Sister, wait here for me, just like during the previous drills. In a while, the bell in the sect will ring. When the disciples rush to the Heaven-Breaking Peak, use the Earth Escape Technique to bring Master and me to the earth meridians. I want to use paper effigies to help me fight. My mind is not here.\u201dLing\u2019e looked serious as she said, \u201cYes! Senior Brother, don\u2019t worry! I will take good care of you and Master!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. I will always be by your and Master\u2019s side,\u201d Li Changshou said. \u201cEven if I cannot protect the Immortal Du Sect this time, I will still protect you two.\u201dLing\u2019e bit her lips and asked softly, \u201cSenior Brother, I still feel uneasy\u2026 What level are you at now?\u201dLi Changshou pursed his lips. \u201cLevel 8 of Void Return Stage.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Ling\u2019e pursed her lips and did not ask further.Li Changshou laughed and did not waste any more effort. After all, there were still many places where he needed to put more effort into\u2026This paper effigy sat in front of the Pill Furnace and closed his eyes.Ling\u2019e also knelt beside Li Changshou. She tied her master\u2019s canvas bag around her waist and waited quietly for the bell to ring.Although she did not know what was going on with the strong enemy, she felt that it was 80% right since Li Changshou said so\u2026As for the other 20%\u2026It\u2019s possible that this is a small test that Senior Brother has for me!\u2026While the two of them worked together to knock out their master, the two enemy troops had already charged from two directions, into the area 1,500 kilometers away where the Poison Arrays were the most densely-packed.If one were to look down from the sky, they would be able to see some strange scenes.Two swarms of black shadows flew close to the ground like locusts, but they kept moving and stopping. Their formation was disrupted from time to time.In the various terrains on both sides in front of them, there would always be a thick fog that would gush out without warning.Even though they were already on guard, they could not help but fall to the ground every time the Poison Array erupted.Li Changshou was slightly impressed by that situation\u2026At this moment, the other party has yet to come to their senses.Logically speaking, these guys should have felt that they had been exposed when they discovered the first Poison Array.What Li Changshou was most worried about was that those puppets would fly into the sky and directly attack the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s mountain gate. The Poison Array that followed would then not have much effect on them\u2026However, just as Li Changshou had predicted, after becoming puppets, the demons, humans, and spirits had lost most of their abilities to think. They only knew how to follow orders.That gave the Poison Arrays a good opportunity to function.After counting the distance between the two powerful enemies and the gate, he realized that it was already close to 2,500 kilometers.Li Changshou sighed in his heart. He borrowed the hands of the two paper effigies and activated the remaining Poison Arrays that were facing both directions.If he had known that the enemies were that tough, he would have set up ten times the number of Poison Arrays in a few directions at the same time. He might have been able to resolve most of the sect\u2019s crisis\u2026Forget it. Elder did not give me that many poisonous pills anyway. It\u2019s useless to think about it.At the bottom of the tree trunk and the pond, two paper effigies who had completed the first half of their mission had disappeared and left temporarily.Li Changshou\u2019s mind\u2026was instantly shifted to the \u2018Explode\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 3 and No. 5!In the blink of an eye, two sullen-faced elders flew out from a forest and a stream respectively, which were a few kilometers away from the mountain-protecting array formation.They flew into the sky in a daze, looking down at the Immortal Du Sect from the southwest and northwest.The location where those two old daoists were, perfectly corresponded to the two enemy troops!Their auras were trembling, and immortal power surged within their bodies.Immortal power emerged from the Immortal Du Sect and was immediately attracted by the two old cultivators.An old-looking elder muttered some words that resonated with the thoughts of many other immortals.\u201cWhat are these two Fellow Daoists doing? Why do they look like strangers\u2026\u201dCrack!In the darkness, Li Changshou snapped his fingers and quickly retracted his thoughts from the two paper effigies.\u201cOpen your eyes and take a look!\u201dThe two old Daoists raised their heads and roared emitting dazzling immortal light from the inside out\u2026They then exploded outside the array!The sound was like rumbling thunder. The immortal power that erupted transformed into a wave of air that surged forward, causing the mountain-protecting array to quake continuously!The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect who witnessed the scene\u2026 were completely confused.What is going on?Two Daoists suddenly appeared. They roared and self-destructed, just to shake the mountain-protecting array?Just to let us hear the sounds?The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect was also awakened from his meditation\u2026The Golden Immortal Immortal Immortal Spiritual Sense looked in two different directions and immediately discovered two groups of black figures charging towards the Immortal Du Sect!\u201cOh no!\u201dThe middle-aged-looking Daoist priest dashed out of his seclusion chamber and appeared on the Heaven-Splitting Peak. He looked towards the north-west, and then towards the south-west. He shouted, and his voice traveled thousands of kilometers.\u201cWho are you? How dare you offend our Immortal Du Sect!\u201d\u201cThe elders of the various peaks, listen to my orders! Prepare for battle and defend the sect!\u201dThe large bell beside the main hall was knocked against the pillar, and two Perfected Immortal executives immediately hugged it. They tried their best to knock on the bell inside the sect!Those who were originally in seclusion, cultivating, playing chess, joking, or spending time with their Dao-companion in the sect were all awakened by the Sect Leader\u2019s voice!Numerous figures rushed out from each peak\u2026On the other side, the two groups of mosquito puppets that more than 2,000 kilometers away had finally discovered the fact that they had exposed their tracks\u2026Old Daoist Yuan Ze, who was wearing a withered-wood mask, and the other two phony Golden Immortals, gave orders simultaneously!The figures that were originally speeding along the ground rushed towards the sky in rows. They formed two thick clouds and rushed to the Immortal Du Sect at the same time.The three Qi Refinement cultivators from Golden Ao Island, who had been hiding their auras, unleashed their Golden Immortal oppressive power!In the Immortal Du Sect, the Sect Leader and the aura of another Golden Immortal soared into the sky to respond!Li Changshou secretly observed and noticed that another Golden Immortal\u2019s aura was rushing out of the Dao Repository Hall.Is that\u2026Elder Qi Ling?Tsk, his Dao name is indeed strange!Before Li Changshou could think any further, there were rumbling sounds from various peaks.On the sixteen high mountains, sixteen pillars of light various colors shot up from the top of the peaks. A steady stream of spiritual power entered the mountain-protecting array formation!The mountain-protecting array formation was no longer as thin and smooth as it used to be. It was thicker, wider, and was full of power!In the southwest and north-west directions, two dark clouds rushed over aggressively. Their speed was actually\u2026 not much faster than before.He was going all out and attacking them head-on!Due to the fact that he had discovered the enemy\u2019s tracks in time, the Immortal Du Sect had also started to arrange their troops according to plan.The Perfected Immortals and Heaven Immortals of the various peaks started to gather towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak. Then, they were split into two groups, each flying towards the southwest, northwest, and the outer peaks.The Essence Immortals gathered on the Heaven-Breaking Peak and began to prepare for formation.The disciples from each peak were also brought to the Hundred Mortal Hall on the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Youqin Xuanya led a few Heaven-Breaking Peak disciples to gather in front of the Hundred Mortal Hall in an orderly manner, guiding the disciples could not participate in the battle.At that moment, there was no need to be anxious and flee immediately.The mountain-protecting array formation was the first barrier.The experts in the sect were the second.If the battle situation was not favorable and they were to really end up at the brink of death, those disciples and some Essence Immortals would be sent underground and moved away by the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array\u2026Most of the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect were stunned. They did not know why they were suddenly attacked by a powerful enemy.However, they would not give up their lives!The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect also put away their usual kindness and smiles.They were either gritting their teeth and glare at the explicable enemies that were rushing over from afar and disturbing their quiet cultivation; or glowering at the enemies with their eyes filled with fury and their hearts full of exasperation.Although some looked nervous and worried, most of the cultivators from the Immortal Du Sect did not fumble the ball\u2026On the Little Qiong Peak.The various layers of array formations that Li Changshou had set up had been activated. It had become a dangerous place.On the other hand, Ling\u2019e was carrying the Paper Effigy No. 3 on her shoulder. She carried her master who had passed out and then used the Earth Escape technique to slowly touch the earth meridians\u2026She seemed to be carrying the future of Little Qiong Peak on her delicate shoulders !At this moment, she had also snapped out of her usual playful personality. Her eyes flashed continuously. Her level of alertness far exceeded that of ordinary people.In a corner of the bookshelf in the empty Pill Chamber, a bamboo box was opened and another paper effigy appeared. On his back were the words \u2018Heaven Splits\u2019The paper effigy jumped onto the ground and swayed, transforming into Qi Yuan\u2019s appearance. He held three array-controlling jade tokens in his hand.Li Changshou remained focused on the battle inside the sect.Then, he multi-tasked and fished out the \u2018Earth\u2019 Paper Effigy No.3 and No.5, who were originally controlling the Poison Array thousands of kilometers away, from the tree trunk and pond.They had yet to complete their tasks.The two paper effigies\u2019 actions were almost synchronized. The original paper dolls jumped out from each of their sleeves.After that, the two paper effigies used Earth Escape to get to the place where the Poison Array had exploded.There were four paper dolls on both sides, and they transformed into men and women of different ages. They followed closely behind the paper effigy and flew forward\u2026Li Changshou could not ignore the corpses of his companions.Apart from the corpses, the paper dolls began to deal with the poisonous fog scattered everywhere. They did not want anything to happen and cause new karma.They were responsible for protecting the primordial environment.In the two directions, there were a total of eight original paper dolls working hard. The two paper effigies, who only had the power of Li Changshou\u2019s mystical abilities, hid underground and did not dare to show their faces\u2026He had no choice. He had to keep a close eye on the mosquito deterrence!The two groups of four paper dolls had a clear division of labor. They worked well together, and their movements were efficient and stable.They used the treasure bag meant for storing poisons, to collect the poison that was spreading everywhere.They destroyed the Poison Arrays that had not been activated before.They collected all the corpses and took away the storage Dharma treasures on the other party\u2019s body\u2026Halfway through, thunder rumbled outside the Immortal Du Sect.Outside the mountain-protecting array, the five Golden Immortals had already started fighting. The aftershocks of the battle caused a small part of the world to change color.The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect was fighting against two people from the southwest. Elder Qi Ling was blocking another hostile Golden Immortal from the northwest, preventing the three Golden Immortal experts from approaching the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s mountain-protecting array formation.All sorts of lights from the treasure interweaved, and both sides attacked!However, outside the mountain-protecting array, the ferocious Heaven Immortals were already attacking the array wall\u2026Li Changshou did not bother about it and continued to get busy.Now was not the time for the \u2018Heaven\u2019 paper effigies to appear. There was still a long process for the other party to attack the array.The paper Daoists on both sides increased their speed and finally gathered the corpses they had left behind before the mountain-protecting array was destroyed. They also cleaned up the poisonous gas that permeated the area.Then, the two Sky Treasure Umbrellas were thrown into the air and they opened up two isolation arrays.The four paper dolls each threw out a Soul-Bewitching Pearl. They searched for remnant souls with high-intensity. Then, they took out wooden fish, copper bell, clapper, and trumpets.1The wooden fisher recited the sutra.The person who struck the clapper chanted the curse of disaster relief and blessing.The person who rang the Bronze Bell chanted the Rebirth Curse.The two paper dolls holding the trumpets raised their hands and scattered True Samadhi Flames, lighting up the demons, humans, and corpses of the spirits. Then, they took a deep breath, raised their heads, and began playing sorrowful tunes\u2026From now on, apart from forcefully exceeding the limits after the battle, I will also give you a funeral service!The five Golden Immortals were fighting near the Immortal Du Sect. They shot out rays of light, causing the earth to tremble.Li Changshou secretly observed for a while. After waiting for a while, the corpses on both sides had already been burned. They had also finished reading their scriptures, leaving two piles of black ashes on the ground.This time, the four paper dolls attacked at the same time and blew away the ashes\u2026During special times, he could only sacrifice some sense of rituals.Anyway, there were still many opportunities to do so during the battle\u2026The eight paper dolls cleared their tracks and used the Earth Escape Technique to burrow underground, returning to the sleeves of the two paper effigies.The two paper effigies had officially completed their missions. They headed towards their previous hiding place, waiting for Li Changshou to retrieve or destroy them.If the Immortal Du Sect could stay strong, they would naturally have a chance of being retrieved. It was not easy for paper effigies to be refined.If the Immortal Du Sect really could not protect them this time, there was nothing they could do. They could only be destroyed, leaving no traces behind\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Youqin Xuanya felt that she should shoulder that responsibility because she was given the honor of being the Head Disciple.However, in terms of cultivation level, the Head Disciple should be\u2026 a certain unknown man whose last name was Li\u2026He was a Perfected Immortal who had used the Transformation technique on his main body. He was hiding in a place that he thought was very safe. Although he had avoided the battle outside, he had put in a lot of effort to plan, set up, and stabilize the situation in the immortal sect\u2026\u201cXuanya!\u201dAn elder in the Hundred Mortal Hall called Youqin Xuanya over.A few Perfected Immortal realm elders, who were on duty to deal with external affairs, handed the jade talisman to Youqin Xuanya. They also had to rush to the outer mountains to fight!\u201cRest assured, Elders!\u201dYouqin Xuanya held the jade talisman in her hand, her eyes filled with determination.The elders nodded and smiled, although\u2026 deep down, Youqin Xuanya\u2019s words made them feel a little uneasy.The Perfected Immortal elders immediately rode a cloud towards the southwest.There were still more than a hundred Essence Immortals left in the place. They were in formation to protect the disciples of the various peaks, in case they were injured by the aftermath of the battle.The disciples, who were being protected and ready to retreat at any time, could not help much at the moment. They could only look up at the sky outside the array\u2026Their spiritual senses could not extend too far, but they could not help but feel shocked.Usually, those who studied more often would continuously comment and describe the situation beautifully.For example, they would say, \u201cLook at those techniques. They\u2019re really\u2026 impressive, formidable, incredible and fierce like a thunderstorm!\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden, the earth shook together with the mountains. All of a sudden, the rays light from the treasure scattered in all directions!\u201d\u201cThe power of a Golden Immortal shocks our souls!\u201dA few people at the side would nod in agreement and immediately say, \u201cNot bad, not bad.\u201d They wanted to be as cultured as the learned people of the Primordial World.There were also those who were focused on cultivating Dao. Apart from those who read other books that contained irrelevant information, most of them were focused on watching the battle and cheering\u2026\u201cImpressive!\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s impressive.\u201d\u201cWhen can we be so powerful!?!\u201dThere were loyal and human disciples as well. They had already decided to live and die with the immortal sect.The news about the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array quickly spread among the crowd. Many disciples heaved a sigh of relief.Everyone had their own thoughts and it was all reasonable.However, the situation around the mountain-protecting array was getting tenser and tenser.On both sides of the south-west and north-west, hundreds of black shadows were attacking the light wall of the mountain-protecting array.In contrast, the Perfected Immortals and Heaven Immortals in the sect were preparing to charge!After the Mountain-Protection Array was fully activated, it was like an impenetrable turtle shell. Outsiders could not attack it for a while, and the people inside could not use mystical abilities or throw out any Dharma treasures.Looking at the attacks launched by the black shadows outside, they felt that the mountain-protecting array formation would not be able to hold on for much longer.The black shadows were all puppets controlled by the Blood Mosquitoes. Although their minds were not sharp during their journey, most of them did not think and only followed the orders that were given beforehand.However, when they fought, they had much better chemistry with each other than the Immortal Du Sect immortals\u2026Fortunately, Li Changshou\u2019s Poison Array had consumed about 20% of the mosquito puppets\u2019 total combat power.With the mountain-protecting array, he could use the power of the earth meridians and Spirit Stones to consume thee immortal power of the puppets, as well as their demonic power, and spiritual energy.In the following battle, although the Immortal Du Sect was still at a disadvantage, the disadvantage was not too great.\u2026Youqin Xuanya, who had been busy in front of the Hundred Mortal Hall for a while, stood at the roof of the hall to rest. Her gaze swept across the surroundings below.Why isn\u2019t Senior Brother Changshou here?\u2019Youqin Xuanya was shocked. She searched carefully again.She quickly confirmed that Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e were not outside the Hundred Mortal Hall.Youqin Xuanya immediately looked in the direction of the Little Qiong Peak and frowned slightly. She wanted to rush to the Little Qiong Peak and take Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e to where she was.However, just as Youqin Xuanya was about to activate her Dharma powers to fly into the sky, a voice suddenly entered her ears\u2026\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, it\u2019s not convenient for Ling\u2019e and I to appear now.\u201cIf the mountain-protecting array is broken later, we will meet at the underground array.\u201dYouqin Xuanya heaved a sigh of relief after hearing those words.Although she did not know why Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e were hiding in the crowd, she did not need to be too anxious since Senior Brother Changshou had said so\u2026At the same time, in a narrow and dark corner, Li Changshou heaved a sigh of relief.Fortunately, he had prepared himself in advance for the poison!After \u201cresolving\u201d the hidden danger, Li Changshou continued to observe. If Jiu Jiu and Jiu Wu wanted to \u201ctake a look\u201d later, he would have to continue sending voice transmissions.That was also the disadvantage of having too many friends.A distance 1,500 kilometers southwest and northwest away, the two paper effigies controlling the Poison Arrays had completed their mission and returned to their small boxes.Li Changshou could temporarily rest.The current situation was much simpler than what Li Changshou had prepared for previously.The other party only had three Golden Immortal experts and no Zenith Heaven Immortals.Moreover, the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect were not simple-minded.Looking at the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s formation, it\u2019s obvious that they were going to fight and retreat later.The Grand Elders\u2019 lips kept moving. They are probably sending voice transmissions to various places to tell them how to deal with the enemy later.That made Li Changshou feel relieved.The paper doll retained Qi Yuan\u2019s figure and sat on the rocking chair in front of the Pill Chamber.Li Changshou borrowed the paper effigy to watch the Golden Immortals fight and observe the array formations.In his head, he carefully tried to deduce the location where the paper effigy would take action next. He waited for the opportunity to begin the official battle when the mountain-protecting array formation was destroyed\u2026Little Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu and Uncle-Master Jiu Wu are protected by Exalted Wang Qing. I don\u2019t need to worry too much.Li Changshou scanned the southwest direction with his immortal senses and found traces of his Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu.The Nine Jiu Immortals stood in a line, each holding a Dharma treasure and circulating their mystical abilities while standing behind their master, Exalted Wang Qing.Among the nine of them, the elegant Eldest Senior Sister Jiu Yiyi was the most eye-catching.This fairy\u2019s face was as cold as ice. There were three or four treasures floating around her. Her cultivation level was actually at the early-stage of the Heaven Immortal realm.The two Grand Elders were standing beside Exalted Wang Qing. They were standing at the front of the South-West Array formation with twelve Heaven Immortal Elders.The sect was under attack. Those with higher cultivation levels would rush to the peak first. That was the rule of the Immortal Du Sect.The man seemed to have thought of something. He turned to look at his little disciple and asked, \u201cLittle Jiu?\u201dHugging the big gourd, Jiu Jiu looked uneasy and from time to time, she would look at the Little Qiong Peak and quickly agreed.\u201cMaster, I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The corners of Exalted Wang Qing\u2019s lips twitched.Little Jiu\u2019s cultivation level is not bad.\u201cIf there\u2019s a chaotic battle later, remember to help each other and take care of Little Wu. He has not recovered from his old injuries.\u201dJiu Wu looked ashamed. The other eight fellow immortals bowed in agreement.However, Jiu Wu recalled how he had been threatened by Elder Wan Linyun when he visited him.Cough. He had been repeatedly instructed by Elder Wan Linyun.\u201cIf the mountain-protecting array formation is broken by a powerful enemy, you will immediately retreat to the Heaven-Breaking Peak. Do not fight with anyone and open this brocade pouch!\u201dThe brocade pouch was in Jiu Wu\u2019s sleeve. He did not dare to take it away.Back then, when Elder Wan Linyun said those words, he and Jiu Shi were so frightened that they could not regain their senses for a few days.Jiu Wu thought for a moment and took two steps forward. Standing behind Exalted Wang Qing, he reported the matter that Elder Wan Linyun had previously told him about.Exalted Wang Qing did not ask further and he instructed Jiu Wu to do as Elder Wan Linyun said.Jiu Wu retreated to his position and looked outside the array formation. He stared at the figures attacking the mountain-protecting array formation and gripped his sword tightly.He had processed a few bottles, but he immediately activated the Myriad poisonous pill.Jiu Wu thought Disciple-Nephew Changshou should have gone to the Heaven-Breaking Peak by now.His immortal senses swept past the Hundred Mortal Hall of the Heaven-Breaking Peak. Jiu Wu frowned.After searching carefully, the short Daoist was stunned.Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e were not in the Hundred Mortal Hall. They were not even on the Heaven-Breaking Peak!Jiu Wu suddenly thought of something and felt anxious\u2026After much thought, he couldn\u2019t help but worry about Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e\u2019s safety.Once again, Jiu Wu said to his master, \u201cMaster, I want to go to the Little Qiong Peak first and bring Disciple-Nephew Changshou and Ling\u2019e to the Hundred Mortal Hall.\u201d\u201cDisciple-Nephew Changshou has always been hot-blooded. I\u2019m worried that he will use the array formation he set up to injure the enemy and help us fight!\u201dExalted Wang Qing nodded and said, \u201cAlright.\u201dJiu Jiu, who was standing at the side, wanted to say something but hesitated. She pursed her lips and continued to stay there, fighting alongside her senior brothers and sisters.It\u2019s just taking Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e to the Hundred Mortal Hall. Fifth Senior Brother can go alone.Jiu Wu took a look at the rather sturdy mountain-protecting array formation and left in a hurry, rushing towards the Little Qiong Peak.Indeed\u2026In the darkness, Li Changshou, who had captured that scene, sighed in his heart. He was about to speak to Jiu Wu.At this moment!Golden rays of light flashed in the sky, and a long sword with a little bit of merit slashed through the cloud path, dragging out a ten-thousand-feet-long sword beam. It was proceeding with an unstoppable momentum!A Golden Immortal suddenly attacked the mountain-protecting array formation!The light wall of the mountain-protecting array trembled violently. The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect shouted and once again held back the two Golden Immortals\u2026While the mountain-protecting array was not stable, countless streams of light erupted at the same time outside the array formations at the southwest and north-west!The tacit understanding between the Mosquito Puppets was fully displayed!The flash from the array\u2019s light wall suddenly stopped. In the next moment, it exploded. Primordial Energy surged in all directions like a tsunami!A Grand Elder of the Immortal Du Sect raised the shimmering pagoda high and shouted, \u201cAttack!\u201dIn an instant, countless streams of light burst out from the south-west, north-west, and north-west sides. Mystical abilities and Dharma treasures were unleashed simultaneously!In the north-west direction, a poisonous hand that blotted out the sky was pressed downwards. Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s sleeves fluttered as his beard and hair parted. He looked majestic.However, the seven to eight Heaven Immortal realm demons were prepared for it. They sacrificed their Dharma treasures and worked together to fend off the Poisonous Immortal!The other immortals from both sides only dared to use Dharma treasures and mystical abilities to attack from afar. They did not dare to step into the green poisonous fog that was rapidly spreading.In the south-west direction, dozens of Heaven Immortals were engaged in close combat. The sky was filled with streams of light, and there were already people falling from the clouds\u2026When Jiu Wu saw that, he immediately turned around to help.However, just as he turned around, he heard a voice transmission beside his ear.\u201cOpen the brocade pouch. Do not interfere with anything else. You can\u2019t turn the situation around by yourself!\u201dElder Wan!Jiu Wu was stunned. He took out the brocade pouch from his sleeve and took a look. Then, he suddenly realized something.Uh\u2026Why have I never thought of this before?Looking at the intense battle, the short Daoist gritted his teeth and stomped his feet. Then, he turned around and rushed towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak!Li Changshou, who had been hiding in the dark, was obviously the one who had transmitted his voice to Jiu Wu earlier. He had only imitated Elder Wan\u2019s voice and tone.Elder Wan was currently engaged in a fierce battle in the north-west direction of the sect. How could he care about Jiu Wu?After this\u2026I\u2019ll see how you cry, Uncle-Master.Li Changshou shifted his mind and started multitasking again.In the forest hundreds of kilometers away from the Immortal Du Sect, four wooden boxes were opened by the paper doll.The paper effigies, that were covered in cloth bags and were of an astonishing thickness, jumped out of the box. Their bodies swayed and expanded rapidly, turning into two men, two women, and four Dao cultivators.Close the door and release the dogs!Uh, I can scold myself, but I should hit a dog!Two figures from the north and south executed the Earth Escape technique and headed towards the two areas outside the Immortal Du Sect where the intense battles were taking place\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment the mountain-protecting array formation was broken through, he used the Immortal-tier Wind Speech Incantation to imitate Elder Wan\u2019s voice.Before he transmitted his voice to his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu, Li Changshou had some doubts in his heart.Sect Leader, he\u2026Can he do it\u2026As the Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect, he must have some connection with the founder of the Immortal Du Sect, the Perfected Du\u2019e.Logically speaking, Sect Leader should be considered a small fry of Ren School.The battle outside was originally meant to protect the mountain-protecting array. Yet, the array formation was struck by the opponent\u2019s sword!However, considering that the Sect Leader is fighting against two enemies on his own, and that the three Golden Immortals with unknown origins have the vicious Daoist Wen from the Primordial World behind them\u2026Sigh, it\u2019s not easy being a Sect Leader.Li Changshou, on the other hand, made preparations to run away at any time. He made up his mind that even if he was lucky enough to become a Zenith Heaven Immortal in the future, he would never set up a sect and cause karma.Once the mountain-protecting array formation was broken, there was no longer any barrier in the door.The Heaven-Breaking Peak seemed to be the center and the safest place, but in reality, it was the most dangerous place.If the Golden Immortal in the sky were to strike again, he would definitely slash at the main peak!Therefore, Li Changshou was willing to sacrifice some of his usual concealment methods to prevent his master and junior from appearing on the Heaven-Breaking Peak. He also had to arrange for Ling\u2019e to carry the paper effigies and bring her master to the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array to wait.He hid in order to avoid being plotted against. In the end, he only wanted to be safe.He could not turn the tables.With the protection of the three paper effigies, there was no need to worry about Ling\u2019e\u2019s safety.Li Changshoue had long given Paper Effigy No. 1 and Paper Effigy No. 2 to his master and junior.After sending the voice transmission to his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu, Li Changshou scanned the Heaven-Splitting Peak with his immortal senses and saw young disciples of the same generation\u2026Looking at the confused and helpless faces, he sighed softly.I can\u2019t ask too much of others.I just have to do my best and contribute what I can.Then, he continued to control the paper effigy and made it travel across the land to rush to the Immortal Du Sect.\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s broken?\u201d\u201cThe array is broken!\u201dIn front of the Hundred Mortal Hall, the disciples looked at the mountain-protecting array that had exploded and felt the Golden Immortal pressure that had suddenly increased several times. Most of them panicked at that moment.Youqin Xuanya bit her lips and stood on the eaves of the main hall. She raised her head and looked at the Golden Immortals engaged in the battle in the sky.The aftershocks of the battle turned into waves that swept over!On both sides of the south-west and north-west, two immortal wars were getting intense!Streams of light flashed across the sky, and figures were slowly approaching the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026Based on that situation, the Immortal Du Sect was at a disadvantage.What should I do?Youqin Xuanya looked at the jade talisman in her hand. It was the key to opening the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array. It was also the route for the disciples to escape.If Senior Brother Changshou was here, what would he do?Yes, he would definitely fight hard against the enemy after sending his juniors out!She could not help but think that way. She gradually made up her mind.I must bring the disciples of the same generation out safely without fail. Then, I\u2019ll come back and do my best for the sect!At that moment, Jiu Wu rushed over with his long sword. He flew over the disciples\u2019 heads and landed in the hall.Youqin Xuanya turned around and landed on the eaves. She quickly followed him into the hall.She initially thought that the Perfected Immortal executive of the sect had rushed over in a hurry to prepare to clear up the path for going down and wanted to help Jiu Wu.However, what Youqin Xuanya and the disciples outside the hall did not expect was\u2026The short Daoist let out a wail and kowtowed in front of the portrait in the Hundred Mortal Hall\u2026\u201cSect Master is supreme!\u201d\u201cSect Master is supreme! Please show your might and save the Immortal Du Sect!\u201d\u201cImmortal Du Sect follows the teachings of the master. It is peaceful and unfettered. We cultivate peacefully and protect the human race. However, we are suffering a disaster for no reason. We have been used by someone who is trying to sow discord among the three sects!\u201d\u201cSect Master is supreme!\u201cSave us!\u201dDong-dong-dong-dong. After a few kowtows, Jiu Wu laid on the ground and whimpered.Youqin Xuanya felt her nose sting when she saw that\u2026Could it be that the Immortal Du Sect really cannot survive this calamity today?However, they have only started the battle. Although the mountain-protecting array formation is broken, there are not many injured immortals or casualties on our side. The Heaven-Breaking Peak still being guarded by a huge array, we have not been attacked\u2026This executive is crying as if we are about to be wiped out?Youqin Xuanya was at a loss as well.Jiu Wu lowered his head and cried for a while. He did not feel anything in his heart and did not feel like he was being watched\u2026The short Daoist lifted his head and looked at the portrait. There was a hint of doubt in his eyes. Then, he took a deep breath and repeated the \u201cscripted lines\u201d that he had just said.Many disciples rushed to the entrance of the hall and heard Jiu Wu crying. Most of them looked sad.At the same time, on the other side\u2026Li Changshou had been secretly controlling the four paper effigies. He had quickly completed the preparations to take down the enemy troops.The four original paper dolls required nearly ten times the amount of paper required by the \u2018Heaven\u2019 paper effigies.He carried the immortal power that he had previously injected, as well as his colorless and odorless poisonous pill powder that was of the highest level.He quietly hid underground, slowly moving forward as the battle progressed\u2026During such an intense battle, the four paper dolls would be instantly killed if they appeared.He had to be patient and wait patiently for the right time!Only by maximizing the effects of the four paper dolls would they be able to live up to the expectations of the old trees!Launching sneak attacks was about being bold, careful, and ruthless.The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect on both sides were fighting and retreating as Li Changshou had predicted.That gave Li Changshou the opportunity he was waiting for.The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect were very united in the big \u201carmed melee battle\u201d.If someone was injured, they would definitely be dragged to the back. The fellow disciples who had spare energy would also quickly assist them.However, it was also because of that mutual support that many immortals could not fully unleash their powers. They could only retreat continuously.Six peaks have already been lost in the outer mountains. Although not many immortals from the Immortal Du Sect died due to the mutual support, half of them were injured\u2026The mosquito puppets were on the other extreme end.They did not care about each other\u2019s lives and only focused on attacking.Just like a group of ferocious beasts that were mentally connected, they worked well together, hoping to unleash their full power in a short period of time.Li Changshou sighed and thought\u2026Daoist Wen is really something.At this moment, he did not have the right opportunity. Li Changshou could not help but be distracted. He used his immortal senses to scan the person who was most important in the battle\u2014 Jiu Wu.There was only one way to resolve the crisis of the Immortal Du Sect from the root. There was only one way to prevent the Western Sect or other factions from plotting against the Immortal Du Sect.To get the big shot to appear!If Jiu Wu cried at the moment that the Immortal Du Sect was on the brink of death, and got a few experts of Ren School to attack, not only would the Immortal Du Sect be able to overcome the crisis, they would also be free from worries in the future!However\u2026Li Changshou sensed for a while and frowned.His Uncle-Master Jiu Wu kept whimpering and wailing. It could really make those who heard and saw him feel melancholic, but the people around the portrait\u2026 did not waver.Was he not crying hard enough?Not enough people?Or did the lines not work?Li Changshou quickly pondered in his head. He did not forget to pay attention to the battle between the two sides. He controlled the paper effigy to follow them secretly.Jiu Wu cried again. There were no Dao runes around the portrait.Very quickly, Li Changshou, who was hiding in the darkness, made a decision. He cast the Immortal-tier Wind Speech Incantation and secretly transmitted his voice to Youqin Xuanya, who was standing at the door.\u201cJunior Sister Youqin, let\u2019s talk outside the hall.\u201dYouqin Xuanya was stunned at first. Then, she turned around and left the hall without any hesitation.Li Changshou transmitted his voice, \u201cI heard Uncle-Master Jiu Wu crying inside. I suddenly thought that this might be a way to save us. However, Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2019s crying method is wrong.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a small fry so no one is going to take me seriously.. As the Head Disciple of the Immortal Du Sect, are you willing to give it a try? If you are, just nod.\u201dYouqin Xuanya immediately nodded. She scanned her surroundings but could not find Li Changshou.All of a sudden, the disciples heard a loud sound above them. All the disciples looked up immediately and saw that the clouds were flashing with light and lightning. Waves of Primordial Energy surged downwards.The two hundred-odd Essence Immortals outside the main hall all unleashed their immortal powers. They used simple array formations to create a barrier formed from immortal power, preventing the disciples from being hit by the aftershocks of the battle.They heard another roar. A divine beast that was shrouded in purple flames suddenly appeared in the clouds!It raised its head and roared. The flames around it swept in all directions, forcing the hostile Golden Immortals in front of it to retreat!It was awe-inspiring and unparalleled!However, there was a wisp of black Qi lingering around the divine beast, making it look a little weak and feeble.The Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Elder Qi Ling had already transformed into his main body!Youqin Xuanya heard Li Changshou\u2019s warning and frowned.Li Changshou asked, \u201cDo you remember my instructions? If you can remember clearly, nod hard.\u201dYouqin Xuanya nodded hard.Li Changshou hurriedly said, \u201cRemember not to utter a single word. Remember to bear these words in mind with your essence soul.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that I told you about this later. Just say that you felt something!\u201dYouqin Xuanya nodded gently. She was already very impressed by Li Changshou\u2019s excellent morals and character.Li Changshou continued, \u201cNext, find an emotion to make your emotions come from the bottom of your heart and think about things that will make you sad and angry.\u201dA devastating matter that evokes emotions from the bottom of the heart\u2026?Youqin Xuanya was a little confused. Under Li Changshou\u2019s guidance, she quickly tried to find that feeling.She seemed to have nothing to be sad about. Her family was doing well and her cultivation was smooth. Her master treated her very well too.Youqin Xuanya hurriedly said, \u201cSenior Brother, I can\u2019t think of anything!\u201dHer voice was rather loud, and the surrounding disciples looked over.Youqin Xuanya immediately turned around and faced the hall.Li Changshou\u2019s voice lingered in her ears. He still sounded like he was not in a hurry. \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. At times like this, the more anxious you are, the more prone you are to mess up.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Think of something immediately. Something that you love most, it can be a pet or something like that.\u201dYouqin Xuanya muttered, \u201cCan I think about the spiritual beast you gave me?\u201d\u201cYes, very good. Take note of your emotions. Imagine that it is swaying its tail gently in front of you. Then\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was suddenly hit by a mountain rock and unfortunately passed away. Its head was bleeding. It was extremely miserable. You buried it.\u201dYouqin Xuanya bit her lips lightly. The scene of her burying the little spiritual beast surfaced in her heart. She felt guilty and her expression was extremely gloomy.However, Li Changshou soon realized that her emotions were pure sadness and lacked anger.Hence, Li Changshou added,\u201cThen, you didn\u2019t pay attention for a while and suddenly realized later that the spiritual beast\u2019s corpse had been stolen. You\u2019ve been searching for its traces all the way while slowly advancing\u2026\u201dYouqin Xuanya subconsciously took a step forward and entered the hall once again. Li Changshou\u2019s voice was like a demonic voice that affected her mind.He said, \u201cSomeone dug it out and roasted it.\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes were filled with grief and indignation.In the darkness, Li Changshou immediately sent a voice transmission.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Keep this up! Continue feeling those emotions! Go to Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2019s side!\u201d\u201cAfter lighting up three incense sticks, kowtow thrice and say those words!\u201dYouqin Xuanya took a deep breath and immediately took a step forward. Li Changshou instantly dispelled the Wind Speech Incantation.He did not dare to enter the hall with his immortal senses and only observed from afar.Youqin Xuanya, the Head Disciple of the younger generation of the Immortal Du Sect, walked around the sobbing Jiu Wu, picked up three purple incense sticks, lit them up, and placed them in the incense burner.Then, she took two steps back and knelt on the meditation cushion beside Jiu Wu. She lowered her head and kowtowed thrice.Jiu Wu turned his head to take a look. He was confused.Her long hair was a little messy, and her icy-blue dress blossomed like a lotus flower. She had a miserable expression\u2026\u201cI\u2019m a disciple of the Dao Sect, Xuanya. I hereby greet you, the Grand Pure One of the three sects!\u201d\u201cThe Immortal Du Sect had passed down the Inaction Sutras, which were used as the foundation of the sect. The Grand Pure One had taken the position as the founder of the orthodox Dao Sect.\u201d\u201cToday, the demons from outside plotted against us and sowed discord between the disciples. They have evil intentions, and they have no previous feud with the Immortal Du Sect! The Immortal Du Sect did not provoke these demons! Please take a look, Saint!\u201dThen, Youqin Xuanya knelt down once again and started to read the first volume of the Inaction Sutra.Jiu Wu was stunned. Why does it feel like\u2026 what I just said was more advanced than what I had just now\u2026This time\u2026As Youqin Xuanya recited the second line of the Inaction Sutra, the portrait in front of her shook slightly.Indescribable, undetectable, and obscure Dao runes floated out from the portrait and disappeared from the portrait!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Beside him, there was a pretty good-looking female disciple, who also had a pitiful look on her face.The young man smiled bitterly and sighed.Teacher, you\u2019re doing this again.Since you are unwilling to go out, I want to cultivate in peace.They are probably worshiping your portrait, Teacher. I don\u2019t have any portraits or sculptures that have been passed down to the primordial times.Teacher, your realm is really too mysterious and amazing. You caused your karma to slip onto \u2018slipped\u2019 karma onto your disciple\u2026\u201cHowever, to be able to alarm a teacher who doesn\u2019t like to ask about anything, you guys are really impressive\u2026\u201dThe young Daoist chuckled and slowly stood up.He pinched his fingers to calculate and deduce. As he followed the guidance that his teacher had given him, he understood something.He said softly, \u201cSo there are external enemies looking for trouble with the Immortal Du Sect. The Immortal Du Sect is in trouble for no reason\u2026\u201dI, Ren School, did not take the initiative to cause trouble, but someone wanted to use my sect to sow discord among the three sects?Tsk, I have to manage this.\u201cThe last time I was in Elder Moon Hall, I broke the marriage clay figurine of a kid from the Immortal Du Sect. This time, I went to help the Immortal Du Sect. I can then be considered to have severed this karma.\u201dThe young man did not finish his sentence. He took a casual step forward and appeared outside the Tushita Palace.After taking a few more steps, he arrived at the Western Heavenly Gate and floated out. The Heavenly troops and Heavenly Generals guarding the gate did not notice him at all\u2026After a short while, the young man had already left the Nine-layered Celestial Palace. He was looking down at the magnificent primordial world from the sky.\u201cThe Immortal Du Sect is the Dao sect that Daoist Du\u2019e had passed down. I can bring Daoist Du\u2019e along and ask him to take action. As such, the karma is much smaller. There is another troublesome matter\u2026\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist Du\u2019e is only my teacher\u2019s in-name disciple. I\u2019ve heard my teacher talk about Dao several times. Before I enter the sect, I should call him Senior.\u201d\u201cHowever, I am the only personal disciple of Teacher. He is just a disciple in name, so he has to call me Senior\u2026 How should I address him?\u201dThe young Daoist priest was caught in a dilemma. His figure drifted into the distance, towards the intersection between the Aparagod\u0101n\u012bya Continent, the North Continent, and the Kunlun Immortal Mountain of the Middle Continent.After flying for a while, the Kunlun Mountain was already in sight. Great Taoist Master Xuandu was very reliable. Very quickly, he realized another problem.\u201cSenior Brother Du\u2019e, which cave did you cultivate in at the Kunlun Mountain?\u201dThe Great Grandmaster Xuandu calculated with his fingers and soon nodded.\u201cFortunately, the Immortal Du Sect has a large supply of Qi that can last us a long time. It will not be destroyed anytime soon. The disaster this time seems to have been decided. There\u2019s no need to rush over\u2026 Let\u2019s look for Senior Du\u2019e first. Otherwise, if we don\u2019t handle this properly, Teacher will lock us up for numerous millennia\u2026\u201dWith a sigh, the young Dao Master disappeared from Kunlun Mountain. He circled around the Jade Void Palace and searched for the Ancestral Master who had taken charge of the Immortal Du Sect halfway through.\u2026A moment ago, the Immortal Du Sect.It was useful!The Saint reacted, ahem, Saint\u2019s portrait reacted!There was indeed something wrong with the lines!Jiu Wu was excited while Youqin Xuanya heaved a sigh of relief\u2026Li Changshou was not happy. Instead, he reflected on himself.Previously, I\u2019ve been a little inconsiderate. I asked Elder Wan Linyun to give Uncle-Master Jiu Wu the brocade pouch and put up a pitiful act. However, I overlooked too many details, as well as the main objective of Ren School.Just now, Uncle-Master Jiu Wu had cried repeatedly. Regardless of whether the Saint could sense it, it would be difficult for him to bother taking a look at them\u2026After careful analysis, Uncle-Master Jiu Wu\u2019s explanation seemed to mean that he wanted the Sect Leader of Ren School to help him before the sect was destroyed.That meant that the Immortal Du Sect was accumulating karma for the sect master of Ren School.Li Changshou snapped out of his daze and found a second candidate to cry and solve the situation. He made Youqin Xuanya pay attention to the details of her emotions and the title of Saint.First, she explained that the Immortal Du Sect belonged to the Perfected Immortal Du\u2019e\u2019s lineage. Then, she read the Inaction Sutra and asked the Saint to examine and verify that they were indeed taught by the Ren School.As a result, it sounded like an external enemy was invading the Immortal Du Sect and increasing karma for the sect master of Ren School.The portrait of the Saint immediately responded!However, the Dao runes on the portrait of the Saint were quickly retracted. That indicated that the old Saint or some expert from the Ren School already knew about the matter.It was still unknown when he would intervene.Li Changshou quickly analyzed in his head.The chances of an expert from Ren School appearing next should be as high as 70%. However, it\u2019s hard to say if they can arrive in time to provide support.I can\u2019t place my hopes on external aid.I have already done what I could do in the aspect of summoning someone powerful. There is no need for me to spend more effort.To be safe, I have to persevere with my plans.If the building really collapses, I should run\u2026 when I\u2019m supposed to.Li Changshou then sent a voice transmission to Youqin Xuanya. \u201cThis is done. Junior, please wait a while. Don\u2019t mention this voice transmission message to anyone else.\u201dYouqin Xuanya nodded lightly. She seemed to want to say something but hesitated.Li Changshou\u2019s immortal senses had already left the place. He focused on controlling the paper effigy\u2026Previously, there had been some delay in the Hundred Mortal Hall, and the battles in the southwest and north were already in full swing.The two sides fought all the way from the outer area of the mountain gate to the top of a few peaks.The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect retreated again and again. More than half of the Heaven Immortals and Perfected Immortals were injured. Dozens of Perfected Immortals had died. Fortunately, only two of the Heaven Immortals had died.On the other hand, although the mosquito puppets were becoming more and more ferocious, they had lost quite a bit of their battle strength.There were already three Heaven Immortal realm demons that were buried in Elder Wan Linyun\u2019s hands!In terms of battle results, the runner-up who was catching up closely behind would be Exalted Wang Qing. He had killed a human Heaven Immortal and a Heaven-Immortal-level Great Demon, which caused him to be ranked second.There were also a few Heaven Immortal elders who had their own gains\u2026However, the overall situation was still not optimistic.At that moment, Elder Wan Linyun felt as if he had returned to the battle that took place ten thousand years ago. His heroic spirit surged, and he had been fighting alone all along!However, that old man was secretly depressed\u2026Previously, under Li Changshou\u2019s guidance, he killed many great demons but it felt effortless to him. He had at most only used a few more poisonous pills\u2026However, during the head-on battle, his poisonous pills, poison mystical abilities and poison techniques seemed to have been greatly weakened\u2026It felt rather strenuous and difficult to achieve.It did not feel as good as it did when he was working together with Li Changshou to plot against the enemy.Indeed, Changshou not only has a unique understanding of poison. His future potential is also immeasurable.While Elder Wan was thinking about it, his attacks became more vicious.He had already made up his mind. If he could protect the Immortal Sect in this battle, he would teach Li Changshou the Poison Sutra that he was most proud of. That would be a reward for the secret warning that he had given Li Changshou.Suddenly, Elder Wan Linyun felt a gentle breeze brushing past his ear, and he heard a familiar voice\u2026\u201cElder Wan, it\u2019s me, Changshou.\u201d\u201cElder, please don\u2019t reminisce about the battle. Divert your attention and observe the situation in the south. It\u2019s best if both sides retreat to the Heaven-Breaking Peak together. Later on, we\u2019ll use their array formation to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the proper way to reduce the casualties in the sect.\u201dElder Wan Linyun nodded secretly. He observed the situation around him and realized that he had already gone in alone.It was not because Elder Wan was too fierce, but because the immortals from the same sect\u2026 retreated too quickly.Li Changshou transmitted his voice again.\u201cElder, you don\u2019t have to worry about me. I will enter the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array with the disciples of the various peaks later. Elder, please take care of yourself.\u201dUpon hearing that, Elder Wan Linyun squinted slightly. A cold smile appeared on his lips.The few demons that were resisting Elder Wan Linyun panicked and hurriedly retreated.However, Elder Wan Linyun retreated at the same time. He was slightly closer to the immortals on his side.He was just happy purely because Li Changshou was safe and sound\u2026After settling the small detail, Li Changshou continued to observe the situation in the dark.At that moment, there were only a few peaks left on Heaven-Breaking Peak.Li Changshou\u2019s immortal senses captured a few injured Perfected Immortal realm elders who were in charge of the external affairs of the sect. They were rushing towards the Hundred Mortal Hall.It seemed that they wanted the disciples to leave first\u2026Next, the Heaven-Breaking Peak would become the venue for the battle.Although there was still a protective array, most of the disciples who had yet to become immortals had low cultivation levels. If they were not careful, the Hundred Mortal Hall might just experience a bloodbath caused by some mystical abilities or Dharma treasures.One of the Grand Elders ordered the disciples with insufficient cultivation levels to avoid trouble temporarily. The injured Perfected Immortal elders would be in charge of protecting the disciples later.Li Changshou pondered for a moment. He gave a few instructions to Ling\u2019e, who had been hiding near the underground teleportation array for quite some time. He told her to sneak into the crowd of disciples later and leave with his main body and their master.Ling\u2019e immediately nodded her head to show that she had understood. She continued to hide in a crevice, quietly waiting for a large group of disciples from the Immortal Du Sect to appear.As for Li Changshou\u2019s main body\u2026Two months ago, he had already found a hiding place and cleverly hid within it. He had never taken the initiative to move around.A moment later, a hole appeared in the corner of Hundred Mortal Hall.Under the constant urging of the elders, Youqin Xuanya and Jiu Wu, the young disciples rushed into the hole that was driven vertically into the ground and flew underground.When the batches of disciples arrived at the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array, Ling\u2019e found a chance and walked out from the corner with Li Changshou to join the disciples.The process was quite perfect. His junior had made another contribution.When Youqin Xuanya arrived and saw Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e, she heaved a sigh of relief.She held onto the jade talisman and activated the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array.At the bottom of the underground cave, a thousand-foot-wide array disc with complex patterns appeared. There seemed to be sounds of dragon roars coming from beneath the array disc\u2026An elder from the Hundred Mortal Hall yelled, \u201cQuick, enter the array fifty at a time!\u201d\u201cXuan Ya, you and Elder Ge will lead the way together! The teleportation array is located in a valley in the east!\u201dYouqin Xuanya immediately executed the order. She led the disciples who were closest to the array formation and rushed into the array disc. Her figure sank slightly and disappeared in a flash!The main meridians of the earth were equivalent to the \u201ctiny vessels\u201d of God Pangu.The Earth Meridian Teleportation Array could allow the Qi Refinement cultivators to follow the earth meridians and move in two different directions.The disciples of the Immortal Du Sect did not panic. Some of them even took the initiative to stay at the back and let the disciples who were slightly weaker to move forward\u2026The entire retreat was orderly. Ling\u2019e was also taken care of by many seniors from other peaks. The third batch was teleported away.Li Changshou had allowed a wisp of his immortal senses to accompany his junior and hence he had nothing else to worry about.Most of the younger generation had retreated. The Immortal Du Sect cultivators had also retreated to the vicinity of the Heaven-Breaking Peak.At that moment, the battle line was pulled apart. The main peak\u2019s array had yet to be activated.The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect looked dejected. The mosquito puppets had already focused their attention on the few Heaven Immortals from the Immortal Du Sect!Li Changshou had been waiting for that moment!\u201cPaper effigies, attack!\u201dNear the Heaven-Splitting Peak, four paper effigies appeared quietly in the two valleys between the mountains. Half of their bodies emerged from the soil.From their sleeves and clothes, white paper dolls quickly jumped out. Then, the four paper effigies quickly sank into the ground.There were twenty paper dolls on each side of the river valley in the north and south. They quickly scattered around the four paper effigies\u2026That number was already the limit that Li Changshou can relay his instructions through to control the paper effigies. Besides, it could not last long\u2026The forty paper dolls turned into forty \u201cimmortal troops\u201d in light blue armor.They all had different appearances and were not strong. Their defense was Perfected. Each of them carried a simple Dharma artifact on their back, which was a longbow, and they also held onto special arrows.Those longbows only had some basic restrictions. They were not considered treasures.They quickly rushed towards the forest in front of them. When they arrived at the hidden locations that Li Changshou had previously found, they pulled the string on the longbow to the maximum.On the arrow, complicated patterns lit up!\u201cSilent Heavenly Poisonous Arrow\u201d: Consumption-type self-refining Dharma artifact that can be cast in large-scale, provides high accuracy, and launches large amounts of poisonous powder in an instant!When killing enemies, one does not need to use mystical abilities or Dharma treasures. Instead, one should maximize one\u2019s advantage.A toned and muscular body cannot rival a brick.Release!In a dark and narrow corner, Li Changshou snapped his fingers, and the bowstrings of the forty longbows vibrated!One by one, the dharma artifacts silently launched arrows at a rapid speed. From behind the enemy troops, they rushed towards the place where the mosquitoes puppets were gathering in\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhoosh\u2026It was a very soft sound of air being swept across\u2026One by one, the Heavenly Poisonous Arrows moved through the air and stealthily darted towards the group of enemies at the back.There were no fluctuations of immortal power, nor any sharpness.However, it was inevitable for there to be some disruption in the air.In order to prevent the immortal enemies from sensing them, the arrows did not dart at any of them. Instead, they locked onto the gaps between the figures at the periphery\u2026Li Changshou\u2019s timing was very accurate.At the back of the two arenas, forty arrows successfully reached the designated height.The half-foot-long cylinder in front of the poisonous arrow split open at the same time. Waves of colorless and odorless poisonous powder and poisonous fog spread in the sky\u2026Plop\u2026They were like colorful fireworks that bloomed in the clear sky.At the periphery of the enemies, the twenty-odd Perfected Immortals did not have time to turn around. Suddenly, their vision turned black and they fell down towards the clouds\u2026Gusts of wind blew, and the poison that could kill Heaven Immortals quickly scattered. Black shadows kept falling downwards like dumplings.The Blood Mosquito puppets were truly afraid of being poisoned.This time, they reacted extremely quickly. One of the Heaven Immortal puppets noticed that something was amiss and immediately shouted.\u201cDrumming Dharma powers! Someone from the rear poisoned us in a scheming manner!\u201dAt that moment, the immortal power, demonic power, and spiritual energy around the enemies surged, dispersing the poisonous fog and poisonous powder that floated towards them!However, before that, more than fifty Perfected Immortals had been poisoned to death\u2026There were more than a hundred figures who were more or less infected with poison. At this moment, they were trying their best to resist the poison, and their battle strength was greatly reduced.The Blood Mosquito puppets immediately began to search for the person who schemed against them.At that moment, the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect were also at a loss. They did not know where the \u201caid\u201d had come from.However, they were suppressed on the cloud path around Heaven-Breaking Peak. The two groups of powerful enemies were still extremely ferocious, and it was very difficult for them to receive external aid\u2026Most importantly, the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect\u2026There was no sign of any aid!The effects of the poisonous arrows were not perfect. Li Changshou did not feel any excitement or regret. He simply secretly summarized the shortcomings of his Dharma artifacts.This method of launching poison in all directions was never as good as using immortal power to silently send poisonous powder to the other party\u2019s essence soul\u2026Overall, he had wasted most of the poisonous properties of the poisonous pills.In order to prevent the poisonous fog from accidentally injuring his fellow disciples, Li Changshou used two Heaven Immortal Poisons in the arrows, which were more difficult to refine and had time limits.After a while, the remaining poison in the air would dissipate\u2026Although the concept behind that arrow was not bad, it could be restrained too easily. Its effect was not as good as using a Poison Array of the same amount.Li Changshou concluded in his head that the battle situation had changed again.The Blood Mosquito puppets quickly determined the direction that the poisonous arrows were being shot in. Their counter-attacks were swift and fierce!On both sides of the Heaven-Splitting Peak, there were more than ten figures that had escaped from the battle at the rear of the enemy\u2019s formation and were charging towards the location where the paper dolls were hiding.They raised their Dharma treasures, condensed their mystical abilities, and smashed them at the two mountains!In the darkness, Li Changshou revealed an inexplicable smile\u2026The forty paper dolls did not retreat and hide!When the thirty-odd Perfected Immortal puppets swooped down to the top of the two forests, three paper dolls charged out from the side of the forest to attract their attention.However, after the six figures appeared, they could barely charge forward for more than a thousand feet. Soon, they were crushed by the streams of light coming from behind.At this moment!The remaining 34 paper dolls rushed out from their hiding places!Their aura surged, and their movements were quick and agile. They charged straight at the puppets\u2026The two groups of puppets that had rushed down to fight back immediately attacked. However, while they were in a hurry, half of the paper immortal soldiers had rushed to their side!Without any hesitation, the paper dolls exploded!A total of ten figures exploded in the forest on both sides of the forest!The scene was extremely tragic. The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect were furious, but they could not do anything for the paper dolls that were giving aid\u2026However, after the explosion\u2026The thirty or so Blood Mosquito puppets that had rushed to the mountain forest remained completely unharmed. All of them were in a daze, not knowing what they had just experienced\u2026The power of the explosion was rather weak.Even though the people, demons, and spirits were under the control of the Blood Mosquitoes and only had a small portion of their conscious left, they had experienced quite a bit of mental turmoil in that short period.In the beginning, they were lucky to have escaped death when the colorless poisonous fog appeared behind them.(They felt a little fortunate.)After that, they received an order to counterattack in the direction of the poisonous arrows. When they discovered the figures who had fled in a hurry, they immediately attacked and killed them. They did not waste any time.(They were relatively calm.)The situation suddenly changed. The six figures merely diverted their attention and yet, the Dao Immortal soldiers rushed out from the forest below without any warning and dashed towards them!(They were a little nervous.)To their surprise, the immortal weapons that were charging at them were very \u2018weak\u2019. If they were poked, they would die and if they were smacked, they would break.(Why was that so?)However, the other party did not have any plans. The person who had been hiding previously had not revealed any traces. The other party still managed to reach him, and the other party actually self-destructed!(Scared to death.)What was amusing was that their self-explosions did not have much power, but there were sounds and momentum. It would be better for them to be smashed by an ordinary Dharma treasure of an Essence Immortal\u2026(Why was that so?)Suddenly!The thirty-odd enemies\u2019 vision turned black. Their essence souls were in pain at first, and then they lost their sense of the outside world. Their immortal powers dissipated, and they fell down in unison in mid-air\u2026They were finally enlightened before their death\u2026(The explosion was poisonous.)At the top of the mountain forest, more than thirty figures fell at the same time.In the darkness, Li Changshou raised his eyebrows, feeling a little helpless.Why are there only a few Heaven Immortals that rushed down?He controlled the four paper effigies and made them continue to hide underground. Li Changshou did not need to look at them to deduce the reactions of the two parties.The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect were naturally confused. They thought Those mosquito puppets should be going crazy\u2026In general, the first wave of sneak attacks had been quite effective. The pressure on their side had been greatly reduced, and the opponents had also suffered a setback.At that moment, the four paper effigies at the bottom of the Heaven-Breaking Peak could not move recklessly. Li Changshou shifted his attention to the paper effigy with the words \u2018Heaven Split\u2019 written on it, and briefly checked the situation of the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s array formation.Then, he paid attention to the battle in the sky.After Elder Qi Ling transformed into his main body, he became more and more ferocious as he fought. He steadily suppressed a Golden Immortal realm expert.The Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect\u2026Although he was a little lacking, he still managed to stall the two Golden Immortals.Looks like I have to fight for a while more.Li Changshou\u2019s mind quickly returned to the four paper effigies and he prepared the Dharma artifacts that he needed to use next.The first ambush had ended.Next would be the second wave of operations\u2026I\u2019ll lure them into a trap and catch them off guard!It\u2019s soon time to strike.\u2026How can a mere Immortal Du Sect not be destroyed yet?In a hidden Cave Abode near the spiritual mountain of the Western Sect in the Aparagod\u0101n\u012bya Continent, Daoist Wen Jing was lying on the bed, clad in a light blue dress.Two maids were kneeling beside her. One of them was fanning her, while the other was holding onto some immortal wine that looked like blood, waiting for their master to pick up the jade cup.At that moment, Daoist Wen Jing was secretly observing the \u201cmassive\u201d battle going on in the Immortal Du Sect, which happened because of the blood mosquitoes that she had released.She was just watching the show.Now, as long as she did not take the initiative to make a move and just stayed here, no one would know that she was the one behind it, unless the Saints of the Three Sects personally investigated her.Moreover, the Second Saint of the Western Sect had already been blinded by her.During the Primordial World, not many people knew about her. Even if the Blood Mosquitoes were exposed, they would only be regarded as a type of mystical ability.Daoist Wen Jing knew very well that she was hiding in the shadows. If she exposed herself, she would lose most of her value.At this moment, she had to watch the battle between the Immortal Du Sects.If anything unexpected happened, such as the sudden arrival of experts from the Ren School to help the Immortal Sect, she would destroy the souls of the three Golden Immortals and use their bodies as a gift to the Jie School\u2026This scheme is much more interesting than fighting and killing.Daoist Wen Jing revealed a charming and intoxicating smile. The two demon maids beside her simply lowered their heads as they did not dare to look at her.Daoist Wen Jing began to watch the show. Five Golden Immortals were fighting.Her attention had always been attracted by the battle between Golden Immortals and Heaven Immortals.To her, Perfected Immortals were no different from Qi Refinement cultivators who had yet to become immortals. They were boring, monotonous, and mundane.She felt that it was more interesting to watch a Golden Immortal fight, especially the rare, primeval species\u2014the auspicious beast, Qilin. That made Daoist Wen Jing very hungry.When Li Changshou secretly used the paper effigy to launch the first wave of attacks, he killed more than eighty Perfected Immortals and injured more than a hundred them, causing the situation between the two sides to be reversed to a certain extent.The balance of victory and defeat had temporarily stabilized.Hmm? What\u2019s going on below?Daoist Wen Jing scanned the surroundings of the Heaven-Breaking Peak, and her lips curled into a disdainful smile.The puppets that she had collected at the last minute were of no use. They were about to be beaten up again!Forget it. The Immortal Du Sect would probably not be destroyed in this battle today\u2026If that continued, the power of the blood lotus in the bodies of the three phony Golden Immortals would be completely depleted.Hmph, if their own disciples were to attack, the tiny Immortal Du Sect would be gone in an instant\u2026Right, where did the disciples of the Immortal Du Sect go?Daoist Wen Jing was a little puzzled. She looked up and down for a while and soon sneered.There are some remnants of spiritual energy in the underground earth meridians. It seems to be\u2026 an Earth Meridian Teleportation Array?Did they escape to the east?Do you think you can hide this from me, the Queen?Since I can\u2019t destroy your sect, the effect of killing your disciples would be pretty good too\u2026The aftermath would definitely be very interesting.If she took the initiative to control and contact those puppets now, she would expose herself to a certain extent.However, Daoist Wen Jing felt a slight excitement and decided to take a small risk.\u2026Near the Heaven-Breaking Peak of the Immortal Du Sect, where the thousands of Immortals were fighting, a trace of Dao runes descended and landed on a human Heaven Immortal Blood Mosquito puppet.The Dao runes were then quickly extracted.The old Daoist priest from the Heaven Immortal realm trembled and retreated from the battle. He summoned a demonic roc that was of the Perfected Immortal realm and laid on the back of the demonic roc.In order to complete the orders that his \u2018master\u2019 had just given him, the old Daoist priest, the Heaven Immortal, ordered the demonic roc to head north first. Once they flew far enough, they would turn east\u2026Rocs were good at flying. The demonic rocs also had the bloodline of a Golden Immortal roc and had innate abilities.At that moment, the demon roc was charging forward at full speed before disappearing without a trace\u2026A few Heaven Immortal Elders from the Immortal Du Sect noticed that. They guessed that the old Heaven Immortal Daoist and his demonic roc might be going to the east to cause trouble.They secretly transmitted their voices, feeling extremely anxious.However, at that moment, they were trapped near Heaven-Breaking Peak. Putting aside whether or not they could break out of the encirclement and rush to the east to rescue them, they could not catch up with the demonic roc\u2019s speed!After one of the Grand Elders left the battle, he took out a few messenger jade talismans and hurriedly contacted the elders who were in charge of the external affairs, and were already 8,000 kilometers to the east, to get them to bring their disciples to hide.That was all they could do\u2026The elders of the Immortal Du Sect had misjudged two things.Firstly, they did not expect the other party to be so ruthless.The battle had yet to end and they were already going to find trouble with those disciples who had yet to become immortals!Secondly\u2026The earth meridians were deep in the ground. How did the other party discover that they had hidden the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array?However, the minor details that the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s Elders had missed out\u2026 were long predicted by a disciple.Daoist Wen had given Li Changshou a vicious impression. Li Changshou\u2019s vigilance had been raised from the beginning\u2026The moment the Daoist priest of the Heaven Immortal realm and the demonic roc moved, Li Changshou captured their movements.Although he felt that trouble was about to entail, he did not feel nervous.It was definitely not because Li Changshou did not care much about his junior and master. Instead, he had already come up with a plan to deal with them. He could manage even if there were ten Heaven Immortals\u2026Ahem, that\u2019s a bit too many.Even if there were three to four Heaven Immortals, it would not be a big deal!It\u2019s about time\u2026Begin the second wave of battle!At that moment, Li Changshou had to focus a portion of his attention on the Paper Effigy No. 3 beside Ling\u2019e and start preparing for the battle.He could only get Paper Effigy No. 2 to hide underground while the other three paper effigies appeared in the river valley outside the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026This time, he did not release the paper effigies.The three figures that the paper effigies had transformed into flew into the sky!Two men and one woman appeared on both sides. They took the initiative to expose their cultivation levels, which were all in the late-stage of the Perfected Immortal realm!That was the highest realm that Li Changshou could simulate at the moment\u2014the paper effigy only carried immortal power, and there was a limit to the amount that he could store.Then, the three figures activated their immortal powers and shouted loudly!They first looked to the north.The young Daoist priest with a sword on his back shouted, \u201cWhen we passed by this place, we saw a group of demons attacking the mountain!\u201d\u201cHow arrogant! \u201cFellow Daoist of the Immortal Du Sect, the two of us will help you!\u201dHe was full of righteousness!Following that, the female immortal holding a jade flute beside him said in a clear voice, \u201cThe world is bright and clear. Slay the demons and protect the humans!\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist of the Immortal Du Sect, please don\u2019t worry about the two of us. We will not attack by force. We will first lure away some demons for you!\u201dThose words were very reasonable, making the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect calm down immediately. They were very grateful for those two strangers who had \u201caccidentally passed by\u201d.Although many immortals felt that\u2026 there was something strange about their appearance\u2026Compared to the two paper effigies in the north, the burly man in the south was much more uncouth and straightforward.The paper effigy carried a huge ax and was five kilometers away from the battle arena.He shouted, \u201cDamn it! That group of demons and ghouls! If you have what it takes, fight me head-on! I\u2019m going to kill you and your ancestors!\u201dImmediately, the Blood Mosquito puppets surrounding the Heaven-Breaking Peak reacted!In the north, more than ten black shadows charged towards the couple.The paper effigy with the sword on his back laughed out loud. The two of them quickly retreated and executed a few spell techniques formed using immortal power. They advanced forward in a similar manner.The ones on the southern side\u2026 were powerful\u2026More than twenty demons turned around and charged towards the burly man. At the front, there were two demons of the Heaven Immortal realm!The burly paper effigy\u2019s legs trembled. He lifted the huge ax and turned to fly away. However, he secretly executed Wind Escape and charged towards the Little Qiong Peak.In order to attract the attention of those people, Li Changshou used the paper effigy to curse his heart out.The burly man kept cursing and swearing. The more popular curses in the Primordial World were endless\u2026Examples would be \u2018I don\u2019t treat you as a son of a human\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t care if you are a demon or not.\u2019 Those were still considered quite amateur.Li Changshou quickly decided to add more ingredients and started to shout a few more exciting words. Even though those demons were being controlled, they were still furious.For example, the demons exploded into excitement when they heard what the humans in the Primordial World already knew\u2026\u201cThere are two Demon Emperors, but there is only one Demon Empress!\u201d\u201cYour ancestors were beaten so badly by the witches that they did not even dare to land on the ground. They even shamelessly claimed that they had separated from the world of the witches! Have you got any shame? Have you?\u201dStreams of light shot out. The demons attacked one after another, wanting to tear the burly man to pieces.However, the burly man\u2019s immortal power erupted from his body and he retreated at high speed. Li Changshou merged his Wind Escape technique and dodged left and right in the air. He continued cursing.Unknowingly, the burly paper effigy rushed to the sky above Little Qiong Peak, and a stream of light flew over from behind him.Li Changshou controlled the paper effigy. His back was filled with immortal power, and he was deliberately hit by the pearl in the stream of light\u2026The burly man\u2019s body was knocked down, and he fell towards Little Qiong Peak. He barely managed to stabilize himself in mid-air and turned to look at the group of demons that were flying towards him.However, at that moment, the group of demons also sensed a hint of danger. There were a few human-shaped demons, and their eyes were filled with hesitation.In the darkness, Li Changshou snorted coldly.The burly, paper effigy turned around and stood on the edge of the array formation on the Little Qiong Peak. He made a thumbs-up gesture at the group of demons and then curled his finger in disdain.\u201cI\u2019ve already fled for such a long time. So that\u2019s all you can do. It\u2019s not painful!\u201d\u201cCome on, take me one on one!\u201dThe demons were stunned for a moment before they pounced onto the burly man below.The Blood Mosquitoes were secretly influencing him. Naturally, they were all going against him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their numb faces twitched.The wretched human qi-trainers, who should have been sliced into pieces, had actually lured them into a maze!He could still see their figures just now, but now, they were nowhere to be seen.At the front, the old demon who was in the Heaven Immortal realm squinted his narrow eyes and casually smashed the wooden tablet in front of him.\u201cCome out!\u201dA female demon shouted. There was no reaction from the surroundings.The demonic energy in the old demon who shattered the wooden tablet surged. Rays of light-yellow streams of light erupted around him.A strong gust of wind blew over, instantly dispersing the array formation.The surroundings suddenly became clear. Their immortal senses that had been blocked earlier could immediately detect everything in the surroundings\u2026Almost at the same time, the demons saw a burly human drinking water leisurely under a tree in the distance\u2026It seemed that\u2026 he had gotten thirsty after scolding them.The demons were instantly enraged!Even the Blood Mosquito\u2019s mental control was almost broken by the exasperation!1The burly man seemed to have reacted a little slower. When he heard the rumbling sounds and looked up, he shivered and looked anxious.\u201cYou little demons! You actually found me!\u201dWith that, he carried the huge ax and ran back.The fire was almost pouring out of the demons\u2019 eyes. They threw their Dharma treasures and divine powers in front of them and fiercely took chase!Demonic power erupted from their bodies, and they looked ferocious.The two old demons at the front were in the Heaven Immortal realm!The female demon on the left was plump, and a piercing green light erupted from her body. Her white arms turned into a pair of green wings.She spread her wings and stood on one leg. Two hundred kilograms of green feathers flew forwards in front of her!The old demon, who had just broken through the maze, had a cunning-looking, black-furred deer head. With a casual sweep, black sand surged out from his body, forming pitch-black swords that shot towards the back of the burly man!However, just as the burly man took a few steps forward, he suddenly roared and pounced forward. His entire body strangely disappeared\u2026The green feathers, black swords, and the dozens of rays of light behind them disappeared at the same time. They were nowhere to be found!Array formation!Traces that resembled water ripples suddenly appeared all over the forest. The demons reacted quickly and immediately rushed to the sky.However, as soon as they left the ground, their vision blurred. They rushed into the starry sky at the same time. In an instant, the world spun and they lost their direction. They did not know where to go!Before they could do anything, they were filled with shining stars!The Blood Mosquito puppets were puzzled as well.We have clearly just encountered an ordinary and basic array formation, but why did it suddenly appear in this form after we took a few steps forward? It became a high-level array formation that even the old Heaven Immortal demon could not see through!Why would this inconspicuous peak have such a mysterious array?Behind the stars, there seemed to be pairs of eyes watching them\u2026It was as if a group of demon-eating ogres was hiding in the starlight. At the same time, hundreds of strong, murderous, and emotionless witches were brewing their murderous aura!Two Perfected Immortal realm demons looked at each other after which they immediately looked left and right.However, just as they took two steps forward and ended up at a spot that was only four feet away from their original position, two inconspicuous stars flashed gently, and two rays of light that reflected off the blade appeared strangely in front of their necks\u2026At the next moment, two heads were tossed up into the sky and the demons\u2019 blood splattered everywhere!Another bolt of lightning struck, and the Demonic essence soul in the two corpses instantly shattered!What made the demons even more terrified was that the two corpses had transformed into half-human and half-demon forms. However, the demonic powers in the corpses were instantly sucked out by the array formation!Those demons did not dare to move anymore\u2026The two Heaven Immortal realm demons immediately attacked. They bombarded the surrounding starry sky and unleashed their demonic powers in a frenzy. However, their attacks did not bring about any response at all\u2026However, if they did not move, the killing array formations would not be able to be activated for the time being. That did not mean that they would be safe for the time being.Wisps of colorless and odorless poisonous powder drifted under the starlight and found every great demon.In an instant, a few demons with lower cultivation levels rolled their eyes and fainted.One after another, the demons fainted immediately. The two Heaven Immortals only lasted for two more breaths before roaring in indignation and slowly collapsing\u2026Outside the array formation, Li Changshou was sitting on a branch of a big tree, while stowing away the porcelain bottles.The thirty-six array foundations in Little Qiong Peak slowly converged their spiritual power.The killing array, called the \u2018Thousand Battles of Stars\u2019, had returned to a state of standby.Compared to the poisonous pills, Li Changshou was more concerned about the consumption of spiritual energy in the array foundation. After all, the killing array at the Little Qiong Peak had to be used back and forth on that day.When the array formation closed, layers of ripples appeared in the air.Strange-looking demon corpses appeared out of thin air. They fell from the sky and formed a pile.Most of them appeared to be half-human and half-demon. At that moment, their souls had been corroded by the second wave of poison\u2026Li Changshou mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s better to release the poison personally so that I won\u2019t waste the poisonous properties.\u201dThree paper dolls jumped out of the paper effigy\u2019 sleeve and transformed into three sullen-faced old Daoists. They charged forward skillfully\u2026Due to the fact that there were too many paper effigies that he had to control at the same time, the battle situation was pressing. The next batch of \u201ccustomers\u201d were being lured over. The follow-up could only be simple.The paper dolls poured out three bottles of Bone Erosion Divine Water and threw out two Soul-Bewitching Pearls\u2026Li Changshou \u201cpersonally\u201d threw out two shots of True Samadhi Flames. The demon corpses, which had lost most of their defensive power, were instantly engulfed by the True Samadhi Flames.In order to protect the Little Qiong Peak\u2019s environment, the three paper dolls carefully controlled the range of the True Samadhi Flames and began to recite sutras.All of a sudden, the sound of mosquitoes appeared in the forest.Li Changshou was already prepared. Tiny electric arcs immediately appeared around the paper effigies!1However, before the Blood Mosquito could get close to Li Changshou, a long tongue stuck out from a nearby tree branch. It caught the Blood Mosquito accurately and pulled it aside.Croak\u2026The Jade Frog, that was lying on the tree branch, called out to Li Changshou softly as if it was asking for credit.All over the forest, the sounds of frogs croaking could be heard\u2026Li Changshou felt that it was a pity. He had originally wanted to test if the \u2018Lightning Mosquito Web\u2019 had any effect.You\u2019re even asking for credit eh\u2026I\u2019ll fry you after the fight!1Li Changshou turned around and jumped off the tree branch. He then added another shot of True Flames.After a while, the corpses were burned to ashes. With a hard slap of his hand, the ashes scattered everywhere.It felt comfortable\u2026\u201cI earned some merit again.\u201dIt\u2019s good even though compared to the incense offerings he had accumulated by \u201caccidentally\u201d, that amount of karma-repelling merit is considered very small\u2026The three sullen-faced old Daoists quickly cleaned up the battlefield, returned to their paper doll forms, and jumped back into the sleeves of the burly paper effigy.Li Changshou looked at the destroyed forest in front of him and felt a little regretful.Many of the trees were planted after he went up the mountain\u2026Forget it. In order to protect the sect, making some sacrifices is inevitable.If the Immortal Du Sect can make it through this time, I\u2019ll secretly go to other peaks and steal some spirit wood and roots after the battle. I\u2019ll just treat it as a reward from the sect\u2026He chuckled and ran to the outer boundary of the maze. Then, he hung a new wooden sign that read \u201cAre you lost?\u201dThen, the burly man patted his face and sprayed some blood belonging to the spiritual beasts, onto his body.He ripped off his clothes and shook his long hair. His aura became chaotic and it was as if he was seriously injured. He was strong on the outside but weak on the inside\u20261He returned to his usual arrogant and domineering self. Carrying his huge ax, he jumped into the air and rushed towards the Heaven-Splitting Peak while continuing to yell.\u201cAhahaha!\u201d\u201cYou brats! Your grandfather, I, am back again!\u201d\u201cIf you have what it takes, fight me head-on!\u201d\u201cThose useless things have all been destroyed by my Dharma treasures! Hahahaha!\u201dOn the Little Qiong Peak, the outer array formation that had been blown apart earlier was recovering on its own.The array foundations that were hidden deep inside emitted light once again. With the help of the deeper array formations, they slowly returned to their correct positions.The real Chain Array formation was not as simple as just adding one link to another.Under the outer layer of the array, there was a deep layer of array formations that could maintain and repair the outer layer.Not long after the burly paper effigy left, the entire forest was just like before. From the outside, it looked exactly the same as before\u2026However, it was inevitable that some parts of it were affected by the mystical abilities, leaving some traces behind.After a while, another two figures rushed to the Little Qiong Peak from another direction. Of course, they were the other two paper effigies who were luring the enemy.The same scene took place again.The female paper effigy deliberately let herself get hit by the Dharma treasure that flew behind her and fell downwards.The paper effigy carrying the sword hurriedly took flight while the dozen or so figures behind him immediately chased after him.At the edge of the array formation, a few people sensed danger and stopped in their tracks.However, the male effigy\u2019s actions quickly attracted their attention\u2026The male paper effigy pushed his \u201cjunior\u201d into the forest, turned around, and faced his enemies. He gripped the hilt of his sword with his right hand.\u201cDon\u2019t force me to draw my sword!\u201dThe group of pursuers could not hold themselves back. One of them took the lead and moved together.\u2026In a narrow and dark corner, Li Changshou felt that if someone saw his expression, they might think that he was crazy.He would occasionally look serious and righteous.Occasionally, he would smile and curse.Occasionally, he would smile coldly, his eyes filled with contempt.In terms of acting chops\u2026Actually, it was because Li Changshou had to be careful of every single detail such as the aura and expression of every paper effigy\u2026The three paper cultivators took turns to lure the enemies around the Heaven-Breaking Peak. The Little Qiong Peak\u2019s array formation played a crucial role. It kept the enemies within the array formation, preventing them from looking outside. They would then be destroyed by killing arrays and poisonous pills.Although his main body was no longer in the Immortal Du Sect, Li Changshou was doing his best.So far, not considering the result of the sneak attack launched together with Elder Wan Linyun, more than one-third of the enemy\u2019s combat strength had been destroyed by Li Changshou through the Poison Array, Poison Arrows, self-detonating paper dolls and the paper effigies that lured the enemies. That helped to relieve the immense pressure on the Immortal Du Sect!In fact, he had even become the factor that changed the outcome!There was no such thing as a balance in the Primordial World\u2026Although the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect had made guesses, no one knew anything about the troops that were giving aid, other than Elder Wan Linyun.At the same time, Li Changshou had to focus his attention on his junior.An old Daoist in the Heaven Immortal realm and a demonic roc in the Perfected Immortal realm were heading towards the east to attack the disciples of the Immortal Du Sect who had previously used the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array to escape.That piece of news was also relayed by the Grand Elder to the elders in charge of the external affairs, who were protecting the disciples.However, there were more than a thousand disciples there. How could they move safely?At that moment, everyone in the valley, which was originally as beautiful as a painting, was in a state of panic. Many disciples looked terrified.To them, it was definitely not good news for a Heaven Immortal to be chasing them.Hence\u2026Youqin Xuanya stood up again!\u201cElders, I am willing to lure away powerful enemies!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dA Perfected Immortal who was in charge of the external affairs shouted, \u201cHow can we stay safe and let our young disciples risk their lives outside!?!\u201d\u201cElder Tian, you and I will fight that evil thief!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Another elder stood up. The two of them immediately rose into the sky.At that moment, a slightly uneasy voice came from the crowd. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we use the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array to send two Heaven Immortal realm experts to the sect?\u201dEveryone turned to look at the voice. It was Ling\u2019e.Many people were enlightened. What Ling\u2019e suggested was indeed a good idea.However, a small number of disciples revealed a bitter smile.The people smiling bitterly were the last batch of disciples to use the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array.Actually, there should have been hundreds of people from the Essence Immortal realm who had teleported over together. However, those people who had already become immortals chose to stay in the sect at the last minute\u2026In order to prevent the disciples\u2019 whereabouts from being exposed, the Essence Immortals destroyed the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array, cutting off their own escape routes.After the few of them explained in a low voice, the disciples became excited!\u201cWe\u2019ll just fight with them here!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cMy teacher is still fighting and killing enemies in the sect. We can\u2019t die in vain!\u201d\u201cAt most, my soul will be destroyed. In any case, I feel that I won\u2019t be able to overcome the Heavenly Tribulation!\u201dLi Changshou frowned secretly. This situation was extremely disadvantageous for him.Fortunately, Youqin Xuanya was there.Li Changshou pulled his junior and whispered a few words into her ear. The two of them walked towards Youqin Xuanya.The following plan was to make use of Youqin Xuanya\u2019s status and prestige\u2026He was really not a tool.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ling\u2019e and Youqin Xuanya kept whispering to each other, but Li Changshou simply nodded or shook his head.In reality, it was Li Changshou who was secretly transmitting the message and handing a porcelain bottle to Youqin Xuanya without leaving any clues\u2026\u201cSenior Brother Changshou why don\u2019t you come forward to do it?\u201dYouqin Xuanya used her voice transmission technique and continued, \u201cI know that you don\u2019t want to be implicated and involved with these formalities but, Senior, the reputation that you deserve should be given to you.\u201d\u201cLi Changshou\u201d smiled and said, \u201cJunior Sister Youqin, if you can see and hear what I have, you will not ask me this question.\u201dYouqin Xuanya was stunned.She looked at Li Changshou who always had a gentle smile on his face and nodded.She seemed to have understood something.Although Li Changshou did not understand what she understood\u2026 he felt that she should have understood something\u2026Li Changshou felt that he had gradually grasped some tricks that he could use to deal with his Junior Sister Youqin.Many disciples in the surroundings saw that scene, but they did not know what the three of them were mumbling about.\u201cWho is that fellow disciple?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Junior Sister Ling\u2019e\u2019s senior brother fight the Qi Refinement cultivators of Golden Ao Island and the prince of the Dragon Palace before?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Wolf Fang Club! How could I have forgotten about him? My memory is bad.\u201dLi Changshou transmitted his voice, \u201cJunior Sister Youqin, there\u2019s no time to waste. The other party might find this place immediately.\u201dYouqin Xuanya nodded gently. She carried her sword and flew into the sky, looking at the chaotic crowd below.Youqin Xuanya shouted, \u201cEveryone, time is running out. Listen to me! I have a way to make strong enemies retreat.\u201d\u201cThe enemy has the demonic roc as a mode of transport and they\u2019re after the earth meridians. It\u2019s impossible to escape from this place after they find the earth meridians!\u201dThe disciples below looked up.Fortunately, Youqin Xuanya was stepping on a white cloud that no one could see through\u20261She took out a porcelain bottle and shouted, \u201cEveryone, please take a look. This is a peerless poisonous pill bestowed by Elder Wan Linyun that can kill Heaven Immortals!\u201d\u201cLater, I will attack together with my senior brothers and sisters. I will use this poisonous pill to set up an array formation. I will use this to see if I can seriously injure this enemy! Everyone, please return to your caves and wait near the earth meridians.\u201d\u201cElders, please listen to me! If Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters and I cannot succeed, all the elders will have to fight with their lives to protect the disciples!\u201dYouqin Xuanya\u2019s words were full of emotions.Even if Li Changshou had not arranged for the next battle plan, he would still be 99% certain that he could destroy the enemies because, during the battle at the mountain gate, he had already figured out the strength of the old Daoist who was in the Heaven Immortal realm.Li Changshou himself was almost moved by Youqin Xuanya\u2019s words\u2026At the same time, the one-tenth chance of losing was something that could not be erased as usual.The Heavenly Dao was random.He had to respect the Heavenly Dao!The elders stood up immediately, wanting to use the poisonous pill in Youqin Xuanya\u2019s place.Elder Tian said, \u201cXuanya, a Heaven Immortal is not to be trifled with\u2026\u201d\u201cElder!\u201d Youqin Xuanya\u2019s eyes seemed to be shining as she continued firmly, \u201cPlease trust me!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cXuanya, Elder Tian and I will stay here. You will also assist us here. What do you think?\u201dThe other Perfected Immortal elder who was in charge of external affairs added, \u201cThen, the two of us guard disciples will set up another array formation in the cave and use it as an ambush.\u201dYouqin Xuanya thought for a while and immediately agreed after hearing Li Changshou\u2019s voice transmission.The elders called out to the disciples who had just flown out of the ground, and they immediately flew towards the cave deep in the valley\u2026The disciples who had yet to become immortals were really in a sorry state.In a corner, Ling\u2019e muttered softly, \u201cThat works too?\u201dLi Changshou\u2019s paper avatar stood with his hands behind his back and said, \u201cSome people and some things cannot be understood using common sense.\u201dLing\u2019e seemed to be deep in thought. She looked up at her senior brother and asked softly, \u201cWhat about you, Senior Brother?\u201d\u201cBe more serious. There are still many troublesome matters to deal with next.\u201dLi Changshou transmitted his voice and retreated half a step to the side, avoiding the cave.\u201cLing\u2019e, you must follow me later. Don\u2019t wander around.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLing\u2019e reached her slender hand out and carefully pulled the back of Li Changshou\u2019s robe. Although she was in danger, she could not help but blush a little.Li Changshou transmitted his voice calmly, \u201cLet\u2019s set three rules.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Ling\u2019e took half a step to the side and remained standing with her hands behind her back as if she was not very familiar with Li Changshou.At this moment, no one paid much attention to a pretty female disciple like her who didn\u2019t have a high cultivation level.Many disciples went to Youqin Xuanya and said that they wanted to stay behind to fight against the enemy.However, Youqin Xuanya thought about Li Changshou\u2019s previous warnings and continuously refused. In the end, she used the excuse that the disciples of the Little Qiong Peak were good at using the Earth Escape technique and left Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e behind.Not long after, the elders worked together and quickly set up a concealment array at the entrance of the cave.At the same time, it prevented the people in the underground cave from investigating\u2026The powerful enemy might arrive at any time. At this moment, they should be searching along the earth meridians and wasting some time.Or do they have other plans? I have to be wary of that.Li Changshou pondered deeply. He glanced at Ling\u2019e and continued to guide Youqin Xuanya secretly.Since he had chosen to let Youqin Xuanya be a tool for once, he would use her to the greatest extent\u2026Later on, he would put in more effort to ensure that she did not expose all that.The two Perfected Immortal elders who were in charge of external affairs brought their three disciples along with them as they flew out of the valley. They purposely revealed their auras on the side of the valley.That was to attract the attention of powerful enemies\u2026At that moment, an elder turned to look at Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e. He wanted to tell them to be careful, but he could only sigh softly.\u201cThe two of you are good at using Earth Escape. If anything goes wrong, you should protect yourselves!\u201dLi Changshou and Ling\u2019e looked at each other and nodded.Soon, two trapping arrays and protective arrays were erected on the hillside.The two elders who were Perfected Immortals grabbed the poisonous pill and checked it carefully.It was indeed a pill refined by Elder Wan Linyun. When the two of them probed the poison pill, they felt their spiritual senses pulsating. They knew that it was an impressive item.It was actually the incapacitating agent\u2014Heart-bewitching Intoxication.Hence, the two elders looked less worried and were more determined. There was hope\u2026While they were setting up the array, Li Changshou hid behind a huge rock with Ling\u2019e. His mind was focused on the intense battle at the mountain gate.\u2026The second time the burly paper effigy appeared, the effect was not ideal.The Blood Mosquito puppets had already reacted. They did not immediately send people to chase after them. Instead, they attacked the Heaven-Breaking Peak with all their might.After all, the previous batch of \u201cfellow Daoists\u201d had been silently destroyed on a mountain peak.It was obvious that there was something fishy about that.Most of the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect felt that that burly man must have gone through a bloody battle to be able to kill so many great demons. It was truly admirable.The burly man continued to curse. However, the only responses he received were mystical abilities and Dharma treasures. He was unable to lure the enemy.Forget it.It would be a coincidence to lure too many enemies to the Little Qiong Peak once or twice but if it\u2019s too frequent, it would be hard to explain\u2026The battle on the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s main peak had already stabilized. The Blood Mosquito puppets have lost their spirit.Although the Immortal Du Sect had been suppressed at this moment, the rate at which the casualties increased was extremely slow. The effects of Elder Wan Linyun, Exalted Wang Qing, and other experts had also become more prominent.However, the situation was not entirely stable.Now, he had to wait for the Golden Immortals above him to decide the winner. That was the most important part.If one of the Sect Leaders of the Immortal Du Sect or Elder Qi Ling had lost before the experts from the Ren School arrived, the Immortal Du Sect would still lose\u2026How can I help a battle between Golden Immortals?This thought popped up in Li Changshou\u2019s mind. Then, he frowned and began to check himself.Have I been too careless?This is clearly beyond my current ability. It is not something that I have to do no matter what.Could it be that I\u2019ve been struck with something like a tribulation?Otherwise, how could I have such ridiculous thoughts?Li Changshou did not think too much about it. After sorting out his thoughts, he continued to follow his plan.A moment later\u2026The Paper Effigy No. 3 beside Ling\u2019e had already sensed the demonic aura of the demonic roc. Although the other party had taken a detour, he still successfully chased after her.At that moment, Li Changshou immediately controlled the three paper effigies in the mountain gate. The burly man and his fellow disciples took the initiative to attack the Mosquito Puppet\u2019s main array.The three \u201cpeople\u201d quickly fell into a difficult situation and were unable to recover.However, they were unyielding and had nothing to lose. In the end, they rushed to the place where the other demons were at, and instantly self-destructed!The immortals from the Immortal Du Sect shouted, \u201cFellow Daoist, you can\u2019t do that!\u201d Many old immortals, who had been in seclusion all year round, looked up and sighed.However\u2026Both parties felt that they had seen that scene before\u2026Li Changshou felt his heart ache as well.After all, those three paper effigies were of the highest quality and standards he could achieve for now. They also cost the most amount of paper.However, there was nothing he could do. The three paper effigies had already played their role and had been tainted by karma.That was especially so for the burly man. When he scolded the demon race, he felt good. However, in the future, it would not be easy for him to deal with some big shots that were related to the demons, such as Daoist Lu Ya.However, he was gone after the explosion.That burly man was the one who scolded the Demon Emperor. What did it have to do with Li Changshou, the weak junior immortal of Little Qiong Peak?1Li Changshou secretly looked at the anti-depreciating objects on him and did not think about it further.In fact, the demons had long retreated from the stage of the Primordial world. In order to deal with the witches, the Demon Emperor had slaughtered many humans and used the souls of humans to refine incredible treasures. When the human race was almost extinct, he formed a huge feud that would not cease until he died.Fortunately, Saint Nuwa and the experts from the Dao Sect, who had long become enemies with the Demon Emperor, had protected the human bloodline.As a human, it would not be considered rude for him to jump around the Demon Emperor\u2019s grave, not to mention teasing him lightly.That was indeed the case.At the end of ancient times, after the third Great Magi-Demon War, the demons suffered great losses. The human race seized the opportunity to defeat the demon race. At that time, there was a human leader who ordered people to dance and play music in front of the fallen Demon Court for decades to celebrate.The prosperity of the human race was not obtained just by paying respects to Heaven and Earth and the Three Sects.It was obvious how difficult it was to achieve great things with just one sentence.However, when people talked about the past, they would often say that the witches and demons were not counted as part of the heavens, thus highlighting the rise of the human race.Li Changshou was deeply touched by that battle\u2026There was a mastermind who wanted to plot against the Immortal Du Sect and yet, so many Perfected Immortals and Heaven Immortals died\u2026(A disguise to avoid karma, and a trump card to sever karma. Both are of equal importance.)In the future, he could not say that the problem was whether he was going to hide or not.Instead\u2026How deep could he hide?At this moment, the \u2018Heaven\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 2 was hiding under the Heaven-Breaking Peak.The one with the \u2018Heaven Break\u2019 characters transformed into his master, Qi Yuan, and sat quietly in the Pill Chamber while secretly controlling Little Qiong Peak\u2019s array formation.Li Changshou focused most of his attention on Paper Effigy No. 3 which protected his junior and master. He was prepared to kill the Heaven Immortal old Daoist, who was going to attack him later and protect the \u201coffspring\u201d of the Immortal Du Sect.There was no need for Li Changshou to attack, given the current battle situation around the Heaven-Breaking Peak.It had not been long since the battle started, but Li Changshou knew that he had done enough.Everything was better than nothing.At that moment, most of the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect felt guilty and grateful towards the three paper effigies that were passionate about Dao and had self-destructed\u2026That was enough.Of course, Li Changshou would not have expected that there was already a Grand Elder who wanted to set up a monument for the three paper effigies afterward. That was a rather absurd matter.The Immortal Du Sect was 8,000 kilometers to the east. The Azure demonic roc flew through the air and circled in the air for a while. Two immortal senses were locked onto the few people below.Li Changshou transmitted his voice to Ling\u2019e, \u201cStay closer to me. You can use me as a shield.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLing\u2019e blinked and quickly hid behind \u201cLi Changshou\u201d who protected her completely.Youqin Xuanya and the two elders who were in charge of external affairs were ready to attack at any moment.Underground, Ling\u2019e was rather puzzled. She asked softly while blushing, \u201cSenior Brother, why are you\u2026\u201d\u201cWatch more. Talk less. Study hard.\u201dLing\u2019e immediately nodded and agreed. She was also a little nervous.Several streams of light suddenly came crashing down from above. The two elders joined forces and activated the array formation around them, barely managing to receive the light.Then, the demonic roc folded its wings and swooped down from the sky. It was extremely fast!However, the figure on the demonic roc\u2019s stopped in the air.The Heaven Immortal, who was controlled by the Blood Mosquito\u2019s mystical abilities, had a deep impression of the \u201ctoxic\u201d Immortal Du Sect\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The five people below had different reactions.The immortal powers of the two Perfected Immortal elders surged. As they strengthened the array formation, they were prepared to fight with all their might.Youqin Xuanya immediately rushed to Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e\u2019s side. The sword on her back was unsheathed and protected the three of them.As for Ling\u2019e and Li Changshou\u2026There were some ripples under their feet that looked like water. Half an inch of their legs had already sunk into the ground, and they were prepared to\u2026 use Earth Escape to flee anytime\u2026ScreechThe demonic roc was still thousands of feet in the sky when it suddenly shouted. It spread its wings, and dozens of long nails flew out from its wings that were dozens of feet long and towards the array formation below!Li Changshou immediately told Youqin Xuanya to keep the situation stable. Yougin Xuanya held the porcelain bottle in her left hand, which would decide their fates. She raised her right hand and pointed her sword in front of her. Her simple tresses danced gently as she looked up at the demonic roc.She could sense that after that demonic roc, there would be an even more terrifying existence\u2026Even though she was only at the Dao Requital realm and had yet to become an immortal, there was no fear in Youqin Xuanya\u2019s gaze.She had no choice but to take a gamble!Ling\u2019e looked at Li Changshou, her eyes filled with admiration, as if she were saying, \u201cSenior Sister Youqin is so suave.\u201d\u201cLi Changshou\u201d smiled calmly and did not reply. His gaze landed on the Heaven Immortal in the sky\u2026That fellow was surprisingly difficult to deal with.As the long spikes landed on the ground, the two Perfected Immortals attacked together. The array formation\u2019s light wall started to tremble. It was on the verge of breaking.After all, it was a temporary defensive array.The demonic roc realized that it had already tested the strength of the array formation below, and hence let out a cold laugh\u2026It raised its head and looked at the old Daoist priest in the sky. It lowered its head and dashed down once again!Li Changshou\u2019s voice entered Youqin Xuanya\u2019s ears at this moment.\u201cJunior Sister, get ready.\u201dYouqin Xuanya was shocked and focused on observing the situation.When the demonic roc rushed over, she shouted softly, \u201cElder, please retreat!\u201dThe two elders who were Perfected Immortals retracted their immortal powers at the same time. The array formation\u2019s light wall above them disappeared instantly!There were no obstacles in front of the demonic roc . It charged down ferociously, and with its surging demonic power, it attacked the two elders who were in charge of external affairs and were already injured!At that moment, the two elders had broken out into cold sweat\u2026At that moment, Youqin Xuanya was still very calm. Facing the strong pressure of a demon in the Perfected Immortal realm, she found an opportunity to pull open the cork and wrap the porcelain bottle with her Dharma powers\u2026In that situation, she did not tremble at all even though she was only a junior Daoist.When the demonic roc rushed towards the two Perfected Immortal elders, Youqin Xuanya hollered according to Li Changshou\u2019s instructions and then, she threw out the porcelain bottle in her hand!\u201cElder, retreat!\u201dThe two elders immediately dodged left and right. However, they simultaneously recalled something and turned their heads to look. In an instant\u2026The four old men\u2019s eyes widened, and their eyeballs almost popped out!The poisonous pill was meant to be stimulated using immortal power. It would then silently injure the enemy. It was not meant for smashing others like that!The \u2018s stared at Youqin Xuanya with a hint of contempt in its bird-like eyes. A wave of demonic power swept towards the porcelain bottle, in a bid to send the poisonous pill inside flying\u2026At this moment!Flames exploded behind the porcelain bottle. Youqin Xuanya\u2019s flying sword had already struck the porcelain bottle!The porcelain bottle exploded instantly, and the poisonous pill inside exploded as well. The poison was dispersed in all directions!The demonic power from the demonic roc had mysteriously disappeared\u2026 The two elders opened their mouths in shock\u2026 The demonic roc was still more than a hundred feet away from the ground. However, its body trembled and it fell to the ground. It knocked into the edge of the array formation and lay there motionlessly.Uh\u2026This works too?The two elders and even Youqin Xuanya were surprised.The three of them felt similar emotions.The poison pill that Elder Wan Linyun refined is indeed impressive!However, the actual situation was\u2026It was naturally impossible to throw the bottle to release the poison in it. Li Changshou had only done it secretly.In the blink of an eye, the demonic power released by the demonic roc had been transformed by the Paper Effigy No. 3 with the \u2018Human\u2019 character written on it.The poisonous pill exploded, and only weak poisonous properties spread. The thing that charmed the demonic roc was the drug that Li Changshou had secretly released.Li Changshou had made that arrangement for the sake of ;letting everyone remember that Youqin Xuanya had thrown out the poisonous pill that made everyone faint.The drug that he had secretly released was not only enough to take down the \u2026The two elders closest to the demonic roc immediately felt dizzy. Their bodies swayed as they slowly laid down.Elder Tian held his last breath of immortal power and looked at Youqin Xuanya. He could not help but smile bitterly. \u201cXuanya\u2026 you don\u2019t just throw poison like that\u2026\u201dWith a few clangs, Youqin Xuanya\u2019s flying sword fell from the sky. Before she could reply, she slowly closed her eyes. Her body was weak, and she fell from the sky\u2026wasLing\u2019e took two steps forward and quickly hugged her senior sister. She immediately used Earth Escape to hide.However, Ling\u2019e suddenly felt her vision turn dark. She hugged Youqin Xuanya and fell to the ground\u2026Senior Brother, you are indeed\u2026Ling\u2019e sighed softly in her heart. She fainted, but she was not worried.Li Changshou\u2019s body swayed as well. He held his head and groaned twice. Then, he slowly fell to the ground, right beside his junior. The demon, four people, and the paper effigy were swaying on the hillside.At first glance, there were indeed no flaws. It was just that youqin Xuanya did not know how to release poison and had been drugged by her own drug.However, the old Heaven Immortal Daoist in the sky sneered when he saw that.He actually\u2026 did not land directly.The old Daoist priest took out a huge seal and a pearl. He first raised the pearl and let it float above his head. It emitted a green light that enveloped him.Following that, the seal landed on the spot where they were.The huge seal expanded in the wind. In an instant, it became hundreds of feet wide, and the treasures around it flickered.With the aid of the Heaven Immortal realm\u2019s cultivation level, it seemed as if the entire valley was going to collapse!In a dark and narrow corner, Li Changshou\u2019s lips twitched.This old Daoist priest was clearly in the Heaven Immortal realm. Furthermore, the five people below had already been drugged by them. Yet, they still refused to come down and instead used their Dharma treasures to injure the enemy from afar\u2026Li Changshou sighed.I actually met someone from the same sect. Ahem, I actually met such a difficult opponent!Fortunately, I had made sufficient preparations.When he saw the huge seal rapidly crashing down, it brought about various airwaves, stirring up the surging Primordial Energy. Although it was powerful, it was slightly pulsating.Li Changshou was not in a hurry. He took a glance at the Sensing Stone and looked at the cave entrance deep in the valley.His immortal sense enveloped a radius of three hundred kilometers, searching for any other dangers.The paper effigy who was lying on the ground was motionless.However, his sleeve, which was made of spirit beast hides, was opened silently. A few Jade Frogs jumped out and looked around curiously. Then, they waited by the side in boredom.At that moment, a skinny old Daoist priest emerged from the grass nearby.The old Daoist priest did not say a word. He took out a square \u201cchessboard\u201d and threw it into the air.Seventy-two \u2018Miniature Array Foundations\u2019 flew out from it.The array foundations were linked together, and spiritual energy flowed inside, forming a wall of light! The huge seal crashed down!However, the light wall only shook slightly. Not only did it firmly stop the seal, it even blocked it.This chessboard was not an ordinary array disc, nor was it a Dharma artifact.It was a solid step that Li Changshou had taken on the path to the miniaturization of the array formation\u2026One small step.However, the drawback of the miniaturization of the array formation was that the basic spiritual power of the array formation was insufficient.Although the array formation managed to block the seal\u2019s attack, it quickly dimmed and dissipated on its own. The array foundation\u2019s spiritual energy was exhausted and it returned to the chessboard on its own\u2026It was really a single-use protective array formation.Overall, the effect of the miniature array formation was not as good as a powerful defensive Dharma treasure, but it still bought enough time. The moment the array formation was activated, a few large hands emerged from the ground and dragged the unconscious elders, Ling\u2019e, and Youqin Xuanya undergroundEven the Elder of the Hundred Mortal Hall, who was quite familiar with Li Changshou, could not escape the fate of having his hair pulled out by the ruthless hands.There was no choice. Most of the Qi Refinement cultivators had long, flowing hair. That part of their bodies\u2026 was the most convenient to grab.Paper Effigy No. 3 was the only one left on the ground.As for who the old Daoist priest who appeared to save his life was\u2026Currently, Li Changshou had more than three types of paper effigies. There were actually five types in total.The types were Heaven, earth, human, god, and ghost.(God] Paper Effigy: One of Li Changshou\u2019s trump cards. It was specially used for high-end fights that involved magical powers. It was accompanied by Li Changshou\u2019s main body. Its quality was similar to that of the \u2018Heaven\u2019 paper effigy but it had many trump cards.The old Daoist priest who had suddenly appeared was the \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1.He stimulated the aura fluctuations of the late-stage Perfected Immortal realm and his immortal power surged. He faced the old Heaven Immortal Daoist above him.The old Heaven Immortal Daoist in the air focused his gaze.He held the Treasure Seal in his hand and a green pearl above his head. As his sleeves fluttered, he flew towards the old Daoist priest.The \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1 held a horsetail whisk Dharma treasure, but the silver silk from the horsetail whisk was smeared with the Heaven Immortal Poison\u2026The \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1\u2032 let out a low cry and flew into the sky. He mumbled something in his mouth, and blue lightning was brewing in his left palm.The two old Daoist masters were still thousands of feet away from each other. They directly sacrificed their treasures and cast their spells!Above him, the treasure seal was smashed horizontally. The old Heaven Immortal\u2019s eyes shone with a sanguine glow. A purple sword appeared in his hand, which emitted rays of divine light.The old Daoist priest below was wrapped in immortal power. His movements were elusive and difficult to capture. The divine light in his palm was released, and he was using the \u2018Heavenly Sun and Lightning\u2019!A huge battle broke out in the sky. Divine lightning shot out, treasures flew around, swords swayed, and old branches shook!The old Daoist priest of the Heaven Immortal realm soon discovered that although his opponent who had appeared out of nowhere had an aura of the Perfected Immortal realm, the power and quality of his spells and immortal powers seemed to be stronger than his own\u2026He was unable to take down the Perfected Immortal!The horsetail whisk released a few strands of silver silk, which were like silver needles, and they secretly pierced the old Heaven Immortal\u2019s neck.The pearl on the old Daoist priest\u2019s head trembled slightly. Wisps of green light scattered and melted the silver needle.Is that\u2026In the darkness, Li Changshou raised his eyebrows and sensed a familiar aura.This green pearl\u2026It\u2019s a poison-repelling pearl refined from the Red Yang Poisonous Dragon pearl! Good stuff\u2026With this treasure, the effects of my poison would be greatly reduced.However, Li Changshou was not in a hurry. His attention was focused on the \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1, and he was calculating the consumption of immortal power of the paper effigy.The horsetail whisk in the paper effigy\u2019s hand was like a brush as it wrote the golden words.Mystical abilities: Writes Sutras.In an instant, dozens of golden words flew around the lightning.The old Daoist priest from the Heaven Immortal realm felt a sense of pressure. When he was struck by the words, his immortal powers surged.However, after fighting for a while, the old Daoist priest was already slightly injured\u2026Although the \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1\u2019s immortal power had only been depleted by 20%, he had deliberately exposed a flaw. He was hit by the treasure seal and his entire body was trembling. His body fell into a forest below.The paper Daoist had immortal power to protect himself. To a certain extent, it could make up for the flaws in his defense. However, it would only consume more immortal power. In the sky, the bloodstained Puppet that was in the Heaven Immortal realm finally heaved a sigh of relief.The old Daoist priest who initially wanted to take advantage of the enemy\u2019s weakness, quickly chased after him.Although Li Changshou wanted to give it a try as well, to see if he could use the \u2018God\u2019 paper effigy, which had many trump cards, to challenge an ordinary mid-stage Heaven Immortal cultivator, fights involving magical power were not child\u2019s play.He had to end it fast.In the trunks of a few large trees in the forest, three figures, who had just arrived, slowly opened their eyes. The miniature array discs in their sleeves had been activated by immortal power\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had tried to deal the final blow, ignoring the possibility of killing his companion\u2019s demonic roc\u2026Unfortunately, the old Daoist priest still could not stabilize himself.If the old Daoist priest of the Heaven Immortal realm remained in the air and did not give Li Changshou a chance to attack him, Li Changshou might have been forced to reveal his true form and quickly kill that person.However, that person\u2026After being seduced for a while, he came down from the sky. He did not know the logic of refraining from entering every forest\u2019 and continued to chase after him\u2026The stability that he had been maintaining was destroyed in an instant.The stability that he had been maintaining for a long time, was gone because of a careless mistake.The Blood Mosquito Puppets of the Heaven Immortal realm were anxious but not careful enough.In the forest, the three paper effigies that were hiding in the tree trunk had been waiting quietly for a long time. They were prepared to attack at any time\u2026ereLi Changshou\u2019s mind raced as he controlled the four paper effigies at a close distance. One of them fled while the other three crouched and retreated.As he approached the ambush, the old Heaven Immortal seemed to sense danger. His eyes were filled with a hint of hesitation\u2026In front of him, the \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1, who was flying along the forest, spat out a mouthful of blood. His aura was even more chaotic as if he could not hold on any longer.The old Heaven Immortal quickly caught up to him and rushed to the edge of the ambush!However, Li Changshou did not panic. He decided to hold his ground and wait for the best opportunity.Not only could he wait for the right time, but he could also create it himself.Li Changshou preferred to be in control.The \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1 flew hundreds of feet forward. Suddenly, he turned around with a look of determination. He carried his horsetail whisk and rushed towards the old Heaven Immortal Daoist, looking like he was going to risk his life by going all out.The Heaven Immortal Daoist gave a cold smile as the Poison-Repelling Pearl above his head glistened.He took out his treasure seal, raised the sword which was a Numinous Treasure in his hand, and slashed out a sharp sword beam that was hundreds of feet long! In order to end the battle quickly, Li Changshou had already decided to make a small loss. He was going to sacrifice the paper effigy to kill the old Heaven Immortal Daoist.Using the \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy to exchange for the life of a Heaven Immortal is indeed a loss compared to using poison.\u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No.1\u2019s body moved horizontally, barely dodging the sword. However, he did not care about the seal that was coming from the sky.Seeing that the seal was about to hit his enemy, the old Heaven Immortal\u2019s lips curled into a cold smile. A dark green wave appeared around him\u2026An ambush!The old Daoist priest was slightly shocked. However, he could no longer react. He was caught by a blue wave!The old Daoist priest\u2019s essence soul was restrained by the array and his immortal body could not move at all.Trapping Array: Green Water CageThat was an opportunity that could not be missed!There was not much spirit energy in the miniature array foundation!A thousand feet away, another two Dharma artifact array discs were sent out of the tree trunk. The miniature array foundations on them immediately scattered. In the blink of an eye, they had formed a formation!The three arrays overlapped but did not interfere with each other!Small-scale killing arrays as such could only be used once in a short period of time. Every time it was used, it would require up to hundreds of meticulous adjustments. Li Changshou had used two of them\u2026A cold light flickered in the forest.Countless blades shot out and landed on the old Daoist priest!Another pool of pitch-black sludge appeared at the old Daoist priest\u2019s feet in a strange manner. The green jewel on his head shone brightly!The old Heaven Immortal Daoist\u2019s deadpan expression revealed a hint of anxiety. His entire body was filled with immortal energy, and he wanted to use it to resist the surrounding attacks\u2026However, the first killing array had seriously injured him.The old Daoist priest\u2019s immortal power barrier and the clothing on his body which were Immortal Treasures, could not last more than a breath\u2019s time before they were torn apart by the cold beams of light.At once, blood splattered everywhere.After the cold light burst out, the old Daoist priest\u2019s body was covered in wounds. He was barely breathing and was seriously injured\u2026All of a sudden, an obscure Dao rune surged out from between the old Daoist priest\u2019s eyebrows and rapidly spread throughout his body!The old Daoist priest\u2019s eyes turned cold and vicious.Li Changshou immediately caught that detail and was shocked.Daoist Wen!?!It should be her.However, he had considered that situation before\u2026Li Changshou did not panic at all. He continued following the steps of his plan. Three paper effigies emerged from the tree trunk. While the trapping array formation was still running, they quickly rushed towards the heavily injured Heaven Immortal Daoist.Even if you are a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal or a vicious person of the Primordial World, you\u2019d be in trouble as long as I kill this old Daoist that contains some of your spiritual will. You can\u2019t make bricks without straws.At that moment, deep underground.The red hairpin on Ling\u2019e\u2019s head flickered and glowed as if something inside was about to rush out\u2026The red hairpin was a simple Dharma treasure that Li Changshou had personally refined two months ago. After giving it to Ling\u2019e who was very fond of it, she was unwilling to take it off even when she slept.In the forest, at the point where the three array formations overlapped, the Dao runes on the old Heaven Immortal\u2019s body became more obvious. A sanguine glow that emitted a powerful pressure emerged from his body!However\u2026Crack!A blood-stained palm attacked from the side. The sanguine incantations on the palm shone brightly. It flew over the old Daoist priest\u2019s head and hit the Poison-Repelling Pearl!The Poison-Repelling Pearl was sent flying!Without the protection of the pearl, the black water below immediately unleashed its might and instantly melted the old Daoist priest\u2019s feet and legs\u2026Daoist Wen Jing, who was lying on the bed in the Aparagodaniya Continent, frowned slightly.Just as Li Changshou had expected, she was too far away and had only sent a wisp of spiritual will\u2026However, she actually\u2026 got defeated? Before Daoist Wen Jing could retract her spiritual will,The three figures with different faces and figures had already rushed to the old Daoist priest\u2019s side and stood in proper positions.They moved in unison. They raised their right hands and placed their sword fingers at their left wrist, before pushing their left palms forward!In each of their palms, there was a flame-like incantation pattern. The three runes were ignited at the same time.The True Samadhi Flames unleashed their full power. The old Daoist priest\u2019s severely injured body was immediately engulfed by the flames. He was instantly burned to the point of being disfigured! Li Changshou suddenly had a thought.The Daoist priest facing the old Daoist priest, who looked like a middle-aged Daoist priest, humphed coldly.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what demon you are. You will be executed by me today!\u201dThe immortal powers in the three paper Daoists turned into True Samadhi Flames and were darting towards the old Daoist.Due to Daoist Wen\u2019s spiritual will, Li Changshou could skip all the steps. The True Samadhi Flames had forcefully melted the essence soul and immortal body of the old Daoist who was in the Heaven Immortal realm, instantly vaporizing the blood. Finally, the Dao runes that frightened Li Changshou gradually disappeared\u2026In the darkness, Li Changshou took a deep breath. However, he did not dare to be careless. He immediately did what he had to do next.What he said just now was not a casual remark.When he said \u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of demon you are.\u201d he was hinting that he did not know who Daoist Wen was.He also deliberately said the word \u2018me\u2019, which was a trick.Li Changshou did not know if his words would work, but it was better than not doing anything.Li Changshou suddenly felt helpless as he looked at the ashes floating in the forest.This matter\u2026How many years had it been since I transcended the tribulation?I actually met Daoist Wen, the Primordial Beast, through the puppets and paper dolls.The Primordial World is indeed more dangerous than I had imagined\u2026Deep in the ground, the jade hairpin swayed gently. It was inserted more firmly in Lingle\u2019s black hair.Defeated\u2026I lost?!I, the queen, let my spiritual will descend and I couldn\u2019t do anything at all. Yet, I was burnt to ashes without doing anything!?!\u2018By me\u2019? Who could it be?In a Cave Abode near the spiritual mountain in the Aparagod\u0101n\u012bya Continent.Daoist Wen Jing, who was lying on the side of the bed, suddenly opened her eyes. She looked a little irritated and waved her hand.\u201cGet lost!\u201dThe two maids who were kneeling at the side did not dare to breathe. They hurriedly got up and retreated with their heads lowered.Daoist Wen Jing\u2019s dress fluttered as she immediately sat up cross-legged. Waves of emotions rose in her heart\u2026Who is that person?A moment ago, she was still admiring the chaotic battle in Immortal Du Sect.When Daoist Wen Jing realized that the puppets she had gathered were already very weak, she was naturally dissatisfied.The puppet that should have been suppressing the Immortal Du Sect had been destroyed for no reason.In fact, the scheme could only cause some casualties to the Immortal Du Sect. It could not shake their foundations\u2026Although she was unhappy, she did not care.After all, it was just a small scheme that did not require much effort.The main battle was about to end. Daoist Wen Jing no longer had the intention to continue watchingHer heart stirred. She wanted to see if the Heaven Immortals she had sent to kill the disciples of the Immortal Du Sect had completed their tasks.Therefore, Daoist Wen Jing shifted her attention to the old Daoist priest.Just as she looked over, she saw that the old Heaven Immortal was trapped in the array formation and was attacked by the killing array\u2026It was a huge tragedy!Why are the puppets I found so useless!?!In a fit of anger, Daoist Wen Jing decided to control the old Daoist priest and personally take action.However, before she could show her might, she was burned to ashes by the three \u201cPerfected Immortals\u201d the moment she entered the puppet\u2019s mind\u2026\u2018No, that doesn\u2019t seem to be a real living being. Could it be some kind of divine power\u2019s creation?The person behind him might be an expert!Before Daoist Wen Jing\u2019s eyes, the flame pattern began to appear.It was a scene that was brought back by her spiritual will. She could not suppress it for a moment.Who was this person?Could it be that he is, like me, using a puppet to teach others?Daoist Wen Jing snorted coldly in her heart. She forcefully wiped away the images and revealed a charming smile.This Immortal Du Sect is getting more and more interesting\u2026\u201cEh? It\u2019s you?\u201dSuddenly, Daoist Wen Jing frowned. A man\u2019s voice sounded in her heart.The person said, \u201cSomeone actually concealed your heavenly secrets? No wonder, I couldn\u2019t tell who you were even when I was halfway through.\u201dWho?!Who is speaking!Daoist Wen Jing\u2019s body trembled. She immediately stopped the seal. A sanguine glow surged from her body and extinguished the voice.However, she did not have the time to deduce what had happened. Her eyes were still in a daze as an extremely mysterious Dao rune revolved around her.At that moment, Daoist Wen Jing suddenly sensed the emotions that she had not felt for a long time\u2026Fear.The pure fear that came from the depths of her essence soul!In a daze, Daoist Wen Jing seemed to have seen a layer of fog. However, at the same time, a water curtain appeared in front of her and blocked her figure.She knew that it was the manifestation of a Great Dao phenomenon. This water curtain was the technique of a Saint that hid the heavenly secrets from her.However, Daoist Wen Jing could not see through the fog at all.Outside the water curtain, a silhouette in the fog, that was distorted by the water curtain was slowly walking over.Daoist Wen Jing could vaguely see that the person was raising his left palm. There seemed to be two faint black and white auras in his palm. These two auras were chasing each other endlessly, containing profound truths.\u201cTsk.\u201dDaoist Wen Jing heard that voice again. The other party kept smiling. \u201cAfter borrowing the power of Teacher\u2019s painting, I can\u2019t tell who you are. You must be a disciple of a Saint.\u201dThrough the water curtain, the Daoist\u2019s figure kept twisting and swaying. However, Daoist Wen Jing felt a chill in her heart.At this moment, she was locked by some Dao runes and could not escape from the illusion. Then, the person said warmly, \u201cI am Xuandu, the eldest disciple of the Heavenly Lord of Dao and Virtue.\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist, you wanted to harm my Ren School for no reason. You had evil intentions, and your methods are despicable. However, I will not touch you on account of the Saint behind you.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIf you dare to offend Ren School in the future, even if it\u2019s just the insignificant Immortal Du Sect\u2026 the Uncle-Master behind you might not be able to protect you.\u201d After saying that, the figure outside the water curtain chuckled and slowly dissipated with the surrounding fog.Daoist Wen Jing\u2019s vision blurred and she instantly saw the situation in her Cave Abode.She looked down at her hands and felt her Dao.They were trembling uncontrollably\u2026In the northwest direction of the Immortal Du Sect that was 5,000 kilometers away, Xuandu, who was standing on the cloud with his eyes closed, slowly opened his eyes.\u201cEldest Senior Brother, how is it?\u201d the old Daoist priest beside him quickly asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When I discovered this wisp of Dao runes just now, I chased after it. However, with the help of a Saint, I can only rely on the power of the Taiji painting to scare him\u2026\u201dThe old Daoist priest beside him frowned and sighed.Compared to Xuandu, he was dressed casually and had a mild temperament.The old Daoist priest was very particular about his Daoist robe, Daoist hoop, Daoist boots, and the horsetail whisk in his hand. On the contrary, he had the demeanor of an otherworldly expert.However, the old Daoist priest was extremely polite to Xuandu. When he spoke, he smiled and leaned forward slightly.The old Daoist priest asked again, \u201cEldest Senior Brother, what do you think we should do next?\u201d\u201cDao Brother, let\u2019s go to the Immortal Du Sect to deal with the trouble first!\u201dXuandu smiled and said, \u201cIf you go any later, they might have already dealt with their enemies. There won\u2019t be anything much for you, the founder, to do. Once you settle the matters regarding the Immortal Du Sect, remember to bring the corpses of the Qi Refinement cultivators from Golden Ao Island back to this place. We have to make a trip to Golden Ao Island later.\u201dCorpses\u2026The old Daoist priest sighed. He understood and looked ashamed as he said, \u201cI have to trouble you to go to great lengths this time, Eldest Senior Brother. I was too careless.\u201dXuandu waved his hand and urged.\u201cHey, it\u2019s a small matter, it\u2019s a small matter. Fellow Daoist, hurry up and go! Since we\u2019re in this sect, we have gained karma. We should be more careful in the future.\u201d\u201cI will follow your instructions, Eldest Senior Brother.\u201dThe old Daoist priest, Perfected Du\u2019e from the Kunlun Mountain, bowed to Xuandu.He did not dare to delay any further. He immediately activated his Universe Spell and disappeared.After traveling for less than 5,000 kilometers on the cloud that rose and fell, Perfected Du\u2019e arrived above the Immortal Du Sect.He lowered his head and looked down. He saw streams of light flowing around the main peak below. Rays of sanguine light were everywhere.The Perfected One was instantly enraged!The Qilin Beast that he had saved in the ancient times and placed in that place was almost suffering from a recurrence of its old injury.One of the in-name disciples of Perfected Du\u2019e finally became a cultivator in the Golden Immortal realm. Du\u2019e was finally able to show off to the other cultivators of the Kunlun Mountain. Yet, the favored disciple of his was actually surrounded by two people and had gotten injured!Perfected Du\u2019e flung his horsetail whisk and exerted pressure on the Immortal Du Sect.He then took a deep breath and activated the \u201cDouble Qi\u201d technique. The tip of his nose trembled as he let out a muffled snort!Below him, the three phony Golden Immortals all spat out blood after hearing the humph. Their Essence Souls were almost shattered\u2026The primordial Golden Immortal had extraordinary abilities!Li Changshou\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up when he was secretly observing the situation in the Immortal Du Sect with the help of the paper effigy while cleaning up the battle 5,000 kilometers away.My powerful supporter is here!He suddenly got an urge and closed the array formation in the inner layer of Little Qiong Peak. The array formation outside the Pill Chamber was activated.The \u2018Heaven\u2019 Paper Effigies No. 2 and No. 8 quickly transformed back into paper form in the mountain gate. The immortal power on them turned into spiritual energy and dissipated.After doing that, Li Changshou immediately calmed his mind, as if nothing had happened.At the bottom of the Earth Meridian Teleportation Array, where the disciples of the Immortal Du Sect were hiding\u2026The five people who had been charmed had already fallen to the ground on the slope beside the valley.The bewitched demonic roc lay on the ground and snored loudly. Everything seemed to have frozen at the instant that Youqin Xuanya threw out the poisonous pill.Youqin Xuanya was lying on the ground, surrounded by flying swords. Ling\u2019e was lying beside Youqin Xuanya, as if she had had a terrible fall\u2026She faceplanted into the grass.It could not be helped. Li Changshou had perfectly restored the \u201ccrime scene\u201d.The unconscious \u201cLi Changshou\u201d who was lying at Ling\u2019e\u2019s feet slowly sank into the ground and turned into a paper doll.Without a sound, the jade hairpin on Ling\u2019e\u2019s head gently shattered. Li Changshou\u2019s figure appeared beside Ling\u2019e. He quickly put away the paper effigy that was in the soil and laid down again. He closed his eyes and pretended to faint.He was trying to recall if he had missed anything in the process.If he predicted correctly, a bunch of unsolved mysteries would appear in the Immortal Du Sect.During the battle at the Immortal Du Sect, there were a few \u201cheroes\u201d who had sacrificed themselves and protected the human Daoists\u2026During the battle between the disciples of the Immortal Du Sect and an old Daoist priest who was a Heaven Immortal, another old Daoist priest who was \u201cpassing by\u201d killed that old Daoist priest, and left calmly.The only hidden danger was that Elder Wan Linyun might have guessed something.Another danger would be the fact that Youqin Xuanya knew too much.Later on, I will have to talk to Elder Wan Linyun about life and philosophy.Li Changshou was actually in a very good mood.It was not because he had killed that old Heaven Immortal and obtained a sword that was at the level of a Postnatal numinous treasure, as well as the precious Poison-Repelling Pearl.It was not because he had supported the Immortal Du Sect, which had almost collapsed. He was only doing his best. It was because he found out that the Immortal Du Sect really had a founder who was alive.Wasn\u2019t that thunderous groan the mystical ability that the Heng-Ha Generals used during the God-Conferment Tribulation?Perfected Du\u2019e seems to be General Heng\u2019s master or something.After the major calamity, the Immortal Du Sect was proven to be a faction of the Ren School. No matter how incompetent the disciples may be or how weak their Dao may be in the future, they would still be true disciples of Ren School.They suddenly had a stronger base.Unfortunately, we did not manage to summon the legendary Great Daoist Master Xuandu this time. If Xuandu, the head disciple of the Ren School appeared personally, the effect would definitely be better.Perhaps the Immortal Du Sect could move from the East Continent to the Middle Continent\u2026However, I might have been targeted by Daoist Wen this time.For some reason, the joy in Li Changshou\u2019s heart dissipated, and he felt a strong sense of danger.How could he avoid being targeted by the Western Sect?At the thought of that, Li Changshou could not help but recall the village on the coast of the South Ocean, which made his heart race.Lately, I\u2019ve been busy dealing with the enemy and did not check the situation in the South Ocean.Li Changshou, who was lying on the ground and pretending to be unconscious, felt his face twitch.At this moment, his merit from incense offerings was actually\u2026 doubled from the amount he had two years ago!What the hell?Is the Xiong Village trying to gain wealth by promoting the South Ocean Sect?Li Changshou secretly sensed it and he almost fainted.1,621 statues\u2026More than statues of him were rising\u2026Moreover, he could vaguely sense that a large-scale fight had begun because the South Ocean Sect had a conflict with the smaller Merit-Convergence Sect.What kind of rhythm is this\u2026Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched. He did not know what to say. He could only lie there and pretend to be dead.Come to think of it, if his disciples were to engage in a fierce battle, would they cause a deficit in his karma or luck?Uh\u2026Sect? Bullshit!From now on, I don\u2019t know anything about the Sea God of the South Ocean!I should probably think of a way to get plastic surgery. After returning to the mountain, I should get a few of the witches\u2019 curses tattooed on my body.Although I can be considered to have cozied up to Perfected Du\u2019e, I still don\u2019t have that much support yet.At this moment, I can only hope for Master to enter the Perfected Immortal Realm earlier and work in the Heavenly Courts. Then, I can trick him into going to the Tushita Palace to visit the Grand Supreme Elder and gain more backingDaoist Wen.South Ocean Sect.Li Changshou laid on the ground, feeling a little helpless and speechless. The exhaustion that he had felt from controlling the paper effigy slowly overwhelmed him, but he got rid of it quietly again.It\u2019s not the time to rest now.At this moment, I have the highest tendency of letting my guard down and becoming careless. I\u2019m also the most prone to getting caught off-guard.Li Changshou observed his surroundings quietly. After waiting for an hour, a figure flew out from the cave and hurried over.He had been secretly observing the disciples. The three elders who were in charge of the external affairs of Hundred Mortal Hall rushed to the demonic roc\u2019s side and killed it while it was unconscious.A group of disciples surrounded them. The Essence Immortal from Pill Tripod Peak gave a detailed diagnosis for the five of them. He only said that they had passed out because they had been drugged, and that they were fine.The broken porcelain bottle and the remnants of the shattered pills were quickly discovered by them.There was no need for the five of them to speak up after they regained consciousness. Everyone had already guessed what had happened there\u2026 An elder picked up Li Changshou, Lan Ling\u2019e, and Youqin Xuanya using his immortal power. They were carefully placed in a desolate mountain forest to rest.Before that group of disciples rushed out of the cave, there was already news from the sect.The founder, Perfected Du\u2019e, had appeared and killed three Golden Immortals. The Sect Leader and Elder Qi Ling immediately dealt with their enemies.The Immortal Du Sect had engaged in a bloody battle. The sect was intact and unscathed but the elders of the various peaks were injured\u2026To most of them, the calamity struck without reason and ended quickly.To a certain pretty boy who knew the entire plot\u2026 the matter was very complicated and emotionally-exhausting.A few hours later, Exalted Wang Qing, Elder Wan Linyun, and more than a hundred Perfected Immortals from the sect rushed over.Li Changshou, who was pretending to be unconscious, suddenly heard a familiar voice.The person exclaimed, \u201cLittle Changshou! Little Ling\u2019e! Don\u2019t scare me. Why are you guys lying down!?!\u201dOn the cloud, Aunt-Master Jiu Jiu, who was sitting on the huge wine gourd, jumped down and rushed to the side of the forest in a hurry. The elders of Hundred Mortal Hall who were at the side quickly explained that they were only knocked out by the incapacitating agents and that they were not in any trouble.Jiu Jiu heaved a sigh of relief and sat beside Ling\u2019e. Her short linen shirt swayed slightly.At that moment, she did not have much immortal power left. There were wounds on her left shoulder and waist. Even her essence soul was a little weak.She had also given her all during the battle to protect the Immortal Sect. After the battle, she did not have time to rest and immediately rushed there to look for the disciples whom she cared about.Soon, Jiang Jingshan, Jiu Wu, and Jiu Shi rushed over too.They carried the unconscious Li Changshou and the other two using their immortal powers and brought them back to the sect.The two elders who were Perfected Immortals woke up after being unconscious for an entire day.Youqin Xuanya slept for seven whole days before she woke up.In order to make his actions seem more reasonable, Li Changshou forced himself to lie on the bed with his eyes closed. He remained motionless for seven and a half days before slowly opening his eyes. His eyes were filled with confusion\u2026As soon as he opened his eyes, he was greeted with a bed that he was unfamiliar with.Li Changshou naturally knew that he and his junior sister had been brought to the Heaven-Breaking Peak and that he was currently lying on Jiu Jiu\u2019s bed.Ling\u2019e was arranged to stay in Jiu Shi\u2019s attic. She had been sleeping soundly without anyone disturbing her.In the past seven days, Jiu Jiu was often encouraged by Jiu Shi to constantly poke and touch Li Changshou.However, Li Changshou did not bother about it because they\u2019d never touched him in inappropriate places.He turned around to see Jiu Jiu sitting on the ground and leaning against the bed. There were two empty bottles beside her, and she was snoring softly. Who takes care of a patient like the way you do?Li Changshou did not know whether to laugh or cry. He slowly sat up and looked around. He would probably remember for life, the first time he was carried to that pavilion by his Uncle-Master Jiu Wu, and the first time he captured everything in there with his immortal senses.It was beyond chaotic\u2026Just as he was about to stand up, a silver-white arrow flew in from outside the window. Li Changshou immediately raised his hand and stopped the messenger arrow from reaching the window.An unfamiliar voice sounded.\u201cLi Changshou, disciple of the Little Qiong Peak!\u201dLi Changshou stood up and cupped his hands. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cCome to the Immortal Ascension Hall quickly. The Sect Leader has been waiting for you for a long time.\u201dLi Changshou frowned subconsciously and said softly, \u201cRoger.\u201dSect Leader?Could it be that the Sect Leader had seen through the good deeds that I\u2019ve done and the facade that I put up previously?It doesn\u2019t make sense. After I returned, I had been keeping an eye on Elder Wan Linyun using my immortal senses. I had also noticed the people in the sect burning incense and making offerings to the nameless heroes\u2026All the signs show that no one would suspect me.No matter what, I cannot avoid the Sect Leader\u2019s summon.Li Changshou stood up and tidied his Daoist robe. He lowered his head and placed two bottles of \u201cpleasant-tasting\u201d Spirit Pills beside his Little Aunt-Master\u2019s hand. Then, he looked at Ling\u2019e, who was sleeping soundly and hurried to the Immortal Du Hall.As soon as Li Changshou left for the Immortal Du Hall, the bag hanging on Ling\u2019e\u2019s waist started to twist.However, Lan Ling\u2019e\u2019s cultivation level was too low, and she was still in a deep sleep. She did not sense anything strange about the beast-hide bag at all\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDid I really expose my cultivation level?When Li Changshou flew towards the Immortal Du Hall on a cloud, he kept thinking about that problem.Now, because of the matter regarding the South Ocean Sect and the fact that he might have been careless and faced Daoist Wen head-on for a while\u2026The cultivation level that I had hidden is no longer as simple as a trump card.This directly concerns my life!Li Changshou had put in a lot of effort into learning the \u201cunorthodox\u201d \u2018Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra\u2019.In the beginning, he had analyzed all kinds of cultivation techniques and summed them up in reverse. He had also made a summary of the various techniques of hiding one\u2019s aura, that existed in the Immortal Du Sect. He had also figured out a way to hide his aura\u2026Before he transcended the tribulation, that technique had already been improved dozens of times. After Li Changshou became an immortal, that technique was upgraded to the same level as the escape technique!However, Li Changshou felt a little uncertain about facing a Golden Immortal who had been living for an unknown amount of time\u2026I can only have two strings to my bow. If the Sect Leader is testing me on purpose, I can use the third backup plan.The so-called backup plan was to prove his innocence immediately.He would immediately prove that he was not a spy of the enemy or an otherworldly demon and that he was a true disciple of the Immortal Du Sect. However, due to coincidences, his cultivation speed was a little faster. Thus, he had accidentally advanced during the Tribulation Transcendence\u2026 He landed in front of the magnificent hall and looked at it.Li Changshou calmed himself down, retracted his immortal senses, and stabilized his aura at the eighth-stage of the Void Return realm. He then entered.As soon as he entered the hall, he heard a faint voice transmission.\u201cAhem, ahem\u2026 Li Changshou, the disciple from Little Qiong Peak? Don\u2019t say anything. Just nod.\u201dLi Changshou nodded gently and remained composed.The voice transmission continued, \u201cCome to the left. There\u2019s a small door at the corner of the hall. Come in. Don\u2019t be nervous. I am the Sect Leader of the Immortal Du Sect. I called you over because I wanted to tell you about something trivial.\u201d*Coughs*Li Changshou was rendered speechless. Let\u2019s not talk about the rest first. Why does the Sect Leader sound so sick in the voice transmission?Li Changshou lowered his head and walked quickly to the somewhat empty main hall of the sect. He headed towards the left corner of the main hall and soon arrived in front of the two wooden doors.He stood there for a while. When he heard the Sect Master\u2019s voice again, he gently pushed open the wooden door\u2026There was a simple and elegant tea room inside. There were a few tables and chairs, and two open windows which revealed the beautiful scenery of Cloud Peak Island.Li Changshou was not in the mood to appreciate those things. He raised his head and looked at the young Daoist who was seated in front of the window.He was the Sect Leader and the in-name disciple of the in-name disciple of the Grand Pure One\u2026His name was Ji Wuyou.His face was like a jade crown, his eyebrows were like swords, and his eyes were like stars. He was handsome and suave. There was no need to mention too much about his appearance.Normally, a male Qi Refinement cultivator who maintained the appearance of a middle-aged or young man would not be too ugly if it were not for his or his Dao companion\u2019s special preferences.The Sect Leader\u2019s smile was gentle, and his temperament was elegant. He gave off a gentle and elegant vibe\u2026 However, that was not the point.The point was\u2026The Golden Immortal Sect Leader\u2019s face was pale, his aura was weak, and his eyes were out of focus. Although he was tall and taut, he seemed a little haggard and weak.If he did not know that the Sect Leader Ji Wuyou\u2019s Dao name was \u2018Wuyou\u2019, and was known as \u2018Sect Leader Wuyou\u2019 in the East Continent, Li Changshou would have given him a nickname in his head- \u2018Empty Young Master of the Primordial World\u2019.When the Sect Leader saw Li Changshou, he smiled. A streak of immortal blood actually flowed from the corner of his mouth\u2026Li Changshou was shocked as well. \u201cSect Leader!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a small problem. There\u2019s no need to worry. I\u2019ve just suffered some injuries to my Essence Soul. I\u2019ve already consumed some Spirit Pills with healing purposes.\u201dThe Sect Leader Ji Wuyou wiped the corners of his mouth before taking a deep breath gently. He stabilized his injuries and said, \u201cI will be able to recover from this minor injury in a while. You\u2019re Changshou, right? Take this\u2026 I\u2019ve been waiting for you for a few days just to give this to you.\u201dThis Sect Leader Ji Wuyou took out a jade bottle from his sleeve and gently pushed it towards Li Changshou. Li Changshou lowered his head and held it with both hands.At that moment, Li Changshou felt rather emotional.My Sect Leader has sustained so many injuries for the sake of protecting the Immortal Du Sect! Yet, I previously commented that the Sect Leader\u2019s mystical abilities are too weak, and said that he wasn\u2019t competent enough. I really\u2026 Li Changshou sighed.Li Changshou felt ashamed. He felt grateful towards the Sect Leader who was desperately protecting the sect.\u201cSect Leader, you are injured. Please go into seclusion soon to recuperate. It has been hard on you. You fought against the demons from outside in order to protect the sect.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a trivial matter.\u201dJi Wuyou laughed, looking a little awkward. He sighed and said, \u201cActually, a few days ago, I obtained a mystical ability from the founder of the sect, which allows me to nurture Connate Qi\u2026 I have been trying to cultivate these few days but I was too anxious and accidentally injured my Essence Soul. Haha\u2026\u201dJi Wuyou coughed.Li Changshou was rendered speechless.\u201cChangshou.\u201dJi Wuyou calmly wiped the blood away from the corner of his mouth. He looked at the porcelain bottle in Li Changshou\u2019s hand. His gaze was slightly hesitant, but he still spoke tactfully.\u201cThe thing in your hand must be kept properly. Do you know that the Immortal Du Sect\u2019s founder who is also my Master, is Perfected Du\u2019e who belongs to the Ren School and is the Pure Virtue Immortal God of the Kunlun Mountain?\u201dHe continued, \u201cThis porcelain bottle is from a senior of the Ren School. He entrusted the founder *cough*\u2026 to pass it to you. He claimed that he wants to sever some karma with you. I can\u2019t say much about this. However, this is also your fate. The Spirit Pills inside must be used properly.\u201d Do you understand?\u201dLi Changshou was suddenly enlightened. He lowered his head and said, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cGo. Just remember this. Your cultivation level and aptitude are not bad. When you transcend the tribulation and become an immortal, you can cultivate in peace in the sect.\u201dJi Wuyou waved his hand. Li Changshou bowed and accepted the order before leaving the house.Before he could close the door completely, Li Changshou heard some violent coughing and puffing which seemed to be the sound of blood spurting out\u2026The corners of Li Changshou\u2019s mouth twitched. He closed the wooden doors and pretended not to hear anything. Then, he turned around and walked towards the door.The Sect Leader\u2019s last sentence was actually to calm him down.Every 200 years, the Immortal Du Sect would recruit a batch of disciples. Before they recruited the next batch of disciples, they would give them a choice. They could either continue to stay in the sect or go out to cultivate and explore the outside world.What the sect leader meant was\u2014as long as Li Changshou cultivated in peace and survived the Immortal Ascension Tribulation in the future, the treatment he received in the sect would not be too poor. After leaving the hall, Li Changshou felt much more at ease.Fortunately, it was just a false alarm.His cultivation level was not exposed. As the Sect Leader of the sect, Ji Wuyou paid special attention to Li Changshou, a disciple of Little Qiong Peak, only because of the porcelain bottle in his hand.If he had guessed correctly, the bottle was given by the Great Daoist Master Xuandu.The karma that he wanted to sever was related to the matter that Elder Moon had looked him up for previously.Um\u2026What did Master Xuandu and Elder Yue do to my marriage affinity clay figurines?Li Changshou looked at the Spirit Pills in the porcelain bottle. Putting the quality of the spirit pills aside, the porcelain bottle itself was not an ordinary Dharma artifact. Apart from preserving the medicinal properties of the pills, it could also stabilize the pills and prevent clashes between medicinal properties.After analyzing the effects of the Level-6 Spirit Pills in his head, the corners of his mouth twitched.Nurtures the essence soul to strengthen the foundation, stabilizes the Essence Soul, strengthens the Connate Yang\u2026 I can tell that this Head Disciple of Ren School has rather impressive alchemy skills. After all, not everyone can take out a Yang-Refining Level-6 Spirit Pill.This pill\u2026I\u2019ll let Master use it.After all, it\u2019s a Level-6 Spirit Pill. It can be used to strengthen the Connate Yang and stabilize one\u2019s Essence Soul. It will be very helpful to master, who is a Turbid Immortal.However, the pill will eventually have an irrepressible effect on the bodies of male Qi Refinement cultivators. Should I persuade Master to find a wife?If it\u2019s just for the pill, there would be no need for it.Why don\u2019t I use this pill as a congratulatory gift for Master when he finds his Dao companion?Li Changshou smiled and kept the porcelain bottle.Li Changshou slowly released his immortal senses after he was a distance away from the Immortal Du Hall.His junior sister was still sleeping soundly at Aunt-Master Jiu Shi\u2019s place. However, the bag tied around her waist was constantly wriggling\u2026 Master is awake?Li Changshou hurriedly drove over on a cloud.He had long thought of an explanation he could give to his master. On the way, Li Changshou passed by the Hundred Mortal Hall and glanced at it.Under the shade of a tree, two stone tablets were erected. On one of the tablets, there were words that described the calamity that suddenly struck the Immortal Du Sect, the battle fought by the sect the process of the protection of the sect.On the other stone tablet were the names of the immortals from the Immortal Du Sect who had died in that battle\u2026The stability of a sect was actually dependent on the Qi Refinement cultivators in the sect who had to protect and maintain it.They naturally had to protect their own nest.However, Li Changshou soon saw another corner of the square opposite the two stone tablets\u2026There were three stone sculptures that had just been placed on the ground.On the left was a petite and beautiful female immortal. In the middle of the room was a sword-bearing male immortal. On the right was a burly man who was carrying a huge ax and laughing with his mouth wide open.Those three stone sculptures were quite magical. The creator of the stone sculptures accurately captured every paper Daoist\u2019s \u201cdivine marrow\u201d.There were two vertical plaques on both sides of the three stone sculptures. On them were written:\u201cThe heroes of the human race.\u201d\u201cImmortal Du Sect has eternal respect for them.\u201dThere were three incense sticks that were inserted in a small incense burner in front.Li Changshou could not help but rub the spot in the middle of his forehead. He pretended not to see it and rushed to his junior sister\u2019s side.The Immortal Du Sect was investigating the origin of the Blood Mosquito Puppets and the followers of the few \u201cRighteous Fellow Daoists\u201d.The reason for investigating the former was naturally to seek revenge.The reason for investigating the latter was to make up to the three fellow Daoists by giving their friends and family some benefits.Li Changshou felt that it would be better to keep the matter a secret and let the Immortal Du Sect search aimlessly, instead of revealing the information he knew, to the Immortal Du Sect.And those righteous heroes\u2026Li Changshou immediately got an idea.Should I get a few paper effigies to mourn and indirectly get some precious treasures and Spirit Stones from the sect?Li Changshou smiled and dispelled that thought\u2026The battle allowed him to clearly understand the function of the array formation. He had also made further plans.The Little Qiong Peak\u2019s array formation could continuously be strengthened and driven deeper. The inner array foundations could be combined into a single array formation and he could refine Little Qiong Peak into a huge mobile array foundation.Immortals with high cultivation levels could refine their Cave Abodes into Dharma treasures. They could be of any size the immortals preferred.Once my cultivation level is higher, I can do that too.If I encounter another disaster that threatens the entire sect\u2026I can sacrifice Little Qiong Peak to kill powerful enemies.If I choose to retreat, I can directly put Little Qiong Peak into my sleeve and escape to a spot that was 50,000 kilometers away.However, that would require vast amounts of precious materials and long-term preparations.I don\u2019t lack time now. I still have to do what I need to do.Li Changshou made up his mind. He realized that he was already near the land of the Jiu immortals. He calmed his mind and lowered his head.He had to wake his junior sister up first and return to the Little Qiong Peak together. He had to comfort his master before anything else.What can I do for Disciple-Niece Han Zhi now?Beside the Treasure Pool on Golden Ao Island.Ao Yi, who looked like a delicate young man, looked at Han Zhi, who was secretly hurt. His gaze was filled with melancholy.Senior Brother Yuan Ze had been schemed against and controlled by someone who made him do something ridiculous. A few days ago, he was sent back to Golden Ao Island by the Eldest Senior Brother of Ren School.A few experts from Jie School pleaded for mercy in front of the Eldest Senior Brother from Ren School. In the end, Senior Brother Yuan Ze\u2019s remnant soul was exonerated and allowed to reincarnate. He no longer has anything to do with Jie School\u2026Ao Yi could not help but make up his mind when he recalled how his Senior Brother Yuan Ze had taken care of him.I will treat your disciple well.\u201cHan Zhi\u2026\u201dJust as Ao Yi was about to say something when his immortal senses suddenly discovered two old Daoists who were flying towards him from outside the Golden Ao Island.He immediately perked up and quickly said, \u201cThe two Senior Brothers who sent Senior Brother Yuan Ze\u2019s soul to the underworld are back!\u201dHan Zhi looked up and her eyes turned red again. She hurriedly rode a cloud and went up in a bid to ask her master how he was doing in the Netherworld\u2026A moment later, the two old Daoists were stopped by Ao Yi and Han Zhixian. Both of them frowned and did not know what to say.Ao Yi quickly asked, \u201cSenior Brothers, is there something wrong?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, it should have been fine. It should have been fine!\u201dThe old Daoist priest on the left sighed and said in a low voice, \u201cOn account of the Jie School, the immortals of the underworld will not make things too hard for him.\u201d\u201cHowever, according to the rules set by the Sage, we cannot interfere with the Six Paths of Reincarnation. Therefore, the immortals of the underworld can only guarantee that they will arrange for Junior Brother Yuan Ze to be reincarnated as a person with a good fortune. He will no longer have any ties with this life. However, unexpectedly\u2026\u201d.The old Daoist priest on the right looked up and sighed. \u201cBefore Junior Brother Yuan Ze drank Meng Po\u2019s soup, that wisp of soul spoke again!\u201d\u201cW-What\u2026\u201dHan Zhi asked in a trembling voice, \u201cWhat did my master say?\u201d\u201cHe said, don\u2019t worry. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems with a trivial matter like reincarnation.\u201dHan Zhi could not help but hold her forehead with one hand, feeling dizzy\u2026Ao Yi quickly asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cHe has passed the Bridge of Helplessness and drank Meng Po\u2019s soup. He\u2019s arrived in front of a few paths. However, for some reason, there was a wave in the River of Forgetfulness that appeared and sent his soul to the path to becoming beasts. We couldn\u2019t save him either. His soul was absorbed by the Reincarnation Wheel. We have also asked around about the rest of the matters. Junior Brother Yuan Ze seems to have reincarnated as a demon. In his next life, he should be a black-skinned leopard.\u201d \u201cMaster\u2026\u201dWhen Han Zhi heard those words, she was overwhelmed with grief. Her essence soul was in turmoil and her mind was declining. Her body was on the verge of collapsing and she was quickly supported by Ao Yi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not see Jiu Wu and Jiu Shi, nor did he see any other Jiu Immortals.They had gone to the various parts of the sect to get busy.Little Aunt-Master was still drunk and sleeping soundly beside the bed. Li Changshou did not disturb her.Should I carry Little Aunt-Master onto the bed?He would naturally not do something that could easily be misunderstood.That was not all. Li Changshou had also studied the surroundings of his Aunt-Master\u2019s pavilion for a while. Soon, he understood the principles behind the protective array formation.Li Changshou connected the array foundation of the array formation there and the array formation around her pavilion to protect her uninhibited appearance while she was sleeping\u2026The array formation in this place was obviously set up by Uncle-Master Jiu Wu because it was in the style of a \u201cshort Daoist\u201d.Then, Li Changshou found a disciple who was in charge of performing miscellaneous tasks, and took two bottles of Soul Formation Pills from him.someAfter some small talk, Li Changshou told him to tell Jiu Jiu that he and Ling\u2019e had already returned to the Little Qiong Peak, after she woke up. After that, Li Changshou brought Ling\u2019e along and let her lie on the cloud while he flew at a height that he was most familiar with towards Little Qiong Peak.To be honest, the presence of Little Qiong Peak was really too insignificant.Although Li Changshou was very satisfied with that\u2026 no one from the Immortal Sect dropped by to ask about him! That made the detailed things that Li Changshou had prepared completely useless!Of course, it was a good thing that he could not use them\u2026Fortunately, Li Changshou did not see his master\u2019s name on the stone tablet of the Hundred Mortal Hall, which had just been erected to commemorate the deceased \u201cmartyrs\u201d. Otherwise, he would not know how to explain it to his master.No matter how long the three statues of the paper effigies had been worshiped, nothing else should have happened.The \u201cmemorial\u201d was purely a form of commemoration. There would be no merit gained from burning incense\u2026Upon returning to the straw hut, Li Changshou woke Ling\u2019e up first.After discussing for a while, the two of them decided to act according to the first plan that they had drawn up previously to \u201ccalm their master down\u201d.Li Changshou laid back on his bed. His lips were dry and his eyes were out of focus. There was a hint of longing in his eyes.Lan Ling\u2019e ran to her master\u2019s straw hut and knelt on the meditation cushion, before\u2026 releasing him.\u201cWho had the audacity to plot against me!?!Look at my Dharma treasures!\u201dQi Yuan jumped out of the pocket, raised his horsetail whisk, and looked around angrily. He lowered his head and saw his little disciple kneeling on the ground.Ling\u2019e\u2019s eyes reddened as she bit her lip gently. She secretly pinched her thigh and used some of her true cultivation level.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201dQi Yuan was stunned. Then, he recalled that he had been drugged by two of his disciples.Qi Yuan scanned his surroundings using his immortal senses and saw his eldest disciple lying in the straw hut next door.He asked, \u201cLing\u2019e, what\u2019s wrong with you? What happened to your Senior Brother!?!\u201d\u201cMaster, a large number of demons invaded the sect previously. Senior Brother was worried that you would rush up to fight the demons and hence, he took you and me away\u2026 During the battle, Senior Brother\u2026\u201dBefore Ling\u2019e could finish speaking, Qi Yuan rushed over to Li Changshou\u2019s bedside.Qi Yuan looked at his heavily injured disciple and was filled with deep regret. He quickly took out numerous bottles of medicine, but he did not know which type of medicine to use. Li Changshou opened his eyes and said softly, \u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m here!\u201d Qi Yuan replied in a trembling voice. \u201cI\u2019m here. If you have something to say, just say it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Li Changshou said in a hoarse voice and sighed faintly. \u201cMaster, I\u2019ve bewitched you previously\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. It\u2019s not an issue. You were just sparing a thought for me. How can I not understand?\u201dQi Yuan sat on the side of the bed and grabbed Li Changshou\u2019s wrist before checking it carefully.The old Daoist priest\u2019s expression changed instantly. The immortal power in his eldest disciple\u2019s body was much purer and clearer than his own. It was indeed the immortal power of the Essence Immortal realm.However, those immortal powers were rather insignificant to Qi Yuan\u2019s senses.At that moment, Li Changshou\u2019s aura was extremely chaotic. His heart was ricocheting like a drum. Upon closer inspection, Qi Yuan discovered that it was actually\u2026 very rhythmic like musical percussion!Li Changshou forced a smile and said, \u201cMaster, I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dQi Yuan\u2019s eyes were filled with guilt. He sighed and said, \u201cAh, I was incompetent. I couldn\u2019t protect you and Ling\u2019e. I even made you and Ling\u2019e work so hard.\u201d\u201cMaster, I was the one who drugged you and caused you to faint. Otherwise, you\u2019d definitely be able to\u2026\u201d *Coughs* Qi Yuan quickly said, \u201cThat\u2019s just a trivial matter. I don\u2019t blame you. I don\u2019t blame you.\u201dLi Changshou coughed weakly and smiled bitterly. \u201cMaster, that\u2019s just a verbal statement with no proof. I really feel guilty from the bottom of my heart.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Yes, I swear that I will not blame you this time!\u201d\u201cMaster, what do you swear to?\u201d \u201cTo the Great Dao, of course\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, if you don\u2019t chant the \u2018Gratitude Incantation\u2019, the Great Dao will not detect it.\u201d\u201cAlright, I will do that! Eh?\u201dQi Yuan was stunned. He looked at Li Changshou who was lying on the bed.The latter\u2019s eyes were half-closed, and he was barely breathing. He coughed weakly again. The old Daoist priest looked at Ling\u2019e, who was hiding outside the straw hut, and his immortal senses circled around the Little Qiong Peak. He immediately recovered from the shock.Qi Yuan said coldly, \u201cChangshou, your Qi-Calming Turtle Breathing Mantra doesn\u2019t seem to only conceal your cultivation level.\u201d\u201cMaster, I\u2026\u201d\u201cPsht!\u201dSuddenly, a noise could be heard from outside the door. After trying hard to hold it in, she could not help but laugh.Qi Yuan was speechless.Li Changshou coughed and sat up silently. He smiled sincerely at his master.\u201cMaster, I\u2019m really fine.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dQi Yuan picked up his horsetail whisk and hit Li Changshou with it. Li Changshou took the chance to escape, but when he was at the door, he was hugged by Ling\u2019e who suddenly pounced on him!\u201cSenior Brother, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201dLing\u2019e squinted and smiled. She quickly yelled at Qi Yuan who was inside, \u201cMaster, I\u2019ve caught Senior Brother! Senior Brother forced me to do all of those things! Master, I\u2019ve always said that you can do your part as a cultivator of the Immortal Du Sect by going out to kill enemies. However Senior Brother said that you will only fight with the higher-ups when you go to the arena without using any strategies!\u201dLi Changshou glared at Ling\u2019e. Qi Yuan had already rushed over from behind. He raised his horsetail whisk and shouted loudly. He then used it to whip Li Changshou on his back.If Li Changshou really wanted to run, he would naturally be able to escape.At this moment, he was just giving his master an out and a chance to vent his anger.He heard a few slapping sounds, and the familiar part of his body was red and swollen again\u2026Li Changshou was having a hard time too.When his master hit him with the horsetail whisk, he tried his best to suppress the immortal power in his body while retaliating against his master, lest anything happened to him.A few moments later\u2026Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e knelt neatly in front of their master.Qi Yuan sat on the round chair and frowned as he listened to Li Changshou speak.His initial anger turned into confusion, followed by a moment of realization. Qi Yuan\u2019s expression changed several times throughout the process.After Li Changshou finished speaking, Qi Yuan muttered, \u201cIs that the reason?\u201dFor a moment\u2026 he felt that something was amiss, but he could not put a finger on it.\u201cMaster, that\u2019s true.\u201d Li Changshou and Ling\u2019e nodded in unison. Qi Yuan was deep in thought.Ling\u2019e, who was at the side, pursed her lips secretly. However, she completely understood that she definitely could not give her Senior Brother a chance to speak, given the situation that they were in!Otherwise, his senior brother would really be able to twist the facts!It was clearly them who had sneaked an attack on their master. However, their master actually felt that he should have been bewitched\u2026He thought that that way, they would be able to avoid the possibility of a flaw appearing in their battle formation and causing all their efforts to go in vain because of a single person. Qi Yuan sighed. He quickly followed Li Changshou\u2019s instructions and flew into the Hundred Mortal Hall.As the Peak Leader of Little Qiong Peak, he had to show up and ask if there was anything he could do\u2026As soon as her master left, Ling\u2019e felt a chill down her spine. She could not help but shiver.\u201cSenior, Senior Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cJunior Sister.\u201d Li Changshou\u2019s smile was very friendly and gentle. \u201cYou\u2019ve become full-fledged and disobedient, huh?\u201d Ling\u2019e cringed, giggled, and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of your teachings, Senior Brother. You taught me that it\u2019s better to let one person get in trouble rather than two\u2026 Senior Brother, I was wrong!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dLi Changshou slowly stood up while supporting his buttocks with his hand. He circulated his immortal power and dissipated the external wounds that his master had just inflicted.\u201cSenior Brother, should I help you apply some medicine?\u201d\u201cForget it\u2026\u201dLi Changshou was just about to tease Ling\u2019e and take revenge on her when he felt a sudden urge. He could not help but frown.Li Changshou hid his right hand in his sleeve and pinched his fingers to make some calculations. His frown deepened.This time, it was not that something had happened to Uncle-Master Jiu Wu. He did not give Uncle-Master Jiu Wu any of those \u201clittle trinkets\u201d either.Li Changshou somehow felt a sudden sense of danger\u2026He glanced at Ling\u2019e and said, \u201cLing\u2019e, go outside and play. I need to meditate and think about something.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lingle could tell that her senior brother seemed to have some serious matters to attend to. Although she was a little dissatisfied with the word \u2018play\u2019, she still responded obediently and quickly left Li Changshou\u2019s straw hut.Li Changshou activated the surrounding array formations and sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion. He began trying to detect something with his senses and made some deductions.Something happened\u2026Something happened at the South Ocean Sea God Sect.A statue of his had been smashed.Li Changshou was delighted at first. After all, if that was the case, one of his 1,600 statues would be successfully removed.However, he could not smile at all afterwards\u2026In the small temple in the village where people worshiped him, two groups of mortals were slashing the people around them with their knives, and blood was splashing everywhere.It was a battle between sects. Li Changshou had already sensed it beforehand. He did not expect that things would become increasingly intense and that such a huge commotion would break out. There were already mortals who had begun to sacrifice their lives and shed their blood for the Sea God of the South Ocean\u2026However, Li Changshou soon realized that a wisp of black aura was wrapped around his Essence Soul and tied to his wrist.It seemed to be\u2026 negative karma!Li Changshou hurriedly took out a wisp of the incense merit he had been hiding and approached the black aura. The two intertwined and gradually disappeared.Merit and negative karma.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dLi Changshou did not know whether to laugh or cry as he remained seated. Soon, he began to think carefully.The merits of incense offerings actually came from \u201cprotecting\u201d and \u201cenlightening\u201d mortals.To a certain extent, the existence of the South Ocean Sea God Sect had made the villages in the small region unite and assist each other. That was beneficial to the stability of the world.In addition, people everywhere had been continuously worshiping him and offering incense. That was equivalent to the Heavenly Dao acknowledging him, an \u201cillegitimate\u201d god.He was forcibly accepted because of all the people who worshiped him.At that moment, the negative karma was caused by the conflict between the sects that led to the lethal fight in the mortal world. A portion of the karma that resulted from the deaths and injuries turned into negative karma which found its way to Li Changshou\u2026\u201cThis matter has to be resolved.\u201dLi Changshou remained seated while being in deep thought.He now had a paper effigy which could barely be considered an \u201cintroductory-level\u201d avatar of him. As long as he could borrow some Dharma treasures that could allow him to fly through the sky and burrow into the ground, he could save on immortal powers and rush to the South Ocean.What should I do to destroy my Sea God Sect? Instead of earning these merits from incense offerings, I\u2019d rather earn some merit in the Heavenly Courts. That merit would be pure and comfortable.I wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament, where I\u2019m at risk of being redressed by the Western Sect at any time.Now that I\u2019m thinking about it carefully, I\u2019m an \u201cillegitimate god\u201d who\u2019s being worshiped. Yet, I want to destroy my own sect. I\u2019m one of a kind. \u201cYes, I have to make careful arrangements.\u201dLi Changshou took a deep breath and began to think carefully.I must really scare those villagers of Xiong Village who are dedicated to accumulating their wealth!A few days later, at the Heaven-Breaking Peak.Jiu Jiu, who had just woken up, stood in front of the wooden door that was pushed open. She performed a few spells consecutively, but there was no reaction from the walls of the array formation outside.Huh?Jiu Jiu turned around to look inside the house. As the room was too clean, she was not used to it.Is this\u2026 really my room? Jiu Jiu frowned and realized that things were not that simple.On the Golden Ao Island.\u201cHan Zhi, you can\u2019t go on like this.\u201dAo Yi looked at the haggard-looking girl and said softly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I accompany you to walk around? If you find the scenery of the East Ocean boring, shall we go to the West and South Oceans? There is beautiful scenery everywhere in the four seas. You really can\u2019t continue being so depressed.\u201dHan Zhi sighed and smiled bitterly. \u201cMy master actually\u2026\u201dMe \u201cActually, that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Ao Yi. \u201cAfter Senior Brother Yuan Ze reincarnates, he will definitely be able to cultivate.So what if he becomes a demon?He\u2019s just going to lack some luck and fortune. He can transform and continue pursuing the Great Dao.Besides, think about it\u2026\u201dAo Yi pondered for a moment and rolled his eyes before continuing, \u201cAfter Senior Brother Yuan Ze reincarnates, he will definitely be unable to speak for a long time. Doesn\u2019t that mean he won\u2019t be able to get into trouble?\u201dHan Zhi blinked and exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201dAs Ao Yi continued to persuade her, Han Zhi\u2019s mood gradually changed for the better.She sighed softly and said gently, \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s go out for a walk. I want to relax too. Thank you Uncle-Master, for keeping me company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my duty to do so.\u201d Ao Yi smiled.I will definitely take good care of you for your master!Not long after, the two figures flew out of Golden Ao Island. They chose a random direction and moved out slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/My Senior Brother is Too Steadychapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhy is the array formation that Fifth Senior Brother set for me not working?\u201dSitting on the large gourd, Jiu Jiu put a hand on her forehead and chewed on the Spirit Pills, which were extremely chewy and did not stick to her teeth. They were able to strengthen her spirit and stabilize her essence soul. She drifted along and before she knew it, she had already arrived above Little Qiong Peak.Jiu Jiu felt a little dizzy\u2026She did not know why the protective array formation in her residence was acting up, but it suddenly stopped.Jiu Jiu tried a few times but failed. She definitely could not spoil it!As a cultivator who was at the late-stage of the Perfected Immortal realm, she had her own unique method to break the array formation although she did not know the Dao of array formations.She used her immortal power to protect her body. When she hit it with her head, it was instantly broken.Jiu Jiu then repaired the array foundation buried under the house based on her experience of working hard on the Little Qiong Peak all year round.Therefore, none of the array formations in the attic, the defensive array formations, isolation array formations, soundproofing arrays, and spirit-gathering array formations\u2026 could be used anymore!Jiu Jiu could not help but support her forehead with one hand. Array formations, alchemy, and refining artifacts, were too complicated for her.She wanted to look for someone to help her with the array formations, but she realized\u2026 that her Eldest Senior Sister and Second Senior Brother had gone out with their master. They used the corpses that were left behind that day to investigate the enemy\u2019s background.Her Third Senior Sister had gone to accompany her Dao companion, and so did her Eighth Senior Brother. He was busy managing the funerals of his fellow cultivators of other peaks who had died in battle.Her Fourth Senior Sister and Fifth Senior Brother, who were closest to her, had also gone out together with the elders of the Hundred Mortal Hall to purchase some treasures for the foundations of the mountain-protecting array formations.Her Sixth Senior Sister and Seventh Senior Brother were in seclusion and healing each other. It was said that they had some kind of mysterious technique that could help each other improve at the same time\u2026Thinking about that, Jiu Jiu snickered and sat on the large gourd. She entered the array formation of Little Qiong Peak and floated downwards.She did not go there purely to look for wine. Instead, she had something important to do.I\u2019ll ask Changshou to help me settle the array formations around my pavilion!Jiu Jiu summarized her experience of failing to repair the array formations. She felt that it was probably because she had lacked Li Changshou\u2019s nagging\u2026 After entering the isolation array outside Little Qiong Peak, Jiu Jiu could not help but smile in satisfaction.She saw Ling\u2019e, who was meditating under the tree, Li Changshou who was refining pills in the Pill Chamber, and her Senior Brother Qi Yuan, who had disappeared previously.Little Qiong Peak did not seem to have experienced the calamity that struck earlier on. It was as peaceful and tranquil as before, and there was an interesting ambiance.Jiu Jiu did not disturb Ling\u2019e, who was cultivating. She flew straight to the Pill Chamber and the array formation in front of her closed automatically. She discovered on the way\u2026 that for some reason, there were some empty patches in the forest near the Pill Chamber, and there were a few new ponds.Was he up to something related to Feng Shui?Jiu Jiu blinked and did not bother any more.Li Changshou naturally discovered Jiu Jiu\u2019s presence long ago.He stood in front of the Pill Chamber and secretly stopped the paper effigies that he had just sent to run errands and settle things once and for all in the South Ocean yesterday, in an inconspicuous spot in a corner of the East Continent.He left a wisp of his mind to monitor the surroundings. Most of his mind returned to his original body, and he smiled at his Little Aunt-Master who was flying in the sky.After a while, Jiu Jiu hesitantly explained the reason for her arrival. She raised her hand to adjust the ends of her hair beside her ears.\u201cCan you help me once\u2026 I\u2019ll give you some remuneration.\u201d\u201cLittle Aunt-Master, if you need anything, I will naturally do my best to help you.\u201dLi Changshou smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to mention any remunerations.\u201d\u201cThis time, the sect suffered a calamity. I have understood a lot. In the future, if you don\u2019t have any wine to drink, you can come here to get some.\u201d Jiu Jiu\u2019s eyes lit up and she chuckled. \u201cTell me, do you want to cozy up to me?\u201dLi Changshou hurriedly shook his head and deliberately put on a stern expression.\u201cAunt-Master, it\u2019s a little inappropriate of you to be cozying up to me. After all, there\u2019s a difference in seniority. Although seniority is not a big problem, I have always treated you as a respectable senior.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean that. I mean backing, I mean, no\u2026\u201dJiu Jiu\u2019s face was blushing slightly. She put her hands behind her back and felt conflicted. Her clean face was a little rosy.Li Changshou could not help but chuckle. Jiu Jiu immediately reacted and realized that she seemed to have been teased by her disciple-nephew.She glared at Li Changshou and said fiercely, \u201cFollow me! Repair the array formations! How dare you tease me? Are you itching for a beating? Hmph! I\u2019ve always been helping you refine pills tirelessly. I must make you incredibly exhausted today!\u201d Li Changshou cupped his hands and told Jiu Jiu to go back and that he would rush to the Heaven-Breaking Peak in an hour\u2019s time. That way, he could avoid being noticed by others while walking together with a Jiu Immortal. He could also arrange a suitable hiding place for the paper effigies that he had sent out.Jiu Jiu did not think much about it. She went back to prepare some precious materials for repairing the array formations. She jumped onto the gourd and flew back to her own residence whilst in a good mood.After Jiu Jiu left, Li Changshou stood in front of the Pill Chamber and pondered for a while before returning to the Pill Chamber to meditate.He closed his eyes and shifted his mind to the paper effigies that he had sent out.In order to resolve the problem regarding the South Ocean Sea God Sect as soon as possible, Li Changshou \u201cchallenged\u201d himself and \u201ctook a risk\u201d this time. He adjusted the paper effigies for a few days before asking his master to help him release the team of paper effigies.This time, he sent several paper effigies to the South Ocean.The new \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 1, and the \u2018God\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 2 were the main vice-captains of the team.The six \u2018Heaven\u2019 paper effigies were in charge of traveling, escaping, and fighting during critical moments. There were also numerous paper dolls with original mystical abilities.The firepower that they carried were a miniature array disc, a poisoning Dharma artifact that he had developed himself, and poisonous pills that he did not use during the battle in the Immortal Du Sect. The poisonous pills were the main weapons.The purpose of the operation was to use peaceful and obscure methods to cause the South Ocean Sea God Sect to collapse naturally in the shortest time possible, so as to allow him to escape from the unstable \u201cbomb\u201d.He controlled the \u2018Heaven\u2019 Paper Effigy No. 2, which was in charge of leading the paper dolls and paper effigies along the way. He used the Earth Escape technique to make the paper effigies more obscure. He left a wisp of his mental power on them and remained vigilant.After doing all that from afar, Li Changshou sat quietly in the Pill Chamber for a while.After calculating the time, he got up and changed into a clean robe. At the same time, he checked the various items on his body and thought about whether he had missed out anything during the preparation\u2026He did not dare to go to the South Ocean because he was worried that he would be ambushed by the people of the Western school and that they might be waiting for him.However, a competition between sects had already begun.Li Changshou had to go and stop them before the battle escalated to a massive scale.After thinking about it, Li Changshou decided not to take back the paper effigies that he had sent out this time.In order not to cause more trouble, Li Changshou focused on strengthening the paper effigies\u2019 \u201csuicide\u201d attributes during the past few days.The paper effigies could \u201cdie\u201d anytime and anywhere. They could also maintain the form that they had transformed into. They could burn themselves into ashes, lift themselves up and end everything!As a man, he should be more ruthless to his paper doll!Moreover, Li Changshou had also discovered that it might have been the ashes of a bunch of demon experts that had been buried in Little Qiong Peak\u2026The few old spiritual trees had shown new signs of life!\u201cBefore the little tree grows up, I\u2019ll have to trouble you guys.\u201dLi Changshou smiled and sat in front of the Pill Furnace, quietly pondering about his subsequent plans.Merit and negative karma were very mysterious and closely related.Although merit and negative karma could be offset, according to Li Changshou\u2019s understanding, negative karma was equivalent to poisonous pills.Merit was equivalent to antidotes.Even if he had prepared ten thousand antidote pills, he did not want to really consume one!Even if the negative karma was offset by merit, there might be some marks left on his body.Although he had transcended the Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation and advanced, his cultivation level had stabilized. He began to fight steadily, making his way to the Longevity realm, step by step.However, there was still another obstacle waiting for him in the future\u2026The Golden Immortal Tribulation.Living beings were not allowed to live forever on heaven and earth. One would have to go through the natural processes of birth, old age, sickness and death.If death did not exist, how can life be proven?Unless he had the protection of merit, he would only be able to avoid the Golden Immortal Tribulation if the Heavenly Dao felt that his longevity was beneficial to the stability of the world.If he had negative karma, he would have to face the Heavenly Tribulation, the Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation, and Golden Immortal Tribulation which were all akin to death.Therefore, Li Changshou did not want to be involved with any negative karma. He had to deal with the matter regarding the Sea God of the South Ocean as soon as possible.He would definitely make a few preparations to strengthen himself continuously.Although the Golden Immortal Tribulation was terrifying, and there were very few records about it in various ancient books, and Li Changshou felt that there should still be a limit to its intensity\u2026He would naturally be seventy-percent confident in transcending the tribulation as long as his accumulation of the Dao and his cultivation level surpassed the upper limit of the Heavenly Tribulation.The other thirty percent would depend on the preparations apart from his cultivation level.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dLi Changshou stood in front of the Pill Chamber and sighed softly.At the end of the day, he still had to train hard.\u201cWhen you cultivate, give yourself a little bit of leniency. When you transcend the tribulation, you will have to work hard.\u201dLi Changshou muttered to himself. He felt that that sentence could be written in the succeeding version of the Steadiness Sutra.Li Changshou rode a cloud and slowly flew towards the Heaven-Breaking Peak\u2026It did not matter if others heard what he said.At that moment, his cultivation level was at the eighth-stage of the Void Return realm. It was reasonable for him to be worried about the Immortal Ascension Heavenly Tribulation.was rea\u201cAre you really going to get physical?\u201dDeep in the South Ocean, on the surface of the ocean near an Immortal Island.Ao Yi, who looked like a young man, stood in front of Han Zhi, whose cultivation level was a little higher than his. He raised his head slightly and looked at his three fellow members who were in front of him.On the Immortal Island, many human Qi Refinement cultivators flew into the air and watched the conflict calmly.The cause was actually very simple.Ao Yi and Han Zhi went to the South Ocean to relax. When they arrived at the town of the island, Ao Yi met his cousin, who was hatched from his egg almost at the same time as him \u2014the Second Prince of the South Ocean Dragon Palace. At that moment, three descendants of the dragon who were dressed in brocade clothing and had horns on their heads were standing in front of Ao Yi.The person in the middle was thin and had long and narrow eyes. Although his face was not as handsome as Ao Yi\u2019s, there was something that Ao Yi could not compare to\u2026He had a normal stature and was eight feet tall.He was Ao Mou, the Second Prince of the Dragon Palace in the South Ocean.Ao Mou was the one who mocked Ao Yi and said that he had insulted the Dragon Clan. Ao Yi did not say anything at first. He merely wanted to bring Han Zhi away as he did not want to start a conflict with his race.However, how could Han Zhi see her Uncle-Master suffer any grievances?She ended up provoking the three dragons with one sarcastic remark and two scoldings. She rebutted, disagreed, and they got physical.The onlookers were all talking and scrutinizing. It was very lively!To put it simply, the two parties had a conflict and agreed to fight at sea.When Ao Yi asked Han Zhi if she was really going to get physical, Ao Mou sneered and gestured for his two followers to retreat.Ao Mou\u2019s cultivation level was similar to Ao Yi\u2019s. Their bloodlines were similar, and they were both the sons of the Dragon King.Although Ao Yi had been eliminated once, he had gained quite a lot of benefits from the Jie School.Ao Mou had abstruse mystical abilities. He was going to teach his \u201cSecond Cousin\u201d who had embarrassed the dragon race, a lesson today.At that moment, the two dragons faced each other on the surface of the ocean and started fightingThe battle was quite intense. Both parties were considered rivals, but Ao Yi quickly gained the upper hand and suppressed Ao Mou.However, Ao Mou was not in a hurry. He activated his mystical abilities and instantly disappeared from the surface of the ocean.When he was in the ocean, he would be invincible!Mystical ability: Swimming Dragon Turns into Water!Ao Yi constricted his pupils. He was ready to launch the Black Ice Heavenly Fire around him. He kept his eyes fixed on the surface of the ocean and continuously searched around.He had experienced that feeling before\u2026 All of a sudden, several figures appeared on the surface of the sea. All of them looked like Ao Mou. They raised their spears and swords, and charged at Ao Yi!However, Ao Yi did not panic at all. He suddenly stomped on the surface of the sea, and waves of seawater condensed into an Azure Dragon. It exploded around him and destroyed the figures!Waves appeared on the surface of the sea!At that moment, Ao Yi suddenly leaped to the left. He raised his hand and clenched it. Then, he turned his fist which instinctively hurt the opponent, into his palm!Amidst the rumbling sounds, a few water jets rose from the surface of the sea, making everything even more chaotic.When the rising seawater fell, Ao Yi\u2019s body\u2026At that moment, Ao Yi\u2019s feet were three feet away from the surface of the sea. His long hair, which was tied up, fluttered gently behind his back.He placed his left hand behind his back and extended his right hand to grab Ao Mou\u2019s neck. Then, he lifted Ao Mou up, who was eight feet tall, into the air.Ao Mou\u2019s eyes widened and his voice trembled.\u201cHow\u2026 how did you find my figure\u2026\u201dAo Yi said calmly, \u201cYour mystical abilities are far inferior to that of my good friend\u2019s.\u201dThen, the image of the well-mannered human Qi Refinement cultivator appeared in front of Ao Yi\u2019s eyes again. He casually threw Ao Mou who was in his hand aside.\u201cGo and apologize to my Disciple-Nephew.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
