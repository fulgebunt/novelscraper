    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayReincarnation\u201cMy head really hurts\u2026.\u201dThis was Fang Ming\u2019s first thought upon waking up. It felt as if there was a cut on his head, hurting so badly that it seemed as if his head was about to split open.The scene in front of him seemed like he was riding on a horse carriage. His body continued to bounce up and down along with the carriage\u2019s movement, impacting his wound. It was so painful that Fang Ming had to suck in several sharp breaths.Opening his eyes, he surveyed his surroundings.What filled his vision were walls formed from hollowed planks. There were also quite a few fair-haired and blue-eyed youths sitting around him with their eyes closed as they rested. However, none of them glanced in his direction.He seemed to be lying down on the floor. Feeling the ice-cold ground underneath him, Fang Ming knew that his body would not be able to bear lying down any longer, or he would probably catch a cold. He hurriedly struggled to get up.At that moment, he felt a sharp pain lancing through his head.The pain arrived suddenly, and brought many strange memories along with it. Fang Ming\u2019s eyes rolled back as he fainted.\u201cHi! Leylin! Wake up\u2026.\u201dFang Ming heard this sound in his daze, and couldn\u2019t help but open his eyes.\u201cIs this reincarnation?\u201d Fang Ming remembered very clearly that the last thing he had seen were the dazzling flames that had erupted from the energy reactor\u2019s explosion.It was impossible to survive such an explosion without any method of self-protection.Furthermore, on the planet he existed on, such a style of carriage and wooden planks were considered ancient antiques.After organizing the new memories in his mind, Fang Ming gained some insight about his body and this world.This was a realm similar to the European Middle Ages. A mysterious force also existed.His current body was originally called Leylin Farlier, a son of a minor noble. As he had been tested to have the gift to become a Magus, his father, Viscount John Farlier, had pulled strings to allow him to become a Magus Apprentice. At the moment, he was on the horse carriage travelling towards a magus academy.He saw that the one who had woken him up was a large, male youth.He had thick eyebrows and large eyes, a tall and straight nose, and sparkling gold hair. Although his face was somewhat young and tender, his body was sturdy and well muscled, looking extremely manly.Seeing that Fang Ming had awoken, the boy laughed happily , \u201cHaha\u2026.Leylin, you\u2019re finally awake. If you had awoken even a few more minutes later, you probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to dinner. I assume that you don\u2019t want to starve!\u201dFang Ming lowered his eyes. After some thought, he figured out this person\u2019s identity.\u201cThanks George!\u201dThe youths who were together with him and heading towards the magus academy had all tested to be gifted to be Magi. This George was a legitimate son of a Count, and was also one of the favoured sons for that Count. In order to allow George to enter a magus academy, the Count had spent many resources and pulled strings.\u201cA count?\u201d Fang Ming inwardly thought.He flashed back to his current body\u2019s father, Viscount John Farlier, whose holdings were equal in size to a city in his previous life, with thousands of soldiers under his command. In this world, noble ranking was inevitably tied to personal strength. Since George\u2019s father was a Count, his holdings were likely at least the size of several cities, and his annual income was probably a few thousand gold coins. With such finances and power at his disposal, he still had to take so much effort in order to send George to a magus academy. Fang Ming couldn\u2019t help but wonder how did his father manage to do the same for him.As Fang Ming pondered the question, another sharp pain flashed through his head, causing another scene to appear in his mind\u2019s eye.It was a dark room, with old musty shelves lining the sides, filled with an ancient air. The surroundings were chock full with dust.Under a dim light, John Farlier solemnly passed a ring to Leylin, saying: \u201cDear Leylin, this is our Farlier Family\u2019s Heirloom Treasure, a promise from a Magus. At that time, my grandfather had helped an injured Magus, who had in return gifted grandfather with this ring, promising him that if one of his descendants had the gift to be a Magus, he could use this ring and enter any magus academy for free! Now, I am giving this to you, in hopes that you can be the Pride of the Farlier Family, and uphold our legacy\u2026\u201dThe ring!!!Fang Ming\u2019s eyes narrowed, and his right hand involuntarily went to his chest.Under his clothing, he could feel the solid touch, like a metal ring was under there.Heaving a sigh of relief in his heart, he thought to himself: Lucky! I\u2019m not sure if those guys did not recognize it as a treasure, or perhaps there is some restriction. Either way, I\u2019m lucky that this was not snatched from me!\u201dAs a scientist in his former life, Fang Ming was extremely curious and interested in that mysterious strength, filled with the desire to research more about it.Furthermore, he didn\u2019t want to be chased back home because he had lost such an important proof of entry.Although I have taken over this body and accepted its memories, but I am still very different from the original Leylin. To his family members who have spent years with him, they would easily be able to see the difference! If they mistake it as him being possessed by the devil and perhaps beg or hire one of those mysterious magi to investigate, I might be found out\u2026However, if I can enter a magus academy, I will probably not return home for at least several years. By that time, if there are any changes in behavior, it would be considered normal. Furthermore, to be a Magus, it is probably normal to be strange and eccentric; if I were to act the same as the Leylin of before, it would be deemed strange then!Just as he was in deep thought, a pair of strong large hands suddenly assisted him to his feet.\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d George asked.\u201cNo\u2026 Nothing!\u201d Fang Ming quickly shook his head, then clutched his head again, as it was still in pain.He suddenly spun his head around and looked at George, causing George\u2019s heart to clutch suddenly, as if he was being stared at by a venomous snake.\u201cDearest George, why didn\u2019t you wake me up earlier, and let me just lie on the floor like that for so long?\u201d Fang Ming rolled his eyes and asked.\u201cHeh heh! I saw you having such a nice sleep, and thought you liked to lie down there!\u201d George scratched his head abashedly. However, his eyes sparked with a cunning gleam.Under Fang Ming\u2019s murderous glare, he finally raised his hands in surrender: \u201cFine! Fine! Who asked you to offend my goddess. Offending her is still fine, as bros, I am not such a petty person. Alas, the entire carriage is now treating you like an enemy, and I do not want to be isolated as well!\u201d\u201cOffend? Goddess?\u201d Fang Ming scratched his head, until he suddenly remembered why he was beaten up.It was a girl named Bessita. Although she was only 15 years of age, but she her body was already developed and voluptuous, in addition to her watery big eyes, was a huge draw to the lecherous Leylin.The original Leylin was no gentleman. He had lost his virginity at the age of twelve, and after that he had either seduced or forced his way with many others, and had by now slept with more than a hundred women!He had been known as the Scourge of his father\u2019s holdings. As Fang Ming finished exploring the memories, he rolled his eyes once again in disdain. No wonder this body was so weak and frail, it wasn\u2019t just because of the injuries!Thinking back, it was clear that Leylin had been too used to causing trouble in his own territory, and hadn\u2019t been able to control himself when he saw Bessita.The first few times, it was still rather normal; flirting and making passes. Near the end, he had started resorting to violent means. When Fang Ming saw these memories, he couldn\u2019t help but label the original as an idiot.That Bessita is a princess of a small country! And Leylin\u00a0still wanted to rape her. Is his brains filled with glue? Sheesh!What happened after this goes without saying. Leylin was taught a savage lessons by the bunch of \u2018Flower Guardians\u2019 [1. Literal Translation of \u62a4\u82b1\u4f7f\u8005, pretty much her wannabe escorts/protectors], had actually died because of the beatings, which had eventually benefitted Fang Ming.Heh heh! This Bessita, it seems she isn\u2019t as simple as I thought, how scheming! Fang Ming gave a cold laugh as he thought.Fine! No matter what, since I have taken over your body, if I have the chance, I will take revenge for you! As for now, I am Leylin Farlier!Fang Ming swore in his heart.In Leylin\u2019s memory, he had not seen any signs of Asians, nor had he heard anything about China. In this new Western styled world, if he used his own Chinese name, it would be too dangerous!When he looked around, he realized that there was no longer anyone else in sight within the spacious carriage. It was no wonder that George had come to call him.\u201cNo matter what, I still have to thank you! George, do you have any medicine?\u201d Fang Ming stood up and stretched his body. Although it still hurt in a few places, but it did not impede his movement, and the wound at the back of his head had already became a scab.\u201cHeh heh\u2026I knew that you\u2019d need this!\u201d George laughed as he tossed a small bottle over, \u201cThis is my family\u2019s secret product. I heard that it\u2019s usually used during Knight\u2019s training, and is extremely effective against any bodily injuries!\u201dAs George spoke, he looked around furtively: \u201cAlright! Dinner is about to start. I\u2019m going to head there first, you should apply the medicine quickly and hurry over too. Remember, do not tell anyone else about our friendship!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he had ran off like a gust of wind!Looking at George\u2019s figure disappear into the distance, Leylin couldn\u2019t help but massage his forehead. It looks like this Leylin has truly stirred up a hornet\u2019s nest. Was it such a big deal? In Leylin\u2019s memories, it seems like in this world, sexual relations are rather open\u2026At this point, he couldn\u2019t do anything to remedy the situation. Swiftly taking off his clothes, Leylin quickly rubbed the medicine all over the injuries on his body.\u201cHiss\u2026 This damned George. Couldn\u2019t he help me apply the medicine before leaving?\u201d Leylin drew several sharp cold breaths as he applied the medicine.The medicine was extremely effective. As soon as he applied it, there was a cooling sensation and the pain vanished.After he had dealt with the wounds on his body, Leylin put on his clothes and opened the carriage door.Whoosh!!!A gentle breeze blew across, and the sun was setting in the horizon, painting everything around with a golden hue.\u201cNo matter what, it feels so good to be alive!!!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes moistened as he muttered.Looking at the surroundings, he noticed several of the large carriages forming a circle to make a crude temporary campsite, with a large fire in the middle.There were many youths around the fire, sitting and resting on cloth mats laid on the ground, laughing and playing with each other, while eating the bread in their hands.Leylin walked towards a table where there were quite a few breads and juices placed. According to his memories, this was where food was distributed.When he approached the area, he saw that there were a few people queuing up. As they spotted Leyin, they looked over at him with a look of despise.Although Leylin thought of himself as thick-skinned, he still found it somewhat difficult to endure.Still, he did not leave. No matter what, he still had to eat.\u201cHurry up!\u201d A hoarse voice rang out.\u201cSo\u2026Sorry! Lady Angelia!\u201d A freckled boy quickly apologised and took his share of food before running away.[Beep! Danger Alert! Danger Alert!][You are extremely close to the source of danger.

Chip from my previous life? How did it reincarnate with me? This is unscientific!!!\u201dLeylin found it hard to believe. He said in his brain, \u201cA.I. Chip! Scan my mind and search for locations of assistant systems!\u201d[Beep! Scan complete! No strange existences were found in the Host\u2019s mind!]After a mere moment, the A.I. Chip\u2019s mechanical voice replied back.\u201cNow scan my entire body, and display my body\u2019s stats!\u201dAnother mechanical sound.[Beep! Scan complete!][Fang Ming (Leylin Farlier). Strength: 0.4, Agility: 0.5, Constitution: 0.4, Status: Bleeding from back of the head, many injuries to the soft tissues][No A.I. Chips present in the Host\u2019s body!]A 3D hologram appeared before Leylin\u2019s eyes. It displayed Leylin\u2019s own body, and showed stats on the side.\u201cNo A.I. Chip? I know the A.I. Chip is equivalent to a material substance. How did it follow my soul through reincarnation? Leylin thought to himself, It seems like during the explosion or my reincarnation, some abnormality occurred, and the A.I. Chip\u2019s functions fused with my soul\u2026..\u201d\u201cIf I was still in my previous world, this would be a major discovery! It not only confirms the existence of the soul, but also shows that physical matter and the soul can possibly transform each other! This is definitely something that group of old men in National Academy of Sciences would go crazy over. It\u2019s a pity that I\u2019ll never see them again!\u201dThis kind of A.I. Chip was essential to the scientists in the previous world. Because of issues with human rights and the conscious thought, this technology didn\u2019t have any intelligence of its own. It only had two functions: to analyze and to store information.Its analyzing ability could only be used by following the Host\u2019s commands. It gathered data samples and reached a deduction based on simulations.Its storage abilities were even simpler. It could use the data gathered from everything the Host\u2019s five senses experienced and record it down. Based on calculations from the previous world, this kind of A.I. Chip\u2019s storage area was enough to record over 10,000 years\u2019 worth of events.\u201cWhy did the A.I. Chip and the soul fuse together? I\u2019ll ponder this kind of question later when I have the ability and qualifications to do so! But with this A.I. Chip, I have some resources in this world!\u201dThe corners of Leylin\u2019s mouth suddenly lifted to form a brilliant smile. He knew that in this Middle Ages period, having a crystallization of future technology would definitely make his future path extraordinary!!!\u201cBut! This Leylin\u2019s physique is really\u2026\u201d Leylin was speechless after seeing the stats in front of him.This stats displayed were based off of each aspect of an adult\u2019s physiology as a standard. Theoretically, the average adult\u2019s displayed stats would all be around 1. Although this Leylin was only 13-14 years old, his stats were still too low.\u201cHm? That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s possible that the bodies of the people in this world are generally weaker! A.I. Chip, scan the bodies of the people around me and display their stats!\u201d[Beep! Task established! Beginning the collection of stats!]In almost an instant, 3D holograms of the surrounding people\u2019s bodies appeared in front of Leylin, displaying their stats.[Name: Unknown. Gender: Male. Strength: 0.9, Agility: 1.1, Constitution: 0.8][Name: Unknown. Gender: Male. Strength: 1.2 Agility: 0.8, Constitution: 1.0][Name: Unknown. Gender: Female. Strength: 0.8, Agility: 1.2, Constitution: 0.7]\u201cWell then! It looks like the bodies of these people are stronger than those from my previous world. This Leylin is even inferior to a girl\u2026..I\u2019m starting to feel embarrassed for him\u2026..\u201dLeylin scanned his surroundings. The people were all youths around his age. There was a seemingly very delicate and frail girl whose stats were tons better than Leylin\u2019s, causing him to feel utter despair.\u201cIt looks like this Leylin is a useless leech, an excessively lecherous piece of trash with no control!\u201d[Name: Unknown, Gender: Male, Strength: 3.3, Agility: 2.5, Constitution: 3.2. Alert! Alert! This life form is excessively dangerous. Recommendation: Host should immediately move at least 1000 meters away!!!]A red warning continued to flash 3 times in succession. This caused\u00a0 Leylin to fall into a state of shock.\u201cAverage stats of 3.0!\u201d After Leylin scanned the information several times to double check that the A.I. Chip hadn\u2019t made a mistake, he was left completely speechless.\u201cEven the world champion doesn\u2019t have these kind of stats. In the previous world, this person could easily dress up as Superman!\u201dAs a scientist, Leylin understood well that a stat of 3.2 meant the person\u2019s fighting capabilities, viral resistance, and body recovery speed was all three times greater than a normal person\u2019s!!!The various stats displayed being threefold greater than a typical person\u2019s wasn\u2019t as simple as just adding numbers together. What kind of concept was this?It meant that this person could defeat dozens of people empty-handed, and even get past a group attack by 100 people. In his previous world, he really counted as a Superman!\u201cI\u2019m afraid that a person with these kinds of stats could only be created by genetically modifying their biochemistry in a lab. Moreover, only the minimum would be reached! This world is indeed not a simple one!\u201dLeylin thought to himself as he looked at the person possessing these terrifying stats once again.It was a black-clothed person responsible for handing out food. He looked like he was middle-aged, and he had a scar on his face that stretched from his forehead to his lip. It pretty much split his entire face in half, and looked extremely fierce.The freckled boy from before was completely frightened by this person.\u201cThis is the academy\u2019s servant responsible for receiving us. It\u2019s said that he\u2019s not a magus, yet he\u2019s already so frightening. What would a real magus be like then?\u201dLeylin suddenly discovered that a strong interest and curiosity about the profession of a magus had arisen inside him. It was to the point where he was itching to go to the academy now and investigate everything.The line was really short, and it was soon Leylin\u2019s turn. After the black-clothed, scarred man gave Leylin a piece of white bread and some juice, he wordlessly waved Leylin away with an impatient expression on his face.If it were the previous Leylin, even if he didn\u2019t dare to drag this guy out and lash him a few times because it wasn\u2019t his home, his expression still would\u2019ve turned quite ugly, and would probably have ranted at the man a bit.But the current Leylin was naturally not that stupid. Following his memories, he formally bowed and said, \u201cThank you! Mister!\u201dThe black-clothed man remained expressionless as he watched Leylin turn to leave.\u201cAi! I didn\u2019t think that Leylin would really seem like a noble after bowing!\u201d The two youths behind Leylin couldn\u2019t help but secretly whisper to each other.\u201cHurry up and move forwards!\u201d The scarred man shouted, suddenly blasting the two\u2019s eardrums.The great sound scared one of the youths so badly that he fell down onto the ground.Leylin ignored the discussion behind him as he surveyed the area with a cold gaze. He then bitterly smiled, \u201cGreat! I\u2019m really an unwelcomed person!\u201dWhen he looked at George, George also hurriedly turned his head away. His hands made a secret gesture behind his back.\u201cEh! Fine! Since you gave me the medicine, I won\u2019t expose you!\u201d Leylin sighed, then found a relatively remote place. Without caring whether or not the ground was carpeted, he sat down and began to eat heartily.\u201cThis plain white bread isn\u2019t as good as that from the previous world! But according to Leylin\u2019s memories, this is already considered a food that one can only get during celebrations!\u201dLeylin thought as he ate.Based on Leylin\u2019s memories, the production capabilities in this world were quite low. The white bread was an aristocrat\u2019s food. Normal, minor nobles could only enjoy it during celebrations of major holidays.To typical peasants, who only had hard, nutritionless black bread to eat, this was a supreme delicacy.When he thought of the black bread as hard as rocks from his memories, Leylin sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m quite fortunate; regardless of whether I\u2019m a noble or a magus, I\u2019m still in the upper levels of this world, so I won\u2019t need to suffer!\u201dHe ravenously wolfed down the bread, and downed the juice in one gulp as well. Leylin then wiped his mouth in satisfaction, and returned to the carriage.Based on the experience in his memory, noble youths would set up tents in camp and rest for the entire night before moving again. However, it was clear that nobody would invite Leylin to join them. He didn\u2019t have a tent himself, so he could only sleep on the cold and hard carriage!\u201cWhen I looked just now, there seemed to be 50 some apprentices, 25 black robes, and 3 of the highest status white robes!\u201dWhen he thought of the the scene just now when he had been noticed from a distance, the hairs on Leylin\u2019s body rose.Added on to that, the A.I. Chip\u2019s warnings of [Discovered an unknown radiation source!], [Received disturbance from unknown force field, impossible to scan!]This formed a shadow in Leylin\u2019s heart!\u201cIt looks like even with the A.I. Chip, I\u2019m still extremely weak in this world! But it\u2019s precisely due to this reason that I desire to obtain the strength of a Magus!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes seemed to light up in flames.\u201cIt\u2019s best if I sleep earlier! I still need to hurry on with the journey tomorrow!\u201dLeylin took off his jacket and laid it on the ground to make his sleeping more comfortable.\u201cSo far, since this journey was started, it\u2019s already been over 3 months. We\u2019ve passed through a few dozen kingdoms, yet we still haven\u2019t reached our objective. These ancient transportation conditions are really\u2026..\u201dHe closed his eyes and fell into a daze. After some time, the carriage door opened with a bang.Leylin suddenly sat up. His nose was then filled with the scent of a rose.It was sweet and aromatic, extremely pleasing to the nose. It also made his body throb as to invoked his memories.\u201cLey\u2026Leylin! Are you well?\u201d A pleasant, female voice said.\u201cBessita? Please come in!\u201d Leylin moved his body.The fragrant scent in the carriage suddenly grew more powerful as a beautiful young girl entered.She had fair skin, and wore red, tight-fitting clothes that accentuated her voluptuous curves.What was even harder for Leylin to forget was this girl\u2019s platinum hair and eyes like crimson jewels. Combined with her beautiful face, it presented an exotic charm.This was the girl that caused Leylin to be beaten up, and even lose his life, Bessita!\u201cMay I ask if you have anything to ask me?\u201d Although this girl had developed quite well, and seemed extremely enticing to Leylin, having come from a different world and experiencing an endless barrage (of beauties), this girl was only somewhat good-looking to Fang Ming.His attitude was extremely cold and indifferent.It was clear that this manner somewhat shocked the young girl, as the words she was about to say didn\u2019t leave her mouth.After a long period of silence, she pulled out a small, glass bottle and placed it in Leylin\u2019s hands, \u201cThis\u2026 this is a medicine for injuries. If you apply it to your body, it\u2019ll help you! I\u2019m\u2026 sorry!\u201dThe girl bowed, revealing the ample, snow-white curves of her chest, causing Leylin\u2019s heart to race.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there something wrong with your brain?\u201dHe touched the bottle in his hand, thinking to himself: \u201cDid I misjudge her earlier? Could this Bessita be a kind-hearted girl?\u201dLeylin studied the glass bottle in his hand curiously. \u201cIt seems like they already have the technology to produce glass. Although, judging by the workmanship, it still seems rather rough, it is quite decent already!\u201dAs he opened the bottle cap, a medicinal fragrance wafted out.Following the habits of his past life, Leylin immediately said: \u201cA.I Chip! Scan this medicine and analyse its components!\u201d[Beep! Task Established! Begin Scan!][Discovered unknown components. Starting simulated experiments!][Experiments complete! Unknown Medicine has effect of strong itching! Duration: 7 days!]\u201cEh!\u201d Looking at the results of the experiment, Leylin was struck speechless. \u201cI retract my previous statement; that girl is rather blackhearted!\u201dHowever, he soon had the feeling of an adult being pranked by a naughty kid.\u201cShe is still a child after all! She can\u2019t use truly malicious tricks! Perhaps if it were a few years ahead, the bottle would be full of deadly poison instead!\u201dLooking at the bottle in hand, Leylin thought about it and decided to keep it. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep this for now, who knows when it might come into handy in the future!\u201dAfter Bessita left, no one else came to disturb him.Leylin lay back down. Though it seemed as if he were sleeping, his mind was actually working in overdrive as he thought through things.\u201cIt seems like there shouldn\u2019t be any problems or risks of being found out by going to a magus academy. Those white robed figures should be Magi, and I have walked by them a few times without drawing attention. It seems like they are also unable to detect anything strange about me. This means\u2026 entering a magus academy should be relatively easy in that sense.\u201d\u201cHowever, according to rumours, Magi are all secretive and cruel, at least according to what Viscount John heard. It also seems that in the academies, there is extremely fierce competition amongst the apprentices of the same level despite it being against the rules to kill one another. I need to at least have some form of self-protection.\u201dAs he thought about that, he once again touched the ring hung around his neck, and held it in his hands.The ring was jet black and nondescript. Within the inner ring, there was a small \u2018Y\u2019 inscribed, along with elaborate inscriptions around it.\u201cWith the technological advancements of the Middle Ages, to be able to inscribe such a complicated pattern onto the inner ring is incomprehensible! However, regardless of the issue, as long as it has to do with the mysterious Magi, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising at all!\u201dLeylin muttered to himself, and issued another command: \u201cA.I Chip! Scan the ring in my hands!\u201d[Beep! Task Established! Begin Scan!][Discovered unknown metallic components. Comparing to Data Banks. Insufficient Data. Unable to analyse!]\u201cAs I\u2019d thought! With the A.I Chip\u2019s current level, it is still inadequate to analyse something that a Magus left behind!\u201d Leylin sighed and stored the ring.\u201cHow can I increase my power? This body of mine is truly too weak! It cannot even compare to those of the same age. That will not do.\u201d\u201cIf it were my past life, I could still undergo genetic modification. Alas, there is no such option here. Perhaps I should explore this Leylin\u2019s memory once again, and see if there are any methods\u2026\u201dLeylin thought to himself once again, then found a comfortable spot to lie down, thinking out aloud in his mind: \u201cA.I Chip! Scan the entirety of Leylin\u2019s memory and arrange it!\u201d[Beep! Task Established! Starting arrangement!]In Leylin\u2019s former world, the world of science had always been of the opinion that the majority of the human brain\u2019s power was not being harnessed. Amongst that power was the ability to access every memory since birth.Some memories, even if the person in question could not recall them, were actually still stored somewhere in the brain!Now, as Leylin gave the command, memories of Leylin\u2019s entire life, from birth to his being chosen as a Magus Apprentice and going on this journey, were all displayed in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes with the A.I Chip\u2019s assistance.Every single memory, down to what was eaten in every meal, as well as their tastes, were retained and displayed in his mind.Such a large mass of memory was just too confusing, and was also full of useless information. In the past, Leylin had only taken what he had urgently needed, and ignored the rest.At this point, with the help of the A.I Chip, he was arranging and sorting everything out![Data sorting has been completed!] The A.I Chip notification sounded out.\u201cCreate a new file, named \u2018Leylin Farlier\u2019, and save it!\u201d Leylin gave a new order.[Beep! File created \u2013 Leylin Farlier!]\u201cNew task, search the file for all possible methods for the host to improve strength quickly!\u201d[Beep! Task Established. Begin Search!]In front of Leylin, innumerable amounts of data flashed past, seemingly forming a beautiful picture.[Search Complete! Search Results \u2013 453 methods!]\u201cSo many?\u201d Leylin paused a while as he thought. \u201cRemove those with estimated success rate of 50% and below for the Host. Also, add another requirement: The Host must be able to carry out the strengthening method now. Begin filter!\u201d[Beep! Filter Complete. Remaining methods: 2!]\u201cShow them to me!\u201d[Method 1: Become a Magus.][Method 2: Begin Knight Trainng]\u201cOh! Method 1 is not realistic at the moment; at least, not until I reach the magus academy, Otherwise, how could I possibly learn how to become a Magus? As for the Knight Training, I wonder what that is?\u201dAs Leylin muttered to himself, he immediately assigned a new task. \u201cA.I Chip, assemble all memory regarding Knight Training. Once it has been arranged properly, send it into my memory!\u201dAfter the data was directly transmitted to his brain, Leylin began to understand what a so-called Knight was.In this world, there were several mysterious forces. However, the ones commoners had the most experience with were Knights!Knights were warriors who had gone through tough training and had stimulated their inner life energy. Their physical attributes were way beyond that of a normal human.To be a Magus, it required a specific kind of gift, and amongst tens of thousands of people, it was possible that there wasn\u2019t even one such person. However, being a Knight was different; as long as they were willing to put in the effort, anyone could become a Knight!For these Knights, not only were their physical attributes several times that of normal humans, they were also well versed in using various weaponry, as well as in the killing arts. Some Knights even had special secret skills that could unleash a sudden burst of power!The kingdoms of the common world, along with the nobility, were generally made up of Knights.The Farlier Family which Leylin was part of was also a Knight Family. The original founder of the Family had fought in wars together with the King, and had accomplished much meritorious service. Thus, they had been awarded with the Viscount title, as well corresponding holdings.After an overall sweep of the information, Leylin remembered a scene from the past.It was a small jungle in the Viscount holdings, and John Farlier was wearing a warrior\u2019s outfit with a stern expression on his face. He was facing the infant Leylin as he said: \u201cToday, I will teach you the Secret Skill that has been passed down in the Farlier Family: the Cross Blade Technique and the accompanying breathing techniques. You must remember that you can never teach this to anyone outside our Family!\u201d At that moment, Viscount John\u2019s face held an unprecedented stern look!Alas, Leylin was still an infant at that point, and obviously did not put much thought into the matter, thus eventually forgetting it. Viscount John tried to force him into training a few times, but Leylin was so afraid of suffering and fatigue thata while, even Viscount John had to give up.\u201cSigh\u2026 an overly compassionate father leads to a failure of a son!\u201d Only now did Leylin realise how the previous body\u2019s owner had became such a spoilt brat.*TLN \u2013 Spare the rod and spoil the childAlthough the young Leylin only knew how to act like a playboy and had totally forgotten everything about the Knight Training for the Family Secret Skill, Leylin managed to recover all of it with the help of the A.I Chip.Cross Blade Basic Sword Style: Horizontal Slash, Vertical Slash, Piercing Attack, Slanted Slash\u2026Footwork: Advance, Retreat, Dodge\u2026There was also the accompanying breathing technique. All of it appeared clearly in Leylin\u2019s mind, along with the experience that Viscount John had imparted.The memory finally ended with Viscount John emitting white mist from his mouth as he manipulated his Cross Blade, and splitting a rock as large as a millstone in two with a single cleave!\u201cHm\u2026 a Knight is considered the lowest mysterious power, yet they are already so strong! What kind of existence are those Magi who are high above Knights?\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes burned with a fiery passion.\u201cSigh! I have to take things step by step. I had better concentrate on this Knight\u2019s breathing technique first! Anyways, the Knight Training does not clash with Magus training. At least I\u2019ll have some measure of self defense for now.\u201dAfter a detailed analysis, Leylin discovered that the so-called breathing technique of this world was very similar to the internal qigong of his previous world, but was a lot more crude. It was very dependant on external stimulations to activate the inner life energy.\u201cAccording to rumours, if a warrior goes through the Knight Training and is still unable to activate their inner life energy, the only option is to enter the battlefield and go through fierce and bloody battles. This is the only other way to trigger their inner life energy, and become a Knight!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip, transfer the knowledge of the Cross Blade Technique to me!\u201d Leylin issued his next order.Soon after, a large amount of knowledge regarding the technique was transferred directly into his mind. It was etched deeply into his brain, as if he had been training in it since he was young.\u201cIsolate the Cross Blade Technique and save it into a new file, with the filename of \u2018Cross Blade Technique Basics\u2019!\u201d[Saved New File: \u2018Cross Blade Technique Basics\u2019]As the A.I Chip notification sounded out in his mind, Leylin\u2019s lips curved in a smile. With the help of the A.I Chip, his learning speed was unbelievably quick \u2013 fast enough to make any so-called genius commit suicide from shame!\u201cNow that I have all the memories of it, it is just a matter of finding a Cross Blade, and going through some actual practice. If all goes well, I have confidence in mastering it within ten days, bringing myself to Viscount John\u2019s level!\u201dAll these sword techniques are merely killing arts. The most important thing for Knight Training is the accompanying breathing technique!\u201d Leylin muttered to himself.\u201cA.I Chip! According to my statistics, simulate and create the best model for me to start training the breathing technique!\u201d[Beep! Task Established! Host human model established! Begin simulation\u2026]As the mechanical voice sounded out, a 3D model of a human figure appeared in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes. It was transparent and shimmering in blue light, and appeared exactly the same as him \u2013 a 13 year old youth with Western features, brown hair, big eyes and bushy eyebrows.The 3D figure repeatedly started training the breathing technique, constantly adjusting the frequency, rate and magnitude. Slowly, a red line could be seen moving around in the 3D figure\u2019s body.After a few minutes, the simulation ended, and the A.I Chip\u2019s mechanical voice sounded out once more.[Simulation ended. Cross Blade Accompanying Breathing Technique \u2013 Time required for one revolution: 30 Minutes. 10 Revolutions will improve the Host\u2019s body by 0.05 Strength, 0.06 Agility and 0.03 Vitality. The improvements will gradually lessen as the stats improve!Warning: If the Host goes through long term training of this technique, it will result in residual damage caused to the Host Body. Recommendation to think twice before starting.]\u201cPhew! This is indeed an impressive Knight Training technique! As long as I persevere, I will quickly be able to improve my power! Alas, I wonder if there is any way to remove the effect of the residual damage?\u201dLeylin said with a faint smile.At this time, the A.I Chip\u2019s voice suddenly sounded out.[Do you wish to optimise the Breathing Technique? Y/N]\u201cThe A.I Chip actually has such abilities?\u201d A joyful look rose on Leylin\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded out right on time.[The optimisation for the breathing technique has been completed. Time taken for breathing technique, 5 minutes 23 seconds, and the effects have all risen by 5%! The side effects of the injuries have vanished!]\u201cVery good!\u201d This result made Leylin very satisfied.If the effect was a 5% increase each time, then dozens of times, and even hundreds of times, would result in huge differences.\u201cRumor has it that the Cross Blade Technique and the breathing technique were obtained by the founder after dozens of bloody battles, where he finally obtaining it from the corpse of a Knight. Amongst the many Knight families, it is considered to be the upper middle grade!\u201d\u201cAfter the optimization of the breathing technique done by the A.I Chip, I\u2019m afraid it might even be comparable to the secret scroll techniques of those smaller kingdoms!\u201dLeylin quietly pondered, and immediately said in an impatient manner: \u201cA.I Chip, transfer the optimized breathing technique to the memory zone!\u201dThe A.I Chip chip duly carried out its orders, and brought large amounts of images depicting the breathing technique back to Leylin\u2019s mind.After a few minutes of transfer, Leylin gently rubbed his head: \u201cI feel a little giddy, but this is a normal occurrence!\u201dRight now his brain was filled with large amounts of memories about the breathing technique, and the many matching sequences of practised experience. Compared to an average person, he did not have to go on the roundabout route.\u201cI did not feel it in my previous life, but in this world, the A.I Chip really gives me a huge advantage compared to an average person!\u201dLeylin mumbled on: \u201cWith this A.I Chip\u2019s ability to simulate and analyse, I am able to obtain the same result as a person who has to go through 10 years of hard work and experience, \u00a0I only have to do exactly what the A.I Chip has presented, and I will be able to do things in the most accurate manner!\u201dThe breathing technique had many contradictions, and some of them required more than verbal explanation to be understood.One had to go through the experience of training, and go along some complicated paths., Only then would they be able to gain enlightenment.But these things could all be avoided with the A.I Chip\u2019s analysing abilities.\u201cI\u2019ll give it a try!\u201d Leylin thought, and his body laid on the floor in the shape of a cross.According to the suggestions on the breathing technique which was presented by the A.I Chip, there was no need to have any special actions to complement it, but just to find the most suitable and comfortable position.\u201cFirst, I must hold my breath for 65 seconds, then take three long and one short breaths. The duration and frequency must be\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin followed the description of the breathing technique, and gradually entered a state of cultivation.He looked unconscious; his face was bright red and his temples throbbed, as if carrying out some kind of exercise.As time passed, Leylin\u2019s face grew redder, and eventually, he began to perspire out some faint black coloured fluid.After he had maintained this process for over 20 minutes, Leylin opened both of his eyes, and opened his mouth to exhale.Phew! ! !A black coloured breath was exhaled just like this.Within his body, some cracking noises could be made out.Leylin stood up and moved his four limbs. His whole body was warm, as if he had just undergone a vigorous exercise.\u201cA.I Chip, display my body\u2019s statistics!\u201d Leylin ordered.[Leylin Farlier. Strength: 0.4 Agility: 0.5 Vitality: 0.4 State: Mild injury]Leylin remained impassive: \u201cChange the method of display, and move the data back by 10 decimal points. Also make comparisons with the data before the cultivation.\u201dWith Leylin\u2019s orders, the image flickered, and the body statistics had shown 10 more decimal points. The last three numbers had not stop changing.[Beep! After comparison, undergoing the Knight Training increases the Host\u2019s Strength by 0.005, Agility by 0.006, and Vitality by 0.004]The A.I Chip faithfully relayed the message.\u201cMn! Because this was the first practice, the figures are still climbing up!\u201d Leylin analyzed and said.\u201cI\u2019ve only cultivated for a bit over 20 minutes, but, the data\u2019s increase is already rather considerable. With perseverance, it\u2019s just a matter of time before I have the stats of a black robed man!\u201d\u201cWhich is to say, those ten odd black robed men are all Knights!\u201dLeylin thought indifferently, \u201cWhat a pity. According to my memory and the A.I Chip analysis, breathing techniques have cultivation limits. The Farlier Family\u2019s breathing technique can only be practiced once a day. Additional practice will not only have no additional benefits, but will even cause harm to the body!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip, are there any methods to let me increase the number of times I can practice the breathing technique?\u201d Leylin asked.[Medicinal items are required as a supplement.] The A.I Chip feedbacked.\u201cList all the necessary medicinal items!\u201d[Quinoline element, marco 21, magnesium dioxide\u2026\u2026] The A.I Chip chip listed a whole bunch of medicinal items, which were all from Leylin\u2019s previous life.\u201cIs it possible to substitute any of them them with other medicinal items or herbs?\u201d This seemed to be an obviously impossible task, but Leylin furrowed his brows and asked anyway.[A sample is needed to analyse the medicinal properties. As of now, the data is insufficient!] The A.I Chip chip prompted.\u201cAs long as there is a way, then it\u2019s alright!\u201d Leylin heaved a sigh of relief.He looked at his own body again. Because large amounts of sticky substance had been produced after the breathing technique training, his body felt very sticky, which was extremely uncomfortable to the touch.Leylin frowned: \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to wash up first!\u201dHe began to make his way out of the horse carriage. It was midnight by this hour, and the various young nobles were all sleeping soundly in the tent. Leylin quietly stepped out of the carriage and ran towards a small river that was nearby.[Warning! A human is approaching!] The A.I Chip prompted.Leylin pretended that he was oblivious, and continued his advances.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d A voice rang behind Leylin.\u201cSo fast!\u201d Leylin pupils shrank, \u201cI had already been aware, but I was still unable to discover that he had arrived behind me. If he has any bad intentions, then I definitely won\u2019t be able to resist in any way!\u201dOn the surface, he still pretended to be scared out of his wits: \u201cAh\u2026\u2026Who? Who?\u201dLeylin turned around his body to look back, seeing the black robed man who had been distributing the rations earlier in the day. Leylin remembered his name to be Angelo.\u201cHel\u2026..Hello! Sir Angelo! I feel that I\u2019m a little dirty, and wanted to wash myself!\u201d Leylin face was pale, as if he was frightened, and did not even have the capabilities to speak properly.\u201cWash yourself?\u201d The black robed man furrowed his brows, and wrinkled his nose. He could indeed smell a stench coming from Leylin.\u201cAlright! It is rather dangerous here at night, especially for young nobles like you bunch! Return quickly after washing!\u201dThe black robed Angelo said. Not paying anymore mind to Leylin, he turned around and walked towards the heart of the horse carriage, where his tent was.\u201cThank you for your reminders! Sir Angelo!\u201d Leylin still said with a bow, no matter whether this man had heard him or not.Always being careful had been part of his principles in life.After seeing Angelo leave completely, Leylin then strode forward and headed towards the small river.Angelo walked into his own tent and pulled down his mask, exposing his scarred face.\u201cThe substance expelled from the body after practicing Knight breathing technique? What a nostalgic feeling! Looking at these young people reminds me of my inexperienced self from the past!\u201d\u201cWhat a pity though, if I was also born of nobility, I wouldn\u2019t need to practice the Knight breathing technique. I had even risked being part of a magus\u2019s experiment and ended up in this state\u2026\u2026\u201dAngelo muttered. His shadow and the tent overlapped into one body, in-differentiable from each other.Along the way, Leylin casually plucked the wild flowers and plants and popped them into his mouth from time to time.\u201cI think that black robed Angelo must have realised something. But it doesn\u2019t matter, a nobility practising a passed down Knight breathing technique is just a normal occurrence.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, he already has the physical qualities of a Knight, so he definitely has his own breathing technique, and won\u2019t need to get mine. Besides, even if he wanted it, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. I can just write it down and give him a copy\u2026\u201dSince there was such a large difference in strength, Leylin did not have any intention of protecting the secrets of the Farlier Family.However, it seemed that Angelo did not even fancy the Knight breathing techniques from small noble families.Chewing a grass stalk in his mouth, there was a bitter taste to it. However Leylin did not mind, and even had some nostalgic feelings of back when he was little.[The analysis is completed, no beneficial properties towards the Host\u2019s body can be observed!] The A.I Chip voice rang.\u201cPui!\u201d Leylin immediately spit out the grass stalk in his mouth, and replaced it with another plant.\u201cTake down the shape and qualities of the plant earlier and save it. Now we will proceed with another round of analysis!\u201d Leylin commanded in his mind.[The task is completed! Beginning to analyse the qualities! From this experiment\u2026\u2026] As the scene played out in his mind, Leylin could see very clearly the procedures of the A.I Chip.[Beep! The experiment is completed. This unnamed plant has a mild paralysis effect!]\u201cAccording to Leylin\u2019s memories, this is called the Tri-Night Grass huh, A.I Chip! Rename to Tri-Night Grass, and save it inside the database!\u201d[Beep! Saving completed!]\u201cMmn! This is \u2018Red Fruit\u2019, the taste is not bad!\u201d Leylin plucked a bunch of fruits on a pile of shrubs.These fruits were only the size of Leylin\u2019s thumb, and they had ripened on the top of a barbed vine. Their appearances were quite beautiful.Leylin carefully avoided the barbs, and plucked one of the Red Fruits.He placed it into his mouth and bit down with a crisp noise. A sweet juice was squeezed out from the fruit, filling his mouth.\u201cMm! The taste is the same as an apple\u2019s, just a tad sweeter.\u201d Leylin evaluated.\u201cA.I Chip! Analyse\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Along the way, Leylin saved data about over 30 kinds of plants and herbs. Unfortunately, none of them were of any use to him.He arrived at the small river. The ear-piercing sounds of the trickling stream of water crashing against the rocks broke through the silence of the night.\u201cA.I Chip! Scan the surroundings!\u201d Leylin commanded. Even if the black robed Angelo hadn\u2019t warned him, he still had confidence in avoiding danger with the A.I Chip.[Beep! The surrounded area has been scanned! There are no dangers within a radius of 20 li!] The A.I Chip faithfully reported the message.\u201cWell, it\u2019s good that there is no danger. I don\u2019t want to run back to the camp midway through my washing. That will definitely make me the biggest laughing stock\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin muttered and he took off his outer robes and underwear, entering the river naked.The icy cold river engulfed his body, refreshing him.\u201cThis water is really cold, I am beginning to miss the water heater from my past life!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You are still not my match, give it up!\u201d George used both hands and grabbed the hilt, and laughingly said.\u201cWe aren\u2019t done yet!\u201d Leylin shouted, and his legs moved in a strange footwork, and once again initiated an attack.\u201cHah!\u201d George swung the long sword in his hands, which brought a sinister rustling of the wind.The cross blade in Leylin\u2019s hand swept, and blocked George\u2019s attack.\u201cGood! Your parry posture is not bad!\u201d George praised loudly. \u201cCareful! My next attack will be to your left leg!\u201d\u201cBring it on!\u201d Leylin made his preparations.\u201cWatch me!\u201d \u00a0George swung the two handed sword in his hands, and made a beautiful yet deadly arc towards him, sending it towards Leylin\u2019s right leg.Leylin retreated a step back, and blocked George\u2019s two handed sword in midair with his cross blade, \u201cYou definitely said the left leg, you didn\u2019t keep your word!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026..This is called tactics! It is to test your agility. My dad has always taught me, if one doesn\u2019t know how to scheme, then one day he will surely be played to death by others! I only want to scheme, not to be the target of schemes!\u201dGeorge laughed and said, and then pulled back his huge sword.\u201cNo more! No more! You are getting better each and every time! I wouldn\u2019t be able to beat you after a few more days!\u201dScratching his puzzled head: \u201dLeylin! My sword technique is passed down by a Grand Knight, I put in much effort, training with blood and sweat, so much so that my teacher said that my swordplay is better than the average Knight! Yet, you who can fight me to a standstill, how could you have been beaten by Ourin?\u201d\u201cThese sword techniques were taught to me by my father when I was younger, unfortunately I had forgotten it, and I\u2019m currently trying to practice more in order to recall it!\u201dLeylin clenched his fists, and his face turned red.\u201cOnce I have strength, I will definitely seek revenge viciously, and break Ourin\u2019s legs!\u201dHe looks like a hot blooded youngster who was filled with determination after a setback.\u201cMy dear Leylin, I believe in you. You will definitely fulfil your wish!\u201d George patted Leylin\u2019s shoulder.And with another look of pity:\u201d Currently, with your ability, it is already sufficient to seek your revenge!\u201dAfter sparring, George had a rough understanding of Leylin\u2019s strength.\u201cRight now I can deal with one or two of them, but Ourin has five members!\u201d Leylin was fretting over it.Actually, he was already confident in dealing with Ourin and his gang, but without an excuse, how could he fooled George into continuously practicing with him?\u201cOh right, you mentioned Grand Knights earlier, what are they?\u201d Leylin remembered George\u2019s complaint earlier, and casually asked.\u201cYou are talking about the Grand knights? They are one realm higher than knights. No matter where they go, they are considered a great existence! If one is lucky, a king might even be hospitable to them! And if one is willing to pledge loyalty, then they will definitely become a troop commander!\u201d\u201cTheir physical body has been pushed to the extremes, and rumours has it that apart from the long distance crossbow formation, even if a heavy cavalry troop were to charge at them, they won\u2019t be able to stop them from advancing!\u201d\u201cSo powerful!\u201d Leylin muttered.A commander of a troop has the same status of an Earl, and even Viscount John had to greet them if he saw one.A heavy cavalry troop, is the peak of a troop\u2019s strength in this era of medieval weapons. Once they charged, even a smaller city\u2019s walls might fall. For a Grand Knight to actually be able to use merely their physical body to fight with them, how strong would they have to be?Looking at Leylin who had a yearning expression on his face, George laughed out loud and consoled: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to envy them, a magus has an even more mysterious and stronger power compared to that of a knight. As long as you become a magus acolyte, your status is the comparable to that of a Grand Knight. And if you become an actual Magus, then congratulations, killing a Grand Knight is easier than stepping on an ant. The various kings from kingdoms will all want to strive to be first and fear to be last in stuffing their beautiful daughters on your bed\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cA magus is that powerful?\u201d Leylin was skeptical \u201c Then why are the black robes so cold to us, who have the possibility of turning into a Magus? They are naught but knights!\u201d\u201cHmm about this? I am not too sure, but a Magus\u2019s status is definitely very high. This was told to me by my father! I can swear it upon my Borunin Family\u2019s reputation.\u201dGeorge touched his nose, and replied rather awkwardly.\u201cAlright! Alright! It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t believe you!\u201d Leylin felt a little exasperated.Speaking within his heart \u201cA.I Chip! Scan the person in front of me!\u201d[Beep! Name: George Borunin Strength: 1.9, Agility: 1.8, Vitality: 1.9, Status: Healthy]George\u2019s stats could not have been achieved just by standard training. According to him, he had trained with the knights technique since he was young, and that was the reason he was able to achieve his current physique.Warriors who had started cultivating the knight breathing technique and thus improved their physique, but had not been able to ignite their internal life energy yet, were commonly known as Preparatory Knights!George\u2019s physique could be considered at the peak standard even amongst these Preparatory Knights!This was also linked to his nobility status and being able to use large amounts of expensive medicine to assist in improving his body\u2019s physique.\u201cAlright, we have sufficient rest now, let us head back! I do not want to return too late and find those black robes staring coldly at me!\u201dGeorge looked at his surroundings, and the bright moonlight coated the surrounding with a layer of silver colour light, the tranquility of the night was occasionally interrupted by insect cries.Leylin did not wish to attract attention during the day as they were travelling, so he sneaked out to practice with George at night.Naturally, this did not escape the black robes, but after a few encounters, Leylin found their attitude to be extremely cold. As long as one did not wander too far away from the camp and cause trouble, they would not care about them.\u201cJust once more round, we\u2019ll head back!\u201d Leylin said. \u201cAfter this round, I\u2019ll return this Cross Blade to you!\u201d\u201cEn\u2026\u2026Eh? George was a little absent minded, and then his eyes lit up. \u201c Are you finally done using it? Gus had been bothering me for it!\u201dIn order to train in sword techniques, the first requirement would be to have a Cross Blade!As nobility, there were many youngsters that wore warrior\u2019s robes, with a sword attached to their waist.However, the previous Leylin did not do so, the reason being that it was too heavy, and it restricted his movements!Because he found it troublesome, the previous Leylin had travelled without even a dagger on him. This had caused Leylin now to be in the awkward situation where he was totally weaponless, without even a Cross Blade to practice with.For the sake of practising, Leylin turned his attention to the first friend \u00a0he saw when he woke up \u2013 George.Using threats of exposing their friendship, he had made George lend him a weapon and train with him!Thinking back when George\u2019s eyes had turned white, and had an expression as though he has met with a bad friend, Leylin laughed uncontrollably.\u201cYour swordplay is improving at an extremely fast pace! But do you really not need the Cross Blade?\u201d George asked.\u201cI am rather familiar with Gus anyways so even if I were to lend it to you for a little while longer, it\u2019s not a big deal\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you for your kind intentions! But I really do not need it!\u201d Leylin smiled as he rejected his offer.After this period of sparring, he had already seen through the secret technique of the Farlier\u2019s House. Furthermore, due to the the A.I Chip, his swordplay would always remain at its peak state so his skills will not go rusty due to not practicing the Cross Blade for a long time.\u201cGood, then we will fight one more match with the same rules. I will only use the same amount of strength as you will!\u201dAs George said that, he picked up his big two handed sword and walked towards the centre of the patch of grass, his sword emitting a cold light as it reflected the moonlight.Leylin had also walked over, \u201cCome on! This time, I won\u2019t hold back!\u201dHe had thought of an experiment, and had sent out the invitation in order to carry it out.\u201cA.I Chip! Establish Task! Analyse the opponent\u2019s strength and the surroundings to come up with the best plan to defeat him!\u201d[Task Establishing. Beginning analysis.][Simulation results \u2013 Host is unwounded, target loses his ability to fight. Please confirm on whether to turn on the vision aid?]\u201cTurn it on! \u201c Upon Leylin\u2019s command, countless of blue lines appeared before his eyes that, as if turning the area into some sort of virtual world.[According to the target\u2019s reactions, there is a 99.98% probability that the \u00a0first attack will be the Host\u2019s right arm! Most Effective method of combating this: Sidestep, Jump Slash!]Following the voice of the A.I Chip, the blue rays of light in his retina had already formed an image of George, raising his sword and slashing towards Leylin\u2019s right arm.\u201cHeh! Watch the sword!\u201d George shouted, and as expected, he initiated the attack first, waving his two handed sword. He charged over, the motion almost mirroring the projected image.Leylin\u2019s lips curled, and dodged the attack, and he raised both his hands along with the Cross Blade. Leaping up high, he viciously swung it down.Jumping Slash!!\u201cDamn! How did this happen?\u201d George cried strangely, and ducked the Cross Blade with a roll on the floor.Leylin\u2019s Cross Blade struck onto the floor, which brought up some of the mud and small pieces of stones.George got up, a serious look on his face. He felt as if Leylin had predicted his attack, almost as if he had read his motions and knew them like the back of his palm.\u201cIf you are not attacking, then I am going to counterattack!\u201d Leylin said smilingly.\u201cBring it on!\u201d George stared nervously at Leylin.Leylin gripped his Cross Blade, took a step forward and pierced forward! Every action and movement had all been accurately performed as seen from a textbook.George made a blocking motion, but his body moved to the side instead, and as he dodged the pierce, he countered Leylin\u2019s attack with a slash of his own![The best way to react: Left turn 50 degrees, Horizontal Slash!]Following the A.I Chip instructions, Leylin dodged George\u2019s large sword, and sent a Horizontal Slash, almost slicing George as he slashed.The more they fought, the more perspiration formed on George\u2019s face.His every move and action had all been parried perfectly by Leylin, and his evading range had gradually decreased.\u201cI can\u2019t carry on like this any longer! I\u2019ll stake it all on this!\u201d George fiercely swung his large sword, and sent it clashing with Leylin\u2019s.Bang!!! A piece of silver light flew out and directly pierced into the grass. It was the large sword in George\u2019s hands! The blade had not stopped quivering as it let out a \u2018weng weng\u2019 sound.In the sparring area, Leylin\u2019s Cross Blade sword had touched horizontally at George\u2019s waist. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost!\u201d\u201cIndeed! I lost!\u201dGeorge muttered, and then immediately stared at Leylin :\u201dHow did you do that?\u201d\u201cIt is actually very simple, after training with you for a long time, I have already remembered the sequence of your movements!\u201d Leylin withdrew his sword and bowed smilingly.\u201cThe\u2026\u2026sequence of my movements?\u201d George repeated.\u201cYes, to put it in a simple way, everyone has a habit when they strike. As long as you can remember them, then it will be easy to arrange a trap according to the enemy\u2019s habits. I have used the same trick on you!\u201d\u201cPhew!!!\u201d George exhaled out a long breath, \u201cI understand now!\u201dAnd then looking at Leylin momentarily, as if he was looking at a monster:\u201d Your gift in sword technique is absolutely the best that I have ever seen!!! If you are not chosen to be a Magus Acolyte, I will definitely recommend you to go to a kingdom\u2019s capital\u2019s Imperial Knight Institute!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not only were they recruiting nobilities, the entry requirements were also extremely high. It was said that only geniuses would be accepted!\u201cSword techniques are only my hobby, but being a Magus is my lifelong dream!\u201dA Knight\u2019s strength may be great, but it was still comprehensible by Leylin\u2019s standards, not exceeding the boundaries. However, the Magi from rumors were able to manipulate the elements, including lightning and thunder. They also attained a great longevity!A Magus\u2019s greatness obviously exceeded the boundaries of a human, and Leylin could not even imagine it.Furthermore, every Magus is a scholar filled with knowledge. \u00a0Magi had strict attitudes towards experimenting about the natural world. They tried to study the laws of nature in order to achieve a massive amount of power to use for themselves! This lifestyle was more compatible with Leylin\u2019s previous life as a scientist.\u201cYes! Even if it is a Grand Knight, they can only be the servant of a Formal Magus. The strength a Magus holds is something that is impossible for us to imagine\u2026\u2026\u201dGeorge\u2019s face turned serious, and spoke the words in a sing-song tone.\u201cWhy is it that no matter what words you say, I get the feeling that they were spoken by a bard\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin rolled his eyes a little.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026 The reason I became like this is because my father sent me to court to undergo training for nobles!!\u201d George resumed his previous state.Suddenly blinking his eyes, he said mischievously: \u201cLeylin, you don\u2019t have a fiancee right? Why don\u2019t I introduce my sister Molly to you! She is a beauty that is known far and wide\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cScram!\u201dUnder the moonlight, the two youths left the grasslands as they fooled around.\u201cGoodnight! George!\u201d\u201cGoodnight! Leylin!\u201dAfter Leylin handed the Cross Blade to George and bid him farewell, he returned to the carriage.The dimly lit carriage had only him inside. The interior of the carriage let off a very faint odour. The stench was a mixture of rot and sweat. Because of this, many noble youths refused to stay in the carriage any longer than necessary. Once they got to pit stops, they would escape to the grass fields outside like little wild horses coming out to play.The concept of relationships in this world was very open minded, all the more so for nobility. With the strong perception ability of the A.I Chip, Leylin had discovered many affectionate couples around, which had led him to seek an even further location for him to train.Using his supervision eyesight to look at the wild battle scene, Leylin\u2019s heart burned in rage as this had made him recall the former memories of the spoilt brat.\u201cWho would have thought! After changing into a youngster\u2019s body, even my desires have increased\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin smiled bitterly.Calming his emotions, \u201cA.I Chip! Show me my body\u2019s statistics!\u201d[Leylin Farlier. Strength: 1.5, Agility: 1.6, Vitality: 1.4, Status: Healthy]It had been over a month since he first began practicing the Knight breathing technique. Right now, Leylin\u2019s body state had not only caught up to his peers of the same age, but had also surpassed some. Against George, he had concealed his true strength, which had caused George to gauge his strength wrongly.\u201cNot bad! I should proceed with today\u2019s cultivation!\u201dLeylin settled into a good posture, and entered the state of cultivation. This was his homework every day. According to the A.I Chip\u2019s instruction, after training at night, he should cultivate in the breathing technique again to have the best effects.After 20 odd minutes had passed, Leylin was completely drenched in his perspiration, but the amount of black impurities that had flowed out were clearly less than before.\u201cPhew!\u201d Leylin opened his eyes and looked at his body. He said in slight exasperation: \u201cThe breathing technique\u2019s effect is reducing, which is logical. According to the A.I Chip\u2019s estimation, Farlier House\u2019s breathing technique, even after optimising will completely lose effect by the times I\u2019ve enhanced my body\u2019s statistics to 2. This is the realm of Preparatory Knights. After this, I have I must use my own power, as well as the external stimulations from near death experiences, to attempt exciting the life energy. \u00a0Only then will I be able to improve again\u2026\u2026\u201dThinking up to here, Leylin took out a yellow coloured fruit out from his pocket. There were some black spots on its surface, making it look quite horrifying.Leylin directly placed it in his mouth, and then picked out a root of a herb, munching them together.[Beep! The Host\u2019s body is slowly recovering from fatigue. It is possible to carry on with another round of the Knight breathing technique!]The A.I Chip\u2019s voice rang.\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d These herbal concoctions had been created by Leylin over the past month from countless experiments using the A.I chip. It could reduce his fatigue, and increase the number of times he could cultivate in the breathing technique daily.With the addition of a few more body-strengthening medicine, the quality of Leylin\u2019s physical body had improved at an extremely fast pace.\u201cAgain!\u201d Leylin once again entered the state for the breathing technique.During the past month, the travelling party had already passed several small kingdoms. Eventually, they had completely entered the wilderness.There were very few people in the wilderness. It was only a desolate stretch of sand, with fresh markings from vicious beasts and horse mounted bandits.Ever since the travelling party had first entered the area, they had already encountered danger several times. Although nobody had died, Leylin\u2019s sense of crisis had slowly grown stronger. He could not wait to quench his thirst for power.When the rays of dawn shone brightly, the travelling party once again resumed its journey.Leylin sat alone in a corner with his arms crossed in front of his chest. The youths around him had all avoided him with disgust, allowing him to have quite a bit of space.\u201cI don\u2019t know what method Bessita used. The people in the carriage are still isolating me. If it were a regular youngster, this would\u2019ve most likely driven them crazy ages ago! It\u2019s just too bad that they met me instead!\u201dLeylin contentedly stretched his back. He had trained late into the night yesterday, which had made him extremely exhausted. This empty space was sufficient for him to rest for a while.\u201cHowever, this world sure is huge; the travelling party has been travelling for half a year, but they still have not reached their destination yet. We haven\u2019t seen the ocean yet either\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Leylin thought, he entered slumber with half closed eyes.Ding ling ling!!!At this time, the travelling party had already stopped. The black robed man shook the bell in his hands: \u201cLadies and gentlemen! It is time to get off the carriage to have lunch!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that time again?\u201d Leylin opened his eyes. \u201cThis kind of lifestyle is really boring!\u201dAfter alighting the carriage and receiving his own portion of food, Leylin chewed on a piece of white bread as he walked towards the grassy area beside the camp site.He had already used up the previously gathered substitute herbs, so he was preparing to restock.As he walked, he casually observed the surrounding plants. \u201cThis is a Jade Root Fruit, there are already files of it in the database. It is useless to me!\u201d\u201cMn! Samun Grass, this is a kind of plant that can only be found in the wilderness. It can be harvested!\u201d Leylin plucked a dirty, brown colored stalk of grass. There were extremely sharp thorns on the grass\u2019s sides. Leylin carefully broke the blade in half and used his fingers to dab at the jade coloured liquid that had been constantly flowing out from the grass. An expression of disappointment appeared on his face as he placed his fingers in his mouth.\u201cI found it, Flowerless Snake Fruit!\u201d Leylin threw the Samun Grass on the ground. As he casually walked over, he noticed, through the corner of his eye, the same yellow coloured fruit that he had eaten yesterday, growing on a shrubbery. His face expressed happiness.\u201cHehe! What\u2019s this I see? Leylin! Should I be saying \u2018as expected from a minor noble of the village\u2019? You\u2019re actually eating wild fruits on the roadside? You have really tarnished the reputation of the nobilities\u2026\u2026\u201dJust after Leylin had plucked the Flowerless Snake Fruit and placed it into his pocket, an annoying voice was heard.\u201cIs that Ourin?\u201d Leylin raised his head, and saw the murderer who had killed the previous host of this body.Ourin had fiery red coloured hair, and there were ripped muscles all over his body. His arms were as thick as Leylin\u2019s thighs. He currently had his arms crossed in front of his chest as he smiled mockingly at Leylin.There were a few nobility youths at his side, which had all coordinated to jest at him.\u201cA.I Chip! Scan their statistics!\u201d[Scan Complete! Ouri., Strength: 1.7, Agility: 1.2, Vitality: 1.5, Status: Healthy]The A.I Chip feedbacked.Looking at the data in front of his eyes, Ourin\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t bad. His strength was almost as strong as two adult men. It was no wonder that he had been able to fatally injure the previous Leylin.As a child of nobility, as long as they are able to endure sufferings and persevere in their training daily, coupled with the breathing technique, it is not strange to achieve such results.The nobles beside Ourin were not that strong; most of them were below 1. Leylin had even seen a pale faced youth whose stats ranged about 0.5, giving a run for money for the previous Leylin.Mentally calculating the stats, Ourin\u2019s strength did not differ much from his. But his sword technique and moves definitely couldn\u2019t rival Leylin\u2019s, as he had the help of the A.I Chip.As for the rest of the youths, they were only there to increase their numbers. The disparity between his stats and theirs was too huge. It would be extremely easy to deal with them, like an adult bullying a child.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Leylin asked, his voice calm.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin\u2019s reaction had obviously exceeded Ourin\u2019s expectations. He actually had no fury or fear, and that made him speechless.\u201cIf it was the previous matter regarding Bessita, haven\u2019t I already apologised before? Bessita has also forgiven me\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin added.At the same time, his heart began to race; this could be a probe sent out by Bessita. After enduring for a whole month, had she finally been unable to endure any longer?\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s because of Bessita! She has forgiven you, but I haven\u2019t!\u201d Ourin spoke loudly, his hands tightly clenched into fists.\u201cAlright! Then what do you want?\u201d Leylin spread out his hands, as if helpless. However, there was a glint of mockery deep in his eyes.Ourin hadn\u2019t imagined that Leylin would be so submissive, and struggled for a long time before spluttering: \u201cYou have to make an oath to never bother Bessita again in the future!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Leylin agreed immediately, and even placed his right hand on the crest pinned to his chest. The crest had a Cross Blade and a picture of a skylark on it, which was the emblem of the Farlier House!\u201cWith my honour as a member of the Farlier House, I swear that I will never bother Bessita ever again on my own accord!\u201dUsing a family\u2019s reputation to make a vow was the most serious oath a noble could take. Those who had gone back on their words would meet with the disdain of all nobles.\u201cSo! Mister Ourin! Can I leave now?\u201dLeylin bowed slightly, with perfect noble\u2019s etiquette.\u201cHold on!\u201d It had not occurred to Ourin that Leylin would show no resistance, and at this point, his eyes contained an avaricious glint: \u201dAccording to the noble\u2019s conduct, you still have to compensate. Hand over all the Magic Crystals that you have!\u201d\u201cMagic Crystals!\u201d The surrounding onlookers gasped in surprise.\u201cMagic Crystals?\u201d Leylin repeated. According to his memory, the Magic Crystals were a kind of currency between Magi. They were items of necessity for Magi Acolytes with no credentials to enter the academy.Leylin did not know the exact amount required to enter an academy, because he did not have even a single Magic Crystal on him. Viscount John had tried several methods to obtain Magic Crystals. However, he was unable to get even one. From this, one could see just how precious Magic Crystals were!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He probably even needed to thank him for heavily injuring the original Leylin, which had given him a chance for rebirth.Leylin was a practical person. To him, face was never more important than reasoning.Even using the honor of his family to swear wasn\u2019t the slightest loss for him. However, Ourin\u2019s request after that had touched the bottom line.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026you can\u2019t do that! Those black robed lords won\u2019t let you off!\u201dLeylin tightly grabbed onto the sack on his hands with a frantic expression.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026why would those black robes barge into our matters? Don\u2019t forget, you were beaten half dead by me previously, and no one had paid it any mind.\u201dOurin clenched his fist, and clear cracking sounds could be heard from his bones, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to break your bones one by one, obediently hand the Magic Crystals over!\u201dAs Ouring drew closer, his large frame engulfed Leylin within his shadow.Leylin observed his surroundings; this location was already quite far from the camp. Around him were only some lackeys that had been brought by Ourin. They were all looking at them as if they were viewing a show.\u201cDon\u2019t bother looking, no one will come to save you\u2026\u2026\u201dOurin grinned.\u201cReally? That\u2019s best then!\u201d Leylin suddenly laughed.His silhouette flashed. When Leylin reappeared, he was already behind Ourin, \u201cPerfect, I can take revenge for that day\u2019s incident!\u201dA fierce kick was thrown out! Carrying intense wind, it kicked into Ourin\u2019s waist area.Ourin felt an intense force coming from Leylin\u2019s leg, sending his body into the air!Bang! Ourin fell to the ground, severe pain coming from his waist which made his eyes turn slightly red, \u201cYou dared! You dared! You actually dared to hurt me!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re dead! I will hang you!\u201dOurin ferociously stood up, rays of blood-thirsty and savage light shooting out of his eyes.\u201cThis is the advantage of having a good constitution?\u201d Seeing that the kick that he used fifty percent of his strength for did nothing much to Ourin, Leylin\u2019s pupils shrank.\u201cHa!\u201d Ourin waved his fist around like a violent black bear.Leylin flashed sideways, dodging Ourin\u2019s fist. When Ourin\u2019s fist landed on the small tree behind, it actually left a deep dent. A strength of 1.7 is indeed not a trivial matter.\u201cSuch a heavy punch. Even with my constitution, I can\u2019t withstand more than a few punches\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin swiftly thought.\u201cA.I Chip! Simulate the best method to defeat him!\u201d[Beep! Task established! Starting Assist Mode!] A voice came from the A.I Chip. Its powerful calculation ability instantly came up with the best solution.[Duck! Task Established! Initiating Assist Mode.] The A.I Chip prompted. Leylin immediately crouched down, dodging the roaring Ourin\u2019s tackle.[A flaw appeared in enemy\u2019s defense! Most effective attacking location: Armpit!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.Leylin\u2019s figure continuously flashed, dodging Ourin\u2019s attacks while also getting closer. \u201cDo you know? Although your strength is powerful, you\u2019re not agile enough. This is the disadvantage of your body shape\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Leylin could still speak when he\u2019s attacking, it showed that he was still holding back.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026is this still the Leylin from before? He\u2026\u2026why has he become so much more powerful?\u201d The surrounding youths all opened their mouths in shock.Under the everyone\u2019s expressions of disbelief, Leylin threw out a punch! It hit Ourin\u2019s armpit with his entire strength. Ourin, who had suffered the attack, fell onto the ground with a pained expression, and couldn\u2019t get up for a long time.Leylin\u2019s full strength was at least 1.5, and wasn\u2019t very different from Ourin\u2019s. Furthermore, the place that he had hit was also the weak spot. Ourin fell onto the ground, his eyes bloodshot as he growled, \u201cYou\u2019re dead for sure! My family will not let you off!\u201d\u201cOh! Really?\u201d Leylin remained indifferent towards Ourin\u2019s threat, and even gave Ourin a kick in his lower abdomen. Ourin curled himself up, like a cooked prawn.Leylin squatted down, looked at Ourin with a face full of smiles, \u201cSince you won\u2019t let me off anyways, do you think that it would be better if I just made the first move and killed you?\u201dAt that moment, Leylin\u2019s smile at Ourin looked like the devil\u2019s.\u201cHe\u2019s not joking, he really dares to take action!\u201d Ourin saw the killing intent in Leylin\u2019s eyes. Suddenly, he felt as though he was being stared at by a tiger. The anger within his head completely vanished, and was replaced with fear.\u201cMister Leylin! Lord Leylin! You can\u2019t do that! I\u2026\u2026I have the Dorlan family behind me. If you kill me, you\u2019ll get yourself in trouble!\u201d\u201cThen do you admit your wrongs!\u201d Leylin issued a ridiculing question.\u201cI admit my wrongs! I apologize\u2026\u2026 sorry!\u201d Under the threat of death, Ourin succumbed quickly.\u201cVery good, I accept your apology. In addition, according to the law of nobility, I have the rights to request for compensation!\u201dLeylin said smilingly which gave Ourin a bad feeling.\u201cAs compensation, hand all the Magic Crystals you have with you!\u201d Leylin smilingly said those words of extortion.\u201cOh! No! You can\u2019t do this! Do you know how many people have been sacrificed for my family to obtain these Magic Crystals?\u201dOurin struggled to protest.\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s just a simple multiple choice question in the world. Now, it\u2019s your turn. My dear Ourin, life or Magic Crystals, choose one!\u201dLeylin didn\u2019t seem to have any reaction to Ourin\u2019s begging. Instead, he stepped on Ourin\u2019s face, gradually increasing the amount of force he exerted.The boots stepping on Ourin\u2019s face sent his head further and further into the ground, giving a suffocating feeling.After a few minutes, Leylin released some of the pressure, \u201cSo? Have you thought through it properly?\u201d\u201cPuah!\u201d Ourin inhaled the fresh air in big mouthfuls. His face was now covered with mud and footprints, making him look hilarious.However, none of the surrounding youths dared to smile.One of the youths slowly began to retreat, wanting to leave this place.Leylin picked up a pebble, [Wind estimation completed! Shooting orbit adjusted!]Whoosh! The pebble hit the escaping youth\u2019s leg, sending him sprawling on the ground.\u201cOurin, see that? Don\u2019t bother waiting for reinforcements\u2026\u2026Furthermore, don\u2019t try to challenge my patience!\u201dLeylin looked at the surrounding youths. Those who had Leylin\u2019s gaze sweep past them all lowered their heads, their bodies trembling.\u201cOkay! I can give you the Magic Crystals! But I left them in the carriage! Follow me back to get them!\u201d Ourin said in surrender.\u201cMagic Crystals are so important. You don\u2019t bring them with you, but leave them at the carriage,? Are you treating me like a fool?\u201dSuch childish lies naturally couldn\u2019t get pass Leylin.\u201cIt seems like you haven\u2019t had enough!\u201d A ray of fierceness flashed across Leylin\u2019s eyes. He grabbed onto Ourin\u2019s arm and suddenly gave it a snap!Crack!!! Ear piercing sounds of fracture could be heard, followed by Ourin\u2019s miserable scream.\u201cIf you still refuse to speak the truth, I\u2019ll break your other arm!\u201d\u201cNo! No! No! You can\u2019t do this, the black robed lord won\u2019t let you off!\u201d Ourin clutched onto his arm, rolling on the ground.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026why would those black robes barge into our matters? Did you forget that I was beaten half dead by you previously, and no one paid any mind to it?\u201dLeylin coldly smiled, sending Ourin\u2019s words back to him.\u201cSeems like you\u2019re really yearning for death!\u201d Leylin was just about to go up and take action.\u201cWait! Wait! Fine! I\u2019ll give you the Magic Crystals, but you have to swear that you will not take revenge on me anymore!\u201d Ourin shouted with a pale face as he saw Leylin approaching him.\u201cOkay! I swear with the honor of my Farliar family!\u201d Leylin answered.Ourin\u2019s face turned green. Struggling to a half seated position on the ground, he took out a golden coloured pouch from his bosom and tossed it at Leylin, \u201cAll my Magic Crystals are here!\u201dLeylin took it and gave it a look. This was a palm sized pouch made ofwith gold and silver threads. In the center of it was a picture of an eagle and a shield, surrounded by many plants. It appeared to be a family symbol.Leylin opened the pouch and saw over dozens of black coloured crystals quietly lying there.[Beep! Discovered an unknown energy source!] The A.I Chip alerted.\u201cSo? Can it be used?\u201d Leylin had an excited expression on his face.[Searching the database\u2026\u2026information insufficient! Method of usage not found!\u201d[Alert! Energy source with unknown radiation. Recommendation: The Host\u2019s body to strengthen defense!]\u201cSo it\u2019s like this?\u201d Leylin inwardly thought, then turned to Ourin and asked, \u201cWhich academy are you going to?\u201d\u201cWet\u2026\u2026Wetland Gardens!\u201d Ourin had an ugly expression on his face.\u201cWetland Gardens! I\u2019ve heard before that the entry fee is ten Demon Crystals, right?\u201d\u201cCorrect! Where did you hear it from?\u201d Ourin was a little surprised.Leylin faintly smiled, looking a little mysterious. He have never heard of any Wetland Gardens before, and was only bluffing Ourin, since most of the school fees were basically all in rounded figures. It wasn\u2019t a big deal if he guessed wrongly anyways.\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll return it to you!\u201d Leylin took out three Magic Crystals from the pouch and tossed the pouch with the Magic Crystals back at Ourin.\u201cThese three Magic Crystals will be my compensation!\u201d Although he could take all the Magic Crystal now, Leylin is still unsure of the attitudes of the black and white robes on this matter. He also doesn\u2019t want to use himself to test out their bottom lines. Thus, he left Ourin the sufficient amount of Magic Crystals for the entry fee. That way, even if they quibbled about it, Leylin had an excuse.\u201cTha\u2026\u2026thank you!\u201d Ourin\u2019s facial expression turned a lot better. If he were to lose all of these Magic Crystals and wasn\u2019t unable to enter the academy, he really didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d face his family.\u201cRest assured! I won\u2019t take your Magic Crystals!\u201d Leylin raised his head and looked at the surrounding nobles, who all had their hands tightly clenched into fists. Seeing this, Leylin couldn\u2019t help shaking his head.\u201cThank you Lord Leylin!\u201d Hearing Leylin\u2019s assurance, the other youths all felt relieved and immediately bowed.\u201cBut! I want to request other compensation!\u201d Leylin looked at a youth, the one that tried to escape but had been knocked down.\u201cThe Cross Blade at your waist looks pretty nice!\u201d Leylin looked at the youth, who looked a little frightened. Leylin then pointed to the Cross Blade at the youth\u2019s waist.Having heard the hint, the youth hastily replied, \u201cLord, you can have it!\u201d\u201cHaha! I won\u2019t hold back then!\u201d Leylin took the Cross Blade from the youth. After gauging its weight, he nodded his head in satisfaction.As a noble\u2019s sword, the quality of this crossed sword was excellent.The hilt of the sword was decorated with beautiful flower patterns to prevent it from slipping from the hand. The scabbard was made from the skin of sharks, giving it a luxurious feeling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlliance\u201cSo the method of distinguishing time is very similar to the past!Leylin thought inwardly to himself as he messed around with the crystal pocket watch in his hand.The surface of the crystal pocket watch had fine workmanship, with twenty four small frames inside. Each frame represented an hour.Not only did he extort a weapon from Ourin\u2019s lackeys, but also spoils of war worth thousands of gold coin. This pocket watch was contributed by a small fatty.As for the revenge from their family, the Dorlan family that Ourin belonged to was from the Bourbon Kingdom, which was a few kingdoms away from Count John\u2019s territory. Furthermore, the relationships between the two kingdoms were already in a state of hostility.Not to mention that time it took to become a Magus was at least a few years, and even sending letters back and forth would also take at least a few years.Leylin only gave it a little thought before throwing the matters between him and Ourin\u2019s family to the back of his head.\u201cThis time I\u2019ve really made a profit! Furthermore, the Magic Crystals are the currency among Magi, so they are very useful for acolytes!\u201dLeylin took out a Magic Crystal and flipped it around in his palm. It emitted a steady, cold feeling.According to the calculation of the A.I Chip, although this Magic Crystal had some slight radiation, \u00a0the effect it had towards the body seemed to be positive. It could enhance the body\u2019s vitality.\u201cBut! Ever since the news about me defeating Ourin spread, everyone\u2019s attitude towards me has changed. Should I say that this is a world that respects the strong?\u201dIt had already been two days since the previous incident, and the battle results with Ourin had spread among the nobility teenagers.Especially the scene of him breaking Ourin\u2019s arm while smiling, it had become the nightmare of those teenagers present. When Ourin returned, he immediately hid in his carriage and tended to his injuries. As for those nobility teenagers, they trembled the moment they saw Leylin and quickly ran away.\u201cHi! Leylin, do you want to play together?A nobility girl from the same carriage came over and asked. She wore nobility attire, wearing something similar to stockings in Leylin\u2019s previous life on her long legs, giving off an alluring charm.The custom of this world was to respect the strong. Now, Leylin felt that the atmosphere in the carriage was much better, and the others didn\u2019t try to go against him either.Moreover, several other nobility girls also extended invitations to him.This girl was in the same carriage with him, her name is Lilith.\u201cThanks! But, I have friends coming!\u201d Leylin said apologetically.\u201cOoh! I must have been interrupting! I\u2019ll invite you later on, Jasmine and a few others are also interested in you!\u201dThe long-legged girl tenderly smiled, raised her skirt, and made a noble\u2019s greeting, extending a tempting invitation.\u201cGirls nowadays are really maturing early!\u201dLeylin bitterly smiled in his heart.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026what did I just see? How many times has our young Casanova Leylin been invited by girls?\u201d An exaggerated voice came.\u201cHow can I be compared to you? \u2018Satin Gold Mane Lion\u2019, your great name has spread among the female circles in the entire carriage!\u201d Leylin rolled his eyes.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to avoid me so as to not be isolated by everyone, are you no longer afraid of that?\u201d Leylin look at the approaching George.\u201cYou\u2019re the hot topic in the camp now! Many girls have interest towards you. That Lilith earlier wasn\u2019t bad either. I can guarantee you that if you just put your heart into it, you\u2019ll be able to take her down in three days!\u201dGeorge laughed, \u201cFurthermore, I have to congratulate you on your successful revenge!\u201d With a wave of his hand, a glass bottle drew an arc in the air and was caught by Leylin.Opening the oaken stopper, a fruity aroma mixed with a tinge of alcohol drifted out, causing Leylin to subconsciously take a deep breath.\u201cApple wine! I haven\u2019t drank much of this in these few months!\u201d\u201cCorrect! Furthermore, it\u2019s a speciality from our federation. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to have kept it hidden till now!\u201d George opened the wine bottle in his hand.\u201cTo our Leylin! Cheers!!\u201d\u201cCheers!!!\u201d Leylin smiled. Wine bottles knocked onto each other and emitted a clear sound.\u201cAlso, thank you!\u201d Leylin said sincerely.George had the strength of a Preparatory Knight, and with his leadership status amongst this bunch of nobility youths, if he had taken any slight action earlier on, he could have easily settled Ourin.However, he cared about Leylin\u2019s emotions, and only helped Leylin increase his strength secretly. Besides that, he had hidden their relationship so that Ourin would provoke Leylin without any second thoughts. Finally, he helped Leylin complete his revenge.This protected his pride as a noble very well.From this, Leylin could see his meticulousness and his ability to take care of others\u2019 feelings.\u201cThis is no longer about winning the hearts of people, but about using sincerity to move them. I should say that it\u2019s really worthy of Satin Gold Mane Lion\u2019s Family, leader of the Furze Alliance!\u201d Leylin thought inwardly.\u201cNo need for thanks! We\u2019re all members of the Furze Alliance, how could I have turned a blind eye at you being bullied by those northerners!!!\u201d George laughed, downing all of his apple wine in one gulp.\u201cPity! Now that we\u2019re deeper and deeper into the wilderness, we haven\u2019t been passing by any large cities for a long time now. Even supplies are hard to find!\u201dGeorge seemed to have recalled the taste of the apple wine and had some regret.\u201cRight! We\u2019re going to organize a barbeque banquet; it\u2019ll be for our Furze Alliance. Do you want to join?\u201dGeorge extended an invitation.\u201cOf course! It\u2019d be my pleasure!\u201d Leylin smiled and responded. With his identity as a noble from the Furze Alliance, he could only join this circle.At times when one\u2019s strength was still weak, joining circles was also a method to protect one\u2019s safety.It was deep in the night. The sky was filled with shining stars, pulling a silver veil over the ground.Inside the camp, groups of young men and girls all sat together, circling the campfire as they laughed and messed around. It was very lively.After a few months of living together, they had gotten closer to one another.\u201cCome, Leylin, I\u2019ll introduce the both of you to each other. This is Yarfuan, Count Normier\u2019s descendent!\u201d\u201cNice to meet you! I\u2019ve heard lots about you trashing Ourin!\u201d Yarfuan stretched his hand out as he smiled.\u201cNice to meet you!\u201d A genuine smile was drawn on Leylin\u2019s face as he shakes Yarfuan\u2019s hand.\u201cThese are the sisters, Gwen and Gwylith, they are your admirers!\u201d George led Leylin in a circle around the campfire, introducing him.\u201cNice to meet you! Mister Leylin!\u201d The sisters looked exactly the same. They each had a pair of glittering aquamarine eyes, identical voices, and some red blush on their faces.\u201cNice to meet you, beautiful ladies! It\u2019s an honor to meet you!!!\u201d Leylin placed his hand on his chest and did a noble\u2019s greeting.Seeing the two girls blushing as they ran, George looked like he was about to faint.\u201cBrat! You\u2019re blessed! The two of them seem to be interested in you! They are twins! Twins!\u201d George\u2019s hands were dancing around as he said this, with some heartache.\u201cOkay! I believe that in a time when supplies are starting to decline, you should have another purpose to organizing this banquet, and not just simply to search for lovers!\u201dLeylin said.As for his personal needs, he was still able to restrain them. Although he didn\u2019t mind letting them out, that also depended on the location.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re able to see this point!\u201d George said. The smiling expression on his face disappeared and was replaced with a leader\u2019s presence.He strode to the center of the area and banged the silver spoon in his hand.\u201cLadies and gentlemen! Sorry to bother you for awhile, but please shift your gazes over here!\u201dGeorge\u2019s prestige was still rather high among this group of people. The surrounding crowd all stopped what they were doing and shifted their gazes to the center.\u201cFirstly! I would like to welcome a new comrade joining us! He\u2019s Leylin!!!\u201d George announced in a loud voice, and clapped.\u201cPa Pa Pa!!!\u201d An intense, wave-like clapping sound could be heard from the surroundings.Leylin got up and made a greeting towards the surroundings.\u201cOkay!\u201d George waved his hand, stopping the clappings and continued, \u201cI set up this small alliance to guarantee that every single Acolyte from our Furze Alliance would safely reach the academy and become a well-respected Lord Magus. And now, fellow comrades, trouble has arisen and it is time for us to work together!\u201dGeorge\u2019s expression turned a little solemn, and even his tone was grave. Being infected by him, the surrounding atmosphere also became a little quiet. Only George\u2019s voice still echoed in the air.\u201cWe are nearly out of the wilderness and are about to enter the Great Plains of Death. This is the last stage of our journey, and also the most dangerous part!!!\u201d\u201cGreat Plains of Death?\u201d Leylin was surprised, and immediately searched through his original memories.According to the memories in the A.I Chip, the current continent that Leylin was in was very vast, filled with many kingdoms and without a united name.Originally, the Furze Alliance that Leylin joined belonged to the southeast corner of the continent. They seemed to be one of the first batches of students. The travelling party had headed North, passing through many dukedoms and kingdoms, and now already reached the north side of the continent.After passing through the wilderness, there was a long patch of narrow plains. Opposite the plains was rumored to be an ocean.And this piece of plains was filled with all sorts of dangers, and had always been a restricted zone for humans! Rumor was that the plains were filled with all sorts of beasts; even the most ferocious bandits didn\u2019t dare to enter the plains. Every part of the plains was filled with corpses of mercenaries, adventurers and travelers!!Right now, the Magus Acolyte-filled travelling party was about to pass through this Great Plains of Death, to the coastline.\u201cWith the protection of the black robed and white robed Lords, we\u2019ll definitely be able to pass through it!\u201d A fat boy said as the crowd went into an uproar.\u201cCorrect! With the protection of the Lord Magi and Knights, our possibility of passing through here is rather high! But when those Lords are unable to manage, we will encounter death. It could be me, it could be you, do you want to experience such an outcome?\u201dGeorge asked.\u201cDefinitely not!!!\u201d The fat boy shouted as his face turned red and sat back down.\u201cCorrect! Our motive is to reach the Magus Academy opposite the ocean, and to become well respected Magi. But the cruel screening will begin now. According to the information that my father obtained, there will be large amounts of death in the Great Plains of Death in every single Magus travelling party!\u201dGeorge went on, revealing a small part of cruelty.\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026What should be done?\u201d Lots of young men and women went into panic, and they looked at George with ashen faces, hoping that he would have a plan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEntering the Plains\u201cOf course, the reason we formed this alliance was for that purpose!\u201dGeorge stated loudly.\u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed this with the other traveling parties. We will swap positions with them, so that our Furze Alliance can occupy a few carriages that are close to each other! We\u2019ve also gotten the permission from the black robes!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, us noble males will take turns being guards to protect the carriages! Of course, this is with the caveat that we are merely assisting the black robe Knights. As for the beautiful ladies, the logistics and cleaning duties will be up to you!\u201d\u201cAs for the weapons, you guys also do not have to worry. We\u2019ve already made our preparations and even got hold of a crossbow!\u201dGeorge called out his plans.The youths of the alliance all began to talking amongst themselves, and after some discussion, most were in favour of this plan.\u201cOkay, we agree!\u201dAs for the position of the captain of the guards, it was inevitable that George would take that position. Striking while the iron was hot, George began to hand out some missions.The feast continued afterwards, but it was clear to see that most of the enthusiasm in the crowd had long since been lost.\u201cOriginally I had planned on giving you a Cross Blade, but it seems there is no longer any need now!\u201dGeorge held up his cup as he walked towards Leylin, pointing at the sword hilt fastened at his waist.\u201cIs it true that every single time a Magus troop enters the Great Plains, there are many deaths?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cOf course, the best case scenario is that only one or two will die, but there have been times where at least ten have perished!\u201d George shrugged his shoulders. \u201cOtherwise why else would I spend so much money and energy in order to establish an alliance that would be dissolved when we reach the coastline?\u201d\u201cWherever you plant a seed, there will be some form of profit to be had!\u201d Leylin laughed.No matter what, as long as everyone grouped together, then their odds of survival would increase. And any of the surviving acolytes would definitely hold some goodwill towards George and his family. As long as one of these acolytes were to become a Magus, then the returns would be great.But even if there were no survivors, it wasn\u2019t a big loss to him either way right?\u201cAside from your swordsmanship, your intelligence has really impressed me!\u201d George\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cThe things I did were all things that my father told me to.\u201d\u201cWell then, are you willing to help me?\u201d George extended his hand.\u201cAs you wish!\u201d Leylin laughed, linking his hand to George\u2019s.\u2026\u2026Leylin\u2019s reply to George\u2019s request wasn\u2019t an impulsive one. In fact, he had made this decision after careful deliberation.With regards to the hidden dangers in the plains, he wasn\u2019t very knowledgable about it. So joining hands by cooperating would be a decent proposal.HuuuuuThe cold wind descended upon the group and hit them in the face like knife blades. With each breath drawn, Leylin could smell the fragrant smell of grass.\u201cIt\u2019s already been 15 days since we\u2019ve entered the Great Plains of Death!\u201dLooking back at the carriages, Leylin could see some traces of damage on it, causing him to feel quite gloomy.The marks on the carriages were three different lines linked into one as if it was created by a single claw.\u201cThe Great Plains of Death have dangers that even normal humans, or even Preparatory Knights would have trouble with!\u201dAfter entering the plains, although the black and white robed lords had increased the number of patrols, and for the acolytes to band together, there had still been some casualties.The marks on the carriages had been caused by a pack of Plain Direwolves. The very moment they had arrived, the carriages had suffered a siege.Although there hadn\u2019t been any deaths, the pack of Plain Direwolves had nearly pushed over the carriages and damaged it, giving Leylin a deep impression of them.From that moment onwards, the students didn\u2019t dare to camp outside and all tried to sleep in the carriages! But even with that, there had still been some casualties.Leylin\u2019s face grew dark.Although the black robed Knights were guarding them, some of the youngsters still needed to go out to take care of their bodily needs. Alas, within the danger filled Great Plains of Death, that meant danger.One youth had been bitten by a poisonous insect the very moment he stepped off the carriage and died.\u201cAccording to the calculations of the A.I Chip, the poison of the insect would corrode the brain within 13 seconds. There was not enough time for medical help, and even the few white robed Magus could only watch the youngster die\u2026\u201dAfter that incident, the students would get off the carriage only when absolutely necessary. However, due to the small size of the carriage and the sheer number of people squeezed inside, the smell within was certainly unpleasant.For the price of helping the black robed knights drive a carriage, Leylin was given the chance t get some fresh air.Although being on the outside of the carriage seemed to be more dangerous, with the black robed Knight right next to him, it was actually much safer.As for the carriage driving skill? Leylin only had to listen to the black robed Knight for a short amount of time while the A.I chip recorded everything.\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark! Everyone gather within the carriages to rest!\u201dA voice called out from the front, causing every single carriage to stop.Not only was traveling at night dangerous, but it meant the horses did not have time to rest, which could lead to their deaths, and cause even more troubles.\u201cYour carriage driving skills are quite good!\u201d The black robed Knight looked at Leylin and spoke softly.\u201cThank you for your praise!\u201d Leylin nodded.Returning to the inside of the carriage, a fierce smell hit his nose the moment he opened the door. Leylin\u2019s eyebrows creased together, but seeing the stupefied looks on the students faces, he could only sigh to himself secretly.Ever since the first casualty, none of the youths had a happy look, instead, there was a mournful atmosphere. This was another reason why Leylin did not like staying inside the carriage at all.\u201cLeylin, you\u2019re back!\u201d A small freckled youngster forced out a smile as he greeted him.\u201cYeah!\u201d Leylin sat down and looked around before taking a piece of flatbread to gnaw on.The dry piece of flatbread was chewed up inside his mouth, feeling as if he was chewing on sand. Despite its taste, Leylin managed to swallow the bread with great difficulty, but in doing so, he felt a sudden pain within his throat, prompting him to hurriedly take out his canteen and chug down a large amount of water. After he finally finished the entire piece of bread, he heaved a sigh of relief.After entering the Great Plains of Death, supplies were hard to come by. Even though the students had some gold coins, there were no merchants around. So in this situation, the gold coins were not much better than mere stones.\u201cLey\u2026.Leylin, what\u2019s the situation like? Just how many more days until we\u2019re out of this damned plains?\u201dAfter Leylin had finished eating, the freckled youth asked him a question.His words were clearly what everyone wanted to know the answer, and drew everyone\u2019s attention as they turned to look towards Leylin.\u201cWhile driving the carriage, I talked with the black robed Knight. We\u2019ve already traveled half the distance, so if everything goes well from here, we\u2019ll reach the coastlines in another half a month.\u201d\u201cEh! Good god, there\u2019s still half a month more?! What terrible days these are, I can\u2019t even stand another single day in this place!\u201dThe freckled youth began to pull at his hair as he complained.\u201cHey, cheer up, Kassa. As long as you can take these 15 days, then you\u2019ll reach the coastlines. Delicious fruits, fluffy bread, not to mention a comfortable bed and a warm bathroom, all of it is waiting for you!\u201dEven as a youngster tried to cheer Kassa up, the words seemed to be trying to cheer himself up even more than Kassa.Dong! Dong!A rhythmic pattern could be heard as the doors to the carriage opened, revealing George. In his armor and carrying his long sword, George looked like a handsome Knight. \u201cHey, gentleman! Ladies! Break time is here! If you need to loosen up a bit, just come outside. If you don\u2019t, then please stay inside, after all, the outside is quite dangerous\u2026.The carriage grew restless before a few red faced girls looked at each other in the eye and walked out of the carriage.Leylin shrugged his shoulders before grabbing his Cross Blade, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAs a member of the guards, he needed to protect these ladies. Even though all he could do was to maintain his vigilance and call out for the black robed Knight to come help them if any trouble arose.\u201cI\u2026I won\u2019t go down this time!\u201d Kassa spoke out from the side as he shivered.\u201cFine then!\u201d Leylin gestured to the rest to follow him out the carriage.Landing softly on the grass, Leylin couldn\u2019t help but to stretch comfortably outside. A beautiful scenery stretched far beyond what his eye could see. If it weren\u2019t for the amount of danger in here, Leylin would have loved this sight.\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d George spoke out as he watched the setting sun.\u201cHow beautiful indeed, but also dangerous!\u201d Leylin muttered.\u201cThere\u2019s danger everywhere my friend! Sickness, famine, war, the world is filled with dangers like these. To us, this area is a threat to our lives, but to the white robed Magus, this is nothing more than like the garden back home!\u201d George clenched at his sword.\u201cAre you trying to say that as long as you have strength, then you can obtain both freedom and safety?\u201d\u201cExactly! Take a look at Kassa, he has already lost his courage. On this road to power, he is lacking the spirit to face danger. Even if he were to safely arrive at the Magus Academy, it is unlikely that he can become a Magus. After all, studying magic is a treacherous path that is a hundred times more difficult than this plain!\u201dGeorge threw a rock far into the plains, \u201cIt\u2019s time to protect our beautiful treasures now!\u201dSeeing George walk away, Leylin had a smile on his face, \u201cCourage? But for those chasing the truth, prudence is also a necessity!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip! Initialize scanning!\u201d Leylin thought.Following the order, a three dimensional scenery began to visualize within Leylin\u2019s head, showing off the vicinity of the nearby area.Within the light blue geographical image, a cluster of white stars. These stars symbolized the students; not a single one of them seemed to be hurt.As for the black robed Knight, he was a flashing red light. After the A.I Chip\u2019s analysis, it had recognized him as an existence that could threaten his host.The final few carriages had the white robed Magus within. Leylin didn\u2019t dare to try to use his A.I Chip to scan it in case its energy was detected and cause troubles for him.Not too long after, every single nearby source of danger appeared within Leylin\u2019s mind.\u201cEven if it\u2019s a poisonous insect, they won\u2019t be able to escape the A.I Chip\u2019s scan! As of right now, this area is safe!\u201dThis was a guarantee that Leylin could make.Although he was a member of the guard, he would never do anything to put himself in harm\u2019s way.With the A.I Chip, he had firm grasp of everything happening in a 20 li radius, and this would be the biggest guarantee to their safety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve used up all the Flowerless Snake Fruits again, and I can take this chance to gather some more. But I\u2019m not sure if the plains even has this type of plant\u2026\u201dLeylin thought to himself as he gradually walked further from the party.\u201cA.I. Chip! Check my body\u2019s stats!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier. Strength: 1.6, Agility: 1.7, Vitality: 1.5, Status: Healthy.]A.I. Chip transmitted back the information.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much improvement, only around 0.1!\u201d Leylin furrowed his brows, \u201cEver since everyone started resting in the carriage, I can no longer find a suitable place to cultivate the breathing techniques. Furthermore, the effects of the medicines are decreasing. According to the calculations, the optimized Cross Blade breathing technique should allow me to increase my basic physical stats to 1.9 before hitting the limit. After that, I can only improve after stimulating my inner life energy and becoming a knight\u2026\u201dLeylin kept watch on the girl from the Furze Alliance from afar, as he also kept an eye out for useful herbs and materials.After a long time, he finally looked up in disappointment.\u201cIt is as I had feared! The conditions are too different, and the Flowerless Snake Fruits are not able to survive on these grassy plains. I can\u2019t even find any suitable substitute herbs!\u201d\u201cHey! Leylin! It\u2019s time to get on the carriage!\u201d George\u2019s loud shout came from the distance.\u201cGot it!\u201d Wandering afar by himself was not only attention drawing, but also very dangerous. As such, Leylin could only give up on his plan, and return to the horse carriage.[Warning!!! Warning!!! Dangerous creatures are approaching!!!]Just at that moment, the A.I Chip\u2019s mechanical voice sounded out, and red warning words appeared in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes, attracting his attention instantly.\u201cQuick! Show the map now!\u201dLeylin\u2019s facial expression did not change, but he hastened his movement, reaching the limits of his body, and his right hand grasped his Cross Blade firmly.On the virtual map that was projected in front of his eyes, there was a large group of red dots closing in on their group of carriages. The dots were slowly encircling and surrounding them.[Beep! According to the databanks, these dangerous lifeforms have a 97.8% similarity to Direwolves!]\u201cDirewolves!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes narrowed as he recalled the data that had been collected earlier. \u201cDirewolf: A kind of wolf inhabiting the Great Plains of Death. Savage and cruel, they mostly hunt in packs. Their strength is estimated to be around 2-3, agility around 3-4, and vitality around 3-4.\u201d\u201cSuch strength, they are definitely not creatures that I, a mere Knight-in-Training, can handle!\u201dLeylin\u2019s footsteps hastened once more, and he rushed towards George, saying in a low tone: \u201cWe have company. Trouble is afoot!\u201dGeorge looked around at the surrounding crowd, and saw that most of the students were still minding their own business. He quickly retrieved his water bottle in order to hide their actions: \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d\u201cA pack of direwolves! I noticed their tracks!\u201d Leylin said quickly and urgently.\u201cI got it!\u201d George drank a few gulps of water, then gave out a few simple hand signals.The youths from their team who had been chosen as escorts were momentarily startled, but they still remembered their predesignated hand signals. Instantly, they all got moving, pushing the younger girls ahead, and whispering into their ears. The entire process was done swiftly and silently. Although some of the other magus apprentices also noticed something was wrong and followed their retreat, most of them were still oblivious.Sometimes, when danger arose, the only thing you needed to do was to ensure that you ran faster than your companions!!\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Seeing that most of the members of their alliance had successfully retreated, George and Leylin quickly followed suit.\u201cLeylin, you\u2019re unexpectedly even good at scouting!\u201d George said in a low voice to Leylin. After all, they had spent quite some time and were familiar with each other, and he knew that Leylin would not lie to him about something like that.Although the members of the Furze Alliance were quiet and retreating in an orderly manner to refrain from alarming the rest, some of the other acolytes were very discerning, and they quickly joined in the retreat.*Bang* *Bang*!!A loud piercing gong sounded out, \u201cThe Lord Magus\u2019 have sensed danger! All acolytes are to retreat back to the horse carriages!\u201dOne of the black robed men\u2019s voice sounded out, thundering in all the acolytes\u2019 ears.The acolytes who were resting on the grass were all stunned into silence, before they all swarmed into motion, fleeing crazily for the horse carriages.\u201cNo need for hiding anymore! Let\u2019s run!!\u201d George shouted as he drew his sword.By now, all the members of the Furze Alliance had been alerted, and were already quite a distance, and the fastest amongst them had already reached the horse carriages.\u201cAaawoooooo!!!\u201dAt this moment, a long and drawn out howl sounded out, filled with ruthless bloodlust.All around, the wolf howls sounded; since the prey had discovered their stealth attack, they would just charge forth!!!Streak after streak of black shadowy wolves charged after the fleeing acolytes; they were about 2-3 metres long, and their speeds were such that a shimmering black afterimage followed them.\u201cA Direwolf pack!\u201d One of the acolytes at the back cried out in despair.Just as he cried out, a black shadow pounced onto her, the large impact causing this young girl to fall to the ground. In the next instant, the merciless huge jaw filled with sharp teeth bit down viciously, tearing out her throat as she died with a despairing look on her face.Some of the fleeing acolytes were attracted by the cries, and turned their heads to look, before they cried out in alarm as they witnessed the grisly sight and hastened their pace.Another young girl whose face was full of tears was running and shouting: \u201cMummy! Mummy! I want my mummy\u2026!\u201d\u201cThese pitiful youngsters, they are already beginning to lose it?\u201d By now, Leylin had already reached the horse carriages, and could see the entire scene in front of him.*Swoosh* *Swoosh*Right at this point in time, seven dark shadows dashed out from the horse carriages, each wielding a huge sword the size of a man, which slashed through the air as they charged towards the direwolf pack.\u201cIt\u2019s the black robed knights! They\u2019re attacking!\u201d Leylin thought to himself.These direwolves\u2019 stats are about 3 each on average, and are very similar to the knights. However, humans have the ability to use weapons, along with their intelligence; furthermore, the knights should have secret skills which can greatly raise their potential and allow them to burst forth with greater power when necessary! If it\u2019s one versus one or even one versus three, these direwolves will definitely not be a match for the knights. However, with the current numbers\u2026\u201dLeylin had a worried look on his face as he looked at the several hundred red dots encircling them. \u201cPreviously, even with just nearly a hundred direwolves, they managed to get to the horse carriages, and even damage some of the carriages. With these several hundred direwolves\u2026 Perhaps today we will finally see those mysterious Magi show their abilities!\u201d*Psh* !! One of the black robed knights waved his immense blade, weaving a bright silver light in the air as he cleaved a direwolf right into two!\u201cHeh heh!\u201d The knight licked the blood from his lips, looking extremely ferocious: \u201cCome on, my little precious!\u201d\u201cThank\u2026Thank you Sir!\u201d The little girl who was saved kept thanking him repeatedly, the tears still on her cheeks. This was the girl who had been calling out for her mother earlier.\u201cAre you an idiot? Get back now!\u201d The knight\u2019s head did not even turn as he charged forth towards the direwolves.Only then did the little girl seem to reawaken to the reality of the situation, and ran back to the horse carriage.\u201cHurry! Arrange the horse carriages in a circle to use as a defensive formation, the girls should stay behind while the boys, take up your swords and set up a defensive perimeter!\u201dThe black robed knight who remained at the campsite shouted out.\u201cAlright!\u201d George was the first to shout out a reply, jumping up onto one of the carriages to direct the alliance members.\u201cIt\u2019s time to fight for our lives!\u201d Leylin grasped the Cross Blade in his hands and muttered to himself.Looking at the scene before him, he noticed that the members of the Furze Alliance had the least losses due to his timely warning; besides a few who had tripped while running and sustained minor injuries, there were no deaths or major injuries.In contrast, many of the other acolytes had been killed or injured, for example, he had discovered that Ourin\u2019s little party was now missing two youths, while the remaining few had all sustained some form of injuries. It seemed like they had been just lucky enough to escape with their lives.\u201cAlright! We\u2019ve rescued all the ones who can be rescued!\u201dAngelo\u2019s body was covered with blood as he returned to the defensive formation, and he immediately saw Leylin, who was grasping a Cross Blade with both hands and was in a battle-ready stance.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d the black robed knight asked.\u201cAt this time, being afraid won\u2019t be of any help right?\u201d Leylin replied. His hands tightened around his sword; after all, even in his past life, such a bloody scene was not common.\u201cHeh heh! These direwolves are cunning and intelligent, as long as we let them know that we\u2019re not an easy target, and that they will sustain many losses to kill us, they will definitely run away!\u201d Angelo said passively.Although he did not know if the knight was just trying to comfort him, Leylin breathed an obvious sigh of relief.\u201cAowuuu!\u201d The few acolytes that had fallen earlier had perished by now, and with the scent of blood in the air, the direwolves went berserk and charged savagely towards the horse carriages.\u201cHere they come! Everyone be careful! We will try our best to protect you, but there are only so many of us and we will definitely miss some. At that point, you will have to fight for your lives!\u201d Angelo\u2019s loud voice rang out, as he waved his huge sword, standing in the front lines together with the other knights.\u201cKill!\u201d The knights shouted out loud, and Leylin could see a faint light shining around their large swords.As the huge blade cleaved down, the direwolf charging in front had a hole torn in its chest, causing it to roll back as blood sprayed into the air.For a time, the dozen or so black figures stood like an immovable fortress, blocking the direwolves.\u201cWe should fight as well! We need to help the knights and reduce their load!\u201d George walked up to Leylin and said.\u201cYes, if this continues for long, the knights will grow too exhausted to fight, and all of us will be in trouble!\u201d Leylin nodded in agreement.Under George\u2019s leadership, all the men took up their swords and followed behind the knights, attacking the ferocious direwolf pack from the side!\u201cAowuuu!!\u201d The direwolf howls were unceasing, and Leylin was currently facing a 2 metre long huge direwolf.As the direwolf continued snarling, Leylin could smell the stench from it.\u201cA.I Chip! Scan the battlefield and determine the most efficient method of killing!\u201d[Task established. Begin simulation! Begin Assist Mode!] A light flashed in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes, and a panoramic, 3D image appeared before him.The direwolf facing him finally launched an attack, and a gleaming claw specked with blood slashed towards Leylin, bringing along a hot wave of air.[Host is under attack! Most efficient method of dealing with it: use the Cross Blade to block it with a 50 degree angle to the right, then pierce!]\u201cHa!\u201d Leylin shouted out as he circulated the breathing technique, concentrating his strength in his arm muscles as he followed the instructions, sweeping his sword to the right and striking the claw away.*BANG* Leylin felt a shock travel up his arm from the immense impact, making him feel as though he had struck a thick piece of metal.\u201cThis direwolf\u2019s strength is much higher than mine, if I keep doing that, I will be exhausted too quickly. I\u2019ll need to finish this fight quickly!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Immediately afterwards, following the path calculated by the A.I chip, he pierced out towards the Direwolf opposing him.Piercing Attack!!!The Cross Blade Technique was a secret technique passed down through the Farlier family, and the key point was to use a powerful centrifugal force to strike at the enemy.At that moment, Leylin used his waist to exert power. The Cross Blade in his hands whistled as it pierced through the air and slammed towards the Direwolf.Psh!!!Leylin felt the Cross Blade pierce through its flesh, and it seemed as though the Cross Blade in his hands was firmly stuck in the Direwolf. The sheer impact from the blow caused him to tremble, and he tried to retract the Cross Blade.\u201cHe!\u201d Leylin yanked his hands backwards. The Cross Blade was pulled out violently, causing fresh blood to gush out wildly!The Direwolf opposing him screamed miserably. It turned out that Leylin\u2019s sword attack earlier had just happened to pierce into the Direwolf\u2019s foreleg, its weakness. The Direwolf hopped backwards in retreat, and one claw seemed to have already been rendered useless.Seeing the Direwolf escaping, Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed once, but he didn\u2019t pursue it.\u201cMost of the pressure has been taken on by the black robed Knights. If I run out of the defensive perimeter to chase it, that would be tantamount to me committing suicide. Anyways, an injured Direwolf will not be able to attack us again. It\u2019ll probably die after a while, or\u2026 end up as its companion\u2019s meal!\u201d\u201cWell done!\u201d George praised loudly from closeby. At this moment, George also had traces of blood on his body. His attack posture was confident and elegant, and it looked as if he was performing rather than killing. However, he still carried an unparalleled level of strength! He was actually going up against two Direwolves and was still not at a disadvantage.\u201cThe secret sword techniques passed down through noble families really aren\u2019t ordinary!\u201d Leylin thought casually before he once again directed his gaze towards the Direwolf pack in front of him.The tragic fighting between man and Direwolf continued on for half an hour. The sun slowly set, and darkness descended upon the grass plains.At the moment, the eyes of the Direwolves were giving off an aquamarine glow. The entire campground had an eerie feel as it seemed to be surrounded by a crowd of aquamarine eyes.\u201cHah\u2026 hah\u201d Leylin gasped for breath. He now looked as if he had been fished out of a pool of blood. His face was still covered with it, but he lacked the time to even wipe it off.Even with the A.I chip allowing him to use the most efficient methods to kill or injure the Direwolves, he still felt heavily drained from the effort.\u201cIf even I\u2019m like this, there\u2019s no need to speak about the other acolytes. Only the black robed Knights still have energy to spare, but even they will probably be unable to last much longer. In this situation, why haven\u2019t the white robe Magi acted yet?\u201dLeylin glanced over and saw that there was an empty space amidst the female acolytes at the center of the campsite. Three white robed people were sitting there, giving off chilling auras. None of the surrounding acolytes dared to be within three metres of them.As for the Direwolves surrounding the defensive ring, they had already lost one third of their number. However, the number of defending acolytes at the front line had also greatly decreased; most had been injured and were under the care of the girls behind.\u201cIf I was the Direwolf King, the current losses would be enough to make me give up! There should be one final wave of vicious attacks remaining!\u201dLeylin\u2019s sword flickered as it cut at the leg of a Direwolf. At the same time, he took the opportunity to pull out several berries. He tossed them into his mouth and chewed twice before swallowing.These were the useful plants he had collected along the journey. They could quickly replenish the body\u2019s energy, but he was running out of them.\u201cAowuuuuuu!!!\u201d Shrill wolf calls sounded, but this time, they carried a different meaning.The Direwolf pack became more frenzied as it heard the wolf calls. It charged forward without any regard for their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s here, the final wave!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes shifted. He brandished the Cross Blade in his hand as he advanced.Bang!!! Leylin felt a great force run through his hand, and the Cross Blade almost flew out of his hands.\u201cThe Direwolves before us seem to be two times bigger than the others!\u201d Leylin relaxed the muscles in his numbed arm, \u201cA.I Chip, scan the Direwolves in front of me!\u201d[Direwolves. Strength: 2.3 Agility: 4.1 Vitality: 3.1. Description: In a Direwolf pack, there will always be those whose bodies are significantly larger than those of the same race. These will be chosen to be the bodyguards for the head of the wolves. They usually have greater strength than the others of the same race, and at the same time, undying loyalty to the head of the wolves!]This was a paragraph that the previous bratty Leylin had read from a random atlas at some point, and it was now retrieved by the A.I Chip.\u201cHow amazing, looks like the head of the Direwolves is also making a big investment this time!\u201d Leylin thought, before going forward to tussle with the huge Direwolves again.He had been a scientist in the previous world, and had thought that he was no longer hot-blooded. But now, being in this primitive society and killing the Direwolf pack made Leylin feel as if something had aroused in his body, making his blood boil.\u201cThis is unlike the peace in my previous world; these beast-like instincts are needed for a being\u2019s survival!\u201d Leylin realised.\u201cHaha!! Come!! Come!!\u201d Leylin had already trained the breathing technique passed down in his family to a very profound level. Now, he only needed the enlightenment gained from killing in order to stimulate his Life Force and become a true Knight!\u201cKill!!!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes had a hint of red to them as he began to fight madly with the Direwolf.At this moment in time, he finally let go completely. In every sword stroke, he vented the dread of his death in the previous world and the unease of entering a foreign world.\u201cHah!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed as he fought the Direwolf, seemingly having comprehended something.The Cross Blade in his hands hacked downwards, bringing a silver light with it.As it slashed towards the ground, Leylin\u2019s body twisted, and strength was exerted from his powerful waist muscles. With the great centrifugal force of the Cross Blade, he made another Horizontal Slash!The Cross Blade itself seemed to be releasing a dim light. The two slashes seemed to fuse together, forming a radiant cross!Cross Blade Technique Secret Killing Move\u2014\u2014Cross Slash!A Killing Move was something that had the essence of several killing techniques inside, using a profound skill level to raise one\u2019s killing ability.Although it couldn\u2019t compare to the Knight Secret Skills that increased all stats, Preparatory Knights who possessed a Killing Move could still threaten a True Knight with Life Force!The Cross Blade viciously slashed the Direwolf\u2019s body, and opened a large wound in the shape of a cross. The Direwolf whined as fresh blood sprayed out continuously.\u201cNow!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes shone as he charged forward.Advance! Jump Slash!The Cross Blade swung past, and the Direwolf\u2019s huge head was sent flying!The surrounding Direwolves jumped in fright, and the attack slowed down. Even the surrounding black robed Knights looked over in shock.Leylin felt a sense of contentment as he stepped on the giant Direwolf\u2019s head, and he couldn\u2019t help but roar.\u201cHuuu\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve already vented, so it\u2019s time to retreat!\u201dAfter roaring, Leylin didn\u2019t choose to go forward to kill again, but instead turned around to return to the defensive perimeter. This allowed a well-rested defender to take over his position.\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. The Killing Move just now was too exhausting, and I\u2019ve already vented out all the negative emotions in my heart. I should save some strength for self-protection.\u201dLeylin received a bottle from a girl with trembling hands, and began to drink with big gulps.By drinking water, he managed to conceal his eyes which were exuding intelligence. \u201cI have killed the highest number of Direwolves besides the black robes. With this, no one can force me to enter the battlefield again. Next, I must maintain my strength, and witness the white robes\u2019 actions at the same time!\u201dBased on the collected figures, the A.I Chip calculated that there was a 98% chance of a slip up by the black robes. The Direwolf pack would thus break through the perimeter, and casualties would appear among the acolytes. At that point, no matter how much the white robed Magi wanted to stay out of this, they would have to act.\u201cAowuuuu!!!\u201d With the non-stop howling from the head Direwolf hidden amidst the Direwolf pack, the Direwolf pack\u2019s charge became more aggressive. The ones that appeared now were the giant bodyguard Direwolves. The throat of the frontmost acolyte was torn out, and he toppled over.\u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer! Activate your Secret Skills!\u201d The black robe Angelo shouted.At that moment, the black robes released crackling sounds as their muscles continuously expanded. At first glance, their overgrown muscles made them look like small giants.\u201cIt\u2019s appeared! The Secret Skills of the Knights!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t blink. \u201cA.I Chip, collect data!\u201d[Beep! Task Established, Data Collection in progress!][Knight Secret Skill (Strength Type?): After activation, Vitality, Strength and Defense increase, Agility decreases! In the middle of Data Collection for circulation path of life energy, 43% recorded. Remaining information insufficient, unable to analyse!]Looking at the screen in front of his eyes, Leylin felt some regret, \u201cI still can\u2019t understand how the Life Force of Knights is activated! But if I have a Knight-level guinea pig to dissect, then I might just be able to understand\u2026\u2026..\u201dAs for the black robed Knights who had activated their Secret Skills, not only did their muscle strengths increase, their defenses seemed to have increased as well. The giant bodyguard Direwolves still needed to be avoided, but the Knights used the giant sword to hack at the forehead of the normal Direwolves despite being cut by their claws.But with the increase in giant bodyguard Direwolves, a Direwolf had finally managed to slip through a gap and charge into the crowd of acolytes.\u201cAh! Save me!!\u201d \u201cDaddy!! Mummy!!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to die yet!!!\u201dThe sound of various cries and screams resounded through the air and the campsite turned into utter chaos.\u201cIn the end, they\u2019re just a bunch of thirteen and fourteen year old kids!!\u201d Leylin sighed.\u201cAowuuuu!\u201d As if by chain reaction, another giant Direwolf broke through their defenses, landing within the area occupied by the Furze Alliance.\u201cLeylin! Come and kill it with me!\u201d George\u2019s neck was wrapped up in gauze. It wasn\u2019t known which noble family\u2019s young lady wrapped it. Not only was it thickly wrapped up, it was even knotted in a bow, the sight making Leylin want to laugh out loud.\u201cNo need! Give me the crossbow!\u201d\u201cThis?\u201d George removed the crossbow from his back, and passed it to Leylin, \u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no use! These mongrels have thick skin and flesh. If you can\u2019t hit their weak points\u2026\u2026..Oh! God! Dammit!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Calculation of trajectory complete!]Following the A.I Chip\u2019s calculated trajectory, Leylin pulled the trigger of the crossbow.\u201cWhoosh!!!\u201d The powerful crossbow bolt flew out, and the strong recoil caused Leylin\u2019s arm to feel slightly numb.\u201cPu!!!\u201d The crossbow arrow entered through the left eye of the Direwolf, and exited out of its right eye. The Direwolf howled twice, crumpling to the floor.\u201cThe advantage I have with the A.I Chip in this kind of high-accuracy work is really too great! A crossbow isn\u2019t like a bow; all you have to do is aim and pull the trigger. It\u2019s so convenient!\u201dLeylin compared the differences between him swinging around the Cross Blade before, and using the crossbow. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019m more suited towards long distance attacks. This is also much safer. It\u2019s just that I still have no idea how to activate the Life Force of Knights. Could it be that experiencing a really tough battle is required?\u201dLeylin hadn\u2019t used a crossbow earlier. The first reason for this was to vent. The second was to make an attempt at activating the Life Force of Knights. Unfortunately, he possessed the A.I Chip as one of his cards, and had never been forced into a desperate life or death situation. Naturally, he was unable to experience the feeling of the Life Force that was activated in a desperate situation.\u201cLeylin! Good job!\u201d George only responded now, and he patted Leylin on the shoulder.\u201cFrom today onwards, this crossbow is yours!\u201d\u201cThanks then!\u201d Leylin smiled. Even if George hadn\u2019t said anything, he would still have tried to obtain the crossbow.\u201cOh!!! Leylin! Leylin has killed Direwolves, lord Leylin! Lord Leylin! Quickly save us!\u201dAt this point, more Direwolves charged into the campsite, and students cried out towards Leylin.With the benefit of George\u2019s prior preparations, the losses on their side had been the least. With George and Leylin, these two experts who were Preparatory Knights, it was considered the safest place apart from the area around the white robes.\u201cHu!!!\u201d Ourin sucked in huge breaths as he used a sword to block a Direwolf that was leaping forward. A huge force was transmitted over, causing the Cross Blade in his hands to fly away.\u201cI am the successor of my house! I still haven\u2019t enjoyed a lot of things! How could I die here?\u201dOurin roared. Of his surrounding comrades two had already died. Among the remaining people, if they weren\u2019t dead, then they had already escaped.At this moment, shouts of \u201cLord Leylin!\u201d could be heard, causing his eyes to shine.\u201cThat\u2019s right! \u00a0The Furze Alliance still has strength, and Leylin was so impressive just now. He can definitely save me!\u201dOurin didn\u2019t hesitate anymore and began to run in that direction.\u201cLeylin!!! Lord Leylin!!! Save me!!!\u201d\u201cWell!\u201d Leylin readied the crossbow, hearing the sound and taking a look, \u201cIt\u2019s Ourin after all!\u201dThe current Ourin looked embarrassing. Not only had the Cross Blade been dropped, his whole body carried wounds and he was being closely pursued by a Direwolf.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity! You\u2019ve looked for the wrong person! Did you really think I would be so magnanimous?\u201d Leylin\u2019s mouth formed a grin.\u201cWith the white robed Magi here, I don\u2019t dare to take my chances and secretly kill someone! But if it\u2019s only not being able to save them in time, no one will have a reason to find trouble over that!\u201dLeylin looked at Ourin, showing a brilliant smile.\u201cHe\u2019ll save me! Definitely!!!\u201d Ourin saw Leylin\u2019s smile, and his heart relaxed. He continuously encouraged himself, increasing his running speed.\u201cOhhhh!!!! Noooo!!!!\u201d At that moment, Ourin despairingly saw Leylin shoot the crossbow, dealing with a Direwolf on another side.\u201cHow could you, how could you do this???\u201d Ourin\u2019s mind went blank for a moment and he tripped on a rock, falling onto the ground.The Direwolf behind him shot forward. Its teeth bit down and blood began to flow non-stop\u2026\u2026\u201cThanks!!\u201d On the other side, the girl saved by Leylin ran to him to thank him, \u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cNo need for thanks!\u201d Leylin smiled. On the other side, Lilith looked at Leylin with her face red and lowered her head.There was a whistling sound, and George looked at Lilith, directing a \u2018you understand\u2019 gaze towards Leylin.\u201cThe situation is already like this, but your personality hasn\u2019t changed, George!\u201d\u201cEven if I fall into the abyss of death, you can\u2019t stop the yearning I have for beautiful romances!\u201d George used the tone of a martyr, speaking as if he was unafraid of death.\u201cYou won\u2019t die, the white robes are about to make their move!\u201d Leylin rolled his eyes.Even though the field was in chaos, the giant Direwolves seemed to have an amazing sixth sense. They had never bothered the three white robed Magi, forming a strange circle.And amidst the noise, Leylin could still use the five senses that were strengthened by the A.I Chip to catch the conversation between the white robed Magi. Perhaps they themselves had not even concealed it.\u201cCrow! Are we still not making our move? The Acolytes have too many casualties, and that will lower our rating!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cRelax! Relax! I\u2019ve been counting. Up until now, ten have died so far. The limit hasn\u2019t been passed yet!\u201dA slightly cynical voice travelled over; it was a man\u2019s voice.\u201cBut it\u2019s still reaching the limit, act quickly. I still need to determine the stability model for this technique! Dammit! The negative energy here is simply too high. It\u2019s simply impossible to complete the construction of the \u2018Tokerwuree!\u2019\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it!\u201d The white robed man who hadn\u2019t spoken before stood up.\u201cThese mysterious Magi! The mysterious people rumored to be able to manipulate the forces of nature!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes stared at the white robed man.\u201cAll of you stupid and lowly beasts, you actually dare to bother the rest of the venerated lord Magi! Only death can be your eternal home!\u201d\u201cMazzerda \u2014Karachi!\u201dWith the chanting sounds of the white robed man, Leylin\u2019s ears heard the A.I Chip madly sounding out. [ALERT!!! ALERT!!! Discovered radiation source!!! Discovered negative energy field!!! Suggestion for Host to immediately evacuate far away!]The bright red words were so obvious, but Leylin wasn\u2019t frightened into retreating at all. He only repeatedly recalled the chanting of the white robed man.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem to be the language used on the continent, but an ancient one instead. It seems like quite the tongue twister, do Magi use this kind of language to chant?\u201dAnd as the white robed man stood up, the surrounding Direwolves retreated, as if they had met some kind of natural enemy.\u201cSecondary Energy Fireball!\u201dAfter the chant was completed, a floating fireball appeared in the man\u2019s hand out of nowhere. According to the calculations of Leylin\u2019s A.I Chip, this fireball was at least one thousand degrees, and was actually causing the surrounding space to distort faintly.The fireball left a blazing trail, and landed on the Direwolf\u2019s heart.Boom!!!!\u201cNot good! Quickly crouch down!\u201d Leylin shouted loudly. Unfortunately, it was already too late. It didn\u2019t matter whether it was the acolytes or the Direwolves in the surroundings, everyone was sent toppling over.A loud explosion resounded, bringing with it a wave of heat.\u201cPuff!!! Pui pui!!!\u201d Leylin got up from the ground, hurriedly spitting out the soil and grass in his mouth.At this moment, he was covered in dirt, and looked like a person who had just crawled out of a muddy pit.\u201cAccording to the A.I Chip\u2019s calculations, that area should have been where the head of the Direwolves was positioned, sssss\u2026\u2026.\u201d Leylin climbed onto the horse carriage. He looked in the direction of the area attacked by the Magus just now and couldn\u2019t help but suck in a sharp breath.He could only see that where the fireball landed, there was now an additional pit of fire that was three metres in length and width, and two metres deep. As for the Direwolves in that area, they had already become burnt charcoal.The Direwolves whimpered, before quickly escaping.\u201cHe has the body of a human, and is able to attack to this extent! This, this is the strength of a Magus?\u201d Leylin looked at the white robed Magus, eyes burning with passion, \u201cThe strength of a Magus! I must obtain it!\u201d\u201cQuickly! Clean up the battlefield!\u201d The white robed man said, ignoring the fervent gazes of the surrounding acolytes. He returned to his original place, where the two other Magi were.When he passed by Ourin\u2019s corpse, he stopped. He took a small golden pouch from Ourin\u2019s bosom, and placed it into his own bosom.\u201cThis\u2026..seems to be the bag Ourin used to store Magic Crystals!\u201d Leylin pupils shrank.\u201cEvaluation! Boundary! Magic Crystals!\u201d Leylin\u2019s mind raced. \u201cIt looks like these Magi received a task, which was why they helped escort us acolytes. It seems there was a death count quota that would\u2019ve lowered their evaluation and decreased their rewards if they had passed it!\u201d\u201cAnd it seems that I had slightly underestimated the value of Magic Crystals before. These white robe Magi let the acolytes die, most likely because they had planned to take away the Magic Crystals of the dead acolytes!\u201d\u201cLuckily, now that the dead acolytes have reached the danger limit already, we\u2019ll be safer from here on!\u201dAfter thinking it through clearly, Leylin\u2019s face turned ashen, \u201cThis is the world of Magi? Logical to the point of cold-bloodedness! Cold to the point of apathy!\u201d\u201cEveryone, quickly pack up so we can continue our journey. The smell of blood here will attract other predators!\u201dThe black robed Knight Angelo took off the outer clothes that had been torn due to the activation of the Secret Skill. The sweat on his face flowed nonstop, and he was gasping for air, looking slightly weakened.Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed with light, \u201cIt looks like a price needs to be paid to activate the Secret Skill for Knights\u2026\u201d\u201cHey! Leylin, look!\u201d Just as Leylin was about to enter the carriage, George snuck over and surreptitiously pointed to the side.On another black-coloured horse carriage, Bessita was hugging her legs as she sat. Her shoulder had bloody marks on it, and she looked like she had just gone through a crying session.\u201cOurin has always been Bessita\u2019s number one Flower Guardian. Now that that group is almost completely dead, Bessita\u2019s situation isn\u2019t looking very good!\u201dGeorge said next to Leylin\u2019s ear, with an expression that implied that Leylin\u2019s chance had come.\u201cI\u2019ve already lost interest in her! Anyway, we\u2019re in such danger, can\u2019t you control your lower half a little?\u201dLeylin didn\u2019t really know what to say. He pointed to George\u2019s collar, and on those clothes were marks from a girl\u2019s lipstick. He really didn\u2019t know when this beast had been able to fool around.\u201cHehe\u2026.my brother, it\u2019s only in this kind of dangerous moment that we Preparatory Knights can show our might! And girls will always show goodwill towards the man who saved them. This is the most basic of techniques!\u201dGeorge took out something that was similar to a handkerchief from his bosom, smugly showing his harvest. \u201cCan you see? Just today, I\u2019ve already won the goodwill of three ladies\u2026..\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026.\u201d Leylin had nothing to say.When thinking of his playboy past, \u201cIt seems that the previous Leylin always used force when he met a girl he liked, seriously\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, it\u2019s time to set off!\u201d Leylin saw the black robed Knights gather the acolyte corpses together. They took out several Magic Crystals and passed them to the white robed Magi, before hurriedly changing the topic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayArrival\u201cThe Death Prairie is indeed a place no ordinary person can cross!\u201dLeylin sat in the carriage as his body constantly jolted up and down. The tiny window opened as a golden ray of sunshine peeked in, giving the interior of the carriage a trace of liveliness.It had already been over ten days since the attack of the Plains Direwolves pack. During these ten days, the travelling party encountered an increasing amount of danger as they ventured deeper into the plains.Only now did Leylin find out that the Plains\u2019 Direwolves were merely at the bottom of the food chain. There were still many more cunning and vicious predators above them.On the way, Leylin saw several animal colonies whose numbers were not inferior to that of the Direwolf pack from before.Besides the Plains\u2019 Direwolves, there were flocks of huge black birds that were several meters tall and even enormous monsters, dozens of meters long, which looked like sabre-tooth tigers, except their bodies were like tiny mountains. Just their aura alone caused Leylin to feel suffocated.Fortunately, the deaths of the apprentices seemed to have reached the limit and the white robed Magi had started to act. Not only did they set up magical defensive arrays on the carriages, they also directly stepped forward to disperse the animal groups that attacked. Through these measures, a large number of casualties was prevented.The most dangerous time was when they confronted the monster that was dozens of meters long.Thankfully, that small mountain-like monster seemed to possess some intelligence and knew that the white robed Magi were not to be trifled with. It quickly left after a short confrontation and did not unleash any attacks, causing everyone in the travelling party to sigh in relief.\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201d Leylin took out his pocket watch and looked at the clock hand. It had already reached the 3 o\u2019clock position.He stood up and opened the front door of the carriage. A moist breeze blew towards him, bringing a salty smell with it. It smelt very fresh and clean and Leylin could not help but deeply breath in a few times before seating himself besides Angelo.\u201cGood afternoon! Sir Angelo!\u201d\u201cGood afternoon! Such a courteous noble gentleman!\u201d Angelo did not turn as he directly handed over the horsewhip and reins to Leylin, \u201cGood timing, I need to rest for a while!\u201dLeylin chuckled as he received the horsewhip and skilfully urged on the carriage.Angelo leaned to one side as he unclasped a bottle at his waist. When he opened it, a strong alcohol smell floated out, and as he lowered his head to take a gulp, his eyes narrowed in joy.\u201cWe are about to reach our destination. Based on the fact that you\u2019ve helped me drive the carriage for a month, I can answer two of your questions!\u201dLeylin was just enjoying the view on both sides when he heard Angelo\u2019s voice sound out.\u201cAlright!\u201d Leylin lightly smiled. He had specially tried to get into Angelo\u2019s good books and this was one of the reasons why he had done so.\u201cThen my first question is, what will there be at our destination?\u201d\u201cSome temporary tents set up by the various magus academies. Over there, all of you can freely choose an academy to join based on your interests and also undergo an even more accurate aptitude test!\u201dAngelo looked a little impatient as he answered, \u201cThese things will be explained by the great Magi when we arrive, don\u2019t waste your opportunity!\u201d\u201cAn accurate aptitude test?\u201d Leylin was stunned. Soon after, he recalled that they had only managed to identify his talent in magic initially before being sent onto the carriage by the viscount. As for how good his talent was in comparison to others, he did not have the slightest inkling.\u201cTemporary tents set up by the magus academies? Looks like this is similar to the school recruitments of my previous world. I wonder what the requirements are.\u201d Leylin silently thought to himself.\u201cAlright then! My second question! In your heart, what is a Magus!\u201dLeylin asked his second question.\u201cA Magus? They control enormous power and pursue the truth, with equivalent exchange as their doctrine. Brat, don\u2019t daydream of obtaining any free benefits from a Magus, or else the flames of desire will gush out from the abyss and punish your soul!\u201dAngelo\u2019s face twitched as if he had thought of an unfortunate event, while his voice became extremely low.\u201cPursuit of truth, equivalent exchange? I like it!\u201d The corners of Leylin\u2019s mouth formed a smile.After answering, Angelo seemed to have lost all interest in talking. He ferociously chugged down two mouthfuls of the potent alcohol as he lowered his head and closed his eyes. Ten minutes later, the sounds of snoring could be heard.Leylin dully gazed at the scenery to his front. Although the plains were very beautiful, after a whole month of looking at the same things, he now felt like throwing up at the sight of it.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the carriage continued to advance, the green in the distance became less and less. In place of it was a vast blue, and wave after wave of strong winds.\u201cWe\u2019ve finally arrived, the Death Beach!\u201dThe sleeping Angelo opened his eyes and looked at Leylin, \u201cWe\u2019ve reached our destination!\u201dAs they neared the sea, a small town-like place appeared at the end of his line of sight.Numerous tents of various shapes and sizes stood together, and they formed a huge camp. Surrounding them were dozens of carriages similar to the one Leylin was driving.And what numbered the most were acolytes of similar ages as them, around thirteen to fourteen years old, each and every one of them carrying looks of curiosity on their faces. Leylin did a rough estimate, and counted that there were at least hundreds of them, filling up the entire camp. From time to time, some acolytes walked out from the tents, many different expressions adorning their faces.\u201cAlright! Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the intermediate stop of our travelling destination, the Death Beach! You will all decide on your future academy here, and then return back to your respective academies with your teachers to practice magic!\u201dThe horse carriaged halted, and three white robes came out and gathered the acolytes, then the leader Crow began speaking.\u201cNow, follow me into the campgrounds, and choose an academy. \u00a0Remember, you may check on all the various academies, but once you have signed a contract to join one, you must not renege! Anyone who disobeys will be hung to death at the gate of the camp!\u201dCrow\u2019s frosty words made the acolytes hearts turn cold.\u201cHaha! Crow! You guys are pretty late today!\u201d A voice sounded, and a fatty walked out from the camp grounds. He too was wearing a white robe, and he greeted: \u201cDon\u2019t scare these adorable newbies!\u201d\u201cThere were some difficulties along the way!\u201d Crow explained.\u201cAlright! Newbies! Now follow me into the camp!\u201d Fatty spoke with Crow and the others for a while more, then turned his head and shouted to Leylin and the rest.\u201cYou guys can call me Jevon, of the beautiful Ennea Ivory Ring Tower. Trust me, if you are to choose an academy, the Ennea Ivory Ring Tower is definitely your best choice!\u201dJevon said, as he brought the acolytes into the camp.Once they entered, various sounds travelled into their ears, reminding Leylin of the marketplaces in his previous world. As for Crow and the other two white robes, they seemed to have something else to do, and they soon left the group.The surroundings were bustling with activity, mostly due to acolytes just like them. Some of them had gathered in a circle, while there were others who were entering or exiting the tents.Jevon brought Leylin and the rest, a total of 40 odd people, into the middle of the camp grounds.Here, was a large tent of pure white colour, and there were still strange flower patterns on the outside of it They seemed like both ornaments, and yet resembled writing as well.Leylin could not help but look at it closely, \u201cA.I Chip! Begin Scan!\u201d[Beep! Forming Image!] The A.I Chip sent the information, but in the constructed image, there was nothing on the white tent, as if the pattern had never existed before.\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Leylin stared at the tent once again with disbelief.With every passing minute and second, the patterns on the tent seemed lifelike, constantly twisting itself.\u201cHehe!\u201d \u201cHaha!\u201d \u201cJi ji!\u201dVarious noises travelled to Leylin\u2019s ears. The surrounding lights seemed to distort itself, and Leylin looked at his own hands. At this point, his arm seemed to have been pulled into a long shape, which looked extremely slender.\u201cLeylin! Leylin! What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d At this point, there was a pat on Leylin\u2019s shoulder.Leylin\u2019s whole body suddenly quivered, and he came to his senses. Looking at the surroundings, the acolytes were still listening to Fatty Jevon\u2019s speech, and everything seemed to revert back to its normal state.\u201cCould it be that it wasn\u2019t an illusion earlier?\u201d Leylin got scared, \u201cA.I Chip, reproduce the situation I was in earlier!\u201d[Beep!] A pale blue light display appeared, and the series of images earlier appeared continuously in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes, [An anomaly in the cerebral vessel, an immediate inspection is proposed!][An anomaly is found in the Host\u2019s condition! Staying away is advised!][The Host body has returned to normal!] Numerous lines of data kept emerging, which let Leylin know that it was not an illusion earlier.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026Magi, are they always this mysterious?\u201d Leylin wiped his cold sweat off, still carrying a lingering fear of the events earlier.\u201cLeylin! Your complexion is really bad! Could it be that you have fallen ill?\u201d George asked from the side.\u201cNo matter who, their expressions won\u2019t be any better if they had experienced that earlier!\u201d\u201cNot\u2026\u2026Nothing\u2026\u2026Where did Jevon stop at?\u201d Leylin hurriedly digressed.\u201cOh! We need to fill in a form, and take the aptitude test! And then it will be free time, and we can choose our academy autonomously!\u201d\u201cBecause you guys have come a day late, you only have a day\u2019s worth of time left, and in this span of period, you must choose an academy where you will practice magic in, if not you will have to wait until next year!\u201d Jevon was still speaking loudly ahead of them.Now, all of you line up and take the form from me one by one, and then enter for the test!\u201dJevon sat behind a white table, and took out a stack of forms and placed them down.The line moved forward quickly, and very soon it was Leylin\u2019s turn.\u201cFill in your particulars in this form, and then enter the tent and follow the instructions of the person inside!\u201dLeylin took the form, and realised that it was made of sheepskin paper. The particulars required were minimal, only a name, age and location born, as well as a few others.Picking up the goose feather pen on the table, Leylin filled in the form very quickly.The faint, red coloured, inked flower patterns on the sheepskin seemed to be very beautiful.\u201cI never thought that this brat\u2019s handwriting from the mainland is still pretty good!\u201d After Leylin finished writing, he picked up the sheepskin paper and entered the white tent.\u201cCome over!\u201d An ancient voice sounded.It was very spacious inside the tent, and there was only a white haired old lady sitting on a black chair and a crystal ball which rested on a table.\u201cOkay! Why would I suddenly think of those divination witches!\u201d\u201cHello!\u201d Leylin greeted the witch.\u201cBring the form here!\u201d Clearly, this witch was not having any of it, and her voice was still frosty cold.\u201cLeylin huh? Place your hands on the crystal ball!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Vibrations!A strange tactile feeling was transmitted from the tip of his fingers.Leylin\u2019s head hurt, as if there was a glass rod stirring inside.Along with the start of his headache, the crystal ball in front of Leylin also emitted a faint glow.\u201cVery good! Don\u2019t let go! The witch stared attentively at the crystal ball.As the pain increased, the crystal ball in Leylin\u2019s hands also grew brighter, \u201cNo! No more!\u201dLeylin clenched his teeth, and the pain that practically split his brain into two caused him to loosen his grip uncontrollably.\u201cOkay! So you are at this level?\u201d The witch nodded her head. She took out a goose feather pen and scribbled on Leylin\u2019s form.\u201cWe have categorised the aptitude of the acolytes into five grades, with the first grade as the worst and the fifth grade as the best. You are at the third grade, a middle ranked grade!!!\u201dThe witch said as she turned a ring on her hand and made a strange mark on the sheepskin, which had been shining brightly with light.\u201cMy examination here is over, you go on behind me! Next!!!\u201dSeeing a young girl with freckles entering the tent, Leylin took the sheepskin paper, stood up and gave his thanks, and then lifted the hanging curtain of the tent, heading to the next procedure in line.The area was still as spacious as the one earlier, and in the middle, there was a white bearded old geezer.\u201cFrom the layout of this tent, there should only be two tests. It is really simple!\u201d Leylin thought, as he sat in front of the old geezer and handed the form over to him.\u201cThird Grade? Not too bad!\u201d The white bearded old geezer stroked his chin, \u201cAlright! Now to test for elemental affinity!\u201dThe old geezer knocked on the tabletop and it split open, and a black basin rose from the centre.This water basin was not smooth. It seemed to be made of stone, and there was a kind of liquid metal flowing inside that resembled mercury.\u201cCarefully look into the water!\u201d The old geezer\u2019s voice sounded, seemingly carrying an authoritative tone.Leylin could not help but to divert all his attention towards the centre of the water basin. With his constant focus, the mercury in the middle swirled continuously and turned into a whirlpool, as if a mouth had opened at the bottom.\u201cNow, tell me, what do you see?\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes were a little glazed over, \u201cShadows, and a black coloured whirlpool! And there are red spots near the outer circumference!\u201d\u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cThere are also green specks of light in the surrounding area!\u201d\u201cIs there a lot of green?\u201d\u201cNot at all! Very little!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d The old geezer snapped his fingers, and Leylin suddenly came back to his senses, \u201cWhat happened to me!\u201d\u201cYour test is already over! In the aspect of elemental affinities, you have the highest affinity with the Shadow and Dark elements, after that is the Fire element, and you also have a smidgen of affinity with the Plant element!\u201dAs the old geezer spoke, he rapidly filled in the form and added his handprint.\u201cLet me give you some advice! Magi are able to use every kind of energy! But only by following the path you have the highest affinity with, can you progress the furthest!\u201dThe old geezer handed the form back to Leylin, \u201cAlright! Your test is over. Walk out from the back entrance and start choosing your academy!\u201dLeylin bowed, and then left the tent.As he lifted the canopy at the back, a ray of sunlight came shining down.\u201cA.I Chip, reproduce the state I was in earlier!\u201d[\u2026\u2026An unknown interference has caused the host to enter a state of hypnosis!]\u201cAs expected!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face darkened, and then he exhaled helplessly, \u201cThankfully, the other party does not have any bad intentions, if not\u2026\u2026\u201dDeep in his heart, his thirst for power only grew more intense.\u201cHey! Leylin!\u201d George\u2019s voice rang beside his ears, \u201cYou finished your aptitude test too?\u201dGeorge\u2019s voice travelled over.\u201cYeah!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and waved the sheepskin paper form in his hands.\u201cI have completed it too, hehe! I, this young master, am a genius with a fourth grade aptitude!\u201d George laughed loudly, wearing an excessively smug expression!\u201cI am not too familiar with the grading of acolytes, could you explain it in detail for me?\u201d Leylin asked.George\u2019s family was much greater than Viscount Farlier\u2019s family, and he was able to know more secrets regarding the Magi.\u201cOf course! This is all common knowledge. No matter which academy you enter, there will be people who will tell you.\u201d George said.\u201cThe aptitudes of the acolytes are ranked according to the chance of being promoted to a proper Magus, and they are categorised into 5 grades! And the fifth grade is the highest, with a 90 percent chance of becoming a Magus!\u201d\u201cThe fourth grade is slightly inferior, but there is still a 50 percent chance! I, this young master, am a genius at this level! Haha\u2026\u2026My father will definitely be elated!\u201d George digressed, he was clearly too excited.\u201cAnd the rest? Hurry and say it!\u201d Leylin punched George\u2019s shoulder and finally brought George back on track.\u201cOh? Earlier I mentioned up to the fourth grade. What\u2019s below it is the third grade, where there is a ten percent chance of becoming a Magus. As for the second grade, there is only a 2 to 3 percent chance, and the first grade is the worst, with only a 1 percent or even 0.1 percent chance.\u201d\u201cAnyway, there is only a chance for third grade and above. As for the first and second grade, basically, they can only be an acolyte their whole life!\u201d\u201cSo that is the case. It seems like my grade is middle ranked. There should be no academy that will reject me, nor would they regard me as important!\u201d Leylin analysed his current situation.\u201cHow about elemental affinity?\u201d Leylin continued asking.\u201cElemental affinity is the future path of a Magus, you know, some Magi can manipulate lightning, some Magi can manipulate fire, and some others can even manipulate frost! These are all paths of choice.\u201d\u201cAlthough a Magus is able to use any type of elemental spell in theory, the ones with the highest affinity will not only let the casting speed be faster, but also contain more power. If a Fire element Magus wanted to cast a water-based spell, not only would he consume more spiritual energy, but the might of the spell would also weaken greatly. There could be a water-based pool summoning that ends up as only a water ball!\u201d\u201cAll in all, the elemental affinity will determine the path of a Magus, and the aptitude will determine how far a Magus can walk on that path!\u201dGeorge concluded.\u201cThe last sentence makes perfect sense, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be yours!\u201d Leylin repeated the words of the last sentence.\u201cHe he! You found out. These are the words of a travelling Magus! I saw them in my father\u2019s study room.\u201d George said embarrassedly, as he scratched his head.\u201cOh right! I finally managed to inquire as to why the black robed Knights were so cold and distant!\u201dGeorge seemed to have remembered something, and was itching to share the news.\u201cThe strength of a Magus, even if he is only an acolyte, is not something a Knight can withstand, so don\u2019t you think that the black robes\u2019 performance when we journeyed was a little strange?\u201d\u201cThere is indeed something strange about it!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and asked with a conjecture, \u201cCould it be that they have some background?\u201d\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d George shook his head, \u201cMy dear brother, you are guessing in the completely wrong direction; these black robed Knights are actually one of the experiments of a Magus!!\u201d\u201cAn experiment!!!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes widened. In his world, conducting a live experiment had always been a taboo for science, and even if there were any, they were done in secrecy. But here, they had actually done it so openly and aboveboard.\u201cIn the process of the experiment, this batch of experiment samples had already sustained an overdose of radiation and would not live more than several years. That was why they were used as disposables, to escort acolytes like us!\u201d\u201cThis was the reason?\u201d Leylin thought of Angelo\u2019s pale face, and silently nodded his head.Earlier, the A.I Chip had scanned and detected traces of radiation, but the radiation discovered on the white robe Magi were a hundred times more concentrated, so Leylin naturally thought that there was no effect.\u201cFor us Magi, we will be acolytes at least; which knight would not want to prostrate themselves and hope that we pick them to serve us in the future. The only ones who will not take us seriously are those who will not live for longer than a few days!\u201dGeorge said with some regrets. His face was indignant, it seems like, as a heir to a large noble family, he was displeased with the rude manners of the black robes from before.\u201cI heard that for the guys from the West, not only had they been treated like young masters by the knights along the journey, they had even slept with some of them!\u201d George\u2019s dissatisfaction only lasted a moment, before it turned into a vulgar expression.\u201cSlept with some of them?\u201d Leylin was a little more awake, \u201cThere are also female knights?\u201d\u201cOf course, although female knights are generally quite muscular, a few have practiced some unique techniques so they still look pretty good!\u201d\u201cAlso, a female knight\u2019s stamina is rather good and can withstand all kinds of treatment. Especially during intercourse, her pair of toned thighs wrapping around you, that feeling is too wonderful for words!\u201d George\u2019s current character was that of a lecherous swine.Leylin recalled his memories. The brat of the past was also a playboy, but obviously he could not compete with George who was from such a large noble family, so he had indeed not touched a pretty female knight before.There were several female knights under the Viscount, but they all had bulging muscles, which made Leylin feel revolted.Shaking his head, he did not wish to discuss the contents of this matter with George.\u201cI understand now. Let\u2019s go and choose our academy!\u201d\u201cThis! My father has already chosen for me, I\u2019ll be attending the Ennea Ivory Ring Tower. My family has a relationship with one of the senior Magi inside\u2026\u2026Why don\u2019t you come with me too!\u201d George gave an invitation.Leylin was a little tempted, but seeing the ring on his neck, he still hesitated,\u201cEarlier, that Magus never said which academy the ring could help me get into. What if it turns into a restriction instead?\u201d\u201cNo! I wish to walk and look around more!\u201d Leylin declined politely.\u201cAlright then, I am going to carry out the procedures. You can come to the area for the Ennea Ivory Ring Tower to look for me!\u201d George waved his hands and squeezed into the crowd.\u201cWhere should I go? I don\u2019t care anymore; let\u2019s check out the academies first!\u201dLeylin strolled aimlessly around the camp, and saw all sorts of interesting tents with strange shapes and sizes. Some were like a giant mushroom, where a small fan shaped door opened in the middle, and some might very well have used some sort of strange horned devil skull, where the acolytes can walk into the tent through the devil\u2019s ferocious mouth as though they were stepping into a haunted house.And at the front of all these different buildings were marked with words.\u201cIt is the language of the mainland, that\u2019s still fine!\u201dLeylin took a look, saw some of the academy names, and memorised them, \u201cEnnea Ivory Ring Tower, Mercifura Academy, Wetland Gardens\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Scan the patterns on the ring, and compare them with images of the academies I passed by before!\u201d[Beep! Mission initialising, beginning to scan. Scan complete, comparing with database\u2026\u2026][Comparison completed. Similarity level: Abyssal Bone Forest Academy 67.3%, Mercifura Academy 54.4%, Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut 23.1% \u2026\u2026]\u201cSo these three academies have the highest probabilities?\u201dLeylin stroked his chin, \u201cFrom the various introductions of the academies, I remember that Mercifura Academy specialises in the Fire and Plant Elements, as well as the creation of Magic Artifacts. Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut is not known for famous Shadow and Dark Element Magi either.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is the best choice? They\u2019re famous for their specialisation in the Dark Element, and is also a pioneer in the research ofsouls/spirit force? .\u201d\u201cBut this Abyssal Bone Forest Academy! Why does the name sound like a cult from the previous world?!\u201d\u201cIt seems like a Shadow and Dark Element affinity user like me can never get close to the light!\u201d After thinking for a while, Leylin still decided to take a look no matter what. At the very least, one cannot hinder their progress based on a name alone.\u201cI remember the recruiting area for the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes; it seems to be on the east side of the camp!\u201dLeylin walked for about 10 minutes and finally reached a tent that was constructed with numerous white bones. The words on top were arranged to form, \u201cThe Abyssal Bone Forest Academy welcomes you!\u201d These big words were all written in red and dripping blood, which scared many of the surrounding acolytes away, and seeing this made Leylin rather speechless.\u201cWhy would they construct such a scary looking scene? To frighten people? They could have at least done it after signing the contract; otherwise all the acolytes will be scared away!\u201dLeylin shook his head, and walked into the tent of white bones.As he entered, a cold aura that reeked of blood engulfed Leylin and made his hair stand on ends.\u201cHe he he\u2026\u2026After waiting for long, finally one comes!\u201d\u201cWhere are you? Who is speaking?\u201d Leylin received a shock.\u201cExcuse me! You are stepping on my hand!\u201d The voice travelling from beneath Leylin\u2019s feet, which made him jump in fright.Only then did he realise that his shoes were stepping on a withered palm. Leylin hurriedly jumped away, \u201cSorry, Sir!\u201d\u201cNo worries, but could you move your feet? They are stepping on my right leg now!\u201dLeylin then realised that the ground inside the tent was uneven and there were many dried bones littered about, and earlier he had unsuspectingly stepped on some.As Leylin moved backwards, the few dried bones of hands and legs began to assemble into a skeletal figure.Taking a closer look, there was a faint layer of skin on top of this skeleton which had covered the bones and on the skull where the eyes were, two green light flickered faintly, which was extremely terrifying.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Sir!\u201d Leylin gulped and hurriedly apologised.\u201cNo matter!\u201d The white bony teeth clacked and produced a human voice: \u201cLet me introduce myself, I am a professor of the Shadow and Dark Elements. You can call me Dorotte!\u201d\u201cMy most respected Sir Dorotte, hello!\u201d Leylin bowed once again.\u201cYou coming here, does that mean you wish to enter the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy?\u201d The bony white Dorotte conjured a black robe from nowhere and concealed its body within it, which soothed Leylin\u2019s nerves a little.\u201cBefore that, I wish to see the rules set by the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Dorotte took out a dusty sheet of sheepskin paper from behind and handed it over to Leylin.According to the ancient agreement, after choosing our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, you are receive the right to partake in the basic lessons of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, a set of elementary meditation techniques, 5 years of residence, lodging, and food free of charge. We also allow you to use Magic Crystals as remuneration, to exchange for knowledge from the professors\u2026\u2026\u201dDorotte spoke nonstop while Leylin read rapidly and compared with the information constantly presented by the A.I Chip.He discovered that what Dorotte said was the exact same as the information on the sheepskin paper. In terms of basic hospitality, it was pretty similar amongst the various academies.The feedback from the A.I Chip also indicated that although it could not successfully scan the person in front of him, Dorotte had unintentionally released a fluctuating radiation which implied that Dorotte\u2019s strength was above the 3 white robes of the travelling party, and this startled Leylin.\u201cI have understood the basic terms now, may I know what kind of payment is needed to enter the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy?\u201d\u201cThirteen Magic Crystals or an item identical in value!\u201d Dorotte said.\u201cI will use this item to exchange!\u201d Leylin made up his mind, and withdrew the magus ring hung around his neck.\u201cYou seem to have an interesting toy!\u201d The green flame in Dorotte\u2019s eyes flashed.The bony white hand took the ring and placed it in its palm, and then took out an item similar to a magnifying glass and inspected it.\u201cMn\u2026\u2026It is indeed rather interesting, I haven\u2019t seen these patterns in a long time!\u201d\u201cA low grade Magic Artifact! It looks like it was created in our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy and there is a carved inscription of a Hastening Spell Formation, but it is broken. It\u2019s worth fifteen Magic Crystals!\u201d\u201cNow! Newbie, are you willing to mortgage this ring for your school fees? Once you have decided, sign the ancient contract of our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d Dorotte said, with an accentuated tone.\u201cI accept!\u201d Leylin\u2019s resolute voice sounded.\u201cGood! I hereby declare that the contract is formed!\u201d Dorotte said, \u201cHand over your form to me!\u201dAfter receiving Leylin\u2019s form, Dorotte laughed, \u201cShadow and Dark Element affinity, no wonder you chose our academy. In this Death Beach, we are the most outstanding!\u201d\u201cSince you forked out a greater amount than the fees required, I hereby announce that you have been accepted and won\u2019t need an entry test! Take this card! Go back and rest. Tomorrow we will proceed with our journey back to the school!\u201dDorotte took out something that resembled a metal card. Leylin received it and saw that a number \u20189\u2019 was written on it.\u201cIt is over just like this? Don\u2019t we have to sign a contract or something?\u201d Leylin asked casually.\u201cHa ha ha\u2026\u2026Never once was there someone who dared to deceive a magus!\u201d Dorotte sniggered, and it gave Leylin\u00a0the chills.\u201cThen I will leave first, Sir!\u201d Leylin bowed and walked out of the tent. He went to the area behind the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy tent.Behind the recruitment area of these academies, there were rows of wooden huts erected, and in the middle, youths of both genders were walking in and out of them. They seemed to be there as the temporary residence for acolytes.\u201cHey! Nice to meet you, are you new here?\u201dCreak!The wooden door that was numbered \u20186\u2019 opened, and an acolyte with red hair and blue eyes walked out from it and greeted Leylin.\u201cHi! I am Leylin!\u201d Leylin smiled.\u201cHa ha! I am Beirut. As for my family background it isn\u2019t very important, since it cannot be used on another continent!\u201d Beirut seemed to be very amiable.\u201cCome! Let me introduce you!\u201d Beirut headed towards the various fan shaped huts, \u201cFellows! We have a new companion!\u201dSeveral acolytes streamed out from the wooden doors and gathered together. Leylin counted a total of seven or eight people.\u201cGood afternoon! I am Kaliweir of the Lance Empire, a fourth grade acolyte!\u201d A boy who seemed to have an air of leadership did a self-introduction.\u201cYou seem to be pretty late!\u201d Kaliweir said.\u201cWe met with some troubles along the way, in the Great Plains of Death!\u201d Leylin said ambiguously, not wanting to say much.\u201cThe Great Plains of Death? It is indeed very dangerous!\u201d Kaliweir looked at the acolytes behind him, \u201cLet me introduce them!\u201d\u201cThis is Beirut, whom you have met earlier!\u201d\u201cThis is Hancock, a third grade acolyte!\u201d A largely built Caucasian guy scratched his head in embarrassment, looking simple and honest.\u201cThis is Raynor, a fourth grade acolyte!\u201d He was a small boy with a skinny build, but there was a tinge of pride in his eyes.\u201cThis is Guricha, a second grade acolyte! And over there are Nyssa and Dodoria, both first grade acolytes!\u201d Although Kaliweir had restrained himself, Leylin could still detect signs of disdain in his words.First grade acolyte, second grade acolyte, they could basically only be an acolyte their whole lives so one couldn\u2019t blame him for shunning them.\u201cHow\u2026\u2026How are you!\u201d Guricha forced a smile and greeting. As for Nyssa and Dodolier, they were both little girls, and some baby fat were still on their cheeks. At this point, they glanced downwards.\u201cWho is that?\u201d Leylin pursed his lips.Beside their small circle was a boy dressed in black, his face pale. Standing at the side, he did not seem to fit in with the rest and looked rather arrogant.\u201cHe! He is Jayden! Our genius of this semester, a fifth grade acolyte! Becoming a Magus is only a matter of time! Kaliweir\u2019s expression turned sour, and he seemed to have some bitterness in his words.\u201cWoah\u2026\u2026a fifth grade acolyte. He has a 90 percent chance of becoming a Magus! No wonder he is so arrogant!\u201d Leylin thought, inhaling a breath of cold air, and couldn\u2019t help but to give Jayden a few more glances.\u201cHmph!\u201d As if noticing the crowd looking at him, Jayden silently harrumphed and entered his own wooden hut. This wooden hut obviously had a larger surface area, and the adornments were more exquisite.\u201cAs a fifth grade acolyte, his treatment will be the best Who knows, there might be some professors looking to take him under their wings early!\u201dKaliweir face soured even more.Leylin realised that this group of acolytes was split into a few cliques. The third grade acolytes and fourth grade acolytes were superior to the lower grade acolytes, but rather inferior to Jayden, the fifth grade acolyte.As for the lowest grade acolytes like Guricha, they all stuck together pitifully and formed a clique. And then there was Jayden, who was segregated away from these two groups.\u201cHello everyone! I am Leylin, and my aptitude is\u2026\u2026third grade!\u201d Leylin said.\u201cWelcome!\u201d Kaliweir revealed a smile on his face, while Guricha and the two girls seemed to have their self-esteem lower as they greeted him and returned back into their huts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s right, to acolytes, aptitudes are more important!\u201d Leylin agreed.Although this group of youths was pretty silent during the forming of their cliques, he naturally did the thing that would benefit him the most.Amongst the acolytes, Jayden had the capability to be independent, but Leylin did not have such a good aptitude, so he could only join a group. Also, by comparing, naturally it was the group with Kaliweir\u2019s as the head with a better future.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026Welcome! Welcome! With your participation, our group is now more robust, there will definitely be a day where I will make that person regret!\u201dKaliweir said while clenching his teeth. Afterwards, a few of them arranged to meet after dinner, and they went back to their respective huts.\u201cBeirut, what did you mean earlier when you said it was a different continent?\u201d Leylin looked for the most amiable, Beirut, and asked him as he was concerned about what Beirut had said earlier.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 This, you know! Actually the continent we\u2019re on is rather small. To the outside world, it is known as the Chernobyl Islands!\u201d\u201cIsland??\u201d Leylin gaped. According to his journey in the past half a year, he could almost be certain that this continent was as huge as the Eurasian Continent he was in from the previous world. But it was only an island here?\u201cOh! Sorry! Geography is my weak subject, and it has often made my home tutor shudder in rage!\u201d Leylin explained.Truth be told, the Farlier Family is only a noble family, and its heritage was pretty short. It couldn\u2019t be compared to the nobles of those huge families, so not knowing was not a rare thing.\u201cHa ha!\u201d Hearing Leylin speak, Beirut laughed jovially, \u201cMe too! I have made 5 etiquette tutors leave in rage! In the end, my father offered a monthly salary, but still no one wanted to teach me. This was something my father had specially told me right before I left!\u201d\u201cLet us continue on the previous topic, we are in the Chernobyl Islands, and the outside world has coined another name for it: The Barren Islands!\u201d\u201cBarren?\u201d Leylin was a little skeptical, \u201cThere are still quite a few people here and plenty of kingdoms, could it be that it is referring to the lack of certain resources?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! In the Chernobyl Islands, due to the environment here, or some external factors, the land here is unable to produce any of the materials a Magus needs. Apart from the earnest acolytes and Magi in seclusion, there are absolutely no other traces of Magi here on this continent!\u201d\u201cSo that is the case!\u201d Leylin nodded his head, and although there were myths of Magi back in his homeland, only the founder of the Farlier Family has seen a Magus. From this, one can see the rarity of Magi.\u201cAnd so, we need to go to the other side of the seas before we can truly find a continent! I heard that not only are there various kinds of resources that Magi need, but there are countless traces of secrets, and remnants of experimental labs. On the whole, the continent has various academies and organisations that trade and exchange the information of magic!\u201d\u201cOn that continent, Magi are not a legend! Although they are still uncommon, even a regular human may be able to see one! Only there can we advance in the progress of our acolyte abilities!\u201d Beirut\u2019s eyes gave off obvious signs of yearning.\u201cSo that is the case! What is the name of that continent then?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Beirut shook his head, \u201cThat continent is too huge! There was never a unified name for it. As for us, we\u2019re going to the north of the continent, and it is known as the Narrow Coastal Regions of the North! Just the North Coastal Regions alone is several times bigger than the Chernobyl Islands that we\u2019re on!\u201cSiii!!\u201d Leylin sucked in a breath of cold air.\u201cSo huge???\u201d\u201cThis world is indeed very vast. The higher one stands, the further one can see! This is a phrase from a bard that I like very much.\u201d Beirut concluded.\u201cThank you for your explanation! I think I need some time to digest the information!\u201d Leylin bade his farewells and returned to his own hut.There was a metal plaque on the yellow wooden door where a \u201c9\u201d was written, and it looked to be rather rusty.Pushing the door open, an odour of rot and rust invaded his nose.Leylin uncontrollably sneezed twice.\u201cIt looks like this is just a gathering point, so the accommodations are rather simple!\u201d Besides a bed and chair in the wooden hut, there was practically nothing else.Leylin found a cloth, wiped down the chair, and then sat on it.*** Creak! Creak! *** The wooden chair creaked continuously, which made Leylin worry that it would be crushed into pieces in the next moment.\u201cLucky it is just for a night! In this condition, it would be better to clean up a little first!\u201dLeylin pat the dust off his body and walked out of the wooden hut. He had made plans to meet with George and the others, and since he had already chosen his academy now, he should tell them so that they could properly write to each other in the future.For the batch of acolytes that Leylin was in, they were considered one of the later groups to reach the camp. After Leylin\u2019s batch had chosen their schools, the various tents of the academies seemed to have fewer people visiting them, and it looked to be much quieter.\u201cEnnea Ivory Ring Tower, it\u2019s here!\u201d Leylin walked to the back of the student quarters, and blocked the path of a familiar girl from the same travelling party.\u201cHi Lisa, do you know where George is?\u201d Lisa was a red haired girl who had matured early; one could already see the fine curves on her body.\u201cLey\u2026\u2026 Leylin!\u201d Lisa blushed, as she had a good impression of Leylin, who had helped several acolytes along the journey a number of times.\u201cGeorge is in room 13, I\u2019ll call him for you!\u201d Lisa picked up her skirt, and rapidly ran off.Whiffing the perfume that was lingering in the air, Leylin\u2019s heart trembled.\u201cLeylin!\u201d This lecherous thought was very soon broken by a joyous voice.George had obviously taken a bath and changed his clothes. He had also shaved his mustache, and gave off a very refreshing look.\u201cHave you finished choosing your academy?\u201d George said loudly, as he patted Leylin\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYes I did, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d Leylin replied.\u201cAbyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d George touched his chin, \u201cI heard from my female seniors that it seems to be famous for its Shadow and Dark element magic! I hope you won\u2019t piss in your pants because of a skeleton during the night!\u201d\u201cFemale seniors?\u201d Leylin shook his head, and had even more admiration for George\u2019s abilities for seducing women.\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026Those who are able to participate in the aptitude test are all of nobility, and it just so happens that I met a distant cousin, an elder female cousin!\u201d George laughed smugly, as if having earned something.\u201cAs for the skeletons and whatnot, I think we\u2019ll see them not only at night, but even in broad daylight!\u201d Leylin laughed bitterly, as he had signed an acolyte contract with a skeleton not too long ago.\u201cNo matter what, as long as you know the location it\u2019s fine! Let\u2019s keep in contact in the future!\u201d George said seriously, a big change from his smug expression earlier.\u201cLet\u2019s keep in contact!\u201d Leylin nodded.\u201cOh yeah! Do you know where Bessita went to?\u201d George asked suddenly.\u201cBessita?\u201d Leylin shook his head.After the previous attack of the wolves, the vibrant and beautiful girl had been much more silent, but at least she had endured and safely here arrived.\u201cYeah! I heard from other companions that her aptitude wasn\u2019t that great, only that of a second grade acolyte, so she entered the Wetland Gardens Academy!\u201cI know now! Thanks!\u201d Leylin was not too interested in the affairs of this girl.Although she was the one the previous Leylin really admired, to him, a girl of thirteen or fourteen years of age was only a child! And the previous encounters were just a child\u2019s mischief.\u201cHow is it? Do you feel a little wasteful because you were unable to get her in your hands\u2026\u2026?\u201d George once again changed back to having a lewd expression.\u201cScram\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter another one to two hours, the sky had already darkened. Leylin was in the camp of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, and enjoyed the dinner provided by the academy with the other acolytes.This time the dinner was extremely sumptuous, and because they were leaving tomorrow, they were generous with the portions.Various fruit juices and wine, fragrant barbecue chicken, fish sauce, truffles, fruits, and salads had all satisfied the belly of Leylin who had not eaten much ever since he appeared in the grasslands.The acolytes were eating and drinking within several groups, and Leylin\u2019s eyes looked towards the corner and found Professor Dorotte and Jayden standing at a corner. Jayden also spoke a few words to him occasionally.\u201cHaving a fifth grade acolyte in this semester, we are really lucky!\u201dBeirut tore a huge strip of chicken thigh off the barbecue, and gave it a huge bite.\u201cEver since Jayden arrived, Professor Dorotte and him have spoken on a few occasions, I wonder what they are talking about?\u201d\u201cFor acolytes, the aptitude will greatly determine the progress of a Magus. What Professor Dorotte is doing is rather normal. Beirut, eat your barbecue chicken!\u201dKaliweir\u2019s voice turned cold, and only after seeing Beirut drink the fruit juice and lowering his head did he turn his gaze back on the barbeque.\u201cAlthough the aptitude is important for a Magus, it isn\u2019t everything. Only the accumulation and comprehension of information is the true motivator and key to the rise of the Magi\u2019s powers!\u201dA third grade acolyte added.Although it was the truth, the atmosphere in the group darkened as the saw Jayden and the professor chatting away. The group silently ate their delicacies, seemingly having lost their appetites.\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026 Guricha, hurry, what happened, what happened next?\u201dOn the other side, the lower aptitude acolytes sat in a circle with Guricha was in the middle, narrating a risky adventure.He had eloquence, and was humorous in his speech. Nyssa and Dodoria held their tummies and laughed coquettishly, as if they were two happy skylarks.Compared to them, this side was pretty silent.The group looked at each other and craned their necks, listening intently. However, only Kaliweir retained his prideful expression.Seeing that even the fourth grade acolyte Raynor could not bear to go over and listen and seemed afraid of losing face, Leylin laughed silently.\u201cAfter all they are just a bunch of kids!\u201dAfter dinner time was over, the group bade their goodbyes and went back to their respective huts.After today\u2019s simple cleaning, Leylin\u2019s hut was barely accommodative. At least there was not as much dust as before.Leylin lay on his bed without removing his clothes, and he stared blankly at the ceiling as if he was lost in thought.\u201cI finally entered an academy! It is also time for the cultivation of Magi to open its doors for me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A hint of sunlight shone through the window, landing on Leylin\u2019s shoes.\u201cIt\u2019s already morning?\u201d Leylin got up, hastily washed up, and went outside.\u201cGood morning!\u201d\u201cGood morning! Leylin!\u201d Beirut had two dark circles around his eyes and kept yawning.\u201cThe conditions here are the worst! There are actually fleas and fungi on my blanket, my god! I cannot remain here for a moment longer!\u201d Voices of complaint sounded from time to time.These acolytes were all of noble birth and their daily accommodations had not been lacking, so naturally they were suffering now.Today, everyone was lacking sleep and had dark circles around their eyes.Although Leylin could not sleep at the start, he had managed to fall asleep later in the night. Right now his vigor was greater than the others, and he still had an inclination to walk around.The whole campground seemed to be bustling with activity. There were many who were taking down the tents, and the floors were littered with rubbish.As Leylin silently walked around, many thoughts crossed his mind. \u201cEvery year at this time, there will be batches of acolytes risking their lives to come here and walk on the path of a Magus. And right now, this is just my starting point!\u201d\u201cGather around! Gather around! Everyone gather according to your academy, and the respective professors will take charge! Do not wander off!\u201d A white bearded geezer shouted in the centre of the campgrounds.His voice, however, was extremely piercing to the ears, as he used some kind of magic to make it resound throughout the camp.\u201cThis has a much higher pitch than a trumpet from the previous world!\u201d Leylin rubbed his ears, which felt like they had been trampled on, and hurriedly went towards the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy gathering area.\u201cHey! Leylin, you\u2019re back? Kaliweir was looking for you earlier.\u201d Beirut greeted him.During his short time here, Leylin had only managed to match the various faces with their names, but he had the best relationship with Beirut.\u201cMy apologies! I strayed a little far and had forgotten to keep track of time! Did Kaliweir need something?\u201dLeylin revealed an apologetic expression.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing! Dorotte asked him to make a head count, so you\u2019ll just have to tell him later. Right now he is being smug about it!\u201d Beirut shook his head.\u201cAlright! How are we going to leave, by ship?\u201d Leylin looked over at the distant blue seas with boundless horizons, but there were no traces of any ships.\u201cNot only there are no ships, from a geographical point of view, we are not in a suitable location for a port.\u201d Leylin was filled with suspicion.\u201cI guess so? However, it might take another half a year to get to another continent!\u201d Beirut scratched his head.\u201cTransportation in the ancient times is a little too behind in technology, needing around 1 year just to travel to school. Time cannot be wasted just like that; it needs to be used efficiently!\u201dLeylin touched the 3 Magic Crystals that he had snatched from Ourin, which were in a leather pouch hung around his waist, seemingly deep in thoughts.\u201cTaking a boat? What naive thinking!\u201d A frosty voice travelled over, bringing ridicule along with it.\u201cJayden?\u201d Leylin looked at the approaching black robed student.\u201cWe are close to the Death Seas; any random fish in it is able to kill a Knight! Not to mention enormous beasts, and even ancient creatures, they all loathe the ships of humans and often bring storms and waves to them. So we would just be courting death if we were to take a ship!\u201d\u201cA fish with the ability to kill a Knight?\u201d Leylin widened his eyes. Right now he was still a preparatory Knight, and if what Jayden said was true, he would die if he were to fall into the sea?Leylin delved into his subconsciousness and retrieved his body statistics.[Leylin Farlier. Strength: 1.9, Agility: 1.9, Vitality: 1.9 Status: Healthy ]In the Great Plains of Death, Leylin had analysed the wolves\u2019 flesh and had also belatedly discovered that their eyeballs contained a special component that complemented the Knights\u2019 breathing techniques, so he had collected many of those eyeballs.And with the contribution from these direwolves, Leylin had now reached the limits of a preparatory Knight.According the analysis of the A.I Chip, when the stats have all reached 2, they have twice the strength of an average adult and is also at the bottleneck of a Preparatory Knight. Only by igniting their internal life energy can they get over this bottleneck.Clenching his fist tightly, a strong force was controlled within his palms.\u201cRight now, if I were to hold a cross blade, I have the confidence to fend off against a squad of common soldiers! But even a Knight whose strength is above mine cannot defeat a mere fish in the Death Seas?\u201dLeylin was a little skeptical of it, \u201cIt could be that Jayden has exaggerated things, but the Death Seas containing dangers that even apply to Magi is a fact!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip! Is is possible to scan the seas nearby?\u201d[Beep! The radiation surrounding the host body is excessive! Unable to scan due to interference of an unknown force field!] The A.I Chip replied.\u201cRadiation? Unknown force field?\u201d Leylin looked at Dorotte, who wasn\u2019t too far away, and had some understanding.\u201cIn this continent, the Magi population is scarce and there isn\u2019t much interference from radiation, so the A.I Chip is able to scan up to a 20 li radius. But acolytes and Migi professors are present in this camp, which is why the interference is too strong, and hence the A.I Chip has limitations with its scanning abilities!\u201d\u201cRight now, what is the furthest distance you can scan?\u201d Leylin\u2019s face darkened.[Beep! Precise scanning range: Within 300 metres radius from the host\u2019s body! Vague scanning range: Within 1000 metres!] The A.I Chip replied duly.\u201cHu\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin exhaled loudly, \u201cNot too bad! This distance is enough to warn me of dangers! However, after reaching the other continent and the academy, this scanning range will most likely shorten once again!\u201d[To increase scanning range, please raise the level of the A.I Chip!] A message was sent from the A.I Chip.\u201cI can still level up the A.I Chip?\u201d Leylin was ecstatic.\u201cRaise level!\u201d[Beep! The energy required is lacking, please replenish!] The robotic voice sounded, and brought Leylin down from Heaven into Hell.\u201cDamn!\u201d The A.I Chip has already disappeared from my original body so how can I retrieve it to replenish energy? Then again, even if I managed to, where am I going to find energy?\u201dLeylin held his head, and recovered after a while.\u201cForget it, since its level is able to rise, I can just find a way in the future. As for now, its current functions are enough for me!\u201d\u201cWhat did Jayden say to you guys earlier?\u201d A voice sounded, and brought the absent-minded Leylin back to reality.When Leylin recovered, he discovered that Jayden had left without him knowing, and Kaliweir was now beside him.\u201cHim? He just spoke about setting off! I reckon he was bored, after all, not speaking to anyone all day is rather stifling!\u201d Beirut surmised.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true!\u201d Kaliweir nodded his head and then looked at Leylin. \u201cWe\u2019re about to set off, don\u2019t go anywhere now. If you were to board the wrong ship, it would be rather troublesome!\u201d\u201cShip?\u201d Leylin looked at the surface of the sea, and still didn\u2019t see any signs of a ship.\u201cHaha!\u201d Kaliweir laughed loudly, \u201cWho said it had to come from the water.\u201d\u201cLook!\u201dFollowing the direction that Kaliweir pointed to, Leylin and Beirut raised their heads and gaped.On the horizon, 3 massive white ships were slowly floating towards them.As the ship approached, a massive shadow covered the whole camp, and it seemed as though darkness had descended upon the earth.\u201cOh! Look!\u201d \u201cMy god!\u201d \u201cHow beautiful!\u201dThe other people in the camp had also discovered the abnormalities, and many raised their heads, exclaiming in awe and shock.\u201cHow is it? This is one of the Magus\u2019 mode of transport, a Dirigible! We will be riding these soon!\u201d Kaliweir said rather smugly.[TLN: (Dirigible)\u00a0Type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power]\u201cAll these were just told to him by Professor Dorotte, so what is there to be gloating about?\u201d Jayden reappeared out of nowhere, and said blandly.\u201cDammit!\u201d Kaliweir stamped his feet.The 3 Dirigibles constantly got closer and slowly lowered themselves onto the ground outside the camp, under the various cheers of the masses.\u201cEn! They are rather similar to the blimps from my previous world, and each one has a very large aerostat gasbag on top of it, I wonder if they are filled with hydrogen gas?\u201dLeylin had some experience from his previous world, so he recovered from his astonishment faster than others, and pondered over the construction of the Dirigibles.The pure white Dirigibles landed on the ground, and let out thunderous growling noises.The doors of the Dirigibles then opened, and a few white robed Magi walked out from them. There were also some movements within the camp, a few old geezers also walked out and exchanged words with them.\u201cAlright! Everyone bring all of your belongings and follow me. Don\u2019t wander off on your own!\u201dDorotte had a black cloak on, and the silhouette of his body was concealed within it. He began to gather the students.The acolytes of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy all scrambled and ran back to their little wooden huts to fetch their belongings.Leylin brought very few things with him. His belongings only consisted of a water sack, a leather bag, a cross blade hung from his waist, and a crossbow slung over his back.The acolytes fervently left the campgrounds under the guidance of the professors of their respective academies, and they gathered into individual groups based on their academy.\u201cAlright! Listen to me! Pay attention to the names mentioned next! Ennea Ivory Ring Tower, Wetland Gardens Academy\u2026\u2026 All of you will board the Dirigible on the right, numbered \u2018332\u2019. \u00a0Don\u2019t miss it! Professors please take note of the number, and acolytes, follow your professors!\u201d\u201cAs for Mercifura Academy, Kerita Academy\u2026\u2026Your Dirigible is in the center, numbered \u2018955\u2019.\u201d The voice continued.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut\u2026\u2026 Yours will be the one on the left, number \u2018455\u2019, don\u2019t mix it up now!\u201dAs Leylin finally heard Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, he could not help but to glance at the Dirigible on the left.As he approached it, he realised that the Dirigible was simply too enormous. The aerostat gasbag at the top seemed like a gigantic rugby ball, casting its shadow on the ground.\u201cAcolytes of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, follow me!\u201d Green flames flickered in Dorotte\u2019s eye sockets, and behind him were two figures, which seemed to be his servants or subordinates.Leylin walked in the centre of the group and glanced around.Under his keen observation, he noticed a few familiar faces from his travelling party. They also noticed him and smiled at him in response, also speaking to some fellows beside them. They all had excitement written across their faces.At the far right, George waved vigorously when it was his turn to board the Dirigible, and entered the Dirigible.\u201cFrom today onwards, the acolytes will all go their separate ways!\u201dA hint of sadness surfaced in Leylin\u2019s heart, but it was suppressed very quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Leylin put more force in his legs, there was a sturdy reverberation coming from the floor beneath his shoes, as if he was stepping on a limestone floor.\u201cWhat a strange material! It looks like wood but it\u2019s sturdier, is it some kind of alloy?\u201dLeylin looked at the greyish, patterned floor and couldn\u2019t help but think about it.\u201cWe\u2019re here! This section of the corridor, from number \u201813\u2019 to \u201832\u2019, is the area designated for our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, you all can allocate on the rooms on your own. Remember, my number is \u201814\u2019. Look for me if you need something!\u201dAfter he finished talking, Dorotte turned, and his black cloak fluttered as he entered his room with the two servants.\u201cAlright! Now let me designate the rooms!\u201d Kaliweir stood out and said.\u201cHng!\u201d Jayden harrumphed and casually picked a room, number \u201818\u2019, and walked inside.Kaliweir\u2019s face turned red, and then white. He clenched his fist several times, only to put it down. \u201cGood! Jayden chose room 18. Next, Beirut, you will be in room 15, Raynor you\u2019re in room 16\u2026\u2026\u201dJayden left, and the remaining acolytes, Beirut, Raynor, and Leylin, were in the same clique as Kaliweir. As for Guricha and his group, they did not dare to object at all.Leylin was allocated room 20. He didn\u2019t say anything, and hurried into his cabin.The room was rather small; it was just a partition. There was enough space for a bed, but hardly any room to stand at all.This reminded Leylin of the beds on the trains in his previous world, which were also as cramped, with barely enough room to stretch his limbs.\u201cHaving a bed is considered good; I was just sleeping in my seat when travelling in the Great Plains of Death!\u201d Leylin comforted himself.\u201cLadies and Gentlemen! Welcome to the Dirigible, I am your captain \u2013 Kirkwul Kroft Leebar, I wish you all a pleasant journey ahead!\u201d\u201cThere are a few announcements of note. Apart from the Professors, the rest are not allowed to walk on the decks unless you wish to go flying down from the skies!\u2026\u2026The cafeteria is in Hall 1, and Hall 2 is where the washrooms are. As for Hall 3, it\u2019s a lounge; everyone is welcome to go there!\u201dA low pitched male voice rang throughout the room. Leylin looked around and noticed the sound was coming from a yellow bronze pipe, but did not know if it was an air duct or megaphone.\u201cWe\u2019re taking off!\u201d Leylin felt weightless for a moment, and the ship swayed. He hurriedly scrambled towards a window.This window was only the size of a soccer ball and was very thick, so it was hard to see what was outside.Following the Dirigible\u2019s ascent, the ground became smaller and smaller, and gradually, the camp in Leylin\u2019s view turned into a black dot.Leylin placed his cross blade and crossbow aside, and laid on the bed.\u201cI heard Professor Dorotte say that the journey will last for roughly a month, what a long period of time! Half a year has already passed since I left my family, but we still have not reached the academy yet!\u201dAbsentmindedly, Leylin shut his eyes.\u201cDing\u2026\u2026Ding Dong\u2026\u2026\u201dA melodious note rang, waking Leylin from his sleep. Leylin climbed out of bed and looked outside the window, and was greeted by darkness.\u201cIt is already evening!\u201d\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, good evening!\u201d Right now, the cafeteria is providing dinner. Today\u2019s menu is: Foie gras with truffles roast chicken, white bread, squirrel meat\u2026\u2026\u201dThis time, the pleasant voice was that of a female\u2019s.Leylin rubbed his stomach and hurriedly stood up. He straightened his clothes and ran towards the cafeteria.The corridor was rather dim and there was a small lamp every few steps, which produced a yellowish glow.The surrounding wooden cabin doors opened, and acolytes came streaming out from them.Right now, Hall 1 was already packed with acolytes but Leylin did not see any of the professors there. He wondered if there was a special room for them.On the ceiling of the hall was a very large white coloured rock, which emanated a bright white light, just like a miniature sun.The cafeteria was filled with long tables and white chairs, and it looked a little like a university canteen.\u201cHey! Leylin, here!\u201d In a corner, Beirut beckoned to him, sitting with a few other acolytes from the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Leylin collected a silver coloured tray and cutlery, and after deliberating, he picked up a slice of white bread, a fried chicken drumstick, fruit salad, and a bottle of apple cider, and sat beside Beirut.\u201cYou guys sure are early!\u201d Leylin greeted them.\u201cIt\u2019s you who\u2019s late, could it be that you overslept?\u201d Beirut said teasingly.Leylin sat down, and gulped down half a bottle of apple cider, \u201cYeah, I did oversleep a little!\u201dLooking around the surroundings again, \u201cAre we also travelling with these acolytes?\u201dAt this moment, besides the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes, the hall was also filled with acolytes from other academies. These boys and girls sat together according to their respective academies and seemed distant towards one another.\u201cThat\u2019s right; we are on the same Dirigible with Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut, and a few other academies! As for Ennea Ivory Ring Tower, they are headed in a completely different direction from us, so we could only go our separate ways!\u201d Raynor explained.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this!\u201d Leylin said with a tinge of regret. \u201cGeorge and the others have all boarded the Dirigible on the right, and it looks like the distance from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is rather far. I think there\u2019ll be some problem with communication next time!\u201dAfter eating dinner, the masses returned to their own rooms to rest.Every day, apart from eating meals and sleeping, there did not seem to be anything else to do. This boredom lasted a whole fifteen days.One evening, the groups did not wish to go back into that tiny cabin room after eating dinner, so they sat around the table and started to chat.\u201cBeirut, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Leylin looked at Beirut, who seemed to be in slight discomfort, and asked.In these ten days, Beirut, who was the reincarnation of a chatterbox, had spoken of topics ranging from his family tree, to how a dish in the capital was created, as if he was speaking fondly to a lover.Leylin and the rest had already adapted, from being annoyed at his words to getting used to them, and now it was the only joy on this boring journey.\u201cYeah! I still want to listen to your past relationships!\u201d Raynor began to jeer.\u201cI have finished saying everything!\u201d Beirut rolled his eyes, \u201cI cannot think of what to talk about anymore!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so bored!\u201d Beirut lamented.\u201cEndure it; it\u2019s only another half a month away! It was quite a distance from your home to the campground, so how did you spend your time all that while?\u201d Leylin encouraged him, albeit a little curious.\u201cMy house is located in the Porter Kingdom, which is on the edge of the Great Plains of Death. So we reached the campgrounds after walking for half a month!\u201d Beirut said helplessly, as he rolled his eyes again.\u201cNo wonder!\u201d Leylin shook his head.\u201cJayden, this is something that I saw first, what do you want?\u201d A silver tray clattered on the floor, letting out a crisp noise.Leylin turned around and saw Kaliweir growling, his hair slightly standing up like a furious lion.On the other side, Jayden poked a golden barbecued chicken drumstick with his fork, \u201cIt belongs to whoever takes it first!\u201dNot only did the crowd not stop them, but they all appeared to be waiting to see a good showOn this tiresome journey, Kaliweir and Jayden felt that the other party was unpleasant to their eyes, especially when Jayden tried to take in two henchmen.They had restrained themselves in the earlier conflicts due to fear, as the Magi were around. However, things seemed to be out of control now.Leylin furrowed his brows.\u201cIt\u2019s you who forced me to do this!\u201d Kaliweir roared, and the muscles in his body tensed. It seemed like he had added a layer of muscle on his body.As a noble, he had naturally trained with the techniques of a Knight. Also, he seemed to have already ignited his internal life energy, thus becoming a proper Knight.[A.I Chip! Scan target!][Beep! Kaliweir, Strength: 2.5, Agility: 2.7, Vitality: 3.0, Status: Currently using a secret technique][Examination of the Secret Technique: After circulating, Strength increases, Agility increases!]\u201cToday, I will let you know that you must lower your head in obedience before a prideful lion!\u201d Kaliweir shouted, and moved his legs. An afterimage remained, as he dashed towards Jayden.[Alert! Alert! Radiation detected! Status: Recommend distancing from source!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded in Leylin\u2019s ears.\u201cRadiation source? Could it be that a Magus has taken action?\u201cHaha! I will let you know today, who exactly is the number one amongst the freshmen!\u201d Jayden laughed loudly, and took out a green badge from within his chest pocket.\u201cPilis-Duwasha! Creature of the green! Hear my calls of summoning, and come out to the mortal world!\u201d Jayden chanted in a strange voice.What he used was a very rare language, but surprisingly, Leylin had actually understood every word of it.With the incantation, a layer of light emerged from the green badge and a few brownish vines appeared from the ground and elongated, like a confused snake that was dancing wildly.* Chi Chi !!*The vines danced as they protected Jayden from the front, and as one vine was sent forward, it tripped Kaliweir down to the ground.The layers of vines continued to coil around him, and Kaliweir was soon wrapped in it completely, with only his face exposed.\u201cMagic Artifact!\u201d The surrounding acolytes cried in surprise.\u201cTo be able to use a Magic Artifact, one must at least be a Level 1 Acolyte! He\u2026\u2026He has already been promoted to a Level 1 Acolyte?\u201dThe crowd clamoured, and they looked at Jayden with gazes of respect. This only caused Kaliweir\u2019s face to redden even further.\u201cHow is this? As long as you swear to obey me, I will release you!\u201d Jayden walked to where Kaliweir was.\u201cNe\u2026\u2026Never! The pride of Golden Lion Family will never be dishonoured by my hands!\u201d Kaliweir veins popped, as if they were going to bleed anytime.\u201cIf it\u2019s like this, then I have no choice!\u201d Jayden shrugged his shoulders and the vines continued to tighten, and few cracking noises even came from within. It seemed like a few of Kaliweir\u2019s bones had been broken.The surrounding acolytes could not watch on any longer and were about to persuade Jayden.Bang !!! The Dirigible swayed, and the light dimmed.A few of the acolytes fell onto the floor, \u201cWhat happened? Did we meet with some intense turbulence?\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed.\u201cHu!\u201d \u201cHu!\u201dThe windows cracked open, and violent gusts of wind came rushing in.Accompanied by the sound of the wind, there were also countless blue electric currents scattering in all directions.Looking at these, Leylin pupils shrank to the size of a needle, \u201cThunderstorm? Where are the Magi on the Dirigible?\u201d\u201cYou insignificant vermins, you actually dare to trespass the domain of the mighty Pendra!!\u201dA voice reverberated, accompanied by a violent thunderstorm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All cracks in the Dirigible flashed with a green light as vines climbed up and firmly blocked any openings.\u201cHu hu\u2026\u2026 \u201cLeylin\u2019s face turned red as he panted heavily.When the Giant Storm Sprite spoke earlier, the acolytes had all felt an ice-cold force pressing down on them.Immense, boundless, and raw malice!!! Leylin found it difficult to breathe.Fortunately, after the Defense Spell Formation was activated, Leylin felt much better as the pressure lifted.Otherwise, most of the acolytes in the hall might just die from suffocation moments later.\u201cHuman beings, you must pay the price for your folly!\u201d the Giant Storm Sprite howled.As the sound waves travelled through the Defense Spell Formation, the milky white light vibrated.\u201cMighty being of nature! Please appease your fury! We have a letter here!\u201d A familiar voice rang beside Leylin\u2019s ears, it was the Dirigible captain.\u201cThis is the letter of agreement that we had with His Majesty, the Storm King Sprite, which grants us passage through this area!\u201d Kirkwul said with a voice full of confidence.\u201cLetter of agreement?\u201d The Giant Storm Sprite\u2019s voice contained suspicion, which he followed up with a furious roar, \u201cPendra is free! The agreement does not bind me to it!!\u201d\u201cKeep roaring! Rage on! Damikan Buthra!\u201d With the incantation spoken, the thunderstorm outside became ten times more violent than before.\u201cDamn!!! It is actually a wanderer, I have hit the jackpot!!!\u201d Kirkwul\u2019s voice sounded once again, but it did not carry the usual confidence and was infused with exasperation instead.\u201cEveryone attack together!!!\u201d* Rumble!!! *Many bright coloured lights flashed continuously outside the window, clashing with the lightning.The Dirigible gradually started to sway.Leylin\u2019s face turned slightly pale. He could only pray for the Magi to use their might and chase that darn Giant Storm Sprite away, otherwise he would not even be able to escape since he was stuck high up in the sky.\u201cBang!!!\u201dThere was another rumble, and the Dirigible recovered its stability.\u201cHas it left?\u201d\u201cIt is only a Giant Storm Sprite that has just matured, it is only comparable to half of an elemental Magus at most. There are nine of us here, so it running away is natural!The voices of the Magi discussions sounded from outside. It obviously did not take a lot of effort for them, which eased the minds of the acolytes.As expected, when the acolytes heard those words, they all shouted and cheered loudly.\u201cWoo! To our great Magi!\u201d\u201cDamn it! I thought I would fall and be smashed into minced meat!\u201d\u201cHaha! Look at that coward; he actually peed in his pants!\u201d The acolytes all mocked an unlucky acolyte, and vented the fear that they had held in their hearts.Leylin\u2019s eyes scanned the surroundings.When the Giant Storm Sprite spoke earlier, Jayden had already released the vines binding Kaliweir, and right now it seemed like Kaliweir had escaped. However, although Jayden\u2019s face was rather pale, he stood his ground and maintained the pose of a victor.\u201cThe A.I Chip did not detect that Jayden was carrying a Magic Artifact earlier. It seems like it was only acquired recently, and the only means of that is through Dorotte!!!\u201d\u201cIt seems like after obtaining the Magic Artifact, Jayden has been leading Kaliweir into picking a fight with him impatiently. If not for this incident, it is very likely that he would have succeeded!\u201d Leylin thought to himself.Because of the interruption from the Giant Storm Sprite, the fight between Jayden and Kaliweir remained unsettled as it drew its curtains.From then on, Kaliweir tried his best to avoid appearing in the same place as Jayden. It seemed like he was afraid of his opponent\u2019s Magic Artifact.This fight had greatly influenced Leylin\u2019s thoughts.\u201cKaliweir has already ignited his internal life energy, and got through the bottleneck and became a full fledged Knight. However, in front of an acolyte with a Magic Artifact, he is still as weak as a lamb! It seems like the strength of Magi greatly surpass that of Knights!\u201cOriginally, I thought I must ignite my internal life energy. But after this, if I haven\u2019t ignited it before reaching the school, then I\u2019ll give up on it! I definitely have to pour all my attention and energy into my studies to become a Magus!\u201d Leylin made up his mind.The time slowly passed, and the Dirigible finally reached another continent.In addition to the incident with the Giant Storm Sprite, the Dirigible had several encounters with other flying creatures. This led Leylin to realise that not only was the Death Seas difficult to navigate through, it was the same in the skies.Fortunately, Kirkwul\u2019s letter of agreement was still rather effective in front of the various large creatures and no conflicts were started.During this period, the Dirigible alighted several times and sent several Professors and acolytes off. The Dirigible slowly became more vacant.Another dozen days passed unknowingly.* Bang!! * The Dirigible landed and the whole interior shuddered.\u201cWe have arrived at the Abyssal Bone Moor! Attention to all acolytes of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy! Please bring your belongings and leave the Dirigible in an orderly fashion!\u201d A voice rang through the cabins.\u201cWe\u2019ve finally arrived?\u201d Leylin packed his belongings and quickly left the tiny space he had been holed up in during the past month.\u201cJayden, Kaliweir, please take attendance!\u201d Dorotte held a black staff, with a large green jewel embedded in its tip.\u201cAlright!\u201d Jayden and Kaliweir nodded their heads and started accounting for the attendance.Leylin glanced at Kaliweir. Ever since the incident in the dining hall, this youth had turned much quieter and often holed himself in his own room. Looking at his face now, he seemed be gloomier than before.On the contrary, Jayden was extremely lively, and according to some rumours, he had already been accepted by Dorotte as an apprentice.Apprentices were different from other acolytes as their status were higher, and they could even freely obtain a lot of advanced knowledge from their professor.A dozen or so people walked out of the Dirigible.\u201cSo this is our academy? It seems to be a little desolate!\u201dLeylin looked at the surroundings, and it seemed rather desolate. There were a few small trails with obvious traces of others using it before.There was a wooden sign in the middle of a crossroad, riddled with several holes.There were directions written in black, showing the various locations.\u201cThe land of shadows and death \u2013 Bone Abyssal Moor!\u201d The words twisted, and Leylin felt his scalp gone numb.\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026 Follow me!\u201d Dorotte stretched his body leisurely, and his white bones creaked and crunched, as if they were going to fall apart at any moment.\u201cPay heed! Although our academy\u2019s acolytes do a scheduled cleansing, there are still some living creatures, and polluted and evil beings roaming in this area. So if you were to stray off, I think we would be able to pay respects to your deceased body soon afterwards!\u201dDorotte snickered, and the acolytes\u2019 faces all changed. They followed behind Dorotte closely, for fear of losing him.The group gradually traversed across the Abyssal Bone Moor.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Leylin walked in the middle of the group, and suddenly something black flashed in front of him. It seemed to be a blue creature with a horn.\u201cA.I Chip! Begin scan!\u201d\u201cTask initialising, Begin Scan!\u201d The A.I Chip chip\u2019s robotic voice sounded.[An unknown creature of high energy! Estimated Strength: 3-4, Agility: 4-5, Vitality: About 5, Assessment: Extremely dangerous!]\u201cSs! Whatever it is, it\u2019s much stronger than the direwolves and may have some strange tricks up its sleeves. A Knight would only die if they encounter one!\u201dLeylin hurriedly squeezed forward. In this land where danger lurked, it seemed like the black robed skeleton, Professor Dorotte, was his only insurance.\u201cIt seems like our little acolytes have finally understood the dangers!\u201dThe green flames in Dorotte\u2019s sockets flickered as he said indifferently.The group proceeded forward, and very soon the barren earth lessened and more forestry could be seen around them.Very soon, Leylin entered a black coloured forest.He did not know if it was an illusion, but Leylin felt as if the sun in the sky had dimmed after entering the forest, and there was a layer of white mist in the surroundings giving off a chilly feeling.[Warning! Warning! A high energy being is approaching! Position: In the air!] The A.I Chip\u2019s warning sounded.Leylin hurriedly looked down and crouched.\u201cKak!\u201d A piercing sound rang.A black raven with red eyes swooped down and passed by Leylin\u2019s position, its sharp claws headed towards the face of a female acolyte.Boom!!!A ball of greenish liquid struck at the raven directly, and the raven cawed as it fell onto the floor. A white smoke arose, giving off a corroding effect.The female acolyte remained rooted to the ground and suddenly cried loudly.Only seconds later, the raven on the floor disappeared without a corpse and there was only a huge impression left in the corroded earth.\u201cIt seems like these Red-Eyed Ravens increased in numbers yet again. I think I will need to distribute more missions after we return, and let the acolytes cleanse this area!\u201d\u201cWhat are you all looking at? Let\u2019s go!\u201dDorotte\u2019s voice sounded at the front and the crying female acolyte rubbed her eyes and gritted her teeth as she walked forward.Leylin was startled, and hurriedly followed.After another hour of journeying, the group arrived in the centre of the Abyssal Bone Forest.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin saw a spacious area in front of him.And what was projected before their eyes, was a large graveyard.In the hearths of the Abyssal Bone Forest, a large graveyard sat there unknowingly.This graveyard was extremely huge and was marbled in black and white, seeming luxurious.Only, it seemed to have been forsaken for some time. Many of the graves had weeds growing on them, and some even had vines. Occasionally, the ravens caw on top of them, giving off a terrifying vibe.\u201cWelcome to your home of shadow and death \u2013 Abyssal Bone Forest!\u201d Dorotte snickered, but no matter how Leylin saw it, Dorotte seemed to be taking joy in their unfortunate plight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is the situation now?\u201d[Beep! Task Establishing! Acquiring sample of the environment, analysis in progress!][There is a significant increase in a type of energy particle here which faintly resonates with the Host\u2019s consciousness. They are conjectured to be Shadow and Dark particles!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice travelled over.\u201cNo wonder! There is an increase in the energy particles here, which obviously benefits Shadow and Dark Element Magi. It is like the novels from my previous world, where one must occupy an area that is filled with spirit energy when they practice the cultivation techniques of immortals!\u201dLeylin gained a slight understanding of the academy\u2019s choices.\u201cPassword!\u201dAt this moment, Dorotte had already brought the group to the centermost area in the graveyard, where there was a huge grave. Black marble stones were piled up one by one, making it resemble a huge black castle.Beside the marbled door, there were two stone statues.On the left, there was a two-headed dog with spikes growing on its body.On the right, there was an earthworm with a pair of wings and razor sharp fangs protruding out, exuding a cruel aura.These two statues were lifelike. They had black jewels for eyes, and looked as if they were alive.When Dorotte walked in front of the statues, the earthworm on the left side spoke in a parched voice. With each opening and closing of the mouth, dust from the stone continuously fell down onto the floor.\u201cEnough! Jumal, don\u2019t you recognise me?\u201dDorotte had a look of annoyance on his face.Right after Dorotte spoke; the earthworm and huge dog both guffawed. Their voices brought about a huge wind, which flipped the robes of the acolytes behind.\u201cDorotte! Although we are pretty familiar with each other, rules are rules!\u201dBoth of the statues seemed to have come alive. The huge dog licked its paws, and let out a female voice.\u201cOr, would you like to play with us?\u201d The earthworm lifted its claw and made a human-like gesture, beckoning with the claw, \u201cThen come! I feel itchy all over my body!\u201d\u201cAlright! Alright! Let me think!\u201d Dorotte rolled his eyes.\u201cOh! Damnit! I should really take the head of the pig who set up this Defensive Spell Formation and shove it up their ass!\u201dDorotte suddenly bellowed.\u201cHurry and say it! What is the password?\u201d The huge dog roared and there were sparks coming out from its mouth.\u201cThe secret password is \u2013 I hate smelly bones!\u201d Dorotte spoke softly.Leylin\u2019s mouth twisted, and only by using a strong willpower did he manage to suppress his laughter. Although Dorotte wore a skull, Leylin was extremely certain that he was currently sulking.\u201cHaha! The password is correct!\u201d The earthworm and huge dog laughed loudly and let them pass.\u201cI bet the overseer keeping watch with the crystal ball is laughing to death right now!\u201d The huge dog snickered, then returned to his original stone platform and changed into its former statue state.\u201cPuchi!\u201d An acolyte finally found it hard to bear and let out a noise.\u201cHng!\u201d Green flames suddenly ignited within Dorotte\u2019s sockets, \u201cIt seems like we must educate the new acolytes on how to respect their professors!\u201d*Pa!* Dorotte snapped his fingers.\u201cAh!!! What is this, don\u2019t come over here, don\u2019t come over!!!\u201d The acolyte who laughed out loud earlier retreated several steps and fell onto the floor, wailing loudly.\u201cRousey! What is it!\u201d An acolyte beside him walked forward.\u201cNo\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t come over!\u201d Rousey screamed, and his face gradually twisted.Seeing this scene, the nearby acolytes all felt a chill down their spines.\u201cMagi are equal among themselves, so they can afford to play jokes on each other. However, acolytes must always maintain their humility!\u201dSuddenly, Leylin understood the code of conduct in the Magi world. Only with equal strength, did one have the status to speak to another.Jayden and Kaliweir also seemed to be deep in thought.\u201cCarry him up and let us go in!\u201d Dorotte pointed at Rousey, who was still screaming.Both of his servants walked over and carried Rousey, one on each side.\u201cBoth of them are at least Grand Knights!\u201d Seeing how the two servants subdued Rousey so easily, Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed.After opening to door to the grave, they all appeared in front of a stone staircase that spiraled downwards.The flight of stairs was spiralled and descended all the way into the depths of the darkness, until they could not be seen any more.Dorotte used his staff and knocked on the floor. *Dong Dong!!*Blue flames started to light up one by one, illuminating the ground within.\u201cApart from the colour, it\u2019s similar to an ancient castle from the Medieval Times!\u201d Leylin exclaimed, and tread down the stairs of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.Leylin did not know how long exactly he walked for under the illumination of the blue flames, but it was definitely over 20 minutes.\u201cSo huge! The area of this underground building is so much larger than the area of the graveyard on top, and it is not even by several times. It almost resembles an underground kingdom already.\u201dLeylin calculated in silence.\u201cOur Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was constructed in the Gregorian Year 324, and it has been almost one thousand years since then\u2026\u2026 As for our academy founder, it is Merlin Falek Driwilc\u2026\u2026\u201dDorotte led at the forefront, and occasionally gave them a few sentences of explanation.\u201cThe door which you all had entered from earlier is the main door! And besides that, there are still many exits inside the academy. As long as you have become a proper Magus, you can apply and chose an uninhabited, empty grave for your own personal passage!\u201dDorotte explained.But Leylin\u2019s lip never stopped twitching, \u201cThe purpose for us to advance as a Magus is so we can obtain a grave? How delightful!\u201dHowever, ever since the unlucky guy was used as an example earlier, Leylin only dared to rant in his heart and didn\u2019t say it aloud.Our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is divided into several large areas: the dormitories, classrooms, laboratories, gardening areas, trading post, mission area and such. As for their exact locations, someone will bring you for an induction later. For now, all of you must follow me to register at the administration area, and then we\u2019ll commence the selection of your professors!\u201dDorotte came to the front of a slightly larger room, and pointed at the words on the steel door, \u201cThis is the administration area, however, I believe none of you will be willing to come here again in the future!\u201dSeeing the symbols on the door which seemed like both words and patterns at times, Leylin finally acknowledged that none of the characters were anything like what the brat had encountered in the past.[TL Note: The brat refers to the previous host of Leylin\u2019s body.]\u201cOh! I\u2019ve forgotten that you guys don\u2019t know the ancient Byron language!\u201d Dorotte tapped his head, \u201cNo worries! This is one of the basics of incantation, you guys will learn it in the future!\u201d\u201cDorotte, huh? Enter!\u201d An aged voice sounded from within, and the steel doors moved automatically. A steel hand opened the bolts on the door, and even beckoned them in.Leylin followed Dorotte inside, and realised that this room was extremely large. An old man with white beard and red eyebrows was seated at the wide, black office desk. He was scribbling something with a feather pen, and beside him was a stack of parchment.Behind him, there were countless bookshelves of over ten metres tall, and parchment and even crystal balls were disorderly arranged on them. It looked just like a library.\u201cYou\u2019re late!\u201d The old man put down the quill pen in his hand, and his wrinkled face smiled gently.\u201cWe met with some trouble along the way, a wandering Giant Storm Sprite, so the Dirigible was a little damaged, and hence the delay in time!\u201d Dorotte explained.The old man said, \u201cThat\u2019s really unfortunate!\u201dAnd then he looked at the acolytes at the back and his bright eyes shone brilliantly. He scanned through the acolytes, before finally landing on Jayden.\u201cIt seems like you are well rewarded this trip!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Dorotte pointed, \u201cJayden, come over here!\u201dPulling Jayden to his side, \u201cI have made a contract with him already! He is now my personal apprentice! Hurry! Settle the procedures for him!\u201dDorotte took a stack of forms from a heavy black pouch and handed it over to the old man.\u201cMn! Fifth grade acolyte, not too bad!\u201d The old man took out an object resembling a pair of glasses with gold threads around its rim, and hung it on his nose.\u201cDefinitely! Melda, that scum, he actually pushed such a troublesome thing to me, haha! Now I want to see him angry!\u201d Dorotte gloated loudly.\u201cSo then! Jayden! Are you willing to become the personal apprentice of Dorotte?\u201d The old man asked.\u201cI accept!\u201d Jayden looked at Dorotte and agreed in a low voice.\u201cGood!\u201d The old man took a sheet of parchment and wrote something on it, then handed Jayden a black sack too, \u201cThis is yours, hold it well!\u201d\u201cAre the procedures done? I have taught him those meditation techniques, and right now I have to rush back to my experiments! It was difficult enough to find some inspiration along the way, but I did not have any ingredients on hand, do you know how much I was suffering?\u201dDorotte let out a shrill voice and pulled Jayden along, leaving the room quickly.\u201cAlright! Mister Dorotte\u2019s task is completed. What\u2019s next are the things that you guys should be mindful of!\u201d The old man knocked on the desk and drew the attention of the acolytes back to him, and then said in a satisfied manner.\u201cSince all of you have already handed in the fees and achieved the criteria for the contract, you are all acolytes of our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy now. Right now, all of you will begin with the selection of your professors!\u201d\u201cThere are two methods to choose a professor. The first is to chose by placing your name inside the crystal ball and my treasure will pick a professor for you! This method is absolutely free of charge.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? What is your treasure?\u201d An acolyte asked cowardly.\u201cOh?\u201d The old man laughed, and suddenly a black python appeared on the table, \u201cThis is my magical pet! Spotty! It does not recognise any of you, so I think it\u2019s the fairest for it to choose! Any other questions?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026No more!\u201d Seeing the large python, the acolyte quickly retreated backwards.\u201cThere is also another method, which is for the acolytes to choose their own professors. Here with me is a list containing short introductions of various professors and their requirements, all for your choosing. Of course, if you choose this method, you will need a magic crystal as payment!\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which method you chose, but once you have decided on your professor, you can never change again!\u201dThe old man said, \u201cNext up, I will call your names, and you will come forward and tell me your choice!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How should we choose?\u201d Beirut asked worriedly.\u201cPaying is definitely better than not paying! This is common sense!\u201d\u201cYou should still have excess Magic Crystals, don\u2019t you?\u201d Leylin asked puzzledly.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026 I only have 1 Magic Crystal left; my family sacrificed one thousand troops to get merely 2 Magic Crystals!\u201dBeirut was a little reluctant. Leylin was startled too, as he could not help but feel his pockets.\u201cThe value of Magic Crystals is higher than I expected. When I extorted some from Ourin earlier, I really lucked out!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right, the Chernobyl Islands is also known to Magi as the Barren Islands. Magic Crystals are already scarce, so the value of Magic Crystals being much higher here may be due to that!\u201d\u201cA matter like this can only be decided by yourself!\u201d Leylin said to Beirut.\u201cAlright! First up, Raynor!\u201d The old man said.\u201cWhich are you choosing?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t have any Magic Crystals left, can I first buy on credit? I am a fourth grade acolyte!\u201d Raynor blushed.\u201cNot a bad aptitude! A pity however, rules are rules!\u201d The old man shook his head.As he pointed at a crystal ball on the table, Raynor\u2019s name appeared within, along with many other unfamiliar names, flickering as they appeared.When the black python Spotty spat out a letter and dabbed on the crystal ball, the words finally stopped flickering, \u201cRaynor! Your mentor is Gafrin!\u201d\u201cTake this! A set of acolyte robes and an identity badge! A crystal ball which contains an elementary meditation technique! And your room number and keys are there too!\u201dThe old man threw the black sack containing the items to Raynor, and then snapped his fingers. *Bang!!!* A black ball suddenly appeared in the room and floated in midair.\u201cFollow this shadow slave, it will bring you to where your mentor is!\u201dThe old man made a gesture to send him off, and Raynor helplessly followed the black ball out.\u201cNext! Rousey!\u201dThe one, who laughed at Dorotte earlier, Rousey, was called. Although his complexion had recovered a little, there was still cold sweat on his face.\u201cOh! What do I see? A nightmare hex! What a pitiful fellow! You\u2019re going to suffer for the next month!\u201d\u201cCould\u2026\u2026Could you remove this hex?\u201d Rousey\u2019s voice quivered.\u201cDefinitely! One hundred Magic Crystals! No credit allowed!\u201d The old man agreed crisply!Rousey shook his head and took a Magic Crystal from his robes, \u201cI want to choose my own mentor!\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d The old man accepted the Magic Crystal, and handed a compendium, which looked like a dictionary, to Rousey, \u201cThe mentors who are willing to accept apprentices are all there, take your time and pick!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d An hourglass appeared on the table, the sand falling slowly.\u201cI forgot to mention earlier, a Magic Crystal only allows for one turn of the hourglass. If you exceed it, you have to pay another Magic Crystal!\u201d The old man grinned.Rousey swallowed his saliva, and looking at the sand grains falling non-stop, he flipped through the pages in a hurry.\u201cThis hourglass seems as though it lasts only 5 minutes worth of time! It is not even enough to skim through!\u201d Leylin\u2019s pupils shrank.\u201cTime\u2019s up!\u201d In accordance with the voice, the compendium closed automatically and made a loud snapping sound.\u201cHow is it? Have you chosen? Or do you wish to have another look?\u201d The old man asked.\u201cI have decided! I choose Mentor Vivian!\u201d Rousey sucked in a deep breath.\u201cTake your belongings and follow the slave!\u201d The old man threw a black sack, identical to the one from before, to Rousey and summoned another shadow slave.Rousey bowed humbly, and followed the floating slave out the large doors.\u201cNext up, Kaliweir!\u2019The old man continued calling, and Leylin scrutinised the acolytes who went up. Kaliweir seemed well off, as he paid 3 Magic Crystals and looked through the compendium before making a choice.\u201cAs for Beirut, he did not pay the 1 Magic Crystal in the end. His mentor was chosen randomly, and he did not know if the results were good or bad.\u201cNext! Leylin!\u201d The old man called Leylin\u2019s name.Leylin inhaled deeply, and walked to the front.\u201cI\u2019ll choose on my own!\u201d Leylin handed a Magic Crystal to the old man.\u201cYou know the rules!\u201d The old man snapped, the hourglass flipped over, and time started elapsing.The compendium was rather heavy, and the material seemed to be of high quality.Leylin hurriedly flipped through the pages, and continuously skimmed through the information on the parchment.\u201cIt is the language of the Chernobyl Islands. It seems like it has been specially prepared for us acolytes of this area.\u201d\u201cA.I Chip!

By the time the last grain of sand fell, Leylin had managed to flip to the last page.\u201cYour memory isn\u2019t bad, which is useful for your studies in the future! How is it? Who will you choose?\u201d The old man smiled and asked.Leylin closed his eyes, \u201cA.I Chip! How is the collation of data?\u201d[Beep! Data is in order, information on 53 mentors collated. In process of discarding the enticing conditions!]Leylin\u2019s complexion turned bitter, \u201cThe information in the brackets for Mentor Kroft earlier made me rather mindful. It seems like the experiments of Magi are dangerous, and can actually jeopardize the safety of the acolytes!\u201d\u201cKroft is only doing experiments on herbal concoctions, but what of the others, like the shadow and necromancy experiments?\u201d\u201cNo wonder the requirements given are so easy to meet, not needing to give payment for information. It was, in fact, so they could lure students who would cooperate for experimental testing! Although they might not have any adverse effects, it\u2019s all over once they do!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip! Carry out the filtering process, with the conditions: To match with my current circumstances.\u201d[Beep!!!] The blue light flashed, and the light blue screen in front of Leylin flickered. More than half of the mentors\u2019 information was omitted, leaving only a miserable few choices, including Dorotte\u2019s.\u201cMentor Dorotte, Department of Shadow, specialises in anatomy, conversion of energy, and necromancy.\u201dRequirements: Acolytes must give one 1 Magic Crystal each month, and at the same time, cooperate with experiments!\u201d\u201cMentor Kroft, Department of Potioneering, specialises in medicine, herbalism, and neutralisation of energy.\u201dAble to provide information on 1 topic free of charge.Requirements: Acolytes must always help with the cleaning of the experimental lab, preparation and handling of various herbs, and at the same time, assist the Magus in carrying out herbal concoctions (on the basis that they cause no harm to the acolytes!!)\u201d\u201cIt seems like Dorotte\u2019s temper isn\u2019t too bad amongst the mentors. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to fetch the new batch of acolytes.\u201dLeylin thought inwardly, \u201cA pity that my Magic Crystals are not enough, and he has Jayden already. I\u2019m afraid there will not be much attention given to me!\u201d\u201cAlso the Shadow Department mentors all require acolytes to cooperate with their experiments and cannot ensure the safety of acolytes. This is such a fraud!\u201dLeylin helpless omitted the mentors of the Shadow Department.\u201cWhat\u2019s left is only this Alchemy mentor! With the extreme and unique advantages that I have with my A.I Chip, I can definitely make use of alchemy to earn money and buy knowledge related to the Dark element!\u201dTo others, Leylin had merely closed his eyes and made his choice right after opening them.\u201cI choose Mentor Kroft!\u201d\u201cAlchemy?\u201d The old man was a little surprised, \u201cYou wish to become an alchemist? The effort and resources invested are extremely horrifying! Do you want to change? I think Dorotte suits you well!\u201d\u201cThank you sir!\u201d Leylin earnestly bowed, \u201cI have a hobby for alchemy, and have also acquired some knowledge in this field beforehand.\u201d\u201cThe mortal world\u2019s perception of alchemy is totally different from that of the world of Magi!\u201d The old man shook his head. Then, seeing Leylin\u2019s resolute gaze, he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim,\u201cSince you have already decided, so be it!\u201d After speaking, the old man took a quill pen and scribbled on the parchment paper.\u201cHere are your belongings, follow the shadow slave to where Kroft is!\u201dThe old man handed a sack over to Leylin.Leylin bowed deeply and even nodded to the remaining acolytes, before leaving through the large door.The black coloured ball floated in front, and occasionally spun in a circle. Its speed was not too fast, and with Leylin\u2019s body of a peak Preparatory Knight, he easily followed along.From time to time, there were acolytes passing, but they did not look at Leylin in astonishment.Leylin followed the shadow slave and passed through several corridors, two large halls, and a garden. It then stopped in front of an area designed for experiment labs.The shadow slave turned translucent, and immediately passed through the door, leaving Leylin outside.Leylin was speechless, yet he did not dare knock on the door. Therefore he just waited outside patiently.After a moment, there came a middle aged man\u2019s voice.\u201cLeylin, huh? Enter!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Leylin pushed opened the doors of the experimental lab.A sweet and spicy aroma filled the laboratory room, mingling with the odour of poisonous fumes and liquids, which made Leylin furrow his brows.A huge table took up the space of almost half the lab, and placed on it were various test tubes, flasks and beakers, as well as some other apparatus that Leylin could not identify. This made Leylin recall his previous life.In front of the laboratory table, there stood a white haired, middle aged man who wore white robes. His collar was embroidered with golden patterns, and his eyes emitted a golden light, like two golden gems.\u201cI\u2019m Kroft, and I\u2019ve heard the details from the shadow slave. So then, Leylin, are you willing to become my apprentice?\u201d The middle aged man put down the test tube in his hands, and said solemnly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since these are the arrangements made by the school, I\u2019ll accept you as my disciple!\u201d The middle aged man stroked his beard.\u201cAlthough the environment here is quite ordinary, it\u2019s enough to let you undergo the initiation!\u201d Kroft swept his eyes over the examination room. \u201cAt least it\u2019s very quiet here and we won\u2019t be disturbed!\u201d\u201cWhat initiation?\u201d Leylin had some doubts.\u201cThe initiation of a Magus!\u201d Kroft replied.\u201cNow tell me, Leylin, what is a Magus to you?\u201d\u201cA mysterious person with the ability to call forth thunder and storms, manipulate flames and other forces of nature!\u201d Leylin said the definition he knew of in Chernobyl Islands.\u201cEn! However, it\u2019s a little off!\u201d Kroft commented.\u201cA Magus is actually the title we give to people with power in ancient times. These Magi all learn the principles and how to control and manipulate the energy within. They are never ending in their pursuit of knowledge and truth!\u201dKroft explained the definition of Magi to Leylin.\u201cSo it is to say, the title of Magus is actually not limited to only humans!\u201d Leylin had a better understanding now.\u201cIndeed! Other kinds of demi-humans, and even other intelligent beings, have Magi existing among their kind, for example, a Magus of the sea tribes, or even a Dragon Magus!\u201dKroft said, \u201cAlright! Now let us begin the rites! Don\u2019t be afraid, it\u2019s very simple!\u201d*Clap!* The floor around Kroft softened, and transformed into a spell formation of sorts, and a strange energy came spreading from within.The surroundings turned dark, with only the flame lit in the centre of the formation.\u201cRight now, give your hand to me!\u201d Leylin stretched his hand out and a larger palm firmly clasped it.\u201cAbiding by the rites of ancient times, I will now guide you, Leylin Farlier, onto the path of a Magus!\u201d\u201cRecite after me!\u201d\u201cI swear! I will forever be in pursuit of the truth!\u201d Kroft used an unfamiliar language, but Leylin understood it completely, and his mouth could not help but produce the same sounds.\u201cI swear! I will forever be in pursuit of the truth!\u201d As it was a voice of a thirteen or fourteen year old youth, there was still a little immaturity in the voice.\u201cWithout the permission of my mentor, I swear that I will not reveal any of the information my mentor passes on to me\u2026\u2026\u201dKroft continued to recite and Leylin followed suit, the two voices very soon eerily turned into one.In the hearts of the formation, the flame suddenly grew brighter and blazed strongly\u2026\u2026\u201cCongratulations on formally becoming an acolyte!\u201dAfter the rites, Kroft congratulated Leylin.Leylin looked down at both of his hands. After the mysterious rites, it seemed like he saw the world in a different light, yet at the same time, he couldn\u2019t pinpoint the difference.[An anomaly has been discovered in the brainwaves of the Host!!!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cIt seems like there is a change in Spiritual Force, but I don\u2019t have any further information regarding this field, so I can only supplement it in the future!\u201d Leylin said helplessly.\u201cThe meditation technique in the crystal ball has already been given to you, right? Take a look at it when you go back, you can already absorb the information in it now!\u201d\u201cTomorrow, come here at six in the morning!\u201d\u201cYou can leave now, but remember! Don\u2019t wander around!\u201d Kroft warned.\u201cI\u2019ll do as you bid! Mentor!\u201d Leylin bowed, and then walked out of the experimental lab.\u201cLuckily I passed them earlier; otherwise I wouldn\u2019t even know where the dormitories are located!\u201d When he was following the shadow slave earlier, Leylin had already let the A.I Chip start mapping the area. Now, there was a small part that was completed, and he knew the places that he had walked past before.The areas with Magi are rather dangerous, and Leylin did not wish to suffer from any collateral damage from them.After reaching the dorms, Leylin took the key out from the sack issued by the old man.It was a heavy, black copper key, and it was labelled \u2018783\u2019. Right now, it was rather cold and vacant in the dorms. Leylin walked through the empty corridors, and his hair stood on end as he listened to the echo of his footsteps.Following the room numbers, he found his room, \u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201dLeylin placed the key into the keyhole, and the heavy metal produced a click.As the large door opened, the dark room automatically produced a flame, \u201cThey actually use the principles of Magi to invent a similar sound activation system?\u201dLeylin placed his belongings down and inspected the place in which he was going to live for some years.The dormitory was a little small and was divided into three partitions, a bedroom, living room and washroom. They were actually self-contained living quarters, and there was even a new blanket placed on the bed, it looked prim and proper.\u201cThe environment isn\u2019t bad!\u201d Leylin sat on the bed, and took out the things that were given by the academy.\u201cA set of acolyte robes. The A.I Chip has detected that there are several spells casted on it, and the defense is even comparable to some of the leather armour around, great stuff!\u201d Leylin efficiently changed into the robes, and pinned the acolyte badge to his chest.This look was exactly the same as the grey robed acolytes he had seen earlier today.What Leylin did next was to pack his things, and do a cleaning of the room.When he went out, the doors of the dorm beside him opened, and a brown haired acolyte walked out, \u201cHello! Are you a new acolyte? I am Bill!\u201d\u201cHello! I am Leylin, and I have just arrived today!\u201d Leylin answered, and he just happened to have some questions, \u201cExcuse me, how do I get to the dining hall?\u201dHearing Leylin\u2019s voice, Bill\u2019s expression appeared as if he had expected it, \u201cRight now it\u2019s pretty late, and I\u2019m about to go there too. Let\u2019s go together?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for more!\u201d Leylin smiled gently, and closed his door.\u201cThe dining hall is on level 3, underground, and everything there is free. Of course, you can fork out money and let them make a dish that you want to eat!\u201dBill led the way as he explained.\u201cI am from Poolfield Kingdom, and you?\u201d\u201cChernobyl Islands!\u201d\u201cHeavens! So far! You have definitely suffered along the way, huh?\u201d Bill was obviously a chatterbox, and Leylin managed to probe some information out from him.Bill was the same as him, a new acolyte, and only arrived five days earlier than Leylin did. As for the whole of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, the professors numbered close to a hundred, while the acolytes numbered over a thousand.\u201cOh right! Who is your mentor?\u201d Bill asked.\u201cKroft, an alchemy professor!\u201d Leylin replied.\u201cAlchemy? You\u2019re good!\u201d Bill was seemingly startled.\u201cIs it difficult to learn alchemy?\u201d Leylin was a little worried now.\u201cNot only is it difficult, the study of alchemy requires a huge amount of resources and ingredients. People who don\u2019t come from a good family background will rarely choose this! However, alchemists tend to make a lot of money after they have been certified!\u201d Bill gave Leylin a regretful look.\u201cYou must have been randomly assigned a mentor during the selection, and then duped by that python Spotty!\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201d Leylin rubbed his nose.\u201cAlright! We\u2019re here at the dining hall now, take whatever you want to eat!\u201dThe dining hall was extremely extravagant, and the food was more delicious than what he had on the Dirigible. Everyone who sat here was also an acolyte, and there were no signs of a Magus.After dinner, Leylin bid farewell to Bill and then returned to his room. He sat on his bed, with the crystal ball clasped in his hands.\u201cI can finally start practicing as a Magus!\u201dLeylin stroked the crystal ball, his eyes gradually turned hazy, and his nostrils flared.[A data interface has been discovered, start transmitting or not?] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cBegin!\u201d At Leylin\u2019s command, an acute pain entered his brain, as if someone filled it with lead.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026 \u201c Leylin grabbed his head, and discovered that many images and words appeared in his brain along with the pain, and the first line was: \u201cElementary Meditation Technique!\u201dThis information appeared out of nowhere, and was firmly imprinted in Leylin\u2019s mind.After some time, Leylin finally recovered from the pain, but he was still feeling groggy.\u201cA.I Chip, defragment the data for the elementary meditation technique!\u201d[Beep! Task established, beginning defragmentation!]A blue interface started to flicker in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.[Beep! The data has been defragmented. 21.3% of miscellaneous information has been removed, begin to transmit?\u201d\u201cTransmit!\u201d Leylin ordered.With the continuous transmission from the A.I Chip, Leylin began to gain an understanding of the elementary meditation technique for acolytes.Elementary meditation techniques are, as their name implies, special meditation techniques given to acolytes, and are the most basic of techniques. After many years of modification, they have already reached a near perfect stage, and the content of the elementary meditation techniques from the various academies did not differ by much.To be specific, they are similar to the visualisation techniques from his previous world. An acolyte draws mind runes inside their mind to increase their Spiritual Force, and as they draw more mind runes, their Spiritual Force grows stronger.Every Magi liked to record all the precise details and processes down.In regards to acolytes, they have divided the practice into three levels: Level 1 Acolyte, Level 2 Acolyte, and Level 3 Acolyte.As for the division between levels, it is seen through the progression of the elementary meditation technique.When one has the ability to meditate with 8 runes, they have passed the criteria for a Level 1 Acolyte. Being able to meditate with 24 runes is the sign of a Level 2 Acolyte. As for Level 3 Acolytes, there seems to be other conditions needed.As for the meditation progress, it is closely related to a Magus\u2019 aptitude.\u201cIn regards to meditation practice, the superiority of a fifth grade acolyte is extremely obvious; they can become a Level 1 Acolyte in only five to six days. No wonder Jayden, who was a regular human before boarding the Dirigible, was able to use a Magic Artifact in just half a month\u2019s time.\u201dAs for a fourth grade acolyte, the time needed to become a Level 1 Acolyte is approximately fifteen to twenty days. Third grade acolytes will need a month\u2019s time; second grade acolytes will need half a year, and first grade acolytes will need several years!\u201d\u201cThis difficulty in progressing will only increase when ascending to Level 2 Acolyte and Level 3 Acolyte, hence is it understandable for professors to favour acolytes with high aptitudes. After all, maybe one can receive the remuneration of a proper Magus in a dozen years, with just a little more effort put in now!\u201d[An independent file has been created for the meditation technique data, analyse or not?] The A.I Chip prompted with a window.\u201cBegin analysing!\u201d[In the process of analysing! Progress: 0.11%] The A.I Chip showed the current state.\u201cThis crystal ball seems to input the information directly into the acolytes\u2019 brains, but the method is a little too crude and it does not care if you remember it completely or not. But the A.I Chip is able to defragment and store it directly in the memory bank, and is even able to aid by analysing the process!\u201dLeylin indifferently compared the differences between the two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tick Tock!\u201dThe hands of the bronze clock in the room swiveled around once more, as another hour passed.[The first mind rune has been analysed, start transmitting or not?] The A.I Chip prompted.\u201cHas it finally been analysed? Begin transmission!\u201dIn this period of time, Leylin had also been studying the blueprints of the meditation technique, but it was to no avail.The mind rune appeared as a 3D image and the patterns inside were extremely complicated, with no room for errors.To display this image in book form, not only would the author need to have outstanding training in the fine arts, but the reader\u2019s comprehension skills would also be put to the test.Leylin estimated that regular acolytes would need to spend a good number of days to even begin to understand a single mind rune, before starting to construct them in their brains. However, with the A.I Chip, it was done in a matter of hours.\u201cThis pace may very well be comparable to a fourth or fifth grade acolyte!\u201d Leylin estimated.After the A.I Chip\u2019s transmission, Leylin had already completely comprehended the structure of the first mind rune. It was in the shape of an \u2018A\u2019, without the horizontal line in the middle, and was filled with patterns and helixes, making one dizzy the more they looked at it.\u201cTo begin the meditation, I must first have peace of mind and imagine a serene lake\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin slowly closed his eyes.In the dimly lit room, the youth sat cross-legged and closed his eyes, as if he was in a slumber.After an unknown period of time, there were a few spots of lights flickering in the youth\u2019s surroundings. They entered the body of the youth, and very soon they disappeared.Leylin\u2019s eyelids fluttered, and he opened his eyes.\u201cSo tiring! It seems like the meditation technique and a Knight\u2019s breathing technique is the same, there is a time limit! A.I Chip! Check my body\u2019s status!\u201d[Beep! Scanning the Host\u2019s body!][The Host\u2019s brain cells have been stimulated, and all of the cells in the body have increased in activity as a whole!][Beep! The Host\u2019s Vitality has increased by 0.05!][Oh\u2026\u2026 Meditation techniques, there\u2019s no doubt that they are cultivation techniques for Magi. I can feel that the key purpose of this meditation technique is to increase the Spiritual Force, and the increase in Vitality is only an added benefit.\u201d\u201cThe Spiritual Force affects my stats! After practicing the meditation technique, my Vitality has actually started to exceed my previous limit!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression was complex, and there was an indescribable joy in his heart.\u201cAccording to the introduction in the data, sleeping right after meditation will provide the most optimal effects!\u201dLeylin stripped his outer robes, laid on the bed, and then entered into a deep sleep.[Beep Beep! The alarm is ringing!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice rang, and brought Leylin out from his sleep.\u201cIt is already the time that I set my alarm for, time really passes quickly!\u201d Leylin stretched lazily, and saw that the clock showed the time as 5:30.\u201cI\u2019d better hurry up and tidy up! I still need to see Mentor Kroft!\u201d Leylin washed up quickly, went to the dining hall and gobbled down a bread for his breakfast, and then rushed to the experiment lab from yesterday.\u201cGood morning Sir!\u201d Leylin greeted.He noticed a female acolyte beside the white haired Kroft. She had fine curves and looked beautiful, and seemed to be another apprentice of the professor.\u201cHm? You attempted the meditation technique?\u201d Kroft furrowed his brows, \u201cHow did it feel?\u201d\u201cMy head ached, and I felt a little dizzy!\u201d\u201cThis is a common aftereffect of the transmission from the memory crystal ball; you just need to get more rest during this period!\u201d Kroft said.\u201cCome, let me introduce you! This is Bicky, my other apprentice. This is Leylin, the new acolyte from yesterday!\u201d\u201cHi!\u201d Bicky bowed, giving a virtuous greeting.\u201cHello!\u201d Leylin placed his right arm on his chest, and displayed the elegance of a noble.\u201cBicky is your senior, besides her, you also have another senior called Merlin. HisPotioneering\u00a0skills are excellent!\u201d Kroft said to Leylin.\u201cMerlin has been called a once-in-a-century genius of Potioneering, and is regarded as the most likely successor of our mentor!\u201d Bicky added.\u201cHaha! Indeed! Merlin has shown outstanding talent in Potioneering! If there is anything you don\u2019t understand, you may seek his help!\u201d Once he mentioned Merlin, Kroft\u2019s face revealed a smile, and he seemed extremely satisfied with that student of his.\u201cSo Leylin, are you familiar with my rules?\u201d\u201cI have seen them when going through the professor requirements during the selection of mentors!\u201d Leylin nodded.\u201cOkay! From now on, you have to come here every day and help with the cleaning up, but you may go listen to the free lessons during breaks! As for the benefit of being under me, which is receiving information on a topic, you can choose and ask me after learning the basics!\u201dKroft said.\u201cThank you Sir!\u201d Leylin hurriedly bowed. Right now, he had no inkling whatsoever about the Magus world, so even if Kroft wanted him to choose, he would not know which was best. It was only right to choose at a later time, when he could reap the most benefits.\u201cRight now, I will give both of you half a day\u2019s break. Let Bicky accompany and show you around the academy. Bicky, tell him about the few restrictions!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Leylin and Bicky nodded their heads and left the laboratory.\u201cThis is the residence of the professors, acolytes usually aren\u2019t allowed to enter\u2026\u2026This is the Trading Post, where acolytes can make transactions with others. And here, we have the Mission Area. The different missions and levels will be written on this stone wall. Acolytes can complete these missions and obtain contribution points and Magic Crystals!\u201dBicky\u2019s voice was extremely pleasing to the ears, and she was beautiful too. Her personality was also lively. Leylin\u2019s mood improved a lot by spending time with her.The two of them strolled through the academy. It was mostly Bicky leading Leylin around, as she spoke of a few places and restrictions along the way.Unknowingly, the two of them walked into a garden.\u201cFayle, well done!\u201d \u201cGood, once more!\u201dThe sound of voices caught Leylin\u2019s attention. In the middle of the garden, a group of acolytes were standing around a large, sturdily-built youth and chatting continuously.In the centre of the crowd was a youth with a bright silver hair, with dark green eyes, and he seemed to have some sort of strange charisma.\u201cThat is senior Fayle. He\u2019s a genius; he became a Level 2 Acolyte just half a year after entering the academy!\u201d Bicky\u2019s eyes were widened, and her face shone radiantly as she muttered.\u201cThis expression? It seems like Bicky has a good impression of this Fayle!\u201d Leylin rubbed his nose.\u201cBicky! Bicky!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026What is it?\u201d Only after Leylin called out to her several times did Bicky avert her gaze. At this moment, her face was a little flushed.\u201cOh! I wanted to ask, why are there so many plants here underground!\u201dLeylin sniffed a red flower; the flower had a strong fragrance.\u201cThere are huge patches of sunlight moss on the roof of the gardens, and these mosses can emit a light similar to sunrays, hence plants can also grow underground in here.\u201dBicky explained.\u201cOh!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and wondered if he should come here more often in the future to bask in the sunlight, since being exposed to more sunlight was not bad for a person after all.Seeing Bicky\u2019s reluctance to leave, Leylin purposely pretended to have a strong interest in the garden, until Fayle and the others left.Only, Bicky would only glance at Fayle secretly, although she did not muster any courage to walk up to greet him even after such a long while. This made Leylin roll his eyes, as Bicky\u2019s attitude towards romance can be considered rare in this academy.\u201cThe Academic Area will often post the following day\u2019s class schedule, and there are many free and public lessons to choose from. As a newbie, you cannot afford to miss these!\u201dAfter leaving the garden, Bicky brought Leylin to the Academic Area, and pointed to a large wooden board. In front of it were many other acolytes who were taking down notes.\u201cFree public lessons? That means there are lessons which one must pay for?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right! There are lessons which have fees, and many advanced topics charge 1 Magic Crystal for 10 lessons. Although they are much better than public lessons, they are still somewhat inferior to the knowledge given by our own mentors!\u201dBicky smiled a little bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the only advantage is them being less expensive!\u201dLeylin nodded. On one side, there was a professor teaching dozens of students, while the other was an individual lesson, the advantages between the two are definitely different.However, he had the A.I Chip, so his learning capability was outstanding. He was confident that he would do well even in a large class.\u201cWith this method, I can definitely save some Magic Crystals!\u201d Leylin stroked his chin.He only had two Magic Crystals left. Earlier, when he was in the Mission Area, he saw that the missions that awarded Magic Crystals generally had more troublesome tasks, and required one to be a Level 1 Acolyte at least. Right now, Leylin did not meet the requirements.\u201cAs for the cleaning tasks, they are all done by those spell slaves, and the rest are all snatched by others. There is simply no place for me!\u201dLeylin was a little frustrated. Magic Crystals were the currency among Magi, and were also the most common way to obtain greater knowledge in the academy. Without Magic Crystals, his studies would be hindered.\u201cHm\u2026\u2026 I had better attend those public classes first and advance to a Level 1 Acolyte. After that, I\u2019ll consider taking up missions to earn some Magic Crystals!\u201dLeylin sighed.\u201cA.I Chip, how is the mapping of the academy?\u201d[Beep! 66.7% has been mapped]The A.I Chip replied. In front of Leylin was a blue image, each layer of the buildings was displayed and divided into multiple parts, and it looked like a beehive.Some areas even had names attached, with Bicky\u2019s explanation for them on the side.The areas that could be entered freely were marked in green, while the dangerous areas were in yellow. As for the areas that even Bicky did not dare enter, the A.I Chip indicated them in red, representing extreme danger.For those red coloured danger zones, Leylin decided to walk around them. He even decided not to ask about them before becoming a Level 3 Acolyte.\u201cThe mapping has been recorded!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and said farewell to Bicky, \u201cBicky, thank you for accompanying me for a day, I remember most of the important areas of the academy now!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Bicky played with the little white flower in her hands, \u201cIf there are any things that you don\u2019t understand, you can ask me!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Leylin gave a small smile.After bidding farewell to Bicky, Leylin ate his dinner and went back into his room. He began to practice the meditation technique.A Magus\u2019s meditation is a continuous journey, only with daily devotion and perseverance, can one achieve enough Spiritual Force to become a being that can control mysterious powers.\u201cThe A.I Chip is only useful for analysing the meditation technique. As for the creation of the mind runes, it was completely dependent on my own Spiritual Force, and it also relied a little on my comprehension and aptitude. In these areas, the A.I Chip was not much help!\u201dAfter meditating, Leylin felt his Spiritual Force increase by another tiny sliver, and then he entered into a deep slumber.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLevel 1 Acolyte\u201cA Level 1 Acolyte is actually someone with a stronger Spiritual Force than an average person\u2019s. At the same time, he is able to move energy particles and store them inside their body, and is a newbie at conceptualising the creation of magic power. Only a Level 2 Acolyte will be able to access a magic spell\u2019s formula and cast the spell in its complete form.But once their body creates magic power, their stats can be strengthened through constant radiation as their body resists the poisoning from the external radiation.Leylin made his judgment on the levels separating the acolytes based on the data on the meditation technique.\u201cA.I Chip! Retrieve all the data I have gathered today, and begin analysing!\u201dThis is what Leylin had been doing all this time. He would do his best to collect data from other people without drawing their attention, and store the data in folders.He created a folder with the data regarding Spiritual Force and how to transform them, a lesson which Leylin learnt yesterday. The information required was too much, and the process may be measured in years.[Beep! Analysis completed. Result: The entire surroundings of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is contaminated with traces of radiation. The biggest sources of contamination are Magi, and a few experimental setups and materials. The Host is suggested to stay away from these sources, or to increase the resistance of the body!]\u201cAs I expected! There are no regular human beings in the whole of this academy because of the environmental effects that the Magi and acolytes bring about. As for these effects, only a Magus can resist against it. A regular human would most likely have a lifespan of a few years in this environment!\u201dLeylin\u2019s face darkened, and conjured up the images of a few people, including Bicky and Kroft.\u201cAccording to the readings of the radiation emitted by them, a Magus is actually a moving source of radiation. Each one of them is like a miniscule nuclear reactor, or, could they have made use of the radiation to advance??\u201dLeylin furrowed his brows.\u201cNo matter what, I must hurry up and become a Level 1 Acolyte. The longer I take, the greater the damage my body will receive.Leylin was resolved.In the next two weeks, Leylin would report to where Kroft was every day, assist in the cleaning of the experiment lab, and sort out a few insignificant experiment resources.In this period, he had seen Kroft\u2019s genius apprentice Merlin, who was also his senior. Merlin was extremely tall, and had a very taciturn personality. He constantly poured over his experiments. Besides Kroft, his interactions with Bicky and Leylin were minimal. This could be one factor attributing to his success in Potioneering.In the remaining time, he spent them in the free public lessons.The free lessons in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy were not many, and they only consisted of the history of Magi, the basics of the ancient Byron language, the principles of Magi spells, basic Potioneering, anatomy, and basic magic spell theory.The professors of the public lessons always had dark expressions, and they hurriedly left right after the period ended. Not only did they not answer the acolytes\u2019 questions, it seemed like everyone owed them Magic Crystals.\u201cIt was a public lesson after all, being able to listen is already not too bad!\u201d Leylin comforted himself. He had the A.I Chip and could record the lessons completely. In the future, he could always take them out for reference when he revises. As for the other acolytes, they were in a worse state. If they did not understand, there was always a price to pay to obtain information from the professors or other acolytes. Leylin was even prepared to earn some Magic Crystals by giving away information from these public lessons.\u201cToday\u2019s topic was really difficult! The image of that Barren Lizard\u2019s anatomy was only shown for a few seconds. I did not even have time to look at it clearly!\u201d Bill complained.\u201cThere\u2019s no choice! The study of anatomy is a very broad topic, and the images are aplenty, classes will not end if they\u2019re not taught fast enough!\u201d Leylin replied by his side. He was neighbours with Bill, and both of them were fresh acolytes, so they often attended classes together. Their friendship considered pretty good.As for Kaliweir and the others, because they were designated to various mentors and lived rather far away, they barely maintained their relationships.\u201cProfessor Marlene\u2019s anatomy classes are prerequisites for more advanced topics, so we have to learn it!\u201d Bill was a little frustrated.\u201cLeylin, did you remember everything from earlier?\u201d\u201cTo memorise everything is impossible, but I have taken notes on most of the diagrams and the images depicting the vital body parts!\u201d Leylin concealed his trump card.\u201cSo awesome! Could you tutor me after classes? I will fork out one Magic Crystal!\u201d Bill made up his mind,\u201cI want to major in Transfiguration, so I must excel in anatomy!\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201d Leylin smiled and nodded his head.The information of the few paid lessons in the academy was not allowed to be traded in private. But as for the public lessons, there were no such restrictions.Leylin had asked around, and it seemed that the higher level acolytes did not think much of these measly wages, while the lower level acolytes did not have much confidence to teach and failed to meet the requirements. Hence, this benefitted him greatly.\u201cHowever, you know that I have to undergo meditation at night, so let\u2019s schedule the lessons right after dinner. 1-hour lessons for a week. How is it?\u201dLeylin asked.\u201cNo problem!\u201d Bill answered. This amount of time was similar to that of the paid public lessons, but the tutoring was done one-on-one, so it was a fair price.After dinner, Leylin went to Bill\u2019s room and tutored him on the topic of anatomy. After an hour, he returned to his dorm.Playing with the Magic Crystal in his hand, Leylin nodded his head, \u201cBill knows how to conduct himself, and he has already paid the fees upfront!\u201dPlacing the black crystallised object onto the bed, Leylin took out the black sack hanging from his waist, and poured the contents out on the bed.A total of four black Magic Crystals were dropped onto the bed, bouncing slightly.\u201cI am a new acolyte and have only studied for half a month. Apart from Bill and some others, no one believes in my abilities. I have only earned 2 Magic Crystals so far!\u201d\u201cAi! It\u2019s hard to earn money through tutoring, and it takes up a lot of time. Senior Merlin can brew a random potion and earn ten times faster than me by selling it!\u201dPotioneering Masters are rather rare amongst Magi, and a huge investment is needed to become one. However, after succeeding, one can make money at a terrifying pace.\u201cAlmost there! I have a feeling that I will become a Level 1 Acolyte tonight!\u201d After reaching Level 1 Acolyte, I will be able to move the energy particles in the air. Not only will I be able to resist the radiation from the academy\u2019s buildings, I will also be able to attempt to experiment with basic potion brewing!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed with excitement, but very soon he recovered the Magic Crystals on the bed properly, exercising restraint. He then sat cross legged on the bed, and began the meditation for the day.The air in the room quietened down, and only the faint sounds of Leylin\u2019s breathing could be heard.Leylin\u2019s chest moved with an undulating pattern and his expression was serene, with only some restless movements beneath his eyelids.After about an hour, several black spots of light radiated from Leylin\u2019s forehead, just like fireflies.These light spots hovered around Leylin, and finally entered his orifices. It looked a little eerie.\u201cHu\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the black coloured spots of light entered Leylin\u2019s body, he felt his whole body shudder. The muscles on his face twitched, and large beads of sweat rolled down. Very soon, he returned back to having a peaceful state.After some time, Leylin opened his eyes.\u201cI have finally advanced to a Level 1 Acolyte! This speed of half of a month is slightly inferior to a regular fourth grade acolyte\u2019s.\u201d\u201cOriginally, I could have advanced five days ago, but I stopped to stabilise my Spiritual Force. There were few difficulties in advancing this time, which may be attributed to that!\u201dThe one reason for prolonging the date of advancement was to stable the Spiritual Force, and another was to keep a low profile.A regular third grade acolyte must take around a month\u2019s time to turn into a Level 1 Acolyte after receiving the meditation technique.As for half a month\u2019s time, that was the measure of a fourth grade acolyte. Leylin did not wanted to undergo any tests caused by suspicions of him having the wrong aptitude. If the A.I Chip was discovered in the end, not only would it be lost, his life might also be in danger!After all, the A.I Chip now has undergone changes after transcending dimensions. It has already fused together with his soul and cannot be separated at all.\u201cAccording to the estimations of the A.I Chip, a Level 1 Acolyte\u2019s Spiritual Force is roughly double that of an average adult. Moreover, Spiritual Force seems to have a life of its own, strongly attracting the energy particles in the air towards it!\u201dLeylin stretched his hands, and a layer of black coloured light wrapped around his arm, like a layer of cotton candy. It also felt a little cooling.\u201cI have the highest elemental affinity with the Dark element, and will choose to cultivate on the path of the Dark element. This was the plan that I set for myself since long ago. As for the energy particles of Fire and the other elements, I shall just keep a few of them to use it to my advantage in future!\u201d\u201cPa!!\u201dLeylin snapped his fingers several times, and a layer of faint blue light lit up on his body.What followed next was a layer of steam, which made Leylin\u2019s clothes wet.\u201cThis is similar to taking a shower!\u201d Leylin smiled, and then a layer of red light shone.As Leylin\u2019s body was enveloped by the red light, water vapour emitted from his body. Very soon the water was all evaporated, and the room seemed to be a little humid.\u201cAfter becoming an acolyte, I am able to use these energy particles for simple daily activities, this is really convenient!\u201dLeylin exclaimed again, and asked, \u201cA.I Chip, have you recorded the processes earlier?\u201d[Beep! Recording done, please provide a name!]\u201cSimple usage of Water element and Fire elemental energy particles!][Beep! The renaming is done, storing in data bank]With the help of the A.I Chip, Leylin had one of the best comprehension abilities for the usage of energy particles amongst the Level 1 Acolyte.Leylin smiled, but as he was about to stand, he suddenly felt giddy.\u201cI overspent my Spiritual Force earlier!\u201d Leylin realised the reason and smiled bitterly, \u201cThe Spiritual Force of a Level 1 Acolyte is still too minuscule. To properly use the energy particles on a daily basis, I must only do it when I am a Level 3 Acolyte at least.Leylin rubbed his temples, \u201cI already meditated earlier, so now I can only sleep to replenish my Spiritual Force!\u2019He hurriedly straightened out the room, and entered into a deep sleep.The next morning, Leylin was filled with vigor as he got off the bed, and headed to Mentor Kroft\u2019s experiment lab.\u201cOh? This energy movement?\u201dThe white haired Kroft was startled, and immediately looked at Leylin who had walked in, \u201cLeylin, you have broken through!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Leylin humbly lowered his head.\u201cIt has only been twenty odd days since you started meditating, it seems like your aptitude amongst the third grade acolytes is outstanding, and it almost reaches that of the fourth grade acolytes!\u201dKroft smiled with gratification.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have already become a Level 1 Acolyte and have understood the basics from the public lessons\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin said softly.\u201cI know, you wish to choose the subject for the knowledge I am providing!\u201d Kroft interrupted Leylin\u2019s speech.\u201cI heard that you have already been teaching other acolytes information from the public lessons that you\u2019ve attended to earn Magic Crystals. It seems like your learning and memorising abilities are rather outstanding. From what I see now, you have the capability to learn a information of a higher tier!\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Leylin bowed deeply.Leylin had some understanding towards the paid lessons in the academy. Although professors have information on a higher level, it was only their own findings.As for the other cutting-edge research, including the results from various personal experiments, information was only traded at the professors\u2019 level.This information was deemed the best, and can even be transferred directly into an acolyte\u2019s memory so they will never forget it.However, the fees were also the most expensive, each subject required at least ten Magic Crystals, and Leylin simply could not afford it right now.The only thing he could hope for was the one free subject that Kroft promised at the start.Kroft nodded his head, and moved the apparatus on his table aside. He then retrieved some strange items from god-knows-where and placed them on the table.There was a huge book with a yellow cover, a crystal ball, and a test tube filled with yellowish liquid.\u201cThese three items represent my 3 areas of specialisation: The book on the left represents the Neutralisation of Energy, the crystal ball represents Herbalism, and the test tube represents Potioneering. Make your choice!\u201d Kroft said.\u201cI choose Potioneering!\u201d The reason Leylin chose Kroft as his mentor was to advance in Potioneering and then rely on selling potions to earn money for his studies, so naturally he chose this.Elementary Potioneering is an advanced course stemming from the public Potioneering Basics course. In theory, it is possible to start brewing potions after fully understanding these two lessons.\u201cI knew you would choose this!\u201d The middle-aged Kroft revealed a smile.\u201cThe art of potion brewing is extremely complex and complicated, the slightest mistake will result in a failure. All of the Potion Masters have spent a vast amount of resources to accumulate their experience. Are you ready for this?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir! I believe in this saying: You may not be rewarded for hard work, but without hard work, there will definitely be no reward!\u201d\u201cIndeed! A very good mindset. One needs to have this philosophy on the road to truth!\u201d Kroft nodded\u00a0and handed the yellow test tube to Leylin.\u201cThis is yours now!\u201d\u201cThis? How do I use it?\u201d Leylin looked at the test tube in his hands.\u201cJust drink from it directly!\u201dLeylin opened the wooden plug and poured the yellowish liquid into his mouth.An obnoxious sewer stench infiltrated his senses, and the smell lingered in his nose. Leylin\u2019s face turned red, and tears even came out.He barely managed to swallow it as he gasped for air.\u201cI swear, I have never drunk such a smelly thing before!!!\u201dSmelly!!! An unimaginable stench constantly shocked Leylin\u2019s nerves, making him feel like fainting.Under the stimulation of the extreme smell, the surroundings appeared blurry to Leylin, and the items in the vicinity all seemed to be distorted.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026It feels\u2026\u2026Not so\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin looked at Kroft, and at this moment, the professor looked like a noodle, twisting and distorting. The professor\u2019s lips opened and closed and he spoke sporadically, which brought about a lot of noise. It sounded like the friction produced between two metals, or some broken radio with poor signal.Leylin raised his hand, his smooth palms seemed to be filled with folds, and even melted like a candle, falling down one drop at a time.And finally, Leylin\u2019s entire body turned into a puddle of liquid and disappeared completely into the darkness\u2026\u2026\u201cHow do you feel?\u201dKroft\u2019s voice rang, and Leylin was startled. He touched his head, the hard sensation bringing along warmth and a little moisture.The surroundings turned back to normal, and Kroft stood there smiling.\u201cI don\u2019t feel too good!\u201d Large amounts of sweat trickled down from Leylin\u2019s head.\u201cWas what I saw earlier an illusion? It felt too real!\u201d\u201cThat is a normal occurrence, the illusionary spells of Magi seem like reality to acolytes, and some acolytes have even experienced their whole life inside the illusions and died of old age!\u201dKroft\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cThe information has already been transferred into your brain, do some more meditation after you go back!\u201dAt this moment, Leylin discovered a block of new information inside his brain. A phrase appeared on the right side of the text, saying: \u201cElementary Potioneering\u201d\u201cAlright! Today your task is to sweep Area 3, and also freeze all the Fire Ant Grass\u2026\u2026\u201dKroft handed out the tasks.Leylin nodded his head and picked up the tools lying in the corner of the lab, and then headed to Area 3.\u201cCongratulations, Leylin!\u201d During Leylin\u2019s break time, Bicky came before Leylin.\u201cI was just lucky!\u201d Leylin smiled lightly.Bicky had come here a year earlier than him and was also a Level 1 Acolyte.\u201cOnce you are a Level 2 Acolyte, you will be able to use rank 0 spells! Also, the mind runes will only get increasingly difficult. I still have to persevere for at least another year of meditation before I have a chance at advancing.\u201dWith the A.I Chip, Leylin was fully aware of the situation he was in.On the other side, Merlin, who was boring over his experiments, raised his head and forced a smile that was uglier than crying.Leylin nodded his head in acknowledgement. He knew that this senior of his had burnt the muscles of his face in an experiment and was now unable to make any facial expressions.\u201cMagi experiments are really treacherous!\u201d Leylin shook his head.Leylin was rather efficient and normally finished the task Kroft gave him by noon. If there was spare time in the afternoon, he would go listen to the public lessons.\u201cGoodbye!\u201d After saying goodbye to Bicky and Merlin, Leylin did not go to the Academic Area, but instead went to the Trading Post.The Trading Post was huge, and was located beside the Mission Area. However, it was rather chaotic; many grey robed acolytes set up stalls, with an erect signboard stating the items and conditions that they wished to sell or trade.Once in a while, a few acolytes would engage in haggling, it was extremely bustling.\u201cIt seems like only acolytes are around. As for the Magi, they should have another area to trade in!\u201d Leylin looked on and only saw grey robes, not a single white or black robed Magus was present.Leylin browsed through the stalls. Some of them were set up on the floor, similar to the previous world\u2019s street vendors, and looked to be a little dirty.The floor stalls\u2019 items belonged to the miscellaneous category; most of them were bows, knives, darts and so on. There were also the fur, livers, and eyes of living organisms, and some still had traces of blood. The rest were some other items that Leylin could not identify.As for potions, every stall with \u2018Potions\u2019 on its signboard had acolytes clamouring over them. The stall owners all had calm expressions and radiated strong energy waves.According to the estimation of the A.I Chip, most of these acolytes were Level 3 Acolytes!\u201cAs expected, the rarity of potions is above my imagination, not to mention Magic Artifacts, not a single one is on sale!Leylin thought of Jayden, who previously used the green coloured badge. That was a low grade Magic Artifact, similar to the ring he had before.A Level 1 Acolyte could not use any spells, but Jayden had previously subdued Kaliweir through the green badge Magic Artifact.\u201cNow it seems like the Magic Artifact was given to Jayden by Dorotte!\u201dLeylin could not help but be a little envious. He previously owned a Magic Artifact too, but unfortunately it had been broken and was used in the transaction for applying to the academy. With these conditions now, it would be extremely difficult to obtain another one.Leylin looked at the goods on display as he walked towards the centre of the Trading Post.There were a few wooden huts here, and they seemed to have higher standards compared to the surroundings. The acolytes who occasionally walked in and out radiated strong energy waves.Leylin casually walked into a shop selling potions.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d The shop owner was a fatty, and wore a grey robe. He looked to be a little lazy. According to the readings of the A.I Chip, he was also a Level 3 Acolyte and even carried a Magic Artifact.\u201cI need a set of equipment so that I can practice brewing potions!\u201d Leylin said unhurriedly.\u201cAnother one who is dreaming! And it\u2019s actually a Level 1 Acolyte who wants to try brewing potions! You think you\u2019re Merlin?\u201d The fatty scolded him.\u201cExcuse me, Merlin is my senior and we have the same mentor!\u201d Leylin replied.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this! It turns out you\u2019re Kroft\u2019s apprentice, so already brewing potions at this stage is understandable, it is understandable!\u201d The fatty\u2019s face seemed to be filled with spirit, \u201cSo you\u2019re Merlin\u2019s junior, hello, I am Woox!\u201dThe fatty introduced himself, and there was a cunning expression on his face, \u201cRather than potion brewing, if you are able to get me some of Merlin\u2019s potions, I will give a good price for them. Of course, if they were made by Professor Kroft, it would be even better\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy apologies! Professor Kroft\u2019s potions are impossible! As for Merlin\u2019s, I\u2019ll give it a try!\u201d Leylin rolled his eyes, but he did not reject him outrightly.\u201cNow, can you give me an introduction of the apparatus?\u201d\u201cOh! Of course! Of course!\u201d The fatty rubbed his hands and placed a few sets of glass apparatus on the wooden table.\u201cThere is all of this! They are second hand, but they are still usable. I recommend this set; it\u2019s from a Level 3 Acolyte that did not want it anymore!\u201dThe fatty took out an apparatus set which included beakers, a glass rod, a petri dish, test tubes, and a set of pale yellow tools. It seemed rather complete.Leylin examined the equipment with his hands.According to the analysis of the A.I Chip, the quality of this apparatus set was average, but it was enough for him to use.\u201cI\u2019ll take this one then! How many Magic Crystals?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cTwo pieces!\u201d The fatty replied.\u201cWrap it well for me!\u201d Leylin handed the two Magic Crystals over to the fatty. Fatty received them, and packaged the set before handing it over to Leylin.\u201cDo you have any elementary potion formulas?\u201d Leylin placed the bundle on his back, and asked again.\u201cYes! I have formulas for Strength Potions, Hemostatic Potions, and Bug Removal Potions, which one do you want?\u201d\u201cThe Strength Potion!\u201d These were all elementary potion formulas, so Leylin simply picked one.\u201cGive me a set of ingredients as well!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayStarting AttemptsThe fatty Woox took out a black coloured box from a shelf behind him and placed it on the table. He also took out a sheet of parchment from under the sales counter. It seemed to be extremely old, with the ends a little torn.\u201cOne copy of the Strength Potion formula, one Magic Crystal!\u201d\u201cOne set of ingredients, enough for ten tries, one Magic Crystal!\u201dLeylin opened the black coloured box. Inside were ten crimson-coloured fruits arranged neatly, which seemed to have traces of cracks on their surface, and beside them was a root of some green plant, and a bottle of black powder.Putting the box away and picking up the faint yellowish parchment paper, he saw a formula written in black ink, which even included the areas to note. Although the handwriting was a little faded, it was still legible as a whole.Leylin nodded his head and tucked the parchment paper into his robes. He took out the last 2 Magic Crystals he had in his waist pouch and handed it to Woox, then left the hut without turning back.He only had 4 Magic Crystals and had spent them all on this small amount of ingredients. This terrifying expenditure for potion brewing was not something the average acolyte could bear.What followed next was that Leylin\u2019s daily routine had taken a similar route to how he had been in his previous world.Every day, he was shuttling to and fro between five places: the dorm, the dining hall, the Academic Area, the experiment lab and the library.Another month passed unknowingly.[The gathering of data has been completed!] The A.I Chip\u2019s notification sounded.Sitting on one side of a long table in the library, Leylin closed the book he was holding in his hands.Apart from attending classes and aiding his mentor with his experiments, the majority of his time was spent in the library. Almost every book that could be read for free was browsed through, and the A.I Chip finished accumulating more data.\u201cWhew\u2026\u2026 I have finally understood the formulation of potions!\u201d Leylin exhaled loudly.Although Kroft had provided some elementary information about Potioneering, there were many things that he still did not understand. He learnt things like the terminology and vocabulary by himself in the library. If he wanted a professor\u2019s explanation he would have had to pay a fee. However, it was a pity that Leylin had turned into a peasant with 0 Magic Crystals.Many acolytes who were embarrassingly short of Magic Crystals did the same thing, browsing through the variety of free information in the library. However, they did not have Leylin\u2019s A.I Chip, so they usually needed a dozen days to a month to find what they wanted in the library.As for Leylin, he had now recorded all the information that was available to him in the library already. He even made a search function for it, so the information would be at his perusal if he met with any questions in the future.However, even Elementary Potioneering was considered higher-tiered information. Even with the constant analyses from the A.I Chip, Leylin only knew about one-third of it, but that was already extremely useful to him.At least now, when he looked back upon the basics of Potioneering, it was like looking down at the tiles from the roof of a tall building.As for the elementary potion brewing and the Strength Potion formula, they had been fully analysed, so it was time to put them into practice.\u201cMy accumulation of knowledge is already enough, I\u2019ll begin brewing the Strength Potion today!\u201dLeylin placed the books back on the shelves and left the library.A female acolyte with brunette hair raised her head and glanced at Leylin, before returning her attention to the black book in her hands.The library had many acolytes, and yet they were all well behaved and extremely quiet. It was very suitable for reading, and one of Leylin\u2019s favourite hangouts.\u201cHey! Leylin!\u201dWhen he walked out of the library, an acolyte greeted him. Leylin raised his head, \u201cRyan! Kaliweir!\u201dKaliweir wore the grey robes of an acolyte, and his original haughtiness had lessened, \u201cCongratulations on becoming a Level 1 Acolyte!\u201d\u201cThank you, congratulations to you too!\u201d Leylin replied with a smile.He too had sensed that Kaliweir had turned into a Level 1 Acolyte.\u201cThe few of us in the clique have already turned into Level 1 Acolytes!\u201d Kaliweir stressed the first few words and seemed to have automatically excluded Guricha and the others.\u201cWe have taken up a few missions recently, do you have any interest in joining us?\u201d Kaliweir asked.Kaliweir seemed to be trying hard to maintain the previous group of friends.\u201cDo a mission now?\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cFrom what I know, the area outside the academy has been getting dangerous lately, especially for those Level 1 Acolytes who do not even know any spells\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no choice, any high-tiered information here has to be bought, and Magic Crystals are the only form of currency! The Magic Crystals that we brought have already been spent!\u201d Kaliweir smiled bitterly.\u201cIf you want to be a Potions Master, the expenditure of resources will be extremely great\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAbout taking up missions, I\u2019ll consider it again when I have become a Level 2 Acolyte! Take care of yourselves!\u201d Leylin eventually declined. The rewards for completing missions were extremely alluring, but one needed to risk their life to claim them.\u201cAlright then! I heard that you are earning Magic Crystals by giving tuition to others. Could you also teach us, it can be in accordance to your rates!\u201dAfter hearing that Leylin was unwilling to go, Kaliweir felt a little dejected, but he continued to ask.\u201cDefinitely, it\u2019ll be my pleasure. I can even give you guys favourable rates!\u201d Leylin smiled lightly, exchanging benefits was always the norm for Magi.Both sides decided on the location and date, and then Kaliweir and his party left after that.Seeing their departing figures, Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cHe is still roping people in? What a pity, Kaliweir has still not understood that in the world of Magi, one\u2019s own strength holds the most importance!\u201dShaking his head, he returned to his dorm.Every acolyte in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had a dorm of their own, so secrecy and safety were not an issue.Leylin locked the door and hung up a \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 sign, only then did he return to the room beside the bedroom.A large black coloured table occupied the room, and Leylin\u2019s previously bought apparatus set had been placed on it.\u201cAfter a few attempts at practicing, I am now a little more familiar with these apparatus, and I finished analysing the formula for the Strength Potion today, so it\u2019s about time to start!\u201dLeylin muttered to himself and took out the black box containing the ingredients. He placed it on the table and opened it.The crimson fruit, green stem and bottle of black powder appeared before his eyes.Leylin\u2019s fingers stroked the surfaces of these 3 items, \u201cA.I Chip! Measure the activity within and establish a model!\u201d[Establishing scan, in the midst of gathering data, beginning construction!]\u201cBegin the simulation of the experiment!\u201d Seeing the A.I Chip complete its task, Leylin gave it another command.[Simulation of model in process\u2026\u2026 Strength Potion Formula\u2026\u2026 Estimated time consumed: 2 hours 21 minutes!]\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s possible!\u201d Leylin smiled jubilantly.Even for identical ingredients, the slightest deviation would result in different results when making the potion.As for qualified Potions Masters, they must make use of their experience and put the theory into practice, then make adjustments to obtain the desired properties of the potion.This field only relied on raw talent and the future accumulation of experience.As for the A.I Chip, it was able to scan and produce simulations, resulting in a success rate that was much higher than for many other acolytes.Leylin patiently waited for some time, and then heard the A.I Chip\u2019s voice, [The simulation of the model is completed, success rate: 23.6%]\u201cA success rate close to one-quarter?\u201d Leylin was in ecstasy.\u201cA regular acolyte will always fail on their first attempt at brewing potions. As for me, I\u2019ll be able to have a one in four chance of success if I follow the A.I Chip\u2019s instructions?\u201d\u201cBegin transmitting the process for the experiment!\u201d[Beginning the transmission of data!] A few images flashed by Leylin\u2019s eyes as if he had already practiced making these potions countless of times. Various scenarios and their suitable responses, as well as the preparation of ingredients, were all presented in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s time to start!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression turned solemn, and he picked up a crimson fruit, \u201cThis is a Blood Vitality Fruit and it contains a huge amount of nourishment if it was prepared in an antidote\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin placed the Blood Vitality Fruit into a white basin. He picked up a pounding tool and smashed the fruit into a pulp. The red juices flowed out, and an alcoholic scent was emitted from it.After filtering out the mashed Blood Vitality Fruit, Leylin poured the red juice into a beaker.After the black candlestick had been lit, light blue flames continuously lapped at the bottom of the beaker. Within minutes, the red juice in the beaker started to boil, and a few flecks of black powder constantly jumped about in the bubbles.Leylin picked up the glass rod beside him, and stirred the contents of the beaker.\u201cMarliwoosha!\u201d Leylin chanted.A thread of Spiritual Force travelled through the glass rod and entered the bubbling liquid, and a few wisps of black gas continued to be produced. It was the poison inside the Blood Vitality Fruit.This was why only a Level 1 Acolyte and above could start to practice making potions, as a few steps required the usage of energy particles.After all of the black gaseous substance were expelled, Leylin placed the liquid, which was even more crimson than before, into a test tube.\u201cThe first step is completed! The degree of purification isn\u2019t bad!\u201d\u201cThe next part should be the stem of the Silk Fruit\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat Leylin did next was to prepare the rest of the Blood Vitality Fruit and Silk Fruit together. He failed somewhere in the middle for a few times, and finally succeeded after making the 8th batch of the crimson liquid and the 7th batch of the frozen green substance.\u201cThe next step should be the final blending process!\u201dLeylin placed the contents of the frozen green substance onto a petri dish, took out the black powder from the glass bottle, and sprinkled it on top.The black powder caused a strong reaction after coming into contact with the frozen green substance. The frozen green substance continued to swell and let out a humming noise.\u201cIce!\u201d Leylin muttered an incantation in the Byrn language.White mist suddenly appeared from the petri dish, condensing into a layer of ice and solidifying the frozen green substance yet again.\u201cIt is time!\u201d Leylin placed the frozen lump into a beaker, where a flame blazed continuously underneath the beaker.\u201cThe final step!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes widened, and he poured the purified crimson liquid into the beaker.A thread of his Spiritual Force also continuously extended into the beaker.\u201cPa!\u201d A sound suddenly came from the beaker, the frozen lump and the red liquid suddenly turned black, and a sickening stench emitted from it.\u201cHave I failed?\u201d Leylin was indifferent.\u201cA.I Chip, analyse the reason!\u201d[Beep! In the process of analysing\u2026\u2026Conclusion: The Host\u2019s Spiritual Force was unstable, and the temperature of the flames caused some distortion\u2026\u2026]The A.I Chip replayed Leylin\u2019s earlier actions and revealed the reason for failure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Under the interference of the willpower from the depths of the abyss, you shall fuse! Furikesha Keleyahsan\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin chanted the final phase of the incantation.The various colours in the beaker continued to fuse together as he chanted. The substance finally turned into a faint blue colour liquid and emitted a fragrant and alluring scent.\u201cIt\u2019s completed! I successfully brewed the Strength Potion!\u201dLeylin smiled lightly, and poured the light blue liquid into a tiny test tube.\u201cThe liquid in this finger-length test tube can provide the nourishment that a person needs for 7 days, and also ensure that the person\u2019s physical body and mental energy will be vigorous. It is a favourite for people who work on long experiments and adventurers! The normal price is 5 Magic Crystals!\u201dLeylin shook the test tube, and the potion inside glowed enchantingly under the light.One night passed, Leylin looked at the three light blue test tubes that he held absentmindedly.\u201cWith ten sets of ingredients, I succeeded three times and obtained three potions!\u201cThis news definitely cannot be leaked out; otherwise I will not be able to explain myself!\u201d Leylin resolved, and destroyed the three test tubes containing the potions.\u201cWhat a pity!\u201d Leylin was a little heartbroken.\u201cThese 3 potions are worth 15 Magic Crystals, but the production cost is only 1 Magic Crystal. This potion industry has a crazy profit margin of over a dozen times its cost!!!\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m unable to sell them now! Aaarghhh!!\u201d Leylin was rather exasperated.\u201cNot only can I not sell the potions, I still need to earn money to buy ingredients to continue my experiments and put on a fa\u00e7ade of failure. I can only sell the most basic of potions after half a year!\u201dThis estimate was based on Merlin\u2019s success rate. He did not want to stand out and attract too much attention. Hence, he had to perform a little worse than Merlin. Merlin had a huge amount of ingredients and continuously practiced brewing back then. Only after a month did he manage to brew his first potion. Leylin did not have many Magic Crystals, so he could only show his talent in potion brewing after half a year.He was, after all, an apprentice of the Potion\u2019s Professor, and when he finally brewed his first potion successfully after half a year of failure, he would only be labelled as an ordinary talent as an apprentice of the Potion\u2019s Professor, which was extremely logical.\u201cPotions absolutely cannot be sold in large quantities within the academy grounds, unless\u2026\u2026 I am able to find a black market? But travelling outside the academy is too dangerous!\u201dLeylin shook his head, tidied up the experiment apparatus, and walked out of the room.\u201cThis also proves that having such a high precision A.I Chip gives me a huge edge over others in tasks with troublesome details! What\u2019s next is to continue to focus and break through to a Level 2 Acolyte!\u201d\u201cAfter I have the ability, I will abide by this cycle of selling potions, earning Magic Crystals, and gaining knowledge.\u201dLeylin still needed close to a year\u2019s time to break through to a Level 2 Acolyte, according to the calculations from the A.I Chip.After all, it would get increasingly harder to construct the 24 mind runes as the runes multiplied, and he also needed to accumulate more knowledge.\u201cIn this period, I can constantly gather data and finish compiling the information on Spiritual Force. This will be very useful to me in the future!\u201dUnknowingly, another half a year passed just like that.A brown-haired youth lowered his head as he walked on the black tiled pavement, as if he was deep in thought.This youth looked to be only thirteen or fourteen years of age, and had brown hair. His face was unusually pale, if it had not seen the sun for a long time.This youth was naturally Leylin. At this moment, his right hand was hidden inside his sleeves, holding on to a test tube, and he appeared to be making some kind of choice.\u201cIt has already been half a year since the first time I successfully brewed a potion,!\u201d Leylin looked at the acolytes walking past him and thought to himself.In this half a year, many things had happened within the academy. For instance Fayle achieved some great accomplishments, and Merlin managed to brew a new potion. The fame of these geniuses only increased.However, Leylin was more concerned with the fact that Jayden had already advanced to a Level 2 Acolyte.He recalled that when Kaliweir spoke of this news, he could not hide the fear and envy in his eyes despite trying his best to conceal it.The aptitude, as well as advancement, of a fifth grade acolyte was extremely startling.As a fellow acolyte who came from the same area as him, Leylin did not have much thoughts towards it. He buried himself with the work he had to do, and to an outsider, he was just an ordinary Level 1 Acolyte.In this half year, Leylin had bought many of the Strength Potion ingredients and conducted many potion-brewing sessions. He also invested all of the profit he earned from giving tuition into this potion making. He also put up a front to conceal the A.I Chip and tried to brew a potion without the A.I Chip\u2019s help most of the time, which had a success rate of zero. So far, he had spent a dozen odd Magic Crystals on this.Of course, he also he also brought forward the problems he encountered to his mentor, Kroft, at times and asked other questions about the basics and brewing techniques. This was greatly beneficial for his Potioneering.Secretly, Leylin could already affirm that with the help of the A.I Chip, his Potioneering skills had already surpassed Merlin, only being a little inferior to his mentor, Kroft.Today, it would be the day he \u2018accidentally\u2019 succeeded in brewing a potion and let his mentor evaluate it.This time, the successful product was controlled by him through the A.I Chip. He purposely made some minute errors, making it seem like an inferior product that was made by an acolyte, but it would still be considered decent for a new acolyte.Leylin\u2019s palm, which was gripping the potion, uncontrollably tightened.\u201cOnly after today, can I start to sell a few potions in broad daylight and earn some Magic Crystals! Yesterday, I heard Raynor say that he already felt close to advancing. Therefore, my progress can\u2019t lag behind too much!\u201dLeylin hurriedly walked into Kroft\u2019s experiment lab.\u201cLeylin, do you have more problems with the brewing of the Strength Potion?\u201d Kroft could clearly feel that his apprentice was different today.\u201cNo, Sir!\u201d Leylin inhaled deeply, \u201cI have already succeeded once last night!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The beaker in Kroft hands trembled, \u201cAlthough your talent in Potioneering has exceeded my expectations, the brewing of a Strength Potion is not that easy!\u201dAfter half a year, Kroft was able to sense his apprentice\u2019s frightening improvement after being questioned so much. However, he still felt that Leylin was still lacking in regards to brewing the Strength Potion successfully.Hearing this, Merlin\u2019s hand shook while he was concentrating on lowering a red crystal bead into a test tube. Black smoke emitted from the test tube and Merlin sighed, turning his attention over here.As for Bicky, she just leaned over directly.\u201cDid you bring the completed potion?\u201d Kroft asked.\u201cIt\u2019s in here!\u201d Leylin took out a blue-coloured test tube and handed it to the professor.Kroft unplugged the wooden stopper and took a sniff. His face revealed a startled expression.He then poured a drop on his finger. A fine, milky-white light extended from between his brows and directly pierced the droplet, making it shake.Kroft closed his eyes, his brows furrowed and soon relaxed.\u201cThe purification of the Blood Vitality Fruit was not bad, but too much was added at the end. There was also some problem with your usage of Spiritual Force, which damaged the chemical properties\u2026\u2026All in all, there are quite a few problems, but you have succeeded as a whole! Congratulations!\u201dKroft smiled jubilantly.Hearing this, Leylin also smiled, and Bicky even cheered, giving Leylin a warm hug.The fiery hot curves of this girl attached themselves onto Leylin\u2019s chest, which gave rise to a peculiar feeling in his heart.\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Merlin walked over too.\u201cCompared to Senior Merlin, I still have much to learn!\u201d Leylin let go of Bicky, and hurriedly said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be too humble, compared to Merlin, your resources are lacking. I guarantee that you would have been able to brew your first potion in 3 to 4 months otherwise. In Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, this talent can already be considered excellent!\u201d Kroft exclaimed.\u201cThinking back now, I am really lucky. First, I accepted Merlin, who has talent in Potioneering, as my apprentice. And now, I have you!\u201d Kroft exclaimed.\u201cSir, I will also work hard!\u201d Bicky clenched her small fists and returned to her experiment table.\u201cFinish preparing the Monkey Headed Mushrooms in your hands first, before you say anything else!\u201d Kroft\u2019s face turned stiff.After that, he returned the Strength Potion to Leylin, \u201cThis time, luck played an important factor in brewing the Strength Potion. What you have to do next is to remember how it felt when you first succeeded, and then practice more. This test tube can also be sold and exchanged for more resources!\u201dKroft seemed to be reminding him, \u201cLeylin, you must remember. Different potions have different challenges for Potioneering Masters. Although you are able to brew this Strength Potion right now, you would most likely revert back to a newbie if you were to replace it with a Hemostatic Potion. Therefore, do not be arrogant. From now on, focus on practicing your potion brewing!\u201d\u201cI will!\u201d Leylin pocketed the Strength Potion well, and promised solemnly.After he finished his tasks in the experiment lab, Leylin left together with Bicky.\u201cShall we go to the second level dining hall to feast, to commemorate your first success?\u201d Bicky ran in front and twirled around a few times, as if she was a lively butterfly.\u201cOf course! It is my honour to invite a beautiful lady to a meal!\u201d Leylin bowed slightly, a gentleman\u2019s propriety.\u201cHehe!\u201d Bicky covered her mouth and laughed adorably, and then her expression darkened, \u201cIf only\u2026\u2026If only he was like you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Your Senior Fayle is ignoring you again?\u201dLeylin knew a little about this matter. In this half year, Bicky gradually got closer to Fayle and finally became friends with him, but they were only normal friends.As for Fayle, he was constantly studying and practicing, and taking risks outside the academy. He was always surrounded by beautiful girls, so he did not think much of Bicky and was a little standoffish.\u201cIt\u2019s not that! Fayle just has a very important experiment coming up and is in the midst of collecting resources, so he\u2019s very busy\u2026\u2026\u201d Bicky lowered her head and kicked a pebble off the sidewalk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No wonder you are still a Level 1 Acolyte! Otherwise, with your aptitude, you should have advanced to the next level long ago!\u201dBicky belonged to a small Magus Family. Although small in size, they were still capable of obtaining the occasional resources and Magic Crystals. As for Bicky, the one whom the family placed all its hopes on, she was naturally given a fixed share each month.Her aptitude was not bad, and she had arrived earlier than Leylin by a year. By right, she should have been promoted to a Level 2 Acolyte long ago. However, she was still a Level 1 Acolyte, and even Leylin had nearly caught up to her.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not like that!\u201d Bicky hurriedly shook her head.Seeing Bicky\u2019s expression, Leylin slowly shook his head. \u00a0\u201cForget it! I can\u2019t really do anything for you regarding this matter\u2026 However, you must remember to be more careful!\u201dLeylin hinted.\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s go to the dining hall on the second floor!! I hear that the honey-flavoured cake there isn\u2019t bad\u2026\u2026\u201d Bicky smiled, and it was obvious she did not want to talk about this topic anymore.The second level dining hall was a special place. Contrary to the third level cafeteria where the food was served for free, the service here had to be paid for in Magic Crystals.It was the first time Leylin had come here. After ordering two honey-flavoured cakes, a beef steak, two fruit juices, and the flesh of a Uni-horned Lizard, the total came up to \u00a01 Magic Crystal and made Leylin feel a pang in his heart.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that if the flesh of these lizards is specially prepared, it is very beneficial for a Magus\u2019s meditation, so I must try it today!\u201dLeylin used a knife to slice off a part of the lizard meat, picked the meat up with a fork, and placed it into his mouth. He instantly felt the fragrant flavour of the meat spread throughout his taste buds, and Leylin\u2019s eyes lit up in wonderment.[Beep! An ingredient with a beneficial effect on the Host\u2019s body has been detected! Result: Mild increase in meditation. Hint: requires 10 continuous days of consumption for an obvious increase in effect!]\u201cI\u2026\u2026 \u201c Leylin was speechless. \u201cIt\u2019s such a splendid item, but how could I have that many Magic Crystals? I can only eat it for its flavour!\u201dOn the other side, Bicky was very happily eating the honey-flavoured cake.After their meal, Leylin bade farewell to Bicky and went to the Trading Post.Leyin had very few Magic Crystals to begin with, but now he planned to sell the Strength Potion. With Kroft\u2019s approval, he could earn Magic Crystals by brewing and selling more Strength Potions.After walking past the chaotic stalls, Leylin arrived at Woox\u2019s stall, the stall he had bought potion ingredients from during his first visit to this place.\u201cLeylin! It\u2019s you again! You have spent dozens of Magic Crystals this half year! Haven\u2019t you given up yet?\u201d Woox was still as fat as ever.\u201cPotioneering is such an enchanting skill, I cannot bear to give it up!\u201d Leylin said, half-jokingly.\u201cHowever, today I am here not just to buy ingredients,\u201d Leylin said as he handed the Strength Potion over to fatty Woox, \u201cLook at this!\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d Woox gaped, \u201cYou\u2019ve succeeded?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Leylin smiled lightly.What Woox did next was to make a thorough inspection, and after ensuring that it was indeed an authentic Strength Potion, his eyes \u00a0almost seemed to glow.\u201cOver a hundred times! You have only attempted it around a hundred times and yet you\u2019ve succeeded in brewing a Strength Potion! This talent\u2026\u2026This talent is only slightly inferior to Merlin\u2019s!\u201dMost of the ingredients were sold to Leylin by Woox, so he was able to deduce Leylin\u2019s talent very quickly.\u201cAs if! This is due to Mentor Kroft\u2019s guidance!\u201d Leylin said bashfully.\u201cOh! It\u2019s Kroft again, he already has such a talented student like Merlin, why did they send yet another gifted student to him?\u201dThe fatty slapped his forehead and let out a shrill voice, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you consider changing mentors? \u00a0My mentor, Wranke, is also a professor who is adept in Potioneering\u2026\u2026He will definitely like you!\u201d\u201cMy apologies! I have never considered changing at all!\u201d Leylin hurriedly rejected the offer. Kroft treated him rather well, and he would surely incur the wrath of the Magus if he changed mentors on a whim. He simply did not want to take that \u00a0risk.\u201cWhat a pity\u2026\u2026\u201d The fatty shook his head, he clearly knew that he had been grasping at straws.\u201cAlright! I will be able to give you 4 Magic Crystals for this Strength Potion, how about it?\u201d The fatty asked.Although the Strength Potion was priced at 5 Magic Crystals, 4 Magic Crystals was a reasonable price when considering the profit that was to be made by the stall.\u201cIt\u2019s a fair deal, exchange the Magic Crystals for more ingredients for the Strength Potion!\u201d\u201cAlright! If you wish to sell any more Strength Potions in the future, I will buy them all at the price of 4 Magic Crystals per potion!\u201d Woox\u2019s eyes flashed.An acolyte with a Potioneering talent that was slightly lower than Merlin\u2019s was akin to a Magic Crystal mine that had yet to be excavated.\u201cDefinitely! To a good partnership!\u201dLeylin and Woox shook hands, and after collecting four black boxes, he walked out from the hut.\u201cLook quickly! Fresh Mountain Cat eyeballs! This is an item that will greatly benefit your meditation!\u2019\u201cExquisite cross blades, as well as military crossbows. All imported from the Deep Blue Kingdom!\u201d\u201cFeathers of a flamingo! A precious ingredient for experiments, only 5 Magic Crystals!\u2019Here and there, various acolytes were promoting their wares. Leylin saw a black-robed acolyte holding up a huge 5 coloured feather and advertising continuously, which obviously attracted a huge crowd.\u201cA.I Chip! Scan the feather!\u201d[Beep! Comparing to databank! Similarity level: Mynah\u2019s tail feathers 83%, homegrown peacock 64%, sharp-beaked crane 34%]Leylin looked at the acolyte who was still advertising his goods and was speechless. Flamingo feathers are rare, but the 3 bird feathers that the A.I Chip detected were so common that acolytes wouldn\u2019t bother to pick them up if they fell to the ground. Obviously, it was a scam.This situation was rather common in such stalls. Although goods are rather good, the counterfeit goods are also aplenty. Hence, Leylin always bought from the wooden huts in the centre area.Moreover, acolytes are sharp, and the chances of finding a cheap yet good item in the stalls and striking big are the same as finding the remnants of dead Magi.Leylin shook his head and left the Trading Post.Three days later, Leylin was in his dorm, looking at sixteen test tube lined up properly on his table, deep in thought.Right now, his success rate for brewing a Strength Potion is almost at the same level at Kroft at 40%. However, he would be seeking trouble if he were to sell them all at once!\u201cRight now I am only able to put on a front and earn just a little, so at most it will be 2 test tubes! As for the rest, I will have to stow them away.Leylin sighed and placed 2 test tube in the purse hanging around his waist, and then stowed the remaining 14 test tubes in the empty space under his bed.\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sell huge amounts within the academy, so I had better find some other way outside. The best scenario would be a black market; I hear prices there are higher too!\u201d\u201cThe outside world is dangerous; I must become a Level 2 Acolyte before going out!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s next, I can use the Magic Crystals I earned from selling potions to buy higher tiered knowledge from Kroft, and expedite my break through to Level 2 Acolyte!\u201d\u201cAfter becoming a Level 2 Acolyte, I can attempt to practice magic spells, and take a mission outside to see if I can find ways to sell the potions\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin pondered, and then asked, \u201cA.I Chip, bring forth my current stats!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 1 Acolyte. Strength: 2.1, Agility: 2.3, Vitality: 2.5, Status: Healthy]\u201cAfter such a long period of meditation, my Vitality has increased the most. As for Strength and Agility, they have increased a little too. As for my Spiritual Force?\u201d Leylin looked at the data in front of him and his brows furrowed.\u201cA.I Chip, are you able to convert my Spiritual Force into data and display it?\u201d[Data is insufficient. Information for Spiritual Force is being collated.] The A.I Chip replied.\u201cWhen will it be ready?\u201d Leylin asked.[Estimated time: 155 Days 21 Hours]\u201cHalf a year, huh? It is close to when I advance to Level 2 Acolyte.\u201d Leylin nodded his head, \u201cI\u2019m not planning to leave in this next half a year, so it\u2019s no big deal!\u201dWhat followed next was that Leylin entered into a state of painstaking training.Apart from aiding Kroft in his daily experiments, he was brewing potions, exchanging them for Magic Crystals, and then purchasing more information.Besides brewing Strength Potions, he also bought the formulas for the Hemostasis Potion and some low leveled antidotes, and began to practice brewing them.With the A.I Chip, the success rate was not bad, but this fact was concealed by Leylin.During this period, Leylin also heard some bad news \u2013 Kaliweir\u2019s team had met with trouble on a mission. Not only had some been injured, others had also died. The acolyte who came with him in the same Dirigible, third-grade acolyte Hank, would forever be buried in the Abyssal Bone Marsh.Leylin was expecting a similar result, as a Level 1 Acolyte only has a small resistance to magic. It would be abnormal if they risked their lives and was free of injuries or loss of lives.After this incident, Kaliweir and his team seemed to face reality and started to be content with studying in the academy, not daring to take on any other missions.In the blink of an eye, Leylin grew a little taller and his face acquired a tinge of maturity.\u201cI am finally 14 too!\u201d Seeing that his palms had grown a little larger, he felt deeply moved.The Abyssal Bone Forest Academy seemed to have a spell formation regulating the temperature. Leylin always wore the grey robe for acolytes, but he never felt any stifling heat or frigidness.\u201cSir! I want to purchase the crystal ball with the magic spell formulas!\u201dLeylin stood in front of Kroft.\u201cOh! You want to begin learning Rank 0 spells?\u201d Kroft cusped the porcelain cup that was emitting steam and heat in his hand, and sipped from it.\u201cI have nearly finished constructing my mind runes, and there\u2019s only one more step needed before I advance to a Level 2 Acolyte. I wish to make some preparations for this beforehand!\u201dLeylin said warmly.\u201cBeing able to progress in both Potioneering and also meditation, I am very gratified!\u201d Kroft said, as he stole a glance at Bicky who was nearby.Bicky had only advanced into a Level 2 Acolyte two days ago, and never exhibited any extraordinary talents towards Potioneering. With her aptitude, this could be considered a slow pace.\u201cThe academy price for the basic model of magic spells is 30 Magic Crystals, I am able to give you a discount to 20 Magic Crystals!\u201d\u201cAlthough I could also give you this information for free, I want you to know that you will only achieve results with effort!\u201dKroft smiled lightly. This was the authority of the professors. They could give students favourable prices, or even give the information free of charge. It all depended on the mood of the professor. From this, it was obvious that Kroft approved of Leylin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will always remember the teachings of my mentor!\u201dLeylin hurriedly nodded his head and took out 20 Magic Crystals from the black pouch hung on his waist.20 black Magic Crystals fell onto the table and let off a dark luster.\u201cVery well! This is a crystal ball with the basic model of magic spells recorded on it. You can study it, but remember to only practice it after you have been promoted!\u201dKroft took a fist sized crystal ball off the wooden shelf at the side and handed it to Leylin. Golden words seemed to ripple inside it.Leylin stooped over to take it, and pocketed the crystal ball.These crystal balls were tools to record information in, and they could store more information than sheets of parchment. However, they could only be used once, and the information inside would fade away after someone viewed the contents, and hence, they were rather costly.Deep in the night, Leylin sat on the bed within his dorm and held the crystal ball in his hands.\u201cMagi have named the spells that acolytes are able to cast Rank 0 spells, to differentiate from the spells that Magi can cast.\u201cNo matter if they are a Level 2 Acolyte or Level 3 Acolyte, they are only able to use Rank 0 spells! Furthermore, they need to be first class Magi to be able to cast them without injury, and this is often a sign of becoming an official Magus!\u201d\u201cThe principle of magic spells models is to construct a model in your mind with your Spiritual Force. After that, you use the nature of your Spiritual Force to attract the external energy particles and transform them intricately, turning them into a spell!\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, the Spiritual Force is the primer, and the spell model is the catalyst. The primer is always the same, but under the effect of different catalysts, different types of energy particles will be attracted to it to form a different spell!\u201dLeylin concluded, and put the crystal ball away.\u201cConstructing a spell model is a complicated matter. In addition, your Spiritual Force will be impaired once you fail and will need at least half a month to recover. This is a bottleneck that even fifth grade acolytes are unable to breakthrough with ease. However, I can minimise my failures with help from the A.I Chip!\u201d\u201cAfter advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte, I must construct a spell model and even buy the various spell models. This would be a big expense if not for my improvement in Potioneering; normal acolytes would have to risk their lives many times over before they earned enough Magic Crystals!\u201dFrom this, Leylin could discern the bloody price one must pay on the path of a Magus.Compared to the Magic Crystals earned by risking his life as a Level 1 Acolyte, he would earn more by selling potions.\u201cMonopolising the market will yield the greatest profits!\u201d\u201cAll these are none of my concern, what I have to do now is to advance to a Level 2 Acolyte!\u201dA Level 1 Acolyte could only store a slight amount of energy particles in their body and have a basic magic resistance. However, their usage of energy particles is rather shallow, and hence they are unable to cast magic.As for a Level 2 Acolyte, the greatest difference is that they are able to cast Rank 0 spells.A Rank 0 spell that is amplified by the spell\u2019s model will have a greater destructive effect compared to the simple usage of energy particles.\u201cI have almost finished with the construction of my 24 mind runes. Tonight, I will advance to a Level 2 Acolyte!\u201dThere was resolve on Leylin\u2019s face.One night passed.In the dorm, Leylin opened his eyes.\u201cI have finally advanced to a Level 2 Acolyte! I can sense that the energy particles in my body have increased several times more than when compared to a Level 1 Acolyte!\u201d[Beep! Spiritual Force can now be represented in figures, proceed with conversion?] At this moment, the voice of the A.I Chip sounded.\u201cHm? It seems to be two days faster than expected! What happened?\u201d[The Spiritual Force of the Host has increased and there is an unknown effect on the A.I Chip. Processing speed has increased!]A screen was projected by the A.I Chip, and it was littered with many curved lines and numbers. From this, one could see that the processing ability of the A.I Chip had been raised last night.\u201cIt seems like the A.I Chip has indeed undergone some qualitative changes after transcending worlds. Now that it has fused with my soul, the increase in Spiritual Force when my soul became more powerful has indirectly affected the A.I Chip!\u201dLeylin\u2019s guessed that the subject of souls was the most unfathomable. Although Abyssal Bone Forest Academy claimed to be a pioneer in this area, they only managed to experience and grasp a few behaviours and patterns of the ectoplasmic beings. Moreover, only an official Magus was qualified to browse this information. For Leylin, it was still a long journey ahead.\u201cMy A.I Chip having the ability to represent my Spiritual Force in numbers is also a good thing. Bring out my current stats!\u201d[Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte. Strength: 2.2, Agility: 2.4, Vitality: 2.7, Spiritual Force: 4.1, Status: Healthy]The A.I Chip projected a 3D image in front of Leylin eyes and displayed his stats.\u201cThe Spiritual Force can finally be shown in numbers. My Spiritual Force stat is almost equivalent to that of 4 people combined?\u201dLeylin looked at the image and asked, \u201cA.I Chip! Investigate the reason for the decreased growth after advancing to a Level 2 Acolyte!\u201d[Mission establishing, inspection in process!][Reason discovered: The Host has more resistance!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cAs expected! Using radiation to increase my stats has its limits! I wonder what methods those official Magi used to strengthen their bodies?\u201dLeylin touched his chin.There was also a small district between the Academic Area and the Trading Post. It was where the academy sold higher-levelled goods. Although the items had set standards, they were more expensive. The service of the staff was also bad and they were extremely cold.Leylin came to the front of a counter. Behind the glass casing was a grave looking old lady who wore a deadpanned expression as if Leylin owed her a lot of Magic Crystals.\u201cSorry to bother you!\u201d Leylin bowed slightly. He could sense the energy waves of a Level 3 Acolyte radiating from this old lady.\u201cA.I Chip! Inspect!\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The old lady\u2019s voice sounded. It contained a gloomy and chilly air, like a cold, glossy fish scale, and gave people goose bumps.[Beep! Name: Unknown. Strength: 2.0, Agility: 2.1, Vitality: 3.5, Spiritual Force: 7.6, Status: Healthy ]With the A.I Chip providing the information, he confirmed that this old lady was indeed a Level 3 Acolyte, but her Spiritual Force was rather low, as if she had been injured before. However, it was still a piece of cake for her to deal with Leylin.\u201cThe A.I Chip can already inspect the stats of the acolytes and other living organisms. It just cannot get past the defensive abilities of a Magus still!\u201dLeylin mustered the best smile he had, \u201cWould you let me have a look at the basic spell models?\u201d\u201cTake it!\u201d The old lady flung a dusty large book over to him and did not seem even slightly bothered about whether he was going to buy it or not.\u201cI\u2019m not angry! I\u2019m not angry!\u201d Leylin psyched himself and opened the book.A spell model and the corresponding introduction appeared in his vision.\u201cSecondary Energy Fireball. Description: Summon a formidable fireball to attack your enemies. Prerequisite courses: Foundations of Negative Energy, Construction of Spell Models.\u201d\u201cShadow Sphere. Description: Use Shadow Energy to construct a fairly covert sphere. Prerequisite courses: Necromancy Studies, Transfiguration.\u201d\u201cAcidic Aqua Shot. Description: Create an acidic ball with immense corrosive properties. Able to correct the trajectory slightly. Prerequisite courses: Foundations of Negative Energy, Psychology.\u201d\u201cUmbra\u2019s Hand. Description: Ability to use Negative Energy to form a concealed palm in the shadows for attacking. Extremely covert. Prerequisite courses: Shadow Studies, Basic Evocation.\u201cAll of these are the most basic spells, are there any that could be advanced further?\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cNone! We only provide the basic spell types here. As for the rest, get them from your mentor!\u201d\u201cGive me the spell model for Acidic Aqua Shot and Umbra\u2019s Hand!\u201d Leylin inhaled deeply.\u201cOne will cost 10 Magic Crystals!\u201d The old lady seemed to be annoyed.After handing over 20 Magic Crystals to the lady, Leylin obtained two thick books made of parchment paper. \u2018Umbra\u2019s Hand\u2019 was written on the cover of the top book, in the Byron language.This counter was obviously constructed in a manner that let the sales staff always sit in a taller position than the customers. Leylin was a little pissed off at having to look up at the old lady.He carried the two books and turned around, not wanting to stay for a moment longer.\u201cLeylin!\u201d On the way back, a voice sounded and Leylin halted in his footsteps.A male wearing leather armour ran over, \u201cEarlier, I saw a silhouette of someone who looked like you, and it was indeed you. We haven\u2019t met for a long time!\u201dKaliweir greeted.The leather armour he wore was rather damaged and looked rather pitiful as it was not repaired.\u201cYou are\u2026\u2026 Buying spell models? Have you advanced to a Level 2 Acolyte?\u201d Kaliweir looked at Leylin who was holding the two spell books, seemingly startled.\u201cYeah! I have just advanced! So I bought them to learn from!\u201d Leylin answered.\u201cA.I Chip, inspect Kaliweir!\u201d[Beep! Kaliweir. Strength: 2.6, Agility: 2.8, Vitality: 3.1, Spiritual Force: 4.1, Assessment: Level 2 Acolyte]\u201cIt seems like Kaliweir advanced not long before I did, this data shows the stats of an acolyte who had just advanced!\u201dLeylin evaluated secretly.Ever since the previous incident, our team has taken up very few missions. Raynor has also advanced to a Level 2 Acolyte recently and wanted to try learning a spell model. It\u2019s a pity that he has yet to pass a few basic theory lessons after failing them several times\u2026\u2026\u201dKaliweir placed his hands in his pocket, obviously wanting to look cooler.After sizing up Leylin\u2019s new grey robes, he said, \u201cYou are indeed worthy of being a Potioneering student, having so much money!\u201dLeylin smiled. Not only do the grey robes of the acolytes have spells which remove stains, the fabric was also good. The defensive capabilities could be comparable to leather armour so the price was rather hefty. Many acolytes did not have the capability to buy another after damaging their set of robes.However, Leylin was different; he even had two more sets stored in his wardrobe.Recently, my success rate has increased a little and I earned more Magic Crystals. However, after buying the spell models, I have spent them all again!\u201d Leylin put on a helpless expression.\u201cYeah! Each and every cost in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is too high!\u201d Kaliweir\u2019s expression was not too good. He came from a first-class noble family in the Chernobyl Islands, but he discovered he was actually extremely broke when he got here.\u201cSpeaking of this, after we have all advanced to Level 2 Acolytes and mastered our spells, shall we all take up a mission?\u201dLeylin asked.\u201cReally? That would be great!\u201d Kaliweir was extremely gleeful. It seemed as though he had been considering it for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone also knew each other beforehand which was naturally better than being with an unfamiliar group of people.Furthermore, Kaliweir has undergone a long period of arduous training and has learnt a lot. Since he could be considered to have an abundant of experience, Leylin was more at ease with his team.\u201cWhen I master the spell model, my plan is to follow Kaliweir and his team on a mission and accumulate some experience. After that, I\u2019ll leave the academy on my own and seek alternative ways\u2026\u2026\u201dReturning back to his dorm, Leylin picked up the Umbra\u2019s Hand spell book.The yellow cover of the spell book was extremely sturdy like leather, and there were some patterns on it which sent an icy cold feeling from Leylin\u2019s fingertips into his body.The book was tightly bound by a metal chain and the ends were clipped in the fashion of a belt.\u201cLearning the Umbra\u2019s Hand requires research in Shadow energy and Evocation. I\u2019ve learned both long ago!\u201dVia selling potions, Leylin continuously improved his knowledge by acquiring advanced information on the Shadow element and studying them.\u201cThe incantation for opening it \u2013 Mansidala!\u201d Leylin spoke in a low voice.After hearing the incantation, the book suddenly trembled and, amidst the trembling, the black chains automatically untied by themselves and the pages started to flip through.\u201cA.I Chip, begin recording the information!\u201dLeylin continuously looked at the spell book containing the model of Umbra\u2019s Hand. Only after quickly flipping through it once and hearing the notification from the A.I Chip that it had fully recorded the content, did he put the book down.\u201cThe construction of a spell model is the foundation for a Magus to cast spells. This process includes a series of complex variation as well as the precise construction of the spell model itself. To learn a spell, 3 months is needed at the very least!\u201dAs he learned of the difficulty for a Magus to cast spells, Leylin sighed. Without the A.I Chip, he could only learn to cast spells after countless attempts and failures.[The recording of data is finished, beginning analysis!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d[Estimated time taken: 106 Hours 32 Minutes!]\u201c106 Hours 32 Minutes! That is the equivalent of four to five days, this speed is extremely fast!\u201d Leylin nodded his head.He stood up, patted his body, and placed the two spell books away neatly.He then walked to one side of his dorm. Originally, this section was utilized for reception or other uses but Leylin changed it into a mini experiment lab for potion brewing.Although it was rather dangerous to experiment here, with the A.I Chip he could guarantee that nothing would go wrong.\u201cI\u2019m going on a mission in a few months\u2019 time! I better focus on brewing a few potions as preventive measures for sudden events!\u201dLeylin lit a candle and begun his potion brewing.The education system in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was rather loose. From what Leylin saw, it was most similar to the ancient times of one teacher to one student.The academy was only providing land and the most basic of services. As for everything else, like acquiring advanced information, one had to learn from a professor, the chances of which were very slim.Moreover, there weren\u2019t any compulsory missions that one must take on. As long as a person could pay the school fees and did not meet a bad professor, one could normally stay here for 5 years!Of course, when there was no motivation, one\u2019s power would lessen as they did not seek to improve. At least in Leylin\u2019s case, he had not come across such a wonderful thing like receiving a few pieces of Magic Crystals each month for free.To obtain Magic Crystals, one could only take up a mission and go outside of the academy using their life to fight for them!The world of Magus has always upheld the principles of fair trade.In the following dozen days or so, Leylin devoted his time to analyzing the spell models and purchasing items like grains and nutrients for the mission he was going to take up.One afternoon, Leylin came to the Spell Experimenting Area.\u201cThe Spell Experimenting Area is a place that the academy has specially set up for acolytes and Magi to test the prowess of their spells. After all, various spells have immense might and there is also the problem of radiation. If the experiments are not managed properly the academy will be blown to bits!\u201dThe Spell Experimenting Area was located on the left-most of the academy, a remote area.The surrounding white marble rock walls were stacked neatly and seemed to be extremely sturdy.Various runes were written on these walls, two of which Leylin recognized. One was for the isolation of radiation contamination, and the other was for reinforcing the walls.\u201cAre you going to test your spells?\u201d Leylin walked to a counter where a big, bald guy smiled jovially at him asking.\u201cYes, I would like to. Are there any places for me to do so?\u201d\u201cWe have two large areas designated for the acolytes and Magi. You are only allowed to enter the area for acolytes and, within that area, space is divided into shared and single rooms. Shared rooms mean experimenting with your spells alongside another person. There might be interruptions caused by this but, it is inexpensive. As for single rooms, the fees are much more costly!\u201d\u201cWhat are the rates for a single room?\u201d Leylin asked.The baldy\u2019s eyes shone since it was obvious that there was a promising client here, \u201cThree hours for 1 Magic Crystal. Our single rooms even have specialised measuring devices which can calculate and report the might of your spells. Furthermore, we have\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s absolutely worth it!\u201d\u201cGive me one!\u201d Leylin handed over a Magic Crystal to the big guy.\u201cAlright! Please hold on!\u201d The big guy registered him quickly and handed back a black crystal-like item.\u201cThis is your room card! Number 32!\u201dLeylin nodded his head and entered the Spell Experimenting Area.On both sides, the runes on the white marbles glowed with a sparkling light. Some of the rooms obviously had occupants, but there were no sounds coming out from them and only the sound of Leylin\u2019s footsteps could be heard the corridor.\u201cAs expected! The noise isolation is really effective!\u201dLeylin nodded his head and, after locating his own room, swiped the black crystal on a black platform right outside the door!*Ka-cha!* The door opened and a mechanical female voice sounded, \u201cWelcome! You have three hours; please notice the allocation\u2026\u2026\u201dThe interior of the room was huge! The area was similar in size to a basketball court from Leylin\u2019s previous life.In the middle were a few human shaped targets wearing leather armour, metal armour and fur.To the far right, there was a screen on the wall and below it was the instructions on how to operate it.\u2013 A Magus can attack a target with a spell, and the screen will automatically record the power of the spell. \u2013\u201cThe facilities here are very advanced and seem to have an intelligence of their own. However, it\u2019s a pity that it is formed by magic, a different route from what my previous world took!\u201d Leylin exclaimed silently.\u201cLet\u2019s try with a physical attack first!\u201dLeylin\u2019s muscles on his right arm bulged as he walked to the front of a white coloured target wearing leather armour.* Bang !* Leylin moved and, with a low voice, he shouted and punched the middle of the leather armour, leaving a faint trace of an impression.The screen on the right flickered, and a few words appeared.\u201cClassification: Physical Attack. Degree of power: 2. Damage to target: Minimal.\u201d\u201cIt seems like these targets aren\u2019t made of common materials!\u201d Leylin muttered to himself.\u201cDegree of power\u201d is the official standard that Magi use to measure the extent of their might. A single unit, as a standard, is equivalent to the energy that can be completely released by 1 gram of Magic Crystal.\u201cThis method of measurement isn\u2019t bad. A.I Chip, in the future you can increase the content regarding this area!\u201d[Recording is done, defragmenting in process!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cHa!\u201d Leylin pulled out the cross blade hanging on his waist and brought about a strong gale as he viciously cut down.* Qiang! * A gap split opened on the leather armour revealing the white coloured wound beneath.\u201cClassification: Physical Attack. Degree of power: 3. Damage to target: Slight.\u201dSeeing the screen, Leylin nodded his head, \u201cI used all my might to cut down with the cross blade earlier but it only gave this kind of damage to the target! It seems like I can put my mind at ease and learn magic!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip, transmit the 2 spell models over!\u201d After this period of continuous research, the A.I Chip had already analysed the 2 spells completely. The last step was to transmit the information into Leylin\u2019s hippocampus which would then enable him to grasp these two Rank 0 spells immediately.[Editor Note: Hippocampus(simplified) \u2013 Memory recall area in the brain][Beep! Transmitting in progress!] With the A.I Chip\u2019s mechanical voice replying, Leylin felt a lot of memories regarding the techniques and procedures of casting these 2 spells surfacing in his mind.Every step felt extremely familiar. It was as if they were personally practiced by him countless of times.\u201cBring out the data of these 2 Rank 0 spells!\u201d\u201cAcidic Aqua Shot: Rank 0 spell. Casting time: 3 seconds. Effective distance: 7 Metres. Consumption: 2 Spiritual Force, 2 Magic Power\u201d\u201cUmbra\u2019s Hand: Rank 0 spell. Casting time: 4 seconds. Effective distance: 10 Metres. Consumption: 2 Spiritual Force, 2 Magic Power\u201d\u201cMagic Power is the amount of energy particles that are stored within the body. It is limited by the upper limits of the Spiritual Force!\u201dTo cast a spell, one does not only need to use their Spiritual Force as a primer but must also understand that the Magic Power within their body will be consumed as well.Leylin suppressed his excited emotions, \u201cA.I Chip, Record in detail my spell casting process !\u201d\u201cPandora \u2013 Graygonger!\u201dWith the Byron language\u2019s incantation sounding from Leylin, a ball of dark green liquid suddenly appeared at the upper area of his right hand. White bubbles continuously frothed outside of it.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Leylin flung the acidic ball in his hand and the green liquid streaked across in an arc, landing on a target wearing leather armour.* Ssssii! Ssssii! *The corrosion of the physical target sounded nonstop as it continuously dissolved while emitting a huge amount of white smoke. At the same time, an odor that pricks at the sense of smell wafted in all directions.After a few seconds, the human target had been corroded, leaving only a pair of white legs behind.\u201cA.I Chip, estimate the degree of power!\u201d[Beep! Degree of power: 5]Leylin turned to look at the screen at the right. At this moment, the words on the screen changed and a new record was shown.\u201cClassification: Magical Corrosive Attack. Degree of power: 5. Damage to target: Severe.\u201d\u201cEn! It seems like the A.I Chip and this screen have the same estimated values so I won\u2019t need to come here in future. I should be able to estimate the degree of power in my spells with the A.I Chip.\u201dLeylin nodded his head and begin experimenting with another spell.\u201cUmbra\u2019s Hand!\u201dFollowing Leylin\u2019s incantation, a black coloured hand suddenly appeared under a target which wore steel armour. It grabbed the target\u2019s throat forcefully and, with a crashing sound, the target\u2019s head fell onto the ground.\u201cClassification: Energy Attack. Degree of power: 4. Damage to target: Severe.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It also requires constant fine-tuning with Spiritual Force. As for Umbra\u2019s Hand, it is a little weaker, but it\u2019s extremely covert and is best used for a sneak attack!\u201d\u201cThese two spells have been chosen by me with utmost care. Not only do they satisfy my Dark elemental affinity, materials are not needed to cast them either, which is extremely convenient!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes suddenly flashed, \u201cA.I Chip, is it possible to optimise these two spells?\u201d[Beep! Affirmative! Consumption for optimisation: 19 Spiritual Force points, proceed or not?]\u201cDefinitely not! I don\u2019t want my Spiritual Force to be exhausted that quickly! Why does it require so much?\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression was a little unsightly.[Optimising Acidic Aqua Shot requires 9 Spiritual Force points. Requires advanced information: Farl\u2019s comprehensive collection of spells, Theory of missiles\u2026\u2026][Optimising Umbra\u2019s Hand requires 10 Spiritual Force points. Requires advanced information: Detailed Evocation Studies, Dark Energy Analysis\u2026\u2026]\u201cAlright, it seems like there is no hope for now!\u201dLeylin closed the screen, \u201cBesides, a simple spell already requires 2 points of Spiritual Force. I can barely use it a few times at present!\u201d\u201cA.I Chip, bring out my current stats and show it in a concrete manner!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte. Strength: 2.2, Agility: 2.4, Vitality: 2.7, Spiritual Force: 0.1(4.1), Magical Power: 0(4) \u2013 Magical Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force. Status: Healthy][Skills: Cross Blade Technique, Potioneering][Spells: Acidic Aqua Shot: Rank 0 spell. Casting time: 3 seconds. Effective distance: 7 Metres. Consumption: 2 Spiritual Force, 2 Magic Power][Umbra\u2019s Hand: Rank 0 spell. Casting time: 4 seconds. Effective distance: 10 Metres. Consumption: 2 Spiritual Force, 2 Magic Power]At Leylin\u2019s command, a 3D image of himself was projected, with various information appearing alongside him.\u201cIt is much clearer this way! The two spells fully consumed my Spiritual Force and Magical Power earlier, no wonder I feel a little dizzy now!\u201d Leylin rubbed his temples as they were hurting a little.\u201cWith this constraint of Spiritual Force and Magical Power, learning more spells is not feasible. What\u2019s left is for me to prepare a few more potions! If only I had a Magic Artifact, my strength would definitely have a significant increase\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the academy, the Mission Area.There were all sorts of acolytes gathered here, and most of them had gloomy expressions. Their bodies also reeked of blood and held traces of injuries.Occasionally, a few grey-robed acolytes who radiated strong magical energy would carry large monsters on their backs, garnering the envy and attention of others.In the centre of the Mission Area was a black coloured rock wall, where various missions were arranged.Green-coloured words glowed against the black wall, and it looked a little eerie.Among the many missions, some were written in blood red and gave off an ominous feeling. Most of the missions listed were dangerous, but the rewards were also better.In the corner of the square, a few people stood around patiently as if they were waiting for someone.\u201cLeylin hasn\u2019t arrived yet?\u201dRaynor crossed his arms in front of his chest, seemingly a little bored.\u201cIt isn\u2019t the designated time yet, what are you in a hurry for? Since he already agreed, he will definitely be here.\u201d Kaliweir replied as he polished a black cleaver, the smooth blade stained with traces of blood.\u201cLeylin? Are you talking about that Potioneering acolyte, Leylin?\u201d A green-haired girl\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cIt is said that his Potioneering talent is only second to Merlin. Furthermore, he has already begun to brew potions and earn a huge amount of money, why would he still want to join our team?\u201d\u201cHe originally came from the same area as us, so it\u2019s only natural to join us for missions!\u201d Raynor laughed.\u201cThen you guys must definitely introduce him to us later. If we are able to approach an acolyte who knows Potioneering, we might not need to risk our lives on missions in the future anymore!\u201d A red-haired girl laughed heartily. Her body was extremely voluptuous.Raynor\u2019s eyes unconsciously scanned over this girl\u2019s perky chest, and then he suddenly felt parched.\u201cMy apologies! I\u2019m late!\u201dLeylin wore leather armour with his robes on the outside, which looked a little bulky. A Cross Blade hung down on his waist, and a crossbow was slung on his back together with a large black sack.\u201cWe have just arrived too!\u201d Kaliweir sheathed his cleaver and smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s just us five?\u201d Leylin looked at the group. He recognised Kaliweir and Raynor, but did not see Beirut and the rest.\u201cBeirut and the others are third-grade acolytes, but they have not advanced to Level 2 Acolyte yet. They only have a bit of resistance to magic spells, so the outside is too dangerous for them. This is also our first time going out after the previous failure and I don\u2019t wish for any more casualties!\u201dKaliweir explained.Leylin suddenly understood. Although he was a third-grade acolyte, his talent was comparable to a fourth-grade acolyte with the A.I Chip\u2019s help, and he might even surpass them in learning spells.Beirut and the others were only in the Level 1 Acolyte range. Bringing them out was no help at all, and they might even be a burden. Hence keeping them within the academy was also good for them. It was realistic, yet cruel.\u201cCome! Let me make the introductions!\u201d Kaliweir smiled.\u201cThe green haired girl is Lilisse, and the one beside is Neela. They are both apprentices under my mentor and advanced to Level 2 Acolytes two months ago\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHello! Sir Leylin!\u201d Neela\u2019s eyes shone and she took the initiative to approach Leylin.\u201cIt is really lucky to be able to go on a mission with you this time!\u201d Neela stuck out her chest and spoke coquettishly in a very nasal pitch.Seeing this scene, Raynor looked elsewhere, his expression a little gloomy.\u201cI only have a little talent in Potioneering and I must even thank Mentor Kroft, it was him who\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin rubbed his nose. He knew that he only needed to reveal a bit of desire and this beautiful girl would pounce into his arms. However, he had been concentrating on cultivation lately and had very little wants in this aspect.Furthermore, after so many of his wild trysts in his previous world, to him, Neela was only a girl who was good looking.\u201cAlright, what are the contents of our mission?\u201d Leylin took the initiative and asked, interrupting what Neela was going to say next.\u201cAs this is our first time going on a mission together, I am preparing to take on the simplest one: patrolling the academy\u2019s perimeters and cleaning up a few Red-Eyed Ravens, what do you all think?\u201dIn fact, the four of them had discussed this before so Kaliweir was really only asking Leylin.\u201cAlright! My Rank 0 spells have not been fully grasped yet!\u201d Leylin agreed.This team of theirs was newly formed, so taking on a simple mission to improve their teamwork was within reason. From this, it could be seen that Kaliweir had matured a lot after Hank\u2019s death and his way of doing things was now better thought out.\u201cA.I Chip! Scan!\u201d Leylin commanded silently.[Beep! Raynor. Strength: 1.8, Agility: 1.9, Vitality: 2.5, Spiritual Force: 3.7. Status: Healthy][Lilisse. Strength: 1.9, Agility: 2.5, Vitality: 2.4, Spiritual Force: 4.3. Status: Healthy][Neela. Strength: 2.7, Agility: 3.4, Vitality: 2.9, Spiritual Force: 4.6. Status: Healthy]\u201cEver since the processing capability of the A.I Chip increased, its perceptive ability has also increased. Not including the Magi, all the acolytes in the academy right now are unable to escape the readings of the A.I Chip.\u201dLeylin thought silently. These readings must naturally prioritise not alarming the other party. As official Magi have a layer of force field around them constantly, the A.I Chip would definitely be discovered if it was to attempt to take readings of them.However, as long as regular acolytes are within Leylin\u2019s scope, their every stat will be read by the A.I Chip.\u201cFrom this data, everyone has indeed advanced into Level 2 Acolyte. However, I never thought that Neela was the strongest of them. It seems like this girl has also practiced the Knight\u2019s breathing technique. Her body and strength are not to be underestimated!\u201dThese few people had just advanced, and even if they had bought spell models before, they might not be able to comprehend it. Furthermore, the models have to be constructed in the mind, so they were definitely unfamiliar with it. After all, Rank 0 spells are still very dangerous to a Level 2 Acolyte. Without complete control of them, there is a chance of failing and even causing a backlash!Based on just their physical strengths, Neela could possibly defeat the three of them in one fell swoop if no one was to use any spells.This Neela, who seemed to be infatuated with and wanted to approach him, was actually the strongest out of the team of four. It was likely that even Kaliweir did not know of this. The corners of Leylin\u2019s lips arched into a smile.To be in full control of Rank 0 spells, regular Level 2 Acolytes must practice for at least 3 months to half a year. However, for him, he will learn the spell in a flash once the A.I Chip has completely analysed the spell model and transmitted it to his hippocampus.As for the might of any of the Rank 0 spells, they are not something the level of a Knight can resist. Perhaps Grand Knights have a slight chance at that.Obviously, Neela\u2019s data was only at the level of a Knight. Even if she had a secret technique, Leylin was not the slightest bit afraid.While Leylin had been taking the readings, Kaliweir had already run to the counter and accepted the patrolling mission.After the discussion with everyone, they set off and left the academy.Leylin\u2019s eyes could not help but squint as the piercing sunlight shone down.\u201cCome to think of it, I have already stayed underground for over a year. Now that I have come out, it does seem a bit like a thousand-year-old corpse rising from the ground again.Leylin used his hands to block the sunlight. His snow white hands were a sickly pale colour, like an ill person who lost too much blood. It was due to him staying underground the whole time and spending very little time basking in the sunlight reflected from the mosses in the gardens.Of course, most acolytes from the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy have this problem.In any case, as long as their strength increased and they used their Spiritual Force, raising a point of two of their Vitality was not a problem at all. Therefore, they did not need to go out everyday to bask in the sunlight.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Kaliweir took the lead.Looking at the huge graveyard behind them and the two statues of the protectors, Leylin turned his head and followed the rest of the team.\u201cWe are going to patrol the southwest area of the academy, where quite a few Red-Eyed Ravens have been showing up recently. We need to clean up their numbers, as well as a few other living organisms. Of course, all of the materials that we acquire will belong to us. Moreover, everyone receives a remuneration of 3 Magic Crystals.\u201dAfter the five of them walked out of the graveyard, Kaliweir picked a spot and took out a huge map and spoke as they crowded around.On the faint yellow parchment paper, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was located in the centre and occupied about ten percent of the total area.There were a few simple routes around it, and there were descriptions of the places written in black colour. A few dangerous places were also marked in red with warning signs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We met with some when we first arrived at the academy but they were easily killed off by Professor Dorotte. He used a spell that seemed similar to Acidic Aqua Shot.\u201d Leylin stroked his chin and recalled the scene of when he first entered the academy.\u201cWe had better hurry there and begin our patrolling. This mission requires us to bring back the right claws of 10 Red-Eyed Ravens as evidence of completing the mission\u2026\u2026Do you guys have any other questions?\u201dKaliweir ended with a question, displaying the bearings of a leader. After he saw Leylin and the others shake their heads, he continued and said: \u201cSince we are teammates, let us not hide anything from each other. Each of us should report our general strengths so the others can have a better understanding! I\u2019ll go first!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kaliweir, I have a Knight-level constitution and know a secret technique. I also know a Rank 0 spell!\u201d\u201cKaliweir, I never thought that you\u2019d have learned a spell already! It seems like you\u2019re ahead of me\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m Neela, I have Knight-level physical qualities and a secret technique. I am still learning the Rank 0 spell \u201cWeary Hand\u201d but I\u2019m unable to use it yet!\u201d While saying this, Neela looked at Kaliweir with a little surprise.\u201cI\u2019m Lilisse, I\u2026\u2026I am still training to be a Knight, but my instructor says my dart-throwing isn\u2019t bad. I don\u2019t know any secret techniques as of yet!\u201d Lilisse said shyly.\u201cRaynor, Preparatory Knight. I don\u2019t know any spells but my archery skills aren\u2019t bad!\u201d He never thought that Kaliweir and Neela would have already begun to learn spells and was a little embarrassed. Patting the wooden bow on his back, he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will not be a burden to all of you!\u201d\u201cLeylin, Preparatory Knight. Right now I have learnt a spell!\u201d Leylin rubbed his own nose.\u201cEven you have learnt a spell\u2026\u2026Oh! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Raynor said a little disconcertingly. He originally came together with Leylin so he knew that Leylin\u2019s aptitude was only a third grade acolyte. Never did he think that Leylin\u2019s accomplishments would already exceed his aptitude as a fourth grade acolyte.\u201cNo worries!\u201d Leylin shook his head and indicated that he did not mind it.In fact, Raynor\u2019s meditation efficacy was much faster than Leylin\u2019s. It was simply that he did not have enough Magic Crystals to exchange for information and other precious resources. Hence, he was gradually losing out to Leylin.\u201cYou are indeed worthy of being called \u2018Sir Leylin\u2019! You know what outsiders are calling you now?\u201d Neela said in admiration.\u201cOh? I don\u2019t mind hearing about how others are evaluating me!\u201d\u201cA Potioneering genius who is seen once every fifty years! If you did not already have a mentor, the other Potioneering professors would have invited you to be their apprentice!\u201d Neela\u2019s pitch was very high and sparks almost seemed to jump out of her eyes.Seeing Neela\u2019s fiery gaze, as well as the expressions of Lilisse and the others, Leylin smiled bitterly.To sell his potions faster, he could not help but take on the role of a Potioneering-genius acolyte. Fortunately, he had his senior Merlin to take the brunt of the attention off him. If not for this, the attention given to him would be much greater.\u201cOh right! Leylin, you should have enough resources if you always sell potions right? Why would you still need to come out?\u201dRaynor asked softly.\u201cAbout this? I felt bored being cooped up in the academy. Besides, I have just learnt a spell so I need to familiarise myself with it!\u201dLeylin\u2019s main purpose was to gain more experience and make preparations for travelling out alone to look for a black market in the future. However, such a thing could not be mentioned.\u201cAlright! Let the gossip end here! Our destination is not far away but it will take some trouble to get there! If we don\u2019t move out soon, the sky will turn dark!\u201dKaliweir pat his hands, picked up his cleaver and led the party.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Leylin followed behind.\u201cI want to walk with you!\u201d Neela walked by Leylin\u2019s side, not masking her intentions in the slightest.Lilisse followed next, with Raynor at the back.\u201cBe careful, the area near the school is vacant land, but now that we have entered the forest, there will be a lot more danger!\u201d Kaliweir continued walking as he reminded the party.Leylin did not bother with Neela who was beside him. Instead, he paid more attention to his surroundings while also maximising the A.I Chip\u2019s detection range.This was his first time coming into contact with the dangerous world outside of the academy so he could not help but be more alert.Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was built in the depths of a black forest and there was a forsaken graveyard on top of the school. There were only small shrubberies and short trees around the school so the danger was not that great. However, after entering the forest, the countless trees acted as natural camouflage. It had always been the hunting ground of many predators. Leylin could still recall that when they first arrived here, they met with a sneak attack.[Alert! Alert! An unknown creature is approaching. Threat to the Host\u2019s body: Mild!]As the A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded, light blue lines formed an image in Leylin\u2019s vision. From the projection, Leylin could very clearly see a red line snaking its way to them.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dA black shadow suddenly leapt out from the grass and viciously bit at Kaliweir\u2019s neck.Kaliweir\u2019s expression did not change as the black cleaver in his hands swung down, knocking the black shadow away.The black shadow fell on the ground and revealed its true appearance. It was a snake that was one metre in length, with faint traces of blood on its body and only one eye on its triangular head.\u201cThis is an Iron Thread One-Eyed Snake, be careful of its poison!\u201d Neela warned.Right at this moment, Lilisse, who was behind them, suddenly struck and three throwing knives were launched towards the beast.The Iron Thread One-Eyed Snake\u2019s body coiled to avoid two of the blades but the last one slashed at it as it passed, leaving a gash.\u201cHeh!\u201d Suddenly, Kaliweir ran forward and swung his black cleaver down on the snake\u2019s head. With a cold flash, the head of the snake was cut off instantly!The snake, which had lost its head, coiled in a circle, still bleeding profusely.\u201cAh!\u201d Lilisse was startled.\u201cIt\u2019s already dead. This is just a natural reaction for the body. Haven\u2019t you learned about neurology?\u201d Neela harrumphed.\u201cOnly the poison sac and the skin of this Iron Thread One-Eyed Snake is useful. Whoever wants to collect the materials better hurry and do so now. The blood will attract many other living organisms here!\u201d Kaliweir slowly spoke while putting away his cleaver.\u201cI will do it!\u201d Raynor stepped forward and, after a short while, the five of them continued on their journey.\u201cA.I Chip! Was the information from earlier recorded?\u201d[Beep! The recording is done! Iron Thread One-Eyed Snake, Snake type. Strength: 1.1, Agility: 2.1, Vitality: 1.6. The blood sample has been collected and the composition of muscle has been recorded!]The A.I Chip\u2019s feedback was timely. Leylin nodded his head and hastened his footsteps.Ten-odd days later, inside the black forest.A Red-Eyed Raven blinked its alert eyes and perched on a branch as it constantly ruffled its feathers.*Whoosh!* Suddenly, a white arrow was shot.\u201cCaw!\u201d the Raven flapped its wings to move away. While it was evading, there were another three flashes of white light, belonging to the throwing knives that were shooting towards it.Dodging in an elegant arc, the Red-Eyed Raven avoided the knives and landed in an open space.\u201cKill!\u201d A shadow hopped out from some shrubbery, two hands grasping a cleaver, and hacked towards the Red-Eyed Raven. It seemed like the arrow and the throwing knives earlier had all been there to force the Red-Eyed Raven to the ground.A black cleaver brought about a gale as it hacked at the Red-Eyed Raven.\u201cCaw Caw!\u201d The Red-Eyed Raven cawed loudly, letting off an unpleasant noise.There was a flash of human-like resentment in the raven\u2019s eyes and a pair of black claws met with the cleaver.*Clang!*Although the Red-Eyed Raven was a little larger than the average raven, it was only about the same size as a chicken. It had unexpectedly used its black claws to push back the Knight wielding the black cleaver.\u201cCaw!\u201d The Red-Eyed Raven cawed again, and a few black feathers drifted down from its body.Taking advantage of the retreating Knight, the Red-Eyed Raven actually went forward and clawed at the Knight\u2019s face with its sharp claws!\u201cPandora \u2013 Greygonger!\u201dA hurried and quick incantation sounded and a ball of green liquid flew out suddenly, hitting the Red-Eyed Raven squarely on its body.*Psshhh!* White mist rose continuously, and the cries of a Red-Eyed Raven sounded.A few seconds later, the screams from the Raven completely vanished, and all that was left was a ditch. Lying inside were a few feathers which did not have enough time to corrode.\u201cAre you alright, Kaliweir?!\u201dThe shrubbery shook and a few figures made their way through it.Kaliweir shook his head, \u201cNo worries! Although the Red-Eyed Raven has the strength of a Knight and can even fly, it is still not an opponent for us humans who wield weapons!\u201dLooking at the person in the middle, \u201cLeylin! The timing of the Acidic Aqua Shot earlier was good!\u201d\u201cIt was all due to everybody\u2019s teamwork!\u201d Leylin smiled.Kaliweir then walked to the large ditch, used a branch to brush away the feathers, and picked up 2 black claws from inside.The side of the black claws was extremely sharp. They released a chilling luster as if reflecting the difficulty of dealing with its original owner.\u201cAlthough the might of the Acidic Aqua Shot is great, it also corroded the Red-Eyed Raven greatly. Apart from its hard claws, there is nothing left\u2026\u2026\u201d Kaliweir said with a tinge of regret.\u201cHmph! If not for Leylin, you guys might have paid some kind of price to kill the Red-Eyed Raven!\u201d Neela harrumphed at the side, seemingly displeased.\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Kaliweir sheathed his cleaver. Right now he had matured a lot and knew that Neela was rather spiteful, so he was not angry at all.\u201cWith this Red-Eyed Raven, we have gathered enough materials. Should we head back to the school to complete the mission?\u201dSeeing that Raynor and the rest were looking tired, Kaliweir asked.\u201cNaturally, we have to go back! The forest is too dangerous. We couldn\u2019t even have a good sleep during the night!\u201d Neela said immediately.Lilisse and Raynor hurriedly nodded their heads too.As for Leylin, he also felt a little exhausted as the forest had been riddled with danger. Even though he had the A.I Chip to warn him, he was still in a heightened state of anxiety for a prolonged period. His mind felt extremely weary as well, and right now he was beginning to miss the hot water and bed in the academy.\u201cAlright! Then let us go back first!\u201dKaliweir was a little regretful as he carefully put away the claw of the Red-Eyed Raven, \u201cWhat a pity! With our abilities, we could definitely kill more of the Red-Eyed Ravens. They are worth much more money than the Iron Thread One-Eyed Snake from before\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no end to earning Magic Crystals but right now, our team, as a whole, is completely exhausted and we have reached a dangerous state. If we do not hurry back to the academy, I\u2019m afraid that we will make mistakes during our next hunt, which may even result in death!\u201dLeylin\u2019s voice was cold and distinct. He was a person who kept his cool at all times, and he wouldn\u2019t lose his bearings over a little profit dangling before him.\u201cAlright! Then let us go back!\u201dKaliweir only hesitated a little and then nodded his head in agreement.Hearing Kaliweir\u2019s words, the expressions of the other four turned much better. Even Neela, who was feeling spiteful, also loosened up and smiled brightly.The party packed up quickly and started on the trip home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayViolent Hilly BearThe chirping of insects could be heard in the quiet forest from time to time, and the lush branches and leaves of the trees covered the sun completely. Sunrays occasionally shone through the gaps like beams of light.\u201c Caw Caw!\u201d Familiar sounding cries could be heard ahead.Kaliweir, who was leading at the forefront, furrowed his brows, \u201cWhy are there so many Red-Eyed Ravens!? These creatures are very aggressive towards humans! If we do not clean their numbers up in time, they will attract more of their kind which will be extremely troublesome!\u201d\u201cWhat now? Should we take a detour?\u201d Raynor asked.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that might not work, they have already discovered us!\u201d Leylin looked at the image in the A.I Chip and said without looking back.The sound of wings flapping gradually got closer. Kaliweir laughed, \u201cSince they have voluntarily come to look for us, we shouldn\u2019t hesitate to welcome them!\u201dThe expressions of the others were at ease. After this period of polishing their teamwork, they all have a set of strategies that were customised to deal with the Red-Eyed Ravens.\u201cNot good! There are 2 of them!\u201d Leylin looked at the screen and his expression changed suddenly.Kaliweir was startled. As per Leylin\u2019s warning, there was indeed another black shadow behind the first Red-Eyed Raven that flew over, and its size seemed to be bigger than others of its kind.\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble!\u201d Kaliweir\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cLeylin and Neela, you two deal with the one in front! As for the other one, leave it to us three!\u201d\u201cPrepare well!\u201d Leylin said to Neela behind him, and drew the crossbow that was slung on his back.\u201cMeasuring wind power and humidity! Adjusting trajectory\u2026\u2026\u201d*Whoosh! * A black line streaked across the sky and pierced through the Red-Eyed Raven\u2019s body, bringing along a few feathers with it.\u201cCaw!\u201d The Red-Eyed Raven at the front let out an angry cry and flew towards Leylin.It actually seemed like it did not sustain any injuries.\u201cLet\u2019s lure it away!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression did not change, and he put down the crossbow that was in his hands.Thanks to the A.I Chip, he was very clear that the arrow earlier did hit the Red-Eyed Raven, but the vitality of these crows was rather high, being almost similar to a human Knight. Their feathers were extremely hard too; hence, it did not receive much damage.The weapons of regular humans do not pose much threat to the creatures of the Magus World.Seeing Leylin and Neela luring a Red-Eyed Raven away, Kaliweir made up his mind. He shouted loudly, \u201cRaynor and Lilisse, stall the other Red-Eyed Raven that is behind and give me time to prepare my spell.\u201dRaynor and Lilisse looked at each other, and then dashed towards the Red-Eyed Raven at the back.As Raynor ran, he grabbed the bow on his back and shot towards the sky. A few throwing knives accompanied the arrow.\u201cCaw Caw!\u201d The huge Red-Eyed Raven flapped its black wings, and slapped the arrow and knives down.\u201cIt actually used its bare wings to knocked the arrow away!\u201d Raynor\u2019s face turned pale and his footsteps halted.However, the Red-Eyed Raven that was significantly larger than its counterpart had already swooped down and its huge claws cut into Raynor\u2019s shoulders, leaving a gash.Raynor was pinned to the ground by the Red-Eyed Raven.\u201cSave\u2026\u2026Save me!\u201d Raynor shouted and pleaded.*Bang!!* Just as the Red-Eyed Raven was about to peck down, a bright light flashed. Lilisse raised a huge sword that was even larger than her and swatted the Red-Eyed Raven away.\u201cBam!\u201d An iron wire that was made into a net was thrown in front of Raynor.\u201cI\u2019ll stall it, hurry and take the chance to throw the net!\u201d Lilisse, who was usually quiet and a little shy, now seemed to be a completely different person.\u201cOkay!\u201d Raynor looked at Kaliweir, who was still preparing the cast his spell, and picked up the net.Lilisse had obviously trained with swordplay before, and the huge steel sword brandished in her hands turned into a silver flash as she knocked the Red-Eyed Raven away to the side.\u201cHa!\u201d With a beautiful sweep, Lilisse knocked the Red-Eyed Raven down onto the floor, making mud and grit splatter everywhere.\u201cA good chance!\u201d Raynor\u2019s eyes flashed, and the sharp pain transmitting through his shoulder made his eyes a little bloodshot as he spread the steel wire net and trapped the Red-Eyed Raven within it.\u201cCaw Caw!\u201d The Red-Eyed Raven continuously thrashed inside, and it seemed as though it would break free from the steel wire net at any moment.\u201cKaliweir, hurry!\u201d The Red-Eyed Raven\u2019s feathers are too thick, I can\u2019t deal much damage to it!\u201dLilisse shouted anxiously.\u201cThank you for your efforts!\u201d At this moment, Kaliweir finally finished his spell, and a dark red coloured fireball was blazing in his hands.\u201cHurry and move!\u201d After Kaliweir shouted, Lilisse and Raynor hurriedly scattered.\u201cLet\u2019s go! Negative Energy Fireball!\u201d With a fling of Kaliweir\u2019s hands, the dark red fireball streaked across with a booming sound until it landed perfectly on the Red-Eyed Raven\u2019s body.*Boom!* A huge sound reverberated continuously in all directions, along with a surging heat wave.The intense wind from the explosion also burned a huge crater in the ground, and the surrounding plants and shrubbery did not escape from it either.\u201cNice one!\u201d Raynor had run a little too slowly and was swept onto the ground by the wind behind him. His clothes were stained with mud. However, when he looked at the Red-Eyed Raven, he was indescribably happy.\u201cHaah\u2026\u2026\u201d Kaliweir panted too, \u201cThis Negative Energy Fireball takes too long to cast and I need someone to help me stall the enemy. However, its might is extremely great!\u201dLilisse straightened her fringe. As she looked towards the direction that Leylin and Neela had run in, there was an obvious tinge of worry in her eyes, \u201cI wonder how they are doing now?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Leylin and Neela are very strong, and we also managed to deal with the bigger one ourselves\u2026\u2026\u201d Kaliweir comforted her. This was the first mission that he had taken in a year, and he, too, wanted the perfect ending.\u201cWe\u2019re alright!\u201d Just as Kaliweir was speaking, both Leylin and Neela walked out from a thicket of bushes.A few black feathers clung to their bodies, but they did not seem to have sustained any injuries.\u201cWhere is the other one?\u201d\u201cOver here!\u201d Leylin raised the black claws in his hands, and then looked at the huge pit. \u201cWow this fellow. I reckon that had at least 6 degrees of power, it seems like Kaliweir is pursuing lethal spells.\u201cSince everyone is okay, let us hurry back, I have a bad feeling about this!\u201d Kaliweir\u2019s face darkened, \u201cThe monsters lurking around the school these days seem to be a little too much!\u201d\u201cI agree, were the academy missions before this dangerous?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cThat\u2019s not right! Even if we accepted a patrolling mission like this, we needed at least 1 month to find 10 Red-Eyed Ravens. However, we have exceeded that amount in just 10 days!\u201d Neela explained beside him.\u201cAfter we return, let us report this situation, I feel there\u2019s something amiss!\u201d Lilisse said suddenly.\u201cIf there are any problems it\u2019ll be for the Magi to solve! We had better leave here as soon as possible, I don\u2019t feel safe out here!\u201d Raynor added.\u201cNicely said! Let us hurry!\u201d Kaliweir said as he threw the broken iron wire net aside and picked up a black claw.As everyone did not have any objections, the team hurried back.\u201cWhy would these 2 Red-Eyed Ravens obstruct us on our return trip back to the academy? Could it just be a coincidence?\u201d Leylin suddenly felt uneasy and hastened his footsteps.The rest of them seemed to have the same ominous feeling, and the team hurried along.\u201cDo you think those 2 Red-Eyed Ravens earlier were guarding some treasures? You know, ravens have a habit of collecting shiny items!\u201dNeela, who was at the back of the group, saw the gloomy expressions on everyone and said half-jokingly.\u201cThose are normal ravens. Although the Red-Eyed Ravens also have raven in their name, their bloodlines are closer to that of a Bramble Thorny Bird. Therefore, they don\u2019t have the habit of searching for treasures, but instead have an acute sense for a few special plants. In fact, Magi often raise Bramble Thorny Birds too, to use them to search for those special plants!\u201d Leylin replied, not turning back.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Raynor was obviously not convinced.\u201cBramble Thorny Bird\u2019s origins and how to raise them. It\u2019s on the level 3 bookshelf in the library, I read it recently.\u201d Leylin replied blandly.\u201cOh! Leylin! You\u2019re so awesome!\u201d Sparks could be seen in Neela\u2019s eyes again.Raynor turned away.\u201cEh?\u201d Leylin took a sniff and suddenly smelled a very fragrant scent.\u201cStop! Did you guys smell anything?\u201d Leylin hurriedly halted.The group stopped. \u201cSmell what?\u201d Kaliweir\u2019s expression tightened, and he gripped the cleaver in his hands.\u201cI seem to have smelled a very fragrant scent!\u201d Leylin explained.\u201cFragrance? There are only odours that make people want to vomit in this forest! And now it is getting more serious!\u201d Raynor interrupted.\u201cI actually smelled a whiff of Jasmine Flowers mixed with Black-Oiled Roses!\u201d Lilisse wrinkled her nose.\u201cEveryone be careful! There is the stench of a wild beast!\u201d *Shiing!* Kaliweir unsheathed his cleaver. This situation was obviously strange. Leylin also placed his hands into his waist pouch.*Hu!* A gust of wind blew over. It carried a fishy stench that stung the nose.*Grooarrr!!!* The roar of a ruthless beast sounded.The plants in the surrounding black forest also bent from the pressure caused by the beast\u2019s roar.Kaliweir\u2019s face changed greatly, \u201cBe careful, it\u2019s a huge one!\u201d*Boom Boom!* The heavy steps rang. Leylin and the rest saw the appearance of the creature.It was a huge black bear and its skull was split open, as if exposing its brain. There was also a \u2018V\u2019-shaped, white mark on its chest, like a lightning scar.\u201cBe careful! It\u2019s the Violent Hilly Bear; each one is comparable to a Level 3 Acolyte! Last time, it was this fellow that we met!\u201dKaliweir\u2019s pupils shrank to the size of a pin, \u201cBe careful of its roaring attack. It was this attack that killed Hank previously!\u201d\u201cDamn it! Let\u2019s disperse and run!\u201d Raynor\u2019s face turned pale and he suddenly turned around and scooted off.\u201cThis coward!\u201d Neela fumed and her face turned red. The Violent Hilly Bear increased its speed because of Raynor\u2019s sudden escape.\u201cThere is no choice left! This exceeds our capabilities, so let\u2019s scatter and run. Let\u2019s hope to meet each other back in the academy!\u201dKaliweir smiled bitterly and made his decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA Knight\u2019s BreakthroughAfter Kaliweir finished speaking, he took out a black powder-like substance from his robes and sprinkled it onto his legs. He suddenly appeared taller and upon closer inspection, it seemed that not only had \u00a0his height increased, but there were also tufts of black fur growing out of \u00a0the bottom of his shoes.With this black fur, Kaliweir\u2019s speed increased tremendously and he disappeared from the forest in the span of a few steps, with a speed faster than Raynor\u2019s.\u201cThe seed from a blade of Nimble Grass? It seems like Kaliweir used it to protect his life, but the aftereffects of this seed are not small!\u201dLeylin muttered, looking \u00a0towards the two girls at his side, \u201cIt is a little embarrassing to say this, but we had still better split up!\u201d\u201cSince we chose to come out here and take such risks, we should naturally be prepared to lose our lives! To be honest, the fact that you were able to stay behind those two guys has already shocked us !\u201dNeela said as she took out a green potion in a test tube and threw it on the floor. A green-coloured hurricane swept up and enshrouded Neela and Lilisse within its centre.\u201cSee you at the academy!\u201d Enveloped in a whirlwind of green, the two girls \u00a0disappeared from Leylin\u2019s vision.\u201cEveryone has a trump card, huh?\u201d Leylin smiled, moving his feet and disappearing from the forest.In a flash, the party of five began to split up, with everyone using their own methods to escape from the scene.Leylin\u2019s footsteps never faltered, and the trees on either side of him disappeared into the distance as he sped ahead.\u201cThe attack power of the Violent Hilly Bear is extremely high, while its \u00a0speed is just average. In the party of five, Kaliweir used the Nimble Grass, while Neela and Lilisse used a speed-enhancing potion. As for \u00a0me, I have the strength of a Knight, and therefore my speed is pretty good. However, Raynor, the first to run, has the slowest speed amongst the five of us and is also in the greatest danger. If he did not prepare any trump cards, it is highly likely for him to die here.\u201d\u201cI should be able to escape from this Violent Hilly Bear\u2019s hunting grounds with Raynor as a decoy, so I had better not use this potion just yet!\u201dAs a Potions Master, Leylin was still rather rich despite not being able to sell his goods in bulk. Naturally, he had prepared several trump cards that could protect his life, without which he would not have the confidence to come outside to train.Every step he took was perfect, his every move and action seemed to blend in with the forest and he did not receive any obstructions from any branches or vines, his actions as smooth as flowing water. His speed was actually almost the same as Kaliweir who had used the Nimble Grass.\u201cGroarrr!\u201d A vicious roar sounded.Suddenly, a black figure appeared in front of Leylin, and with it came a huge bear paw.\u201cImpossible! How could it have made a detour to be in front of me? Was Raynor unable to draw it away ?\u201dGreatly startled, Leylin\u2019s body reacted, his conditioned reflexes causing him to take out his cross blade and begin slashing in front of him. .*Clang!* Leylin hurriedly used the huge recoil travelling through the cross blade to turn his body around and escape the attack range of the bear\u2019s paw. He did not have a good grip on the cross blade and as a result, it flew out of his hands.*Bang!*At this moment, Leylin did not hesitate to throw a fire red potion at the Violent Hilly Bear.The moment the test tube exploded, a scorching red flame suddenly engulfed the Violent Hilly Bear.Leylin did not stay to watch the scene. Instead, he immediately turned around and ran.\u201cThe explosive potion\u2019s might may be great, comparable to an average Rank 0 spells, however, it still lacks the power to penetrate the Violent Hilly Bear\u2019s thick hide.\u201cGroarrr!\u201d The Violent Hilly Bear\u2019s roar sounded from behind, and it seemed to be getting closer to Leylin.Leylin turned around to look, and his eyes almost popped out, \u201cThis is illogical!\u201dHe saw that the Violent Hilly Bear\u2019s head was a little charred, but the rest of the body remained undamaged. The explosive potion seemed to do nothing else apart from further enraging the Violent Hilly Bear.The Violent Hilly Bear\u2019s massively oversized body seemed to be as light as a feather and did not hinder its speed in the slightest, allowing it to tail behind Leylin.\u201cA.I Chip! Take readings!\u201dLeylin gave a command, but the A.I Chip did not reply even after half a day and only a faint static noise could be heard.\u201cA.I Chip! A.I Chip!\u201d Leylin called out again, but it was to no avail.\u201cDamn it, just what exactly is happening?\u201dLeylin\u2019s face distorted in frustration. The A.I Chip was his greatest trump card in this world. Suddenly losing it had turned him a little crazy.*Thwack!* The Violent Hilly Bear caught up to Leylin once again, and it swatted with his massive paws as if it was swatting at a mosquito.\u201cUmbra\u2019s Hand!\u201d Leylin hurriedly chanted and a black coloured hand rose from the Violent Hilly Bear\u2019s shadow, firmly holding on to the bear\u2019s paw.The huge bear roared nonstop, but was unable to escape from the Umbra\u2019s Hand.Seizing this opportunity, Leylin hurriedly ran off. \u201cThe Umbra\u2019s Hand\u2019s effect will only last for a few seconds! I must hurry!\u201dLeylin fled miserably.\u201cDamn it!\u201d \u00a0Leylin grumbled yet again, \u201cWhat on earth is going on? This Violent Hilly Bear is stronger than my expectations, and it has such a swift speed too!\u201dIn the black forest, the grass and shrubbery blew in the strong wind and the occasional insect cry could be heard from time to time.\u201cAt last, I have finally escaped for now!\u201d Leylin ran for a dozen-odd minutes before he dared to turn back and look. The dark forest resembled the mouth of a huge beast, seemingly wanting to swallow him whole.\u201cCaw! Caw!\u201d Just when Leylin had finally caught his breath, the abominable sound of ravens could be heard in the sky.Leylin raised his head and looked. There were ravens that were much larger than the Red-Eyed Ravens from earlier. Furthermore, there were three of them! Once they spotted Leylin, they immediately swooped down towards him.\u201cMy cross blade has already been lost and my Spiritual Force and Magical Power are almost drained too. Am I going to die here today?\u201dAn ominous premonition rose in Leylin\u2019s heart.A black talon came slashing at him, and Leylin hurriedly attempted to dodge it. In spite of his attempts, the claw of the raven etched three gashes into his back.The immense pain clouded Leylin\u2019s vision, \u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to die! I have not qualified as a Magus yet! Or seen the rest of the world! How could I just die a silent death here !\u201dAs he tumbled on the ground, Leylin picked up a green rock from behind him.\u201cHa!\u201d Jumping back up, he viciously smashed the rock down onto the Red-Eyed Raven\u2019s head!*Bang!* This time, Leylin used all of his strength, and the Red-Eyed Raven swayed as it fell onto the floor.\u201cCaw! Caw!\u201d Angry cries were heard in the sky. Seeing that their \u00a0comrade had died like that, the other two Red-Eyed Ravens immediately cried out and swooped down to avenge it.\u201cBring it on!\u201d Leylin lowered himself slightly, coiling his body into position, \u00a0like a leopard who was about to catch its prey.He felt every artery in his body expanding quickly, and the blood continuously surged, circulating huge amounts of energy into the various parts \u00a0of his body. A warm current gradually rose in his lower abdomen, and the wound on his back no longer seemed as painful.\u201cDie!\u201d Leylin shouted, and flung the rock in his hands out ruthlessly. This time, he seemed to have used all his energy, and the warmth in his body constantly responded to him. The rock let out an ear piercing whistle and directly struck one of the Red-Eyed Ravens.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026Internal life energy!\u201d Leylin was mildly shocked. He had attained the qualities of a Preparatory Knight long ago. Moreover, he meditated constantly, so he was almost comparable to that of an actual \u00a0Knight. However, he had not been able to ignite his internal life energy until now, and he never thought that he would be able to have a break through at this point.Right at that \u00a0moment, the warm current in his lower abdomen travelled to his two eyes, and a piercing pain in his eyes made them water.When he opened his eyes, his vision was extremely blurry, as if he was shrouded in mist. However, the faint blue words of the A.I Chip had finally reappeared.[Beep! The host has suffered from an unknown effect\u2026\u2026 Abnormality in the current state!][Ho\u2026\u2026 Host is hallucinating!]The screen of the A.I Chip displayed was intermittent, as if it was suffering from a very strong interference.\u201cHallucination!\u201d Leylin was startled. However, at this moment, the other Red-Eyed Raven had already swooped down right in front of him. Behind him, there came a violent roar from the forest and a massive bear paw vehemently struck out at Leylin with a hooked claw.Facing such a life-threatening attack, Leylin grit his teeth and actually closed both his eyes.The sharp claws pierced his body and he felt an immense pain. However, it was not as painful as he thought, and Leylin\u2019s body did not fall.\u201cIt really is like this, huh?\u201d Leylin\u2019s lips curled upwards.\u201cA.I Chip! Show me my current state!\u201dThe A.I Chip\u2019s display merely appeared more distinct in the darkness.The lines full of red-coloured warnings about the abnormal status was extremely striking, but Leylin had actually not realised it before.[Beep! Detection over! The Host has breathed in very potent and delicate hallucinatory gas particles! The five senses were affected! To expel or not?]\u201cBegin expulsion immediately!\u201d Leylin commanded.[Beep! Reserve energy has been used, expulsion in progress!]The A.I Chip indicated that the expulsion was complete, and only then did Leylin open his eyes.Right now, he was situated inside a shrubbery, and the Violent Hilly Bear and Red-Eyed Raven disappeared without a trace.There were many cuts on his body from the barbs in the shrubbery, and blood were dripping from them. However, there were no gashes on his back.\u201cIt seems like it really was an illusion. What I saw earlier was completely artificial!\u201dLeylin looked at his surroundings again. On the left, there was a tree that had fallen, and he saw traces of scorch marks in his surroundings.\u201cAlthough what I saw was fake, my reactions were all real. The explosive potion and Umbra\u2019s Hand uprooted the tree, and it is very likely that I mistook the tree for the Violent Hilly Bear!\u201dLeylin felt a little regretful. The explosive potion had cost him plenty of Magic Crystals, and he had spent a whopping amount before buying the formula and ingredients from Woox. But now, he had actually used it against a tree.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t reap any benefits.\u201d Leylin looked at the prompt shown by the A.I Chip earlier.[Secretion of adrenaline in the Host\u2019s body has rapidly increased, blood flow has increased by 58%!][The Host has ignited internal life energy and broke through the boundaries of a Knight!]\u201cIt might have been an illusion all along, but the igniting my internal life energy and advancing to a Knight was real!\u201d\u201cIt is also thanks to my advancement into a Knight that led me to realise that something was amiss, if not, I would have died just like that!\u201dLeylin was a little afraid, \u201cA.I Chip! Record the status I was in earlier when I broke through into a Knight!\u201d[Beep! Recording is done, name: State of advancing to a Knight]\u201cThis state may be the key to igniting internal life energy! However why would it have some resemblance to the magic powers from my previous world? It seems extremely unconventional!\u201dLeylin harboured a few suspicions. This Knight\u2019s advancement method was extremely perilous. Many of the situations required luck, otherwise, there might be an excessive secretion of adrenaline, opening up the possibility of being poisoned to death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayReturning To The Academy\u201cI wonder how Kaliweir and the others are doing now?\u201dWhen Leylin feebly picked himself up, he felt like his whole body was going to fall apart.\u201cEven with the A.I Chip, I have fallen into this state, let alone their situations. I had better find them quickly, it would be really terrible if they were to fall into a trap or encounter other wild beasts.Leylin drew out a red-coloured potion from his waist pouch and opened the wooden plug. He poured the red liquid onto his wounds.*Hiss!* White mist continuously rose up from the wound. Leylin gritted his teeth, his face a little twisted.After the white mist dispersed, a red membrane was covering the wound, and the bleeding had already stopped. It had also closed the wound. Leylin waved his hands around and noticed that his movements were not restricted.\u201cThis hemostatic potion is very good, but it\u2019s so painful when it\u2019s being used!\u201dLeylin grumbled, drew out another blue coloured potion, and gulped it down. The blue potion was sweet and carried the fragrance of white bread. Leylin felt his body getting much better and also recovered some strength. He walked out from the shrubbery and leaned against a big tree to rest.\u201cA.I Chip! For that hallucinatory gas, are there any remedies against it?\u201dSince he knew that the only danger over there was the hallucinatory gas particles, Leylin did not mind rescuing his other party members.If it really wasn\u2019t possible, then Leylin would just turn his head and return to the academy to inform the professors while praying for them.[Suggestion: Freshwater has good protective properties against the infiltration of the gas particles!]The A.I Chip replied.\u201cFreshwater, huh?\u201d Leylin opened his water bottle and soaked a handkerchief, wrapping it over his nose and mouth before heading back to their previous location.\u201cI thought that I had run very far away, but I haven\u2019t even gone a thousand metres!\u201d Leylin retraced his footsteps. Moments later, \u00a0when he returned back to where the party of five had split up, he was a little speechless.\u201cA.I Chip! Scan the area in front and form a map!\u201dSince he knew that the path in front was filled with hallucinatory gas particles, Leylin still felt very vulnerable despite his safeguard.[Beep! Scan completed!]An image appeared in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes. Where the five of them were earlier, there was a depression with huge mushrooms growing out from it.These mushrooms were extremely big and almost as tall as a human being. Each one was a mysterious purple colour, with many black spots faintly forming the image of a human in pain.\u201cWhat type of mushrooms are these?\u201d[Comparing to database! Similarity level: Spider-Faced Mushroom 98.7%, Spear-Lining Mushroom 74.5%, Purple Umbrella Flower 23.3%]\u201cSpider-Faced Mushroom?\u201d Leylin thought back to an image he had seen in a picture book from the library.\u201cThe Spider-Faced Mushroom is a very mysterious plant. It is able to emit extremely strong hallucinatory gas particles, and people with weak constitutions and other intelligent beings will not be able to resist them. They will often attract flying beasts and live together in harmony with them. It seems like the two Red-Eyed Ravens from earlier were attracted to them.\u201dLeylin noticed a few bones at the stem of the purple mushroom, some seemed to belong to humans, and some were from various creatures.\u201cHowever, these kinds of dangerous plants should have been cleaned up around our school area, unless they were moved here only recently!\u201dLeylin conjectured and suddenly felt chills over his body as if he had discovered a part of a conspiracy.Shaking his head, \u201cThis is not something that I can attend to now. I had better hurry and look for Neela and the others and then leave immediately!\u201dWith the help of the A.I Chip, finding the others of his party members proved to be extremely easy.Raynor was lying not far away, with one of his thighs impaled on a branch. It seemed like he had run into it himself.Not long later, Kaliweir was found too. At this moment, he looked like a lunatic, cleaving at a huge black boulder. He could not even see Leylin walking over, and was knocked out by Leylin in the end.As for Neela and Lilisse, they were the luckiest. Not long after they left, they had been entangled within some vines. When Leylin found them, they were still clad in the glow of the green hastening potion and were actually not injured at all.Leylin brought the four of them far away from the Spider-Faced Mushroom. When he found a stream, he tossed all of them into the water.This was the suggestion given by the A.I Chip.With the bone-chilling cold water from the stream invading the noses and throats of Kaliweir and the others, their bodies began to convulse violently.\u201cCough Cough!\u201d Kaliweir and the others started to cough violently.Leylin moved the few of them onto flat ground and laid them on their backs. He then picked up a weapon and got into a defensive stance.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kaliweir rubbed his aching head and propped himself up.\u201cDo you still remember what happened earlier?\u201d Leylin came in front of Kaliweir.\u201cYes! I remember now, we met with the Violent Hilly Bear and even some Direwolves!\u201d Kaliweir touched the gash on his face.\u201cWas it you who saved us?\u201d\u201cIndeed! However, what we encountered were not ferocious beasts. I\u2019ll explain it when the others have woken up!\u201d Leylin pointed at the others, who seemed to be regaining consciousness slowly.When the few of them left the domain of the Spider-Faced Mushrooms and gulped down huge amounts of fresh water, their minds started to clear again.Leylin explained the matter of the Spider-Faced Mushrooms to them. As for himself, he said that he was lucky to avoid their situations because he had an item that could resist hallucinations.After listening to Leylin, the expressions of Kaliweir and the others weren\u2019t very good at all.\u201cLeylin! Thank you! I owe you my life!\u201d Kaliweir said solemnly.\u201cUs too!\u201d Neela and Lilisse spoke at the same time. As for Raynor, he opened his mouth but no words came out from it.\u201cI suggest that you all better tend to the injuries on your bodies first!\u201d Leylin pointed to the puncture in Raynor\u2019s thigh.\u201cAlright. I have some medicinal powder here. Do you need it, Raynor?\u201dKaliweir felt for the item on his body, and then retrieved a bottle of medicinal powder from his waist pouch and gave it to Raynor.Leylin took a whiff and knew that it was medicine from the regular world. While it had certain effectiveness, it was still incomparable to a hemostasis potion.The party slowly treated the wounds on their bodies. Raynor was the most injured, and his lips were as pale as snow. His legs were wrapped very thickly with gauze. Kaliweir managed to find a stick for him to use as a crutch, so he could at least manage to walk.The physiques of Magi already begin to differ from those of regular humans. With the help of potions, wounds that are not too severe will usually finish healing in a few nights.\u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d Kaliweir looked at Leylin. Although he was the party leader in name, Leylin\u2019s performance made him bow his head.\u201cCan you still walk?\u201d Leylin asked Raynor.\u201cI can definitely walk! Don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t leave me behind!\u201d Raynor hurriedly propped himself up with the crutch.\u201cThen we had better hurry and set off!\u201d Leylin thought of the Spider-Faced Mushrooms and of his own predictions. He had an ominous feeling about the recent events.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Neela and Lilisse agreed in unison, it seemed like they were afraid of this place already.\u201cMy Hastening Potion! That was something that I spent 5 Magic Crystals on!\u201d Along the journey, Neela lamented.\u201cThat is still okay, look at me!\u201d Kaliweir adjusted his sack; the most important things were the 12 Red-Eyed Raven claws in it as they were the proof of completing the mission. He then pointed to his ankle.On his legs, tufts of black fur already covered his calves and began spreading to his thigh area.\u201cAlthough a seed from the Nimble Grass can allow you to run quickly, their reproductive abilities are too great. After using them, you will definitely be contaminated. If you don\u2019t hurry back to the academy to take care of it, you might soon become a furry man!\u201d\u201cOuter appearance is one thing. The most important thing is that if the Nimble Grass live on a human\u2019s body for a long time, there will be poisonous properties! At that time, you can only amputate your leg!\u201d Kaliweir said with a resolved expression, \u201cHurry!\u201dAlthough he still wore a deadpanned expression, his footsteps had obviously quickened.After suffering from the Spider-Faced Mushrooms\u2019 attack, the five of them became easily frightened on the way home. Any rustling of leaves or blowing of the wind would make them feel nervous for a while.When they finally saw the Abyssal Bone Forest Graveyard, Leylin swore that he had never found this graveyard so lovable before now.\u201cPassword!\u201d This time, the two-headed dog asked in a female voice.\u201cAbyssal Bone is paramount!\u201d Kaliweir said slowly.The password changes whenever a certain period of time has passed. However, the password will naturally be told in advance to those who go out on a mission, like them.\u201cCorrect!\u201d The two-headed dog allowed them to pass and returned to being a statue on the platform.Leylin finally heaved a sigh of relief when they entered the academy\u2019s gates.Although there were no deaths on this mission, they still met with several dangers along the way. If not for the A.I Chip\u2019s help, it was very likely that their party would have been wiped out completely.\u201cLet\u2019s go! We\u2019ll first hand in our mission!\u201d Kaliweir\u2019s expression loosened and he smiled. As for Lilisse and Neela, they both seemed relieved as well.The five of them walked towards the Mission Area. Kaliweir queued in front of the counter while the other four waited to the side.\u201cNeela, did the missions cause so many injuries or deaths in the past?\u201dLeylin felt that the atmosphere was a little off. The number of casualties in the Mission Area had obviously increased, and there were curses and sobbing heard from time to time.\u201cWe don\u2019t usually have this many! I can guarantee that!\u201d Neela looked at the many acolytes with darkened expressions on their faces. It seemed like not only did they fail their missions, but they had also paid a heavy price for them.\u201cLook! The missions have been refreshed!\u201dLeylin raised his head and saw a notice hanging in the upper corner of the black wall, with striking red words.\u201cAttention! There has been a significant increase in the dangerous creatures around the academy. We hope that the acolytes who go out in the future will be more cautious. If you aren\u2019t a Level 3 Acolyte, we recommend that you stay inside.These words were a size bigger than the others and were written in a striking red font.Behind the warning, there was a new mission written in red.\u201cMission: Find out the source of the abnormalities in the academy\u2019s vicinity. Reward: 500 Magic Crystals, high-grade information on 3 topics at will, or an improved spell model. This mission is categorised as extremely dangerous, be prudent when accepting this mission!\u201d\u201c500 Magic Crystals, high-grade information on 3 topics, or even an improved spell model!\u201d Leylin exclaimed.\u201cIf only I had that many Magic Crystals!\u201d Lilisse was also intimidated by the generous reward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you aren\u2019t a Level 3 Acolyte, then going out is practically throwing your life away!\u201dA voice sounded, and Kaliweir appeared behind Neela.\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cYeah! Here is the reward for our mission. 15 Magic Crystals!\u201d Kaliweir opened the pouch and there, sat 15 Magic Crystals.\u201cAccording to our prior agreement, each of us gets 3 Magic Crystals!\u201d Kaliweir divided the Magic Crystals and then opened a large black sack. It was filled with many Red-Eyed Raven claws, as well as feathers, eyeballs and other miscellaneous materials.\u201cThere is also this stuff! Only the Red-Eyed Ravens\u2019 two claws have some worth. Each one can be sold for about 1 Magic Crystal. As for the other materials, they\u2019re worth roughly 15 Magic Crystals in total! Do you guys have any questions? If not, we\u2019ll be dividing them accordingly!\u201dThe Red-Eyed Raven claws were only needed to prove that the mission had been completed. After it has been confirmed, the acolytes are allowed to keep them, and they can be considered additional income.\u201cI have no problem with that!\u201d Leylin smiled. This time, he merely wanted to gain experience and was not too fussed about the number of Magic Crystals.This time, earning 30 Magic Crystals at once could be considered a lot. However, there were also the expenditures of this mission to factor in\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Neela and Lilisse used a hastening potion, and Kaliweir used the seed from the Nimble Grass. As for Leylin, he had used an explosive potion, hemostasis potion, and a strength potion. All these expenditures amounted to over 30 Magic Crystals.If they were to calculate everything, the mission would be considered a flop and would not even compare to Leylin\u2019s brewing of potions to earn money.Seeing as Leylin had agreed, Neela, Lilisse, and Raynor could only nod their heads.\u201cIn this mission, Leylin, you did the most. If not for you, we would have long been dead, so it\u2019s alright if you take a little more!\u201d Kaliweir was extremely sincere, and it seemed as though he had made up his mind about this long ago.\u201cI don\u2019t need it!\u201d Leylin smiled and picked out two of the Red-Eyed Raven claws, as well as some other materials, from the bag. After estimating that the things he had taken out were worth around 6 Magic Crystals, he stopped.\u201cThese will be enough for me.\u201d\u201cAlright, then we will redistribute the items again\u2026\u2026\u201d Kaliweir felt a little forced, but Lilisse and Raynor were obviously happy about it.All of them, more or less, had wounds on their bodies. Something seemed to have happened recently to the academy, and accepting missions would no longer be a possibility if it turned out to be dangerous. The group quickly exchanged their contact information and left the mission area.Kaliweir left the fastest. By now, the black fur had already grown to his thighs, making his legs look like those of a gorilla, and it seemed like he could not wait to seek help.\u201cGoodbye!\u201d Lilisse and Raynor bade farewell too.\u201cCould you tell me your dorm number?\u201d Neela stuck closely to Leylin\u2019s side while whispering into his ear.Warm air blew into his ear and he felt a little ticklish.\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for that! Maybe next time!\u201d Leylin declined. Right now, his body still ached faintly, so how could he be in the mood to do it?\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll be waiting!\u201d Neela laughed coquettishly and gave him a light peck on the cheek, before running away quickly.Leylin shook his head and turned around, returning to his dorm.As he opened his door, he saw that everything in the room had remained the same as before his departure and a feeling of security washed over him as he entered.\u201cThe mission did not even last for a month, so why do I feel like a lot of time has passed?\u201dLeylin shut the door, placing the cross blade, sack, and other items aside before lying on his bed.He enjoyed the soothing comfort provided as he rested on the soft bed.\u201cA.I Chip! Show me my current stats!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte, Knight. Strength: 2.5, Agility: 2.7, Vitality: 3.0, Spiritual Force: 4.2, Magical Power: 4.0. Status: Healthy]There was an overall increase in the stats; his Strength, Agility and Vitality had all increased by 0.3, while his Spiritual Force increased by 0.1.\u201cAfter advancing to a proper Knight, all my stats have risen. As for my Spiritual Force, this is the result after one month of continuous meditation!\u201dLeylin gazed at the 3D image of him, \u201cA.I Chip, calculate how much more the internal life energy in my body raises my stats.\u201dAfter a Knight ignites their internal life energy, there will still be a breakout period for their stats to increase. However, Leylin had already increased his stats plenty through meditation, so the effects may be diminished slightly.[Establishing task, calculation in progress\u2026\u2026][Beep! The simulation has ended. Expected increase in Host\u2019s stats: Strength: 0.6, Agility: 0.3, Vitality: 0.1!] The A.I Chip\u2019s voice sounded.If my stats were at 1.9 like the average person, this internal life energy would be able to raise all my stats by at least 1. However, now that my foundation is so high, raising it will be even more difficult!\u201dLeylin reasoned.\u201cThe Farlier Family is only a newly established line of Knights. They have no training methods to pass on for after one turns into a Knight, so I have no inkling of how to advance to a Grand Knight.\u201dAlthough there should be information regarding this aspect in the academy, the potential of Knights are much inferior to that of Magi, so I can forgo this goal for now!\u201dEver since he entered the academy, Leylin had devoted all his time and effort to his Magus studies and delayed his training to become a Knight.Even a Grand Knight will only end up as a follower or servant of an official Magus. Besides, a Knight\u2019s journey will end after becoming a Grand Knight. As for Magi, they can continuously advance, so Leylin naturally chose the path with a better prospect.\u201cBesides advancing to a Knight, this map is the only benefit of my trip outside this time.Leylin projected the image of a huge map.Faint blue lines formed the general outline of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy as well as its surroundings. It was even more detailed than the one Kaliweir had.On this map, the path that Leylin and his party had taken was the clearest. Furthermore, the vicinity of where the Spider Faced Mushrooms had been found was even marked as a dangerous zone.This map was formed through his own exploration, the scanning from the A.I Chip, as well as the map that Kaliweir had.It could not be said to be completely free of mistakes. But this was definitely the most detailed map amongst the acolytes. He would be able to fetch a price of at least 2 Magic Crystals if he were to sell it.In the centre of the map, green words highlighted the location of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u201cFrom this map, it can be seen that our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is only taking up an insubstantial area in the South Coast. It could also be said to be in a rural area.\u201cFurthermore, with Abyssal Bone Forest Academy in the centre, the Death Seas would be to the south. To the north, it would be the Mountain Plains of Despair; to the west, Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut; and lastly, \u00a0the Poolfield Kingdom to the east.The north and south area are all forbidden regions, with countless dangerous creatures residing within them. Some with differing bloodlines, some of which have been contaminated. They are also haunted by evil spirits that are filled with grievances. Any acolyte stepping foot in those regions would die ten out of ten times.\u201cAs for Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut, it is another faction of the Magi. I have heard that there are some conflicts between Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, so I can\u2019t go there either.\u201d\u201cThe only one left for acolytes to explore would be the Poolfield Kingdom.\u201dLeylin thought indifferently. The factions in this world were similar to those of the Japanese during the world war, where various factions were divided in accordance to their territory and they controlled the various kingdoms from the dark.In these kingdoms, the Magi bloodlines would be either royalty or nobility. As for the Knights, their bloodlines would commonly be those of wealthy families.\u201cIn regards to their social hierarchies, the Magi would be like the feudal lords of the Warring States and the Knights would be the warriors and soldiers serving under them. Furthermore, they don\u2019t have a lone sovereign governing them as a whole; there are as many small kingdoms as there are stars in the sky, fighting solely for their own benefits in a chaotic era.\u201cThere are a few Magi families supporting the Poolfield Kingdom behind the scenes. The kingdom has a total of 19 provinces. Each area is extremely vast, with many small Magi families, wandering Magi, and travellers living there. They would definitely not come to the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy to make any trades, so there should be some kind of small markets over there. I\u2019ll try concealing my identity and heading there to sell my potions!\u201dLeylin\u2019s Potioneering skills were only average, but with the help of the A.I Chip, his succession rate for brewing had long surpassed his senior Merlin and could even be comparable to that of his mentor, Kroft. However, all of this had to be kept with the utmost secrecy. As such, Leylin did not dare sell too many of his potions inside the academy.However, once he advanced to a Level 3 Acolyte, he would reach a bottleneck. Without a vast amount of resources to use, one could only slowly progress with time.Even a fifth-grade acolyte, without resources, would require at least 3 years advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte!Leylin was only an average, third-grade acolyte, and could only rely on this bit of income on the surface. To satisfy the requirements for advancement, who knows how long he would have to wait.\u201cA.I Chip! Simulate the requirements that I need to advance into Level 3 Acolyte!\u201d[Prerequisites for Level 3 Acolyte: Spiritual Force: 7, mastery of at least 3 spell models, 500 grams of Reactive Elixirs required to aid with breakthrough.]\u201cLearning the 3 spell models is easy, but the Reactive Elixirs will be troublesome to obtain. I will need at least 500 Magic Crystals!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression was extremely solemn. As a Potioneering acolyte, he naturally knew what Reactive Elixirs were. These potions were not the same as elementary potions like the strength potions or hemostasis potions. However, they required someone to have reached the basic level of Potioneering. There are those which increase Spiritual Force, Vitality, or even potions that can reinforce the mind runes at an alarming rate. The demand is always greater than the supply for them.\u201c500 Magic Crystals is a little too much. However, after I have finished mastering the elementary Potioneering techniques from Mentor Kroft, I can then start practicing with basic potions. I might only need to purchase 100 Magic Crystals worth of ingredients to make the potions myself.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the most important thing will be to get my Spiritual Force up to 7!\u201d Leylin appeared to be deep in thought, \u201cA.I Chip! According to my current status, how long will it take to meet these prerequisites through meditation?\u201d[Using the Host\u2019s Spiritual Force as a base, simulation in progress!][Beep! The simulation has been completed. Estimated time needed: 8 Years 6 Months and 15 Days!]The A.I Chip responded without any emotions.\u201cThat long?\u201d Leylin\u2019s face turned pale, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? It only took me a little over a year to raise my Spiritual Force to 4.2 from the stats of an ordinary human\u2026\u2026 \u201c[The host has gained a resistance towards meditation, changing to a higher tiered meditation technique is recommended. Another option is to find ingredients that are compatible for raising the effects of meditation!] The A.I Chip projected a screen, with the various data and results on it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAncient Potions\u201cAccording to the A.I Chip\u2019s simulations and extrapolations, the elementary meditation technique is most useful when used to construct mind runes. However, after a Level 2 Acolyte has finished constructing their 24 mind runes, they can only progress slowly with time\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo wonder even fifth-grade acolytes get stuck at the bottleneck to advance to a Level 3 Acolyte!\u201dLeylin looked at the results of the mathematical formulas and entered into deep thought.\u201cI have been in the academy for this long, but I haven\u2019t heard of any acolytes who own an advanced meditation technique. Furthermore, the apprentices of the other professors all stop progressing for at least a few years after they have reached Level 2 Acolyte standards. It seems like even the professors can do nothing regarding this matter of meditation techniques, so I can give up on it first!\u201d\u201cAs for the use of ingredients, there was some basic level potion formulas that could help in the raising of Spiritual Force. However, the price for them is rather high and the ingredients are also very costly. Even the results are rather appalling\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, my succession rate will definitely be higher than other Potioneering Masters because I have the A.I Chip. Therefore, increasing my Spiritual Force with this method is highly feasible!\u201dLeylin made up his mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s next is to collect formulas for potions that can raise my Spiritual Force. In addition, I should sell my potions outside and obtain more potion ingredients!\u201d\u201cHowever, it seems rather dangerous outside the academy right now, so how am I supposed to go find those black markets or small-scale trading groups?\u201dLeylin\u2019s brows furrowed again. \u201cWith these problems, the professors inside the academy will definitely not sit around and do nothing. The problems will be resolved after a while; I had better get the potion formulas for increasing my Spiritual Force before anything else.\u201dIf the problems outside could not be solved by even the Magi, then Leylin would definitely be at even more of a loss. Thinking this, he soon entered a dream state very quickly.The next morning, Leylin sought out Professor Kroft.\u201cA potion formula that can raise Spiritual Force?\u201d Kroft was a little surprised.\u201cThe success rate of brewing these potions is too low and the resources required are extremely expensive. Many Potioneering Masters have lost their family fortunes over this, and only those with a strong family background are able to reap the benefits\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough Leylin\u2019s Potioneering talent was highly outstanding, Kroft still felt that his apprentice had set his goals a little too high.\u201cSir, you know it too. My aptitude is only third-grade acolyte. For a third-grade acolyte to progress to a Magus, there is an even greater bottleneck. Breaking through to a Magus is easiest when it\u2019s done at a young age, so I want to give it a gamble.\u201dLeylin spoke softly.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 You!\u201d Kroft sighed and sat down slowly, \u201cI do have a few basic potion formulas for raising Spiritual Force, but I signed a contract preventing me from reselling the formulas when I got them from other parties. As for my own formulas, you are definitely not able to afford them\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow many Magic Crystals are they worth?\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart sank, but he still asked.\u201cHaha! I knew you wouldn\u2019t give up. 5000 Magic Crystals, and that\u2019s only because you\u2019re my apprentice!\u201d\u201cSiii!\u201d Leylin sucked in cold air, and then laughed bitterly, \u201cIt seems like I have no hope!\u201d\u201cDeveloping a potion formula for raising Spiritual Force requires a Potioneering Master to spend a dozen, or even several dozens, of years on continuous experimentation, and the consumption for this is immense. Moreover, possessing an exclusive formula usually boosts a Potioneering Master\u2019s family development. Hence, it is within reason for potion formulas to be this costly.\u201dHaving a monopoly will yield the greatest profits. Leylin nodded his head slowly.However, it also depends on who owns the formula. If it was an acolyte instead of a Magus, even Leylin would have harboured some bad notions. However, Kroft was an official Magus, and he had the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was behind him as his patron. Furthermore, his human relations were not bad; hence he did not have many worries.\u201cHowever, if you really have this goal, you might not be completely without answers!\u201dJust as Leylin was prepared to take his leave disappointingly, Kroft spoke these words.\u201cIt seems like I have a chance!\u201d Leylin was secretly elated and hurriedly bowed.\u201cAlthough I am unable to give you my personally-developed formulas, I still have a few formulas from the Magi of old, and they were obtained when I went exploring several times before, so you can use them and give it a try!\u201d Kroft said slowly.\u201cFormulas from the Magi of old?\u201d Leylin felt a little uncertain.\u201cIndeed! Magi were the most prosperous back in the ancient times. Not only did they construct the Byron empire which spanned over several continents, they had even set their sights on several other distant worlds, conquering different planes one at a time!\u201d Kroft\u2019s face was a little flushed. It seemed as though he held the utmost fascination towards the prowess of the ancient Magi.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the Byron Empire collapsed one night, due to some unknown reason, and the legacies of these ancient Magi were lost. We, as Magi in more recent times, have only risen to power through a few remnants of the research and documents left behind by the ancient Magi\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle by little, Kroft spoke of the story behind the scenes. This information was never mentioned in the historical books in the academy.\u201cI wonder how mighty these ancient Magi were?\u201d Leylin put on a fascinated expression, and asked:\u201cThose formulas, are they all defective?\u201d\u201cIndeed! You\u2019re very smart! Although the effects of these formulas are good, many of the ingredients have already ceased to exist. At least, I have never come across them in the 200 years of my life\u2026\u2026\u201dKroft said unhurriedly, \u201cHowever, many Potioneering Masters still feel some affection for these ancient formulas because they all wish to find a substitute for them. Even if they have only a fraction of the original models, their effects are extremely useful!\u201dLeylin was elated. With the help of the A.I Chip, he would definitely save a lot of time and effort when researching them.On the surface, he still put on a frowning and worried expression, \u201cSo\u2026\u2026 You want me to find substitute ingredients?\u201d\u201cIndeed! Potioneering Masters often rely on flashes of inspiration for their successes. Many new types of potions are developed on this basis. If you really want to, you can try your luck! However, the success rate will be extremely low!\u201dKroft\u2019s face darkened. It seemed as if he was reminded of his past failures.\u201cSir! I still want to give it a try. Even if I won\u2019t be able to develop a new formula, I can still improve my skills in brewing!\u201d Leylin gritted his teeth.\u201cI can rest assured if this is your thinking!\u201d Kroft nodded his head. After rummaging through the shelves behind him, he managed to find some dusty scrolls.\u201cThe formulas of the ancient Magi are all here.\u201dWhen Leylin received the scrolls, his hands dipped. They seemed to be made of some unknown material with an extremely high density.Casually flipping to a green coloured formula sheet, Leylin was intimidated by the numerous scribbles of the ingredients required.\u201cGhost Spirit Flower, Seven Leaves Grass\u2026\u2026 The poison sac of a Human-Faced Snake\u2026\u2026The hair of a resentful ghost\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin had never even heard of over half of the ingredients listed there. As for the remaining one-third, they were precious treasures even to a Magus, and looking at them made Leylin\u2019s eyelids flutter wildly.\u201cHow is it? You\u2019re shocked, right? I had the same expression as you when I first saw them too! However, if you were to brew a potion in accordance with the ingredients listed, I dare say that it would be useful even for an official Magus!\u201d Kroft smiled a little.Leylin flipped through several other formulas. He tried to find something that would suit the level of an acolyte and would have the easiest to obtain ingredients. A good half an hour later, he had barely managed to sift through and find two.\u201cI\u2019ll just take these two, the Azure Potion and the Tears of Mary!\u201dThese two potions were better suited to Leylin\u2019s current conditions.\u201cAlright! These two potion formulas suit you well!\u201d Kroft nodded his head, \u201cEach one is 150 Magic Crystals, so the total would be 300 Magic Crystals!\u201dAlthough this was a dozen times cheaper than a potion formula for raising Spiritual Force, Leylin still felt a little heartache. He drew out all of the Magic Crystals in his pockets, and the Magic Crystals clattered and piled up into a small mound in front of Kroft.Within this mound, there were several pieces with greater energy undulations. These were mid-grade Magic Crystals, and the value of one was equal to ten regular Magic Crystals.\u201cThere are 250 Magic Crystals here, and I\u2019ll add this blade of Snake-Patterned Grass!\u201d Leylin wore a look of reluctance as he drew out a small cloth pouch from his robes. After opening it, there lay a blade of silver-coloured grass. It even had the pattern of a snake\u2019s scales on its surface.This was something that he commissioned Woox to obtain after a long period of time. However, having extracted a few of its properties, this blade of Snake-Patterned Grass was not very useful to him anymore.\u201cOh! Snake-Patterned Grass. Although it is rather damaged, its properties are still intact. I estimate it to be worth about 50 Magic Crystals.\u201d Kroft\u2019s eyes shone as he inspected the blade of silver grass.\u201cThe trade has been established! These two formulas are now yours!\u201d Kroft smiled and nodded his head.Leylin then pocketed the formulas for the Azure Potion and Tears of Mary and bowed to Kroft, bidding farewell before leaving the room.\u201c300 Magic Crystals! That was all the income I\u2019ve earned from selling potions this year! The ingredients needed for these two potions are also very precious. I can only hurry and head outside the academy to sell my accumulated potions before I can exchange them for experiment resources\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin felt a little heartache. However, his success were way higher than what the others were estimated to have, and apart from selling potions in the academy, he had still managed to amass many other potions. If he were to sell them outside the school, he would definitely earn a huge amount of Magic Crystals!Ever since he obtained the two potion formulas, Leylin\u2019s mind was filled with ideas on how to earn more Magic Crystals and brew potions.\u201cLeylin! Leylin!\u201dA girl\u2019s voice rang and interrupted Leylin from his dazed state.\u201cIt\u2019s you, Bicky! I\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about some things!\u201dLeylin sized up the girl in front of him. After a year of growth, Bicky\u2019s figure had even grown to be more provocative. Especially those two perky mounds on her chest, they had already begun to take shape.\u201cHmph! Even you are like this! Fayle is the same too!\u201d Bicky pouted.\u201cHaha!\u201d Leylin glossed over it, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, is Fayle ignoring you again?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it! Fayle has been treating me well recently, and we even had dinner at the dining hall on the second floor yesterday!\u201d Bicky said cheerfully, \u201cOnly, he seemed fixated on the academy\u2019s recent mission, the one with blood-red writing, wholeheartedly wanting to claim the reward!\u201d\u201c500 Magic Crystals, high-grade information, and even an improved spell model. If I wasn\u2019t just a Level 2 Acolyte, I would most likely be tempted too!\u201d Leylin joked.\u201cWhat were you thinking earlier?\u201d\u201cNothing much, only that selling potions within the academy are rather disadvantageous for me and I want to try selling them outside!\u201d Leylin spoke with a half-truth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNyssaRegarding the matter of wanting to sell his potions outside the academy, Leylin felt that there was nothing much to hide.Other Potioneering acolytes were sure to have these thoughts too, but no one would expect Leylin to sell such a surprising amount.He must conceal his identity when selling the potions, but everything will be fine as long as he is not recognised.\u201cThe acolytes in the academy are indeed clever, keeping the prices down!\u201d Bicky nodded her head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn from our senior, Merlin. He signed a contract with a Magus family, where they provide potion ingredients to him for free and will buy all of the potions he makes!\u201d\u201cI like my freedom!\u201d Leylin shook his head. He knew a little about Merlin\u2019s decision. Merlin had signed a contract with a Magus family. The family would provide huge amounts of ingredients for him to practice brewing and would also provide him with viable resources to aid him in breaking through to an official Magus. But after he becomes a Level 3 Acolyte, Merlin will have to provide a certain number of potions for the family every month. Furthermore, he would have to join the family after becoming an official Magus.This was how Magus families roped in lowly acolytes.Without the A.I Chip, Leylin might have embarked on a similar path. Or worse, having no family wanting to take him in because his aptitude was too poor.\u201cBicky, your family resides in Poolfield Kingdom if I recall correctly, do you know if there are any markets or places for people to trade their goods?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cOf course! However, the situation there is extremely complicated. There are many wandering Magi and fugitives, so it is very chaotic and dangerous!\u201d\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t have to go there personally. For instance, I could always hire someone to do it for me.\u201d Leylin began to spout nonsense.\u201cIn the academy\u2019s Mission Area, acolytes can also give out missions as long as they have enough Magic Crystals and are able to make a deposit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true! In that case, I will send a copy of the information to your room later!\u201d Bicky nodded after giving it some thought.\u201cI will be really grateful for that! I\u2019ll buy you a meal in the second level dining hall next time!\u201d Leylin was elated.\u201cAlright!\u201d Bicky smiled and her two eyes curved into a crescent moon shape.\u2026\u2026As time passed, Leylin continued to analyse the two formulas with the A.I Chip\u2019s help. He also started to search for Rank 0 spells that could conceal his aura or change his appearance.Bicky had sent the information regarding the Magus bazaar long ago. However, Leylin did not dare go out until the strange happenings outside the academy were resolved.In the third level cafeteria that handed out free food, Leylin was eating a meal with Bill. Today\u2019s meal consisted of white bread with fish paste, as well as steak and fruit juice.\u201cWhat? Perry is dead? But he was a Level 3 Acolyte!\u201d Leylin was a little startled. Perry was a fifth-grade acolyte and also had a good mentor. Four years ago, he had risen to a Level 3 Acolyte and could be said to be an influential figure in the academy.\u201cThat\u2019s right! He accepted the mission to investigate the happenings around the academy and even formed a party for it. There was another Level 3 Acolyte in the party too!\u201d Bill\u2019s face darkened.\u201d\u201cWith a formation like this, only an official Magus could have killed Perry.\u201d Leylin surmised. Perry was sure to be carrying a Magic Artifact, and he was one of the strongest among the Level 3 Acolytes, not to mention any powerful, life-saving items his mentor could have given him. And yet he still died, making Leylin even more fearful of the danger surrounding the academy.\u201cNot necessarily, they might have been overwhelmed by numbers! I heard that when Perry was found, his lower body was missing and his innards were all eaten. At a glance, it\u2019s clear that these are the doings of the Beastmen!\u201d\u201cBeastmen?\u201d Leylin recalled the contents of a book he had read. According to the book, there were two explanations of their origins. One described them as the failed experiments of a Magus, and the other called them a type of human subspecies.However, a common point in both explanations was that these Beastmen were extremely savage and cunning.\u201cWeren\u2019t they always in the Desolate Lands of Despair? Why would they be roaming here? They\u2019re even attacking acolytes; don\u2019t they know that this is simply provocation?\u201d Leylin was a little puzzled.\u201cThe brains of Beastmen were always poorly developed, who knows what they could be thinking. But they have never dared to provoke Magi, otherwise they would have been long extinct.\u201d Bill added.Whenever the academy\u2019s official Magi go outside, their paths are not blocked, nor do any strange happenings occur. It seems as if these Beastmen concealed themselves in advance.However, they would attack with all their might whenever they met with an acolyte. It was a standard case of bullying the weak while fearing the strong.\u201cThey won\u2019t be this rampant for much longer! Perry is an apprentice of Professor Harosi. He\u2019s known for worrying about losing face and shielding his shortcomings, so he\u2019ll definitely take action!\u201d Bill said confidently.One reason why the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy did not take action against those Beastmen was because the Beastmen were too weak and posed no threat whatsoever to an official Magus. On the other hand, they give acolytes a chance to hone their battle skills and gain experience. However, the situation had changed now that an apprentice was dead.However, Leylin still felt that it was absurd for these Beastmen to suddenly appear in the academy\u2019s vicinity. As with the Spider-Faced Mushroom incident from before, he felt that it was all part of a larger conspiracy.\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not the only smart one in this academy. If I can think of it, others are sure to as well. Why are there no rumours as of yet?\u201dLeylin thought deeply, \u201cThis situation is a little odd, I had better make some preparations in advance.\u201d\u201cLeylin!\u201d A voice called from behind him, and it seemed to be wavering a little. Leylin turned around and saw Guricha, one of the acolytes who had come to the academy with him and possessed the aptitude of a second-grade acolyte. The energy waves radiating from his body showed that he was still a Level 1 Acolyte.\u201cThis is a friend of mine, I\u2019ll take my leave first!\u201d Leylin said to Bill.\u201cGo do your thing!\u201d Bill smiled.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Leylin walked over to Guricha and asked softly. Guricha was usually a rather reserved person and was always being berated by Kaliweir and the rest, so he seldom hung out with them. There had to be a problem if he sought out Leylin this time.\u201cThis\u2026 We do indeed have a problem! Could you come with me for a while?\u201d Guricha asked.\u201cAlright!\u201d Leylin agreed since he wasn\u2019t doing anything.\u201cLet\u2019s return to my dorm!\u201d Guricha brought Leylin to his dorm.Leylin looked at the room number, \u20181913\u2019. It was quite a distance from his dorm, no wonder they did not see each other much.\u201cLet\u2019s go in! Don\u2019t be too shocked!\u201d Guricha said preemptively.Leylin inhaled deeply and placed his left hand into his waist pouch before pushing the door open and stepping inside.Once he entered, a disgusting stench infiltrated his nose. It was rather similar to a mix of sewerage and the smell of a rotten corpse, and it almost made Leylin puke.Enduring the sickening stench, Leylin examined Guricha\u2019s room. Its layout was similar to his but there was a girl sitting on the bed now, and beside her was a figure wrapped in a black cloak. The stench was coming out from the cloaked figure\u2019s body.\u201cHello, Dodoria!\u201d Leylin recognised her. She was also someone who came to the academy with him. Her aptitude was even worse than Guricha\u2019s, only a first-grade acolyte, and barely qualified as a Level 1 Acolyte even now.As for the black-robed figure, according to the A.I Chip\u2019s scan, their energy waves were a little strange. Sometimes the readings showed that they were not even a Level 1 Acolyte, at times it showed that they were at the peak of a Level 1 Acolyte and could almost advance to a Level 2 Acolyte. Furthermore, the radiation on their body was exceptionally strong.\u201cHello, Leylin!\u201d Dodoria forced a smile, but both her eyes were red and puffy, as if she had just cried.\u201cWhat exactly is happening?\u201d Leylin felt that the problem lay with this black-robed figure.As expected, Guricha checked that the door was closed and then, forcing out a smile, he said to Leylin, \u201cYou have said hello to Dodoria already, but there is one more person, Nyssa. Do you still remember her?\u201d\u201cNyssa?\u201d Naturally, Leylin remembered the little girl who had the aptitude of a first-grade acolyte and got along with Dodoria rather well. She had also come from the same place he did.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d The black-robed figure was huge and swollen, like an extremely fat person, and even gave off a disgusting odor. It was very difficult for Leylin to link this figure with the petite and pleasant little girl from the past.\u201cNyssa, take off your cloak! Leylin is not an outsider! Besides, you still need his help!\u201d Guricha said.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Dodoria encouraged, sitting by her side.After listening to the exchange, the black-robed Nyssa hesitated for a while and then slowly took off her cloak.\u201cUgh!\u201d Leylin covered his mouth, his eyes wide, looking extremely shocked.Just how on earth was this a \u201cPerson\u201d!\u201dScars littered her face, and there were even signs of stitches. She had the snout of a pig, her head was bald, she was missing an ear, and had coarsely spaced teeth. A thick, repulsive, yellow fluid continuously flowed out of her mouth. Her facial features looked like they had been messed up by someone and then put back together.Looking at her appearance, two words surfaced in Leylin\u2019s mind: \u201cSuture Freak\u201d. Right now, Nyssa\u2019s appearance was like someone casually taking parts of a creature\u2019s corpse and sewing them together.With such a horrendous outer appearance, and compared to Leylin\u2019s image of how girls normally look like, Leylin finally understood why Nyssa chose to cloak herself in a black robe.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026What is going on exactly?\u201d Leylin\u2019s face darkened.\u201cDo you still remember the additional conditions that we there when we were choosing our mentors?\u201d Guricha reminded.\u201cYou mean to say\u2026\u2026Aiding in the experiments!\u201d Leylin got a shock. He had originally thought that the conditions offered by the professor were too good, and now it turned out to be a trap!\u201cThat\u2019s right! We didn\u2019t have any Magic Crystals, so the choosing of our mentors was at random. Nyssa was allocated to a professor who specialises in Transfiguration!\u201d\u201cHe treated Nyssa well, not only did he impart her with a lot of knowledge, he even promised her 1 Magic Crystal a month if she participated in his experiments!\u201d Dodoria said, while wiping off the tears in her eyes with a handkerchief from time to time.\u201cThree days ago, Nyssa was poisoned by the radiation of a spell, and she has been like this ever since then,\u201d Guricha explained gloomily.\u201cHuman experiments?\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart sank. He knew that there were many Magi in the academy who did human body experiments in secret. However, they seldom operated on their acolytes directly.\u201cAlthough there are many Knights and peasants he could have experimented on, acolytes are of good calibre because they have the highest resistance to spells!\u201d Nyssa finally opened her mouth. Her voice was hoarse with old age and even carried a metallic ring to it.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Guricha continued, \u201cCough cough\u2026\u2026 I, too, have been aiding my professor in many of his experiments. Although there are no irreversible changes yet, a few residual effects are beginning to appear\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chip, examine Guricha!\u201dLeylin ordered. Immediately, an image of Guricha was projected and Leylin noticed some pathological symptoms in some of his organs, the lungs in particular.Acolytes are already capable of resisting spells, so how strong would the radiation have to be for an acolyte to be unable to withstand it?Leylin\u2019s face changed, \u201cWhat did the academy say about this?\u201d\u201cWhat could they say? Nyssa signed a pact with her mentor before the experiment and even declined any compensation!\u201d Dodoria exclaimed as she sobbed.Leylin was silent. Many low-grade acolytes, with no magic crystals, could only be assigned to different professors randomly. If their luck was good, they would meet professors like Kroft. If their luck was bad and they were to meet with professors who liked to experiment on humans, then they could only blame themselves for being unlucky.Additionally, many of the acolytes could not resist the enticements from their mentors and would cooperate with them for experiments, so even outcomes like death were a possibility.A few acolytes would die from experiments in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy each year. In comparison, Nyssa, who was able to keep her life, was much luckier than those who died.\u201cSo why did you look for me? If it\u2019s to help seek revenge or any other justice-related matters, then I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be of any help.\u201dLeylin did not allow any room for negotiation right at the start. To challenge a Magus with the powers of an acolyte, he would only do that if there was water seeping through his brains.\u201cWe don\u2019t have such intentions. We\u2019re just here to let you take a look to determine if there is still hope for Nyssa to recover her original appearance.\u201d Guricha hurriedly shook his hands.Leylin nodded his head. After all, he had the Potioneering Master, Kroft, standing behind him. If he couldn\u2019t think of anything either, Nyssa could only despair.\u201cDo you mind if I have a look?\u201d Leylin asked Nyssa.\u201cI don\u2019t\u201d Nyssa\u2019s voice was extremely soft, almost inaudible.Leylin walked forward, and the disgusting stench only grew more revolting. Leylin forced himself to pick up Nyssa\u2019s palm.Every finger was thicker than a carrot, looked purple, and there were disgusting rings of folded skin.What used to be the dainty white fingers of a lady had turned into this. Leylin believed that if he could not help Nyssa, then she ought to mentally prepare herself.Leylin pressed the back of Nyssa\u2019s hands \u201cDo you feel anything?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cHer defense seems to be pretty good!\u201d Leylin silently appraised, taking out a surgical knife from his waist pouch.The tip of the gleaming knife was placed on the surface of her palm and pushed into the skin lightly, but it didn\u2019t manage to cut through the skin!Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed and he applied more pressure on his hands, using all of his strength as a Knight to push down the tip of the blade. The surgical knife finally pierced Nyssa\u2019s skin, and a drop of yellow pus flowed out.Leylin hurriedly took out a test tube and stored that drop of pus.After dabbing some hemostasis potion on it, the wound on Nyssa\u2019s hand rapidly healed. 10 seconds later, there wasn\u2019t a single scar to be seen.\u201cWhat monstrous healing abilities!\u201d Leylin gasped inwardly, but didn\u2019t dare say it aloud.Seeing Dodoria and Guricha, who were staring at him without moving, Leylin laughed.\u201cQiadarmo \u2013 Xurado\u201d With the incantation, a gust of wind suddenly swept into the room and formed a small whirlwind.Black mist rose unceasingly as it consolidated into a vague, humanoid shadow in front of Leylin.Guricha and Dodoria were startled, and even Nyssa retreated several steps back.\u201cI never thought that he would already be at this level after only 1 year or so. Could there really be no way to remedy the difference between aptitudes?\u201d Guricha looked at Leylin, who was casting a spell, with a complex expression.Leylin did not pay attention to Guricha in the slightest. Right now, his thoughts were all on the summon that was right in front of him.\u201cFor you!\u201d Leylin spoke in the Byron language and handed over the test tube containing the yellow fluid from Nyssa over to the shadow.The shadow\u2019s eyes glowed red. As it did not have any hands, it directly bit the test tube with its mouth. *Crunch!*The test tube broke and the black shadow swallowed the yellow liquid into its stomach.*Hah Hah!* When the yellow fluid entered its body, the black shadow seemed to destabilise. It roared loudly, and cold sweat formed on Leylin\u2019s forehead.\u201cKrin \u2013 Sidamoersi!\u201d As Leylin continued to chant, he took several dark-green rocks from his pouch and tossed them towards the shadow.After about 3 to 4 minutes, the black shadow stopped rampaging and spoke to Leylin in several obscure words.Guricha and the others listened closely, but this language was very unfamiliar to them. It was definitely not the Byron language.Ever since the ancient times, many Magi organisations have invented their own unique language for magic after many years, so to learn them all is just a pipe-dream.The black shadow continued to howl, and then disappeared after one final roar.Looking at the disappearing black shadow, Leylin could not help but to heave a sigh of relief.\u201cHow was it?\u201d Nyssa asked. As it was her own problem, she was the most concerned about it.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult! Your constitution has already been completely transformed, and there is a huge amount of polluted energy circulating in your body. If not for the fact that you were an acolyte, you would have died long ago!\u201d Leylin shook his head.After listening to Leylin\u2019s assessment, Nyssa\u2019s eyes dimmed and she retreated back several steps.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not like there are no solutions at all!\u201d Leylin continued.\u201cWhat means are there? No matter what the conditions are, I will definitely do my best for Nyssa!\u201d Dodoria clenched her fist.\u201cYes, we should think of a way together. Then we\u2019ll be able to solve it eventually!\u201d Guricha cheered on, which made Leylin somewhat speechless.\u201cThe first method is for Nyssa to advance to an official Magus. Magi are able to use the constant radiation to change the way they look. As long as she spends the time, she will definitely be able to change back into her original appearance!\u201dLeylin said slowly. This kind of remodeling of the physique through radiation required fine tuning from oneself. There was no room for other Magi to help; there would be a huge backlash if they tried.\u201cAn official Magus? I am only a Level 1 Acolyte right now!\u201d Nyssa\u2019s eyes flashed for a brief instant, but it dulled almost immediately.\u201cThat is too difficult, however, it is also an option. What other methods are there?\u201d Dodoria asked.\u201cThere is only one more method I can think of, which is to use the Harmonious Aqua Regia Potion! It can cleanse Nyssa\u2019s body of the pollutants, after which it would be much easier to remodel her appearance.\u201d Leylin introduced the second method.\u201cHarmonious Aqua Regia Potion! Heavens! Isn\u2019t that a potion used by Magi? One potion is worth at least 1000 Magic Crystals!\u201d Guricha\u2019s eyes almost popped out from his sockets.\u201cThat\u2019s right! The pollutant in Nyssa\u2019s body is rather severe, only a Magus level potion that can remove radiation will be useful!\u201d Leylin said definitively.\u201cThese are the only two methods that I can think of, but I will also ask my mentor later!\u201dThese two methods were the most optimal of the choices provided by the A.I. Chip, Leylin believed that even Mentor Kroft would not be able to come up with a better idea.\u201cAn official Magus? 1000 Magic Crystals? I will achieve it!\u201d Nyssa\u2019s eyes filled with resolve as she clenched her fists.\u201cMy sincere apologies for not being able to help. Please accept these potions, it will be able to reduce the pain that you feel during midnight!\u201dLeylin gave a small bow and took out a pink potion from his pouch. He could only do this much.\u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d Nyssa was clearly a little shocked.\u201cFrom the reactions given by your body, it seems like the energy particles react the most at midnight, which is also when you will feel the most pain!\u201d Leylin explained calmly.\u201cNyssa! Why haven\u2019t you told me this!\u201d Dodoria\u2019s eyes filled with anger once again.\u201cYou have already done enough!\u201d Nyssa replied.\u201cTake it!\u201d Leylin handed the potion over to Guricha and turned around, walking out of the dorm.The three people left in the room were as silent as the dead. \u201cWhat now?\u201d Guricha spoke first.\u201cAn official Magus? This is simply out of reach for us because of our low aptitudes. The acquiring of Magic Crystals to buy a Harmonious Aqua Regia Potion is more realistic!\u201d Dodoria said.\u201cIf the three of us were to pool our resources together, after borrowing some more from others, we would have\u2026\u2026 \u201c Dodoria did not even believe her own words. Acolytes would definitely spend any Magic Crystals they had on knowledge or items to increase their power. No one would simply throw them away.\u201cNo! I wish to try breaking through to an official Magus!\u201d Nyssa said slowly, her words filled with resolve.\u201cWith the blessings of my mentor, this radioactive body\u2019s defense is much higher than an average person\u2019s. My spell resistance isn\u2019t too bad either, I should accept more missions and earn the resources I need to advance! I cannot hold the two of you back any longer\u2026\u2026\u201dNyssa forced a smile, but it looked uglier than crying.\u201cWhy? Why did it turn out like this?\u201d Dodoria cried.Guricha hurriedly embraced her, it seemed like these two had been a couple since long ago.\u201cFollowing the plots of the novels from my previous world, shouldn\u2019t I hurry and sell some potions to earn enough money to pay for Nyssa\u2019s treatment? And at the same time, I ought to advance to a Magus and seek revenge for Nyssa and the like.\u201dLeylin let his imagination run wild as he walked.\u201cA pity that this is reality! Nyssa and I can\u2019t even be considered friends, only strangers who have seen each other a few times. Giving her the painkiller potion earlier was already the limit, and that was seeing how we came from the same place!\u201d\u201cAs for Magic Crystals, I don\u2019t even have enough to use for myself, so how could I take them out? One must always pay the price for their own actions!\u201dLeylin\u2019s gaze turned frosty as he left the dorm area.He would not do anything else for Nyssa, and she would only depend on herself.After walking past the flower garden located beside the dorms, sniffing the aroma from the flowers, and basking in the sunlight radiating from the roof, Leylin\u2019s mood became much better.Walking to a long bench, Leylin sat down and looked at the acolytes walking past, his mind at peace.\u201cComing out to bask in the sunlight occasionally is also a type of enjoyment, isn\u2019t it?\u201dA voice travelled over and a grey robed youth sat beside Leylin.\u201cJayden?\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes opened wide.[Beep! Jayden. Strength: 1.9, Agility: 2.7, Vitality: 3.1, Spiritual Force: 5.0. Level 2 Acolyte. Energy waves from a low-grade Magic Artifact have been detected from the Target\u2019s body. Target is classified as dangerous!] The A.I Chip\u2019s scan of Jayden appeared in Leylin\u2019s mind.Jayden\u2019s Spiritual Force was the highest among the acolytes, and even his Vitality had increased after the constant radiation. Normally, Magus would intentionally increase their Vitality to prepare for future transformations of the body.Right now, Jayden\u2019s Spiritual Force was higher than Leylin\u2019s. He also carried a Magic Artifact, but no one knew of his battle experience.\u201cCalculate my chances of winning if I were to fight with Jayden!\u201d[Simulation beginning.

Chip\u2019s scan, Leylin understood Jayden\u2019s strength a little more.Leylin was considered to have a considerable amount of battle experience amongst the Level 2 Acolytes. As long as his opponent did not have a Magic Artifact, he would have a very high chance of winning.Jayden had a Magic Artifact, but was still slightly inferior to him. This meant that his battle strength was lower than Leylin\u2019s. Even though he had some battle experience, it was not much.Of course, these were only rough estimations from the A.I. Chip. In reality, fighting has to be viewed from many aspects.\u201cJayden, I haven\u2019t seen you in such a long time!\u201d Leylin greeted.Jayden naturally did not know that his stats had been found out by Leylin in just a second. He adjusted his robes and sat by Leylin\u2019s side.He revealed his pale, white face as he raised his head to meet the sunlight.\u201cI haven\u2019t basked in the sunlight for so long. Ever since I started following my mentor, my schedule has revolved around\u2026\u2026 meditation, experiments and my studies!\u201dJayden stretched his body, looking contented.\u201cI heard that you are doing pretty well under Kroft!\u201d Jayden said suddenly.\u201cIt\u2019s alright; I\u2019m basically just brewing potions and exchanging them for resources!\u201d Leylin was extremely modest.\u201cHowever, you recently went on a mission with Kaliweir, are you going to join that side?\u201d Jayden suddenly smiled, but a cold glint seemed to flash in his eyes.Leylin was a little speechless. He never thought that this conflict between groups that these kids had formed before was still ongoing. However, he had forgotten that he himself was only a boy of 14 years at this moment.\u201cWe\u2019re all acquaintances, we just did a mission together since we met by coincidence. That\u2019s all!\u201d Although Leylin was not afraid of Jayden, he still felt that it was better to avoid any trouble as much as possible.Jayden looked at Leylin several times and the A.I. Chip even informed Leylin that his brain waves had been scanned several times. It seemed as though Jayden had actually used a spell to determine if he was speaking the truth.After some time, Jayden gave a radiant smile.\u201cI think highly of you! Intelligent! Prudent! Being with Kaliweir and the others will only drag you down. Only by joining a higher circle of friends can you obtain more resources, glory, and even life!\u201dJayden got up and continued in an indifferent tone, \u201cLet me give you some advice, hurry up and leave the school!\u201d\u201cWhat? Could you clarify that?\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart tightened, as if had grasped something, and he hurriedly asked.However, Jayden only smiled, walking away without taking a single glance behind him.After Jayden\u2019s figure had completely disappeared, Leylin sat back on the bench, a little lost for words.\u201cPretending to be mysterious, as if he was a very powerful person, and even trying to convince me to join under his wing. Is that even fun? Does he really think of himself as the main character of a novel?\u201d\u201cHowever! Jayden is a fifth-grade acolyte and is deemed highly likely to advance to a Magus. He would definitely be able to obtain news faster than me. I\u2019m afraid that something has really happened!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face darkened.\u2026\u2026In a dark room, the fire was dimmed, and a promiscuous atmosphere permeated through the room.The moaning and shrill cries of a woman sounded, blending together with the constant low panting noises of a man.After climaxing, the girl lay in the arms of the man, as limp as a bag of soil.\u201cYou\u2019re awesome, just like a lion!\u201d Neela\u2019s expression was hard to make out.Leylin gently caressed Neela\u2019s bare back and did not say a single word.He had encountered many things today and urgently needed to take it out on someone, so naturally he looked for Neela.In this period of time, he had long since hooked up with Neela. In this world, everyone was extremely open-minded about the notion of sex. Many people lost their virginity by the age of 11 or 12. Leylin and Neela both had their sexual needs, so they had already done the deed after only a few days.In any case, Neela was no longer a virgin. As for Leylin, he himself was a no-good person in his previous life. Both of them desired love and sex, and it wasn\u2019t bad to have a friend with benefits.With the regulation of the A.I. Chip, he would definitely not leave his seed behind. Naturally, he could mess around to the fullest.Thinking of this, Leylin felt life stirring below his pants once again.\u201cAh!\u201d Neela let off a cry, and Leylin stopped her as she was about to climb on top of him. The corner of Leylin\u2019s lips curved up wickedly, as he pressed Neela\u2019s head downwards.Neela rolled her eyes at Leylin, but her lips smiled coquettishly as she dived under the blankets.Leylin let out a satisfied groan and leaned onto the wall slightly. Both of his hands grabbed hold of twin peaks, and he felt the sponge-like sensation transmitting to his hands.Sometime later, Neela got up and walked towards the washroom stark naked.While he listened to the provocative beauty humming as she showered, Leylin began to ponder the day\u2019s event.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t care about Nyssa\u2019s affairs anymore. Although Jayden\u2019s warning was extremely sudden, it has to be treated seriously. This might have something to do with the phenomenon outside the academy. What\u2019s next is to investigate where the other fifth-grade acolytes went.\u201dIn any case, the academy would definitely not forsake those acolytes who had the highest potential to succeed and advance to official Magi. If the academy was safe, they would definitely still be here. However, if they all left the academy with various reasons, it meant that the academy itself would be fraught with danger in the near future.\u201cHarosi has been cleaning up the area outside the academy since Perry\u2019s death. After he has finished cleaning, it will be the best opportunity!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed.\u201cMy dearest, what are you thinking of?\u201dNeela stuck herself onto Leylin, and two soft mounds pressed against Leylin\u2019s right arm.\u201cJust thinking about a few things!\u201d Leylin smiled, \u201cRecently Sir Harosi seems to be making a huge ruckus outside the academy!\u201d\u201cYou heard about it too? About Perry?\u201d Neela lay on top of Leylin\u2019s chest and did not make any other movements.\u201cYeah! Losing a fifth-grade acolyte genius and a potential Magus, anyone would turn crazy for a period of time!\u201dLeylin said blandly, \u201cYou have your own cliques too, I need you to help me to find out a few things!\u201d\u201cNeela\u2019s smiled sweetly, \u201cI\u2019ll serve you, my lion king!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that! It feels extremely strange! It will make me think of some lion!\u201d Leylin rolled his eyes.\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s not talk about this, but about something more serious!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face was stern.Seeing him act this way, Neela also stopped smiling.Getting close to Leylin was so she could elevate her status and obtain more resources, and she clearly understood this.\u201cHelp me check the results of Harosi\u2019s battle. Also, find out if the academy\u2019s surroundings are completely safe now. Lastly, I want to know where all the fifth-grade acolytes have gone recently!\u201dLeylin whispered into Neela\u2019s ears.\u201cI got it!\u201d Neela grabbed Leylin\u2019s head with both hands, \u201cCould it be that something big is going to happen?\u201d\u201cI hope that it is only my imagination!\u201d\u2026\u2026It was the morning of the second day after he had walked out from Neela\u2019s room. Leylin felt extremely refreshed and full of vigour. It seemed like his venting had indeed helped in curbing his emotional distress suitably.After thinking for a while, Leylin went for a shower and then headed towards Professor Kroft.Kroft happened to be brewing a kind of potion. Red-coloured beetles were climbing around inside a test tube, occupying half of the space inside the test tube. It looked rather disgusting.\u201cYou\u2019re here! Is something the matter?\u201dKroft watched the test tube closely, as he sprinkled some blue petals into it.The red-coloured beetles hurriedly gorged on those petals, after which they dissolved and turned into a green-coloured liquid.A dozen seconds later, the test tube half-filled with the red beetles turned into a green-coloured potion.\u201cYour skills are really amazing!\u201d Leylin gasped.\u201cHaha! It\u2019s just practicing!\u201d Kroft shook his head, \u201cYou always look for me when you have a problem, so tell me what you want!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this. I, your apprentice, haven\u2019t seen senior Merlin, for some time now. Can I know where he has been?\u201d Leylin inhaled deeply.\u201cMerlin?\u201d Kroft\u2019s face had on a mysterious smile, \u201cHe has accepted a mission and left the academy already!\u201d\u201cHow long will it last?\u201d\u201cAbout 1 to 1.5 years! It\u2019s possible that it may take longer!\u201d Kroft\u2019s tone became sterner, but there was a hint of gratification in it.\u201cOne last question, was the mission suggested by the family supporting senior Merlin?\u201dAs a family that was able to rope in a genius Potioneering acolyte from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, their influence should be at the peak. After all, they had an intricate relationship with Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, so their news network might even be more efficient than Kroft\u2019s.\u201cYes!\u201d Kroft answered definitively. \u201cYou know, there are some things that were agreed on between the academy and me, so I cannot say it directly. But if you are to discover it on your own, then it would be none of my business!\u201d\u201cHowever, you don\u2019t need to be too worried. Your talent in Potioneering is only secondary to Merlin\u2019s, and the academy needs a talent like you too!\u201d Kroft comforted him.\u201cYes!\u201d Leylin smiled bitterly. It seemed like the academy still chose to categorise by aptitude grades. Those talented individuals like Jayden and Merlin who were also fifth-grade acolytes had all been given ample time to retreat. But when it came to him, the treatment he received was much inferior. Up until now, he had only received a few obscure hints from his mentor.As for those whose aptitudes were even worse, they probably wouldn\u2019t know what happened even after they were dead.Although Leylin did not understand too well either, there was one thing that he was certain of! The academy was no longer a safe place to stay!Once again, Leylin was determined to leave, \u201cSo, may I also take up a dispatch mission?\u201d\u201cYou may! Go to the counter of the Mission Area and clarify your intentions. They will be able to understand, since your aptitude isn\u2019t too bad and your talent in Potioneering is even more outstanding!\u201dKroft nodded his head.\u201cThank you, Sir!\u201d Leylin hurriedly bowed. Allowing acolytes to leave was an extremely good thing for them, after all, he did not want to stay in a potential battlefield.Afterwards, Leylin assisted Kroft in a few more research experiments in Potioneering and also took the opportunity to seek answers for Nyssa\u2019s problem. Unfortunately, Kroft did not have any good methods either.After bidding farewell to his mentor, Leylin walked outside, \u201cThere is only a small family behind Bicky. As for Kaliweir and the others, they aren\u2019t fifth-grade acolytes, so they will most likely not receive the news. I\u2019m afraid I will have to drop a few hints for them. As to whether they will understand the message or not, it all depends on their luck!\u201dIn the lavish second-level dining hall, the gorgeous crystal lights sparkled dazzlingly, as numerous musicians performed. Listening to music while tasting delicacies, it was indeed a very enjoyable thing to do.Furthermore, the food here was all prepared with the utmost care. Not only could they increase one\u2019s stats, they could also speed up the meditation process. As such, they have always been welcomed by acolytes and Magi alike.However, there were very few customers here today. Most of their faces were gloomy, and the sight was rather unappetising.Leylin sat on a goose feathered coach and pushed a steaming mug towards Neela, \u201cThis is hot cocoa, with some grinded black pearls inside it as well. It has also a certain beneficial effect towards meditation, won\u2019t you try it?\u201dNeela, who was sitting opposite him, smiled bitterly, \u201cIf it was before, I would still be extremely excited. But now\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite any pretenses, the atmosphere in the academy was very different with such a huge war imminent. Besides, a large number of talented Magus acolytes going missing would definitely rouse the attention of others as well.Moreover, the academy didn\u2019t seem to want to hide this news. After all, they would still be relying on the official Magi for the upcoming battle, and these acolytes would not be of much help at all.Those that were left behind would definitely be those with the lowest aptitude and levels, only there to be used as cannon fodder.\u201cMentor Harosi has already cleared out the area around the school of Beastmen and any creatures who would pose a problem. They have been all reduced to skeletons by spells, especially the Beastmen, and their souls have been trapped in their bodies to suffer for eternity\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin gave a slight nod of his head. It seems like the vicinity of the academy was safe for the moment.\u201cHow about the other Magus potentials?\u201d\u201cVery troublesome! According to the news that my other sisters have gathered, many of the acolytes with high aptitudes, including Chester and Sherpa, have all left the academy for various reasons. I\u2019m afraid that it won\u2019t be much longer before this news spreads\u2026\u2026What did you find out?\u201d\u201cMy senior, Merlin, already left a few months ago! Furthermore, I, too, will take on a mission and leave soon!\u201dLeylin blandly spoke of the news he had gathered, and this made Neela\u2019s face turn even paler.\u201cWhat about you? What are your plans?\u201d Leylin still asked her at the end.\u201cI plan to return to my family. You know, although my Welter family is not very famous, we are still able to take care of ourselves. Do you want to come with me?\u201d Neela clearly wanted to rope in a talent like Leylin for her family.\u201cNo thanks! I have made plans for myself already!\u201d Leylin smiled, turning her down. He would be subjected to various contracts and restrictions if he joined a family. However, he had too many secrets and was not suited to having an entourage.The light in Neela\u2019s eyes dimmed. Leylin also knew that their relationship had come to an end. After all, they had just been enjoying themselves, but going their separate ways now, in a time of crisis, was very normal.\u201cThere is still something that I have to ask of you!\u201d Leylin took out a black-coloured wooden box and placed it on the dining table.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Neela smiled, but it seemed rather forced.He opened the black box. Many potions in test tubes were neatly arranged inside, and the sight dazzled Neela\u2019s eyes.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d Neela\u2019s mesmerising eyes let off an astonished look.\u201cThese are the potions that I have accumulated until now. Help me sell them off!\u201d Despite crossing his fingers, Leylin\u2019s expression remained calm.Of course, this was only a small portion of the potions that he had secretly brewed. Saying that it was his accumulation after a year was reasonable; their total value was several hundred Magic Crystals.Letting Neela sell them for him was because Leylin didn\u2019t want to be conspicuous. On the other hand, it also provided her with a little compensation.After all, a trace of chauvinism still remained, deep in his heart. Breaking up would require him to give some form of compensation at least, and letting Neela be the middleman gave her a chance to earn some profits.\u201cNo problem! Right now, the values of the various ingredients and spell models have fallen sharply, while potions and low-grade Magic Artifacts have drastically risen in price.\u201d Neela\u2019s eyes flashed.This was a normal occurrence. Spell models and other materials would definitely decrease in price whenever war was imminent, as they could not be used to improve one\u2019s practical strength immediately. As for the other items that are able to raise one\u2019s battle strength, they would be in high demand.\u201cAfter selling these potions, just give me 300 Magic Crystals for them!\u201d Leylin sipped the hot cocoa which had been resting on the table.Neela\u2019s expression was a little complicated, \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible. In fact, my family could just buy them all! Do you have more? I can let my family know and give you a fair deal\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThese are all the potions I have accumulated in the past year! You should know, I still need to rely on selling potions to obtain resources. If not for the market doing well right now, I wouldn\u2019t let them all go in one breath like I am doing now!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression seemed extremely earnest.\u201cAlright! I will do my best to help you!\u201d Neela understood. In her eyes, Leylin brewing these potions nonstop and having such a collection was already the limit with his current ability.As the two of them had their own worries, the meal that followed was not very appetising for the both of them.After the meal, Neela hurriedly bade farewell to Leylin. Leylin entrusted some people to bring a few messages to the people that he mixed well with as well. He did not mention any details and only gave them subtle hints. Whether or not they could uncover the plot was all up to them.Neela was extremely fast, and she handed Leylin a pouch of Magic Crystals the very next day.After giving it some thought, Leylin decided it was better to spend his Magic Crystals while he was still at the academy. After all, he might not be able to find a trading depot outside, and even if he did, the resources there may not be as complete as what the school has.This departure would most likely last an extended period of time. Leylin made preparations for his advancement outside. He prepared to buy ingredients to brew Reactive Elixirs and spell models available. As for any knowledge that a Level 3 Acolyte might require, it had been stored in the A.I Chip since long ago.However, the knowledge provided by the professors stopped there. As for the advancement to an official Magus and the basic information for a Level 1 Magus, the knowledge was heavily guarded by the academy. Only Level 3 Acolytes who have signed a contract with them would have the right to access them.Leylin headed to the spell models\u2019 shop first.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The attitude of the old lady behind the counter was even more vehement now. However, Leylin\u2019s good mood didn\u2019t waver. He already knew that those Level 3 Acolytes had failed in advancing to an official Magus and they had signed a contract with the school, to stay behind and provide basic services. Due to the restrictions in the contract, they could not run even if they wanted to. With the impending battle and the collateral damage that would be inflicted upon them, it would be weird if they had a good attitude!\u201cApart from Umbra\u2019s Hand, I want all of the basic spell models for the Shadow and Dark elements!\u201d Leylin put on a very magnanimous air.The old lady behind the counter looked at Leylin in surprise. After all, such a wealthy Level 2 Acolyte like him was rarely seen.\u201cThere is a total of 13, for 130 Magic Crystals.\u201d\u201cI also want the Basic Transfiguration spell model!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll be 140 Magic Crystals then.\u201d The voice of the old lady sounded from behind the counter.Leylin nodded his head and poured a bag of Magic Crystals out onto the counter. The lady counted them and put them away, after which she carried 14 spell books over. Each of them was as heavy as a brick, and they stacked up to almost Leylin\u2019s height.\u201cIt seems like I should buy some horses as well!\u201dLeylin hired a few servants and got them to bring the spell model books back into his room, and then he returned to the Trading Area.At this moment, the Trading Area was one of the few places that were still bustling with people.The number of acolytes who came here had also increased. Many premium goods had been put up for sale, attracting the attention of numerous acolytes.\u201cIt seems like even the acolytes have noticed.\u201d Leylin mulled.It was similar to how, in the forest, a small number of animals would sense danger and take flight before a huge disaster befell them, but other animals would naturally follow when they saw the animals leaving, even if they did not sense any danger.\u201cHowever, there are still no Magic Artifacts here.\u201d Leylin felt a little depressed. He had always wanted to own a Magic Artifact, but they were just too rare. Moreover, the prices were sky-high, and they would end up in the hands of a Magus every time they appeared. On the occasion that the Magi were dissatisfied with the Magic Artifact, the Level 3 Acolytes would all madly rush forward to grab it. Leylin simply didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201cMagic Artifact creation requires Alchemy and Enchanting, and it\u2019s such a profound subject. I don\u2019t even have enough time to focus on my Potioneering studies now!\u201dLeylin laughed bitterly, even the A.I Chip had a limit to its processing. According to Leylin\u2019s previous experience, only when his soul continuously advanced, would the A.I Chip\u2019s level increase.\u201cWhen I become a Level 3 Acolyte, if I don\u2019t have any other means, I will dabble in Enchanting and see if I can create my own Magic Artifact!\u201dThese stalls that had no Magic Artifacts did not attract Leylin in the slightest bit.However, there were still some unusual happenings. For example, the stalls that were selling potions were filled with people and the sale of bows, arrows, and leather armour was also great. But as for the stalls that sold ingredients, they were rarely frequented.He walked to Woox\u2019s store, which he was familiar with.Right now, it was crowded with acolytes and they bought any potions that they saw, in a very forthright manner.Woox was so busy that he was sweating, and had even employed a few acolytes to help him. Such a scene was definitely not common in the past.Leylin looked around. The potions on the shelves sold very quickly, many empty shelves were labelled as sold out.Woox\u2019s eyes shone when he saw Leylin. He called an acolyte to fill his position, and especially went to receive Leylin.\u201cHey! My dear Leylin, I heard the cries of a skylark today, and I know you will definitely bring good news. So? How many potions? I can give you 10% more than usual!\u201d Woox greeted Leylin cordially and looked at Leylin as if he was looking at a Magic Crystal.\u201cMy apologies.\u201d Leylin waved his hands, \u201cI\u2019ve been busy with missions, so I haven\u2019t been brewing much recently!\u201d\u201cThis is indeed a tragic piece of news!\u201d Woox sighed, \u201cYou don\u2019t know know how good the market is these days!\u201d\u201cAlright! Alright! I came here to purchase ingredients.\u201d Leylin said and handed a list of items over to Woox.After Woox received the slip and looked at the scribbles and quantities required, his face changed and bean-sized sweat droplets begin dripping down.\u201cSo many raw materials! Let me see, White Crystals, Purple Vine Radish Roots, claws of a Ghost Goblin, are you trying to brew a Reaction Elixir?\u201d The fatty asked straightforwardly.\u201cYes! Indeed! I want to make preparations for my advancement. If you have any completed Reactive Elixirs in stock right now I\u2019ll buy them off you. You can set the price!\u201dLeylin spoke casually, the formulas for the Reactive Elixirs could be found in the library and many people have seen them before. The fatty being able to recognise the ingredients was nothing amazing.Underneath the Reactive Elixir ingredients, Leylin had also added the many common ingredients needed for the Azure Potion and Tears of Mary. As for the few important ingredients, they have already been extinct in the Magus World for several hundreds of years, so Leylin did not even bother to write them down.\u201cThe brewing of Reactive Elixirs is extremely complicated and the success rate is also very low. The demand for it is so high, and they immediately sell out once they appear. How could I still have stock left?\u201d Woox shook his head.\u201cAt least, you Potioneering Masters are better off, you can brew whatever potions you need by yourself. I remember that when I was still a Level 2 Acolyte, I committed so many crimes just for a bottle of Reactive Elixir!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These ingredients weren\u2019t originally this cheap, but the prices of raw materials have fallen now, so I\u2019ll sell them for 200 Magic Crystals.\u201dWoox set his price.Leylin nodded and handed over 20 middle-grade Magic Crystals to Woox.He then received a huge bundle from Woox, drawing the attention of many onlookers in the vicinity.Leylin smiled bitterly, carried the bundle on his back, and begin casually chatting with Woox.\u201cSo? Have you obtained any news of Magic Artifacts?\u201d Leylin wouldn\u2019t let any chances of rapidly increasing his strength pass him by.\u201cOf course not!\u201d Woox shook his head quickly, \u201cThe prices of Magic Artifacts have recently been driven up wildly. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to keep their life-saving items and would go sell them?\u201dWoox suddenly lowered his voice, \u201cBuying so many ingredients and asking about Magic Artifacts, you must have received\u00a0that\u00a0news too, right?\u201dLeylin nodded his head, \u201cI am preparing to take on a long-term mission so I can go out and avoid all of this.\u201dWoox nodded his head, \u201cAvoiding it will be good, I will also leave in a few days\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cEven Woox, a Level 3 Acolyte with a Magic Artifact, has to flee!\u201d The compelling feeling in Leylin\u2019s heart only grew stronger, and after exchanging several more lines with Woox, he hurriedly bade farewell and left.\u201cThe mission cannot be put off any longer, I have to leave immediately!\u201dAlthough it wasn\u2019t necessary to register for a mission in order to leave, there was still the hurdle of the academy guardians. Leylin still wanted to return to obtain relevant information on Magi, so he would naturally follow these regulations.In spite of his rather average aptitude, his Potioneering talent had been acknowledged by even Kroft, so the academy would not keep him here to die.Because Harosi had already done a sweep of the school\u2019s surroundings, the Mission Area managed to regain some of its former liveliness. However, Leylin realised that there were extremely few Level 3 Acolytes upon a closer inspection. Naturally, he knew what this was all about.\u201cThey are all a pitiful bunch of people.\u201d Seeing these low-leveled acolytes splitting mission rewards and working hard to earn money to exchange for information, a pitying look surfaced in Leylin\u2019s eyes.These were obviously the forsaken ones. Although a lone acolyte would be absolutely helpless against a Magus, they could still cause damage and even kill an official Magus if tens or hundreds of them banded together to execute a formation. That was their role here.However, being in the vicinity of a Magus fight was extremely dangerous. It was already considered extremely lucky for them to have a 30% survival rate here.Although Leylin felt pity for them, he still would not mention the news. He had already pushed the limits by hinting to his friends. If he were to publicise the news, even Kroft would not be able to protect him.Leylin had a look at the missions on the wall; most of them had short durations and were also located very close to the academy. It seemed as though the academy had hidden all the other missions.When there were few people around, Leylin took the opportunity to quickly head up to the counter.\u201cWhat kind of mission did you want?\u201d The reception was a very skinny old man and seemed extremely amiable.\u201cThe missions on the wall don\u2019t suit me at all, are there any special ones? My name is Leylin Farlier, apprentice of Professor Kroft.\u201d Leylin said in a low voice, tossing a small pouch over.The old fellow hurriedly caught the pouch. After opening it, he smiled. \u201cOf course there are!\u201dHe took out a scroll from underneath the counter, \u201cLook at this. The missions are all written there.\u201dThe black-coloured scroll seemed to be extremely plain. Leylin opened the scroll and quickly skimmed through the missions written on it.These missions all had a common characteristic. Their difficulties were not high, but their duration was extremely long. In short, the missions let those Magus potentials avoid the imminent calamity.With the scan of the A.I. Chip, Leylin quickly decided on a mission.\u201cInvestigate the wilting vegetation in Extreme Night Town. Mission duration: 3 Years.\u201d\u201cI choose this one.\u201d Leylin pointed to the investigation mission and relayed to the old man.\u201cExtreme Night Town is located in the Eastwood Province of Poolfield Kingdom. You will have to travel through almost half the kingdom before you reach it. Do you want to buy a map?\u201d The old man smiled like a crafty merchant.\u201cGive me a map!\u201d Although Leylin had a map of his own, it was always good to have another for comparison.After spending two Magic Crystals, Leylin obtained a brand new map. Not only were the various provinces of Poolfield Kingdom highlighted on it, there was even a red line to mark his journey.\u201cAccording to the map, Extreme Night Town is on the eastmost side of Poolfield Kingdom, where the boundary is, and is very far from the academy. But the good thing is that it was near one of the Magi assembly points mentioned in the information Bicky sent, which would make acquiring information and news convenient.\u201dThis was also why Leylin chose this mission.\u201cThis is your exit pass.\u201d The old man handed a red metal card to him. \u201cDon\u2019t lose it, it\u2019s irreplaceable.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the academy has been very strict in governing any entries and exits lately.\u201dLeylin thought this inwardly, but he did not say anything aloud as he took the metal card.After walking out of the Mission Area, Leylin went to bid farewell to Kroft, Bicky, and his other friends.After all, he did not know how long he would be out for. Some things still had to be settled first. Having received Leylin\u2019s hint, Bicky was already preparing to return home. As for Kaliweir and the others, however, their complexions were rather bad. They had come from Chernobyl Islands and with no place to return to, Leylin could only pay them lip service and console them.Pushing his room\u2019s door open and seeing the familiar setup, Leylin suddenly felt a little regretful.\u201cI wonder when I\u2019ll be able to return back here.\u201dThe spell books and ingredients that he bought today were all lying neatly in a corner, filling up two big chests.After brooding for a while, Leylin moved his bed away to reveal some floorboards with very little dust on them.\u201cFarlier!\u201d Leylin gently tapped a black dot on the floor.*Ka-cha!* There was a mechanical noise, and the wooden floorboards slowly moved apart to reveal many potions stored in test tubes.The amount here was at least 10 times more than what he gave to Neela!If Woox saw this, his eyes might even pop out. Leylin smiled.This was his private potions collection. With the A.I Chip\u2019s help, his success rate has long surpassed what could be expected of others. He had sold a small portion of them, but the bulk of them remained here.\u201cLet me count! 200 Strength Potions, 150 Antidotes, 180 Hemostasis Potions, and an assortment of other potions, their total value would be at least 3000 Magic Crystals!\u201dLeylin looked at these potions. They were his greatest asset and had always been locked away beneath his bed. The spell used to secure them was a little magic trick that all Level 2 Acolyte knew. Apart from the owner using their Spiritual Force to open it, any means of forcing it open would only cause the items locked inside to self-destruct!\u201cNow, with the chests of spell books and the other ingredients acting as the premise, I can move these potions out with very little inconvenience. I will also have to draw some runes on the outside for concealment.\u201dLeylin opened a small box that was covered in runes. Sponges, silk and other such materials were placed inside to prevent the potions from rolling and being ruined.After spending almost half the night, Leylin finally managed to move all the potions into the box. He then covered the box with some ingredients and placed spell books around it.\u201cIt\u2019s already past six!\u201dAfter hearing his alarm ring, Leylin switched off the clock in his room.He hurriedly washed up and brought the two big chests to the highest floor of the academy, where he bought 3 fine, sturdy black horses and a carriage. Leylin took a deep breath and rode the carriage to an elevator-looking mechanism.\u201cTake out your exit pass!\u201d A man\u2019s voice sounded. Leylin hurriedly took out the red metal card that he received yesterday.*Bang!*The elevator-like mechanism rose slowly and when it finally reached the top, the sound of gears could be heard.The two stone doors opened, and a beam of resplendent sunlight came shining in.Leylin squinted his eyes, \u201cThe academy indeed has other exits. The original entry must be for people to use as a passage. However, the one here is for large items to go through.\u201d\u201cHyaa!\u201d Cracking his whip, he urged the horse carriage forward. Only then did Leylin realise that his current position was at the back door, right behind the central graveyard that they had entered from in the beginning.Afraid of being inconvenienced, he had told Bicky and the others that he was preparing to leave in the next few days, but did not specify an exact time. Hence, his departure was a quiet one.Leylin gave the academy one last glance and then began his journey.\u201cAlright. Why does my luggage make it seem like I\u2019m escaping from something, not the appearance of someone who is carrying out a mission?\u201dLeylin could not help but smile bitterly as he looked at the horse carriage he was driving and the heavy chests behind him.\u201cA.I. Chip! Bring out the map!\u201dAt Leylin\u2019s command, a map came into view. It was more detailed than the one he had gotten from the old man yesterday and had a route carefully marked out.\u201cBased on the map that I obtained yesterday, compute the most optimal way to travel! Requirements: Convenient and safe! Also, it has to approach as many Magi assembly points as possible!\u201dHeeding Leylin\u2019s voice, a red line showing the route surfaced on the map. It was a little different than the one he gotten from the old man. There were several more bends and they were all in the vicinity of Magi gathering places.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Leylin followed the route that was given to him by the A.I. Chip and drove the horse carriage forward.\u201cA.I. Chip! Increase the detection area to the fullest!\u201d Because it was an individual trip, Leylin did not dare to lower his guard at the slightest.[Mission establishing, beginning detection!]The A.I. Chip loyally carried out its duties, and a 3D image of the vicinity was constantly projected in front of Leylin.\u201cThe danger is the smallest when it is very close to the academy or very far away. The middle section is the most dangerous part of the journey!\u201d Recently, the Magi protecting the academy had been cleaning up the area, but they were too lazy to pursue the enemies so it was likely that only the middle section would be littered with danger.However, Leylin could only take a gamble. Harosi had also given them a lesson earlier, so he hoped that his journey would have more smooth sailing. After all, he might not be able to leave even if he wanted to, given enough time.The horse carriage rapidly dashed on the road and the bird cries on either side of the road decreased from before.As they got further from the academy, Leylin became more and more tense.[Beep! Warning! Warning! A high-energy living organism has been detected ahead!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice sounded, and a red object was projected onto the screen. There were huge branches constantly spread across the area, with many red spots of lights also floating above it.\u201cThis image? It\u2019s a tree?\u201d Leylin placed his hand into his waist pouch and reduced the speed of the carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it had green eyes.Surrounding the tree were a few winged creatures that were continuously flying around. Their skin was green and they were shaped like a human. They were also stark naked.\u201cGiant Tree Demon!\u201d Leylin exclaimed. He laughed bitterly, \u201cDidn\u2019t the academy clean up the area around the school already? Why is there still such a big fellow here?\u201d\u201cAn acolyte of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy?\u201d The huge tree spoke, and the winged creatures growing on its back also turned their eyes to him.\u201cI am merely a lowly acolyte who is preparing to leave. May I ask if you might give way for passage? I can pay a price for it!\u201dLeylin made a last attempt.\u201cOnly death awaits any living organisms who try to make any futile attempts to leave!\u201dThe giant tree let off a reverberating noise that even made Leylin\u2019s ear hurt. At the same time, a green vine was slowly lowered, and hanging from it was a human corpse. Its whole body was withered, and it was wearing the grey robes of an Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolyte.\u201cBig Brother! Stay behind and play with us!\u201dAt this moment, a little sprite that had been flitting around the Giant Tree Demon flew over. To Leylin, it sounded like the very pleasant voice of a girl\u2019s, the sound of her voice intoxicating him. It was as if this voice belonged to his most important person in this world. Gradually, Leylin began to feel that staying here might not be such a bad idea.[Warning! Warning! The Host is affected by a demonic charm!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice prompted, bringing Leylin out of his hallucination.\u201cThey actually charmed me!\u201d Anger coloured Leylin\u2019s face.\u201cA.I. Chip! What were the scan results?\u201d[Shuger Giant Tree Demon. Strength: 5, Agility: 0.5, Vitality: 9.8, Spiritual Force: 3.5. Skills: Leech, Vines][Green Tree Sprite. Strength: 0.9, Agility: 2.5, Vitality: 9.8, Spiritual Force: 3.1 Skills: Charming on living creatures][Rumours have it that the Green Tree Sprite and the Giant Tree Demon have a mutual relationship. Normally, the Green Tree Sprite will seduce the target into the attack area of the Giant Tree Demon and then the Giant Tree Demon will commence its hunt!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cThe Giant Tree Demon\u2019s Strength and Vitality are too high, and its body is extremely huge too. There is simply no way to go around it!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face was calm, \u201cIt seems like I can only fight!\u201d\u201cThe first will be you! You actually dared to charm me!\u201d[Critical point confirmed! Calculating wind power, adjusting trajectory!]Leylin suddenly raised his hands, and revealed the hidden crossbow as he pulled the trigger.* Xiu! * A black line streaked across the air and flew directly into the Green Tree Sprite from earlier.The arrow pierced the right side of the Green Tree Sprite\u2019s chest, causing its eyes to tear. Green fluid, what appeared to be juice from the tree, was flowing out of its chest as it fell onto the ground.\u201cDyrisse! That human actually killed Sister Dyrisse!\u201d The enraged and shocked voices of the other Green Tree Sprites came from the treetops.\u201cYou actually dared to kill my daughter!\u201d The Giant Tree Demon let out a furious roar, its huge vines racing towards Leylin.\u201cHyaa!\u201d Leylin moved the horse carriage backwards, avoiding the vines.\u201cAccording to the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculations, the Giant Tree Demon\u2019s vine\u2019s greatest attack range is only 20 metres! Its movements are also extremely slow, which is its greatest weakness!\u201dLeylin drew his cross blade and steadied the carriage before getting off.\u201cI only asked to leave, but since you refuse to listen when talked to nicely, it seems like a fight is the only means of resolving this!\u201d\u201cYou actually killed my lovely Dyrisse! I\u2019m going to turn you into a shriveled corpse and hang you on my body for a hundred years!\u201dThe Giant Tree Demon\u2019s roots emerged from the ground and stood up like a human before chasing Leylin.\u201cAt this speed! Are you kidding?\u201d Leylin laughed loudly and dodged as he clashed with the Giant Tree Demon.A dark green tree shadow whipped at Leylin, but he dodged by rolling away, easily evading the attack.* Pa! * The green vine was like a whip, and it smashed a very huge hole into the ground.Leylin slashed with the cross blade and chopped at the vines. The silvery white blade had made contact with the surface of the vine, but ended up leaving no more than a mark on it.Leylin felt a huge force coming towards him, and a few black shadows appeared behind him.[An attack has appeared from behind. The most optimal way is to turn right for 50 degrees and jump right!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice sounded.Leylin deflected a vine and turned to his right and jumped immediately, avoiding the sneak attack from the black shadow behind him.\u201cGreat Father! We will help you!\u201dRoughly 7 to 8 Green Tree Sprites swooped down, and they even carried small bows in their hands that looked like toys. However, when Leylin saw the dark green liquid on the arrow head, his expression changed.\u201cThere\u2019s poison!\u201dHe withdrew a purple potion from his waist pouch and viciously flung it at the Green Tree Sprites.* Ping-Pong! * The test tube broke, and a gust of purple misty smoke rose, turning into the shape of a harpy. The harpy opened its mouth and let out an ear piercing scream!\u201cThe Howling Witch Potion! I spent 20 Magic Crystals on it!\u201d Leylin covered both of his ears. Although he had made preparations ahead of time, he still felt uneasy. As for the Green Tree Sprites, they had all fallen to the ground long ago.Using potions to mimic the effects of a magic spell was the normal fighting technique used by a Potioneering Master. With Leylin\u2019s current abilities, he could not brew the Howling Witch Potion yet, so this potion had been bought from Kroft instead.Not only were these potions extremely expensive, they only had a one-time use, which made Leylin\u2019s heart ache.Taking advantage of the fact that the Giant Tree Demon and Green Tree Sprites were still under the effects of the Howling Witch Potion, Leylin hurriedly stepped forward and lunged at them with the cross blade.\u201cA few Green Tree Sprites were easily cut into two just like this.\u201d\u201cThe eardrums of these Green Tree Sprites are extremely strange and they are more sensitive towards sound waves. However, the Howling Witch Potion was obviously their bane!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed, and he stomped on a few more of the Green Tree Sprites who were lying on the ground until they were dead.\u201cOh! No! Julie, Delia\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Vitality of the Giant Tree Demon was extremely high and it quickly recovered from the shock caused by the Howling Witch. Looking at Leylin torturing its daughters to death, it could not help but howl loudly. More of the vines came snaking over, and the remaining Green Tree Sprites were carefully moved and kept amongst the crown of the tree.\u201cThat human\u2019s spells are extremely evil, don\u2019t come out!\u201d The huge tree\u2019s voice buzzed.\u201cA good chance!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed, and he hurriedly chanted an incantation.\u201cAcidic Aqua Shot!\u201dA green-coloured sphere appeared, and with Leylin\u2019s control, it avoided the vines and hit the left eye of the Giant Tree Demon perfectly.* Sssii! * White mist rose continuously, and green thick fluid flowed out along with the cries of the Giant Tree Demon accompanying it.After the white mist dissipated, the Giant Tree Demon\u2019s left eye was completely gone, leaving only a charred hole.\u201cI will kill you! I will kill you! Hancus will kill you!\u201dThe Giant Tree Demon trembled and the vines around it continuously weaved around, forming a net.\u201cWho are you speaking to?\u201d At this moment, Leylin had already arrived at the bottom of the tree. Its crown completely blocked the sunlight, leaving only a huge black shadow.While the Giant Tree Demon was howling, Leylin had already reached the trunk of the tree.\u201cGo and die!\u201dThe Giant Tree Demon roared, and countless vines interweaved, forming a huge green palm, making a grab at Leylin.\u201cGoodbye!\u201d Leylin laughed lightly and threw the remaining dozen or so potions at its trunk before taking flight.* Bang! * A fiery flame rose up, engulfing the Giant Tree Demon whole. What followed next was an even stronger explosion and black smoke.\u201cThe effect is indeed excellent when using ten explosive potions together. Moreover, it is even more advantageous against a tree type Tree Demon like this!\u201dAlthough Leylin ran away quickly, he was still scorched by the flames from behind. Even the hair on his head was tinged and burnt .\u201cAh!\u201d The Giant Tree Demon screamed and howled in agony, falling to the ground with a crash, its body still set ablaze.As for the Green Tree Sprites that were hiding in the treetop, they too were not spared and were all burnt to charcoal.[Beep! The target has lost all signs of life!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice sounded.Leylin nodded his head and returned to driving the horse carriage, going around the Giant Tree Demon\u2019s body.Looking at the huge branches that were charred and the corpses of those Green Tree Sprites, Leylin suddenly thought of something and went up to extract some of their cells and remnants.\u201cOnly one battle and I have already used almost half of my stockpiled potions!\u201d However, the Giant Tree Demon and Green Tree Sprites combo is a threat to even a Level 3 Acolyte. Having an outcome like this is already considered not bad!\u201dAfraid of the arrival of reinforcements, Leylin hurriedly drove the horse carriage away, until the three strong horses were frothing in the mouth. Travelling as fast as the wind, he disappeared from the horizon.Half an hour later, a grey-coloured owl swooped down and landed on top of a branch.\u201cHankus is dead!\u201d The owl let out a human\u2019s voice.\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Suddenly a human face appeared beside the tree branch, \u201cIt\u2019s a Level 2 Acolyte, should we chase after him?\u201d\u201cThe plan has already begun! This stupid tree demon totally deserves it for dying here!\u201d The owl pecked the feathers on its body.\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving first!\u201d Saying which, the owl spread its wings and flew up into the sky.The human\u2019 face turned silent for a while and then revealed a human-like smile, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s just a slave, one must still pay the price for killing my subordinates!\u201dThe branch extended to where the Giant Tree Demon lay. At this moment, the fire had already been extinguished, only leaving behind some charred wood and Green Tree Sprite corpses.Suddenly, a corpse jerked. It was actually still alive.This Green Tree Sprite was already completely charred. Without any immediate treatment it would definitely lose its life.The tree branch brought the Green Tree Sprite right in front of the human face, \u201cDo you want to seek revenge?\u201d\u201cYes! For\u2026\u2026Vengeance, Doris\u2026\u2026Is willing to pay any price, even if\u2026\u2026It means the soul!\u201d The Green Tree Sprite struggled to speak.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026Very well!\u201d The human face laughed loudly, \u201cIt just so happens that I have one potion from a previous experiment that ended up in failure. I\u2019ll use it on you then!\u201d\u2026\u2026Suddenly an opening appeared on the black-coloured tree, and it enveloped the entire Green Tree Sprite\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGrey Stone CityLeylin was unaware that there were people planning to deal with him, so he carried on driving the horse carriage and travelling rapidly.After the fifth day, when the surroundings started to show traces of human activity, he heaved a huge sigh of relief.Although Magi generally view acolytes in the same way that humans viewed ants, it couldn\u2019t be denied that they originated from normal human beings.Even though human experimentation was continued despite repeated prohibition, especially at the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, all the Magi still chose to avoid large human communities. This prevented human casualties from piling up and inciting the wrath of other Magi.\u201cOnce I reach the city up ahead, I can take a breather!\u201d After 5 days of continuous travel, Leylin and his horses were all extremely exhausted.At this moment, he lowered the speed of the horse and had a look at his surroundings.There were now loosely spread fields on either side of him, and not far away was a giant windmill.A crystal clear stream flowed beside these fields, and there were even some unknown species of fishes swimming in it.Leylin suddenly felt relaxed as he viewed this scene.\u201cSerenity! The peaceful world of humans! I have not felt tranquillity like this in a long time \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAccording to the map, the nearest city should be Grey Stone City!\u201d Leylin looked at the indicator on the map provided by the A.I. Chip in his mind.\u201cThis place is still too close to the academy. There may be a gathering point for Magi nearby, but it still looks far too dangerous to sell potions or ask about the latest news here.\u201d\u201cMoreover, I keep getting this ominous feeling!\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed as he looked behind him.\u201cWill the enemy let me go so easily after killing the Giant Tree Demon?\u201d[Beep! Transfiguration Spell analysis complete!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice sounded in his mind at that moment.\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d There was an elated expression on Leylin\u2019s face. He hurriedly read the introduction of the Transfiguration Spell.[Transfiguration Spell: Rank 0 spell. Effect: Ability to slightly reconstruct the muscles of the face for an extended period of time. Consumption: 1 Spiritual Force, 1 Magical Power a day]This was a Rank 0 spell that Leylin specifically chose for concealing his identity.\u201cCan it only change the outer appearance?\u201d Leylin muttered to himself. \u201cMany Magi can discern someone\u2019s identity through the energy waves emitted by their Spiritual Force and some can even look right into their soul. Of course, these people are all official Magi at least. Right now, it\u2019s most likely that I won\u2019t meet with any of them.\u201d\u201cA.I. Chip! Is it possible to optimise the effects of the Transfiguration and enhance the concealment of the energy waves from the Spiritual Force?\u201dLeylin asked.[Beep! Establishing Spiritual Force energy wave concealment optimisation task, beginning analysis\u2026\u2026]A dozen odd seconds later, the reply of the A.I. Chip sounded. [Able to optimise. Requires 7 Spiritual Force points. Time to completion: 14 days 5 hours. Supplemental data required: Spirit Research Studies, Obscure Runes.]\u201c7 Spiritual Force points? I can achieve that in a few years. However, the information on Spirit Research Studies and Obscure Runes will not be as easy to obtain!\u201dResearch concerning the likes of spirits has always been the most mysterious aspect of the Magus World. Although Abyssal Bone Forest Academy has a reputation for being at the forefront of this field, the academy actually only had a few superficial theories. As for Leylin, he was just a Level 2 Acolyte so he did not have access to such information.\u201cThe Transfiguration Spell should be enough for the time being.\u201d Leylin gazed at his surroundings while driving the horse carriage hurriedly into the small forest nearby.When Leylin reappeared a moment later, his appearance had changed completely.His original youthful appearance had now become rather mature. Coupled with thick eyebrows and big eyes, he possessed a very common looking face.His clothes had also changed into weather-beaten leather armour. The cross blade hanging on his waist buckle also looked older.Leylin originally had a tall stature and looked well-fed. His body was already that of the typical adult before the change. Looking at him now, he seemed like a skinny yet experienced soldier.Leylin walked to the side of the stream to get a glimpse of his reflection. \u201cEn! Not bad! Even my voice changed and I can modulate its pitch too.\u201dHis voice gradually became coarser, a drastic change from the soft, immature and youthful one from before.\u201cI will temporarily enter the city in this disguise!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and took out a leather bag. In it was some white powder.\u201cThe Scent-Removing Powder of the Subterranean Blind Worm, just 1 gram can rid any living organism of their scent completely!\u201d Leylin said softly.\u201cThis should be the ultimate disguise method in the mortal world. My appearance and scent have already changed, so it won\u2019t be easy to find me through regular means! But as for the Spiritual Force energy waves, I can\u2019t do anything about them.\u201dLeylin looked through the horse carriage again. He then threw away any unnecessary items, only keeping the chest filled with potions and spell books. He also tied the chest filled with ingredients onto one of the two horses.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Approaching the last horse, which did not carry any burden, Leylin undid its reins and whipped it.\u201cWoo!\u201d The black horse whinnied then ran in a random direction.Subsequently, Leylin went back to the horse carriage and sprinkled a kind of red powder all over it. He followed that up by sprinkling the remaining Scent-Removing Powder over the two horses. He then mounted one of the horses and rode off.Not long afterwards, black smoke appeared in the forest, followed by a blazing flame.As he continued along the main road, more and more signs of humans could be seen. After an hour, Leylin saw the silhouette of Grey Stone City.The walls of the city were short. Circular rooftops and sharp pointed grey buildings could be seen from the outside.Beside these walls were armed soldiers who were patrolling the area.\u201cState your purpose.\u201d The patrol leader wearing leather half-armour stopped Leylin.\u201cI\u2019m a mercenary, and also a merchant!\u201d Leylin smiled. He could see the greed in the patrol leader\u2019s eyes.Looking at the horse Leylin was riding and the chests behind him, the leader gulped down saliva. His eyes swept over the outfit Leylin wore. When he saw the cross blade hanging from Leylin\u2019s waist, his expression changed to one of fear.\u201cThe fee to entering is one bronze coin!\u201d\u201cHere you go!\u201d Leylin tossed over a brand new yellow bronze coin to the leader.\u201cYou may enter! Remember not to wander around at night. If you are caught doing so, you will be imprisoned!\u201d The leader revealed a very unsightly smile.\u201cThank you!\u201d Leylin brought his luggage through the city gates.\u201cLeader?\u201d A soldier was obviously unresigned.\u201cShut up!\u201d Didn\u2019t you see how he was dressed? Being able to travel solo while carrying goods and arriving in the city unscathed means he is no regular person. Who knows, he might even be a Knight!\u201d The leader growled in a low voice, \u201cNext time, don\u2019t find any trouble with these sorts of people!\u201d\u201cIt seems like no matter where it is, strength can let me pass through easily.\u201dLeylin rode into the streets of the city. He saw commoners on either side of the streets avoiding him in fear. When they looked at Leylin, their gazes held both a huge amount of fear and envy as they nodded in approval.\u201cThe development of this Grey Stone City does not seem to compare to even one of the small towns from my previous life!\u201dLeylin estimated that, at most, there were only around 10,000 inhabitants in the whole of Grey Stone City.As for its standards of living, they were even worse.The pavements were made of yellow mud and riddled with coarse sand. A slight gust of wind would cause yellow dust to swirl in the air.Most of the people on the two sides of the road were malnourished and only wore crude grey or black robes that even had a lot of jagged holes in them.Along these streets were several fences enclosing cattle or sheep. Some small-sized livestock\u00a0was even running around freely. Odour from the fresh layer of dung continually pervaded the atmosphere, with no sign of dissipating.\u201cDirty, messy, lousy!\u201d This was Leylin\u2019s first impression of Grey Stone City.\u201cLet\u2019s find a place to stay first!\u201d The journey had made him somewhat weary.Leylin did not manage to find any sort of inn even after searching for some time. In the end, he decided to spend some coppers in exchange for information regarding a place to stay from a local.\u201cBig Sword and Wine Cup. This is it.\u201d Leylin looked at the words on the signboard and was a little speechless.This family shop was situated somewhere to the west, where public order seemed to be more chaotic. Along the way, Leylin saw many drunkards and fights breaking out. A knife and dagger were even used in one instance. Despite this, there were no traces of security officers at all.Pushing the door open, the smell of an inferior wine infiltrated Leylin\u2019s nose.\u201cCome! Have another cup!\u201d \u201cNice one, Jack!\u201d A hubbub of noises constantly assaulted Leylin\u2019s eardrums.The interior was a pub of sorts. There were many drunkards guzzling drinks to their hearts content. Some were even half asleep and drunk, pawing the female hostesses and talking dirty.\u201cSir! What would you like?\u201d The bartender was a yellow-haired youth who looked like the soberest one in this pub.\u201cI heard that I could find a place to stay here?\u201dLeylin sat at the stool beside the counter.\u201cYes! We are the only establishment in the whole of Grey Stone City that provides lodging services!\u201d The bartender shrugged his shoulders, \u201cHowever, it is nothing to be proud of. We do not have many visitors here all year round!\u201d\u201cGive me a quiet room and take care of my two horses. How much is it?\u201d Leylin looked at the big barrel behind the bartender.\u201cGive me your best beer here too!\u201d Leylin tossed a silver coin over.\u201cPleased to be at your service!\u201d Very soon, the bartender brought a cup with a handle to the table, \u201cHoney Butter Liquor! Our best liquor here!\u201dLeylin sipped the liquor while listening to the bartender\u2019s introduction.In reality, many Magi did not like liquor since it could dull the senses. They preferred drinks that could raise their vigour.Leylin did not drink often either. However, his curiosity was piqued so he wanted a taste. This Honey Butter Liquor was simply average, though. It even had a tart smell, which made Leylin feel cheated.\u201cLodging here for a night would be 30 coppers and taking care of two horses, including their fodder, means an additional twenty coppers!\u201dBefore leaving the academy, Leylin had already changed some pocket change to carry with him. So now, he very forthrightly tossed two silver coins over, \u201cI\u2019ll stay here for 4 nights first\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLook! Such fine horses! This fur colour! This build! They are definitely more valuable than the battle horses in the city lord\u2019s manor!\u201dA very annoying voice was heard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His two horses seemed to have stirred up some trouble.His lips curled into a sneer as he turned around and quickly left the pub.Several local hoodlums were surrounding his black horses and sizing them up. Their gazes were marred with greed as they gazed at the spirited horses and the chests on them. One of them was actually in the act of impatiently untying the reins.\u201cAre you trying to take my belongings?\u201d Leylin strode over.He looked rather intimidating in his leather armour with his menacing cross blade hanging from his belt. But apparently it was still not enough.One of them, a cross-eyed hoodlum, shouted at him, \u201cThis is undoubtedly the horse that I lost! How come you have it? You stole it from my family, didn\u2019t you! You damned thief!\u201dThis gang of crooks thought that even though Leylin was an armed soldier, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take on their whole gang.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Capture him and bring him to see public security!\u201d The others raucously interjected.The surrounding inhabitants surreptitiously loathed what was happening. But nobody had the guts to step forward.\u201cLet\u2019s go! He\u2019s alone!\u201d Cross-Eyed drew a dagger from within his robes and led the attack.Leylin sneered, \u201cLooks like I get to loosen these creaky joints.\u201d He dodged, avoiding Cross-Eyed\u2019s piercing dagger attack. He immediately grabbed hold of Cross-Eyed\u2019s right wrist and shook it slightly. Cross-Eyed screamed in agony as the dagger fell to the floor.\u201cArgh! That hurts! What are you doing? Let go of me! My brother-in-law is a public security officer. He won\u2019t let you get away with this!\u201d Cross-Eyed wailed in pain.\u201cOh really? Public security officer? I\u2019m so scared!\u201d Leylin cried exaggeratedly, and then he twisted viciously.* Crack! * The piercing sound of breaking bones was heard. Cross-Eyed fainted right away from the excruciating pain.At this moment, Leylin\u2019s physical power had already reached the Knight stage. Against these hoodlums, he naturally did not have to exert much effort.\u201cBoss! Boss!\u201d The rest of the hoodlums shouted, but none of them dared approach.Leylin smiled. He turned into a black shadow and dove right into their midst.* Bang! Crack! Argh! *The pitiful cries of the hoodlums and the gut wrenching sound of bones being crushed could be heard continuously. Leylin was like a black gust of wind. In a few moves, he knocked them all onto the ground, each one sporting a broken arm or a broken leg.Leylin smiled amiably at them and walked towards the spot that Cross-Eyed had fainted at. He raised his foot and stomped viciously on the boss\u2019s right leg.\u201cArgh!\u201d Very soon, the pain jolted him awake. Both his eyes rolled around, and then he fainted once again.\u201cTake your boss away! You can call on me anytime if you want revenge. But if you ever do, it won\u2019t be as simple as getting a broken arm or a broken leg!\u201dLeylin said to the hoodlums. In their eyes, his smile was like that of a devil\u2019s.After seeing these hoodlums scampering away, Leylin returned to the bar.\u201cAt the least, he has the physical power of a Preparatory Knight!\u201d The bartender groaned inwardly as he put on an even gentler and humbler expression.\u201cMy most respected sir! Is there anything I can do for you?\u201dSeeing the deathly quiet that loomed over the pub, Leylin couldn\u2019t help but inwardly smile with bitterness.He did not want to be seen as a monster. However, he had brought many goods along with him, so what could he do if someone were to steal them when he was in the room? Although he left a Tracing Spell on his belongings, if the spell were to disappear, Leylin wouldn\u2019t even have a place to cry.However, after Leylin displayed the strength of a Preparatory Knight, many of those who had some malicious intent towards him quietly retreated.\u201cHelp me bring these chests to my room, put my horses in the stable and give them the best fodder you have!\u201d Leylin said as he tossed another silver coin at the bartender.\u201cThat hoodlum from earlier, what kind of background does he has?\u201dThe bartender lowered his head, \u201cSir, you completely don\u2019t have to worry about it. He may have some shady dealings with a public security officer but nothing too serious, though.\u201dHaving the strength of a Preparatory Knight means having access to a Knight\u2019s training technique.Such people are either nobility or have some huge power backing them. A small city\u2019s public security officer will not dare to do anything at all.\u201cTake me to my room!\u201d Leylin asked casuallyThe bartender intentionally took him to a room at the very back of the building, furthest from the pub. He took out a key and opened the room.A ray of golden sunlight shone through the window into the roomThe bed was in the middle of the room, and the bed sheets on it seemed to be very clean. There was a blue vase on the bedside table with some unknown wildflowers in them.\u201cIt seems very clean. This place will be fine!\u201d Leylin nodded.\u201cHere is your key, please keep it safe!\u201d The bartender respectfully handed over a brass key.Leylin took the key and sent the bartender away to take care of his horses. He unpacked the contents of the chests and ordered a steak to be sent to his room. After he telling the bartender not to disturb him, he closed the door.As he closed the wooden door, he found the room\u2019s noise cancellation effects to be rather good. The noises from outside were greatly reduced.\u201cMy actions today were a little too eye-catching! I didn\u2019t have a choice though. Grey Stone City is too small, the activities of any stranger will definitely arouse unwanted attention. However, it is still much safer to be behind city walls. People will, at least, think twice before casting large area-of-effect spells!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, there is a 50-50 chance of the faction which sent people to block the path sending someone after me. It\u2019ll be best if they haven\u2019t. If not, I must definitely kill the next wave of pursuers so I can get away cleanly.\u201dLeylin was deep in thought, \u201cThe Spiritual Force energy waves and the spirit sent to follow the trail look like the doings of an official Magus. But this seems like a waste of resources. Afterall, who would send an official Magus to track down and kill a Level 2 Acolyte?\u201d\u201cThe greatest possibility is a Level 3 Acolyte with a Magic Artifact or some pet reared by a Magus!\u201d\u201cI should recuperate and remain observant of any activities that are happening while preparing to get rid of the enemy! I also need to cast the Transfiguration Spell daily!\u201dLeylin thought as he brought a piece of the piping hot steak that he ordered to his mouth.The steak\u2019s flavour was not bad and Leylin, who was famished, ate it all up in the blink of an eye. When he was done, he asked the bartender to clean up the mess. After the bartender left, Leylin hung a wooden \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 sign outside his door and set up a layer of energy particles to act as an early warning alarm system before falling into a deep meditative state.Meditation is something a Magus has to do regularly. Although the increase in Spiritual Force from this is rather small, Leylin still persevered each and every day.After toiling for over an hour, Leylin\u2019s head slumped and he entered into slumberland.\u2026\u2026Outside Grey Stone City, in the air above the scorched woods.* Pss Pss! * A green coloured winged creature suddenly swooped down.\u201cDoris has finally caught a whiff of the enemy\u2019s scent!\u201d The Green Tree Sprite Doris retracted its wings and stepped onto the burnt wood with its bare skin with a puzzled expression.\u201cThis is where the scent ends.\u201d At this moment, the Green Tree Sprite no longer had the same appearance as before.Previously, It had merely been the size of a human head. However, Doris was now as big as a 7 or 8-year-old child.Moreover, the originally pretty face now had layer upon layer of warts marring it. It looked extremely repulsive.Its mouth was filled with fangs, and its tongue constantly flickered like a snake\u2019s.Its body now had many creases, as well as some strange looking scales.Originally, Green Tree Sprites were a kind of living creature that represented extreme beauty. Now, no one would link Doris with the Green Tree Sprites.Doris let out a yell filled with hatred, \u201cHuman, you won\u2019t be able to escape!\u201d Its tongue flickered. It suddenly spread its wings and flew towards the additional horse that Leylin had released.In the next two days, Leylin stayed inside, finally recovering his strength and Spiritual Force back to its peak.\u201cIt has been two days already, and they still have not caught up! It seems like it\u2019s not an acolyte chasing me or they would have used magic to sniff me out by now! It\u2019s probably some slave or creature reared by the Magus!\u201dLeylin surmised. His movements had been extremely quiet these two days. The only noteworthy event was when the public security officer brought gifts as he paid Leylin a visit. The officer said that he was there to plead for his wife\u2019s younger brother. He then tried to ask about Leylin\u2019s past, but Leylin only deceived him and did not reveal any information at all.Later, Leylin changed into black robes and pulled up the hood to cover his face as he jumped out of the window.In a gloomy and dark alley.\u201cSir!\u201d \u201cSir, you\u2019re here!\u201d A few hoodlums, upon seeing Leylin\u2019s black robes, immediately came forward to receive him.\u201cHow is it? Have there been any strange happenings around Grey Stone City these past few days?\u201d said a hoarse voice from under the black robes.\u201cI\u2019ll speak first, I\u2019ll speak first! In the nearby village, Auntie Sofia\u2019s cow gave birth to a two-headed calf. The others all said that it was cursed!\u201dThis was what the hoodlum, who pushed the others away, hurriedly said.[The target\u2019s blood flow has increased by 12.4%. His brain waves appear to be stable. Judgement: It\u2019s not a lie!] The A.I. Chip intoned inside his head.Leylin nodded his head and tossed a silver coin to the hoodlum.\u201cIt\u2019s my turn now, Uncle Hugo and his son disappeared in the nearby woods while travelling! And traces of a wolf pack have been discovered at the scene!\u201d\u2026\u2026These were the hoodlums that Leylin had subdued over the past two days. They were extremely convenient for gathering news.At first, they tried to give false information to get the reward, but how could Leylin be fooled by an average human like them with the A.I. Chip to help him? He immediately broke the arms of the liar on the spot, shocking everyone present at the time.Under the coercion of both money and the threat of violence, these hoodlums were very soon, faithfully reporting all the news happening in and around Grey Stone City.\u201cWhat did you say, human corpses were discovered? There were also traces of thick green fluids?\u201d Leylin was obviously interested, \u201cSpeak clearly and this gold coin is yours!\u201dA skinny red-haired youth gulped down his saliva, \u201cThis is news I just heard. In the mill beside Messi Village, a few corpses were discovered. All the blood had been sucked dry. Everyone suspects this to be the work of a vampire. The city lord even sent several Knights to investigate!\u201d\u201cEn! Very good!\u201d Leylin asked for the location again and realised that the area was very close to where he had last erased his tracks. He nodded his head and gave the gold coin to the youth. After listening to the rest of the news, he left the alley.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chip\u2019s calculations, the creature sucking the blood of others might be after me!\u201d\u201cMoreover, it\u2019s tracking me down by smell! Their numbers are unknown, but they shouldn\u2019t exceed two, or there might actually be just one!\u201dPreviously, Leylin got rid of his scent using the Scent- Masking Powder and changed his appearance before he entered the city. He wanted to use the mixed scents of people to conceal his. He would then gather sufficient information about the enemy before planning a counterattack.Now, it seemed to have paid off pretty well.\u201cWhat a pity! My Scent-Masking Powder is almost used up, if not, I would have been able to leave here long ago!\u201d Leylin surmised regretfully.The Subterranean Blind Worm was a rather rare ingredient used by the Magi, and its price was never cheap. Leylin had spent quite a lot to obtain a small packet of the ingredient before refining it into a Scent-Masking Powder.However, he had enough for only about 3 or 4 days. Within such a short period, he could not possibly run far. Once the enemy expands the range of detection, his traces would definitely be discovered.\u201cIt\u2019s better to settle this as soon as possible. If they chase me to my destination, then that wouldn\u2019t do me any good!\u201dLeylin\u2019s face became solemn.Even now, the effects of the powder were wearing off. He was relying more and more on the complicated mix of smells in the city to mask his scent. Alas, the unknown creatures were still able to trace him even after all he did.After returning to his room, Leylin casually sat on the bed and mentally called up the A.I. Chip.\u201cA.I. Chip! In accordance with the news obtained during these past two days, simulate the enemy\u2019s movement patterns, and design a plan for killing them!\u201d[Beep! Establishing mission parameters, beginning simulation\u2026\u2026Map imported\u2026\u2026The Host\u2019s battle strength imported, analysis in progress\u2026\u2026\u201d]The A.I. Chip\u2019s icy cold and unfeeling mechanical voice intoned within his mind.The A.I. Chip was a tool specifically allocated to scientists in his previous world, so how could it have the intelligence or even emotions? Due to human rights concerns, they had forbidden A.I. Chips from manifesting intelligence and emotion as a core directive in its programming.[Simulation complete. Host kills the target but will sustain light injuries. Success rate: 67.7%]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned while transmitting a large amount of information into Leylin\u2019s mind.\u201cSustain injuries?\u201d Leylin stroked his chin, \u201cAre there any possibilities of killing the target unscathed?\u201d[Insufficient Data! Requires more detailed information on the target!]\u201cSo it\u2019s like this,\u201d Leylin shook his head. According to the news he got from the hoodlums, the creature outside the city was already in an enraged mood and had started attacking the locals. At this rate, it would definitely charge into the city within 24 hours.Although there was a mutual accord among the Magi to not disrupt the lives of the regular humans, there were still some who were crazy enough to do so.If massive casualties resulted, and his identity was discovered, Leylin had to take responsibility for the collateral damages, aside from taking into consideration the creatures and the Magi behind them. This was a problem that he clearly did not want.\u201c67.7%, this is enough for me to take my chances! I also have confidence in being able to retreat fully!\u201d Vehemence marked Leylin\u2019s countenance as he walked out.The pub\u2019s atmosphere remained as boisterous as ever. Upon seeing Leylin, the bartender went forward and bowed, \u201cSir, do you have any instructions?\u201d\u201cHelp me find a person\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin spoke slowly and made his request.\u201cNo problem! Although there aren\u2019t any mercenaries of the sort in this city, there are bandits here. I can contact them on your behalf.\u201dThe bartender said, \u201cBy the way, Lord Roland, the city\u2019s lord, sent men over. He wishes to meet you, sir!\u201d\u201cThe city\u2019s lord?\u201d Leylin nodded his head. No matter where a Preparatory Knight went, they would always be warmly greeted and received by lords. If Roland were to know of Leylin\u2019s status as an acolyte, the treatment would be even grander.\u201cI have something on right now. How about we change to meeting time to the day after tomorrow?\u201d Leylin enquired.\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cAlso, the steak that you guys have here isn\u2019t bad, send a serving of it to my room tonight.\u201d Leylin instructed once again.\u201cAs you wish!\u201d The bartender smiled.\u2026\u2026The second day, late in the night.A grey robed figure appeared in the charred woodland nearby.\u201cInvestigate? What is there to investigate here? There aren\u2019t any treasures here. Most likely this was caused by some careless farmer, which resulted in this area going up in a blaze!\u201dThe grey robed man was quite skinny. His movements, though, were rather swift as he continuously rummaged through the piles of charred wood.\u201cSomething isn\u2019t right! These scorch marks were not done by normal flames!\u201d The man\u2019s brows furrowed. His experience as a bandit made him realise something obviously wasn\u2019t right just by looking at the scorch marks.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026 Seems to be the doings of mysterious entities.\u201d The bandit\u2019s hair stood on end. As a member of the underground activities, he had only heard of these entities in myths. These stories emphasised the most important things about them: their mysteriousness, their cold-heartedness, and that they were not to be made enemies of!\u201cI\u2019d better hurry and leave! If I knew this mission was linked to these mysterious entities, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted it even if the rewards were dozen-fold!\u201dThe grey robed man trembled and wanted to leave.\u201cI found it. The smell of my enemy!\u201d At this moment, a hoarse and repugnant voice sounded from behind.The bandit\u2019s body shivered. He saw an abomination, the size of a child, floating in midair.Its body was strewn with scales in a disorderly fashion. Its face was full of warts. From time to time, its snake-like tongue hissed out.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that even the devil wouldn\u2019t be as ugly as this!\u201d The bandit thought as he jumped back by 5 metres.\u201cI should have thought of this before! I have actually turned into bait!\u201d The bandit shouted.\u201cDon\u2019t think about leaving!\u201d Doris spat its tongue out and flew above the bandit, almost immediately with just a few flaps of its wings.\u201cWe can talk about this! I have a lot of information on this mission\u2019s principal!\u201d The bandit yelled in despair.\u201cDie!\u201dDoris\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. It did not care about the pleas and screams of the bandit. Immediately, it chewed on the right arm that was waving the dagger about and fed voraciously on the bandit\u2019s blood.A few minutes later, only the bandit\u2019s shrivelled corpse remained.\u201cA scent lingers on his robes! That damned acolyte is definitely in the city!\u201d Doris squinted at the silhouette of the city walls.* Xiu! *A black arrow zoomed past. A boom was heard as it went supersonic, directly piercing Doris\u2019 chest.\u201cThe last of the Scent-Masking Powder was wasted here. I even sprinkled some paralysis powder on the bandit\u2019s body. I don\u2019t believe that this arrow won\u2019t hit its target!\u201dFrom behind some tall shrubs, Leylin emerged wearing a leather armour and carrying the crossbow he had just used.\u201cEnemy!\u201d Doris\u2019 face twitched. Its originally repulsive face now even showed veins bulging from it. It was a sight that would definitely make children cry.\u201cEven I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the one chasing me was the Green Tree Sprite from before! This originally beautiful creature has now turned into something like this!\u201d Leylin was a little shocked.[Mutated Green Tree Sprite. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 4.3, Vitality: 3.5, Spiritual Force: 5.5. Abilities unknown!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned the readings and situation over.\u201cIts attributes were actually raised by this much! What an astonishing spell. However, its body\u2019s unstable condition can slowly be seen on its surface. It is unlikely to survive more than half a month.\u201d Leylin eyes flashed coldly.\u201cThe enemy who murdered my father and sisters! Even if Doris had to betray its soul, Doris will avenge them!\u201dDoris howled as it yanked the arrow out of its chest. A puddle of green liquid gushed out of the wound.The green liquid quickly covered the whole chest., A plant root could be seen extending continuously and very soon the wound was suppressed.\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Doris charged at Leylin in a green blur.\u201cIt actually went through so much mutation that melee attacks are no longer effective?\u201d Leylin nodded his head and snapped his fingers.\u201cPa!\u201dSuddenly, a mud ball rose from the ground, blocking Doris\u2019s path. Its contents were revealed to be crimson coloured potions.* Bang! * A flame rose up. The accompanying heat wave even scorched the nearby vegetation.The flames engulfed Doris and the crackling sound of something being barbequed was heard.* Hu! * A green figure emerged from the sea of flames. Its body was scorched black. It even still had the fire burning on it as it charged towards Leylin.[Target\u2019s speed reduced by 67%!] Chimed the A.I. Chip.\u201cIt was first affected by the paralysis powder, and then injured by the explosive potions. Even if it specialises in fire resistance, it will definitely still receive damage!\u201dLeylin\u2019s face was calm. He threw away the crossbow and then drew his cross blade as he charged forward.\u201cCross Slash!\u201d The silver cross blade shone. This time, Leylin even circulated his ignited internal Knight energy. The sharp blade reflected a glimmer of light.When the cross figure directly struck the Green Tree Sprite, immediately a pool of green liquid appeared.Doris toppled, and Leylin stopped advancing. He looked at the cross blade in his hands and his brows furrowed.The silver blade was already filled with bumpy spots where the various liquid from Doris\u2019s body splashed.\u201cEven its bodily fluid has a strong corrosive effect? This cross blade is ruined!\u201d Leylin felt a little rueful. This cross blade had been taken from a noble youth while in the travelling party. It was extremely handy to use, but he never thought that it would be destroyed here.He threw away the cross blade. As he looked at Doris who was still trying to charge over despite the cross slash on its chest, Leylin quickly chanted an incantation.\u201cUmbra\u2019s Hand!\u201dA black-coloured palm rose from Doris\u2019 shadow. It grabbed hold of its ankles and kept them firmly on the ground.* Sssi Sssi! * A layer of white mist rose from the black-coloured palm.\u201cAlthough Umbra\u2019s Hand has a corrosive effect, it seems like, against the mutated Green Tree Sprite, it is still somewhat lacking! Leylin\u2019s mind quickly worked out the situation.\u201cI\u2019ll use you as a guinea pig for my newly learnt spell!\u201d\u201cThe sound of the azure thunder! Listen to my command! Descend to the mortal realm and strike my foes down!\u201d (Byron Language)As Leylin voiced his incantation, silvery-blue lightning suddenly appeared in his hands.\u201cGo!\u201d Leylin pointed his fingers and dazzling lightning flew towards Doris in an arc.\u201cDoris is not afraid of death!\u201d At this moment, Doris stretched its hands forward, and its palm split open. From it, a tree root-like object extended out.* Xiu! * The tree roots entwined and assumed the shape of a bow. A brown coloured arrow was already loaded onto it.\u201cNot good!\u201d Leylin hurriedly dodged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Warning! Warning! High bacteria concentration on the arrowhead, recommend immediate disinfection of the affected area!]\u201cDamn it!\u201d Leylin hurriedly pulled out the arrow and took a silver dagger from his robes. Gritting his teeth, he gouged out the flesh surrounding the wound.He hurriedly retrieved a green coloured potion from his waist pouch and poured half of it onto the wound. The other half he emptied into his mouth. Only after hearing the A.I. Chip\u2019s voice, [Crisis under control], did he heave a sigh of relief.When Leylin was struck by the arrow, Doris had also been struck by the lightning, and had fallen down, crashing onto the ground.At this moment, Doris\u2019s whole body was charred and its wings were more than half broken.. One of her hands had vanished without any trace of it left behind, and her ankle was still grasped by the Umbra\u2019s Hand spell. Her life force had dropped to a dangerous level. She could die at any moment.\u201cRevenge! My revenge!\u201d Doris unconsciously kept muttering those words. Suddenly its eyes flashed coldly, and it bit off its own right leg.* Pa! * The leg flew in the air. The Umbra\u2019s Hand, which was holding onto the ankle, disappeared quickly as well.\u201cLet\u2019s die together!\u201dDoris\u2019s whole body inflated. Warts on its face vibrated. Her speed tripled as she charged directly at Leylin.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Leylin pressed down on his shoulder wound and hastily retreated. At the same time, he threw out the last explosive potion.* Bang! * An intense explosion reverberated.Red flames and green liquid mixed together. It let off a dark green firelight.Leylin rolled back several times before he could finally escape the blast radius.At this moment, the surroundings were showered with a bunch of green-coloured bones and flesh. It was utterly repulsive.\u201cEh?\u201d Looking at the green-coloured remains on the ground, Leylin saw that a yellow fluid swiftly flowed out, continuously corroding the ground. His expression involuntarily changed, and he hurriedly inspected his body.A few drops of thick fluid had unknowingly corroded his leather armour and opened several wounds on his body. Around each of these wounds was a patch of yellow that was beginning to numb that area.[Host is suffering from an unknown secondary pathogenic infection.

Chip, generate the method for immediate suppression!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face darkened.[Cauterising the wound with a flame will be effective in reducing the rate of infection!] The A.I. Chip responded.\u201cA flame?\u201d Leylin ripped his clothes and casually picked up a burning branch as he placed the glowing flame on his wound.* Sssii! * The sound of something being barbecue was heard accompanied by the smell of charring flesh. Leylin\u2019s face contorted in pain.Minutes later, the A.I. Chip pronounced the treatment effective. Leylin put away the fire and sat limply on the ground panting, cold sweat dripping all over his body.\u201cThe enemy this time was extremely dangerous! Its resistance towards physical and flame attacks was extremely high. Its speed was also fast, and it had a poison attack. It seems to have been prepared specifically against me. If not for the A.I. Chip, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u2026\u201dDoris\u2019 body fluids, containing the secondary infection from the arrow\u2019s poison, were something that the A.I. Chip had not factored in. This made Leylin, who expected only mild injuries from the encounter, suffer such a wretched victory.\u201cOn top of that, the explosive potions that I had prepared have all been used! I have to prepare more ingredients again!\u201dThe past few battles, Leylin had highly relied on potions to defeat his enemies. However, the consumption was also huge, and he threw away close to a thousand Magic Crystals in value.Fortunately, he knew how to brew explosive potions; if not, the cost would have skyrocketed even higher.\u201cFlame can only temporarily constrain the spreading of the pathogen. I have to buy the necessary ingredients to cure it completely!\u201d Leylin looked at his charred wound, his brows furrowed as he gulped down another Strength Potion before picking himself up and heading back to Grey Stone City.This was a huge disturbance. It was very likely that the city\u2019s guards already sensed that something was amiss and would very soon send someone over to inspect.Leylin endured the intense pain and sneaked back inside Grey Stone City. He stealthily took out his chest, not bothering to even bring his two horses along with him. After stealing a light brown coloured horse outside the city walls, he escaped under the cover of night. He was headed towards the Magus market located on the map.As for the summons of the city lord, it was only natural that he ignored it completely.\u2026\u2026A dozen odd days later, on the way to Wolkan Province, a light brown coloured horse could be seen carrying two huge chests with a black robed figure astride its back. The horse was panting heavily as its four hoofs dashed across the ground.\u201cA.I. Chip! Show me my current status!\u201d Leylin\u2019s body which moved up and down with the horse\u2019s movement, thought inwardly.[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte, Knight. Strength: 1.3(2.5), Agility: 1.5(2.7), Vitality: 1.0(3.0), Spiritual Force: 4.1(4.4), Magical Power: 4.0. Status: Host is in a weakened state due to infection from the pathogen]\u201cAlthough the pathogen was inhibited, it has been a dozen odd days since then. My body is still in a weak condition. Only my Spiritual Force has increased again- this must be due to the result of constant meditation!\u201dLeylin looked at his stats and smiled bitterly.Right now he had a completely new face. He had changed from an icy cold soldier into an extremely dashing golden-haired blue eyed westerner. His face, however, was devoid of colour.\u201cA.I. Chip! Project the mind map!\u201d Leylin looked at the little information he had compiled superimposed onto an extremely detailed map.\u201cFrom Bicky\u2019s intelligence gathering, there should be a gathering area for Magi nearby. There, I will be able to buy ingredients to treat this infection!\u201dBased on half a month of probing and simulation, Leylin surmised that the opponent had only dispatched Doris. Due to the official war with Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, nobody could be bothered with a lowly Level 2 Acolyte like himself. This was a great piece of news.\u201cI can probably even make inquiries about the current situation in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d Leylin made up his mind and left the main road. He quickly found a spot, took out his tent and tools, and went about setting up camp.\u201cThis area seems a little desolate. However, it\u2019s only normal. Magus activities always steer clear of human communities as much as possible. Moreover, the radiation from a Magus is not something that regular humans can withstand.\u201dLeylin sprinkled some white powder around the tent area to prevent bugs and beasts from approaching. He then picked up a metal pan, poured some stream water into it, and lit a bonfire.Just as the stream water began to boil, Leylin emerged from the trees and threw some mushrooms and other plants into it.A moment later, after adding some spices and a few strips of jerky, a fresh fragrance of food permeated the air.Leylin scooped a bowl for himself. The soup base was white in colour. It felt extremely comforting to drink it while it was hot.Leylin sighed in contentment, \u201cAs expected, food that\u2019s hot is the best. I could almost puke from constantly eating biscuits and jerky.\u201dThe surroundings were dotted with wildflowers, and there was also the sound made by an unknown bird; its cry was much similar to that of a skylark.\u201cIf not for my injury, this would have been perfect!\u201d Leylin finished his meat broth, and adjusted his robes.Under his clothes, a charred area of flesh had a layer of fine hair growing around it looking like hair on one\u2019s head, which creeped people out.\u201cOver there, kill him!\u201dSigns of movement came from the trees nearby. Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed. The shouting gradually became closer. He had a feeling that trouble had come knocking once more.The bushes nearby split apart as a large guy protecting a nobly dressed young lady rushed out.When the large guy saw Leylin, he was shocked. He never expected someone had set up camp here. He said with a bitter smile at Leylin, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll also be implicated in this.\u201d\u201cOver there, don\u2019t let him escape!\u201d A group of armed soldiers in leather armour rushed over. The leader wore an extremely beautiful chainmail.\u201cThis outfit does not seem like something mercenaries or adventurers would wear. These people are most likely the personal retainers of some nobility which is even more troublesome!\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed.According to the A.I. Chip\u2019s scan, this large guy was obviously injured but still had the strength of a Preparatory Knight.As for the pursuers, the leader was at Knight Level, whereas the soldiers behind were just a little stronger than the average human.\u201cWho are you?\u201d The leader looked at Leylin.\u201cI\u2019m just an innocent bystander, please continue and don\u2019t bother about me. I haven\u2019t seen anything today!\u201d Leylin continued drinking his meat broth.This casual vibe obviously made the private squad leader apprehensive since the large guy and young lady stood on the other side.\u201cPlease save us! We are the descendants of Viscount Barrett. If you were to lend us a helping hand, I will definitely remember your kindness, and you will forever have the friendship of the Barrett Family!\u201dThe young lady had a pair of mesmerising blue eyes. At this moment her face had a pleading expression that would most likely move the majority of noble male youths to impulsively swear to fight for her honour.\u201cMiss Lanning, the Viscount only asks for you to return. Please do not resist!\u201d The leader told the young lady.\u201cThat underhanded and despicable worm, he covets the possessions of my family and poisoned my father to his death. Even if I die I will not go back!\u201dThe young lady poured all of her problems out in one go, sneaking a glance at Leylin from time to time. Although her movements were extremely well concealed, Leylin still saw through it.\u201cIt seems like a struggle of inheritance by a descendant who has failed. By purposefully revealing this conflict, you want to drag me down into this huh?\u201d Leylin shook his head.\u201cViscount Sire has not done any of the things you claim. As for the inheritance, it is to be decided after the meeting with the nobles!\u201dThe leader exclaimed loudly.\u201cI have proof on my body!\u201d The young lady snarled.\u201cQuick, bring Missy home!\u201d The leader seemed prepared to not negotiate any further.A few of the commoner troops brandishing their knives and swords charged forward. The large guy roared and shielded the noble young lady.The large guy\u2019s strength was obviously not bad. Even though he was injured, he still made 5 of these soldiers pay with their lives.The commoner troops went forward to chop and retrieve the head of the large guy. They then tied the screaming noble young lady up and only then did the leader who had been wary of Leylin give him a suspicious glance.\u201cIt looks like we have been bothering you! Let\u2019s go!\u201dThe leader said as he turned around and prepared to leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then why are you still wielding your sword?\u201dLeylin rose up slowly.\u201cThe secrets of our Sire cannot be heard by anyone else!\u201d The leader brandishes his sword slowly. \u201cMoreover, the wounds on your body is the reason why you cannot lend a hand!\u201d\u201cCough cough\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin coughed feebly, \u201cAccurate discernment! Seems like you have resolved to kill me today? I swear never to reveal a word of today\u2019s matter!\u201d\u201cOnly the dead will keep secrets!\u201d The leader shouted as he slashed at Leylin, his sword reflecting a snow white glint.Leylin dodged in a rather miserable manner.The leader\u2019s expression became elated, the muscles on his body bulged, but just as he was about to charge forward, his complexion suddenly changed and he retreated several steps.Behind him the soldiers and the young lady collapsed weakly onto the ground. Only their eyes could still move. \u201cYou actually poisoned us!\u201d The leader snarled in shock.\u201cAs expected of a Knight, you actually have the strength to withstand it!\u201d Leylin nodded his head. Although with his strength now he could completely massacre this crowd, if there was a more convenient method available, why shouldn\u2019t one use it instead?The leader threw down his long blade and turned to flee. His speed was actually similar to that of a regular human.\u201cUnder a poisoned state, and yet still having this speed. This is rather remarkable.\u201d Leylin assessed indifferently.He raised the crossbow, \u201cA.I. Chip! Calculate wind speed and humidity! Adjust trajectory!\u201d* Xiu! * A black line pierced through the Knight\u2019s chest. When he saw the arrow that entered from his back and exited his chest bringing blood along with it, fell down with a look of disbelief.Leylin strode to where the young lady was and towered above her. He stared down then tossed the contents of a bag of powder into her mouth. A moment later, the young lady stood up and stretched her limbs.\u201cYou are\u2026\u2026 a Magus?\u201d The young lady looked at Leylin as her eyes filled with curiosity.\u201cNo! Just a Potioneering Master. Shift them all over here and take care of them!\u201d Leylin pointed at the fallen soldiers on the ground.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d The young lady pursed her lips, but she still shifted the paralysed soldiers over. She even moved the Knight leader and the large guy\u2019s corpse over too.Afterwards, the young lady\u2019s eyes flashed coldly. She took out a dagger from her robes and stabbed all of these paralysed soldiers to death.Throughout the whole process, Leylin watched on frostily, as the young lady stabbed her pursuers to death.\u201cYou are definitely a Magus!\u201d The young lady said confidently.\u201cAs long as you help me with my revenge, I will hand over all my prized possessions to you. This includes the inheritance of a Magus. And I also will belong to you!\u201dThe girl said as she unfastened her robes.\u201cAre you sure that there is a Magus inheritance in your family?\u201d Leylin was rather amused as he asked.\u201cI swear it upon the honour of my family!\u201d The young lady\u2019s expression was staunch.[Scanning in process! Target\u2019s bloodflow is rapidly increasing. Unusual brainwave activity detected. Conclusion: Lie \u2013 93.3%]Looking at the conclusion of the A.I. Chip, Leylin shook his head.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The young lady was obviously shocked, \u201cYou don\u2019t fancy me? I have a lot of prized possessions in my family, you can have anything you like\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCould it be that you have read too many tales about knights in shining armour?\u201d Leylin interrupted her speech.\u201cIn a dense forest, an adventurer chanced upon a princess who was fleeing, and even helped her seek revenge. After overcoming a series of adversities. They triumphed over their enemies. The adventurer obtained the treasures, the love and the admiration of the princess. From then on, they lived happily ever after!\u201dLeylin recited it in a poetic, bard-like manner.\u201cIt\u2019s merely an empty illusory, full of false promise. At most, I\u2019ll obtain your body and flesh then I have to help you seek revenge against a Viscount who has the backing of a huge faction. Do I look like an idiot to you?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201dThe young lady was obviously still struggling.\u201cGet lost!\u201d Leylin bellowed.The young lady got up helplessly. A malicious and poisonous gaze flashed in her eyes, as she prepared to leave.\u201cWait!\u201d After the young lady walked for several steps, Leylin\u2019s voice travelled over.The young lady, looking gleeful, turned around.* Xiu! * An arrow bore through the beautiful face of the young lady, and pinned her to the tree right behind her.\u201cActually I could have let you go, but I saw a malicious and raging intent in your eyes!\u201d Leylin gradually sighed. \u201cTo a person who had always protected and followed you, you did not even bother to bury his corpse before leaving. From this it can be seen that you are a brazen ingrate.\u201d\u201cMoreover, to get your revenge, you contemplated some sort of \u00a0reprisal against me. You will definitely announce this matter today to everyone. Although I am not afraid of trouble, I detest such inconveniences very much\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWith these many reasons, why would I still let you go?\u201dLeylin pulled out the arrow and heaped the corpse of the young lady, who died with a grievance, together with the others.From his bag he withdrew a yellow coloured potion, and poured it on the wound of a corpse. * Sssii! * Soon, the corpse putrefied into a puddle of yellow viscous liquid.Leylin did the same thing for the rest of the corpses, destroying them all completely.Moments later, the area surrounding the camp, had only a puddle of yellow water left. The large guy, the young lady and the pursuing soldiers, all of them, had disappeared with nary a trace.These potions that could putrefy corpses, and the paralysis powder- all were Leylin\u2019s inventions, done when he was bored. Although they do not have much effect against a Magus, or even an acolyte, it was still extremely effective against normal humans.\u201cRight now, the most important thing still is to get enough ingredients to treat my wounds. Anything else would just be an inconvenience!\u201dLeylin sighed, \u201cWhat a waste of a newly erected campground.\u201dLeylin packed his things once more, and erased any sign of his existence, before disappearing into the woods.\u2026\u2026Nighttime, on the outskirts of a densely packed forest.A figure, fully draped in black robes and even had on a conical bamboo hat to conceal its face, appeared.\u201cLost Forest, it\u2019s here!\u201d Leylin took in his surroundings and compared it again with his map. Without turning around, he entered the darkness.His leather shoes stepped on the dried twigs, which let out a * Chi-Chi * sound. In the darkness, it sounded even eerier than normal.\u201cA.I. Chip, initiate area scan!\u201d[Beep! Slight illusionary field discovered! Field Effect: Regular humans who enter will be baffled, walk around in circles, and eventually leave unknowingly.]\u201cIndeed, no wonder there are tales of ghosts and demons in here. There are often news about humans going missing.\u201d Although they were under the illusion, if any Magus met an unsuspecting victim, they wouldn\u2019t mind having another sampling for their experiments.\u201cHello! Acolyte! Welcome to the Magus Market!\u201dA black figure leapt down lightly from atop a tree and landed on a broken gravestone. Its eyes were gleaming with a dark green light.Leylin walked closer, and discovered it to be a black cat.\u201cA Magus\u2019 companion? A modulated organism? Or the result of a spell?\u201d Leylin thought inwardly. He then bowed slightly.\u201cI am a wandering acolyte who heard that the market here is open to any Magus, is that correct?\u201d\u201cIndeed, this market is governed by the mighty Walker Family. Moreover, it promises that every Magus who enters will be ensured safety and protection. Of course, that is only within the perimeters of the market!\u201d The black cat licked its paws as it let off a human-like snigger.\u201cThen, I wish to enter!\u201d\u201cAll acolytes have to pay a fee of 1 Magic Crystal! It\u2019s free for all Magi!\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d Leylin nodded his head, and tossed over a low grade Magic Crystal over.The black cat caught it in its mouth, turned around and while leaping away from the gravestone, it made a beckoning gesture towards Leylin.Leylin shrugged and followed it.The further in they got, the denser the white mist became. However there was a road under their feet that seemed to be specially constructed before.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Along with the black cat\u2019s voice, the mist ahead dissipated and boisterous clamouring sounds could be heard. This made Leylin feel like \u00a0he had returned to his academy\u2019s Trading Area.The only difference was that the people here were all tightly wrapped in cloaks or grey robes, not revealing any piece of their skin at all.Occasionally, some did not bother about concealing their identity, which made Leylin broaden his horizons.In here were some Marine species who had scales on them, and Half-Beastmen who had fur on their necks. They were different from Beastmen, since they were rather a loving and affectionate of species. There Magi could be produced too, and Leylin even saw a Magus with the head of an owl.A large number of these people also exuded the energy waves of acolytes, but Leylin felt that their aura reeked of blood.\u201cAlthough the acolytes in the outside world do not have a firm foundation compared to those in the academies, they are able to advance in an environment where resources are scarce. Their experiences must be bountiful, and they even may be more adept at fighting!\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart sank.The potions in his hands were almost consumed, and right now he was at the most a stronger acolyte amongst the Level 2 Acolytes, having barely enough strength for self-preservation. If he were to reveal the potions he was carrying, these acolytes would swarm around him like crocodiles and rip him to shreds.Lowering his head, he found that the black cat had vanished completely.\u201cSir! Do you need a guide? I only ask for 1 Magic Crystal!\u201d A rather skinny little boy ran over.He had the energy waves of a Level 1 Acolyte coming from his body., Even though his face was extremely thin, his eyes were very lively.\u201cBring me around to have a look!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d The boy was in glee as he hurriedly ran in front of Leylin to lead the way.\u201cThis market is under the protection of the Walker Family, a well-received family by both wandering acolytes and Magi alike. Look over there, the wooden hut in the centre is a shop personally set up by the Walker Family.The small boy tried his best to fulfil his duties as a guide.\u201cSo these are other people\u2019s stalls?\u201d Leylin pointed at the acolytes displaying their goods on the floor. Their goods were much better than those in the academy, and of course, more of them were counterfeits too.\u201cYes, you only need to settle the procedures in the central hall, pay the fees, and then you\u2019ll be able to obtain a place to set up your stall!\u201d The little boy nodded, \u201cSir, is there anything that you\u2019d wish to sell? The Walker Family also provides consignment services.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry now. Bring me to the centremost area for a walk!\u201d Leylin said.In this Magus Market, he discovered several official Magi with activated defensive force fields surrounding them. These are existences he could not fight against right now, so he was more cautious than usual.\u201cThis is the smithy! It specialises in selling weapons! Next to it, with the sign which has a test tube on it, is a Potioneering shop. On the far left is an auction house. From time to time, they have a few premium goods!\u201d The little boy was extremely familiar with this place.\u201cAn auction house? Then will they have the information about Magic Artifacts?\u201d Leylin casually asked. He was a little more interested now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Last year the auction only sold one low-grade Magic Artifact. There were even official Magi present who joined the bidding\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like this. Take me to the weapons shop!\u201dLeylin followed the little boy to where the blacksmith\u2019s smithy was.\u201cHey! Big Bearded Old Man, I brought you some business!\u201d Once the little boy entered the forge he started shouting loudly.\u201cI\u2019ll be right there!\u201d The shop owner did indeed have a thick and bushy beard. He was not tall, but the muscles on his arm were extremely hard and gave an impression of power.\u201cGreetings, esteemed guest! I am the owner of this smithy, please call me Black Hammer!\u201d The shop owner introduced himself.\u201cI need a cross blade!\u201d Leylin spoke of his intentions. Previously, he had ruined his cross blade when fighting the mutated Green Tree Sprite. He now wanted a better quality one, something that wasn\u2019t easy to obtain.\u201cA cross blade huh, follow me.\u201d Black Hammer undid the wine flagon hanging on his waist and took a sip. The scent of alcohol wafted out.\u201cOh! Haven\u2019t I told you to tone down your drinking?\u201d The little boy frowned as he pinched his nose.\u201cHiccup\u2026\u2026Edgar, you are still a child and cannot appreciate the absolute bliss of fine tasting wine!\u201d Black Hammer shook his head and led Leylin to a wooden shelf.\u201cMy shop\u2019s finished cross blades are all here. Please take your pick. Of course, if it isn\u2019t satisfactory, you can have one custom made, as for the price\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen he spoke of the price, Black Hammer\u2019s words were extremely clear. He did not seem even a little bit drunk.Leylin casually scrutinized the cross blades on the wooden shelf. These blades obviously already went through the rigors of war. Their silver surface emanated a bloodthirsty aura.Leylin casually picked one up. It had an intricate yet sturdy feel that tingled into his palms that felt rather heavy.\u201cA finely smithed steel blade. It even has a metallic star smelted onto it. The hilt is wrapped in black silk, to prevent it from slipping through one\u2019s hands\u2026\u2026\u201d Black Hammer described the item.Leylin nodded his head and placed the cross blade back on the yellow wooden shelf, then picked up another one.This cross blade\u2019s exterior was a little darkened. It let out a solid reliable aura.\u201cA blade made of alloy. It has been modified before. Able to resist corrosion and flames!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Leylin was a little moved, \u201cCan it deflect a Magus\u2019 spell?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Black Hammer shook his head immediately. \u201cTo resist a spell, there should be runes inscribed on the blade at the very least. Moreover, it has to be compounded using precious materials from an Alchemist. Such a blade would already be considered a Magic Artifact, and wouldn\u2019t be displayed in the open like this for sale\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy apologies, I have been too greedy!\u201d Leylin shook his head.Picking up the black blade, \u201cI want this, and prepare another 20 crossbow bolts for me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, the price is\u2026\u2026\u201d Black Hammer\u2019s eyes shone. He did not bother to drink his wine anymore.When Leylin and the little boy walked out of the weapons shop, Leylin hung the cross blade from his waist, at the same time he took a Magic Crystal and tossed it over to the small boy.\u201cThis is your remuneration for today! I wish to walk alone now!\u201d\u201cAlright! Have a good day!\u201d The little boy was extremely delighted and put away the Magic Crystal before trotting off.Leylin stood rooted to the spot until the little boy could no longer be seen. Only then did he turn back to the stalls he had first went in, where the goods were lying on the ground.After browsing for a bit, Leylin visited every wooden shop found in the central area. Only then did Leylin walk into the shop with the test tube sign.\u201cSir, how may I assist you?\u201d spoke a young male staff who wore a fashionable western style suit.Leylin looked at the potions on the shelves. These sparkling potions radiated various colours. The transparent glass counter also displayed various precious ingredients.\u201cIt seems like this shop\u2019s goods are a little better than fatty Woox\u2019s!\u201d Leylin nodded his head in approval.\u201cI will need the feathers of a flamingo, eyeballs of multi-tailed owl, feather from a Human Head Bird, Pink Ink Oil, Green Coconut Rock\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin hurriedly listed his items. These were all ingredients needed to treat his injuries, to make explosive potions and formulate other basic potions.The staff quietly listened until Leylin finished speaking before bowing and saying, \u201cMy apologies, but may I ask if you are a Potioneering Master?\u201d\u201cI have a little bit of knowledge in the field!\u201d Leylin\u2019s facial features were concealed by the hood of his the cloak. Thus, the staff was unable to discern his expressions.\u201cOur Walker Family wholeheartedly invites you to join our family. The terms we offer are the absolute best amongst Magi families of equal ranking \u2026\u2026\u201d The staff bowed even deeper.Leylin did expect this a little. Potioneering Masters were a difficult breed to raise. Plus, Magi cannot do without potions so Magi Families have always tried to recruit them by offering generous remuneration.He would definitely not be able to conceal his identity as a Potioneering Master if he were to buy raw ingredients. However, as long as no one discovers his talent, he wasn\u2019t afraid of letting them know. After all, as long as he was not found out, others would not know if the person standing before them was a Potioneering Master or an acolyte.\u201cI will give this some consideration. Do you have the ingredients I listed earlier?\u201d Leylin said with a raspy voice.\u201cWe do have 2 flamingo feathers. As for eyeballs of the multi-tailed owl, we still have a pair left. However, it has been around for 3 years, so some of its medicinal properties have spoiled a little. As for the feathers from a Human Head Bird, Pink Ink Oil, Green Coconut Rock, we have them here, also\u2026\u2026\u201dThe staff seemed to remember every item in the shop from memory and blurted them all out.Leylin nodded his head. A Magus\u2019 main cultivation is Spiritual Force. After advancing, their brains will also develop. Hence, all Magi were intelligent people. As for Leylin\u2019s conjecture, when Magi have advanced into a higher realm, their brains would even be comparable to the processing abilities of the A.I. Chip.\u201cI want all of them, name your price!\u201d Leylin nodded his head.\u201cThe total amounts to 157 Magic Crystals!\u201d The staff smiled.Leylin nodded his head and took out a small box, which he had prepared earlier, from his robes. After opening, one could see that it was densely packed with cyan-coloured potions.\u201cLook, these are all strength potions!\u201d Leylin took out the strength potions and lay them in front of the front of the staff.Strength potions were one of the basic potions. In fact, most of the Potioneering acolytes chose to brew it first. After seeing this, the staff became evidently disappointed.But he quickly recovered his composure and began to inspect.\u201c30 Strength Potions, I can give you 130 Magic Crystals for them,\u201d the staff said.Leylin approved silently. If he were to sell these at Woox\u2019s, he would have gotten 120 Magic Crystals at most. Prices outside were indeed higher, but it was more dangerous too.\u201cOkay!\u201d Leylin counted another 27 Magic Crystals and handed them to the staff.\u201cBring me the materials I ordered!\u201d\u201cOkay, give me a moment!\u201d The staff put away the potions and Magic Crystals before swiftly running to the back.Leylin waited for what seemed like another dozen minutes before the staff returned with a small wooden chest, which he placed in front of Leylin.\u201cThese are the goods you requested, please inspect them!\u201dLeylin opened the small wooden chest. It was compartmentalised using wooden trays, where various ingredients were placed on them. There were colourful feathers, green-coloured rocks, and various coloured powders.Leylin fingers traced the various ingredients, \u201cA.I. Chip! Inspect\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the A.I. Chip indicated that all the ingredients were up to standard, only then did Leylin keep the wooden chest. He then rose to leave the Potion Shop.\u201cWhat I\u2019m selling is only the most basic of Strength Potion, and to gather the ingredients is already this complicated. Even I cannot guess the uses of these ingredients completely. They will definitely not be able to as well.\u201dLeylin hid the small wooden chest beneath his robes and circled around a few times before he slowly left the market.\u201cThe most important thing is, my trades only cost around 100 Magic Crystals. If the Walker Family was stirred because of this paltry amount, then their reputation would have long since gone bad!\u201dOn the way, he increased the A.I. Chip\u2019s detection area to the maximum. Only after confirming that no one was following him did Leylin leave the Lost Forest.Ever since the earlier incident, Leylin moved camp. Right now he sheltered in a cave. As for its previous owner, a Black Bear, it had long since become Leylin\u2019s dinner.* Bang! *Leylin stacked a few large boxes together to form a simple experiment table. Then, he placed his apparatus on it.\u201cI am finally going to be rid of this damned pathogen!\u201d Leylin gritted his teeth, \u201cEvery day I have to cauterise this wound. With the limitations of my Vitality and Strength, I\u2019ve had enough of it!\u201dLeylin picked up a green-coloured rock with the shape of a leaf on its surface.This was a Green Coconut Rock, a rare half plant half mineral commodity.Smashing the Green Coconut Rock apart, Leylin took the Pink Ink Oil and heated it. When it began to bubble, he added the grounded Green Coconut Rock powder.* Sssii! * As the powdered Green Coconut Rock was poured onto the Pink Ink Oil, a hissing sound was let off.The Pink Ink Oil turned green in a moment. It released a strangely fragrant odor.[Potion successfully brewed!] Upon hearing the A.I. Chip\u2019s confirmation, Leylin nodded his head slightly.He stripped all his clothes off. All sorts of burns and scars could be seen littering his body. His shoulder and stomach each had an extremely horrifying scar with tufts of hair growing around them.\u201cQiesiter \u2013 Kesi!\u201d Leylin murmured an incantation.The green-coloured potion in the test tube immediately boiled, and continued to evaporate, making the smell in the air more concentrated.* Sssii! * As if having been granted a life of its own, the hairs around Leylin\u2019s wounds started climbing out and wiggled their way into the test tube.\u201cWu!\u201d Leylin gritted his teeth and let these hairs make their way out as they pleased.A dozen minutes later, Leylin\u2019s wound no longer had black hair around it. As for the test tube, it transformed into a ball of hair.Leylin\u2019s expression remained apathetic as he wiped off his cold sweat. He lit a feather on fire and threw it onto the ball of hair.\u201cBoohoo\u2026\u2026\u201dGreen flames rose and mimicked the crying sound of a female, which was rather similar to Doris\u2019 voice.Many strands of hair tried to escape, but they were trapped by Leylin within a ball of milky white substance. They had no option but burn into oblivion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEllinel MarketAfter the green flames died down, what was left behind was a pile of white dust.Leylin\u2019s expression was extremely solemn as he lightly dabbed on the dust. * Hu! * The dust swirled in the air, transforming into a female\u2019s face, \u201cEnemy! Enemy!\u201d\u201cThis pathogen contains the poison of an aggrieved soul, no wonder it is so strong!\u201d Leylin shook his head, took out a green-coloured potion, and splashed it onto that female face.* Sssii! * The human face rapidly turned into white mist, vanishing completely into thin air.\u201cA.I. Chip, initiate scan!\u201d Leylin ordered.[Beep! Scan complete. Result: Pathogen in Host body has been completely eradicated!]Hearing the A.I. Chip, Leylin\u2019s face finally revealed his relief.He stretched lazily and touched the scars on his body, \u201cIt\u2019s a little unsightly! If Neela were to see these, what would her expression be like?\u201dAfter rummaging through the big chest, he found a potion and downed it.A dozen minutes later, Leylin\u2019s superficial layer of skin quivered and forced out the layer of scars and dead skin replacing them with glossier skin.\u201cOnce I got rid of the pathogen, healing the scars on my skin is just a matter of a few potions!\u201dLeylin touched the scars which were extremely faded now, \u201cI estimate that after one more dose, these will be completely gone!\u201dLeylin then took out the remainder of the unfortunate black bear\u2019s paw and rewarded himself with a good meal.While eating and drinking until he was full, the sky outside had already dimmed. Leylin lit a small fire inside the cave and began to think of the journey ahead.\u201cDoris has finally been disposed of. There aren\u2019t any pursuers remaining so I can rest easy while travelling!\u201d\u201cThe academy\u2019s mission isn\u2019t really important. After all, I have 3 years to complete it. I wonder how the academy is faring right now?\u201d Although Leylin could enquire about news concerning Abyssal Bone Forest Academy in the market today, he did not dare to.Who knows if there might be spies around. If he were to expose his identity, wouldn\u2019t that be like walking right into a trap?He could only wait till he journeyed through half the kingdom before he could safely begin making inquiries.Such a huge matter will definitely be a hot topic at Magi gathering points. He only has to be careful not to expose any information about himself.\u201cAll of these could be dealt with later, what\u2019s important is to hurry and change all the potions into Magic Crystals. It is simply too inconvenient to lug all these huge chests around!\u201dLeylin patted the solid hard wooden chest. He thought of the miserable brown horse days ago that seemed like it would die anytime. He smiled bitterly.\u201cI can\u2019t go to the Walker Family\u2019s market anymore. After all, I have just sold a number of potions there!\u201dLeylin mentally called up the map and located his current position.\u201cFrom the academy to Eastwoods Province, I have to travel through 5 other provinces. I can sell potions along the way. At best, I can only sell potions until Jersha Province.On the map, the Jersha Province was midway to his destination There were two more provinces separating Eastwoods Province from it.If he were to sell his potions all the way to Eastwoods Province, wouldn\u2019t that mean giving away his itinerary and purpose? Leylin wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to do that.Although he sold his goods along the way, others may not be able to discover it. After all, the trades done every day were numerous. Leylin, however, would rather be a little more cautious in safeguarding his tracks.As for Jersha Province, it was in the central region of Poolfield Kingdom and was accessible from all sides. Other people would not be able to guess Leylin\u2019s destination at all.\u201cEn!\u201d Anyway, there is still time. If it\u2019s necessary I can reroute to further locations. In any case, I must be careful never to reveal my identity!\u201dLeylin looked the points marked as Magi gathering spots and entered into deep thought\u2026\u2026Two odd months passed.On a path to Jersha Province, a sturdily built black horse carrying a wooden chest and a black robed man could be seen cantering along.The black robed man had bright red hair, and was extremely handsome.This was naturally Leylin in disguise.Ever since that time, as Leylin journeyed, he found some Magi gathering points or some small scale trading sites time to time, where he sold the potions he brewed.As he only sold a few each time, he did not attract the avarice of other experts. Occasionally, some foolish acolyte blinded by greed would waylay him, but they were completely not his match at all. The most dangerous instance was when a Level 3 Acolyte brought a group of other acolytes to surround him. Still, Leylin managed to evade them with the help of the A.I. Chip\u2019s detection capability.Through these trades, he acquired a few precious materials, and many books on specialised Magi knowledge, greatly enhancing the data bank of the A.I. Chip.In these past two months, he finally recorded all the Shadow and Dark Element spell models he purchased previously. He then completely obliterated the contents of the book.This lightened his luggage tremendously.After selling a huge portion of his potions and getting rid of those bulky spell books, Leylin could fit all of his belongings into one chest.According to his projections, he could simply travel with a knapsack after selling the remaining potions.\u201cI have underestimated the popularity of potions. Right now, I have amassed over 2,000 Magic Crystals. If not for purchasing information and other miscellaneous items, I might have gotten over 2500 Magic Crystals!\u201dLeylin stretched his hands and felt around his robes. A sack of hard texture travelled to his hands. He could not help but smile.\u201cFortunately, there are high-grade Magic Crystals in this Magus World. One piece can be exchanged for 100 ordinary Magic Crystals. Otherwise, I would have a problem carrying all those Magic Crystals\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cA.I. Chip, stat update!\u201d Leylin ordered.[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte and Knight. Strength: 2.7, Agility: 2.8, Vitality: 3.0, Spiritual Force: 4.6, Magical Power: 4.0. Status: Healthy] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cEn! Strength and Agility increased. This is the result of continuous stimulation of my internal Knight energy. After it stabilises, I can begin to gradually take on the next phase of Knight\u2019s training. This should raise all my stats to at least 3! As for Spiritual Force, it only increased a little. This was the only return I got after a number of life and death situations. Magus training, as expected, is only going to get more and more difficult!\u201dLeylin sighed and mentally projected the map again.On the huge map, Jersha Province was in the central region of Poolfield Kingdom. There were many small Magus families here.Although this was the capital of a regular human kingdom, it attracted all sorts of travellers, many wandering Magi, and even criminal Magi.These Magi, because of their radical opinions, or some other matter, were exiled from their previous association, faced with persecution, or even put up on bounty lists. They turned into wandering Magi, often making them very dangerous people.\u201cIn Jersha Province, it just so happens that there is an extremely huge Magus market controlled by the Redbud Family, one of the three big families supporting Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. I will definitely be able to obtain the latest news here!\u201dIn these past two months, Leylin had secretly made inquiries about the various news related to the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. However, the information he got were all rather vague. He only knew that it was at war with some factions to its west. As for its opponents, and how the academy was faring, everything was extremely hazy.\u201cWe\u2019re here, Ellinel Market. I\u2019ll sell my remaining potions and ask about news of the academy before resuming my journey.\u201dLeylin decided.\u2026\u2026In a tiny village\u2019s ruined wharf.\u201cIf not for the intelligence report, I would never have believed that the first Magus market in the Poolfield Kingdom would actually be hidden underneath a regular human village\u201d.As Leylin scanned the village\u2019s surroundings, a lifeless atmosphere greeted him.\u201cThe Magus market should be below here since there are signs of occasional radiation emanating from it. The villagers above are also definitely sickly, where some might even die suddenly. How would they be able to flourish? I\u2019m afraid after a dozen or so years, this village would become another ghost town!\u201dLeylin adjusted the grey robes on his body and covered his facial features, before coming to the entrance of a hut made of bricks.The corroded door let out a dull noise as Leylin knocked lightly.\u201cWho are you?\u201d An icy voice sounded from inside.\u201cI am a wandering acolyte, who wishes to have a look at the market!\u201d* Creak! * The large door opened and revealed a black robed figure.Leylin was shocked; he felt murderous intent oozing from the black robed figure. This may be a very obscure concept but if one killed too many of their kind, they will definitely be different from others. The feeling that this black robed figure gave Leylin was that many experts of the same level died in his hands.\u201cAs expected of a large market, even the guard is so fierce!\u201d The black robed figure emitted the energy waves of a Level 3 Acolyte. He even carried a one-time use magical item. It could not escape the A.I. Chip\u2019s detection though.\u201cNo matter if it\u2019s your first time or not, I will enumerate the rules. Any fights inside the market will be deemed as a provocation by the Redbud Family.\u201d The black robed figure said icily.Only then did Leylin notice the Redbud insignia on his sleeves.\u201cI understand!\u201d Leylin nodded his head.\u201cAlright, the fee would be 1 Magic Crystal!\u201dAfter Leylin paid the entry fee, the black robed figure tapped lightly on the fireplace, and steel machinery rumbled. The fireplace swung to the right revealing a flight of stairs going downwards.\u201cEven the style is reminiscent of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d Leylin shook his head.After entering the tunnel, the fireplace swung shut, and the passage dimmed once more with only a few lamps dimly glowing in the depths.Leylin descended the stairs. After he felt he had gone a dozen metres underground, a huge cavern emerged.The market was extremely huge. It was the size of several football fields. The ceiling was studded with some kind of stalactite that made Leylin wonder if they were natural.In the middle of the market, buildings built using grey rocks were lined up in a row. Surrounding them was a circle of wooden huts. As for the street stalls, they were actually rather sparse.Magi and acolytes wore robes of various colours; white, black, and grey-robed people could be seen stepping in and out of the shops.Leylin began to understand the rules of the Magus World a little better.Normally, official Magi would either wear black or white, and acolytes would wear grey. White represented the factions that were more peace loving, for example, the healing arts and the like. As for the black robes, they leaned more towards combat, and their dispositions were rather strange too.Of course, these are the conventionally attired ones. There were also some Magi who wore various odd looking costumes that were rather bizarre.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I only charge 1 Magic Crystal!\u201d Clamored the little boys and girls who crowded around Leylin.\u201cNo need for that!\u201d Leylin immediately refused.After visiting a lot of markets, he found out that these guides did not require that much payment. Some of the families controlling these markets even provide free guides to help patrons move around.The first time he entered a market, he gave a little boy a Magic Crystal. This was a huge deficit for him.As for ordinary markets, they were considerably smaller. Circling for a few times would be enough for anyone to become familiar with the place. There were even signs around. So under normal circumstances, patrons do not require guides at all.Leylin casually strolled inside the market. Later, he walked towards the largest Potion\u2019s Shop.\u201cGreetings Sir!\u201d A white-bearded geezer smiled and bowed.\u201cI wish to sell a batch of potions. Their prices may be a little high!\u201d Leylin was extremely direct.\u201cPlease follow me!\u201d The old geezer was startled. He immediately brought Leylin to a small booth at the back.After closing the door, Leylin felt the energy waves generated by an isolation spell formation.\u201cOur shop extends confidentiality towards our guests. Moreover, we also employ the best safety measures\u2026\u2026\u201dThe white-bearded geezer smiled as he explained.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Leylin nodded his head, being able to avoid the crowd was extremely beneficial to him.There were two sofas within the booth, and between these was a small wooden table with two hot piping drinks on it.\u201cPlease have a seat!\u201d The geezer gestured.Leylin sat down and reclined on the sofa. He lifted the cup and sniffed lightly, \u201cPowder of Tillan Beans with black pearls added, very beneficial for an acolyte\u2019s meditation!\u201d\u201cYour achievements in Potioneering have left me speechless!\u201d The old geezer\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\u201cThank you. I have been inside an experiment lab for a year until now working on something important. Please appraise these potions for me!\u201dLeylin handed over a sack to the old geezer.The old geezer opened the sack, and immediately cried out, \u201cEh?!\u201dIn the sack was the remainder of Leylin\u2019s potions, each and every one of them glowed resplendently.\u201cPlease wait a minute!\u201d The old geezer took out a monocle and placed it over his eye.After what seemed like half an hour, the old geezer looked a little exhausted and rubbed his temples after he put the monocle away.\u201c37 hemostasis potions, 45 antidotes, silence potions\u2026\u2026These potions are all of good quality and have been preserved well. I can give you 900 Magic Crystals for them!\u201d\u201cVery fair!\u201d Leylin gently nodded his head.The old geezer then stored the potions for safekeeping and counted out 9 high-grade Magic Crystals which he handed over to Leylin.\u201cSir, you must be a Potioneering Master? Please keep this; you will be able to enjoy a 10% discount on items and services in our shop. We can also offer a higher price for other potions you may have\u2026\u2026\u201dThe old geezer said as he presented a purple card to Leylin with both hands.Leylin glanced at the card and then pocketed it swiftly, \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind!\u201dThe old geezer then sent Leylin off. As they bade farewell, Leylin casually asked, \u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve just finished my experiments. Are there places where I may inquire about the latest news on the Poolfield Kingdom?\u201dThe old geezer stared blankly for a while before answering, \u201cIf you wish to learn some secrets and the latest intelligence, Gandor\u2019s Grocery Shop would be your best choice. Although his temper is a little wacky, but he\u2019s the most informed\u2026\u2026\u201dAccording to the old geezer\u2019s direction, Leylin came to Gandor\u2019s Grocery Shop.As he entered, the things inside the shop were very untidy, and various items were lying around. There were even many that the A.I. Chip could not identify.One thing stood out though, no counterfeit products were inside. This piqued Leylin\u2019s interest.\u201cWho?\u201d A voice sounded from behind the counter. Following which, a geezer, who appeared as if he was on the brink of death, popped out from behind it.\u201cThe geezer from the Potion Shop recommended this place to me. I wish to gather the latest intelligence regarding the Poolfield Kingdom.\u201cSame old rules, only after buying an item in my shop will you will be able to obtain information from me.\u201d The half-dead geezer lips did not move but a mysterious voice could be heard from him.\u201cAlright! I\u2019ll simply pick anything I fancy!\u201d Leylin wanted to pick an item at random.\u201cNo can do, it is I who will choose for you!\u201d The half-dead geezer sniggered.\u201cNo wonder business is so bad here!\u201d Leylin rolled his eyes, \u201cGo ahead then!\u201dThe half-dead geezer rummaged through a shelf at the back of the shop. The wooden shelf made a creaking sound. It looked like it would collapse any moment. Leylin was even worried about him since the shelf looked like it could collapse at any moment.\u201cI found it!\u201d The half-dead geezer took a black coloured scroll from the shelf.On this scroll were characters that Leylin did not recognize at all. Its corners were extremely frayed and looked like mice had chewed on it.\u201cThis is a fragment of The Great Magus Serholm\u2019s spell. I\u2019ll sell it to you for only 1,000 Magic Crystals, an absolutely worthy deal, what do you think?\u201d The half-dead geezer eyes glittered.\u201cThis could even be the inheritance of The Great Magus Serholm! Perhaps, you could advance to high-level Magus after you buy it\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin was left speechless as he took it in his hands.\u201cA.I. Chip! Scan!\u201d[Beep! Confirmed: Carbon dating, document comparison analysis shows this page is composed of human skin! Belongs to: Lowian\u2019s teachings: 89.5%, Blue Cobalt rare book: 56.5% and Serholm\u2019s writing: 21.7%]\u201cThere exists something like this? A.I. Chip, what is the strength of the geezer opposite me?\u201d[Estimated Level 3 Acolyte, based on energy wave emissions, Confirmed: he is in a process of reconstructing his physical body. Degree of similarity: Zombification: 86.6% and Aggrieved Soul Transformation: 45.6%]Leylin pretended to scrutinize the page for some more time before looking up at the geezer, \u201cThis seems like a remnant of the Lowian\u2019s teachings. You actually lied to me?\u201d\u201cHow can this be?\u201d The half-dead geezer hurriedly lamented. A flash of shock crossed his eyes, which immediately changed into a cajoling expression.\u201cEven if it is the Lowian\u2019s teachings, this assuredly belongs to Sir Rookmanst, a Rank 2 Magus, 2 years ago, this same fragment was sold for 700 Magic Crystals. So, how about I sell it to you for that price?\u201dLeylin shook his head, \u201c Lowian\u2019s teachings were written in an advanced-coded language. Only an official Magus will be able to decipher the code. Ordinary acolytes will definitely not be able to.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, although the contents were written in code, but their page numbers were written in the Angema language to make it more obscure!\u201d Leylin pointed to the page number at the bottom.\u201cLook at this, it\u2019s only page number 12! According to <Life of Rookmanst>, the first 30 pages of Lowian\u2019s teachings contained only records of his experiments, and insights penned when he was still an acolyte. Only when he turned into an official Magus, did he chance upon an inheritance and he began to display a terrifying talent! As for this overpriced page, the page number should at least be beyond 100 to be believable!\u201d\u201cTransactions among Magi are based on the premise that the exchanged goods are equal in value. This derelict page of yours is not worth 700 Magic Crystals. According to my estimate, 70 is its highest asking price.\u201d Leylin concluded.\u201cYikes\u2026\u2026Hahaha! Today\u2019s weather isn\u2019t bad!\u201d The half-dead man tried putting up a front, but finally gave in to Leylin\u2019s unwavering gaze.\u201cAlright, I never expected to meet a very erudite scholar! Take your pick then!\u201d\u201cNo need, I came here to gather intelligence! I\u2019ll just buy it at a fair price.\u201d Leylin held onto the black coloured page and placed 7 middle-grade Magic Crystals on the table.Although the coding on this derelict page could only be deciphered by an official Magus, Leylin wished to give the A.I. Chip a shot at breaking the code. After all in terms of processing ability, Leylin was confident that the A.I. Chip\u2019s ability was much better than even an official Magus\u2019, despite this being his first attempt at such.\u201cAlright! Alright! What do you want to ask?\u201d The half-dead geezer sprawled on the table and ate the Magic Crystals one by one. Leylin was rather shocked by this scene.\u201cI require a lot of energy. If you were to give me another 1,000 Magic Crystals I would\u2019ve definitely completed my physical body\u2019s restructuring\u2026\u2026\u201d The half-dead geezer\u2019s expression was resentful.Leylin shook his head, \u201cTell me news about Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201d\u201cAbyssal Bone Forest Academy! You are an acolyte there?\u201d\u201cOnly some interest in the happenings over there. Besides, I don\u2019t want to suffer any collateral damage from the war!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d The half-dead geezer did not ask anymore. \u201cI graduated from there too. Now Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s situation isn\u2019t that great. I heard that Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle teamed up against Abyssal Bone Forest Academy in this war\u2026\u2026\u201dThe half-dead geezer spoke endlessly.Half a day later, Leylin walked out from the grocery shop with an extremely miserable face. \u201cI never thought that the situation would already be this bad. It seems like I need to stay out here longer than I expected.\u201dAccording to the half-dead geezer, the reason for the war had long since been forgotten. What mattered was that Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle were factions on the same level as Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. Their alliance placed Abyssal Bone Forest Academy in a disadvantageous position. Right now, the academy could only rely on its defence spell formation to resist.\u201cA.I. Chip, how long will it take to decode this page?\u201dLeylin felt the derelict page of the Lowian\u2019s teachings. Although it was made from human skin, Leylin still wrapped it well and kept it within his robes.[Beep! Analysis in progress! No comparable code found in the databank. Will require conjecture\u2026\u2026Estimated time to completion: 93 days 13 hours!]\u201c3 odd months? I can do that!\u201d Leylin stroked his chin as he casually strolled around the market.What he had told the half-dead geezer earlier was the truth, but Leylin simply wanted to gamble upon the A.I. Chip\u2019s abilities. Even if it did not work out, the information the half-dead geezer had provided was worth at least 20 to 30 Magic Crystals.Although the page number of the Lowian\u2019s teachings\u2019 derelict journal page was pretty low and contained mostly information for acolytes, for a Level 2 Acolyte like Leylin, it still was pretty useful.There may even be some of Rookmanst\u2019s meditation techniques, experiment records or even some discovery of resources. If he could discover them, Leylin would benefit immensely.In any case, the processing capabilities of the A.I. Chip were very impressive. Leylin had not even used half of its capabilities, just letting it sit idle for most of the time. He might as well use this downtime for deciphering the code.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySlavesLeylin\u2019s footsteps did not stop until he walked out of Ellinel Market.The exit was at the side of the village and was actually beneath a stack of hay. It was also guarded by a black-robed man with theRedbud insignia.\u201cA.I. Chip! Initiate area scan!\u201d After walking out of the village, Leylin ordered after walking out of the village.A faint light blue screen was projected in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes, clearly identifying a sneaky figure tailing him from behind. In the whole light blue projection, the red dot was extremely obvious.[Target\u2019s identified. Strength estimated at Level 2 Acolyte. No Magic Artifact detected!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cOnly a Level 2 Acolyte huh? Seems like it\u2019s not any huge faction, but only an avaricious dog after some wealth!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed coldly, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have other plans \u2026\u2026\u201dThe Level 2 Acolyte tailing Leylin seemed to be extremely patient. Only after Leylin was a dozen miles away from the vicinity of the market did he make his sneak attack!* Whoosh! * Suddenly two balls of mud rose beneath Leylin\u2019s feet, turning into two yellow-brown coloured hands that tightly held down Leylin\u2019s ankles.A dagger suffused with purple light immediately stabbed towards Leylin\u2019s back.\u201cSuccess!\u201d yelled the sneak attacking acolyte whose face was flushed with joy. He belatedly realised that Leylin had mysteriously dissolved, turning into a vine with thorns that coiled around his body.The thorns mercilessly dug into flesh. The acolyte could even feel the vine come alive and was greedily feeding on his blood.\u201cDamn! It\u2019s a golem! What is this spell! Shadow Embodiment? Leeching Vines?\u201d As the acolyte lost huge amounts of blood, he increasingly became muddleheaded.\u201cAh! You can\u2019t do this! Please\u2026\u2026Please spare me\u2026\u2026\u201dThe acolyte pleaded. Alas, the immediately the vines squirmed and sealed his mouth.* Bang! * The spell\u2019s effect disappeared, and on the ground was left the shrivelled corpse of the acolyte.Against his enemies, Leylin was never merciful.\u2026\u2026The second day, Leylin once again visited the market.\u201cSir! Do you need a guide? I only require 1 Magic Crystal!\u201d The noisy little kids were still clamouring at the entrance.Today Leylin had changed his clothes. And to conceal himself even further, he changed his appearance too.Although his previous face was a fake, there was no guaranteed special spell effect that could penetrate and see through the cloak.As for energy waves and the sort, Leylin was not too worried about it. Yesterday he deliberately avoided official Magi, so his energy waves would never be recorded.To capture the energy waves generated by Spiritual Force, an official Magus has to make enough preparations beforehand. There wouldn\u2019t be any Magi who had nothing better to do.\u201cYou\u2019ll do!\u201d Leylin randomly picked a little girl.\u201cThank you! Sir, I am extremely familiar with this place!\u201d The little girl was a little overjoyed. She wore a white coloured dress and looked to be somewhat thin.After tossing a Magic Crystal to the girl, Leylin said slowly, \u201cI wish to enter a higher leveled area!\u201dHis voice was modified to sound different from the day before.\u201cA higher leveled area? You mean\u2026\u2026The second level?\u201d The little girl asked a little hesitantly.\u201cOf course!\u201d This was the point to the experience Leylin patiently amassed after coming to the market many times. These markets weren\u2019t very huge, and Leylin always felt that something was missing. Certain precious resources were absent in these markets too. These little children guides most likely stood here waiting for powerful customers to bring them to the more concealed areas.\u201cSince you know about the second level, then you should also understand that if you don\u2019t have an item worth over 1000 Magic Crystals or a guarantor, you will be denied entry.\u201d\u201cNaturally I do! Lead the way!\u201d The little girl raised her head, yet she was unable to discern the expression behind Leylin\u2019s cloak. She could only lower her head and lead the way.\u201cAlthough there should be many official Magi on the second level, there is no choice. The two ancient formulas, Azure Potion and Tears of Mary, plus many of their ingredients have not been collected yet. If I can\u2019t even find it here, biggest Magus market, then there is completely no chance anymore. I can only look for substitute ingredients!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression was rather dark. As he journeyed, he sold potions along the way and did his utmost to collect all of the ingredients of the two ancient potions. However, he was met with little success so far. Ellinel Market was the second largest gathering of Magi after Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. If he couldn\u2019t find what he needed here, then Leylin was completely helpless.Leylin followed the little girl. They arrived at a rather deserted alley.She used a stone found on a wall corner of the wall to knock.* Bang! * The alley\u2019s walls shifted, revealing an underground passage.\u201cHere it is!\u201d The little girl said softly, as if very afraid.\u201cLead the way!\u201d Leylin followed the little girl and they continued walking downwards. Several minutes later, they reached a door at the end of the passage.Two Level 3 Acolytes wearing blood red robes were standing guard. According to the A.I. Chip\u2019s scan, they carried Magic Artifacts on their bodies. This slightly startled Leylin. At the same time, he was filled with curiosity towards the market behind it.The little girl went forward and exchanged a few words with the two acolytes before walking back to Leylin. She curtseyed, \u201cMost respected Sir, I can only lead you this far!\u201dWhen she finished speaking, she hurriedly ran back up the flight of stairs disappearing into the darkness.\u201cIt seems like there is something in this premium market that terrifies her!\u201d Leylin thought indifferently as he walked towards the two acolytes.\u201cAn item of proof, or an item worth at least 1000 Magic Crystals!\u201d A red robed acolyte said icily. Standing before them, Leylin could somehow sense the wails of aggrieved souls hovering around them.\u201cWhat terrifying people!\u201d Leylin thought inwardly. He tossed over a small sack containing 10 high-grade Magic Crystals.The red robed acolyte opened and looked before tossing the sack back to Leylin. He then opened the door behind him.Leylin walked in unhurriedly. Only after the large door closed behind him, was he inclined to observe the area in front of him.This field was most likely beneath the market earlier. Its surface area was smaller, only having a street traversing it.From time to time Magi walked past. Since it was not very crowded, the distance between passersby was rather far. There were almost no Level 1 Acolytes here. Level 2 Acolytes too were very few. Most of the people here were Level 3 Acolytes. Their bodies all radiated strong energy waves. Official Magi too were rather common.\u2026\u2026Leylin inhaled deeply and walked down the street\u2026\u2026Half an hour later, Leylin walked out of a stone hut with a Potion sign, his face had obvious signs of joy.They had the main ingredients Kroft mentioned, as well as the rest of the ingredients, \u201cIt is indeed the largest market!\u201dThe main ingredients of the two ancient potions, Azure Potion and Tears of Mary, were the most important. As for other ingredients, they were easier to acquire. Being able to buy them all at once exceeded Leylin\u2019s expectations.Leylin spent more than half of the 1000 Magic Crystals he prepared to purchase these ingredients. He was still satisfied, though, and felt that the expense was worth it.Putting away the ingredients, he anticipated that he had to find a safe place and begin brewing the potions. His mood was rather good. He even felt inclined to stroll around a bit.The goods here were obviously of a higher grade than the market above. Leylin even saw a low-grade Magic Artifact dagger for sale.However, the price was at least 400 Magic Crystals, which immediately made Leylin stop feeling lucky.Suddenly, Leylin heard noisy clamouring voices travelled over leaving Leylin a little startled. He tracked these voices and made a new discovery.\u201cSlave market?\u201dWhat Leylin saw in front of him was a large fenced area. Many stark naked slaves were standing behind fences. Their faces showed either numb indifference or extreme humiliation as they let the acolytes and Magi take their pick.\u201cJust right! I\u2019ll need a few slaves myself!\u201dLeylin wanted to stay in Extreme Night Town for around 3 years. He could not manage many things by himself. Originally, he planned to recruit a few guards and servants when he got there, but a few high-grade slaves were now conveniently available.After all, they were all raised or controlled by Magi. This lent their owner better security and assured functionality.\u201cSir! What do you think? Do you need a female slave for your bed?\u201d Look, these are all good quality ones, some are even of the nobility.A slave trader looked as Leylin walked forward. The slaver hurriedly patted the ample breasts of a group of female slaves behind him, which carried a rippling wave effect.Behind him were a dozen utterly naked noblewomen. Their skin was extremely smooth, and their figures were quite vivacious. Even if they were slaves, their aura of nobility could not be stifled.\u201cHow did they end up here? I mean, as nobles, wouldn\u2019t it be troublesome?\u201d Leylin was a little curious.\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, these are all nobles who fought and lost in battles. Their fiefdoms have long since been usurped and their families destroyed. They are legally under the death sentence. There will absolutely be no trouble at all.The trader smugly explained.Leylin looked behind a noblewoman who was being dragged away. There was obviously a noble young lady standing there. He could not help but think of the young noble lady he met previously in the woods. If her revenge failed, who knows if she\u2019ll be sold at this place too.\u201cHow are they? Buy a couple, and it\u2019s up to you how you play them! After you\u2019re sick of them, you can use them for your experiments. Even if they die, it\u2019s not a problem!\u201d The trader did his utmost to entice him.Leylin shook his head, \u201cI wish to purchase a few guards, preferably of Knight level. Also, I will need a few assistants for my experiments!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s like this!\u201d The trader stroked his chin, \u201cWhat you\u2019re looking for are premium slaves, and their price will be extraordinary! Of course, those who are able to enter here are customers with strength. Please follow me!\u201dLeylin walked behind the trader and saw many slaves. Some of them were well-built youths while some were still children. They were all staring outside from behind the fence looking fearful. From time to time a few Magi pointed at them or even walked forward to inspect them.Leylin even saw a group of Magi surrounding a few Beastmen and Marine Species slaves, bidding over them.The trader pulled Leylin to a large tent, and called a fatty over, \u201cThis is my friend, Dylan. Right, he has some premium goods.\u201dLeylin did not know what Dylan whispered to the trader, but after a while, the trader laughed heartily as he walked away. Only then Dylan smile towards Leylin and said, \u201cMost respected guest, I have already understood your requirements! We just received a new batch of premium slaves, please follow me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It masked the musky unwashed odor of the slaves and various bodily excrement. Despite this, the atmosphere was much better than outside.The slaves in here wore some thin clothes that could somewhat cover their private areas.Dylan brought Leylin to a few extremely muscled guys, \u201cThey were all raised and taught by a Knight! How do they look? I dare say these definitely meet your requirement!\u201dLeylin nodded his head and walked towards a large bald guy, \u201cA.I. Chip! Stat Scan!\u201d[Beep! Target\u2019s Strength: 3.1, Agility: 2.8, Vitality: 2.9, Spiritual Force: 1.5. Status: Dowsed in neurotoxin!]The other Knight Level slaves\u2019 stats were more or the less similar. Leylin observed that their pupils were widened and somewhat dispirited.\u201cThe mind of these Knights seem to have been affected by something\u2026\u2026\u201dDylan hurriedly smiled apologetically, \u201cKnights\u2019 resistances are always higher than normal, to meet the various needs of our customers, we are unable to use standard marking to control their consciousness! They have all undergone constant brainwashing and corporeal subjugation. Furthermore, they were controlled by drugs, turning them into high-level servants. Although they might not be as bright as regular Knights, they are still able to understand some simple commands.Branding of the consciousness was what official Magi used to control their servants. However, it was somewhat ineffective if acolytes were to use it.Dylan obviously noticed Leylin\u2019s strength before offering this batch of goods to him.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, what\u2019s the price?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201c100 Magic Crystals each!\u201d Dylan replied.Leylin nodded his head and picked out two with the best stats. After paying the Magic Crystals, he received a scorpion-like organism from Dylan.\u201cThe sting of this Desert Scorpion contains a unique poison. These poisonous secretions from this scorpion were used on your two slaves. If they do not take the antidote produced by the scorpion in 10 days time, they will die horribly! Of course, this is should be used as a last resort to control them. After all, during their training, they have already been brainwashed to obey their Master\u2019s commands! Now, the lives of these two Knights are yours!\u201dDylan respectfully handed the box containing the scorpion\u2019s sting.Leylin nodded his head and kept the box. \u201cAlso, I require a serving maid, one who can take on the role of assistant during experiments\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Leylin walked out of the market, two Knights wearing armour and a delicate yet pretty maid followed behind him.The maid\u2019s eyes were limpid and she wore a black cotton dress. According to Dylan, this maid received extensive training since she was young. She was more than capable to take on the role of an assistant for simple experiments. She met Leylin\u2019s requirements rather well. Moreover, she had taken the Mandara Flower\u2019s essence, which could counteract the radiation from a Magus. This kept her looking youthful.The cost was her life span, which was shortened to only 30 years.\u201cEllinel Market did pretty well in designing this level. We can actually choose our exits freely. However, this is a service only premium customers may enjoy!\u201dWhen Leylin and his servants appeared, they were no longer at the small village. They were at the outer walls of a city.This was a premium service provided by the Ellinel Market, but there was also a fee for it.If this helped him avoid more trouble, it was worth it for Leylin who was not very strong right now.\u201cMaster!\u201d The Knights and the maid knelt and saluted him.\u201cEn!\u201d Leylin nodded his head indifferently, \u201cDo you have names?\u201dThe two Knights looked at each other, and their eyes dimmed eventually, \u201cNo, please grant us one, Master!\u201d The maid too shook her head and indeed seemed rather pitiful.\u201cYou will be called Greem! He pointed to the larger Knight. \u201cYou will be called Fraser!\u201d This was another Knight.\u201cAs for you!\u201d Leylin looked at the beautiful maid, \u201cAnna will do!\u201d\u201cThank you for granting us names Master, we will loyally engrave it in our hearts!\u201d The three subordinates knelt on the ground and kissed Leylin\u2019s shoe.\u201cAlright.\u201d Leylin waved his hands and got them to stand. He then looked at his surroundings.It seemed to be a small forest, and there was even the silhouette of a large city ahead. It was, at least, ten times bigger than the city he was in earlier. The entrance had carriages and carts going in and out. It seemed to be flourishing.\u201cGreem! Go buy a horse carriage in the city, I\u2019ll wait for you here!\u201d Leylin tossed a black purse to the larger Knight.\u201cAlso, buy some goods for our journey, as well as some clothes!\u201d Leylin instructed him.Even since he destroyed his chest of spell books and sold all his potions, His remaining possessions amounted to over 3000 Magic Crystals all in all. His luggage too was reduced by more than half. He could fit all of them in a knapsack. As for the camping items he used previously, he already destroyed them before going to the market to save himself the trouble of going back.\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d Greem took the money purse and bowed slightly as he was about to leave.\u201cAlso, don\u2019t call me Sir from now on, Young Master will do!\u201d Leylin touched his youthful face and was somewhat stumped.\u201cWe obey!\u201d The three of them knelt on the ground.Seeing the figure of Greem leaving, Leylin suddenly turned and asked Fraser, \u201cDo you have any inkling of the time before you became a slave?\u201dFraser had brown hair and blue eyes, and his body was littered with scars. Moreover, his age could not be determined, but he seemed to have had an abundance of experiences and suffering.\u201cI can\u2019t remember anymore! Every time I try, I feel a splitting pain in my head.\u201d Fraser touched his forehead as if trying to recall something. His visage crumpled with pain.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this!\u201d Leylin surmised that it could be the influence of some drug or spell that was only effective on normal humans. Right now he could probably break it if he spent some time on it, but he absolutely had no intention of doing so.After all, his objective was to acquire subordinates, not to seek trouble. Those who were captured as slaves were the losers of battles and wars. If they were to recover their memories and seek Leylin\u2019s help, what should he do then? Even if they don\u2019t, who knows if they will continue remaining loyal to him.\u201cHow about you?\u201d Leylin looked at the shy Anna.Anna\u2019s skin was extremely white and gave off a milky glow. It made Leylin impulsively want to touch her. Her face too was extremely exquisite like a doll\u2019s.\u201cAnna has been raised by a merchant since childhood, and was eventually sold to Sir Dylan\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFor a maid like her, it was naturally more convenient to groom her at a very young age. Moreover, she had to learn various knowledge, and grooming of etiquette. Only then would she deserve the fondness of those higher ups. Of course, she had to take some lessons in pleasing men. Anna looked at Leylin who was still shrouded in the cloak, unable to discern his countenance. However, based on the voice alone, deduced that it should belong to a younger person. She could not help but blush.What lessons have you taken before? How much do you know about the Magi?\u201d\u201cI have learnt <The Science of All Living Things> and <Herbs Identification>, but\u2026\u2026but only some preparations of simple ingredients. Anna is not an acolyte. For experiments that require the use of energy particles, I am powerless in that area\u2026\u2026My apologies, Young Master!\u201d Anna\u2019s fingers clenched her dress and seemed discomfited.\u201cThat\u2019s not bad at all.\u201d Leylin was actually satisfied.He had many secrets. Letting an outsider join his experiments was inappropriate. Helping him with basic preparations was already good enough.If he wanted a Magus assistant, he or she must be at least acolyte level. This level of a slave is extremely expensive and was always riddled with problems too.Although he did not see any in the slave market, Leylin knew that some other place in the market, there would be another slave market that specialised in selling acolytes as slaves.After all, for many Dark Magi, it was only acolytes who could resist radiation, were to best subjects for their experiments.As to sources of such acolyte slaves, they made use of war criminals or prisoners.If Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was completely defeated, and the headquarters seized, then the fate of all the acolytes in the academy- apart from the ones backed by strong factions- will most likely end up as slaves.As for people like Leylin who escaped earlier, he could only draw a clear line between himself and the academy in future. And take the four seas as his home, becoming a pitiable wanderer.\u201cRight now, I can only pray that the academy wins\u2026\u2026 Even if they lose, I hope they don\u2019t lose badly\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin looked towards the West, his expression a little grim.Seeing Young Master become pensive, Anna and Fraser bowed their heads too, not daring to utter a word.With the noise of rolling wheels gradually getting closer, Leylin could see a Knight driving a horse carriage, the appearance seemed to be Greem.The horse carriage was pitch black in colour and did not have much in the way of patterns on it. The merchants who sold the carriage did not know if Greem belonged to the nobility, so they did not dare inscribe on the carriage. However, it looked extremely sturdy. A couple of large black horses were pulling it, dashing rapidly towards Leylin.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Greem got down the carriage, and handed the money purse back to Leylin with both hands, \u201cThe carriage cost\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need for further discussion.\u201d Leylin took it over, and then threw the money purse to Anna, \u201cIn the future you will deal with the finances, if there is not enough then ask me!\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u2019 Anna carefully kept the money purse.In it were only a few gold coins used by normal humans. Leylin only required a little effort to get as much as he wanted. What he was concerned about were the Magic Crystals, the currency used in the Magus World.It was a pity that even in the South Coastal Regions, Magic Crystals were in extremely high demand as currency. After visiting so many markets, Leylin could see shops exchange coins for Magic Crystals, but never the other way round.These were his subordinates in the future. After thinking for a while, Leylin undid his hood. and revealed a dashing face. His appearance, however, was still in its slightly altered state.\u201cYou will be my trusted aides in the future, so take a look at my true appearance!\u201dThe reason why Leylin disguised himself was to buy and sell resources. Right now since all his potions were sold, he did not need a disguise. These people also had to meet Leylin daily, so they will definitely see his true appearance\u2013so the sooner the better.After Leylin removed the spell, the muscles of his face twitched, and returned back to his original youthful visage.Seeing Anna and the rest nod their heads, Leylin commanded, \u201cLet\u2019s set off towards Eastwoods Province!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the driver\u2019s seat sat two large guys wearing metallic armour and long swords. One look and people got the message that they were not to be messed with. Farmers in the vicinity scurried out of their way.Inside the carriage, the smell of wood and lacquer mixed together and was somewhat unpleasant.Leylin\u2019s nose wrinkled as he caught a whiff of perfume. Seeing that Anna was blushing beside him, Leylin smiled and beckoned, \u201cCome here!\u201dWhen she drew near, Leylin made her recline halfway, then lay his head on her chest.His hands conveniently roved around Anna\u2019s thighs. The thin cotton fabric could not hide her beauty. Leylin felt as if both his hands were touching a piece of warm and soft jade.Savouring the softness he was leaning on, and hearing Anna\u2019s panting, made Leylin feel extremely content. He sighed, closed both his eyes and stayed still.He had had been feeling on edge lately, as he had to exercise prudence after every trade. This occupied a lot of Leylin\u2019s thoughts. Now that he did not have to do so anymore, Leylin could finally take a break, and obtain ample time to rest. He even had two Knights to take care of the trouble.Naturally, the two Knights would be sleeping outside, leaving the interior of the carriage to their Master and the maid. Leylin was no gentleman. Moreover, Anna was also quite a beauty and excelled in\u00a0that\u00a0area. Idling away in the carriage, he naturally had already bedded her. There was even a faint trace of dark red blood on the cabin\u2019s floor.As a maid bought by Leylin, how could Anna resist her Master? All along the journey, she served him wholeheartedly and tried various positions with him, which also satisfied a few of his fetishes.\u201cThankfully I am a magician. I can use magical herbs and undergo meditation to continuously recover and increase my Vitality. With the previous Leylin\u2019s sad physique, I would most likely have aged prematurely\u2026\u2026\u201dLeylin ordered mentally, \u201cA.I. Chip, show me my stats!\u201d[Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte. Strength: 2.7, Agility: 2.8, Vitality: 3.0, Spiritual Force: 4.6, Magical Power: 4.0. Status: Healthy]\u201cFour to five months have passed, and I persisted in meditation everyday. To think that there was only an increase of 0.2\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression was a little unsightly, \u201cI have to hurry to my destination and settle down to try brewing the ancient potions. Who knows when I will meet the requirements for advancing?\u201dAll acolytes encounter a bottleneck when advancing to Level 3. Even a fifth-grade acolyte like Jayden still requires years of training in order to breakthrough.After analysing the conditions needed to advance, mastering the spells and brewing Reactive Elixirs became trivial. Only getting past the 7 Spiritual Force bottleneck remained baffling for countless genius acolytes. Even official Magi did not have good solutions to address this aspect of Spiritual Force cultivation. Only constant painstaking meditation had any effectiveness or maybe the use potions and the sort could be an alternative. The cost of these, unfortunately, could not be borne by the typical acolyte.Right now Leylin too was stuck on the same Spiritual Force bottleneck.\u201cA.I. Chip! How is the analysis of the two potions? And what is the progress in deciphering Lowian\u2019s Teachings?\u201d[Beep! Azure Potion analysis progress: 100%, Tears of Mary analysis progress: 78%, Lowian\u2019s Teachings analysis progress: 63.7%] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cThe Azure Potion has been fully analysed long ago. Unfortunately, the main ingredients are now completely extinct. Finding substitutes requires countless experiments. As for the Tears of Mary, it has been at 78% for 3 months now with no signs of progress at all. Could some crucial procedures be missing?Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed; the A.I. Chip\u2019s processing ability was extremely powerful. The progress in analysing the ancient potion Tears of Mary analysis stagnated at 78%, which made Leylin rather surprised.\u201cThese formulas that Professor Kroft gave me should be correct. If the A.I. Chip could not analyse them after all this time, it might have met with some difficult question that was beyond the parameters of the databank\u2026\u2026Tears of Mary! Tears!\u201d Leylin guessed.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u2026That this ancient potion formula has something to do with a soul?\u201dAfter all hearing the name of this potion, one will easily associate it with some ill-fated event.As for Lowian\u2019s Teachings, the progress was rather good. Although the creator used extremely complicated coding to ensure secrecy, the A.I. Chip was least daunted by the complicated computations.Leylin roughly knew the general contents of this scroll through reading the previous portions that have been analysed.\u201cUnfortunately, though this item is not bad, I can only make use of it when I become a Level 3 Acolyte!\u201dLeylin shook his head and got rid of these distracting thoughts.Suddenly, the horse carriage stopped.Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed as he asked, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cYoung Master please be at ease, it is merely a group of bandits who have blocked the path!\u201d Fraser has already gone over to take care of it!\u201d Greem\u2019s voice travelled through the wooden wall.* Ping Pang! Bang! *As expected, moments later it seemed that negotiations failed. The sound of various weapons clashing could be heard. After a few profanities and continuous wailing, Fraser\u2019s voice was heard saying \u201cIt\u2019s settled.\u201d The horse carriage once again resumed the journey.This kind of an outcome made Leylin feel very satisfied.The reason why he bought two Knights and a maid was so that all the trifling matters would be handled by them, allowing him more time to focus on researching spells and doing more experiments.These matters along the way were trivial. Leylin had the faint outline of a plan that would require the participation of many people to accomplish. And these 3 people were at the core of it.\u201cYoung\u2026\u2026Young Master!\u201d Anna who was behind him, let off a low pant.Only then did Leylin realise that his hand slipped. While he was deep in thought, his hand had unknowingly touched Anna\u2019s private part.Leylin smiled and withdrew his hand.Seeing that Anna\u2019s face was still flushed, he said, \u201cRight now Young Master is occupied with something! I\u2019ll have time tonight to play with you\u2026\u2026\u201dThese intimate words made Anna somewhat shy as she lowered her head.Pretending not to see the temptation right in front of him, he said \u201cA.I. Chip! Transmit the fully analysed Azure Potion formula!\u201dLeylin always drew a clear line between entertainment and research. At the most crucial moment, he would definitely not be infatuated and lose the will to improve.\u2026\u2026Seeing Leylin had already closed both his eyes, Anna\u2019s eyes dulled. She then rearranged her clothes back to its former neatness and tried her best to adjust her body so that Leylin could rest more comfortably\u2026\u2026\u201dNight fell after what felt like a moment.Leylin regained consciousness after meditation.\u201cYoung Master! There is a city not far from here!\u201d Greem\u2019s voice travelled over.\u201cWhere are we now?\u201d\u201cAccording to the markings on the map, we should have already entered Eastwoods Province. This is Roran City, which is situated at the provincial borders!\u201dThe crashing sounds of things being rummaged sounded, as Fraser spoke.\u201cRoran City huh?\u201d Leylin muttered to himself and adjusted the map stored in the A.I. Chip.On the faint blue map, a red coloured line was linked with many cities. Roran City was towards the west of Extreme Night City, only several days\u2019 journey.\u201cAfter half a year of travelling, we are finally arriving huh?\u201d Leylin felt a little rueful.The reason why he chose this place earlier was its distance from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy- he wouldn\u2019t be affected by the conflicts taking place over there. Another consideration was that only by being far away from the academy, would he be able to conduct a few prohibited experiments.After all, he had the A.I. Chip in his body and also the process for many of the experiments were very unusual. If he had experimented at the academy, using the remnants or rubbish, the possibility of being discovered was inevitable.However, Leylin felt less restrained ever since he had left- like a caged canary that was set free and soared into the sky.Leylin opened the carriage door, and a gust of cold wind blew in.\u201cThe feeling of freedom!\u201d Leylin looked at the city, which seemed a little desolate, and the nearby farmers. He could not help but smile.\u201cFirst find us a place to lodge in We\u2019ll set off tomorrow morning!\u201dLeylin gave the orders. In the wild, it was natural to either stay in the horse carriage or inside a tent. However, since they had reached human habitation, Leylin naturally did not want to deprive himself of this chance.The black-coloured horse carriage entered the city under the respectful gaze of the guard.To the people in Eastwoods Province, having a horse carriage, guards and a maid, elevated Leylin to the level of idle nobility.In fact, Leylin was indeed a descendant of nobility. It was just that it was not this continent\u2019s nobility.Leylin never considered using the dukedom title from Chernobyl Islands here. However, the status of a noble could indeed greatly reduce problems.After finding a place at a local inn for lodging, Leylin called an attendant over.\u201cDo you know where I can hire people here?\u201d Leylin played with a gold coin in his hands.Seeing Anna behind Leylin, and staring intently at the gold coin in Leylin\u2019s hands, the attendant could not help but to gulp down a mouthful of saliva.\u201cMost respected Sire! If you require attendants, the employment marketplace beside the City Lord\u2019s Manor would be your best choice. There, you can hire strong warriors, proficient housekeepers, and even various maids and stable hands\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cVery good! Bring me there tomorrow and this gold coin will be yours!\u201d Leylin smiled.This time, he could stay in Extreme Night City for a long period. Leylin naturally wanted peace and quiet. He required people who could carry out his bidding. Since he did not want to be controlled by others, he would not be able to avoid wielding his own influence.With Anna and the two knights as his core retainers, and hiring a few more from Roran City, his retinue would be more or less complete.Although he could hire more people in Extreme Night City, they will definitely be infiltrated. As for Roran City, although it could not be avoided, it was good to reduce the numbers and influences to a minimum.Dinner was white bread with vegetable soup. Although the shop owner had already taken out the best items to serve Leylin, it was still somewhat lacking compared to the academy\u2019s cafeteria.As Leylin was eating, many customers in the shop hid in the corner. They wore grey or brown coarse robes. Their gazes carried respect and fear.Looking at the empty space around him, Leylin smiled bitterly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRoran HawksThe next morning, Leylin was guided to the employment marketplace in Roran City by the attendant.The employment marketplace was beside the City Lord\u2019s Manor, so the public security there was not bad. At the very least Leylin did not see any brawls taking place.Along the way, there were many people who looked at Leylin and his group. They were especially interested in Anna, who was behind Leylin, as she was an exceptional beauty, and was even more so after some dressing up. Fortunately, they did not dare try anything funny for they were rather fearful of Greem who was covered in steel armour.\u201cSir! This is the employment marketplace in Roran City. All the people you require can be found here, besides you can also issue any mission related hiring\u2026\u2026\u201d The attendant explained to Leylin\u2019s group of three.As for Fraser, Leylin made him stay at the inn to look after the horse carriage and luggage.Although the important possessions such as potion ingredients and Magic Crystals were on Leylin, if they were to lose a few items like gold coins and the sort, it would prove rather troublesome.Leylin surveyed the employment marketplace before him.In his view was a large field, with groups of stable hands, mercenaries and the sort squatting on the ground, waiting for some employer to hire them.Leylin knew that there had to be a slave market too, however it could not be displayed blatantly out in the open. After all, even a Magus market had to organise one covertly.However this was well within Leylin\u2019s plans, he only wanted an entourage to hire here, so his requirements were lower.\u201cYoung Sir, may I help you with anything?\u201d As Leylin entered the marketplace, a group of traders and merchants swarmed around him. They were obviously dazzled by Leylin\u2019s lavish attire and shouted themselves hoarse as they tried to promote their products.\u201cI need a group of mercenaries to escort me to Extreme Night City, and also to guard my estate there. The contract duration would be at least two years!\u201d Looking at the fervent traders, Leylin stated his requirements.After reaching this part of the continent, Leylin realised that the novels, in his previous world talking about mercenary groups and bandit gangs and the like, were all nonsense.Apart from a few large cities that Leylin was yet to visit, in Roran City and other smaller city marketplaces, there were no such groups to speak of.All such employment, assassinations or similar missions, were arranged at the local bars or trade offices, some locations were even extremely bizarre.\u201cAfter all, the costs have to be factored in, and, if the remuneration does not even cover the cost of operations, there wouldn\u2019t be any fool who would be willing to toss their gold coins into the water!\u201d\u201cThen could I inquire if you have any requirements regarding the number of escorts and their strength?\u201d A skinny man with a shiny bald head squeezed through the traders, and asked loudly.\u201cNumber of people huh? Around 10 to 15! Their strength only needs to be equivalent to the average guard\u2019s standard. The only request I have is loyalty and honour! As the mission might extend over 2 years, I will have to issue a contract, and the salary is to be given monthly!\u201dLeylin said blandly.\u201cIn that case, I have a group of mercenaries here that fits your requirements!\u201d The bald trader smiled.\u201cThe Roran Hawks Mercenary Group has just finished their vacation. Moreover, they are citizens of Roran City, so their reputation can definitely be assured of!\u201d The bald trader explained.Leylin noticed that when the baldy mentioned the Roran Hawks Mercenary Group, the crowd all turned silent. There were even respected and envious looks. It seemed like the Roran Hawks had a large reputation around here.\u201cAlright then! Bring me to have a look at them, the commission will definitely be given to you later!\u201d Leylin said.\u201cPlease follow me!\u201d The bald trader led the way, bringing Leylin out of the marketplace.After the attendant in the inn received his gold coin, he bade his farewell. Anna and Greem followed closely behind Leylin; the current group of four walked on for about half an hour before reaching the southern part of the city.Having reached here, the surrounding buildings were constructed differently. If the central part of the city was modelled after the City Lord\u2019s Manor, with the buildings being extremely imposing and respectful, then the southern part of the buildings were multi-coloured with various styles. Very much like residential estates.\u201cThis seems to be the area where the free citizens of the city gather!\u201d Leylin muttered as he looked at the crushed rock laid into a pavement, and the small flower terrace and stone-made lamp.\u201cYou have a good eyesight, Sir. Those who live here are predominantly the traders and free citizens of Roran City. The Roran Hawks Mercenary Group also reside here!\u201d\u201cAre you not going to bring us to the training grounds of this mercenary group?\u201d Green asked at the side.\u201cRespected Sir! Roran Hawks Mercenary Group is only a small unit, and their number does not exceed 30. Their reputation is only spread within Roran City. It is only a casual alliance formed by their leader. The cost of renting some space for them to train would have made their mission earnings obsolete. Thus, who would be willing to do that?\u201d The baldy said with a wry smile\u201cNormally, the members are each busy with their own matters. They gather only when they receive a mission!\u201d Saying which, the baldy looked at Leylin, and smiled apologetically, \u201cAlthough the Roran Hawks Mercenaries are few in number, most of them are retired veterans. Moreover, their leader was once a middle ranked troop leader in the army, and his strength is not bad\u2026\u2026\u201dObviously, the baldy was worried about Leylin being prejudiced against the mercenary group, but these matters could not be concealed either, so he could only say before they found out.\u201cA middle-ranked troop leader huh? I am looking forward to meeting him!\u201d Leylin smiled, he actually did not really mind who he hired in Roran City, as their roles will primarily be to run errands for him in future.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived!\u201d The baldy brought Leylin and the rest in front of a two-storeyed villa. Within a circle surrounded by a rosewood fence, there was a small pond and garden. There was a type of small white flower, their petals being extremely small, but with a dense aroma, a middle-aged lady was currently watering the flowers.\u201cHello! Madam Lariette! Is Fayern around? I have brought some business for him!\u201d The baldy greeted the lady watering the plants.\u201cOf course\u00a0he\u2019s around, my dear friend!\u201d Before the lady got to respond, a bold and unrestrained voice sounded from within the house.A large guy wearing a white-coloured shirt walked over and hugged the baldy.\u201cMy dearest Fayern! Let me introduce to you\u2014\u00a0this is Sir Leylin who came from the central part of our city. He wishes to employ your Roran Hawks Mercenary Group to escort him to Extreme Night City!\u201d The baldy explained to Fayern.\u201cHello! Respected Sir, if you choose to go to Extreme Night City, then the Roran Hawks Mercenary Group would be your best bet. We have traversed the route over 100 times, and recognise every rock, nook and cranny on the path.\u201dFayern bowed slightly towards Leylin and laughed as he spoke loudly.Leylin noticed that this group leader\u2019s eyes had been sizing up the three of them. Especially lingering on Greem for a while, as if discovering something. However, he overlooked Leylin.\u201cA crude outer appearance but his inner qualities are astute! He is also a Preparatory Knight!\u201d Leylin observed, and at this moment, the A.I. Chip scanned Fayern\u2019s stats.[Name: Fayern. Strength: 1.8, Agility: 1.5, Vitality: 1.7, Spiritual Force: 1.4]These stats amongst Preparatory Knights was only considered average, however from Fayern\u2019s callus and multiple scars on both of his hands, it can be seen that he has bountiful experience as a mercenary.\u201cWe can discuss this later, won\u2019t you invite us in to take a seat?\u201d Leylin smiled, and gestured towards the villa.\u201cOh, of course I will! Please enter!\u201d Fayern patted his head and moved his body while bowing. His right hand stretched, making an invitation for them to enter.After exiting the garden, it was soon the living room of the villa.The floor was painted red, and on one the four surrounding walls there hung a rusty and stained cross blade. Beside it was a skull belonging to an elk, with bent antlers that were intertwined and had a jet-black lustre.Fayern cordially invited Leylin and the group to have a rest on the sofa in the living room. He also asked Madam Lariette to give Leylin and the rest a beverage similar to black tea and then began to discuss the details.\u201cI heard from Nigel that this respected Young Master wants to go to Extreme Night City? If it is not inconvenient, could you tell me the reason why? Please forgive me, only after assessing the risk can the group make preparations for it\u2026\u2026\u201d Fayern\u2019s tone was rather sincere.Leylin sipped on this beverage similar to black tea\u2014\u00a0it was rather sweet and salty\u00a0and thus he did not like its taste\u2014\u00a0before he placed the cup down.\u201cRegarding the mission this time, I only wanted to start some business there, and require manpower for security. Do not worry about any other trouble!\u201d Leylin looked at Fayern, while the latter was rather embarrassed and looked down.Obviously, Fayern assumed Leylin was the bastard son of a noble who had lost in a power struggle and was sent away.\u201cThe reason why I hire you was because the people in Roran City will not be easily bought when compared to those in Extreme Night City. Moreover, I have received news that there were some interesting events recently happening within Extreme Night City\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin smiled and said.\u201cInteresting events?\u201d Group Leader Fayern guessed, \u201cIs it about the incident where the the vegetation near the surroundings of Extreme Night City suddenly withered? \u201d\u201cCorrect! A forest, the size of a small village, suddenly withered. It really makes one worried. Because of this incident, I believe it is necessary to increase the strength of the guards.\u201d\u201cConcerning the earnings, I can give each a monthly salary of one gold coin. However, each one must sign an employment contract for agreeing to follow my commands for at least 2 years or more.\u201dLeylin interlocked the 10 fingers of his hands, as he gave his opinion.Fayern\u2019s face was indecisive, clearly he was making a choice. After being silent for some time, he struggled to say, \u201cThe other matters will be alright, what about the mission duration?\u201d\u201cAlthough the period of two years is rather long, you don\u2019t really have to always stay at Extreme Night City. I promise you during any idle period, I will grant them leave to visit their loved ones. Also, if they want to bring their wife and family over to Extreme Night City, I can also arrange an appropriate position for them\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin\u2019s voice reverberated in the living room.\u201cSir, I have seen your sincerity. I would like to talk it over with a few of my brothers; after all, I do not run the mercenary group alone. I can give you an answer tomorrow, so please be rest assured, Sir!\u201d, said Fayern as he stood up and bowed slightly.\u201cGood! We will wait for good news from you!\u201d While Fayern saluted, Leylin calmly got up and together with his servants and the bald trader, left the villa.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA VisitA golden object arced, flashing in the light, and landed in the arms of the bald trader.\u201cTake this; it\u2019s the commission that you deserve.\u201d Leylin said\u201cMany thanks for your conferment, most respected Young Master!\u201d The baldy hurriedly bowed.\u201cNext, I need a housekeeper and two people who can keep accounts well! If you\u2019re able to find them for me, this gold coin is yours!\u201d Leylin flicked a gold coin on his hand.\u201cLet me think! Let me think!\u201d Seeing that it was another gold coin waving its hand at him, the baldy suddenly became lively. He began muttering incoherently while grabbing his bald head and racking his brains. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Old Welker! Old Welker was a housekeeper for a Baron before. Recently, He has been saying that he wants to come out again to make a living!\u201dThe bald trader said.\u201cVery good! Bring me to him!\u201d Leylin nodded his head approvingly.Two days later, in the morning. While the mist still had not completely dissipated, there was still some frostiness lingering in the cold morning air.* Creak! * Roran City gates opened slowly, and a horse carriage emerged from between them.A dozen odd mercenaries, wearing broken armour and carrying metal spears and bows, escorted a large horse carriage as it slowly left the city.In front of the horse carriage, Fayern was leading a brown colored handsome steed. Behind him was a 20 year old mercenary carrying a red-coloured flag. On it was embroidered the image of a hawk; the insignia of the Roran Hawks Mercenary Group.Greem rode close to the horse carriage having given up the driver seat. The person who sat there instead was a white haired geezer. Although he faced the wind and his hair was blown about wildly, his clothes were impeccable and without any creases.He was the housekeeper that Leylin got\u2013 Old Welker. Earlier, the Baron he served had gone bankrupt, hence, he became jobless. He was of the same beat as the bald trader who visited him and joined Leylin\u2019s party.Going from Roran City to Extreme Night City only required 7 days. Roran Hawks Mercenary Group was worthy of Fayern\u2019s praise. They were extremely familiar with the route and could even find lodging along the way, saving them from the hassle of setting up camp.7 days later, the group safely arrived at Extreme Night City.Leylin lifted open the hanging screen on the horse carriage and saw that the clouds ahead were rather dark. The layers of cloud were crowded together, completely blocking any sunrays. It seemed that it would rain soon.There was also a shadow cast on the surrounding bushes and grasses, which made it look very gloomy.\u201cFayern!\u201d Leylin walked out of the horse carriage\u2019s door, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Extreme Night City has a large area of vegetation that withered? Which area was that?\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Fayern grasped the reins firmly and reduced the pace of the horses to match the pace of the horse carriage.\u201cExtreme Night City is enormous. These mysterious happenings only belong to a small portion in the eastern part. Normally, we try our best to detour around that area. After all, humans have also done their best to avoid danger\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is that forest?\u201d Leylin leaned against the side of the door, as if he was enjoying the scenery.\u201cThe eastern part of Dark Night Woods is closer to the core of the city!\u201d Fayern looked at Leylin and he lowered his voice and said, \u201cDark Night Woods had an abundance of certain herbs. Ever since the withering event, however, the supply of herbs in Extreme Night City has decreased by 30%!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Leylin smiled. Extreme Night City was considered a large city in Eastwoods Province and one of the pillars of its economy was the herb industry. Now, it seemed that most likely the City\u2019s Lord and his officers were worried about the situation.\u201cDark Night Woods? I\u2019ll remember it!\u201d Although the woods in the kingdom were rather dangerous, this was only true for normal humans. Leylin even traversed his academy\u2019s Abyssal Bone Forest, so naturally he was not worried about the present dangers.\u201cDid any of the herb gatherers disappear in the withering zone?\u201d Leylin asked suddenly.\u201cHerb gatherers? You mean various hired hands, bandits and adventurers?\u201d Fayern shrugged his shoulders, \u201cThe woods are full of dangers, and a few people dying is very normal, so who knows?\u201dAs the two conversed, the horse carriage slowly approached Extreme Night City.The city walls were not very high, yet they were extremely thick. It seemed to be made by piling granite rocks, and was extremely sturdy.The guard at the city gates recognised Fayern and allowed the horse carriage to enter after payment of the toll fee.\u201cLet\u2019s find lodging first!\u201d Leylin ordered briefly.\u2026\u2026Night approached, and Leylin sent Anna, who was serving him, away and stayed alone in the inn\u2019s room.Opening the window, a cold gust of air blew in. The outside was extremely dark, and there were few lighted lamps.Leylin closed the door and took out a blue coloured crystal ball from the sack he carried at all times.This crystal ball was extremely small and let off a strange glow. In the centre of the glass were many golden specks of light that continuously rove about like little fireflies.\u201cActivate!\u201d Leylin muttered an incantation.The specks in the crystal ball started to shift about until finally forming a strange symbol.This symbol was rather curvy and swirled continuously. It finally looked like an eye that was bloodshot..Leylin\u2019s expression was extremely solemn. First he turned the symbol towards his face allowing his somewhat skinny face to be reflected onto the crystal ball.\u201cShadow Calendar, Year 1032, Month of the severe cold, Day of the ravens weeping.\u201d Leylin enunciated slowly in an extremely distinct voice.\u201cToday, I have arrived at Extreme Night City and am currently residing at Hoof\u2019s Inn.\u201d Leylin turned the crystal ball so the surroundings were reflected into the symbol inside. He then walked over to the windowsill and soaked up the imagery outside.\u201cCurrently, news has it that the withering area belongs to the east area, Dark Night Woods. As of this recording, there have been no reports of any member\u2019s death. Tomorrow I will prepare to set off and enquire, maybe gather new information.\u201d\u201cThe above mentioned records are by: Level 2 Acolyte, Leylin Farlier!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Leylin wiped the crystal ball with his pale white fingers. *Hehe! Hehe!* From within the crystal ball came a strange sound, like a kid\u2019s laughter. Following which, the eye symbol flickered and disappeared, turning back into countless golden specks of lightThe crystal ball was given by the academy to Leylin to be used as proof of having undertaken the mission.The crystal ball was able to record a few scenes and voices.\u00a0All that\u00a0Leylin had to do was to record\u00a0every important\u00a0event during the mission. He could then hand it over as proof upon returning to the academy.Of course, the crystal ball\u2019s controlling right was with Leylin. As long as he did not want to activate it, the crystal ball would not be able to record anything without his magical support.This was why Abyssal Bone Forest Academy dared to allow their acolytes to go out on long term missions without fear of being duped.\u201cFrom Fayern\u2019s description, the withering danger zone is not that huge. I\u2019m afraid that it could either be some tree demons or organisms that feed on humans. A Level 2 Acolyte would be more than enough to deal with them!\u201dLeylin weighed things carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t have to be that frantic, I still have over two years! I should first send some mercenaries over to have a look\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe most important thing at hand now is to settle down here. Moreover, I have to visit a \u2018friend\u2019\u2026\u2026 Leylin\u2019s lips curved into a mysterious smile.Although the location of Extreme Night City was rather remote, it was close to a few Magi resource points. There was even a Magic Crystal Mine nearby that was being excavated. Of course, the resources were already exhausted, but they still attracted a good number of wandering Magi and small families. It even gave rise to a small scale Magus market and was indicated on the map Bicky gave.Moreover, within the short span of time while they were entering the city, the A.I. Chip had already picked out several energy waves emitted by other acolytes. It seems that there were quite a few acolytes living in this city.This was extremely normal, as wandering magicians or those who were reclusive preferred remote towns to settle in, and to better conceal their identities.Of course, due to having longer lifespans, appearance and radiation emissions, they cannot stay in the same area for long, often changing locations after a few years.While Leylin was thinking thus, he yelled, \u201cAnna!\u201d\u201cYoung Master, what are your instructions!\u201d Not long after, Anna entered wearing a beautiful red dress. As she curtseyed, her snow white calves were revealed.\u201cPrepare a gift; I want to pay someone a visit tomorrow!\u201d\u201cAs to the specifics, Welker will tell you!\u201d Leylin yawned and stated blandly.After dismissing the somewhat disappointed Anna, Leylin casually set up an energy particle array as an early warning device before he blew out the candles and entered dreamland.The next morning, Leylin left with Anna who brought along a beautiful hat.\u201cIs this the gift that Old Welker picked?\u201d Leylin took the cap and gave it a once-over, realising that it was made of beast hide. It was very smooth to the touch, and there was also a feather stuck on it.\u201cHousekeeper Welker said that in Extreme Night City, Sticking the Night Hawk\u2019s feather on a leather cap represents peaceful intent and friendliness. It is the gift of choice when paying a visit for the first time!\u201d Anna put on a rather frightened expression.\u201cYoung\u2026\u2026Young Master! Are you going to visit another \u2018Sire\u2019?\u201d Anna\u2019s voice became somewhat shaky.\u201cYes! He is also an acolyte!\u201d Leylin lowered his voice, so that it was only audible to Anna and himself.After he spoke, he saw the young girl\u2019s shoulder trembled. Leylin smiled, Anna was sold to a Magus before she was resold as a slave. It seemed to have been a traumatic experience for her.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, you can always go back first!\u201d Leylin moved forward and embraced Anna\u2019s slender waist.\u201cNo! Anna wants to go together with Young Master!\u201d Anna forced herself to smile.Leylin shook his head, \u201cFollow me if you want to!\u201dExtreme Night City\u2019s construction was somewhat gothic with sharp spikes on the roof tops. The pavements were also layered with smooth rocks giving the impression that Extreme Night City was one of the wealthier cities around.As Leylin and Anna neared the eastern side of the city, the people\u2019s outfits here became much more urbane than that of other places and the decorations on the buildings became more gorgeous too.\u201cIt seems like the east of Extreme Night City is where the nobles and scholars congregate.\u201dLeylin looked at the clusters of flowers on both sides of the road. There was even an outdoor fountain. He could not help but smile as he said to Anna.Afterwards, the two of them came to a white-coloured two storey villa. On the door plate was hung, \u201cCecelia Main Street, 59\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A crisp ring of a bell could be heard, followed by the noise of scurrying footsteps.\u201cHello! May I ask who you are? Do you have an appointment?\u201d A meticulous looking butler appeared in front of Leylin.\u201cLeylin Farlier, I am here to visit the owner of this villa!\u201d Leylin smiled.The butler obviously looked distressed as he said, \u201cSir, as you know, my master, Murphy, is a renowned scholar. His schedule every day is extremely packed, perhaps\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this moment, a girl, who seemed like the maid, hurriedly ran over and whispered into the butler\u2019s ears.The butler\u2019s complexion immediately changed as he bowed deeply, \u201cMaster invites you into the living room!\u201dLeylin smiled as he retrieved the energy waves he radiated.Upon entering inside the villa, there was a corridor littered with various art pieces like paintings and exhibited on the faint yellow colored walls were all kinds of oil paintings, and other specimens of art, which were rather pleasing to the eyes.As the living room came into view, it became quite obvious that it was a spacious house.The decor in the room was extremely aesthetic. Although there were no dazzling golden or silver items or gems, these pieces had an aura of history and gave off a feeling of understated elegance.Beside the fireplace in the living room, an old scholar with white brows and beard lounged on a dark red recliner.The old man\u2019s eyes seemed muddy with only occasional traces of intelligence within.The old man\u2019s originally squinted eyes opened upon seeing Leylin. He stood up and spread his arms in an embracing gesture, \u201cWelcome, my young friend!\u201dLeylin went forward to hug the old man, \u201cIt is an honour to be able to meet you! I hope you like this present I brought for you!\u201dAnna stepped forward and handed over to the butler an extremely exquisite cap.\u201cI like the tail feathers of the night hawk. They represent peace!\u201d The old man waved his hands, \u201cLille, you may take your leave, I want to have a good chat with this friend of mine!\u201d\u201cTake your leave too!\u201d Leylin told Anna who was beside him.After extending their salutations, the few maids and the butler left, closing the door behind them. Very soon, there was only Leylin and the old man left in the living room.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s reintroduce ourselves! Murphy, Level 3 Acolyte! I have been a resident of Extreme Night City for 3 years now\u2026\u2026\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes showed signs of his reminiscing past events.\u201cSo then, guest from afar, how about you?\u201d\u201cLeylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte and wandering Magus. I have recently come to Extreme Night City and wish to reside here for several years.\u201d Leylin smiled and executed the bow between Magi.\u201cI detect signs of youth in your body. Being able to advance into Level 2 Acolyte at this age, you have a rather great aptitude!\u201d Murphy sighed in admiration.\u201cI was just lucky\u2026\u2026\u201d Leylin demurred. Although the old man\u2019s body had degenerated, the energy waves of a Level 3 Acolyte told anyone that it was not good to provoke him.\u201cA.I. Chip, initiate scan!\u201d[Murphy. Strength: 1.5, Agility: 1.4, Vitality: 2.9, Spiritual Force: 2.9, Magical Power: 8. Status: Healthy. Evaluation: Level 3 Acolyte, relatively dangerous!]The A.I. Chip faithfully relayed the figures onto Leylin\u2019s field of vision.Being a wandering Level 3 Acolyte, Murphy\u2019s array of magic spells definitely surpassed Leylin\u2019s. Moreover, he would have some extremely-difficult-to-deal-with trump cards hidden to protect his life.However, Leylin came with good intentions. From the A.I. Chip\u2019s area scan, the number of acolytes residing in Extreme Night City was not high. As for this Murphy, he radiated one of the strongest energy waves.After exchanging several polite greetings, Leylin delved immediately into the main purpose of his visit.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this! I wish to reside permanently in Extreme Night City, and even open an ingredients shop. You know, the procedures are extremely tedious, and I also need a resident to act as my guarantor\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you came here to look for me?\u201d Murphy smiled, and drank the cup of red tea that was on the table.\u201cTo be honest, as an ambitious and truth seeking Magus, gold coins and the like should no longer sway us. Although I don\u2019t know why you arrived at this conclusion, on a whim perhaps? Or for some other reason? To me, this indeed is a small matter!\u201d\u201cCoincidentally, I have some friendly relations with the Lord of Extreme Night City. One of his sons is also under my tutelage. Moreover, any city lord will not refuse the request of a Mysterious Entity\u2026\u2026 The residential procedures here in Extreme Night City, as well as the shop permit, can all be settled very easily.\u201d Murphy guaranteed.\u201cThen I must really thank you!\u201d Leylin nodded his head, \u201cIf there are any areas I could help you with, do not hesitate to ask!\u201dAlthough this was said to satisfy the requirements of etiquette, both Leylin and the old man knew that it was mentioned as a mere courtesy.The handling of residential procedures may be difficult to regular humans. However, for a famous scholar like Murphy, it was only a matter of a few words. Even if Leylin wanted to handle these procedures by himself, he would have to spend more time than the old man.For both Murphy and Leylin, this matter was simply a means to establish a basic friendship of convenience between them.\u201cExtreme Night City is a peaceful and quiet place. If you wish to have peaceful days then this place will definitely meet your needs. Later on, I will also introduce you to a few friends of mine. However, there are some set conventional customs that have to be complied with\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t worry, they are all customary practices, for example, one should not massacre the residents or something like that!\u201d\u201cI definitely agree!\u201d Leylin\u2019s coming to Extreme Night City was to avoid the chaos of war and intrigue. Naturally he would not do anything that would draw attention to himself.Leylin and Murphy then talked about many Magi related questions, from how to stabilise a spell model for advanced levels to some of Murphy\u2019s personal adventures.Although Murphy was only a Level 3 Acolyte, his experience was abundant due to having remained at this level for a long time already. This made Leylin feel that the trip was not in vain.On the other hand, Leylin\u2019s vast knowledge and eidetic memory shocked Murphy.Both of them regretted not having met earlier. They even had their lunch together all the way until dusk before Murphy let Leylin leave. When they bade farewell, they even arranged for their next meeting.\u201cAccording to what Murphy said, the magicians in Extreme Night City are all of the acolyte level. As for the few nearby cities, official Magi were also extremely rare making this place very suitable for an acolyte to live in!\u201dThe inquiries he made today caused Leylin to feel at ease, letting him walk at a slower and a more relaxed pace.\u201cOnly regarding this case where plants and wood withered is Murphy completely ignorant. After all, he is already quite old and does not wish to take risks\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two street lamps were lit with a dim yellow flame, allowing Leylin to see the road ahead.Anna followed quietly behind Leylin. Being an outstanding maid, she obviously knew what she had to do, which was not to interrupt Leylin while he was deep in thought.After Leylin ran through a simulation of his plans one more time, they had both arrived at the inn.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d \u201cSir!\u201dOld Welker, Greem and Fraser came forward to receive them.Leylin nodded his head, \u201cAfter dinner all of you come to my room. There are many things I want to inform all of you regarding my future plans!\u201dDinner was vegetable salad and mutton soup, followed by huge pieces of dried cookies. After Leylin finished and allowed Anna to clean up, the core people among his subordinates went to Leylin\u2019s room.Leylin sat on a chair wrapped in beast hide and quietly listened to their reports.\u201cWelker, how was the search for a residence?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, Old Welker has already contacted a Knight who is preparing to move to Sage Province. He is willing to sell a small manor in Extreme Night City to you.\u201d Old Welker reported. Despite being an old man, he was brimming with energy after finding them a new home.\u201cVery good, what is the area like? Is the place enough to house all of us? How much is it?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cPlease be at ease Young Master. Old Welker, I have gone to the manor and taken a look today. The area was very big and has no problem accommodating a hundred people. Moreover, there is even an oil palm forest, a fish pond and a mill. Knight Victor originally built it according to a baron\u2019s standards. He never thought that it would change ownership this quickly. As for the price, Knight Victor has set it at 5000 gold coins!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that expensive, gold coins aren\u2019t an issue!\u201d Leylin twined his fingers. To a Magus, such earthly items as gold coins are insignificant. What they were concerned with were only Magic Crystals, high-grade ingredients, and the acquisition of remnant ancient knowledge.Leylin had high-grade Magic Crystals of his own. Any one piece would be able to fetch a price far surpassing this amount of gold coins. However, Leylin was not prepared to do that. After all, Magic Crystals were rarer. If he really could not get the gold coins, then he would go borrow some from Murphy in exchange for a few potions\u2013which was not a bad idea at all.\u201cVery well!\u201d Let\u2019s take a look tomorrow. If the price and the area are both suitable, we can sign the contract immediately.\u201d Leylin nodded his head, saying, \u201cAlso, go walk the streets and scout something for me. Recently, the herbs available in Extreme Night City have decreased. There will definitely be many small-sized shops that can no longer manage and are about to close down. Go and look into them first!\u201d\u201cForgive me for asking, but Young Master, are you thinking of opening a herb shop? The permit for doing such business has rather strict requirements\u2026\u2026\u201d Fayern said.\u201cRegarding that, none of you have to worry. I have already made arrangements. The permit will be here in a few days.\u201dHearing this, Fayern and Old Welker were dazed. To be able to guarantee such a thing quite easily, Leylin\u2019s identity as a noble had already been confirmed.\u201cIn Poolfield Kingdom, the nobility represents progress and hope!\u201dWith this in mind, their gazes towards Leylin became more fervent.Fayern silently clenched his fists. Being one of the few who could look ahead, he naturally knew that he could not work as a mercenary for much longer. Most of the mercenaries carried a lot of injuries and scars with to their graves knowing little enjoyment in their typically short lives. However, getting hired by this Sir Leylin as his private army could be the fastest way out of the trade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Walking on it was like walking on a golden, paved road.Today Leylin had especially changed into formal ceremonial attire. He had Greem personally drive the horse carriage to Murphy\u2019s villa.Similarly, Murphy also wore formal attire and carried a black cane as he waited. After seeing Leylin, his wrinkled face revealed a joyous expression, \u201cWelcome, my friend!\u201d\u201cMy apologies for being a little late!\u201d Leylin opened the window and said.\u201cThe agreed time isn\u2019t up yet, I just deliberately got out earlier!\u201d Murphy got into the horse carriage with the help of his servant. With the crack of the whip, Greem drove the horse carriage towards the centre of the city.\u201cCity Lord\u2019s banquet is to be held today. He invited you too. After all, as the owner, he has developed a curiosity for any guest with strength\u2026\u201d Murphy left his sentence hanging.\u201cThat\u2019s understandable!\u201d Leylin answered. As someone who has control over a city, seeking Leylin out only after so many days since he had entered the city was somewhat surprising.\u201cAre you somewhat bored?\u201d Murphy noticed Leylin\u2019s indifference.\u201cTo be honest, I am not adept at these kinds of social interaction. Given a choice, I\u2019d rather stay inside my experiment lab\u2026\u201d Leylin smiled wryly.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dMurphy let off a benign laugh, \u201cI felt exactly the same way when I was younger! However, you must learn to enjoy life, young man! Compared to tasteless experiments, delicacies and fervent, unrestrained women can sometimes lead you towards excitement!\u201dLeylin nodded his head. This was actually the difference between retired magicians and newly advanced ones.Murphy has no way of advancing in the path of a Magus anymore, so he could only divert his enthusiasm towards other areas. As for Leylin, he still had a lot of options, so he naturally would make use of the time to cultivate\u2013not waste it on such mundane matters.\u201cBrighten up kid!\u201d There are several comrades I will introduce you to\u2026.\u201d Murphy smiled lightly.\u201cCould they be\u2026?\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed.\u201cIndeed! They are acolytes like us, and they are all younger than me. You would have some common interests to talk about.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to look forward to this banquet now!\u201d Leylin\u2019s lips curled up and smiled.The City Lord\u2019s castle was in the heart of Extreme Night City. Standing guard around it were two rows of fully equipped black-armoured arms men.\u201cThose are the Black Iron Guards of Extreme Night City\u2019s Lord, Viscount Jackson. They once defeated a 500-man army troop with roughly hundred men.After alighting the horse carriage, Murphy introduced Leylin.Leylin looked around. There were several other horse carriages in the vicinity. From time to time, gentlemen in lavish attire and ladies in low-cut ball gowns got down.Murphy appeared to have quite a reputation amongst this circle of nobles based on the exuberant greetings Murphy happily responded to. They even chatted for a while before moving on.Upon seeing Murphy, the guard at the door ran in immediately. Not long after, an extremely loud voice boomed from within.\u201cMurphy, my friend! You have finally arrived!\u201d Accompanying the voice, a burly middle-aged man walked out of the castle. The nobles and troops around respectfully greeted him. This apparently was Viscount Jackson of Extreme Night City.Leylin\u2019s height in the South Coast area was considered average, but this Viscount Jackson was actually taller than him by two heads. He had the classic western features and an extremely wide forehead. He even had extremely long sideburns.Jackson gave Murphy a firm hug, \u201cLittle Jackson has always been asking about you!\u201d\u201cI too miss that cute fellow. He is one of the smartest amongst all my students!\u201d Murphy said.\u201cThis is a good friend of mine from far away, Sire Leylin Farlier!\u201d Murphy introduced Leylin to Viscount Jackson.\u201cExtreme Night City welcomes you!\u201d Jackson sized up Leylin, and opened his broad shoulders, giving Leylin a hug.Leylin\u2019s smile was somewhat stiff, which he quickly concealed.Right at that moment, he was completely distracted by the stats shown by the A.I. Chip.[Jackson. Strength: 7.9, Agility: 4.5, Vitality: 6.3, Spiritual Force: 3.5. State: Healthy. This human is deemed as dangerous, it is strongly suggested that the Host maintain a distance of 50 metres from this person.]\u201cThese stats can only belong to a Grand Knight!\u201d Leylin\u2019s pupils shrank.\u201cThe Vitality of Grand Knights is extremely high. And, after constant activation and stimulation of their internal life energy, they have surpassed the bottleneck that held back most humans. Moreover, they have also developed a slight resistance to Rank 0 spells.\u201d Leylin recalled a description he had read before.\u201cVery well! You should be a Knight too, right?\u201d Lord Jackson was slightly astonished by Leylin\u2019s strength, and he looked upon Leylin now in a friendlier light.\u201cI only recently advanced, and am nowhere close to you!\u201dLeylin said humbly and ordered the A.I. Chip, \u201cA.I. Chip! Show me a simulation if I were to fight against this City Lord Jackson.\u201d[Beep! Establishing parameters, inputting data, simulating battle scenario, predicting outcome\u2026.]A large light screen flashed continuously, and the results: [Battle simulation complete. 50 metres and beyond, Host win rate is 89.8%. Between 20 to 50 metres, Host win rate is 58.7%. Below 20 metres, Host win rate is 33.9%!]\u201cAs expected, the physical power of Grand Knights is extremely astounding. They are capable of closing the distance before a magician can cast a spell. If magicians do not try to stay out of range, they would be on the short end of the stick!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression did not change as he walked together with Murphy into the castle\u2019s hall.It was obvious that the large hall had been decorated for the occasion. The marbled floor was so smooth that it reflected the figures of people walking around on it.A huge golden chandelier hung from the centre of the large hall. It was densely packed with lighted candles that shone through the surrounding coloured crystals letting out a colourful light.At the side of this huge hall, was an orchestra of musicians wearing swallowtail coats and performing a slow enjoyable tune.The area filled with long tables covered in white cloth. On these tables were gold and silver platters with various fruits and barbecued meat. On the side, there were even flasks and silver flagons, which emitted the strong aroma of wine.Right in the centre was a huge open space where many of the nobility were waltzing to the music.\u201cIt seems like a ball with a buffet on the side!\u201d Leylin nodded his head.\u201cGo enjoy yourself! I\u2019ll have to say hello to a few old friends!\u201d Murphy said to Leylin.\u201cPlease do!\u201d Leylin gestured with his head in assent. He then picked up a cup of grape wine and sat on a nearby sofa.Not long after, he spotted Murphy together with a number of coquettish women in revealing outfits. They even entered a small side room, which made him rather speechless.\u201cHe\u2019s so old and he still wants to pretend to be rather strong, can he even make it?\u201d\u201cDo you mind if I sit beside you?\u201d Just as Leylin was thinking such indecent thoughts, an elegant voice sounded beside him.Leylin raised his head and saw a young lady wearing a purple gown. She a head of golden hair that fell to her shoulders like a waterfall; even her skin was a milky white.Looking around, Leylin discovered that there was no one else near him. Leylin was quite good looking and kept himself well groomed, which naturally attracted a few young ladies.\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind!\u201d Leylin smiled lightly and chatted happily with the young lady.To him, the combination of his memories from a previous life and the memories of this body\u2019s previous owner made making a little girl happy an easy task.Not long after, the young lady was completely enraptured by Leylin\u2019s made-up stories.\u201cHaha\u2026Haha, running naked on the street? He actually did that?\u201d The young lady completely lost her earlier elegance; she laughed almost uproariously without much of her former delicate demeanor. This drew a lot of curious stares from the people close by.\u201cSorry to interrupt you Leylin! However, our friends are here!\u201dMurphy, followed closely by several noble women with whom he had just tangled violently, walked over. Surprisingly, his attire was still extremely neat and tidy, which left Leylin rather shocked.\u201cAlright, I have to go!\u201d Leylin made a helpless gesture and rose from the sofa.\u201cThis\u2026Sir! After talking for so long, I haven\u2019t asked for your name yet?\u201d The young lady slapped her forehead.\u201cLeylin Farlier, just call me Leylin!\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m Alicia, my house is located at Cecelia Main Street, 34. You\u2019re welcomed to come over to play anytime!\u201d\u201cHaha, I never thought that you might be so sought after by ladies huh!\u201d After the both of them left, Murphy made fun of Leylin.\u201cIt\u2019s only a young lady who likes to listen to stories. Have they arrived?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cThey\u2019re all here, followed me!\u201dMurphy said, and brought Leylin to a small room beside the dance hall.There were several acolytes already waiting in the room. Leylin could sense that their energy waves made them either Level 1 or Level 2 Acolytes.Murphy obviously had the highest standing in this circle. When he entered, the acolytes all stood up to receive him.\u201cAlright!\u201d Murphy swept his gaze around, \u201cLet me introduce all of you to a new comrade! Leylin, he came from the west\u2026.\u201dAfter Leylin\u2019s self-introduction was over, he could not help but ask Murphy, \u201cWould a gathering like this cause an issue?\u201d\u201cNo worries, Jackson has reared some Beastmen and their noses are more sensitive than a dog\u2019s. He already knew of our identities long ago. It\u2019s just that all of us do not mention it explicitly!\u201dAn acolyte with acne spoke, picking up a silver flagon and drinking from it from time to time.\u201cOh! Mayflower, my Mayflower!\u201d At this moment, a guy\u2019s heavy panting sounded.\u201cOh! Baby! So hot, so good!\u201d A woman\u2019s murmuring groans followed soon after.It seems like there was a couple in ardent passion in the room next door.Black lines formed on Murphy\u2019s face. He promptly swung his hand and a faint energy membrane enveloped the room isolating the noise of the outside world. \u201cThis is an accident, an accident!\u201d His old face actually reflected his embarrassment.Leylin wanted to faint, and there was a voice that repeatedly echoed in his mind. \u201cAlright! I really shouldn\u2019t harbour any hope toward this group of acolytes. They are all just a bunch of trash that has completely lost their motivation and prudence!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRecordingOf course, on the surface, Leylin continued to pretend that he was naive as he began to converse in a friendly and amicable manner with this group of acolytes.After the ball ended, the various horse carriages from different families set off. In a secret chamber within the City Lord\u2019s castle, the Viscount Jackson that Leylin saw today was talking to his subordinate.\u201cIs it confirmed?\u201d\u201cI have detected the smell of a Mysterious Entity on his body. It has also been confirmed that he is extremely young!\u201d The person who replied was draped in black robes; tufts of yellow fur could be glimpsed growing on his face.\u201cHe is different from those befuddled acolytes. I do not think he will be retiring at such a young age. No matter if he is hiding from enemies or is concealing some other motive, his appearance is not good news for us!\u201d A worried expression flickered through Jackson\u2019s steely face.\u201cPlease pardon my forthrightness! Although we are able to deal with a Mysterious Entity right now, if we draw the ire of the rest of them, then whatever gains we achieve would not make up for the losses we may incur!\u201dThe Half-Beast Man said slowly.\u201cIndeed!\u201d Jackson became quiet for some time before giving out an order, \u201cDo not incur the wrath of the other party, but never let him out of your sight!\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201d The Half-Beast Man disappeared into the darkness\u2026.Ever since the ball, Leylin\u2019s agenda progressed extremely quickly. First, he borrowed 4500 gold coins from Murphy to buy the villa.Afterwards, through the search done by Old Welker, Leylin chose a medicine shop that was about to close down but had a good geographic position. He took over it and obtained the shop permit.With the unexpected enthusiastic help from the City Lord\u2019s castle, many procedures were actually settled in a matter of days.Of course, Leylin discovered a few spies loitering around the medicine shop and the villa. However, these secretive parties exercised restraint against Leylin, and only made basic surveillance measures, not insinuating their influence onto Leylin\u2019s people. So, Leylin was not too bothered by their presence either.Through Murphy, he hired a few pharmacists. Once the minimum standards for managing the medicine shop were met, he then completely handed over the reins to his core personnel and buried himself in his magic experiments.After some renovation, the Knight\u2019s villa looked even newer than when it was brand new.Previously, the Knight stayed in a three storey high, white-brick loft. Now, Leylin chose the few really big rooms for his private use.The largest of these was used as his bedroom while the rooms on both sides served as a study room and an experiment lab. After putting in place a few detection spells he had learned at Abyssal Bone Forest Academy as an early warning grid, he passed down strict orders to his subordinates that without his order, no one was access to these rooms.As for Greem and Fraser, they were posted near the master bedroom, as guards.Fayern and other mercenaries were all given guard duty that rotated between the villa and the medicine shop. Leylin also gave out notices that serious and hardworking people may purchase small tracts of land on his property in 3 years later, permanent residence being a possibility for qualified persons or families. This was a very strong motivation for normal mercenaries and farmers.Occasionally, Leylin looked through the windows and saw the serious hardworking serious mercenaries and farmers at work.Because he always stayed at the villa, apart from the occasional visit to Murphy\u2019s place, he rarely even went to the medicine shop. The rumors that were slowly spreading outside gained Leylin the reputation of a benevolent yet lazy villa owner.\u201cYoung Master! The people from the medicine shop are here!\u201d Anna\u2019s voice travelled through the door.\u201cLet them drop off the items in the living room and get Greem to move them to the experiment lab!\u201d Leylin used his fingers to tap on the window pane, letting off a dull thudding noise.\u201cYour wish is my command!\u201d The voice very soon was replaced with noises of things being moved about.A dozen minutes later, Leylin came to the experiment lab.Right now, the originally spacious experiment was littered with crates and a few wooden long tables. There were no windows in the room, and only a chandelier hung from the ceiling emitting a dim glow.\u201cYoung Master! According to your orders, the medicine shop has acquired for you every type of herb that can be found in the market.\u201dAnna lifted her dress and curtseyed. She turned around and opened a red wooden crate revealing stacks of tied roots and stems, as well as many other herbs of indeterminate quantity and type. On the side of each stack or bundle was stuck a yellow paper note indicating the names of these herbs.\u201cAlso, these are all the formulas that normal pharmacists own. They are only to normal humans.Anna handed over yet another stack of dark yellow parchment notes.Leylin\u2019s eyes skimmed over these and placed the list on one of the long tables.\u201cAll of you may leave! Anna, stay behind!\u201d Leylin waved towards Greem and his assistants.Greem bowed and strode through the large heavy door, closing it behind him.With a huge clang, the experiment lab\u2019s lighting turned even dimmer.Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed. He took out a white coloured rock from his sack.He then pressed his fingers lightly on the rock and a layer of bright white light radiated from it.This was a Sunlight Rock. It is an item that magicians normally use during their travels. Slight radiation energy is contained in it that can let out a bright light for a prolonged period of time.However, this radiation was extremely small and could only be used for illumination.\u201cThis is much brighter than before!\u201d Leylin was very satisfied as he looked at his well-lit surroundings. He then said to Anna, \u201cStore the herbs well, and arrange them in an orderly fashion on the experiment table!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Anna hurried with her task.Leylin casually picked up a purple coloured fruit. This fruit was the size of a thumb It had lost all the water contained on its surface, thus its wrinkly exterior. Its weight was extremely light too.\u201cAccording to the medicine books delivered yesterday, this is the Warter Fruit, a type of fruit that grows in swamps.\u201dLeylin placed a finger on the surface of the fruit, \u201cA.I. Chip! Extract data and save it in your databanks!\u201dRight now he no longer had to ingest the herbs. He could determine their medicinal properties with a mere touch.[Beep! Data extraction in progress!]In Leylin\u2019s field of vision, the A.I. Chip overlaid a light blue screen, with many numbers and figures that changed constantly.[Name: Warter Fruit. The area produced: Swamps. Uses: Mild poisonous properties with a numbing effect. Data stored!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned before a second had gone by.\u201cVery good. Again!\u201d Leylin picked up another dried stem.This was one of the reasons why Leylin had opened a medicine shop. Through his years of being an apprentice under Kroft, he recorded almost all the herbs used by Potioneering Masters, storing it into the A.I. Chip\u2019s data banks.However, those were special ingredients used by the Magi. As for herbs used by normal people, the A.I. Chip had no record of them. He now had to fill these missing bits of information.Moreover, Leylin obtained two ancient potion formulas from his mentor and wanted to find substitutes for them. This could only be accomplished through innumerable experimentation and the consumption of huge amounts of precious and rare herbs. Even if Leylin had the A.I. Chip, he could not get around this step in the process.With such a vast undertaking, Leylin could see no end to the task at hand even if he expended all his Magic Crystals.However, if some ingredients could be substituted with herbs used by normal humans, he could economise by a huge margin.\u201cAlthough this might just be a daydream, the advantage was the potential savings a successful substitution promised. No matter how many experiments, it would still be considered a favorable exchange. Thus, by utilising the terrifying processing capabilities of the A.I. Chip, there is a glimmer of hope.Leylin\u2019s gaze was resolute, \u201cAnyway, no matter how many ingredients I consume, they are just ingredients used by normal humans. I only need to spend some gold coins to be able to buy them again. This is much better than spending Magic Crystals!\u201dAs for the investigation he commissioned, it had long since been tossed to the back of Leylin\u2019s mind.After all, there were still two odd years of time and as long as he fully carried it out within these two years his mission would be counted as accomplished.Even if the mission were to fail, because Kroft was his teacher, the worst punishment would be a fine a few Magic Crystals. Hence, Leylin was not the least bit worried.Time slowly passed, and the experiment lab became quiet. There were only the occasional scraping noises Anna made when placing herbs on the table.Two days later, only Leylin remained in the lab. His face had a happy glow to it.[3217 types of herbs successfully stored in the databank. Would you like to create a separate folder?]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cNo! Combine them with the earlier record we made of some normal ingredients, establish a folder using the name \u201cCompendium of ordinary ingredients\u201d! Leylin ordered.[Folder created\u2026transferring relevant simulation models into the databank]\u201cAlright, next will be an analysis of the various combinations of medicinal properties. This is a huge project, even with the simulation I must still carry out experiments to verify the actual data and increase the probability of getting the results I desire.\u201dLeylin thought.\u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d Anna\u2019s muted voice sounded through the door.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming out.\u201d When it was time to work, he worked; and when it was time to rest, he rested. This was his principle for living. He would seldom do things like neglect food and rest to conduct more experiments, unlike other magicians.To him, along the path of pursuing truth, appropriate rest was allowed.Leylin smiled and tidied up the experiment table before leaving the lab.\u201cWhen I am conducting important experiments, I will hang a sign on the door. At that time, do not interrupt me no matter how many days I stay inside. Do you understand?\u201d Leylin told Anna who was serving him.\u201cI\u2019ll do as you bid, Young Master.\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Leylin walked towards one side of the room. Although many masters practiced eating some meals together with their subordinates, this did not fit the customs of the Magi. So Leylin ate alone most of the time.Several plates of food covered with hemispherical cloche tableware were arranged on a serving platter and placed on a small, round and white-colored table.\u201cIt\u2019s veal with purple vegetable soup and apple strawberry pie!\u201d Anna said lightly, lifted the cover. A strong appetising aroma permeated the air.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Leylin nodded his head as he let Anna place a napkin around his neck. He picked up the knife and dinner fork and began to eat.\u201cAlso, remember to remind me tomorrow to set aside an hour of my time every day for Knight training!\u201dLeylin said to Anna, having suddenly recalled something. He had already ignited his internal life energy. As a Knight, he only needed to train some more to get his various stats above 3. Although Leylin planned to walk the path of a Magus, he had nothing to lose by increasing his stats.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although not very prominent, they were very robust, exuding a sense of vitality.Forward! Uppercut! Pierce! Every move was \u00a0a flawless, textbook-perfect execution.After Leylin finished his training, Anna\u2013 who was observing from the side\u2013 hurriedly ran forward and handed him a white towel.Leylin dried his sweat and called his stats onto his visual field.[Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte, Knight. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 3.3, Vitality: 3.2, Spiritual Force: 4.7, Magical Power: 4.0. Status: Healthy]\u201cA.I. Chip, what is the progress from today\u2019s training?\u201d[Assessment in progress! Host\u2019s internal life energy has been raised to the maximum, further increase is not possible at the moment!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cThis day has finally arrived!\u201d Leylin exclaimed, \u201cBeing able to maximize these stats was already good enough. Even if I were to spend more time, I will not necessarily gain anything more. From now on his Knight training could be put on hold. After all, I just need to practice my blade skills in the future, so they don\u2019t get rusty. With the A.I. Chip, this is no challenge at all.\u201dAfter the early morning Knight training ended, Leylin took a brief respite and waited until he was fully recovered before burying his head in more experiments.Within the lab, Leylin placed a violet leaf into a beaker and added to it one spatula of a green-black, ink-like solution. He then lit a flame underneath the beaker.The bright yellow fire continuously licked the bottom of the beaker, and purple bubbles began to froth.\u201cA.I. Chip! Record this down. Test 145, items of substitution: Hove Violet Leaves, Ninuo Root.\u201d[Record complete.] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned as it recorded in detail the various medicinal properties and reactions obtained through the experiment.In this span of time, Leylin had already conducted more than a hundred experiments and made use of the A.I. Chip\u2019s simulation feature over tens of thousands of times.\u201cThis is the moment! I have a very strong premonition that it\u2019ll be successful this time.\u201dAs he murmured to himself, Leylin glanced at the volatile, green- and purple-coloured mixture.Using normal human herbs as ingredients to synthesize the medicinal properties of magic herbs just seemed to be a fantasy, besides there were countless hurdles to overcome.Although these experiments required ingredients that could be bought with gold coins, some magic ingredients were still needed to catalyse certain aspects of the experiment.These were all magic ingredients that Leylin had acquired from the Magus Market. He had now almost used up all of them all.Without the A.I. Chip simulating a large proportion of his experiments, Leylin\u2019s rate of consumption would far outstrip his current rate.Synthesizing a few important ingredients could already dry up Leylin\u2019s resources.* Crash! *The violet leaf in the beaker completely dissolved and the green coloured liquid became more translucent.\u201cThis is it!\u201d Leylin eyes widened. He picked up a glass rod and stirred in a counterclockwise direction at the same time extending a thread of Spiritual Force carefully into the contents of the beaker through the glass rod.As the seconds became minutes, Leylin\u2019s face grew more and more solemn. A few beads of sweat even began to form on his forehead.* Ding Ling Ling! * A crisp ringing sounded from the beaker. At the heart of the faint green liquid, many black wormlike dots appeared and began continuously extending themselves in all directions.Leylin\u2019s expression did not change and his hands were as quick as a phantom, as he took a red-coloured pearl\u2013 lying on a petri dish nearby\u2013 and added it to the ongoing reaction.* Pi Pa! * As the pearl was tossed inside, the black dots in the beaker quickly retreated and the faint green liquid became fainter and fainter, completely turning transparent.[Beep! Azure Potion main ingredient substitution succeeded! Assessed as capable of standing in for 45.8% of the main ingredient\u2019s medicinal properties.]This prompt was extremely pleasing to Leylin\u2019s ears.\u201cAfter combining several conjectures into tens of thousands of the A.I. Chip\u2019s simulations, I have finally succeeded!\u201d A corner of Leylin\u2019s lips quirked up into a smile and he clenched his fist tightly.At the same time, Leylin deeply lamented about the fact even though he was a Potioneering Master, it was difficult to modify formulas.He had the original formula, and the A.I. Chip to run simulations for him. This saved a lot of time and ingredients. Even so, he took this long to successfully modify the formula. Instead, if it was his Senior Merlin, he might not even be able to afford the cost of the ingredients, and that also true for the powerful family that supported him behind the scenes.Squandering precious ingredients for a gamble with a chance of less than one in ten thousand was simply illogical to the typical Magus.Moreover, during the process of experimentation, each failure would be an agonizing psychological burn that would singe the psyche of a Potioneering Master, day and night. If one could actually change the formula, then that would be out of pure luck, even for Potioneering Grandmasters who had abundant experiences and skill.However, once the formula was changed, it would lead to huge profits, especially for a potion that could raise Spiritual Force.\u201cA.I. Chip! If I were to substitute the original ingredients, how much will the retained effect be?\u201d[Comparison in progress. Databank information is insufficient. Establishing conjecture. Simulating\u2026Beep! The new formula will retain roughly 35.4% of the original\u2019s effectiveness.]\u201cThis is on the low side, but I have no choice. The substituted ingredients are mainly normal ones even commoners can obtain. Quantity can compensate whatever is lacking in quality.\u201dLeylin analysed the pros and cons of the new Azure Potion, \u201cBased on this, the price could be in excess of 100,000 Magic Crystals. A pity, this formula was achieved with my current stats. For other people, the effect would be extremely hard to predict. Moreover, the procedures are extremely complicated and some steps are impossible to do without the A.I. Chip. Other Potioneering Masters, will definitely fail many times when brewing this potion.\u201dIn fact, it was clear to Leylin that even if he became an official Magus, once others became aware of this formula, he would not be able to hold onto it. After all, the ingredients for this new Spiritual Force formula could be bought in mass amounts. It would be game-changing for the lower levels of the various academies and factions. None of them would willingly let go of such an opportunity.After making up his mind, he burned the formula completely into his memory. The potions he would brew would only be for personal consumption. Leylin then tidied up all traces of his experiments, before stepping through the door of the experiment lab.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d Anna, who was dozing on a chair nearby, got up in a hurry.\u201cHousekeeper Welker has been looking for you for two hours. There appears to be some crisis at the medicine shop!\u201d\u201cOh? Let him come to my study after dinner!\u201d Leylin took off the soiled, sterile robe designed especially for his experiments and changed into more casual soft clothing.\u201cApart from Welker, are there any other recent incidents?\u201dLeylin lounged on a nearby sofa. On the table beside it were purple grape-like fruits and some red berries, which Leylin usually liked to eat.\u201cKnight Fraser came over earlier and said that the reward mission you commissioned has some developments!\u201dAlthough Leylin did not give a high priority to the academy\u2019s mission, some superficial work still had to be done. He, thus, issued a mission notice to the mercenaries and adventurers of Extreme Night City to scout the situation within the depths of the Dark Night Woods, the reward being 1000 gold pieces. It seems that the mission notice was beginning to bear fruit.After dinner, Leylin received Old Welker and Fraser in his study.Fraser wore leather armour and was as robust as ever. As for Old Welker, he looked careworn and his body had hunched over.Old Welker bowed towards Leylin, \u201cRespected Young Master, our earnings from the medicine shop this month is\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo need for that!\u201d Leylin leaned against the study table behind him and waved his hands interrupting Old Welker\u2019s speech, \u201cPass down instructions to buy all Hove Violet Leaves, Ninuo Roots and Three Flowered Snake Fruits\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen Young Master, how many of them are we buying?\u201d\u201cAll!\u201d\u201cAll?\u201d Old Welker raised his head and looked at Leylin in astonishment.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The three ingredients that I\u2019ve stated, you must buy all of them in the market, and store them at the villa.\u201d Leylin remained indifferent as he said this.\u201cBut\u2026may I remind the Young Master, the medicine shop business is not doing well, together with the herbs that Young Master\u00a0purchased from time to time, our balance books right now are already in a precarious state\u2026.\u201d If not for the villa forking out gold coins all the time, the shop would have been bankrupt by now\u2013 this was something, though, that Old Welker did not dare to voice out so he kept it to himself.\u201cI know that, but you must remember this. If the gold coins are not sufficient, you may take more from Anna. These purchases must not be discontinued. These are my standing orders.\u201d Leylin steepled his fingers. Although he was approximately 15 years old, he could apparently impose his will.\u201cAl\u2026.Alright! I got it.\u201d A layer of cold sweat beaded Old Welker\u2019s forehead. He immediately bowed then left.He was not the same as Anna and the three men who were aware of Leylin\u2019s identity. It was only natural that he was a little apprehensive about the way Leylin handled financial matters.However, for Leylin, the only reason he set up a household was to serve his own purposes and to help him with miscellaneous tasks such as the collection of ingredients. So the loss of some gold coins was no big deal.Anything and everything was to pave the way for his progress to become a Magus. Everything else was a nuisance.\u201cAlthough I have walked on the path of a Magus, it is just to obtain freedom and a worry-free life. It is a pity, though, that my current strength is far from enough.\u201dLeylin sighed deeply. He appeared to have become a person of consequence within Extreme Night City, largely owing to his having a villa and servants. However, for Magi, such things were illusory soap bubbles that could completely vanish with a gentle tap.The collateral damage of a battle between any two official Magi would definitely be a deadly situation for the current Leylin.What was the point of fleeting comfort when life or death was not entirely guaranteed?\u201cMore importantly, if the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was totally defeated, then Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut would perhaps classify all of the faculty and students of the academy as fugitives. I would have to abandon everything and flee.\u201d\u201cIn this chaotic era, only one\u2019s own strength can ensure freedom.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the price of 1 dead and 2 seriously injured, I finally uncovered some clues.\u201dRecent events at the withering woods had led to a direct decrease in herb harvesting. As of this moment, several huge factions had also sent scouts with the same intent. But even after having sent many scouts, they were all ambushed.According to a few eyewitnesses, they had suffered from some ridiculous attacks from a black entity within the woods. So far, it was only known that that entity was an extremely swift monster. Apart from that description, nothing else was known.\u201cGo on.\u201d Leylin\u2019s voice was extremely calm.\u201cOne bandit was finally able to see clearly what that monster looked like, during one of its ambushes. This is the sketch he drew.\u201dThe Knight handed over a sketch to Leylin.Leylin took a look. On the sketch paper was a kind of four-legged, snake-like creature. Its body was littered with scales, it had a forked tongue, and on its crown was a small horn.\u201cWhat else did the bandit say?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cHe said that this creature was about two metres in length. Its whole body was a yellowish-brown and it was extremely fast.\u201d Fraser added.\u201cIt had such an appearance?\u201d Leylin said as hurriedly recalled an illustrated handbook of unusual creatures he had seen back at the academy, \u201cIt\u2019s rather similar to the Blue Lizard, but the colour is not right. It also appears to be similar to a snake-type!\u201d\u201cHowever, the fact that a few scouts were able to escape shows that this creature is not very dangerous. A Level 2 Acolyte should be able to deal with it.\u201d Leylin calmed down.At the moment, though, he still did not have any intention of settling this personally. Apart from the potion experiments entering a crucial stage, the withering woods event had not been investigated fully. Unless it was absolutely necessary, Leylin would not risk his life for unknown dangers.\u201cPass these orders down. No matter who, as long as they can capture or slay this creature, I will reward them with 2000 gold pieces! Also, any materials from the creature, be it scales, blood, skin or horn, I will give an additional 200 gold pieces for them.\u201dLeylin said blandly.\u201cYes, Milord, allow me to issue these mission orders.\u201d Fraser bowed.\u201cGo.\u201d Leylin waved his hands. Fraser bowed again before striding off.\u2026\u2026Three days later, east of Extreme Night City, in a small canyon.Leylin wore black robes and walked on the mountainous path along the canyon. Against a person like him with all of the stats above 3, these obstructions were not an issue at all. He trotted on as if taking a leisurely walk in his backyard.Behind him followed an armoured Greem, who also wore a mask with his helmet to conceal his appearance.\u201cWe\u2019re here! Brey Canyon Market!\u201d Leylin said softly as he felt the energy waves fluctuating in the vicinity.This market was on the map that Bicky had given to Leylin. It was situated close to Extreme Night City and served as a resource exchange point. Previously when Leylin chose the mission, part of his intent was to visit this market.\u201cHalt!\u201d A girl\u2019s voice rang. Leylin turned towards the direction of the voice. He discovered a little girl, riding a mountain goat, moving towards them.The mountain goat\u2019s four hooves skipped and hopped along the cliff. It actually moved very quickly, reaching Leylin\u2019s side in a few moments.\u201cYou are a magician?\u201d The little girl sized up Leylin and asked indifferently.\u201cYes, I am a wandering magician. I wish to enter the market. This is my servant!\u201d Leylin pointed to Greem behind him.\u201cThis servant\u2019s strength has already reached that of a Knight\u2019s? You\u2019re strong!\u201d The little girl gave a thumbs up, \u201cThe fee is 1 Magic Crystal each for you and your servant. If you think that\u2019s expensive then he can wait outside.\u201d\u201cNo need for that!\u201d Leylin took out 2 Magic Crystals and handed it over to the girl.\u201cI wish to know where in this canyon I can obtain the latest information!\u201d Leylin asked casually.\u201cYou\u2019re new here, aren\u2019t you? In here, I have the most updated news!\u201d The little girl smugly tilted her head up and her face had an expression that said, \u201cYou may beg me for it.\u201dLeylin was rather speechless. From the A.I. Chip\u2019s scan, this little girl was a Level 3 Acolyte. Her strength was actually higher than Murphy\u2019s. She was definitely no longer a youth, appearances aside. It was hard to figure out why she maintained the countenance of a child.\u201cCould this respected guardian tell me what the price would be in order to obtain some news?\u201d Leylin bowed slightly.\u201cYou are rather pleasing to my eyes, so 1 news item in return for 1 Magic Crystal!\u201d The little girl put on an expression that looked as if she thought highly of Leylin.\u201cAlright then!\u201d Leylin smiled wryly and handed over a Magic Crystal.\u201cWhat is the progress of the war at Abyssal Bone Forest Academy?\u201d\u201cRecently, magicians who bought news from me have also enquired about this.\u201d The little girl scratched her head, \u201cAccording to the latest updates from yesterday, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy still persists due to their reliance on their magic spell formation. Acolyte fatalities have not been low, however.Upon saying this, the little girl murmured, \u201cCalm down! Calm down! The war\u2019s conflagration will not extend to here. There aren\u2019t even that many reliable resource points in this place, so how can it attract the attention of the academies. Only acolytes might come here occasionally.\u201d\u201cI know that. Then do you know the reason for this war?\u201d Leylin handed yet another Magic Crystal.The little girl hurriedly took it, \u201cWho knows? It seemed to be for a sceptre or some jewel\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s like this!\u201d Leylin nodded his head, indicating he had nothing more to ask.\u201cYoung man, I hope you find what you need in this canyon, without any problems!\u201d The little girl waved her hands and patted the goat she rode. It resumed its hopping, and very soon they disappeared from his sight and into the canyon.\u201cLet us also go in!\u201d Leylin said to Greem behind him.Coming to the canyon this time, Leylin was on an extremely tight schedule. A number of his experiments have reached a crucial stage. The modified Azure Potion formula was also nearing completion.It was a pity that some of the magic ingredients he stockpiled before had been depleted. He, thus, had no choice but to venture from his home.\u201cSoon! I only need to complete the supplementary ingredients, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and then begin to try brewing the Azure Potion. By then my Spiritual Force, which has been slowly increasing, will receive a huge boost!\u201d Leylin eyes seemed to glow with fire.Following the narrow route along the precipice, Leylin carefully entered the depths of the ravine. In this resource exchange point, the stores were all set up within the holes that dotted the cliff, a little like the caves of primitive men.Leylin walked into a potions shop called \u201cLangford\u2019s Potions\u201d. The cave was extremely dark, only a few rocks radiating green light illuminated it.These rocks seemingly made every item inside the cave emanate a green glow making the scene look extremely gloomy.\u201cHehehe! What do you want?\u201d A dark and sorrowful laughter could be heard.From behind the counter, an old dwarf walked out. His face was full of wrinkles, was bald and most of his teeth had fallen off too.\u201cI require 20 standard servings each of Tendril Leaves, Water Crystal Fruits and Dragon-Eyed Grapeseed!\u201dLeylin enunciated slowly.\u201cOh!\u201d The old dwarf stood rooted to the floor not moving, \u201cThese are all potion ingredients and their prices will not be ordinary! Are you a Potioneering Master?\u201d\u201cThat does not seem to concern you in any way.\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed, this old geezer\u2019s attitude made him rather displeased.\u201cYoung man! Could it be that no one taught you to respect the elderly?\u201d The dwarf geezer smiled and the pupils of his eyes seemed to swirl continuously.[Warning! Warning! The target\u2019s body is radiating magical energy waves!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s alert sounded.Greem who was behind Leylin fell without making a sound.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Leylin cursed. A few acolytes and even official Magi, because of getting injured while advancing or due to being contaminated by radiation from experimenting, caused them to become mentally unstable. They often exhibited craziness. Obviously, Leylin met one such today.According to the A.I. Chip\u2019s scan, the dwarf opposite him was a Level 2 Acolyte, but his Spiritual Force was much higher than Leylin\u2019s.The magical power in Leylin\u2019s body circulated, allowing him to escape from the old geezer\u2019s spell, \u201cAn Illusionary spell? Doesn\u2019t seem like it! It should be some passive spell if it\u2019s like this!\u201dLeylin\u2019s robes shook, and a fire red potion was now in his hands. His whole body let off a very dangerous feeling.\u201cHahaha\u2026Just like this! Just like this! Death is beautiful, and is descending upon us soon!\u201d The dwarf geezer laughed manically and danced in joy.\u201cThis person has gone completely crazy!\u201d Leylin got ready to throw the explosive potion in his hands, and to find an escape route.He did not want to engage in a broil with a madman without cause nor reason. Besides, winning will not net him any gains.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Langford!\u201d Just when the dwarf geezer was preparing another spell, a voice travelled over. It was the guardian, the voice of the little girl who rode the mountain goat.\u201cMarissa! I\u2019ve had enough of you!\u201d The dwarf geezer howled loudly, and he made an incantation. Black coloured smoke congealed in his hands forming a massive black ball.The surrounding shelves that held various ingredients were on the verge of collapse under the energy waves emitted by the black ball.\u201cDamn it! Langford\u2019s time is here again. Which one of you can help me?\u201d The little girl\u2019s voice travelled over again, this time sounding rather exasperated.\u201cFoos!\u201d \u201cOcker!\u201dTwo extremely short incantations travelled over and gave Leylin a shock, \u201cThey\u2019re all Level 3 Acolytes! I heard that not only can the Spiritual Force of Level 3 Acolytes support a few Rank 0 spells, they have also grasped the technique of phrase casting, which shortens incantations to a few syllables achieving near instantaneous casting.\u201dAfter the few syllables were cast, many green vines appeared within the cave. Some of the huge vines held Langford\u2019s hands and feet together.Langford roared continuously. He prepared to toss the black-coloured smoke ball out.At that moment, a red coloured arrow ripped through the air and flew directly at the heart of the ball.* Poof! * The surroundings let off a light ring as the black smoke and the red arrow continued to counteract each other before finally disappearing into nothingness.\u201cA positive energy arrow.\u201d Leylin\u2019s pupils contracted, \u201cThe Level 3 Acolyte who struck from the outside, no matter their battle ability or spell comprehension, they have far surpassed me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Put me down quickly!\u201dAt this moment, Langford, who was trapped, transformed rapidly.The maniacal look on his face vanished, and his eyes showed sanity. The originally bald head had grown a large amount of green hair that quickly extended to his ankles.\u201cLook his hair is already growing, it seems like he has regained his sanity!\u201d The little girl\u2019s voice rang out and the green vines were retracted.\u201cLangford! You actually did not master anticipating when your episodes of insanity would trigger. You even broke the rules of the canyon by startling our customer! You better obtain our guest\u2019s forgiveness. Otherwise, you will be chased out of this place!\u201dTwo voices gradually left, and Leylin did not see the other two Level 3 Acolytes, even after the battle had ended. Moreover, even the interior of the cave remained unharmed.Upon noticing that something was amiss, the dwarf hurriedly bowed before Leylin, \u201cMy apologies, Sir! Due to some mental strain, there are times when I\u2019m unable to control myself. I hope you will allow me to make amends for the inconvenience I caused.\u201dLangford was a little dispirited, \u201cEarlier I really thought I had the timing down. Alas, I never anticipated that it would flare up more often than before, who knows if I really have to move out\u2026.\u201dLeylin too did not know how to react in this situation. He could only say, \u201cThen please wake my servant up. Also, hurry and bring the ingredients I requested!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d The dwarf geezer dragged his long shaggy hair and stood in front of Greem. He lifted Greem\u2019s eyelid to have a look, \u201cYour servant has only fainted temporarily. He will recover after a short rest!\u201dHe then took some brown coloured powder from his robes and made Greem swallow them. Not long after, the burly fellow woke up.Langford then brought out a small box and handed it to Leylin, \u201cTo compensate for your trouble. Furthermore, \u00a0I can give you a 50% discount!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Leylin was a little speechless, but he still handed the Magic Crystals to the geezer and gave the box to Greem for him to carry before he bade farewell.As they said their goodbyes, Langford bowed deeply again, \u201cIf you still wish to trade with me, please remember, only when my hair has grown past my ankle, will I be in a period of sanity. The rest of the time, avoid me for the time being.Leylin nodded his head and left the canyon with Greem.Originally, he was in a mood to browse around. However, after this incident, he had completely lost interest. Who knew if there were other crazy people in this canyon.The path of a Magus is treacherous, each failure in advancement\u2013be it through an experiment or as a side effect of spell radiation\u2013can cause irreversible damage to those involved, even costing them their lives sometimes.Adding prolonged longevity and immense power, over time a Magus\u2019 character would undergo some kind of change; some may even develop mental problems.Leylin thought of Langford and the two Level 3 Acolytes who had rendered their assistance. The feeling they gave Leylin was completely different from that of the acolytes of Extreme Night City.To put things in perspective, it was like a pack of wolves against lambs.\u201cIt seems like real magicians very seldom prefer to stay around humans, and they predominantly stay in rural areas.Seeing the might of those two Level 3 Acolytes today made Leylin somewhat more zealous, \u201cOnce I have successfully brewed the Azure Potion, I too can quickly advance to that level!\u201d\u2026\u2026In the lab, under the brilliant light, Leylin took and stared at a test tube from the table. It continuously bubbled with blue froth.With extremely firm hands, he shook it according to a mysterious rhythm.The blue bubbles in the test tube continued to froth upwards then vanish as it reached the brim.[The reaction in the potion has become extremely stable, and is estimated to exceed the threshold in 3 Minutes 24 Seconds!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s observation alerted.After reporting this condition, a timer at a bottom corner of Leylin\u2019s visual field started the countdown.When the countdown reached 0, Leylin immediately used the ancient Byron language and muttered an incantation, \u201cThis is the azure blue ocean, come! My little babies!\u201dHis other hand immediately dropped some of the blue crystals he was holding, into the test tube.* Weng Weng! * The test tube started to tremble.A few streaks of a brilliant blue light flew out of its mouth and rotated around it turning into little blue coloured mermaids.These little mermaids had a girl\u2019s torso and were only the size of Leylin\u2019s thumb. On their chests hung two shell pieces while the bottom half of their body was that of a fish\u2019s tail. At this moment, they were holding hands together, circling the test tube, singing and dancing.Their sweet distinct elegant voices sang and it reverberated within the room strumming on Leylin\u2019s heartstrings.\u201cThe final step! Resist the alluring voices of the mermaids!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression tightened.Rumours had it that the singing voices of mermaids not only have terrifying bewitching energy, but these voices were also used to prey on sailors in the deep seas. Many suspected these mermaids as main culprits behind the creation of ghost ships!Right now, Leylin felt a strong impulse to throw everything he owned to the side, and dive straight into the ocean.\u201cThis is only an illusion. It only has the 10% of an actual mermaid\u2019s might. If these were real or were cast by mermaid Magi, what would the effects be?\u201d Leylin clenched his teeth and gave off a layer of grey-black light from his body deflecting these voices.\u201cManse!\u201d After waiting for roughly 30 seconds, Leylin suddenly blurted out a word.* Chi Chi! * Black coloured needles appeared piercing through the chests of those little mermaids.Agonised expressions could be seen on the pretty faces of the mermaids. Suddenly, they dissolved and turned into a few drops of blue liquid that returned into the test tube.Huge amounts of bubbles, crystals and the drops of liquid rapidly merged and at that instant turned into a test tube half filled with a dark blue potion.* Crash! Leylin shook the test tube lightly. From within the test tube came the crashing sound like that of great surging waves in an ocean.[The modified Azure Potion has been brewed successfully.] The A.I. Chip indicated.\u201cA.I. Chip, how potent is this potion compared to the original formulation?\u201d Leylin asked.[Beep! Collecting the vapours. Analysing and comparing data\u2026 Estimated to have 33% of the original potion\u2019s effect.]Although the previous estimate was 35.4%, there would be some minute differences during the actual brewing. Furthermore, it was the first time he did this experiment, so achieving this effect made Leylin very content.\u201cA pity that the consumptions of Hove Violet Leaves for this process is too high!\u201d Leylin looked at the remnants of the Hove Violet Leaves lying on the side.Only the essence from the middle of a whole piece of Hove Violet Leaf could be used for the potion. Apart from that, many complicated steps also had to be accomplished resulting in the high consumption rate.He estimated that even after Welker bought all of the ingredients available, it would only allow Leylin to brew the potion another 30 to 40 times.\u201cNow, I wonder what the effects of this ancient potion are?\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed in anticipation. He directly walked to an empty space and sat cross-legged on the floor. He then poured the Azure Potion into his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bitter, and has a rather fish-like odour.\u201d The muscles on Leylin\u2019s face twitched, \u201cThe palate of these ancient Magi was just so-so\u2026.\u201d\u201cAccording to the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculations, the best complement to potions that increase Spiritual Force is meditation!\u201dLeylin thought of this before completely entering into a meditative mode.This time, the meditations effect was very obviously different from before. With a vague concept of time, Leylin felt like he was in the middle of an azure blue ocean and boundless blue sea water squeezed his middle almost suffocating him.When seen from the outside, the muscles on Leylin\u2019s handsome face twitched, and drops of sweat continuously dripped out.Almost two hours later, Leylin abruptly opened both of his eyes.\u201cPhew! The feeling from meditating like this is several times more uncomfortable than before!\u201d Leylin shook his head.The meditation of an acolyte, more often than not, led to exhaustion afterwards. However, right now Leylin felt his whole body aching, especially his brain, which felt like someone took a large metal hammer and kept smashing it. Even now he was somewhat dizzy.\u201cA.I. Chip. Display my stats.\u201d Leylin ordered.Immediately, a blue screen appeared before Leylin and showed a stream of numbers.[The Host\u2019s Spiritual Force has been detected as undergoing a rapid rise!][Host is under the influence of an unknown, Spiritual Force increasing by 0.01][Spiritual Force increasing by 0.01][The meditative state is deepening. Effect optimised. Spiritual Force increasing by 0.03][Spiritual Force has reached the threshold, increasing by 0.05]\u2026\u2026[Meditative state ended, Host\u2019s stats undergoing change. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 3.3, Vitality: 3.2, Spiritual Force: 4.9, Magical Power: 4.0. Status: Healthy]Rows of data were displayed, and Leylin discovered at the end that his Spiritual Force had increased by 0.2.\u201cThis figure!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cIf the original ingredients were used, doesn\u2019t that mean that I can increase Spiritual Force by about 0.7 at a time! It is indeed worthy to be called an ancient potion. Even for official Magi, this is a pretty good outcome!\u201d\u201cA.I. Chip, assuming there are enough potions on hand, how much time will I need to reach 7 Spiritual Force points?\u201d Leylin asked.[Inputting effect of Azure Potion, establishing simulation, factoring tolerance principle, calculation in progress\u2026.]The A.I. Chip began calculating, dozens of seconds later, the A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.[According to the Host\u2019s resistance to medicinal properties, it is estimated that the Host will achieve 7 Spiritual Force points after two months!]The necessary conditions to advance to Level 3 Acolyte was to have mastery over at least 2 spell models, a Spiritual Force of 7 and to use a reactive elixir.Leylin had gotten the spell models and reactive elixirs long ago. What kept him back was this Spiritual Force bottleneck.\u201cA pity, though! The success rate for brewing the Azure Potion is extremely horrifying. Even if it\u2019s me, I will at most succeed one out of ten times!\u201d\u201cHove Violet Leaves. I need huge amounts of Hove Violet Leaves. If it cannot be done, I must organise a trading party to acquire them from other cities.\u201dLeylin clenched his teeth. His eyes revealed obvious desire.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d As he walked out from the lab, Anna, who was waiting outside, greeted him immediately.\u201cPass these orders down. From now on, our establishment will cease all operations and devote all resources towards purchasing Hove Violet Leaves. Moreover, Fraser is to make a trip to nearby cities to acquire them!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression was extremely grim.\u201cYes!\u201d This was the first time Anna had seen this side of Leylin, so she hurriedly retreated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMutated OrganismThe bitter cold of winter passed, and the weather began to get warmer.Standing on the villa, Leylin could already see the minuscule green dots from afar. On nearby fields, there were even farmers laboriously working.\u201cA year has passed unknowingly; I am already 15 years old now!\u201d Leylin\u2019s hands pressed on the windowsill, and his eyes seemed to be disconcerted.All of the Hove Violet Leaves available in Extreme Night City had been bought by him. With continuous brewing, he managed to get 5 Azure Potions, bringing his Spiritual Force to 5.8.Unfortunately, any potion, when used excessively, would produce a resistance towards it, and the effects would be reduced over time. Originally, he had estimated that his Spiritual Force would reach a value of 5.9 with the resources available. However, in reality, it fell short by 0.1 without any apparent cause.\u201cRight now, I can only place my hopes on Fraser and the rest who have gone to neighbouring cities to purchase the ingredient.\u201dLeylin rested by the windowsill. He stretched his hands and plucked a bunch of red berries from the table munching on them as snacks.\u201cCompared to other acolytes, however, my progress is akin to flying. After all, even the heir of a large family cannot use potions endlessly. What\u2019s more, these are precious potions that could increase Spiritual Force.\u201dWithin a month, Leylin already chased up to the fifth-grade acolytes who had pulled away from him over a year ago.\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that I\u2019m outside the academy. Only then am I able to pursue my experiments without fearing of the consequences, and use potions such as these!\u201d Leylin was suddenly rejoicing over the benefits that the war brought him.\u201cHowever, even if the war ends now, I wouldn\u2019t dare go back. I must, at least, wait until the 3 years mission duration is up. Only then will my excuse be plausible.At that moment, Leylin estimated that he would already be a Level 3 Acolyte. Apart from the professors, he would be considered to have power, and would be regarded as a more important member. Moreover, with these years as cover, he would have enough time to think up a few explanations to cover his tracks.\u201cMaster! An emissary from the City Lord has arrived with an invitation.\u201d Anna knocked on the door, entering only after getting Leylin\u2019s permission.Because of some Magus\u2019 doings, her face looked as youthful as ever, never changing.\u201cAn invitation?\u201d Leylin was a little skeptical. He did not have many relations with Viscount Jackson all this while.After looking the missive over, \u201cA gathering? On the invitation, it was specifically stated that Murphy and his circle of people were invited, which are all acolytes!\u201dLeylin surmised, \u201cCould it be? Some mysterious thing has happened that requires the help of magicians?\u201d\u201cAnna, prepare a horse carriage and a set of formal clothes for me. I have to leave for a while.\u201dLeylin said this without giving it another thought. Towards the Grand Knight, Viscount Jackson, who was also the Lord of Extreme Night City, it was difficult for an acolyte to interfere with his might. Therefore, Leylin did not want to be on bad terms with him.Moreover, due to the decreased supply of Hove Violet Leaves recently, Leylin did not have any other important things to do, so he could make time for this gathering.\u201cI\u2019ll have a look, and I haven\u2019t seen Murphy for some time now!\u201dIn the heart of Extreme Night City, the castle-like building which was built using grey rocks was extremely magnificent. There were many soldiers patrolling the area, revealing its prestige.* Ta-Ta! * A black horse carriage suddenly halted in front of the City Lord\u2019s castle. The carriage door opened, and a brown-haired noble youth stepped down from it. He looked rather thin, but his bright eyes were filled with vigour.At that same instant, another horse carriage, made of reddish brown wood, halted alongside it too. From it stepped out a white bearded geezer who was carrying a book. He radiated a scholarly aura.After seeing Leylin, every wrinkle on the old geezer\u2019s face loosened as he smiled. He took the initiative and spread his arms out, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, my friend!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you, Scholar Murphy!\u201d Leylin smiled as he gently hugged the old man.His relationship with Murphy was pretty good. Although this old geezer had a few demerits, but it was undeniable that some of his experiences were a source of great enlightenment for Leylin. When Leylin had first arrived in Extreme Night City, Murphy had also given much help to Leylin.Both of them conversed casually. They flashed their invitation cards at the same time as they went past the guarded entrance.A person, rather like a butler, led Leylin and Murphy through the garden and brought them to a small-sized living room.Several acolyte residents were already there and Leylin went forward to greet them.There was a circular sofa in the middle of the living room, with a mahogany table at its centre. It seemed to suggest equality between status and levels.\u201cWelcome, my friends!\u201dThe tough looking Viscount Jackson entered. He looked the same, to Leylin, as he looked a year ago. Time did not seem to have caused any changes in him, apart from a few more strands of hair white behind his ears that is.\u201cCity Lord!\u201d The acolytes all nodded their heads.\u201cCome, no need for formalities! Sit!\u201d Viscount Jackson casually sat on the sofa and serving maids that wore low cut blouses served some red tea as refreshments, with matching flavoured cake and biscuit snacks.\u201cWhy does the atmosphere seem to be like a conference and afternoon tea?\u201d Although he had his doubts, Leylin never revealed anything.Viscount Jackson and the acolytes sat in a circle, and, from time to time, they discussed the latest news. On the whole, the atmosphere felt extremely amiable.\u201cA pity, Viscount Jackson is known to be a cold-blooded person. I heard that to suppress a riot, he immediately ordered the execution of a whole village, even hanging all its resident\u2019s heads on wooden stakes\u2026.\u201dLeylin still put on a friendly mannerism, but deep down he exclaimed, \u201cAs expected, to interact harmoniously, one must first have the prerequisite of equal power!\u201d\u201cYes, speaking of Baron Fey, he has recently been distressed about the issues of the medicine shop!\u201d Viscount Jackson inadvertently spoke of this while chatting idly.\u201cWe have also heard of the withering woods of Dark Night Woods for some time now. Only that we have not arrived at any solution yet!\u201d An acolyte sitting at the side spoke, playing at being a character interested in delving deeper into this topic.Murphy\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cI believe that my lord Viscount will definitely have a solution, right?\u201dHowever, Viscount Jackson smiled wryly, \u201cMy friends! I have already used ravens to inform the royal family, but up to now I have not received any reply\u2026.I am completely at a loss about what to do in this situation!\u201d\u201cRoyal family?\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart thumped, the royal family behind the Poolfield Kingdom was supported by Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. The relationship between the two parties was extremely intricate. This mission appearing in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was finally no longer strange anymore.Speaking of which, he was even the representative sent by Abyssal Bone Forest Academy to remedy this problem, but he had been lackadaisical about it. He had finally forced Viscount Jackson to have no solution but to request help from this group of acolytes.Although deep within he smiled cynically, on the surface Leylin still put on the same front. He picked up the cup of hot tea and sipped, without any intention of owning up.\u201cIs it only a high levelled creature that had mutated? Could it be that Sire cannot even resolve this?\u201d A red-haired, middle-aged man asked.Leylin recognised this person; he had opened an apparel store in Extreme Night City and many clothes in his villa had been purchased from there.The city\u2019s residents knew that the owner of this clothing store was a friendly, middle-aged man, who even has a beautiful daughter. But they never knew that he was a magician.\u201cTruth be told, I have already struck against it once before! I have even killed a lizard type creature, but it was of no help towards this withering woods case!\u201dViscount Jackson flicked his hand.\u201cRight now, the withering woods area has expanded to a span of about two villages. If not resolved, sooner or later, it will encompass the whole of Dark Night Woods. When that happens, obtaining another herb from it would be only a dream!\u201dViscount Jackson clenched his fists.The herb industry was the pillar of Extreme Night City\u2019s economy. Every year the City Lord\u2019s castle gained a lot from the high taxes it imposed on these trades. Right now its tax income had been drastically reduced. It was no wonder that Viscount Jackson was unable to sit still.\u201cCould you let us have a look at the composition of some of that lizard\u2019s body parts?\u201d Murphy asked.\u201cYes!\u201d Viscount Jackson clapped his hands, and a golden yellow-haired maid brought forward a silver tray. Displayed on it were some brown-yellow scales.The surrounding acolytes all picked up a piece; Leylin too placed one in his hands.\u201cA.I. Chip! Scan!\u201d The brown yellow scales were the size of a thumb, cold to the touch.[Suspected to be the scale of a mutated creature, estimated to be a mutation of a lizard type in the Poolfield Kingdom! The surface emits mild radiation, the quality is a mess, extractable materials have been destroyed, useless as component material!]The A.I. Chip relayed the information after the scanning.\u201cNo wonder the magicians in the canyon did not react! There was simply no use of this creature\u2019s body parts to magicians. It\u2019s the whole body is not even worth a Magic Crystal. Who would do such a strenuous yet unrewarding task!\u201dLeylin was somewhat enlightened. To Magi, benefits were paramount. They will not do anything that reaped no benefits.The withering woods case happened on the boundaries of Extreme Night City. If there were any benefits or some magician who liked the creatures material, it would have long been resolved by the acolytes at the resource point in the ravine.Their letting this current state of affairs continues only meant one thing: there were no benefits at all from solving the withering woods debacle, only trouble. If there were any benefits, they were too small to cover the potential losses a venture would incur. This was why it had not been resolved after all this while.\u201cWhat a pity! It is not a high-level creature that magicians need, just a mutated organism, which has no use to them!\u201d Murphy said after picking up a magnifying glass like object and scrutinising the scale for some time. He reached the same conclusion as Leylin.\u201cHow is that? Any solutions?\u201d Viscount Jackson put on a hopeful expression and looked at his guests.\u201cMost mutated organisms were caused by long-term exposure from its surroundings. Without further detail and research, I cannot make arrive at any conclusion from just this! Moreover, I don\u2019t think that this creature is the main culprit for the withering woods.\u201dMurphy shook his head.\u201cI am willing to give 30 Magic Crystals to every person, in addition to 5000 gold coins to ask you guys to scout the area. How about that? This is my request, on account of us being old friends!\u2019Viscount Jackson looked the people in the circle and saw that the other acolytes too lacked interest. He could not help but clench his teeth as he stated this.\u201cSince it is troublesome for my lord Viscount, I definitely will not refuse!\u201dMurphy said somewhat grudgingly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWithering WoodsPressured by Viscount Jackson\u2019s aggressive request, very soon the other acolytes agreed too.After all, they had been in his territory for so long, and he was also a Grand Knight, so it would be awkward if they were to decline.However there was an exception, the acolyte with acne, whom Leylin saw before, refused without hesitation.Finally, the Viscount\u2019s gaze focused on Leylin, \u201cHow about you, Mister Leylin?\u201dViscount Jackson had some reservation towards Leylin. This was because the timing of Leylin\u2019s arrival was a coincidence which made him guess that this acolyte was the emissary who had accepted the royal family\u2019s mission.It was a pity that ever since Leylin had arrived, he had spent most of his time in the manor, and rarely left the place. Neither were there any magicians who came forward seeking revenge on him, so it seemed like this acolyte was truly a reclusive.If it were not for the fact that Leylin gave orders so a mission to the withering woods would go forth, Viscount Jackson would have been utterly disappointed.\u201cAfter all, it has to be done, and going in as a party is better!\u201dLeylin thought deep down, yet on the surface he appeared extremely hesitant, \u201cRecently I have been researching potions, and am extremely busy. Some of my experiments have reached a crucial stage\u2026.\u201d\u201cStill, I beseech Mister Leylin to take time out for this!\u201d Viscount Jackson said suddenly, \u201cI know that you have been buying Hove Violet Leaves en masse recently. This ingredient is rather rare, and other cities as well do not have too much of this in their reserves. However, our castle has a storehouse. If Mister Leylin agrees to go on this scouting trip, I am willing to add those in our reserves as a reward!\u201d\u201cHove Violet Leaves?\u201d Leylin eyes flashed; this was an unexpected surprise. He estimated this offer to be Viscount Jackson\u2019s threshold. Leylin appeared to \u2018struggle\u2019 on the surface, before finally agreeing.Afterwards, the acolytes made plans for a concrete time to meet, before leaving hurriedly to make preparations.For this bunch of acolytes, who wholeheartedly wanted to retire and live like princes, Leylin did not put much stock in their actual battle prowess.\u201cHowever, when all is said and done, they are still acolytes. Their basic spells, once cast, should still be something.\u201d Leylin consoled himself.At this moment, Murphy who just bade the others farewell walked beside Leylin with a frown on his expression, \u201cYoung man, when we reach the withering woods you have to protect me.\u201d\u201cSire! You are \u00a0Level 3! A Level 3 Acolyte! While I am but a Level 2 Acolyte!\u201d Leylin eyes widened.\u201cSigh\u2026I\u2019m already too old for this. I have forgotten much of my spell repertoire. You understand, forming the spell model is meticulous work, a small miss-step and the explosion will not even leave behind corpse!\u201d Murphy had a helpless expression.\u201cYou, how long has it been since you last cast a spell?\u201d Leylin suddenly had a bad premonition.\u201cIt seems almost 30 to 40 years! As you know, I have always regarded myself as a scholar!\u201d Murphy said very innocently.\u201cFuck!\u201d Leylin felt rather regretful suddenly.Two days later. In the morning, Extreme Night City\u2019s gates opened. Through those gates came a squadron of soldiers escorting a party in the middle. The group left the city\u2019s perimeter at a rapid pace.\u201cI never thought that Viscount Jackson would also set off with us!\u201d Murphy seemed to be very happy. Having a Grand Knight around, left him greatly assured.Riding beside him, Viscount Jackson wore black-coloured, steel armour with a helmet that covered his entire face.\u201cHow are your preparations?\u201d Leylin found a suitable time and whispered into Murphy\u2019s ears.\u201cI have concentrated these past 2 days, and can barely use two spell models,\u201d Murphy replied softly.\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Their conversation before was of a joking nature. Leylin would never believe that this crafty old geezer did not have any life-preserving trump cards up his sleeves.The Magus world is not a peaceful place. Without enough skills, Murphy would have long since died. So how could he have survived until now as a mere scholar?\u201cHowever, even the Black Iron Guards have been activated? There seem to be two small squadrons, about 20 men!\u201d\u201cOf course, these are all elite troops of the city!\u201d Murphy said. Actually, both he and Leylin knew that in the withering woods, those two squadrons served only one purpose. Cannon fodder!Dark Night Woods wasn\u2019t that far from the city. After travelling for about half an hour, the group managed to reach the wood\u2019s outskirts.\u201cThe danger level here is comparable to Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, despite its smaller size. At least, if a normal human were to be more alert, they can enter and leave here as they please when gathering the herbs!\u201dLeylin was at the centre of the party. Seeing the two squadrons paving the way at the front, his mind wandered.Along the way, Leylin felt the life force of the Dark Night Woods reducing. Although it was spring, the woods seemed to lack vitality.Moreover, everyone felt that their bodies were getting heavier and there was a shadow that veiled over their hearts. It felt extremely repressing.Leylin looked around. The roots of the tree showed signs of withering. Some of the fresh sprouts have even turned pale yellow.\u201cThe withering area has not extended to this point, but this is just a hypothesis!\u201d Leylin gasped.\u201cIt is indeed different here now! My family used to be hunters. In past years, there used to be animals prancing about in this area. There were many wild vegetables and fresh herbs\u2026.\u201dLeylin overheard the words a few soldiers whispered among themselves.\u201cA.I. Chip! Any change in the air around here?\u201d[Scanning. Comparing with the database! Conclusion: Oxygen density/levels decreased by 3.7%, Nitrogen density increased. An unknown noble gas has appeared. It currently accounts for 1.2% but its density continues to rise!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cCould this inert noble gas be the perpetrator of this withering woods event?\u201d Leylin stroked his chin, allowing the A.I. Chip to continue.\u201cBe careful! We have entered the withering domain!\u201d Viscount Jackson roared at the forefront of the group.Leylin patted his leather armour. Beneath it was the grey robes of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acting as a second layer of defense. He had even purposely removed the academy\u2019s insignia earlier.What the accompanying acolytes lacked were the ephemeral defensive constructs that the Magi layered around themselves as they went into battle. Victory often revolved solely on whether the spells cast managed to strike an opponent.\u201cInstantaneous spell casting, Potioneering Spells, Magic Artifacts were all great enhancers of an acolyte\u2019s battle strength!\u201dLeylin reached into his robes and took out a potion from a leather bag tied around the waist.In Brey Canyon, he had replenished his ingredients and had made many explosive potions as his ammunition for this expedition.As the group advanced, the environment began to change.More and more dried withered plants and trees filled the woods. They let off an aura of death and decay.Leylin reached out and grabbed a twig in passing. His eyes flashed, \u201cIt has already lost all its water content, and even\u2026.\u201dExerting a little more force in his palm, the twig immediately turned into white dust, trickled through the gaps in his fingers and floated down towards the ground.\u201cEven the internal structure has been completely destroyed!\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart felt rather heavy. A power like this already exceeded his expectations.\u201cWhere are we supposed to go?\u201d Viscount Jackson asked Murphy who was beside him.\u201cThe heart of the woods! Only by reaching the center of this withering region, can my spell exert enough effect!\u201d Murphy had on an extremely solemn expression. He withdrew a spectacle-like item and hung it on his nose.A wide withered tree lay on the ground. It had an extremely spongy feel when stepped on.[Warning! Warning! Dangerous organism ahead!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s alarm went off suddenly and Leylin tried to think of an excuse to use so he could warn the others.* Hu! * Suddenly brown-coloured branches and twigs flew up. A black figure came charging towards them.This figure was extremely quick. It opened its jaw littered with snow white fangs. A red-coloured tongue flicked out.* Su Su! * The tongue coiled around one of the guards on duty at the front and retracted its tongue. * Pa! * The guard\u2019s spear fell.\u201cBe careful!\u201d At this moment, Viscount Jackson gave a warning.\u201cArgh!\u201d The miserable cries sounded. The guard, trapped in the tongue\u2019s coils had already disappeared into a black hole. He was snapped into two halves. Fresh red blood and guts spilled onto the ground.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Viscount Jackson shouted angrily and brandished the wide sword that hung from his waist. He immediately went and engaged the black figure.\u201cSluggish Spell!\u201d The red-haired shop owner waved his hands. A yellow-green light was shot. It turned into a circular ring that closed on the black figure. The other acolytes began reacting and started their own incantations.* Sssii! * With the hissing of the creature, the black figure\u2019s speed finally slowed down revealing its appearance to everyone.Its body was clay-yellow in colour. It had four legs, a tongue that was like a snake\u2019s and a small horn on its forehead.\u201cWasn\u2019t it reported that this creature died already? Why is there still one?\u201d Leylin was suspicious, but he still activated the A.I. Chip.[Beep! Unknown organism. Strength: 5.5, Agility: 4 (6-7), Vitality: 5, Spiritual Force: 3. Similarity to Blue Lizard 67.4% and to Mance Earth Snake 45.8%]\u201cIt\u2019s a rather strong creature. Apart from its low Spiritual Force, it doesn\u2019t have any obvious flaws. Their numbers are also unknown; no wonder Jackson was not able to deal with them alone!\u201dHowever, as the Sluggish Spell took effect, this strange lizard\u2019s speed obviously took a hit. After a brief exchange of blows, the Viscount shouted, \u201cDeath Arc of Light!\u201dFrom within his blade, a resplendent circle of light expanded into the shape of a blade. It streaked past the lizard\u2019s neck.\u201cA Knight-class killing technique! It has the same properties as my Cross Slash. However, Jackson uses it with ease. He has not even used any Knight secret technique.\u201d* Bang! * The two passed each other. The huge lizard charged forward another few steps before suddenly crashing to the ground.* Sssii! * Clay yellow scales landed on the floor one by one. Around the lizard\u2019s neck area was a huge cut. Dark red blood spilled on the ground.\u201cAll of you look!\u201d An acolyte shouted suddenly.With the death of the lizard, its body continued to cave inwards, with the scales continuously falling off and littering the ground. The blood quickly evaporated too. Within a few short minutes, there was only a white skeleton and some yellow scales left on the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The same thing happened when I killed these creatures before.\u201dViscount Jackson took out a white handkerchief and wiped his blade clean, before sheathing it into the scabbard.\u201cThere\u2019s actually a self-disintegration phenomenon when it dies!\u201dLeylin was somewhat surprised. This did not correspond to the laws of nature.Looking at the skeleton that was still emitting white smoke, Leylin picked one of the bones up.The dried white bone was littered with cracks. It felt like any slight press would cause it to crumble. Leylin exerted a little more force, and with a hissing sound, the dried bone turned into fine powder.\u201cEn, something\u2019s off!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed. He discovered some fine threads of veins within the white bone powder.[Target still exuding vital energy. Identified to be a high-level pathogen. The host is recommended to keep a distance!] At this moment, the A.I. Chip\u2019s scan appeared in Leylin\u2019s vision.Leylin hurriedly flung off the powdery substance and began radiating internal energy particles from within his hands to cleanse them.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Murphy too discovered that something was amiss.\u201cBe careful of those bones, there\u2019s something inside it!\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed and he hurriedly distanced himself from it.* Sssii! * At that moment, more red blood veins appeared on the desiccated lizard\u2019s skeleton. The bone began to exhibit innumerable puncture holes. It seemed like the veins resided within the bones previously.Countless more blood red veins took shape, intertwining like the branches of a tree and started transforming into a small-sized creature.It was rather similar to the creature before, but now its body was blood red. From time to time, red veins popped out. The creature did not have eyes or a mouth. Its four legs appeared extremely sturdy, however.* Xiu! * The creature\u2019s attack was extremely fast. Before Viscount Jackson and the other acolytes could react, it left its original position. Only a red, blurry line could be seen.\u201cGive chase! This creature definitely has something to do with the withering woods!\u201d A person covered fully in grey robes whispered something to Viscount Jackson, who immediately gave the order.\u201cThat grey-robed person, has always been following Viscount Jackson ever since we left Extreme Night City. He must be a trusted aide. He also has great detection abilities.\u201dLeylin eyes narrowed as he used the A.I. Chip to scan. \u201cThis appearance and figure, there is also the energy waves of a Level 2 Acolyte? Interesting!\u201d\u201cHurry! Keep up!\u201dUpon hearing Viscount Jackson\u2019s orders, the Black Iron Guards immediately followed suit, overtaking Viscount Jackson and keeping him in their midst. The grey-robed person followed closely behind.The remaining acolytes looked at each other. Murphy, a little helplessly, said, \u201cLet\u2019s follow them!\u201dLeylin purposely suppressed his speed and kept to Murphy\u2019s speed, \u201cThat thing earlier, do you have any guesses as to what it was?\u201d\u201cIt seems to be some kind of parasite! According to its strength, the mother-parent has, at least, the strength of a Level 3 Acolyte\u2026.Or even that of an official Magus!\u201d Murphy smiled bitterly.Leylin and his small group were of no threat to an official Magus. Any Rank 1 spell could easily obliterate their entire party.\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be!\u201d Leylin shook his head. According to the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculations, that parasite\u2019s strength was not bad. The mother-parent\u2019s body should at most have the strength of a Level 3 Acolyte, theoretically speaking. Otherwise, Leylin would have been the first to run away.\u201cIt is only\u2026..just an investigative mission, I even picked it myself. That it can actually involve an organism with the strength of a Level 3 Acolyte, how bad can my luck be\u2026.\u201d Leylin did not know what to think of himself anymore.He was happy that he did not come here on his own before. Otherwise, unlike the main characters in the novels of his previous world, he was incapable of those fictional bursts of power in times of adversity. And the only outcome would be death.\u201cBe careful, we are venturing deeper. I can already feel the dense negative energy aura in the air!\u201dAn acolyte howled.Leylin had a higher perception towards negative energy. After all, his main affinities were Shadow and Dark Element particles. Just like Plant affinity and Light affinity emphasized on positive energy research, Leylin\u2019s affinities made him spend more time exposed to negative energy compared to the others.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the surroundings of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. No wonder I feel like a fish back in the water.\u201dLeylin pulled up his sleeves and covered the smile that pulled at the corners of his lips.* Clang! * Sounded their armour as the group halted.\u201cIt disappeared! I saw that red creature pausing at this spot for a moment, then it suddenly disappeared!\u201d Jackson brandished his long sword, \u201cBe on guard!\u201dThe Black Iron Guards immediately formed a circle protecting Jackson and the acolytes within to prevent any sneak attacks.\u201cThis should be the heart of the withering woods!\u201d Murphy rubbed his nose.\u201cThe scouting method I have prepared can now be used!\u201d Murphy took a black coloured potion from his robes and poured the contents on the ground after opening the plug.* Plop plop! *After the black coloured potion was poured on the forest floor, it actually turned into tiny ants scampering in all directions.After the potion was used up, Leylin estimated that there were close to ten thousand ants that appeared.\u201cA scout like this can be considered to have omnidirectional coverage. It will be extremely difficult for that creature to escape!\u201d Leylin thought.As expected, after roughly a dozen minutes, a black coloured ant appeared at Murphy\u2019s feet, crawled on his robes all the way to his ears, and appeared as if it whispered something.\u201cIt\u2019s been found! Follow me!\u201d Murphy followed the ant and led the group to a withered oak tree.\u201cMove this oak tree away!\u201d Murphy pointed at the large tree, \u201cAccording to my probing, there seems to be a secret tunnel underneath it.\u201d\u201cSquad 1! Go!\u201d Jackson waved his hands.Several Black Iron Guards went forward and stabbed their pikes at the oak tree.The withered oak tree did not seem capable of withstanding the assault. After being pierced multiple times by the pikes, many pieces and chips of bark filled the air as if it were snowing. The ten guards hurriedly moved the completely withered oak tree away revealing a dark sinister tunnel.\u201cHere it is!\u201d Murphy\u2019s eyes flashed, and he chanted an incantation.The widely spread black ants returned from all directions and entered the hole.Suddenly, Murphy\u2019s face turned pale, and his body fell backwards, almost fainting.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Leylin appeared behind Murphy and supported his waist.\u201cThere seems to be an extremely dangerous creature inside. It destroyed all of my precious babies!\u201d Murphy\u2019s expression appeared very unsightly.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d An acolyte asked, apparently wanting to leave.\u201cPrepare a fire!\u201d Jackson waves his hands, \u201cWe\u2019ll have a look down there!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The guards quickly carried out their lord\u2019s orders. Leylin and the other acolytes looked at each other. Having no other choice, they could only follow.The hole was rather small. A grown man needed to crouch before they could enter. However, the tunnel became more spacious the deeper it went, until a number of guards could walk abreast, even raising the fire torches high did not touch the cave\u2019s ceiling.\u201cThis is going to be troublesome! From the height of this cave, that \u2018parent\u2019s\u2019 body will definitely not be small.\u201d Leylin felt the leather sack hanging from his waist. If not for the multiple trump cards he prepared, he might have already sneaked away and left the group by now.After all, his life was more precious than the wrath of a city\u2019s lord.\u201cLord Viscount! There\u2019s a fork ahead!\u201d A squad leader reported to Jackson.\u201cLet me have a look!\u201d Jackson stepped forward.Leylin followed behind. As expected, there seemed to be two perfectly similar tunnels ahead. Looking at the darkness of their unfathomable depths, one could not see the tunnel\u2019s end. It felt like walking into the huge mouth of a beast.\u201cThe negative energy in here is becoming too dense. Some of our scouting methods cannot be used here!\u201d The city lord\u2019s aide, the grey-robed person spoke.\u201cCall two men to reconnoiter each path ahead!\u201d Jackson\u2019s brows furrowed as he gave the order.\u201cIt would be better to let me do it!\u201d Leylin walked forward suddenly.Since he knew that the \u2018parent\u2019 was extremely powerful, he did not want his side to lose too much battle strength.\u201cSince Mister Leylin has decided to step forward, then it\u2019s for the best!\u201d Viscount Jackson smiled.Leylin walked forward several steps and took out a transparent crystal from his robes.\u201cGurisitong \u2013 Jiaonateyer!\u201d Leylin chanted. A black vertical pupil suddenly appeared within the depths of the crystal.The vertical pupil was the same size as a human\u2019s, but it did not have the white of a human eye. Looking at this pure black pupil made one feel as if it could tear their souls from their bodies.\u201cThis is\u2026 The Negative Energy Eye!\u201d\u201cOnly acolytes who specialise in negative energy are able to use it!\u201dThe acolytes behind began to whisper and their gazes contained more hostility and fear than before.The Rank 0 spells of Magicians who specialises in negative energy are generally more destructive and their personalities were more bloodthirsty and savage than most other Magi. This normally meant being a Dark Magi.The regular magicians\u2019 hostile looks were understandable.Leylin did not have any inclinations of explaining himself to the people behind him whatsoever. His fingers exerted force and pinched the crystal to pieces.The black pupil split into two. One floated into each tunnel.Following the vertical pupils mentally, Leylin\u2019s closed his eyes. Viscount Jackson became rather nervous as he stared at Leylin. The group grew quiet, only the constant soft snapping noise of torches burning could be heard.A few minutes later, Leylin opened his eyes, \u201cOn the tunnel to the left are a few mutated lizards. At its end is a large granite rock.\u201d\u201cAs for the one on the right, I only know that it leads unknown distance downwards. My spell got smashed after I tried probing further.\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s that way, let\u2019s all go down together.\u201d Jackson pointed to the tunnel on the right.The right side of the cave got damper and more humid. Leylin touched the mud walls and found a few moss-like plants strewn all over it dripping wet, \u201cIt\u2019s moist!\u201dLeylin\u2019s heart lurched, but his expression remained impassive. He took out a white handkerchief from his robes and wiped his hands clean.\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re nearing the nest of those strange creatures.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s a light ahead!\u201dA guard walking in the vanguard shouted.Leylin took a look. Indeed, the far end of the tunnel was radiating light.\u201cEnter!\u201d Jackson gripped his large sword with both hands and was the first to rush in.The rest followed suit.Light! Eye-piercing light radiated downwards from above!Leylin\u2019s eyes were stinging \u2014 tears flowed down uncontrollably. He immediately used his hand to cover his eyes.\u201cArgh!\u201d \u201dMonster!\u201d \u201dBe careful!\u201dVarious shouts resounded, and weapons were brandished.[Alert! Imminent attack ahead! Optimal response: step back and crouch!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned and projected a faint blue screen.On the screen, a talon the size of a palm was clawing towards Leylin.Leylin hurriedly retreated a step and crouched to dodge the attack.Amidst the wails all around, Jackson\u2019s faint howling could be heard.After the A.I. Chip\u2019s scan, Leylin could see that many lizard-like creatures were making use of their familiarity with the geography to attempt a massacre of Jackson and the squad of guards around him.The sneak attack was so quick that when Jackson and the rest finally reacted, the whole squad already suffered heavy casualties.As Leylin swept his gaze across the scene before him and his eyes finally adjusted to the bright light. He realised that the floor was already littered with corpses. Many of them had traces of having been chewed on by these strange creatures.At that moment, only the 2 Knight level squad leaders and the grey robed figure, who always followed behind Jackson, were all that remained of the group with Jackson.As for the acolytes, one had fallen to the ground and another had a large wound on his abdomen that was oozing blood.At the apex of the cave, white-coloured jellyfish-like creatures were floating. The flash from earlier had radiated from their bodies.\u201cThe surge of light radiated from these jellyfish could actually increase instantaneously and produce an effect similar to a flashbang grenade. The coordination demonstrated by these strange creatures that caused several deaths and injuries definitely hinted at some intelligence controlling them from behind the scenes!\u201dAfter light burst from the jellyfish, they seemed to have become a little dispirited as they floated around in the air. Although there was still some light emanating from their bodies, it was not piercing to the eyes. It seemed like the flash from earlier was a one time attack.\u201cThis is a Flash Jellyfish, a kind of subterranean creature. Their earlier attack can only be used once. They need a day of rest before emitting such an intense burst of light again!\u201dMurphy appeared, clutching a book to his chest.\u201cWhat we need to deal with are not these parasitic organisms, but that fellow in the middle!\u201d Leylin pointed to the centre of the cave, and smiled bitterly.Leylin and the rest entered a large underground cave earlier, where the ceiling was littered with stalactites and Flash Jellyfish, which allowed them a panoramic view of the interior.At this moment, in the cave, there were many mutated, yet familiar creatures. There were lizards, brown bears, and elks, all numbering over a dozen. At the centre most of them all, there was an enormous yellow snake that seemed to be the king, as it was guarded by the other creatures.\u201cIt\u2019s Mankestre \u2013 Great Withering Snake Mankestre!\u201d Murphy\u2019s book fell from his hands to the floor, letting off a bang.\u201cA.I. Chip, scan!\u201d Leylin instructed.[Great Withering Snake \u2013 Mankestre (Half-adult body) Strength: 11.9, Agility: 6.5, Vitality: 14, Spiritual Force: 8][Abilities: 1 \u2013 Parasitic. A Mankestre is able to develop an extremely strong parasite in its body, and spread it to other organisms, making them its underlings.][2 \u2013 Wither. In any areas where a Mankestre has passed by, the plants will die, and become a type of nutrient for the Mankestre. An adult Mankestre possesses the strength of an official Magus, and can transform an entire forest into withering ashes.][Source of information: <Creatures Illustrated Handbook>, <Nigel\u2019s Travels>]The A.I. Chip delivered the information immediately in front of Leylin.\u201cHalf-adult body? It doesn\u2019t seem to be at its adult stage!\u201d Leylin first heaved a breath of relief, before shouting out loud, \u201cMurphy, don\u2019t be fooled by its appearance. This is but a non-adult Mankestre. We still have a chance!\u201d\u201cIndeed!\u201d Murphy scrutinised the brown yellow colour of the huge snake and finally recovered from his fright, \u201cAn adult Mankestre is at least 100 metres long, and this snake is obviously not of that length yet. A number of parasites that it produces is also not right!\u201d\u201cThis huge snake is the cause of the withering woods?\u201d Jackson asked at the side while staring at the huge snake as his Adam\u2019s apple moved.\u201cThat\u2019s right! A Mankestre uses the juice of plants as their food. They are rather crafty and lazy, and also hate to move about. Basically, it uses the parasites to gather food for itself!\u201dMurphy, who had bountiful experience and wisdom, was extremely aware of the habits of the huge Mankestre Snake.\u201cSo then, if we kill it, the herb production in Dark Night Woods can recover again?\u201d Jackson used his long sword and pointed at the huge yellow snake that was protected by its parasitic mutated creatures.\u201cIn theory, it should be the case as long as you kill it or drive it away. Although its death cannot revive the withering woods, it can still allow the prey and woods to slowly recover back to what it once was!\u201dMurphy smiled wryly.* Hiss! * The snake coiled in the centre of the cave hissed, and let off a low, snake-like speech.It was a kind of sound made by the friction of rubbing two pieces rotten leather together, which was extremely unpleasant to the ears.The creatures surrounding Leylin and the rest seemed to have received orders, and howled as they charged forward!Leylin casually took a look, \u201cThere are too many creatures, and the parent body is not yet dealt with, I must conserve my magic power!\u201d\u201cA.I. Chip! Simulate the most optimal method of attack!\u201dLeylin pulled out his cross blade.[Beep! Inputting situation data, initiating build with Host\u2019s stats!][Calculating battle simulation for the most optimal method!] The A.I. Chip continuously displayed the attack style of creatures surrounding home.Leylin\u2019s feet moved as he dodged a brown bear\u2019s attack. The cross blade in his right hand drew a strange trajectory, and deflected the paw of the bear, and directly pierced through its skull.* Bang! * The huge brown corpse of the bear fell to the ground, and even the Mankestre Snake had taken notice, looking at Leylin.Leylin\u2019s scalp tingled, as he hurriedly kept his distance.\u201cNicely done!\u201d Jackson shouted in admiration. His body seemed to turn into a gust of wind, and continuously ravaged the mob of creatures, leaving a trail of blood behind him.\u201cIt seems that Jackson has ignited the secret Knight technique! His technique should be enhancing his agility \u201dThe few acolytes also casted their Rank 0 spells that they had prepared and assisted in killing these creatures.Leylin only took a look and did not bother about them anymore.* Sssii! *The corpse of the brown bear that Leylin had killed rapidly decomposed. From the bones, many veins appeared, which turned into the creature that Leylin and the rest had been chasing earlier. The creature then climbed into the Mankestre\u2019s mouth.The Mankestre Snake opened its mouth and revealed rows of razor sharp teeth. Its tongue coiled, as it swallowed the strange red veined creature into its belly.\u201cRetrieving its parasite huh?\u201d Leylin was rather shocked.After swallowing the parasite, the Mankestre Snake finally uncoiled and looked at Leylin and the group, who were unrestrainedly slaughtering the creatures. Its crimson eyes showed signs of rage.* Bang! * The huge body of the snake shot out, and the entire cave trembled violently.The huge Mankestre Snake\u2019s body moved at an alarming speed, charging towards Jackson.\u201cIt\u2019s too quick! With an agility of 6.5, I can only see its afterimage \u201d Leylin rapidly retreated, and at the same time, he used the cross blade to block his chest.A surge of immense force came rushing over, and the cross blade that Leylin held onto flew in the air, completely broken .\u201cSuch a strong force, and it\u2019s only a casual swipe!\u201d Leylin\u2019s pupils constricted.The Mankestre Snake opened its jaws wide, and its razor sharp teeth snapped at Jackson, bringing about a fish-like smell. If Jackson were to be caught, he would definitely die without a corpse left.\u201cSir!\u201d The remaining two Knights and the grey robed person shouted.\u201cHah! Good try!\u201d At the brink of death, Jackson finally released all of his internal energy, and the sword pierced at the crown of the snake with a speed that was hard to track by eye.The sword, however, only left a white spot on the scales of the snake. As for Jackson, he used the force to rebound, and twisted his waist, evading the snap of the snake\u2019s jaw.\u201cProtect our Lord!\u201d The two Knights rushed forward. The Mankestre Snake let out a ferocious roar, and directly gobbled the two Knights into its belly.\u201cSecondary Fireball!\u201d\u201cAcidic Aqua Shot\u201dAt this moment, the other acolytes also cast their spells, striking the body of the huge snake.* Bang! * A black arrow with a yellow flame exploded from the body of the huge snake, revealing two scorched holes/wounds/gashes.The huge snake let off a roar, which carried a tinge of agony. Its scales shook, and it sent its tail flying towards the few acolytes.\u201cThe vitality of the snake is too high, any normal Rank 0 spells would not be able to affect its movement at all!\u201dThe huge snake swatted its tail, and a few acolytes who were unable to dodge in time were turned into meat pancakes, and blood oozed from beneath the snake\u2019s body.\u201cNo! Decker! Lancer!\u201d Murphy cried hoarsely in anguish.\u201cThere\u2019s no choice, we have to retreat first!\u201d The few remaining people huddled together, when the grey robed figure behind Jackson spoke in a deep growl.\u201cNo! This damned worm dared to kill Decker and the rest! I will definitely not let it go!\u201d Murphy\u2019s eyes were rather bloodshot.\u201cI have a spell that can temporarily restrict its movements, the rest will be up to you guys.\u201dMurphy stepped forward, placed the monocle that he always carried in his hand, and tossed it towards the huge snake.* Bang! * The glass shattered on the huge snake, and many dark red runes suddenly surfaced.The dark red runes multiplied, and turned into the shape of a long chain, binding the snake within it.\u201cWhat a powerful restraining spell!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cIt will not be able to move for at least half a minute, so use whatever methods you guys have in that time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, under the restraint of the shackles, the huge snake was helplessly locked to the ground, not even able to move.\u201cHurry, charge!\u201d Jackson howled, and the huge sword radiated light.On the other side, the grey-robed person too lifted his cloak, and revealed a Half-Beast Man appearance as he hurriedly chanted an incantation.* Roar! * The remaining creatures felt the danger that their parent was in, and rushed forward, with no thoughts for their own safety, towards Leylin and the rest.\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Leylin pulled out a few fire red coloured explosive potions and decimated the remaining creatures into ashes.\u201cTo the Mankestre snake, the eyes are their Achilles heel, and is even more vulnerable than the heart.Leylin howled, at the same time chanting.Along with the chanting of the mysterious and ancient Byron language resounding in the cave, a hoard of congealed and thick black oily bodies appeared beside Leylin, completely surrounding him.These black, oily figures circled around Leylin, giving off bubbles from time to time, and letting off a sound that was akin to decomposing material. While he continued to chant, the black oiled figures continuously changed shape, finally turning into a black lion head-like apparition.\u201cGo!\u201d Leylin pointed.The black lion head roared, and charged towards the crown of the huge snake which was being restrained.* Pu! * The lion head immediately bit on both of the Mankestre snake\u2019s eyes.* Sssii! * The huge snake writhed continuously, letting off an agonised screech. The rune shackles on its body were also emitting off red smoke.\u201cHurry!\u201d I cannot keep this up much longer!\u201d Murphy completely diverged from his scholarly image and howled without a care.The black lion head continuously chewed on the head of the huge snake, and finally dissolved, turning into a puddle of greasy black oil, that covering the head of the huge snake, and eventually covered both of its eyes.\u201cIt is now!\u201d Leylin eyes flashed and withdrew a test tube. The contents radiated a blood red light, which excreted feelings of danger.This was an explosive potion, but was much larger in comparison had a larger blast radius was larger in circumference as in compared to the previous potions.The muscles of Leylin\u2019s right arm bulged as he tossed the potion directly into the black oil.* Bang! * A tremendous flame rose, completely engulfing the huge Mankestre snake, and burning it savagely.The huge snake continuously tossed its head, which looked like a huge burning torch from, side to side.The rune shackles around it also let off creaking noises which meant that it could not endure for much longer.\u201cThe decomposing oil water that comes from the subterranean area, together with the A.I. Chip\u2019s modified explosive potion gives off a combined attack of at least 9 degrees!\u201dBlue light in continuously flashed from within Leylin\u2019s eyes, as he recorded the figures from the explosion.\u201cPant! Pant! The earlier attack has already broken through most of the huge Mankestre snake\u2019s defence! Now is the time to kill it!\u201dLeylin panted violently, and his face was extremely pale. It was like he had completely depleted his Spiritual Force and Magic Power, and he staggered several steps behind.From an area of his sleeve which was concealed from others, another of the modified explosive potions, which was used earlier, appeared in his hands.Leylin would never place his hopes completely on others, especially at crucial times like this.At this moment, the Half-Beast Man had finished chanting his spell.\u201cThe strength of my forebearer\u2019s totem, transform now into frigid ice, and grant me the might to slay the Mankestre snake!\u201dThe Half-Beast Man finished his spell, and touched lightly on Jackson\u2019s sword.* Sssii! *On the blade of Jackson\u2019s huge sword, a layer of frost began to envelop it, , and the frost grew more and more, before finally enlarging the of the blade to double of its original size, and turning it into a frost greatsword!What the Half-Beast Man had cast was actually a kind of rarely seen spell which could enhance weapons!\u201cAccording to the scan of the A.I. Chip, at this moment, the greatsword in Jackson\u2019s hands already has the strength of a basic level Magic Artifact!\u201dLeylin eyes flashed, \u201cIt is a rather decent enchanting technique!\u201dJackson had obviously teamed up with the Half-Beast Man many times before. Earlier, he had been conserving his energy, and once the greatsword had completed the layer of frost, Jackson howled and raised it above him, charging and chopping towards the neck of the Mankestre snake.The sword, which seemed like a giant crystallised ice sculpture, directly chopped at a blackened patch of the huge snake with Jackson\u2019s strength of a Grand Knight.* Pu-chi! *Red hot blood flowed down continuously from a deep gash on the neck of the Mankestre snake, which seemed to be almost half a metre deep. One could even see the whites of the bones. The huge snaked roared, and headbutted with all its strength.* Bang! * Viscount Jackson was immediately knocked away, and even the breastplate he was wearing was dented inwards.The frost greatsword landed upright by his side, burying itself halfway into the ground.* Ping Ping Ping! * The layer of ice continuously cracked, and finally even the sword, which was made of steel, shattered into countless fragments that landed on the floor.\u201cIt seems like this spell isn\u2019t completely flawless either!\u201d Leylin was still in the mood to observe leisurely.However, at this moment, Murphy\u2019s complexion turned red, \u201cI can\u2019t control it any longer!\u201dUnder the continuous struggles of the Mankestre snake, the rune shackles around it finally collapsed with a rattling sound. As for the price of being able to free itself, the snake had already suffered a dozen wounds which penetrated through its scales.As for the heavily injured Mankestre snake, its bloodshot eyes turned even more crimson. With lightning speed, it swiped and coiled its tail. Before Leylin could react, he realised that there was one less person beside him. The Half-Beast Man which originally stood there was now wrapped up in the snake\u2019s tail.\u201cNo! Save me!\u201d The tail continuously constricted, and the huge snake\u2019s figure almost covered the entirety of the Half-Beast Man.At this moment, Jackson, who was not sure if he was still alive or dead, lay on the side, and could not answer his subordinate cries at all.* Ga-cha! * With a creaking noise, the ear-piercing sounds of bones shattering resounded in the air. The Half-Beast Man\u2019s distressed cries climbed \u00a0higher in pitch, until finally, it turned into dead silence.Leylin watched the huge, moribund snake attentively, as he drew a few potions of various colours.* Bang! *A huge black figure attacked, and hit a yellow test tube that had left Leylin\u2019s hands. In the surrounding area, a layer of yellow light appeared, and engulfed Leylin\u2019s entire body.The immense might crashed into Leylin and he was sent flying, crashing into a nearby granite rock. Mud flew above his head as he landed, and there was even a huge impression left on the rock behind his back.At the same time as Leylin was sent back flying, a layer of intense red flames extended from the snake\u2019s tail, and multiple colours of light also blossomed on the snake\u2019s body, finally resulting in the cries of the Mankestre snake.The yellow light shattered into many pieces, before finally dissipating into the air.Leylin\u2019s body was completely unscathed, and seeing the many spots of dazzling yellow light, he grimaced.\u201cThe weakness of acolytes is that they always have no defensive measures!\u201dThe defensive spell models for Rank 0 spells were extremely uncommon, as they were not very practical. When an acolyte is being attacked, rarely would they have time to chant those spells.As a result, in battles between acolytes, whoever was struck first by a spell would end up defeated or killed.This scenario would last until one reached the stage of an official Magus.Apart from this, there was another method, which was to borrow strength from special items. For example, defensive or strange items which could instantly activate a defence spell.However, such high leveled defensive items were even difficult to obtain for official Magus, so they rarely appeared in the hands of an acolyte.Leylin and the other acolytes, together with the Half-Beast Man, all had no defensive items. At most, they only wore leather armour, which had absolutely no resistance against spells.Moreover, a simple roll of the Mankestre snake would have already been able to grind them into a meat paste.\u201cAccording to the records of the academy, there are still a number of acolytes who die at the hands of Knights and Grand Knights. However, there has never been any instance of an official Magus dying at the hands of ordinary humans!\u201dAs for this yellow potion, it was Leylin\u2019s latest experimental result \u2013 Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion!A potion like this has already separated itself from the category of elementary potions. It was a kind of beginner\u2019s potion, and even amongst the beginner potion category it was extremely difficult to brew.As for the effect, it would produce a one-time defensive layer of light, which would defend against any spell or physical attack of ten degrees or less!With Leylin\u2019s amassed wealth from selling potions, together with the A.I. Chip continuous simulation, he had finally managed to make only two bottles of it.The amount he spent for these had already exceeded over 1000 Magic Crystals!\u201cThese potions are not easily affordable by others, and all official Magi attacks have an attack strength of over 10 degrees, so this Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion is best used only at the level of battles between acolytes. However, every bottle costs at least 500 Magic Crystals. Even direct heirs to large families would not be able to afford it!\u201dHowever, for Leylin who had the help from A.I. Chip, which could elevate his success rate, combined with his Potions Master identity, he could brew the Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion, suppressing the cost to around 200 to 300 Magic Crystals. Although it still remained steep in price, as it was a trump card, it was acceptable.\u201cLeylin!\u201d Murphy\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYou\u2026Are you alright?\u201d\u201cEn! I\u2019ve wasted an expensive defensive potion that I\u2019ve acquired!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face darkened, and seemed to be extremely saddened by the loss.\u201cThis damned beast, I\u2019m going to kill it!\u201dOn the other side of the battlefield, the huge Mankestre snake lay half dead on the floor, seemingly spent, and having wounds strewn across its body.First, it was hit with Leylin\u2019s hybrid attack, before almost having its head chopped off by Grand Knight Jackson. Afterwards, it escaped from Murphy\u2019s rune shackles through brute force, before it was finally struck again by Leylin\u2019s potions.The snake head, which was always held high with pride, now lay helpless on the floor. Its tongue hissed, and blood continuously flowed out from its neck area.\u201cAfter having suffered from such a devastating injury, no matter how tenacious the life force of snake type creatures are, they will absolutely still perish!\u201dMurphy gritted his teeth, and shot a green coloured pyramid shaft, which directly lodged itself into the eyes of the huge snake.* Pu! * The snake\u2019s eyes were finally pierced through, and a layer of creamy red and yellow liquid splashed out, which was sparkling yet translucent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From a group of roughly 30 people, the Black Iron Guards were completely wiped out, and Murphy was the only acolyte that survived.Moreover, the city lord and the Grand Knight, Viscount Jackson, was severely injured at this moment, and his life was in peril.And the source of them all was \u00a0this huge Mankestre snake!\u201cCity lord? Right, Leylin! Hurry and look at Jackson!\u201d Murphy slapped his forehead.\u201cYou only thought of him now?\u201d Leylin was rather speechless, and walked around the huge snake corpse, coming to the other side.Viscount Jackson was lying on his back on the ground and his chest was sunken in a cavity. On the corners of his lips were traces of blood, and he was in an unconscious state.Leylin hurriedly took a look, \u201c3 broken ribs and the arm and leg bones are all also broken. As for the rest they are fine. With the Vitality of a Grand Knight, he should be conscious in a few hours.\u201cThat\u2019s good! This is the only good news I\u2019ve heard all day today!\u201dMurphy walked towards that huge, lifeless snake, and said, \u201cThis seems to be a Mankestre snake which has not yet grown to its adult stage. If it was an adult withering huge snake, it could be very likely that the water content in our bodies would have been sucked dry the very moment we entered the cave!\u201dThe huge Mankestre snake\u2019s head fell onto the floor, and a pair of eye-shaped pearls were pierced by the pyramid shaft, and dazzling fluid flowed out from within.\u201cEven so, the materials on this huge snake, would also be worth thousands of Magic Crystals!\u201dMurphy caressed the yellow-brown scales of the huge snake as he muttered to himself.Suddenly, the other eye of the Mankestre snake opened! Its gaze, filled with hatred, immediately landed on Murphy. It opened its jaws, and the razor-sharp teeth was about to snap Murphy into two.This huge snake was not completely dead!Earlier it had feigned its death, and right now, it finally revealed its razor-sharp teeth and was about to kill this repulsive human.Against such an attack, Murphy was completely not protected and he stood there stunned, not moving at all.\u201cBe careful!\u201dRight when the snow-white teeth was about to land on Murphy, a silver chain suddenly flew out and wrapped itself on Murphy\u2019s waist, pulling him out of danger\u2019s way.A black arrow directly pierced the other eye of the snake, and the Mankestre snake continuously writhed and finally ceased moving.* Huff! Huff! Huff! *Murphy panted violently, \u201cLey\u2026 Leylin, thank you! I owe you my life!\u201d\u201cNo problem! You gave your support to me back then too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Leylin smiled as his gaze fixed on the huge snake, up until when the A.I. Chip\u2019s voice sounded, [Target has completely lost all signs of life] did he heave a sigh of relief.Under the detection of the A.I. Chip, although there were no more energy movements from the huge snake earlier, there was still a thermal response.Of course, many kinds of creatures must be dead for a while before all thermal signs completely vanish.However, because of that, Leylin was even more vigilant. \u00a0Besides, intentionally or accidentally, he led Murphy forward and finally verified whether the large snake was truly dead.\u201cWhat a pity! If this Mankestre snake were to die before, its other eye would have absolutely been valued over 1000 Magic Crystals, but right now, the value of the whole corpse is greatly reduced.\u201dLeylin was somewhat helpless at he looked to Murphy, who was at his side.\u201cAbout the attack earlier\u2014 you actually did not dodge it, which makes me rather surprised!\u201dAn unexpected flush reddened Murphy\u2019s cheeks, \u201cAfter using the rune shackles, my Spiritual Force and Magic Power are \u00a0greatly weakened. In this period, I am just another old geezer on the street\u2026.\u201dWith regards to Leylin, who saved him earlier, right now it could be said that Murphy trusted him greatly and actually even shared such a secret with him.\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s hurry and harvest the materials of this Mankestre snake, and then return to Extreme Night City!\u201dLeylin sized up the \u00a0chaotic scene. Leylin and the three of them had \u00a0absolutely no way to move those corpses on the ground, so they could only return back to Extreme Night City and ask people to retrieve these corpses.With the death of the huge Mankestre snake, this area should no longer pose a threat in future.\u201cHaha\u2026 This time Leylin, your contributions have been the most, so you should be allowed to harvest the best material!\u201d Murphy smiled.Concerning this matter, Leylin did not have any notions of killing Murphy and claiming all the loot for himself.Murphy did help him earlier, and on the other hand, right now Murphy and him were the only two acolytes left, so he would definitely monopolise a large portion of the resources, thus he did not have to take a risk and kill people.From the \u00a0whole Mankestre snake, the most valuable ingredient would be its \u00a0eyes, after which the remaining materials would only add up to a total of 1000 to 2000 Magic Crystals, which was not enough to bewitch Leylin yet.If right now there was some rare materials worth ten thousand Magic Crystals, who knew if Leylin would harbour some bad intentions.\u201cDecent scales, combined with \u00a0the snake skin, \u00a0should be able to produce many sets of soft armour.\u201d Leylin went forward and unsheathed his cross blade, before dissecting the huge snake. Murphy too helped by his side.After a moment of being busy, Leylin and Murphy had harvested some of the more valuable portions of the huge snake. As for the remaining items, they \u00a0could only be transported with help from the city lord\u2019s castle.\u2026\u2026* Gu Lu Lu * The axles of the carriage resounded continuously, and Viscount Jackson opened his eyes.\u201cI am\u2026still alive?\u201d What entered his vision was a sky filled with resplendent starlight, and he felt his body rising and falling \u00a0in accordance with the movements of the horse carriage.Viscount Jackson discovered that his chest was already bandaged, and a refreshing feeling dispersed the pain, which showed that the healing process was extremely professional.\u201cWho was it that saved me?\u201d A doubt crossed Viscount Jackson\u2019s mind, and he tried hard to untangle his thoughts.\u201cCity Lord! You are finally awake!\u201d A face with a white beard and white eyebrows appeared in front of Viscount Jackson.\u201cHow is it? Do you still retain your memories?\u201d Murphy shook his finger in front of Viscount Jackson.\u201cWas it you who saved me? How are the others?\u201d Viscount Jackson struggled to speak, and his voice sounded hoarse, like a ruined bellow.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, but Leylin who saved you!\u201d Murphy pointed at Leylin who was driving, \u201cWe three are the only survivors of the whole group\u2026 After exiting the woods, it took me a while to obtain this spacious horse carriage\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all dead?\u201d Viscount Jackson flung his head to the side and an unexplainable sorrow welled from the bottom of his heart.\u201cLord Viscount! It seems like you are alright now!\u201d Leylin turned back, and tossed a green bottled potion, \u201cThis is a healing potion, I hope it will be of use to you!\u201dMurphy caught it, and fed it into the mouth of Viscount Jackson.After taking the potion, Viscount Jackson only felt a hot wave surging through his four limbs, and he finally regained some energy from it.\u201cTowards Leylin\u2019s generosity and grace of saving my life, I will definitely repay you when we return!\u201d\u201cIf possible, please give me all of the Hove Violet Leaves in the castle. That would be the greatest recompense!\u201d Leylin raised his request without a tinge of restraint.\u201cOf course!\u201d Jackson was stunned, before immediately agreeing.With the advance of the horse carriage, the silhouette of Extreme Night City gradually appeared.A few soldiers were still guarding the post, scrutinising the people that came and went.\u2026\u2026Jackson looked at the distant scene, and his eyes quivered, and finally two streams of tears flowed\u2026.The city lord\u2019s castle\u2019s reconnoiter group had perished completely. Even news of Viscount Jackson, as a Grand Knight, having been seriously injured had spread and immediately caused an uproar in Extreme Night City.Even after two days, the news did not die down. Instead, it even spread throughout the area,As the city lord of Extreme Night City, Viscount Jackson always used his status as a Grand Knight to suppress many dark factions. However, when the news of him being injured spread, it caused several ripples and undercurrents inside the city.At this moment, the strength of the city castle was waning, even the few acolytes who were friendly towards Viscount Jackson had died. Jackson who was nurturing his grief had to face with all these, and was rather overwhelmed by all these.Leylin who stayed in the villa outside the city heard some of the news.However, \u00a0since he had returned from the venture, he always holed himself in the experiment lab, and even refused many invitations from the city lord\u2019s castle and other factions.Under the bright light, Leylin stared; his eyes fixated on a petri-dish.On the surface of the glass petri-dish, a small red lump of flesh continuously swelled, and from it grew many tentacles.Leylin picked up another pipette, and placed a drop of the yellow potion on the lump of meat.* Sssii! * The meat dissolved, and turned into a puddle of crimson-red with yellowish blood fluid.\u201cI have finally managed to purify it, the primordial blood essence of the huge snake!\u201d Leylin looked at the petri-dish, as if seeing the most precious treasure in this world.\u201cA.I. Chip! Scan composition!\u201d[Beep! Mission establishing, scanning in progress\u2026][The list of genes has been generated, comparing to database\u2026.]\u201c99.8%\u2026\u2026\u201d[Beep! Similarity of the blood essence with a normal huge python: 99.8%! Determined as the blood essence of original huge pythons! After remodelling in the later stage, there were new types of genes\u2026]The A.I. Chip continuously reported the conclusions, and even projected the list of genes in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.From the multicoloured image, the blood essence of the huge Mankestre snake that Leylin saw earlier was actually the same with regular huge pythons.\u201cIndeed! This huge python is the result of an experiment by magicians!\u201d Leylin nodded his head. He still remembered clearly that after the A.I. Chip had scanned the huge python, it had added the words half-adult to its name.However, if not for the accuracy of the A.I. Chip down to the atomic level, Leylin would never unravel the secret behind it. Even other magicians would not be able to realise the difference.\u201cTwo more days, and that area should be calm again!\u201dLeylin informed his subordinates that he was going to undergo a very long duration of experimentation and that they are not to bother him with any matters and then he secretly left the villa.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayVestige TracesThe night was dark, and there was tranquility. Dried up old trees littered the surroundings, and on the branches, there were ravens ruffling their feathers.* Bang! *The grass patch below the tree tore open, revealing a dark passage beneath it.Leylin was draped in black robes, and his face was veiled. One would not be able to see his face.The nearby villa was still lit with lanterns, and the patrolling mercenaries did not know that their master had already left the villa.In Leylin\u2019s experiment lab, there was a direct passage which Leylin set up himself, with no one being the wiser.\u201cSince that huge Mankestre snake is an experimental body, there should be some experiment labs nearby from magicians! Moreover, that huge Mankestre snake had actually occupied Dark Night Woods for a few years, and not one magician had stepped forward to deal with it. There could only be one reason for that!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cThat experiment lab is most likely abandoned! The magician in it, due to some circumstances, could no longer look after it, or is most likely dead! That is why the huge snake could escape from it!\u201dFor magicians, seeking ancient vestiges had always been in their best interests.The remnants left by ancient Magi, such as official Magi experiment labs, would often contain many valuable data and ingredients, high levelled research, spells and Magic Artifacts with immense might. These were all items that magicians always sought after.Rumour had it that more often than not, there were examples of acolytes who were lacking having stumbled upon ancient remnants, and beginning to wield tremendous power after that.Of course, there were failed ventures and explorations where they finally died under the ancient mechanisms or curses from the corpses.However, for magicians, searching for vestiges was still a very beneficial thing to do.From an experiment lab which could create a half-adult huge Mankestre snake, any one item in it could let Leylin immediately get rich quickly, and even obtain more precious ingredients and knowledge to pave the way for him to advance into an official Magus in future.\u201cSince I have already found some traces, I will definitely have a look at the experiment lab!\u201dLeylin\u2019s gaze was determined. He was not afraid of risks, especially when the benefits strongly outweigh the risks.For this venture, he had specially prepared many items, which were enough measures to counter against any sudden developments.As for his subordinates? Not only were they easily susceptible to divulging news, but under the traps set up by official Magi, even Knights were only an existence slightly greater than ants. They were completely of no use, hence Leylin even kept his departure from them.Leylin journeyed for several nights in a row. Since there were no people around, he could use many of his methods.He splashed a green potion onto the ground, bringing about a ball of green coloured wind particles, which wrapped Leylin\u2019s body within them. His whole body seemed to turn into a breeze, and disappeared into the night.What Leylin used was a hastening potion which he had formulated throughout the years.As an outstanding Potions Master, no matter if it was using potions to journey or fight, he was entirely in his element.In the original passage, where Leylin and the others had battled the huge Mankestre snake.People had already been sent from the city lord\u2019s castle to retrieve the mutilated corpses and largely dissected huge Mankestre snake. What remained were many impressions on the ground, as well as traces of flames and frost, which spoke of the intense fight that had occurred previously.\u201cThe scenario from earlier has already been recorded down by the crystal ball given by the academy. To use that to signify the completion of mission is absolutely acceptable.\u201dFrom the battle previously, Leylin had used the crystal ball to record only most of the exploration mission, especially the corpse of the huge Mankestre snake at the end.With some ingredients from the corpse, as well as the record from the crystal ball, it could be said that Leylin\u2019s mission in Extreme Night City was finally completed.However, he had no plans whatsoever to leave at all.Not mentioning whether the mess of a war that Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was entangled in at the moment already had a victor, Leylin did not want to go back during this period.He had just managed to formulate a modified formula for the Azure Potion. Now would be the best time to break through into a Level 3 Acolyte, so why would he risk going back to the academy and expose himself in the process?As for Extreme Night City, Leylin did not even see an official Magus, which put him at ease to carry out his experiments and breakthrough.Leylin would wait for a buffer of three years after the dust settled for the war of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. Although his advancement to a Level 3 Acolyte would still be fast that way, it would not be as eye catching!At that time, he could figure out an excuse, and cover his tracks easily.As for the corpses of the acolytes on the floor, naturally, they had already been inspected by Leylin. Back then, he had kept all the valuable items for himself before bringing the heavily injured Jackson and Murphy to leave the place.\u201cHowever, that group of acolytes were all paupers, and not a single one of them had more than 10 Magic Crystals! Only on that Half-Beast Man acolyte, there was still a frost smelted gold rune which can be considered to be rather good!\u201dLeylin grumbled in his mind, as he came to the centremost area of the cave.Under the light radiated by the Flash Jellyfish, the whole cave was extremely bright. Leylin could see that on the ground at the centre, traces of where the huge Mankestre snake was coiled were still apparent.\u201cIt actually managed to make such a deep impression, they are indeed of the same nature narrated by compendiums: an extremely lazy being.Leylin crouched and felt the earth that was sunken in.\u201cA.I. Chip! Record composition!\u201d[Recording completed, comparing to normal earth data in the databank. The target has 0.0005% of compound remnants, and is tentatively determined to contain Maike alloy!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.Maike alloy was a type of artificial metal, made by spells of magicians, that was extensively used to construct incubation pools in experiment labs.\u201cThis is right!\u201d Leylin eyes flashed with glee.\u201cA.I. Chip, is it possible to follow the tracks of the snake and find its original breeding area?[Scanning in progress! The target\u2019s data has been heavily covered by other creatures and is lacking in important information. Mission failed!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.Leylin scanned the surroundings. The ground was littered with claw marks from various creatures. Such was the devastation left by the parasitic abilities of the huge Mankestre snake.\u201cWhat a pity\u2026.\u201d Leylin shook his head.\u201cHowever, according to the habits of the huge Mankestre snake and the clues left by the other traces, that experiment lab should not be far off from here!\u201dLeylin commanded the A.I. Chip, \u201cA.I. Chip, scan every item in the surroundings!\u201d[Missions establishing, beginning imaging!]Along with the A.I. Chip intonation, the image of a blue coloured map was projected in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.In the centre was a huge cave, with many small tunnels in the near vicinity. Leylin even found a few parasitic bodies that had survived through sheer luck. However, it was unknown how much longer they could live for when the parent was dead.The map expanded until it finally reached the limit of its range.Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201c A.I. Chip, restart scan! Lower the precision to the lowest, and search in an extended perimeter! Begin running through a checklist of radioactive density!\u201dWith the command, the map in Leylin\u2019s eyes turned more out of focus. However, the perimeter extended, almost encompassing the nearby geography of the cave too.\u201cMaintain this area and precision!\u201dLeylin walked out of the cave and began running towards a direction. Following his movement, the edge of the map also continuously expanded\u2026.A few hours later, Leylin walked towards a large black granite boulder.\u201cThe surrounding areas have already been inspected. Although the radioactive densities are higher, this should be where the shedding of the huge Mankestre snake took place previously!\u201d\u201cAs for the only place with no radiation, but not within the scope of the A.I. Chip\u2019s scanning perimeter, this is the only place!\u201dLeylin looked at the large black granite boulder in front of him. This boulder was of the height of several humans, almost the size of a small mountain.In the map that the A.I. Chip scanned, this huge boulder had absolutely no traces of radiation. Even standing before it now, the A.I. Chip still did not detect anything.\u201cThis kind of scenario has happened several times back at the academy. It is due to the spell formations set by official Magi, which are interfering with the detection of the A.I. Chip!\u201dLeylin stroked the surface of the large black granite boulder. It was ice cold, damp, and had algae growing on it.\u201cHowever\u2026.What I must do to enter?\u201dLeylin exerted strength in his right arm and grabbed some of the rock powder.\u201cA.I. Chip! Analyse composition!\u201d[Beep! Mission establishing, in the process of gathering data\u2026.] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice continuously intoned, and a screen appeared in front of Leylin that was densely packed with the various data of the granite rock.\u201cIt seems like there are no differences between this and a normal granite rock!\u201d Leylin drew the data of normal granite rock and made a comparison. However, he finally had to acknowledge that the magician defended his secrets very well. Leylin had absolutely no way of finding the entrance to the experiment lab.\u201cHowever, since that huge Mankestre snake was able to come out, it means that the defense in the spell formation has some sort of problem. I just require more time to inspect\u2026.\u201dLeylin stroked his chin and began setting up a tent beside the granite rock.He decided to stay here for a long time in order to continuously detect any loopholes or weakness in the spell formation, hoping to find a way to enter.After all, there won\u2019t be anyone coming to the vicinity of the withering woods anymore, especially when the city lord\u2019s castle has sent people to retrieve the corpses of the acolytes, troops and the huge snake.After chewing on several biscuits that he brought along with him, Leylin began to analyse the spell formation on the large black granite boulder.Of course, he only dared do this as he was sure that the owner of the lab was already dead through his observations and conjectures. Who knew if that unknown magician had long since died a natural death.\u201cAfter having been here for so long, yet with no magicians coming out, the accuracy of this conjecture has yet been raised by 30%.Leylin stared at the large black granite boulder before him with a zealous expression contained within.\u201cIf I manage to dispel the spell formation, the items in there are all mine!\u201dFor Leylin, who was a Level 2 Acolyte, an experiment lab belonging to an official Magus was a huge treasure trove!\u201cOnly that\u2026 The traps set by official Magus are extremely dangerous. I must absolutely not be blinded by greed and fall into a trap!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the blink of an eye, Leylin had tarried beside the large black granite boulder for 5 days.In those five days, Leylin tried every method he knew on the large black granite boulder. He finally found a few loopholes he could exploit.Leylin already confirmed that the granite boulder had a spell formation set up within. But it was in a damaged state.According to the wear and tear, this formation had already been in effect for over a hundred years.The cause of this extensive damage might very well have had something to do with the huge Mankestre snake\u2019s escape earlier.\u201cSome portion of the magic spell formation has already been damaged by that snake. That\u2019s why there are detectable traces leaking out. Without those leaks, even with the A.I. Chip\u2019s assistance, finding this place would not have been easy.\u201dGlee spread across Leylin\u2019s face.Due to his experiments these past few days, he managed to assemble a set of spells that gave him a 70- 80% chance of opening the entrance to this experiment lab.The cyclical timing inherent to this spell formation meant that the damaged parts only appeared at certain times. Leylin needed to wait for this window of opportunity.The sun gradually set and the surrounding area became shrouded in darkness.Owing to the death of the huge Mankestre snake, the withering woods would eventually recover its former vitality. Unfortunately, this would require at least a hundred years. Right now, there was only that deathly suffocating silence permeating the withering woods, which would insidously choke anyone who dared enter.Leylin did not care a whit. Oblivious to the heavy atmosphere, he sought out a level rock and started brewing potions on it.Moonlight fell. Very soon the woods was enveloped in a layer of silver sheen. The full moon today was exceptionally bright. Curiously, there was a tinge of saffron tinting the moon.Leylin snapped open the pocket watch he brought with him, \u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight!\u201dHe rose and sauntered to the side of the large black granite boulder. As moonlight from the full moon shone on the surface of the granite rock, its black stone skin suddenly came off and revealed a network of blood vessels coalescing into a silvery archway. They pulsated continuously as if absorbing the moonlight.\u201cThis is it!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed. He quickly emptied the contents of the potions he just brewed onto the surface of the granite rock.* Sssii! * A large amount of white mist rose and corroded the surface of the rock, leaving the network of blood vessels in chaos.\u201cKaramanda\u2026.\u201d Leylin chanted the incantation softly. His voice sounded extremely depressed like the muttering of a jilted woman.In time with the chanting noises, the silvery network of veins settled and continued to combine, then finally turned into a circular passage.Seeing this, Leylin was elated. His chanting voice became more frenzied as he repeatedly tossed the few ingredients in his hands into the passageway.* Bang! * Along with Leylin\u2019s final chant, the large black granite boulder completed its shape change. Close to Leylin, the silvery archway earlier disappeared. Instead, the entrance to a dark tunnel materialized.\u201cA fake passageway actually got conjured!\u201d Leylin shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.At that instant, the eyes of the black raven perched on his shoulders, glinted with human intelligence.\u201cBy harnessing some of this spell\u2019s effect, I should be able to use this raven to break into the experiment lab in a short timeframe. Everything it sees would then be relayed into my right eye like a holographic projection!\u201dAs Leylin shut his right eye, the raven cocked its head lightly before giving a cry. Then, it directly flew into the dark tunnel.Many scenes flashed past Leylin\u2019s closed right eye.He felt like he was flying. The scenery below him were all relayed into his mind\u2019s eye.The passage was extremely short. In moments, the raven reached the other end.Leylin saw a small-sized villa appear in front of him. Its walls shimmered with spell light.Green coloured vines crawled and filled the wall. On it were some sort of red-coloured flowers with what looked like bone petals.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d Astonishment surfaced from the depths of the raven\u2019s eyes, \u201cDevil Vines? Bone Eating Flowers? I originally thought they were all extinct, but there are actually some in here!\u201dOn the villa\u2019s entrance was a jagged circular hole the size of Leylin\u2019s palm. Leylin surmised that this could be the spot the Mankestre snake broke through during its escape\u2013way back when it was but a youngling.Near the hole, a white skeleton draped in black robes lay on a grey-coloured stone platform!\u201cAccording to the way the skeleton is positioned, it was obviously an acolyte like me who accidentally stumbled upon this place. He tried to break into the villa and perished in this sorry state!\u201dLeylin\u2019s steeled his heart. He telepathically maneuvered the raven to alight beside the bones and let the bird pluck on it with its black claws.A crash resounded, a heap of items fell from the robes.A book, several yellow parchment paper, a heap of bottles, and a yellow bronze ring tumbled onto the floor. A \u2018K\u2019 symbol was inscribed on it.\u201cSeems to be some kind of identity verification!\u201d Leylin casually had the bird fiddle with the ring and peep at the book.After using the raven\u2019s feathers to clear the dust, a row of esoteric patterns and cursive handwriting emerged.\u201cThese characters\u2026? They seemed to be in Ancient Terrestrial Elven language! I have seen these before in the library!\u201dLeylin was stunned. He immediately began to decrypt the words, \u201cTerrestrials\u2026 Terrestrial Elves! Alchemist of the Terrestrial Elves, Torozar!\u201d\u201cIt is actually information pertaining to alchemy!\u201dLeylin was in ecstasy, \u201cIt was mentioned in the library\u2019s records that the Ancient Terrestrial Elves were renowned for their exquisite alchemy, as well as their enchanting capabilities! If I were to obtain these information, I may begin attempting some of the things recorded in the Lowian Academy Teachings\u2026.\u201dWith the A.I. Chip\u2019s overpowered calculation abilities, the Lowian Academy Teachings, which Leylin bought earlier, was already completely decrypted. Part of data was about a method for synthesizing a Magic Artifact.Of course, it was only a low-grade Magic Artifact. However, in Leylin\u2019s current state, this was a rather huge temptation.He, alas, spent most of his time on Potioneering and Magic studies, so he had next to no inkling whatsoever concerning Alchemy and Enchantment. Moreover, such high level information was always kept under rigorous control. Regular acolytes did not have the clearance to access them.Even if Leylin had a way to synthesize a Magic Artifact, it would still be extremely difficult.Luckily, with the Alchemy information material here and the simulation capability of his A.I. Chip, Leylin completely believed that he would be able to synthesize this Magic Artifact once he became a Level 3 Acolyte.\u201cBring this book out!\u201d Leylin was already thinking of retreating.To him, just knowing that within the granite walls was an abandoned experiment lab with degraded defenses made today\u2019s probe an extremely fruitful one. Obtaining advanced information on Alchemy was an unexpected bonus.The raven grabbed the book with its claws with much effort. As it turned around, it lightly brushed \u00a0the parchment paper. With a hissing sound, the ancient piece of paper disintegratedLeylin was stunned, \u201cHas it already eroded to this state?\u201d* Hehe! Haha! *Just as Leylin\u2019s raven was about to fly off with the book, the surrounding area reverberated with a child\u2019s ominous laughter.\u201cThe defence formation activated! Damn it, I only have two more minutes!\u201dThe black raven flapped its wings, preparing to rise and fly away.*Ka-cha! * The grey coloured platform split open, revealing a huge jaw serrated with razor sharp white teeth.In one ferocious snap, the raven was torn to pieces.* Pu! * On the surface of the giant black stone, Leylin crouched down and grabbed at his right eye with his hands.A wave of searing pain hit him. It felt like someone was digging out his eyeball directly from its socket.* Huff Huff Huff * panting heavily, Leylin slowly recovered a good while later.The muscles of his handsome face contorted and red veins could be seen filling the white of his right eye. \u00a0A blood vessel burst and drops of blood fell to the ground.\u201cMagic spell backlash!\u201d Leylin sucked in a lungful of cold air and withdrew a red potion from his sack. He unplugged it and began drinking its contents.Several moments later, Leylin stood up, feeling much better.\u201cCareless! I never thought that apart from the Devil Vines and Bone Eating Flower, there was even a Gnawing Slate.\u201dLeylin looked at the original position of the tunnel entrance. The surface of the huge black granite boulder remained smooth. The entrance seen earlier seemed to be merely an illusion.\u201cDevil Vines, Bone Eating Flower, Gnawing Slate, and other mechanisms. I cannot infiltrate in this place right now, what a pity\u2026.\u201dLeylin deduced this from the spells he had in his possession and the ingredients he owned.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that only after I advance into Level 3 Acolyte, will I be able to enter this experiment lab!\u201dLeylin concluded, \u201cAnyway, I now known the true location and its access protocols. Moreover, I have visually confirmed the presence of precious informative material regarding Alchemy inside. So this venture was not a complete waste of effort!\u201dRight now, the experiment lab was too dangerous for Leylin. He was not someone who got easily dazzled by greed. He decided to leave exploring this place to a later date and returned to the villa to cultivate.Leylin calmed down as he focused on resting and recuperating from the damage done to him by the spell earlier.He then went towards the tent area where stowed his things. He then erased all traces and tracks left by his recent activities.\u201cThis defence spell formation has lasted over a hundred years. There were almost no loopholes a random passerby could exploit. I only need to erase my tracks. Adding more defensive measures or illusory spells would be superfluous.\u201dHaving finished arranging everything, Leylin took a last glance at the black rock. Then, without the slightest bit of hesitation, he left.\u201cI have warned them before about the laboratory in the manor, so Anna and the others would not dare enter it. \u00a0If I can return undetected to my laboratory, I can keep what happened here a secret.\u201d\u201cConcerning Extreme Night City, Jackson only suffered some superficial injuries. He should be mostly have recovered by now after following my treatment. He is most likely pretending to be seriously injured to lure any turncoat and renegade from their snake holes!\u201d\u201cWhatever the case may be, matters regarding the city lord\u2019s castle are not my concern. I need not understand them. \u00a0When I get the promised Hove Violet Leaves, I will immediately begin brewing the potions needed to breakthrough into Level 3.\u201dTo Leylin, increasing his own power was all-consuming. Otherworldly influences and the sort were considered a waste of energy. Since he did not care about such things, he was also disinclined to paying attention to these matters.But if anyone dared to entertain the idea of harming him, he would kill them!As far as magicians were concerned, eradicating a few worldly powers or factions required almost no effort.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the blink of an eye, a few months passed, and it was autumn.In the small villa, Leylin swirled a tastefully refreshing iced grape juice in a wine glass.He was attired in a leisurely frivolous apparel favoured by nobles and looked quite lackadaisical.\u201cA.I. Chip! Bring up my current stats!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 2 Acolyte, Knight. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 3.3, Vitality: 3.2, Spiritual Force: 7.1, Magical Power: 7 \u2013 (Magical Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force). Status: Healthy]\u201cI have finally reached the 7 Spiritual Force bottleneck!\u201d Leylin sighed as he looked at the data.After getting back from his solo exploration several months ago, Leylin got busy brewing potions to breakthrough the Spiritual Force bottleneck.Viscount Jackson had expeditiously sent over a warehouse full of Hove Violet Leaves. At the same time, Fraser and the others continued to purchase ingredients found elsewhere as per Leylin\u2019s standing orders.Sadly, the modified Azure Potion\u2019s brewing success rate was on the low side while consumption of Hove Violet Leaves was outrageously high. On top of that, Leylin could only take in the potion during the most optimal times recommended by the A.I. Chip for maximum medicinal effect. It was only now that he reached a Spiritual Force of 7.\u201cYoung Master! Fraser\u2019s back!\u201dOn the other side of the door Anna wore a black gauze ensemble that showed off her alluring curves beneath the fine muslin, especially her snow white thighs which was seductively enclosed in black fishnet stockings.Right now she acted as Leylin\u2019s chief aide, at the same time she had control over the finances, which could be considered as having high authority. However, in the presence of Leylin she was as gentle and as obedient as a little pussycat.\u201cLet\u2019s go! I\u2019ll go meet him!\u201dLeylin got up and left the room, his leather shoes gave off a thudding noise on the floorboard with each step.\u201cYoung Master!\u2019 Upon seeing Leylin\u2019s arrival, two maids hurriedly curtsied.\u201cEn?\u201d Leylin suddenly walked in front of a maid. She had snow white thighs and perky breasts, but right now her head was lowered and she dared not move.\u201cYou\u2019re new here?\u201d Leylin caressed her smooth chin. Her face still had some residual baby fat on it making her look extremely adorable.\u201cYes\u2026 Yes, I am Trixy, the daughter of Luke who works in your farm ranch milord!\u201d The maid replied softly did not dare reject Leylin\u2019s teasing.\u201cWork hard!\u201d Leylin waved his hands as he left.\u201cThat maid earlier should now be very agitated huh?\u201d Leylin slowly rubbed his fingers against each other as he revealed a mischievous smirk.Ever since he had been transported to this world, because he occupied the body of a youth, he realised that his attitude was reverting more and more towards one befitting the host\u2019s age. During emergencies or crises, it was not obvious. But now that he was in safe haven, he could not help but have some notions of tomfoolery.He expunged the expression on his face as he strolled to the warehouse. He was once again the great and stern magician lord.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Fraser stated as he half knelt on the ground. \u201cYour subordinate, I have collected another 20 pounds of Hove Violet Leaves from Austere Winter City. They have all been stored inside the warehouse!\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201d Leylin walked to the warehouse, and took a look at the amount and quality of the Hove Violet Leaves.Amongst the whole pile, the only ones that could be used for potion brewing were those whose central stems were thinner than the stalk of an oat. The amount of Spiritual Force an Azure Potion provided remained considerable enough to justify Leylin\u2019s continued use, despite the increasingly high resistance towards the potion he was developing.The bizarre purple leaves filled half of the warehouse. There was a strange scent permeating the air, a rather stinging sulfuric pungence.Leylin casually picked up a purple leave, \u201cA.I. Chip, detect properties!\u201d[Beep! Gathering data!]After a brief pause, the various properties of the Hove Violet Leaves were projected onto Leylin\u2019s visual field. The chemistry, the medicinal properties\u2014 even the smidgen of various residue from other items on the surface of the leaf\u2014 all projected by the A.I. Chip.\u201cBased on this inspection, this batch of Hove Violet Leaves will still do!\u201d Leylin nodded his head.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Fraser lips moved, yet he did not speak.\u201cSay what you want to say!\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cAll the Hove Violet Leaves in Extreme Night City have now been purchased by us. What remains are those of poor quality. In fact, Greem and I have already seen a number of counterfeit batches from traders who wished to hoodwink us.\u201cIndeed, Hove Violet Leaves are a special product only found in Eastwood Province. They take at least a year to grow!\u201dLeylin stroked his chin, and estimated the amount of Hove Violet Leaves in the warehouse.\u201cPut our purchasing drive on hold until next year\u2019s Hove Violet Leaves hit the markets. We can then resume buying them again!\u201dFrom this recent batch of Hove Violet Leaves, Leylin discovered that the quality was getting poorer and poorer. Some could not even be used for potion brewing.Indeed, it seems like he purchased quite a huge chunk of the total Hove Violet Leaf production in this area.The ingredients in the warehouse should be enough to meet my requirements for manufacturing enough potions to get to Level 3 Acolyte. As for official Magus, it is not something that I can consider right now.Leylin entered into deep thought. Right now his Spiritual Force has already reached 7. He has long since brewed the Reactive Elixirs. Advancing to Level 3 Acolyte no longer posed any problem for him at all.However, Leylin still knew nothing about how to advance to official Magus from Level 3 Acolyte. Even though Leylin was authorized to access the academy\u2019s library, he had not found any hint of the process.It seemed like the academy had forbidden all information pertaining to this topic.\u201cWhether the academy or the market, I have always paid special attention to information related to official Magus. Until now, I could not even unearth a single clue.This was also why Leylin was hesitant about leaving Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.The higher ups in the Magus World kept a tight lid on all information regarding how to advance to official Magus. More so for Leylin, who became an acolyte from afar. He had to fulfil certain requirements and run errands before he would be granted a peek at the advancement methods to study them.\u201cThis is something out of my control. Maybe the Magus experiment lab has something that I can profit from?\u201dLeylin thought again of the Magus experiment lab concealed near the withering woods.After his previous stint there, he could already confirm that the person who left the experiment lab was an official Magus. Moreover, it had been forsaken for a long time already.This was a piece of good news.He only needed to be rid of all the spell formations laid on the experiment lab. Then, everything in it would be his, including the unlucky magician\u2019s items lying just outside the door.\u201cLevel 3! I only need to advance to Level 3 Acolyte, and imbue another set of Rank 0 spells so I can depart!\u201dLeylin made up his mind.\u2026\u2026In a small secret lab with an extremely simple layout, there weren\u2019t many household items, only a wooden bed in the middle.Leylin sat cross-legged atop the bed. Before his impassive face was a tangerine-yellow potion.He was prepared and determined to breakthrough to Level 3 Acolyte.He did not breathe a word of this to anyone. Like before, he informed Anna that he was just going to carry out an experiment. No matter what happened, he didn\u2019t want any interruptions.It was not that he couldn\u2019t trust his subordinates but they had neither the strength nor the ability to render aid if anything untoward happened. They wouldn\u2019t be of much use so he might as well hide the fact that he was attempting to breakthrough.After all, he \u2018disappeared\u2019 from the villa from time to time. His manor staff had gotten inured to it by now.Once he had accomplished what he set out to do, when he next appeared before his people, everything would have been\u00a0fait accompli.Although there might not be any prying eyes or ears, especially any spies sent by his adversaries, he was conscientious of the possibility.\u201cLevel 3 Acolyte, the final step before official Magus. For first grade and second grade acolytes, Level 3 has always been hailed the peak of cultivation.A Level 1 Acolyte could merely use energy particles, but could not cast any spells yet. Their fighting strength was roughly equivalent to a Knight\u2019s. As for Level 2 Acolytes, they were able to cast some Rank 0 spells. Though these were simple ones, it bolstered their battle abilities to such an extent that they surpassed the Knights.Level 3 Acolytes, on the other hand, had exponentially greater Spiritual Force than regular humans. They had a more profound understanding of spell theory and its uses in combat. They were masters of techniques like instantaneous casting, which enabled extremely rapid casting of prepared spells. Even Grand Knights were not their opponents.Moreover, Level 3 Acolyte had always been considered the preparatory stage to becoming an official Magus. The faster one advances as a Level 3 Acolyte, the higher chances of eventually becoming an official Magus.Among Magus academies and factions, the number of official Magi was extremely small. Level 3 Acolytes were universally considered the backbone of any academy\u2019s or faction\u2019s battle strength!Any young Level 3 Acolyte was counted as a valuable asset of the academy. These institutions were inclined towards dedicating resources to nurture them, hoping that these seeds would advance beyond Level 3 Acolyte in the future.\u201cBreaking through Level 3 Acolyte requires mastery of two spell models, a Spiritual Force of 7, and the aid of Reactive Elixirs!\u201dLeylin picked up the tangerine-yellow potion before him.\u201cI have long since gotten both the elixir and the requisite spell mastery. Now, with the help of the Azure Potion, I have also met the Spiritual Force requirements, all within a few months. This speed has long since surpassed Jayden\u2019s aptitude. A fifth grade acolyte!\u201dEven if they were genius acolytes of the fifth grade, before the huge gulf between Level 2 Acolyte and Level 3 Acolyte, 3 years would be the minimum they would spend getting there.However, after obtaining the potion, Leylin\u2019s speed had long since surpassed that of Jayden and the rest. In no time at all, he had reached the standard required to advance to be a Level 3 Acolyte.\u201cAs long as my Spiritual Force gets enhanced, even if the breakthrough fails, I can always make another attempt. My body would suffer some major damage though, so being successful in one go is for the best!\u201dFor the final time, Leylin mentally reviewed all information regarding advancement to a Level 3 Acolyte. After confirming that he had not left anything out, he popped the cork keeping the tangerine-yellow potion securely plugged.\u201cThis Reactive Elixir is not meant to be drunk!\u201dLeylin undressed and smeared the Reactive Elixir over his face, limbs and chest.The potion felt rather cool wherever he smeared it. However, after a few moments, a wave of heat gradually coursed through his skin. In an instant, his skin started to shudder and turn beet red.[The Reactive Elixir is taking effect, medicinal properties under surveillance!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.As the potion continued to take effect, Leylin felt as if the potion coating his skin had come alive and was worming its way through his pores and into his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An extremely itching sensation was coursing through his body at this moment.\u201cDamn it! And I actually have to enter a deep meditative state under this condition and remodel the mind runes.\u201dLeylin\u2019s face turned red. He clenched his teeth and resisted the urge to scratch his body as he closed his eyes.Due to the adverse yet intense effect on his body, Leylin spent several more times longer to enter a meditative state.Inside the meditation, Leylin seemed to have come to a place.The surroundings were a grayish blur. Up in the air, there were many lights which seemed like stars, illuminating this place.Leylin lifted his head. In the air were 24 mysterious runes\u2014 glowing with a fluorescent light\u2014 which gathered to form a circle.These were the mind runes that he had painstakingly constructed during the past few years.Although these mind runes were all constructed through various special means, each and every one of the construction required a huge amount of effort and time. Previously, Leylin had spent more than a year before he could finally construct them in his mind.\u201cThe mind runes of a Level 2 Acolyte cannot be considered to have fully consolidated. A Level 3 Acolyte has to integrate the mind runes together based on the foundation set in Level 2 Acolyte. Moreover, there needs to be a reinforcement of the sea of consciousness!\u201dLeylin was extremely curious towards that state too.Right now, he was in a completely \u2018conscious\u2019 state. The sea of consciousness did not appear in any parts of his body. At least, the A.I. Chip had already used a microscopic scan at the atomic level on his body but yet could not find anything.\u201cThe cultivation of Magi Spiritual Force, may very well have crossed over into the aspect of souls!\u201dLeylin let out a sigh from the bottom of his heart. And at this moment, the sea of consciousness had a phenomenon.A layer of tangerine-yellow light continuously permeated over the blurry, grayish mist. Not long after, the whole of the sea of consciousness turned into a bright tangerine-yellow.\u201cThis is the effect of the Reactive Elixir! It was only with a potion that can be smeared on the body, and I also know of the ingredients it is made up of, but that it can actually affect my sea of consciousness, that is really mysterious\u2026.\u201dBefore Leylin could gasp again, the tangerine-yellow light immediately rushed up into the sky, as if it wanted to dye the 24 mind runes into a tangerine-yellow colour too.* Bang! *The mind runes let off a glow and rejected the contamination of a foreign object, A huge force of impact travelled over. Leylin\u2019s vision darkened, and he almost fainted.\u201cSuppress it!\u201d Leylin hurriedly borrowed the strength of his Spiritual Force, to suppress the resistance of the mind runes.* Pop! *Towards the mind runes that he constructed, Leylin\u2019s mastery over them was not little. A few seconds later, the 24 mind runes all stopped resisting, and they were dyed a tangerine-yellowUnder the contamination of the light, the many mysterious patterns appeared on the surface of the mind runes.These patterns continuously kept extending till they had completely covered the surface of all the mind runes.* Bang! * The 24 mind runes finally stuck together, forming into an even greater rune.In Leylin\u2019s sea of consciousness, many patterns also appeared. And after the presence of these patterns, the sea of consciousness turned even more resplendent and transparent, as if it were being reinforced.After the reinforcement, as if listening to some command, the tangerine-yellow light hurriedly retreated, immediately vanishing in the sea of consciousness.The large mysterious rune let off a glow, and Leylin\u2019s consciousness was pushed out from it.\u201cWhere is this place?\u201dLeylin grew confused; suddenly releasing that he was in a mysterious place. The area was pitch-black, with no light whatsoever.He wanted to reach out, but there was no concept of \u201chands\u201d as if he never had any hands before.In this manner, he floated in the air with no concept of time, yet he couldn\u2019t move.To Leylin, in this space, every minute was like a dozen years.This feeling could completely drive a sane person over the cliff.Leylin was somewhat frustrated, \u201cHaven\u2019t I advanced into a Level 3 Acolyte yet? Why would I come to this space? How long has the time passed?\u201dSuddenly, Leylin\u2019s heart jumped, \u201cA.I. Chip!\u201d[Beep!] A bright blue screen was projected in front of Leylin and although it could not illuminate the darkness, still it made him feel much better.[Scans have picked up that the Host\u2019s Spiritual Force is in an abnormal state. Under this circumstance, the Host will fail the breakthrough to a Level 3 Acolyte in 5 Minutes 23 Seconds! 13 Hours 45 Minutes later, due to the failure of all organs death will ensue! Whether to use Magic Power to get rid of the status? Yes/No?]\u201cYes!\u201d Right now Leylin completely did not feel any Magic Power left in his body, but the A.I. Chip could still circulate it, which made him elated.[Obtained Host\u2019s confirmation and now transferring Magic Power. In the process of getting rid of the abnormal status\u2026.] Along with the A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intonation, there was suddenly a strange movement in the pitch-black space.Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed open. He realised that he was still in the secret lab and that not much time had passed since he began.\u201cDuring the advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte, there are actually such strange scenarios!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression was solemn. His degree of progress was too quick, most of his knowledge had been obtained from the library and also from the simulations and conjectures of the A.I. Chip.He had no info about some scenarios of advancing into Level 3 Acolyte.\u201cNormally speaking, when many Level 2 Acolytes\u00a0are in the midst of advancing, they all have their Professors to explain in detail to them\u2026 but I\u2019m unfortunate! Even Professor Kroft wouldn\u2019t have expected that I would face a breakthrough this quickly!\u201dLeylin held onto many secrets and would never tell the truth. In Kroft\u2019s eyes, he was just a newly advanced Level 2 Acolyte, so why would he tell him about some notes to pay attention regarding the advancement to a Level 3 Acolyte?Furthermore, the books in the library were available commonly. Many things in it had vague explanations. Even if Leylin had the A.I. Chip and was able to erase the false information, together with his experiments, he wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain the perfect results.This caused Leylin to encounter a phenomenon that occurred during his advancement and he was at a complete loss.\u201cLuckily I had the A.I. Chip this time, if not I will be finished! The road \u00a0to becoming a Magus is indeed very precarious!\u201dThere was some lingering fear in Leylin\u2019s heart.But this, too, confirmed his deductions. The A.I. Chip had been with him when he was transported and for some unknown reason, it had merged into his soul.Hence, when his soul met with an abnormality and was isolated and without help, he could still activate the A.I. Chip to get rid of the inner influences from the outside.\u201cSo, advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte is not about the combination of the mind runes nor reinforcing the sea of consciousness, but about the space of darkness that comes after!\u201dLeylin suddenly understood much more. All these were usually precious information secrets that were not announced by professors or the academy, many factionless acolytes usually died during this aspect.[Beep! The Host\u2019s Spiritual Force has some change and is more lively. The Host has advanced into a Level 3 Acolyte! Spiritual Force increasing\u2026.] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.Following which, Leylin felt dizzy, and his Spiritual Force increased at a rapid speed.7.27.37.5\u2026\u20269.710.1The Spiritual Force which seemed to ride on a rocket had continuously increased. When the final number jumped, it turned into 10.1, and finally stabilising itself.\u201cMy head hurts!\u201dWith the sudden increase of the Spiritual Force, right now Leylin\u2019s body could still not adapt to the change. He had a runny nose and when he touched the area, he realised that he was bleeding from his nostrils!\u201cThe increase in Spiritual Force is too fast, and the body could not take it!\u201dLeylin smiled wryly but very soon his expression changed and cracking noises came from within his body. At the same time, intense pain travelled from all parts of his body continuously.Leylin\u2019s facial muscles contorted and he fell flat on the bed, like a shrivelled up shrimp.\u201cDamn it! Damn it! The Reactive Elixir\u2019s effect is up and the backlash from the potion has started!\u201dLeylin howled, \u201cA.I. Chip! Begin to coordinate with the Magic Power and get rid of the remnants from the elixir!\u201dA layer of a grayish-black halo of light appeared and floated on his body, enveloping his whole body. Along with the flickering of the halo, much of the yellowish-black pus was expunged from Leylin\u2019s pores, releasing a very acute stench.A dozen minutes later, Leylin struggled to get up. He took out a red-coloured potion from the bag lying beside him and drank it fully before his expression changed for the better.At this moment his body was drenched in sweat and pus, bringing about an acidic stench, as if he had just been scooped out from the sewers.Leylin tried to pick himself up. His face was pale stricken and he was weak in the knees. His eyes were sunk in as if having been bedridden with an illness for many months.After pushing open the door of the secret lab, Leylin jingled the bell placed beside the door.* Ding Ling Ling! *A crisp yet penetrating sound rang, and it travelled far after a while.\u201cYoung Master! You\u2026\u201d A few minutes later, Anna brought two maids as she rushed over. It seemed like Leylin\u2019s lips were covered by his hands.\u201cIt\u2019s fine! Send me to the bathroom! I wish to take a shower!\u201d\u201cDo you want me to call the herbalist or doctor over?\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d\u2026\u2026Half an hour later, Leylin lay in a pool that was constructed from marble. The warm water flowed over his body, bringing away the dirt and grime from him.Anna was buck-naked as she nestled up against Leylin. She used a white towel to scrub his body.\u201cMi\u2026.Milord! Your deer blood soup and steak!\u201dOn the other side, Trixy too was stark naked, and her delightful curves were all exposed in front of Leylin eyes. She blushed, as she carried a propped up tray over.The ray was made of wood and floated on the pool. Leylin picked up his utensils and ate voraciously.Some time later, Leylin wore a loose bathrobe and reclined on a nearby chair. His back leaned against Anna\u2019s chest and enjoyed the sensational perky abundance.And at his side, Trixy and another beautiful were giving a massage to Leylin.They had only donned some clothes, which were smaller than a palm. The private areas weren\u2019t covered, only faintly discernible at times. This made it even more embarrassing yet alluring.Trixy and the other maid were only daughters of farmers and they had toiled in the farms since they were young. They had a layer of calluses on their hands even. However, they were extremely young and their slender figures were beautiful. Their bodies radiated the vibrancy of youthfulness. Compared to Anna, it was a kind of wild flavour.However, right now Leylin completely did not have any interest to engage in an intense bout with them. Instead, he felt somewhat traumatic about the advancement today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chip! Bring forth my current stats!\u201d Leylin commanded inwardly.[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 3 Acolyte. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 3.3, Vitality: 3.5, Spiritual Force: 10.1, Magical Power: 10 \u2013 (Magical Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force). Status: Healthy]The A.I. Chip projected the data in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes. Apart from him, nobody else could see it.Leylin closed his eyes, yet his mind was rapidly processing and thinking.\u201cEn! My Vitality has increased by 0.3, which should be related to the use of the Reactive Elixir. Also, not only did my Spiritual Force increase to 10.1, I can feel that my Spiritual Force is brimming with more energy as compared to before. My perception towards energy particles in the air has increased too, so casting Rank 0 spells should now be easier!\u201d\u201cThe realm of a Level 3 Acolyte is indeed not something a Level 2 Acolyte can compare to. However, the process of advancing is too perilous!\u201dLeylin put on an expression of lingering fear. No matter if it was his consciousness being trapped in the black space, or the backlash from the Reactive Elixir, they were all developments which he had not expected.To Leylin, all the data and information he had garnered was still too little. Although the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculation abilities were extremely tremendous, if the basic information was not there, being able to simulate the correct advancement technique was already considered to be not bad.As for the setback met during the advancement, due to the various differences in Vitality between people adding on to the shortage of information, even the A.I. Chip was unable to predict them.\u201cAfter all, in the library that Abyssal Bone Forest Academy opened for its students, much information had been restricted. Some high levelled information was not even released to be read by the acolytes!\u201d\u201cAlso, even if the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculation abilities are comparable to 10 supercomputers, the Magus World has, at least, tens of thousands of years of history. With all of the hundreds of thousands of acolytes experiments, the results and models will surpass the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculation abilities!\u201d\u201cThe advancement, this time, was indeed rather lucky, and luck played an important factor in it!\u201dLeylin\u2019s face turn solemn, \u201cI cannot go on like this next time! This is only for advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte! In the future, when I advance into an official Magus, I won\u2019t be so lucky if something like this happens again!\u201dThe difficulty of the advancement from a Level 3 Acolyte to an official Magus far exceeded that of advancing from a regular human to a Level 3 Acolyte,And if at that time there were some mistakes or oversights due to negligence, even if Leylin had a few lives, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to save him.\u201cAfter returning, I must inquire greatly about all the details pertaining to advancement into an official Magus, and not try to break through blindly again!\u201dLeylin gave himself this mission for the future.\u201cWhat\u2019s next is to wait until my body has adapted to the sudden increase in Spiritual Force, and muster the few Rank 0 spells that only Level 3 Acolytes can learn, then go back to reexamine that lab!\u201dLeylin opened his eyes and sent Anna and the other two maids away. After setting up a circle of warning with a spell formation, he dragged his weary body onto the bed on the other side and entered into slumber.\u2026\u2026In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed like that.Night and the splendor of moonlight shone upon the ground. It was another full moon night.Nearby the withering woods, beside that same large black granite boulder, Leylin muttered an incantation and repeated the same procedure as before.Seeing the same dark hole of the cave, Leylin smiled and walked in.After the observation of his previous exploration, he had already roughly understood the rules that were governing the spell formation. Moreover, he recorded all the danger inside there and had a way to counter them.Furthermore, he had already advanced to a Level 3 Acolyte and had more confidence to break the defensive mechanisms laid by the unknown Magus.The black tunnel passage was very short, and the surface was extremely shiny, reflecting Leylin\u2019s black robed figure. It was even projected at multiple angles on the wall behind Leylin.The villa that Leylin had seen previously was at the back of the tunnel. The Devil Vines and Bone Eating Flowers still littered the floor. There were even grey slates on the floor, and within it resided the Gnawing Slate.On the door of the villa, there was a circular hole. At the side of it was a corpse and a black diary which brought lustre lay beside the corpse. Seeing this book that had records of Alchemy, Leylin\u2019s heart began to palpitate faster.In Leylin\u2019s eyes, the exterior of the villa was set up with a dangerous halo of light coming from magic spells, and it was unknown how many traps were concealed under the brilliant light.* Hehe! Haha! *Just as Leylin\u2019s right foot stepped on the stone slate, a childish laughter sounded. The slates on the floor twisted open and revealed a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth, snapping viciously at Leylin!\u201cThe first defense! Gnawing Slate!\u201d Leylin smiled and tossed a gob of black stuff into the huge mouth.* Ka-Cha! * The huge mouth gobbled up the black mass.* Pu! * The grey mouth chewed, and immediately spit the black residue out. A red tongue continuously flickered outwards, and spat a yellowish green spittle.This scene looked very much like a regular human eating something disgusting and spitting it out.\u201cWith Stinky Stench Flower, Faeces Carapace Mantis, and the Rotten Stemmed Grass as the components of this vomiting powder! It is indeed the bane of the Gnawing Slate!\u201d Leylin looked at the grey slate vomiting again, which immediately grew two small legs as it ran away, and the sight made Leylin laugh.\u201cTo the unknown Magus, this should be a temporary lab since the spell leaned towards concealment. As for its resistance, there should only be 3 layers! Moreover, using the Gnawing Slate, Devil Vines and Bone Eating Flowers combination, this is the trademark defensive measures of the Michael School of Thought!\u201dLeylin walked towards the front door, and immediately grabbed the black diary with his hands.It was extremely heavy, and carrying it felt like carrying a brick. It was probably made with special materials.Leylin kept the diary in his robes and walked towards the large door.A layer of blackish green vine immediately wrapped around the door, and on it, many red petals bloomed. The petals assembled, and actually formed the face of a female.\u201cIntruder! This is somewhere that you shouldn\u2019t have come!\u201d The petals formed the opening and closing of the lips as the female talked.\u201cThe Magus in there is already dead, I will inherit his fortune! As for you, I will keep your existence alive, and give you all the nourishment you require for evolving, how is it?\u201dLeylin took a red coloured fruit from his sack, \u201cTo you, the whole experiment lab cannot even be compared with this ingredient in my hand!\u201d\u201cWith it, you may even leave in the future, and regain your freedom, returning back to the woods where you came from\u2026.\u201d Leylin spoke softly, with a tinge of beguilement.\u201cFreedom!\u201d Hesitation and contemplations streaked across the woman\u2019s face.\u201cI cannot betray the promise from before! Outsider, please leave!\u201d The woman struggled, but she still rejected Leylin\u2019s proposition. A green vine continuously writhed, as if it would strike anytime.\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201d Leylin returned the fruit to his sack and sighed, \u201cI thought that I wouldn\u2019t have to strike!\u201d\u201cStubborn intruder, only death will be your ending!\u201dThe Bone Eating Flower howled, this time changing into the face of a male, and many black vines immediately came lashing forward.* Bang! * The black shadow charged forward, and Leylin ducked with his body. The thick vines slapped the floor, and the stone pieces flew in the air, revealing a huge pit.\u201cDon\u2019t be so impulsive, what if you damage the experiment lab?\u201dA layer of green light flew into the vine in the air, turning into a ball of light, and enveloped the flower and vine completely. The vine\u2019s attack speed decreased.Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed and he took out a black powder from his sack, before sprinkling it all over the ground.Moreover, as he scattered the powder, Leylin hurriedly chanted an incantation.\u201cIntruder! Die!\u201d The human face formed by flower petals roared, and continuously changed, sometimes it was the voice of a male, and sometimes it had the face of a female.* Bang! Bang! Bang! *The blackish green vines were continuously brandished and hit many holes in the surrounding walls of the cave.Leylin relied on the stats of a Knight to dodge, and his incantation never stopped.Finally, after Leylin ran around the villa, the surrounding was already scattered with the black powder.At this moment, the chanting stopped. Leylin pointed a finger at the human face, \u201cGo to hell! Cloud of Afterlife!\u201d* Boom! *The black powder continuously dissolved, turning into a gaseous body, and formed into an ominous black cloud that engulfed the entirety of the villa.* Sssii! * From within travelled noises, which made Leylin recall the decomposition process of a man eating plant.The black clouds grew denser, finally shielding what was happening within.However, there were the occasional sounds of the Bone Eating Flower which continuously waned and finally disappeared, only leaving behind decomposing sounds, which would make people cringe.5 minutes later, the black smoke dissipated, revealing the villa from before again.By this moment, the surface of the villa had been severely corroded, and it looked as if it was going to collapse any moment.The Devil Vines and Bone Eating Flower had long since disappeared, leaving behind only a few remains.\u201cWhat a despotic spell! Cloud of Afterlife, a Rank 0 spell which only Level 3 Acolyte can muster. Each use costs 5 Spiritual Force and 5 Magic Power, but it is worth it!\u201dLeylin nodded his head approvingly.With one use of Cloud of Afterlife, not only did the Devil Vines and Bone Eating Flower disappear, the villa had suffered from extreme corrosion, leaving behind only part of the defense, which could be said to no longer pose a threat to Leylin.Moreover, the Cloud of Afterlife was a Shadow, Dark Element spell which was the least destructive. It was something Leylin specially chosen in order to destroy the spell formation on the villa, at the same time leaving behind the construction of the villa.\u201cOnly that\u2026. The villa seems to have been corroded, and cannot stay erect for much longer!\u201dLeylin walked forward and knocked on the wooden door. * Crash! * The wooden door immediately crumbled into many pieces and fell to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chip! Scan the main structure of the villa!\u201d[Mission establishing, beginning scan\u2026.]Previously, the A.I. Chip could not scan the blueprints of the villa due to the layer of spell formation and defensive measures on the surface of the\u00a0villa.But, that was not the case now.Very soon, a layer of light in the shape of a blue map appeared in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.\u201cEn! There are two storeys in the villa. On the higher floor, it\u2019s the bedroom and bathroom! The first floor would be the guestroom. As for the experiment lab, it is located underground! The entrance is built into the back of a wardrobe!\u201dUnder the scan of the A.I. Chip, the interior of the villa was displayed in front of him fully.\u201cTo the bedroom first!\u201d Leylin rapidly ran up the second floor.Gripping the yellow bronze handle, Leylin opened the large door to the bedroom. A layer of dust immediately infiltrated his nose. The surface of Leylin\u2019s body automatically created a layer of black coloured light membrane, shielding him from the dust.Leylin then scanned the area, \u201cEverything is all neatly placed!\u201dThe bedroom was very small, with only a bed, a table and a chair, and a closet.Leylin opened the closet, \u201cThe clothes have all disappeared, it seems that the owner here has prepared to abandon this place!\u201dAlthough he had thought of this before, Leylin was still somewhat disappointed.He immediately rummaged through the bedroom but found nothing of value. Even the drawers of the table were empty, and there was only some blank parchment paper in the corners of the room.\u201cThese should be remnants of the diary or record book! A pity that there\u2019s nothing written on them!\u201dLeylin felt that it was somewhat a shame. His eyes suddenly flashed, \u201cDiary! I got it!\u201dThe yellow parchment paper was very old and seemed as if would break into many pieces. However, to Leylin, these few pieces of parchment paper were supreme treasures!\u201cA.I. Chip! Scan the traces on the parchment paper!\u201dLeylin ordered, and a layer of blue light was immediately projected in front of his eyes. As for the parchment paper, lines of red handwriting were intermittently surfacing.\u201cThis is something that the Magus wrote on a piece of parchment paper, but traces of his handwriting were left on these pieces of parchment!Leylin was somewhat elated. Magi would only use spells to appraise items, but there were spells that defended against such attempts. However they had absolutely no defences against Leylin\u2019s previous world\u2019s graphology, and he eventually found some clues.The information on the parchment paper was extremely disorderly. Many characters were overlapping with one another, and even the A.I. Chip was unable to differentiate between them.After putting together the scattered pieces, what little information Leylin gotten should have been this diary:September 1st, clear. Extreme Night City is a very tranquil city, I hope I can carry out my experiments here peacefully\u2026.December 5th, dark. Oh! Damn it! The experiment has failed yet again, as expected! The difficulty of synthesizing bloodlines has far exceeded my expectations\u2026.What remained was extremely vague, and even the dates could not be deciphered:After reading Wayne\u2019s letter, I conducted a few more experiments. I have to admit, he was right, I was heading in the wrong direction all along, this is indeed some sorrowful news\u2026.The experimental body has failed completely. As for what\u2019s left of the eggs, even if they could hatch, my plan has completely failed. Oh, my heavens\u2026.There is nothing of value here anymore. Maybe I should go to the Dylan Gardens to have a look. Wayne said that his experiments have already achieved a few stages of success, this is a great piece of news for us\u2026.The contents of the diary stopped here, it was a continuous record of a Magus\u2019 failure and ended in the abandonment of the lab.Besides a person called Wayne from the Dylan Gardens, Leylin gained nothing whatsoever.However, there were too many Wayne\u2019s, and as for Dylan Gardens, Leylin never heard of it before.\u201cNot right, wait a minute!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes suddenly flashed, and in the corner of the parchment paper, he discovered a name.The faint red writing was extremely vague, hence, Leylin almost missed it earlier.\u201cNor\u2026 Norco Curadu Sfar!\u201d\u201cNorco Curadu Sfar!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cGreat Magus Serholm!\u201d\u201cCould it be that the owner of this lab was the Great Magus Serholm?\u201dNorco Curadu Sfar was a legend of the South Coast! In the legends, not only was he an erudite scholar, he had obtained extremely outstanding results along the path of a Magus. He had even led the whole of the South Coast Magi to repel the countless advances of the subterranean people and marine creatures.This kind of great Magus was the role model for all Magi in the South Coast.Earlier in the market, the dishonest merchant who tried to sell Leylin the Lowian Academy Teachings had tried to pass off the original decrepit page as the writings of the Great Magus Serholm, but it was seen through by Leylin.\u201cA respected figure like this, his legacy would definitely be of value. A pity that the two storeys were left with nothing and there definitely would not be any legacy or things of the sort!\u201dRegret streaked across Leylin\u2019s face, but he still memorised the contents on the parchment paper.\u201cI hope that there will be something to gain from the experiment lab!\u201dLeylin gave the bedroom one last disappointed glance before he puffed out a breath, and blew the parchment paper into bits.Coming to the wardrobe on the first floor, originally, the in built wardrobe should have been stuck on the wall. However, due to a small crack, Leylin could now see the passage behind it.This should be something that was done by the Mankestre Snake.Leylin shifted away the emptied wardrobe, and the black passage appeared before him.* Pa! * Leylin snapped, and a layer of light illuminated the area, dispelling the darkness and revealing a flight of steps that led downwards.Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed fervently as he walked down.* Clang! *The leather shoes and ground made a dull noise from friction.Compared to the villa above, the underground space was more spacious, and was almost the size of 3 to 4 villas.Criss-crossed walls littered the area, separating the underground lab into a few large areas.Leylin continued down the passage, and from time to time, he could see the labelling of the areas.An ancient handwriting was used. However, it had some relevance to the Byron language. As Leylin walked, he looked.Data area, garden area, incubator area, potioneering area, herbology area\u2026 Each and every special area appeared in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.After seeing the incubator area, Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed, and he walked in.A ball of light always floated around him, illuminating the sight of the incubator area.What initially entered Leylin\u2019s sight were many circular glass domes, but the glasses had already cracked, revealing many rotten eggs of mysterious organisms.Under the alert from the A.I. Chip that there were no signs of life around, Leylin put on a pair of gloves, and held a grey egg that resembled a granite stone in his hands.[Scanning in progress, similarity level to the Mankestre Snake: 73.2%, Huge Wood Python: 34.5%, Huge Tree Lizard: 13.8%]The A.I. Chip continuously projected the results of the scan.\u201cIt seems like these are all the brothers and sisters of the half adult Mankestre Snake!\u201d Leylin gasped as he saw the many dead eggs within the glass domes.If they were all still alive, Leylin would most likely not be able to escape.After some searching, Leylin discovered a strange incubating pool. On the surface of the glass ball, there was a circular hole that was cracked through, and the remnants of some egg shells.\u201cThe Mankestre Snake from earlier should have been bred in this incubating pool\u2026.\u201dLeylin sized up the area and was unresigned as he continued searching, finally obtaining nothing. He could only pick up a dead egg that looked like a stone and toss it.Data area, garden area, potioneering area, herbology area\u2026Leylin looked over everything once. The Great Magus Serholm would have definitely spent a lot of time and effort on it. The set up in each area was extremely thorough.However, when he left, he brought along everything with him. Leylin, who originally wished to get lucky, had now also completely tossed that notion away.Apart from the few blank pieces of parchment paper in the bedroom, there was nothing that Leylin found.\u201cThe final area! The dissecting room!\u201dLeylin wore a disappointed expression that he found difficult to mask, and walked into the room.* Clang! *The steel door boomed opened and a concentrated aura of dense negative energy permeated the air. Leylin could even hear the faint wails of countless souls.\u201cOn the way of a Magus who seeks the truth, one can never avoid spilling blood!\u201d Leylin muttered the maxim of the Great Magus Serholm.After sizing up the area, Leylin noticed that there were some traces of black blood on the white experiment table. He picked up some powder from it.\u201cA.I. Chip! Scan!\u201d[No surviving cells were detected! Due to various intense radiations, there are deficiencies and mutations in the fragments of the cells, unable to detect source!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cFuck!\u201d Leylin felt utter disappointment as he kicked the experiment table.Towards Magi who loved explorations, nothing was more disappointing than devoting countless effort and energy to enter the vestiges of ancient times and returning empty handed.Although the Alchemy diary could already be considered to be extremely beneficial to Leylin, compared to the Great Magus Serholm, that kind of loot was somehow inadequate.This was the Great Magus Serholm!!! An official Magus that was at least Rank 4!!!But in his lab, Leylin gained nothing at all, which made him extremely vexed.\u201cForget it! At least I still have the diary of that unlucky fellow. I did not suffer any loss. Moreover, this experiment could very well be a lab that the Great Magus Serholm used when he was a Rank 1 or 2 Magus. If not, I would have definitely not been able to enter\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, Leylin was rather glad.If he had trespassed into the lab of the Great Magus Serholm when he was at his peak. and if there had been some curse laid out, Leylin certainly would have been unable to resist right now.* Bang! *As if kickstarting some kind of chain reaction by kicking the experiment table, a gust of wind blew past the ground, turned into a whirlwind, and coiled the dust up in the air.\u201cEh?\u201d Leylin\u2019s face tightened, and his right hand extended into his waist pouch.The cyclone grew larger and larger, before finally forming into a translucent human figure.\u201cHow many years\u2026 How many years has it been already! I have finally caught a whiff of a living human!\u201d The translucent figure seemed to gasp and revealed a vague elderly visage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sometimes, even a regular human could turn into an evil spirit after death, yet even official Magi never had such things happen to them.Moreover, spirit bodies were extremely rare. With regards to their research, even if the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had a large number of observations, they only slightly understood the behavior of spirit bodies.As the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy only sought knowledge, Leylin managed to learn a little about spirit bodies through a few words mentioned by professors, so he wouldn\u2019t be like others who might be frightened.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Leylin asked warily as he retreated back by several steps.\u201cName?\u201d The translucent spirit body shook its head, \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten that long ago!\u201d\u201cCountless years have passed and I have been wandering here always, up to this day! I felt that an interesting fellow had trespassed into my lab, so I came out to have a look at you!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cSo you are the owner of this lab! Accept my apologies, for interrupting you so presumptuously!\u201dSaying so, he gave a polite bow used between Magi and his gesture had no flaws.The spirit body\u2019s faint lips curled upwards, \u201cI like little fellows with manners!\u201dHe reached out his translucent hand, and a layer of light appeared in his hands, \u201cYou can obtain a great present from this magnificent wizard!\u201d\u201cReally? Honestly, this is too good!\u201dLeylin seemed to be \u2018ecstatic\u2019 as he stepped several steps forward. Suddenly, a gob of green ball appeared and was shot out from Leylin\u2019s hands, which passed the spirit body, directly landing on the experiment table behind.* Sssii! * A large hole corroded through the experiment table.\u201cA physical attack has no effect?\u201d Leylin\u2019s turned solemn.\u201cLittle fellow, what are you doing?\u201d The spirit body smiled but it seemed to be more sinister from before.\u201cThis is the magnificent Magus Roman\u2019s inheritance, which can allow you to successfully advance into an official Magus!\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? You are just a spirit with a grievance that impersonated your owner!\u201dLeylin retreated several more steps and a purple potion appeared in his hands.\u201cI reckon that light in your hands is not anything good!\u201d* Bang! * The potion flew from his hands and let off an intense combustion. The purple smoke rose continuously, and under the engulfment of the purple mist, the layer of light in the spirit body\u2019s hands dispersed, revealing a sinister looking visage that howled with unwillingness. It looked rather similar to the spirit body.\u201cA malicious, vengeful spirit who loves to invade the physical bodies of living humans!\u201dLeylin thought of some distant narration and exclaimed, \u201cVengeful spirit! You are a vengeful spirit!\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d The spirit body had a bloodthirsty smirk.\u201cThe thing that really lured you out should be this book right?\u201d Leylin waved an Alchemy diary book, which he retrieved from his robes.\u201cIndeed! This is something that belongs to me!\u201d Seeing the black diary, the eyes of the spirit body seemed to be reminded of something.\u201cYou are the corpse at the front door. During the exploration of this lab, you were killed by the Gnawing Slate. Your spirit was trapped by the spell formation, before finally turning into a vengeful spirit!\u201dLeylin summarized the series of events, as he already knew who the real owner of this lab was.\u201cAn intelligent kid!\u201d The spirit body toyed with its fingernails, \u201cA pity that you will die here today!\u201d* Whoosh! *Leylin only felt a light flashing by and tried to dodge, but he found several traces of blood on his chest.\u201cThe smell of fresh blood!\u201d Seeing the blood, the expression of the spirit body turned even more desirous and he placed his fingers in his mouth and licked them.\u201cWhat a quick movement! The naked eye cannot keep up with it!\u201dA blue light appeared from Leylin\u2019s eyes, and the A.I. Chip calculated quickly.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to escape! Surrender and become an offering of the magnificent Roman!\u201d The vengeful spirit howled and charged forward again.His fingernails sprung forward as if turning into a razor sharp blade.* Dang! * A layer of light membrane appeared from Leylin\u2019s body, shielding him from the force of the frantic attack.Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion!\u201cI\u2019ve caught you!\u201d Leylin sneered.Leylin could not entirely keep up with a spirit body, which travelled as fast as the wind. Even if the A.I. Chip could calculate its trajectory and movements, with Leylin\u2019s physical abilities, he could not follow it. Moreover, due to the illusory appearance of the spirit body, most physical attacks were of no use.Thankfully, Leylin\u2019s potion\u2014 the Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion which he had concocted before\u2014 was the only defensive potion that acolytes had access to. There were even some suppression effects towards spirit bodies.The hand, which was enveloped in light, directly grabbed hold of the right hand of the spirit body.\u201cIm\u2026Impossible! How are you able to touch me?\u201dThe spirit\u2019s face contorted and it howled as it struggled.\u201cSpirit bodies may be very mysterious to the acolytes of other academies, but it\u2019s a pity that you met me, who came from the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy! Accept the fate of a failure!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face was serene and he took out a black coloured crystal ball.This was something that he had managed to obtain in the academy\u2014 a Confining Spirit Sphere, which was specifically used to capture and store spirit bodies.* Chi! * After the black coloured crystal ball came into contact with the spirit body, glowing light radiated and a suction force appeared on its surface, which sucked the continuously howling spirit body directly into it.Minutes later, nothing stood in front of Leylin anymore. The inside the black crystal ball had an extra-translucent figure in it; thus, the black crystal had a resemblance to amber.(ED Note: Amber, a gemstone that may have some fossil trapped in it.)Leylin heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThankfully this old geezer is only a Level 3 Acolyte, and fortunately, I had the Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion and Confining Spirit Sphere. If not, I would have been in trouble today\u2026.\u201dConcerning spirit bodies, the strength of their soul would determine their might.As for the meditation of magicians, it is the cultivation of Spiritual Force, a type of method to strengthen their soul.There was once an official Magus who, when he transformed into a spirit body, actually retained his spell casting abilities, finally turning into a spirit body Magus.If today he met with a spirit body that was an official Magus, Leylin would have had no chance at all of escaping.Once a physical body is occupied, the soul will forever be connected to it.Looking at the black crystal ball in his hands, Leylin thought and then added several more seals on it, then placed it into a small black sack. He even tightened the mouth of the sack and hung it on his waist.After doing so, Leylin searched the entirety of the villa. After confirming that there were no more oversights, he left the place with extreme regrets.\u201cWhat a pity!\u201dLeylin looked at the huge black granite boulder behind him, and without further hesitation, he rode a handsome blade steed and rapidly left the area,* Boom! *When he left, the huge black granite boulder exploded loudly, destroying the whole area and turning into ashes.Half a month later, in the experiment lab, Leylin closed the black diary after reading its last page.\u201cI never thought that the synthesis of a Magic Artifact as depicted by Lowian Academy Teachings, or the ancient formula of the Tears of Mary, would include the aspect of souls\u2026.\u201dLeylin had only heard of this information vaguely from Kroft back in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, but he had never researched it on his own.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2026 I can only adopt the crudest method, which is to research and observe from various trial and error experiments. Also, I have to use the A.I. Chip to gather data\u2026. In this aspect, perhaps Viscount Jackson, in his capacity as a city lord, could help me \u2026.\u201dThinking of which, Leylin took out a black crystal ball from the corner of his lab.The crystal ball was originally placed on an altar with mysterious runes scribbled over it and there were 3 white, lit candles that surrounded it.Leylin knocked on the surface of the crystal ball.* Dong! *A wave suddenly erupted, and the mist in the crystal ball dispersed, revealing a vague fuzzy figure.This figure only had the upper half of its body, and its lower limbs were replaced by the continuously swirling white mist. As for its countenance, it was that of an old geezer.This old geezer\u2019s expression was extremely rapt and fright permanently lingered on his face, as if it was a small worm that was solidified within amber.Looking at this vengeful spirit, Leylin suddenly laughed and chanted an incantation.\u201cWhere is this? Release me quickly\u2026.\u201d Suddenly, the solidified contents in the crystal ball turned to life again. The old geezer howled. Although his face was still filled with vehemence and craziness, it could not conceal his fear and helplessness!\u201cHow is it, Mister Roman? How is the feeling of having your thoughts frozen?\u201dLeylin propped the ball in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d The vengeful spirit head-butted the surface of the crystal ball, but it was to no avail.Seeing Roman, who was like a helpless mosquito, wildly charge against the interior walls of the crystal ball, Leylin chuckled and flicked his finger at the surface of the crystal ball.* Bang! * Roman, who was inside, seemed to have been struck by a steel hammer and collapsed onto the ground, completely dispirited.\u201cHow is it? Now, hurry up and tell me everything you know about the experiment and your life. I may consider letting you off after that!\u201dLeylin\u2019s face was impassive.\u201cDream on!\u201d Roman put on a resolute expression.\u201cThen I have no choice!\u201d Leylin shrugged his shoulders and placed a fiery red rock beside the crystal ball.\u201cArghhh!\u201d Flames immediately appeared on Roman\u2019s body, as he wailed pitifully.\u201cIn the aspect of adding suffering to a spirit body, I have some skills! Moreover, in this crystal ball, you cannot even commit suicide. This kind of torture will last for a very long time! A veerrrrry loooooongg tiiiiiime\u2026.\u201dLeylin dragged his last words to the extreme, which would make someone who listened to it want to sleep.\u201cBe\u2026 A Bewitching Charm? Dream on!\u201d Roman, who was squeezed into the crystal ball, gritted his teeth.\u201cThat is some unexpected mental fortitude!\u201dLeylin\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cIt seems like I have to cast it once a day in the future, to make this vengeful spirit\u2019s life force reduce greatly\u2026.\u201dThe life force was the foundation of vengeful spirits. When the life force of vengeful spirits is weakened, their intelligence will often lower, turning into a retard.Under the current circumstances, adding on to the bewitching charm, there is a great chance of success.Even if it did not drive Roman crazy, there shouldn\u2019t be any issues at all. Leylin, as a Potions Master, had confidence in preserving Roman\u2019s life force before it dissipated. By prolonging Roman\u2019s life force, and repeatedly torturing him, with perseverance, Leylin would obtain the information he needed.As for what Leylin had now, it was time. Time to toy with Roman slowly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The windmills in the distance were continuously whirling and the earth seemed to be joyous from the abundance.* Dang Dang Dang! *Travelling on the road in the middle of the farms was a group of horse carriages and armoured Knights with the strength and robustness that far exceeded those of ordinary men. \u00a0On the armour on their shoulder plates was an insignia of a crescent moon\u2014 this was the insignia belonging to the City Lord of Extreme Night City, Viscount Jackson!Upon seeing the horse carriages, the farmers hurriedly avoided the road, taking off their caps and bowing.In the middle of the Knights and troops, were several horse carriages that were veiled with black cloth. As these carriages advanced, sounds of clanging metal chains were produced from it which gave off an ominous feeling.\u201cLook at this direction! It seems to be headed to the villa! This should be the third group in this month!\u201d A farmer with a brown beard muttered to himself.\u201cOld Johan! What are you looking at?\u201d A farmer at the other side called out.\u201cThose horse carriages! I keep having the feeling that something is amiss. Previously when the wind blew, I saw the figures inside the horse carriage\u2026.\u201d Old John\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cSo what? It might be that the lord of our manor has started to purchase female slaves on a whim! You know what, our kind-hearted yet lazy manor lord, is still in his teens!\u201dThe farmer beside Old John supported him and grumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s better for us not to bother with the matters of these people. Let\u2019s go! Rose Pub recently has new rum\u2026.\u201dBoth farmers\u2019 silhouette disappeared gradually in the distance.As for the other side, the procession of horse carriages stopped outside of Leylin\u2019s manor. Greem and Fraser have long since been waiting for them.\u201cAccording to the City Lord\u2019s orders, the \u2018goods\u2019 have arrived!\u201d The leader of the Knights peeled his cloak open, revealing a hideous face littered with scars.\u201cOpen the prisoners\u2019 carriage!\u201d With the leader\u2019s command, the subordinates hurriedly opened the carriages carrying the prisoners, revealing the chained prisoners within.These prisoners only wore coarse armour and these had holes and were covered in grime. They were all of different stature. Short, tall, thin and fat. However, the common similarity is the killing aura masked in their expressionless eyes.Knights such as Greem and Fraser were extremely sensitive to killing intent. Only people who have truly committed homicide would have this aura.\u201cThere are 5 men. They are all heinous criminals. Every legal case regarding them is enough to execute the capital punishments a dozen times\u2026. Of course, the City Lord has long since approved of their death sentence. In the eyes of the law, they are already \u2018dead\u2019\u2026.\u201dThe Knight leader smirked, and his face which was littered with scars turned even more grotesque. \u201cFor whatever reason, even for the sake of those innocent victims, never let them go easily\u2026.\u201d\u201cTheir fate is all in the hands of Young Master!\u201d After receiving the criminals, Greem said, \u201cHowever, we can guarantee that not one of them will walk out of this manor\u2026.\u201dAfter getting a satisfactory response the Knight leader brought his troops and the empty prison carriages out of the villa.As for Greem, he forcefully brought the 5 criminals under the basement of the manor.The torch in the darkness, the tightly locked door, and the dry stifling underground passage gave all these criminals an eerie feeling. However, with the two Knights, Greem and Fraser, they had no chance to resist.Greem led the way familiarly, bringing the 5 criminals each into different prison. Afterwards, he came to a newly tunneled experiment lab and waited by the side.Although there were thick walls, and the surroundings had torches which were scorching bright, Greem still felt his hairs stand on end, and cold sweat trickled down his body.As a slave Knight, he knew part of Leylin\u2019s identity. \u00a0He knew even more about the darkness and the terror behind those walls!\u201cThat place is practically a hell!\u201d The first time Greem was summoned inside by Leylin, he had blurted his thoughts. Afterwards, this fearless Knight had puked for an entire night.Half an hour passed. For Greem, time seemed to have crawled like half a year long. Especially when the indistinct screams that occasionally seeped through the sturdy walls with the impression of piercing his ear drum!May the heavens have pity! Although Greem was no good person, and his hands too were covered with blood, the moaning and wails behind the stone walls were something that a human was incapable of producing anymore.* Creak! * The sturdy steel door swung open and Leylin strode out from it. On his body were traces of blood stains.\u201cA pity that the experimental body was not strong enough and was unable to endure the effects of the spell! I hope the next few experimental bodies will be more durable\u2026.\u201dTo research on souls, Leylin did not have any readily available ingredients. So he could only adopt the crudest method which was to continuously gather data through experiments.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Greem hurriedly bowed. \u201cToday the City Lord\u2019s Castle has sent another 5 people over and they are all inside their cells\u2026.\u201d\u201cVery well!\u201d Leylin nodded his head.Although he was a Level 3 Acolyte, before advancing into an official Magus, Leylin did not have enough assurance for challenging those self-proclaimed \u201cLight\u201d Magi, so some things still had to be concealed.Only Greem and Fraser were handling the reception of goods. Apart from them, Anna, too, knew a little about it. Other than them, even Fayern and Old Welker, the housekeeper, knew nothing of Leylin\u2019s deeds.Although they had some faint surmises, but Leylin always disposed of those useless \u2018ingredients\u2019 by cremating them with medicinal powder. Under no evidence, even if anyone had suspicions, they could not do anything towards him.\u201cThis is the limitation of strength! The official Magi in the academy can saunter through slave markets to purchase slaves as ingredients. They could even lure and cheat acolytes but nobody could punish them! However, I am just a lowly acolyte and all by myself. I still have to mind my reputation\u2026.\u201dLeylin stroked his chin.\u201cA.I. Chip, how is the gathering of data on experimental bodies today?\u201dLeylin asked inwardly.[The Spiritual Force of the experimental subject has already been discovered to have 23 abnormal cerebral fluctuations and within the cerebrum were 45 hidden locations\u2026.]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cUsing the prisoners as living subjects and carrying out experiments to obtain research and data on the spirit body, seemed like it\u2019s doable!\u201dLeylin nodded his head, \u201cIt\u2019s just that the amount is still too little\u2026.\u201dTurning back, he looked at Greem who seemed to have been uneasy right from the start, \u201cYou did well, take your leave now!\u201d\u201cAs you wish, Master!\u201d Greem bowed and heaved a secret sigh of relief as he hurriedly ran away.As a regular human, naturally he was somewhat conflicted with these issues, not to mention the limitations set from the slave training. But Leylin\u2019s strength had far surpassed Greem\u2019s. Hence, he could only find it difficult to bear but did not dare to display any reluctance.As his owner, Leylin naturally had seen through this point.\u201cAfter all, he is just a regular human and such occurrences are to be expected. As long as he is still obeying orders, the others I need not care about\u2026.\u201d Leylin recalled Greem\u2019s expression for a moment, before completely forgetting him. His black robes swirled about him as he disappeared into the underground lab.\u201cLeylin, my friend, we meet again!\u201dHis green hair trailing the ground, Langford looked at Leylin and sincerity was shown on his face.Ever since the previous incident between Leylin and Langford, they actually had traded a few more times. They had even established a friendship and became pretty good friends.How things turned out like this was because Leylin discovered that when Langford was not crazy, his character was rather good. Moreover, his supplies of goods were constant and the prices in the Brey Canyon were cheaper than other magicians\u2019.Between magicians, benefits are the only constant. As for other things, most of them could be forsaken.\u201cLangford! This time, I require the goods urgently! Have a look!\u201dLeylin nodded his head as he handed over a yellow parchment paper with scribbles on it.\u201cI seldom see this side of you! Let me take a look!\u201d Langford took the parchment paper and immediately ground his teeth.\u201cThe faeces of the Kosh Bird, Stellar Alloy\u2026. These items are all connected to the aspect of souls and are not cheap items!\u201d* Dong! * A small sack was immediately slammed onto Langford\u2019s table.After loosening the ropes around it, glittering Magic Crystals were revealed within it.\u201cDo not worry about Magic Crystals, these are the deposit. I will make up for the difference later with potions!\u201d Leylin spoke in a rich and overbearing manner.\u201cThat\u2019s right! With your ability, Magic Crystals are only a small issue!\u201dLangford eyes glowed, and immediately kept the Magic Crystal sack into his robes, \u201cThe Kosh Bird is on the verge of extinction. I heard that some people had chanced upon it before in the Black Death Mountain Plains. As for Stellar Alloy, I have a piece of it here\u2026.\u201dLangford immediately rummaged through the shelves behind him, after which he opened a small black box.In the centre of the red satin interior was a silver-coloured rock with blue spots\u201cThe ingredients that you need, Stellar Alloy, Flowerless Leaves\u2026 I have one of each here. As for the others, maybe you could look further within the canyon\u2026.\u201dLangford hurriedly piled the items together, and calculated the final value, \u201c785 Magic Crystals!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Leylin stroked his chin somewhat grudgingly, \u201cI will go for a look at the market. Also, you have to keep a lookout for the items I requested and purchase them when you can!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Once Langford agreed, his countenance changed and the green hair continuously shrank, very soon reaching the waist area from the legs.\u201cLea\u2026 Leave now!\u201d Langford\u2019s face contorted, and one of his eyes was already bloodshot.Leylin turned around, until he left the cave for a distance before a howling sound travelled to his ears.\u201cAn intermittent illness like this is really scary\u2026.\u201d Leylin\u2019s footstep did not stop and directly headed towards the depths of the canyon.\u201cHurry, look! Langford has acted up again\u2026.\u201d\u201cShould we inform the protectors?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid there won\u2019t be of much use. Hehe, not long later, Langford will be chased out from this place.\u201dAt the same moment, from both sides of the cave, many acolytes who wore pointed hats looked at the direction of the howling sound. Expressions of anxiety, indifference andschadenfreude\u00a0were seen across various faces.After being busy for some time, Leylin emerged from the Brey Canyon. On his back was an additional black backpack stuffed full of various ingredients.Leylin turned around to look at the Brey Canyon, before riding his dark horse and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNews From The AcademyInside a spacious and bright room was a full-length mirror.The mirror was taller than a person and was ornamented along its sides with black leaves which contrasted with the white birch wood. A large variety of different colored gems were also embedded along its edges, making it look extremely extravagant.At this moment, a youth wearing a swallow-tail coat was standing in front of this mirror. Behind him were a few maids, who were busy straightening out their master\u2019s attire.After tidying up, the youth waved his hands, sending the maids away, leaving him alone in the room.This youth judged his reflected figure\u2014- a medium-height build with a slim stature. He was brown haired and somewhat pale-skinned. His countenance could be described as delicate, but the shining luster in both his eyes indicated he had a very active mind.\u201cUnknowingly, I have already turned 17!\u201dLeylin looked at himself in the mirror and spoke with a hint of melancholy.Time was the most incisive weapon. It turned babies into old people and created barren deserts by drying up seas. Even if a person was a Magus, they could only slightly prolong their lives. But even if they could live for several thousand years, they could still not evade the slow corrosion of time.Over a year had passed ever since Leylin returned from his previous exploration.\u201cNo! I must fight the eternal curse of time and seek immortality. Only then would I be deserving of the fate of having being transported to this world!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes turned a fiery black as if a deep magnificent flame was burning within them.\u201cMaster! The City Lord\u2019s horse carriage is here!\u201d Outside the door, Anna\u2019s voice could be heard.\u201cLet him wait for a while, I\u2019ll be coming over shortly.\u201dLeylin faced the mirror and finished sorting out his bearings, before picking up a short black cane and leaving the room.* Deng Deng! *The black horse carriage flew rapidly across the street and, after seeing the insignia of the City Lord Castle; the citizens avoided it and made way. They all sent respectful and envious gazes to the horse carriage.In the cabin, there was only Leylin. Currently, this youth was lying comfortably against a velvety goose feather cushion. His hand laid on its side, revealing a strange pendant on his palm.The pendant was strikingly similar to the silver cross. On its surface were a few red and blue diamonds, which glittered in the light, giving off a faint glow.As Leylin stared at this pendant, a satisfied expression crossed his face.\u201cAccording to the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculations, with the Stellar Alloy as the centerpiece and the support of various precious alloys that I have obtained during my travels, this prototype of the Magic Artifact has already been perfectly synthesized.\u201dThis pendant artifact was something that Leylin had synthesized according to the Magic Artifact section of the Lowian Academy Teachings.3 years ago Leylin had managed to buy the decrepit page of the Lowian Academy Teachings, having the A.I. Chip slowly decipher the contents within.The earlier portions of the teachings were only suitable for acolytes, with many travels and adventures recorded down. If not, Leylin could never have purchased the page at an extremely low price.Leylin\u2019s luck was not bad. After the A.I. Chip finished deciphering, he obtained a method to synthesize a low-grade Magic Artifact.Fallen Star Pendant \u2014 This was the name of the Magic Artifact recipe he had obtained. According to the Lowian Academy Teachings, this Fallen Star Pendant, while a low-grade Magic Artifact, was of the rare defensive nature. Compared to a few attack type Magic Artifacts, its value was naturally much higher. Even an official Magus might be interested in it.After having to see the materials needed and the process, Leylin had immediately decided that he had to synthesize the Fallen Star Pendant.Although the spells of acolytes are rather destructive, their low defense capabilities have always been an issue.Only by turning into an official Magus, and being able to form an innate defensive spell, can there be a spell projecting a force field that constantly protected the body. Only then, could someone be considered to be an awe-inspiring Magus.As for acolytes, they could lose their lives at any time from sneak attacks.The few acolytes who had entered the withering woods with Leylin previously were the best examples of this case.Although they were able to cast destructive spells, due to the Great Mankestre Snake, they had all perished due to the lack of defensive spells. Only Murphy was fortunate enough to stay alive, but that was due to Leylin saving him.Once he had synthesized the Fallen Star Pendant, coupled with a couple of defensive potions, Leylin\u2019s defence would be comparable to a fraction of the defence that a Magus had.Furthermore, the Fallen Star Pendant\u2019s defence force field would be activated immediately. For instance, as long as the opponent\u2019s attack power does not exceed the threshold of the Fallen Star Pendant and before it\u2019s energy was completely depleted, Leylin\u2019s defence would be like that of a sturdy turtle shell. As long as the Fallen Star Pendant was active, nothing would happen to Leylin.\u201cFortunately, there was a magician market near Extreme Night City, if not I wouldn\u2019t have been able to find so many precious ingredients so quickly!\u201dLeylin somehow felt glad for that.After smashing and grinding most of the Magic Crystals he had, as well as adding all of the ingredients from the Great Mankestre Snake, he managed to create this prototype of a pendant.\u201cI have basically consumed all of my expendable resources. According to the Lowian Academy Teachings, this is only an incomplete product. The core of the Fallen Star Pendant has already been completed. What\u2019s left is the final step\u2026.\u201dGlancing at the Fallen Star Pendant in his hands he saw that the silver cross glittered and glowed with a wide range of different hues. On its surface were inscribed mysterious patterns, and altogether it seemed like a mystical art piece.\u201cAs for the final ingredient, I have it with me already. I need to only wait for the opportune moment before I can initiate the spirit awakening for the Fallen Star Pendant!\u201dLeylin gripped the Fallen Star Pendant tightly and kept it on his shirt.\u201cAs for the Tears of Mary, this ancient formula is really difficult to comprehend. Even after a lot of experiments and obtaining large amounts of data on spirit bodies, I still don\u2019t understand anything from looking at this formula!\u201dLeylin appeared downcast, and his thoughts spun rapidly, \u201cCould it be that my conjecture is wrong? What if this formula has nothing to do with spirit bodies\u2026.\u201d\u201cHalt!\u201d The coachman\u2019s voice travelled from the front. The horse carriage jerked, as it came to a stop.\u201cSir Leylin! The City Lord\u2019s Castle is just ahead,\u201d reported \u00a0the coachmen, respectfully.Leylin shook his head and organized his inner thoughts as he walked out of the carriage\u2019s door.The City Lord\u2019s Castle was still the same \u2014 just as imposing and dignified as before. Rows of guards on both sides of the entrance were standing facing each other, and their gaze never wavered, appearing formidable.\u201cViscount Jackson is rather intelligent!\u201d Ever since the withering woods incident, he had pretended to be heavily injured and allowed the news to travel out. After his enemies confirmed the news and began to gather in cahoots for an attack, he caught them all at once lightning quick. He cut off all of their heads and their blood overflowed into the moat. From then on, all of Extreme Night City has been extremely quiet\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeylin! My brother!\u201dViscount Jackson had long since waited at the main door. Upon seeing Leylin, he immediately went forward to receive him.Viscount Jackson had witnessed Leylin\u2019s strength first hand. Not to mention that Leylin was Viscount Jackson\u2019s lifesaver. If not for Leylin, Viscount Jackson would have long since become prey for the Great Mankestre Snake.\u201d\u201cCity Lord,\u201d said Leylin, as he nodded his head.Viscount Jackson grabbed Leylin\u2019s hands in a cordial manner. After bringing Leylin for a stroll around his castle\u2019s garden, he then brought Leylin to a private study room.Within the privacy of the castle, Viscount Jackson finally revealed a worrisome expression.\u201cMy brother Leylin! Last time you had requested for 50 men, but I am simply unable to provide you with that many\u2026. I have already sent all the criminals from all of my jails to your place. \u00a0Also, I have even sent you cheats and thieves whose crimes do not warrant a death sentence. However, it is still too far from the number you requested\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt was like this?\u201d Leylin nodded his head, and sat on the sofa, entering into deep thought.Extreme Night City could barely be considered as a medium-sized city. Their residents would not exceed 100,000 people. For Viscount Jackson, providing Leylin with a few prisoners meant for the death row was still within his means. However, as time passed, the number of death row criminals became less and less, yet Leylin\u2019s request only kept increasing. So now, he could no longer fulfill the requests of Leylin.\u201cAs you know,\u201d continued Viscount Jackson while Leylin was in deep thought, \u201cI am only a City Lord. My noble status is only that of a Viscount. For individual death sentences, I may still be able to decide on them. However, once it exceeds a certain threshold, I have no choice in the matter. After all, there are still laws presiding over the dukedom\u2026.\u201dViscount Jackson waved his hands, and his eyes flashed, \u201cUnless there is a war happening at the moment, if 50 or 100 people disappeared at once, it would definitely incite the wrath of the masses!\u201d\u201cWar!!!\u201dLeylin was startled, but very soon his startled appearance turned into a frosty smirk. This was indeed a good chance to collect samples.However, Viscount Jackson chose to mention it at this time, so it was very likely that he had already thought of a plan.\u201cRegarding this, I\u2026\u201d As Leylin wanted to speak further on the matter, his chest pocket suddenly vibrated as a crow-like \u2018caw\u2019 sounded. Immediately Leylin\u2019s expression changed.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Viscount Jackson asked with a \u2018concerned\u2019 look.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026. It\u2019s nothing; I\u2019ve received news from a friend!\u201d Leylin reached his hands into his chest, and the cawing stopped immediately. His countenance also resumed its previous tranquility.However, Leylin lost interest in speaking any further. He hurriedly exchanged a few more words with Viscount Jackson before bidding farewell.Although something was troubling Viscount Jackson, seeing Leylin, who became absent-minded towards the end, he still did not say what was on his mind.After Leylin came out of the castle, he hopped onto the horse carriage and rushed back to the manor.\u201cI actually received news from the academy at a time like this \u2026.\u201d According to the news, the war of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had already reached the peak of its intensity, where the victor and loser could be determined at any given moment.As Leylin was an acolyte who was sent out on a mission, the academy had given him items with which they could contact him. There were also various items for contact purposes, with a \u2018single-use\u2019 effect, sent with him. This way, they were able to get the most updated news of the school during critical times.\u201cRight now, the news given would most likely determine the winner and loser. The Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s strength is limited, and there are two other factions of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s strength opposing it, so the chances of winning are slim,\u201d mused Leylin, as he had a good grasp of the current predicament of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u201cUnless some external faction has stepped forward to mediate, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy will definitely take a huge loss this time, and may even result in being disbanded\u2026.\u201dLeylin carried a solemn expression as he stepped into his secret lab.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayArrangementsThe shadow of a mahogany circular table could be seen under the dim glow of the lantern.The four legs were elongated in the projection and when projected on the walls, it looked like a beast with four limbs, making it seem ominous.Leylin stood in front of the table, and his shadow, too, was elongated.A bunch of black scrolls were placed on the mahogany wood table. On the surface of each of the scrolls was a picture of a crow. At this moment, the crow seemed to have come alive and cawed continuously, giving off a noise that would terrify people.\u201cNo matter what, I have to look at the contents within!\u201dLeylin made up his mind, \u201cEven if it was a trap, which contains some sort of tracing spell inside, I still have enough time to escape!\u201dEven if that was the case, Leylin still gripped the Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion \u2014 that he had just brewed \u2014 tightly in his hands.After which, with a solemn voice, Leylin spoke in the Byron language, \u201cOpen in the name of Leylin Farlier!\u201d* Caw Caw Caw! * The black crow cried, and its figure twisted. Many black lines converged, forming the image of a black skull.Leylin picked a red crystal from his robes and tossed it into the skull\u2019s mouth.* Crunch! Crunch! * The black skull immediately flew out from the paper and devoured the red crystal.* Puff! * After finishing its meal, the black skull exploded, and the scroll shuddered violently. It started to burn at the bottom, where a green-coloured flame was seen.The greenish flame then formed many characters in mid-air.Leylin\u2019s eyes shifted. These green characters were a kind of secret code, which outsiders would not understand. But he has learnt its corresponding encryption and decryption back at Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.Under the green-coloured characters was a bright red stamp, with a distinguished name written below it in the Byron language. There even was an image of a black snake which crawled out from a skull.\u201cEven the chairman\u2019s seal has appeared \u2013- it seems like this news is not a fake!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression became volatile upon seeing the fluctuating characters.Some time later, after the flame finished burning, the green characters disappeared into the air, leaving behind a pile of grey ashes.Leylin sighed and furrowed his brows.\u201cThey actually sent the highest order \u2013- asking all acolytes, who are working on missions outside, to rush back to the academy immediately!\u201d\u201cFurthermore, they have also set severe punishments. Those who do not make it back to the academy within 3 months, will immediately be labelled as a traitor, and be subjected to the academy\u2019s disciplinary team\u2019s execution!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I have to go back this time!\u201d Leylin muttered.As to whether it was a trap set by an enemy, Leylin was not at all worried.First of all, Leylin was only a lowly acolyte. The enemy would not go through such painstaking means for him. Also, the chairman of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was a legendary figure. He was, at the least, a Rank 2 Magus. Even if Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was defeated, his personal seal would never land in the hands of the enemy.\u201cAbyssal Bone Forest Academy \u2026.\u201d Leylin sighed and thought of Kroft, Bicky, Nyssa and the rest, wondering how they have been.Previously when Leylin made a hasty decision to leave, it was indeed rather selfish of him. However, his strength was not even likened to that of an ant in front of the two academies, so he could not think of a better way.\u201cI\u2019d never imagined that after 3 years, I will finally be returning!\u201dLeylin suddenly ordered, \u201cA.I. Chip, bring forth my stats now!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 3 Acolyte, Knight. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 3.3, Vitality: 3.7, Spiritual Force: 13.1, Magical Power: 13 \u2013 (Magical Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force). Status: Healthy]More than a year had passed, and the modified Azure Potion, even for a Level 3 Acolyte, had a very beneficial effect. It managed to bring Leylin\u2019s Spiritual Force up by another 3 points.His body\u2019s resistance towards the medicine, however, had now reached its limits. Drinking more of the Azure Potion would no longer have any effect.Raising his Spiritual Force for the next few years would be impossible for Leylin unless he were to concoct a new type of Spiritual Force medicine.\u201cAfter Level 3 Acolyte, it will be the realm of an official Magus!\u201d Leylin muttered, \u201cAdvancing from Level 3 Acolyte to official Magus, there will be a huge bottleneck. The difficulty is much higher than that of advancing from a Level 2 to Level 3 Acolyte.\u201dIt seemed like all of the factions in the Magus World deliberately controlled the information regarding of official Magus. Even if Leylin were to fork out huge amounts of Magic Crystals, he would not be able to retrieve much.The previous, harrowing incident of advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte suddenly surfaced on Leylin\u2019s mind.\u201cThe higher ups in the Magus World have strictly kept the information regarding Magus advancement highly confidential. No matter how genius a wandering magician may be, as long as they don\u2019t join a faction, they will never be able to obtain knowledge of advancing. This is to keep the lowest tier from resisting and creating a rebellion and to maintain the ruling.Leylin, too, had experienced the evil consequences of advancing without prior knowledge. If not for the A.I. Chip, he would have died without even leaving behind a corpse.\u201cAbyssal Bone Forest Academy! I have to return once and obtain knowledge of advancing into an official Magus.This was the only place where Leylin knew he could obtain information more easily. As for markets and whatnot, they were completely not worth considering.The path of a Magus would be covered with thorns. One misstep would result in an irreversible consequence.Last time, Leylin took a risk and advanced to the Level 3 Acolyte, but because of the lack of guidance from the academy and his mentor, he could only rely on the A.I. Chip to simulate. In the end, he met with two unexpected situations. If not for the A.I. Chip\u2019s immense capabilities, coupled with a little luck, Leylin would never have been able to advance that easily, and that too without any side effects.\u201cOnly that\u2026I have to reconsider the arrangements for my subordinates!\u201dLeylin stroked his chin, \u201cMaybe, arranging for a backup plan here won\u2019t be a bad idea after all \u2026.\u201d\u201cGive out the orders, I wish to join the subordinates for tonight\u2019s dinner!\u201dAfter exiting the secret lab, Leylin instructed Anna.\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Leylin was on the solitary side, and he usually left the daily chores and trifle things to Anna, Greem and the others, while he holed himself up in the experiment lab all day. He also rarely left the manor, so giving out an order suddenly did startle Anna. However, she was a quick-witted woman, so she did not ask much. After curtseying, she retreated while displaying her beautiful curves in front of Leylin.In the manor, naturally there were halls large enough which could accommodate the master to have a meal with his subordinates.The hall was constructed with large red rocks, the windowsill was rather small, and the sunlight could only dimly light up the place. However, at the centre, a silver rack with hundreds of candles lit solved that problem completely.In the centre of the large hall, a long red table was placed. The attendants and kitchen staff were shifting the huge chairs with backrest, which caused squeaky noises. They also laid a thick, white cloth on the table, and arranged silver forks and spoons, plates and other cutleries.When it was time to eat, the table was already filled with many delicacies. At the centre was a barbecued mutton. Around the golden yellow barbecue meat, there were many purple and red fruits. It complemented the combination of dishes and was a tantalising display.Leylin immediately sat at the most respected position and looked at the group in front of him.Immediately, to the left and right sides of Leylin, were Fraser and Greem respectively. As Knights and subordinates who had followed Leylin from the earliest, their positions were naturally of the highest. After them were housekeeper Old Welker and Roran Hawks Mercenary Group\u2019s leader, Fayern.As for Anna, she awaited behind Leylin silently, like a dutiful serving maid. However, all the people present did not dare think that her status was just that of a maid.Everyone knew that Anna was exceptionally favoured by this Young Master. Not only could she see Leylin regularly, but she even held the key to the gold vault! It incited a few, feeble grumbles from Old Welker, but Leylin did not care.After Leylin had purchased the land here, Fayern had moved his whole family over, and turned into a truthfully loyal subordinate of Leylin.After which it was Roran Hawks Mercenary Group. The contract with them matured not long ago. Half of the mercenaries continued to stay on under the generous conditions that Leylin had provided.Many others sat on the long table, but Leylin was only familiar with these few. The others merely looked familiar to Leylin, but Leylin knew of their faces and names, which he could remember by relying on the A.I. Chip.Leylin never bothered about the trifles of regular livelihood. The pathway to being a Magus already expended a huge amount of his concentration. He absolutely could not allocate any of his concentration on other matters.Of course, Leylin\u2019s outward mannerisms were similar to that of many magicians. It also fit with how regular humans expected from magicians.In the hearts of all the people on the South Coast, magicians were a group of people who wielded mysterious powers, but they were extremely solitary. They often resided in dark woods or concealed marshes. Only when they needed ingredients and other items, would they leave their dwelling.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dThe masses around the long table stood up and bowed.* Ding! * Leylin used the silver spoon and tapped on the glass in front of him, giving off a crisp noise.\u201cEveryone! By calling you all out here today, is because I have something to announce to everyone!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes swept the crowd. As of now, his Spiritual Force had already reached 13.1, and the mysterious gaze of his eyes was awe-inspiring; it was as if his eyes had been chiseled from the highest grade jewels. Anyone who was looked at by him would experience a sharp pain in their eyes, and tears would involuntarily leak out.Even if it was Greem or Fraser, they could only bow their heads low at this moment.\u201cPlease give your orders, Young Master!\u201d\u201cI will leave for a period of time, and there will be no set date on returning. When I am not around, the medicinal shop and daily matters of the manor would all be decided by Anna, Greem and Fraser.\u201dLeylin looked at the masses below him and said slowly.\u201cWhat?\u201d A bout of commotion sparked, and immediately the group whispered fervently to each other, as they used strange gazes to look at the trio of Anna, Greem and Fraser.Greem and Fraser could tolerate being the focus of numerous eyes. However, as a woman, Anna was somewhat uneasy as she twisted and clutched at her dress.\u201cSilence!\u201d Leylin knocked on the silver glass again, and the crowd turned silent.\u201cFrom today onwards, the words from those 3 would be the same as mine. Any decision of theirs must be completely obeyed and carried out by you.\u201d\u201cWe obey!\u201d Although Leylin did not usually bother himself with many matters, the imposing aura coming from him was extremely immense. There were also rumours flying around that he was part of the Mysterious Entity, which made his subordinates\u2019 reverence towards him even greater.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sound of clanging cutlery continuously rang.Ever since Leylin had issued his orders, the hall was much more silent than before. Although the dinner was sumptuous, the masses seemed to have something weighing down on their hearts.After dinner, Leylin received the trio which knew of his magician identity.Greem and Fraser wore leather armour, which looked extremely imposing. Anna still wore a low cut blouse, and appeared even more seductive.\u201cYou guys know that I am a magician. Right now, I am about to embark on a journey, and due to some reasons, I can only keep you guys here\u2026.\u201dLeylin sat behind the desk, speaking solemnly to the three of them.\u201cThe orders outside earlier were only for the others to see. From now onwards, Greem and Fraser, you must treat Anna the same way you treat me, do you understand?\u201cWe understand!\u201d Greem and Fraser nodded their heads. Compared to the rest, they knew how terrifying this master of theirs was and had no objections towards Leylin\u2019s orders.After sending Greem and Fraser away, the room was only left with Anna and Leylin.\u201cYoung\u2026Young Master!\u201d Tears welled up in Anna\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe Mandara Flower\u2019s essence on your body, I have already created an antidote for it. Also, take these!\u201d Towards his own women, Leylin was much gentler.Saying so, Leylin handed over some potions and a parchment paper over to Anna.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d Anna opened the parchment paper to have a look, and she became startled.\u201cThese are letters of authority. You will be managing all of my establishments in Extreme Night City. Furthermore, if I don\u2019t return within ten years, all of these will be transferred over to your name!\u201dLeylin crossed his fingers, \u201cFurthermore, Murphy and Viscount Jackson are witnesses to these procedures! If you meet with any trouble in the future, you can seek their aid!\u201dThese worldly possessions, Leylin could have as many as he wanted. Naturally he would not mind giving them to Anna as a backup plan for himself.Moreover, even if he played this chess piece wrongly, there wasn\u2019t much to be regretful about.After all, right now, Leylin was only an acolyte in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. According to the academy\u2019s rules, acolytes are not allowed to bring their followers or maids into the academy compounds.Since these are things which he had to eventually let go of, naturally, Leylin\u2019s heart did not ache for them.\u201cAlso, this is the desert scorpion sting, which is a tool specially used to control Greem and Fraser. You must keep them well\u2026.\u201dLeylin handed over a red box to Anna.\u201cNo!\u201d Anna bit her lips, before finally pouncing forward and hugging both of Leylin\u2019s legs. \u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t chase Anna away! Anna wants to be by Young Master\u2019s side no matter what she has to do, alright?\u201dThe young lady held onto Leylin\u2019s legs and tears as bright as pearls slid off of her beautiful face.Her warm and mildly shuddering body wrapped itself around Leylin\u2019s legs. One could see that Anna had mustered extreme courage to speak these words.Leylin looked at Anna with a touch of gentleness in his eyes. He reached his right hand out and stroked the young lady\u2019s hair and back.\u201cI\u2019m very sorry Anna. The place I have to go is extremely dangerous for you\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d Anna lifted her face filled with tears as if wanting to say something else.\u201cDon\u2019t mess around, listen!\u201d Suddenly, Leylin\u2019s face hardened.Seeing her master act this way, the deeply ingrained pain and suffering for disobeying a master\u2019s orders surfaced in her mind. After all, Anna had undergone slave training. Although these were the methods of the slave traders, it was etched right into Anna\u2019s soul itself.\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201d Anna stopped her crying and kept the scroll and box. She only looked at Leylin, the same way as a\u00a0cat that had been abandoned by its owner.Seeing the girl act like this, Leylin withdrew a few potions from his robes and handed it to her. After all, he was not a stone-hearted person.\u201cThis is a recovery potion, which can quickly heal physical wounds. Keep this well!\u201d\u201cAlso, this purple potion is an attack type potion. If there comes a day when you encounter a danger that not even Greem nor Fraser can handle, throw this out at it. Do you understand me?\u201dLeylin pointed at the purple potion and instructed Anna.\u201cAnna understands!\u201d Her eyes turned red. She knew that she could not disobey her master\u2019s orders, so she kept the potion well.\u201cSigh\u2026.\u201dLooking at her leaving figure, Leylin sighed suddenly.Although he had made many preparations, he knew that after a dozen odd years, this faction that he had left would most lightly disappear into thin air.However, he had no regrets. These were all regular humans without any aptitude for becoming a magician. They would be of limited use to him in the future.Most likely, the only use of this small faction to him would be to act as a cover for him to hide from people, and even then, it wasn\u2019t very secure at all.In the end, entrusting everything to Anna was not a bad choice.Apart from the Mandara Flower\u2019s essence on Anna\u2019s body, all other restrictions on Anna\u2019s body had already been removed by Leylin. From now onward, Anna would be a free human.\u201cI hope that after having these things, you will be able to live a happier life!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes were unreadable.If Anna was to land in the hands of another magician, she would at most be a tool for them to vent their pent up energy. After their interest wanes, she may very well be used in an experiment. Now that Anna had followed Leylin, not only was she free from her status as a slave, Leylin had even saved her from the poison of Mandara Flower\u2019s essence. He had even given her the manor and medicinal shop, so no matter what happens next, he would be free from all guilt!\u201d\u201cThe troublesome matters have all been resolved. What\u2019s left is to finally dispose of the experiment lab and underground cells thoroughly!\u201dLeylin thought and got up to go to the underground.This was the forbidden area that he had demarcated. Anna and the two Knights would not dare come down here so easily.Under the dim light from the torch, Leylin withdrew a crystal ball. An old person\u2019s figure could be seen within it. His expression was crazed, and even had terror in it.\u201cWe meet again, Mister Roman!\u201d Leylin smiled and gave his salutations. However, in Roman\u2019s eyes, this smile was more harrowing than the devil\u2019s.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t come over!\u201d Roman\u2019s expression twisted, and he fearfully backed up to the walls of the crystal ball behind him.However, Leylin\u2019s acute senses picked out the resolution behind the expression of the frightened vengeful spirit.\u201cLet me tell you a piece of good news, and a piece of bad news!\u201dLeylin proficiently placed many tools beside the crystal ball, and let the vengeful spirit let out ear piercing screams as he spoke.\u201cThe good news is that I am going to leave here for a while!\u201d Before the vengeful spirit had any response, Leylin smiled and said, \u201cAnd the bad news is that no matter where I go, you will be going along with me!\u201d\u201cOh! No! No! I beg of you\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlright! So then, tell me everything you know!\u201dAt the beginning, Roman naturally would not speak of anything. However after over a year of torture, he had already begun to cough out some information.After the narration of the vengeful spirit, Leylin shook his head. \u201cIt seems like Mister Roman still harbours wishful thoughts, so let us continue\u2026.\u201dFollowing Leylin\u2019s statement, many hair-raising screams filled the lab, as if the howls of a person right before their death.Although this vengeful spirit had showed signs of a mental breakdown half a month ago, it still managed to give misleading information to Leylin regarding the secrets he knew.This vengeful spirit gave much information at once, and it was extremely complicated. However, with the A.I. Chip, Leylin was able to record all of its narration quickly, and sort it systematically.The next few times, he discovered a problem.Towards things which are pertaining to more general and common knowledge, Roman always handed them over easily. However, towards the crucial points and secrets, Roman glossed over them and hid much of the important information.However, Leylin did not mind at all. It would give huge amounts of information each day. Along with the filtering and sorting of the A.I. Chip, he would still obtain plenty of information.Moreover, with the continuous and prolonged torture and interrogating, Leylin believed that one day, this vengeful spirit would tell him everything, and pray for a fast death.After the daily routine of \u2018questioning\u2019 was completed, Leylin went towards the other rooms underground.In here, various blood-stained torture instruments were hung along the walls. On the floor, there were even a few corpses with wounds littered across their bodies, causing them to be almost indiscernible as a human body.[Beep! The surrounding negative energy density is higher by 34.5%, which satisfies the most basic condition for a spirit body\u2019s existence. The target\u2019s physical body has undergone various suffering and tortures. Chance of spirit body appearing: 1.23%]The A.I. Chip scanned the few corpses and reported the figures.\u201cCompared to the one-thousandth chance of a spirit body forming naturally, this proportion can be considered extremely high already!\u201d Leylin stroked his chin, \u201cIf I were to be given more time, I would definitely be able to induce the formation of an artificial spirit body!\u201dThe most efficient way to do research on souls was through the use of spirit bodies. This established theory was publicly accepted by all Dark Magi.What Leylin had to do now was to continuously simulate the conditions of the outside world, and induce the forming of an artificial spirit body!If this piece of news were to leak out, Leylin\u2019s reputation would be completely interlinked with savagery and ruthlessness, which would be bad for his future developments.\u201cReputation is also a kind of benefit! Although I\u2019m not afraid of how people view me, even Magi wish to have dealings with those who have good reputations, but not a fellow with a dredged reputation.Leylin sucked in a lungful of air and sprinkled power on the corpses.With hissing sounds, the corpses turned into yellow pus after corroding, and very soon, they disappeared.\u201cAlthough I have finally stopped my experiments, which is a little bit of a pity, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t obtained any results!\u201d Leylin comforted himself, \u201cAt least, regarding the Lowian Academy Teachings\u2019 final step, the spirit awakening, I have already obtained sufficient data!\u201dAs for the other ancient potion formula, Tears of Mary, Leylin still hadn\u2019t found any clues regarding it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This turned into an idle conversation topic discussed by commoners after lunch tea.Mister Leylin, an heir of a noble who had stayed in the city for three years and Viscount Jackson and Scholar Murphy\u2019s good friend, was temporarily leaving Extreme Night City.Before he left, he actually handed over the manor and medicinal shop to his serving attendant, a maid, to handle the running.For nobles, although they did vent their pent up energy on their serving maids frequently, they would never have handed over important establishments and such over to them because of this act.After all, to them, maids were like toys, which could be changed or abandoned at any time. As for establishments and lands, they would often become the inheritance of an heir, and was the root for the growth of a family\u2019s continual development.By doing this, Leylin had turned into a joke in front of the rest of the nobility. Not only did his reputation contain a lazy and kind person, it also extended to a muddle-headed trademark.However, to the surprise of many, the maid, with the help of two Knights, very soon made the remainder of Leylin\u2019s faction submit to her. At the same time, Viscount Jackson City Lord and Murphy stepped in personally to express their support for the maid, which allowed her to act on Leylin\u2019s behalf with his establishments.After taking over Leylin\u2019s establishments, Anna dedicated herself to managing them and did it neatly and tidily. Not only did Leylin\u2019s establishment in Extreme Night City not fail as predicted by the other nobles, it continually developed, which made many nobles fall from their chair.However, all of these things had nothing to do with Leylin. At this moment, he had long since left Extreme Night City.* Pitter Patter! *The sky turned dark, and bean sized drops of rain fell on the ground, initiating countless splashes.* Thud Thud Thud! * A dark, handsome steed continually dashed along the road, and the scenery on both sides hurriedly retreated. Rainwater fell onto the body of a Knight, but was blocked by a raincoat.By the time when it was midnight, the downpour stopped, and the Knight sought shelter in a cave.A warm and bright flame illuminated the cave. A steel wok hung above the bonfire, and a white mushroom broth with a fragrant smell boiled. From time to time, a few pieces of meat jerky floated to the surface.The Knight took off his coat, revealing a young face with brown hair and eyes that glittered like jewels.This person was Leylin. At this moment, he drank the mushroom soup, while time bringing out a map from the A.I. Chip.\u201cAfter two months of continuous journeying, I am finally going to arrive at the academy!\u201dLeylin looked at the destination on the map. His expression was complicated. Previously, if not for him constantly changing his route and going to other markets to sell his potions, he wouldn\u2019t have been in such a rush, and the journey would have been a breeze.However, with such a hastened journey, he had suffered plenty.After having lived like a king for the past 3 years, Leylin had gotten used to the extravagant life of a noble, and almost could not adapt to his current situation.\u201cHowever, I have finally arrived. According to the map, I will arrive at the academy after three more days!\u201d\u201cI never thought that a third party would actually intervene, and make the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy and the other two factions come to a ceasefire agreement!\u201dRecalling the news that he heard from the markets in the past few days, Leylin was still somewhat in disbelief.According to the news, with the pincer attack from the Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy should have been in a precarious situation. Even the academy headquarters\u2019 defensive spell formation was damaged by half and was almost broken.However, in the end, it was unknown what method the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy chairman used. He had actually managed to appeal for help from the Lighthouse of the Night.The Lighthouse of the Night was one of the finest organisations in the South Coast. Its leader was rumoured to have the strength of a Rank 3 Magus.Under the forceful mediation of the Lighthouse of the Night, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy finally managed to escape from its dangerous situation, eventually reaching a treaty between the two rivaling factions.Leylin was not someone who would immediately respond when he was requested to return to the academy. Along the way, he always inquired for news. Only when he was indeed certain that Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was freed from war, and that the recalling of the acolytes was not a trap, did he decide to return to the academy.\u201cWith this distance, I can already initiate the communicative method that mentor showed me before! It\u2019s best to first discern the truth!\u201dLeylin\u2019s face turned serious, and he withdrew a pink coloured potion from his robes.After removing the plug, he used the pink coloured potion to draw a mysterious rune on the ground. It was cursive and winding, like a worm.* Sssii! * Pink smoke rose into the air continuously, before finally turning into the shape of a large pink ear.\u201cWho is this? This energy wave?\u201d Beside the ear, Kroft\u2019s voice sounded, carrying many other static noises with it.\u201cIt\u2019s me! Professor!\u201d Leylin spoke softly.\u201cThis voice! These Spiritual Force waves! You are Leylin! You have actually become a Level 3 Acolyte!\u201d Astonishment could be heard in Kroft\u2019s voice.For third grade acolytes, if they wanted to advance from a Level 2 Acolyte to a Level 3 Acolyte, it often required at least 5 years of constructing the mind runes and reinforcing of the sea of consciousness.However, Leylin had spent only 3 years to advance to a Level 3 Acolyte, which shocked Kroft.\u201cYou are only 17 this year, yet you have entered the realm of a Level 3 Acolyte!\u201d Kroft\u2019s voice, which was usually stable, carried a trace of excitement in it, \u201cAn acolyte who is Level 3 before the age of 20 often has an extremely huge chance of advancing to an official Magus. However, the numbers of such acolytes are extremely rare. Even your senior, Merlin, only advanced to a Level 3 Acolyte when he was 21.If Kroft knew that Leylin had advanced to a Level 3 Acolyte only 1 year after he had left the academy, he might immediately label him as a genius!However, striking it rich silently was always Leylin\u2019s norm of handling his affairs. Towards his mentor\u2019s astonishment, Leylin only bowed and said, \u201cI was only lucky, and found a rare Void Flower \u2026.\u201dA Void Flower was a type of mysterious plant. Its petals were purple, and it if a magician were to raise it, it would be an extremely strong stimulant towards a magician\u2019s Spiritual Force. The most crucial point was that the laws of reproduction for the Void Flower were strange. they could appear at any place on the continent. There were even cases in which magicians found traces of these plants at the bottom of the sea or in a pit of a volcano.Moreover, the Void Flower had a special attribute. Once its petals were plucked, the whole stalk will immediately combust, leaving no traces behind.Naturally, this was an excuse that Leylin thought of long ago. Through the A.I. Chip\u2019s data gathering of various mysterious plants, he had already prepared this excuse as a reason for his advancement.It was not like there weren\u2019t any other Level 2 Acolytes who had used a Void Flower to advance to a Level 3 Acolyte before.\u201cVoid Flower?\u201d Kroft\u2019s shock was relayed through the ear. \u201cSuch a precious magician resource could also be found by you\u2026 That is a top grade material of which one petal can cost several thousands of Magic Crystals\u2026. It can even aid a magician in advancing\u2026.\u201dHowever, it was extremely difficult to predict luck in this world. After sticking to his statement that the Void Flower was indeed used up, Kroft had no other choice but to believe him.What followed next was that the mentor and student spoke of Leylin\u2019s recent journeying experiences. When Kroft learned that Leylin had successfully completed the mission from the academy, he expressed his congratulations.Towards the end, Leylin asked in a solemn tone, \u201cProfessor, regarding the recalling of the acolytes to the academy\u2026..\u201dWhy he did not ask the academy directly was, naturally, because he was afraid that it would be a trap. It may have very well been that the chairman of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had some other plans, and might be prepared to sacrifice a bunch of acolytes.\u201c\u2026.\u201d Kroft remained silent on the other side of the communication spell, before finally speaking again some time later.\u201cThe recall of acolytes, this time, had indeed been approved by the chairman and board of directors. I can assure you that there is no lie in the recall, but\u2026.\u201dLeylin hesitated and held his breath, afraid to disturb his mentor.\u201cOriginally, if you were still a Level 2 Acolyte, I would most likely have not approved of you returning to the academy. However, now that you are a Level 3 Acolyte, things are different. Let me ask you, do you wish to advance to an official Magus?\u201dKroft asked suddenly.\u201cA Rank 1 Magus. It is often the starting point for a Magus who pursues the truth. I definitely want to advance!\u201d Leylin\u2019s voice was low.\u201cIf that is the case, then come back! When you\u2019re here, I\u2019ll tell you everything! There isn\u2019t much time now\u2026.\u201d The pink ear shuddered and exploded immediately, turning into a huge cloud of smoke as it dissipated into the air.In the empty cave, Kroft\u2019s voice finally resounded one last time, \u201cHeed my words! This opportunity is extremely rare but is also accompanied by danger. If you wish to walk further down the path of a Magus, then hurry back!\u201dLeylin looked at the gradually disappearing smoke and muttered to himself.Through the long distance communication with Kroft today, although time was short, Leylin was able to understand the circumstances within the academy.From this, he knew that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had indeed extricated itself from danger but the war seemed to still be ongoing. This was why the academy forcefully recalled its acolytes back.Moreover, opportunities often came hand in hand with risks. Looking at Kroft\u2019s opinion, it seemed that plenty of opportunities would await him if he returned. It even related to the advancement that Leylin would have to undergo in the future.\u201cAn official Magus!\u201dLeylin walked towards the entrance of the cave, and looked at the downcast sky and pitter-patter sounds of the downpour, letting out a sigh.These few days, apart from making haste, he did nothing else but to go to a few magician markets to have a look. However, no matter how many Magic Crystals he was willing to part with, the market never contained any information pertaining to the advancement of an official Magus. Moreover, no one even sold a method of obtaining such information.Looking at it, it seemed as though a large, invisible hand had directly hauled all of the information regarding official Magi away, not letting anyone else know of it.\u201cTo be able to monopolise the information to such an extent, it must be supported by, at least, a majority of magicians within the large organisations and factions in the South Coast\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moreover, even the academy has strictly regulated the information given for an acolyte to advance into a Level 3 Acolyte. . . \u201dLeylin, who came from another world, naturally saw through these methods of sealing away information.However, compared to those high and mighty Magi, Leylin was currently but an ant. Even if he saw through it, there was no way that he could resist it.After all, Leylin was only a Level 3 Acolyte, and not even an official Magus!\u201cThere is definitely information in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy regarding the experience of advancement to a Rank 1 Magus, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not something that I can obtain easily! It\u2019s a pity, but this is already the most probable situation I can think of\u2026.\u201dLeylin looked at the distant raindrops, sinking into deep thoughts.After the harrowing experience of advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte, Leylin was rather traumatic over the incident. Before making preparations fully and obtaining enough information, he would definitely not dare to breakthrough into an official Magus.For magicians, the step to become an official Magus, from an acolyte, was the most crucial step, and no mistakes could be allowed.Leylin was, however, unable to discover any information pertaining to this. Furthermore, to obtain this information, he could only plan to seize it from an official Magus.However, the strength of official Magi far exceeded that of a Level 3 Acolyte. Not to mention that the defensive force field surrounding the official Magi which the A.I. Chip had detected. Leylin had no means, even now, to break through it. The difficulty of obtaining information on advancement from an official Magus had long surpassed Leylin\u2019s limits. Only if Leylin was mad would he proceed with it.As for what Leylin knew, obtaining information on the advancement was the most appropriate method.\u201cAccording to the news that Kroft had hinted at earlier, although it might be rather dangerous at this time, it is also the best chance to obtain these resources and information!\u201dLeylin looked at the raging thunderstorm outside and suddenly steeled his heart.Although he was someone who treasured his life dearly, in this situation where his path seemed bleak, he could only muster up courage, and take a gamble!Right now, he was at the optimal age to advance to an official Magus. Once he missed this chance, even if he could obtain resources and information in future, it would be unlikely that his aged body would support him through the breakthrough to a Rank 1 Magus.Moreover, it was not as though he did not have any confidence. At the very least, according to his own hypothesis and the A.I. Chip\u2019s simulations, there was, at least, a 90% chance that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy required him to fulfill some sort of dangerous mission, and hence, would not sacrifice him! This was enough for him to take a gamble!\u201cI\u2019ll take a gamble this once! If I am unable to scale the absolute peak and observe the radiance from the rays of dawn, then let me be sludge and sink thoroughly into the earth, and rot!\u201dHis eyes sparkled as he gazed intensely at the thunderstorm raging in front of him.\u2026\u2026Three days later, in the outer vicinity of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.More than half of the surrounding forests around the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had already been destroyed. The ground was filled with traces of holes and depressions. Not far away, a few patches of the ground were white in colour, and on top of it were some rubble and ashes. From these, one could surmise what kind of bitter battle the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had gone through!\u201cIt was actually reduced to a state like this\u2026.\u201d Leylin rode the large horse and dashed ahead, feeling absolutely gleeful that he had made an unwavering decision to leave the academy beforehand.It had been such a massive battle that it had actually even ruined half of the geography around the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. If Leylin were to remain here, he did not have any confidence in protecting his life.Following the path and traveling on for another dozen minutes, a huge graveyard appeared before Leylin\u2019s eyes.This was the underground entrance to the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, a large granite graveyard. However, right now, half of the tombstones were shattered, and many graves were also dug open, revealing the dark passages within. The surrounding stone walls and mud reflected signs having been abused by many spells. Before Leylin\u2019s eyes, the alert of the A.I. Chip continuously sounded, revealing the extremely high radiation from some traces of these spells.\u201cEvery little tombstone here was actually a personal passageway for each professor in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy and all are now in such ruins\u2026.\u201dAlthough he long knew that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy would definitely suffer a catastrophic loss, this miserable scene still caused Leylin to inhale a mouthful of cold ai* Bang! *Leylin casually kicked a stone on the floor, and walked towards the centremost area of the graveyard, where a huge tombstone that looked like a castle was erected.This was the huge entrance to Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, and was the common path for all acolytes.The surface of the castle was littered with cracks, and part of the topmost area was chipped off. What remained was tottering, and seemed to be on the verge of collapse. Seeing such a sight made Leylin somewhat worried; he felt that if he were to stick a finger out and poke it, this castle of a tombstone would crumble.\u201cHalt! Outsider! If you are unable to show any items of proof, I will make you pay the price of blood!\u201dThe two stone statues by the large entrance were completely destroyed. The Winged Earthworm and Two-Headed Dog from before were now gone. Right when Leylin wanted to enter, a metallic voice sounded.Accompanying that voice, a large shadow from the peak of the ashened castle climbed down at a rapid speed. This black figure was taller by an average human by two heads, and its hands were extremely long, extending to the ground.Although the castle tombstone was filled with cracks, no matter how this black figure climbed, the castle did not waver an inch. Obviously, the construction of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was not as weak as it seemed on the surface.* Bang! * The black figure leapt, and a huge shadow was projected on the ground, completely engulfing Leylin.* Thud! * The black figure pounded on the ground, bringing up a layer of dust.Leylin squinted and finally saw the appearance of the black figure. This was a large ape-like creature. Its whole body was layered with granite, and both of its hands propped itself up on the ground.[Beep! A creature with high levels of energy has been detected. Now comparing to database. Determined as Granite Ape!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.Granite Ape was a creature in the Magus World with a battle strength comparable to an official Magus.\u201cI sense the energy waves emanating from the item of proof on your body, take it out!\u201dThe Granite Ape looked at Leylin, and sniffed him with its large snout. As the ape approached, an extremely dense and putrid stench wafted over. Leylin had to muster up a lot of strength to endure the need to frown.\u201cItem of proof?\u201dLeylin thought for a while, before hurriedly withdrawing the red metal card from his sack that he obtained before when taking up the mission.\u201cSo it was this!\u201dThe Granite Ape took the metal card and swallowed it in one gulp, as if munching on some delicacy. It even closed its eyes to savour the taste of it.\u201cIt\u2019s an acolyte of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy who took on an outside mission previously!\u201dAfter a dozen seconds, the Granite Ape opened its large eyes and said to Leylin, \u201cBrat, enter!\u201d\u201cPlease accept my offerings!\u201d Leylin thought, and bowed before the Granite Ape, before taking a bunch of banana like fruits and placing it on the ground.\u201cElephant Stout Bananas! Not bad, not bad!\u201d The large ape nodded its head, and took one from the bunch and peeled it, before tossing it into its mouth, as if it could not wait.\u201cCan I ask what happened to the two guardians from before?\u201dLeylin asked cautiously, after seeing the Granite Ape enjoying itself.\u201cThey\u2019re dead!\u201d The large ape answered concisely, and Leylin gasped silently.This was something that he had long guessed. The two statues were obviously the first line of defense for the academy. After being attacked, they would easily be the first to perish.After another bow, Leylin entered through the entrance of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.The dimly lit flight of downward stairs was the same as from before, when Leylin had left the academy.However, for some unknown reason \u2013 which may have been the fact that he was now a Level 3 Acolyte with a greater Spiritual Force \u2013 Leylin discovered that there were a few marks on the walls and stones, with some traces of blood. There were even some faint wails of spirits who had perished, which travelled to Leylin\u2019s ears.Leylin, who had conducted a massive amount of experiments on spirit bodies, would never mistake these noises for something else.Along the way, he noticed that he had run into far fewer acolytes than he did normally. Leylin estimated that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy didn\u2019t even have half of its original strength. Even the Trading Post and Mission Area hotspots seemed to be devoid of people.At the mission desk counter, Leylin handed over the records in the crystal ball and a piece of the Great Snake Mankestre\u2019s scales.\u201cI\u2019m here to complete a mission!\u201d\u201cAlright, please hold on!\u201d The staff at the counter had changed too. This was a freckled girl, who seemed to only be a Level 2 Acolyte.While he was waiting, Leylin was bored to death, and looked at his surroundings.Although the number of people in the Mission Area had been greatly reduced, the number of missions did not reduce but increased instead. Moreover, many of them had increased rewards compared to before. According to Leylin\u2019s guess, while the difficulty of these missions had remained the same, the rewards had increased to twice of what they were originally.This was an abnormal scene, which made Leylin\u2019s eyes flash.\u201cLey\u2026Leylin!\u201d A muffled yet hoarse voice sounded behind Leylin.Leylin turned around and saw a swollen figure wrapped in a black veil. Moreover, the stench of pus drifted over.\u201cYou are\u2026 Nyssa!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes widened.Naturally he recalled this image clearly, but even if he didn\u2019t, the A.I. Chip had recorded it.\u201cYou actually still remember me!\u201d Nyssa\u2019s voice had a tinge of excitement. At the same time, an energy wave leaked from her body. According to the A.I. Chip, she was actually a Level 2 Acolyte.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He still remembered this unfortunate girl and the grief and perseverance on this girl\u2019s face before.\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see you again, how are Guricha and Dodoria?\u201dLeylin smiled.Hearing this, Nyssa who was wrapped in the black cloak shuddered, and her voice was gloomy as she said, \u201cThey\u2019re all dead. Even Kaliweir, Beirut, the ones who came with us from the Chernobyl Islands, more than half of them perished\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy apologies\u2026.\u201dLeylin did not know what he ought to say. Although he did divulge a bit of information previously, it was extremely obscure. Whether or not Kaliweir and the rest could figure it out, and if they could view it solemnly were all matters of uncertainty.Moreover, even if they discovered that something was amiss, they were only first or second grade acolytes without much aptitude. Whether or not they could obtain discriminating treatment from the academy and leave was also difficult to say.As expected, Nyssa continued, \u201cAfter getting news from you, we\u2019d came together several times. However, there were no good measures. Not long later, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy announced a lockdown of the whole academy, otherwise, death would be granted\u2026 Afterwards, the war began\u2026.\u201dOfficial Magi were the core strength of the war between both sides. Kaliweir, together with the others who weren\u2019t even Level 3 Acolytes were not fit to be cannon fodder, so heavy casualties were to be expected.Leylin could not think of any consoling words. Nyssa too did not continue, and silence ensued.\u201cMission recorded and confirmed as completed! This is your reward, please check and accept!\u201dAt this moment, the freckled girl from behind the counter had finally raised her head, and scribbled on a piece of parchment paper with a feather quill, finally handing over a small leather sack to Leylin.Leylin weighed the sack, and rubbing noises between Magic Crystals came travelling from the leather sack.\u201cI still have something on, so I\u2019ll take my leave first!\u201dLeylin said to Nyssa, leaving her with a complicated expression on her face.\u201cMission is completed, time to meet with Mentor!\u201dLeylin walked through the gardens and came to the experiment lab where Kroft was.* Dong Dong Dong! *Leylin knocked on the door, following which, the door creaked open, revealing a pretty girl.The girl was slightly shorter than Leylin by half a head and had beautiful, green hair. Her body contours were extremely seductive. Due to the proximity, Leylin could even catch a whiff of her perfume.\u201cBicky! It\u2019s been a long time!\u201d Leylin spoke softly.\u201cYou are\u2026 Leylin!\u201d The green-haired girl sized up Leylin suspiciously with a glance, before cheering as she leapt into his arms.Feeling the soft perky abundance against his chest, and the fragrance that wafted into his nose, Leylin could not help but exclaim at this little girl having matured.\u201cAlright! I am here to visit Kroft!\u201dLeylin waited for a good while, and seeing that the girl did not want to leave his embrace, he could only he cajole her while patting her on the shoulders.\u201cMentor is just inside, together with Merlin!\u201d Bicky rubbed her somewhat reddened eyes, and her delicate features revealed a smile, \u201cYou being alright is really a great thing\u2026.\u201dLeylin nodded his head and walked into the experiment lab.\u201cLeylin!\u201d Merlin greeted him first. His features did not change much from the past 3 years, only that his temperament seemed more stable and mature. After seeing Leylin, he forced an extremely ugly smile.\u201cSenior Merlin!\u201d Leylin bowed. His knew that a part of Merlin\u2019s face had suffered from irreparable damage from before, so he did not mind that he was unable to portray common expressions.After which, Leylin continued walking in.There was only an experiment table in here. On the operating table, a white-haired, middle-aged man placed the test tube in his hands down, and his pair of golden eyes met Leylin\u2019s eyes.\u201cI can smell the barely faint smell of the Void Flower in your body, it seems like you really got the petals of a Void Flower!\u201dKroft stared at Leylin for some time, before smiling, \u201cYou\u2019re really a lucky fellow!\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Leylin scratched the back of his head, revealing an embarrassed expression, but deep down he was elated.After deciding to use the Void Flower as an excuse, he had been concocting the substitute ingredients for the Void Flower.99.98%After huge amounts of experiments, he had obtained a type of potion which could emit the scent of the Void Flower with a similarity of 99.98%, to use as his trump card to fool others.Of course, this potion only had a similar fragrance to the Void Flower, but it did not contain any effect of the original Void Flower at all.Before coming to the academy, Leylin had especially sprayed some of it on his body, and now it seemed that even Kroft was fooled.After which, Leylin only had to insist that the effect of the Void Flower was fully consumed by him, then nobody would be able to discover any gaps in his speech.\u201cNo matter what, achieving Level 3 Acolyte before you are 20, you can already be considered as one of the core acolytes in the academy. Only that you have to go to the Administrative Area to register, then your various welfares and statuses will increase\u2026.\u201dKroft told Leylin about some benefits and authority given to a Level 3 Acolyte, which would be awarded to Leylin.Finally, Leylin could hardly wait any longer and blurted out, \u201cProfessor, this time, I\u2019m here to ask about the matter of the official Magus that you spoke of previously\u2026.\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d Kroft nodded, \u201cEver since I saw you after your first meditation, I knew that you are resolute on the path of a Magus\u2026.\u201dThe white-haired, middle-aged man pointed at the chairs in the lab, \u201cRegarding this, it might take a while, so let us sit first.\u201dSaying which, Kroft walked towards a recliner and sat down, with Leylin following behind him.The black chair was draped with the leather of some creature, and running your hands across it gave a comfortable feeling. Between the two chairs, there was a small round table.Bicky served two hot, steaming cups of green refreshments\u2013- her actions was of the official standard as if she had practiced serving innumerable times\u2013- and hurriedly retreated.\u201cGreen Root Fruit Juice! I never thought that Professor would still keep this habit!\u201d Leylin sniffed the fragrance, and his eyes reflected reminiscence.\u201cHaha\u2026 I have always liked these kinds of drinks, even when I\u2019m idle or when doing experiments, I will still take a sip or two. Moreover, for an official Magus, 3 years is only a short time in their life!\u201dKroft made several sips of the drink and then asked, \u201cLeylin, do you know how to advance to an official Magus?\u201d\u201cPlease show me the way, Mentor!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression was extremely solemn.\u201cAn official Magus has long since overcome the limitations of a human. They are able to harness the nature\u2019s energy and obtain a longer lifespan. Even the worst official Magus is far beyond that of a Level 3 Acolyte! They are extraordinary!\u201dKroft\u2019s voice sounded mellow, almost as if he were singing.\u201cThis is because of the energy and devastating strength that an official Magus controls. A long time\u2013- maybe a thousand odd years ago, on the Luxe Castle of the South Coast, all magisterium in the South Coast have come to a mutual agreement to control the information about official Magi, and have even endorsed it\u2026\u201dKroft spoke of the past history of the Magus World.\u201cNo matter what it is similar to the non-proliferation treaty of nuclear weapons of my previous world!\u201d thought Leylin.\u201cFrom then on, before a Level 3 Acolyte advanced to an official Magus, they will sign a contract with the person or organisation imparting the knowledge to them. To promise that there will be in no way the concrete steps of advancing into an official Magus will be divulged. Any violators will accept the judgment of the Trial\u2019s Eye, and his soul to be scorched for a thousand years\u2026.\u201dKroft looked at Leylin, \u201cI too have signed the contract before, hence I was able to obtain the resources and information needed for advancement. Due to the restrictions of this contract, I am unable to share the information with you!\u201d\u201cHowever, I can still tell you of some general knowledge around it!\u201d Seeing the obviously disappointed face of Leylin, Kroft continued.\u201cTo advance to an official Magus, the first requirement is for the acolyte to reach a certain standard in the Spiritual Force. From what I see, you are very close to this criteria already. Actually, for many Level 3 Acolyte, this is not a problem at all.\u201cAs for the real crux, it is to have a defensive spell model of a Rank 1 Spell. This model will become your Innate Defensive Spell in the future. Also, you need a standard amount of Grine Water to complement with the breakthrough!\u201dLeylin listened attentively, and various emotions flashed across his eyes, \u201cSo then, the criteria to advance would be these three: A certain level of Spiritual Force, a defensive Rank 1 Spell and Grine Water! Right?\u201d\u201cIndeed!\u201d Kroft nodded his head, \u201cRank 1 Magus spell models and Grine Water are controlled by the huge factions. Even on the counters of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, you will not be able to find them!\u201dLeylin smiled bitterly. He had already scouted most of the markets in the Poolfield Kingdom. There was absolutely no one place which contained Grine Water or a defensive Rank 1 Spell.From Level 1 Acolyte to Level 2 Acolyte, all that Leylin had learnt were Rank 0 spells. Obviously, the Magi had made clear divisions on the rankings of spells. Moreover, they coined the spells that acolytes learnt as Rank 0 spells, to differentiate between those spells of official Magi.As for Grine Water, Leylin seemed to have seen some information pertaining to it on a ruined draft regarding Potioneering. That was a type of potion that was rather difficult for Leylin with his current abilities to brew. Moreover, many main ingredients were monopolised by the huge factions, and there were no traces of the formula.\u201cSo then, Professor, you asked me to come back, which means that I am able to obtain the Grine Water and defensive Rank 1 Spell?\u201d Leylin suddenly asked.\u201cI can only say that it\u2019s possible.\u201dKroft took another sip of the green refreshment. \u201cAdvancing to a Level 3 Acolyte before you turn 20 is already considered to be a potential Magus. Therefore, you are qualified to sign a contract with the academy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What contract?\u201dLeylin asked.\u201cFirst, you cannot reveal any information regarding the advancement to an official Magus. Furthermore, after you become an official Magus, the contract that you signed when you entered the academy would not impose any restrictions on you anymore. Hence, you must swear upon your soul, under the witness of Trial\u2019s Eye, you will be of service to the academy for 100 years!\u201d\u201cAfter signing the contract, you will be able to obtain a defensive Rank 1 Magus spell for free, and a standard amount of Grine Water!Leylin saw an introduction to Trial\u2019s Eye before on an ancient manual. It seemed to be a massive organism with Rules from a different world. It did not have a consciousness of its own, and magicians preferred to use it as a witness when undertaking important contracts.The effectiveness of its constraints was known to be amongst the strongest of all contracts. Moreover, there was no way to be rid of it.Once an agreement was formed, within the span of a hundred years, even if the academy were to have Leylin sacrifice his life during a battle, he had no choice but to obey.This agreement was similar to a slave contract, yet it had more constraints stipulated in it than in a regular slave contract.Leylin rejected it immediately within his heart. He was a person for valued absolute freedom, so it was rather distasteful for him to be under such constraints.Of course, on the surface, Leylin still pretended to be extremely moved, struggling for an answer.Finally, Leylin asked, with his throat a little parched, \u201cSo, Mentor, did you sign such a contract too?\u201d\u201cIndeed! And because of this, I\u2019ve joined Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, and became a member of the professors!\u201d Kroft gave a definitive reply, \u201cActually, the treatment that the academy gives to Magus like us \u2013 who came from abroad \u2013 is not too bad. They wouldn\u2019t let us take on extremely difficult tasks as well!\u201d\u201cProfessor, asking me to come back to the academy, I\u2019m sure there is some other way?\u201dLeylin looked at Kroft in anticipation.Signing a contract and obtaining resources was a very common practice, and had nothing to do with the current precarious situation the academy was in. Leylin naturally did not assume that Kroft asked him to come back for this.After hearing Leylin\u2019s words, Kroft seemed to be happy. \u201cIndeed, you are still as intelligent as before. Your eyes are also filled with wisdom, if not for your average aptitude, your achievements in future would definitely surpass Merlin\u2019s!\u201dThe fa\u00e7ade of inferiority towards Merlin was put on by Leylin. He smiled, not speaking, waiting to hear what Kroft had to say.\u201cActually, the war of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is not over!\u201dThis sentence of Kroft made Leylin\u2019s hair stand straight.\u201cWhat?\u201d Leylin was so flabbergasted that he stood up immediately, \u201cWas the war not mediated after the Lighthouse of the Night stepped in to stop Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle?\u201d\u201cThis news is indeed accurate but is incomplete. The war between official Magi have ended, but for acolytes it is still far from ending!\u201dKroft smiled wryly.\u201cAlthough Lighthouse of the Night is one of the strongest guilds around, they are not the only one. Behind Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle, there is also a powerful guild supporting them from behind.\u201cHence, under the mediation of Lighthouse of the Night, although the war between both sides has ended, yet there was a special clause!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Leylin could faintly discern that it had something to do with the acolytes, but he still asked.\u201cThe opposing factions have requested us to recall all of our acolytes, and engage in a bloodbath with their acolytes in a secret plane!\u201cSecret plane!? Bloodbath?\u201dTowards Leylin who had abundant information and knowledge, only after searching in the A.I. Chip\u2019s data bank, he found the information he needed regarding those two terms.The secret plane was a dimension used by magicians to protect their own lab and store their resources. It is created by a spell and the dimension is got by connecting to a region from the outside world.Because of the powerful spell effects outside of these secret planes, magicians of the acolyte level could not break into it. As for some higher levelled secret planes, even if official Magi were to enter, they would also perish.With the passing of time, some magician guilds will join forces, using spells to form a temporary secret plane, and conduct some experiments or for war/battle.As for bloodbath, it contained the meaning of madness and massacre.In the Magus World, if two magicians have a huge conflict that could not longer be mediated, only with death they would rest their case. Under these circumstances, they will undergo a bloodbath with a host as a witness!Before the bloodbath, both parties would sign an agreement. After any one side dies, their families, professors and friends may not directly avenge them.This was a kind of battle, but with the effects of spells, the contracts, too, were difficult to breach. Many magicians with dignity would engage in this life and death conflict, yet they did not wish for the collateral damage to spread. So a bloodbath was the best choice.\u201cSo, the academy summoned us acolytes back\u2026.\u201dLeylin suddenly realised that his throat was extremely parched as if he were a person dying from thirst.\u201cDuring the signing of the contract, the other parties have summoned Trial\u2019s Eye as a witness, so our academy could only go according to the stipulated agreement. If not, all of us professors\u2013- including the chairman\u2013- will have our souls resting in eternal peace\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not only you guys, even the other genius fifth-grade acolytes, including your senior Merlin, must participate in this bloodbath. Moreover, the acolytes from each of the 3 academies, will all be at the same place\u2026.\u201d\u201cWait, which is to say, the acolytes from the other two academies will join forces and attack our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy?\u201dLeylin felt rather dizzy, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes have already suffered tremendous casualties from the war before. As for Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle, they were forces with a level similar to Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. If any of these two were to engage in a bloodbath battle with Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s acolytes, it would be 50-50, not to mention there\u2019s two of them now.Moreover, at the moment, there were only 50-60% acolytes remaining behind in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u201cThis is too crazy, why would the academy accept such conditions?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no choice, who asked for our academy to be in such a state? Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle wants to wipe our acolytes out at one go, and let the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s legacy be broken!\u201d Kroft smiled bitterly, \u201cFurthermore, be it our acolytes or the enemies\u2019, they are not allowed to bring in any battle items of official Magus strength. This is programmed into the defensive spell of the secret plane. Any tools which exceed the strength of an acolyte will immediately be rejected upon entering the secret plane\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan I still leave now?\u201d Leylin harboured his tiny glimmer of hope.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Kroft looked at Leylin deeply in the eyes, and the meaning implicated made Leylin quiver.\u201cAlright then!\u201d Leylin resigned to his fate and sat down. \u201cThe bad news is over? You should tell me some good news now!\u201d\u201cYou little brat!\u201d Kroft smiled and shook his head. \u201cBefore the bloodbath, the academy will conduct a competition, where the rewards are bountiful. Moreover, various remuneration have increased by twofold, and the spell models and potions on the sales counter are also at a large discount\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey want to raise the strength of their own acolytes before the bloodbath, huh?\u201d Leylin thought silently. He was a very optimistic person and had already faintly thought of a scenario like this before, unlike the extremely shocked appearance he was putting on right now. Since there is no room for retreat, his brain immediately adapted to the situation.\u201cAll these have nothing to do with the advancement of official Magus. Previous, Mentor has told me that there is a method to advance, could it be inside the bloodbath?\u201d\u201cIndeed! The academy has issued a mission to all Level 3 Acolyte like you for a blood vengeance. You are to massacre as many acolytes as you can inside the bloodbath!\u201dA sign of madness appeared for the first time on Kroft\u2019s bespectacled features.\u201cWe have assigned points on the enemy acolytes, every Level 1 Acolyte is worth 1 contribution points, Level 2 Acolytes are worth 3 points, and Level 3 Acolyte as 10 points. Towards the more noteworthy acolytes, we have corresponding values assigned to them.There was a huge temptation behind Kroft\u2019s words, \u201cThis time the academy\u2019s mission reward is extremely bountiful. If you were to obtain enough contribution points, no matter if it is a Rank 1 Magus defensive spell model or Grine Water, they all can be exchanged for with contribution points!\u201d\u201cThis is the only method that does not require a contract, and still can advance with resources!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s this way\u2026.\u201d Leylin closed his eyes, and quietly pondered of his mentor\u2019s speech.On the surface, Leylin looked calm. In fact, his brain had already begun to ponder over various scenarios, with the A.I. Chip constantly bringing out different simulations, projecting them in front of Leylin.Minutes later, Leylin stood up again and bowed to his Professor Kroft. \u201cIf there is nothing else, please allow me to take my leave!\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Kroft was rather stunned by his own apprentice\u2019s actions.\u201cOf course to see the Trading Post and sales counter!\u201dLeylin bowed again, and after obtaining Kroft\u2019s approval, he left immediately.Walking on an empty school route, Leylin thought over many things. First of all, trying to escape under the noses of various professors of the official Magus Level and then being hunted was something impossible.Leylin only thought briefly, before beginning to toss that notion away.Previously, he was able to escape was because of Kroft\u2019s pointer and his personal capabilities. The largest reason was still that the academy allowed him to leave. If not, regardless of then and now, Leylin would never be able to walk out of the academy\u2019s doors.\u201cCompared to official Magus, it seems like there is more hope in the bloodbath between acolytes, although the situation is still as unfavourable as before!\u201dLeylin walked to the Trading Post. The acolytes here numbered slightly more than other places, but many acolytes still had glum expressions on their faces. It seems that they had already gotten news of the upcoming bloodbath.First, Leylin went to Woox\u2019s store to have a look. A pity, however, the little wooden hut was already gone, and the fatty Woox was not known to have escaped or died.Leylin sighed in disappointment. At the Trading Post, he purchased some ingredients he needed, before walking to the spell models sales counter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Already dead!\u201d A tinge of sadness seemed to appear on the old geezer\u2019s face.\u201cGive me the spell model catalogue!\u201d Thinking of that fussy woman from before, Leylin felt extremely glad. Even the sinking feeling from the mandatory attendance of the bloodbath had slowly reduced.\u201cHere!\u201d The old geezer handed over a booklet made from parchment paper over to Leylin.Leylin opened to have a look. The first page was of Fire element Rank 0 spells, on the page number it shone with red light, indicating the element of the spells listed.Leylin continued flipping. Water element, Plant element, even Necromancy Rank 0 spells had all shone\u00a0in their respective colours.As for Shadow, Dark Element Rank 0 spells, Leylin had already collected almost all, so he did not look any further.While browsing through the booklet, Leylin realised that the prices of these spell models had reduced by more than half, so they were already selling them at a loss.It was a pity, however, that for regular acolytes, to master a Rank 0 spell, they must take at least months. Towards this imminent bloodbath, it was futile to start mastering them now.\u201cThis Secondary Energy Fireball of the Fire element, Dampened Earth of the Water element, and the manipulation of corpses from the Necromancy Element, and this, and this\u2026. One of them each.\u201dSince the spell model prices have plunged down, and Leylin had Magic Crystals, he could naturally afford to splurge on them.To him, it was like a sweep of the warehouse sale.After handing the old geezer a huge bag of Magic Crystals, and requested him to send people to carry the books over, Leylin then asked, \u201cAre there any Rank 1 spell models here?\u201d\u201cMy apologies, our counter here only sells Rank 0 spells for the acolytes.\u201d The old geezer shrugged his shoulders and put on a helpless appearance. It seems like Leylin wasn\u2019t the first acolyte to ask him about this.After obtaining an answer he expected, Leylin nodded his head and left.His earlier question was just to try his luck, so he wasn\u2019t very disappointed.* Ka-cha! Creak! *First, it was the sound of a bronze key entering the keyhole and the turning of the lock.\u201cWe\u2019re here, place the things down!\u201dLeylin opened his dorm\u2019s door and said towards several servants carrying boxes behind him.* Boom! * The few servants placed the spell models books onto the ground, letting off a loud noise.After placing Leylin\u2019s purchase, these servants bowed to Leylin and walked out of the room.\u201cThere is actually no change here!\u201dLeylin sized up his room. There was still a bright light radiating from within. Apart from more dust being collected, the rest was still the same as before.\u201cAmansi!\u201dLeylin snapped his fingers. Suddenly a green whirlwind appeared from within the room.The spiralling \u00a0of the whirlwind continued, bringing the bedsheets and tablecloths floating into the air. A few grey dust particles were sucked into that whirlwind.Very soon the green whirlwind spun around the room once, and many dust particles were trapped in it, turning a murky green colour, finally it dropped into the bin.\u201cNow it seems much more comfortable and clean!\u201dLeylin looked at the dorm that was as good as new, and nodded his head in satisfaction, before placing the spell models and ingredients away nicely.After all was done, Leylin first went to the dining hall to have a sumptuous dinner, before returning to the room and picking up a spell model book.\u201cSecondary Energy Fireball huh?\u201d Leylin looked at the fire red book. \u201cA.I. Chip! Record!\u201d[Beep! Scanning in progress!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.Hours later, the A.I. Chip replied, [The spell model of Secondary Energy Fireball has been recorded, analysing in progress: 9.23%]After his advancement into a Level 3 Acolyte, the A.I. Chip which was part of his soul also obtained an increase in processing capabilities.To Leylin, other acolytes need continuous memorisation and use of their Spiritual Force to construct the spell models in their mind. This would require a huge consumption of time, and once something goes awry, it would result in a waste of time.However, for Leylin, he only needed the A.I. Chip to analyse the spell and send it over to his hippocampus, then he would remember this spell model forever. In future, he only needed to activate his Spiritual Force, before completely mastering the spell model.To put it simply, the A.I. Chip had substituted the process of memory and also created a framework for him in his mind. It was like digging a pool, the A.I. Chip would help Leylin in digging a pool, and Leylin only needed to put forth his Spiritual Force like water into the pool. This saved a huge amount of time, which made Leylin\u2019s learning abilities on spell models much faster than regular acolytes.\u201cA.I. Chip! Establish mission! With all the Rank 0 spells as the foundation, begin simulating the model for a Rank 1 spell!\u201dFrom what Leylin could see, the might of a Rank 1 spell was stronger than a Rank 0 spell. Only with enough material, with the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculation abilities, can he manage to simulate a certain Rank 1 spell model. There could even be a new spell model that had never appeared before in the Magus World![Mission establishing! Information on Rank 1 spells missing, beginning simulation\u2026.]Rows of data were projected in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.[Estimated might of a Rank 1 spell: 20 degrees and above! Information sources: <In Depth Spell Model Analysis>, <All Living Things Studies>, <Spell Constructing Manual>, Umbra\u2019s Hand spell model, Secondary Energy Fireball spell model\u2026. Simulation time: Unable to estimate!]The A.I. Chip listed many sources of material and even replied with an answer that it was unable to estimate for the first time.However, Leylin smiled. \u201cAs expected, although the time is not confirmed, but the A.I. Chip can very well simulate a spell model of a Rank 1 spell\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s next, once I have a standard amount of Grine Water, and reach the requirement of the Spiritual Force to advance, then I can give it a go\u2026.\u201dFor Leylin, he would try simulating a Rank 1 spell model with the A.I. Chip. But for the Grine Water, as it was a type of intermediate potion, the formula had always been held by the various large magician guilds. There was no way of them being divulged to outsiders. Many of the ingredients to brew it were also monopolised by these guilds, so there was no way he could brew it on his own.Hence, his main goal in the upcoming bloodbath, was, under the circumstances of self-preservation, that he would try his best to acquire as many contribution points as possible to exchange for the Grine Water!If he even had to purchase a spell model with the contribution points, he had no confidence to retaliate under the two academies joining forces and obtaining enough contribution points.Moreover, even if he did, he would be marked down by the enemy Magi, which was not beneficial for his future growth.But now he only needed to get one of the two, so the difficulty was reduced by half. The attention he would be getting would be reduced too.\u201cAlso, I have to complete the Fallen Star Pendant for a chance to live on in the bloodbath!\u201dLeylin\u2019s hand turned over, revealing that silver cross.Under the bright light, the jewels on the cross glittered resplendently.\u201cOnce I have this low-grade defensive Magic Artifact, my survival chances will definitely increase in the secret plane!\u201dLeylin muttered, and came to his experiment lab beside the room, withdrawing the Confining Spirit Sphere that held Roman captive.The originally dimmed crystal ball gradually radiated with light after Leylin undid the seal. Light reflected from it like amber, with a translucent worm-sized like human figure in it.\u201cRoman! Actually, I wanted to spend more time on you to pry more information from your mouth. A pity, however, there isn\u2019t much time left\u2026.\u201dRegret surfaced on Leylin\u2019s face.As for the vengeful spirit, Roman, who was inside the crystal ball, he shuddered. The crazed and bloodthirsty look disappeared from his face, replaced by a pair of eyes that radiated intelligence.\u201cA Level 3 Acolyte\u2019s soul which transformed into a vengeful spirit, can definitely accomplish the final step \u2013 Spirit awakening!\u201dLeylin placed the silver cross beside the Confining Spirit Sphere and began to draw various runes with a feather quill and other tools on the large experiment table.The runes and characters continuously writhed and twisted, forming a strange magic rune.Along with Leylin\u2019s incantation and tossing of ingredients, the huge magic rune let off a dim grey glow.As for Roman who was within the Confining Spirit Sphere, he seemed to have seen something extremely dangerous, and even his voice started to quiver, \u201cNo\u2026 You can\u2019t do this\u2026.\u201dThe final step of synthesizing the Fallen Star Pendant required a sealed spirit that was full of energy, which is the best catalyst for the activation process.Roman, who had the strength of a Level 3 Acolyte in his previous life, was the perfect ingredient for Leylin right now!After a vengeful spirit is sealed within the Fallen Star Pendant, Roman\u2019s soul will be forever trapped within that silver cross, and suffer from never-ending torment. He could only wait for the day when the silver cross shatters, before his soul will be dissipated.\u201cYou, who is in such a state, have you got any other bargaining chip for me?\u201dAfter finishing drawing the spell formation, and sizing up the spirit which was repeatedly begging him from within the Confining Spirit Sphere, a curious smile spread across Leylin\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2026 I am an outstanding alchemist and have mastered many secrets and special skills in alchemy. If only you let me go, I will hand them all over to you\u2026.\u201dSeeing the resolute expression on Leylin\u2019s face, Roman started to reveal everything that he knew, for a sliver of a chance to stay alive.\u201cNot enough! Most of your things were already recorded inside that Alchemy book, and these benefits will not be able to compensate for the loss of my Fallen Star Pendant!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face turned icy cold.\u201cI\u2026 I also know of a secret about magicians who advance to an official Magus! If only you swear to let me go, I will tell you! That is something that all the higher ups in the magician guilds have done their best to conceal!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your professor must have definitely told you that to become a Rank 1 Magus, you need a defensive spell model as well as Grine Water, right?\u201d\u201cCould it be that there is something more to it?\u201d Suddenly Leylin had an ominous feeling.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Roman started laughing maniacally, \u201cYou have been duped by your professor, or maybe, even your professor doesn\u2019t know of it\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you know the rankings of official Magi?\u201d After laughing hysterically, Roman suddenly became calm and asked Leylin.\u201cIt seems a Magus is differentiated by 9 ranks. Rank 1 as the lowest, and Rank 9 as the highest. The indication is to release a spell of that rank without any backlash!\u201dThis was some information that Leylin heard from a certain lecturer. However, he had treated it as only a myth. After all, in the whole of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, all the professors were only Rank 1 Magus, save for the chairman who was in the realm of a Rank 2 Magus.As for Rank 3 Magi, only the heads of powerful guilds such as Lighthouse of the Night had that cultivation.Leylin was simply unable to comprehend the extent of the power that a Rank 9 Magus could wield.\u201cIt seems as if you have been trying your best to obtain information regarding official Magi\u2026.\u201dSeeing that he had successfully piqued Leylin\u2019s interest, Roman rested lazily against the wall of the crystal ball, and said, \u201cThe strength of official Magus, rest on their ability to inscribe a Rank 1 spell successfully in their sea of consciousness, thus turning into their own innate defensive spell! They will then obtain an instantaneous spell casting or the spell will be permanently in effect. Moreover, the consumption is extremely little\u2026.\u201dLeylin nodded his head, the innate spell of official Magi could always be maintained around the surface of their bodies, forming a barrier. This was why the A.I. Chip\u2019s readings were always hindered by these barriers of Magi, thus, it was unable to obtain the data needed.\u201cAfter advancing to a Rank 1 Magus, a Magus\u2019 sea of consciousness will form an innate spell. If this Magus was to advance again, turning into a Rank 2 Magus, he will have to construct a new innate spell. Furthermore, it has to be constructed on the foundation of the original innate spell. Which is to say, a Rank 2 Magus has 2 innate spells, and a Rank 3 Magus has 3 innate spells. If it was a Rank 9 Magus of the legends, they would have 9 innate spells, and the final one is a Rank 9 spell!\u201dFor a chance to survive, Roman divulged a few details known to few.\u201cWhich is to say, if it was a Rank 9 Magus, they can instantaneously cast spells of Rank 1 to 9!\u201dLeylin felt sluggish. He could not resist even a Rank 1 spell, to say nothing of a Rank 9 spell cast by a Grand Magus.Once a Magus was able to cast high-level spells instantaneously, it would mean that their battle prowess would be capable of burning down mountains and evaporating the seas.\u201cAnd what is this scam that you\u2019re speaking of?\u201dLeylin asked suddenly.\u201cHehe! An innate spell is the root of the Magus\u2019 Spiritual Force. Once constructed, it will be irreversible for eternity. Moreover, the innate spells after the first and original one have to be modelled after it. What would happen if you were to choose your innate spell wrongly? Two innate spells conflicting with each other in the sea of consciousness will result in a deficient spell as the best case scenario. The most likely event is that your brain will explode like an alchemy bomb. Bang! And off your head goes!\u201dRoman made an explosive gesture and sniggered.\u201cThis scenario is extremely plausible!\u201d Leylin face darkened.\u201cSo then, where is the crux of this scam?\u201d\u201cThey have concealed the existence of advanced meditation techniques!\u201d Roman hugged his knees as he squatted.\u201cAdvanced meditation techniques?\u201d Leylin\u2019s heart wavered. He had faintly come across information on this, but even if it was his mentor, Kroft, had never seen such advanced source/material like them.\u201cYes, advanced meditation techniques completely suit a magician\u2019s Spiritual Force meditation techniques! Not only is the rate faster than those regular meditation techniques in constructing mind runes, they will even naturally form an innate spell in the Magus sea of consciousness on every level!\u201d\u201cNaturally forming innate spells? You mean\u2026.\u201d Leylin\u2019s voice grew weak.\u201cIndeed, if the advanced meditation techniques were to increase its level, they will directly raise the rank of a Magus. There wouldn\u2019t be any need for Grine Water or spell model!\u201dRoman smirked. \u201cAlso, according to the innate spell formed by the meditation technique, they\u2019d directly complement each other. Not only is there no conflict with the innate spells, the meditation technique will even enhance the effect of the innate spell!\u201d\u201cThink about it! If you were to use Grine Water to breakthrough, you will realise that your future levels will be extremely difficult to breakthrough. Every time you advance, you would require something more potent and effective than the Grine Water to aid in the advancement. Not only that, you have to scour the lands for an innate spell which does not conflict with the one you already have. This is purely based on luck, and basically it cannot be done!\u201d\u201cAnd tens of hundreds of years will pass. The Magi who had cultivated in advanced meditation techniques would have continuously risen in their levels, while you will be on the bottom rung of the hierarchy struggling to survive, finally dying in some corner where nobody cares about\u2026.\u201dMore and more cold sweat began to gather on Leylin\u2019s forehead.With his abundant experience, and the calculation done by the A.I. Chip, he knew that what Roman spoke of was 98% authentic.\u201cThe Magus World is indeed ensnared with pitfalls, and not one step can be wrongly taken!\u201d\u201cSo then, you wish to use a part of an advanced meditation technique to exchange for your petty life?\u201d Leylin deeply inhaled for a few breaths, before asking Roman.\u201cIndeed, once you swear before the witness of the Trial\u2019s Eye, I will hand over the location of one of these advanced meditation techniques!\u201dRoman howled, \u201cIf you won\u2019t let me go, then never think of getting that piece of advanced meditation technique!\u201d\u201cHas that advanced meditation technique got to do with the Great Magus Serholm?\u201d Leylin fell silent for a while before he suddenly asked.\u201cYou know about it? That\u2019s right, you have been to that lab too, and it seems that you have discovered some information!\u201d Roman was a little shocked, before putting on a nonchalant air.\u201cBut so what? A part of an advanced meditation technique is indeed enough to redeem my life!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Leylin fell into silence for a while, before finally agreeing.Following which, he chanted a mysterious incantation.This incantation was an extreme tongue twister, and there were many pauses. It required a huge amount of Magic Power before the chant was finished.Leylin was only able to use this incantation after advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte.Following the enunciation of the final syllable, an energy wave came from the void, and the surrounding light dimmed. In the air above of that experiment table, a mysterious vertical eye appeared.This vertical eye\u2019s iris was pitch black, with its pupils dyed a crimson-red. Under its gaze, Leylin\u2019s body shuddered, as if not wearing any clothes. All of his secrets seemed to have been exposed to it.\u201cA.I. Chip! Scan!\u201dLeylin ordered from the bottom of his heart, yet he did not receive any response.It seems like the current ability of the A.I. Chip was still unable to detect such a strange entity like the Trial\u2019s Eye. Even if it was only a secondary body that did not even contain a billionth of the main body\u2019s might.\u201cWith the Trial\u2019s Eye as a witness, I, Leylin Farlier, will immediately release Roman from the Confining Spirit Sphere once Roman tells me the information regarding the advanced meditation technique.Leylin spoke slowly using the Byron Language.The moment Leylin finished his oath; the Trial\u2019s Eye turned into a black light, and separately entered each of Leylin\u2019s and Roman\u2019s foreheads.\u201cAlright! I have done as you requested, hurry and tell me the location of the advanced meditation technique!\u201dImpatience surfaced on Leylin\u2019s face.\u201cAlright! Regarding the advanced meditation technique, actually, I don\u2019t know much of it. Only that every advanced meditation technique have different requirements for the cultivator\u2019s affinity and soul aptitude.\u201d\u201cAs for me, I have read it from a piece of writing left by a Magus, the lead to the lab of the Great Magus Serholm. I also know that he left the legacy of the advanced meditation technique in a certain lab!\u201dUnder the constraints of the Trial\u2019s Eye, Roman began to spill everything he knew.\u201cThere is a requirement for the cultivators, how about the requirements for the meditation technique?\u201d Leylin asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. With my ability as a Level 3 Acolyte, obtaining the location of a piece of meditation technique is already extremely lucky, so how can I have more extravagant demands? Eventually, I hastily went to explore the lab, only to end up dying within it!\u201dRoman smiled sardonically.\u201cSo then, tell me the location of that meditation technique!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face was impassive as he spoke in a low tone.\u201cOn that piece of broken page, I obtained a few locations. The previous location is crossed out now, so that leaves only one. It is the Dylan Gardens which rests within the Zither Moon Mountain Plains!\u201d\u201cZither Moon Mountain Plains, Dylan Gardens?\u201dLeylin suddenly thought of this place that he had come across in his previous exploration. \u201cSo the Dylan Gardens was situated on the Zither Moon Mountain Plains, huh?\u201d\u201cAll I know are these, hurry and let me out!\u201d Roman howled.\u201cAlright! I will let you out now. Under the constraints of the Trial\u2019s Eye, I will dare not offend!\u201dLeylin smiled and snapped his fingers.* Boom! *The whole Confining Spirit Sphere shattered into pieces, revealing the translucent spirit body within.At the same time, two rays of light flew out from Leylin\u2019s and Roman\u2019s body. This proved that the agreement with the Trial\u2019s Eye has already been fulfilled by Leylin.\u201cHaha! I\u2019m free! I\u2019m free!\u201dRoman shouted.\u201cYes! I have abided by my promise, and released you from the Confining Spirit Sphere! Now, we are even!\u201dLeylin suddenly waved his hands and activated the spell formation.* Bang! *In an instant, the spell runes on the experiment table irradiated with light, engulfing Roman within.\u201cWhat happened? You! How can you escape from the binding agreement!\u201dRoman\u2019s face was in utter shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFallen Star Pendant\u201cI have already abided by my agreement and released you from the Confining Spirit Sphere. What happens next is not a part of the contract!\u201dLeylin\u2019s voice was extremely unconcerned.This was just simple wordplay. Magicians were all intelligent people, and could not be lied to easily.However, Roman was different. He had already died a long time ago, and his spirit body had transformed into a vengeful spirit. Naturally, his intelligence could not even be comparable to that of an average human.Moreover, after spending so much time inside the lab, Leylin had been diligently exercising various methods to reduce Roman\u2019s intelligence, making him more muddled, in order to interrogate him.As expected, even if Roman had unexpectedly regained his intelligence today under the brink of his death, he was still manipulated by Leylin and gave away the important information to the advanced meditation technique.\u201cEven for me, as of now, a Level 3 Acolyte spirit body is extremely hard to acquire, so how could I let you leave?\u201dLeylin did not bother paying attention to Roman\u2019s curses, and placed the silver cross in the centre of the runes, as he began to complete the final step for the Fallen Star Pendant.The Fallen Star Pendant came from a derelict page in the Lowian Academy Teachings. After having been decrypted by the A.I. Chip, together with the Alchemy diary found on Roman\u2019s corpse, Leylin was able to deduce the correct procedure for synthesizing it.After advancing to a Level 3 Acolyte, Leylin had dedicated most of his time and effort on synthesizing this low-grade Magic Artifact.After costing Leylin a large amount of Magic Crystals and ingredients, the Fallen Star Pendant was almost completed, where the final step remained \u2013 spirit awakening!\u201dAccording to Leylin\u2019s deductions and the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculations, the final step, the spirit awakening, had already involved the aspect of spirit and was something that he could not resolve then.However, Leylin sought a huge number of living bodies from Viscount Jackson of Extreme Night City as a main material in observing the soul.After many years of research, Leylin could already confirm that within Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, he would be the foremost regarding the topic of soul research, and might even surpass many Magi.After so many experiments, the spirit awakening step did not pose a problem for Leylin.However, he had no leads on the other ancient formula that he obtained from Kroft, Tears of Mary, up till now.Leylin\u2019s guess was that this formula was meant for an official Magus, something which an acolyte could not get involved with yet.\u201cFor the Spirit awakening, a stronger spirit body is not necessarily better. According to the A.I. Chip\u2019s simulation and my own deductions, a Level 3 Acolyte would be the most suitable for it\u2026.\u201dLeylin looked at the vengeful spirit, Roman, who was writhing and cursing him on the light formation.\u201cFor a long time, I have deliberately calibrated Roman\u2019s spirit strength to be compatible with the final step. As long as I am able to complete the spirit awakening, the Magic Artifact that I get will definitely be perfect!\u201dThis was the trump card that Leylin had prepared for the upcoming bloodbath.A low-grade Magic Artifact did not exceed the boundaries of an official Magus. However, for acolytes, it was almost impossible for them to destroy the defense on this Magic Artifact.As long as Leylin had that pendant, his safety in the bloodbath would be greatly increased.\u201cLet me go! You promised me!\u201dRoman who was trapped within the spell formation continuously howled.At the end, the vengeful spirit Roman cursed in a low tone, \u201cDespicable miscreant, I curse you\u2026.\u201d\u201cEnough of your nonsense!\u201d Leylin\u2019s brow furrowed and he poured a silver liquid directly onto the Fallen Star Pendant.* Sssii! *A cloud of white smoke rose from the silver necklace, and the white mist in the air transformed into a large jaw lined with razor sharp teeth, which bit at Roman directly.* Ka-cha! *Roman was immediately eaten by the large malevolent mouth, which it opened and closed as if enjoying the aftertaste.Leylin stared at the large mouth, and after seeing that Roman was completely devoured, he began to chant an incantation.The chanting voice reverberated around the area, and Leylin\u2019s spell formation that he drew on the experiment lab began to shrink to the centre, and finally, it all transferred onto the Fallen Star Pendant.With the convergence of the runes, the patterns on the silver cross seemed more detailed and glowed with mysterious colours of light.\u201cSeal!\u201dLeylin fixed his gaze on the cross. When the runes were all accepted by the silver Fallen Star Pendant, he pointed at the huge mouth in midair.* Pu! * A sound similar to a bubble popping sounded.The white mouth was directly dispersed, and threads of white gaseous bodies were emitted. In the centre of them were many strands of black colour, which continuously fell onto the silver cross.\u201cWith my name, Leylin Farlier, Fallen Star Pendant, shimmer!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression was solemn, and he bit his fingers, dripping a droplet of blood onto the Fallen Star Pendant.The red jewel in the silver cross sparkled and directly sucked Leylin\u2019s blood into it.* Bang! * A strong suction force appeared from the Fallen Star Pendant, circling around the surface of the silver cross and forming a whirlwind. It directly sucked in all of the black and white gaseous compounds.The thick mist enveloped the silver cross within, and it floated in midair, becoming a luminescent ball of black and white.\u201cVery good! The awakening phase is activated, and everything has been going smoothly without a hitch so far!\u201dLeylin looked at the glowing ball in midair, his eyes holding a fervent gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, is\u2026.\u201dOn the second morning, Leylin stared at a silver cross held in his palm, his face revealing an elated expression.At this moment, the Fallen Star Pendant was a silver grey colour, and the jewels also seemed dull and without lustre. Based on outer appearances alone, it could not even be compared to the previous half completed item. However the A.I. Chip\u2019s indication made Leylin feel ecstatic.[Beep! Low-grade Magic Artifact \u2013 Fallen Star Pendant has been successfully synthesized!][Fallen Star Pendant \u2013 \u00a0Low-grade Magic Artifact. Main components used for defence: Stellar Alloy, Manfayla Rock, Mankestre Bone Marrow\u2026.][Physical Defence: 13 degrees, Magical Defence: 15 degrees. Instant activation when Host is attacked!]The various stats shown on the A.I. Chip made Leylin extremely ecstatic. A defence Magic Artifact could not even be bought in the market.Normally speaking, the attack of a Level 3 Acolyte was around 10 degrees or so. Only official Magi and above would be able to cast a magic spell of over 20 degrees.With the Fallen Star Pendant in hand, while it still had energy, Leylin could completely ignore the attacks of Level 1 and Level 2 Acolytes. Together with the Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion, Leylin would be able to endure a barrage of attacks even if it came from a Level 3 Acolyte.One could say that with the successful synthesis of the Fallen Star Pendant, Leylin\u2019s survival was assured.\u201cThis Magic Artifact is like a simplified version of an official Magus\u2019 defensive force field!\u201d Suddenly Leylin exclaimed.Reverence and respect for magicians uncontrollably welled up in Leylin\u2019s heart even more.The continued tradition of the Magus World was only in recent times, for about 1000 years. Before this, there were even the glorified and magnificent ancient times of the past. Back in the ancient past, the primordial and immemorial past, there was a countless accumulation of time, yet how many from these periods were geniuses? How many had invented mysterious spells?Only by standing on a giant\u2019s shoulder, one could see the road ahead clearly, strive hard and advance!Even with the A.I. Chip, Leylin only had a better foundation than other magicians. On the path of a Magus, he still required to rely on the experiences of his predecessors and improve both himself and his abilities.After sighing, Leylin hung the silver grey cross on his neck.The ice cold pendant came into direct contact with the skin, and Leylin pulled up his collar. This way, no one could tell that Leylin was wearing a pendant just by looking at the surface.\u201cWith the Fallen Star Pendant, my defense is guaranteed. What\u2019s next is to make use of the A.I. Chip to come up with a combination of a few strong Rank 0 spells to be used in the bloodbath.Although Leylin believed Roman\u2019s words, with the current rewards, he wouldn\u2019t let it go.His previous plan was to obtain the Grine Water through the bloodbath, and right now he did not plan to give up.After all, he still couldn\u2019t defeat any Rank 1 Magi. Under the compulsion of the academy and professors, he still needed to join the bloodbath in the secret plane.* Dong Dong Dong! *Just when Leylin was deep in thought, a patterned knocking on the door sounded.\u201cPlease enter!\u201d Leylin hurriedly removed the traces of his work in the lab and arranged his clothes before he spoke.* Creak! *The wooden door was pushed open, and at that moment, when Bicky who wore a green dress, walked in, a scented fragrance wafted in and infiltrated Leylin\u2019s nose.\u201cLeylin! Mentor has asked me to get you to register for the upcoming school competition\u2026.\u201dBicky toyed with a white flower in her hands.Before the bloodbath, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had already spared no hesitation in nurturing its acolytes. The prices of various ingredients and spell models had plunged, and they had also hosted many competitions before the bloodbath.Only with participation, there would be generous rewards, such as Magic Crystals, spell models, ingredients and the like.As for the top few ranks, they were even given scrolls of spells and attack type potions as rewards.However, Leylin did not lack Magic Crystals, and he could also brew attack type potions for himself. As for the reward for the champion, it was not a Magic Artifact, so he was not attracted in the slightest.However, he still had to, at least, show some superficial effort. Leylin nodded his head and walked out of the dorm with Bicky.After not seeing her for 3 years, the girl from before had turned into a beautiful young lady. Bicky was silent as she led the way. Leylin opened his mouth but did not know what to say.The two walked through the garden zone, and Bicky smiled and said, \u201cLeylin! You know what? Fayle has already agreed to let me be his girlfriend!\u201dSaying which, Leylin acutely discovered a peculiar expression from within Bicky\u2019s eyes.\u201cOh really? Congratulations!\u201dLeylin had known of Bicky crush on Fayle it since the very first day he entered. After seeing his good friend fulfilling what she wished for, he was somewhat happy for Bicky.At the same time, he was somewhat worried. He had some understanding towards Fayle\u2019s character and knew that Fayle liked to be in the limelight. On top of that, Fayle was rather vain. However, after seeing Bicky\u2019s smiling expression, Leylin still chose to maintain his silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are some potion brewing ones, some for harvesting plants, and other lesser known subjects. However, the liveliest event is still the fighting competition. Any acolyte is able to join, and the reward is the most generous!\u201d\u201cAlthough the acolytes are able to participate in many events, Professor Kroft said that you had better join the potion brewing event!\u201dBicky looked at Leylin, not masking her worried expression.\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I am only prepared to join the potion brewing event!\u201d Leylin smiled as he consoled Bicky.Leylin did not want to compete head on with those genius fifth-grade acolytes. Behind them were the support of many professors, and they would definitely carry Magic Artifacts with them.Moreover, the battle prize was not attractive to him at all. This prize was obviously prepared as a final chance to give to those average acolytes.Although Leylin came only as a mere formality, naturally he had to choose the simplest way to do it.The front of the education area was lined with several black desks. The banner behind them had words like Potioneering and Fighting.Many acolytes were crowding around the tables to register.Looking on, it seemed like they were acolytes who had recently rushed back to the academy.Leylin thought for a while before directly registering for the Potioneering battle.\u201cHold on to this! Your assigned number is 32, and the competition will start tomorrow afternoon at 3 o\u2019clock. Please be punctual and come to the large hall in experiment zone 13 in order to participate!\u201dThe administrative staff wearing grey robes handed a parchment paper over to Leylin, and also routinely gave him a numbered card.\u201cNext!\u201dWith the impatient voice of the grey-robed person sounding, Leylin rubbed his nose, shook his head, and walked away.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the restaurant to celebrate!\u201d Leylin said to Bicky, who was beside him.\u201cIt\u2019s better if I pay for it, as a celebration for us meeting again after such a long time!\u201d Bicky\u2019s face revealed a joyous expression.\u2026\u2026On the second day, Leylin arrived 5 minutes earlier at Hall 13.At this moment, many Potioneering acolytes were already waiting here. Some recognised Leylin and smiled as they greeted him while some faces were extremely unfamiliar.This was not strange, as most magicians holed themselves up, often staying in their experiment labs to conduct experiments, especially those who practiced Potioneering and Alchemy.Merlin and Bicky also entered the crowd, smiling at Leylin.* Ding Ling Ling! * With a crisp bell sound, a black-robed figure emerged from the crowd.\u201cOfficial Magus!\u201d Leylin exclaimed silently. Although he was not the same as before, compared to an official Magus, he was still an ant.The A.I. Chip was also helpless, as it was blocked by the defensive force field surrounding the official Magus.\u201cAll of you, enter the main hall and go to your respective allocated areas as is indicated by your card number. I will only wait for 5 minutes, and those who aren\u2019t there by then will be immediately disqualified!\u201dThe black robed figure\u2019s voice was extremely hoarse and unpleasing to the ears.After finishing his speech, the black-robed Magus shook his robe, and his body split apart, turning into innumerable bats, which flew away.The acolytes that were present looked each other in the eye.* Bang! * Not knowing who made the first move, the whole hall clamoured and squeezed through into the main hall.Although Leylin was not in a hurry, his body was involuntarily pushed into the hall with the crowd.With a great effort, he managed to get to his experiment table.The number 32 was scribbled on the corner of a pure white table. There were also a few herbs, ingredients and a piece of parchment paper on the table. With just a whiff Leylin knew that these were the necessary ingredients for a healing potion.\u201cFive minutes are up, any acolyte who has not found their place is deemed disqualified!\u201dThe black robed Magus\u2019 voice sounded again. At the same time, there were cries from many acolytes.Leylin saw an unlucky fellow beside him, who was just one step away from his table, grabbed by a black bat and thrown outside of the hall.\u201cThe topic, this time, is to brew a healing potion! The formula and ingredients are on the experiment table, and you will have 3 hours\u2026.\u201dAfter dealing with the group of disqualified acolytes, the black robed Magus\u2019 voice sounded yet again.\u201cYour every move is under my vigilance, so do not try to cheat your way through it. If not, I will educate you on a lesson of blood!\u201d\u201cAs expected!\u201d Leylin picked up the parchment paper, and it was indeed the formula of a healing potion.\u201cSuch an elementary potion like this, I have brewed it so many times that I could vomit !\u201dLeylin felt extremely frustrated, but he still skillfully picked up a beaker\u2026To an outsider, Leylin\u2019s every movement now was textbook standard. His arms were strong, and they did not quiver. During the process of brewing, every action was filled with a unique aesthetic movement.* Drip! *A drop of green liquid was placed into a test tube, and the whole test tube momentarily turned red.\u201cIt\u2019s completed!\u201d Leylin looked at the A.I. Chip\u2019s recording time, \u201c1 hour 20 minutes? It seems like I have become a little bit rusty!\u201d\u201cEn! Very good, it\u2019s completed!\u201dA black bat immediately flew onto Leylin\u2019s experiment table and scrutinised Leylin\u2019s potion.\u201cSir!\u201d Leylin hurriedly bowed.\u201cI recognise you! Aren\u2019t you Leylin? The apprentice of that old geezer Kroft! The heavens are really unfair; he already had such an outstanding apprentice, Merlin, yet now, it even sent you to him\u2026.\u201dThe bat seemed to recognise Kroft, and muttered by the side. Leylin maintained his silence throughout.Leylin had no thoughts of establishing a relationship with a Magus, and he did not have the ability to do so either.\u201cAlright! Let me sniff the potion!It could be seen that after seeing Leylin keep his silence like a log, the bat cursed for a while before suddenly speaking.Leylin opened the plug on the test tube and placed it below the bat\u2019s head.\u201cEn! Healing potion! The quality is excellent! Kiddo, you have passed!\u201dThe bat somewhat regretfully flew away, and let off an unpleasant voice, \u201cLeylin! Consider changing professors and joining me\u2026.\u201dTowards this, Leylin could only smile wryly.\u2026\u2026The Potioneering competition carried on for two days and one night.Fortunately, the acolytes could all manipulate the energy particles to strengthen their bodies, so they could endure throughout the entirety of the competition.Leylin had also been brewing potions in these two days.Along with the intensity of the competition, the topics given by the academy became more and more difficult. Bicky had already been eliminated in the third round. At the very end, they moved on to beginner potions.Through these series of tests, Leylin distinguished himself above the rest, and stormed through the competition with his senior, Merlin.As for the contents of the finals, it was to brew a Hofdor\u2019s Water of Radiance. This was a kind of healing potion that was able to treat injuries caused by negative energy spells. Even amongst the beginner potions, it was known to be extremely difficult to brew.Although Leylin had the confidence to brew it successfully with the A.I. Chip, for concealment reasons, he spontaneously pretended to make a mistake, and lost to Merlin, taking second place.Deep in the night, Leylin returned to his dorm, and tossed the second prize reward, a Fiery Combustion Potion, aside.This type of attack potion had a might of 8 to 9 degrees, which could be considered to be an extremely remarkable trump card for a Level 3 Acolyte. However, it was not worthy in Leylin\u2019s eyes.Since a year ago, he could already brew a potion like this on his own.\u201cIt\u2019s finally over. What\u2019s left is to wholeheartedly prepare for the secret plane bloodbath!\u201dConcerning the bloodbath between the few academies, it couldn\u2019t just be glossed over hastily like the academy competitions.Even during the intra-school fighting competition, there was only a loss of a few acolytes\u2019 lives due to mishaps.However, during the bloodbath, it was two against one, and their enemy\u2019s goal was to eradicate the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.* Dong Dong Dong! *While deep in thought, Leylin heard a knocking noise outside the door.\u201cWho is it? It\u2019s so late already!\u201d Leylin was rather unhappy as he opened the door.\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d Outside the door, there was a girl wrapped in a cloak, and her voice sounded coquettish.\u201cYou are\u2026 Bic\u2026\u201d Before Leylin could finish, his lips were already sealed. The door closed and the cloak slipped off, revealing an ample yet provocative and naked body.\u201cThis is\u2026 What\u2019s happening?\u201dAfter Leylin recovered his senses, he was already lying on his own bed, with a girl continuously writhing on top of him.Feeling the pleasure underneath his body, Leylin resisted his urges and temptation to touch Bicky\u2019s waist, which made her stop in her movements, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026 I can\u2019t think of a better way to console you! Leylin! Don\u2019t be upset! The loss is only temporary\u2026\u201dBicky pouted lovably.\u201cI\u2026\u201dLeylin was extremely at a loss for words. If he could look in the mirror, he would definitely be putting on a wry smile.He deliberately lost on purpose, yet he did not think that this silly girl Bicky would actually be fooled by him. Thinking that he would be devastated, she offered herself to \u2018console\u2019 him.At the same time, Leylin lost all his hopes towards the wanton practices in this world.\u201cAlright then! How about Fayle? Aren\u2019t you his girlfriend?\u201dLeylin asked.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t know. Besides, before marriage, I have my freedom!\u201d Bicky revealed a coquettish smile and gradually started to thrust her waist again.\u201cSo then, what happens after marriage?\u201d Leylin was somewhat unhappy and quickened his motions.The delicate beauty panted for a while before speaking with great effort, \u201cMa\u2026 After marriage, I have to guard my body for Fayle!\u201dLeylin then performed another deep penetrating thrust, which made Bicky moan with a shrill voice. She then collapsed in Leylin\u2019s embrace, as if all the bones in her body were removed.\u201cYou are really\u2026 Alright then! After I have borne a child for Fayle and confirmed with a blood test, whenever you want it, you can look for me\u2026\u201dBicky\u2019s face blushed, and buried her head in Leylin\u2019s arms.\u201cWhat is this? I let Fayle wear a green hat in advance?\u201dLeylin thought at the back of his mind, as his hands involuntarily grabbed on Bicky\u2019s peaks of abundance, and began to move wildly.In the morning, Leylin stroked the bare body of the girl, and he did not know whether to laugh or cry, \u201cI never thought that I would become a friend with benefits\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Bloodbath BeginsLooking at Bicky lying in his arms, Leylin\u2019s expression was complicated.Regarding the fact that she threw herself at him the previous night, Leylin guessed that there were a few reasons behind it. First it was that Bicky had a favourable impression of him. As she did not have the heart to watch him be defeated, she came here to console him. The second was that this world\u2019s practices were generally more open, and Bicky wasn\u2019t a virgin before she did it with him \u2013 she had obviously had intercourse before. Finally, due to the bloodbath that was drawing closer, she was restless mentally, so her subconscious mind made the decision to do some stimulating activities and thus vent her frustration.However, no matter what the reasons were, Bicky was a beauty, and Leylin was not on the losing end.\u201cAh?!\u201d Suddenly, the female body on Leylin shook, and sat upright.\u201cWhat time is it? It\u2019s actually 7 o\u2019clock. Not good, I have to go to Mentor\u2019s experiment lab\u2026.\u201dBicky hurriedly left the bed, and revealed that exquisite body once again to Leylin. She quickly did the buttons on her robes, before giving Leylin a light peck on his cheeks and then scurrying out of the room.\u201cReally\u2026.\u201d Leylin looked at Bicky\u2019s departing figure and smiled wryly.Very soon, the romance of last night was thrown to the back of Leylin\u2019s mind.The secret plane bloodbath drew closer \u2013 it was one which none of the acolytes in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy could avoid.Especially those fifth-grade acolytes with genius aptitude, they were the target of the opposing academies.On the contrary, Leylin only had some talent in Potioneering; furthermore he had his senior Merlin to garner all unwanted attention, so he would not be in the limelight.This was one of the reasons why Leylin never revealed his true abilities.What followed next was Leylin holing up in his experiment lab, familiarising himself with the Fallen Star Pendant, and using the A.I. Chip to analyse the spell models. Also, he simulated those Rank 0 spells with high degrees of attack to be used in conjunction with his attack potions, in preparation for the secret plane bloodbath.\u2026\u2026The clouds were a patch of grey, and from time to time it drizzled, which made people feel like shadow was looming over them on the horizon.Acolytes wearing grey robes were crammed into a field full of wild grasses. Each of them had a solemn expression, and their eyes brought possible vicious or vacant looks.A few black and white robed official Magi stood before them.Leylin stood somewhere at the corner of the acolytes and maintained a low profile, and now and then stole glances at the professors in front of him.At the forefront of the professors was a large bloke \u2013 wearing black robes \u2013 who stood still, and subconsciously, strands of energy waves radiated out from his body which made Leylin\u2019s Spiritual Force circulation feel rather sluggish.\u201cThat person is definitely the chairman of our Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, a Rank 2 Magus of the legends!\u201dLeylin bowed his head lower, not daring to raise his head again.As for the desire to use the A.I. Chip to scan, Leylin buried it deep within his heart. The might of a Rank 2 Magus was extremely mysterious, and Leylin had no confidence in concealing this A.I. Chip from him.Moreover, right now the A.I. Chip could not even break past the barriers of a Rank 1 Magus, so he needn\u2019t embarrass himself further.\u201cBut\u2026 are we activating the secret plane right here?\u201dLeylin looked at the surroundings. Under the dimly-lit sky, the field was dead silent, the rodents and lizards as if discovering a great battle was coming, had long since left the place.Amongst the acolytes, Leylin even saw Bicky, Merlin, Nyssa, Jayden and the like.Jayden stood at the forefront of the acolytes, and his face was extremely gloomy. There were thick, dark circles around his eyes, and it seemed that his condition was not too great.Nyssa stood at the end of the crowd, and her whole figure was draped in grey robes, which was extremely low profile.As for Bicky and Merlin, they were muttering to each other.After seeing Leylin, Bicky even gave him a smile.\u201cBicky has a few attack potions that I gave her, and she isn\u2019t an important target, so most likely she\u2019ll be alright!\u201dLeylin comforted himself.\u201cThey\u2019re here! They\u2019re here!\u201dSuddenly, a ruckus was caused amongst the acolytes, which broke Leylin\u2019s train of thoughts.Leylin inhaled a mouthful of air and raised his head to look at the distance.On the far horizon, a black spot suddenly appeared. With the black spot gradually approaching, its size, too, grew larger and larger.When the black spot arrived in front of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s representatives, Leylin managed to see the full appearance of this creature.It was a giant beetle, with eight long and sturdy legs. Each of them was over a dozen metres long. On top of the tiny head of the beetle, was a pair of compound eyes which was looking down on the masses of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.[The target has a layer of defensive barrier, and is primarily categorized as a Rank 1 Magus. Host is recommended to stay far away from the target]At this moment, the A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned, which made Leylin realise how formidable this beetle was.\u201cSssii!\u201dFrom the giant beetle, a few drops of yellowish green saliva drooled from its mouth, which fell onto the ground corroding a large pit.The surrounding acolytes backed away in unison. Their faces were pale, seemingly shocked by it.\u201cWhat are you afraid of? It\u2019s just an Abyss Steeled-Back Beetle!\u201d\u201cSilence!\u201dUnder the restrictions set by the professors in front, the acolytes then gradually recovered from their fright.\u201cSiley, your acolytes were actually frightened by my baby. It seems like their predicament isn\u2019t very good right now! Hahaha\u2026.\u201dA crisp male voice sounded, following which a white-robed, middle-aged Magus jumped off the back of the beetle. Although he had a middle-aged look, his brows were snow white.\u201cHng!\u201d Seemingly unhappy with the other party\u2019s taunt, the bald chairman Siley coldly harrumphed.However, from the A.I. Chip\u2019s detection, Leylin saw that a formless energy wave was radiated from Siley\u2019s body towards the beetle.\u201cWu!\u201d \u00a0\u201cArghh!\u201d A few frightened voices came from the back of the beetle, and it seemed to be made by youngsters.\u201cSiley! You actually\u2026.\u201d The white-browed Magus was in rage, and his brows suddenly turned red, as if blood was going to drip down from it.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Chairman Siley stepped forward as if being overbearing.\u201cThat white-browed, middle-aged man should be the chairman of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut. Although he is also a Rank 2 Magus, Chairman Siley is a Dark Magus, excelled in the art of combat, so his strength is definitely stronger than White Brows. . . \u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed.Just when the acolytes thought that these two Chairmen were about to battle, a whizzing sound travelled from the sky.An enormous horse carriage that stretched over a few dozen metres, with a pair of snow white wings on each side, gradually descended under the control of a few condors.* Bang! *The horse carriage landed steadily on the ground. The door opened, and a white-robed, golden-haired lady walked out from it.\u201cGuru, stop! Don\u2019t forget we have signed an agreement!\u201dListening to the golden-haired lady, Siley and Guru scoffed and returned back to their respective groups.Behind the golden-haired lady, a group of acolytes came out from the horse carriage. Their bodies evidently radiated strong energy waves.\u201cHehe! Siley, I hope your acolytes will be able to survive. Don\u2019t let your academy turn into a real graveyard\u2026\u201dWhite-Brows Guru sneered. Behind him, the beetle gradually folded its legs, which formed a flight of steps, where many acolytes stepped down from it.The acolytes from both academies looked at Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s camp menacingly, as if the acolytes here were all preys.\u201cMost of them are Level 3 Acolyte, and there is a rare number of Level 2 Acolyte. As for Level 1 Acolyte, there isn\u2019t any!\u201dLeylin\u2019s heart tightened. Due to the weakening state of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, the rules in the bloodbath were obviously not favourable to them.Not only were they two against one, but the other side could let their Level 1 Acolyte be excluded from the bloodbath. Unlike Abyssal Bone Forest Academy were all their acolytes had to enter.These Level 1 Acolyte could only play the role of cannon fodder when they entered, and were absolutely of no further use.\u201cAfter this mandatory enlistment, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy will definitely be worse off!\u201dLeylin looked at the acolytes in his academy that were of 11-12 years of age, and sighed within his heart.However, Leylin could not offer any assistance to them at all. At the very most, under the circumstances that his life wasn\u2019t threatened, he would do his best to help them.Right now, he had something more important to tend to.\u201cA.I. Chip, assist in the recording!\u201dRight now Leylin was a Level 3 Acolyte and the A.I. Chip\u2019s ability increased too. Most of the Level 3 Acolyte could not escape the A.I. Chip\u2019s detection now.Leylin picked out the acolytes who carried Magic Artifacts. No matter if it was his own side or the other, he recorded them down.These people were the ones that he had to be mindful of during the bloodbath.Listening to the provocative tone of the other party, Chairman Siley\u2019s face darkened. He waved his hands, \u201cEnough of this nonsense, let us begin!\u201d\u201cSince you have such sincerity, how could we bear to refuse your request?\u201dWhite-Brows Guru and the golden-haired lady smirked and nodded their heads, \u201cLet us begin!\u201dListening to their chairmen, the official Magi from the respective academies stepped forward and begin to retrieve many strange things from their sacks, robes or even within their bodies. After which, they began to set up a formation.When they were finished with it, a strange magic formation was arranged on the ground.\u201cThey are runes that make the foundation sturdy, linking up of energy and creating flames. I recognise some of these!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed, and recorded down all of these formations with the A.I. Chip.As for the three chairmen, after their staff had finished preparing the formation, they each stepped forward and withdrew 3 crimson coloured scrolls.\u201cWith my name, Siley, I summon the Will of Battle which is roving around the wilderness, and activate the glorious and deathly flight of stairs\u2026.\u201dThe 3 chairmen chanted and simultaneously tore the scrolls in their hands apart.* Bang! * Crimson lightning continuously thundered down, on the area above where the 3 crimson scrolls were torn, a huge opening suddenly appeared from the void.* Whoosh! * Countless thunder and lightning appeared from within, and noises of explosion and whistling came from the opening.Dozens of seconds later, the void calmed down.\u201cThis is a secret plane which is now an abandoned resources point. Any organisms and resources of value in it were scoured clean by us. Right now, it will become your battlefield\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You are not just a flower that is nurtured in a greenhouse, but ferocious young lions. I want you to seek your preys, stalk them, and ambush them. Finally, rip them to shreds!\u201dAfter finishing the last sentence, Chairman Siley\u2019s eyes turned a crimson red, and a blood red light was radiated, making his seem seemed somewhat contorted.Leylin\u2019s face was extremely solemn, and he did not know how to react to this anymore.Following which, the chairman promised many different rewards. They were all involving precious resources and advanced information that would be given as a bounty whenever the opposing acolytes were slain. This made the acolytes face gleam with greed.\u201cAs per rumours, our chairman is indeed an extremely aggressive person!\u201d Leylin thought, \u201cI wonder how long this group of people will last?\u201dOn the other side, the chairman of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle were also giving their speech. Although their acolytes were cheering loudly and nodding their heads vigorously, Leylin was in glee.The academies in the South Coast had been influenced by the styles of their respective headmasters. Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was advocating a more bloodthirsty and theory of the law of the jungle. Overall, it was leaning towards the side of Dark Magi.As for the two opposing factions, they were obviously leaning more towards Light Magi types. Although many acolytes were already Level 3 Acolyte, Leylin did not see the astuteness and craftiness in their eyes. Many of them even seemed innocent, which was extremely similar to the acolytes that were in Extreme Night City.\u201cIf it\u2019s this way, there is still a chance!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes gleamed. His target was only to gather enough contribution points in exchange for Grine Water, so he had no reason to create more trouble for himself.As for the price of Grine Water, it was 50 contribution points. This is to say, Leylin had to kill 5 Level 3 Acolytes on the other side, or even more Level 2 Acolytes, before gathering enough points.\u201cThe acolytes do not have the defensive force field that an official Magus has. If only I have time, I can analyse and choose my opponents, giving me enough contribution points!\u201dLeylin sized up the opposing acolytes and eyed some of the Level 3 Acolytes who obviously had low energy waves.They will be his prey!\u201cAlright! This secret plane will hold on for 3 days. In these 3 days, you will all be transported to different places in the secret plane. Protect your chest badges well. They are proof of your contributions and contains information on the return route!\u201dSiley waved his hands, and the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes formed a long line, entering the entrance of the secret plane in an orderly fashion.Under the mediation of Lighthouse of the Night, it obtained a few benefits. For example, they could enter the secret plane first, giving them a territorial advantage.However, Leylin understood that in front of his opponents\u2019 immense force, this little benefit for Abyssal Bone Forest Academy is simply a joke!The acolytes on both sides numbered almost the same, at 200 or so. However, the amount of Level 3 Acolyte on their side was at least 5 to 6 times more than what Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had.As for the acolytes of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, not to mention that most of them perished in the war, many of them could not make it back in time. Some even betrayed the academy and were killed while escaping. Such a result made Abyssal Bone Forest Academy inferior to the enemy in terms of elite forces.Under these circumstances, the chairman of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy still provoked the enemy in such a fashion. This made Leylin convinced of a rumour \u2013 The cause of this war was exactly the provocation by this Chairman Siley.As Leylin pondered on, he followed the acolyte in front of him into the secret plane.\u2026\u2026* Weng! *After entering the plane, Leylin\u2019s sight turned black. When he regained his senses, he was already standing on an unfamiliar plot of land.He felt dizzy, as it there were millions of bees flapping their wings. Leylin\u2019s face contorted, almost puking.[A negative effect is discovered on the Host. The symptoms are dizziness and vomiting. The primary diagnosis is that it is the aftereffect from travelling through spatial areas!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned. Leylin slapped his forehead, and opened his water bottle, splashing the cold water on his face, which made him feel much better.Looking the surroundings, what entered his sight were some small trees and shrubberies. There were always a few unknown fruit trees grown. On them were a type of purple-red fruit, and was slightly hairy on the surface.\u201cA.I. Chip, scan the surroundings!\u201dLeylin ordered. Immediately, a light blue 3D image was projected in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any danger!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and chanted an incantation.Along with the chanting noise, Leylin\u2019s face took on a morphing process. His eyes became larger, his lips paler, his hair changed colour, as if a totally different person. Even his height was shorter by a few inches.What was surprising was that after this Rank 0 spell, the energy waves from Leylin\u2019s body gradually weakened. It regressed from a Level 3 Acolyte to that of a Level 1 Acolyte slowly.[Shapeshifting spell (Modified), able to the change the height and appearance of a person, even the energy waves radiation! Consumption: 3 Magic Power, 3 Spiritual Force!]Shapeshifting spell was a spell that Leylin specially chose back when he was leaving the academy.After he advanced into a Level 3 Acolyte, he managed to reach the requirements for the A.I. Chip to make modifications to it. Back in Extreme Night City, he had already completed the modification for this Shapeshifting spell.Of course, no matter how much the A.I. Chip modified it, the Shapeshifting spell was after all a Rank 0 spell. It could only conceal his energy from acolytes, but not the detection from official Magi. If not, Leylin could have used the spell to make himself be a Level 2 Acolyte when he returned.Moreover, the Shapeshifting spell could only slightly lower the energy waves, allowing him to pass off as a low-level acolyte. It could not be used to conceal as a regular human or official Magus.However, the bloodbath in the secret plane was only for acolytes. So the disguise would not be found out by other acolytes.\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d Leylin looked at his reflection in a mirror.A blonde male acolyte, with the energy wave of a Level 1 Acolyte. Under this state, even if it was Bicky or Merlin, they wouldn\u2019t be able to recognise him.\u201cHowever, a person\u2019s habit cannot be changed so easily. I had better avoid meeting any familiar people. \u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed, and he disappeared into the shrubbery.\u2026\u2026As for other places in the secret plane, many acolytes had already begun to face off and there were several explosive yet short-lived battles.Beside a small pool, a black haired acolyte with a black cloak used lightning to obliterate an Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolyte into ashes.On the other side of the plane, Jayden\u2019s expression darkened, and suddenly countless vines shot out from his body, wrapping around an opposing acolyte from Whitewoods Castle into a ball of vines. Along with the contraction of the vine, fresh blood seeped through from the gaps of the vine, falling drop by drop on the floor.Battles like these happened constantly throughout the plane. On the whole, the Level 3 Acolytes from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy has an advantage in 1 versus 1 combat. As for other Level 1 and 2 acolytes, if they meet with these Level 3 Acolytes they would be killed immediately.A pockmarked brown haired acolyte wore the uniform of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut. His eyes were not big, but it was filled with anxiety and wariness, as he continuously scanned the surroundings.\u201cDamn it! I was actually sent here. The distance from the gathering point with the academy is too far\u2026\u201dThe acolyte hurried his step as he berated incessantly.* Peng! *Suddenly, a few large holes appeared from the ground. Yellow brown mud spikes emerged from it. In that instant, it pierced through that acolyte\u2019s grey robes and inner armour, rupturing a huge hole in the stomach area.With a look of anguish and disbelief, the acolyte\u2019s eyes were drained of life gradually with the blood and innards flowing out from his body.A dozen minutes later, the grasses in the surrounding shook. Leylin took off his green costume and walked towards the corpse of the acolyte.He crouched down and retrieved a red badge from the acolyte\u2019s chest.\u201cIt\u2019s only a Level 2 Acolyte! Value is 3 contribution points!\u201dLeylin kept the red badge in his robes. The various academies had different badges. Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s was black throughout in colour, while the ones from Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut were red. Naturally, the badge from Whitewoods Castle was white. Moreover, there were different shapes for the different levels of acolytes.\u201cA.I. Chip! Bring forth my stats!\u201d[Beep! Leylin Farlier, Level 3 Acolyte, Knight. Strength: 3.1, Agility: 3.3, Vitality: 3.7, Spiritual Force: 8(13.2), Magical Power: 8(13) \u2013 (Magical Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force). Status: Healthy]\u201cA Shapeshifting spell and Ground Spear has already consumed 5 points of my Magic Power and Spiritual Force. I have to conserve my Spiritual Force and try to use potions to battle!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed.This bloodbath between academies was not a competition or anything of that sort. According to the latest information received earlier, Leylin could already confirm that the opposing academies had chosen a few gathering points. It was for their acolytes to hurry to the area and then launch a joint attack on Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.As for the acolytes in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, their strength was greatly diminished. They could not agree on gathering points, if not they might be eradicated in one fell swoop. They could only scatter and fight their enemies.Leylin could already foresee that on the very first day, the Level 3 Acolyte in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy would be able to kill just a few acolytes of the enemy, and obtain a clear advantage. Once the enemies have gathered together, however, they would begin to hunt the acolytes from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy similar to chasing after wild ducks.Once he thought of the scenario where the magic spell formation set by the acolytes \u2013 when completed \u2013 could cover a large area and hone in on the acolytes, Leylin\u2019s scalp tingled.\u201cI could only rely on now to obtain more contribution points! If not as the time passes the difficulty will increase!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression turned gloomy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, I must defeat and kill as many of the enemy\u2019s acolytes as possible and scrape together enough of contribution points. \u00a0After that, depending on AI Chip\u2019s guidance, I will stand aside and avoid the majority of the enemy\u2026\u201dAfter deciding on his strategy, Leylin hurriedly looted the Magic Crystals and resources on the acolyte\u2019s body, leaving the scene.Two hours later after Leylin left, another acolyte came to the scene.\u201cIt\u2019s Greg!\u201d After seeing the corpse on the floor, the acolyte\u2019s pupils shrank.He came from the same academy as Greg. Seeing his comrade lying on the ground, this acolyte\u2019s expression turned pale white, as if wanting to puke.He muttered,\u00a0\u201cToo dangerous! This mission is too dangerous. Greg and I are only Level 2 Acolyte, we have come to this secret plane purely to die! If I knew earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have taken up this mission!\u201dRegrets filled the face of this acolyte.\u201cLooking at this wound, it should be a heavy physical attack with an Earth element spell. The caster should be a Level 3 Acolyte! To deal with a Level 2 Acolyte, he actually used such a despicable method. What a low-life\u2026.\u201dIt was not scary if the enemy was strong, but what was scary is if the enemy was strong and shameless!After understanding this reasoning the acolyte felt his scalp tingle. He felt as if a pair of bloodthirsty and greedy eyes was eyeing him from the shrubbery, locking down on its prey.\u201cNo way, I have to leave now!\u201dHe then bowed towards the corpse on the floor, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Although we used to be good friends, I am unable to give you a proper burial\u2026. Or it may be that the destiny of magicians was to die along the path to the pursuit of truth!\u201dThe acolyte made a prayer for his friend and prepared to leave.\u201cJe je! What a cold-blooded person, not even caring about his comrade\u2019s corpse!\u201dA female voice sounded from the air above.\u201cWho. . . who is that?\u201d The acolyte jumped back several metres like a rabbit, and in his hands, there was a black scroll tightly gripped.\u201cHaha! Look at him, like a pathetic bunny that has nowhere to escape in front of a predator!\u201dThe girl\u2019s voice sounded again. The crown of a nearby treetop shuddered, and a grey robed girl appeared in front of the acolyte.This female acolyte wore the uniform of Whitewoods Castle, and the acolyte who was prepared to fight for his life heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cHng! Trash!\u201dAnother male voice appeared from the surrounding, and a young man walked out from the shadows. He wore the insignia from Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut, and his right hand was silver in colour throughout. It radiated a mellow yet suave colour and reflected the shadows of the nearby shrubbery.\u201cThis appearance?\u201dThe acolyte\u2019s hand trembled, and the scroll dropped on the ground. \u201cSilver-Claw Saurun! You are Silver-Claw Saurun!\u201dSilver-Claw Saurun was considered one of the most vicious existence in the circle of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut\u2019s acolytes. Rumours have it that for a piece of ingredient needed for an experiment, he had massacred a whole village of regular humans !Although this was only a rumour, but this acolyte did witness the way Saurun treated his enemies \u2013 That was a devilish existence!Although Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut was a Light Magi faction, but there were bound to be some talented acolyte with outstanding abilities in battle. Evidently, this Saurun was one of them.Saurun did not bother about his junior who was frightened off his wits, and immediately walked to the corpse to inspect it.\u201cA very shrewd and ruthless method! Looking at the distance, the enemy should have activated the spell 20 metres away. This distance is the limit of Ground Spear! The enemy possesses an extremely high talent in his ability to use and calculate his Rank 0 spells from it.\u201dSaurun licked his silver right hand, giving off a sinister grin.\u201cHe is mine! I will hunt and kill him personally, and let the world know the consequences of incurring the wrath of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut!\u201d\u201cAs for you!\u201d Saurun looked at the trembling junior distastefully.\u201cScram!\u201d\u201cYes! Yes, sir!\u201d The acolyte nodded his head and hurriedly scampered away like a frightened little deer. In the blink of an eye, he traversed over several hundred metres, and even used a hastening spell on his body.Seeing the figure of the leaving acolyte, the girl smirked, \u201cWhat a useless trash! If not for the agreement between our academies, I would have killed him long ago!\u201d\u201cCompared to him, I have a high interest in this acolyte from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy!\u201dSaurun licked his lips, and the crimson red tongue seemed to be like that of a snake\u2019s, twisting and writhing. \u201cI am already anxious to know how the fresh blood of that acolyte tastes like!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cA.I. Chip! Maximise the detection area!\u201dLeylin gives his command as he followed and ran along a white cobblestone path.In the secret plane, the A.I. Chip\u2019s ability was also affected. Although the detection area has become smaller, it was still extremely handy for warning and scouting the way ahead.A light blue 3D image appeared in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes.In the map, the white cobblestone path seemed to be paved in the shape of a rune, winding its way through a circular garden in the middle of it.Moreover, the A.I. Chip caught traces of mild radiation on the ground here. This means that the magicians who had used this place before had operated it well, and even the soil had gotten affected.However, there was obviously nothing of value. It was evident that before this secret plane was activated; all the resources had already been ferreted out.\u201cIt seems like it is rather difficult to get lucky by stumbling over some magician\u2019s inheritance!\u201dLeylin shrugged his shoulders and continued walking.[Beep! Human creatures ahead, determined as acolytes. Numbers: 3!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned. Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed, and he secretly tailed them.This trio was formed by 2 male and 1 female acolyte. The male acolyte in the centre had obviously reached the cultivation of a Level 3 Acolyte.At this moment, this small group was heading towards the garden.\u201cDo we really have to take such a risk?\u201d The male acolyte who was behind began to grumble. \u201cWe had better still gather with the other acolytes! As long as we activate that spell formation, then there is nothing to be fearful of\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d The male acolyte in the middle did not turn his head, \u201cIf you go together with the main body, how much contribution points can you get? I have made enquiries about this place before. This was a deserted secret plane of magicians before! Secret plane! If we are able to dig up any remnants, then our lives in future would be without a worry. Also, we might even be able to advance into official Magi!\u201dAfter saying the last line, the acolyte in the middle show signs of longing and jealousy.\u201cIf you are unwilling to, then you can very well return! Look at Marie, she hasn\u2019t said a word!\u201d\u201cAlright! Alright!\u201dThe acolyte behind stopped talking, seemingly agreeing with the logic of the acolyte in the middle.Afterall, he and Marie were Level 2 Acolytes. Their standing was below that of the Level 3 Acolyte in the middle.\u201cThat\u2019s right, we also need to\u2026.\u201d The acolyte in the middle suddenly pointed ahead without finishing his sentence, \u201cLook quickly! What\u2019s that?\u201dOn a patch of empty ground in front of them, a grey robed Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolyte was looking back at them with frightened eyes. In his eyes, there was even a purple flower with spikes. From the centre of the flower, there were several strands of feelers which extended to the ground.Seeing the group of three come over, this Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolyte was obviously frightened as he ran away quickly.\u201cAn Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolyte! A Level 1 Acolyte at that! He\u2019s carrying a\u2026 Wolf Whisker Flower?\u201dThe acolyte\u2019s mouth in the middle gaped open and it seemed like several eggs could be stuffed in it.\u201cKill it! The Wolf Whisker Flower\u2019s is a valuable ingredient worth close to 1000 Magic Crystals!\u201dThe Level 3 Acolyte roared and gave chase directly.* Xiu Xiu! * The Level 2 Acolyte behind him was even quicker. A gust of green whirlwind appeared around his body, increasing his speed by multiple folds as he rushed towards the direction of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolyte.\u201cArgh! Damn it! Did I not say not to use it until the most critical moment?\u201dThe Level 3 Acolyte slapped his forehead, and then he hugged Marie with an arm, \u201cHold tight, I\u2019m increasing my speed!\u201d\u201cPut down the Wolf Whisker Flower!\u201d The Level 2 Acolyte spared no effort in chasing and shouting until his throat turned hoarse from the excitement.\u201cThis is only a Level 1 Acolyte. I will definitely be able to kill him. The Wolf Whisker Flower!\u201dAt this moment, a seed of insatiable greed and longing sprouted in the young acolyte\u2019s heart.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dJust when the young acolyte\u2019s thoughts went astray, the leader brought Marie and caught up to him.\u201cNo! Nothing!\u201d Seeing the cold gaze in the leader\u2019s eyes, the young acolyte seemed to have his face splashed by cold water. All the desires disappeared in a flash.\u201cDon\u2019t let him hide inside the shrubberies!\u201d The Level 3 Acolyte commanded.\u201cAlright!\u201dThe young acolyte steadied his heart and chased the acolyte in front of them.100 metres!50 metres!30 metres!20 metres!10 metres!The distance between both parties got smaller, until the point where the young acolyte could see his enemy\u2019s frightened face.\u201cWolf Whisker Flower! The Wolf Whisker Flower is ours now! Even if we divide it by 3, there are at least several hundreds of them!\u201dThe young acolyte held a fervent gaze, and looking at the escaping acolyte in front of him, in the same way as he would to innumerable Magic Crystals.Just as the trio caught up with the escaping acolyte, an explosion occurred.* Boom!!! *Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After costing Leylin some effort, he finally managed to rummage through them and picked up a few badges.\u201cA Level 3 Acolyte and two Level 2 Acolyte! A pretty good reward! Using an explosive potion as a triggering trap is indeed useful!\u201dLeylin was rather satisfied with his battle results. This was one of his few plans \u2013 using the Shapeshifting spell to pass off as a Level 1 Acolyte, baiting and luring enemy acolytes into a trap.With the detection of the A.I. Chip, several times Leylin\u2019s \u2018hunt\u2019 was flawless, and did not suffer from any interference.\u201cAlmost there!\u201d Leylin kept the badges well.He had to collect enough badges before the enemy united as a whole, and then hide until the battle was over.For this goal, after Leylin used the Shapeshifting spell and Ground Spear once to kill an acolyte, he began to avoid using his own Spiritual Force and Magic Power. Instead, he relied on potions and scrolls to battle, preserving his condition to the fullest in times of need.After cleaning up the area slightly, Leylin hurriedly left the place.Not long later, a male and female acolyte appeared in the vicinity.Looking at the obvious traces of an explosion, and the bits and remains of the Whitewoods Castle uniform, this time, the female acolyte\u2019s face darkened.\u201cI want to kill him! Then hang his head on my horse carriage for 100 days!\u201dThe female acolyte clenched her teeth.\u201cYou will have this chance very soon! We are getting closer and closer to this conniving acolyte\u2026.\u201dSilver-Clawed Saurun half knelt on the ground, and picked up a stalk of grass with sludge on it, before placing it into his mouth.\u201cHowever, I admire his courage. He actually dares to obstruct our acolytes!\u201d\u201cEnough of the nonsense! Have you found him?\u201dThe female acolyte asked.\u201cOver there!\u201d Saurun chewed on the blade of grass and closed his eyes for a moment. He then pointed to a direction and the both of them immediately headed in that direction.In a dense forest, on a withered tree with three branches sat a grey robed figure. His stature was rather short, as he looked up at the sky.\u201cDusk is coming!\u201d Leylin muttered.In the secret plane, there was neither the sun nor the moon, and not even any stars. However, the peculiar thing was that the bright sky would be strewn with white rays of light. At night, these rays of light would disappear, which distinguished between morning and night.It seems like there was a layer of a barrier which blocked the sun and moon at the same time.\u201cAfter a whole day, I have only received these much!\u201dLeylin counted the contribution points he had gotten.In his hands rested 6 badges. Amongst these, 5 of them were from Level 2 Acolytes, and 1 from a Level 3 Acolyte, which was the contribution of the trio\u2019s leader from before.It was extremely easy to distinguish between a Level 2 Acolyte and Level 3 Acolyte due the shape.\u201cAccording to the academy rules, an enemy Level 2 Acolyte is worth 3 contribution points while a Level 3 Acolyte is worth 10 contribution points. Those famous acolytes are separately categorised. Right now, I have at most 25 contribution points, just half of what I need to exchange for the Grine Water.\u201dLeylin\u2019s face was rather solemn.Although Leylin had gotten 25 contribution points in a day, it was because that the enemy acolytes were scattered across the secret plane and have not yet gathered.After a day and night, the acolytes in the other two factions would have definitely gathered. After forming a large army they would surround the acolytes of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.Under those circumstances, Leylin could barely protect his life, let alone obtain more badges from them.Under the ordeal from the war previously, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s casualty was extremely disastrous. They simply did not have time to nurture a new batch of elite forces to go against the opposing two factions.Moreover, if one walks the dark path often they will meet a ghost someday. Leylin did not believe that his simple trap could always work.[TL Note: Refers to people who, when they do bad things often, will definitely have a bad ending]\u201cIf it really isn\u2019t plausible, I might have to give up!\u201dLeylin\u2019s expression was determined. He was not someone to throw away his life for a little benefit.Even if his will was to become the king in the Magus World, which was with the prerequisite of preserving his life. If not, even if he had everything but lost his life, what was the purpose of it?\u201cA.I. Chip! Maintain detection area! Report immediately if there are any problems!\u201dAfter issuing the A.I. Chip the role of a sentry, he dug a hole in the ground behind the tree for disguise purposes, before sleeping inside the hollow of the tree.The acolytes of the 3 academies had to stay inside the secret plane for 3 days and 2 nights. Although the physical weariness can be overcome by various potions and methods, the mental fortitude was not that simple to replenish.Thankfully, Leylin had the A.I. Chip, and could let it act as a sentry. It would do a great job with its ability.Darkness blanketed the trees, time to time there were the cries of little worms.In the hollow of the tree, Leylin shut his eyes. First, he meditated, before falling into deep slumber.This was not a silent night. In the secret plane, various battles unfolded. Many colourful and enrapturing Rank 0 spells were cast by the acolytes. Ambushes, reverse traps, beauty traps and the shrewd plotting were endless. Many young acolytes left their lives in this secret plane.Of course, all these had nothing to do with Leylin.The second day, when the sky was filled with radiant light, the hollow of a tree shook, and a huge hole appeared. Within it, Leylin walked out.The power of nature was immense. After a night, many traces of blood diminished, and the various plants and animal tracks covered a huge amount of the intense battle marks left on the ground.Leylin casually stretched and looked at the hollow of the large tree.Leylin remembered clearly that he only made this opening last night. However, it was gradually mending back into whole. Leylin even discovered a few green coloured sprouts nearby the opening.\u201cIt seems like the flora and fauna in this magical plane has vitality much higher than the physical world!\u201dLeylin stroked his chin and stretched his hand to pick a budding sprout with morning dew on it. \u201cA.I. Chip! Scan the composition and record!\u201d[Beep! Comparing to the plant database. An abnormality is found!]The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned. In front of Leylin was a green and light blue image overlapping. Moreover, in the centre of the image, was a red area that seemed like an octopus which was spreading its tentacles.\u201cRecord composition!\u201d Leylin ordered.\u201cWho knows if there\u2019ll be a use in future?\u201d Leylin comforted himself, and then began to pick a few more plants and herbs for recording purposes.[Warning! Warning! There is an extremely strong radiation coming from 523m in the Southeast. Primarily determined as acolytes using Rank 0 spells!]Just when Leylin was picking out a green leaf with red veins, the alert from the A.I. Chip sounded.\u201cA chance!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eyes flashed.Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle were allies. Their acolytes wouldn\u2019t fight with the other, so if there was any battle, it definitely involved Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes!\u201cWith the A.I. Chip detection, I\u2019m not afraid of being cornered if I am more cautious!\u201dLeylin patted his chest. Under the grey robes inner layer, a solid pendant lay against his chest.\u201cOr maybe, it\u2019s time to test the might of the Fallen Star Pendant!\u201dLeylin whipped his grey robes up and concealed himself as he headed towards where the battle was.* Boom! *As he got closer, Leylin could feel the intensity of the radiation from the spells. This degree could only be produced by a Level 3 Acolyte. Moreover, it belonged to one of the stronger acolytes.Towards the enemy Level 3 Acolyte which had a chance of advancing into a Magus before 20, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy opened a sky-high reward for it. They bumped the value up from 20 to 100 contribution points.This is to say, if Leylin managed to pull this feat off, not only could he exchange it for Grine Water, he might even be able to exchange for a Rank 1 defensive spell model.However, Leylin\u2019s legs halted, having a strong desire suddenly to leave.To him, one Grine Water was enough for him to use in his experiments. The rest were just unnecessary, and it was not worth it to fight against these Level 3 Acolytes.Moreover, there was another concern on his mindAlthough the bounties of those popular Level 3 Acolyte were high, there were always professors behind them. Moreover, their respective professors would have definitely spent countless efforts on them.Even if Leylin used his toe to think, he could definitely ascertain that the Magi have laid spells on their apprentices. The moment he kills one of them, his appearance and other information would be known by the Magus.In front of an official Magus, the Shapeshifting spell was obsolete!Even if Chairmen Siley protected Leylin after the bloodbath, he did not want to be drawing all the unwanted attentions to him and even be marked by an official Magus.All in all, the risk was too great, yet the benefit was too little. Leylin would rather look for some Level 2 Acolyte or weary Level 3 Acolyte to kill than to invoke the wrath of those geniuses.He did not hesitate to turn around.Suddenly, a male voice sounded, \u201cHaha! Jayden! You have finally landed in my hands!\u201d\u201cJayden?!\u201d Leylin\u2019s footsteps halted, and turned back.The location of the battle was in the middle of some trees. And the trees right now have already been destroyed, showing a large clearing.Leylin stealthily hid to watch the battle.In the centre of the clearing, Jayden who wore a hunter\u2019s attire was half kneeling on the ground. There were even vines coiling around him, acting as armour.In front of him, a black-robed, male figure let out a maniacal laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One day you will land in my hands!\u201dThe black-haired acolyte laughed wildly. With the wave of his hand, a blue streak of lightning faster than supersonic directly landed on Jayden\u2019s armour of vines.* Sssii! *Jayden was sent flying, as if a train had knocked into him, and crashed onto the ground forming a large hole.\u201cHow is it? Where is the arrogance back then when you stole my piece of lightning core?\u201dThe black-haired acolyte taunted, before casting another spell at Jayden. It opened a gap on Jayden\u2019s body.The green vines had a huge opening now, revealing Jayden\u2019s skin. A large patch of his skin was charred, and Leylin could faintly catch a whiff of barbeque smell.\u201cDon\u2019t think a broken Magic Artifact can save you!\u201dIt seemed like the hatred the black-haired acolyte had for Jayden was not small, as his glee in seeking revenge was shown on his face.\u201cA.I. Chip! Inspect Jayden!\u201dLeylin did not dare to scan the black-haired acolyte and chose the severely injured Jayden as his target.[Beep! Jayden. Strength: 1.9, Agility: 2.7, Vitality: 2.1 (3.5), Spiritual Force: 3 (10.8). Status: Mild injury. Paralysis!]No matter how much the opponent taunted him, Jayden did not speak a single word. He only used an icy gaze to stare at his enemy.\u201cNot good! Jayden is also a Level 3 Acolyte now with a Magic Artifact, but he actually could not beat the opponent!\u201dLeylin\u2019s thoughts quickly surmised.Leylin was attracted by Jayden\u2019s name to this place out of curiosity but did not intend to risk his life for him.To tell the truth, if Jayden\u2019s enemy was not strong, Leylin would have struck as Jayden had disclosed information to him previously. But now the enemy\u2019s strength seemed to be extremely strong, and Leylin was somewhat hesitant.\u201cA.I. Chip! Inspect the target\u2019s data and calculate the winning rate in a battle!\u201dLeylin ordered.[Beep! Mission establishing, beginning fight simulation\u2026.]The A.I. Chip calculated rapidly and came to a conclusion. [Host\u2019s winning rate is 77%. Possible scenario: Death of the target, light damage to the host!]\u201cThis probability is rather low!\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cLook! There are really people there!\u201dJust was Leylin was hesitant, the voice of a female travelled over. It was extremely familiar, and Leylin even heard the alluring pants of its owner not too long ago.On the other side of the battlefield, Bicky and another female acolyte came over.\u201cIt\u2019s Bicky! Why would she come here?\u201dLeylin inhaled deeply. He suddenly felt that things were going to be extremely troublesome.\u201cThere is someone fighting. Ah! Senior Jayden!\u201dThe female acolyte with Bicky recognised Jayden, and she seemed to have some affection for him. Once she saw him injured, she hurried over.\u201cA girl? Your friend?\u201dThe black-haired acolyte\u2019s brows furrowed and suddenly clapped. \u201cYou brought me shame by stealing my possession. Today I will return it in multiple folds to you. For instance, claiming this woman right before your eyes\u2026.\u201dThe black-haired acolyte sniggered lecherously, and his hands moved and fluttered like a butterfly.* Sssii! *The blue lightning of snake continuously formed on his hands and transformed into a metal\u00a0chain.It\u00a0pierced the fireball casted hurriedly by the female acolyte, and knocked her to the ground.\u201cMolly!\u201d Bicky was frightened, and she hurried over too.\u201cThis idiot!\u201dLeylin helplessly shook his hand as he got up.He still harboured some feelings for Bicky, and would take a risk for her under the circumstances that his life was not threatened.Of course, his largest assurance was the winning rate that the A.I. Chip provided him!If the A.I. Chip\u2019s calculation did not give him such a winning rate, he might have chosen to leave. After advancing into a Rank 1 Magus he would then return and seek revenge for Bicky.Furthermore, Leylin was completely unwilling to help if he had to pay the price of being critically injured or even death to win.On the other hand, if it were only some mild injuries, Leylin felt that Bicky deserved his help.\u201cActually, deep down I am an extremely rational, not to mention unfeeling and apathetic person!\u201dLeylin scoffed at himself and hurriedly moved, closing the distance of a dozen metres and held onto Bicky.\u201cDon\u2019t go over!\u201d\u201cWho\u2026 Are you?\u201d Bicky gave a puzzled stare to the guy in front of her.Leylin\u2019s Shapeshifting spell was still in effect and even his voice was altered through potions. Therefore, Bicky did not recognise Leylin at all.\u201cA person who has come to save you!\u201d Leylin\u2019s voice was hoarse, and directly locked gazes with the black-haired acolyte.\u201cAn interesting insect. It was you who was hiding in the corner earlier, huh?\u201dThe black-haired acolyte clenched his fist, as blue lightning coiled around it, emitting sparks every now and then.A few bolts of electricity were shot into the ground, and each exploded, creating many small holes. The shattered stones and mud flew up beside Leylin, and were blocked by his acolyte\u2019s robes and soon fell back to the ground.\u201cAn electric element acolyte and it also seems like his affinity towards it is rather high!\u201dLeylin gradually withdrew the cross blade hung on his waist, \u201cThis will be a tough battle that I never had before!\u201dTo prevent Bicky from recognising him, he could not use some common methods used by Potion Masters. He could only use those that he learnt when he left the academy.\u201cHowever, this is also the best chance to test my abilities! Back then in Extreme Night City, Murphy and the rest were all people who had retired, and their battle abilities were rubbish! As for the acolytes in the market, I could not strike, if not I would have become their sworn enemy!\u201dAnd this acolyte in front of his was obviously strong in his academy.Leylin licked his lips and suddenly felt a strong battle desire surging from his chest and spreading to his four limbs. He could even hear the blood which was rapidly coursing, and made his eyes a little bloodshot.This was a man\u2019s hot bloodedness and desire for battle!\u201cHaha\u2026 Look what I found? Merely a Level 1 Acolyte who dares to draw a sword against me?\u201dThe black-haired acolyte sneered and his expression became colder and more resolute, \u201cKiddo! I will give you one last chance. Hurry and kneel to the revered Lord Torash and admit your wrongdoing, and beg for my magnanimity! On account of my good mood, I may even pardon your sins\u2026.\u201d* Shing! *In an instant, a silver arc of light flashed. It crossed the distance of a dozen metres and struck at the black haired Torash.The silver arc of light materialised into a cross blade which brought on a heavy killing intent. The aura emitted from it even pressed down on the grasses.The black-haired Torash had a startled expression. Suddenly, several green runes formed by lightning appeared underneath his leather shoes and crept to his thighs.As if under some stimulation, Torash jumped backed several metres and avoided the attack.* Bang! * The cross blade landed and slashed a cross shape hole on the ground.The grey shadow flashed, and Leylin appeared at the original position of the black-haired acolyte. He gripped the cross blade in his hands and put on a regretful expression.With some lingering fear, Torash touched his face and felt a gash, which was several centimetres deep, on it.Although Leylin\u2019s attack earlier did not strike the opponent directly, the force it brought already caused a gash on his face.\u201cSo fast! If not for the hastening lightning rune my professor gave me, I might have been a corpse already!\u201dVery soon the fear subsided from Torash\u2019s face and it turned into a contorted expression of rage.\u201cYou\u2026 You actually dare to harm the mighty Lord Torash, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dHowever, his rage did not muddle his mind. Although Torash\u2019s expression showed that he couldn\u2019t wait to kill Leylin, he retrieved a scroll from his waist sack.\u201cI admit that your speed is extremely fast. You should, at least, have the physical ability of a Knight, right? But so what? Although a Knight\u2019s body is stronger than a regular human and is not afraid of steel swords and large axes, it is just meaningless under a magician\u2019s spell!\u201d* Sssii! * Torash pulled the scroll open, and an icy cold spell was activated, covering the whole of the battlefield.Countless white mist condensed in the air, turning into ice and spread across the land.The surrounding temperature decreased by dozens of degrees. Bicky pulled the friend on the ground to the back of Leylin. Her body shivered as she looked at Leylin\u2019s back, obviously grateful and puzzled at the same time.Although she had no memory of this person, Bicky had a strong feeling that she knew this strong person who had suddenly appeared in front of her.\u201cWho exactly, are you?\u201d Bicky looked at Leylin\u2019s figure, her expression complicated.At this moment, Torash\u2019s scroll had finished its activation. With him at the heart of it, the domain of several hundred metres was covered by frost. There were even a layer of snow and ice on the trees and plants as if it was the coldest period of winter.[Beep! Host is affected by frost. Speed is estimated to decrease by 43%] The unfeeling A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.\u201cNo matter how fast a Knight is, as long as his speed is rendered useless, then it would just be a sitting duck, waiting on a dining table to be feasted on!\u201dLooking at Leylin\u2019s figure whose hair and brows have already been frozen in ice, Torash smirked. \u201cI can slightly alter this spell. The frost on you is definitely more at a lower temperature than the two girls. How is it?\u201d\u201cA pity!\u201dLeylin felt rather regretful in his heart. Looking at the spell formation of this acolyte\u2019s shoes and the scroll, he knew that Torash had a high attainment in spell formation. If not, it would mean that his professor was an expert in this area, to be able to customise this spell for Torash.Leylin really wanted to sit down and discuss alchemy and runes with him, but alas, he was just being delusional.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it was any regular human, they would have long since frozen to death!\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention to go against you. As long as you let go of those two girls, I will leave immediately!\u201dLeylin used the cross blade and pointed at Bicky\u2019s direction, in return for her grateful gaze.\u201cNo! Get him to release senior Jayden, if not I\u2019m not leaving!\u201dThe girl beside Bicky, who was saved, still maintained her resolve.Leylin rolled his eyes, if not for Bicky; did she really think that he would appear in the name of justice? Moreover, looking at the situation again, Jayden had apparently deeply offended the other party previously, so why would he let go of Jayden so easily?As expected, after listening to the female acolyte, Torash\u2019s gaze turned frostier, and immediately he waved his hand. A thick and long lightning streaked across the sky, directly landing onto Jayden.* Bang! * The vines on Jayden\u2019s body fell and he fainted. Moreover, his whole body turned into a black colour, as if like a pile of scorched rubble.\u201cMy apologies, I don\u2019t wish to let anyone present go today!\u201dTorash waved his hands.According to the A.I. Chip\u2019s detection, although Jayden\u2019s outer appearance seemed to be terrifying, there was still a life force pulsating in him. Therefore, Leylin did not bother anymore about him. Instead, Leylin was more cautious about this acolyte in front of him.\u201cA Lightning element is indeed one of the stronger powers. Although Jayden\u2019s Magic Artifact belongs to an attack type with minimal defense, he was still defeated so quickly! No, it could be that the other party had been toying with him the same way a cat would with a mouse!\u201d\u201cNow, it is my turn!\u201dTorash, who was on the other side charged directly at him and brandished a short black staff in his hand.\u201cHng! Trying to be mystifying!\u201d Leylin snorted and used the cross blade to slash at him.* Peng! * The two weapons clashed. Under the frost effect, Leylin speed unavoidably took a slower turn. The original mirage effect could now not be used by him, where Torash caught dozens of his sword slashes.Leylin\u2019s Strength was obviously higher than his opponent, and his cross blade was of superior quality to his opponent\u2019s short metal staff.After the two weapons clanged, Leylin used the force in both his arms and pressed the sword down on his opponent.\u201cHehe\u2026 Your Strength isn\u2019t too bad!\u201dAlthough the blade was just centimetres away from his face, there was no fear on Torash face. Looking at Leylin, his gaze held some ridicule and\u2026 the savage thrill of retaliation?Leylin felt something was amiss, and hurriedly let go of the cross blade as he jumped away.In that very moment when he released his hands, several bolts of lightning extended from Torash\u2019s arms and shot at the cross blade, even up to Leylin\u2019s hands!In the moment when the lightning current was about to hit him, Leylin forwent his sword and evaded the attack.\u201cToo late! Torash looked at Leylin\u2019s figure and chanted an incantation.The current from the staff directly bore through the mud and extended like the root of a tree. In the blink of an eye, it caught up to Leylin.* Zzzii! \u201cOnce the black lightning landed on the ground, it reappeared from the ground right in front of Leylin.As if a poisonous snake, the blue lightning charged at Leylin.\u201cAh!\u201d Bicky who was on the other side involuntarily screamed and she clasped her mouth.* Ping! * Suddenly, a layer of silver membrane appeared on Leylin\u2019s body.This layer of membrane immediately draped over Leylin\u2019s whole body covering every inch, even his orifices were not left out.On the silvery membrane, there were several pale reflections of flickering red jewels, giving off a mystical lustre.The blue lightning took on the shape of a python with a crazed leer and opened its jaws. Lightning-made razor-sharp teeth directly bit on the membrane.* Sssii Sssii! *A similar sound to metal smashing porcelain was heard, and the ear piercing noise travelled across the whole battlefield. Bicky involuntarily covered her ears, to let her nerves calm down.The lightning on Leylin\u2019s body exploded, and from time to time a few poisonous-snake-like lightning currents converged and let off an explosive noise.Looking on, Leylin seemed to be a silver statue, who was receiving the blessings of lightning bolts.The lightning attack lasted for close to thirty seconds before it dissipated.There was a shocked expression on Leylin\u2019s face as he looked at the indication given by the A.I. Chip.[\u2026 Host is subjected to Lightning-based attacks. Degree of power: 9! Fallen Star Pendant has automatically activated, energy consumed: 23.99%. Host has successfully blocked the attack and sustains no injuries!]\u201cToo careless!\u201d The opponent\u2019s lightning could actually pass through normal physical materials. Moreover, it could use the layer of frost on the ground as a conductor to initiate the attacks!Leylin looked at his hands. Knowing that his opponent excelled in the Lightning element, Leylin had already put on leather gloves before the battle.However, the hands that gripped the cross blade earlier were still rather numb.There was also a precursive condition for the Fallen Star Pendant to be activated. Leylin had customised it to activate only when his life was in peril. Otherwise, any raindrop from the sky would activate the Fallen Star Pendant and finish the consumption of energy in the Magic Artifact.Previously, because Leylin had let go of his sword early on, the damage from the electric current to his body was extremely little. It was not enough to achieve the criteria to activate the Fallen Star Pendant.Of course, due to the conductivity, the lightning was too fast, and Leylin still received an attack from it in his hands.At last, Leylin backed away and under his opponent\u2019s chase, he suffered a 9 degree lightning attack. If he did not defend further, his life would be in peril. Hence, the criterion for the activation of Fallen Star Pendant was achieved, where a layer of membrane immediately appeared from his body.The Fallen Star Pendant\u2019s defense could negate attacks up to 15 degrees. This is to say, if Torash attack could not exceed this degree, Leylin\u2019s body was like a turtle shell until the energy of the Fallen Star Pendant was depleted.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Gazing at Leylin who seemed injured, Torash\u2019s mouth was opened widely, enough to fit several duck eggs in it.\u201cThis is an attack my professor has personalised for me. It complements with my affinity and my degree of attack is at least 9! How could you be fine?\u201d\u201cI understand now! You definitely must have a defensive Magic Artifact on your body!\u201d Black-haired Torash pondered and quickly understood the truth.\u201cAlthough it is only a low-grade defence Magic Artifact, there will definitely be many official Magi who will be interested in it\u2026.\u201dTorash licked his lips and a fervent greed appeared on his face.For this bloodbath, both sides signed an agreement not to use any strength that was above an acolyte!Any person, scroll of Magic Artifact which exceeded this criterion would be teleported out in a flash and had no chance of getting in the secret plane.Although Leylin\u2019s Magic Artifact was precious, it still belonged to the low-grade series.In Leylin\u2019s eyes, these low-grade Magic Artifacts had might below that of official Magi.Any Rank 1 spell\u2019s degree of attack was 20 and above. If Leylin used the Fallen Star Pendant to block against them, he would definitely be slain immediately, not leaving a trace behind.However, amongst the acolytes, the Fallen Star Pendant was a divine item!Furthermore, even an official Magus would not mind having an extra layer of defense, no matter how small it was. However, the defence from Fallen Star Pendant was activated from the pendant and did not affect the owner in one bit.The value of a low-grade defence Magic Artifact was at least 5 times that of Jayden\u2019s attack type Magic Artifact!Which is to say, right now, besides the A.I. Chip, the most valuable thing that Leylin had was this Magic Artifact!\u201cKill him! Kill him! Then that Magic Artifact is mine!\u201dTorash\u2019s eyes turned bloodshot, \u201cEven if it is a Magic Artifact, there is a limitation. Once it\u2019s depleted of energy, before the next recharge, it would be a piece of trash! However, could I last until that long?\u201d\u201cEven if I\u2019m unable to keep him here today, I can gather other students to chase after him\u2026 Wait a minute, maybe there is a better idea?\u201dAfter seeing the Fallen Star Pendant, Torash did not harbour any hopes of holding Leylin here today. However, the flames of desire slowly invaded his logic.Suddenly, Torash saw Bicky who was behind Leylin and his eyes flashed as he made a proposition.\u201cYou! You are very concerned with the green-haired girl behind right?\u201d Torash questioned, \u201cDon\u2019t deny it; jumping out to save her is the best proof!\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Leylin\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cGive me your Magic Artifact, and I\u2019ll let her go. Not only that, even Jayden and the other girl, I\u2019ll let them go too!\u201d Torash licked his lips.\u201cHaha\u2026.\u201d After hearing that unexpected speech, Leylin shook his head.\u201cYes! I can\u2019t keep you here today as you have the Magic Artifact. However, I can definitely retain the green haired girl, and even kill her\u2026.\u201dTorash changed his words to a threat.\u201cPlease do!\u201d Leylin stretched his hands and gestured.\u201cYou\u2026 Why would you\u2026.\u201d This reply made Torash extremely shock.\u201cI only have some involvement with her, which is why I wanted to rescue her. If the loss is too great, however, then it wouldn\u2019t be worth it! Furthermore, after I lose this defensive Magic Artifact, how can I still be able to haggle with you?\u201dLeylin looked at Torash with ridicule in his eyes.He deeply understood that towards people making threats, you must never show that you are extremely mindful of the thing in their hands. If not, you would be baited into more and more demands.Even if Torash really killed Bicky today, Leylin would only seek revenge for her another day. Therefore, if he wanted to use Bicky to threaten Leylin, there were only two words for it: dream on!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must have said it on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201dTorash\u2019s pair of cunning eyes flitted to the back of Leylin.\u201cDid you see that, after listening to your words, your little girlfriend is extremely heartbroken!\u201d\u201cHow lame!\u201d Leylin did not even turn back.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s time to end this!\u201d Leylin looked up the sky, and the light rays were even brighter than dawn.Magicians were intelligent beings. By threatening Leylin, Torash only harboured a negligible hope. His main purpose was most likely to stall for time until other acolytes could support him.The Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes in the secret plane were at an extreme disadvantage. Now it was also the second day, and the enemy acolytes would have already gathered. Once Leylin was discovered, a scene of calling and shouting for him to be killed would happen.At that time, the innumerable spells which could cover the sky and earth would rain upon him. Even if Leylin had the Fallen Star Pendant, its energy was limited.\u201cWhat end?\u201dA few ingredients appeared in Torash\u2019s hands, as he stepped several steps backwards.\u201cOf course, it is to end this silly game!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes flashed and chanted an incantation.* Sssii! * A reddish-green gas spread across upon the icy ground.When the frost and a thin layer of mist came in contact with the red gas, the temperature of the battlefield rose immediately by a few degrees.As for the green mist, it continued to spread across the field. The visibility lowered immediately, and one could not see beyond a 3 metres radius.\u201cThis is a spell I specially prepared for you, Flaming Cloud of Afterlife!\u201dLeylin spoke softly. Earlier when he exchanged senseless sentences with the opponent, he was actually wildly using the A.I. Chip for calculations. Furthermore, he set up the field, planting various types of ingredients in it.\u201cJust a mere corroding gas!\u201dTorash disdained it. On his whole body, there raged a blue current. If one described the current on his body as just a thin layer before, now it could be said to have already expanded to be 1 centimetre thick.\u201cGo!\u201d Torash pointed, and the blue current directly charged into the reddish-green mist.* Sssii! *Where the electricity went, the reddish green gas evaporated, revealing the area around it.However, Torash\u2019s smug face was not maintained for more than a moment before it changed.\u201cThis energy wave! You! You are not some Level 1 Acolyte, but a Level 3 Acolyte!\u201dFrom the centre of the reddish-green gas, energy fluctuations could be blatantly felt. His own electric snake was immediately corroded by the green mist. Furthermore, a trace of green colour continuously extended along the trajectory of the lightning towards Torash.\u201cNo!\u201d Torash gave a profound look to Leylin who was in the midst of clouds and mist and then simply broke into a run.Leylin swung his arms and a green magic ring entirely enveloped Torash and he slowed down as if he was bound by chains.*Sssii!!* A red-green smoky cloud spread close to Torash and it wrapped itself around his body.The smoke grew denser and soon, Leylin could not even see Torash.* Crackle! * Under the Flaming Cloud of Afterlife came the sounded of lightning and thunder sounds, along with Torash\u2019s cries of anguish.Leylin smiled coldly. This Cloud of Afterlife had been modified by Leylin, and was specially inserted with the most conducive energy particles for the Lightning element. It could be said that it was the bane of all Lightning element acolytes!After hearing the wails within the Cloud of Afterlife, and the noises of flesh corroding, a disturbed expression appear on Bicky\u2019s face.\u201cArgh! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dA dozen seconds later, Torash charged out of the Cloud of Afterlife at Leylin, bringing a ball of cloud that clung to his body.\u201cAh!\u201d After seeing Torash\u2019s appearance, Bicky and the other acolyte let out a terrified scream.At this moment, Torash was half-naked, with his clothing almost dissolved. On his body were many abscesses which were leaking with thick yellow pus.One of his eyeballs had fallen out of its socket, held hanging there by a few bloody tissues still attached to it.Along with a few missing pieces of flesh on his face, right now Torash looked like an imitation of Leylin\u2019s corpse from the previous world.\u201cAlthough acolytes can use energy particles to strengthen their Vitality, such a strong life force is still extremely rare!\u201dLeylin stretched his hands, and a black wrist guard automatically extended its reach, finally turning into a black bow where a sharp arrow with a reverse spike was notched on it.[Wind speed and humidity in calculation, adjusting trajectory!]Under the aid of the A.I. Chip, right now Leylin\u2019s archery skills were that of a bow master.* Chi Xiu Xiu!* Four arrows were shot from the bow and like black rays of light, streaked across the sky, directly penetrated through Torash\u2019s 4 limbs, nailing him to the ground.\u201cUrgh Urgh!\u201d Torash struggled. The flesh on his body continuously fell to the ground, and it seemed that even his voice was now affected. Right now, he could not even voice a single word.\u201cWe\u2026 Won?\u201d Looking at this scene, Bicky\u2019s eyes looked somewhat bewildered.\u201cEn! It\u2019s us who won, but there are still some things to do!\u201dLeylin notched his bow again and pointed to the girl beside Bicky, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMo\u2026Molly! Sir!\u201d Witnessing Leylin using the Cloud of Afterlife to torture Torash in such an unthinkable manner, the female acolyte yielded very quickly.\u201cVery good! Molly! Go up there and take down the severed head of the enemy who tried to murder your friend!\u201d\u201cNo! You can\u2019t do this! Molly is still a kid! I! I will be able to do it for her\u2026.\u201dBicky stood up.* Xiu! * At the same time, an arrow shot past the fine hair beside her ears, flying to a distance behind.\u201cDo not countermand my orders. If not, the next arrow will be through your brain!\u201d Leylin\u2019s eye flashed coldly, seemingly fiendish.\u201cI will go!\u201d That female acolyte called Molly spoke up and Bicky turned silent.\u201cI like girls who are obedient!\u201d Leylin nodded his head and used an arrow to point at Torash who was thrashing on the ground. \u201cSo then! Hurry and do it!\u201dThe female acolyte gritted her teeth. She took out a knife which was embedded in jewels from her robes and walked forward. Looking on at Torash who was pinned to the ground on his four limbs by four arrows, her expression was extremely complicated.It was this person, who was deemed as a potential Magus, a genius acolyte who possessed a Magic Artifact. However, right now his four limbs were pinned to the ground as if a dog that was waiting to be slaughtered.This feeling extended like vines, spreading its reach in her heart. \u201cIs this the taste of power? How great!\u201dLooking at the female acolyte raising her dagger, Leylin moved quickly and grabbed Bicky, retreating dozens of metres behind.\u201cLet me go, you sick pervert!\u201d Bicky continuously thrashed.From her aspect, this acolyte that Leylin shapeshifted into was a stranger to her. Yet he had an unthinkable power and he was extremely emotionless.Earlier he said that he was rescuing her, yet in the blink of an eye he pointed an arrow at her and even fired it!In Bicky\u2019s heart, right now Leylin was now a somewhat powerful madman.Moreover, in the Magus World, due to problems occurring from experiment and meditations, it was likely possible that their mental state was affected.Leylin shrugged his shoulders. After maintaining a distance away, he let go of Bicky.At this moment, both their eyes were shining bright and staring at the female acolyte who was holding a dagger before Torash.\u201cToo rash! Too rash! The winning rate that the A.I. Chip provided earlier was not considered high. Moreover, it said that I could only kill this acolyte after paying the price of sustaining light injuries. However, right now he is just a piece of flesh on a chopping board! For me to butcher!\u201d\u201cUnless\u2026 There are some unknown trump cards on his body!\u201d Leylin\u2019s intelligent eyes gazed.After holding the dagger, Molly looked in Leylin\u2019s direction again. Right now the arrow notched in his bow was still aimed towards her. She could only despair as she closed her eyes and pierced the dagger downwards!\u201cWhat a pity!\u201d At this moment, Torash suddenly opened his eyes, revealing death and unresolved regrets in his eyes.\u201cI never thought that I would really use this move one day, much less to deal with a mere Level 2 Acolyte!\u201d* Boom! *In his voice, countless lightning appeared from Torash\u2019s body. These lightning were extremely violent, and spread through Torash\u2019s body in an instant, even converging inward.After the lightning had reached an extremely small dot, Torash\u2019s body suddenly exploded, with the noise of the huge boom reverberating throughout the area.The sound wave continuously swept past everything, uprooting plants and sending pebbles flying.\u201cBe careful!\u201d In the moment when the explosion occurred, Leylin immediately pulled Bicky to his side and smashed a potion on the ground \u2013 Trevor\u2019s Revolving Shield Potion!At the same time, the Fallen Star Pendant on his neck also emitted a dusky glow.Under the protection of the potion and the layer of light, the ground under Leylin and Bicky was not touched the slightest. It was even taller than the surrounding area of a certain length.[Estimated target\u2019s degree of power: 16! Spell type \u2013 Corpse Combustion: 45.7%, Electric Field: 34.5%]Looking at the data from the A.I. Chip, Leylin finally understood how did the A.I. Chip come up with the winning rate.Although he had the Fallen Star Pendant, it could only resist spells which were 15 degrees or lower. As for Torash\u2019s final self-destruct explosion, it was obviously at 16 degrees, which could break the defence of the Fallen Star Pendant and cause harm to Leylin.However, the last hit was done by Molly, while Leylin distanced himself dozens of metres behind. Not only did he suffer little collateral damage from the explosion, there was even time to put up his defenses.\u201cHowever, a degree of 16 huh? It is already close to that of a Magus value, he is indeed a top acolyte from a large faction!\u201dTowards his dead enemies, Leylin never spared his praises for them.\u201cYou murderer! Executioner! You knew long ago that the opponent would self-destruct, didn\u2019t you?\u201dBicky who was in Leylin\u2019s embrace pushed him away, her pair of pretty eyes filled with tears.The ground where Torash self-destructed turned into a large pit now; together with bits and pieces of clothing and charred flesh. In the explosion earlier, Torash and that female acolyte, Molly, naturally had died together. Even the remnants of their corpses were mixed together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was fortunate that he had altered his appearance beforehand, if not, it would have been hard to face Bicky.However, he could only do this much.Leylin came and stood next to the large pit formed by the explosion, and a round badge fell near his foot. The originally bright and beautiful badge was now covered with dust and it also had some residual flesh upon it.\u201cJust from a look, it seems that this acolyte must be a genius in his academy! His badge, at the very least, would be worth 50 contribution points!\u201dLeylin was still contemplating the badge lying beside his feet, with some hesitation.Now, this badge was under his foot; if he stooped down, he could then get it into his hand.With it, Leylin\u2019s contribution points would be enough to exchange for one portion of Grine Water when the bloodbath was over.He heard about the information regarding advancement into an official Magus from the vengeful spirit Roman and was rather hesitant in using such a method to breakthrough. However, the Grine Water was extremely valuable, and even if he did not use it, obtaining it and using the A.I. Chip to research on its composition was also a good idea.However, the badges of a few extraordinary acolytes from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy and the opposing academies have been specially marked. As long as Leylin handed over the badge, it would be equivalent to admitting that he was the murderer of Torash!Leylin would never forget that there is a professor standing behind Torash!\u201cMaybe, giving this badge to Jayden or Merlin is a good idea!\u201dLeylin stepped on the badge below his feet and smiled.He had had a quick look earlier; Jayden had been knocked out at the border of the battlefield. Although he seemed to be in a miserable state, he managed to preserve his life, and there did not seem to be any life-threatening injuries.\u201cHowever, there are still two worms that I have to deal with!\u201dLeylin looked at the shrubbery at the side and suddenly flung two fiery red explosive potions at it.* Boom! * The two test tubes collided in midair, creating a large flame which seemed to blanket over the shrubbery.* Xiu Xiu! * In the moment when the flame engulfed the shrubbery, two black figures flew out from it, landing on an empty patch of ground.Silver-Claw Saurun and another blonde acolyte looked at the pit where Torash self-destructed, their expressions grim.\u201cTorash, that lightning wielder, actually died by this fellow\u2019s hands. Oh god, this fellow is a monster!\u201dSaurun looked at the expressionless Leylin, his heart roaring wildly. Lightning wielder Torash, that was a monster whose reputation was not beneath that of his silver claw! Yet today he actually died by Leylin\u2019s hands, so what kind of strength did Leylin wield?\u201cIf I knew he was that powerful, I wouldn\u2019t be this foolish to chase after him!\u201dAt this moment, the feeling of regret slowly engulfed Saurun\u2019s heart.\u201cWhat should be done?\u201d The blonde female acolyte looked at Saurun and cursed him inwardly when she saw that he was already of a mind to retreat.\u201cWhat else? We have to see if the opponent will let us go!\u201dSaurun waved his hands and bowed slightly to Leylin. \u201cRespected acolyte who hails from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, your strength has convinced me, and I, Saurun, will never hold any ill intents towards you in future\u2026.\u201dTowards Saurun\u2019s gesture of succumbing, the female blond acolyte pursed her lips but never spoke a word.After seeing Leylin\u2019s might and brutality, even she was somewhat afraid!As for the revenge of his fellow acolytes? Although the death rate of Whitewoods Castle and Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut was not as high as Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, but there were a few unlucky ones dying each month.If Saurun and the blonde acolyte were to avenge every dead fellow acolyte, then they would definitely have to first massacre the acolytes within their academy.The reason for following Leylin before was because they thought of him as a prey, and was prepared to play a good game with him.But now, Leylin\u2019s ability had far exceeded their expectations, and his actions were extremely meticulous, yet brutal, which made them rather fearful of him.\u201cIs that so?\u201dLeylin did not agree nor deny, and kept the black bow in his hands. He also picked up the cross blade which he had thrown on the ground earlier.\u201cA pity! You should not have followed me!\u201dLeylin growled softly, at the same time chanting an incantation, and gave his cross blade a smear with his hand.* Sssii! * The temperature suddenly dropped by a few degrees, and the frost continued to spread on the sword. In an instant, Leylin\u2019s cross blade turned into a transparent icy greatsword.He managed to obtain this set of frost alchemy runes from the corpse of the half beastman previously, who was the close associate of Extreme Night City Lord. After storing it into the A.I. Chip, he also did an analysis on it.At this moment, under the effect of the frost alchemy runes, the effect of the icy greatsword did not pale in comparison to a low-grade Magic Artifact!\u201cLight of the fallen!\u201d After brandishing his greatsword in satisfaction, Leylin activated another Magic Artifact on his body.* Peng! * A streak of an illusory glow was emitted from the Fallen Star Pendant, which engulfed Leylin\u2019s whole body. The silver-grey light slowly transformed into illusory armour, which protected Leylin.At this moment, Leylin, in his silver armour of light, with a transparent greatsword, looked just like a knight from the fables!The A.I. Chip\u2019s reminder continuously sounded in Leylin\u2019s head, [Under the effect of the frost runes, estimated degree of attack with the cross blade is 3 to 5, also carrying the side effect of an ice attack! The entire defense in the Fallen Star Pendant is activated, energy consumed is depleting, estimated to be fully depleted in 15 minutes!]\u201cWe have no choice but to fight!\u201dSaurun and the other female acolyte looked at each other in the eye and saw the viciousness reflected in their expressions.From Leylin\u2019s performance, it was clear that he was not inclined to let them go, so no matter how they pleaded it would be meaningless.Moreover, they were also geniuses with their own pride. They may not fare better in a 1-on-1 fight against Torash, but in a 2 against 1 situation, even Torash would have had a headache from fighting them.\u201cI\u2019ll stall him first; you prepare your formidable spell!\u201dSaurun said to the female acolyte and immediately reached out with his right hand.At this moment, the silver skin on his right hand shimmered and transformed into scales. His fingernails extended and curved downwards, the sharpness bringing a cold glint. His whole silvery human palm turned into silvery beast claw!A bloodthirsty tint emerged in Saurun\u2019s eyes as he stepped forward to shield the female blonde acolyte behind him.As for the female blonde acolyte, she continuously drew out ingredients from her robes as she chanted, from time to time using a dagger to cut her skin, dripping her fresh blood on the magic ingredients.A strong magical energy wave gradually formed around the female blonde acolyte.\u201cHow interesting. A close combat with a far cast, this is indeed a good combination!\u201dLeylin laughed manically and charged forward.* Bang! * With the effect of Leylin\u2019s Knight qualities, Saurun only saw a grey blur and could only instinctively reach out with his razor claw.* Peng! * The frost greatsword and the silver claw clashed. An icy, bone-chilling cold permeated to the silver claw, extending onto Saurun\u2019s body.\u201cSo fast!\u201d Saurun retreated several steps and hid the silver claw behind his back.Borrowing the concealment of his sleeves, there was a layer of frost which slowly climbed up his arm, until the point of his elbow.\u201cHaha\u2026. Great! Again!\u201dLeylin roared wildly, once again brandishing the greatsword and charged forward. Sensing the faint aura about him, Saurun couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes, with a notion of wanting to submit to Leylin.\u201cCross Blade Slash!\u201dLeylin hollered, the frost greatsword drew a beautiful cross. What was different from the previous energy wave was that the Cross Blade Slash now had formed a layer of ice which was sent chopping towards Saurun.\u201cArgh!\u201d Saurun\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he gritted his teeth and raised the silver claw before his body. The scales on the silvery claw quickly extended and took on the form of a small shield to block the attack.* Chi! * The greatsword made a huge dent in Saurun\u2019s silver defense. Not only were there white ice forming, the chilliness also permeated the area.* Pu! * Saurun revoked his silver shield, but now, upon his silvery right hand, there were two deep wounds through which bones could be seen and a sheet of cold ice blocked this wound from bleeding.An icy-cold sensation continuously spread within his body and Saurun was aghast upon having discovered that already his right hand was feeling numb as if it had lost all sensation and that his body movement had also become more and more restricted.\u201cDie!\u201dLeylin unhesitatingly brought the sword to Saurun\u2019s neck in order to behead him.\u201cNo!\u201d bellowed Saurun, waving the stub of his left hand. \u00a0His left hand had by now turned silver and the fingertips had a faint blackish tinge and he aimed a stab at Leylin\u2019s abdomen.Within the academy, all the apprentices knew that Saurun\u2019s achievements in Transfiguration far exceeded that of other similar disciples and that his right hand could transform and become a sharp, incomparable killing machine.However, all of the acolytes were deceived by Saurun. His left hand was the real trump card!Not only could he use beast transfiguration for his silver-claw attack, it even had a Shadow and Toxic element that Saurun had paid a high price for. As long as the poison were to be smeared onto the opponent\u2019s skin, even an official Magus would be in trouble!On the brink of death, Saurun adopted a fighting method that would result in both parties being severely injured, for the sliver of a chance at survival!* Peng! *Leylin\u2019s expression was grim as he allowed the razor sharp claw to scratch his body. At the same time, the frost greatsword swung down mercilessly as it severed Saurun\u2019s head from his neck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His both eyes were opened wide; he was no longer able to close them.His headless corpse was still kneeling in front of Leylin and blood poured out from it continuously.The corpse\u2019s left hand was still extended \u2014 it was his misfortune that it was blocked by grey radiant armour, a few inches away from Leylin\u2019s body.\u201cWith the defense of the Fallen Star Pendant, I don\u2019t have to fear most of the acolytes\u2019 attacks. Along with the frost runes\u2019 enhancement of a greatsword, combined with my Knight\u2019s abilities, it is one of the top strengths amongst acolytes!\u201dLeylin was very satisfied with this battle\u2019s outcome.Saurun was only an acolyte who was slightly less inferior than Torash. When Leylin, however, used his techniques, he could not withstand even a few rounds before being completely defeated, even with his head being chopped off.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn now!\u201d Leylin kicked Saurun\u2019s corpse away and charged towards the female blond acolyte.\u201cIt\u2019s completed!\u201dAt the same time, the female blond acolyte exhaled, as if shouldering a huge burden.A bright red flower unfolded its petals and revealed a green rock the size of a fist. It had a dazzling gleam, with the female blond acolyte\u2019s fresh blood that was sprayed on it. There was also a broken half of a dagger, which was thrown on the floor.These 3 items faintly resembled a triangular formation, with many greyish power runes surrounding them.As Leylin\u2019s charged forward fiercely, the female blond acolyte smirked and pointed at Leylin, \u201cBy the name of Memphis Rofar Maginent, of the Gigantic Binding Sprite from the abyss, the person that I point to will lose all ability of motion!\u201d* Weng Weng! *Light began to shine from the triangular formation, and Leylin suddenly felt a huge binding strength engulfing him, which made him rooted to the spot.\u201cA spell like this? A human customised spell?\u201dLeylin continuously writhed and the sounds of shackles sounded from the void.\u201cThere is no cause for you to resist further. These are the chains of the Gigantic Binding Abyss Sprite. No matter how many of them you break, the remaining amount would not only regrow, but the binding power will also be doubled!\u201dAs the female acolyte spoke, Leylin felt the chain getting tighter and tighter around his body.* Chi! * The silver glow from the Fallen Star Pendant continuously clashed against strength from the void, time to time producing white mist.\u201cYou despicable maggot, the shameless murderer, you dared to killed the acolytes from two of our great academies, so I will grant you death to redeem your sins!\u201dThe thrill of revenge and smugness filled the face of the female acolyte. The muscles on her face contorted, turning the once-beautiful face into an extremely loathsome one.\u201cYou dared to kill Saurun; I will make you pay the price of blood!\u201dThe female acolyte pointed at Leylin, \u201cStrength! Deprivation!\u201dAs she spoke, Leylin felt the strength in his body dispersing. In an instant, it was as if he changed from a Knight into a regular human infant.\u201cThis feeling, have I been cursed?\u201dLeylin continuously struggled, \u201cSuch a measly curse, how can it make me bow my head!\u201d\u201cIt all has ended!\u201d The female acolyte chanted in an incantation, \u201cFlames of the abyss, cremate this sinner into ashes!\u201dAs soon as the Byron language incantation had been uttered, a black fire suddenly blazed from below Leylin\u2019s body.The flame continuously spread, engulfing Leylin\u2019s whole body in an instant.* Peng! * The frost greatsword on Leylin\u2019s hands fell onto the floor. The icy shards shattered and broke into many pieces. Finally, even the refined metal blade of the cross blade melted under the black red flames, turning into a puddle of liquid metal.* Chi Chi! *The grey armour on Leylin\u2019s body started to give in, and the A.I. Chip wildly flashed its alert in front of Leylin\u2019s eyes, [Warning! Warning! The energy from the Fallen Star Pendant is rapidly decreasing. Currently left with: 45%. Estimated to be fully depleted in 34 seconds!]\u201cIgnore it and release all the energy within the Fallen Star Pendant in one go!\u201d Leylin ordered.\u201cWeng Weng!\u201d In that moment, the silver-grey light increased its radiance by a dozen times. Behind his back, there was an indistinct huge cross phantom. On the upper area of the phantom cross, a few jewels continuously gave off multi-coloured light as a wave of energy extended to Leylin\u2019s limbs.\u201cBreak\u2026for me!\u201dLeylin struggled with all his might, and suddenly, crackling and rattling sounds could he heard from his body, and the countless black-rune-inscribed chains became visible and broke from all the struggling done by Leylin. They then fell to the ground and vanished.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn now, you disgusting whore!\u201dLeylin\u2019s figure flew like a gust of wind and appeared directly in front of the female acolyte.\u201cIm\u2026Impossible, how did you manage to counter it?\u201d shrieked the female blonde acolyte and she pointed her finger at Leylin. Then several basin- sized fireballs directly struck Leylin\u2019s body.* Boom! * The flames exploded, burning with the previous black fire, as it extinguished very soon.Behind the silver grey transparent armour, Leylin was unscathed.\u201cNo! No!\u201d The female acolyte fell onto the ground and crawled backwards.Leylin kicked the green rock and dagger on the ground, breaking the spell formation.Two streams of red fluid trickled down from the female acolyte\u2019s nose, even her tears were falling.\u201cNo! Don\u2019t kill me! My mentor is\u2026.\u201dThe female acolyte snivelled continuously as she crawled and spoke.\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression appeared indifferent as he embraced this blonde woman.The Fallen Star Pendant kept defending his body from the abyss black fire that was still burning on his body, but this female acolyte obviously did not have a similar layer of defense. Upon being the barbecued by the flames, she gave an ear-piercing shriek.* Sssii! * The flesh of the girl dropped, chunk by chunk, onto the floor, turning into a pile of charred mess.Finally, the originally beautiful female acolyte turned into a blood red skeleton. Moreover, the set of bones slowly melted, turning into a white liquid which dripped onto the floorLeylin grimaced and with his hand, he swept away the remainder of the white bone liquid that were on him.After which, as if he were changing his clothes, he \u2018took off\u2019 the grey armour.As for the black red abyss flame on the grey armour, it was also removed.\u201cIn the legends and tales told by the bards, the abyss fire is something which can burn the void. An existence that all children of the earth cannot resist! This is most likely just a projection of the true abyss fire\u2014 it does not have even one zillionth of the original\u2019s might. If not, I would have long turned into ashes!\u201dLeylin thought for a while, before returning to the original place. He then recorded all of the ingredients and the spell formation that the female acolyte used before roaming the battlefield to collect his spoils of war.* Peng! * The unconscious Jayden was tossed before Bicky.Although the battle earlier was extremely intense, the time that had passed was extremely short \u2014 so much so that Bicky was still in shock.\u201cHurry and leave this place. The energy waves from earlier would attract many acolytes over. If you don\u2019t wish to die, hurry and leave now!\u201dLeylin cleared his throat and looked at Bicky who nodded her head before he left the place.Looking at the back of Leylin, Bicky\u2019s expression was extremely complicated.This person was here to save her. Moreover, the strength that he possessed was far above that which Bicky could imagine.Lightning Wielder, Silver Claw, they were all impressive and notable acolytes from the opposing academies. However in front of that person earlier, they were as weak as a sponge when they pleaded and was slaughtered mercilessly.\u201cBut. . . exactly who is he?\u201dBicky blinked her eyes. Merlin, Leylin, Fayle and the others, all of the acolytes\u2019 images flashed past from her memory, yet she felt helpless as there was no such person in all of the acolytes that she recalled that resembled her savior.However, her instincts told her that she definitely knew this person and that they had an extremely intimate relationship!\u201cMagi are reputed for their rationality. Such a thing like instinct will lower our judgment. Everything has to be proved beyond refutation\u2026.\u201dThe sayings of an elder surfaced in her mind.Bicky\u2019s expression was seemingly vacant as she gritted her teeth and poured a potion on Jayden\u2019s face, before she,too, left that place.Although Jayden was Molly\u2019s idol, she was now dead. Naturally Bicky wouldn\u2019t risk anymore for Jayden.Minutes later, Jayden opened his eyes and got up.\u201cWhat happened to me? Where is Torash?\u201dJayden was at a loss, before the colours on his face changed. Touching his chest, he felt for the Magic Artifact which was still resting in his arms. Moreover, when he ensured that his sack was present, only then did he heave a sigh of relief.\u201cThis is the aftermath of an intense battle! Who is it that saved me?\u201dJayden scratched his forehead, before thinking of a girl\u2019s figure who had dashed towards him, \u201cWas it Molly? Such a terrifying battle, I wonder how she is\u2026.\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d Footsteps sounds drew closer and very soon 2 acolytes appeared within Jayden\u2019s vision.\u201cAn acolyte from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy! Kill him!\u201dAfter seeing Jayden, the two acolytes let off an excited howl and began to prepare their Rank 0 spells.Jayden sighed, before bringing out his Magic Artifact once again\u2026Leylin was, by now, dozens of miles away from this battlefield. He was settled in a cave, checking his spoils.Those 3 acolytes were well known for their strengths. Furthermore, the ingredients and Magic Crystals that they carried with them were plentiful. They gave Leylin a total of tens of thousands of Magic Crystals and other valuable resources.Leylin felt the surface of a black red diary cover, and he exclaimed in glee, \u201cThis aura is rather similar to the female acolyte\u2019s abyss fire!\u201dLeylin flipped open the diary and a mysterious rune appeared, \u201cA.I. Chip, compare to database!\u201d[Beep! Mission establishing, comparison in progress! Similarity level to Abyss script: 98.7%, Purgatory script: 45.3%\u2026.]\u201cAbyss script?\u201d Leylin had a headache. Characters and knowledge from these mysterious planes were top-secrets and the knowledge was not passed around. He only managed to understand a few runes from derelict pages of a book in the library and stored them into the A.I. Chip database.\u201cNo matter what, it is a good spoil!\u201dSatisfied, Leylin kept the black red diary in his possession.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayConclusionWhat followed next was the most valuable loot this time around.Leylin looked at the pile of items in front of him and muttered irresolutely to himself.There were a few broken items, a dagger which had been broken into half, the remnant of a silver palm, with an incomplete silver necklace, with lightning flashing time to time.The 3 acolytes who died under Leylin\u2019s hands were the potential Magi of the enemy academies, so how could they not have Magic Artifacts on them?It was a pity, however, that the broken dagger from the female blonde acolyte was only used to summon the aura of the abyss, and Leylin was still unable to figure out how the other items were meant to be used.As for Silver-Claw Saurun, he was totally a pervert, who actually infused the Magic Artifact into his own palm.Leylin could only chop the whole palm down, to try to separate the various properties in the Magic Artifact.As for Torash, the Magic Artifact on him had also destroyed itself, which was the reason why he could unleash an attack of 16 degrees at the end.The probing of Magic Artifacts was an extremely dangerous task. Before further information, Leylin did not dare to risk and use these items.Moreover, who knows if there were some booby trap laid within the Magic Artifacts by the enemy, thus Leylin felt that he should be more cautious.If he discovered that they might cause trouble to him, no matter how much Leylin was reluctant to part with them he would still toss them away within this secret plane.After all, he did not wish for an official Magus to notice him.\u201cActually, there is still a Magic Artifact that can be easily obtained! That is the green vine badge on Jayden\u2019s body!\u201dLeylin saw Jayden use this Magic Artifact on the Dirigible before, back when he used it to suppress Kaliweir, leaving a strong impression on Leylin\u2019s memory.However, this badge was given to him by Professor Dorotte.As for Dorotte, he was an official Magus in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. If Leylin snatched an enemy\u2019s Magic Artifact and hid in the academy, he might be safe. However if he took Jayden\u2019s, then Leylin wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy anymore.During the academy\u2019s critical moments, if the news that he was still causing harm to fellow acolytes got out, then Leylin\u2019s name would be equivalent to the despised street rat, in the Magus World.He would not lose his rationality for just this little benefit.\u201cThere is this also!\u201dLeylin flicked his hands, and two differently shaped badges appeared in his hands.This were the badges of Saurun and the female blonde acolyte. Although they were weaker than Torash by a little, but it was still worth at least 20 to 30 contribution points.\u201cAt first, I\u2019ll just hold onto these. If I\u2019m able to find other badges in future then I won\u2019t exchange these!\u201dThese two badges were Leylin\u2019s insurance. If he was able to collect other badges in the secret plane to accumulate 50 contribution points, then he wouldn\u2019t use these.However, if the contribution points were not enough, then Leylin had no choice, and could only hand over one of them or both.As for Torash, Leylin felt that his strength was of great importance to his academy and the person backing Torash would have spent enormous efforts in nurturing him and so it was better to not provoke him.\u2026\u2026Two days passed.The wilderness found outside the secret plane was lit up with a bright yellow color. \u00a0From time to time, there were gusts of wind blowing granules of sand, and the living organisms on the ground avoided this place at all cost \u2014 even the moles and ants were not an exception.The entrance to the secret plane was slowly shrinking as if it were a live animal.Outside of the entrance, the 3 chairmen and all the professors looked at the entrance that was constantly glowing with varying colours and had different expressions on their faces.Siley looked at the silver hourglass floating in midair. On the upper half of the hourglass, beads of golden sand trickled downwards, finally leaving behind a thin layer.* Di! * With the passing of time, the final golden bead of sand trickled downward.\u201cThe time is up, let us receive our acolytes!\u201d Siley opened his mouth and spoke in a low tone.\u201cAre you extremely anxious?\u201d Guru who was at the side smirked, \u201cEvery minute more that passes, one acolyte in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy will be slain. Their heads will become the glory of my Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut, and hung on the large gates\u2026.\u201d\u201cAt this moment, the secret plane might no longer have anymore Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes. We all know that once the acolytes from the two academies have gathered, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s acolytes would be meat on a chopping board for us to slice, and is not even equivalent to a lamb.The other blonde women smiled \u2014 but her smiled seemed somewhat malicious.\u201cNicola, you still can\u2019t let it go?\u201d Finally, a trace of expression surfaced on Siley\u2019s face, and it seemed to be \u2013 regret?\u201cI have long since forgotten the matters from the past!\u201d The female blonde woman Nicola said with a frosty expression.\u201cYou can seek revenge for the matters previously, but once you are bent on destroying this academy that I succeeded as a professor, then you will be my eternal nemesis!\u201dSiley\u2019s face too gradually hardened.\u201cHaha\u2026Haha\u2026 You are still as arrogant as before, thinking that you are the main character of some novel, which the earth would revolve around you indefinitely!\u201d\u201cHowever such an expression makes me want to puke!\u201d \u00a0Said the blonde woman as her eyes appeared to emit flames.\u201cI want to destroy your life\u2019s work, destroy the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, even if there is the Lighthouse of the Night mediating, this time, there is still the next time\u2026.\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Guru at the side interrupted Nicola.\u201cEarlier you did not stop me and Siley from fighting, but why is it that you can\u2019t endure it now?\u201d\u201cMy reason for stopping you was because I want to take action myself!\u201d Nicola\u2019s maniacal look grew even stronger.\u201cEnough!\u201d A dense black colour descended, and covered the sky in an instant.Amidst the darkness, there was a bright yellow light that came from within, revealing a figure that was wrapped in black robes.\u201cSir!\u201d The three chairmen bowed.They were only Rank 2 Magus, yet this person in front of them was a true Rank 3 Magus! Every level in the Magus World had an obvious difference like that between the sky and earth.Previously, it was this Sir that suppressed the 3 of them to mediate the war.\u201cSince my Lighthouse of the Night has already stepped in, any conflicts that arise after is deemed as a provocation to us, as the contract and date are still effective.\u201dThe black-robed man had a pair of dark green eyes. No matter if it was Siley or the other 2 chairman, if these eyes landed on them, they would shudder as if being trapped by some magical beast.This feeling of imminent death finally brought Nicola out from her madness.\u201cFrom now, activate the spell formation, and receive the acolytes within the secret plane!\u201d\u201cYes, Sir!\u201d* Peng! *A fiery explosion erupted, and set the acolytes behind Leylin on fire, turning them into ashes.Leylin\u2019s footsteps did not stop as he continued to escape.\u201cIt\u2019s him who killed Seet, Kroc, and Old Eagle, don\u2019t let him escape!\u201dBehind him, parties of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle acolytes were formed, a standard party of seven, which continuously gave chase.Leylin\u2019s pursuers gradually drew closer.* Peng! * Leylin flung another two explosive potions again, where flames continuously extended behind him.The acolytes yelled and Leylin drew a longer distance from them.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Leylin\u2019s face was downcast.After killing the 3 acolytes previously, Leylin began his hunting movement all alone again.At first, it was rather smooth sailing, where he collected another Level 3 Acolyte\u2019s badge. This time, he specifically chose those who were rather old or those with no powerful items on them. They were those who seemed not able to advance further and had no strong backing behind them.During the later half of the second day, all of the enemy camp acolytes had already gathered and formed group spell formations!All of them were performed by Level 2 or 3 Acolyte groups. If their numbers were sufficient, even a Rank 1 Magus had to seek retreat temporarily.Leylin had no choice, so he could only conceal himself and stop his hunt.With the detection of the A.I. Chip, he managed to successfully hide until this day.Things went according to how he had predicted: after the acolytes had gathered, they formed smaller squadrons and made a thorough search of the secret plane. They maintained a wanting-to-kill-every-last-enemy posture.Many Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes were immediately killed, and under the opponent\u2019s immense pressure, they could not even resist.Leylin even saw a Level 3 Acolyte who carried a Magic Artifact, but that acolyte could only survive for a few more minutes under the spell formation. Afterward, he was ripped to shreds by the countless Rank 0 spells that befell on him. Even the Magic Artifact became the trophy prize for his opponents.Leylin could only extend his sympathisation to this fellow acolyte, and covered his tracks even more covertly.Fortunately, the methods of magicians were extremely strange, and the opponents were only two academies who could not completely be harmonious amongst themselves. This gave the acolytes of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy a chance for survival!After Leylin estimated that time was almost up, he immediately ambushed a small party, since he was one badge short of his goal.According to his estimation, once he kills the opponents, then the time would be up, where he would even be teleported out and not need to face the group\u2019s counterattack.\u201cFuck! This lack of punctuality will have people killed!\u201dOf course, Leylin wouldn\u2019t expect that the time would be delayed due to the enmity of the chairmen, which resulted in an error to his calculations.After killing one of the Level 3 Acolyte, he was immediately surrounded and attacked.\u201cThe Fallen Star Pendant\u2019s energy was fully consumed the last time and I have not recharged it. If not I could have escaped long ago!\u201dLeylin gritted his teeth and gave an order, \u201cA.I. Chip! Detect the geographical area and calculation the best retreat route!\u201d[Beep! Mission establishing!]Along with the A.I. Chip\u2019s indication, Leylin began to make various unexpected ducking movements amidst the dense forest, slowly pulling the distance further away from the pursuing acolytes.\u201cI have finally escaped!\u201dAfter running for over a dozen miles and shaking off his pursuers, suddenly he felt dizzy, and the badge pinned to his chest glowed resplendently.\u201cFuck, the teleportation is finally here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His hand touched a badge and holding it he said, \u201cThere is no force felt from this badge, it seems that the pulling force of the badge only works on those acolytes who are still alive. If that\u2019s the case!\u201dLeylin waved his hands, and 2 badges that belonged to two Level 3 Acolytes was tossed out of the light bubble.These two badges had, at one time, belonged to Silver-Claw Saurun and the female blonde acolyte. Since Leylin had already collected sufficient badges, he would no longer keep these two with him.\u201cI also have this thing with me!\u201d said Leylin, as he withdrew an iron chain that had an electrical current and also threw that away.After a thorough examination by the A.I. Chip on this destroyed Magic Artifact, there was a hidden Spiritual Force within it which kept pulsating \u2014 it seemed that this force had a tracking ability. If Leylin were to bring this item with him, then the professors of the enemy academy would know immediately that he was the one who had killed Torash.As for the other items taken from the acolytes \u2014 the half dagger and the shattered palm \u2014 there were no problems if he brought them back with him. They were carefully placed within his rucksack.\u201cThe final procedure!\u201dLeylin smiled heartily, and removed the Shapeshifting spell.The muscles on his face contorted, as his height continuously grew. Very soon, Leylin resumed the state of his original appearance.\u201cI have been acting inside the secret plane with this disguise, where no one had seen my true appearance!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid after I exit, the enemy academy would wildly search for an acolyte that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d After thinking of the probable scene in the future, he could not help but smile.\u201cRight now, I am Leylin Farlier, an ordinary Potioneering acolyte!\u201d\u2026\u2026Looking at the dazzling rainbow coloured exit, Leylin\u2019s smile widened yet even more\u2026.With much effort, Leylin managed to suppress the dizziness that came abruptly and did not vomit.\u201cThe feeling of crossing planes is not a great one!\u201d\u201cHurry up and move, don\u2019t block the way!\u201d A cold voice sounded right beside Leylin\u2019s ear.Leylin hurriedly bowed and left the place.Only then, did he take a look at the surroundings.Outside the exit of the secret plane, it looked the same as before. The 3 academies were divided into a triangular formation where they faced each other. Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle members stood closer together, and faced the common enemy, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, in unison.As for now, acolytes continuously swarmed out from the exit, returning back to their respective professor\u2019s side.\u201cWho is that person?\u201dLeylin saw a black robed man ahead of the 3 chairmen. He couldn\u2019t help guessing the person\u2019s identity.*Shua!* But now, because the black-robed man felt Leylin\u2019s unwavering sight upon him, he turned his head around and looked back.He immediately glanced upon a pair of dark green eyes.The surrounding world was as if it had been suspended in time; everywhere one could see only green.The acolytes and professors around Leylin seemed to turned into jade statues where no signs of life could be observed.Leylin strove to open his mouth, but he found no words coming out of his mouth.\u201cLeylin! Leylin! Leylin!\u201cThe surrounding statues suddenly opened their mouths, chanting Leylin\u2019s name.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Leylin roared within his heart, but not a single word could be spoken.* Peng! Peng * The dark green sculptures began to move and green dust constantly fell off of them. Their eyes had become red-colored, as if the sockets had been embedded with rubies.\u2026\u2026Countless green statues swarmed around Leylin, drowning him\u2026.\u201cArgh!\u201d Leylin suddenly regained consciousness and panted heavily.\u201cWhat happened earlier?\u201d The surrounding acolytes now seemed to be doing fine, yet Leylin did not dare to look in the direction of those chairmen again.\u201cRelax, son!\u201d A pair of hands with a medicinal scent covered Leylin\u2019s head, emitting a white glowing light.\u201cProfessor Kroft!\u201d Leylin bowed deeply. Under the white light, he felt much better.\u201cWas it you who saved me?\u201d\u201cI did not exactly \u2018save\u2019 you, only a small favour.\u201d Professor Kroft smiled and led Leylin back towards their academy\u2019s gathering area.\u201cOfficial Magi always have a defensive force field surrounding them. Moreover, most of it are instantly activated or have a permanent effect. As for higher ranking Magi, they have an even stronger force field encircling them at all times. An ordinary acolyte cannot even get close to them!\u201dKroft explained for Leylin.\u201cJust now, that Magus from the Lighthouse of the Night did not do it intentionally; he just looked over this side and immediately many apprentices got caught in a hallucination. If a professor wasn\u2019t here, then I would have been. . . \u201dKroft\u2019s expression slowly turned stern, \u201cLeylin, before you turn into an official Magus, remember to steer clear of any high ranking Magus! If not, I would not even be able to imagine your end\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind!\u201d Leylin\u2019s expression was extremely solemn as he nodded his head.Only a slight glance had almost cost Leylin his life, which left him a lingering fear. Moreover it had resolved his determination to climb up in the ranks of the food chain.\u201cI don\u2019t wish for my soul to crumble immediately in the future just because a high ranking Magus crosses my path in the future. This would really be a grievance!\u201dAlthough higher ranking Magus could exercise restraint on their forcefields, it would mean that they were showing their softer side. Leylin could not imagine anyone doing that for him.\u201cAlright now! Welcome back son!\u201dAfter healing Leylin, Kroft revealed a sincere smile.\u201cBeing able to see you again is really great!\u201d Leylin also smiled as he hugged his professor.At this moment, only then he had time to view the casualties in his own academy.Due to the teaming up of the other two academies, a huge number of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u2019s acolytes had perished previously in the war. Right now it seems that Abyssal Bone Forest Academy suffered an even more severe casualty count.At this moment, behind the professors, there was only a few scattered acolytes standing behind him. Most of them carried injuries with a gloomy expression.\u201cLeylin!\u201d A pleasantly surprised voiced sounded in his ear.\u201cBicky!\u201d Leylin smiled warmly and hugged the curvaceous and beautiful Bicky.\u201cVery good. I still believed in you\u2026.\u201d Tears welled up in Bicky\u2019s eyes.It seemed like she was worried about Leylin but that she did not know he was the mysterious man who had saved her before.Leylin took another look at Bicky and was rather surprised when she was actually not injured the slightest, only that her mental state did not seem to to be in the best condition. He could not help but feel so as even if it was a Level 3 Acolyte from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, under the oppression in numbers from their enemy, they may not be able to protect their lives.As if seeing Leylin\u2019s bewilderment, Bicky spoke on her own accord, \u201cI met Molly right after entering. Also, I met with an extremely powerful enemy acolyte, but a stranger saved me. After that, I met Fayle and it was him who kept me by his side, so I was able to live up till now.Bicky pointed at an acolyte behind a professor.Leylin looked over, and it was indeed Fayle who he saw before. After a span of 3 years, he seemed to be even more mature and had more charisma.With a Level 3 Acolyte protecting her coupled with some luck, it was probable that she could survive. Leylin nodded his head and did not ask further.After casually exchanging a few sentences with Bicky, Leylin looked at the secret plane\u2019s exit. Most of them were enemy acolytes streaming out, where very few Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes came out. Leylin sighed inwardly, \u201cIt seems that this time Abyssal Bone Forest Academy suffered a great loss. I\u2019m afraid that there will be a scenario where Abyssal Bone Forest Academy would have more professors than acolytes period of time.* Peng! * At this moment, another acolyte walked out from the exit.This acolyte wore the grey robes of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, and had several holes in them. Injuries seemed to riddle his body and there was even traces of blood. Moreover, an arm was missing.\u201cIt\u2019s Jayden!\u201d Leylin\u2019s pupils contracted.Towards magicians, missing a limb was no big issue. There were various and mysterious spells which could regrow their limbs.Jayden braced himself and walked several steps forward. After seeing his professor from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, he smiled and fainted immediately.* Shua! * A white figure immediately appeared in front of Jayden and caught him.After the white flash stopped, Leylin saw the appearance of the Magus within \u2013 It was a skeleton with an underworld flame in its eyes!\u201cProfessor Dorotte!\u201d Leylin called out the name of this set of bones.Previously, it was Dorotte who led Leylin into Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. Moreover, he was Jayden\u2019s mentor and even gave Jayden a Magic Artifact. It seemed like he doted on Jayden rather much.\u201cAlright! After my detection, there are no more surviving acolytes inside the secret plane. Seal the exit!\u2019The black robed figure standing before the 3 chairmen spoke.Once he spoke, the 2 camps sank into deep silence, before the murmuring and sighing noises sounded incessantly.\u201cNo! Where is my Torash? He is definitely still inside!\u201d\u201cSilver-Claw Saurun? Hurry and come out! He is a genius acolyte, how could the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy manage to defeat him?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cMorphis! Morphis, where are you?\u201dConstant cries were heard from the enemy camp.And the Abyssal bone Forest Academy\u2019s party seemed to have already expected this. Although the numbers of dead acolytes were many, the reactions of all professors were much lower than what Leylin had expected.Even for the Potioneering talent Merlin, his responsible Professor (Kroft) only let out a soft dismal gasp upon receiving news of his death.\u201cTorash! Torash! I left Spiritual Force coordinates on his body; he should be present amongst us here!\u201dOn the opposite side, a blue bearded old guy yelled madly, following which he chanted an incantation.* Bang! *A bright blue beam of light drifted floated above Jayden who had fainted. Within this light an indistinct badge of an acolyte could be seen .\u201cArgh! No! My Torash! I will kill you!\u201dThe expression on the face of the blue bearded old guy contorted, where a massive thunderstorm appeared midair above him.\u201cTorash\u2019s power, when compared to this, is absolutely rubbish.\u201d Leylin gulped, and suddenly felt extremely lucky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Warlock of the Magus WorldCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGrine Water\u201cInside the secret plane, one must take responsibility for themselves in the bloodbath; do you wish to violate the agreement?\u201dUnder the massive thunderstorm, Dorotte stood up with many faint silver beast claws on his back.\u201cEnough!\u201dThe black-robed figure standing in front of the 3 chairmen spoke, and a gigantic dark green hand grabbed at the sky. * Weng Weng! * The massive lightning was immediately scattered by the giant hand.\u201cI have said before to abide by the agreement!\u201d The black-robed figure growled.At the same time, the blue-bearded geezer spurted a huge mouthful of blood. Anger was quickly replaced with fear as he knelt down, \u201cSir, please forgive an old man, who has just lost his nephew, with your magnanimity!\u201d\u201cJust this once! If not, I will extract your soul and roast it in the abyss for ten thousand years!\u201dThe black-robed figure spoke again.The blue-bearded geezer then went back to his academy\u2019s camp, before giving Jayden a vicious look.This hatred and determination of killing Jayden gave Dorotte a headache. Crackling and rattling noises could be heard from the skeletal figure.\u201cAlthough this time nothing has happened, Jayden will definitely be pursued by Blue-Beard unless he keeps hiding inside the academy!\u201dLeylin\u2019s eyes turned cold.Earlier, the A.I. Chip picked up several traces of energy waves from spells.Obviously, it was the search for the enemy who had killed their genius acolyte! If Leylin were to still keep those items that carried their traces, his outcome would now be the same as Jayden.Those professors who had had their personal apprentices or successors killed by the other party \u2014 who was also their sworn enemy \u2014 swore they would make the killer pay with their blood!As for the casualties of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy,they were not considered because the other two academies were facing many more losses.Although they were bound by the agreement and vigilance of the Lighthouse of the Night, as far as Magi were concerned, if they were to pay the price, they could indirectly find a way to exact their revenge!For example, not taking action themselves, but suggesting to Magi outside of the agreement to act on their behalf. The black market was also an option worth considering.\u2026\u2026Late in the night, Leylin returned to his resting area and laid down on his bed. In his hands was a faint yellow test tube that he kept on toying with.The test tube was made of faint yellow crystals, and its density was extremely high. Holding it in his hands, he sensed a rather heavy feeling.These crystals were made from a precious ingredient \u2013 Nitrogen Crystals. Any spell that was 20 degrees or lesser would not be able to damage it.Using these Nitrogen Crystals to make a test tube \u2014 this was often used to store potions which were more valuable.According to the olden texts, test tube made from Nitrogen Crystals were known to have preserved the contents even after a thousand years.Within the faint yellow test tube, there was a ball of translucent liquid.Leylin casually swirled the test tube. Under the refraction of the light, the liquid within gave off a rainbow-coloured glow, as it continuously whirled, seemingly beautiful.\u201cThis is the Grine Water of the myths which could aid acolytes to breakthrough into an official Magus!\u201d Leylin looked at the test tube and muttered.Earlier, under the suppression of the Magus from Lighthouse of the Night, the chairmen of Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle had had no choice but to bow their heads, then leading their acolytes away.Even Torash\u2019s professor was not that stupid to offend the high ranking Magus for the second time.As for Leylin and the rest, they were led back to Abyssal Bone Forest Academy by their professors.Leylin intentionally glanced and saw that at this moment the acolytes in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy did not amount to over 50.As for any regular academy, they would have thousands of acolytes!One can say that Sage Gotham\u2019s Hut and Whitewoods Castle had accomplished their mission by almost swallowing the entire batch of successors in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy; if it were not for the fact that a few of their genius acolytes had perished inside the secret plane!Even so, they originally had 200 acolytes enter the secret plane. Yet in the end only about a hundred came out from it.Compared to Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, this was considered a great victory.\u201cHowever\u2026 All these have nothing to do with me!\u201d Leylin looked at the potion in his hands that seemed like an illusion.\u201cWhat matters is that I got the Grine Water! Moreover, the academy has an anonymous exchange policy, which is extremely thoughtful for its acolytes!\u201dOn the way back to the academy, Leylin and the fortunate surviving acolytes were told about the contribution points they obtained and the details of it, where they can undergo the exchange privately.Furthermore, the person that was in charge of the exchange was an alchemy beast created by the chairman with no human feelings whatsoever, so it wouldn\u2019t reveal the acolytes\u2019 exchanges.One can say that although Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was extremely bloodthirsty, where there was a strong culture of the strong eats the weak, towards the protection of acolytes with true strength and abilities, they still did a rather good job.Leylin only barely managed to scrape 50 contribution points, exchanging for a standard amount of Grine Water.As for the catalogue on the contribution points exchange list, there were various precious ingredients, Rank 1 spell models, and even Spiritual Force Potions. Looking on, Leylin felt overwhelmed by it.At that time, deep down Leylin had some regret over not taking the few genius acolytes\u2019 badges along with him.However, after seeing Jayden with a gloomy expression, Leylin very soon buried this tinge of regret deep inside his heart.Although Torash\u2019s badge was worth at least 50 contribution points, which could be exchanged with many resources, the look that other acolytes had when they saw Jayden was full of pity.Incurring the wrath of an official Magus for these resources, was it really worth it?Moreover, the other professors did not know of their apprentices\u2019 scores, yet Dorotte knew Jayden\u2019s amount of contribution points like the back of his hand. Before anything else, at the very least, half of Torash\u2019s contribution points would be taken by Dorotte.After all, he defended an opposing Rank 1 Magus for Jayden!\u201cBefore becoming an official Magus, it is best to maintain a low profile. There won\u2019t be anything wrong with that!\u201d Seeing Jayden\u2019s outcome, Leylin steeled his heart with this resolve.His senior Merlin was a great example of this.Merlin\u2019s achievements and talent in Potioneering could be said to be extraordinary. If not for Leylin cheating by using the A.I. Chip, he would definitely be left far behind in this aspect.But so what?It was due to Merlin\u2019s reputation that made his enemies concentrate their attacks on him, finally causing him to die during the secret plane\u2019s bloodbath.No matter how genius an acolyte was before they manage to grow strong, they weren\u2019t even comparable to a pebble on the road.As for Leylin, he always created the false image of being inferior to Merlin, allowing Merlin to attract the attention off from him. He successfully managed to divert his enemy\u2019s attention, so there were very few that bothered about him inside the secret plane.\u201cHowever, this trick will not work for the time being!\u201dLeylin toyed with the Grine Water in his hands, his face gradually turning solemn.The surviving acolytes after the bloodbath amounted to less than 50, which was even less than the number of professors.Moreover, all survivors will be deemed as elites!Under these circumstances, greater attention will be paid to any acolytes!Leylin did not have any confidence whatsoever to try anything funny for the fear of being discovered.\u201cPerhaps, I should make a trip outside. Previously, Roman spoke of the high-grade meditation technique. If I found it, it would definitely be much better than the Grine Water\u2026\u201dPreviously, before the Fallen Star Pendant was completed, Leylin had managed to swindle much information from that vengeful spirit, Roman, regarding the information of high-grade meditation technique left behind by the Great Magus Serholm.According to Roman, the inheritance of Great Magus Serholm was located inside the Dylan Gardens of the Zither Moon Mountain Plains.Magi who used high-grade meditation techniques were definitely stronger than Magi who used the Grine Water to breakthrough! Moreover, more potential would be realised, revealing more possibilities for future development.Leylin wanted to climb to the apex of the Magus World. If he wished to have the potential for future advancements, using the Grine Water to breakthrough would be his last resort.Thinking of the Fallen Star Pendant, Leylin removed the silvery grey cross from his neck.On the surface of the cross was embedded with various colours of gemstones, which looked to be an impeccable art piece.However, right now the gemstones on the Fallen Star Pendant seemed to glow dimly, as it had undergone a huge consumption.[Fallen Star Pendant: Low-grade Magic Artifact. Effect: Instantly cast a defence. Current condition: All energy consumed, 0%]The A.I. Chip showed the stats of the Fallen Star Pendant to Leylin.Fallen Star Pendant \u2014 it was the item that attributed the most to Leylin\u2019s survival and killing the geniuses of the enemy this time.The instantaneous layer of defense that the silvery cross radiated, no matter if it was physical of magical resistance, had reached a very high degree. Few below the ranks of an official Magus could penetrate its defenses.However, in any world, the law of conservation of energy must be fulfilled. Every time the Fallen Star Pendant was activated, it required a consumption of energy. Once the energy was fully consumed, it wouldn\u2019t be anything more than a pretty necklace!\u201cThe Fallen Star Pendant\u2019s defence is rather good, only that the energy is not enough!\u201dLeylin felt somewhat regretful, \u201cA.I. Chip! Establish mission. Apart from the calculation ability for the Host, use all remaining computation abilities to find out ways to conserve the energy of the Fallen Star Pendant!\u201d[Beep! Mission establishing! Beginning to use idle processes to calculate, time is unknown!] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.Leylin nodded his head and came to the experiment at the side. He placed the Fallen Star Pendant in the centre of a mysterious spell formation. Around it, were many blue glittering stones.\u201cActivating process of recharging!\u201d* Weng Weng! * With the command of Leylin, faint blue light beams shone from the formation. Starlight was extracted from these stones and placed into the Fallen Star Pendant.[Fallen Star Pendant recharging in process, current state: 1%\u2026.] The A.I. Chip\u2019s voice intoned.The recharge of the Fallen Star Pendant actually only required for starlight to be shone on it. As long as it was bathed in starlight when the energy was fully consumed, the Fallen Star Pendant would automatically complete the recharging process.However, in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, wanting to bathe it in starlight was an impossible task. Thus, Leylin could only use other methods to conduct the recharging process.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
